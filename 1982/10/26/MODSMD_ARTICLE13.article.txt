## Financial support promotes Israel's myths 
### 
r Shortly after the massacre of Palestinian refugees
• in Beirut in September, 400,000 Israelies demon
j strated in the streets of Tel Aviv demanding the res
: ignation of Prime Minister Menachem Begin and
i Defense Minister Ariel Sharon. There was no ques
tion that the Begin government was deeply im
: plicated in the killing. The Israelis had allowed
■ right-wing militias to the refugee camps; the militias
: had been trained and equipped by Israel; the killing
• was done within view of Israeli observation posts
j and bv the light of Israeli flares; and for a day and a
. half Israeli officials knew that a massacre was taking
- place but did nothing to stop it.
While Israeli citizens were responding with horror
; to the atrocity, Congress was quietly voting to in
crease U.S. aid to the Begin government next year by
$310 million. This is over and above what we already
send Israel — the equivalent of $750 a year for every
» Israeli man, woman and child.
; Suppose any other country had invaded a neigh
! boring country, using a blatantly false excuse. Sup
pose the assault caused at least 10,000 civilian deaths
and devastated whole towns and villages, leaving
60,000 people without any shelter. Suppose the in
i vader had used the most sophisticated bombs avail
able to level part of a major city, killing hundreds of
! civilians in every attack. Could the United States
J have rewarded the aggressor with more aid without
J provoking an outcry from the American people?
; The reason there was no outcry in the case of aid to
{ Israel is that most of us accept the myths generated
J by the Israeli government and its supporters.
The current myth is that Israel's invasion of Leba
| non was a defensive action against PLO terrorism.
• Israel's intervention in Lebanon began in the 19505,
! when Israelis made contacts with Lebanese Chris
! tians who were fearful of losing power to the grow
ing Moslem majority. In 1954 former Prime Min
ister Moshe Sharrett reported in his diaries that
! prominent Israeli officials had proposed setting up a
! friendly Christian regime in Lebanon. According to
! Sharrett, thev believed that "the only thing that's
! necessary is to find an officer, even just a major. We
J should either win his heart or buy him with money to
{.make him agree to declare himself the savior of the
; Maronite population. Then the Israeli army will

enter Lebanon, will occupy the necessary territory,
and will create a Christian regime which will ally
itself with Israel."
At that time Israel was not threatened by Palesti
nian attacks from Lebanon. But Sharrett had also
reported, on October 26, 1953, that "the Army is
planning war in order to occupy the rest of Eretz Is
rael." In order to win, and hold, the extended terri
tory, Israel had to neutralize Lebanon.
The chance came in 1975, when right-wing
Phalangists ambushed a busload of Palestinians in
Beirut to set off the Lebanese civil war. Israel backed
the Phalangists with arms, military advisers and
training — altogether $100 million worth of aid. Is
raeli support continued even after the Phalangists
massacred thousands of Palestinians at the Tal
Zataar refugee camp in the summer of 1976.
The following summer The New York Times re
ported that Israeli-backed militias had launched a
major attack in southern Lebanon with the aim of
disrupting a ceasefire agreement between Syria,
Lebanon and the PLO that called for the withdrawl
of PLO forces from the area and their replacement
by regular Lebanese troops. This was only one of
many ceasefires that were deliberately broken by Is
rael's right-wing clients in order to keep Lebanon
divided. In 1978 Israel set up its own surrogate army
in southern Lebanon, which it is now refusing to re
move. The army is commanded by Major Saad Had
dad, a Lebanese Christian. The area it occupies has
become virtually a part of Israel.
PLO attacks from Lebanon have killed 106 Israel
is since 1967, according to the newspaper Ha'aretz.
Israeli bombing in retaliation has killed thousands
of Lebanese and Palestinians, and made parts of
southern Lebanon a wasteland. Although PLO
border attacks ended by 1979, Israel continued its
"preemptive strikes," which Ha'aretz s military cor
respondent described as "massive fire from afar, by
land, sea, and air." In July 1981, Israeli bombing
killed at least 500 Lebanese and Palestinians in one
month. PLO rocket attacks in retaliation killed sev
en Israelis. A U.S.-arranged ceasefire followed this
exchange. The PLO observed the ceasefire until last
May when Israel claimed falsely that the PLO had
shot the Israeli ambassador to London. In "repris

al," Israel launched a massive bombing attack and
then swept across the border in a long-planned in
vasion. Israel's "defensive" war ravaged London
and caused tens of thousands of casualties. As a re
sult, Israel is no more secure than before, but it has
effectively extended its borders into yet another
country.
Israel's actions in Lebanon have been central to
its goal of occupying all of what was once Palestine
and suppressing effective opposition from the
Palestinians or their allies. At the same time, most
Americans continue to believe that Israel is a
beleaguered state, struggling only to live in peace.
What happened in Lebanon should have exploded
this myth once and for all.
The nightmare in the Beirut refugee camps last
September was not the first of its kind. Like the
massacres at Dir Yassin in 1948, at Qibya in 1953, at
Kafr Kasem in 1956, at Tal Zataar in 1976, it was
intended to terrorize the Palestinians into flight or
into submission. The half-milliow Palestinians left in
Lebanon can't be sure it won't happen again. At
least 15,000 Palestinian men are in Israeli prison
camps, denied all rights as prisoners of war. Their
families don't know whether they are alive or dead;
they have nowhere to turn for help.
Palestinians will be safe from further acts of terror
only when they find refuge in a homeland of their
own. The Jews of Europe desperately needed such a
refuge and found it. But in building a new state they
produced a new set of victims.
Israeli leaders and their supporters insist that a
Palestinian homeland would mean Israel's destruc
tion. This is the greatest misconception of all.
Sooner or later Israel will have to recognize the
Palestinians' right to live in security and dignity in
part of the land both peoples claim. Otherwise, no
matter how many weapons the United States sends
Israel, no matter how many orgies of killing take
place, Israel will survive only as an armed camp,
ready to make war but without a moral center and
with all its dreams abandoned. This would mean the
true destruction of Israel.

What happened in Lebanon should have exploded
this myth once and for all.
The nightmare in the Beirut refugee camps last
September was not the first of its kind. Like the
massacres at Dir Yassin in 1948, at Qibya in 1953, at
Kafr Kasem in 1956, at Tal Zataar in 1976, it was
intended to terrorize the Palestinians into flight or
into submission. The half-milliow Palestinians left in
Lebanon can't be sure it won't happen again. At
least 15,000 Palestinian men are in Israeli prison
camps, denied all rights as prisoners of war. Their
families don't know whether they are alive or dead;
they have nowhere to turn for help.
Palestinians will be safe from further acts of terror
only when they find refuge in a homeland of their
own. The Jews of Europe desperately needed such a
refuge and found it. But in building a new state they
produced a new set of victims.
Israeli leaders and their supporters insist that a
Palestinian homeland would mean Israel's destruc

Sooner or later Israel will have to recognize the
Palestinians' right to live in security and dignity in
part of the land both peoples claim. Otherwise, no
matter how many weapons the United States sends
Israel, no matter how many orgies of killing take
place, Israel will survive only as an armed camp,
ready to make war but without a moral center and
with all its dreams abandoned. This would mean the
true destruction of Israel.

J have rewarded the aggressor with more aid without
J provoking an outcry from the American people?

{ Israel is that most of us accept the myths generated
J by the Israeli government and its supporters.
The current myth is that Israel's invasion of Leba
| non was a defensive action against PLO terrorism.
• Israel's intervention in Lebanon began in the 19505,
! when Israelis made contacts with Lebanese Chris
! tians who were fearful of losing power to the grow
ing Moslem majority. In 1954 former Prime Min
ister Moshe Sharrett reported in his diaries that
! prominent Israeli officials had proposed setting up a
! friendly Christian regime in Lebanon. According to
! Sharrett, thev believed that "the only thing that's
! necessary is to find an officer, even just a major. We
J should either win his heart or buy him with money to
{.make him agree to declare himself the savior of the
; Maronite population. Then the Israeli army will

enter Lebanon, will occupy the necessary territory,
and will create a Christian regime which will ally
itself with Israel."
At that time Israel was not threatened by Palesti
nian attacks from Lebanon. But Sharrett had also
reported, on October 26, 1953, that "the Army is
planning war in order to occupy the rest of Eretz Is
rael." In order to win, and hold, the extended terri
tory, Israel had to neutralize Lebanon.
The chance came in 1975, when right-wing
Phalangists ambushed a busload of Palestinians in
Beirut to set off the Lebanese civil war. Israel backed
the Phalangists with arms, military advisers and
training — altogether $100 million worth of aid. Is
raeli support continued even after the Phalangists
massacred thousands of Palestinians at the Tal
Zataar refugee camp in the summer of 1976.
The following summer The New York Times re
ported that Israeli-backed militias had launched a
major attack in southern Lebanon with the aim of
disrupting a ceasefire agreement between Syria,
Lebanon and the PLO that called for the withdrawl
of PLO forces from the area and their replacement
by regular Lebanese troops. This was only one of
many ceasefires that were deliberately broken by Is
rael's right-wing clients in order to keep Lebanon
divided. In 1978 Israel set up its own surrogate army
in southern Lebanon, which it is now refusing to re
move. The army is commanded by Major Saad Had
dad, a Lebanese Christian. The area it occupies has
become virtually a part of Israel.
PLO attacks from Lebanon have killed 106 Israel
is since 1967, according to the newspaper Ha'aretz.
Israeli bombing in retaliation has killed thousands
of Lebanese and Palestinians, and made parts of
southern Lebanon a wasteland. Although PLO
border attacks ended by 1979, Israel continued its
"preemptive strikes," which Ha'aretz s military cor
respondent described as "massive fire from afar, by
land, sea, and air." In July 1981, Israeli bombing
killed at least 500 Lebanese and Palestinians in one
month. PLO rocket attacks in retaliation killed sev
en Israelis. A U.S.-arranged ceasefire followed this
exchange. The PLO observed the ceasefire until last
May when Israel claimed falsely that the PLO had
shot the Israeli ambassador to London. In "repris
