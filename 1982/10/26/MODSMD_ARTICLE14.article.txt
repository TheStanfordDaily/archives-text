## Cliveden isn't quite the playground editorial makes it out to be 
### 
I would like to voice strenuous objec
tions to your editorial entitled "Closing
Cliveden Playground," (Daily, Oct. 21).
Very few of the Daily's criticisms of
Cliveden seem to be based on fact. The
Daily is accurate in one statement how*
ever. My two quarters at Cliveden (win
ter and spring, 1982) have definitely
been the highlight of my Stanford ex
perience.
The Daily begins by chiding the aca
; demies, referring to them as "token aca
demic pressures." Sure, Stanford in
Britain is easier than Stanford in Cali
fornia, but this has nothing to do with
Cliveden itself, or its location. Cliveden

is run bv an academic staff which does
nothing but perpetuate a system of one
dav-a-week classes, and British instruc
tors who would just as soon hand out all
good marks to avoid controversy. The
Daily also seems to misunderstand an
important point about Cliveden.
Though it is easier, Cliveden provides
an outlet for often rigorous academics
at home, and lets a student relax a little
for a quarter or two. Is that so wrong?
The Daily also insists students choose
the basement pub over roaming the es
tate. How often do most people wander
around dark woods from 9 p.m. to I
a.m. (the pub's hours) anyway? Too

often (during daylight hours) I saw stu
dents making use of all of Cliveden's
beautiful 300 acres to accept this ridicu
lous generalization.
In the two quarters I was there, I
didn't know a single student who didn't
frequently go to London on his own as
well as on weekly class field trips to
London's museums, art galleries and
theaters. Yet the Daily says "Even the
intrepid few who even occasionally take
advantage of what the city has to offer
Cliveden is not being directly sub
sidized by the other campuses. The Uni
versity itself funds the overseas cam

puses. Of the 5600 per quarter we payed
for board, the University allotted
Cliveden 93 pence per person, per day,
according to Assistant Director Pamela
Murray. So who's subsidizing who?
If the writers of the editorial have
studied at Cliveden I'm very surprised
to hear their opinions. If they haven't
they have no business writing it.
I urge any student who has the op
portunity to go to Cliveden to do so
before a beautiful place is no longer
available.
