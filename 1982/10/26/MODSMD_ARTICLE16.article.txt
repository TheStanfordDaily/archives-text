## Chair abuse (gasp) abounds here 
### 
Chair, n. — seat, especially designed
to accomodate one person, usually con
sisting of legs and having a rest for the
back.
Chair Abuse, 1. — relating to the mis
treatment of chairs 2. a most heinous
crime.
Chair abuse, a uniquely American
phenomenon, is clearly pervasive at
Stanford. Some people, as difficult as it
may be to believe, still think that chair
abuse is a laughing matter. I, on the oth
er hand, am seriously concerned about
it.
To help outline some of the critical
aspects of this issue I find it necessary to
bring up some of the gruesome ex
amples of chair abuse. The more
squeamish among you may choose not
to look further — indeed, the clari
fication of the brutal truth may be com
ing right after breakfast.
First of all, it is important to differen
tiate among individual varieties of
chairs. The one 1 will cite in many of my

examples is a large, olive-green, com
fortable, slightly worn and ragged, ex
ecutive-type office chair. Many crimes
have been committed against this chair
of varying severity in only the past few
weeks.
Example one: the unbolting the chair
technique. Only effective with chairs
bolted together. Effect: chair collapses
as someone leans or sits on it. Side ef
fects: blisters from bolting chair back
together again.
Example two: the stick-the-chair
t wo-1 hi rds-the-way-out-the-window
technique. Even worse: the stick-the
chair-two-thirds-the-way-out-the-win-
dow-and-close-the-shades variation.
Also works with other objects. Not as
original. Violators frequently of a less
terroristic nature. Often done by room
mates after they fail chemistry 31
midterms.
Example three: the shower room
scenario. The special technique of kid
napping chairs and placing them in
shower rooms. Turning on the water
occasionally follows.
Example four: chaining chair to bike
rack technique. Involves chaining chair
to bike rack. Notorious offenders wait
for bad weather.
Example five: the lynching tech

nique. Involves dangling a chair from
the second or third floor balcony. Ef
fect: upsets acrophobic chairs. Side ef
fects: dangerous for owner to retrive
chair. Occasionally leads to injury.
So, one may wonder, how does on
deal with chair abusers? This is a dif
ficult question with different answers
for different people. One option is abus
ing the abuser's chair, but that only
makes things worse. Of course, another
option is abusing the abuser.
There are many options when it
comes to retaliating over chair abuse.
These methods deter repeat offenders
and often are more effective than the
preventive measures. Preventive meas
ures, in fact, often restrict the chair's
potential and carry adverse side effects.
Such methods include chaining chairs
to a wall or locking them in a closet.
In matters of great relevance there
are rarely simple answers. This case is
no exception. So, if you have a problem
concerning chair abuse feel free to write
me at: The Committee for the Preven
tion of Cruelty toward Chairs, Mark
Soble, Chairman, Box 3381, Stanford,
CA 94305.
