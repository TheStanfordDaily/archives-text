# Swahili? How about Gregorian chant?
## 
### CHRISTIE WOOD 
In a university of Stanford'! size and diversity, it
seems curious that so many study lists are surpris
ingly similar. Everyone is familiar with those stu
dents: the biology and chemistry pre-med students;
hopelul engineers who stick to physics and calculus;
the usual economics, stastistics, computer science
die-hards, and even faithful followers of political
science, psychology and art history.
I hen there are the four students now enrolled in
beginning Swahili; the seven music majors studying
(iregorian chant; a handful discovering sculpture in
I igure and Non-Figure Construction in Various
Materials"; and 10 who occupy Friday afternoons
researching the Maya hieroglyphic writing.
there are also the three, or possibly four, stu
dents who will register for Old Church Slavic, not to
mention more than 30 practicing the fundamental
aerodynamics of throwing the frisbee.
Despite Stanford's celebrated "pre-professional"
academic nature, there are a number of excellent re
sources available for students interested in pursuing
subjects outside the traditional academic scope.
Nineteen years ago, a doctoral student of Stan
lord's Music Department became involved with the
choir at St. Anne's Catholic Church in Palo Alto —
one of only half a dozen churches in the United
States which still performs the Gregorian chants. A
year later he became director of that choir, and cur
rently, he is an associate professdr of music here.
Hill Mahrt now leaches the Gregorian chant in his
music theory and history classes, as well as in a sep
arate class for students who study the Gregorian
chant intensively.
"The chants are sung in Latin, the language of the
old monasteries, and reflect an attitude that looks
to the ancient traditions of the church: quiet medi
tation and religious commitment," Mahrt said. "As
an academic pursuit, the Gregorian chant is not so
unusual. It is a subject of a good deal of musical re
search among scholars."
Another unusual subject is the Bantu language
Swahili, the principal spoken language of East
Africa. It is taught by graduate students to both be
ginning and intermediate classes at Stanford.
"Learning Swahili is essential for anyone who
plans to explore African culture," said sophomore
Angie Walker. "For me, it is a real connection to
my past heritage. Not like the German or French
that's thrown at you in high school."
The majority of Stanford's Swahili students are
studying the language as practical preparation for
further exploration of the African culture: research
and travel in Tanzania.
"It is a very conversation-oriented class," said
Walker. "Everyone learns to really speak the lan
guage. Swahili is actually very straightforward,"
WaTker added, "Once you understand the vowels,
just-remember that everything is spelled the way it
sounds."
"The most popular of the more unusual subjects
offered by the University is the frisbee class, part of
the lifetime activity division of the Athletic Depart
ment. According to instructor Tom Mcßann, a pre
vious world frisbee champion and Guinness record
holder, "Frisbee is the second most popular leisure
sport activity on campus (tennis is first); we have
many more students sign up each quarter than we
can possibly accomodate." Mcßann's official title
is director of frisbee.

"Stanford is one of very few colleges to offer
frisbee for credit," Mcßann continued.
Official interest in frisbee at Stanford began sev
eral years ago with an instruction program spon
sored by the Bridge. Since then, frisbee has been of
fered as part of the ASSU's "special classes," and
incorporated into both University intramural and
club sports.
The syllabus for frisbee explains that students
will learn the history and evolution of frisbee; fun
damental of throws and catches; specific skills, style
and technique; rules and strategies for games and
events; and anatomy and aerodynamics of the
frisbee. Like most athletic classes, frisbee supplies
one unit of credit.
Old Church Slavic is something of an ancient
form of Russian, probably comparable to Latin's
relation to modern Italian. Actually, the language
was originally created to translate biblical writings
for the Slavs — inhabitants of middle and eastern
Europe. Today, it is a necessary tool for students of
Russian culture, and particularly of old Russian lit
erature.
Professor Joseph VanCampen, Stanford's resi
dent authority on Old Church Slavic, teaches the
class approximately every two years. He first taught
at Harvard in 1962, and then came to Stanford in
1966. According to Van Campen, between three
and five students will typically enroll in the class.
Another class with a similar size enrollment, usu
ally about five students a quarter, is offered by the
Art Department. But "Figure and Non-Figure
Construction in Various Materials" is unique in its
treatment of sculpture and the purposes of artistic
expression.
"It is as completely different form of sculpture
than, say, clay modeling," said David Kuechle, a
student who completed the course last spring. "The
students practically use debris in their construc
tions, but space is the real medium being manipu
lated."
The course is based on principles of structuralism
and constructivism, specifically, the artistic ex
pression adopted by the lower classes to rebel
against the grandiose architecture of the elite during
the Romantic period.
While most of the University seizes the op
portunity for a break from the week's academics
each Friday afternoon, 10 students and a professor
of anthropology gather for a four-hour class ses
sion. Some are Stanford undergraduates and gradu
ates, some travel from U.C. Berkeley, a few are just
scattered around the Bay Area. They are all in
terested in Maya hieroglyphic writing.
James Fox, assistant professor of anthropology,
and an expert in Pre-Columbian hieroglyphics,
teaches the class only once about every four years.
"Obviously the course is very specialized, very
archeology oriented," Fox said. "Courses like this
are taught in only a couple of universities in the
country, notably Harvard, Yale, Stanford, the Uni
versity of Pennsylvania and the University of Tex
as."
This quarter, students in the class, whose majors
range from anthropology and archeology to engi
neering, are concentrating on deciphering Mayan
books from the 13th century A.D. These Mayan
writings combine pictorial and phonetic symbols
and are especially important for the observations of
astronomy and science.
