# Ansel Adams and Wallace Stegner speak in Mem Aud

### MIKE HALE Senior staff writer 
Photographer Ansel Adams and writer
Wallace Stegner, calling themselves "a
couple of Afghans in the hills" fighting ex
ploiters of the environment, talked in Me
morial Auditorium Sunday afternoon
about their opposition to what Stegner
called "the peculiarly American belief that
the earth is here for our exploitation."
Their "conversation" was co-sponsored
bv the Associates of the Stanford Univer
sity Libraries and the Committee for Art
at Stanford and filled the orchestra section
of Mem Aud, desite parking problems
caused by the Kenny Loggins concert next
door in Frost Amphitheater. Moderator
Frank Novak of the library associates sug
gested the audience pretend it was in
Adams' living room in Carmel listening in
â€” Adams' habit of reading from a script
made such suspension of disbelief dif
ficult, but it didn't hinder the dialogue be
cause the two agreed on almost ev
erything.
Stegner, a professor of English here for
more than 20 years, first director of the
Stanford Creative Writing Program, and
as a novelist winner of the Pulitzer Prize
and the National Book Award, began the
conversation with a short tribute to
Adams whom he called "by many esti
mates the greatest photographer in the
world." He distinguished Adams from
"those of us who are world-famous all
over Palo Alto; he's world-famous all over
the world."
Stegner then posed a series of questions
about photography, asking Adams about
styles in the photographic world, his fa
mous composer/performer analogy for
the photographic process, and the issue of
further prints of Adams's trademark im
ages. Adams' answers were rather per
functory, and the program didn't pick up
steam until the two began to discuss the
policies of, in Stegner's words, "James
Watt and other abominations in high of
fice."

Adams began by making a distinction
between the "conservationist," which he
used to be, and the "environmentalist,"
which includes the earlier category and
which he "would rather be now." He said
conservationism was a more passive ac
tivity, concerned mainly with preserving
parklands; environmentalist!! is "a total
dedication" to Adams, a struggle for "a
state of harmony between man and
earth."
Adams said a more active stance was
necessary now because government lead
ers "are so intolerably smug and con
vinced of the Tightness of their policies,
they just smile at" environmentalists.
Stegner, asked whether he agreed that a
new approach is needed, acknowledged
that the environmental movement had
passed from a concern for preserving
beauty to a "battle for survival." Stegner

concentrated throughout the program on
the responsibility of the artist to com
municate his fears to the public, but com
plained that "you can't depend on the
democratic public to be anything but 75
percent slobs." Admitting this view was
"snobbish," Stegner nevertheless charac
terized Americans as "addicted to noise
and mindless satisfaction" and unrecep
tive to the environmental message.
Adams was a little softer on his coun
trymen, saying the typical American fami
ly now has little time for anything but sur
vival and that to them, environmentalism
embodies "ideal or sometimes abstract
concepts."
Stegner contrasted the situations in
America and Europe, saying "everything
is worse off" here. He cited 18th-and 19th
century American industrial and business
habits that brought about the present
crisis, and said "the present adminis
tration operates by that old, destructive
American initiative."
Stegner and Adams disagreed slightly
on the relation of their artistic practice to
their propagandizing. Adams called
himself an "automatic propagandist,"
and said he had never made a photograph
intentionally for propaganda purposes.
He contrasted himself with artists "im
mersed in creating their own symbols"
who present nature "wrapped in
polyethylene," saying his concern for the
natural scene led him to develop new per
ceptions of nature. This creative in
terpretation of nature, he said, is the re
spousibility of the ar
tist/environmentalist.
Stegner, on the other hand, said he can
not combine his fiction-writing and prop
aganda activities. He admitted, though,
that "ultimately, a lot of our political re
sponses are esthetic at base," and said
"someone who can't be awed (by nature)
is not likely to be very careful" with it.
"Those who can be, and most can be if
they let themselves, will be careful," he
concluded.
