# Refund rate high, but less than expected
## 
### STEVE TROUSDALE Staff writer 
Students collected a large proportion
of ASSU fee assessment funds last
week, although not at the record pace
set in the first half of the two-week re
bate period.
At the end of the first week of refunds
Student Financial Manager Bob Brody
projected that the average amount each
group would lose would be approx
imately 39 percent of its fee assessment.
At the end of last week, the final week
for refunds, the highest percentage re
turned was the 25 percent lost by the
Stanford Progressive Alliance (SPA).
Although this figure represents a large
portion of the student body, substan
tially fewer students collected refunds
this quarter than last winter quarter,
when the overall average was 42.4 per
cent.
However, this "good news" still ad
versely affected the budgets tyf several
of the 12 student groups that received
assessments.
SPA was hardest hit, losing $3200.
However, some members of the group
saw a sort of victory in this. Larry Aus
ubel, a graduate senator and a member
of the group, said that "if the program
fee, which represents the widest variety
of groups on campus, lost 24 percent
and we lost 25, I think we did pretty
damn well."
Craig Richards, another member of
the organization, commented that
"there are some people who feel that
politically they can't support SPA" but
added that "I feel sad that people are so
threatened by programs that emphasize
minority rights and Third World prob
lems like SPA."
Richards also said that since the
group was just in the process of forming
a budget the loss would only affect their
plans in that "with less money we'll be
able to do less."
The Publications Board, which had
expected about 15 percent of its funds
to be reclaimed, instead lost about 24
percent, according to Doug Fine, chair
man of the board. Because this repre
sents almost $3100, he said his or
ganization, which funds various stu
dent publications on campus, would
have to change its budgetary plans in
light of the higher rate of fee refunds.
Asked why his organization suffered

this large financial loss, Fine said: "I'm
not sure students are sure what their
dollars are for," and said "now that I
see what happened I think we're going
to have to publicize it (the Pub Board)
more."
Another student group, the Program
Board, which disperses funds to many
small groups and lost approximately 24
percent of its assessment, was some
what better prepared for the shortfall.
Peter Spivack, who heads the board,
said, "I thought it (the refund) would be
much higher" because, as he said,
"most people don't know .. . what the
program fee is for and thus I think it's
perfectly natural that we have one of the
highest rates of return."
Despite this loss he said that the Pro
gram Board would be able to expand its
budget because the board had esti
mated in its original financial plan that
it would lose approximately 40 percent
of its $12,500 assessment. ,
In past quarters the ASSU Legal
Counseling Office-has been one of the
least affected groups because students
who collect their $1 assessment from
this group lose their right to legal coun
seling for that quarter. Even last winter
quarter, when many groups were ex
tremely hard hit by fee refunds, this
program lost only 16.1 percent of its
assessment, or approximately $1900.
This quarter, not suprisingly, the
program again lost the least amount of
any group, 9 percent, or $ 1200. Cynthia
Mathewson, chairman of the board of
this group and a member of the council
of presidents, expressed no suprise at
the figures, saying "that's about what
we expected."
This fee assessment referendum was
held under a system whereby any mem
ber of the ASSU — any registered stu
dent — could obtain a refund. How
ever, beginning next spring quarter a
new system will be instituted under
which only members of the ASSU who
voted in the fee assessment election, or
new members, could obtain refunds.
Also, there will be two types of fees, one
$3 fee for the Academic Organizations
Board, the Pub Board and the Program
Board, and a different fee for other stu
dent groups. This special fee would re
quire prospective student groups to
meet certain requirements set by the
student financial manager and the sen
ate in order to be placed on the ballot.

group would lose would be approx
imately 39 percent of its fee assessment.
At the end of last week, the final week
for refunds, the highest percentage re
turned was the 25 percent lost by the
Stanford Progressive Alliance (SPA).
Although this figure represents a large
portion of the student body, substan
tially fewer students collected refunds
this quarter than last winter quarter,
when the overall average was 42.4 per
cent.
However, this "good news" still ad
versely affected the budgets tyf several
of the 12 student groups that received
assessments.
SPA was hardest hit, losing $3200.
However, some members of the group
saw a sort of victory in this. Larry Aus
ubel, a graduate senator and a member
of the group, said that "if the program
fee, which represents the widest variety
of groups on campus, lost 24 percent
and we lost 25, I think we did pretty
damn well."
Craig Richards, another member of
the organization, commented that
"there are some people who feel that
politically they can't support SPA" but
added that "I feel sad that people are so
threatened by programs that emphasize
minority rights and Third World prob
lems like SPA."
Richards also said that since the
group was just in the process of forming
a budget the loss would only affect their
plans in that "with less money we'll be
able to do less."
The Publications Board, which had
expected about 15 percent of its funds
to be reclaimed, instead lost about 24
percent, according to Doug Fine, chair
man of the board. Because this repre
sents almost $3100, he said his or
ganization, which funds various stu
dent publications on campus, would
have to change its budgetary plans in
light of the higher rate of fee refunds.
Asked why his organization suffered

this large financial loss, Fine said: "I'm
not sure students are sure what their
dollars are for," and said "now that I
see what happened I think we're going
to have to publicize it (the Pub Board)
more."
Another student group, the Program
Board, which disperses funds to many
small groups and lost approximately 24
percent of its assessment, was some
what better prepared for the shortfall.
Peter Spivack, who heads the board,
said, "I thought it (the refund) would be
much higher" because, as he said,
"most people don't know .. . what the
program fee is for and thus I think it's
perfectly natural that we have one of the
highest rates of return."
Despite this loss he said that the Pro
gram Board would be able to expand its
budget because the board had esti
mated in its original financial plan that
it would lose approximately 40 percent
of its $12,500 assessment. ,
In past quarters the ASSU Legal
Counseling Office-has been one of the
least affected groups because students
who collect their $1 assessment from
this group lose their right to legal coun
seling for that quarter. Even last winter
quarter, when many groups were ex
tremely hard hit by fee refunds, this
program lost only 16.1 percent of its
assessment, or approximately $1900.
This quarter, not suprisingly, the
program again lost the least amount of
any group, 9 percent, or $ 1200. Cynthia
Mathewson, chairman of the board of
this group and a member of the council
of presidents, expressed no suprise at
the figures, saying "that's about what
we expected."
This fee assessment referendum was
held under a system whereby any mem
ber of the ASSU — any registered stu
dent — could obtain a refund. How
ever, beginning next spring quarter a
new system will be instituted under
which only members of the ASSU who
voted in the fee assessment election, or
new members, could obtain refunds.
Also, there will be two types of fees, one
$3 fee for the Academic Organizations
Board, the Pub Board and the Program
Board, and a different fee for other stu
dent groups. This special fee would re
quire prospective student groups to
meet certain requirements set by the
student financial manager and the sen
ate in order to be placed on the ballot.
Students collected a large proportion
of ASSU fee assessment funds last
week, although not at the record pace
set in the first half of the two-week re
bate period.
At the end of the first week of refunds
Student Financial Manager Bob Brody
projected that the average amount each
group would lose would be approx
imately 39 percent of its fee assessment.
