The Plimsouls
Frost Amphitheatre .
Sunday, October 24
Life just ain't that easy for an
up-and-coming band these days,
especially if that band has been
"up-and-coming" for about five
years. Consider the Plimsouls.
They started out in 1977, about
•the same time as the Go-Go's,
*th6' Knack, the Beat, the Pop,
20/20, and a million and one
other bands trying to break out
of LA and into the pages of Tiger
Beat. A couple of those bands
made it; most grabbed a record
contract, tossed out a single, and
went back home to the land of
the has-been and the home of the
never-was. Sort of an American
Dream for modern times, eh?
The Plimsouls, by contrast,
have been around for a long time
with no personnel changes, a few
records and a lot of club dates.
And in this case, it seems that
slow and steady might win the
race; the Plimsouls, still playing a
catchy blend of'60s pop and '80s
cynicism, are now one of the rec
ognized "cool" bands in LA, sel
ling out club shows regularly and
gaining instant credibility with a
guest appearance by Tom Petty
(who still plays a catchy blend of
'60s pop and '80s ennui and sells
millions of records) at their re
cent show at the Whisky a Go Go
down south.
Even so, things are far from
easy. While Kenny Loggins re
laxed in his customized bus Sun
day, waiting to hop onstage for
his first show in two weeks, the
Plimsouls careened down from
San Francisco in a van, trying to
cram four shows into a five-day
Bay Area adventure, including a

headlining appearance last Fri
day at the Old Waldorf and a
brief opening-act stint for Log
gins Sunday in Frost Am
phitheatre.
Playing as an opening act has
special disadvantages, most of
them unnoticed by your average
homogeneous throng assembled
for a given concert. For one
thing, said throng has shelled out
double-digit dollars for the
privilege of seeing someone else,
not you — resulting in a lot of
discomfort when you're used to
playing at the top of a bill for a
far smaller audience. Which
brings us back to the Plimsouls.
Peter Case, guitarist and lead
singer for the Plimsouls, likes the
idea of playing for different au
diences and trying to cross over
to arena-rock crowds. What's
more, he puts it bluntly: "We're
getting out of town for a while."
Bassist David Pahaho agrees.
"It's good for us to open up to a

new audience and work. You get
to the point — well, the night we
played the Whisky, Petty came
up and played three songs, and
we played really tight, but..."
But. The crowd response at
the Frost show was polite — ex
cruciatingly polite. No one was
throwing things, which is good;
no one was dancing, whith is
bad. But people did hear the
Plimsouls, and the show (by the
standards rock critics use to
judge such things) was pretty
good. And if a couple of folks go
out and buy records or some
thing, then the Plimsouls can
consider their Stanford visit a
success. "But I'll tell you some
thing," adds Pahaho in a last
word as the band prepared to
head back south. "If we had
walked out and had beards, we
would've donelietter."

gins Sunday in Frost Am
phitheatre.
Playing as an opening act has
special disadvantages, most of
them unnoticed by your average
homogeneous throng assembled
for a given concert. For one
thing, said throng has shelled out
double-digit dollars for the
privilege of seeing someone else,
not you — resulting in a lot of
discomfort when you're used to
playing at the top of a bill for a
far smaller audience. Which
brings us back to the Plimsouls.
Peter Case, guitarist and lead
singer for the Plimsouls, likes the
idea of playing for different au
diences and trying to cross over
to arena-rock crowds. What's
more, he puts it bluntly: "We're
getting out of town for a while."
Bassist David Pahaho agrees.
"It's good for us to open up to a

new audience and work. You get
to the point — well, the night we
played the Whisky, Petty came
up and played three songs, and
we played really tight, but..."
But. The crowd response at
the Frost show was polite — ex
cruciatingly polite. No one was
throwing things, which is good;
no one was dancing, whith is
bad. But people did hear the
Plimsouls, and the show (by the
standards rock critics use to
judge such things) was pretty
good. And if a couple of folks go
out and buy records or some
thing, then the Plimsouls can
consider their Stanford visit a
success. "But I'll tell you some
thing," adds Pahaho in a last
word as the band prepared to
head back south. "If we had
walked out and had beards, we
would've donelietter."
