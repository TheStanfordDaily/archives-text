Kenny Loggins
Frost Amphitheatre
Sunday, October 24
Thank God for second impres
sions.
For those judging Kenny Log
gins after his first few songs Sun
day afternoon at Frost Am
phitheatre, their first impres
sions of the singei/hiusiciaiyfcong
writer might probably have gone
something like this: 'Oh no,
Loggins has changed. I'm about
to waste 10-plus bucks watching
some hyped—out guy jump
around stage for two hours. And
his clothes. Jeez, that pink-and
black-striped shirt, those tight
green pants and those shoes that
look like Converse All-Stars
spray-painted silver just isn't the
Kenny Loggins I've come to
know and love. And these songs,
they're a far cry from Loggins
and Messina's Frost show circa
1974."
But those people just had to
give the guy a chance. It was only
a matter of time before those
first impressions were put to pas
ture in the back-40 of the mind
and second, more finalized, im
pressions took over.
Sure, Loggins went for the
New Wave look Sunday, and he
did hop around stage like on a
pogo stick, but somehow the per
sonal contact between the man,
his voice and each of the 7500 in
the crowd poked its head above
the outfit and the antics. The
man is personable, his voice is
smooth and clear, and the audi
ence leaves satisfied.
The turnaround from the
pseudo-Loggins of songs one,
two and three to the real Loggins
of the rest of the concert came
during a 10-minute stint featur
ing Loggins without his five-man
| back-up band, but with a 12-
| string guitar and a lot of emotion.
The brown-haired, bearded
Loggins sat in a chair and "re
minisced" with a crowd under
darkening skies.
On this particular Sunday,

things were a bit different for
Loggins. After the show he ad
mitted that playing in front of a
daytime audience where he
could see all the crowd faces is a
vastly different experience than
performing in dark concert halls
at night.
Nevertheless, Loggins estab
lished the same or better contact
with the predominantly non-
Stanford audience during the
acoustic portion of the show,
switching from song to song
(most of them oldies he didn't
write) and stopping momentarily
to tell a joke or a story. Included
in this mini-set was a song writ
ten by Loggins for his son, with
keyboardist Neil Larsen accom
panying the vocalist.
Finished with his reminiscing,
Loggins, this time equipped with
band, broke into "This Is It,"
one of his most popular tunes to
date. And for the first time all
afternoon, the 7500 were on
their feet, clapping and dancing.
Loggins and Co. followed it with
"I Gotta Try," a song he co
wrote with former Doobie
Brother Michael McDonald that
appears on McDonald's debut
solo LP, If That's What it Takes.
Which brings up an interesting
point. McDonald and Loggins
have worked together through
out the years and co-composed
several tunes, the most famous of
which is "What a Fool Believes."
Together, they are a perfect
vocal duo, with Loggins' high
and clear voice combined with
McDonald's low and muffled
tone forming a very listenable
harmony. Maybe a combined
forces LP in the future? With
McDonald released from his
duties with the Doobs, many
signs point to it.
Loggins himself is not a superb
musician, but he never claims or
even acts like he is. As an acous
tic guitarist, Loggins is better
than adequate and plays with a
reasonable amount of emotion.
The electric instrument just
doesn't seem to be his bag of
tricks and consequently he only
plays rhythms and simple

melodie^wTthiL^
Nonetheless, Loggins' true
abilities lie in writing songs and
then singing them. With his out
going personality (he put on the
various hats and sunglasses that
were tossed up on stage and kis
sed bouquet givers) and smooth,
not too fast not too slow songs,
Loggins can gain control of an
audience and manipulate it into a
state of relaxation and enjoy
ment.
Loggins was surrounded by a
pair of fine musicians that made
up for any instrumental deficien
cies he might have. Keyboardist
Larsen and bassist Vernon Por
ter both put in time with Full
Moon, a jazz/rock group
founded by Larsen and guitar
session player Buzz Feiten. Lar
sen, wielding his ancient B-3 or
gan, and Porter, with his
popping/slapping bass
techniques, provided a solid

foundation over which Loggins
could lay his famous voice. Both
had riveting solos during the
concert that drew deserved ova
tions.
Guitarist Mike Hamilton,
donning Vuarnets, seemed the
most isolated man in the sextet.
Standing to Loggins' left, the
guitarist played fairly generic
solos, although he played them
at opportune times.
All in all, Loggins and his band
did what they were supposed to
do. The concert was no big event
— it wasn't the Who. It wasn't
even a go-out-to-a-concert con
cert. It was simply an innocent
afternoon in Frost.
And as awful or painfully
idealistic as it sounds to say
people came to have good, clean
fun, that's what people did. To
say otherwise just wouldn't be
telling it like it was.
