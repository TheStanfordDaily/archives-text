# The 						Bella Lewitzky Dance Company: curiosity as inspiration, choreography
## 
### CHRISTINA LEPNIS 
Curiosity, savs Bella Lewitzky,
is her primary choreographic in
spiration. As true curiosity has
no bounds, neither does
Lewitzky, the West Oast's lead
ing innovator and creative spirit
in modern dance as well as an ar
tist of both national and interna
tional reputation. After the Bella
Lewitzky Dance Company's
stunning Friday evening per
formance at Memorial
Auditorium there is little doubt
that Lewitzky is. like necessity, a
mother of invention.
The program opened with
"Changes and Choices," a bold,
witty piece with an electronic
score composed of chirping,
dripping and corkscrew-like
sounds. The white bodysuited 10-
member company illustrated the
joy of movement by springing,
turning, reaching, undulating
and exploring all levels of height
and directional shifts with a
nimble and risky abandon.
Groupings and pairings of com
pany members were in constant
flux, enhancing the overall sense
of the unexpected. Periodically, a
clothes line with brightly colored
accessories, such as red sleeves,
purple tanks and single yellow
g'jves were strung onstage to of
fer the dancers adornment. These
whimsical but well-integrated
pauses between episodes of
energetic motion, and indeed the
handling of the ritual of dressing
and undressing in itself, were ex
amples of Lewitzky's character

istic humor.
"Continuum," set to
Stravinsky's Duo Concertanl for
Piano and Violin and a premiere
work for the company, is a work
that artfully combines theme, im
age, musicality, compositional
variety and purity of movement.
It contains a fluid, lyrical duet,
two sprightly and sparkling
duets, a passionate solo and an
ensemble section of such charm
and temperamental mirth that
the camaraderie and intermittent
skips conjure visions of
schoolchildren at play. Moments
of silence occur throughout, as
do changes in mood and tempo,
yet the flow of motion never
stops and the transitions are
managed smoothly and (seem
ingly) effortlessly. Lewitzky's ti
tle reflects the elemental in
separability of the progressions
that build the compositon while
the dance implies a further
dimension. What one sees is a re
markably uninterrupted series of
diverse movement sequences. Al
though circumstances change,
the pulse never ceases and ev
erything is driven onward. The
ending is a coiled, communal em
brace which achieves at once a
final atmospheric warmth and a
culminating unity.
"Spaces Between," one of the
older repertory works, is a fine
example of Lewitzky's fusion of
the intellectual and the visually
mesmerizing. Set within a multi
toned design of largely blues and
greens and wearing shimmering

Lewitzky does not

kiness here to create
a non-human ef

abundant ideas pre
clude the need to use
recognizable stylis
tic devices.

bodysuits, the dancers appear to
be moving parts of machinery.
The accompaniment, an environ
mental score emitting electronic
bubbles, drones, beats and
screeches, reinforces the idea of
an automated environment.
Rather than depicting a transis
tor nightmare, however, it be
comes a lively, theatrical ex
perience devoid of any judgments
or conclusions Lewitzky might
choose to impose. (To guard
against placing such limitations
on the response of her audience,
Lewitzky purposely omits pro
gram notes.) The piecc begins
with diagonal and horizontal
crossings, entrances and exits,
proceeds to the use of plexiglass
sheets as props and surfaces to
support the dancers, and ends
with the enlarged projection of
moving bodies on the back
screen, roving lighting effects ex
pandinj? toinclude the

auditorium and a rash of activity.
In this visually arresting scene the
mechanical entity has been com
pletely activated. Lewitzky docs
not employ cliche jerkiness here
to create a non-human effect; in
stead, her abundant ideas pre
clude the need to use recog
nizable stylistic devices.
Throughout her carecr,
Lewitzky gradually formulated a
unique approach to dance, in
corporating her philosophy of
training and movement prin
ciples to constitute a basis for her
work. Her style is contemporary
without being trendy. Man
nerisms, deliberate ambiguities
and slickness are absent, whereas
an appealing freshness, humor
£nd highly reliable spontaneity
are always present. The crux is
ideas, and one wonders if
Lewitzky will ever run out of
them.

Lewitzky, the West Oast's lead
ing innovator and creative spirit
in modern dance as well as an ar
tist of both national and interna
tional reputation. After the Bella
Lewitzky Dance Company's
stunning Friday evening per
formance at Memorial
Auditorium there is little doubt
that Lewitzky is. like necessity, a
mother of invention.
The program opened with
"Changes and Choices," a bold,
witty piece with an electronic
score composed of chirping,
dripping and corkscrew-like
sounds. The white bodysuited 10-
member company illustrated the
joy of movement by springing,
turning, reaching, undulating
and exploring all levels of height
and directional shifts with a
nimble and risky abandon.
Groupings and pairings of com
pany members were in constant
flux, enhancing the overall sense
of the unexpected. Periodically, a
clothes line with brightly colored
accessories, such as red sleeves,
purple tanks and single yellow
g'jves were strung onstage to of
fer the dancers adornment. These
whimsical but well-integrated
pauses between episodes of
energetic motion, and indeed the
handling of the ritual of dressing
and undressing in itself, were ex
amples of Lewitzky's character

istic humor.
"Continuum," set to
Stravinsky's Duo Concertanl for
Piano and Violin and a premiere
work for the company, is a work
that artfully combines theme, im
age, musicality, compositional
variety and purity of movement.
It contains a fluid, lyrical duet,
two sprightly and sparkling
duets, a passionate solo and an
ensemble section of such charm
and temperamental mirth that
the camaraderie and intermittent
skips conjure visions of
schoolchildren at play. Moments
of silence occur throughout, as
do changes in mood and tempo,
yet the flow of motion never
stops and the transitions are
managed smoothly and (seem
ingly) effortlessly. Lewitzky's ti
tle reflects the elemental in
separability of the progressions
that build the compositon while
the dance implies a further
dimension. What one sees is a re
markably uninterrupted series of
diverse movement sequences. Al
though circumstances change,
the pulse never ceases and ev
erything is driven onward. The
ending is a coiled, communal em
brace which achieves at once a
final atmospheric warmth and a
culminating unity.
"Spaces Between," one of the
older repertory works, is a fine
example of Lewitzky's fusion of
the intellectual and the visually
mesmerizing. Set within a multi
toned design of largely blues and
greens and wearing shimmering

bodysuits, the dancers appear to
be moving parts of machinery.
The accompaniment, an environ
mental score emitting electronic
bubbles, drones, beats and
screeches, reinforces the idea of
an automated environment.
Rather than depicting a transis
tor nightmare, however, it be
comes a lively, theatrical ex
perience devoid of any judgments
or conclusions Lewitzky might
choose to impose. (To guard
against placing such limitations
on the response of her audience,
Lewitzky purposely omits pro
gram notes.) The piecc begins
with diagonal and horizontal
crossings, entrances and exits,
proceeds to the use of plexiglass
sheets as props and surfaces to
support the dancers, and ends
with the enlarged projection of
moving bodies on the back
screen, roving lighting effects ex
pandinj? toinclude the

auditorium and a rash of activity.
In this visually arresting scene the
mechanical entity has been com
pletely activated. Lewitzky docs
not employ cliche jerkiness here
to create a non-human effect; in
stead, her abundant ideas pre
clude the need to use recog
nizable stylistic devices.
Throughout her carecr,
Lewitzky gradually formulated a
unique approach to dance, in
corporating her philosophy of
training and movement prin
ciples to constitute a basis for her
work. Her style is contemporary
without being trendy. Man
nerisms, deliberate ambiguities
and slickness are absent, whereas
an appealing freshness, humor
£nd highly reliable spontaneity
are always present. The crux is
ideas, and one wonders if
Lewitzky will ever run out of
them.


Curiosity, savs Bella Lewitzky,
is her primary choreographic in
