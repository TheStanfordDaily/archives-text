# THE
						WHO
## One generation stays home, another one goes nuts 
### TONY KELLY 
I he Who
Oakland Coliseum
Saturday, October 25
In which the Who decide to
shut up and play.
Somewhere in the middle of
the Who's 25-song set last
Saturday, the final strains of
"Pinball Wizard" faded off into
the distance as the hand calmly
and deliberately slowed the
tempo. Uh huh, it looks like "See
Me, Feel Me" is looming on the
horizon as the Tommy segment
of the Who's retrospective
exhibit rolls into town.
But wait. Roger Daltrey, back
to the audience, is nodding his
head to an indecipherable ques
tion mouthed by Pete
Townshend. Townshend breaks
into a small, slightly wicked grin
in response to Daltrey's nod.
And within seconds, the opening
riff to "My Generation" is being
thrashed out onstage at the Oak
land Coliseum, and HO,OOO
people (according to the most
recent census) are going out of
their collective heads.
Y'see, the Who. and specifi
cally one Peter Townshend, have
been telling anyone who'll listen

(and that's one heck of a lot of
people) that the old boys have no
intention of playing "My Gener
ation" on their final tour. The
official reason is that the Who
are not playing to their genera
tion anymore; their generation
are the folks staying home and
watching TV while Skip and
Cindy borrow the car to
negotiate the wilds of Oakland.
But regardless of the genera
tion gap, and regardless of the
Who's seeming intransigence on
the issue, and regardless of the
fact that" My Generation" is not
quite an interesting song and cer
tainly not one of the symphonic
power-chord reveries that
Townshend is deservedly proud
of, the group played the song.
And it was good. Damn good.
And so was the concert and the
band and the opening act and the
weather. So there.
Alright, now I can back up a
little bit. I was a little bothered
with the big buildup to the Who's
fabled Last Tour, especially
when it became obvious early on
that there is a big difference in
the Who vocabulary between
Last Tour and Last Show. I
mean, no one finishes a Last
Tour on Halloween in Tempe,
Arizona. Not the Who, not the
Suicide Commandos, not any
one. And yet Rolling Stone puts
"The Who/The End" on the
cover, and interviews and arti
cles everywhere talk about what
a great 20 years it's been. It
hasn't been a great 20 years (re
member Face Dances'?)', it's been
20 years with a great rock band
that happens to be back around
the top.

Moreover, I was worried
about Pete Townshend. Word is
out that the reason this is the
Last Tour is because of Petey's
schizophrenic nature, that bet
ween acting out his role of rock
intellectual at home and power
chord Neanderthal onstage he
somehow lost track of himself.
And even though he's retiring
from touring in an effort to retain
his sanity, Townshend was just as
confusing as ever in his reasoning
about playing " My Generation."
He seemed to forget the fact that
said anthem is simply a terrific
rock song, and an outstanding
example of the "maximum R &
B" that is on all the old Who
buttons.
But not to worry. "My Gener
ation" came back out on the
track for a victory trot, and
though it didn't race as well as
before, the mere presence of it
lifted a lot of weights from the
shoulders of a lot of folks, both
onstage and in the audience.
In fact, the Who seemed to
hold the principle of playing of
primary importance throughout
the show. Again and again, from
the opening "Substitute" and"I
Can't Explain," through the
Tommy and Quadrophenia
drop-ins, and especially in the
encores of "Magic Bus" and
"Twist and Shout," one sensed
that the band was truly having
fun running through the usual
chord changes and performing in
the truest sense of the word.
There was an occasional mo
ment of ritual to the show, to be
sure. Daltrey's microphone
twirling in particular got pretty
aimless as the evening went on,
and roughly half of Townshend's
helicopter strums of his Telecas
ter were more for crowd benefit
than personal satisfaction. But
the other half — well, there's a
reason why some things in the
world are known as trademarks.
And if the flash-pot explosion in
"Won't Get Fooled Again"
seemed more a courteous bow to
past glories than a stunning re
minder, the ensuing guitar solo
made one forget the bombast
and remember the technique.
Besides, Townshend's mock

deafness after the song's end !
made the show worth the price of j
admission by itself.
Oh yeah, there were a couple ,
of opening acts — T-Bone Bur- •
nett stopped by for a cup of cof- •
fee, and the Clash had a donut.
(Not to slight either of them, but
the sets were pretty short). Bur- •
nett did a really interesting ver- .
sion of "Diamonds Are a Girl's '
Best Friend" that sounded like
Lou Reed playing "Sweet Jane" J
on a bad day. Despite his regula- I
tion new wave-skinny tie outfit
and his regulation new wave- j
skinny tie music, he only man- .
aged to get the audience's atten- »
tion when he was tossing !

stage.
You can bet your kid sister J
that if the Clash did anything ;
marginally incredible, I'd be »
writing about them from here !
back to the Coliseum. But they !
only played for 45 minutes in a !
set that had "accessibility" writ- J
ten all over it. Which is kinda }
unfortunate; playing before a»
crowd of 80,000 is a rare oppor- >

' WHO." The Clash made the |
choice of playing Saturday in the J
hope of playing the Coliseum on j
their own in the future, meaning •
that they played "Should I Stay;
or Should I Go?" and not "I'm!
So Bored with the U.S.A."!
They're both very good songs, so;
I'm not exactly complaining. ButJ
the most important facet of the J
Clash's appearance was that they j
appeared, and folks had noi
choice but to listen to them be--
fore the Who would come out.!
And in any case, and to the!
Who's credit, I don't think tooj
many people remembered the;
opening acts at the end of the;
evening.
The Who looked and sounded'
like they were having a real good
time on the road; Last Tour or
no, they have succeeded — fi
nally — in ignoring the implica
tions of their status and letting
the music do the talking. Therfc
are times when cliches are
y'know.
