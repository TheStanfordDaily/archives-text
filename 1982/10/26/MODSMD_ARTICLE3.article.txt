Sharon assumes massacre responsibility
Jerusalem — Defense Minister Ariel Sharon, in testimony to the com
mission probing the Beirut massacre, took responsibility yesterday for let
ting Lebanese Christian militiamen into the Palestinian refugee camps. He
said Prime Minister Menachem Begin had known nothing about it.
The commission, in its first public session, grilled Sharon for more than
two hours on whether the Israeli army and government should have sus
pected in advance that the entry of the Christians into the Sabra and Chatilla
camps to rout PLO guerrillas might end in a slaughter.
Sharon said the decision to let the Christians into the camps was worked
out by the chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Raphael Eytan, "and I approved it, because
it was the accepted thing, it was clear, it was what we were striving for all the
time...
"Our central concern was to save our soldiers' lives. Moreover, there was a
Cabinet decision reached June IS, 1982, which spoke in a clear fashion, in my
opinion the clearest fashion possible, of integrating the Lebanese forces
(Christian militiamen) into the fighting in Lebanon."
Israel invaded Lebanon June 6 to smash the Palestine Liberation Or
ganization and entered west Beirut Sept. IS.
On Sept. 22, Sharon told Parliament the Israeli army helped plan and sup
port the Christian militia raid on the camps, intending to drive out PLO
guerrillas believed to be hiding there. But, he said he did not imagine "in our
blackest dreams" that hundreds of civlians would be massacred.
The commission members, Supreme Court Justices Yitzhak Kahan and
Aharon Barak and retired Maj. Gen. Yona Efrat, hammered away at essen
tially the same questions that outraged Israelis have been asking ever since
they forced the government to set up an inquiry.
Quake shakes central California
Coalinga, California — A powerful earthquake
that caused seismographs to go "bananas" rocked
at least a 14-county area of Central California yes
terday. but there were no reports of injury or major
damage, officials said.
Magnitude of the jolt was rated by seismographs
from California to Colorado at between 5 and 6 on
the Richter scale — large enough to cause serious
damage in a populated area.
The quake at 3:26 p.m. was centered about 10
miles north of the tiny town of Coalinga about 35
miles southwest of Fresno in the sparsely popu
lated western edge of the San Joaquin Valley, said
Dolores Page of the seismology lab at the Califor
nia Institute of Technology in Pasadena. The
epicenter was placed near the Pinnacles National
Monument.
Lt. Eugene McDaniel of the California Highway
Patrol office in Coalinga said merchandise
tumbled from the shelves in several stores in the ru
ral community and two establishments had to close
because their aisles were awash with broken goods.
"It was a real good shaker," said McDaniel. "I
was just sitting in my office and felt trembling. You
feel like vertigo .. . We got out of the building . ..
Telephone polls and wires were swaying."
But despite the quake's intensity, Roy Manning,
director of emergency services for Fresno County,
said there did not appear to be any major damage
or injuries in the epicenter area.
Poll pins blame on both parties
Washington — Most voters in the congressional
elections across the country are rejecting President
Reagan's attempts to pin the blame for the nation's
troubled economy almost exclusively on former
President Jimmy Carter and the Democratic Party,
according to a Washington Post-ABC News poll.
Instead, voters are finding plenty of blame to go
around for everyone: Carter and the Democrats,
ves, but Reagan and the Republicans as well, and
to virtually the same degree.
The question is not which party and president
are to blame — both are, in the public's view. The
question, rather, is which side is more to blame.
How individual citizens answer that, the poll
shows, is a powerful indicator of their stated voting
plans for Nov. 2.
Through the time of the poll, Oct. 4-11, Demo
crats were winning the battle of the blame and held
a 60-to-40 point lead nationwide in the voters' gen
eral, overall congressional preference. Since then,
Reagan has focused on the issue almost every day,
launching bitter barbs at Carter and the Demo
crats.
Iran wants UN vote on Israel
United Nations — Iran yesterday disdained a
compromise accepted by other Islamic countries
and demanded a vote on Israel's fitness to sit in the
U.N. General Assembly.
The vote on withholding the Jewish state's
credentials was scheduled for today.
"Any attempt to tamper with Israel's credentials
will mortally damage this organization," declared
Israeli Ambassador Yehuda Blum. He said it was
"most unlikely" the measure would succeed.
The Iranian move came after Arab and other Is
lamic countries, and the Soviet Union, expressed
collective reservation about Israel's seating but
stopped short of requesting a vote on the issue.
The letter of reservation, signed by 49 U.N. dele
gations, alleged that Israel was "not a peace-loving
member state."
The United States, which has been lobbying in
tensively against Israel's ouster, threatened to pull
out of the assembly and withhold $149.9 million it
still owes on its 1982 U.N. dues if the assembly
takes such a step.
Iranian Ambassador Said Rajaie-Khorassani
said he believed Washington was bluffing and

promised his country and Libya would make up
any U.S. funds withheld if the Americans did quit.
"What we say, we mean," U.S. Ambassador
Jeane Kirkpatrick told reporters afterward. She
called the Iranian envoy's statement "absurd."
Kirkpatrick said Iran was being "driven by the
dynamics of extremism" and was acting "outside
the discipline of any group."
An Islamic diplomat who played a key role in
working out a compromise with the Arabs to ex
press collective reservation said Iran's action
"came like a bolt out of the blue" and deeply em
barrassed other Islamic countries.
Rajaie assailed the Arab and Islamic countries
who sought to hold off the anti-Israeli push until
next year to muster more support, saying the trend
could lead to Arab recognition of Israel.
"This must not be allowed to happen," he said.
Libyan Ambassador Ali Treiki, who led the ori
ginal hardline Arab ouster drive, told a reporter
that although the Arabs had been ready to com
promise, they could not now vote against the Iran
ian amendment.
Treiki, current chairman of the 21-member Arab
working group, summoned other Arab delegations
into consultations on the Iranian move.
Blum earlier had blasted the Arab-drafted letter
of reservation in his own letter, terming it "a crude
and transparent attempt to abuse the credentials
procedure in order to introduce matters complete
ly extraneous and irrelevant to it."
Each side accused the other of violating the U.N.
Charter.
Kirilenko retires
Moscow — Soviet officials have told Communist
diplomats in Moscow that Andrei Kirilenko, the
most senior member of the ruling Politburo after
Soviet President Leonid Brezhnev, will retire in
mid-November because of poor health.
The Soviet officials said tnat a formal announce
ment of Kirilenko's retirement would be made at a
full meeting of the Communist Party's Central
Committee in three weeks. The meeting is expected
to immediately precede the regular fall session of
the Supreme Soviet, the nominal parliament,
scheduled for Nov. 16.
Communist diplomats, who did not want to
be identified by name or country, said Soviet of
ficials have told them in the last few days that
Kirilenko would be "put on pension" because of
deteriorating health. There was no indication of
who, if anyone, would be named to replace
Kirilenko.
Western diplomatic analysts said the report ap
peared credible. They noted that Kirilenko's de
parture from the the arena could complicate the
"presuccession struggle" that has been under way
in the Kremlin since the death last January of the
Politburo's chief ideologist, Mikhail Suslov.
"I think it is true," one Western specialist in So
viet affairs said of the report. "If it's not true, it
raises a lot of questions about ulterior motives" of
the Soviet officials who conveyed it to the
diplomats.
Judge demands papers on draft
Los Angeles — A federal judge gave prosecutors
until tomorrow to surrender White House docu
ments on draft registration, but agreed to let the
government hold the papers when he is not review
ing them.
U.S. District Judge Terry Hatter has been bat
tling federal prosecutors over release of the docu
ments, which are being sought by attorneys for an
admitted draft resister.
Hatter insisted yesterday that the documents be
given to him, but agreed to three limitations re
quested by Assistant U.S. Attorney Richard
Romero.
Romero asked that the documents remain in the
government's custody when the judge is not active
ly reviewing them, that there be no disclosure of the

documents to defense attorneys while they are un
der review and that the judge be general in any
open-court description of the documents.
"I'm not troubled by the government's main
taining custody of the documents in question when
the court is not reviewing them ... We have quite
enough papers in our chambers now," Hatter said.
However, American Civil Liberties Union at
torney Mark Rosenbaum, who reprsents 21-year
old David Wayte, contended the restrictions
showed a "continuing pattern of affrontery to this
judicial process" and asked that the case be dis
missed. Hatter rejected that motion.
Wavte, a former Yale University philosophy
student who lives in Pasadena, is charged with fail
ing to register for the draft. His attorneys contend
he is a victim of selective prosecution because of his
vocal opposition to the draft.
The judge ordered that the documents be pre
sented to him by noon Wednesday and scheduled
another court hearing for Thursday afternoon to
rule on whether the documents should be kept con
fidential or should be turned over to defense at
torneys.
Hatter also said he will rule at that time on
whether top presidential counselor Edwin Meese
will be required to testify. The government has re
sisted attempts to have Meese put on the witness
stand.
Police find more laced Tylenol
Chicago — An eighth bottle of Extra-Strength
Tylenol containing cyanide-laced capsules has
been found among the scores of containers turned
in to police by consumers, a source close to the
Tvlenol murder investigation said yesterday;
The source, who declined to be identified, said
police had mailed the package for testing to a cen
ter at Maple Plains, Minnesota, operated by
McNeil Consumer Products Co., manufacturer of
the pain remedy.
The bottle was sent with "a notation that it
might be contaminated," and subsequent tests
confirmed the presence of cyanide, the source said.
The contaminated bottle was turned over to FBI
agents in Minneapolis.
One other bottle of contaminated Tylenol
capsules was found among the bottles returned by
consumers, one was found among bottles pulled
from store shelves and not sold, and five were con
nected with the seven Tylenol deaths.
Meanwhile yesterday, authorities said they still
had no "prime suspects," and no arrests were im
minent in the cyanide deaths of people who took
Extra-Strength Tylenol capsules.
Stock market plummets
The stock market's best known indicator, Dow
Jones, took its biggest one-day plunge since the
Great Crash of 1929 yesterday, a dramatic turn
around only two trading days after it reached a 10-
year high.
Wall Street analysts blamed the sudden sell-off
on fears that the Federal Reserve Board might
have stopped allowing interest rates to fall — and
on professional investors' rush to sell as they saw
some of their recent gains slipping away.
One broker described the mood in the invest
ment world as "manic-depressive."
In Washington, deputy White House press sec
retary Peter Roussel said: "We had one bad blip to
day, but we set other records last week. Look what
it did all last week."
Roussel said other economic barometers should
be examined, and referred to the Consumer Price
Index and the index of leading indicators, due out
later this week.
Today's weather
Partly cloudy today with scattered showers. A
little cooler, with highs in the 60s and a 40 percent
chance of rain. West winds 10 to 20 mph. Mostly
fair tonight.
