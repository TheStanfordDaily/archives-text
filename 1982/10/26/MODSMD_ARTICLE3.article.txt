Sharon assumes massacre responsibility
Jerusalem — Defense Minister Ariel Sharon, in testimony to the com
mission probing the Beirut massacre, took responsibility yesterday for let
ting Lebanese Christian militiamen into the Palestinian refugee camps. He
said Prime Minister Menachem Begin had known nothing about it.
The commission, in its first public session, grilled Sharon for more than
two hours on whether the Israeli army and government should have sus
pected in advance that the entry of the Christians into the Sabra and Chatilla
camps to rout PLO guerrillas might end in a slaughter.
Sharon said the decision to let the Christians into the camps was worked
out by the chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Raphael Eytan, "and I approved it, because
it was the accepted thing, it was clear, it was what we were striving for all the
time...
"Our central concern was to save our soldiers' lives. Moreover, there was a
Cabinet decision reached June IS, 1982, which spoke in a clear fashion, in my
opinion the clearest fashion possible, of integrating the Lebanese forces
(Christian militiamen) into the fighting in Lebanon."
Israel invaded Lebanon June 6 to smash the Palestine Liberation Or
ganization and entered west Beirut Sept. IS.
On Sept. 22, Sharon told Parliament the Israeli army helped plan and sup
port the Christian militia raid on the camps, intending to drive out PLO
guerrillas believed to be hiding there. But, he said he did not imagine "in our
blackest dreams" that hundreds of civlians would be massacred.
The commission members, Supreme Court Justices Yitzhak Kahan and
Aharon Barak and retired Maj. Gen. Yona Efrat, hammered away at essen
tially the same questions that outraged Israelis have been asking ever since
they forced the government to set up an inquiry.
