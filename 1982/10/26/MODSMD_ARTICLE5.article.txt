# New stable manager sought
## 
### BOB COHN 
The University is in the process of searching for a new
manager for the Stanford Stables — which need more than
$500,000 in restoration — and hopes to re-open the facility
by winter quarter, according to the provost's office.
Lois Melville, present director of the stables, which are lo
cated near the golf course, is planning to leave at the end of
this year.
"We are looking for a tenant," said John Hughes, assis
tant to the vice provost for management and budget."The
University is committed to restoring the bam," which has
incurred serious damage recently due to rain and general
wear and tear. The dilapidated state of the stables has forced
the University to cancel riding classes until the facility is re
stored.
Hughes added that the most favorable solution would be
to find a tenant who will be able to fund the restoration of the
bam as part of its leasing contract. The University indicated,
however, that leasing to a person or group with enough mon
ey to finance the restoration is unlikely, however.
The University Real Estate Office, one of a handful of of
fices which has been involved in the recent assessment of the
stables, is taking up the task of finding a new manager for the
stables, according to Hughes. Such a search will not begin,
however, until the real estate office draws up a prospectus, a
task scheduled to be completed by the end of this month, he
said.
Because the University has two months until Melville
leaves, the problem is not finding a replacement but finding
one who will be able to contribute to the restoration of the

stables.
If the University cannot find a replacement who will be
able to contribute money, it will consider other funding
plans, such as general University funds, fundraising and
gifts, according to Hughes. If funding still remains difficult,
the University may only restore parts of the bam.
In any case, construction on the barn probably will not be
gin until the summer to avoid winter rains, according to
Hughes. But others feel that delays in construction will hurt
the already dilapidated structure which will soon be worn by
winter rains. They feel that the University should have begun
construction this summer to assure the survival of the
stables.
"The report that we had from an architectural consultant
indicated that it was likely that the barn wouldn't make it
through another rainy season," said Janet Lynch, a regular
rider and vice president of the Stanford Equestrians. "It's
understandable that they can't construct over the winter,"
she added, "so that's why we called it to their attention last
spring."
Stability, as opposed to complete restoration, seems to be
the immediate goal of the University. "There are grades of
restoration," said Hughes. "If you're talking about restoring
to top-notch condition, that probably won't happen right
away. But it (the barn) certainly will be stabilized."
"We want not just a tenant who will restore it," said
Hughes, "but someone who will keep it up. The current ten
ant has not kept it in good condition."
