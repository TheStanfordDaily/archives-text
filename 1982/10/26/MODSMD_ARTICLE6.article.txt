# Bottle deposit causes conflict
## 
### KAREN SPRINGEN 
Environmentalists and beverage
container lobbyists have taken oppo
site sides in the expensive high-profile
battle over Proposition 11, an initiative
which would require a minimum five
cent deposit on all beer and soft drink
containers.
Proponents of the proposition which
many call the "bottle bill," claim it will
reduce litter, conserve resources and
energy, save money on garbage dis
posal costs and result in a net increase
in jobs.
Opponents of the initiative claim the
litter reduction effects of the law are
minimal, since beverage container lit
ter makes up a small fraction of total
litter. They say the initiative will result
in additional handling, transportation
and sanitation costs while reducing
jobs in the container industry.
So far the initiative's opponents have
far surpassed its proponents in raising
money. According to the California
secretary'of state's office, as of mid-
September opponents had collected
$4.2 million and spent $2.6 million
while proponents had collected
$590,000 and spent $580,000 on the
campaign. A report issued by Califor
nians Against Waste, the group spon
soring the initiative, claimed the major
soft drink and beer companies plan to
spend between $5 and $10 million to
defeat the initiative.
Ross Pumfrey, CAW chairman, said
Coca-Cola, Pepsi, Anheuser-Busch
and other bottle lobby members have
out-spent bottle bill proponents 20 to 1
in previous state elections. Beverage
and container lobbyists have prevented
the bill's passage at the legislative level
each year since 1979.
In a Channel 2/League of Women
Voters presentation yesterday, Pum
frey and Chuck Collins of the Califor
nia Grocers Association, a group op
posing the initiative, debated the pros
and cons of the proposition.
According to Pumfrey, the bill's be
nefits include an increase in recycling,
because Californians threw away $7
billion worth of beverage containers
last year. It would also cause an esti
mated 40 percent reduction in litter, a
decrease in litter pick-up expenses, a
reduction in broken bottle and can in
juries, a net gain in employment and a
savings in material, energy and water.
The two sides disagreed on the ef
fects the initiative would have on water
that would be required for cleaning de
posit bottles, while Pumfrey said eight
billion gallons of water would be saved
in manufacturing.
Collins said the storage of bottles
