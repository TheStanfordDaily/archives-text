# Bottle deposit causes conflict
## 
### KAREN SPRINGEN 
Environmentalists and beverage
container lobbyists have taken oppo
site sides in the expensive high-profile
battle over Proposition 11, an initiative
which would require a minimum five
cent deposit on all beer and soft drink
containers.
Proponents of the proposition which
many call the "bottle bill," claim it will
reduce litter, conserve resources and
energy, save money on garbage dis
posal costs and result in a net increase
in jobs.
Opponents of the initiative claim the
litter reduction effects of the law are
minimal, since beverage container lit
ter makes up a small fraction of total
litter. They say the initiative will result
in additional handling, transportation
and sanitation costs while reducing
jobs in the container industry.
So far the initiative's opponents have
far surpassed its proponents in raising
money. According to the California
secretary'of state's office, as of mid-
September opponents had collected
$4.2 million and spent $2.6 million
while proponents had collected
$590,000 and spent $580,000 on the
campaign. A report issued by Califor
nians Against Waste, the group spon
soring the initiative, claimed the major
soft drink and beer companies plan to
spend between $5 and $10 million to
defeat the initiative.
Ross Pumfrey, CAW chairman, said
Coca-Cola, Pepsi, Anheuser-Busch
and other bottle lobby members have
out-spent bottle bill proponents 20 to 1
in previous state elections. Beverage
and container lobbyists have prevented
the bill's passage at the legislative level
each year since 1979.
In a Channel 2/League of Women
Voters presentation yesterday, Pum
frey and Chuck Collins of the Califor
nia Grocers Association, a group op
posing the initiative, debated the pros
and cons of the proposition.
According to Pumfrey, the bill's be
nefits include an increase in recycling,
because Californians threw away $7
billion worth of beverage containers
last year. It would also cause an esti
mated 40 percent reduction in litter, a
decrease in litter pick-up expenses, a
reduction in broken bottle and can in
juries, a net gain in employment and a
savings in material, energy and water.
The two sides disagreed on the ef
fects the initiative would have on water
that would be required for cleaning de
posit bottles, while Pumfrey said eight
billion gallons of water would be saved
in manufacturing.
Collins said the storage of bottles
which would accompany their proces
sing would create health and sanitation
hazards. The bill would also create ad
ditional handling and transporation
costs, logistical difficulties in returning
the containers to the original dis
tributor, lost jobs in the bottle industry
and lost income to container scaven
gers.
Collins said the measure is unneces
sary, because Californians already re
cycle 60 percent of all beverage con
tainers, and beverage containers com
pose only 15 percent of highway litter.
Under the measure retailers would
be reimbursed by distributors and
wholesalers and would also receive a
20 percent storing and handling fee.
Distributors would keep any un
claimed deposits. The statute would
only apply to containers of beer and
other malt beverages, mineral water,
soda water and similar carbonated soft
drinks.
According to senior Fred Beddall,
co-head of ASSU recycling, unless
ASSU recycling was designated a re
demption center, the bill would involve
less handling for the center here. Stu
dents would be more likely to take their
containers to the retailer for refunds
than to deposit them in recycling bins.
Beddall said the one-penny redemp
tion under the bill would represent a
large jump from the current recycling
rate of one cent per 10 bottles.
John Mayer, acting manager of
Safeway on El Camino, said about the
bill," It's a shame the entire population
has to suffer for the irresponsibility of a
few." He cited the common arguments
that recycling companies would be put
out of business and that inevitably the
cost would be passed on to the con
sumer. "We'd be inundated with all
these bottes and cans being returned,"
he said.
Safeway and other large supermar
kets have conducted a campaign
against the initiative that has included
printing signs on brown paper bags urg
ing shoppers to vote no on 11.
Tom Sawyer, head of the Palo Alto
Recycling Center, said he is ambivalent
about Proposition 11. "For us as a re
cycler it doesn't affect us too much."

He said the initiative does not address
the major problem in recycling — the
lack of convenient sites. For this reason
he said, "recycling is practically
nonexistent now."
"It there were a convenient site, kids
would go out and clean it up," he ad
ded. The present curb-site recycling
pick-up is inadequate, he said.
Co-Op, owned by the consumers
who shop there, is the only local
supermarket which supports Proposi
tion 11. Steven Avis, Co-Op commun
ity relations coordinator, said the bill
would result in a 30 to 50 percent in
crease in the number of containers re
turned by Co-Op consumers.
"We think that the claims are a little
overstated by the opposition. We've
been collecting bottles for years and
we've never had a health problem,"
Avis said.
The bill would result in a 90 percent
aluminum savings, Avis predicted.
"The overall energy savings will be
dramatic," Avis said. The container
represents slightly more than half the
cost of the beverage, he added.
Pat Tansey, a manager of Pepsi Cola
in Sunnyvale, described the bill as
"ludicrous" and poorly worded. He
said it is inconsistent because some be
verage, such as those sold out of vend
ing machines, will not have deposits.
"They're on the right track. I think
they're going at it in the wrong angle,"
Tansey said. "You're going to have
sticky cans sitting in the back of the
store," he added.
According to CAW, the bill would
n6t result in consumer cost increases. A
similar bottle bill in Maine cauiiqdiM
slight decline in prices. CAW also-said
a deposit system would not destroy
voluntary recycling centers; and states
with returnable laws have had no
health complaints, saved tax dollars in
litter pick-up and garbage disposal
costs, reduced solid waste going to
landfills and gained new jobs in ecycl
ing, trucking and handling.
' Six states, most notably Oregon,
"have passed similar bills. In the states
where they have been implemented,
mandatory deposit laws have never
been repealed.
According to the Santa Clara County
sample ballot, the law's net fiscal effect
cannot be determined.

overstated by the opposition. We've
been collecting bottles for years and
we've never had a health problem,"
Avis said.
The bill would result in a 90 percent
aluminum savings, Avis predicted.
"The overall energy savings will be
dramatic," Avis said. The container
represents slightly more than half the
cost of the beverage, he added.
Pat Tansey, a manager of Pepsi Cola
in Sunnyvale, described the bill as
"ludicrous" and poorly worded. He
said it is inconsistent because some be
verage, such as those sold out of vend
ing machines, will not have deposits.
"They're on the right track. I think
they're going at it in the wrong angle,"
Tansey said. "You're going to have
sticky cans sitting in the back of the
store," he added.
According to CAW, the bill would
n6t result in consumer cost increases. A
similar bottle bill in Maine cauiiqdiM
slight decline in prices. CAW also-said
a deposit system would not destroy
voluntary recycling centers; and states
with returnable laws have had no
health complaints, saved tax dollars in
litter pick-up and garbage disposal
costs, reduced solid waste going to
landfills and gained new jobs in ecycl
ing, trucking and handling.
' Six states, most notably Oregon,
"have passed similar bills. In the states
where they have been implemented,
mandatory deposit laws have never
been repealed.
According to the Santa Clara County
sample ballot, the law's net fiscal effect
cannot be determined.
Environmentalists and beverage
container lobbyists have taken oppo
site sides in the expensive high-profile
battle over Proposition 11, an initiative
which would require a minimum five
cent deposit on all beer and soft drink
containers.
Proponents of the proposition which
many call the "bottle bill," claim it will
reduce litter, conserve resources and
energy, save money on garbage dis
posal costs and result in a net increase
in jobs.
Opponents of the initiative claim the
litter reduction effects of the law are
minimal, since beverage container lit
ter makes up a small fraction of total
litter. They say the initiative will result
in additional handling, transportation
and sanitation costs while reducing
jobs in the container industry.
So far the initiative's opponents have
far surpassed its proponents in raising
money. According to the California
secretary'of state's office, as of mid-
September opponents had collected
$4.2 million and spent $2.6 million
while proponents had collected
$590,000 and spent $580,000 on the
campaign. A report issued by Califor
nians Against Waste, the group spon
soring the initiative, claimed the major
soft drink and beer companies plan to
spend between $5 and $10 million to
defeat the initiative.
Ross Pumfrey, CAW chairman, said
Coca-Cola, Pepsi, Anheuser-Busch
and other bottle lobby members have
out-spent bottle bill proponents 20 to 1
in previous state elections. Beverage
and container lobbyists have prevented
the bill's passage at the legislative level
each year since 1979.
In a Channel 2/League of Women
Voters presentation yesterday, Pum
frey and Chuck Collins of the Califor
nia Grocers Association, a group op
posing the initiative, debated the pros
and cons of the proposition.
According to Pumfrey, the bill's be
nefits include an increase in recycling,
because Californians threw away $7
billion worth of beverage containers
last year. It would also cause an esti
mated 40 percent reduction in litter, a
decrease in litter pick-up expenses, a
reduction in broken bottle and can in
juries, a net gain in employment and a
savings in material, energy and water.
The two sides disagreed on the ef
fects the initiative would have on water
that would be required for cleaning de
posit bottles, while Pumfrey said eight
billion gallons of water would be saved
in manufacturing.
Collins said the storage of bottles
which would accompany their proces
sing would create health and sanitation
hazards. The bill would also create ad
ditional handling and transporation
costs, logistical difficulties in returning
the containers to the original dis
tributor, lost jobs in the bottle industry
and lost income to container scaven
gers.
Collins said the measure is unneces
sary, because Californians already re
cycle 60 percent of all beverage con
tainers, and beverage containers com
pose only 15 percent of highway litter.
Under the measure retailers would
be reimbursed by distributors and
wholesalers and would also receive a
20 percent storing and handling fee.
Distributors would keep any un
claimed deposits. The statute would
only apply to containers of beer and
other malt beverages, mineral water,
soda water and similar carbonated soft
drinks.
According to senior Fred Beddall,
co-head of ASSU recycling, unless
ASSU recycling was designated a re
demption center, the bill would involve
less handling for the center here. Stu
dents would be more likely to take their
containers to the retailer for refunds
than to deposit them in recycling bins.
Beddall said the one-penny redemp
tion under the bill would represent a
large jump from the current recycling
rate of one cent per 10 bottles.
John Mayer, acting manager of
Safeway on El Camino, said about the
bill," It's a shame the entire population
has to suffer for the irresponsibility of a
few." He cited the common arguments
that recycling companies would be put
out of business and that inevitably the
cost would be passed on to the con
sumer. "We'd be inundated with all
these bottes and cans being returned,"
he said.
Safeway and other large supermar
kets have conducted a campaign
against the initiative that has included
printing signs on brown paper bags urg
ing shoppers to vote no on 11.
Tom Sawyer, head of the Palo Alto
Recycling Center, said he is ambivalent
about Proposition 11. "For us as a re
cycler it doesn't affect us too much."

He said the initiative does not address
the major problem in recycling — the
lack of convenient sites. For this reason
he said, "recycling is practically
nonexistent now."
"It there were a convenient site, kids
would go out and clean it up," he ad
ded. The present curb-site recycling
pick-up is inadequate, he said.
Co-Op, owned by the consumers
who shop there, is the only local
supermarket which supports Proposi
tion 11. Steven Avis, Co-Op commun
ity relations coordinator, said the bill
would result in a 30 to 50 percent in
crease in the number of containers re
turned by Co-Op consumers.
"We think that the claims are a little
overstated by the opposition. We've
been collecting bottles for years and
we've never had a health problem,"
