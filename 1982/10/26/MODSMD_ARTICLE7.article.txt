# Committee debates value of semesters

The calendar question — "like the locust" — re
turns every eight to 10 years, Prof. Henry Breitrose
told a Faculty Senate hearing recently.
Indeed, the controversial issue, which could re
place the University's present quarter system with
either a semester or a six-term-per-year plan, re
turned to the Faculty Senate two weeks ago.
A report from a 13-member senate committee
consisting of administrators, faculty and students is
expected soon on the issue, but the chairman of the
committee, Religious Studies Prof. Edwin Good,
doubts it will recommend changing the quarter sys
tem.
The report was prompted by English Prof.
Ronald Rebholz who suggested to the senate that
the University switch to the semester system, a
change which the UC-Berkeley will be implement
ing next year.
Rebholz is deeply disappointed that the commit
tee doesn't seem to favor a semester system. Most
professors in science-oriented academic areas such
as engineering favor the quarter system, but
Rebholz said he thinks the humanities deserve to
have a system that is more suited to them, such as the
semester system.
"Why should the tail of the engineers wag the
dog of the University?" Rebholz asked.
More than half of the universities in North Amer
ica are on the early semester system — starting one
semester in late August and going until Christmas,

having a longer Christmas break, then going back
until late May for the final semester — according to
Good.
"It's a neat schedule. I'd decide tomorrow for se
mesters, but, fortunately for a lot of people, it's not
up to me," Good said.
To find out what other faculty members wanted,
the committee sent memos to deans and department
chairmen. A fair number responded, but reaction
was mixed. According to Go >d, the group started to
realize that each system benei ts certain educational
areas, but no system is good fi ■ all of them.
Engineering faculty and stu ?nts seem to be the
most adamantly in favor of q larters. Yet propo
nents of semesters often po it out that both
theMassachusetts Institute of Technology and
Harvard University are on the semester system. This
suggests that the engineering curriculum could be
adapted to longer terms.
However those favoring quarters assert the quar
ter system has more flexibility than is being taken
advantage of currently. In fact, the committee will
probably recommend that more courses he offered
for two quarters..
The graduate student representative on the com
mittee, Alex Markevich, attended Berkeley during
his undergraduate years and said students there
were much more open to taking classes for several
quarters. He sees this as a partial solution to objec
tions raised about quarters.
Rebholz said he thinks, however, that many stu

dents at Stanford have a psychological block toward
taking two-quarter classes.
Students themselves seem to prefer the flexibility
of quarters. Like sophomore Audrey Weinland,
they like the fact that quarters "give a student more
chances to take a variety of classes."
Others say that the benefit of flexibility is out
weighed by the fact that one does not have time to
absorb all the reading assigned or to write an in
volved paper. Junior Pam Maes, for example, feels
that many classes never go deeper than a surface
level. She would prefer "to have time to think about
things in more depth."
Other students favor the early semester system for
more practical reasons. As the cost of Stanford rises,
and the availability of summer jobs decreases, the
fact that the University gets out later than colleges
on the semester system becomes more critical. The
problem is magnified for students who live too far to
go home and look for a job before June.
Another practical advantage some see in semes
ters is the opportunity for a more meaningful Dead
Week. Because quarters tend to get rushed at the
end, many students feel that Dead Week is actually
when they are the most lively. Even if the University
keeps the current calendar, some members of the
committee said they should try to alleviate problems
like these.
However, few committee members seem to dislike
the quarter system to the point that they would rec-
ommend changing it. Alex Markevich
said there was some advantage to se
mesters, but he didn't feel that there was
enough reason to change. Doris
Wilson, one of two undergraduate
members of the committee, agreed. Al
though she initially favored a switch to
semesters, after talking to people she
concluded that most want to keep
things as they are.
The committee reviewed the reasons
Berkeley gave for the change, but were
apparently not convinced that they
would apply to Stanford. According to
Good, the decision to change to semes
ters at Berkeley was arrived at by a ma
jority of the faculty. They listed aca
demic advantages and indicated that it
would save admissions and record
keeping costs.
Unlike the University, which has
been on the quarter system since 1917,
Berkeley was on the semester system
until the 19605, and the change there

was expected. But student opinion polls
indicate that most students would pre
fer to stay on quarters.
Perhaps the most radical schedule
conceived of by the Stanford committee
consists of six terms of five week each,
suggested by Computer Science Prof.
Gene Golub. The "Golub-unit" system
would allow professors to offer a class
for two "Golubs" — roughly a quarter.
Other courses could last three golubs,
or almost any variation. Norman
Wessells, dean of humanities and sci
ences, told the senate that he personally
favored this calendar.
While the "golub-unit" is stilt con
sidered a possible compromise, many
members of the committee felt it was
too complicated. After hearing about
the "golub system" one student com
mented, "I have enough problems
going to Maples and registering. Please
don't make it any more difficult for
me."
Rebholz said he thinks that accepting
the "golub-units" would be the biggest
challenge to conservative thinking at
Stanford since the 19605.

Students themselves seem to prefer the flexibility
of quarters. Like sophomore Audrey Weinland,
they like the fact that quarters "give a student more
chances to take a variety of classes."
Others say that the benefit of flexibility is out
weighed by the fact that one does not have time to
absorb all the reading assigned or to write an in
volved paper. Junior Pam Maes, for example, feels
that many classes never go deeper than a surface
level. She would prefer "to have time to think about
things in more depth."
Other students favor the early semester system for
more practical reasons. As the cost of Stanford rises,
and the availability of summer jobs decreases, the
fact that the University gets out later than colleges
on the semester system becomes more critical. The
problem is magnified for students who live too far to
go home and look for a job before June.
Another practical advantage some see in semes
ters is the opportunity for a more meaningful Dead
Week. Because quarters tend to get rushed at the
end, many students feel that Dead Week is actually
when they are the most lively. Even if the University
keeps the current calendar, some members of the
committee said they should try to alleviate problems
like these.
However, few committee members seem to dislike
the quarter system to the point that they would rec-
ommend changing it. Alex Markevich
said there was some advantage to se
mesters, but he didn't feel that there was
enough reason to change. Doris
Wilson, one of two undergraduate
members of the committee, agreed. Al
though she initially favored a switch to
semesters, after talking to people she
concluded that most want to keep
things as they are.
The committee reviewed the reasons
Berkeley gave for the change, but were
apparently not convinced that they
would apply to Stanford. According to
Good, the decision to change to semes
ters at Berkeley was arrived at by a ma
jority of the faculty. They listed aca
demic advantages and indicated that it
would save admissions and record
keeping costs.
Unlike the University, which has
been on the quarter system since 1917,
Berkeley was on the semester system
until the 19605, and the change there

was expected. But student opinion polls
indicate that most students would pre
fer to stay on quarters.
Perhaps the most radical schedule
conceived of by the Stanford committee
consists of six terms of five week each,
suggested by Computer Science Prof.
Gene Golub. The "Golub-unit" system
would allow professors to offer a class
for two "Golubs" — roughly a quarter.
Other courses could last three golubs,
or almost any variation. Norman
Wessells, dean of humanities and sci
ences, told the senate that he personally
favored this calendar.
While the "golub-unit" is stilt con
sidered a possible compromise, many
members of the committee felt it was
too complicated. After hearing about
the "golub system" one student com
mented, "I have enough problems
going to Maples and registering. Please
don't make it any more difficult for
me."
Rebholz said he thinks that accepting
the "golub-units" would be the biggest
challenge to conservative thinking at
Stanford since the 19605.
The calendar question — "like the locust" — re
turns every eight to 10 years, Prof. Henry Breitrose
told a Faculty Senate hearing recently.
Indeed, the controversial issue, which could re
place the University's present quarter system with
either a semester or a six-term-per-year plan, re
turned to the Faculty Senate two weeks ago.
A report from a 13-member senate committee
consisting of administrators, faculty and students is
expected soon on the issue, but the chairman of the
committee, Religious Studies Prof. Edwin Good,
doubts it will recommend changing the quarter sys
tem.
The report was prompted by English Prof.
Ronald Rebholz who suggested to the senate that
the University switch to the semester system, a
change which the UC-Berkeley will be implement
ing next year.
Rebholz is deeply disappointed that the commit
tee doesn't seem to favor a semester system. Most
professors in science-oriented academic areas such
as engineering favor the quarter system, but
Rebholz said he thinks the humanities deserve to
have a system that is more suited to them, such as the
semester system.
"Why should the tail of the engineers wag the
dog of the University?" Rebholz asked.
More than half of the universities in North Amer
ica are on the early semester system — starting one
semester in late August and going until Christmas,

having a longer Christmas break, then going back
until late May for the final semester — according to
Good.
"It's a neat schedule. I'd decide tomorrow for se
mesters, but, fortunately for a lot of people, it's not
up to me," Good said.
To find out what other faculty members wanted,
the committee sent memos to deans and department
chairmen. A fair number responded, but reaction
was mixed. According to Go >d, the group started to
realize that each system benei ts certain educational
areas, but no system is good fi ■ all of them.
Engineering faculty and stu ?nts seem to be the
most adamantly in favor of q larters. Yet propo
nents of semesters often po it out that both
theMassachusetts Institute of Technology and
Harvard University are on the semester system. This
suggests that the engineering curriculum could be
adapted to longer terms.
However those favoring quarters assert the quar
ter system has more flexibility than is being taken
advantage of currently. In fact, the committee will
probably recommend that more courses he offered
for two quarters..
The graduate student representative on the com
mittee, Alex Markevich, attended Berkeley during
his undergraduate years and said students there
were much more open to taking classes for several
quarters. He sees this as a partial solution to objec
tions raised about quarters.
Rebholz said he thinks, however, that many stu

dents at Stanford have a psychological block toward
taking two-quarter classes.
Students themselves seem to prefer the flexibility
of quarters. Like sophomore Audrey Weinland,
