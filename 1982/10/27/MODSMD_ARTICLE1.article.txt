# Independent parties face low budgets, lower polls

James Griffen has driven a truck for a
living for more than 20 years. But this
fall, instead of speeding past the small
towns along the way, Griffen stops off
to do a little campaigning.
"I like to stop in the small towns and
just talk to the people. I think we'll get
more votes than people expect. At least
I hope so, because I've worked hard

enough," said the 45-year-old, who is
the American Independent Party's
candidate for governor.
"The party pays for my expenses, but
it costs. It takes a little bit of dedica
tion," said Griffen.
The American Independent Party is
one of three parties, besides the Demo
cratic and the Republican, which are
qualified to place nominees on the
Nov. 2 California ballot. The Peace and
Freedom Party and the Libertarian
Party are the other two.

While traditional party candidates
Mayor Peter Wilson and Gov. Brown,
Mayor Tom Bradley and Attorney
General George Deukmejian, battle
for the U.S. Senate and governor's
seats with multi-million dollar cam
paigns, the third party candidates are
running theirs on shoe-string budgets
financed solely by individual con
tributors.
Most of the third-party candidates
have spent the campaign travelling ac
ross the state, appearing before rotary
clubs, student audiences, and any other
groups that will hear them, reiterating
the proposals that see them apart from
traditional candidates.
Most are holding down jobs while
they run for office. Included among
them are a journeyman silkscreen
printer, a writer, an economics profes
sor, a truck driver and an insurance
salesman.
According to the most recent Los
Angeles Times Poll, the third party
candidates received support from less
than 10 percent of those surveyed.
About 145,000 or 1.3 percent of
California voters are registered as
American Independent. The Peace and
Freedom Party and the Libertarian

Party include 48,993 and 73,438 regis
tered voters respectively.
"Obviously, we don't expect to win
the election," said Jane Armbruster,
media coordinator for Peace and Free
dom governor's candidate Elizabeth
Martinez. "But we expect to send a
message. We want to raise those issues
and begin to build a movement to resist
militarism in this society," she said.
"We want to give these people a
choice who are sick and fed up with
Democratic and Republican spend
itis," said Teresa Deitrich, American
Independent candidate for U.S. Se
nate.
The Libertarian Party, which qual
ified for the California ballot in 1980,
, supports dramatic cutbacks in govern
