# Independent parties face low budgets, lower polls
## 
### DAVID AZRIN Senior staff writer 
James Griffen has driven a truck for a
living for more than 20 years. But this
fall, instead of speeding past the small
towns along the way, Griffen stops off
to do a little campaigning.
"I like to stop in the small towns and
just talk to the people. I think we'll get
more votes than people expect. At least
I hope so, because I've worked hard

enough," said the 45-year-old, who is
the American Independent Party's
candidate for governor.
"The party pays for my expenses, but
it costs. It takes a little bit of dedica
tion," said Griffen.
The American Independent Party is
one of three parties, besides the Demo
cratic and the Republican, which are
qualified to place nominees on the
Nov. 2 California ballot. The Peace and
Freedom Party and the Libertarian
Party are the other two.

While traditional party candidates
Mayor Peter Wilson and Gov. Brown,
Mayor Tom Bradley and Attorney
General George Deukmejian, battle
for the U.S. Senate and governor's
seats with multi-million dollar cam
paigns, the third party candidates are
running theirs on shoe-string budgets
financed solely by individual con
tributors.
Most of the third-party candidates
have spent the campaign travelling ac
ross the state, appearing before rotary
clubs, student audiences, and any other
groups that will hear them, reiterating
the proposals that see them apart from
traditional candidates.
Most are holding down jobs while
they run for office. Included among
them are a journeyman silkscreen
printer, a writer, an economics profes
sor, a truck driver and an insurance
salesman.
According to the most recent Los
Angeles Times Poll, the third party
candidates received support from less
than 10 percent of those surveyed.
About 145,000 or 1.3 percent of
California voters are registered as
American Independent. The Peace and
Freedom Party and the Libertarian

Party include 48,993 and 73,438 regis
tered voters respectively.
"Obviously, we don't expect to win
the election," said Jane Armbruster,
media coordinator for Peace and Free
dom governor's candidate Elizabeth
Martinez. "But we expect to send a
message. We want to raise those issues
and begin to build a movement to resist
militarism in this society," she said.
"We want to give these people a
choice who are sick and fed up with
Democratic and Republican spend
itis," said Teresa Deitrich, American
Independent candidate for U.S. Se
nate.
The Libertarian Party, which qual
ified for the California ballot in 1980,
, supports dramatic cutbacks in govern



Dan Dougherty
ment programs and taxation.
Dan Dougherty, the Libertarian
candidate for governor, said he has fo
cused his campaign on his proposals to
decriminalize victimless crimes and de
crease taxation.
"I am the only candidate who's
pledged himself to lower taxes," the
57-year-old insurance salesman said.
"Valuable scarce resources are being
used to bust kids for pot while people
are getting murdered. The government
should get out of the business of reg
ulating people's business and get off on
the beat and stop violent crime,"
Dougherty said.
The Dougherty campaign has raised
more than any other third-party cam
paign with about $60,000 to $70,000 in
contributions.
Joseph Furhig, the Libertarian can
didate for the U.S. Senate, has focused
on his proposals for changing Ameri
can economic and foreign policies.
Furhig, an economics professor who
teaches at six Bay Area colleges, sup
ported cutting all aid to Israel, decreas
ing taxes, abolishing the federal reserve
system, abolishing social security,
eliminating draft registration and cut
ting defense spending by 85 percent.
The Peace and Freedom Party,
which qualified for the California bal
lot in 1968, is a democratic socialist
party that was formed out of the anti
war movement in the late 19605. The
party supports cutbacks in defense
spending, jobs programs, increased
corporate taxes and the nationalization
of major industries.
Elizabeth Martinez, the Peace and
Freedom candidate for governor, has
focused her campaign on the military
policies of the Reagan administration,
according to Armbruster, the cam
paign manager.
"One of the main issues is the way in
which the U.S. government under
Reagan is militarizing this society and
the way it is affecting the people of
California," Armbruster said.
Martinez is a member of the Democ
ratic Worker's Party and previously
worked as a writer for The Nation
magazine, according to Armbruster.
David Wald, the Peace and Free
dom's candidate for the U.S. Senate,
could not be reached for comment.
A right-wing group which qualified

Deitrich, has focused her U.S. Se

Griffen, the party's candidate for
governor, said his campaign is em

breaks to small businessmen, decrease
welfare payments and impose tariffs on
California imports.
The truck driver said regardless of
the election results, he has already won
a political victory, a victory not over the
Democrats or Republicans, but over
the other third-party candidates.
"We've already won. The party's
growing and it doubled its
membership in the past three years.
We're twice as big as the Libertarians
and four times as big as the Peace and
Freedom party. We've already won."

Dan Dougherty
ment programs and taxation.
Dan Dougherty, the Libertarian
candidate for governor, said he has fo
cused his campaign on his proposals to
decriminalize victimless crimes and de
crease taxation.
"I am the only candidate who's
pledged himself to lower taxes," the
57-year-old insurance salesman said.
"Valuable scarce resources are being
used to bust kids for pot while people
are getting murdered. The government
should get out of the business of reg
ulating people's business and get off on
the beat and stop violent crime,"
Dougherty said.
The Dougherty campaign has raised
more than any other third-party cam
paign with about $60,000 to $70,000 in
contributions.
Joseph Furhig, the Libertarian can
didate for the U.S. Senate, has focused
on his proposals for changing Ameri
can economic and foreign policies.
Furhig, an economics professor who
teaches at six Bay Area colleges, sup
ported cutting all aid to Israel, decreas
ing taxes, abolishing the federal reserve
system, abolishing social security,
eliminating draft registration and cut
ting defense spending by 85 percent.
The Peace and Freedom Party,
which qualified for the California bal
lot in 1968, is a democratic socialist
party that was formed out of the anti
war movement in the late 19605. The
party supports cutbacks in defense
spending, jobs programs, increased
corporate taxes and the nationalization
of major industries.
Elizabeth Martinez, the Peace and
Freedom candidate for governor, has
focused her campaign on the military
policies of the Reagan administration,
according to Armbruster, the cam
paign manager.
"One of the main issues is the way in
which the U.S. government under
Reagan is militarizing this society and
the way it is affecting the people of
California," Armbruster said.
Martinez is a member of the Democ
ratic Worker's Party and previously
worked as a writer for The Nation
magazine, according to Armbruster.
David Wald, the Peace and Free
dom's candidate for the U.S. Senate,
could not be reached for comment.
A right-wing group which qualified
for the California ballot in 1968,
American Independent Party supports
import tariffs, decreased welfare pay
ments, less federal regulation and in
creased defense spending.
Deitrich, has focused her U.S. Se
nate campaign on her proposal to ba
lance the federal budget by decreasing
welfare payments and federal taxes.
Griffen, the party's candidate for
governor, said his campaign is em
phasizing his proposals to give tax
breaks to small businessmen, decrease
welfare payments and impose tariffs on
California imports.
The truck driver said regardless of
the election results, he has already won
a political victory, a victory not over the
Democrats or Republicans, but over
the other third-party candidates.
"We've already won. The party's
growing and it doubled its
membership in the past three years.
We're twice as big as the Libertarians
and four times as big as the Peace and
Freedom party. We've already won."
James Griffen has driven a truck for a
living for more than 20 years. But this
fall, instead of speeding past the small
towns along the way, Griffen stops off
to do a little campaigning.
"I like to stop in the small towns and
just talk to the people. I think we'll get
more votes than people expect. At least
I hope so, because I've worked hard

enough," said the 45-year-old, who is
the American Independent Party's
candidate for governor.
"The party pays for my expenses, but
it costs. It takes a little bit of dedica
tion," said Griffen.
The American Independent Party is
one of three parties, besides the Demo
cratic and the Republican, which are
qualified to place nominees on the
Nov. 2 California ballot. The Peace and
Freedom Party and the Libertarian
Party are the other two.

While traditional party candidates
Mayor Peter Wilson and Gov. Brown,
Mayor Tom Bradley and Attorney
General George Deukmejian, battle
for the U.S. Senate and governor's
seats with multi-million dollar cam
paigns, the third party candidates are
running theirs on shoe-string budgets
financed solely by individual con
tributors.
Most of the third-party candidates
have spent the campaign travelling ac
ross the state, appearing before rotary
clubs, student audiences, and any other
groups that will hear them, reiterating
the proposals that see them apart from
traditional candidates.
Most are holding down jobs while
they run for office. Included among
them are a journeyman silkscreen
printer, a writer, an economics profes
sor, a truck driver and an insurance
salesman.
According to the most recent Los
Angeles Times Poll, the third party
candidates received support from less
than 10 percent of those surveyed.
About 145,000 or 1.3 percent of
California voters are registered as
American Independent. The Peace and
Freedom Party and the Libertarian

Party include 48,993 and 73,438 regis
tered voters respectively.
"Obviously, we don't expect to win
the election," said Jane Armbruster,
media coordinator for Peace and Free
dom governor's candidate Elizabeth
Martinez. "But we expect to send a
message. We want to raise those issues
and begin to build a movement to resist
militarism in this society," she said.
"We want to give these people a
choice who are sick and fed up with
Democratic and Republican spend
itis," said Teresa Deitrich, American
Independent candidate for U.S. Se
