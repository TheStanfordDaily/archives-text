Pitiful aid cuts
Aid cuts are the pits, say University of South
Florida student leaders. They invited SF stu
dents to spit cherry pits into a bowl during a ral
ly for financial aid this fall. The student govern
ment plans to mail the pits to President
Reagan.
I am sure
College students are one target of the latest
promotion craze — the "Valley Girls" fad
based on the hit song by Frank Zappa and his
daughter, Moon Unit. But one college student
is on the other end of the fad. Mike Singer, a
USC junior, is marketing his own "Valley
Girls" calendar, and will soon have a Valley
Girls hotline, featuring tips on fashion, ship
ping and other "hot issues."
Singer says his calendar, called "Totally
Awesome, The 1983 Valley Girls Calendar," is
intended to clean up the image of the up-scale
youth of the Encino V alley. He also hopes to do
some cleaning up of his own, by selling at least
100,000 of the calendars, priced at $5.50 to $7.
The 19-year-old business major is accustomed
to such big numbers — he's been managing his
own stock portfolio since the age of 12.
God and Princeton
A group of Princeton students say God told
them to leave school last spring. And now the
leader of The Church At Princeton, as it is
called, says a nuclear warhead from the Soviet
Union will strike New York City soon.
Najib Khuri, who would have graduated last

spring if he hadn't dropped out during exams,
leads the group of about 12 students. Eight of
his followers left school last spring, say Prince
ton officials. Khuri plans to stay at Princeton
and continue spreading what he says is God's
message. That leaves Princeton officials in a
ticklish position: Khuri can't be barred from
campus, since he has violated no regulations.
Hunt for dope
A dope hunt for a publicity stunt? Two State
University of New York-Binghamton students
seem to think it's a good idea. In an effort to
promote the monthly student news magazine,
they have scheduled a treasure hunt for an
ounce of marijuana.
The co-editors announce in the first issue of
New Speak magazine that the stash is hidden
somewhere on campus, and they gave a series of
clues to aid students in finding the stash. The
clues were apparently complicated: three weeks
after the issue ran, no one had found the dope.
Campus officials are less than thrilled with
the stunt, saying it could produce legal charges
of possession of a controlled substance. How
ever, they can't press charges because there is no
solid evidence. The story said that an "ounce of
weed" was hidden, but that could mean any
thing from pot to dandelions.
Apparently the publicity stunt has worked
well, and the editors are pleased with the
notoriety the magazine has attracted. For their
next hunt, they plan to hide a quart of Jack
Daniels.
Racy cartoons
Suit has been filed by United Features
against two staff members of the University of

Wisconsin-Stevens Point student newspaper
the Pointer, concerning a Pointer take-off on
student health service ads which featured car
toon characters. The student newspaper parody
depicted one pregnant cartoon character and
two others in an intimate position. United Fea
tures claims the characters depicted are Charlie
Brown, Lucy, and Peppermint Patty from the
"Peanuts" strip. It maintains the cartoons are a
lewd use of characters from its family-oriented
comic strip.

Hugs per hour
A new non-competitive, non-violent in
tramural sport has been introduced to Univer
sity of South Carolina: hugging. USC recently
held their second annual Hug-a-Thon through
the Intramurals Dept., an all-day affair in
which participants try to hug as many people as
possible. Each time a contestant hugs someone,
the recipient of the hug is supposed to sign the
contestant's list. Last year the record number of
hugs was 366 in a six-hour period.
Violent cadets
Swordsmen are back at Texas A&M Univer
sity football games this season, after a year's
ban. A&.M officials stopped cadets from carry
ing ceremonial swords during games after one
cadet drew his sword and menaced an opposing
team's cheerleader. The corps commander says
cadets are instructed never to unsheath their
ceremonial swords.
Southern snobbery
University of South Carolina reports that it
can now "turn up its nose" at any other schools
that didn't make it into the Selective Guide to
Colleges. The guide to "265 of the best and most
interesting four-year institutions in the coun
try" — according to the book's introduction —
apparently caused a furor at the University
earlier this year, when that venerated institution
didn't appear in the first edition. In next year's
edition, USC joins three other South Carolina

schools in high ratings for academics, social life
and quality of life.
Ivy co-eds
Concerned women at Princeton responded
unfavorably to an ad for Prospect magazine, a
publication which rates an anti-co-educational
stand, in the Daily Princetonian. As these wom
en point out in their letter to the editor, "Pros
pect writers are hardly subtle about their view of
women at Ivy League institutions." At one
point the publisher states, "It's been 10 years
since the last Ivy League institution went co-ed;
10 years since those eight eastern educational
elite institutions opened their gates and let the
baggage in — and what baggage they brought:
women's centers .. . co-ed eating clubs .. .
female professors...
Cal shortages
After spending two weeks of the quarter liv
ing in hotels, many Berkeley students were still
without housing a few weeks ago. One first-year
student reported spending two weeks of uncer
tainty and close to $300 on interim hotel accom
modations before she was finally notified that
she had been admitted to the university resi
dence halls.
This is a typical example, according to the
Daily Californian, of the thousands of Berkeley
students who suffer each year from Berkeley's
chronic housing shortage. University housing
authorities have said that as of the middle of the
month there remained over 900 names on the
waiting list for residence halls, in addition to an
average of over 500 students going through the
housing office daily in search of housing.
