# Author Rifkin speaks on entropy

Entropy — a concept that is usually confined to
the physical sciences — was given new applications
in fields ranging from energy to economics by au
thor Jeremy Rifkin in Bishop Auditorium on Mon
day night. Rifkin's controversial views on entropy,
which asserts that nature moves towards maximum
randomness, where challenged by Stephen Kline, a
mechanical engineering prof., earlier in the day in a
debate held in Skilling Auditorium.
Rifkin claimed that mankind will be doomed if it
does not consider entropy when allocating natural
resources because the concept implies limits on
potential sources of energy.
Rifkin, author of the recent book "Entropy: A
New World View", said that a corollary to the sec
ond law of thermodynamics, that "any time you
transfer energy you use energy in the process" has
direct economic ramifications. He said that,"The
worst possible thing you can do here is supply side
economics," because the more you produce, the
more you waste. "We're not paying for the value
added into the product, we're paying for the value
lost.
"The ultimate here is what we call the balanced
budget. The ultimate balanced budget is that soci
ety can never consume faster than nature can re
produce," he said.
Rifkin spoke out against genetic engineering be
cause it makes processes "faster than nature's own
rhythm would ever allow.
"Nature has its own periods and speeds," said
Rifkin. "Of course you recycle matter, but at na
ture's speed, not ours. Even when you recycle, you
always pay the bill.
"Our whole world's view is based on mechanism
and speed," contended Rifkin. As evidence of this,

he cited the widespread use of chemical enhance
ment in agriculture. However, Rifkin said prob
lems arise when technological methods of produc
tion are employed without considering their possi
ble long-term effects.
The current use of fossil fuels, Rifkin said, pro
vides an example of inadequate planning because
future disadvantages of its use will far outweigh ad
vantages of current consumption. "After we run
out of fossil fuels we'll have to switch to re
newables," he said. This will be difficult because re
newable energy sources, such as solar power, are in
adequate to meet existing energy needs, he added.
"Now during times of crisis who do we look to as
our salvation, if not a personal God ? Science and
technology," said Rifkin, adding that the fact man
desired to split the atom showed that "we'll die for
our faith." We must "put technology and science in
its proper perspective," he said. "Instead of
progress, we need to look for resacrilization."
Before the speech, Kline criticized Rifkin's initial
assumptions.
"We will not run out of energy, but it will become
more expensive," said Kline, adding that it will not
be the second law of thermodynamics but the ir
responsibility of humans that will cause a crisis.
He also challenged Rifkin's emphasis on energy,
saying that "Socio-technical systems other than
energy multiply our capacities."
When considering energy though, Kline said, one
must consider the future potential of solar energy,
which he claimed Rifkin ignores in his recent book.
As to Rifkin's ignoring of the issue, Kline said, "I
don't know what to say about it —just that it's sil
ly!"
