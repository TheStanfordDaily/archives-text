## The
						Stanford Daily Bottle bill deserves support 
### 
Members of the Stanford crew teams lift oars
throughout the year in preparation for races repre
senting the University. On Sundays following
football games they lift bottles and cans (as well as
other garbage) to make extra money by cleaning
the stadium.
Litter left behind after football games — sum
marily cleaned up by the crew team — provides the
most obvious reason to support Proposition 11, the
bottle bill, which will appear on the ballot this
Tuesday: the litter problem must be tackled.
Proposition 11 requires that all beverage con
tainers sold in California have a refund value of no
less than five cents. Californians throw away over
13,000 beer and soft-drink containers each mi
nute. A deposit system would ensure that these
containers end up back in the hands of distributors,
who could either reuse or recycle them. A five
cent deposit would discourage littering in the first
place and would provide further incentive for
groups and individuals to clean up after them
selves.
The proposition's value goes beyond the aesthe
tic, however. There is a growing awareness of the
fact that all resources are limited, and that many
vital resources are running out fast. Studies made
by various government agencies indicate that the
energy equivalent of nearly 100 million gallons of
oil per ypar can be saved through the reuse or
recycling of the beer and soft-drink containers now
thrown away. Aluminum, steel, plastic, glass and
water resources would be spared as well.

In addition to this, reduced litter in the state
would add up to a big savings for the California
Department of Transportation, which spent over
$13 million last year just to clean up state high
ways. Nearly $100 million is spent on total litter
cleanup each year in this state. Proposition 11
could significantly reduce that bill.
Opposition to the initiative has been led by a
small, well-financed group known as Californians
for Common Sense — perhaps bottlers for
maximized profits would be more appropriate —
which has done everything in its power to distort
what the true effects of the "bottle bill" might be.
Their claims that the proposition will result in in
creased use of fuel and water, less jobs and sanita
tion problems in our grocery stores are largely
unfounded. The major concern of this group is that
they will not be able to pass on many of the costs of
its implementation to consumers.
Nevertheless, there is a grain of truth in their
claims. Prices for soft drinks and beer will be af
fected. Consumers will have to deal with the added
concern of saving their bottles and cans returning
them to the store, as well. In the end, however, this
is a small price to pay in return for quite a few
benefits.
Litter is a growing problem which affects all of us
in a way which is difficult to measure in monetary
terms. But even when economic considerations are
v taken into account, the "bottle bill" still makes
sense. A vote for Proposition 11 is a vote to keep
California as beautiful as it has always been.
