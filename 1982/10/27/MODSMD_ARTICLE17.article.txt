# From on high
## Expression leads to revelation 
### 
Now that I have endeared you with
my byline, I will proceed to exploit that
affection. My topic is personal develop
ment, as individuals and as friends.
You students are young. You have an

It is the same with other things in your life. A
lot is happening now. Lots of impressions of how
it is nice to be together as friends, of what you
enjoy and what you don't. Perhaps there is a lot
of personal passion or turmoil and you need to
understand where it comes from and where it
can go.

abundance of splash upstairs, thanks to
exciting new situations and to the swirl
of chemicals inside that are both the life
and the bane of youth. These conditions
will soon enough start to wane and, un
less that splash establishes a life of its
own, rather than simply being a prod
uct of your conditions, it will start to
wane also.
Securing this depth of feeling is what
I mean by personal development, and I
see its process epitomized by the act of
writing.
Consider the obvious example of
when you are reading something aca
demic. Something occurs to you: how
the view is right or wrong, how it makes
a distinction that lends sophistication
to a view you've come across elsewhere.
You might immediately pick at the
thought and pen in hand, transform the
passing pictures of the mind into the
words which make them clear and

Write and discuss and really figure out what
you feel about a lot of things. Whether it is an
academic subject, or love: express, don't just
feel, else it will not stay with you.

enable you to explore where you go. Or
you might let the thought pass without
bringing it fully to mind. The choice be
comes a matter of habit, and passing up
a notation can become a laziness that is
difficult to overcome. The books you
read become not territory you have ex
plored, but a set of someone else's defi
nitions and conclusions crammed home

like one more dining commons meal. If
it stays with you at all it is probably as
excess baggage.
It is the same with other things in
your life. A lot is happening now. Lots

of impressions of how it is nice to be to
gether as friends, of what you enjoy and
what you don't. Perhaps there is a lot of
personal passion or turmoil and you
need to understand where it comes from
and where it can't go. Don't just feel it.

Someday you may find yourself in bed with
someone you really want to be close to, but you
won't fee I like you are together. You? II ask your
self" where is the passion? The flow of emotion
and togetherness?" You?II wonder if you art
dull.

Learn to express, with others or to
yourself, or you won't sort it out. It will
all just go by, like the pages of the book
whose inspirations you failed to engage.
Until it is all one polished surface and
you have no key to it.
If you have learned to write, though,

if you have explored many opinions
and feelings with your pen, then picking
up a pen is like putting on scuba gear.
You can dive right in. Like some people
find that the slightly altered perceptions
of drugs enable one to slip through the
polished surfaces and open up a world
of revelations. Not to trivialize drugs,
but the person who has learned to ex-

plore things with a pen is way ahead.
There is nothing narrowly intellec
tual about the sort of development I am
discussing. It has to do with basic ques
tion of who you are and what you can
see in the world.
Someday you may find yourself in
bed with someone you know you really
want to be close to, but you won't feel
like you are together. You'll ask your
self "where is the passion? The flow of
emotion and togetherness?" You'll
wonder if you are dull. You'll say that
you love her (him), but when you try to
call up just what that word means all
you get is other words. You know it's
supposed to be so lucid, with everything
you feel flowing from your fingertips,
and you suddenly realize that you un
derstand nothing. That your own feel
ings are as much a haze as that macro
economics course you took senior year.
Your own values and beliefs just a pile

of junk, because you never gave any
thing to them. You just watched it all go
by. Like sitting through the course
without taking any notes. Stanford will
have been the good novel you read once
but whose words you can't quite re
member. And now everything is com
monplace. Like a room with no doors.
Write and discuss and really figure
out what you feel about a lot of things.
Whether it is an academic subject, or
love: express, don't just feel, else it will
not stay with you. Your feelings will re
main a creature of the situation, which
only the situation can conjure for you,
but the situation will be gone. Feelings
that you do engage and find how to ex
press become a part of you. They are
your paints, and with them you will find
a world teeming with color and life. A
world which grows.

Securing this depth of feeling is what
I mean by personal development, and I
see its process epitomized by the act of
writing.
Consider the obvious example of
when you are reading something aca
demic. Something occurs to you: how
the view is right or wrong, how it makes
a distinction that lends sophistication
to a view you've come across elsewhere.
You might immediately pick at the
thought and pen in hand, transform the
passing pictures of the mind into the
words which make them clear and

you feel about a lot of things. Whether it is an
academic subject, or love: express, don't just
feel, else it will not stay with you.

enable you to explore where you go. Or
you might let the thought pass without
bringing it fully to mind. The choice be
comes a matter of habit, and passing up
a notation can become a laziness that is
difficult to overcome. The books you
read become not territory you have ex
plored, but a set of someone else's defi
nitions and conclusions crammed home

like one more dining commons meal. If
it stays with you at all it is probably as
excess baggage.
It is the same with other things in
your life. A lot is happening now. Lots

of impressions of how it is nice to be to
gether as friends, of what you enjoy and
what you don't. Perhaps there is a lot of
personal passion or turmoil and you
need to understand where it comes from
and where it can't go. Don't just feel it.

Someday you may find yourself in bed with
someone you really want to be close to, but you
won't fee I like you are together. You? II ask your
self" where is the passion? The flow of emotion
and togetherness?" You?II wonder if you art
dull.

Learn to express, with others or to
yourself, or you won't sort it out. It will
all just go by, like the pages of the book
whose inspirations you failed to engage.
Until it is all one polished surface and
you have no key to it.
If you have learned to write, though,

if you have explored many opinions
and feelings with your pen, then picking
up a pen is like putting on scuba gear.
You can dive right in. Like some people
find that the slightly altered perceptions
of drugs enable one to slip through the
polished surfaces and open up a world
of revelations. Not to trivialize drugs,
but the person who has learned to ex-

plore things with a pen is way ahead.
There is nothing narrowly intellec
tual about the sort of development I am
discussing. It has to do with basic ques
tion of who you are and what you can
see in the world.
Someday you may find yourself in
bed with someone you know you really
want to be close to, but you won't feel
like you are together. You'll ask your
self "where is the passion? The flow of
emotion and togetherness?" You'll
wonder if you are dull. You'll say that
you love her (him), but when you try to
call up just what that word means all
you get is other words. You know it's
supposed to be so lucid, with everything
you feel flowing from your fingertips,
and you suddenly realize that you un
derstand nothing. That your own feel
ings are as much a haze as that macro
economics course you took senior year.
Your own values and beliefs just a pile

of junk, because you never gave any
thing to them. You just watched it all go
by. Like sitting through the course
without taking any notes. Stanford will
have been the good novel you read once
but whose words you can't quite re
member. And now everything is com
monplace. Like a room with no doors.
Write and discuss and really figure
out what you feel about a lot of things.
Whether it is an academic subject, or
love: express, don't just feel, else it will
not stay with you. Your feelings will re
main a creature of the situation, which
only the situation can conjure for you,
but the situation will be gone. Feelings
that you do engage and find how to ex
press become a part of you. They are
your paints, and with them you will find
a world teeming with color and life. A
world which grows.
