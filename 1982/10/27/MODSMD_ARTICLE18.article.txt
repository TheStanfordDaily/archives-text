## ASSU budget 
### 
The lack of cost-consciousness and
cost-effectiveness displayed by our
ASSU student financial manager dis
turbs me (Daily, Oct. 21). It is to Bob
Brody's credit that he recognizes that
the 1982-83 ASSU budget must be re
duced in light of the fact that it will in
cur a deficit of approximately $ 19,000 if
left unchanged. But what I cannot un
derstand is why, given that Brody open
ly acknowledges this very real problem,
he can list possible cuts totaling only
about $4000 â€” what's more, that this
"is not cutting fat, it's cutting essen
tials."
It is in times of deficits and adversity
that we must carefully redefine our no
tion of what exactly are essential ser
vices. If there are $19,000 worth of ser
vices which we cannot pay for, then
they are the fat which must be cut away.
The liberal mentality of "let's have a
service for everything" is great, but
somebody has to pay for it. Let's keep
this in mind not only for our own sake,
but especially in cases where we have
the power to make decisions regarding
the expenditure of other peoples' mon
ey.
