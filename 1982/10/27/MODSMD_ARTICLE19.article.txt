## Events in Italy easily misinterpreted 
### 
It is very unfortunate that the recent criticism directed
toward Israel tends to be interpreted, by Jewish people and
others, as reflective of a growing spirit of anti-Semitism
within the Western world.
In his article "Anti-Semitism grows in Italy" (Daily, Oct.
19), Alex Alben attempts to present the brutal terrorist at
tack that occurred in Rome on October 9, as a result of vari
ous events taking place in Italy after the Beirut massacre.
Namely, Yasir Arafat's meeting with Pope John Paul and
various leaders of the Italian government. This and other
episodes, in his opinion, are symptomatic of "recent anti-
Jewish undertones in Italian society."
A more profound knowledge of the political and social re
ality of Italy would have led to a different interpretation of
Arafat's meetings, the actions of the Italian unions and other
events. Apparently, Alben is not aware of all the facts behind
the episodes which he describes. t
Only one of the major Italian unions (CGIL) participated
in the boycott referred to, while the other two (CISL and
UIL) did not. To view this partial boycott as an expression of
anti-Semitism is to fail to understand that this form of pro
test is very common (unlike in the United States) among
workers. It is estimated that many hundred working hours
per year are used by Italian unions for the purpose of protest
ing policies being implemented in such diverse nations as Po
land, Chile, South Africa and China. In other words, the
boycott of Israeli planes and ships was not such an unusual
event.
Alben goes on to state that "doubts linger concerning the
wisdom of having Arafat at the Vatican and at a session of
the Italian parliament where he received a standing ova
tion." Arafat did not receive a standing ovation from the
Italian parliament nor an invitation to speak there for that
matter. He had been invited by representatives of the Con
ference of the World Interparliamentary Union comprising

elected officials of 86 nations that was holding its meeting in
Rome. His standing ovation thus assumes a different signifi
cance.
The decision to meet with Arafat was a difficult one for the
pope. In reading the major Italian newspapers like the Cor
riere delta Sera and La Stampa one does not perceive any
intention or inclination by the pope to receive "with almost
regal honors" the Palestinian Liberation Organization
(PLO) spokesman or to "bolster Arafat in his role as a na
tional leader ..." as Alben writes. Quite the opposite. In
fact, the official Vatican press communique released after
the meeting even fails to qualify Arafat as leader of the PLO.
Pope John Paul's intention was to contribute to the peace
ful solution of the tragic 30" year dispute. That was also the
purpose of his most recent meeting with President Amin
Gemayel of Lebanon.
The majority of Italians believe that the PLO (as repre
sentatives of all Palestinian people) should participate in the
peaceful solution of the problems in the Mideast. 1 find it sad [
that Begin and his cabinet chose to accuse the Vatican of
"having done nothing to prevent the Nazi crimes during
World War II" as a means of discouraging the meeting be-
tween the pope and Arafat. Or that the Arab nations accused
Israel as a whole for the Beirut massacre.
At the time of the Israeli invasion in Lebanon I strongly
believed in not associating any criticisms I had for the poli
cies of the Begin government with the Jewish population in
Israel or elsewhere. Likewise, it is profoundly unjust to hold
Pope John Paul, the Italian people and press even partially
responsible for the Rome terrorist attack.
Arafat's visit was intended to open new avenues of
dialogue in order to pacify and not exasperate the existing
conflicts. Let's leave it that way.

peaceful solution of the problems in the Mideast. 1 find it sad [
that Begin and his cabinet chose to accuse the Vatican of
"having done nothing to prevent the Nazi crimes during
World War II" as a means of discouraging the meeting be-
tween the pope and Arafat. Or that the Arab nations accused
Israel as a whole for the Beirut massacre.
At the time of the Israeli invasion in Lebanon I strongly
believed in not associating any criticisms I had for the poli
cies of the Begin government with the Jewish population in
Israel or elsewhere. Likewise, it is profoundly unjust to hold
Pope John Paul, the Italian people and press even partially
responsible for the Rome terrorist attack.
Arafat's visit was intended to open new avenues of
dialogue in order to pacify and not exasperate the existing
conflicts. Let's leave it that way.
