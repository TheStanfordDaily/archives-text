# Stats show decline in parking tickets
## 
### DAVID SANCHEZ 
Automobile owners parking on campus received substan
tially fewer parking tickets this year than they did last year,
according to DATACOM, the Santa Clara Countyh statis
tics bureau. Marina Neris, theDATACOM Vice President
in charge of West Coast Operations, said that tickets issues
on the Stanford campus have decreased from 52,236 cita
tions in the fiscal year ending in September 1981 to 45,800
in the fiscal year ending in September 1982.
The Santa Clara County Department of Revenue re
ported that the parking tickets issued from June 30,1981 to
June 30, 1982 represented about 14 percent of the total
number of tickets issued in the country. Rich Atkinson,
director of revenue for Santa Clara County, said the fines
paid for Stanford parking citations in the last fiscal year
have added about $306,500 to the County coffers.
Stanford Police Chief Marvin Herrington said he was
encouraged by the decreasing number of parking tickets.
"I would hope that what that indicates is that people are
paying attention to the tickets," Herrington said. "The
object here is not to write tickets, but it is to make people
park where they are supposed to," he added.
Herrington speculated that part of the reason for this
decrease might be that the stock of parking places and their
distribution on campus have remained fairly constant in the

last two years. New buildings are no longer displacing park
ing places as often as they had been when the University was
building more strucutres, he said.
Herrington said the decrease might also be due to the
increase in the fines charged for parking violations in the
last two years — first, from $2 to $5, then to $7.
Atkinson and Neris noted that people ticketed on campus
are unusually delinquent in paying their parking fines. At
kinson attributed this to "the semi-transient nature of the
population," and to the fact that many of the motor vehicles
parked here have out-of-state registrations.
"Students virtually thumb their nose at the authorities
because they are out-of-state," said Neris. But she did not
entirely attribute the high frequency of parking violations
here to out-of-state students. According to Neris, the av
ailability of parking spaces on campus is the primary factor.
As director of revenues, Atkinson can recommend that
certain habitual offenders be prosecuted by the district
attorney. He has compiled a list of about 1600 Stanford
automobile owners who have collected five parking tickets
or more and owe an average of about $ 150 to $200 in fines.
Included on this list are a few individuals who owe close to
$5000.
Though the number of tickets issued here has declined
significantly in the last two years, the
Stanford Police Department issues
many more parking tickets than do its
counterparts at San Jose State Univer
sity and at the University of Santa
Clara.
Russell Lunsford, police information
officer at San Jose State University, re
ported that an average of 42 parking
citations per day were issued on the San
Jose campus in 1982 from February to
July. Parking on that campus is re
served solely for university employees.
The Public Safety Officers at the

University of Santa Clara only issue
about 20 to 25 parking tickets per day,
according to Peter Kabitsis, swing shift
sergeant of the Public Safety Depart
ment.
This is much lower than the average
127 tickets issued per day here last
year. Since this figure included the
summer months, when fewer people
parked on campus, the number of tic
kets issued per day while the University
was in session was actually higher than
the overall average.
