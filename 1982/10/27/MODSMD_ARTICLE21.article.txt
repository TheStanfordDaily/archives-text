# Earthquake threats not just small trembles

### STEPHANIE SANDBERG 
You will probably hear something
— the shy tinkle of wine glasses as they
nervously dance towards each other on
wobbly stems, or the surprised gurgle
from the fishtank as it uncertainly tilts
to slosh water over its trembling lip —
before you actually feel the tumultuous
vibrations of the next earthquake.
How well one is prepared to deal
with its potential dangers can make
the difference between those who will
afterwards wear the"I survived the Big
One" t-shirts and those who won't.
It was to help build such an aware
ness in the Stanford community that
the Department of Public Safety spon
sored "Earthquake Preparedness
Week" last week. The activities con
sisted of a series of five free public pro
grams, including presentations and lec
tures by earthquake specialists, as well
as displays both in Meyer Library and
on White Plaza. The Blume Earth
quake Engineering Center also held an
open house as part of the project's aim

to make the week interesting and in
formative for "lay quakers" at every
level of understanding.
The major theme of the week's pres
entations was simply that the threat of
an earthquake striking is an ever
present one — and a person can never
be too prepared to meet it.
In California, earthquakes of
Richter magnitude five or greater,
large enough to cause damage to build
ings, occur on the average two or three
times a year. Because they are among
the most frightening and devastating
natural phenomenon, earthquakes
often cause its victims to panic. This
was the subject of the first part of
"Earthquakes Do's and Don't," a film
shown as part of the week's festivities.
The subject of the slide show which
followed the film was model readiness.
It began with a look at the toppled
Stanford gates of 1906 — and served as
a reminder that the danger from earth
quakes is rapidly growing. According
to Haresh Shah, co-director of the

Blume Center, the number and size of
earthquakes is not changing, but grow
ing population and spreading urban
ization means that more and more peo
ple are exposed to the coming earth
quakes.
The 1906 population of the San
Francisco Bay Area was about 500,000
while the entire state included two mil
lion people; however, approximately
24 million people reside inside Califor
nia's borders today. Shah pointed out
in his pamphlet and in his talk last
Tuesday night that whereas about 700
people died in 1906, studies predict a
life loss of 3000 to 10,000 when and if
the next big earthquake strikes.
"(In) eight years," said Professor
Robert Kovach, "there is a 50-50
chance of a major quake — the size of
the 1906 in San Francisco — taking
place in the next eight years."
The Pacific and the North American
plates, two of seven such geological
sections which make up the earth, carry

on their feud almost directly under the
tranquil Stanford setting: an aerial in
frared slide showed the long linear scar
that is the San Andreas fault, on which
Daly City, Woodside and Burlingame
stand today. Many earthquake experts
believe the years of friction and shifting
will eventually bring Los Angeles and
San Francisco side by side. In over
twice that time Los Angeles will have
disappeared altogether, while the Bay
Area will reside somewhere in Mexico,
according to quake experts.
Chief of Police Marvin Herrington
spoke Wed nesday and
Thursday concerning Stanford's pre
paredness in the event of an earth
quake. Herrington created a situation
following a 'major' earthquake: the
networks would break down — gas,
water and phone — both highways, 280
and 101, would be blocked by fallen ov
erpassed and Stanford would be cut off
for at least 72 hours before outside help
be obtained.

open house as part of the project's aim

to make the week interesting and in
formative for "lay quakers" at every
level of understanding.
The major theme of the week's pres
entations was simply that the threat of
an earthquake striking is an ever
present one — and a person can never
be too prepared to meet it.
In California, earthquakes of
Richter magnitude five or greater,
large enough to cause damage to build
ings, occur on the average two or three
times a year. Because they are among
the most frightening and devastating
natural phenomenon, earthquakes
often cause its victims to panic. This
was the subject of the first part of
"Earthquakes Do's and Don't," a film
shown as part of the week's festivities.
The subject of the slide show which
followed the film was model readiness.
It began with a look at the toppled
Stanford gates of 1906 — and served as
a reminder that the danger from earth
quakes is rapidly growing. According
to Haresh Shah, co-director of the

Blume Center, the number and size of
earthquakes is not changing, but grow
ing population and spreading urban
ization means that more and more peo
ple are exposed to the coming earth
quakes.
The 1906 population of the San
Francisco Bay Area was about 500,000
while the entire state included two mil
lion people; however, approximately
24 million people reside inside Califor
nia's borders today. Shah pointed out
in his pamphlet and in his talk last
Tuesday night that whereas about 700
people died in 1906, studies predict a
life loss of 3000 to 10,000 when and if
the next big earthquake strikes.
"(In) eight years," said Professor
Robert Kovach, "there is a 50-50
chance of a major quake — the size of
the 1906 in San Francisco — taking
place in the next eight years."
The Pacific and the North American
plates, two of seven such geological
sections which make up the earth, carry

on their feud almost directly under the
tranquil Stanford setting: an aerial in
frared slide showed the long linear scar
that is the San Andreas fault, on which
Daly City, Woodside and Burlingame
stand today. Many earthquake experts
believe the years of friction and shifting
will eventually bring Los Angeles and
San Francisco side by side. In over
twice that time Los Angeles will have
disappeared altogether, while the Bay
Area will reside somewhere in Mexico,
according to quake experts.
Chief of Police Marvin Herrington
spoke Wed nesday and
Thursday concerning Stanford's pre
paredness in the event of an earth
quake. Herrington created a situation
following a 'major' earthquake: the
networks would break down — gas,
water and phone — both highways, 280
and 101, would be blocked by fallen ov
erpassed and Stanford would be cut off
for at least 72 hours before outside help
be obtained.
