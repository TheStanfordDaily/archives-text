Fetterman honored twice
David Fetterman, a senior internal
auditor in the Internal Audit Department
and a frequent lecturer in the Anthropology
Department and School of Education, was
elected to the New York Academy of Sci
ences and was awarded the 1981 Praxis Pub
lication Award.
Fetterman's election to the academy is a
result of his educational and professional
qualifications, which include research in the
areas of alternative education for dropouts,
gifted education, migrant education and
medical anthropology.
The Praxis Award is given to the person
who best translates "anthropological
knowledge into action," especially into real
world applications. Fetterman has re
searched a federal program designed to keep
inner-city students from dropping out of
school and to help drop-outs re-enter.
The program received a citation from the
Department of Labor and in 1978, the de
partment hired Fetterman to see whether or
not the program could be successfully dupli
cated. Fetterman discovered that the treat
ment program was somewhat biased be
cause the children in the program were sepa
rated from those not in the group, and the
control group was ineffective.
Because of the pressures applied to a fed
erally funded program, only the "best" of
the drop-outs were allowed to enter the al
ternate high school that had been set up. Ap
plicants had to take a series of tests and have
interviews to determine their potential as
students.

When a decision was reached, the student
was informed, and those who had not been
enrolled and were in the control group
tended to lose enthusiasm and thereby lower
the control group's rating.
Fetterman suggested that no student be
denied access to the program, no matter
what the federal funding qualifications de
manded.
The two basic influences applied to the
children in their neighborhood presented
different benefits, said Fetterman. The child
who went to school would have little poten
tial in his poverty-sticken surroundings.
However, the criminally-oriented child
could have a "successful" life by defying the
system. Understanding of these influences
came only after Fetterman's car had been
robbed in the neighborhood where he was
working.
Fetterman sees his role as that of "an in
termediary, an interpreter of behavior that
very few people see, or are allowed to see,"
he said.

"American" film to be shown
"American Pictures," a movie of Ameri
ca's social underworld will be shown free of
charge tomorrow in Kresge Auditorium.
Part one will be shown at 6:30 p.m. and part
two at 8:45 p.m.
The movie, which is co-sponsored by the
Afro-American Studies Program, the Stan
ford Progressive Alliance (SPA), the Stan
ford Workshop on Political and Social Is
sues (SWOPSI), documents the Jacob
Holdt's five-year journey through American
societies.
Because the movie depicts all levels of so
ciety, Holdt shows, in the words of film critic
Richard Martin, that "each of us, white or
black, leftist or rightist, poor or rich, are lim
ited by specific class ideologies, and subject
to narrow-mindedness."
While gathering his information, Holdt
hitchhiked throughout the United States
and sold his blood twiced a week to pay for
film for his camera.
Episodes of this film seem brutal because
"people in this country are so used to seing
artificial violence on TV that they can't con
front real violence," says Holdt.
Tomorrow, Holdt and two assistants will
conduct a seminar on racism from 1-3 p.m.
. in the Forum Room of Meyer Library.
Mexican novelist to speak
Juan Rulfo, a noted Mexican writer, will
speak at 7:30 p.m. in Room 2 of the History
Corner on Nov. 4.
As a writer who "works with language
that seems primitive, the language of
peasants and obscure provicial types,"
Rulfo's work has been compared to that of
American writer William Faulkner.
As an orphan in Guadalajara, Rulfo was
exposed to the characters that he clearly de
picts in his novels and short stories. He pub
lished his first work in 1953 and has since
then been honored by international writers
organizations.
The Spanish and Portugese departments

and the Center for Latin American Studies
are sponsoring this writer's visit.
Serra House plans move
Serra House, the home of the Center for
Research on Women (CROW), the feminist
studies program, and Signs, a journal of
women in culture and society, will be moved
in late October from its prsent site on Jordan
Way to a new location near the Law School.
Built as University President David Starr
Jordan's retirement home in 1924, the house
is being moved to make room for a new cool
ing tower and a proposed cogeneration plant
that will be able to produce both steam and
electricity from a single fuel. Although the
move will cost an estimated $696,000, the ex
penses will be charged to the profits that the
plant will make.
An alternative project that called for the
destruction of Serra House was discarded
because of the University's wish to preserve
this historic building. Construction of a new
facility would have been less expensive, but
would have taken 15 months to complete as
opposed to four months to relocate.
While the relocation is in process,
CROW, feminist studies, and Signs will be
housed in the Old Chemistry Building with
no telephone number changes.
Researchers want volunteers
A team of researchers in the cardiology
department will attempt to find out if a drug
taken by many heart disease sufferers is ac
tually impeding their ability to get in shape
again.
Beta blockers, the drugs in question, are'
administered to lower the heart's blood pres
sure and oxygen use. Sold under such names
as atenolol and propranolol, the drugs ac
count for 5370 million in revenue each year.
Incoming chemical messages that tell the
heart to increase blood prssure are halted by
the beta blockers.

Because of inconclusive research, the
Stanford Heart Disease Prevention Program
is looking for "45 healthy but sedentary men
between 20 and about 40 years old who will
volunteer to take beta blockers while simul
taneously starting an exercise program."
The volunteers will be divided into three
groups. The first and second groups will re
ceive different types of blockers while the
third group will take a placebo. The drugs
"pose no significant risks to healthy volun
teers," although there are potential side ef
fects.
Volunteers will be paid $200 for their par
ticipation in the program. Twenty-five
dollars will be paid after the volunteer passes
a physical screening, and the remaining
$175 when the experiment has been com
pleted.
Anyone interested in volunteering should
contact Mike Savin or Elaine Gordon at
497-6461. There will be an orientation meet
ing at 7 p.m. on Nov. 3 at 730 Welsh Road,

speak at 7:30 p.m. in Room 2 of the History
Corner on Nov. 4.
As a writer who "works with language
that seems primitive, the language of
peasants and obscure provicial types,"
Rulfo's work has been compared to that of
American writer William Faulkner.
As an orphan in Guadalajara, Rulfo was
exposed to the characters that he clearly de
picts in his novels and short stories. He pub
lished his first work in 1953 and has since
then been honored by international writers
organizations.
The Spanish and Portugese departments

and the Center for Latin American Studies
are sponsoring this writer's visit.
Serra House plans move
Serra House, the home of the Center for
Research on Women (CROW), the feminist
studies program, and Signs, a journal of
women in culture and society, will be moved
in late October from its prsent site on Jordan
Way to a new location near the Law School.
Built as University President David Starr
Jordan's retirement home in 1924, the house
is being moved to make room for a new cool
ing tower and a proposed cogeneration plant
that will be able to produce both steam and
electricity from a single fuel. Although the
move will cost an estimated $696,000, the ex
penses will be charged to the profits that the
plant will make.
An alternative project that called for the
destruction of Serra House was discarded
because of the University's wish to preserve
this historic building. Construction of a new
facility would have been less expensive, but
would have taken 15 months to complete as
opposed to four months to relocate.
While the relocation is in process,
CROW, feminist studies, and Signs will be
housed in the Old Chemistry Building with
no telephone number changes.
Researchers want volunteers
A team of researchers in the cardiology
department will attempt to find out if a drug
taken by many heart disease sufferers is ac
tually impeding their ability to get in shape
again.
Beta blockers, the drugs in question, are'
administered to lower the heart's blood pres
sure and oxygen use. Sold under such names
as atenolol and propranolol, the drugs ac
count for 5370 million in revenue each year.
Incoming chemical messages that tell the
heart to increase blood prssure are halted by
the beta blockers.

Because of inconclusive research, the
Stanford Heart Disease Prevention Program
is looking for "45 healthy but sedentary men
between 20 and about 40 years old who will
volunteer to take beta blockers while simul
taneously starting an exercise program."
The volunteers will be divided into three
groups. The first and second groups will re
ceive different types of blockers while the
third group will take a placebo. The drugs
"pose no significant risks to healthy volun
teers," although there are potential side ef
fects.
Volunteers will be paid $200 for their par
ticipation in the program. Twenty-five
dollars will be paid after the volunteer passes
a physical screening, and the remaining
$175 when the experiment has been com
pleted.
Anyone interested in volunteering should
contact Mike Savin or Elaine Gordon at
497-6461. There will be an orientation meet
ing at 7 p.m. on Nov. 3 at 730 Welsh Road,

Fetterman honored twice
David Fetterman, a senior internal
auditor in the Internal Audit Department
and a frequent lecturer in the Anthropology
Department and School of Education, was
elected to the New York Academy of Sci
ences and was awarded the 1981 Praxis Pub
lication Award.
Fetterman's election to the academy is a
result of his educational and professional
qualifications, which include research in the
areas of alternative education for dropouts,
gifted education, migrant education and
medical anthropology.
The Praxis Award is given to the person
who best translates "anthropological
knowledge into action," especially into real
world applications. Fetterman has re
searched a federal program designed to keep
inner-city students from dropping out of
school and to help drop-outs re-enter.
The program received a citation from the
Department of Labor and in 1978, the de
partment hired Fetterman to see whether or
not the program could be successfully dupli
cated. Fetterman discovered that the treat
ment program was somewhat biased be
cause the children in the program were sepa
rated from those not in the group, and the
control group was ineffective.
Because of the pressures applied to a fed
erally funded program, only the "best" of
the drop-outs were allowed to enter the al
ternate high school that had been set up. Ap
plicants had to take a series of tests and have
interviews to determine their potential as
students.

When a decision was reached, the student
was informed, and those who had not been
enrolled and were in the control group
tended to lose enthusiasm and thereby lower
the control group's rating.
Fetterman suggested that no student be
denied access to the program, no matter
what the federal funding qualifications de
manded.
The two basic influences applied to the
children in their neighborhood presented
different benefits, said Fetterman. The child
who went to school would have little poten
tial in his poverty-sticken surroundings.
However, the criminally-oriented child
could have a "successful" life by defying the
system. Understanding of these influences
came only after Fetterman's car had been
robbed in the neighborhood where he was
working.
Fetterman sees his role as that of "an in
termediary, an interpreter of behavior that
very few people see, or are allowed to see,"
he said.

"American" film to be shown
"American Pictures," a movie of Ameri
ca's social underworld will be shown free of
charge tomorrow in Kresge Auditorium.
Part one will be shown at 6:30 p.m. and part
two at 8:45 p.m.
The movie, which is co-sponsored by the
Afro-American Studies Program, the Stan
ford Progressive Alliance (SPA), the Stan
ford Workshop on Political and Social Is
sues (SWOPSI), documents the Jacob
Holdt's five-year journey through American
societies.
Because the movie depicts all levels of so
ciety, Holdt shows, in the words of film critic
Richard Martin, that "each of us, white or
black, leftist or rightist, poor or rich, are lim
ited by specific class ideologies, and subject
to narrow-mindedness."
While gathering his information, Holdt
hitchhiked throughout the United States
and sold his blood twiced a week to pay for
film for his camera.
Episodes of this film seem brutal because
"people in this country are so used to seing
artificial violence on TV that they can't con
front real violence," says Holdt.
Tomorrow, Holdt and two assistants will
conduct a seminar on racism from 1-3 p.m.
. in the Forum Room of Meyer Library.
