## Booters fall to Dominquez Hills 
### STEVE ODELL 
The Stanford men's soccer team lost
a frustrating 3-1 overtime game to Cal
State-Dominguez Hills in the first of a
two-game road trip Monday. The Car
dinal will face No. 12 UCLA today in
Westwood at 2 p.m.
The loss was precipitated by the out
standing play of Dominguez Hills for
ward Mike Broki, who scored three go
als, and the fact that the Cardinal was
missing two starters because of in
juries. Midfielder Angel Vasquez was
out with a stress fracture and fullback
Doug Clark was absent due to a pulled
muscle he suffered last Saturday
against St. Mary's. Both are questiona
ble for today's game.
"We outplayed them," senior
fullback Mark Talkington said. "But
things just didn't go our way. Their as
sistant coach (Marwan Assad) came up
to me after the game and said they
couldn't have stayed on the field with
us even if they would have played with

12 players."
Stanford outshot Dominguez Hills, a
Division II school, by almost a two
to-one margin, 25-13, yet only con
nected on one attempt.
Freshman walk-on Rob West took a
pass from Todd Rafalovich and headed
in a goal with just over a minute to play
to tie the score at 1-1.
Dominguez Hills struck quickly in
the first of the two 10-minute overtime
periods, when Broki scored his second
goal. The deficit put Stanford in a
pressure situation where the Cardinal
was forced to pull up its defense in an
attempt to score the equalizer.
The effort failed and with one mi
nute remaining and goalkeeper Willie
Burkhardt out of position due to the
change in strategy, Broki hammered in
his third score of the game to make the
final margin.
Both teams were effective defen
sively in the first half, playing to a
scoreless tie. Broki scored his first goal

shortly after halftime, receiving a cross
pass and slamming the go-ahead score
past Burkhardt.
Stanford missed many opportunities
throughout the game, hitting the goal
post or crossbar on six different shot
attempts. Casio Conceicao kicked a
shot which appeared to hit the post and
a fullback's hand simultaneously,
which would have resulted in a penalty
kick for the Cardinal. The linesman cal
led a hand penalty, but the referee
overruled him and play continued.
The loss dropped Stanford's record
to 12-3-1, and puts even more impor
tance on the outcome of the UCLA
game today.
"They're really good and deserving
of their national ranking," assessed
Talkington. "To stay in play-off con
tention, we'll need to beat them."

of San Francisco on Sunday at Maloney
