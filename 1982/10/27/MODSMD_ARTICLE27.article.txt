## 
### KAREN SPRINGEN 
Nancy Ditz, class of '76 and assistant
to the president of the Alumni Associa
tion, placed tenth in the women's divi
sion of the New York Marathon Sun
day, finishing the race in 2:33:00.
This year Ditz placed first among
women in the San Francisco Marathon,
second in Bay to Breakers and first in
the Bridge to Bridge (from the Bridge
to the Golden Gate Bridge).
*Â» She started running only three years
ago but progressed rapidly. In fact, she
cried the first time she ran the Dish. "I

was running with my husband, but I
couldn't run that far," she said.
Ditz runs an hour or two a day. Be
cause she works full-time at Bowman
Alumni House, she generally runs at
lunch or after work. She often works
out with Angell Field Ancients.
Ditz does not plan to enter more
marathons until 1983. "I'm going to
take it easy for awhile," she said.
Director of water polo Dante De
ttamanti, who has trained and run with
Ditz, said, "It's amazing how much
she's improved ... I don't think I could
keep up with her now."

Dante said Ditz now maintains six
minute miles throughout a 26-mile
marathon. "She's world-class right
now," he said, adding that her time
would have won most marathons a few
years ago.
About half of the 16,000 runners en
tered in the New York Marathon were
women. Ditz finished 326 th overall.
Her husband also entered the New
York marathon. He finished the rac.e in
four and a half hours, including stops
for a beer and a phone call, Ditz said.
