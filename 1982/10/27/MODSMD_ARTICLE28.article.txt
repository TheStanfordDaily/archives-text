# SJS to decide Card postseason
## 
### SID SPAETH 
Stanford finished third in the
Berkeley Invitational women's
field hockey tournament last
weekend and now its fate rests
on a team that beat them Satur
day — San Jose State.
The Spartans travel to North
western this week, and depend
ing on their showing, Stanford
may get an invitation to the na
tional tournament.
"If San Jose does well," coach
Onnie Killefer said, "we might
be going to nationals."
If not, Stanford may be finish
ing its season next week at UC-
Davis.
The Cardinal hosts Long
Beach Friday at 3 p.m. and the
University of Pacific Saturday at
11 a.m. Both games will be at
Roble Field.
Stanford was ranked No. 18 in
the nation in the last coaches'
poll. Killefer is still waiting to see
the new poll, but isconfident that
with a 7-4-1 record, they will
remain in the top 20.
Stanford opened last
weekend's tournament with a
2-1 overtime win over Chico
State.

Chico State opened the scor
ing in the first minute of Friday's
game on a goal by Minoca
Sanano. Stanford tied the game
in the second half when Mary
Donahue scored off of a penalty
corner pass. Becky Howell
picked up an assist on the goal
and the game went into over
time.
The Cardinal dominated the
overtime penalty strokes — simi
lar to a shootout in soccer — out
scoring Chico State 4-1.
Stanford returned to the field
Friday afternoon and ripped
UC-Davis 2-0 in a game that was
not as close as the score indi
cated.
The Cardinal rifled 40 shots at
Davis while Cardinal goalie
Bonny Warner did not have to
make a single wave.
Action got heavier for Stan
ford Saturday when the Cardinal
faced the host U.C. Berkeley.
"The Cal game was a biggie
because the last time we played
them they totally dominated the
game," Killer said.

Jennifer Bleakley opened the
scoring for Stanford taking an as
sist from Karen Chamberlain
and driving it home for 1-0 lead.
Stanford did not score again,
however, and Cal's Renee
Chatas tied the score later in the
half.
Shelly Onstead scored the
game-winner for Cal in the sec
ond half and the Bears were in
the final.
"We were disappointed, but
we played well," Killefer said.
Disaster struck when the Car
dinal faced San Jose State later in
the afternoon. "We had our op
portunities," Killefer said. "We
just couldn't capitalize and ev
erything they did was gold."
San Jose took the game 3-0
but the score was "not indicative
of the game Killefer said.
Jeanie Gilbert opened the
scoring with a goal off of a pen
alty corner in the first half and
followed it with another penalty
score later in the half. Lynn
McManus also scored for the
Spartans.
Cal ripped San Jose 4-0 in the
final.

KEEPING BUSY: Bonny Warner, one of only 200 active participants in the luge competition
in the country, plays goaltender for the Stanford women's field hockey team to keep busy
during the summer months. Warner takes winter quarter off every year to train and compete
in the luge event — a winter Olympic sport in which an athlete rides a sled-like luge down a
tunnel of ice. Warner became interested in the event when she was a torch bearer for the 1980
Winter Olympics in Lake Placid, N.Y-.
