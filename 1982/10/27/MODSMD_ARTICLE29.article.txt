# Pitt regains top ranking
## 
### Associated Press 
Pittsburgh — Pittsburgh is No.
1 again, edging Washington out
of the spot it had held in rhe
Associated Press college football
poll for six consecutive weeks,
but neither team's coach was
particularly excited by the
change.
"It's best to be undefeated. If
you're winning, everything else
takes care of itself," Pitt Coach
Foge Fazio said Monday night.
"As I've been saying all year,
it's the final poll that counts. The
national championship is still our
goal," Washington Coach Don
James said.
Despite an offensive struggle
for Saturday's 14-0 win over un
ranked Syracuse, Fazio said he is
not surprised his Panthers were
back on top.
"Nothing surprises me any
more. Nothing surprises me
about how they vote," he said.
The Huskies received more
first-place votes in the poll re
leased Monday, but Washington
missed the top spot by four
points. Both teams remained
unbeaten and untied.
The Panthers were No. 1 in the
preseason and first regular
season polls, but dropped behind
Washington after beating North
Carolina and then slipped to
third after defeating Florida
State.
Fazio and James said they do
not emphasize poll rankings.
"I'm sure our team will look at
that tomorrow morning and say,
'Wow, that's really great.' But I
don't think anyone's going to do

cartwheels," Fazio said.
"I really haven't given the
polls a whole lot of thought,"
James said.
Yet, Fazio acknowledged the
poll can affect the Panthers's op
ponents.
"If I was coaching a team and
we were unranked and we were
playing the No. 1 team in the
country, that's an added incen
tive. It's easy to get up for that,"
Fazio said.
But James said, "I think we've
been getting everybody's best
shot, but we may have gotten it
anyway."
