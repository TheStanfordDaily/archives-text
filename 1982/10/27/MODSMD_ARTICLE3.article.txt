# Provost fears $3 million deficit
## 
### MIKE HALE Senior staff writer 
The University will be forced to take
extraordinary measures" to manage a
projected $3 million operating budget
deficit for the fiscal year 1982-83 and
to bring the budget back into balance
by 1985, according to Provost Albert
Hastorf.
For the past six years the University
has operated under a balanced or
surplus budget.
Hastorf, speaking at a joint meeting
of the Administrative and Dean's
Councils last week, cited a slower than
expected growth in research volume as
the main reason for the projected de
ficit.
Hastorf told the assembled deans
and vice-presidents the problem
"clearly exceeds our ability to correct it
quickly." Raymond Bacchetti, director
of University budgets said budget cuts
would probably be the primary com
ponent of the long-range strategy for
balancing the operating budget.
Bacchetti, a vice provost,told the
Daily yesterday that the projected de
ficits are "not a grave problem, but a
reasonably serious" one, and they will
be a problem for three or four years.
"We're in the process of finding out
what has to be done," Bacchetti said.
He explained that before cuts are
made, deans and directors will be asked

to examine expenditures in their own
departments and programs and their
suggestions will be taken intoaccount.
It is unlikely cuts will be made in an
across-the-board manner, Bacchetti
said, because of the general feeling that
"the University's strengths should be
preserved." Budget cuts must "make
the University more affordable, while
preserving what makes Stanford, Stan
ford."
Bacchetti refused to speculate on
possible areas to be cut, saying "several
more meetings" will have to take place
before a priority list for reductions is
made. He warned that no part of the
University would be exempt from cuts,
and would not rule out a decrease in
academic programs.
"Unless you can shrink the demands
academic programs make on their
port services, you can't shrink those
support services," he said.
In addition to budget cuts, the Uni
versity will be seeking new sources of
income. The largest single source of
income for the operating budget is stu
dent tuition payments, but Bacchetti
said he thinks it unlikely that tuition
increases will be greater than those
projected by the University last March.
At that time, maximum increases of
inflation plus 6 percent for 1983-84
and inflation plus three percent for
1984-85 and 1985-86 were projected.

Bacchetti called those figures
"higher than we'd like to be, - but ad
mits "we may have to go that high."
Recovery of the indirect costs of
sponsored research is the second
largest revenue source for the budget,
and it is here the University is feeling
the pinch. This year's budget projec
tions assumed an X percent annual
growth in research volume; according
to Bacchetti, the figure for this year
may actually be closer to 5 percent.
The revised indirect cost projections
now show that $f"> million less will be
recovered this year than was expected,
and the situation will probably be
worse in 1983-K4. According to Has
torf, about half of this shortfall of $3
million directly affects the operating
budget; this represents the total
amount of the project J budget deficit.
However, falling research revenues
are not the only cause of the deficit.
Bacchetti said that during the past six
years of balanced budgets, the Univer
sity has often realized a surplus; these
funds have been used for "conditional"
expenses, the most important of which
is the facilities reserve fund. This fund,
which pays for all building and renewal
projects on campus nut covered by re
stricted gifts, may have to be cut by 30
percent over the next three years.

However, falling research revenues
are not the only cause of the deficit.
Bacchetti said that during the past six
years of balanced budgets, the Univer
sity has often realized a surplus; these
funds have been used for "conditional"
expenses, the most important of which
is the facilities reserve fund. This fund,
which pays for all building and renewal
projects on campus nut covered by re
stricted gifts, may have to be cut by 30
percent over the next three years.

The University will be forced to take
extraordinary measures" to manage a
projected $3 million operating budget
deficit for the fiscal year 1982-83 and
to bring the budget back into balance
by 1985, according to Provost Albert
Hastorf.
For the past six years the University
has operated under a balanced or
surplus budget.
Hastorf, speaking at a joint meeting
of the Administrative and Dean's
Councils last week, cited a slower than
expected growth in research volume as
the main reason for the projected de
ficit.
Hastorf told the assembled deans
and vice-presidents the problem
"clearly exceeds our ability to correct it
quickly." Raymond Bacchetti, director
of University budgets said budget cuts
would probably be the primary com
ponent of the long-range strategy for
balancing the operating budget.
Bacchetti, a vice provost,told the
Daily yesterday that the projected de
ficits are "not a grave problem, but a
reasonably serious" one, and they will
be a problem for three or four years.
"We're in the process of finding out
what has to be done," Bacchetti said.
He explained that before cuts are
made, deans and directors will be asked

to examine expenditures in their own
departments and programs and their
suggestions will be taken intoaccount.
It is unlikely cuts will be made in an
across-the-board manner, Bacchetti
said, because of the general feeling that
"the University's strengths should be
preserved." Budget cuts must "make
the University more affordable, while
preserving what makes Stanford, Stan
ford."
Bacchetti refused to speculate on
possible areas to be cut, saying "several
more meetings" will have to take place
before a priority list for reductions is
made. He warned that no part of the
University would be exempt from cuts,
and would not rule out a decrease in
academic programs.
"Unless you can shrink the demands
academic programs make on their
port services, you can't shrink those
support services," he said.
In addition to budget cuts, the Uni
versity will be seeking new sources of
income. The largest single source of
income for the operating budget is stu
dent tuition payments, but Bacchetti
said he thinks it unlikely that tuition
increases will be greater than those
projected by the University last March.
At that time, maximum increases of
inflation plus 6 percent for 1983-84
and inflation plus three percent for
1984-85 and 1985-86 were projected.

Bacchetti called those figures
"higher than we'd like to be, - but ad
mits "we may have to go that high."
Recovery of the indirect costs of
sponsored research is the second
largest revenue source for the budget,
and it is here the University is feeling
the pinch. This year's budget projec
tions assumed an X percent annual
growth in research volume; according
to Bacchetti, the figure for this year
may actually be closer to 5 percent.
The revised indirect cost projections
now show that $f"> million less will be
recovered this year than was expected,
and the situation will probably be
worse in 1983-K4. According to Has
torf, about half of this shortfall of $3
million directly affects the operating
budget; this represents the total
amount of the project J budget deficit.
However, falling research revenues
are not the only cause of the deficit.
