# Goalie Warner braves ice and shots

### LIBBY LEONARD 
California is a place for surf
ing, not sledding. That's why
sophomore Bonny Warner must
trek to snow-covered slopes in
Europe to pursue her favorite
sport.
Warner is no ordinary
bobsledder. She is a luge racer.
Warner got her first glimpse of
luge competition while serving as
a torch bearer for the 1980
Winter Olympics at Lake Placid.
She heard about a luge develop
ment camp and decided to give
the slide a try.
The stocky 5-foot-8 com
munication major has glided her
way to success ever since.
Warner was voted "Rookie of
the Year" in 1981 and compiled
enough seeding points last sason
to become the No. 2 female racer
on the U.S. Luge Association's
World Team.
What started as a hobby
quickly turned into a full-time
committment. Warner began
preparing for the upcoming sea
son in August. Her conditioning
included running, kayaking,
weight lifting and using luges
with wheels.
Because Warner likes "to be
involved in another sport to im
prove reaction time," she is play
ing on Stanford's nationally
ranked field hockey team this
fall.
In November, the talented

athlete will set aside her hockey
stick, pick up a luge, and head for
West Germany to join other
members of the U.S. Luge Team.
Warner expects to spend six to
seven hours a day training in
tensely. Little time is actually
spent on the luge, however, be
cause " We do no more than eight
runs a day," she said. An average
luge run takes 40 to 50 seconds.
Luge races consist of four runs or
heats, the winner being deter
mined by the lowest aggregate
time.
Warner says she enjoys seeing
different countries anc^cultures
overseas, but "missing every
winter quarter is disruptive."
The 21-year-old admitted, "I
don't really mind spending six
years at Stanford, because it's
such a great place to be."
Although luge racing has been
practiced in Europe for decades,
many Americans are unfamiliar
with the sport. According to
Warner, there are only about
200 active lugers in the United
States. Warner attributes the
small number of participants to
the lack of local training
facilities. Lake Placid features
the only approved course in this
country. A new track is being
built in Michigan, however.
The option of going abroad is
too expensive for most luge en
thusiasts. Warner says she will

invest about $7000 into training
for the luge this year. "Being on
the U.S. team only covers about
half of that," Warner said.
The modern luge is a
specialized and costly steel
machine. Designed to accom
modate high speeds, it "looks
like a thing out of the space age,"
said Warner. Measuring about
four feet in length, the luge
weighs up to 50 pounds.
Because of its extreme flexibil
ity, the luge is easily steered
down the narrow chute.
"They're more steerable than a
car," claimed Warner. The
helmsman must be careful, how
ever, because "the slightest
twitch can make the sled veer
into a wall wrong," she said.
Although the luge-is equipped
with no brakes, "There's no
reason to slow down until you
reach the bottom," assured
Warner.
Lunging down a luge track at
speeds reaching 60 miles per
hour "is not as dangerous as
snow skiing," commented
Warner. "Sure, there are
bruises, but I get more of those
playing field hockey."
Warner finds luge racing to be
"fun and exciting, not frighten
ing. There's no time to think
about being scared or cold, be
cause you're always concentrat
ing on how to take the next

turn," Warner said.
Many luge races are held on
prepared tracks made of refrig
erated glare ice. These novel
courses feature steep, banked
curves 10 to 20 feet high along
with straightaways. As the
speeding sled climbs hairpin
turns, it assumes almost a verti
cal position. "It's a real chal
lenge, because you're defying
gravity," Warner said.
Competitive lugers must obey
several stringent rules. After
each run, the racer and sled are
weighed. Warner said that racers
are allowed to wear lead belts,
provided each woman remains
under the 185-pound total
weight limitation. The tempera
ture of the runners is also care
fully tested by race officials.
No doubt Warner leads a
fast-paced life. The native
Californian is coming home at
Christmas, but then it's back to
Lake Placid for the World Luge
Championships in January 1983.
Warner and her three luge
â€¢ teammates will then travel to
Sarajevo, Yugoslavia for the
Olympic trial runs.
Although Warner isn't "look
ing for a medal in her first Olym
pic competition," she is "trying
to rack up lots of experience."
Ask Warner what her plans are
for the 1988 Winter Olympics.
Now, the gold is shining in her
eyes.
