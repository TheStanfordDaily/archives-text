# Sailing team to be represented at nationals

### KATHERINE HUTT Senior staff writer 
"Most parents start their kids
jff with football or baseball, and
nine started me off with sailing,"
laid senior Bill Buckingham —
Stanford sailing team's current
success story.
Buckingham will be racing
igainst the 15 other top col
legiate single-handed sailors in
the country in the National
Championships in Minnetonka,
Minn, this weekend.
Buckingham is not terribly
nervous about the outcome of
this particular regatta.
"Most of the guys I'll be sailing
against I've met once or twice
before," he said. "So it will de
pend on a whole lot of variables.
Maybe things will go my way."
To get this spot, Buckingham
first went through two weeks of
Stanford sailing team elimina
tions, from which four members
were eventually selected. Of the
other three, sophomores Rod
Turner and Eric Engebreth and
freshman Gordon Wanlass,
Wanlass finished eighth nation
ally in the most recent U.S.

Youth Laser Championships
(for ages 18 and under).
The four Stanford sailors then
met 36 others from their district
in the Pacific Coast Champion
ships, held in Mission Bay on
Oct. 8 and 9. The 40 competed
for the two berths from their dis
trict in the National Champion
ships.
Buckingham went into the
qualifiers with a great deal of
confidence. "I knew I'd be in the
top five," he said. "It wasn't a
surprise to be in the top two. It
was nice, but it wasn't a sur
prise."
Given Buckingham's past re
cord, his current position is cer
tainly no surprise. He started
sailing at age eight, and the sport
has been "not a dominant but an
important factor ever since," he
said.
According to sailing team
coach Joe Petrucci, Buckingham
had "a solid freshman year," and
was number two on the team his
sophomore year. That year "his
last race performance pulled the
team up to a 10th place finish
over at the National Champion

ships," said Petrucci.
Last year Buckingham was
studying overseas, at Qiveden,
and thus did not sail with Stan
ford. "Bill's return this year has
rounded out the team," said Pet
rucci.
This is no small compliment
from a coach who believes that
his team is "the longest and the
strongest team on the West
Coast right now."
The figures are certainly
promising. The latest rankings
put the Stanford men's team at
No. 9 and the women's at No. 6
nationally.
In addition, over 100 sailors
went out for the team this fall,
which had to cut to 60 members.
Buckingham noted the contrast
to his freshman year, when he
said that the team consisted of an
elite group of four of five sailors
who discouraged others from
joining.
According to Petrucci, the
current team contains at least 15
strong freshmen, including two
of the top five sailing recruits in
the country. "We are attracting
the top talent in the country,"

Petrucci said.
Petrucci also praised the vete
ran members of the team that
includes "six skippers all of
whom are capable of both steer
ing and winning in a national
championship." Besides Buc
kingham, he cited seniors Brian
May, Carolyn Brown and Scott
Merrill, and sophomores An
drew Gooding and Reinhard
Noack.
Stanford sailing is not a varsity
team, but a club sport, and thus
partially funded by Club Sports.
The greater amount of their
budget is raised through the ef
forts of team members, consiting
of mandatory basketball
cleanups, and solicitation of pa
rents, alumni and friends of the
team.
According to Petrucci, Stan
ford sailing has "embarked upon
our most aggressive fund-raising
year ever," with a goal of
$50,000. The process will go to
what Petrucci designates as his
top priority — acquiring a year
round, open-water sailing facil
ity, including a boathouse, docks
and caretaker facilities.
