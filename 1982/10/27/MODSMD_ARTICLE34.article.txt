# Carlton wins 4th Cy Young
## 
### Associated Press 
New York — Steve Carlton recovered from the
worst start of his career this season to win an un
precedented fourth National League Cy Young
award, it was announced yesterday.
Carlton, of the Philadelphia Phillies, was the
only pitcher in the major leagues to win 20 games
this year, finishing the season with a 23-11 record
and an earned run average of 3.10.
At age 37, Carlton got off to an old man's start,
• losing his first four games. But he won four of his
next five and, once again, was on the form that has
made him the all-time National League and left
handed strikeout king.
Carlton's league-leading 286 strikeouts this sea
son gave him 3434 for his career, only 74 shy of
Walter Johnson's all-time record of 3508. Carlton
should have little trouble breaking the mark next
season, his 17th in the major leagues and 12th with
the Phillies.
Carlton received 112 points in balloting by a
special 24-member panel chosen by the Baseball
Writers Association of America. Runner-up was
Montreal Expos right-hander Steve Rogers, who
received 29 points, followed by Fernando Valen
zuela of Los Angeles, 25V2; Bruce Sutter of St.
Louis, 25; Phil Niekro of Atlanta, 18; Greg Minton
of San Francisco, 4; Joaquin Andujar of St. Louis
and Gene Garber of Atlanta, 1 each, and Marion
Soto of Cincinnati, one-half point.
Carlton received 20 first-place votes and was
named runner-up on the other four ballots. He was
the only pitcher named on all ballots. Sutter re
cieved two of the remaining first-place votes, and
Rogers and Valenzuela recieved one each.
Each member of the panel — two writers from
each NL city — voted for three pitchers, with five
points for first place, three for second and one for

third. One third-place vote was split between Val
enzuela and Soto.
Only three other pitchers — Jim Palmer (1973-
75-76), Tom Seaver (1969-73-75) and Sandy
Koufax (1963-65-66) — have won the award three
times. Carlton won his other Cy Young awards in
1972, 1977 and 1980. Valenzuela won the award
in 1981.
Carlton has struck out 200 or more batters seven
times, leading the league in strikeouts four times.
He struck out a career high 310 batters to lead the
league in 1972, his first with the Phillies after
spending five seasons with St. Louis.
Carlton also led the league in complete games
with 19, innings pitched with 295 2 /j and shutouts
with six. This was Carlton's sixth season with 20 or
more victories. He was eighth in ERA.
