Deficit reaches all-time high
Washington — Consumer prices, held in check by falling mortgage
interest rates, edged up at a low annual inflation rate of 2.1 percent in
September, the government reported yesterday.
At the same time, the Treasury reported that the federal budget deficit
hit a record-high $ 110.7 billion for the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30. The
red-ink spending total was more than $40 billion above the previous record
deficit of $66.4 billion set in 1976.
President Reagan, campaigning in North Carolina with congressional
elections just a week away, hailed the price report and said the inflation rate
should drop even further in the remaining months of 1982.
On the other side of the political fence. House Speaker Thomas "Tip"
O-Ncill (D-Mass.) compared Reagan to Depression-era President Hoover
and said the lower rate of price increases was "a direct result of the worst
recession since the 19305."
The recession, which began in mid-1981, reduced federal tax revenues
and raised outlays for jobless payments and welfare to trigger the largest
deficit in U.S. history.
Some private analysts said the prolonged economic slump contributed to
the sharp decline in the inflation rate this year.
Last month's rise of 0.2 percent in the Consumer Price Index, the
smallest advance since April, brought the rate of increase for the first nine
months of the year to 4.8 percent. This compared to an increase of 8.9
percent in 1981 and 12.4 percent in 1980, the last year of the Carter
administration.
If the price trend of recent months continues, the inflation figure for 1982
may be the lowest in a decade. In 1972 consumer prices went up by only 3.4
percent.
