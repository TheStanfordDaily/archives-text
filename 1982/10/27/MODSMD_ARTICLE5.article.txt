Deficit reaches all-time high
Washington — Consumer prices, held in check by falling mortgage
interest rates, edged up at a low annual inflation rate of 2.1 percent in
September, the government reported yesterday.
At the same time, the Treasury reported that the federal budget deficit
hit a record-high $ 110.7 billion for the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30. The
red-ink spending total was more than $40 billion above the previous record
deficit of $66.4 billion set in 1976.
President Reagan, campaigning in North Carolina with congressional
elections just a week away, hailed the price report and said the inflation rate
should drop even further in the remaining months of 1982.
On the other side of the political fence. House Speaker Thomas "Tip"
O-Ncill (D-Mass.) compared Reagan to Depression-era President Hoover
and said the lower rate of price increases was "a direct result of the worst
recession since the 19305."
The recession, which began in mid-1981, reduced federal tax revenues
and raised outlays for jobless payments and welfare to trigger the largest
deficit in U.S. history.
Some private analysts said the prolonged economic slump contributed to
the sharp decline in the inflation rate this year.
Last month's rise of 0.2 percent in the Consumer Price Index, the
smallest advance since April, brought the rate of increase for the first nine
months of the year to 4.8 percent. This compared to an increase of 8.9
percent in 1981 and 12.4 percent in 1980, the last year of the Carter
administration.
If the price trend of recent months continues, the inflation figure for 1982
may be the lowest in a decade. In 1972 consumer prices went up by only 3.4
percent.
Mortgage interest rates dropped by 1.5 percent in September,
offsetting a 0.5 percent rise in food prices. Gasoline costs,
reflecting low demand and abundant supplies of oil, fell by 0.1
percent.
In a separate report, however, the Department of Labor said
the average worker's buying power dropped by 0.3 percent in
September and was 0.9 percent below the level of a year ago.
Poland cracks down on outcasts
Warsaw, Poland — Parliament enacted laws cracking down on
"social parasites," juvenile delinquents and drunkards yesterday
over the objections of members who said the new laws are aimed at
solidarity union members and other dissidents.
As the bills headed toward approval during a debate in the
460-seat Parliament of the Communist-run government, non
communist Deputy Karol Malcurzynski warned the new measures
could be used against fired workers of the outlawed Solidarity
union, journalists and those purged under martial law.
He called the bills "pernicious and demagogic."
Deputies also appealed privately for political trials of former
leaders now ousted and disgraced, including onetime Communist
Party chief Edward Gierek and his closest assistants, for bad
economic decision-making. The appeal was reported by sources at
the Parliament building.
Prosecutor General Franciszek Rusek, who opened the Parlia
ment session, said passing the laws on work shirkers, juvenile
delinquents and alcoholics "will be of great significance for
strengthening the rule of law and contribute to a stronger fight
against the most dangerous symptoms of social pathology."
The measure on "social parasites," supported by Premier Gen.
Wojciech Jaruzelski, has raised concern among Roman Catholic
Church and intellectual circles because of its strict provisions for
monitoring work and studies. Such laws have been used in the
Soviet Union against dissidents fired from work and then prose
cuted for "social parasitism" because they don't have jobs.
Similar legislation was passed in Czechoslovakia after the
crackdown that followed the Soviet invasion to crush that nation's
liberalization in 1968. Martial law was declared in Poland last Dec.
13.
The measure requires Polish males between the ages of 18 and
45 to say how they earn a living. If they have been unemployed or
not attending school for more than three months, the measure
demands a "satisfactory" explanation.
Israeli overflights resume
Beirut — For the first time in more than a month Israeli jets flew
reconnaissance missions over Lebanon's Bekaa Valley yesterday,
apparently signaling the possibility of an air strike against Syrian
positions there.
The flights began early in the morning and lasted for several
hours, amid reports in Beirut that the Syrians were building up
their forces in the valley, which runs north-south along Lebanon's
eastern border with Syria.
The valley is the Syrians last outpost in Lebanon. They were
driven from Beirut and other parts of the country by Israeli forces
during Israel's summer war against the Palestinians. Palestine Lib
eration Organization guerrillas also remain in the Bekaa, a wide
swath of rich farm land.
The Syrians maintain a force of about 25,000 troops in the valley
and have said they will not pull out of Lebanon until the Israelis*
agree to a simultaneous withdrawal.
The Israeli overflights came after reports here that the Syrians
were deploying heavy tanks and artillery in the valley and two
SAM-9 anti-aircraft batteries on Lebanese territory just west of
the Syrian border.
In the past, the Israelis have retaliated against such missile
deployments with air attacks.
Since its devastating losses during the fighting with the Israelis
this summer, Syria has been replenishing its supplies of Soviet
made weapons. A recent report by U.S. intelligence analysts in
Washington said the Soviet Union has replaced all military equip
ment lost in the war and added more. However, the report also said
the Syrian buildup poses no threat to Israel's military dominance in
the Mideast.
Israeli overflights were almost a daily occurrence over Lebanon
for more than a year before the Israelis invaded June 6, but they
stopped with the September arrival of a multinational peace
keeping force in Beirut.
Israeli jets flew low over Beirut on Sunday afternoon but that
was later described as a tribute to President-elect Bashir Gemayel,
who was assassinated on Sept. 14. The occasion for the Sunday
flights was a memorial service for Gemayel, commemorating the
end of a 40-day mourning period.
The Syrians and the Israelis have periodically traded artillery fire

in the Bekaa in recent weeks. Ihe Israelis have also blamed the
Syrians in the past for allowing Palestinian guerrillas through their
lines for commando raids.
UN avoids ouster of Israel
United Nations — The U.N. General Assembly voted 75-9
yesterday to shelve an Iranian bid to expel Israel from the
Assembly.
Although the Arab nations had backed down from an earlier
decision to seek Israel's expulsion. Iran introduced an amend
ment Monday night to the Credentials Committee report that
would have rejected Israel.
This was the first formal challenge of Israel's credentials in
U.N. history and was attributed largely to the emotions aroused
by the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in June. U.S. Secretary of
State George Shultz earlier threatened a U.S. withdrawal from
the Assembly and a cut-off of U.S. financial support for the
world organization if Israel were expelled.
As debate resumed yesterday afternoon after a morning ad
dress by King Hassan II of Morocco calling for peace in the
Mideast, Finland's Ambassador Ilkka Pastinen rose and, speak
ing for the five Nordic nations, asked that action on the Iranian
amendment be postponed indefinitely.
"We act out of concern for the future of this organization and
its task of bringing peace to the Mideast," Pastinen said.
With Iranian Ambassador Said Rajaie Khorassani raising the
only protest, the Finnish proposal was put to a vote im
mediately. As the United States, the Western European nations
and most of the Third World joined in support of the Finnish
motion, only die-hard opponents of Israel backed Iran.
In addition to Libya and Algeria, the only Arab states, the
opposition group included Afghanistan, Albania, Cuba, Gre
nada, Nicaragua and Vietnam, besides Iran. Thirty-one nations
abstained, including the Soviet Union and its Eastern European
allies, and 42, including a large proportion of Arab states, were
recorded as absent.
U.S. Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick, who had conducted a
strong campaign against the effort to reject Israel, called the
vote "a gratifying exercise of good judgment by the General
Assembly."
Pastinen, outside the Assembly, said he had expected wide
support for his proposal. "To vote on such an issue (the Iranian
amendment) in this inflamed atmosphere would have been
disastrous," he said. "The decision to adjourn the matter
showed that most members put the life of the organization
first."
Diplomats generally agreed that the Shultz warning and the
reasoning of Pastinen probably accounted for the victory.
Chrysler workers vote not to strike
Detroit — Hourly workers at Chrysler Corp. voted over
whelmingly yesterday to stay on the job at the number three
U.S. automaker in spite of a contract impasse. United Auto
Workers Union President Douglas Fraser announced at the end
of a one-day rank-and-file strike vote.
Fraser said the overall vote was 70 percent against a walkout,
with production workers voting 68.5 percent to remain at their
jobs, parts workers 67 percent and engineers 90 percent.
The UAW said the final vote was 25,056-11,589 against a
walkout in favor of resuming negotiations with Chrysler early
next year.
"I think things will change substantially by January," Fraser
said at a news conference last night. "I think we still can do
better than we did (negotiating) in September, even if the
economy does not improve. We can't continue this way. Down
the road, as the economy improves, Chrysler workers have to
receive a greater share of equity."
Contract talks collapsed Oct. 18 when Chrysler said "there i
simply is no more money" for an immediate pay raise the '
workers had demanded after three years of wage concessions to
aid the troubled automaker. y
The rank-and-file had overwhelmingly rejected an earlier t
tentative contract that contained no immediate pay increase but l
tied wage boosts to quarterly profits and reinstated cost-of
living protection, beginning in December. (
"I think they (workers) used very good judgment in not a
jeopardizing their jobs and in not jeopardizing the corpora
tion," said Marc Stepp, UAW vice president in charge of the 2
Chrysler department. y
Thomas Miner, vice president of industrial relations for
Chrysler, said the company was "gratified." r
"We believe a strike against the company would have had
serious consequences and would have jeopardized the jobs of all
Chrysler employees," he said. • i
Chrysler's 43,200 working U .S. autoworkers plus many of the i

r 40,000 on indefinite layoff were eligible to vote.
r The options were to strike Chrysler company wide at 10 a.m.
next Monday or continue working under terms of an expired
contract while contract talks recessed until January.
"It's good sense," Local 212 President Joe Zappa said in
Detroit. "Logic prevailed."
Chrysler lost $3.27 billion from 1979 to 1981 and was bailed
out by $1.2 billion in federal loan guarantees. Chrysler earned
$256.8 million in the first half of this year, mainly from the sale
of its profitable defense subsidiary.
Chrysler autoworkers, who average $9.07 an hour in wages,
gave up more than $1 billion in contract concessions over the
past three years in both wages and benefits.
Autoworkers at General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co.
earn $2.60 more an hour in wges than Chrysler workers. UAW
members ratified pacts at GM and Ford earlier this year.
Salvadoran rebels seek negotiations
Mexico City — The insurgent movement in El Salvador called
for unconditional talks with the government yesterday on the
basis of a five-point plan intended to bring the warring parties to
the negotiating table.
Spokesmen for the rebels said the peace proposal had been
communicated to the government, but they made it clear that
they considered the U.S. attitude the governing factor in its
acceptance.
"We continue to believe that the political will of the United
States administration is the key test to open the doors of a
dialogue and negotiation," said Dr. Guillermo Ungo, president
ot the Revolutionary Democratic Front (FDR), a coalition of
Salvadoran political groups that represents the insurgent
movement's non-military wing.
Ana Guadalupe Martinez, a commander of the People's Re
volutionary Army, represented the guerrilla wing at the news
conference. «
The government made no immediate comment on the plan,
but Salvadoran President Alvaro Magana had said in early
October that he expected to set up a peace commission by
month's end that could "see if negotiations should be opened."
A copy of the five-point plan distributed to reporters was
signed by both the leaders of the FDR and the top commanders
of the five guerrilla groups in the military organization, the
Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN).
Ungo said leftist leaders believe this is an opportune time to
initiate peace talks because of some "ambiguous" statements
made by Reagan administration officials "that do not close the
door to a dialogue."
Bradley, Deukmejian debate
San Diego — Democrat Tom Bradley, in his final debate with
gubernatorial rival George Deukmejian, said yesterday he
"would not sign" any bill that would repeal the death penalty.
But Republican Deukmejian suggested that Bradley would,
like his Democratic predecessor Governor Brown appoint
judges who would overturn and delay executions.
The two contenders also split on Deukmejian's plan that
prisons be self-supporting, a proposal Bradley called "a rather
ludicrous idea."
And Bradley, the Los Angeles mayor, and Deukmejian, the
state attorney general, continued their mutual vagueness on
what programs they would cut, or what taxes they might con
sider raising, to meet a possible budget deficit of up to $ 1 billion.
The encounter, the second sponsored by the League of
Women Voters, was polite and well-mannered, with neither
candidate emerging a clear victor.
Market rallies after drop
New York — Blue-chip stocks ralliibd in heavy trading late
yesterday to lift the Dow Jones industrial average back above
the 1000 mark and help the market overall trim its near-record
losses of a day earlier.
A rumor that the Federal Reserve Board was about to cut its
discount rate from 9.5 percent did not materialize, but also
added temporary support for stocks, analysts said.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which tumbled
36.33 points Monday and was off more than 14 points early
yesterday, recovered to close up to 10.94 at 1006.07.
Today's Weather
Sunny today, with highs in the 60s to low 70s. Northwest
winds 10 to 20 mph. Fair and cool tonight, with lows in the
upper 40s to mid 50s.
