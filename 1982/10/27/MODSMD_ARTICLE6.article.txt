# Students abandon math for engineering
## 
### LISA LYNCH 
An increase in interest in applied
math caused by expanding job oppor
tunities in this field may be part of the
reason why fewer students are going
into pure math. Educators are worried
that this nationwide trend will create a
shortage in math teachers in several
years.
At Stanford the trend was reflected
in a decrease in the pure math part of
the Mathematics Department. Ten
years ago pure math comprised the
largest part of the department — now it
makes up the smallest.
"This is a long-term problem,"
explained Graduate Studies Dean
Gerald Lieberman. The reason for the
decrease in the size of the pure math
part of the department, he said, was
because of the current focus on
technology and the reduction in posi
tions in math research.
"Few industries want to hire
mathematicians, and there are really
no faculty positions open to them,"
said Lieberman. The student popula
tion at all universities is dwindling, he
explained, because a college education
is becoming increasingly expensive.
Increased college expenses com
bined with the limited amount of te
nured faculty positions available has
practically eliminated the need for new
university faculty.

"We're discouraging students now
from pursuing careers in university
teaching," Lieberman said. "However,
in 10 to 15 years, there will be retire
ments at the university level and then
there will not be enough teachers to fill
those positions. There's no tradition
anymore in training university profes
sors."
Lieberman also said he believed the
best mathematicians were often lured
away from professorships by lucrative
offers from the private sector. "When
we do want faculty, we're not attracting
the brightest minds," he said.
Money has become more of a con
cern to prospective university faculty,
not only because of the amount of
teaching salaries, but because of the
dwindling amount of research funds
available from the government. How
ever, he said that pure mathematics
had not suffered much from research
funding cuts.
Paul Berg, professor of mathematics,
said he was concerned about the finan
cial problem. "A good number of scho
larships are gone, and research assis
tance grants are dwindling," Berg said.
As evidence of this, he cited the Na
tional Science foundation, a major
supporter of research during the post-
Sputnik era. "Support from that prog
ram has dwindled down to almost no
thing — in fact. I believe the program

may have been terminated."
Berg said the lack of federal monies
has had a major effect on the number of
mathematics teachers, but mainly the
pre-college area.
"At Stanford, I know of one indi
vidual who plans to go into mathema
tics teaching," he asserted, "around 10
years ago there was as many as 20." He
explained that while the University has
no Mathematics Education major, the

decline in the number of students wish
ing to become secondary school math
teachers is apparent everywhere.
Berg emphasized that the teaching
profession is far less attractive now
than a decade ago. In the past, there
were fewer options available to
graduate students, so many graduates
became teachers through lack of
choice.
