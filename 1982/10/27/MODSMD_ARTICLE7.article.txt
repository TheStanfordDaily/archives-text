# Recycling must show fiscal viability by Dec. 10
## 
### STEVE TROUSDALE Staff writer 
In a move intended to force the University to
take more immediate action on the recycling issue,
the ASSU Senate passed a resolution at its meeting
last night giving the deficit-ridden ASSU Recycling
project until Dec. 10 to prove that it can achieve
financial viability.
In other business, the senate passed a resolution
directing Senate Chair Raga Elim to tell the Publi
cations Board that it had violated ASSU by-laws in
forming its budget allocations and in publicizing its
meetings. They also unanimously approved a resol
ution supporting an attempt by the Overseas
Studies Office toestablish a campus in Mexico City.
The recycling resolution was passed after bitter
debate over the exact date. Several senators, includ
ing Sharon Dyer. Larry Ausubel and Greg Ray. all
of whom are members of the Finance Committee,
pushed for the Feb. 1 deadline that was included in

a hill that the committee 'reported to the senate.
Dyer said a later deadline was needed to enable the
project to look for alternate sources of funding,
especially from the private sector.
Disagreeing with her position. Council of Presi
dents (COP) member Rod Beckstrom commented
that "to assume that the University would agree to
cover the full deficit is construed (incorrectly)" be
cause, he said, recycling would then have no incen
tive to be solvent.
The final version of the bill forms a committee to
investigate alternative sources of funding for recycl
ing and gives it the December deadline to prove to
the senate "that the project can be operated with
out a loss to the Association" or recycling will be
shut down.
The resolution concerning the Pub Board was
passed on the recommendation of COP member
Mark Epstein, who told the senate that the board
had provided no written notification of its meetings.

had notified neither the board's COP member nor
its senate member of meetings, and had devised a
preliminary budget without including an allocation
for its discretionary fund, which goes to organiza
tions that it does not normally fund. All of these
actions, he said, were violations of ASSU by-laws.
However, Doug Fine, the chairman of the Pub
Board, responded to these allegations by saying "I
didn't believe we violated the by-laws." He said the
senate motion passed only because, in his view,
"none of the senators were really involved in the
process, so they don't know what's happening."
He said, however, he was "not sure if it's (the
allegations) against me or against the way the board
was loosely run in the past."
In other developments. COP member Cynthia
Mathewson announced the selection of Seth Lin
field as the director of the ASSU Guest Professor
ship Bureau.
