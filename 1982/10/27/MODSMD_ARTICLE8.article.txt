## As election draws near, the environmentalists get into gear Groups 
### VICKI MOORE 
If the 1970s was the decade of
litigation for the environmental
movement, the 1980s promises to
be the decade of political ac
tivism. Environmental groups
have become increasingly sophis
ticated and effective political op
erators and for the first time,
many environmental groups are
formally endorsing and cam
paigning for political candidates.
Five national groups — the
Sierra Club, Friends of the Earth,
the League of Conservation Vot
ers, Environmental Action and
the Solar Lobby — as well as 32
state political action committees
(PACs), expect to spend close to
$2 million on the Nov. 2 election
campaigns.
The involvement in election
campaigns has been spurred by
what environmentalists see as a
Reagan administration drive to
dismantle or weaken the laws
passed in the last two decades to
clean up and protect the environ
ment.
"Although the electoral proc
ess was one glaring omission
where environmental groups had
not participated, it really took
Ronald Reagan and James Watt
to spark environmental groups
into politics," said Rob Chlopak,
Friends of the Earth political
campaign director.
The Sierra Club's Committee
on Political Education (SCOPE),
Friends of the Earth Political Ac
tion Committee (FOEPAC), and
the California League of Con
servation Voters (CLCV), all
based in San Francisco, have put
their members to work to help re
elect governors, senators and
congressmen who are committed
to conservation and environmen
tal protection. These PACs have
endorsed 160 congressional can
didates.
Although environmentalists
acknowledge that they probably
will never be able to match the
funding of corporate PACs, the
two largest of which have raised
about 514 million for this elec
tion, according to Chlopak, "the
amount of money spent on a
campaign often grossly under
estimates the potential impact on
a political race." The environ
mental PACs believe that they
can make up for what they lack in
money by focusing the bulk of
their resources into campaign
workshops, volunteer re

cruitment drives, and person-to
person canvassing, either door
to-door or by telephone. Na
tional environmental groups
have also set up a training in
stitute called Americans for the
Environment, to conduct semi
nars throughout the United
States and teach the fine points of
getting out the green vote.
In carrying out their cam
paigns, the environmental PACs
hope to mend the "devastating"
defeat of many of its allies in
Congress in 1980. Environmental
groups point to polls showing
widespread public support for

environmental legislation and
quote pollster Louis Harris who
said before the House subcom
mittee on the environment that
. .not a single major segment of
the public wants the environmen
tal laws made less strict."
However, "The public voice is
not being transmitted to the legis
lative process," said SCOPE Di
rector Rob Kutler. "The public
has never felt that they had a
chance to vote on environmental
policies, but now we are trying to
get people to pay attention to the
environmental issues and make
them aware that at election time,
their vote can help decide the fate
of our environment."
The environment PACs realize
that the economy will be the main
issue in most elections, but "that
doesn't mean that environmental
issues won't make a difference in
individual elections," said
SCOPE assistant Pam Brodie.
Brodie said that the environmen
tal PACs will probably have a
greater effect on local elections
since many people are not famil
iar with the candidates, and the
environmental PACs are prac
tically by themselves in canvass

ing for local elections.
The PACs are targeting their
resources on the marginal races
where the spread between can
didates is less.
The League of Conversation
Voters, the only environmental
group which works almost ex
clusively on political campaigns,
report that their previous cam
paigns have resulted in increasing
the number of votes for their en
dorsed candidate by an average
of five percent, an amount large
enough to be the determining fac
tor in some races.
The CLCV-is affiliated with

the League of Conservation Vot
ers, and during election time,
they integrate their efforts with
other environmental groups. The
CLCV's mainstay is a full-time
door-to-door outreach staff that
educates voters about their repre
sentative's environmental voting
record which is compiled in the
CLCV's annual voting chart.
"Our ultimate focus," said
Rich Waller, CLCV canvas cam
paigns director, "is to get en
vironmentally concerned people
to the polls on election day."
Waller and other PAC direc
tors agree that the person-to-per
son emphasis in their campaigns
gives them a big advantage over
their rival PACs. As Waller said,
"We are reviving a tradition in
politics that goes to the heart of
communicating to society."
