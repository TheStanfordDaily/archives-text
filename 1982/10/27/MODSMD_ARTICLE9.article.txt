The emergence of anew federal
philosophy toward the environ
ment under President Reagan has
dramatically changed the charac

ter of environmental politics in
America. Conservation groups
across the country are ap
proaching the 1952 congressional
elections with a mixture of anger
and activism in hope of re-electing
philosophical allies and defeating
those who have carried into law the
conservative approach of the Rea
gan administration. Environmen
tal Political Action Committee
(EPAC) groups have been estab
lished to support or oppose the re
election of certain Congressman.
The following is a rundown of fa
vorable environmental candidates,
as drawn from publications of the

League of Conservation Voters
(LCV), the Sierra Club, and the
Friends of the Earth organiza
tions:
At the head of the conserva
tionist agenda is Sen. Robert
Stafford (R-Vt.). The LCV
claims he is simply the "most im
portant environmentalist in the
U.S. Senate" as chairman of the
powerful Environment and Pub
lic Works Committee. The
groups report that Stafford
fought the Reagan adminis
tration's weakening revisions of
the Clean Air Act, and added
acid rain provisions to the Act
that are critical to his Vermont
constituency, who live downwind
from the coal-fired power plants
of the Ohio River Valley. Staf
ford is praised for his support for
the Endangered Species Act, the
creation of a "superfund," to
clean up toxic waste dumps and
his committee's investigation of
the debilitating effect of funding
cuts on the Environmental Pro
tection Agency's (EPA) enforce
ment of anti-pollution laws.
Serving a key environmental
role on Stafford's committee is
another Eastern Republican,
Sen. John Chafee (R-R.1.). His
stand on health and wildlife con
servation issues, as well as his op
position to large public works
projects such as the Tennessee-
Tombigbee waterway, have
made him a favorite of EPACs. A
major re-election liability for
Chafee is Rhode Island's over

whelmingly Democratic elec
torate.
Rep. "Tobv Moffett (D-Ct.) is
challenging incumbent Senator
Lowell Weicker in a third
Eastern Senate race. According
to the Sierra Club, Moffett's
name is "synonomous with en
vironmental protection" since
his election to the House in 1974.
The LCV claims he is one of the
environmental movement's
"strongest, most consistent and
most effective advocates." Mof
fett has worked toward a strong
reauthorization of the Clean Air
Act as a member of the House
Energy and Commerce Commit
tee and, as chairman" of the Gov
ernment Operations Committee,
has challenged Secretary of In
terior James Watt and EPA ad
ministrator Anne Gorsuch in
their proposed revisions of en
vironmental regulations.
Also in the Senate, Democrat
Paul Sarbanes of Maryland is re
ceiving significant EPAC sup
port for re-election. Sarbanes
was one of the few senators to op
pose confirmation of James Watt
as Interior Secretary and John
Crowell (formerly of the Georgia
Pacific lumber company) as head
of the Forest Service. He has
voted against the ocean dumping
of sewage sludge and the dis
charging of nuclear wastes into
the Chesapeake Bay. However,
Sarbanes is a major target of the
National Conservative Political
Action Committee, and is con
sidered the "most vulnerable
Democratic incumbent" by a Re
publican Senatorial committee;
EPAC support is "critical" in his
race.
On the House side, six incum
bent congressmen are in the
limelight of EPAC support. Rep
resentatives to Mo Udall (D-
Az.), John Seiberling (D-Oh.),
Phillip Burton (D-San Francis
co), Jim Weaver (D-Or.), Tim
Wirth (D-Co.) and Tom Lantos
(D-San Mateo) lead a group of 20
predominately Democratic
House members EPACs are
working to re-elect.
Udall and Seiberling are two of
the oldest and most consistent al
lies of the environmental move
ment. Udall's chairmanship of
the Committee on Interior and
Insular Affairs and Seiberling's
chairmanship of the Subcommit
tee on Public Lands and National
Parks place them in strategic
positions for the passage of en
vironmental legislaton. They
have responded by supporting
protective laws covering wil
derness and wildlife refuges,
clean air resolutions and the con
tinued efficacy of the EPA. The
Sierra Club believes Udall is a
"consistent friend in vitally im
portant public land legislation,"
and Seiberling has a "nearly
perfect voting record" in "every

area of environmental protec
tion."
EPACs look to Colorado's
Wirth to continue fighting "to
protect important (environmen
tal) programs from Reagan ad
ministration budget cuts" as
Chairman of a Budget Commit
tee Task Force. Wirth's commit
tee designated $200 million for
the resurrection of the Land and
Water Conservation Fund,
which Re.agan had proposed
eliminating. The Congressman
also worked for alternative
energy sources through federal
funding, tax credits and low in
terest loans for solar power and
energy conservation programs.
In the North, Democratic
Congressman Jim Weaver is once
again fighting for his political life
in Oregon. He sits on two House
committees crucial to environ
mentalists: Interior and Agricul
ture, and ffom those positions
has led efforts to support clean
air and water, preserve wil
derness and ensure the timber in
dustry logs in consideration of
the sustained yield of forests. But

EPAC support is
running strong for
incumbent Democ
rat Tom Lantos.
When Watt balked
on the purchase of
the San Francisco
peninsula's
Sweeney Ridge as
part of the Golden
Gate Recreational
Area, Lantos
fought for its inclu
sion.

Weaver's district is ravaged by 23
percent unemployment, and the
state's once-powerful timber in
dustry is witnessing nearly 45
percent unemployment in the
sawmills and pulp and paper
plants. Although his criticism of
Watt has brought support from
many constituents, the EPACs
fear Southern Oregon's con
servatism may lead to Weaver's
defeat.
In Stanford's home state, three
California Democrats have been
singled out for significant EPAC
support: Senatorial hopeful Jerry
Brown, and incumbent Con
gressmen Phillip Burton and
Tom Lantos.

Re-election of San Francisco's
Burton is a major priority of en
vironmental groups. According
to the Sierra Club, he and James
Watt are on opposite ends of the
issue of protecting and expand
ing national parks and wilderness
areas. As chairman of the Na
tional Parks subcommittee, he
has chaired legislation leading to
the largest expansion of the Na
tional Parks system in history.
The LCV praises Burton as a
leader in the passage of the Alas
ka Lands Act, the Redwood Park
expansion and protective legisla
tion for California's Point Reyes,
Lake Tahoe and Mineral King
Valley.
Ironically, Burton's re-election
is threatened by the results of his
own controversial redisricting
scheme. Thirty-six percent of his
district is new to him; the San
Francisco Chronicle deems it the
"most conservative possible" in
the city. Burton faces a tough
challenge from Republican State
Senator Milton Marks.
EPACs are relying on the pro
environmental record of demo
crat Jerry Brown in supporting
his election to the Senate. As gov
ernor of California, Brown in
stituted programs regarding auto
emissions, toxic wastes,
pesticides and nuclear technolo
gy that set stronger public in
terest requirements than federal
programs. Friends of the Earth
Chairman David Brower, a
former visiting professor at Stan
ford, believes "more than any
other American politicians, Gov
ernor Brown understands the
dual threats that jeopardizes
world security today: the spread
of nuclear weapons and nuclear
power plans and the squandering
of our natural resources."
Brown's opponent, Republican
Pete Wilson, has given little in
dication of his environmental
philosophy other t han support
ing the state's Per iheral Canal in
a recent election.
And in Stanford's own con
gressional district, EPAC sup
port is running strong for incum
bent democrat Tom Lantos.
When Watt balked on the
purchase of the San Francisco
Peninsula's Sweeney Ridge as
part of the Golden Gate Recrea
tional Area, Lantos fought for its
inclusion. He was a leader in op
posing the Reagan adminis
tration's sale of offshore oil
leases in Northern California and
has consistently fought Watt and
Gorsuch. Lantos' opponent,
former Rep. Bill Royer, had a
"poor environmental record in
Congress," according to the
LCV.
