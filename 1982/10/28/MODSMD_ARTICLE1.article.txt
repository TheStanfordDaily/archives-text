# Jobs remain key issue
## 12th Dist. hopefuls meet 
### JULIE RYAN 
Positions on jobs and the economy
cut the clearest distinction between the
three candidates for the 12th Con
gressional District seat — Democrat
Emmett Lynch, Libertarian William
White and Republican Ed Zschau —
who met in a political forum at SLAC
Auditorium yesterday.
Criticizing Republican economic
policy, Lynch said, "If we continue on

the current
course, I sus
pect we will be
in a much
worse disaster
than we are in
now." Lynch

conceded that Reagan had some good
ideas, but said "they just aren't work
ing."
Zschau, however, maintained that
most of today's problems were in
herited from past administrations. The
Republican said high interest rates im
posed by the Carter administration are
to blame for the present 10.1 percent
unemployment rate. "There was no
way that we were going to be able to re
cover without a recession," he said.
Although Zschau said he differs with
some of Reagan's policies — such as the
across-the-board tax cut — he supports
the Reagan stance that the most impor
tant factor in the economic recovery is
the restraint of government spending
and reduction of the deficit.
White said the real answer for the re
vival of the economy was to "allow in
dividuals the freedom to succeed or fail
on their own." He said. "The role of
government should be limited to pre
serving a free society." Even the mone
tary system could be turned over to
private competition by legalizing mone
tary gold, according to White.
On the issue of nuclear weapons,
Zschau stressed the importance of

stable mutual deterrence and said he
supports a bilateral verifiable freeze to
be followed by mutual reductions. He
said he would support Salt II while
pushing for disarmament talks.
"Proposition 12 (the nuclear freeze
initiative) is a cornerstone in my cam
paign," Lynch said. He said he believes
it is an important first step toward "the
elimination of nuclear weapons from
the world."
White said he believes that the mili
tary should only be concerned with the
defense of the United States and said
that we could reduce the national de
fense budget by getting out of tangling
alliances which force us to protect Eu
rope and the Far East.
All three candidates said they sup
ported the Equal Rights Amendment.
Both Zschau and Lynch also favor fed
eral funding of abortions for indigent
women.
Both the moderator of the forum,
SLAC physicist Jack Truher and the
candidates expressed disappointment
at the low turnout of 16 people. The
candidates discussed the problem at
great length and suggested many voters
are apathetic because they do not think
that they can make a difference in gov
ernment policy.
All three candidates have signed and
adhered to a fair political practice
agreement which Zschau described as
"fairly unique." This might be one way
to restore public confidence in the dem
ocratic system, according to Zschau.
Though adhering to the fair practices
agreement, the candidates receive wide
ly differing amounts of financial sup
port. Zschau said he expects to spend
about $500,000, Lynch $50,000, and
White less than than $5000. Zschau said
he derives much of his support from
business. Lynch claimed labor and
education interests have given him
some financial support.
