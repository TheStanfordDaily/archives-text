# Final push planned

In an effort to ensure a friendly Congress this fall. President Reagan
has taken to the campaign circuit urging Americans to "stay the
course" and vote Republican Nov. 2.
In what has been termed part of a media blitz, Reagan will make
two national and regional television pitches this weekend calling on
voters to remain true to the Republican party.
The decision to broadcast came on the heels of a surge of support
last week for Democratic challengers from New Jersey to California.
A pattern of erosion, apparently linked to economic worries, that hit
Republican incumbents in Connecticut, Missouri, New Jersey and
New Mexico and spilled over into California moved all those contests
into the potential turnover category raising the possibility that Demo
crats might recapture control of the Senate in next Tuesday's election.
The television spots are not intended to break new ground. Instead,
they repeat his 1980 campaign message of "saving the American
dream" and repeat the president's frequent contention that he cannot
"undo the damage" of the last 20 years in 21 months.
Reagan's national television appeal emphasizes the importance he
places on the midterm elections, in which the working coalition of Re
publicans and conservative Democrats who have supported his eco
nomic programs in the House may be at stake.
The administration is clearly worried about the elections. Expend
ing some of the president's political capital in an across-the-board ap
peal for Republicans in the hope of averting landslide losses is seen as
crucial by administration advisers to assuring the president's ability to
govern effectively.
Interesting to note is the fact that most of the Republicans who ap
pear freshly vulnerable are from the moderate-liberal wing of the
GOP, not from the ranks of President Reagan's hard-core supporters.
According to Democratic pollster Peter Hart one reason the Re
publicans are in trouble is that the Republican message has been
"schizophrenic." The national GOP advertising effort and Reagan's
own campaigning Hart said are "hiding from the big issues." Hart
also faulted the Republican strategy for taking Reagan "out of the
presidency and making him the chairman of the Republican party."
The polltaker indicated Republican prospects had diminished as Rea
gan took a more partisan role and tone than people had previously
seen displayed.
