### BOB ORTTUNG 
"Independence is not given on a silver platter,
it has to be taken by force. This is the only way
we can free our natural and human resources."
With this remark Serge Mukendi, the Con
golese National Liberation Front's (FLNC) rep
resentative to the United States and the Western
Hemisphere, began his lecture explaining the
position of the FLNC in its fight against the gov
ernment of Mobutu Sese Seko in Zaire. (Zaire
was formerly named the Congo.)
The lecture was sponsored by the African
Studies Center and the Stanford African As
sociation as part of their weekly Africa table lec
ture series.
According to Mukendi, the problems for the
Congolese began when Europeans first came to
his country with the idea of converting the
Africans to Christianity.
In the early twentieth century, King Leopold
of Belgium practiced the most vicious form of
colonialism of all the Europeans, Mukendi said.
During this period his men cut off the arms of
Congolese men and the breasts of Congolese
women.
"Since that time all the countries who are now
defending human rights, democracy, and free
dom are the ones who are the cause of the misery
of the Congolese people," Mukendi said.
According to an information sheet put out by
Freedom Rising, the group that is sponsoring
Mukendi's West Coast tour, the CIA as
sassinated Patrice Lumumba, the first popularly
elected prime minister of the Congo. After the
assassination, the CIA put Mobutu into power.
He is known as the "Shah of Africa."
Mobutu himself is the richest head of state in
the world. Freedom Rising claims. Since he has
been in power, not one school or hospital has
been built.
From the time of its formation in 1968, the
FLNC has organized support among the people
against Mobutu.
In answer to a question, Mukendi admitted
that there are 14 groups fighting for the liber
ation of the Congolese people. They are not uni
fied because many are supported by Mobutu
himself or by Belgium and because they have dif
ferent political principles.

'.Despite the coalition of many
forces, despite the
sophistication of their guns and
no matter how powerful those
armies can be, they cannot put
down the spirit of the Congolese
people determined to free
themselves.'

The FLNC wants to form a socialistic society
in Zaire. Eventually it wants Zaire to be a base to
liberate all of Africa from neo-colonialism, start
ing with the nine countries on its borders.
Mukendi said the people are united ideol
ogically by Marxism and Leninism.
The FLNC led two offenses in 1977 and 1978
that almost toppled the government. The regime
was saved only by North Atlantic Treaty Or
ganization support. Former Secretary of State
Alexander Haig, then commander of the NATO
forces, coordinated the most recent intervention
force in Shaba Province (formerly Katanga).

Today there are 20,000 troops from NATO,
Israel, China and Morocco and 10,000
mercenaries supporting the government, accord
ing to Freedom Rising. The FLNC had approx
imately 40,000 freedom fighters in 1978, accord
ing to Mukendi. Today's figures cannot be re
leased for security reasons, he said.
The United States intervened in the FLNC
uprisings for what government officials called
humanitarian reasons. But Mukendi said it was
"humanitarian cobalt, humanitarian diamond,
but never humanitarian people." Zaire is the
world's leading producer of cobalt and the larg
est source of industrial diamonds.

'Mobutu is taking the money.
But he is not alone. Other
supervisors in the Congo are
working in the interests of
(their) master, international
finance capital... They
plunder our country (and) they
increase oppression in order to
create a favorable climate for
the realization of high profit. *

The occupation brought much hardship to the
country, according to Mukendi.
"Today the Congolese people eat only once
every 48 hours, while Mobutu's fortune is put at
over $3 billion," he said.
The average salary of the inhabitants ranges
from $3 to $15 a month, he said.
Mukendi also claimed that for someone to re
ceive medical help at a hospital he must bribe a
physician or nurse because they have not been
paid in many months.
There are few textbooks and almost no lab
equipment in the schools because the professors
have had to sell it. They also haven't been paid
and need money to support their families,
Mukendi said.
"Where is the money going? Mobutu is taking
the money. But he is not alone. Other super
visors in the Congo are working in the interests
of (their) master, international finance capital
. . . They plunder our country â€” they increase
oppression in order to create a favorable climate
for the realization of high profit," Mukendi said.
The World Bank and the International Mone
tary Fund dictate Zaire's monetary policies be
cause it is greatly indebted to these agencies, ac
cording to Freedom Rising.
"In this context you can see why the FLNC
and the Congolese people are fighting for social
ism," Mukendi said.
Mukendi said that only 1.28 million people
out of 30 million can find work in Zaire. Educa
tion is also lacking, he said, mostly because stu
dents are too hungry to study. He said that the
walls of the school are falling apart and there is
no chalk or blackboards, and students must
bring a stone or brick to sit on since there are no
chairs.
"Despite the coalition of many forces, despite
the sophistication of their guns and no matter
how powerful those armies can be, they cannot
put down the spirit of the Congolese people de
termined to free themselves," Mukendi said.
"It took Vietnam 40 years, we still have 18
left."

it has to be taken by force. This is the only way
we can free our natural and human resources."

imately 40,000 freedom fighters in 1978, accord
ing to Mukendi. Today's figures cannot be re
leased for security reasons, he said.
The United States intervened in the FLNC
uprisings for what government officials called
humanitarian reasons. But Mukendi said it was
"humanitarian cobalt, humanitarian diamond,
but never humanitarian people." Zaire is the
world's leading producer of cobalt and the larg
est source of industrial diamonds.

'Mobutu is taking the money.
But he is not alone. Other
supervisors in the Congo are
working in the interests of
(their) master, international
finance capital... They
plunder our country (and) they
increase oppression in order to
create a favorable climate for
the realization of high profit. *

The occupation brought much hardship to the
country, according to Mukendi.
"Today the Congolese people eat only once
every 48 hours, while Mobutu's fortune is put at
over $3 billion," he said.
The average salary of the inhabitants ranges
from $3 to $15 a month, he said.
Mukendi also claimed that for someone to re
ceive medical help at a hospital he must bribe a
physician or nurse because they have not been
paid in many months.
There are few textbooks and almost no lab
equipment in the schools because the professors
have had to sell it. They also haven't been paid
and need money to support their families,
Mukendi said.
"Where is the money going? Mobutu is taking
the money. But he is not alone. Other super
visors in the Congo are working in the interests
of (their) master, international finance capital
. . . They plunder our country â€” they increase
oppression in order to create a favorable climate
for the realization of high profit," Mukendi said.
The World Bank and the International Mone
tary Fund dictate Zaire's monetary policies be
cause it is greatly indebted to these agencies, ac
cording to Freedom Rising.
"In this context you can see why the FLNC
and the Congolese people are fighting for social
ism," Mukendi said.
Mukendi said that only 1.28 million people
out of 30 million can find work in Zaire. Educa
tion is also lacking, he said, mostly because stu
dents are too hungry to study. He said that the
walls of the school are falling apart and there is
no chalk or blackboards, and students must
bring a stone or brick to sit on since there are no
chairs.
"Despite the coalition of many forces, despite
the sophistication of their guns and no matter
how powerful those armies can be, they cannot
put down the spirit of the Congolese people de
termined to free themselves," Mukendi said.
"It took Vietnam 40 years, we still have 18
left."
"Independence is not given on a silver platter,
it has to be taken by force. This is the only way
we can free our natural and human resources."
With this remark Serge Mukendi, the Con
golese National Liberation Front's (FLNC) rep
resentative to the United States and the Western
Hemisphere, began his lecture explaining the
position of the FLNC in its fight against the gov
ernment of Mobutu Sese Seko in Zaire. (Zaire
was formerly named the Congo.)
The lecture was sponsored by the African
Studies Center and the Stanford African As
sociation as part of their weekly Africa table lec
ture series.
According to Mukendi, the problems for the
Congolese began when Europeans first came to
his country with the idea of converting the
Africans to Christianity.
In the early twentieth century, King Leopold
of Belgium practiced the most vicious form of
colonialism of all the Europeans, Mukendi said.
During this period his men cut off the arms of
Congolese men and the breasts of Congolese
women.
"Since that time all the countries who are now
defending human rights, democracy, and free
dom are the ones who are the cause of the misery
of the Congolese people," Mukendi said.
According to an information sheet put out by
Freedom Rising, the group that is sponsoring
Mukendi's West Coast tour, the CIA as
sassinated Patrice Lumumba, the first popularly
elected prime minister of the Congo. After the
assassination, the CIA put Mobutu into power.
He is known as the "Shah of Africa."
Mobutu himself is the richest head of state in
the world. Freedom Rising claims. Since he has
been in power, not one school or hospital has
been built.
From the time of its formation in 1968, the
FLNC has organized support among the people
against Mobutu.
In answer to a question, Mukendi admitted
that there are 14 groups fighting for the liber
ation of the Congolese people. They are not uni
fied because many are supported by Mobutu
himself or by Belgium and because they have dif
ferent political principles.

'.Despite the coalition of many
forces, despite the
sophistication of their guns and
no matter how powerful those
armies can be, they cannot put
down the spirit of the Congolese
people determined to free
themselves.'

The FLNC wants to form a socialistic society
in Zaire. Eventually it wants Zaire to be a base to
liberate all of Africa from neo-colonialism, start
ing with the nine countries on its borders.
Mukendi said the people are united ideol
ogically by Marxism and Leninism.
The FLNC led two offenses in 1977 and 1978
that almost toppled the government. The regime
was saved only by North Atlantic Treaty Or
ganization support. Former Secretary of State
Alexander Haig, then commander of the NATO
forces, coordinated the most recent intervention
force in Shaba Province (formerly Katanga).

Today there are 20,000 troops from NATO,
Israel, China and Morocco and 10,000
mercenaries supporting the government, accord
ing to Freedom Rising. The FLNC had approx
imately 40,000 freedom fighters in 1978, accord
ing to Mukendi. Today's figures cannot be re
