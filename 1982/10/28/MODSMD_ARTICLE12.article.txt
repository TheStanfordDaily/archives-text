## The 						Stanford Daily Jerry Brown for Senate 
### 
Despite what astronomy professors may tell you,
moonbeams can turn to stardust in California poli
tics. "Governor Moonbeam" himself, Jerry
Brown, may soon be rocketed to the heights of
Middle American respectability with the title of
"Senator Brown." We believe that such an eleva
tion is an appropriate destiny for this heaven-gaz
ing former Jesuit seminarian.
We agree with The Sacramento Bee which labels
Gov. Brown one of the "most inventive public of
ficials" ever to achieve high office in the state of
California. As a brilliant and innovative
pragmatist, the governor has proven himself to be a
man for all ideologies. In the future Brown wishes
to unleash America's technological virtuosity with
a "commercial Pentagon" that will target invest
ment into rising and emerging industries that are
identified by experts as future growth sectors. This
limited economic agency planning, an American
ized, toned-down and democratically responsible
version of Japan's successful economic system,
would avoid the self-defeating hazards of the
"lemon socialism" practiced by the United King
dom and thus not support declining or obsolescent
industries.
In his enthusiasm for education, Brown is un
surpassed by any California competitor; he is first
among equals. Though his human capital or "In
vestment in People" program, Brown persuaded
the Legislature to establish 15 regional computer
training centers for teachers. The governor believes
that a "Computer In Every Classroom," should be
the slogan for the future. In a measure popularly
know as the "Apple Bill," he offered tax write-offs
to those companies willing to install computers in
California classrooms. When Jerry Brown stated
that "the computer is the pencil of the 1980s," he
demonstrated his insight into our national needs in
this burgeoning age of information. As Brown has
correctly advised us, we must become a "learning
society" if we are to survive as a major force in
world affairs.
Rather than slouching through life as a "wimp"
or a "flake," Jerry Brown has proven himself to be
a first-rate leader, a mature modern politician
capable of preparing society for the demands of the
21st century. Brown has not wasted our time by
spouting the conventional cliches of this age. We do
live in an era of limits, and the orchestrated cant
of post-war progress offered by mainstream politi
cians simplv does not meet the demands of the
1980s.
Stanford students do not have to run off to a Zen
Buddhist monastery for prayer and meditation to
appreciate Jerry Brown's near-mystical insights
into the complexities and conundrums of this com
plicated epoch. As a general campaign theme,
Brown's "Wake Up, America" suits us just fine.
Despite these points, our enthusiasm for Jerry
Brown is moderated by some elements in his rec
ord. For example, despite his claim that university
communities compose one of his major natural
constituencies, the governor's record of support for
higher education is less than perfect. While he has
never griped about "subsidizing intellectual
curiosity" in the UC system as did his predecessor,
Ronald Reagan, Brown was still a fiscally conser
vative governor who was more than willing to make

budget cuts after the passage of Proposition 13.
At times Brown does appear to be at least mildly
opportunistic. While it is probably true that "con
sistency is the hobgoblin of little minds," the gov
ernor has often projected the image of an intellec
tual chameleon, advocating everyone's position at
one time or another. Even though politicians must
build coalitions and cover all their bases, Brown
has probably gone overboard in the pursuit of this
goal. Switched positions on Proposition 13 and the
Medfly problem still rankle even his most ardent
supporters.
Brown has also been guilty of some
"hokey"pseudo-symbolism, the unforgivable sin of
hamming-it-up and playing it to the bleachers. Ev
eryone knows the sad litany of these tacky little
episodes: refusing to live in the Governor's Man
sion, driving around the state in a beat-up old blue
Plymouth, and the notorious trip to Africa with
"torch-singer" Linda Ronstadt.
Brown must now dedicate himself to evolving
beyond mere transparent symbols; he must become
a pragmatic man of ideas. The governor must re
assure Californians that he will tiot abandon their
interests or his own ideals during any future pursuit
of greater political glory, such as the American
Presidency.
Above all else, Brown wants to strengthen the
American national economy without the burden of
the "Fortress America" mentality. For the taste of
some of our nativist millenarians, such as the Moral
Majority, this medicine just isn't strong enough to
have the desired emetic effect.
This electoral contest is a great American tragedy
in that both candidates have taken improper career
paths at one time or another. As a result, California
voters have been deprived of choices that might
have yielded up "the best man" in past elections.
Pete Wilson is a superior administrator, "a detail
man." A bright Yale graduate, Wilson has left a
nearly impeccable record as Mayor of San Diego.
Wilson's problem is that he cannot see the forest
for the trees. Original and broad-sweeping ideas are
not his forte.
Sporting a different style, Jerry Brown is an "idea
man" whose natural habitat is a debating-society,
think-tank and grand-scale policymaking institu
tion such as the U.S. Senate. To use the governor's
own words, Brown will be a potent antidote to
those federal officials who have made "our govern
ment in Washington ... the modern-day version of
those who told Columbus that the world is flat."
Where others have failed, Jerry Brown will force
Washington to build for the future. Brown undef
stands the nature of the real "mess in Washington."
Reagan and Wilson do not.
We feel genuine compassion for both of these
star-crossed candidates. With their youth and in
tense sincerity, this persuasive pair of politicians re
minds use of the Kennedy-Nixon contest in 1960,
long before the two future presidents were soiled by
their later misdeeds. Brown and Wilson are high
caliber men, ranked far above the Hayakawas,
Tunneys and Murphys that this state has chosen for
the Senate in years gone by.
But, since only one new California seat can be
warmed on the Senate floor in January, let Brown
do it.
