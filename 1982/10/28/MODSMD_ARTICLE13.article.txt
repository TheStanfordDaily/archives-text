## Angela Arvidson was a true friend 
### 
"Did anyone here know the victim?"
the newsman hopefully asked eight or
10 students on White Plaza Sunday
morning. A cameraman filmed our col
lective response, even though most of us
said no. I said nothing.
As the television station hoped to use
Angela Arvidson's death to sell more
commercials, others would use it to
support sundry theories and political
perspectives. She would be de
personalized into a statistic, and at the
same time elevated to sainthood.
Angie was a beautiful, sweet, in
telligent and sensitive woman who lived
life, well, "tft a hundred miles per
hour." Because she wasr.'t a saint, she
must have at times seemed a little
brusque, as we all do.
I met Angie last spring when we blew
off an afternoon to go to the top of
Hoover Tower together. Stanford
sprawled before us; we thought about
all of our friends below. We talked
about our pasts and futures, and after
the sun set I walked her home.
"Oh. that's sweet" she whispered
when I hugged her goodnight.
Over the summer we ran into each

other, from time to time, each on our
way to diffeibiit places. These random
meetings grew ever shorter and more in
frequent.
"Angie," I said, finally cornering her
outside the French House late last
week. "Do you have a few minutes?"
"Sure, David, what's up?" her friend
ly eyes smiled an invitation even as she
held her bike's handlebars, prepared to
ride away.
"Angie, have 1 said something that
offended you?"
"No," she answered, "why?"
"Well, lately you never seem to have
time to talk anymore..
"I know," she said. "I've been ex
tremely busy lately and haven't had a
lot of time." Playing the guilt trip on
her, I informed her that other people
work hard and still have time for their
friends.
"People who have two jobs, a rela
tionship, and are full-time students
have time to talk to all their friends?"
she inquired looking at me from the
corner of dubious eyes.
"Well, maybe not," I admitted.
"David," she smiled, "my friends

mean a lot to me; they give my life much
of its meaning. And if they're true
friends, they'll understand how busy I
am, and will know that I love them even
if I have to rush by them sometimes."
Agreeing with her, I added that since
this would be my last quarter here, I'd
probably only run into her three or four
times more. I was wrong. I saw her
again only once.
That evening at the Coffeehouse, I
spied Angie talking to a woman who I
think meant a lot to her. Perhaps I
should call out to her, "Angie ..I
thought. But I didn't want to take up
more of her time which had grown so
precious. She has other friends who
need her too.
She said goodnight to her friend,
walked out to her bike, and rode off
into the darkness to meet her destiny.
Later that night, I walked out to my
bike, and rode off alone to meet my des
tiny. Well, maybe not so alone; for no
one is alone who has true friends.
