## Cost advantages make recycling make sense 
### 
I recently heard someone say as he
threw out his bottle, "it's not worth re
cycling any more." The truth is just the
opposite. Recycling at Stanford makes
more sense now than ever before.
The reason is that now, for the first
time since the ASSU began recycling
four years ago, it costs Stanford more to
landfill the garbage than for the ASSU
to recycle it, and the cost advantages of
recycling can only improve as the econ
omy recovers and dump space
diminishes.
Recycling would not appear so un
profitable were the full value of the ben

efits resulting from our service in
ternalized. That value has always been
far greater than the market value of the
paper fiber, metals and glass we sell.
Stanford has benefited from our free
trash removal service and from the
dump space we saved, but has never re
imbursed us. Until now the University
has denied the ASSU funding on the
grounds that their own contractor
could do it for less; it's time the Univer
sitv took another look.
The students have had the vision to
invest their time and money in an effort
to curb the wastefulness of their Uni
versity; they have demonstrated re
<r

sponsibilitv to the community and to
the future.
Stanford students can be proud of
their recycling program. Last year we
saved more than 700 tons of resources
from a premature burial, an increase of
9 percent over the volume recycled in
1980-1981. We serve over 300 offices
and dorms and employ more than 1000
person-hours per month. To my knowl
edge, the ASSU Recycling Project is un
rivaled in scale on any university cam
pus in the United States.
