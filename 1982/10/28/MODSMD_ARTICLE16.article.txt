# The 						Sound and the Fury
## A 						look at Reagan's record 
### 
As the election nears, it is becoming
clear that this election, even more than
most midterm elections, will be a refer
endum on the past two years. President
Reagan has put his personal prestige on
the line to an almost unprecedented
degree, defending his economic policies
and urging the country to "stay the
course" as he campaigns for Re
publican candidates. Thus we must ex
amine the course the president has
taken us on the last two years and ask
whether we like where we are going.
Over the past two years, the social
policies of the Reagan administration
have violated almost every principle of
justice and equal opportunity that lie at
the heart of the American political sys
tem. Since the very start of his cam
paign, when he contributed to the de
feat of the Equal Rights Amendment
even as he lauded the rights and free
doms of individuals, it has been clear
that Reagan does not consider women
and minorities to be among those indi
viduals deserving of equal rights. Rea
gan argued that the Constitution was
too important and inflexible a docu
ment to contain anything as radical as a
guarantee of equal rights for men and
women, yet he and his Republican allies
do not consider it too sacrosanct for
amendments providing for prayer in
public schools and outlawing abortions
even in the first few weeks of pregnancy.
Taken together with Reagan's ongoing
attempt to grant tax credits to racially
discriminatory schools, his tax policies
which have favored the well-to-do at
the expense of the poor in a vain at
tempt to stimulate economic growth
through the wonders of trickle-down
economics and Social Darwinism, and
his deep budget cuts in social programs
such as Aid to Families with Dependent
Children and the cutbacks in Social Se
curity that he will undoubtedly pursue
after the election, these social policies
have been a formula for injustice and
inequality.
Reagan's environmental policies
over the past two years were almost bad
enough to make his social policies look
good in comparison. Reagan's Secre
tary of the Interior, James Watt, has
been so anxious to exhaust all of our
natural resources before the second
coming of the Lord that he has virtually
declared all public lands open territory
for commercial development and en
vironmental destruction. Watt has been
so hasty in his attempts to open off
shore sites for oil drilling that oil com
panies have complained that they don't
have the resources to assess all of the
land that Watt is so intent on giving
away.
Watt's disregard for the environment
is rivaled only by Anne Gorsuch, Rea
gan's Environmental Protection Agen
cy director who told several corporate
executives that she would not enforce
standards for emissions of lead, which
is extremely toxic to children even in
small quantities. This incident is in
dicative of the course of EPA enforce
ment and of Reagan's attitudes
toward the environment. While there is
a legitimate case to be made for the
trade-off between pollution control and
economic production, Reagan's en
vironmental executioners have been so
rabidly against regulation of any sort
that they have been quick to favor pol
luters even when the economic interests
involved have been minimal and the
costs in human health and environmen
tal quality enormous.
It is difficult to trace Reagan's two
years of foreign policy because he has
vacillated between having no foreign
policy at all and having several con
tradictory policies at the same time. The
only consistent theme has been a return
to the simplistic Cold War anti-com
munism of the 19505, yet the adminis
tration's showcase anti-communist pol
icy in El Salvador threatens to mire the
United States in a Latin American Viet
nam. The Reagan administration's
blindness to the murders and tortures
carried out by government troops in El
Salvador and Guatemala has under
mined the moral force of U.S. argu
ments against Soviet transgressions in

Poland and Afghanistan and has sepa
rated the United States from its Eu
ropean allies at a time when trans
atlantic unity is needed most. The ob
vious hypocrisy of Reagan's refusal to
allow U.S. and European companies to
work on the Soviet pipeline while at the
same time supporting United States
grain sales to the Soviet Union, has
brought U.S.-European relations to a
new low. Finally, Reagan's Cold War
rhetoric and talk of "limited nuclear
war," combined with his rapid and ex
pensive arms buildup and lack of in
terest in serious arms limitations talks
with the Soviets, has apparently wor
ried everyone but the U.S.S.R. If the
Soviets are intimidated by Reagan's
militarism, they will undoubtedly re
spond by building even more arms.
While Reagan's recent peace initiative
in the Mideast, which has been praised
by both moderate Israelis and moderate
Arabs, might signify a reasonable trend
in his foreign policy decisions under the

Since the very start of his campaign, when he
contributed to the defeat of the Equal Rights
Amendment even as he lauded the rights and
freedoms of individuals, it has been clear that
Reagan does not consider women and minorities to
be among those individuals deserving of equal
rights.

Secretary of State George Shultz, peace
in El Salvador and peaceful and stable
coexistence with the Soviets seem as far
away as ever.
As explosive and important as all
these issues are, they have been all but
forgotten in the past two weeks as atten
tion has focused on the economy. As ac
cusations have flown back and forth
over Reagan's economic policy, Rea
gan has stooped to making any number
of dubious assertions in an effort to ob
scure his responsibility for the current
slump. Reagan's recent statement, for
example, that his record $1.5 trillion
five-year defense buildup and $750
billion five-year tax cut have not con
tributed to his record-breaking budget
deficits defies any sense of truth and
reason. The simple and unavoidable
truth is that Reagan's policies of tight
money, tax cuts and huge defense ex
penditures has brought down inflation
at the cost of the worst recession since
the Great Depression, 10.1 percent un
employment, federal deficits of over

$100 billion, and high interest rates.
The outlook for the future is hardly any
brighter as the White House is working
on a budget for next year with a
projected deficit of $170 billion. As
Paul Samuelson confirmed in a recent
New York Times opinion, the surge in
the stock market was based not on an
optimistic assessment of Reaganomics,
but on the expectation that the econo
my and the demand for private invest
ment capital will be so weak during the
next quarter that interest rates will have
to come down.
Despite this gloomy forecast, the Re
publicans are still harboring hopes for a
fair showing in the Nov. 2 election
Many have understandably distanced
themselves from Reagan's ill-conceived
policies, though it is questionable that
they would actively oppose them in
Washington. Others have banked on
Reagan's ability as the "Great Com
municator" to convince voters that his
policies are in fact working as planned.

that economic recovery is just around
the corner as it supposedly has been for
the last two years, that women really
don't need any guarantee of equal
rights, that he is genuinely interested in
arms limitations, and that the people of
El Salvador really would rather be dead
than red. Finally, some Republicans
take heart from the fact that women,
poor people, minorities, and the un
employed might feel so despondent and
helpless that they simply won't vote be
cause they feel that it won't make any
difference. The outcome of the election
thus hinges on whether the millions of
people disaffected by two years of Re
publican policies realize that the course
that Reagan is urging them to stay is
one which leads to social, environmen
tal. political and economic disaster, and
whether they have the determination to
change it.

and urging the country to "stay the
course" as he campaigns for Re
publican candidates. Thus we must ex
amine the course the president has
taken us on the last two years and ask
whether we like where we are going.
Over the past two years, the social
policies of the Reagan administration
have violated almost every principle of
justice and equal opportunity that lie at
the heart of the American political sys
tem. Since the very start of his cam
paign, when he contributed to the de
feat of the Equal Rights Amendment
even as he lauded the rights and free
doms of individuals, it has been clear
that Reagan does not consider women
and minorities to be among those indi
viduals deserving of equal rights. Rea
gan argued that the Constitution was
too important and inflexible a docu
ment to contain anything as radical as a
guarantee of equal rights for men and
women, yet he and his Republican allies
do not consider it too sacrosanct for
amendments providing for prayer in
public schools and outlawing abortions
even in the first few weeks of pregnancy.
Taken together with Reagan's ongoing
attempt to grant tax credits to racially
discriminatory schools, his tax policies
which have favored the well-to-do at
the expense of the poor in a vain at
tempt to stimulate economic growth
through the wonders of trickle-down
economics and Social Darwinism, and
his deep budget cuts in social programs
such as Aid to Families with Dependent
Children and the cutbacks in Social Se
curity that he will undoubtedly pursue
after the election, these social policies
have been a formula for injustice and
inequality.
Reagan's environmental policies
over the past two years were almost bad
enough to make his social policies look
good in comparison. Reagan's Secre
tary of the Interior, James Watt, has
been so anxious to exhaust all of our
natural resources before the second
coming of the Lord that he has virtually
declared all public lands open territory
for commercial development and en
vironmental destruction. Watt has been
so hasty in his attempts to open off
shore sites for oil drilling that oil com
panies have complained that they don't
have the resources to assess all of the
land that Watt is so intent on giving
away.
Watt's disregard for the environment
is rivaled only by Anne Gorsuch, Rea
gan's Environmental Protection Agen
cy director who told several corporate
executives that she would not enforce
standards for emissions of lead, which
is extremely toxic to children even in
small quantities. This incident is in
dicative of the course of EPA enforce
ment and of Reagan's attitudes
toward the environment. While there is
a legitimate case to be made for the
trade-off between pollution control and
economic production, Reagan's en
vironmental executioners have been so
rabidly against regulation of any sort
that they have been quick to favor pol
luters even when the economic interests
involved have been minimal and the
costs in human health and environmen
tal quality enormous.
It is difficult to trace Reagan's two
years of foreign policy because he has
vacillated between having no foreign
policy at all and having several con
tradictory policies at the same time. The
only consistent theme has been a return
to the simplistic Cold War anti-com
munism of the 19505, yet the adminis
tration's showcase anti-communist pol
icy in El Salvador threatens to mire the
United States in a Latin American Viet
nam. The Reagan administration's
blindness to the murders and tortures
carried out by government troops in El
Salvador and Guatemala has under
mined the moral force of U.S. argu
ments against Soviet transgressions in

Poland and Afghanistan and has sepa
rated the United States from its Eu
ropean allies at a time when trans
atlantic unity is needed most. The ob
vious hypocrisy of Reagan's refusal to
allow U.S. and European companies to
work on the Soviet pipeline while at the
same time supporting United States
grain sales to the Soviet Union, has
brought U.S.-European relations to a
new low. Finally, Reagan's Cold War
rhetoric and talk of "limited nuclear
war," combined with his rapid and ex
pensive arms buildup and lack of in
terest in serious arms limitations talks
with the Soviets, has apparently wor
ried everyone but the U.S.S.R. If the
Soviets are intimidated by Reagan's
militarism, they will undoubtedly re
spond by building even more arms.
While Reagan's recent peace initiative
in the Mideast, which has been praised
by both moderate Israelis and moderate
Arabs, might signify a reasonable trend
in his foreign policy decisions under the

Since the very start of his campaign, when he
contributed to the defeat of the Equal Rights
Amendment even as he lauded the rights and
freedoms of individuals, it has been clear that
Reagan does not consider women and minorities to
be among those individuals deserving of equal
rights.

Secretary of State George Shultz, peace
in El Salvador and peaceful and stable
coexistence with the Soviets seem as far
away as ever.
As explosive and important as all
these issues are, they have been all but
forgotten in the past two weeks as atten
tion has focused on the economy. As ac
cusations have flown back and forth
over Reagan's economic policy, Rea
gan has stooped to making any number
of dubious assertions in an effort to ob
scure his responsibility for the current
slump. Reagan's recent statement, for
example, that his record $1.5 trillion
five-year defense buildup and $750
billion five-year tax cut have not con
tributed to his record-breaking budget
deficits defies any sense of truth and
reason. The simple and unavoidable
truth is that Reagan's policies of tight
money, tax cuts and huge defense ex
penditures has brought down inflation
at the cost of the worst recession since
the Great Depression, 10.1 percent un
employment, federal deficits of over

$100 billion, and high interest rates.
The outlook for the future is hardly any
brighter as the White House is working
on a budget for next year with a
projected deficit of $170 billion. As
Paul Samuelson confirmed in a recent
New York Times opinion, the surge in
the stock market was based not on an
optimistic assessment of Reaganomics,
but on the expectation that the econo
my and the demand for private invest
ment capital will be so weak during the
next quarter that interest rates will have
to come down.
Despite this gloomy forecast, the Re
publicans are still harboring hopes for a
fair showing in the Nov. 2 election
Many have understandably distanced
themselves from Reagan's ill-conceived
policies, though it is questionable that
they would actively oppose them in
Washington. Others have banked on
Reagan's ability as the "Great Com
municator" to convince voters that his
policies are in fact working as planned.

the corner as it supposedly has been for
the last two years, that women really
don't need any guarantee of equal
rights, that he is genuinely interested in
arms limitations, and that the people of
El Salvador really would rather be dead
than red. Finally, some Republicans
take heart from the fact that women,
poor people, minorities, and the un
employed might feel so despondent and
helpless that they simply won't vote be
cause they feel that it won't make any
difference. The outcome of the election
thus hinges on whether the millions of
people disaffected by two years of Re
publican policies realize that the course
that Reagan is urging them to stay is
one which leads to social, environmen
tal. political and economic disaster, and
whether they have the determination to
change it.

justice and equal opportunity that lie at
the heart of the American political sys
tem. Since the very start of his cam
paign, when he contributed to the de
feat of the Equal Rights Amendment
even as he lauded the rights and free
doms of individuals, it has been clear
that Reagan does not consider women
and minorities to be among those indi
viduals deserving of equal rights. Rea
gan argued that the Constitution was
too important and inflexible a docu
ment to contain anything as radical as a
guarantee of equal rights for men and
women, yet he and his Republican allies
do not consider it too sacrosanct for
amendments providing for prayer in
public schools and outlawing abortions
even in the first few weeks of pregnancy.
Taken together with Reagan's ongoing
attempt to grant tax credits to racially
discriminatory schools, his tax policies
which have favored the well-to-do at
the expense of the poor in a vain at
tempt to stimulate economic growth
through the wonders of trickle-down
economics and Social Darwinism, and
his deep budget cuts in social programs
such as Aid to Families with Dependent
Children and the cutbacks in Social Se
curity that he will undoubtedly pursue
after the election, these social policies
have been a formula for injustice and
inequality.
Reagan's environmental policies
over the past two years were almost bad
enough to make his social policies look
good in comparison. Reagan's Secre
tary of the Interior, James Watt, has
been so anxious to exhaust all of our
natural resources before the second
coming of the Lord that he has virtually
declared all public lands open territory
for commercial development and en
vironmental destruction. Watt has been
so hasty in his attempts to open off
shore sites for oil drilling that oil com
panies have complained that they don't
have the resources to assess all of the
land that Watt is so intent on giving
away.
Watt's disregard for the environment
is rivaled only by Anne Gorsuch, Rea
gan's Environmental Protection Agen
cy director who told several corporate
executives that she would not enforce
standards for emissions of lead, which
is extremely toxic to children even in
small quantities. This incident is in
dicative of the course of EPA enforce
ment and of Reagan's attitudes
toward the environment. While there is
a legitimate case to be made for the
trade-off between pollution control and
economic production, Reagan's en
vironmental executioners have been so
rabidly against regulation of any sort
that they have been quick to favor pol
luters even when the economic interests
involved have been minimal and the
costs in human health and environmen
tal quality enormous.
It is difficult to trace Reagan's two
years of foreign policy because he has
vacillated between having no foreign
policy at all and having several con
tradictory policies at the same time. The
only consistent theme has been a return
to the simplistic Cold War anti-com
munism of the 19505, yet the adminis
tration's showcase anti-communist pol
icy in El Salvador threatens to mire the
United States in a Latin American Viet
nam. The Reagan administration's
blindness to the murders and tortures
carried out by government troops in El
Salvador and Guatemala has under
mined the moral force of U.S. argu
ments against Soviet transgressions in

Poland and Afghanistan and has sepa
rated the United States from its Eu
ropean allies at a time when trans
atlantic unity is needed most. The ob
vious hypocrisy of Reagan's refusal to
allow U.S. and European companies to
work on the Soviet pipeline while at the
same time supporting United States
grain sales to the Soviet Union, has
brought U.S.-European relations to a
new low. Finally, Reagan's Cold War
rhetoric and talk of "limited nuclear
war," combined with his rapid and ex
pensive arms buildup and lack of in
terest in serious arms limitations talks
with the Soviets, has apparently wor
ried everyone but the U.S.S.R. If the
Soviets are intimidated by Reagan's
militarism, they will undoubtedly re
spond by building even more arms.
While Reagan's recent peace initiative
in the Mideast, which has been praised
by both moderate Israelis and moderate
Arabs, might signify a reasonable trend
in his foreign policy decisions under the

Since the very start of his campaign, when he
contributed to the defeat of the Equal Rights
Amendment even as he lauded the rights and
freedoms of individuals, it has been clear that
Reagan does not consider women and minorities to
be among those individuals deserving of equal
rights.

Secretary of State George Shultz, peace
in El Salvador and peaceful and stable
coexistence with the Soviets seem as far
away as ever.
As explosive and important as all
these issues are, they have been all but
forgotten in the past two weeks as atten
tion has focused on the economy. As ac
cusations have flown back and forth
over Reagan's economic policy, Rea
gan has stooped to making any number
of dubious assertions in an effort to ob
scure his responsibility for the current
slump. Reagan's recent statement, for
example, that his record $1.5 trillion
five-year defense buildup and $750
billion five-year tax cut have not con
tributed to his record-breaking budget
deficits defies any sense of truth and
reason. The simple and unavoidable
truth is that Reagan's policies of tight
money, tax cuts and huge defense ex
penditures has brought down inflation
at the cost of the worst recession since
the Great Depression, 10.1 percent un
employment, federal deficits of over

$100 billion, and high interest rates.
The outlook for the future is hardly any
brighter as the White House is working
on a budget for next year with a
projected deficit of $170 billion. As
Paul Samuelson confirmed in a recent
New York Times opinion, the surge in
the stock market was based not on an
optimistic assessment of Reaganomics,
but on the expectation that the econo
my and the demand for private invest
ment capital will be so weak during the
next quarter that interest rates will have
to come down.
Despite this gloomy forecast, the Re
publicans are still harboring hopes for a
fair showing in the Nov. 2 election
Many have understandably distanced
themselves from Reagan's ill-conceived
policies, though it is questionable that
they would actively oppose them in
Washington. Others have banked on
Reagan's ability as the "Great Com
municator" to convince voters that his
policies are in fact working as planned.

that economic recovery is just around
the corner as it supposedly has been for
the last two years, that women really
don't need any guarantee of equal
rights, that he is genuinely interested in
arms limitations, and that the people of
El Salvador really would rather be dead
than red. Finally, some Republicans
take heart from the fact that women,
poor people, minorities, and the un
employed might feel so despondent and
helpless that they simply won't vote be
cause they feel that it won't make any
difference. The outcome of the election
thus hinges on whether the millions of
people disaffected by two years of Re
publican policies realize that the course
that Reagan is urging them to stay is
one which leads to social, environmen
tal. political and economic disaster, and
whether they have the determination to
change it.
