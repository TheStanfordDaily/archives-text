# Town & Country Market strike drags on
## 
### KRISTEN CHRISTOPHER Senior staff writer 
Pickets at the Town and Country Village super
market have been on the line for eight months al
ready, and they may be there a lot longer if a settle
ment is not reached before Nov. 8.
An unfair labor practice hearing is scheduled to
begin on that date. However, Ron Lind, director of
organizing for United Food and Commercial Work
ers, Local 428, said that the workers would "have to
wait six to 12 months for a decision from the admin
istrative law judge," and if there is an appeal of that
decision, the final judgment could be delayed anoth
er six to eight months.
The National Labor Relations Board is trying to
bring about a settlement prior to the hearing. How
ever, a meeting yesterday between David Miller, a
prosecuter for the NLRB, and John Meany, the
market's present owner, did not produce any major
breakthroughs, according to Miller.
The picketers are union members who worked at
the store before Meany assumed ownership in Feb
ruary. According to Al Manzano, a former clerk, he
and other union members were "constructively
fired" by the new owner, meaning that he refused to
hire them.
Manzano is one of two former workers who are
still picketing. The other employees have either
found new jobs or have withdrawn from the union

and resumed their previous positions at the market.
Manzano and Lind said that there is an existing
contract which requires the market to hire union
workers. The contract is good until next February
and contains a successor clause, meaning that it can
not be affected by a change in ownership.
The complaint filed by the union alleges that
Meany has broken the contract and is discriminat
ing by not hiring union members, according to
Miller.
Miller explained that after the union files a
charge, the NLRB investigates the case in an at
tempt "to find a resolution short of litigation."
However, Meany felt that the original investigation
did not give him the opportunity to thoroughly out
line his position, so meetings with the NLRB are
now taking place.
Lind said "the NLRB has been trying to get
Meany to settle," but that Meany doesn't want to
because there is "substantial back-pay liability, and
he doesn't want to recognize the union." Lind said
the crux of the dispute is the fact that Meany will not
recognize the union.
Meany told the Daily that he is "a victim of cir
cumstances," because of the complications in own
ership that occured before he took over the store.
"We're the third person on a match . .. we're paying
for the wrong of what someone did in front of us,"
he said.

Before last November the market was owned by
Cole Bridges. When Bridges ran into financial dif
ficulties, the State Board of Trade took over the
store and then transferred it to the Town and Coun
try Corp.
Meany said he was not aware of a contract be
tween the corporation and the union. "We took over
in good faith under what had gone on," he said.
Manzano denied this, saying, "He (Meany) knew
what he was doing."
Though the union is directing most of its griev
ances against Meany, it also has claims against the
corporation, according to Byron Mellberg, the cor
poration's attorney. The union is charging that
Town and Country failed to bargain over both the
contract and changes in health and benefit
payments, Mellberg said.
Meany said he sympathizes with the workers'
claims against the corporation.
The union is also charging that Meany "con
ducted surveillance of union activities," said Lind,
"and that's illegal under the National Labor Rela
tions Act."
Meany said he took pictures of the pickets and
taped their conversations because they were being
"totally unlawful." He said "they had 40 or 50 peo
ple harassing older people, not letting them in the
door."


NO END IN SIGHT: After eight months of
picketing, chances are still slim for a settlement
of the strike by former retail clerks against
Town & Country Market.
