Talking Back to the Night
Island

There is a limit that one person
can accomplish all alone. Even
tually, one will need the help, ad
vice or interaction of others to
perfect his trade. This goes for
athletics, where even a star quar
terback cannot be a winner if he
doesn't have an all-round team
behind him. He just cannot do it
all by himself. This also applies to
the field of music. One person
cannot do it all, not matter how
talented that person is. Even a
Paul McCartney cannot do a to
tally solo album that is musically
exciting and proficient (as his
McCartney II album clearly
pointed out). And if that person
is a lesser talent than McCartney,
then he should have no chance to
iiake an album that is solely the
$ork of one person.
However, Steve Winwood saw
that chance and took it. After a
classic period as writer and lead
Ivocalist of Traffic, Winwood "re
tired" from the musical business.
In 1980 though, Winwood re
turned as a total solo artist. On
'Arc of a Diver, Winwood played
every instrument, sang every note
and produced the album all on
his own (his lone assistance came
•from lyricist Will Jennings).
Amazingly, on Arc of a Diver, the
, results were not only musically
proficient, they were stimulating.
The songs rocked and swayed the
'"listener endlessly.
However, as I stated before,
»ne person can only go so far on
■' lis own. This is quite evident on
Winwood's new solo album,
Talking Back To The Night. On
!his album, Winwood's music, al

though at times pleasant and
pretty, is very predictable and un
varied. He has basically run out
of good ideas for a one-man band
— his voice is still masterful and
it is the key to the music, but even
this asset cannot make up for the
lack of musical direction and
growth found on the album.
Side One starts off with mater i
al that could have been on Arc of
a Diver. "Valerie" and "Big Girls
Walk Away" are the upbeat,
soulful style of songs that
Winwood is capable of. How
ever, as the side progresses the
songs get stuck in a mold, and by
side two, the music gets narrow
and constrained. Even catchy
tunes such as "Still In The
Game" and the title cut, "Talk
ing Back to the Night," cannot
save the weaker contributions in
between.

The album lacks drive, which
usually can only come from
group interactions and involve
ments that further musical direc
tion.
Winwood downplays the use
of guitars, horns and piano
(which were Traffic's forte) and
instead emphasizes more syn
thesizer and electronic music.
This is itself is a major mistake. A
synthesizer cannot add the per
sonal characteristics (and quirks)
that a full group can. Songs like
"It Was Happiness" and "Help
Me Angel" are synthesizer
schlock. Therefore, this lack of
musical diversity and vitality is
the album's biggest failure.
Another flaw of the album is
lyrical content. The lyrics (again
written in part with Will Jen

hottest stars in rock, who hap
pens to be an admirer of hers,
write a song for her. Bruce
Springsteen's "Protection" could
have been the album's best song.
It certainly has the best lyrics,
and Summer's voice has the ap
propriate raucousness to carry it
off. "We . . . stare out at the
shadows down below/ I feel your
fingers on my face./ I want to
stay; I want to run away," she
murmurs in her sexy, throaty
voice. Unfortunately, Jones has
decided that the raucousness of
Springsteen's guitar and Roy Bit
tan's piano are too much and
buries them both in the mix, be
hind a superrslick synthesizer
that seems completely antithet
ical to Springsteen's intention in
writing the song.
Two of the most maligned en
tities in today's "intellectual" so
ciety are those of religion and pa
triotism. When an artist tackles
these topics, he or she can easily

he could pay the rent/ Played all
the aces and wound up presi
dent," and "Waitin' on tables
and pumpin' gasoline/ She
served an agent now she's a mov
ine queen," seem incredibly
simple-minded. Summer also lets
us know in the liner notes that she
dedicates this one to all her fans.
Thanks, but I'll take the Spring
steen song.
Summer also includes a cover
of Billy Strayhorn's classic "Lush
Life." Her vocals aren't quite
strong enough to imbue this with
the necessary passion and beauty
required, so its only purpose
seems to be to show us how artis
tically diverse she is. Instead, it
gives the album a forced, uncom
fortable feeling that is the com
plete opposite of the very natural
diversity that was shown on The
Wanderer. The rest of the songs
on the LP are completely un
noteworthy. They seem to be per
functory space fillers, completely
