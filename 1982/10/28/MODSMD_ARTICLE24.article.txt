# Donna Summer wanders too far

When Donna Summer, a vo
calist and artist of considerable
talent, teams up wiih Quincy
Jones, an equally talented pro
ducer, one would expect an
album of outstanding energy and
artistry. Unfortunately, what one
gets from Jones production of
Summer's second album on Gef
fen Records, Donna Summer, is a
stunning example of mediocrity.
This is especially disappointing
because it follows the success of
her first album for Geffen, The
Wanderer. The Wanderer was an
album so imaginative, fresh and
adventurous that it had the feel
ing of a debut album. It was Sum

mer's best record and one of the
ten best of 1980. Donna Summer
has some of this but the moments
are too few and far between.
One of these moments does oc
cur in the opening song "Love is
in Control (Finger on the Trig
ger)." This is a tantalizing vision
of what the album could have
been — Jones' production and
Summer's vocals have never been
better. Summer whoops and
hollers in a way that brings the
song alive. This is a song with so
much verve and energy it prac
tically screams at you to get up
and move. It's a pity that such an
intensity and excitement couldn't
have been maintained through
out the entire album.
Summer was also extremely
fortunate to have one of the

become over-mystical or over
sentimental. Summer takes on
both of these with mixed results.
The Vangelis (of "Chariots of
Fire" fame) and Jon Anderson
penned song, "State of' Inde
pendence," is lovely — the mys
ticism of the lyrics isn't too
heavy-handed and the funky
calypso beat is quite compelling.
Moreover who can go wrong
with a back-up choir that in
cludes Michael Jackson, Kenny
Loggins, Michael McDonald
and Stevie Wonder? Un
fortunately, Summer doesn't fare
as well on her patriotic tune,
"Livin' in America." Despite a
catchy refrain, the lyrics are so in
credibly naive, that one is embar
rased to be caught listening to it.
Lyrics like "He had to hustle so

devoid of feeling or excitement.
Summer and Jones were often
at odds as to the direction the
album should take, and this is ap
parent. The album has no uni
fying solidity. Solidity may seem
at odds with diversity, but there
are many bands (Rickie Lee
Jones and The Clash come most
immediately to mind) who utilize
a number of different musical
styles, yet manage to come up
with a vision that is completely
their own. When and if Summer
is able to do this, by following the
instincts that were so right on The
Wanderer, she will truly be a su
perstar and an artist. Until then,
we may be subjected to many
more albums that are crammed
full of star power, yet have no
real artistry.
