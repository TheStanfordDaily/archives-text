# Herzog's Fitzcarraldo: Eraserhead on the Amazon?
## 
### STEVE VINEBERG 
The Werner Herzog who emerges in
Burden of Dreams, Les Blank's fascinat
ing documentary about the making of
Herzog's Filzcarraldo, is a self-con
scious romantic. After suffering a series
of fiascoes (the forced abandonment of
the original shooting site near the Peru-
Ecuador border because of the protests
of local Indians, the loss of original
stars Jason Robards and Mick Jagger,
due respectively to illness and prior
commitments) and having to recom
mence the entire project, Herzog began
to court disaster. He insisted on estab
lishing his cast and crew at a location in
the Peruvian jungle so remote that, in
evitably, technical difficulties grew le
gion . Both the whites and the natives in
volved in the film became restless and
dispirited as the intended weeks of
shooting dragged on into months.
Burden of Dreams points to the in
escapable parallel between Herzog's
persistence in the face of adversity and

Larry Maslon/ DAILY

the persistence of his hero, Brian
Sweeney Fitzgerald (known as Fitzcar
raldo), who hauls a ship over a moun
tain in an effort to open up virgin jungle
land to the rubber industry — so that he
can finance his crazy dream to build an
opera house in his home village,
Iquitos, and invite Caruso to sing at the
opening. Unfortunately, Herzog saw
the same comparison, and this immense
undertaking clearly took on the color of
Fitzcarraldo's dream because Herzog
wanted it to. When you watch Burden of
Dreams and see the unnecessary dis
comfort — and even danger — that he
inflicted on his company; when you
hear the explanation of the engineer
who quit because, having designed a
system for moving the prop ship up a
hill with a twenty-degree slope, he
learned that Herzog planned to use a
hill with a forty-degree slope; when you
listen to the actors complaining about
being trapped in the unbearable heat of
the jungle — then Herzog's glorious

dream begins to seem like a stupid,
sadistic game. And when you see
Fitzcarraldo, you're more than ever
convinced of the pointlessness of the ex
tremes to which Herzog carried his
scheme. It's a limp, shapeless movie.
Herzog has devoted his career to dis
covering new kinds of realism, new
ways of getting experience onto the
screen. This may sound nobler in theory
than it is in fact: hypnotizing your ac
tors (as he reputedly did in Heart of
Glass) or sticking them in a jungle for
months in the hope that they'll begin to
act like people caught in the wilderness
(his admitted intention in Fitzcarraldo)
is more likely to result in meaningless
lethargy than in great, revelatory acting
(Martin Sheen's drunken jag early in
Apocalypse Now, shot while Sheen was
actually drunk, furnished ample proof
that actors don't perform well when
they're out of control). Herzog's
strategy has completely backfired in
Fitzcarraldo — no one in the picture
looks convincing. The crowd scenes
have the dreadful perfunctory feeling of
bad Hollywood spectacles: when the
citizens of Iquitos gather to wave
Fitzcarraldo off at the dock, one thinks
of the MGM version of Show Boat with
Howard Keel and Kathryn Grayson
(comically, there is a twin scene of the
same actors, in identical formation,
welcoming him home; Herzog obvious
ly shot both on the same afternoon),
and when the allegedly frightening
Jivaros Indians present a barricade to
Fitzcarraldo's ship, the real-life Indians
look so unengaged that you wonder if
you're watching outtakes instead of a
finished sequence. (The last time I re
member experiencing this peculiar mix
ture of incredulous bewilderment and
embarrassment was during the party
scenes in The Great Gatsby.)
If no one in the movie connects with
the camera, Klaus Kinski, as Fitzcar
raldo, doesn't connect with anyone else.
His choices indicate an error in logic
parallel to Herzog's: he confuses
playing a character who inhabits a dif
ferent world from those around him to
acting as if everyone else were inhabit
ing a different movie. With his straw
colored hair standing on end, he bears a
closer resemblance to Eraserhead than
to any recognizable human being, and
he keeps his steely blue eyes wide open
all the time, as if he were still under hyp
nosis. In a two-minute clip from the ori
ginal footage, included in Burden of
Dreams, Jason Robards exhibited more
real obsessive intensity than Kinski
does in two-and-a-half hours; Kinski
doesn't have the wit to play an obsessed
dreamer, and there's no fire in his eyes.

Herzog, who has directed Kinski five
times, may think that this kind of theat
rical insistence is a pathway to the new
realism he seeks, but it's a dead end:
Kinski makes Fitzcarraldo so un
fathomable that he blocks our access to
the movie. (His weird presence has, in
fact, only worked once for Herzog — he
was creepily other-worldly as Nosferatu
the Vampyre.)
Herzog has always lacked a sense of
pace — his last Peruvian epic, Aguirre,
the Wrath of God, had its own in
digenous time scheme; until I looked at
my watch, sometime in the middle of
the movie, I didn't know if hours or
days had elapsed. But he is an ex
traordinary image-maker: the finale of
Aguirre, with the camera circling the ex
peditionary boat while Kinski stood,
pinioned by arrows like Saint Sebas
tian, was truly startling, and so was
much of Nosferatu. (Some of it had the
malevolent elegance of Bocklin's paint
ings.) Amazingly, his eye deserts him in
Fitzcarraldo, which is visually so flat
and undifferentiated that it might as
well have been shot on a studio backlot
(Thomas Mauch was the photogra
pher). We can see that we're supposed
to appreciate the beauty of the jungle
sunsets, but there are too many of them
and they are held far too long; the
mountains, presumably the hero's real
adversary, never take on the grandeur
we expect. And sequence after sequence
is botched, often in puzzling ways. The
major set piece, of course, is the trans
porting of the ship by hordes of reverent
Jivaros up an impossible incline;
Herzog rigged up an intricate system of
logs and cables for the purpose, but he
has shot it in such a disjointed fashion
that we can't figure out how it works.
When one of the Indians is crushed un
der a log, four others rush to pull him
out and their backs present an obstacle
to the camera. And when the ship final
ly begins to crawl up the mountain,
Herzog holds the camera in too close,
focussed on exactly what we have no in
terest in seeing — the juncture at which
the cables fasten to the ship, the log
rollers — so by the time he pulls back to
show us, in long shot, the entire ship in
motion, the spectacle and the suspense
have been undercut.
I don't think I've ever seen a movie in
which so many potentially grand poetic
moments have been rendered so mys
teriously, abruptly banal. Ridiculed at a
banquet at the home of a rubber poten
tate (Jose Lewgoy), Fitzcarraldo storms
off, clutching his Victrola and his pre
cious Caruso recordings to his chest,
followed by his mistress, the broth
elkeeper Molly (Claudia Cardinale),

and her troop of whores; but the scene
isn't magnificent, it isn't funny — it
isn't anything. A glimpse of a per
formance of Verdi's Ernani. with
Caruso (Costante Moret) singing op
posite Sarah Bernhardt (Jean-Claude
Dreyfuss) while a soprano fills in for her
at the corner of the stage, looks so
absurd — the soprano is as obviously
dubbed as Bernhardt, and we keep
wondering why Bernhardt is being
played by a man in drag — that Herzog
appears to be poking fun at Fitzcar
raldo's dream, too. When Fitzcarraldo
presents a block of ice to the leader of
the Jivaros, they are so astonished by
what they take to be the depth of the
white man's magic that they freeze —
but they certainly don't look
astonished, so the scene (perhaps in
spired by a marvellous incident in
Gabriel Marquez's novel One Hundred
Years of Solitude) has no climax.
Herzog has portrayed the Jivaros as a
frustratingly unemotional bunch, and
their relationship to Fitzcarraldo is
elusive. We are told that they look on
him as a white god, and on his ship as
their salvation, releasing them from the
curse of the water spirits, but their awe
of him isn't visible. And he is so stolidly
unreceptive to their overtures of hospi
tality, and so careless of their safety,
that we keep waiting for them to rebel.
They do, but in a way that we couldn't

have foreseen: after the ship has scaled
the mountain, they cut the ropes and
leave it to drift into the rapids, as a sac
rifice to the river deities. Herzog may
have intended to say something here
about the clash of cultures, but dramat
ically, at least, the Jivaros and the
whites manning Fitzcarraldo's ship
never clash — they run in separate
channels. And we're cheated of drama
even in the ship's destruction on the
rocks, which Herzog has turned into a
musical number, with Caruso singing
while the ship dances in coy flirtation
with the shore. (We're not told who put
the record on the turntable at this inap
propriate time.) Yes, it's a lovely image
— perhaps the only really surprising
one in the film — but it's miserably mis
timed.
In the interviews in Burden of
Dreams, Herzog looks like a nine
teenth-century figure, but when he
speaks, his measured, dispassionate
tone gives us the impression that he is
strangely divorced from the elaborate
disasters he recounts. That sense of dis
continuity carries into the movie.
Fitzcarraldo is a story about an in
curable romantic with a poetic ob
session, and it's directed by an obsessive
who fancies himself a romantic but
shows no evidence of either heart or
soul. The resultant movie is dead — and
peculiarly disturbing.

persistence in the face of adversity and

Larry Maslon/ DAILY

the persistence of his hero, Brian
Sweeney Fitzgerald (known as Fitzcar
raldo), who hauls a ship over a moun
tain in an effort to open up virgin jungle
land to the rubber industry — so that he
can finance his crazy dream to build an
opera house in his home village,
Iquitos, and invite Caruso to sing at the
opening. Unfortunately, Herzog saw
the same comparison, and this immense
undertaking clearly took on the color of
Fitzcarraldo's dream because Herzog
wanted it to. When you watch Burden of
Dreams and see the unnecessary dis
comfort — and even danger — that he
inflicted on his company; when you
hear the explanation of the engineer
who quit because, having designed a
system for moving the prop ship up a
hill with a twenty-degree slope, he
learned that Herzog planned to use a
hill with a forty-degree slope; when you
listen to the actors complaining about
being trapped in the unbearable heat of
the jungle — then Herzog's glorious

dream begins to seem like a stupid,
sadistic game. And when you see
Fitzcarraldo, you're more than ever
convinced of the pointlessness of the ex
tremes to which Herzog carried his
scheme. It's a limp, shapeless movie.
Herzog has devoted his career to dis
covering new kinds of realism, new
ways of getting experience onto the
screen. This may sound nobler in theory
than it is in fact: hypnotizing your ac
tors (as he reputedly did in Heart of
Glass) or sticking them in a jungle for
months in the hope that they'll begin to
act like people caught in the wilderness
(his admitted intention in Fitzcarraldo)
is more likely to result in meaningless
lethargy than in great, revelatory acting
(Martin Sheen's drunken jag early in
Apocalypse Now, shot while Sheen was
actually drunk, furnished ample proof
that actors don't perform well when
they're out of control). Herzog's
strategy has completely backfired in
Fitzcarraldo — no one in the picture
looks convincing. The crowd scenes
have the dreadful perfunctory feeling of
bad Hollywood spectacles: when the
citizens of Iquitos gather to wave
Fitzcarraldo off at the dock, one thinks
of the MGM version of Show Boat with
Howard Keel and Kathryn Grayson
(comically, there is a twin scene of the
same actors, in identical formation,
welcoming him home; Herzog obvious
ly shot both on the same afternoon),
and when the allegedly frightening
Jivaros Indians present a barricade to
Fitzcarraldo's ship, the real-life Indians
look so unengaged that you wonder if
you're watching outtakes instead of a
finished sequence. (The last time I re
member experiencing this peculiar mix
ture of incredulous bewilderment and
embarrassment was during the party
scenes in The Great Gatsby.)
If no one in the movie connects with
the camera, Klaus Kinski, as Fitzcar
raldo, doesn't connect with anyone else.
His choices indicate an error in logic
parallel to Herzog's: he confuses
playing a character who inhabits a dif
ferent world from those around him to
acting as if everyone else were inhabit
ing a different movie. With his straw
colored hair standing on end, he bears a
closer resemblance to Eraserhead than
to any recognizable human being, and
he keeps his steely blue eyes wide open
all the time, as if he were still under hyp
nosis. In a two-minute clip from the ori
ginal footage, included in Burden of
Dreams, Jason Robards exhibited more
real obsessive intensity than Kinski
does in two-and-a-half hours; Kinski
doesn't have the wit to play an obsessed
dreamer, and there's no fire in his eyes.

Herzog, who has directed Kinski five
times, may think that this kind of theat
rical insistence is a pathway to the new
realism he seeks, but it's a dead end:
Kinski makes Fitzcarraldo so un
fathomable that he blocks our access to
the movie. (His weird presence has, in
fact, only worked once for Herzog — he
was creepily other-worldly as Nosferatu
the Vampyre.)
Herzog has always lacked a sense of
pace — his last Peruvian epic, Aguirre,
the Wrath of God, had its own in
digenous time scheme; until I looked at
my watch, sometime in the middle of
the movie, I didn't know if hours or
days had elapsed. But he is an ex
traordinary image-maker: the finale of
Aguirre, with the camera circling the ex
peditionary boat while Kinski stood,
pinioned by arrows like Saint Sebas
tian, was truly startling, and so was
much of Nosferatu. (Some of it had the
malevolent elegance of Bocklin's paint
ings.) Amazingly, his eye deserts him in
Fitzcarraldo, which is visually so flat
and undifferentiated that it might as
well have been shot on a studio backlot
(Thomas Mauch was the photogra
pher). We can see that we're supposed
to appreciate the beauty of the jungle
sunsets, but there are too many of them
and they are held far too long; the
mountains, presumably the hero's real
adversary, never take on the grandeur
we expect. And sequence after sequence
is botched, often in puzzling ways. The
major set piece, of course, is the trans
porting of the ship by hordes of reverent
Jivaros up an impossible incline;
Herzog rigged up an intricate system of
logs and cables for the purpose, but he
has shot it in such a disjointed fashion
that we can't figure out how it works.
When one of the Indians is crushed un
der a log, four others rush to pull him
out and their backs present an obstacle
to the camera. And when the ship final
ly begins to crawl up the mountain,
Herzog holds the camera in too close,
focussed on exactly what we have no in
terest in seeing — the juncture at which
the cables fasten to the ship, the log
rollers — so by the time he pulls back to
show us, in long shot, the entire ship in
motion, the spectacle and the suspense
have been undercut.
I don't think I've ever seen a movie in
which so many potentially grand poetic
moments have been rendered so mys
teriously, abruptly banal. Ridiculed at a
banquet at the home of a rubber poten
tate (Jose Lewgoy), Fitzcarraldo storms
off, clutching his Victrola and his pre
cious Caruso recordings to his chest,
followed by his mistress, the broth
elkeeper Molly (Claudia Cardinale),

and her troop of whores; but the scene
isn't magnificent, it isn't funny — it
isn't anything. A glimpse of a per
formance of Verdi's Ernani. with
Caruso (Costante Moret) singing op
posite Sarah Bernhardt (Jean-Claude
Dreyfuss) while a soprano fills in for her
at the corner of the stage, looks so
absurd — the soprano is as obviously
dubbed as Bernhardt, and we keep
wondering why Bernhardt is being
played by a man in drag — that Herzog
appears to be poking fun at Fitzcar
raldo's dream, too. When Fitzcarraldo
presents a block of ice to the leader of
the Jivaros, they are so astonished by
what they take to be the depth of the
white man's magic that they freeze —
but they certainly don't look
astonished, so the scene (perhaps in
spired by a marvellous incident in
Gabriel Marquez's novel One Hundred
Years of Solitude) has no climax.
Herzog has portrayed the Jivaros as a
frustratingly unemotional bunch, and
their relationship to Fitzcarraldo is
elusive. We are told that they look on
him as a white god, and on his ship as
their salvation, releasing them from the
curse of the water spirits, but their awe
of him isn't visible. And he is so stolidly
unreceptive to their overtures of hospi
tality, and so careless of their safety,
that we keep waiting for them to rebel.
They do, but in a way that we couldn't

have foreseen: after the ship has scaled
the mountain, they cut the ropes and
leave it to drift into the rapids, as a sac
rifice to the river deities. Herzog may
have intended to say something here
about the clash of cultures, but dramat
ically, at least, the Jivaros and the
whites manning Fitzcarraldo's ship
never clash — they run in separate
channels. And we're cheated of drama
even in the ship's destruction on the
rocks, which Herzog has turned into a
musical number, with Caruso singing
while the ship dances in coy flirtation
with the shore. (We're not told who put
the record on the turntable at this inap
propriate time.) Yes, it's a lovely image
— perhaps the only really surprising
one in the film — but it's miserably mis
timed.
In the interviews in Burden of
Dreams, Herzog looks like a nine
teenth-century figure, but when he
speaks, his measured, dispassionate
tone gives us the impression that he is
strangely divorced from the elaborate
disasters he recounts. That sense of dis
continuity carries into the movie.
Fitzcarraldo is a story about an in
curable romantic with a poetic ob
session, and it's directed by an obsessive
who fancies himself a romantic but
shows no evidence of either heart or
soul. The resultant movie is dead — and
peculiarly disturbing.

The Werner Herzog who emerges in
Burden of Dreams, Les Blank's fascinat

Herzog's Filzcarraldo, is a self-con

of fiascoes (the forced abandonment of
the original shooting site near the Peru-
Ecuador border because of the protests
of local Indians, the loss of original
stars Jason Robards and Mick Jagger,
due respectively to illness and prior
commitments) and having to recom
mence the entire project, Herzog began
to court disaster. He insisted on estab
lishing his cast and crew at a location in
the Peruvian jungle so remote that, in
evitably, technical difficulties grew le
gion . Both the whites and the natives in
volved in the film became restless and
dispirited as the intended weeks of
shooting dragged on into months.

being trapped in the unbearable heat of
the jungle — then Herzog's glorious

dream begins to seem like a stupid,
sadistic game. And when you see
Fitzcarraldo, you're more than ever
convinced of the pointlessness of the ex
tremes to which Herzog carried his
scheme. It's a limp, shapeless movie.
Herzog has devoted his career to dis
covering new kinds of realism, new
ways of getting experience onto the
screen. This may sound nobler in theory
than it is in fact: hypnotizing your ac
tors (as he reputedly did in Heart of
Glass) or sticking them in a jungle for
months in the hope that they'll begin to
act like people caught in the wilderness
(his admitted intention in Fitzcarraldo)
is more likely to result in meaningless
lethargy than in great, revelatory acting
(Martin Sheen's drunken jag early in
Apocalypse Now, shot while Sheen was
actually drunk, furnished ample proof
that actors don't perform well when
they're out of control). Herzog's
strategy has completely backfired in
Fitzcarraldo — no one in the picture
looks convincing. The crowd scenes
have the dreadful perfunctory feeling of
bad Hollywood spectacles: when the
citizens of Iquitos gather to wave
Fitzcarraldo off at the dock, one thinks
of the MGM version of Show Boat with
Howard Keel and Kathryn Grayson
(comically, there is a twin scene of the
same actors, in identical formation,
welcoming him home; Herzog obvious
ly shot both on the same afternoon),
and when the allegedly frightening
Jivaros Indians present a barricade to
Fitzcarraldo's ship, the real-life Indians
look so unengaged that you wonder if
you're watching outtakes instead of a
finished sequence. (The last time I re
member experiencing this peculiar mix
ture of incredulous bewilderment and
embarrassment was during the party
scenes in The Great Gatsby.)
If no one in the movie connects with
the camera, Klaus Kinski, as Fitzcar
raldo, doesn't connect with anyone else.
His choices indicate an error in logic
parallel to Herzog's: he confuses
playing a character who inhabits a dif
ferent world from those around him to
acting as if everyone else were inhabit
ing a different movie. With his straw
colored hair standing on end, he bears a
closer resemblance to Eraserhead than
to any recognizable human being, and
he keeps his steely blue eyes wide open
all the time, as if he were still under hyp
nosis. In a two-minute clip from the ori
ginal footage, included in Burden of
Dreams, Jason Robards exhibited more
real obsessive intensity than Kinski
does in two-and-a-half hours; Kinski
doesn't have the wit to play an obsessed
dreamer, and there's no fire in his eyes.

Herzog, who has directed Kinski five
times, may think that this kind of theat
rical insistence is a pathway to the new
realism he seeks, but it's a dead end:
Kinski makes Fitzcarraldo so un
fathomable that he blocks our access to
the movie. (His weird presence has, in
fact, only worked once for Herzog — he
was creepily other-worldly as Nosferatu
the Vampyre.)
Herzog has always lacked a sense of
pace — his last Peruvian epic, Aguirre,
the Wrath of God, had its own in
digenous time scheme; until I looked at
my watch, sometime in the middle of
the movie, I didn't know if hours or
days had elapsed. But he is an ex
traordinary image-maker: the finale of
Aguirre, with the camera circling the ex
peditionary boat while Kinski stood,
pinioned by arrows like Saint Sebas
tian, was truly startling, and so was
much of Nosferatu. (Some of it had the
malevolent elegance of Bocklin's paint
ings.) Amazingly, his eye deserts him in
Fitzcarraldo, which is visually so flat
and undifferentiated that it might as
well have been shot on a studio backlot
(Thomas Mauch was the photogra
pher). We can see that we're supposed
to appreciate the beauty of the jungle
sunsets, but there are too many of them
and they are held far too long; the
mountains, presumably the hero's real
adversary, never take on the grandeur
we expect. And sequence after sequence
is botched, often in puzzling ways. The
major set piece, of course, is the trans
porting of the ship by hordes of reverent
Jivaros up an impossible incline;
Herzog rigged up an intricate system of
logs and cables for the purpose, but he
has shot it in such a disjointed fashion
that we can't figure out how it works.
When one of the Indians is crushed un
der a log, four others rush to pull him
out and their backs present an obstacle
to the camera. And when the ship final
ly begins to crawl up the mountain,
Herzog holds the camera in too close,
focussed on exactly what we have no in
terest in seeing — the juncture at which
the cables fasten to the ship, the log
rollers — so by the time he pulls back to
show us, in long shot, the entire ship in
motion, the spectacle and the suspense
have been undercut.
I don't think I've ever seen a movie in
which so many potentially grand poetic
moments have been rendered so mys
teriously, abruptly banal. Ridiculed at a
banquet at the home of a rubber poten
tate (Jose Lewgoy), Fitzcarraldo storms
off, clutching his Victrola and his pre
cious Caruso recordings to his chest,
followed by his mistress, the broth
elkeeper Molly (Claudia Cardinale),

and her troop of whores; but the scene
isn't magnificent, it isn't funny — it
isn't anything. A glimpse of a per
formance of Verdi's Ernani. with
Caruso (Costante Moret) singing op
posite Sarah Bernhardt (Jean-Claude
Dreyfuss) while a soprano fills in for her
at the corner of the stage, looks so
absurd — the soprano is as obviously
dubbed as Bernhardt, and we keep
wondering why Bernhardt is being
played by a man in drag — that Herzog
appears to be poking fun at Fitzcar
raldo's dream, too. When Fitzcarraldo
presents a block of ice to the leader of
the Jivaros, they are so astonished by
what they take to be the depth of the
white man's magic that they freeze —
but they certainly don't look
astonished, so the scene (perhaps in
spired by a marvellous incident in
Gabriel Marquez's novel One Hundred
Years of Solitude) has no climax.
Herzog has portrayed the Jivaros as a
frustratingly unemotional bunch, and
their relationship to Fitzcarraldo is
elusive. We are told that they look on
him as a white god, and on his ship as
their salvation, releasing them from the
curse of the water spirits, but their awe
of him isn't visible. And he is so stolidly
unreceptive to their overtures of hospi
tality, and so careless of their safety,
that we keep waiting for them to rebel.
They do, but in a way that we couldn't

have foreseen: after the ship has scaled
the mountain, they cut the ropes and
leave it to drift into the rapids, as a sac
rifice to the river deities. Herzog may
have intended to say something here
about the clash of cultures, but dramat
ically, at least, the Jivaros and the
whites manning Fitzcarraldo's ship
never clash — they run in separate
channels. And we're cheated of drama
even in the ship's destruction on the
rocks, which Herzog has turned into a
musical number, with Caruso singing
while the ship dances in coy flirtation
with the shore. (We're not told who put
the record on the turntable at this inap
propriate time.) Yes, it's a lovely image
— perhaps the only really surprising
one in the film — but it's miserably mis
timed.
In the interviews in Burden of
Dreams, Herzog looks like a nine
teenth-century figure, but when he
speaks, his measured, dispassionate
tone gives us the impression that he is
strangely divorced from the elaborate
disasters he recounts. That sense of dis
continuity carries into the movie.
Fitzcarraldo is a story about an in
curable romantic with a poetic ob
session, and it's directed by an obsessive
who fancies himself a romantic but
shows no evidence of either heart or
soul. The resultant movie is dead — and
peculiarly disturbing.

The Werner Herzog who emerges in
Burden of Dreams, Les Blank's fascinat
ing documentary about the making of
Herzog's Filzcarraldo, is a self-con
scious romantic. After suffering a series
of fiascoes (the forced abandonment of
the original shooting site near the Peru-
Ecuador border because of the protests
of local Indians, the loss of original
stars Jason Robards and Mick Jagger,
due respectively to illness and prior
commitments) and having to recom
mence the entire project, Herzog began
to court disaster. He insisted on estab
lishing his cast and crew at a location in
the Peruvian jungle so remote that, in
evitably, technical difficulties grew le
gion . Both the whites and the natives in
volved in the film became restless and
dispirited as the intended weeks of
shooting dragged on into months.
Burden of Dreams points to the in
escapable parallel between Herzog's
persistence in the face of adversity and

Larry Maslon/ DAILY

the persistence of his hero, Brian
Sweeney Fitzgerald (known as Fitzcar
raldo), who hauls a ship over a moun
tain in an effort to open up virgin jungle
land to the rubber industry — so that he
can finance his crazy dream to build an
opera house in his home village,
Iquitos, and invite Caruso to sing at the
opening. Unfortunately, Herzog saw
the same comparison, and this immense
undertaking clearly took on the color of
Fitzcarraldo's dream because Herzog
wanted it to. When you watch Burden of
Dreams and see the unnecessary dis
comfort — and even danger — that he
inflicted on his company; when you
hear the explanation of the engineer
who quit because, having designed a
system for moving the prop ship up a
hill with a twenty-degree slope, he
learned that Herzog planned to use a
hill with a forty-degree slope; when you
listen to the actors complaining about
being trapped in the unbearable heat of
the jungle — then Herzog's glorious

dream begins to seem like a stupid,
