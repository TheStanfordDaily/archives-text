# Paul Carrack follows the Lowe road
## 
### CHRIS BUTCHKO 
They weren't fooling anyone.
Not that they tried very hard, but
Monday's headlining act at our
local Keystone club featured
Paul Carrack only in the mar
quee. It was unquestionably a
tour to promote Carrack's new
release, Suburban Voodoo, and
his name was atop all the ad
vertising, but Nick Lowe's pres
ence loomed over the tour, mak
ing Carrack as necessary to the
tour as Monty Python is to the
Flying Circus.
The radio ads for the shows
showed a bit of this slant. "Paul
Carrack will- be at the 'Stone,"
they said. "And with him will be
Nick Lowe and his Noise to Go."
Then they'd stop playing what
ever song that were voicing over,
and assure the listener "If you
think Nick will just be playing the
bass, you're wrong!" and out
booms "Cruel to be Kind."
Why should poor Paul have
this kind of slight upon his fame?
Well, name some songs he's
done. Take your time. Put the pa
per down, think it over.
Day passes into night. Months
go by, the seasons continue in
their unchanging course. People
are born, get married, grow old
and die. Eventually v the moun
tains crumble and fall into the
sea, and yet the question remains:
what has Paul Carrack done?
It's not a hard question, really,
but the answer is a little elusive.
Some people who keep their eye
on FM pop hits may know that it
was he who sung Squeeze's hit,
"Tempted." Some with
archivists' memories may know
that he played with Roxy Music
for a while, and those twisted in
dividuals who research articles or
need to know vast piles of trivia
in order to seem hip will know
that he wrote and sang and early
'70s hit by the name of "How
Long (Has This Been Goin' On)"
for that monster super-group
Ace.
Why, then, does he lack even
some little recognition? He's not
very pretty, he's not very charis- !
matic, and he didn't stay in
Squeeze long enough to get
himself any kind of image.
Carrack says he quit Squeeze
after they let him sing a hit song
that they wrote because he was
awed by their songwriting tal
ents. Sure. Not a glimmer of an
idea that having a hit single with
that band might get him off on a
running start in a solo career of
his own. No greed here!
Actually, that might be true,
because in going off on his own
he has certainly moved to as
sociate himself with an act whose
songwriting abilities will awe no
one. This came out at the concert.
(What? He's going to mention
the concert now, of all things?)
About 250 people paid $12.50
to file into the Keystone and

watch Nick Lowe overshadow
Paul Carrack. This is a huge
amount for the 'Stone, maybe a
little too much, but I feel it is a
good move for the club, because
it gets a higher quality of acts. In
cidentally, the show was worth
the money, and there is no need
for me to mention the fact that re
viewers don't pay for their
tickets. None at all.
The opening acts were proof
for the need for higher prices to
bring class acts. Eddie and the
Tide and A.J. and the Defenders
opened (What? Were Bob Snot
and the Vandals busy that night?)
and did the type of highly for
gettable show that haunts the
Keystone.
After those two sets — during
which the Keystone staff, per
haps embarrassed by the high
ticket price, did not push the 'one
drink per set rule' — on came the
featured attractions. Carrack,
looking like a slightly dopey bar
tender in black pants and a white
shirt, ran to his keyboards set far
left of stage without a hint of re
action from the crowd.

Peculiar. The headliner runs
on stage and isn't noticed. Plus,
he's at far left. What're they
going to put center stage? Won
der no more. It's that famous
bassist Nick Lowe. Without a
bass. With a guitar.
The rest of the band fit well
with that kind of congruity. The
man carrying the bass was
dressed in cowboy black, looking
like some refugee from rock
abilly, and the drummer, lost in
his kit, looked like the Monkee's
Peter Tork. As for the lead
guitarist, notes from the concert
refer to a "horrible monster with
no neck." More about that later.
Carrack started the show with
one of his own tunes, perhaps
called "A Little Unkind," com
posed of truly uninspired

couplets, including, I kid you
not, "If love were a car/ I'd get in
and drive it/ If love were a drug/
I'd be tempted to try it." Hey, did
he say "Tempted"?
Before the audience could seri
ously begin to wonder what, in
deed, their $12.50 admission was
bringing down upon their heads,
the band started into
"Tempted." Difford and
Tilbrook of Squeeze were vir
tually giving a cash award to Car
rack when they let him sing that
song. It's a Platonic form of a
pop song —catchy, melodic, and
not very deep — and it was what
the crowd came to hear.
Hear they did. Looking over
the mob on the dance floor one
could see the mass of people
rhythmically shifting from foot

to foot, listening, but not danc
ing. Later, the crowd was advised
that "Dancing is not against the
rules." Yes, but is it against bet
ter judgement?
After "Wishing You Were
There" Carrack turned to in
troduce Lowe, his "good friend."
As the saying goes, with friends
like that. ..
Nick, who had been tossing off
winks, waves, and kisses like he
was running for lead singer, re
sponded to the ovation that had
greeted his introduction by tear
ing off "My Heart Hurts" and
"Mary Provost." The latter was
an oldie, written in the days.
before he realized that hit singles
make huge piles of money, and
dealt with a silent film star who
dies and gets eaten by her dog. By
way of introduction, Nick called
out "It's fun time in Palo Alto!"
After Nick — and the audience
— had some fun, the spotlight
went back to Paul, to do "Don't
Give my Heart a Break" and
"From Now On," which he in
troduced as the "very pretty song
that everybody wants to hear."
This, in the real world, is known
as presumption.
Back to Lowe. The crowd goes
wild over a too fast version of
"Burning," and foams at their
collective mouths over the hit
single "Cruel to be Kind." Then,
in violent disregard to the 'Two
for Paul, two for Nick' pattern
that had been carrying the con
cert, Nick hit his high point in the
show with "Switchbox Susan," a
full-throated vocal carrying the
song far beyond itself.
Paul, now, realizes that he's
going to need a big hit here to

keep the audience from rushing
the stage to gag him, and reaches
deep into his repitoire to pull out
not only one, but two big hits!
The song was "I Need You," and
the two hits were "My Girl" and,
amazingly, "Tempted," which
were shamelessly stolen from to
make "I Need You."
After Carrack did "I Found
Love" to round out his two song
set, Lowe came back with "(I
Love the Sound of) Breaking
Glass" which got such a great re
ception that I can only attribute it
to relief on the part of the au
dience, and "Cracking Up."
Here another interesting game
was included in the evening's
program reached peak. Called
"Watch the guitarist sweat," the
game involved looking at the
horrible monster with no neck
and guessing what had caused the
incredible variety of odd-shaped
sweat marks.
Shockingly, right after these
songs the guitarist was revealed
to be Martin Belmont, late of the
Rumour, who I had last seen on
"Fridays" immaculately dressed
in a tuxedo. That evening all I
could think was "He sure can
play that there guitar well, but
couldn't they have got someone
who looks a little less
grotesque?"
The concert ended with Car
rack slipping in "How Long"
and Lowe closing with "Stick it
Where the Sun Don't Shine,"
both of which were well done,
and coming back for an encore to
do — Paul and then Nick, of
course — "So Right, So Wrong"
and"I Knew the Bride."
Unexpectedly, the audience
called for a second encore, and
the band came back to do one
more song, sung by Lowe. Called
"What's so Funny About Peace,
Love and Understanding?" and
orginally made famous by Elvis
Costello, the song drove the
crowd to exhaustion and let the
band make it's getaway on a high
note.
The final score of the concert:
Paul Carrack, 10 songs, Nick
Lowe, 11 songs, audience, 13
good moments, and Keystone
Palo Alto $3000 in admissions. A
good showing all around, but I
really wish they could at least
have gotten a guitarist who had a
neck!
