# Local analysts predict Republican losses

The political question of the hour is whether the
upcoming election will be a referendum on Rea
ganomics. But the University's political pundits can
not agree to what extent economic conditions will af
fect the electoral outcome.
Prof. Seymour Martin Lipset, senior fellow at the
Hoover Institution, says that when the economy is
bad, voters turn incumbents out of office. He says,
for instance, that American voters selected a "con
servative" Republican administration in the 1980
election due to a "misery index" — inflation plus un
employment — which had risen under the Demo
crats.
Likewise, Lipset says, French voters turned to
Francois Mitterrand and the socialists in 1981 be
cause the economy was flagging under the conserva
tives.
Lipset predicts the Democrats will gain 25-30
seats in the House of Representatives this fall. They
will gain in the Senate too, he says, but the Re
publicans will maintain control in that chamber.
Political Science Profs. Richard Brody and John
Chubb foresee more moderate Democratic gains
and they cite several factors which might mitigate a
potentially strong tide against the Republicans.
Both mention substantial Republican campaign
funding and the relatively small drop (10 percentage
points) in Reagan's job approval rating since he took
office; Chubb, in addition, says the Republicans at
tracted "good" candidates last fall when Reagan's
standing in the polls was higher.
Brody predicts an 18-seat Democratic gain in the
House and a one-seat gain in the Senate. Chubb pre

dicts a 20-seat gain in the House. As for the Senate,
Chubb says, the Republicans are "fortunate" be
cause they comprise less than a majority of the mem
bers running for re-election. (Of 33 incumbent Sen
ate candidates this year, 13 are Republican and 19
are Democratic. There is one independent.)
Traditionally, the party in power loses seats in the
midterm election. But the GOP nationwide has an
"overwhelming amount" of money it can funnel into
local races to help its incumbents, Brody says.
Chubb speaks of the considerable Republican "war
chest," saying that it is six times the size of Demo
cratic coffers.
With respect to the California statewide races,
Brody says he regards the much-discussed "referen
dum on Reaganomics" as less important than other
factors. Gov. Brown's performance, he says, weighs
more heavily on the U.S. Senate race. The
gubernatorial race between Los Angeles Mayor
Tom Bradley and state Attorney General George
Deukmejian, however, lacks a "key issue," accord
ing to Brody. That race, he says, splits approximate
ly along party lines. Mervin Field's California Poll,
released last night, shows San Diego Mayor Pete
Wilson with a six-point lead over Brown. The poll
also shows Bradley has an equivalent lead over Deu
kmejian.
Brody says that the president's own standing in
the polls will be a factor in the election. Because Rea
gan's job-approval ranking has dropped moderately
by recent historical standards, the GOP will not fare
as badly as if he had experienced a more severe de
cline.
In the congressional race in the 11th district, Re

publican challenger Bill Royer's campaign concedes
that incumbent Democrat Tom Lantos leads, but
puts the margin at less than 5 points. Lantos cam
paign director Katrina Lantos-Swett says the Lantos
lead is "in the vicinity" of 20 points as the election
nears.
Both sides say that the economy is the pressing is
sue, but in discussions with the campaign directors,
spending and tactics emerged as significant.
Royer campaign manager Bob Martini said in a
telephone interview the Lantos lead is to be expected
because "he'll outspend us by $500,000 or
$600,000." Martini pegged the Lantos spending to
tal at $1.1 million — a figure that Lantos-Swett says
is "in the ballpark." Moreover, Martini said, "90
percent" of Lantos' campaign funding comes from
out of state. Lantos-Swett counters that Martini is
"just wrong," adding that 75-80 percent of the cam
paign monies come from within California.
Lantos-Swett also rejects Martini's contention
that Lantos will be "beholden" to pro-Israel in
terests if re-elected. She says that Lantos wrote a let
ter to Prime Minister Menachem Begin "condemn
ing his refusal" to permit initially an independent in
quiry into the massacre of Palestinians in Beirut.
Royer's campaign has been "one of distortion and
outright lies," Lantos-Swett said. Martini said, on
the other hand, that Lantos has tried to suggest that
Royer is pro-nuclear when, in fact, Royer supports
the proposed nuclear freeze.
The election will be "very close," Martini says,
but Lantos-Swett says the polling data are "very en
couraging" for the incumbent.
