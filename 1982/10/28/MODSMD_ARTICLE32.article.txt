Meeting to interview Zschau at 4:00
in Tresidder 133. Be different! Be there.
Ink Bowl revisited
The new PJFs have had it easy so
far, but the geriatrics haven't tangled
with the fearsome Daily Softball lineup.
In last year's game, the Daily was so far
ahead that victory seemed inevitable,
but somehow, as if an occult hand hadg
interfered, the aged scribes staged a lasl
minute rally to claim the win. This yeail
will be different: Softball duel this Sun
day at 11:00 on Roble Field. Come beat
the old farts and . . . Vive Pencre!
