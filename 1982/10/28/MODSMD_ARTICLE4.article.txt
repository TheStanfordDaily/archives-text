# Proposition 13 — water as a political problem
## Features 
### VICKI MOORE 
California's water problem boils
down to the fact that about 80 percent
of the water falls in the winter and
spring, while 80 percent of demand oc
curs in the summer; two-thirds of it falls
in Northern California, while two
thirds of the population is in the south
ern half.
An extensive network of dams, reser
voirs and aquaducts which collect and
channel the flow of water compensate
for these limitations of nature. Until the
defeat of Proposition 9, the Peripheral
Canal referendum on last June's ballot,
the state of California has generally
dealt with water shortage problems by
building more dams, aquaducts and
reservoirs. However, in recent years, an
increased concern with the conserva
tion of a limited water supply and a
greater competition for water resources
by environmenalists and fishermen who
claim a right to enjoy unspoiled rivers,
has been a major impetus for Proposi
tion 13. the Water Resources Conserva
tion and Efficiency Act, put on the
ballot by the California Water Protec
tion Council (CWPC).

"Water use in California is an in
credibly political problem, involving a
complex economic, political and social
web of controversy," said Civil Engi
neering Professor David Freyberg,
"and the California legislature has been
singularly irresponsive in dealing with
the issue." Now, in what will be a test of
strength between the conservation fac
tion and the agribusiness bloc, Califor
nia voters will be voting directly to de
cide the fate of their water policy in the
form of Prop. 13.
The major provisions of Prop 13 are
divided into conservation measures,
groundwater management, water rights
and the New Melones reservoir.
Proposition 13 requires that every
major water supplier submit to the
State Water Resources Control Board,
which consists of a committee of five
appointed by the governor, a water con
servation program. Large water users
must develop and implement cost-effec
tive water conservation programs
before they import new sources of wa
ter. The conservation provision also
states that those receiving water from a
water project must pay their full
proportionate share of the costs
of developing and delivering that
water and that the use of proper
ty taxes to pay for these costs
should be minimized.
Agricultural users, which ac
count for 85 percent of Califor
nia's water consumption, have
historically enjoyed heavy sub
sidies from state and, to an even
greater extent, from federal water
projects. A recent General Ac
counting Office report on six fed
eral irrigation projects found that
the federal government's cost to
provide the water ranged from
$54 to $130 per acre-foot (an
acre-foot equals about 326,000
gallons), while the users paid
from 27 cents to $9.82.
According to Leo McElroy,
spokesman for the CWPC, the
Metropolitan Water District
(MWD) of Southern California
sells its surplus water from the
State Water Project to farmers at
the surplus delivery price which is
much less than the normal de
livery price. Large farmers in
Southern California pay about
$3.50 per acre-foot, while the av
erage family of four who uses one
acre-foot of water per year, pays
$100 to $200, claimed McElroy.
"With these prices, it costs
(farmers) more to conserve than
to save water. This discourages
conservation and encourages the
development of water projects
that are not truly cost-effective,"
said McElroy.

Now, in what will be a
test of strength
between the
conservation faction
and the agribusiness
bloc t California
voters will be voting
directly to decide the
fate of their water
policy in the form of
Proposition 13.

r • However, Les Reed, spokes
man for the California Water Re
* sources Association (CWRA),
representing mainly water agen
cies, business firms,\and cham
bers of commerce, claimed that
i most conservation measures are
\ already being implemented on a
* local basis. "The additional con
» servation measures required by
\ *; Proposition 13 wouldn't have a
\ significant impact," he added,
t "since the majority of water is
; lost through evapo-transpira
; tion, mostly through plant
; leaves, and ocean runoff."

"The San Joaquin Valley is a
closed basin, so that much of the
water used for irrigation is re
covered, because it drains down
into the water table below and is
recycled within the valley," said
Jack King of the California Farm
Bureau hederation, representing
97,000 farmers. Both Reed and
King advocate a need for storing
more water south of the Delta.
Groundwater management
Proposition 13 attempts to
solve the problem of
groundwater overdraft (pumping
water out of underground

advocates standing to

and planning process

aquifers faster than it can be re
plenished), by requiring that the
11 designated critical overdraft
areas in the state create a
groundwater management au
thority within one year and a
plan to mitigate the overdraft
within two years. This provision
also states that local
groundwater resources must be
managed to avoid water over
draft and water quality degreda
tion. The enforcement clause of
this provision prohibits new
transfers of water into an over
draft basin and does not allow
new acreage to be brought under
irrigation until the groundwater
management plan has been ap
proved by the WRCB.
According to Freyberg, Cali
fornia's aquifers are being
depleted at the rate of two million
acre-feet a year, mostly as the re
sult of overpumping by San Joa
quin Valley farmers. In addition,
groundwater pumping is un
regulated in California, except in
the Santa Clara, San Fernando,
Sierra and parts of Orange Coun
ty.
In some areas in the San Joa
quin Valley, the ground has sunk
as much as 29 feet, said McElroy.
A vacuum created by an over
pumped water table causes the
ground to collapse, irreversibly
destroying the underground
aquifer. The San Joaquin Valley
is a "debtors paradise," declared
McElroy, "where farmers are
borrowing against the future by
sucking up the water."
Water rights
Under current California law,
a water right can be established
only by diverting water. Thus,
people who want the water to

stay in the stream, such as fish
ermen or white water rafters,
have no legal claim to it. How
ever, the water rights provision
declares that water may be "ap
propriated for reasonable and
beneficial" uses including fish
ery, wildlife, recreational,
aesthetic, scientific, scenic and
water quality uses just as it is ap
propriated for irrigation and
flood control.
Although residential and agri
cultural uses will still have water
rights priority, "Proposition 13
gives environmental and recrea
tional advocates standing to be a
part of the policy and planning
process so that their voice won't
have to be heard in a costly court
battle," McElroy said.
On the other hand, "Anyone
could sue to enforce provisions of
this act, which would open the
door to endless and often frivo
lous litigation," said Dennis
Mac Lain, president of the
CWRA. "Proposition 13 would
. . . create potentially insur
mountable legal obstacles to the
authorization and construction
of many water projects needed to
fulfill this state's current and
future water needs," Mac Lain
said.
Another dimension of the wa
ter rights provision concerns the
water quality of the San Francis
co Bay region. According to
Freyberg, water withdrawals
from the tributaries of the Sacra
mento-San Joaquin Delta have
significantly decreased the flow
through the Delta, causing salt
water from the San Francisco
Bay to periodically back-up into
the Delta channels, with
detrimental consequences for
many wildlife species.

'Water use in
California is an
incredibly political
problem, involving a
complex economic,
political and social
web of controversy,
and the California
legislature has been
singularly
irresponsive in dealing
with the issue.'

Frank Broadhead of the San
Francisco Conservation and De
velopment Commission stated
that political pressure will cause a
lessening in water quality stan
dards for the Bay unless Proposi
tion 13 is passed, as more and
more freshwater will be diverted
from the Bay.

New Melones
Proposition 13 states that the
federal government, as the opera
tor of the project, cannot im
pound water behind the New
Melones Dam on the Stanislaus
River, until long-term contracts
have been signed for 75 percent
of the yield, except as required
for satisfying vested water rights,
fish and wildlife protection, and
flood prevention.
"This measure is controversial
because it has the state trying to
restrict how the federal govern
ment handles its water project,"
said Freyberg.
In addition, Freyberg pre
dicted that relatively few farmers
would enter into a contract for
the water which would cost about
$70 per acre-foot because of the
full proportionate share payment
clause of Proposition 13. Few
contracts translates into an un
filled reservoir.
Anti-Proposition 13 groups
oppose this measure and point to
the defeat of the 1974 referendum
to protect the Stanislaus as proof
that the majority of Californians
want the $360 million dam put to
full use.
The New Melones Reservoir
was filled earlier this year to pre
vent flooding from last winter's
heavy rains and snows. Critics of
Proposition 13 also say that it
will give too much power to the
Water Resources Control Board,
allowing it to be a "water czar
who is not directly elected by or
answerable to the people," said
Reed, and "centralize control
over very diverse water supply re
sponsibilities." Indeed, Proposi
tion 13 would allow the Board to
withhold water deliveries and
take other actions if local agen
cies failed to comply with re
quirement for "satisfactory"
management programs.
An October California Field
Poll showed that of the 48 per
cent of people familiar with
Proposition 13, 33 percent would
vote yes, while only six percent
would vote no.
The CWPC budget for Propo
sition 13 is $500,000, but the
council is about $250,000 in debt
and, according to McElroy, will
not be able to buy any ads. The
anti-Proposition 13 forces have
budgeted about %2 million for
their campaign.
Freyberg said that the lack of
money for advertising and
educating the public could have
an adverse impact on the cam
paign since over half of Californi
ans do not know about Prop 13,
and would probably be more
prone to take the advice they see
on the anti-Proposition 13
billboards or commercials.
