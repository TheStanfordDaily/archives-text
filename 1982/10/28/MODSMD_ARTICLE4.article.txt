# Proposition 13 â€” water as a political problem
## Features 
### VICKI MOORE 
California's water problem boils
down to the fact that about 80 percent
of the water falls in the winter and
spring, while 80 percent of demand oc
curs in the summer; two-thirds of it falls
in Northern California, while two
thirds of the population is in the south
ern half.
An extensive network of dams, reser
voirs and aquaducts which collect and
channel the flow of water compensate
for these limitations of nature. Until the
defeat of Proposition 9, the Peripheral
Canal referendum on last June's ballot,
the state of California has generally
dealt with water shortage problems by
building more dams, aquaducts and
reservoirs. However, in recent years, an
increased concern with the conserva
tion of a limited water supply and a
greater competition for water resources
by environmenalists and fishermen who
claim a right to enjoy unspoiled rivers,
has been a major impetus for Proposi
tion 13. the Water Resources Conserva
tion and Efficiency Act, put on the
ballot by the California Water Protec
tion Council (CWPC).

"Water use in California is an in
credibly political problem, involving a
complex economic, political and social
web of controversy," said Civil Engi
neering Professor David Freyberg,
"and the California legislature has been
singularly irresponsive in dealing with
the issue." Now, in what will be a test of
strength between the conservation fac
tion and the agribusiness bloc, Califor
nia voters will be voting directly to de
cide the fate of their water policy in the
form of Prop. 13.
The major provisions of Prop 13 are
divided into conservation measures,
groundwater management, water rights
and the New Melones reservoir.
Proposition 13 requires that every
major water supplier submit to the
State Water Resources Control Board,
which consists of a committee of five
appointed by the governor, a water con
servation program. Large water users
must develop and implement cost-effec
tive water conservation programs
before they import new sources of wa
ter. The conservation provision also
states that those receiving water from a
