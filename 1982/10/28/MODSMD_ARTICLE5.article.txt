Lebanon stalls talks with Israel
Beirut — Authorative Lebanese government sources said yesterday that
the U.S. State Department was premature in reporting this week that Leba
non had agreed to enter direct diplomatic talks with Israel on withdrawal of
foreign forces from this country.
The sources declined to say whether Lebanon was seeking some con
cession from Israel in return for starting such negotiations, but the com
ments suggested that negotiations were not going as smoothly as the United
States might like. Diplomats speculated that the Lebanese government
might be waiting to announce the talks with Israel until it has been able to
gauge whether strong opposition is likely to materialize among the Moslem
population at home or elsewhere in the Arab world.
Prime Minister Shafiq Wazzan, a Moslem, has stressed that Lebanon still
was using Washington as an intermediary in talks with Israel on a troop
withdrawal, even though Israel would like direct talks as a prelude to estab
lishing normal diplomatic relations with the country.
"The contacts going on ... are not conducted by Lebanese authorities
directly," Wazzan told reporters Tuesday night after a Cabinet meeting.
Syria currently has more than 30,000 troops in Lebanon and Israel ap
proximately twice that figure while there are estimated to be 10,000 Palesti
nian guerrillas.
U.S. envoy Morris Draper, who will conduct talks aimed at a troop
pullout agreement, arrived here yesterday. He faces a key problem. Israel
says it will pull out simultaneously with Syria after all the Palestinian guer
rillas have departed first, whereas Syria says it will not leave until all the Is
raelis are out.
Brezhnev plans to offset U.S. "adventurism"
Moscow — President Leonid Brezhnev, in an unusual meeting of senior
military and Kremlin officials today, urged a military buildup and better ties
with China to counter what he called U.S. adventurism.
Brezhnev said that "Washington's aggressive policy ... is
threatening to push the world into the flames of nuclear war." He
called the U.S. policy one of "adventurism, rudeness and un
disguised egotism."
Stigler and Salazar embarrass Reagan
Washington — It was supposed to be a pleasant, telegenic day
featuring winners at the White House yesterday. First the presi
dent would have his picture taken in the Rose Garden with the
winners of the New York marathon, then in the Oval Office with
the winner of the Nobel prize in economics, George Stigler.
But the winners deviated from the scripts.
Free-market economist Stigler is a University of Chicago pro
fessor known for his advocacy of government deregulation. That
sounded safe enough. But six days before the midterm elections
in which the stagnating economy threatens to produce big Re
publican losses, Stigler stunned White House aides by declaring
from a White House podium after his session with Reagan that
the nation is in a "depression."
He also said before the television cameras that supply-side ec
onomics was a "gimmick" and a "slogan that was used to pack
age certain ideas."
The day's other non-event went wrong, too.
In a sun-splashed Rose Garden ceremony, the president hon
ored winners of the New York Marathon.
"We shall go back inside now," Reagan said at the end of the
ceremony, trying to avoid questions from reporters. But Salazar
piped up that he wanted to present Reagan with a pair of Nike
running shoes.
He didn't stop there. "I hope these will help him in his race for
re-election," Salazar said of Reagan, who has not yet declared
for 1984. "I am sure that he will be re-elected president."
Census reports over 1 billion Chinese
Peking — Surpasssing the 1 billion mark for the first time, Chi
na's population swelled almost by half in the last 18 years while
becoming only slightly more educated and urbanized, according
to census figures released yesterday.
Officials pinpointed 1,008,175,288 people on the Chinese
mainland, which is about one-quarter of mankind. Counting the
breakaway island of Taiwan and the European colonies of Hong
Kong and Macao-which Peking claims to be part of China-the
figure surges to 1,031,882,511.
One of every four Chinese is illiterate — a staggering total of
235.8 million — and 80 percent of the population still lives in the
vast countryside, according to statistics.
This census was supervised by United Nations experts and in
cludes a figure for China's uniformed men — 4.23 million.
Rights group chronicles violations
London — In a grim catalog of human suffering, Amnesty In
ternational today reported the execution of children by Iranian
firing squads and the murder of "thousands" of civilians by gov
ernment-sanctioned groups, especially in Latin America.
The human rights group's annual report, covering 1981,
deplored the use of the judicial capital punishment — including
the death sentences hanging over 924 U.S. prisoners.
Amnesty International's report focused on dissidents and
threatened minorities in nations that it said resort to political
killings to put down opposition.
It attacked "continuing repression against all forms of dis
sent" in the Soviet Union, where 200 people were reported ar
rested during 1981 for expressing political or religious views.
Amnesty International, a Nobel Peace Prize-winning group
based in London, campaigns for the release of political pris
oners.
The 367-page review of 121 countries reported "thousands" of
people killed last year by security forces or government-sanc
tioned death squads.
"Specific, consistent reports of torture were received from

Guatemala, El Salvador, Chile. Uruguay, Haiti and Colombia,
among others," the group said.
Amnesty also criticized the United States and Mexico for al
legedly pressing Salvadoran, Guatemalan and Haitian refugees
to return home despite danger to their lives.
Reagan to avoid California campaigning
Washington — President Reagan will campaign all over the
West for Republican candidates today and tomorrow, but stop
short of the California border becausc strategists fear he could
do more harm than good for GOP Senate candidate Pete Wilson.
This represents one of the most striking ironies in California
political history. Reagan, a two-term governor, is perhaps the
most successful politician ever to run for office in California. He
has never even come close to losing an election in his home state.
Right now, Wilson, mayor of San Diego, and Republican
gubernatorial candidate George Deukmejian are presumed to be
in tight races and could use any help available.
Reagan is available, but the consensus of Republican
strategists — in California and at the White House — is that he
would be more of a hindrance than a help — particularly to
Wilson.
While the president is still popular in California, his policies
are much less so. Undecided voters in particular have serious
questions about the president's economic program.
Wilson's strategy has been to keep the voters' attention
focused on the weaknesses of Gov. Brown, the Democratic can
didate. A campaign visit by Reagan, the Wilson camp believes,
would divert attention to "Reaganomics."
Carter blasts party organization
Washington — Former President Jimmy Carter, who used a
Democratic Party post to launch his first presidential bid, de
livered a stinging attack on the Democratic National Committee
yesterday, declaring that it is often more of a burden than an as
set to its nominees.
Although a president has "a great responsibility" to his party,
Carter said, "I have to say in complete candor, however, that the
way the Democratic National Committee has been structured in
recent years, it has been of very little help, either to an incumbent
president or to the nominee of our party."
Carter's remarks, made in a taped interview that was aired yes
terday on NBC's "Today" show, touched off a furor among
Democratic Party officials.
Democratic Chairman Charles Manatt called Carter's com
ments a "shame" and a former party leader, who declined to be
quoted by name, exclaimed: "Isn't that the dumbest thing you
ever heard in your life?"
£1 A 1 mob shuts down airport
Tel Aviv, Israel — Hundreds of angry El A 1 Airline employees
closed Israel's only international airport yesterday by blocking
runways with sabotaged aircraft, their bodies and their chil
dren's bodies in a protest aimed at forcing the government to
change its plan to close the national air carrier.
Late in the day, after the worst of the rioting was over, the gov
ernment and the Histadrut labor federation announced that they
would open negotiations Sunday aimed at drafting a labor peace
pact that management says must be signed before it will consider
reopening the airline.
Three workers were arrested, and 12 persons, El A 1 employees
and police, were injured in the melee.
The riot began early yesterday when employees, who had
spent the night at the airport after less violent protests Tuesday,
moved to close down operations, first by burning tires and later
by lying on runways with their children. Three El A 1 Airliners —
a 747 cargo jet and 747 and 707 passenger liners — were towed
onto the runways and disabled by deflating tires, lowering the
inflatable emergency slides and draining hydraulic fluid.

Irish bomb kills three
Belfast, Northern Ireland — A bomb exploded under a police
vehicle in a rural area of Northern Ireland yesterday, killing
three officers instantly as they patrolled along a quiet road near
Lurgan, in County Armagh, police said.
Their deaths raised to 12 the number of people slain in
Northern Ireland's sectarian war in the past month.
The bomb was hidden in a road drain at a traffic circle, a type
of ambush often used by guerrillas of the Irish Republican Army
fighting to end British rule in the province, the police said.
But "no one has yet admitted responsibility for the ex
plosion," said a police spokesman.
Greece-U.S. talk over bases
Athens, Greece — Greece and the United States opened talks
here yesterday on the future status and operation on American
military bases on Greek territory, the Greek news agency ANA
reported.
The talks, to be held in two phases, are expected to last six to
nine months, according to a Greek government spokesman.
Socialist Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou said last week
that if no agreement were reached within that time "the bases will
have to go." But he said he hoped the outcome would be positive.
The four bases are the naval facility of Suda Bay in Crete; an
Air Force communications center at Heraklion, Crete; an Air
Force installation near Athens International Airport, and a
Navy communications center at Nea Marki, near Marathon.
The talks opened at the Greek Foreign Ministry, with Deputy
Foreign Minister Yannis Kapsis negotiating for the Greek gov
ernment and Reginald Bartholomew, a senior Foreign Service
officer, heading the U.S. team.
The agreement being sought in the negotiations is to replace
108 individual arrangements going back to 1953 and now re
garded by the year-old Socialist government in Athens as tanta
mount to colonialist.
Observers say that Athens clearly will aim at ensuring its own
defense interests are not impinged upon, for example, by the
United States passing information to Turkey.
Athens also will be concerned not to allow its relations with
other nations, notably Arab countries, to be adversely affected
by allowing the Americans to stay.
Texas may wipe out VD in books
Austin, Texas — School administrators in Texas are consider
ing ordering all references to venereal disease deleted from new
textbooks, fearing the issue may be too delicate for some local
districts.
"The bottom line issue is, when you're talking about sexually
transmitted diseases, you're relating it to 'How do you get it?"
Tom Anderson, the deputy commissioner of the Texas Educa
tion Agcncy, said Wednesday.
Education Commissioner Raymon Bynum last week sent let
ters to publishers of five series of health textbooks that were up
for adoption, advising them to "delete all reference to venereal
diseases and sexually transmitted diseases."
Stocks steady in subdued session
Stock prices were mostly higher Wednesday in a relatively sub
dued session after the wide swings of the past few days.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose .28 to 1006.35,
after falling 36.33 Monday and recovering 10.94 Tuesday.
Chrysler led the active list, up 1 at lO'/i. The threat of a strike
against the company next Monday was averted when its workers
voted to stay on the job under their old contract.
Today's weather
Mostly fair today with lows in the mid 40s and highs in the 60s.
Winds are from the west at 10-20 mph.
