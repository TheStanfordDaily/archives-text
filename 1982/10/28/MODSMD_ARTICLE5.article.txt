Lebanon stalls talks with Israel
Beirut — Authorative Lebanese government sources said yesterday that
the U.S. State Department was premature in reporting this week that Leba
non had agreed to enter direct diplomatic talks with Israel on withdrawal of
foreign forces from this country.
The sources declined to say whether Lebanon was seeking some con
cession from Israel in return for starting such negotiations, but the com
ments suggested that negotiations were not going as smoothly as the United
States might like. Diplomats speculated that the Lebanese government
might be waiting to announce the talks with Israel until it has been able to
gauge whether strong opposition is likely to materialize among the Moslem
population at home or elsewhere in the Arab world.
Prime Minister Shafiq Wazzan, a Moslem, has stressed that Lebanon still
was using Washington as an intermediary in talks with Israel on a troop
withdrawal, even though Israel would like direct talks as a prelude to estab
lishing normal diplomatic relations with the country.
"The contacts going on ... are not conducted by Lebanese authorities
directly," Wazzan told reporters Tuesday night after a Cabinet meeting.
Syria currently has more than 30,000 troops in Lebanon and Israel ap
proximately twice that figure while there are estimated to be 10,000 Palesti
nian guerrillas.
U.S. envoy Morris Draper, who will conduct talks aimed at a troop
pullout agreement, arrived here yesterday. He faces a key problem. Israel
says it will pull out simultaneously with Syria after all the Palestinian guer
rillas have departed first, whereas Syria says it will not leave until all the Is
raelis are out.
Brezhnev plans to offset U.S. "adventurism"
Moscow — President Leonid Brezhnev, in an unusual meeting of senior
military and Kremlin officials today, urged a military buildup and better ties
with China to counter what he called U.S. adventurism.
