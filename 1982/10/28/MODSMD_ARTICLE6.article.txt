# Cal Grant aid falls short

Stanford undergraduates from
California will lose more than
$60,000 in financial aid from the
state this year as the result of recent
budget reductions, according to
Vincent DeAnda, associate director
of financial aid.
DeAnda said the University will
make up the losses. "The money will
probably come from a general schol
arship fund used by the University
to aid us in cases such as this. It just
means that we will have to ask for
that much more from the University
budget committee. Financial aid is a
high priority at Stanford," he said.
Forced to cut its 1982-83 budget
by 5 percent, the California Student
Aid Commission (CSAC) has re
duced its $85 million Cal Grant pro
gram that helps 32,462 Californians
who attend colleges and universities
within the state.
"Costs at both independent and
public California colleges and uni
versities have climbed beyond the
reach of the state student aid pro
gram," said Arthur Marmaduke,
the commission's director.
This fall, for the first time in 26
years, the CSAC will be unable to
pay full fees for the most needy Cal

Grant recipients at either the Uni
versity of California or the Califor
nia State University. The maximum
Cal Grant of $844 will not cover the
average yearly UC fee of $1230. Last
year both fees and the state grant av
eraged $800.
The average CSU fee this year is
$430 while the maximum Cal Grant
for a CSU school is $247. Last year
both fees and grants averaged $250.
For students attending private
universities such as Stanford, the
maximum Cal Grant will be reduced
from $3400 to $3330, a loss of $70
per student per year. More than 850
undergraduate students in the Uni
versity now receiving Cal Grant fi
nancial aid, which translates into a
yearly loss of more than $60,000.
"I think the cuts are very signifi
cant in terms of students attending
private universities receiving Cal
Grants," Marmaduke said. Five
years ago the number of new Cal
Grant A winners attending private
universities was 6561 students, he
said. Today that has decreased by 30
percent to 4592.
"Another worry is that federal aid
probably will not help make up the
difference," continued Marmaduke.
