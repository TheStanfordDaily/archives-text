# Cal Grant aid falls short

Stanford undergraduates from
California will lose more than
$60,000 in financial aid from the
state this year as the result of recent
budget reductions, according to
Vincent DeAnda, associate director
of financial aid.
DeAnda said the University will
make up the losses. "The money will
probably come from a general schol
arship fund used by the University
to aid us in cases such as this. It just
means that we will have to ask for
that much more from the University
budget committee. Financial aid is a
high priority at Stanford," he said.
Forced to cut its 1982-83 budget
by 5 percent, the California Student
Aid Commission (CSAC) has re
duced its $85 million Cal Grant pro
gram that helps 32,462 Californians
who attend colleges and universities
within the state.
"Costs at both independent and
public California colleges and uni
versities have climbed beyond the
reach of the state student aid pro
gram," said Arthur Marmaduke,
the commission's director.
This fall, for the first time in 26
years, the CSAC will be unable to
pay full fees for the most needy Cal

Grant recipients at either the Uni
versity of California or the Califor
nia State University. The maximum
Cal Grant of $844 will not cover the
average yearly UC fee of $1230. Last
year both fees and the state grant av
eraged $800.
The average CSU fee this year is
$430 while the maximum Cal Grant
for a CSU school is $247. Last year
both fees and grants averaged $250.
For students attending private
universities such as Stanford, the
maximum Cal Grant will be reduced
from $3400 to $3330, a loss of $70
per student per year. More than 850
undergraduate students in the Uni
versity now receiving Cal Grant fi
nancial aid, which translates into a
yearly loss of more than $60,000.
"I think the cuts are very signifi
cant in terms of students attending
private universities receiving Cal
Grants," Marmaduke said. Five
years ago the number of new Cal
Grant A winners attending private
universities was 6561 students, he
said. Today that has decreased by 30
percent to 4592.
"Another worry is that federal aid
probably will not help make up the
difference," continued Marmaduke.
Several outside factors helped con
tribute to the commission's inability to
cover rising tuition costs. Marmaduke
said one of the most significant reasons
is that "the Financial Aid Com
mission's income ceiling has not been
able to keep up with inflation. Another
is that the maximum Cal Grant itself
has not kept up with inflation either,"
he said.
"What this means is that it is increas
ingly more difficult for low or middle
income students to go to a private col
lege, thus forcing many to choose a
state supported school with a lower tui
tion," Marmaduke said.
Although many private California
university and college students will be
hurt by the cuts in aid, students here ap
pear to be affected less than the others.
Over 60 percent of all under
graduates here are on some kind of fi
nancial aid package. The majority of
this aid comes directly from the Univer
sity. The Cal Grant program con
tributes 9 percent of all the financial aid
students receive.
"Most importantly, we remain com
mitted to a policy of 'aid-blind ad
mission' for all students, meaning that
financial need is not a factor in ad
mission," continued DeAnda. "We feel
this is very important."
Both Marmaduke and DeAnda re
main cautious about the future of the
Cal Grant program. "We hope to see an
upward trend in the amount of money
appropriated by the state for the Stu
dent Aid Commission," DeAnda said.
"We're suffering if it does not go up.
Tuition rose 12 percent last year."
Marmaduke agreed: "It is tough
keeping up with the increases of tuition
for both state and private schools, and
keeping within our budget as cuts are
made by the state. We are very ap
prehensive about the future."
