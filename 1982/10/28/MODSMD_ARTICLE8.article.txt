## Congressional campaign strategy: shifting the blame Election road muddy 
### 
Compiled from news reports and wire services
Everyone seems to agree that Republicans stand to lose
some seats in the upcoming congressional election, but
the question is just how much they will lose. The Demo
crats could do a lot of damage to Reagan's power base if
they can rally enough voters against the Reagan adminis
tration's policies.
Former President Gerald Ford said this week that he
expects Republicans to lose only about IS seats in the
House and hold their own in the Senate. This is con
sidered to be optimistic even by Republican estimates.
The problem for the GOP is that the presidential party
tends to lose an average of 15 seats in an "off-year elec
tion."
Until last week, Republicans were claiming that their
losses would not be too severe. But recent polls show the
president's popularity slipping and a larger number of
people leaning toward the Democrats.
The Washington Post-ABC poll released on Tuesday
shows voters about evenly split between blaming Reagan
and Carter for the state of the economy, with 34 percent
blaming Reagan and the Republicans and 36 percent
blaming Carter and the Democrats.
But the poll also showed that those blaming Carter
were lining up behind Reagan 3-1, while those blaming
Reagan were lining up behind the Democrats by a 10-1
margin.
The poll indicated 30 percent blame the two parties
equally, with these voters splitting 2-1 for the Democrats.
Reagan's strategy of blaming the Democrats for the
poor state of the economy is having only limited success.
In September the Gallup poll showed voters favoring
Democrats over Republicans by a margin of 56-44 per
cent. The figure has been hovering at around 60-40 per
cent since then.
In the House, where they hold a 243-192 majority,
Democrats hope to capture 35-40 seats. The Senate race
is more crucial; the Republicans gained a majority there
for the first time in 26 years in 1980, attaining 54 seats to
the Democrats' 45.
The Democrats thus need a net gain of five seats in the
Senate to regain their majority. Officially party leaders
like Democratic National Chairman Charles Mannatt
are calling such an outcome a "remote" possibility, but
pollsters say that the Democrats surged ahead last week.
All of these imponderables partly depend on who

shows up at the polls next week. If the Democrats can lure
enough of the independent voters, things could go heavily
their way.
The Republicans do have certain advantages going
into the last week. The president is coming down hard on
the Democrats, although some feel that his involvement
in the campaign may hurt the Republicans' image.
The other major advantage the Republicans have is
money. With approximately $100 million dollars to
spend versus the Democrats' $25 million, the Re
publicans are planning a media campaign in the last week
via television and direct-mail.
Democrats, on the other hand, are hoping that civil
rights groups and unions will be able to rally people to the
polls. Nuclear freeze initiatives may also aid the Demo
crats.
In part the election may be a test of Reagan's reputa
tion as the "Great Communicator." If Reagan can sue

ceed in convincing voters that Democrats are to blame
for their troubles. Republicans may be able to hold down
their losses.
With all of this speculation going on, analysts are
saying that a loss of more than 40 seats in the House will
be a major defeat for the Republicans. Such a defeat, it is
believed, would translate as a no-confidence vote on Rea
ganomics.
By focusing on alleged Democratic irresposibility in
his national campaign, many people believe Reagan
helped to turn the election into a referendum on his poli
cies. Those policies could undergo a major setback if the
Republicans get caught up in an anti-Reagan backlash.
With that kind of stakes, the election is sure to stay
pretty hot through the last week of the campaign.
