THE LITE BEER ALL-STARS
STRIKE AGAIN.
When famous bowler Don
Carter invited 23 Kingpins to
the First Lite Beer Bowling
Tournament, it seemed like a
great idea.
It was the guys who drink
Lite Beer from Miller —
because it tastes great,
against the guys who
drink it because it's less
filling. And once again, _
the All-Stars proved
they're in a league by
themselves.
After a lot of pins
(and quite a few Lite
Beers) went down and
the smoke finally
cleared, the score was L
tied, with only one man left to go.

Teammate Ben Davidson felt
Rodney deserved a break, or
at least a fracture. Billy Martin
didn't argue with that. Jim
Honochick"couldn't believe his
eyes. Neither could Marv
Throneberry.
So the First Lite Beer
Bowling Tournament
ended in a draw. And
the argument over the
best thing about Lite

thing everyone agreed
on. It was truly every
thing you always
