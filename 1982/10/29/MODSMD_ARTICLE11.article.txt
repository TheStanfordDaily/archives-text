## The 						Stanford Daily Tom Bradley for governor 
### 
The gubernatorial campaign has not received as
much media coverage as the U.S. Senate race has
because the personalities are not as interesting and
the campaign has not been as bitter. This lack of ex
posure, combined with both candidates' attempts
to capture the moderate voters, may be responsible
for promoting the idea that the candidates are es
sentially the same. We disagree.
Throughout the course of the campaign clear dif
ferences have emerged between the candidates
which we feel make Los Angeles Mayor Tom Brad
ley the more desirable choice for governor. Though
both Bradley and his opponent, California At
torney General George Deukmejian, have a solid
background in law enforcement, Deukmejian has
ihosen to use that background to support political
ly popular methods for crime prevention at the ex
pense of effective solutions. Instead of examining
the complicated reasons why crime is such a prob
lem in our state, Deukmejian has succumbed to the
Simplistic notion of blaming "lenient" courts and
folding Gov. Brown's court appointees singularly
Responsible for the state's high crime rate.
! In contrast, Bradley, a police officer for 21 years
before going into government, takes a much more
cautious approach. Bradley supports the California
justices appointed by Brown; he opposed the Vic
tim's Bill of Rights; and he supports the handgun
control initiative, Proposition 15, in the upcoming
election.
Although both candidates have vowed to de

crease regulations as a means of promoting busi
ness in California, we feel Deukmejian's proposal
to eliminate agencies that discourage business or to
replace their leaders with those dedicated to serving
business is a dangerous idea.
While both candidates have decried the state's re
duction in funding for education, Bradley has con
tinually stated that spending for education would
be his top budget concern. Disturbingly however,
both candidates have been vague on how to in
crease funding for education in California, which
has slipped from the fifth to the 50th state in the na
tion in percentage of income spent on education.
On environmental issues, Bradley's views in
dicate a desire to protect California's natural re
sources, something which takes on an even greater
significance because of the possible incursions
against those resources by Interior Secretary James
Watt. Deukmejian, on the other hand, favors dis
mantling the gains made in the last decade in en
vironmental preservation by disbanding the Cali
fornia Coastal Commission and decreasing the size
of the Redwood National Park.
We are disappointed that both candidates have
waffled on the most important issue facing the next
governor: the upcoming $600 million to $1 billion
state budget deficit. Still, we feel that Bradley's
stands and approach to education, the environ
ment, crime, energy and the economy make him the
superior candidate and for this reason we urge you
to vote for him.
