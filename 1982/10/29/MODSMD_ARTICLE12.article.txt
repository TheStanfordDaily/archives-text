# Byron Sher for assembly
## 
### 
Of course there's no reason to worry about —
much less vote in — elections for such petty offices
as California State Assembly, right? Wrong. There
is a candidate who not only deserves your support
in his quest for this district's assembly seat but who
also through his conduct and ideas promises to
make his performance matter to you and the state:
Byron Sher.
Sher has thoughtful, reasoned ideas on nearly ev
ery pressing issue that will come before the as
sembly in the upcoming term. Even more impor
tant, his positions on strong environmental protec
tions, fair fiscal measures and support for educa
tion are directed toward achieving results within
the assembly.
If Sher speaks with the calm, assured tone of a
politicized professor, there is good reason: for the
last two decades Sher has taught at the Law School
here. Yet there is no academic cant in his discussion
of the issues. He clearly sees the human conse
quences and political bargaining of each policy
measure.

Sher reflects a liberal policy presented with a
moderate tone and a willingness to seek the politi
cally possible. He is a strong environmentalist, con
cerned about toxic wastes and willing to do all an
assembly seat allows to oppose Interior Secretary
James Watt's designs on the California coast and
wilderness areas. He fully supports funding for
higher education and is particularly concerned
about the effects of state budget cuts upon the state
university system. Sher recognizes that efforts need
to be made to increase state revenues, but he is
equally wary of any measures that bear a regressive
quality.
Sher's principal opponent, nuclear engineer Wil
liam Parkinson, presents little threat to Sher and
certainly no reason to vote against the current as
semblyman; Parkinson openly admits his bid is de
signed to gain recognition for upcoming contests.
Do vote, and vote for Byron Sher. But perhaps
you should wonder, as we do when listening to him
speak with unusual intelligence and a certain glint
in his eye, when he is going to run for the higher of
fice he so evidently deserves.
