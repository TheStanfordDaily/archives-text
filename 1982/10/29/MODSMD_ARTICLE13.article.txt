						broad preparation for life. . . 
### 
It is difficult these days to tell anyone that we're majoring
in the humanities. Inevitably they ask, with some inex
plicable relish, what we plan to do after our four years are
up. Occasionally we humanities majors even needle each
other about practicality, seeming self-assured but actually
hoping in our hearts of hearts that someone has actually
thought of a way to give a classics major the legitimacy of an
engineering degree. Failing that, we simply drivel on about
existential crises of self-understanding and significance. Of
course, humanities majors are not different from anyone
else; all Stanford students, no matter how practical their ma
jor, sooner or later slow down enough to ask, why am I here?
To get an education. So that we can get jobs and make
money. No, there is more to Stanford than vocational educa
tion. Indeed, the whole notion of vocational education at a
university is overblown: any kind of education is low-level
perparation for any job, and the truly high-level training can
never come until one is actually on the job. And if more mon
ey is what we want, simply getting here and surviving is proof
that we have what it takes to get what we want out of almost
any situation. Having the Stanford name stamped on our
foreheads is only icing on the cake, and valuing Stanford for
its name only is a greater mistake than I would expect of any
of us.
We are here to get an education. Actually, there is one oth
er reason: to appreciate our experiences here as we live them,
for their own sake. Yet even then, if our appreciation is true,
each experience will fit into our total education and help pre
pare us for life. For that is education: becoming more fully
human in preparation for life.
Of course we need not be at Stanford in particular to ob
tain that kind of education; wherever we are it will happen to
some degree anyway. But here at Stanford are gathered the
resources that enable us to achieve a broad preparation for
life more completely than almost anywhere else in the world.
What follows, then, are some things to think about in order
to approach Stanford in a way that will prepare us well for
our lives ahead.
An educated man or woman is above all an individual. In
discovering what it means for each of us to be human, we

become unique. Thus the first step in a real education is to
get our noses out of books and beer glasses and begin to look
closely at the people around us. Certainly each one of us can
find at Stanford a few people, be they faculty or friends, who
have many worthwhile things to teach us about truths they
have learned for themselves. We should seek these people,
and rejoice in spending time with them, learning from the
way they think and act. An interaction between people is
always fresh, holding something new for its participants,
while a textbook is meant to say the same thing to many peo
ple.
As we begin to look around us, there are two qualities we
need to adopt in order to learn, to learn truly something ori
ginal for ourselves: attentiveness and humility. Attentive
ness is what we'll see in the exceptional people around us.
They are awake, observing what goes on around and inside
them, questioning what value it has for them. Attentiveness
is not the approach of a sponge, sitting in a classroom soak
ing up facts. It is perhaps more like the approach of the eagle,
now soaring, now diving, always keenly aware of its sur
roundings, giving special attention to anything that might
benefit it.
Humility is not as common. The prevailing attitude here is
rather one of skepticism. Too often a professor lectures
about a work of literature as if to say, I have mastered this
book and will impart to you what 1 think is significant in it.
The proud, skeptical student is an eagle that continually
swoops and kills its conceptual prey, but never stops to eat it.
Without ever adopting any beliefs, we never really learn any
thing new for ourselves. An open mind, like an open mouth,
should remain open only until it finds something substantial
to close upon and swallow.
Education is not complete without action. There is noth
ing inherently good about storing up knowledge and opin
ions. Our education is not worth having unless it changes our
lives, causing us to step out and act in a way that changes our
world.
