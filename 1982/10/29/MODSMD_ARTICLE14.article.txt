Alternative solution proposed to academic schedule debate: student vote

1 would like to suggest a possible
solution to the academic scheduling de
bate which seems only fair to everyone
involved.
From what I understand, there is no
consensus among the different academ
ic departments and their faculties as to
which system (quarter or semester) is
better. Furthermore, the evidence
seems to indicate that any department,
whether it be technically oriented or
not, can adjust to either schedule,
without much difficulty or drop in qual
ity.
Who is to decide which system is su
perior? I suggest that we leave that de
cision to the students themselves. A
campus-wide vote, as soon as possible
or perhaps in conjuction with the spring
government elections, would serve as

an excellent measure of student opin
ion. I know that student opinion may
have been solicited in the past, but I
think that times have changed just
enough to warrant another poll.
Like English Prof. Ronald Rebholz, I
would prefer the semester system.
Besides the advantages of having a
longer Christmas break in between two
grading periods that allow more in
depth study, the main advantage that I
see is the head start that semester stu
dents have in finding a worthwhile sum
mer job. In these times of increasing
educational costs which are not fore
casted to end in the near future, I would
be willing to bet that a large number of
students (including myself) are in
terested in raising as much money as
possible over the summer.

I realize that there are advantages to
both sytems. 1 am certainly not criticiz
ing Stanford; I just think that we should
have an academic system that is best for
the University as a whole. It appears
that the students are in the best position
to make that decision, so why not give
us that opportunity?

Freshman, undeclared
PLO and terrorism
Once again the Daily has published
a letter so rife with errors that any rea
sonable rebuttal would appear dis
jointed. Rachell Marshall states (Daily,
Oct. 26) that the PLO

has murdered "only" 106 Jews since
1967. Has she forgotten the 18 people
killed in Qiryat Shmonah, the 29 killed
in Maalot, the 28 killed at Lod, the 37
killed on the bus in 1978? We have not.
The PLO has in fact been responsible
for hundreds of acts of terror resulting
in thousands of deaths and maimings.
But terror defies measurement in simple
numbers of killed or maimed. The
slaughter of Israeli athletes in the 1972
Olympics was more than just the
murder of 11 people. It was a statement
to the world that Arab terrorism does
not observe any of the bounds of nor
mal society. Israel has justly retained
the right to fight against this terror.
Marshall raises the question, "Why
do we support Israel?" We support Is

rael because it is a democracy. This is
not simply an ethical decision. De
mocracies are stable. If Begin were to
die prematurely, his successor would
continue the democracy. In stark con
trast, there is not a single democracy in
the Arab world. The assassination of
any one of the dictators or kings in the
Arab world would cause a totally new
order. Nor are these assassinations un
common (n.b., Egypt, Saudi Arabia).
Finally, there is the assertion that the
formation of a Palestinian state inside
Israeli territory is the only path to
peace. The fact is that the Arabs have
maintained the current status of the
Palestinians for political purposes. Two
million Israelis absorbed the 700,000
(Yes there are five zeroes!) Jews driven

out of Arab lands. The Arabs number
over 100 million — could they not ab
sorb their brethren? If the Arabs or the
PLO were concerned with the welfare of
the Palestinians people then why did
they spend all their money on instru
ments of murder? The Israelis captured
more than one billion dollars worth of
PLO weapons in the recent war.
The time has come to stop thinking of
Israel as the only party involved that
can make concessions. The time is also
nigh for the Daily to start reviewing
opinion articles for factual content.
There is no subtle difference between
lies and opinions.

Oct. 26) that the PLO

has murdered "only" 106 Jews since
1967. Has she forgotten the 18 people
killed in Qiryat Shmonah, the 29 killed
in Maalot, the 28 killed at Lod, the 37
killed on the bus in 1978? We have not.
The PLO has in fact been responsible
for hundreds of acts of terror resulting
in thousands of deaths and maimings.
But terror defies measurement in simple
numbers of killed or maimed. The
slaughter of Israeli athletes in the 1972
Olympics was more than just the
murder of 11 people. It was a statement
to the world that Arab terrorism does
not observe any of the bounds of nor
mal society. Israel has justly retained
the right to fight against this terror.
Marshall raises the question, "Why
do we support Israel?" We support Is

rael because it is a democracy. This is
not simply an ethical decision. De
mocracies are stable. If Begin were to
die prematurely, his successor would
continue the democracy. In stark con
trast, there is not a single democracy in
the Arab world. The assassination of
any one of the dictators or kings in the
Arab world would cause a totally new
order. Nor are these assassinations un
common (n.b., Egypt, Saudi Arabia).
Finally, there is the assertion that the
formation of a Palestinian state inside
Israeli territory is the only path to
peace. The fact is that the Arabs have
maintained the current status of the
Palestinians for political purposes. Two
million Israelis absorbed the 700,000
(Yes there are five zeroes!) Jews driven

out of Arab lands. The Arabs number
over 100 million — could they not ab
sorb their brethren? If the Arabs or the
PLO were concerned with the welfare of
the Palestinians people then why did
they spend all their money on instru
ments of murder? The Israelis captured
more than one billion dollars worth of
PLO weapons in the recent war.
The time has come to stop thinking of
Israel as the only party involved that
can make concessions. The time is also
nigh for the Daily to start reviewing
opinion articles for factual content.
There is no subtle difference between
lies and opinions.

Alternative solution proposed to academic schedule debate: student vote

1 would like to suggest a possible
solution to the academic scheduling de
bate which seems only fair to everyone
involved.
From what I understand, there is no
consensus among the different academ
ic departments and their faculties as to
which system (quarter or semester) is
better. Furthermore, the evidence
seems to indicate that any department,
whether it be technically oriented or
not, can adjust to either schedule,
without much difficulty or drop in qual
ity.
Who is to decide which system is su
perior? I suggest that we leave that de
cision to the students themselves. A
campus-wide vote, as soon as possible
or perhaps in conjuction with the spring
government elections, would serve as

an excellent measure of student opin
ion. I know that student opinion may
have been solicited in the past, but I
think that times have changed just
enough to warrant another poll.
Like English Prof. Ronald Rebholz, I
would prefer the semester system.
Besides the advantages of having a
longer Christmas break in between two
grading periods that allow more in
depth study, the main advantage that I
see is the head start that semester stu
dents have in finding a worthwhile sum
mer job. In these times of increasing
educational costs which are not fore
casted to end in the near future, I would
be willing to bet that a large number of
students (including myself) are in
terested in raising as much money as
possible over the summer.

I realize that there are advantages to
both sytems. 1 am certainly not criticiz
ing Stanford; I just think that we should
have an academic system that is best for
the University as a whole. It appears
that the students are in the best position
to make that decision, so why not give
us that opportunity?

PLO and terrorism
Once again the Daily has published
a letter so rife with errors that any rea
sonable rebuttal would appear dis
jointed. Rachell Marshall states (Daily,
