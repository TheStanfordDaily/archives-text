## Registrar's office ignores timing of registration 
### 
For the last two years, students have
been forced to make major decisions at
registration and orientation. Consider
these facts: the second day of regis
tration in 1981 coincided with Rosh
Hashana and the first dav r»f regis
tration in '°°" > Yom
Kippur. These particular holidays —
Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur — are
the holiest days in the Jewish faith,
analagous to the Christian holy days
of Christmas and Easter in importance.
These days are spent in synagogue with
a Jewish community; there are prohibi
tions which, for example, totally pre
clude registering (e.g. one is not allowed
to write). At this point, you are proba
bly thinking that this issue is limited to a
particular religious group. However, if
the role of a university is to facilitate
group activities while permitting indi
viduals to maintain a sense of religious
identity, then there seems to be a prob
lem. I suggest the following: if such un
fortunate coincidences surfaced over
Christian holidays, then there would be
public outrage.
This overlap during the last two years
caused more problems than the ob
vious: whereto hold registration. More
profound issues which affected the well
being of students and faculty arose. For
one, Jewish students had to decide
whether to observe the holidays in their
new environment. This was not always

an easy decision because the overlap
forced students who were already con
fused and uncomfortable to set them
selves apart as being "different" at the
onset of the academic year. Moreover,
students had to miss participating in
orientation activities, choosing rooms
(as in Synergy and Columbae this year)
and signing up for certain classes. Each
area seemed to jeopardize one's aca
demic and social existence in some re
spect.
Although the administration in the
past has been quite helpful by making
special provisions for students affected
by the overlap, there are still the prob
lems of reaching students, maximizing
awareness and ensuring confidence in
the University's provisions. This past
year, for example, many students failed
to realize that they did not have to go
physically to registration; instead, they
could have made arrangements to be in
cluded in the master class list at their
designated times. Similarly, they did
not have to pay fees that day because
they could pay late without a penalty (If
you paid a "late fee" because of this
conflict, you arc urged to notify the
Registrar's Office and ask fora refund).
Still, more needs to be done. Students
were confused by these ad hoc arrange
ments. They doubted them and felt they
had to forfeit Jewish observance not to
jeopardize their academics. And, in

fact, observance of the most holy, sa
cred days was often forfeited. If the
University is truly facilitating activities,
it would not allow such overlaps to oc
cur. Individual belief and religious and
national identity are questioned in a
most unfair way.
As for why such overlaps were al
lowed to occur in the past, I have no sat
isfactory answer. The Jewish holidays,
determined by the Jewish lunar calen
dar, fall on different Gregorian calen
dar dates each year. When last year's
overlap was discovered back in Febru
ary, for example, an ad hoc committee
was quickly formed to deal with the
conflict; it was composed of University
officials, Chapel Dean Robert
Hamerton-Kelley and Hillel represent
atives. The group agreed to work
through established, official channels
to effect change rather than launch a
media campaign and stir up alumni
support. We were under the impression
that we had the necessary on-campus
support to change the academic calen
dar for 1982-83. Despite the fact that
University President Donald Kennedy
sympathized with the cause, the issue
got bogged down in the faculty senate.
There were basically two reasons for
opposing the calendar change. One,
materials had already hit the press for
registration in 1982, so such a change
was ruled "impractical." In fact, the

Registrar's Office had been given a
calendar which highlighted the main
Jewish holidays for the next 20 years
and should have known of the conflict
before February. And two, it was feared
that this proposed change would set a
precedent for similar changes and
prompt other groups to request
changes. As stated before, prohibitions
on these holidays directly preclude reg
istration, thus distinguishing them from
other requests which the faculty senate
might veto. Both reasons were not satis
factory in my mind.
The next overlap occurs in 1993 and
by starting an awareness campaign
now, we hope to change the academic
calendar in 1993 and eliminate the ten
sions associated with this troublesome
conflict.
This issue should not be ad hoc and
limited to the Stanford Jewish com
munity. Rather, it is an issue for people
with a sense of fairness. It is also an is
sue which makes us examine a more
global question — namely the role of
the University as it affects individuals.
For it just isn't right an isn't fair to sub
ject the Jewish community to additional
academic and social pressures at regis
tration.
