The San Francisco office of the FBI
was keeping tabs on gay student or
ganizations at Stanford and at other
Bay Area schools in the early 19705, ac
cording to documents recently released
to the Gay and Lesbian Alliance at
Stanford (GLAS).
The material, acquired under a Free
dom of Information Act (Fol A) request
filed by GLAS archivist Ray
Koskovich, reveals that the FBI estab
lished files on these groups.
Koskovich, a graduate student in art
history, said he was not surprised by the
discovery. "I would have been sus
picious if there hadn't been anything.
Gay students at Stanford had been very
outspoken, and have had an organized
public presence since the late 19605."

Although he suspected such FBI ac
tivity, Koskovich called the agency's
actions "singularly ridiculous. A tre
mendous waste of taxpayers' money."
"It doesn't surprise me a lot," said
Thomas Massey, associate dean of stu
dent affairs, when informed of the situ
ation. "It certainly is dismaying that
anyone would have their rights
abridged by a federal agency,"
According to Lane Bonner, super
visory special agent in the press office of
the FBl's national headquarters, "In
the early 1970s the FBI was ordered by
the White House and the Department
of Justice to conduct investigations-of
numerous organizations nationwide
whose activities could be adverse to the
security of the United States. Whether
this (the Stanford gay students' or
ganization) was one of them I couldn't
say."

Assoc. History Prof. Barton Berns
tein, who has used FoIA extensively in
his studies of surveillance during the
past decades, speculated that "there
may not have been a director from
Washington asking for information on
gays specifically." Instead, he said,
these documents may have been com
piled by a local agent who was spying
on other things and decided to keep
tabs on the gays as well.
Nineteen pages of material, dating
from 1971 to 1975, were released. These
include a copy of the San Mateo Gay
People's Union constitution, clippings
from The Daily Pioneer at Cal State-
Hay ward, a 1971 Stanford Daily story
with the headline, "Gay Students Drop
Straight Roles" and a UC-Berkeley stu
dent activities directory.
In the documents, many sentences
and paragraphs which the FBI claimeo
could not be released are blotted out.
Some of these sections deal with how
the information was obtained or who
informants were.
Bonner said he could not comment
on the material that was released, be
cause under FoIA "we're not required
to provide further explanation of the
contents." He added, "the contents
stand on their own."
The FBI informed GLAS that they
withheld an additional six complete
pages of related material. Three pages
were not released because they contain
classified information, which the FBI
defined as being "in the interest of the
national defense or foreign policy," and
the remaining three were withheld to
protect confidential sources and the
personal privacy of others, and to pro
tect the internal rules and practices of
the FBI, according to a letter from
FBl's San Francisco office to GLAS.
Koskovich said the FBl's
"notoriously homophobic and
notoriously archaic" attitudes on social
issues were the reason for their scrutiny
of the gay organizations at Stanford.
According to Bonner, "We do not
and have not investigated so-called gay
rights group." He added, "sometimes
our investigations may take us to indi
viduals of that persuasion, but we do
not investigate the organizations per
sc."
Bernstein said in the early 1970s the
FBI "had biases against blacks and
gays and other deviant groups, al
though there's been a good deal of evi
dence that J. Edgar Hoover himself
may have been a homosexual."
He added, "I would think that the
spying was done on the assumption that
this was a deviant and dangerous
