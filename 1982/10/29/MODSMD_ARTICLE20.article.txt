# College football broadcasting no game
## 
### MARK ZEIGLER 
It's become somewhat of an
American tradition on week
end mornings Tor armchair
quarterbacks to flick on the
TV — to football, of course.
Beer and chips in close
proximity, the viewer starts
the day and ends it in the same
place — the chair or the
couch. But while the viewer is
doing his best to imitate a
slug, the TV network is hastily
piecing together the telecast.
Networks don't just point
their cameras towards the
football field and "flick"
them on at game-time.
There's a bit more to it than
that.
"You don't roll into Stan
ford Stadium Saturday morn
ing and wing it,"says CBS
football analyst Pat Haden.
Stanford will appear on na
tional television for the third
time this year tomorrow after
noon when they face No. 2
ranked Washington at Stan
ford Stadium. The Cardinal
also made national ap
pearances against Ohio State
in September and USC two
weeks ago, a game broadcast
by CBS.
Before the USC contest,
CBS held a two-hour seminar
with its top producers, direc
tors and announcers that ex
plained the trials and tribu
lations of nationally televising
college football. About SO
communication students and
various media personalities
attended the seminar.
Although the action on the
field is certainly important,
money gained from ad
vertisers is the name of the
game for CBS. "It (TV sports)
is very much a business of
what advertisers want to
buy," Kevin O'Malley, ex
ecutive producer of CBS col
lege sports said.
"With sports, advertisers
can target the type of audience
they want to meet," he con
tinued.
Not until the mid-'7os,
however, were TV sports op
erated fora profit. CBS

Sports broke into the black
for the first time in 1975, ac
cording to O'Malley. In fact,
20 to 25 percent of all profits
generated by the ABC, CBS
and NBC is amassed through
sports broadcasts, he said.
O'Malley noted the four
main functions of a network
when a sporting event is in
volved: acquisition, sales, dis
tribution and production of
broadcast.
In acquiring the broadcast
rights to particular athletic
events, the network pays big
bucks, usually to the tune of
multi-millions when concern
ing one of the major sports.

CBS paid Stanford
$543,000 for its national tele
vision appearance two weeks
ago against USC. However, a
large portion of that sum was
divided by the rest of the
Pac-10 schools, as is the policy
of the conference. For the sea
son, Steve Raczinski, assis
tant sports information direc
tor, estimated that Stanford
has received close to a million
dollars from TV football ap
pearances.
After acquiring rights, the
network then begins to sell its
product.
"College football as a sport
is very different from pro
football," LaCivita said.
"There's a lot going on off the
field." He added that while
approximately 80 percent of a
pro football telecast is spent

documenting the game, only
55 percent of the college tele
cast should cover events be
tween the goal-lines.
Consequently, college and
pro football attract different
TV audiences. A propor
tionately more female, more
educated and older crowd
views college football than the
pro game, which attracts a
more representative cut of so
ciety.
The final step, after the
commercial spots are sold ana
the telecast distributed to
network affiliates, is the tele
cast itself. Fora nationally tel-

evised football game, CBS
brings more equipment as
well as its top announcing and
production teams.
Although the viewer only
sees or hears the announcers
in a given game, the men be
hind the scenes, the producer
and director, actually in
fluence the telecast the most.
While the producer is in
charge of coordinating things
before going on the air, the di
rector is, as CBS director
Robert Fishman puts it,"in
the hot seat" come game time.
"The director is basically
the quarterback in the sense
that it is my decision what pic
ture gets on the air," Fishman
said. "Overall, a director can
make or break a telecast."
Fishman is CBS's lead college
football director.

If the director is the quar
terback, then the producer is
the coaching staff. The pro
ducer, in essence, plans what
the general procedure will be
during certain portions in the
game — how to break into a
commercial or what to do af
ter a touchdown.
As LaCivita points out, "A
natural (football) play is ap
proximately 8 seconds long.
But what do you do in be
tween?" Most of the pro
ducer's chores occur the pre
ceding a telecast. "We sit
down and figure out how the
time will be spent," he said.
At the USC game, CBS em
ployed a total of seven camer
as: three in the press box, one
each at the 20, 50 and 20 yard
lines, one in the north end
zone, one a cart on the side
lines and one "mini-cam"
(hand-held camera) on each
of the two sidelines. The latter
two are used for the pageantry
shots of the crowd, bands and
cheerleaders (called "honey
shots").
The producer and director
sit next to each other in front
of monitors of each camera
inside the "truck," where all
the technical maneuverings
aremade. "We live in a little
closed world in the truck,"
Fishman said. "It's definitely
a team effort."
Upstairs in the press box sit
the announcers, who receive
messages from the truck
through headphones. With
the director in one ear and the
producer in the other, the an
noucers are informed of the
split-second technical de
cisions made in the truck.
"When you all are seeing
commercials on the air, that's
when we are doing most of
our work." Fishman said. He
noted that in the course of a
two to three hour telecast, he
makes over 300 technical de
cisions.
"We don't have 30 minutes
after the game to write head
lines," producer Lacivita said.
"We do it under the gun —
live."
