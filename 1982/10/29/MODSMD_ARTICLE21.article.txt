## Balanced Washington attack unbeaten Stanford hosts No. 2 Huskies 
### SID SPAETH 
'The Washington Huskies,
ranked No. 1 for most of the sea
son and now No. 2,by The As
sociated Press writers poll, will
shed their warm-up jackets for
the first time this season against
Stanford tomorrow.
The Huskies had the pre-sea
son acclaim of having the easiest
schedule of all national powers
and the John Elway-led Cardinal
should pose their first major
challenge.
Pass-happy Stanford shocked
everyone last week with a pierc
ing ground attack in their 31-26
come-from-behind win over
Washington State.
Meanwhile, the Huskies nearly
had a nine-game winning streak
shattered by lowly Texas Tech,
but bounced back fora 10-3 win.
Sophomore running back Jac
ques Robinson raced fora ca
reer-high 203 yards against Texas
Tech last Saturday. Robinson,
from San Jose, emerged from
being a part-time player to a
household name last January
when he became the first
freshman ever to win the Rose
Bowl's Most Valuable Player
award.
Robinson is second in the con
ference in rushing, averaging 67.1
yards per game.
Junior quarterback Steve
Pelluer muddled through a 45-
yard performance last week, but
has hit 57 percent of his passes for
1131 yards and nine touchdowns
on the season. He ranks fourth in
the conference in passing.
Pelluer fires passes at a set of
receivers who can cover the entire
field. Flanker Paul Skanski has
33 catches, split end Anthony Al
len has 31 and tight end Willie
Rosborough has 14.
Placekicker Chuck Nelson has
been the Huskies most potent of
fensive weapon. Nelson holds the
NCAA record with 25 con
secutive field goals without a
miss and leads the conference in
scoring with a 12.1 points per
game average.
Washington's offensive line is
big and mobile and makes both
the pass and the run work.
"Washington is probably the
most solid team we've faced this
year," Stanford coach Paul Wig
gin said. "Every phase of their
game is exceptional, from offense
to defense to special teams."

Outside linebacker Garin Ver
is said the Cardinal defense will
have its hands full with Washing
ton.
"It's a big challenge for us to
play a team like Washington,"
Veris said. "But I feel we have
just as good a ballclub. They
(Washington's offensive
linemen) are big and fairly quick.
They do various things with them
and their mobility helps them out
a lot."
Stanford's defense was ailing
slightly last week, but should be
at full strength tomorrow.

Safety Vaughn Williams and
noseguard Terry Jackson suf
fered injuries Saturday, but will
be at full strength, and linebackcr
Gary Wimmer, who missed all of
last week's game, will be ready to
play.
Stanford's ground attack piled
up a season-high 246 yards last
week. Mike Dotterer filled in for
an injured Vincent White and
rambled for 155 yards â€” the best
effort by a Stanford running back
other than Darrin Nelson since
1958.
"Mike was simply brilliant,"

Wiggin said. "Washington State
was giving us the run, and with
Vincent (White) still recovering
from his shoulder injury, Mike
was the man."
The key threat in Stanford's at
tack, however, is still Elway.
Elway completed only 10-of-26
passes for 85 yards last week, but
was hurt by six dropped passes.
"The thing that we historically
do best is catch the football,"
Wiggin said. "We failed to do
that consistently last week, which
is difficult for me to explain. And
penalties continue to be a prob
