# UCLA rips Card booters

### STEVE ODELL 
The Stanford soccer team
received a blow to its chances
of competing in post-season
play Wednesday when No. 14
UCLA defeated the Cardinal
3-2 in Westwood. The Bruins
exploded to a 3-0 lead in the
first half and then staved off a
furious late-game Stanford
rally.
Both Cardinal goals were
scored by freshman striker
Todd Rafalovich within a 50-
second span late in the game.
The first of Rafalovich's
goals came with six minutes
left, when he took the ball on a
cross pass from the back left
side and booted it in. The six
foot, 170-pounder from
Saratoga High School rec
orded his second goal mo
ments later, this time taking a
cross pass from the right side,
faking a head shot, trapping
the ball in his chest and then
kicking it home.
Stanford had a chance to tie
with one minute remaining,
when there was a mad
scramble for the ball in front
of the UCLA goal. The ball
popped up and struck a Bruin
on the hand. The referee ruled
that it was a "ball-to-hand"
instead of a "hand-to-ball,"
however, meaning that the
contact was unintentional.
There was no penalty there
fore and time ran out.
The Cardinal was ham
pered by injuries to three of its
starters, including fullback
Doug Clark, who missed the
entire game, midfielder Angel
Vasquez and striker Gian
carlo Ferruzzi.
"We really missed Clark in
the middle," said senior
sweeper Mark Talkington.
"We played really bad in the
first half â€” I think we were
kind of lackluster after losing
to Dominguez Hills (a
Division II school, 3-1 in ov
ertime Monday)."
The Cardinal, now 12-4-1
on the season, substituted
back-up goalie Dave Mann
into the game in the second
half to take advantage of his
offensive punting abilities.
Mann, a senior, made four
saves and kept the ball con
sistently in Bruin territory
with booming kicks from the
goal.

"We just came out and to
tally dominated the second
half," said Talkington. "We
knew we didn't have anything
to lose. We kept pressuring
them and kept our cool and
really had them on the run."
UCLA, now 12-3 overall,
scored in the first, fifth and
31 st minutes of the first half in
building what proved to be an
insurmountable lead.
Stanford plays sixth
ranked University of San
Francisco Sunday at 11 a.m.

at Maloney Field. While the
loss to the Bruins made the
Cardinal's play-off hopes that
much more remote, a strong
finish could add some games
to its season. The game with
the Dons takes on added sig
nificance because of it.

"We can regroup," said
Talkington. "We can still
make the play-offs if we beat
USF and Fresno State. That
would throw the standings
wide open."
