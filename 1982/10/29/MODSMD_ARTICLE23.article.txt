# Poloists get third shot at No. I Irvine
## 
### CHRIS ADDINGTON 
The Stanford water polo team
will head south this weekend to
compete in the year's most presti
gious tourney before the
NCAAs, the Pacific- 10/ Pacific
Coast Athletic Association in
terconference tournament.
The Cardinal will take on the
four top teams in the PCAA
tomorrow and Sunday in the Bel
mont Plaza Natatorium at Long
Beach.

Tomorrow's matches will be
against No. 1 Irvine and No. 10
Long Beach State, while Sunday
Stanford meets No. 5 UC-Santa
Barbara and No. 9 Pepperdine.
In addition to Stanford, the
Pac-10 will be represented by
UC-Berkeley, USC and UCLA.
"There will definitely be some
upsets in this tourney," predicted
Stanford coach Dante Det
tamanti. "Tournament play

means tired teams and different
levels of intensity."
Although the Cardinal, cur
rently ranked No. 2 nationally
and sporting a 17-3 overall rec
ord, does not need to come out
victorious this weekend to ad
vance to the NCAAs, the tour
nament is important for final
seeding in the national cham
pionships.
"If we can maintain our No. 2

position I'll be really pleased,"
said Dettamanti.
Looking beyond the tour
nament the Cardinal has a tough
schedule ahead as its three re
maining conference games are all
on the road.
Stanford's next and final home
games will be against UC-Davis
and the University of the Pacific
November sth and 6th respec
tively.


LOOKING FOR HELP: John Tanner looked fora teammate
to pass to in the Card's 5-4 loss to UC-Irrine earlier this year.
No. 2 Stanford will get another shot at top-ranked Inine Satur-

Greg Webb/Daily
day at the P«.c-10 — PCAA Interconference Tournament in
Long Beach.
