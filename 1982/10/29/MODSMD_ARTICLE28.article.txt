The Farmer's Market is a
small, family-owned restaurant
that has served Palo Alto for five
years.
Bob and I biked over for lunch
on Friday. Our first impression
as we walked in was that of a cas
ual deli-type restaurant — simple
decor — white walls, small
wooden tables and rock music
playing quietly in the back
ground. We first opened the front
refrigerator case, pulled a small
bottle of the house wine and
some sparkling apple cider from
the myriad of natural fruit juices,
sodas and milk before us and
proceeded through the self-serve
line. Spread there first was an ar
ray of salads — garden vegetable,
avocado-cucumber, fruit,
potato, macaroni and coleslaw..
These ranged in price from 75'
cents to 51.40.

Next we encountered different
kinds of pre-wrapped cold sand
wiches such as turkey, ham, roast
beef, salami, tuna, egg salad etc.
on white or dark bread for about
52.25-S4. The fresh fruit looked
appetizing, but a slice of straw
berry pie somehow asserted itself
and wound up on our tray.
I asked over the counter for the
Friday Special: a grilled crab
sandwich with my choice of
either New England or Man
hattan clam chowder for $5.50.1
ordered the Manhattan, which
comes in a tomato sauce as op
posed to a cream sauce. Bob or
dered a hot Ham grill ($4), which
came with an avocado-cucumber
salad.
We continued along the coun
ter past an assortment of teas and
coffee and sat down at a clean

table. A friendly, relaxed waitress
brought us our sandwiches a few
minutes after we sat down and we
began our meal.
The house wine, Mirassou
1980 Monterey Riesling, a semi
dry white wine, mingled nicely
with the seafood theme of my
lunch. The Manhattan chowder,
overall, tasted good. However,
clam bits were only sparsely scat
tered throughout, and those I did
come across were at times chewy.
Bob's avocado-cucumber salad,
on the other hand, was excellent
in every aspect. Just the right
amount of vinegar, oil and
avocado adorned this motley as
sortment of shredded and thinly
sliced vegetables, giving it just the
right tangy flavor.
My grilled crab sandwich con
sisted of a hearty amount of
fresh-tasting crabmeat in a may
onnaise sauce with melted white
cheese and tomato slices nestled
between two slices of white
bread. The butteriness of the
bread plus the mayonnaise of the
crabmeat was a combination a
little too rich for my personal
tastes. Bob's ham sandwich was
thickly loaded with hot ham on
rye bread and we both found it
delicious.
The "fresh-baked" strawberry
pie was aesthetically appealing,
although the sweet heavy sauce
competed with and almost over
whelmed the whole strawberries
it surrounded.
Before leaving, we had a look
at the breakfast and brunch
menus, which offered usual
breakfast items plus some in-

teresting extras: whole wheat
muffins (I sampled one — de
licious'.), French toast made of
apple bread soaked in a whipped
cream batter and topped with

bananas (3 slices for $2.75), a
ham, swiss and apple omelette
($4). several meatless omelettes,
and apple pancakes. Brunch for
$6.95 included a choice of entrees
plus a fresh fruit salad cup, a
glass of champagne, orange juice,
or grapefruit juice, and coffee,
tea or milk.
