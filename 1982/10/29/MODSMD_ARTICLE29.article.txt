the delicious menu
496 Hamilton Ave.
325-1994
Have you ever felt like going out to an inexpensive breakfast
— but not to McDonald's for an Egg McMuffin and not to food
service for granola?
The Delicious Menu — or The Deli-cious Menu, as the deli
bar sign proclaims — offers one alternative. Its plain, unpreten
tious decor provides a low-key setting, which is appropriate for
the simple, wholesome menu. It looks like a dive — but it might
be worth it to dive in.
We arrived slightly before 8 a.m. and expected a rush. But
fortunately for us —even if not for the restaurant — a breakfast
crowd failed to appear.
The sole breakfast shift waiter was extremely amiable, and
immediately asked us if we'd like hot coffee.
We did. We also wisely decided not to resist the pastries
prominently displayed in front of the cook's counter. Based on
the taste of the apple strudel and the tempting looks of the 1000-
calorie (a wild guess) baklava, the homemade pastries are un
doubtedly the best features of the restaurant. Upon request, any
of them can be heated in a microwave oven.
A pastry and a cup of coffee provides a more than sufficient
breakfast. Bui as we smelled the breakfast foods (especially
bacon), we decided to do justice to the Breakfast Deli-cious
Menu.
We virtuously selected the short rather large stack of pan
cakes and French toast ($1.95). The two pancakes were large
but not unusal. Two thin pieces of ordinary bread constituted

the French toast. A pitcher of hot syrup accompanied both
choices. Both were adequate but slightly disappointing after the
delicious pastries.
A large sign on the front window advertises the $2.44 daily
special, eggs and bacon, which the waiter described as popular.
Deli-cious sandwiches cost between $2.39 and $3.39. They
range from standard roast beef to chicken salad with cashew
nuts. The salad bar offers standard potato salad and cole slaw
— but also features feta salad.
The Deli-cious Menu, perhaps in an effort to distinguish its
hamburgers from those of competitors, offers a one-third pound
deli burger. The grill also offers a deli steak sandwich with on
ions, bell pepper and mushrooms.
Luncheon specialties are meatloaf and peroshki.
Unlike many similar delis, we were not "sandwiched" in at
our table, because the one-room restaurant comfortably seats
40 indoors. It also offers outside seating to those who find the
corner of Hamilton and Cowper scenic.
The Delicious Menu is open from 6:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. and
will extend its hours until 9 p.m. after Nov. 1. The dinner menu
will feature spareribs to go.
The Delicious Menu also offers catering.
The restaurant, which has been open fora year, is run by a
former physical education teacher and his son. Their philoso
phy is best characterized by the the message on the menu, "It is
our pleasure to serve you, and we wish you a very pleasant day."
The Delicious Menu is ideal fora nice, but not exceptional start
to your day.
