Weinberger warns against nuclear freeze
Washington — Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger jumped yesterday
on a tough speech by Soviet President Leonid Brezhnev in a bid to convince
American voters that a nuclear weapons freeze would increase the danger of
war.
Weinberger also appeared to back away from his assertion last week that
he did not believe the U.S. Marine peacekeeping force in Lebanon would be
enlarged and its mission broadened. .
"I can't really say what we'll be doing three to four weeks from now,"
Weinberger told a news conference. However, he stressed that "it is not an
open-ended commitment" and that the first priority is to gain withdrawal of
all foreign Arab and Israeli forces from Lebanon together with a buildup of
Lebanese army strength.
Weinberger came to his first general Pentagon news conference in nearly
21 months armed with a statement obviously designed to persuade voters in
eight states who wilt decide next week on resolutions calling fora bilateral
nuclear arms freeze.
"Proponents of these nuclear freeze resolutions believe that such a step
would reduce the risk of war and increase prospects fora U.S.-Soviet arms
reductions agreement," Weinberger said.
"We think it will be just the opposite. The truth of the matter is that a
nuclear freeze would weaken the deterrent forces we rely on to prevent war,"
he added.
The Pentagon chief noted pointedly that Brezhnev, in a Moscow speech to
Soviet defense leaders, "pledged the Soviet Union to continue the path of an
even more intensified quest for military superiority."
Stressing that Brezhnev called for steps "further to improve the Soviet
Union's war fighting capability," Weinberger said the Brezhnev speech un
derlines reasons for not entering into a freeze as sought by the resolutions
before U.S. voters.
Under questioning, Weinberger described as an "absurdity" Brezhnev's
accusation that the war in Lebanon was a U.S. creation.
Spanish Socialists score large win
Madrid — The Socialist Workers Party won a solid majority in yesterday's
parliamentary elections, which will make Felipe Gonzalez the first Socialist
premier in Spain since the 1936-39 civil war.
