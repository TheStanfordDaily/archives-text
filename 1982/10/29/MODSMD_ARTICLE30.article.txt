urious name, you say. Agreed,
ut one easier to comprehend
hen you realize what it stands
jn junk food with a difference.
Served inside is a veritable
lenagerie of foods — some of
'hich barely deserve the "junk
3dd" label, but all of which fall
rell within junk food prices. In
luded are edibles to tempt a wide
ariety of palates: everything
•om corned beef, pastrami and
leat ball sandwiches to potato
kins, cheese blintzes and beef
>eroshkis.
We chose two from a vast list

of sandwiches: the steak (53.90)
and Italian sausage ($2.80). I've
had better steaks, but in all
fairness I hardly expected filet
mignon on a French roll. The
Italian sausage, harnessed in the
same roll (which, incidentally,
tended to disintegrate within a
couple of minutes), was a
marvelous blend of spices and
met with hearty approval from
both sides of the table. Rounded
off with a healthy serving of
French fries (superb), we were
easily filled up at meal's end.
(Were we not, however, we might
very well have fallen temptation
to perhaps chocolate mousse
torte or New York cheesecake,
only two of a dessert list humbly
headlined on the menu as
"munchies.")
I'm hardly one to expect am
biance from a place that serves
(and revels in the fact that they
serve) fast food, but Joy of
Junque comes about as close as
one possibly could. Tactfully

decorated in a sort of a pseudo
rustic style, it is also spotlessly
clean throughout. (The fact that
we were half the clientele during
our stay may have had something
to do with that.) The restaurant

hostess, took our order with a
smile and brought trays to the
table so fast that we forgot to
time her.
Other things we apparently

should have tried but didn't: the
Polish sausage sandwich (genu
ine Chicago sausage, no less), the
corned beef sandwich, and the
Don Juan, one of their most pop
ular items (and for obvious rea
sons) — a whole baked potato
stuffed with beef, tomato, on
ions, cheese, lettuce and sour
cream. The Don Juan goes for
$2.75 and much of the menu sells
for about that price.
Manager David Zimbler con
fided that so far business has
been about 70 percent ham
burgers and hot dogs, which is a
great pity really, because Joy of
Junque has so much more to of
fer — all for no more than you
could expect to pay for (and here
I apologize for the inevitable
comparison) a Togo's sandwich.
The similarity ends there, how
ever, this is not a sandwich shop:
this is junk food with a dif
ference. And a delightful dif
ference at that.

ions, cheese, lettuce and sour
cream. The Don Juan goes for
$2.75 and much of the menu sells
for about that price.
Manager David Zimbler con
fided that so far business has
been about 70 percent ham
burgers and hot dogs, which is a
great pity really, because Joy of
Junque has so much more to of
fer — all for no more than you
could expect to pay for (and here
I apologize for the inevitable
comparison) a Togo's sandwich.
The similarity ends there, how
ever, this is not a sandwich shop:
this is junk food with a dif
ference. And a delightful dif
ference at that.
