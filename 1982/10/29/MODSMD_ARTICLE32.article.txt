Rolling out of bed at 6:30 on a
Monday morning to go out for
breakfast may seem a bit crazy,
but for the food at Dinah's
Poolside Coffee Shop it was well
worth the trip.
Dinah's Coffee Shop, fre
quented regularly by quite a few
Stanford students, is located just
past Rickey's Hyatt on El
Camino in Palo Alto and serves
only breakfast. As you may have
guessed from the name, it is situ
ated next to the swimming pool
at Dinah's Motor Inn. About
half of the tables and a sit-down

counter area are indoors; the rest
of the tables are outdoors on the
pool deck.
The indoor part of the restau
rant resembles a typical old-fash
ioned coffee shop: the table tops
are all-white formica and the
chairs are covered in an aqua
blue vinyl. The token attempt at
color coordination is the aqua
blue waitress uniforms. Un
fortunately, there is also a noisy
undertone of clanking dishes and
glasses, but, unlike many coffee
shops, Dinah's Coffee Shop is re
markably clean.
The outdoor tables, which
seem to be what make Dinah's
Poolside special, were closed due
to weather, but we were assured
that on a sunny day they were the
perfect spot to enjoy breakfast.

particularly fora leisurely week
end brunch.
At first glance the menu ap
pears rather ordinary — eggs,
pancakes, juice, fresh fruits,
Danish rolls and breakfast meats
— but a closer look reveals
Dinah's specialty — omelettes.
Omelettes here are built like
rolled-up pizzas. There is a basic
three-egg omelette and each
added ingredient costs a little bit
extra, averaging 70 cents to $1.40
per item. There are also house
specialties, which are suggested
combinations of ingredients. The
ingredients range from the com
mon cheddar cheese and
mushroom, to more unusual in
gredients like linguica (an Italian
sausage). Thus, as the menu
boasts, there are over 65,000 dif
ferent omelette combinations
from which to choose.
We began our meal with
freshly squeezed orange juice and
coffee. Shortly after, we received
a large and tasty omelette filled
abundantly with cheddar cheese,
Jack cheese, onion, bellpeppers
and mushrooms served with hash
browns and buttered toast with
jelly ($5.35). It wasn't hard to see
how Dinah's omelettes earned
their reputation.

Surprisingly good were the
blueberry pancakes ($2.55).
There was no shortage of berries
in this selection and when topped
with butter and syrup, they were
a taste sensation.
Dinah's also offers the tradi
tional breakfasts of bacon, ham
or sausage and eggs, along with
an assortment of pancakes, waf
fles and French toast. These
meals range from $3 to $4. (But in
our personal opinion, we would
suggest trying a build-your-own
omelette — it's the one breakfast
which makes Dinah's so unique.)
Our delicious breakfast was
complemented by quick and
friendly service, but we would
recommend dining outdoors on a
sunny morning to fully ap
preciate this coffee shop's unique
atmosphere.
Dinah's is open Monday
through Friday from 6:30 a.m. to
2 p.m., and weekends from 6:30
a.m. to 2:30 p.m. Whether you
are crazy like us and get up for
breakfast at 6:30 a.m., or prefer
to sleep in and then enjoy a late
brunch, Dinah's is the perfect
place for you.
