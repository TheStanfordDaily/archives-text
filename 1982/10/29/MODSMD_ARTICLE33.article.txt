Notorious (1946) *
New Varsity, Palo Alto
The most romantic of Alfred
Hitchcock's pictures. When her
father turns out to be a Fascist,
Ingrid Bergman feels she must
clear her name by working to trap
another Fascist — her husband
(Claude Rains). (The plot has a
number of similarities to Orson
Welles' The Stranger, released the
same year.) Bergman looks rav
ishing, and her scenes with Cary
Grant, as the agent she is allied
with, are among the few genuine
examples of eroticism in Ameri
can films of this puritanical dec
ade. Ben Hecht wrote the
screenplay. Classic sequences: the
wine cellar scene and the famous
full-length shot of Bergman's
ring.
Plays Wednesday only with
Casablanca.
Touch of Evil (1958) ★
Kresge
Nearly two decades after
Citizen Kane, Orson Welles made
this breathtaking baroque thriller
" ; based on a Whit Masterson novel,
112 He and his photographer, Russell
Metty, shot the film in Venice,
California, but it seems to have
been made in Hell, and no one
who has seen it can drive through
Venice without thinking he is in
Hell. The peculiarly effective cast
includes Welles himself. Marlene
Dietrich, Charlton Heston, Akim
Tamiroff, Joseph Cotten, Zsa Zsa
Gabor, Mercedes McCambridge,
and Janet Leigh, who has an ex
tremely unpleasant prt-Psycho
encounter in a motel.
Plays Monday evening.

t A. droll erotic comedy from

hjj|fhog»or|us eyes are accented.

and he looks startlingly young —
almost unformed. His perpetually
astonished eyes are the emblem of
the film: Remy is an un
premeditating Humhert Humbert
repeatedly baffled by his own
helplessness. Visually, this is a
strangely cool movie, conceived
by Blier and his photographer,
Sacha Vierny, mostly in blues
andwhites; Blier is such a super
lative technician that he carries
off this sleek, glacial style, but we
might ask why he chose it. With
Nicole Garcia and Nathalie Baye.
Plays Thursday only with
Going Places.
Coup de Tete (1980)
Cuboerley Theatre (5000 Mid
dlefield), Palo Alto
Patrick Dewaere plays Fran
cois Perier, a factory worker and
soccer player in a small town in
France. He is kicked off the team
and loses his job when he injures
the star player in a practice
match; he is also unjustly jailed
for rape but released when the
team needs another player —and
he's made a town hero when he
wins the game Though it has
some reasonably skillful plot
complications in the second half,
this movie (written by Francis
Veber and directed by Jean-Jac
ques Annaud) is inferior in every
way to the comedies Rene Clair
and Preston Sturges made on
these same themes of political
corruption, popular heroism and
the rebellion of the common man.
However, Dewaere, playing the
rebel as a sexy" bum, has some
shining comic moments.
Plays Wednesday evening.
Alien (1979)
Kresge
Ridley Scott's outer-space hor
ror film begins elegantly, with
tracking shots through a magnif
icent space ship designed by
Michael Seymour. The ship
ismanned by first-rate actors
(Yaphet Kotto, Tom Skerritt,
Harry Dean Stanton, John Hurt,
Veronica Cartwright) — no
cinematic vehicle has ever
boasted such a classy crew. But
they have one-dimensional, un
developed roles and their interac
tion exists solely on a business
level. (They don't even call each
other by their first names.) As
well as sympathetic characters,
the film lacks wit, narrative skill
and inventiveness of plot; the only
imaginative scene is the most gris
ly one. It's an effective and
loathsome picture. Derek Vanlint
did the impressive cinemato
graphy.
Plays tomorrow evening
