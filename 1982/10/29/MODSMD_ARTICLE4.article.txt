# Trancos evacuation
## Students flee damaged dorm 
### DOUGLAS JEHL KRISTEN CHRISTOPHER 
Trancos house residents were tem
porarily evacuated early this morning
• after some students there noticed crack
, ing and warping in bedroom walls.
'"ire department officials told stu
dents to leave at 1:15 a.m. after making
a quick investigation and finding that
walls between rooms were bending. Al
though University officials allowed stu
dents to return to their rooms at 2:30,
the officials said they did not know
what had caused the bending of the
walls. Structural engineers will conduct
further investigations today.
The decision to let residents return
was made jointly by University officials
present and public safety officials, ac

cording to Robert Mibach, manager of
facilities and services for residences.
"There is a problem, but not a serious
problem," Mibach told Trancos resi
dents gathered in the dorm lounge fora
post-evacuation briefing. "It is safe to
assume that everything is OK."
However, Capt. Jerry Davis, the sen
ior fire department official at the scene,
told the Daily the decision to let resi
dents return was not a good one. "I
wouldn't sleep in there," Davis said.
Mibach assured the students there
was no problem with the bearing walls
— the solid concrete walls that support
the building. The flexing walls, he said,
are non-bearing walls, and thus present
no danger that the building will col
lapse.

Other campus buildings have had
this problem in the past, Mibach said
after the meeting, and University of
ficials had known that the walls of
Trancos room 106 were deflected. But
the problem "wasn't of significant mag
nitude to warrant any replacement,"
Mibach said.
Some students living on the first floor
returned to rooms in which walls were
cracked and noticeably bent. Said one:
"Maybe I'll move my bed into the
middle of the room." Walls in a number
of first-floor rooms were curved or
showed cracks. Accounts of how many
rooms were affected differed: Mibach
said only a few walls were bent, particu-
