# 21 st District candidates debate
## 
### KEVIN GROSS 
. Last night's debate between the 21st-
District state Assembly candidates
seemed a typical conclusion to a low
key race for Democratic incumbent
Byron Sher's (Palo Alto) legislature
seat.
It was the minor-party candidates,
Libertarian Russell Fridley and Peace
and Freedom candidate Frank De Sio,
who enlivened the Palo Alto League of
Women Voters forum, which also in
cluded Republican challenger Bill
Parkinson.
Fridley, who disagreed sharply with
Pe Sio throughout the debate, said,

"We must cut
spending and
taxes, and dis
mantle the
welfare sys
tem . . .It is no
surprise that

we have economic problems in a coun
try where 40 percent of the GNP is
IMnjH uutfjr from the pwoplo throwgh
taxation. This money should be rein
vested in the economy, to create new
employment and new opportunities for
people."
In an impassioned plea, De Sio urged
voters to elect him to the state legisla
ture because of the failure of the Demo

cratic and Republican parties to bring
about adequate reform of the economic
system.
"(The) parties have created a certain
amount of harassment, excuses and de
lays in pursuing reforms of our econom
ic system."
Earlier, De Sio had suggested in
creasing the budget for human services,
stating his belief that, "We have the
wrong priorities. We're wasting
trillions of dollars fora war." He ad
vocates large cuts in the defense budget.
Parkinson also said a change was
needed in Sacramento. But he said the
change should come in the type of peo
ple who compose the state assembly. "I
have experience in technology and as an
engineer. My record has been solid in
protecting the environment and solid in
getting things done."
He said he believed someone with his
technological background could more
easily address the problems of solid
waste disposal, nuclear energy and oth
er technological Issues which now con
front the state Legislature.
Despite these overtures, incumbent
Sher stood solidly behind his record. "I
am accessible to the people. And I am
effective. In the last session of the legis
lature, I achieved the highest per
centage of bills passsed of any legislator

in Santa Clara County."
He also quoted a California Journal
article which ranked him with the group
of legislators who, "make jt possible for
the legislature to function as an arena of
compromise, and not the kind of battle
ground it could be."
The debate format included a chance
for the audience to write questions for
the candidates. When asked about
housing, De Sio suggested that more
cooperative housing is needed. "We've
got to force the businessmen and
bankers to make less profit, for patri
otic reasons," he insisted.
Libertarian Fridley took the opposite
road. The 33 year-old electronics tech
nician advocated "A return to the
American tradition of freedom and
property rights." He called Houston
the prime example of a city where less
government intervention in the private
markets has been successful. "We
shouldn't force other people to pay the
costs of parkland."
The mainstream candidates, Sher
and Parkinson, took more moderate
stances. Parkinson called for increases
in housing stock and density, which he
said could be accomplished by building
more multi-unit structures. Sher
blasted this proposal, and suggested
other means for promoting housing.
