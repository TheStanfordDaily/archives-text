# Sher vs. Parkinson
## Race quiet despite divergent viewpoints 
### KEVIN GROSS 
Incumbent California Assemblyman Byron Sher (D-Palo
Alto) and Republican Bill Parkinson, candidates who dis
agree on almost every issue from the state budget to handgun
control, are vying for the right to represent Stanford and the
rest of the 21st District in Sacramento.
In a contest virtually ignored by both the media and the
public, Parkinson, an engineer, is challenging incumbent
Sher, who has been a professor at the Stanford Law School
for the past 25 years.

According to Sher's campaign manager, Kip Lipper,
"Our effort in this campaign is to inform the voters who he is
and what he represents." Similarly, Parkinson noted, "My
campaign has achieved a victory because I have developed
name recognition throughout the district."
Other candidates vying for the seat include slitting ma
chine operator Frank De Sio of the Peace and Freedom par
ty, and electronics technician Russell Fridley, a Libertarian.
One of the factors contributing to the race's low visibility
is the lack of mudslinging in an election year in which many
candidates have gone overboard to disparage their oppo
nents. Moreover, the campaign expenditures have been low:
the candidates in this race are expected to spend less than

$60,000 altogether, when many other candidates are spend
ing more than $100,000 in mailings alone.
Of the many differences between the candidates, Sher said
he felt that the key difference was background. "I've been
around a lot longer than he has, and I have a lot more ex
perience in Sacramento," he said.
Parkinson, on the other hand, said the handling of future
budgeting requirements was the major difference. "I believe
we need to redirect priorities to provide for education by cut
ting welfare."
Sher, too, said he placed education as a top priority; but,
according to Lipper, "he also wants to deliver the services
the public has come to expect."
Sher commented, "I certainly don't favor a general in
crease in taxes . . . We may need a combination of program
cuts and new sources of revenue."
When asked what new sources he would tap, Sher men
tioned an oil severance tax, which "could generate $300 to
$400 million in its first year." He also cited some statistics on
the so-called "sin taxes," suggesting these too could be a
source of increased revenue.
"We're below the national average in cigarette taxes . . .
and wine taxes haven't been increased in 30 years," he said.
Bill Parkinson, however, is opposed to tax increases. He
would like to cut welfare programs by establishing a "work
fare program," where able-bodied adults could perform
