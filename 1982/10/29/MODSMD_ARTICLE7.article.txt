# Royer provides defense for campaign ad tactics

### KATHY CHRISTIE Staff writer 
Repubiican 'candidate for Congress
Bill Royer defended his widely
criticized campaign tactics, saying,
"There were some game rules set in the
first campaign and I'm going to play by
them."
Royer, opposing incumbent Rep.
Tom Lantos (D-San Mateo) for the
llth District seat, spoke last night to a
group of students in Roble Hall in a dis
cussion sponsored by the Roble Politi
cal Action Committee.
When asked to justify a campaign ad
that shows a man resembling opponent
Lantos eating most of a pie with his fin
gers and then belching, Royer replied
by saying/'lt's a whole different world
when you get into a federal election."
He complained that "very few people
have come" to the over 12 debates he
has had with Lantos throughout the
district. Because of this and the lack of
media attention at these debates, Royer

said,"You have to do things that, one,
attract attention and, two, in a very
short period of time you don't have an
opportunity to explain."
"The only question that comes up is
that stinking apple pie, and it bothers
me because basically my campaign has
been very forthright and straight
forward," he said.
Royer said that ads like this were
made to counteract those from Lantos'
campaign, such as one released today
that states Royer gets his money from
"big oil." Of the Royer donors listed by
Lantos in the ad, Royer said, "Four of
them ... I haven't even gotten money
from. As a matter of fact one of them, in
February of this year, gave him $500!"
He said that Lantos raised $2000
from "oil interests" in Oklahoma, a fact
that Royer finds "repulsive" because it
adds to the "90 percent from outside of
the state."
Royer also spoke on the federal
budget, human rights and unemploy

ment.
"There's no way you're going to get a
balanced budget without a constitu
tional amendment," he said, but added:
"A balanced budget by itself is no good
because it's just too easy to increase tax
es and balance the budget."
"Lantos opposes it as some kind of
'Fantasyland', but nevertheless when
he had a chance to vote for the adminis
tration's budget or the Democratic
budget, he voted for the Democratic
