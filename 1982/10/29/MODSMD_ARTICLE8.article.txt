## View from above: a new perspective of the whole Farm 
### JENNIFER ROSEN 
Nervously buckling my seat
belt, I awaited my first time air
borne in a small private plane. As
we started down the runway, I se
riously began to reconsider my
assignment when suddenly we
were in the air. Palo Alto
bloomed into focus below. To my
left I saw the red-tiled roofs of
Stanford campus amid the brown
foothills. All around me lay the
mountains, and straight ahead,
the ocean. Flying at an approx
imate altitude of 3000 feet, I re
alized this was my most unique
perspective of Stanford yet.
Few students realize that the
option to fly is open to them. The
Stanford Flying Club offers op
portunities for students, faculty
and others affiliated with the
University to learn to fly. An in
dependent, nonprofit, organiza
tion, the flying club currently
consists of 250 members.
The club was founded 35 years
ago by a group of Stanford stu
dents who already owned planes.
Originally part of the ASSU, the
club flew where the football field
now stands. Now flying out of
the Palo Alto airport, the club
has the exclusive use of 11 rented
planes. In addition to lessons,
scheduled activities for members
include trips to the San Francisco
International Airport and an Air
Traffic Radar Control Facility.
Although flying certainly is ex
pensive, nonprofit clubs make it
more affordable for students. Be
cause rates are calculated on a

nonprofit basis, the SFC is able
to offer rates of approximately 65
percent that of Bay Area com
mercial flight schools. A solo
license, which permits one to
make local flights, can be ob
tained for less than 5482.
Still sound expensive? To
many student pilots, flying,
either with or without the club, is
worth the money. Although
some students do fly their own
planes, still others find alternate
means of cutting down costs.
Freshman John Wosencraft
joined military flying clubs in
high school because they offered
lower rates.
Still others considered the
practical benefits of flying to off
set the high cost involved. "Ifyou
value time in a monetary way,
then flying becomes much more
affordable," said club flight in
structor Steve Home. Bert Post
ma, the club's general operations
manager, believes that flying is
"within a budget." He even went
so far as to say that frequent long
distance travel can make flying
"cheaper than a car."
However, for most students,
the prime motivation was not the
practicality of flying, but the
sheer joy of it. Admitting that he
"enjoys the hell out of it," Post
ma has been flying since he was
16. He says that flying affords a
"hell of a lot nicer view," and has
always fascinated him.
For Wosencraft, "the thrill of
being in command and in the
air," makes it all worthwhile. He

considers flying to be a sort of
"separate life," in which he is
"free from ail the pressures and
problems of the earth below."
Similarly, Home felt that
flying gave him a "whole new
perspective" on where he lives.
"You can separate youself from
everything while you're up there.
Totally isolated, whatever hap
pens on earth will not affect
you." Home also said he "really
gets a kick out of being a flight in

structor." He feels that his stu
dents' progress is a direct re
flection upon him. "When my
students do well, Heel good. It's
a great feeling to know that my
students can handle situations
and are good pilots."
Is being a good pilot difficult?
Not really. Many students in
terviewed likened flying to driv
ing a car. Wosencraft said, "the
steering wheel is like a car's" and
that "landing is the hardest
part." According to Home,
"once a student develops the new
habit patterns, flying becomes
second nature." Postma agTeed.
saying there has been "no one yet
who couldn't get a iicense."
Some students also considered
flying to be safer than driving a
car. Senior Andy Cargile said he
"felt safer and more confident in
the air because there was so much
more space." None of the stu
dents interviewed felt particular
ly aware of danger while flying.
Although one admitted to having
once landed on the wrong run
way, none had every encountered
any serious difficulties.
Many stuc&nt pilots trace their
interest in flying to relatives who

fly. Cargile, whose grandfather
was a flight instructor, said that
"flying is more or less in my
blood. Ever since I was a little
kid, I remember wondering when
I would be tall enough to reach
the controls."
Home's father was a pilot for
Pan American Airlines. "At age
17, flying was initially ego grat
ifying. I was doing something
that not everyone could do," he
said.
Freshman Neil Roger's father
is also a pilot fora commercial
airline. Rogers, who began flying
last summer, enjoys the power
and isolation involved in flying.
His favorite time to fly is at night..
"It's a real letdown when you
land," he joked.
California, with its generally
good weather, is an ideal state for

flying. Most of the pilots in
terviewed were native Californi
ans, and had taken mainly local
flights. Postma, however, has
flown between the East and West
Coasts several times. Originally
from the Netherlands, Postma
says that the United States is the
least expensive country in which
to fly. According to him, because
everything is subsidized, the pilot
need pay no direct fees for land
ing, or air traffic control services.
Postma, a Stanford graduate,
has a masters in both operations
research and public adminis
tration. He has done some aero
nautical consulting, and current
ly devotes much of his time to
running the SFC. Postma enjoys
both the "utility and the magic"
of flying and says he will definite
ly continue to fly.

All of the students interviewed
see flying as a permanent part of
their future. Although Rogers
and Wosencraft view it mainly as
a hobby, Cargile sees other possi
bilities. He says that if he does
not get into medical school, he
may take a year off, and work as
a commercid pilot, or flight in
structor.
Home, however, would .ealkt
like to become a pilot. Majoring
in economics and international
relations, he stopped out his
sophomore year in order to fly
full-time. Home hopes tc find a
job in which he can "integrate the
business world with flying in
some way." Although he realizes
this may be difficult, he says.
"Flying in some way, whether
paid or not, will always be a part
of my life."

flying gave him a "whole new
perspective" on where he lives.
"You can separate youself from
everything while you're up there.
Totally isolated, whatever hap
pens on earth will not affect
you." Home also said he "really
gets a kick out of being a flight in

structor." He feels that his stu
dents' progress is a direct re
flection upon him. "When my
students do well, Heel good. It's
a great feeling to know that my
students can handle situations
and are good pilots."
Is being a good pilot difficult?
Not really. Many students in
terviewed likened flying to driv
ing a car. Wosencraft said, "the
steering wheel is like a car's" and
that "landing is the hardest
part." According to Home,
"once a student develops the new
habit patterns, flying becomes
second nature." Postma agTeed.
saying there has been "no one yet
who couldn't get a iicense."
Some students also considered
flying to be safer than driving a
car. Senior Andy Cargile said he
"felt safer and more confident in
the air because there was so much
more space." None of the stu
dents interviewed felt particular
ly aware of danger while flying.
Although one admitted to having
once landed on the wrong run
way, none had every encountered
any serious difficulties.
Many stuc&nt pilots trace their
interest in flying to relatives who

fly. Cargile, whose grandfather
was a flight instructor, said that
"flying is more or less in my
blood. Ever since I was a little
kid, I remember wondering when
I would be tall enough to reach
the controls."
Home's father was a pilot for
Pan American Airlines. "At age
17, flying was initially ego grat
ifying. I was doing something
that not everyone could do," he
said.
Freshman Neil Roger's father
is also a pilot fora commercial
airline. Rogers, who began flying
last summer, enjoys the power
and isolation involved in flying.
His favorite time to fly is at night..
"It's a real letdown when you
land," he joked.
California, with its generally
good weather, is an ideal state for

flying. Most of the pilots in
terviewed were native Californi
ans, and had taken mainly local
flights. Postma, however, has
flown between the East and West
Coasts several times. Originally
from the Netherlands, Postma
says that the United States is the
least expensive country in which
to fly. According to him, because
everything is subsidized, the pilot
need pay no direct fees for land
ing, or air traffic control services.
Postma, a Stanford graduate,
has a masters in both operations
research and public adminis
tration. He has done some aero
nautical consulting, and current
ly devotes much of his time to
running the SFC. Postma enjoys
both the "utility and the magic"
of flying and says he will definite
ly continue to fly.

All of the students interviewed
see flying as a permanent part of
their future. Although Rogers
and Wosencraft view it mainly as
a hobby, Cargile sees other possi
bilities. He says that if he does
not get into medical school, he
may take a year off, and work as
a commercid pilot, or flight in
structor.
Home, however, would .ealkt
like to become a pilot. Majoring
in economics and international
relations, he stopped out his
sophomore year in order to fly
full-time. Home hopes tc find a
job in which he can "integrate the
business world with flying in
some way." Although he realizes
this may be difficult, he says.
"Flying in some way, whether
paid or not, will always be a part
of my life."

PANORAMIC VIEW: A small plane offers a spectacular view of the entire campus. The 2SO
members of the Stanford Flying Club can use the club's 11 rented planes flying out of the Palo Alto
Airport in order to see Hoover Tower from the air.
Nervously buckling my seat
belt, I awaited my first time air
borne in a small private plane. As
we started down the runway, I se
riously began to reconsider my
assignment when suddenly we
were in the air. Palo Alto
bloomed into focus below. To my
left I saw the red-tiled roofs of
Stanford campus amid the brown
foothills. All around me lay the
mountains, and straight ahead,
the ocean. Flying at an approx
imate altitude of 3000 feet, I re
alized this was my most unique
perspective of Stanford yet.
Few students realize that the
option to fly is open to them. The
Stanford Flying Club offers op
portunities for students, faculty
and others affiliated with the
University to learn to fly. An in
dependent, nonprofit, organiza
tion, the flying club currently
consists of 250 members.
The club was founded 35 years
ago by a group of Stanford stu
dents who already owned planes.
Originally part of the ASSU, the
club flew where the football field
now stands. Now flying out of
the Palo Alto airport, the club
has the exclusive use of 11 rented
planes. In addition to lessons,
scheduled activities for members
include trips to the San Francisco
International Airport and an Air
Traffic Radar Control Facility.
Although flying certainly is ex
pensive, nonprofit clubs make it
more affordable for students. Be
cause rates are calculated on a

nonprofit basis, the SFC is able
to offer rates of approximately 65
percent that of Bay Area com
mercial flight schools. A solo
license, which permits one to
make local flights, can be ob
tained for less than 5482.
Still sound expensive? To
many student pilots, flying,
either with or without the club, is
worth the money. Although
some students do fly their own
planes, still others find alternate
means of cutting down costs.
Freshman John Wosencraft
joined military flying clubs in
high school because they offered
lower rates.
Still others considered the
practical benefits of flying to off
set the high cost involved. "Ifyou
value time in a monetary way,
then flying becomes much more
affordable," said club flight in
structor Steve Home. Bert Post
ma, the club's general operations
manager, believes that flying is
"within a budget." He even went
so far as to say that frequent long
distance travel can make flying
"cheaper than a car."
However, for most students,
the prime motivation was not the
practicality of flying, but the
sheer joy of it. Admitting that he
"enjoys the hell out of it," Post
ma has been flying since he was
16. He says that flying affords a
"hell of a lot nicer view," and has
always fascinated him.
For Wosencraft, "the thrill of
being in command and in the
air," makes it all worthwhile. He

considers flying to be a sort of
"separate life," in which he is
"free from ail the pressures and
problems of the earth below."
Similarly, Home felt that

and Wosencraft view it mainly as
a hobby, Cargile sees other possi
bilities. He says that if he does
not get into medical school, he
may take a year off, and work as
a commercid pilot, or flight in
structor.
Home, however, would .ealkt
like to become a pilot. Majoring
in economics and international
relations, he stopped out his
sophomore year in order to fly
full-time. Home hopes tc find a
job in which he can "integrate the
business world with flying in
some way." Although he realizes
this may be difficult, he says.
"Flying in some way, whether
paid or not, will always be a part
of my life."


California, with its generally good
weather, is an ideal state
for/lying.

Airport in order to see Hoover Tower from the air.
