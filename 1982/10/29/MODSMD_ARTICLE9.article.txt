# Wine Festival definitely not a sober affair

Are you so bewildered by restaurant wine
lists that you always end up ordering Pepsi?
Are you curious about a particular bottle, but
afraid to ask the waiter about it for fear he
will sniff at your naivete?
If this description fits you more closely
than you would like to admit, you should
have attended the first annual Mac Arthur
Park Wine Festival last Saturday. The event,
which benefited the Stanford Cardinal Club,
featured 100 wines from California's premier
wineries.
The two motives for the Wine Festival, ac
cording to promoter Jane Duff, were to show
the Palo Alto community how much the
Mac Arthur Park restaurant has appreciated
its support and to continue the promotion of
fine California wines. The Cardinal Club,
which raises money for women's athletic
scholarships, seemed to be a very deserving
cause; and with the support of more than 30
of the state's top wineries, the festival prom
ised to be a prestigious event.
It was. The wineries represented at the fes
tival included well-knowns such as Beringer

and Franciscan, but the majority were
smaller and more specialized. Several of them
practiced the so-called "chalet concept,"
which means a concentration on a particular
grape variety or style of wine.

\.. in such a pleasant
setting, with unlimited
tasting of so many
delicious vintages, who
could be humorless?Or
sober?*

Wineries participate in wine tastings like
the one at Mac Arthur Park not only as a
means to further public relations, but also to
keep up with what is going on within the in
dustry itself.

Even with the focus of the festival solely on
the wineries of California, there was an
astonishing variety of wines for the tastir to
experience. From sparkling to still, white to
red, and dry to sweet, it was impossible not to
find particular preferences. The festival of
fered an opportunity to taste and compare
what the smaller premium wineries had to of
fer, and to get some personalized attention
from the winery representatives, who were
very willing to share their knowledge â€” and,
without much prompting, to join the visitors
in a glass.
The festival was characterized by a spirit of
camaraderie. While the representatives and
the tasters at Mac Arthur Park seemed to have
a serious interest in wine, they were not sober
or humorless. The tasting was held on what
fortunately turned out to be a warm, clear af
ternoon; and, in such a pleasant setting, with
unlimited tasting of so many delicious vin
tages, who could be humorless? Or sober?
The Wine Festival was a pleasant way to
quench your thirst, while expanding your
knowledge and educating your palate.
