# Hutchings’ thefts help Card
## 
### DAVE DUTCHER 
Charles Hutchings has a repu
tation for making the big play.
But the Cardinal junior is
quick to add that his brand of
football in the Stanford defensive
secondary is based on consisten
cy.
Hutchings is the starting
strong safety for the Cardinal,
which faces the No. 2 ranked
Washington Huskies today on
national television.
Hutchings acquired the big
play label by coming up with two
interceptions last season. One
was an end zone pickoff against
UCLA and the other in the Big
Game against Cal in the 1981 sea
son's final game at Stanford Sta
dium when Hutchings grabbed a
J. Torchio pass and galloped 14
yards for a touchdown. The score
proved to be the game-winning
touchdown which put the
Cardinal ahead 28-7 enroute to a
42-21 win.
Despite making two clutch
plays, Hutchings saw limited ac
tion overall last season, starting
only the Ohio State game at right
cornerback. He recorded 11
tackles and a pass deflection to
go along with his two intercep
tions. The two thefts were
enough to put Hutchings in a tie
for the team lead in pickoffs at

the end of the season.
"I consider myself more of £
consistent player," Hutchings
said. "They put the big play label
on me, and I try to make the big
play, but I also try to stay consis
tent."
Whether making a key play in
a game or doing his job with regu
larity, Hutchings has done one or
both of the two right.
He leads the Cardinal with
four cases of air piracy against
opposing quarterbacks and has
returned the interceptions for an
average of 13.5 yards.
Hutchings has led the way for
Stanford as the Cardinal has
racked up 15 interceptions to
lead the Pac-10. The pickoffs are
one of the main reasons Stanford
has taken the ball away from its
opponents 12 more times than it
has turned it over.
An economics major,
Hutchings hails from Pinole,
Calif. He was credited with 187
tackles during his prep career and
was named to the All-State and
All-Northern California teams.
Hutchings also made himself
known on the basketball court,
being honored as second team
All-League and Most Valuable
Player.
But it was basketball, not foot
ball, that Hutchings had on his

mind during his four years at
Pinole Valley High School.
"In high school I didn't want
to play football; I wanted to play
* basketball," the Cardinal de
fensive back said. "I had a good
junior year and then a good sen
ior year, and I started getting re
cruited, but I didn't think I was
very good."
Academics played a major role
in Hutchings' decision to attend
Stanford instead of Cal, which is
close to Pinole in the East Bay
Area.
"The reasons I chose Stanford
over Cal were that I felt Stanford
had better academics, and I
wanted to be away from home
but still close enough to be able to
go home when I wanted to."
If interceptions are a means of
comparison, this year's secon
dary has improved vastly since
last season. The Cardinal rec
orded seven pickoffs in .1981 and
has more than doubled that total
with 15 through seven games this
season. Hutchings explained his
theory on the secondary's success
this year.
"We (the defensive backfield)
are a lot quicker this year," he
said. "All the positions are more
experienced and we're coming to
gether as a defense.

for the secondary's improvement this year.
