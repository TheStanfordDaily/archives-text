# Danieli draft reports strive for accuracy

### DAVE DUTCHER 
Those who follow college foot
ball even on a peripheral level
know that Stanford's John Elway
is very likely to be the first player
chosen in the 1983 National
Football League draft.
But after obvious choices such
as Elway, it is not so easy to pre
dict the candidates who will be
tabbed as NFL probables and
hopefuls. And following the
scheduled end of this pro
fessional football season teams,
fans and players alike will try to
figure out which of college foot
ball's elite will be testing their
luck on professional football
gridirons.
Believe it or not, there are peo
ple who try to take the guesswork
out of the draft as a profession.
These draft analyzers spend
hours watching football games
all over the country, both live and
on videotape. Many different
players are scrutinized through
visual and statistical means. The
ultimate goal is to place the coun
try's best college football players
in an order that will come as close
as possible to the actual order in
which players that are picked in
the draft.
One might ask why anyone
would want to speculate how the
draft will proceed. Why not just
"let the chips fall where they
may"?
Professional football teams'
fortunes hinge on the success of
their drafts. Outlooks for seasons
include what quality of players a
team obtained through the draft.

Besides professional teams bene
fiting from research done by
draft report services, any diehard
fan will elaborate on how he sim
ply "has to know" which players
are likely to be chosen when and
how his favorite team might be
looking to improve itself.
One such draft report service is
Danieli Draft Reports. In its
ninth year of compiling draft pre
views and player ratings, the ser
vice was founded by Tony
Danieli.
Danieli began offering the pre
view to subscribers in 1974 and
the idea of providing drafting in
formation to subscribers, which
was a hobby of Danieli's in col
lege, has blossomed since then.
Presently the service's sub
scribers include NFL teams like
San Francisco, New England,
Washington, Buffalo and Dallas,
as well as some Canadian Foot
ball League teams and minor
league teams in Canada and the
United States.
"We sell it to anyone who
wants it," Danieli said. "A lot of
subscribers like knowing who the
top 1000 or 1500 players are."
In Danieli Draft Report's issue
previewing the 1983 draft's first
six rounds, Cardinal quarterback
Elway is projected as the pro's
number one pick. The only other
Stanford player thought to be
chosen in rounds one through six
is tight end Chris Dressel.
In the report there are 168
players listed. Information given
about each player is the probable
position the draftee will play at,

the player's height, weight, 40-
yard dash time, 100-yard dash
time, bench press, school, rating
and pertinent comments about
the player.
The compilation of the data on
each player, though, is more
complex than one would think by
looking at the report.
A questionnaire prepared by
Danieli Draft Reports is sent to
the coach, offensive and de
fensive coordinators and sports
information director of the
school of the players to be
analyzed for the report. On the
questionnaire basic information
that appears on the report, such
as vital statistics, are included
along with inquiries about the
players' performance in practice,
potential, intelligence, agility,
quickness and character. Also in
cluded is additional space to list
any comments or injuries a
player has suffered.
A key element to the success of
the report is all of the question
naires being turned in and on
time. But there is more, accord
ing to Mitch Juricich, who works
for Danieli Draft Reports.
"We send out a separate ques
tionnaire to the kids (players),"
Juricich said. "Those include his
name, school, home and campus
phone, height, weight, 40-yard
dash on pro day (a day set aside
for professional teams to run
tests on prospective pro players),
his best 100-yard dash, his best
bench press and any injuries he's
had. We also ask for his com
ments on playing pro football,

additional comments and the
best time to call him for addi
tional information."
From here, all the data
gathered is fed into a computer.
But Juricich emphasized that the
information used to rank the
players is not acquired solely
from the questionnaires.
"It's also what we see with our
eyes," Juricich said. "You can't
look inside someone and see
what's inside their hearts. It's
tough to scout just by stats."
Juricich added that a majority
of the emphasis placed on rating
is based on what the reviewers ac
tually see through watching
games.
The latest report, which was
compiled after the weekend Stan
ford beat Oregon State 45-5,
showed Elway as the pick of the

drafting crop. Juricich said that
since then the order of players
has not changed too drastically.
"Elway is the best football
player I've ever seen," Juricich
said simply. "He is what ev
erybody says he is, and unless he
gets hurt, he will be the number
one pick."
As for the organization's suc
cess, Juricich had an example.
"We knew Renaldo Nehemiah
as a senior in college, and we
projected him as around the for
ty-fifth best wide receiver. We
were the only draft report that I
saw to pick him."
Nehemiah, a world record
holder in the 110 meter hurdle
event, forfeited his amateur sta
tus and was signed by San Fran
cisco prior to this season.

league teams in Canada and the
United States.
"We sell it to anyone who
wants it," Danieli said. "A lot of
subscribers like knowing who the
top 1000 or 1500 players are."
In Danieli Draft Report's issue
previewing the 1983 draft's first
six rounds, Cardinal quarterback
Elway is projected as the pro's
number one pick. The only other
Stanford player thought to be
chosen in rounds one through six
is tight end Chris Dressel.
In the report there are 168
players listed. Information given
about each player is the probable
position the draftee will play at,

the player's height, weight, 40-
yard dash time, 100-yard dash
time, bench press, school, rating
and pertinent comments about
the player.
The compilation of the data on
each player, though, is more
complex than one would think by
looking at the report.
A questionnaire prepared by
Danieli Draft Reports is sent to
the coach, offensive and de
fensive coordinators and sports
information director of the
school of the players to be
analyzed for the report. On the
questionnaire basic information
that appears on the report, such
as vital statistics, are included
along with inquiries about the
players' performance in practice,
potential, intelligence, agility,
quickness and character. Also in
cluded is additional space to list
any comments or injuries a
player has suffered.
A key element to the success of
the report is all of the question
naires being turned in and on
time. But there is more, accord
ing to Mitch Juricich, who works
for Danieli Draft Reports.
"We send out a separate ques
tionnaire to the kids (players),"
Juricich said. "Those include his
name, school, home and campus
phone, height, weight, 40-yard
dash on pro day (a day set aside
for professional teams to run
tests on prospective pro players),
his best 100-yard dash, his best
bench press and any injuries he's
had. We also ask for his com
ments on playing pro football,

additional comments and the
best time to call him for addi
tional information."
From here, all the data
gathered is fed into a computer.
But Juricich emphasized that the
information used to rank the
players is not acquired solely
from the questionnaires.
"It's also what we see with our
eyes," Juricich said. "You can't
look inside someone and see
what's inside their hearts. It's
tough to scout just by stats."
Juricich added that a majority
of the emphasis placed on rating
is based on what the reviewers ac
tually see through watching
games.
The latest report, which was
compiled after the weekend Stan
ford beat Oregon State 45-5,
showed Elway as the pick of the

drafting crop. Juricich said that
since then the order of players
has not changed too drastically.
"Elway is the best football
player I've ever seen," Juricich
said simply. "He is what ev
erybody says he is, and unless he
gets hurt, he will be the number
one pick."
As for the organization's suc
cess, Juricich had an example.
"We knew Renaldo Nehemiah
as a senior in college, and we
projected him as around the for
ty-fifth best wide receiver. We
were the only draft report that I
saw to pick him."
Nehemiah, a world record
holder in the 110 meter hurdle
event, forfeited his amateur sta
tus and was signed by San Fran
cisco prior to this season.
Those who follow college foot
ball even on a peripheral level
know that Stanford's John Elway
is very likely to be the first player
chosen in the 1983 National
Football League draft.
But after obvious choices such
as Elway, it is not so easy to pre
dict the candidates who will be
tabbed as NFL probables and
hopefuls. And following the
scheduled end of this pro
fessional football season teams,
fans and players alike will try to
figure out which of college foot
ball's elite will be testing their
luck on professional football
gridirons.
Believe it or not, there are peo
ple who try to take the guesswork
out of the draft as a profession.
These draft analyzers spend
hours watching football games
all over the country, both live and
on videotape. Many different
players are scrutinized through
visual and statistical means. The
ultimate goal is to place the coun
try's best college football players
in an order that will come as close
as possible to the actual order in
which players that are picked in
the draft.
One might ask why anyone
would want to speculate how the
draft will proceed. Why not just
"let the chips fall where they
may"?
Professional football teams'
fortunes hinge on the success of
their drafts. Outlooks for seasons
include what quality of players a
team obtained through the draft.

Besides professional teams bene
fiting from research done by
draft report services, any diehard
fan will elaborate on how he sim
ply "has to know" which players
are likely to be chosen when and
how his favorite team might be
looking to improve itself.
One such draft report service is
Danieli Draft Reports. In its
ninth year of compiling draft pre
views and player ratings, the ser
vice was founded by Tony
Danieli.
Danieli began offering the pre
view to subscribers in 1974 and
the idea of providing drafting in
formation to subscribers, which
was a hobby of Danieli's in col
lege, has blossomed since then.
Presently the service's sub
scribers include NFL teams like
San Francisco, New England,
Washington, Buffalo and Dallas,
as well as some Canadian Foot
ball League teams and minor
league teams in Canada and the
United States.
