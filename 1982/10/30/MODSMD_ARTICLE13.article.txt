# Card backs push through against WSU
## 
### DAVE DUTCHER 
For those who wondered, with
the presence of quarterback John
Elway and his aerial attack, if the
Stanford Cardinal had a running
game, their questions were an
swered last Saturday against
Washington State.
The Cardinal, in posting a
31-26 Pac-10 win over the
Cougars, compiled 381 yards to
tal offense. That is not a surpris
ing statistic but 246 of those
yards were on the ground.
Where?
That's right, on the ground.

Stanford threw the ball for 85
yards on the day, advancing the
ball successfully against a Wash
ington State defense designed to
stop the pass while giving up a
running game.
So the Cardinal took what was
given, according to Stanford run
ning back coach Jim Anderson.
"We always go into a game
with the plan of being successful
with the run," Anderson said.
"They (Washington State) gave it
to us and we took it. They rushed
four and dropped the other seven
back."

While Anderson is not antici
pating Washington will give
Stanford anything it does not
earn, he emphasized the produc
tive passing game Cardinal fans
are enjoying owes at least part of
its success to the often-over
looked running game.
"When you throw a lot, people
will say.you didn't run to keep the
defense off balance and when you
run a lot they'll ask why you ran
when you have Elway," An
derson stated. "It's tough to
please everyone but to effectively
pass we have to run the ball."

Producing yards on the ground
was what was effective Saturday
against the Cougars. The benefi
ciary of Washington State's pass
conscious defense and the Stan
ford decision to take what it was
given was senior halfback Mike
Dotterer.
Dotterer rushed for 155 yards
and three touchdowns against
the Cougars, whose defense was
undermanned due to injuries.
Dotterer scored the final
Cardinal touchdown with 22 sec
onds left in the game. The drive
that led the the final score was
spearheaded by Dotterer's runs
of 11, 11 and nine yards.
"The only game I ran with con
sistency was the Washington
State game," Dotterer said
Thursday. "We're predominant
ly a passing club. Going into the
game, the coaches mentioned we
would run more and I was for
tunate to get the opportunity.
Vincent (starting halfback
White) was injured, the line did a
great job and we were able to get
a lot of yards on the ground."
Dotterer, who along with pre
paring for the 7-0 (4-0 in the
Pac-10) Huskies, was in the proc
ess of applying for a Rhodes
scholarship, sees the game with
the defending conference cham
pions as a big one in his career on
The Farm.
"This game is important be
cause of the national television
coverage," Dotterer said. "Most
of the bowl committees will be
watching it and if we win we'll be
5-3 and we would have a good
chance at going to a bowl game.
What it boils down to is if this
team wants to go to a bowl
game."
The hope of playing in a bowl
game was one of the reasons Dot
terer did not sign a professional
baseball contract with the Oak
land A's after being drafted by
the club. "I wanted to graduate
from Stanford and signing would
have meant two or three more
years before I would finish my

degree," he said. "I've always
wanted to play in a bowl game.
When we came in as freshmen
Stanford had played in two bowl
games in a row and set a prece
dent for schools combining aca
demics and athletics."
Dotterer and Anderson agree
that in order to pass, a team has
to run the ball well. Dotterer
said, "We have to have the
capability of running the ball. If a
team doesn't respect your ability
to run, they'll drop back seven or
eight guys and it's tough for the
quarterback - especially if they're
putting on a good pass rush."
Anderson said the game plan
from the running attack's stand
point revolves around "staying
on schedule."
Despite last week's success
with the ground game, the
Cardinal is sticking to the of
fensive philosophy that gives pri
mary consideration to the pass.
"The run was good to us last
week but we can't fool ourselves
into thinking we can run like that
every week," Anderson said.
"We're not a USC. The run is
secondary to us."
Stanford has rushed for 677
yards this season. But that figure
looks small when compared to
the 2095 yards the passing attack
has compiled. The Cardinal aver
ages 96.7 yards per game rushing
and 299.2 through the air.
Dotterer, who came out of
Huntington Beach's Edison High
School as a wide receiver, was
placed at halfback his freshman
and sophomore years. It was
against Washington his
sophomore year he dislocated his
shoulder. Dotterer's junior sea
son was spent at fullback before
moving back to halfback for the
1982 campaign.
"Today's game against Wash
ington is the biggest challenge of
my career at Stanford. You can
bet your bottom dollar I'll be
there to play."

baseball contract with the Oak
land A's after being drafted by
the club. "I wanted to graduate
from Stanford and signing would
have meant two or three more
years before I would finish my

degree," he said. "I've always
wanted to play in a bowl game.
When we came in as freshmen
Stanford had played in two bowl
games in a row and set a prece
dent for schools combining aca
demics and athletics."
Dotterer and Anderson agree
that in order to pass, a team has
to run the ball well. Dotterer
said, "We have to have the
capability of running the ball. If a
team doesn't respect your ability
to run, they'll drop back seven or
eight guys and it's tough for the
quarterback - especially if they're
putting on a good pass rush."
Anderson said the game plan
from the running attack's stand
point revolves around "staying
on schedule."
Despite last week's success
with the ground game, the
Cardinal is sticking to the of
fensive philosophy that gives pri
mary consideration to the pass.
"The run was good to us last
week but we can't fool ourselves
into thinking we can run like that
every week," Anderson said.
"We're not a USC. The run is
secondary to us."
Stanford has rushed for 677
yards this season. But that figure
looks small when compared to
the 2095 yards the passing attack
has compiled. The Cardinal aver
ages 96.7 yards per game rushing
and 299.2 through the air.
Dotterer, who came out of
Huntington Beach's Edison High
School as a wide receiver, was
placed at halfback his freshman
and sophomore years. It was
against Washington his
sophomore year he dislocated his
shoulder. Dotterer's junior sea
son was spent at fullback before
moving back to halfback for the
1982 campaign.
"Today's game against Wash
ington is the biggest challenge of
my career at Stanford. You can
bet your bottom dollar I'll be
there to play."

scoring a touchdown earlier this year. Altough White has been hurt in recent weeks, Mike Dotterer
filled the slack last week by rushing for 155 yards.
For those who wondered, with
the presence of quarterback John
Elway and his aerial attack, if the
Stanford Cardinal had a running
game, their questions were an
swered last Saturday against
Washington State.
The Cardinal, in posting a
31-26 Pac-10 win over the
Cougars, compiled 381 yards to
tal offense. That is not a surpris
ing statistic but 246 of those
yards were on the ground.
Where?
That's right, on the ground.

Stanford threw the ball for 85
yards on the day, advancing the
ball successfully against a Wash
ington State defense designed to
stop the pass while giving up a
running game.
So the Cardinal took what was
given, according to Stanford run
ning back coach Jim Anderson.
"We always go into a game
with the plan of being successful
with the run," Anderson said.
"They (Washington State) gave it
to us and we took it. They rushed
four and dropped the other seven
back."

While Anderson is not antici
pating Washington will give
Stanford anything it does not
earn, he emphasized the produc
tive passing game Cardinal fans
are enjoying owes at least part of
its success to the often-over
looked running game.
"When you throw a lot, people
will say.you didn't run to keep the
defense off balance and when you
run a lot they'll ask why you ran
when you have Elway," An
derson stated. "It's tough to
please everyone but to effectively
pass we have to run the ball."

Producing yards on the ground
was what was effective Saturday
against the Cougars. The benefi
ciary of Washington State's pass
conscious defense and the Stan
ford decision to take what it was
given was senior halfback Mike
Dotterer.
Dotterer rushed for 155 yards
and three touchdowns against
the Cougars, whose defense was
undermanned due to injuries.
Dotterer scored the final
Cardinal touchdown with 22 sec
onds left in the game. The drive
that led the the final score was
spearheaded by Dotterer's runs
of 11, 11 and nine yards.
"The only game I ran with con
sistency was the Washington
State game," Dotterer said
Thursday. "We're predominant
ly a passing club. Going into the
game, the coaches mentioned we
would run more and I was for
tunate to get the opportunity.
Vincent (starting halfback
White) was injured, the line did a
great job and we were able to get
a lot of yards on the ground."
Dotterer, who along with pre
paring for the 7-0 (4-0 in the
Pac-10) Huskies, was in the proc
ess of applying for a Rhodes
scholarship, sees the game with
the defending conference cham
pions as a big one in his career on
The Farm.
"This game is important be
cause of the national television
coverage," Dotterer said. "Most
of the bowl committees will be
watching it and if we win we'll be
5-3 and we would have a good
chance at going to a bowl game.
What it boils down to is if this
team wants to go to a bowl
game."
The hope of playing in a bowl
game was one of the reasons Dot
terer did not sign a professional
baseball contract with the Oak
