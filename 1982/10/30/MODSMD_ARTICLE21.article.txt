# Stanford alum makes cookies a habit at game
## 
### BETH KLEID 
For Stanford alumna Marcia
Hadeler, owner of the Cookie
Habit, making and selling
cookies is not only a habit, but a
very profitable business. The ob
servant Cardinal fan may have
noticed Hadeler's Cookie Habit
concession stands around the sta
dium at football games; the even
more observant fan may have no
ticed that the cookie stands are
the only concession stands to be
found.
How did a 25-year old cookie
store owner obtain the right to
run the only concession stands at
Stanford football games? It was
all a matter of having connec
tions.
"One of my classmates from
Stanford knew Jose Plancencia,
who is in charge of concessions,
and she told him about our
cookies. Jose tried us out at the
Concorde de Elegance, which is a
Cardinal Club function. Then he
gave us the concessions contract
for the stadium," said Hadeler,
"and we have been very suc

cessful so far."
Hadeler and her sister Mario
Wesavialle opened the Cookie
Habit at the Stanford Shpping
Center in 1979. "Mario came up
with the idea. We proposed it in
1977, and it was accepted two
years later. We started breaking
even the first day we opened the
doors!" recalled Hadeler.
When they were growing up,
Hadeler and Wesavialle baked
cookies constantly. "I went to an
all girls school, and all we did was
eat," Hadler said. "I loved to
bake. When I was 13-years old, I
asked my dad for a bakery. I
guess I had to wait until now to
get one."
The response to the Cookie
Habit's concession stands has
been extremely positive accord
ing to Hadeler. The cookie carts
help to advertise for the main
store. "On Sundays after Satur
day football games our store is
booming, and Sunday used to be
an easy day to work."
Among the numerous taste
treats sold by the Cookie Habit

are chocolate chip cookies with
or without nuts, oatmeal raisins,
peanut butter shortbread and
brownies. "I'd say that the choc
olate chip without nuts is the
most popular cookie. The
brownies go quickly, too," noted
Hadeler. "People usually stick
with the tried and true cookie; a
lot of people aren't adventerous
enough with cookie choices."
Those who do go beyond the
ordinary chocolate chip cookies
find that trying new versions can
be contagious. Hadeler remem
bered one Stanford student who
bought a shortbread cookie dur
ing a game. Soon after he came
back to buy two kinds of choco
late chip cookies. Later he re
turned to buy brownies and more
shortbread."He swore that he
was sharing them," said Hadeler,
"but I don't think so."
Hadeler reported that once a
customer catches the cookie hab
it, it is hard to break. Hadeler has
out-of-state customers who have
had her cookes at the stadium
and then .went to the store to

stock up on them before return
ing gome. Once home, the vis
itors phone in orders, and she
sends them her goodies.
The recipes used at the Cookie
Habit come from a variety of
sources. Contributers include the
grandmother of one of Hadeler's
friends, her old boyfriend's
mother and a high school pal.
When Hadeler feels like making a
new cookie, she begins to experi
ment. "Some recipes I just make
up. I add a little bit of this and
take away | a little bit of that."
According to Hadeler, selling
cookies can be a lot of fun. "One
day a woman came up to our
stand and bought everything in

it. It was a big sale; there must
have been thirty brownies and
four dozen cookies in the cart.
She bought us out!
"She probably had a tailgater
and forgot to bring dessert. It was
really funny," recalled Hadeler.
Hadeler and Wesavialle hope
to open another store by next
year. "There are many cookie
stores around, but we feel that
our store is doing well enough to
open up another," said Hadeler.
If the American passion for
eating cookies continues, more
and more fans will probably de
velop a habit for Hadeler's
cookies.
