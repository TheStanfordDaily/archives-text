. . he has become one of the House's most eloquent
spokesman for American goals and ideals.

DESPITE WHAT you may read or
hear about those big bucks paying
for all those cheap-shot television
commercials, the candidates for the 11th
Congressional District seat actually bring
strong credentials to'the race.
While we deplore the low level of cam
paigning and the enormous sums being
raised and spent, there are more im
portant considerations in deciding each
candidate's merits. In their congressman
voters have their most direct pipeline to
Washington, and this year they will have
a: clear choice in stating their reaction to
the first two years of the Reagan admin
istration.
Royer, 62, is the former Redwood City
planning commissioner, city councilman
and San Mateo County supervisor who
was elected to Congress in 1979 after
fcep. Leo Ryan's death in Guyana.
Lantos, 54, an economist and educator,
Unseated him two years ago.
Because Royer has spent the cam
paign defending Reagan's economic poli
cies, the election has become something
of a referendum. Reaganomics asks us to
bverlook the contradiction in the theory
that lower taxes and higher defense
spending can balance the budget and
strengthen the economy. Americans put
iheir trust in that theory two years ago,
but the results thus far are discouraging.
Despite the president's remarkable
ability to get Congress to agree to his aus
tere budget and tax cuts, this deep re
cession persists. Inflation and interest
rates are down, but the nation is paying
the price with a weakened economy.
Growth indicators have slowed, and un
employment and business failures are'
dramatically higher.
Royer is convinced the nation is on the
somewhat painful road to recovery; he
would have us, as the Republican Nation
al Committee urges, "stay the course "
Lantos, however, calls for a "mid-course
correction" before the economy further
deteriorates.

Lantos also sounds two themes that
offer important alternatives to the Rea
gan plan. The first is a re-emphasis on
domestic policy that will rebuild Ameri
ca's middle class, especially in housing
and education. He worked hard for a bill
last summer that would have subsidized
the interest rates of certain middle-in
come homebuyers (Reagan vetoed the
bill). The second theme is his recogni
tion of an emerging bipartisan force in
Congress that can forge more moderate
economic strategies than Reagan's with
out provoking a party showdown on
every vote. With Democrats strengthen
ing their hold on Congress and possibly
regaining a Senate majority this year,
that attitude will be essential to legisla
tive progress in the next two years.
Royer is a sincere challenger who
knows San Mateo County as well as any
politician on the Peninsula, and he
knows his way around Congress. But
Lantos has served the district with dis
tinction in his first term. Among his
many achievements, he followed
through on the appropriation for the
badly-needed construction of the Bay
shore Freeway-Highway 92 interchange,
and through his work on the Foreign Af
fairs Committee he has become one of
the House's most eloquent spokesmen
for American goals and ideals. Royer has
tried throughout the campaign to attack
Lantos' record, but each new shot has
missed the mark.
In some ways it's a shame we can't
recommend both men for congressional
seats. But Lantos has brought an unusual
combination of foreign-policy idealism
and economic and political realism
especially in his perception of economic
problems to his first term in office. He
has earned the chance to continue to rep
resent the 11th District.
And with Royer's record of recent
achievement with the Department of
Transportation and his zeal for govern
mental efficiency, he would be an asset
again in the Reagan administration
