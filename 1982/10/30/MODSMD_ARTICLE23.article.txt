# Williams makes happy returns for Cardinal
## 
### STEPHEN STRENG 
Imagine this: you're standing
all alone in a big field looking up
in the air trying to spot a speck of
leather that some European soc
cer player just kicked to you.
Now, you have two problems:
first, you have to catch it as it
goes through re- entry. Second,
you have to run it down the field
while eleven 6-foot-3, 225 pound
escapees from the local asylum
run full speed down the field
straight at you. Now you know
what it's like to be a major college
kick-off returner.
Kenny Williams, a 6-2, 186
pound wide receiver, is the Stan
ford Cardinal's kick-off returner.
And he is only a freshman. Wil
liams had been starting on the
kick-off team since the start of
the season but at the wing posi
tion, not as a deep back. With the
injury of starting deep back Mike
Dotterer during the San Jose
State game, Williams got his
chance to return. He posted a 47-
yard run back on his only catch
of the day.
The coaching staff was so
pleased with William's per
formance that he has been start
ing ever since. Presently, Wil
liams is averaging 25.9 yards per
return on 12 catches totaling 311
yards. William's longest came in

the USC game in which, after
fumbling the catch, he raced
down the field for a 69-yard gain.
Williams, who went to San
Jose's Mt. Pleasant High School,
was a first team All-NorCal de
fensive back and a first team All-
Central Coast Section wide re
ciever. While in high school, Wil
liams also returned kick-offs,
posting touchdown returns of 85
and 95 yards last fall. As Wil
liams says, however, "In high
school it was 'alright Kenny, go
back there and catch the ball and
run.' "
Williams ability to run and
catch the ball got him recruited
by almost every major football
team in the country including all
the Pac-10 teams, Michigan and
Oklahoma.
When asked what made him
choose Stanford, Williams said
flatly,"academics." Right now
Williams is thinking of majoring
in economics, but he said, "I
think I might change to com
munications."
Also playing a major factor in
William's decision to attend
Stanford was its proximity to his
home and family. "That had a
big thing to do with it," Williams
said. "I had a feeling that I might
sign to play baseball so being
away for a whole year, well, real

ly four years constantly, that
didn't sit to well with me."
The baseball that Williams is
talking about is minor league
- baseball with the Chicago White
Sox. Williams signed a contract
out of high school with the White
Sox and played for Sarasota in
the Rookie League this past sum
mer.
"It's an experience, " said Wil
liams, "It's not easy. It's a totally
different atmosphere, but I
wouldn't trade it."
Along with his baseball skills
Williams is also one of the fastest
members of the Stanford football
team, having run a 9.4 second 100
yard dash this spring in high
school with no track practice.
It was this display of skills that
prompted Stanford head coach
Paul Wiggin to comment, "Ken
ny is projected to be one of the
great modern day athletes. He
could be the premier high school
wide reciever in the nation, the
premier baseball player in the na
tion, and a 10.4 sprinter in track.
He's got a little Danny Ainge in
him."
Off the field Williams is an af
fable, articulate, motivated
young man trying to adjust to his
new surroundings as a freshman
at Stanford. "I expect things out
of myself," Williams said.

"When I do something, it's 'OK,
you did it, but your supposed to
do it.' "
When the season is over Wil
liams plans to hit the books. "Af
ter this is over, I'm going to have
to buckle down. This is a tough
school." As for fitting in at Stan
ford, Williams said, "Adjusting,
it's not a problem, at least foot
ball isn't. It's just adjusting to
school."
However, Williams admitted
that there was one small thing to
get used to catching for Stan
ford's John Elway. "It took me

long time to get used to the fact
that this guy is human, too," said
Williams. "I'd be so worried
about running the right pattern,
and then I'd have to turn around
and look and say 'God, now I
have to catch the ball.'
"He puts it on the money, but
whoosh it's there."
Williams is hopeful that Wash
ington will only see him as a blur
this weekend. "I definitely think
we can beat them," he predicted.
But for that fortune to come
true, a lot could depend on the
lonely freshman standing at the
end of the big open field.

ball isn't. It's just adjusting to
school."
However, Williams admitted
that there was one small thing to
get used to catching for Stan
ford's John Elway. "It took me

long time to get used to the fact
that this guy is human, too," said
Williams. "I'd be so worried
about running the right pattern,
and then I'd have to turn around
and look and say 'God, now I
have to catch the ball.'
"He puts it on the money, but
whoosh it's there."
Williams is hopeful that Wash
ington will only see him as a blur
this weekend. "I definitely think
we can beat them," he predicted.
But for that fortune to come
true, a lot could depend on the
lonely freshman standing at the
end of the big open field.

AS FAST AS MERCURY: Stanford receiever Kenny Williams
might not have winged sandles, but he runs as though he does. A
9.4 sprinter, Williams earned the starting kickoff returners spot
in the San Jose State football game and has been successfully
returning kicks ever since.
Imagine this: you're standing
all alone in a big field looking up
in the air trying to spot a speck of
leather that some European soc
cer player just kicked to you.
Now, you have two problems:
first, you have to catch it as it
goes through re- entry. Second,
you have to run it down the field
while eleven 6-foot-3, 225 pound
escapees from the local asylum
run full speed down the field
straight at you. Now you know
what it's like to be a major college
kick-off returner.
Kenny Williams, a 6-2, 186
pound wide receiver, is the Stan
ford Cardinal's kick-off returner.
And he is only a freshman. Wil
liams had been starting on the
kick-off team since the start of
the season but at the wing posi
tion, not as a deep back. With the
injury of starting deep back Mike
Dotterer during the San Jose
State game, Williams got his
chance to return. He posted a 47-
yard run back on his only catch
of the day.
The coaching staff was so
pleased with William's per
formance that he has been start
ing ever since. Presently, Wil
liams is averaging 25.9 yards per
return on 12 catches totaling 311
yards. William's longest came in

the USC game in which, after
fumbling the catch, he raced
down the field for a 69-yard gain.
Williams, who went to San
Jose's Mt. Pleasant High School,
was a first team All-NorCal de
fensive back and a first team All-
Central Coast Section wide re
ciever. While in high school, Wil
liams also returned kick-offs,
posting touchdown returns of 85
and 95 yards last fall. As Wil
liams says, however, "In high
school it was 'alright Kenny, go
back there and catch the ball and
run.' "
Williams ability to run and
catch the ball got him recruited
by almost every major football
team in the country including all
the Pac-10 teams, Michigan and
Oklahoma.
When asked what made him
choose Stanford, Williams said
flatly,"academics." Right now
Williams is thinking of majoring
in economics, but he said, "I
think I might change to com
munications."
Also playing a major factor in
William's decision to attend
Stanford was its proximity to his
home and family. "That had a
big thing to do with it," Williams
said. "I had a feeling that I might
sign to play baseball so being
away for a whole year, well, real

ly four years constantly, that
didn't sit to well with me."
The baseball that Williams is
talking about is minor league
- baseball with the Chicago White
Sox. Williams signed a contract
out of high school with the White
Sox and played for Sarasota in
the Rookie League this past sum
mer.
"It's an experience, " said Wil
liams, "It's not easy. It's a totally
different atmosphere, but I
wouldn't trade it."
Along with his baseball skills
Williams is also one of the fastest
members of the Stanford football
team, having run a 9.4 second 100
yard dash this spring in high
school with no track practice.
It was this display of skills that
prompted Stanford head coach
Paul Wiggin to comment, "Ken
ny is projected to be one of the
great modern day athletes. He
could be the premier high school
wide reciever in the nation, the
premier baseball player in the na
tion, and a 10.4 sprinter in track.
He's got a little Danny Ainge in
him."
Off the field Williams is an af
fable, articulate, motivated
young man trying to adjust to his
new surroundings as a freshman
at Stanford. "I expect things out
of myself," Williams said.

"When I do something, it's 'OK,
you did it, but your supposed to
do it.' "
When the season is over Wil
liams plans to hit the books. "Af
ter this is over, I'm going to have
to buckle down. This is a tough
school." As for fitting in at Stan
ford, Williams said, "Adjusting,
it's not a problem, at least foot
ball isn't. It's just adjusting to
school."
However, Williams admitted
that there was one small thing to
