# Harmon leads by example
## 
### JOHN CALLON 
Kickers are often regarded as a
foreign element in a bigger-is
better world, an extraneous enti
ty tacked onto the All-American
organism known as football. But
junior placekicker Mark Har
mon has managed to avoid the
"exclusion principle" through
his fierce competitiveness, lead
ership qualities and exceptional
physical ability.
Harmon is well on his way to a
superb career at Stanford. He
now stands at an amazing 55 con
secutive PAT's stretching back
into last year, having easily sur
passed the old mark of 31 in the
opener against Purdue. Mark has
gotten to this point rather quiet
ly, and feels uncomfortable dis
cussing the potential for extend
ing the string of extra points in
definitely.
His field-goal kicking hasn't
been as consistent statistically,
but it is not any less impressive.
Seven-of-11 on the year, includ
ing a perfect four-for-four from
the 40-49 yard range, it has re
covered from a less than spec
tacular start to live up to Head
Coach Paul Wiggins' decision to
submit Mark for "All-Star con
sideration prior to the season."
Harmon relates, "At the start of
the season, we (Harmon and

holder Steve Cottrell) had a few
troubles coordinating things. But
I think Steve is the best holder
anybody could have, and Mike
(Teeuws) is a great snapper, and
now everything is starting to
come together."
So together, in fact, that Wig
gin elected to send Mark in for a
64-yard attempt against Wash
ington State last week. The kick
fell just short, but it wasn't be
cause of a lack of power. "I was
pretty anxious, and I thought I
could do it. I've had a tendency to
over swing lately, so I just tried
for a smooth stroke. After I
kicked it, I knew I should have
kicked it harder.
Wiggin is not the only one with
confidence in Harmon. He is
showered with confidence from
all sides, and he is in every respect
worthy of that faith. He can kick,
but what is especially remarkable
about Mark Harmon is the fact
that he contributes more than
just his right foot.
"He's got personality the
players relate to him as both a
person and a competitor," Paul
Wiggin said about Harmon.
The "exclusion principle" is
something that Harmon has cer
tainly overcome, and in fact he
has never really been confronted
with it. "My brother is on Wash
ington State's team, and I guess
the kickers there are regarded as
different," he said. "They're not
part of the team. I've never really
made a conscious effort. The
players I've played with don't
treat players like that. I've heard

that up in the pros, they classify
you as a kicker, and you never
cross over the line. But I feel like
I'm part of the team. I am part of
the team."
* His infectious optimism ac
counts largely for the respect giv
en him by his teammates. It's not
that he's loud. He inspires
positive thinking through his
own,' quiet methods. "I'm not the
rah-rah type of leader who gets
up in front and talks to ev
erybody," Harmon explains.
"I'm only a junior, so it's not re
ally my place anyway. I try to be
more of a field leader."
Mark's keen competitive spirit
is an important element of that
confidence and is key to his con
tinual improvement. "I like com
peting," he acknowledges.
"When you earn the job, it makes
you feel so much better. My
freshman year, Ken Naber was
the kicker, and every day was a
tryout for Saturday. That really
helps me."
Pushing towards new goals is
something that Mark Harmon is
all about, and he has a few defi
nite ideas on what he would like
to accomplish. Being the best in
the nation is a definite priority,
and a few more records would
not be altogether disagreeable.
"I'd like to know how far I can
go. I like to think that I'll be able
to kick 70 yards. But my number
one goal right now is to help the
team get to a bowl game. I'd give
up 150 PATs for that."
That's 150 consecutive PATs.

is not so bad either. He has kicked seven-of-11 field goals

more of a field leader."
Mark's keen competitive spirit
is an important element of that
confidence and is key to his con
tinual improvement. "I like com
peting," he acknowledges.
"When you earn the job, it makes
you feel so much better. My
freshman year, Ken Naber was
the kicker, and every day was a
tryout for Saturday. That really
helps me."
Pushing towards new goals is
something that Mark Harmon is
all about, and he has a few defi
nite ideas on what he would like
to accomplish. Being the best in
the nation is a definite priority,
and a few more records would
not be altogether disagreeable.
"I'd like to know how far I can
go. I like to think that I'll be able
to kick 70 yards. But my number
one goal right now is to help the
team get to a bowl game. I'd give
up 150 PATs for that."
That's 150 consecutive PATs.

A KICKING MACHINE: While Washington's field goal
kicker Chuck Nelson gets all the press, Stanford's Mark Harmon
is not so bad either. He has kicked seven-of-11 field goals
and has connected on all 25 extra points.
Kickers are often regarded as a
foreign element in a bigger-is
better world, an extraneous enti
ty tacked onto the All-American
organism known as football. But
junior placekicker Mark Har
mon has managed to avoid the
"exclusion principle" through
his fierce competitiveness, lead
ership qualities and exceptional
physical ability.
Harmon is well on his way to a
superb career at Stanford. He
now stands at an amazing 55 con
secutive PAT's stretching back
into last year, having easily sur
passed the old mark of 31 in the
opener against Purdue. Mark has
gotten to this point rather quiet
ly, and feels uncomfortable dis
cussing the potential for extend
ing the string of extra points in
definitely.
His field-goal kicking hasn't
been as consistent statistically,
but it is not any less impressive.
Seven-of-11 on the year, includ
ing a perfect four-for-four from
the 40-49 yard range, it has re
covered from a less than spec
tacular start to live up to Head
Coach Paul Wiggins' decision to
submit Mark for "All-Star con
sideration prior to the season."
Harmon relates, "At the start of
the season, we (Harmon and

holder Steve Cottrell) had a few
troubles coordinating things. But
I think Steve is the best holder
anybody could have, and Mike
(Teeuws) is a great snapper, and
now everything is starting to
come together."
So together, in fact, that Wig
gin elected to send Mark in for a
64-yard attempt against Wash
ington State last week. The kick
fell just short, but it wasn't be
cause of a lack of power. "I was
pretty anxious, and I thought I
could do it. I've had a tendency to
over swing lately, so I just tried
for a smooth stroke. After I
kicked it, I knew I should have
kicked it harder.
Wiggin is not the only one with
confidence in Harmon. He is
showered with confidence from
all sides, and he is in every respect
worthy of that faith. He can kick,
but what is especially remarkable
about Mark Harmon is the fact
that he contributes more than
just his right foot.
"He's got personality the
players relate to him as both a
person and a competitor," Paul
Wiggin said about Harmon.
The "exclusion principle" is
something that Harmon has cer
tainly overcome, and in fact he
has never really been confronted
with it. "My brother is on Wash
ington State's team, and I guess
the kickers there are regarded as
different," he said. "They're not
part of the team. I've never really
made a conscious effort. The
players I've played with don't
treat players like that. I've heard

that up in the pros, they classify
you as a kicker, and you never
cross over the line. But I feel like
I'm part of the team. I am part of
the team."
* His infectious optimism ac
counts largely for the respect giv
en him by his teammates. It's not
that he's loud. He inspires
positive thinking through his
own,' quiet methods. "I'm not the
rah-rah type of leader who gets
up in front and talks to ev
erybody," Harmon explains.
"I'm only a junior, so it's not re
ally my place anyway. I try to be
more of a field leader."
