## CT's Guest Greek of the Week 
### 
Guest Greek is a regular feature
of Cardinal Today in which prom
inent members of the Stanford
community are asked to make pre
dictions on the Stanford and Cali
fornia football games.
This week's Guest Greek is
Jimmy Johnson, assistant to the
athletic director at Stanford.
Johnson is better known for his
years as an All-Pro cornerback

for the San Francisco 49ers.
Johnson boldly predicts that
Stanford will upset Washington
today by a score of 27-17.
"We always play tough against
the Huskies," Johnson told
Cardinal Today. We pulled to
gether amazingly well (in last
week's victory).and our rushing
game really came together in the
second half. The Huskies are
coming off a tough victory last

week, and we're probably the
toughest team that they have
faced."
In the Cal-Oregon State game,
Johnson predicts that the Bears
will cruise to an easy victory.
"1 think Cal is coming on
strong," Johnson explains.
"They have the character and the
talent and at this point in the sea
son are just a couple of steps
ahead of Oregon State."
