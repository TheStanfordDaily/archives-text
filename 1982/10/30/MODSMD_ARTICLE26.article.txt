# Fan writes to praise Band
## 
### SCOTT GOLDER 
Dear LSJUMB,
Let me begin by saying that I
am normally not one to willingly
hand out praise, especially to
people whom I have learned to be
sick of each time I see them on
Saturday. In fact, if you will re
member the vicious hate letter
which included 68 put-downs (I
counted) that you received last
year after your ANTI-show in
which you formed a no smoking
symbol that looked like a . . .
(you know what) on the field
that was me who wrote it. I even
went so far as to go on a pick
pocketing to take away the
Band's fee assessments. And re
member last year at Big Game? I
personally rounded. up 68
Berkeley students (I counted) to
fire funnelaters at you guys in
hope chat I could break some of
your bones with my under-ripe
oranges.
You do know that I tried to un
derstand and put up with up with
you people. I kept reading in the
newspapers that there was going

to be this change in the Band, and
yet it never happened. It was just
the same dumb old thing week af
ter week. I couldn't put up with
it. One would think that you at
least could vary your repertoire
and play some Mozart (my favor
ite. Oh, how I love Mozart!) Or
some jazz. But noooo! In my
opinion, you were the worst.
This year, however, I have
found myself in the midst of a
moral dilemma. Try as I might to
find things that I can hate about
the Band, I can find zero, but I
can find at least 68 things (I
counted) that I like about the
Band. I mean, to begin with, last
winter you guys started playing
jazz, and then this year you
played Mozart's Symphony No.
20 in G-minor. (Oh, how I love
Mozart.) And the Dollies are
wearing real boots on the field.
And you have even shown that
you can march all 68 times two
of you (I counted).
Of course, I can't forget to save
some applause for what promises
to be a great show this weekend.

The pre-game "Drugs in the
News" show where you will play
"Working for a Living," "Cars,"
and "All Day and All of the
Night," seems quite appropriate.
I can't wait to see the half time
"Salute to Your Mascot," where
you will play "Gonna Fly Now,"
"The Cardinal is Waving," and
"Let the Children Play."
As far as I'm concerned, the
talked-about change is not forth
coming it's here right now. I'm
going to tell as many people as I
can (at least 68 I'll count) that
you have risen to excellence this
year. What more can I say except
that my donation check is in the
mail, my apologies for past
wrongs are humbly submitted
and my campaign to stop people
from hurling oranges and.water
balloons at you has begun.
Keep up the good work, and
good luck at UCLA in two
weeks.
Sincerely,
