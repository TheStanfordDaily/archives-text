# Card's post season hopes on line today
## 
### ADAM BERNS 
Stanford coach Paul Wiggin
said last week that this was just
another game. But do not be
fooled. The game is probably the
most important of the season.
Stanford's bowl hopes and
John Elway's Heisman dreams
will be put before public scrutiny
in today's nationally televised
contest with Keith Jackson and
Frank Broyles calling the con
test. The No. 2 ranked Washing
ton Huskies or No. 1, depend
ing on which poll you believe
will provide the perfect op
portunity for John Elway and
Stanford to reestablish their
aerial circus before a national tel
evision audience.
The game also provides Wash
ington a chance to snap back af
ter a close 10-3 victory over un
heralded Texas Tech. Apparently
the football writers thought the
game was too close, and Wash
ington was dethroned from its
No. 1 rank in the AP writers poll.
While Washington has gener
ally not been overly impressive in
its victories, the one important
statistic is its 7-0-0 record.
"They're an interesting team,"
Stanford coach Paul Wiggin said
about the Huskies. "They play to
win. I think in the sheer balance
of things, they're a good football
team.
"They create so many things."
Wiggin added. "They are a field
position football team and they
rarely make mistakes."
Husky running back and Rose
Bowl MVP Jacques Robinson,
from San Jose, had been some
what c" a disappointment this
year. A ter spraining an ankle in
spring practice, he had been
somewhat of an enigma, rushing
for only 267 yards in the first six
games this year.

Robinson, however, is back
just in time for the Cardinal. Last
week he broke loose for 203 yards
on 35 carries, the best day for a
Husky runner in eight years.
"Two things are happening,"
Husky coach Don James ex
plains about Robinson's emer
gence. "He (Robinson) is getting
a chance to play a lot more, and
he's no doubt healthier now."
Emerging seemed to be the fad
last weekend as the Cardinal
found a running game of its own.
Stanford senior Mike Dotterer,
who filled in for the injured Vin
cent White, rushed for 155 yards
as the Stanford ground game
blasted Washington State for 246
yards, a season high. Discount
ing Darrin Nelson, Dotterer's
rushing mark was the highest for
the Cardinal in the last 24 years.
"(Washington St.) Coach
(Jim) Walden felt that if they
could shut down the pass, they
could beat us," Dotterer said of
last week's game against the
Cougars. "I think they over
looked the running game.
"When you run the ball as
many times as we did last week,
you gain a lot of confidence.
They (Washington) will be a little
more worried about our running
game.
"The way I look at it, it's great
to play and do well," he added.
"I'm just looking forward to this
week. It's going to be a big
challenge. It's a big game for us.
The biggest game I've ever played
in."
Ironically, Dotterer will not be
starting today because Vincent
White is finally healthy, but Dot
terer is expected to play a signifi
cant part of the game.
Elway is coming off his
statistically worst game of the
season, passing for only 85 yards

against the Cougars. Incredibly
none of his wide receivers caught
a single pass, and seven balls were
uncharacteristically dropped.
After the game, however, Wiggin
said that Elway was one of the
main reasons for the success of
the ground game because the
Cougars were so worried about
his passing.
Last week the Cardinal defense
surrendered 431 yards but played
well considering the circum
stances.
"I think as you study what
happens on film, our players
fought down to the bitter end.
They held a team which had been

averaging 4.3 yards per carry on
the ground to only 3.6 yards.
However, the things I didn't like
were the sustained drives."
Stanford free safety Vaughn
Williams made 20 tackles, 14 of
which were unassisted last week
and continues to lead the im
proved Cardinal secondary.
Sophomore outside linebacker
Garin Veris has also been playing
well and leads the team in sacks
â€¢ with 11.
The Washington offense has
been the strong point of the
Husky team this season but its
been a subject of controversy.
Junior quarterback Steve Pelluer

has been the starter, completing
102-of-179 passes for 1131 yards,
but has gotten some stiff com
petition for the starting job by
senior Tim Cowen (22-of-63, 300
yards).
The quarterback question is a
sensitive one for James who
wants to avoid a quarterback
controversy at all costs. When
asked if he has a quarterback
problem this past week, James re
sponded, "I don't think so."
James has always believed in a
balanced attack and the Huskies
are almost as balanced as a team
can get. They are averaging 1467
yards on the ground and 1431
through the air.
One of the strong points of the
Husky offense is its massive of
fensive line which averages over
260 pounds per man. Receiver
Paul Skansi leads the receiver
corps with 33 receptions for 447
yards and three touchdowns.
"Washington is an outside
type of running team," Stanford
linebacker Veris explains about
the Husky attack. "The bring the
guards and tackles and try to hit
the hole. They've got a good corp
of receievers and Robinson will
be tough to handle."
The biggest scoring threat for
Washington may be a player who
is not even in the game much, All-
America kicker Chuck Nelson.
He has made 25 straight field
goals and has scored 255 career
points, just five short of the con
ference record.
The Washington defense will
provide another stern test for the
Cardinal. The Huskies are sev
enth nationally in total defense
allowing only 246.3 yards per
game and are 14th against the
run, giving up 98.1 yards a game.
Washington also ranks well


Artie Streiber/Daily
RUGGED DEFENSE: The Stanford defense has had its ups and
downs this season by head coach Paul Wiggin has generally been
pleased by its performance. Washington has a balanced offense
and will be even tougher this weekend with the recent emergence of
Jacques Robinson.
