# Geiger voices opposition to college TV rights
## 
### LISA STERN 
In the third installment of
Cardinal Today's exclusive in
terviews with Stanford football de
cision makers, we spoke with Ath
letic Director Andy Geiger. Since
coming to the Farm in 1979,
Geiger has made his impression on
both the Stanford athletic pro
gram and in NCAA athletics as a
whole. He has lobbied successfully
for the expansion of the number of
teams allowed in the NCAA
basketball tournament, and he
continues to serve on the eight
member NCAA Tournament
Committee for basketball. In ad
dition to these chores, Geiger also
holds a position on the U.S. Olym
pic Budget and Audit Committee.
In this interview, Geiger offered
his views of the recent NCAA tele
vision contract litigation, the pos
sibility of the Superbowl coming to
the Farm, stadium renovations and
the student seating problem.
CT: This season Stanford has
appeared in two nationally tele
vised games and one regionally
televised contest. This weekend
the Cardinal will again be fea

tured on ABC against the Wash
ington Huskies in front of a na
tional television audience. How
much revenue does the Univer
sity's athletic department receive
from these appearances?
Geiger: The three national
games are worth approximately
$285,000, and the regional games
some what less than that. There is
a formula that differs for splitting
up the revenues between the
Pac-10 schools depending upon
the various telecast situations.
There is a different formula that
applies for each kind: a non-con
ference regional game, a non
conference national game, a con
ference regional game, and a con
ference national game. The
schools that are not on television
do the best on a conference na
tional game. Each non-partici
pating Pac-10 school will get
$66,000, and Washington and
Stanford will get $286,000.
CT: Recently NCAA teams
such as Georgia and Oklahoma
have petitioned to draw up their
own television contracts outside
the NCAA. What is Stan

ford'sposition on this con
troversy?
Geiger: We don't agree with
that. We believe there should be
national control. I don't think it's
healthy for there to be a free-for
all for television because the gen
erating power is in the local mar
ket. We happen to be in the
number five market in the coun
try, and we probably would do
reasonably well. There are
schools in our conference which
do not share that capability.
The Los Angeles schools
would have a tremendous advan
tage over everyone else because
they are in the number two tele
vision market in the whole na
tion. Stanford and Cal would
have the next best advantage.
Obviously Seattle and Phoenix
would come next. The others
would trail. This weekend is a
perfect example. CBS is regional
ly telecasting the Washington St.-
Arizona game, but if there were
no controls and there was not a
nationally controlled formula,
that game would not be televised.
CT: What is John Elway's role

in Stanford's ability to attract na
tional television to Palo Alto for
the past two home games?
Geiger: I think John is obvious
ly a factor. He is considered the
premier quarterback in the coun
try. Because of him and our of
fensive philosophy, Stanford is
fun to watch. You never know
what is going to happen.
CT: What do you think will be
the eventual outcome of the liti
gation between the NCAA and
the teams who want to negotiate
their own television contracts?
Geiger: I'm not a lawyer and I
don't know the technical
strengths and weaknesses or
what the NCAA's appeal ground
will be. I suspect, however, that
the outcome of the litigation will
not mean a great deal because I
think that probably the college
community will go to Congress
and try to get an exemption.
CT: Stanford has been men
tioned frequently as the possible
site of the 1985 Superbowl. What
are the chances that the cham
pionship game will come to the
Farm?

Geiger: I think there is a very
good chance because San Fran
cisco is so attractive as the
number one tourist destination in
the country. The Superbowl has
never been in the Bay Area, and
there is only one stadium that
qualifies to host the game. If the
game comes to San Francisco,
the chances that it will be at Stan
ford are very good.
CT: How would acquisition of
the 1985 Superbowl affect Uni
versity plans to renovate the
Stanford Stadium facilities?
Geiger: We have some work to do
on the stadium in order to quali
fy. We have plans to spend some
money on the stadium anyway in
the next several years to try keep
the facilities up. In the 61-year
history of the stadium it has not
been well cared for, and we have
a long ways to go. We need to up
grade the rest room facilities par
ticularly in terms of the number
of rest rooms available. The con
cession stands and the press box
will need some expansion for that
game, even though they are ade-
