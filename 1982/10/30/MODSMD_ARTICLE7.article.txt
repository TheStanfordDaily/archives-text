# SID nationwide survey
## 
### 
Cardinal Today conducted two exclusive polls of Sports Information
Directors around the country this past week. In two separte polls one
completely random, the other of SIDs with Heisman candidates the
SIDs around the country were asked to rank the Heisman candidates
from one through five. Five points were given for every first place vote,
four for every second place vote, etc. The votes were then tallied up and
the players ranking was given as a percentage of the total number of votes
it was possible for a candidate to get. John Elway was the clear leader in
the random poll but the race was much closer among the SIDs with can
didates. Interestingly, the random poll included only two schools west of
the Mississippi, yet Elway still faired well among the Eastern SIDs.
