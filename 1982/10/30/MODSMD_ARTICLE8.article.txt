# Poll of nation's SIDs shows Heisman Trophy for Elway
## 
### ADAM BERNS 
If the sports information direc
tors around the country voted for
the Heisman Trophy, John
Elway would be the clear winner.
Cardinal Today conducted a
random sampling of sports in
formation directors around the
country and found Stanford's
quarterback Elway to be the clear
first choice of college SIDs, fol
lowed by Georgia's Herschel
Walker and Pittsburgh's Dan
Marino.
Of course it is the sportswriters
1000 of them to be exact
that ultimately decide who wins
the Heisman Trophy. But the
critical link between the players
on the field and the writers in the
press box are the college SIDs.
Promoting a candidate for the
Heisman Trophy varies from col
lege to college. Cardinal Today
talked with SIDs from Stanford,
Pittsburgh, Illinois, UCLA,
Southern Methodist University,
Georgia and Penn State and
found that Heiman promotion
strategies were as varied as the
schools themselves.
"It's a misconception that
SIDs do anything," Stanford
SID Bob Rose explained about
promoting a Heisman candidate.,
"It comes down to what you do
on the field. It's my job to inform
the media of John's statistics.
"I feel that I'm dealing in a
position of strength because John
is such a uniquely talented quar
terback. I have a whole drawer
full of quotes from coaches and
scouts who have said that John
may be the greatest quarterback
to ever play the game at any level.
I don't feel that I have to go out
and do anything special."
As for Elway's chances of win
ning the award, Rose feels that
the contest will definitely be
tween Elway and Georgia run
ning back Herschel Walker.
"There's no question that
Herschel is the greatest threat to
John. He's also a uniquely tal
ented player. Like John, he's also
being called one of the greatest
players ever at his position. I
think the two players are definite
ly separated from the pack.
"When John and Herschel

leave college football," Rose
added."people will still be talking
about theni for years to come."
Although Elway is coming off
his worst game of the season, his
statistics this year are still im
pressive. He has completed 166
passes in 264 attempts for 2036
yards and 17 touchdowns. He has
broken virtually every Stanford
and Pac-10 passing record, and
he is within reaching of several
career NCAA records.
Claude Felton, the SID at the
University of Geogia, takes a
Heisman campaign approach
similar to Rose.
We're just trying to make the
media aware of what Herschel is
doing," he said. "We send out
weekly mailings to the media
with Herschel's updated stats,
and note every record which he
breaks, which is just about every
week now."
While Elway has been in a mini
slump, Walker has been improv
ing every week since his thumb
injury at the start of the season,
and many people now consider
him the front runner. He's rushed
for 975 yards on 209 carries for a
4.6 average and has been im
pressive the last few weeks, gain
ing 152 yards last Saturday.
"I'd say his chances are good,"
Felton predicts about Walker's
Heisman standings. "Three
weeks ago they probably weren't
that good, but now he has as
good an opportunity as anybody
else. He's steadily gotten stronger
every week."
SMU Sports Information Di
rector Bob Condron takes a
much more aggressive approach
to the Heisman campaign. Pro
moting running back Eric
Dickerson for the Heisman
Trophy has become almost a full
time job. While Rose and Felton
seem more content to let their
candidates earn the award on the
field, Condron's strategy is to
win it through the air, not by
passing, but via the postal ser
vice.
"We put out 1500 specialized
mailings on two guys, Dickerson
and James," Condron said last
week"We call them the pony ex
press. We also have a weekly

newletter. Before the year, we
sent out videotaped highlights to
all the networks. Obviously
Dickerson is the one we're
pushing right now."
Condron's problem at the be
ginning of the season was that
both Dickerson and James were
legitimate candidates for the
Heisman Trophy. Although
Dickerson splits time in the
backfield with James, he has still
compiled impressive statistics.
Rushing for 1119 yards on only
154 carries, Dickerson boasts a
7.3 yards per carry average and
has rushed for 100 yards or more
in 19 of his last 22 games.
At SMU, the Heisman cam
paign is serious business, and is a
large part of Condron's job.
When Cardinal Today asked him
about his general Heisman cam
paign strategy, Condron replied,
"Do you have 30 minutes?"
With all the effort that Con
dron is putting into Dickerson's
campaign, however, he main
tains a sense of humor about the
Heisman race and Dickerson's
chances of winning it.
"For Dickerson to win," Con
dron said, "let's see. Elway
would probably have to leave the
country and Walker would have
to get hurt."
Although quarterback Dan
Marino is having a subpar year at
Pittsburgh, his name is still men
tioned when the Heisman
Trophy is brought up. Pittsburgh
SID Joyce Aschenbrenner ad
mits that their carrpai , r n for
Marino has not been too intense.
. "We're not doing much of any
thing right now," she explained.
"We do give the press his up to
date statistics, but that's about it.
"I think he has a good chance
of winning," Aschenbrenner
added. "He has had a great three
year career. He has been a real
team leader. I feel to many people
look just for the statistics, but
Danny is a field general."
Thus far, Marino's statistics
have fallen short of last year. He
has completed 119 passes for
1532 yards and nine touchdowns,
but has had a problem with in
terceptions.
The other big quarterback
hope of the East is Penn State
quarterback Todd Blackledge.
Dave Baker, the SID at Penn
State, echoes comments similar
to Rose regarding his strategy for
promoting Blackledge.
"We aren't publishing any
prochures," he said. "We've nev
er really gone to that type of pro
motion because we feel it is not
becoming of the University. We
feel that players win the award on
the field."
Baker feels that Blackledge
does not stand much chance of
winning the award because the he
has not thrown much in the past
few weeks. Blackledge has at
tempted the fewest number of
passes of the top quarterback
candidates, and currently has
completed 112 passes in 190 at
tempts for 1445 yards and 17
touchdowns.
"Right now he's not going to
win the award. In the last two
weeks he has not thrown the ball
that much. His job is to win, and
he (Blackledge) told me last week
that if winning means throwing
the less, that's what he'll do.
"I would hope, however,"
Baker added, "that Blackledge
finishes in the top five."
Tony Eason is another quar
terback whose name is men
tioned in the same breath as the
Heisman Trophy. In eight games
(one more than the rest of the
candidates) , he has completed
203 passes in 330 attempts for
2484 yards and 13 touchdowns.
"We got an awareness cam

paign going early," Illinois SID
Tab Bennett explained, "but we
haven't done a whole lot beyond
that. "I think that Tony is a very
legitimate candidate and he's
having a successful performance
this year."
In a season often called "The
year of the quarterback," the big
surprise has been UCLA's Tom
Ramsey who leads the nation in
the sophisticated quarterback
rankings.
Ramsey was not a legitimate
candidate at the start of the sea
son, but has been impressive
enough this year to get a
Heisman campaign started at
UCLA. He has completed 136
passes in 208 attempts for 2042
yards and 16 touchdowns.
"There's not really any
strategy," UCLA SID Gary
Rausch explains about Ramsey's
Heisman buildup. "We're just
trying to open as many doors as
possible. Sporting News has a
cover story ready, they've al
ready shot all the photos and
done the interviews, and we're
just trying to make it as easy as
possible for him to get national
exposure.
"There's no question that he is
a dark horse candidate because
he didn't have the stats coming
into this year. In fact, we felt Cor
mac Carney had the best chance
of achieving All-America honors
this year and he is on our press
guide cover. The problem is that
all of the other quarterbacks had
great stats for the past couple of
years."
If the sports information direc
tors around the country voted for
the Heisman Trophy, John
Elway would be the clear winner.
Cardinal Today conducted a

time job. While Rose and Felton
seem more content to let their
candidates earn the award on the
field, Condron's strategy is to
win it through the air, not by
passing, but via the postal ser
vice.
"We put out 1500 specialized
mailings on two guys, Dickerson
and James," Condron said last
week"We call them the pony ex
press. We also have a weekly

newletter. Before the year, we
sent out videotaped highlights to
all the networks. Obviously
Dickerson is the one we're
pushing right now."
Condron's problem at the be
ginning of the season was that
both Dickerson and James were
legitimate candidates for the
Heisman Trophy. Although
Dickerson splits time in the
backfield with James, he has still
compiled impressive statistics.
Rushing for 1119 yards on only
154 carries, Dickerson boasts a
7.3 yards per carry average and
has rushed for 100 yards or more
in 19 of his last 22 games.
At SMU, the Heisman cam
paign is serious business, and is a
large part of Condron's job.
When Cardinal Today asked him
about his general Heisman cam
paign strategy, Condron replied,
"Do you have 30 minutes?"
With all the effort that Con
dron is putting into Dickerson's
campaign, however, he main
tains a sense of humor about the
Heisman race and Dickerson's
chances of winning it.
"For Dickerson to win," Con
dron said, "let's see. Elway
would probably have to leave the
country and Walker would have
to get hurt."
Although quarterback Dan
Marino is having a subpar year at
Pittsburgh, his name is still men
tioned when the Heisman
Trophy is brought up. Pittsburgh
SID Joyce Aschenbrenner ad
mits that their carrpai , r n for
Marino has not been too intense.
. "We're not doing much of any
thing right now," she explained.
"We do give the press his up to
date statistics, but that's about it.
"I think he has a good chance
of winning," Aschenbrenner
added. "He has had a great three
year career. He has been a real
team leader. I feel to many people
look just for the statistics, but
Danny is a field general."
Thus far, Marino's statistics
have fallen short of last year. He
has completed 119 passes for
1532 yards and nine touchdowns,
but has had a problem with in
terceptions.
The other big quarterback
hope of the East is Penn State
quarterback Todd Blackledge.
Dave Baker, the SID at Penn
State, echoes comments similar
to Rose regarding his strategy for
promoting Blackledge.
"We aren't publishing any
prochures," he said. "We've nev
er really gone to that type of pro
motion because we feel it is not
becoming of the University. We
feel that players win the award on
the field."
Baker feels that Blackledge
does not stand much chance of
winning the award because the he
has not thrown much in the past
few weeks. Blackledge has at
tempted the fewest number of
passes of the top quarterback
candidates, and currently has
completed 112 passes in 190 at
tempts for 1445 yards and 17
touchdowns.
"Right now he's not going to
win the award. In the last two
weeks he has not thrown the ball
that much. His job is to win, and
he (Blackledge) told me last week
that if winning means throwing
the less, that's what he'll do.
"I would hope, however,"
Baker added, "that Blackledge
finishes in the top five."
Tony Eason is another quar
terback whose name is men
tioned in the same breath as the
Heisman Trophy. In eight games
(one more than the rest of the
candidates) , he has completed
203 passes in 330 attempts for
2484 yards and 13 touchdowns.
"We got an awareness cam

paign going early," Illinois SID
Tab Bennett explained, "but we
haven't done a whole lot beyond
that. "I think that Tony is a very
legitimate candidate and he's
having a successful performance
this year."
In a season often called "The
year of the quarterback," the big
surprise has been UCLA's Tom
Ramsey who leads the nation in
the sophisticated quarterback
rankings.
Ramsey was not a legitimate
candidate at the start of the sea
son, but has been impressive
enough this year to get a
Heisman campaign started at
UCLA. He has completed 136
passes in 208 attempts for 2042
yards and 16 touchdowns.
"There's not really any
strategy," UCLA SID Gary
Rausch explains about Ramsey's
Heisman buildup. "We're just
trying to open as many doors as
possible. Sporting News has a
cover story ready, they've al
ready shot all the photos and
done the interviews, and we're
just trying to make it as easy as
possible for him to get national
exposure.
"There's no question that he is
a dark horse candidate because
he didn't have the stats coming
into this year. In fact, we felt Cor
mac Carney had the best chance
of achieving All-America honors
this year and he is on our press
guide cover. The problem is that
all of the other quarterbacks had
great stats for the past couple of
years."
If the sports information direc
tors around the country voted for
the Heisman Trophy, John
Elway would be the clear winner.
Cardinal Today conducted a
random sampling of sports in
formation directors around the
country and found Stanford's
quarterback Elway to be the clear
first choice of college SIDs, fol
lowed by Georgia's Herschel
Walker and Pittsburgh's Dan
Marino.
Of course it is the sportswriters
1000 of them to be exact
that ultimately decide who wins
the Heisman Trophy. But the
critical link between the players
on the field and the writers in the
press box are the college SIDs.
Promoting a candidate for the
Heisman Trophy varies from col
lege to college. Cardinal Today
talked with SIDs from Stanford,
Pittsburgh, Illinois, UCLA,
Southern Methodist University,
Georgia and Penn State and
found that Heiman promotion
strategies were as varied as the
schools themselves.
"It's a misconception that
SIDs do anything," Stanford
SID Bob Rose explained about
promoting a Heisman candidate.,
"It comes down to what you do
on the field. It's my job to inform
the media of John's statistics.
"I feel that I'm dealing in a
position of strength because John
is such a uniquely talented quar
terback. I have a whole drawer
full of quotes from coaches and
scouts who have said that John
may be the greatest quarterback
to ever play the game at any level.
I don't feel that I have to go out
and do anything special."
As for Elway's chances of win
ning the award, Rose feels that
the contest will definitely be
tween Elway and Georgia run
ning back Herschel Walker.
"There's no question that
Herschel is the greatest threat to
John. He's also a uniquely tal
ented player. Like John, he's also
being called one of the greatest
players ever at his position. I
think the two players are definite
ly separated from the pack.
"When John and Herschel

leave college football," Rose
added."people will still be talking
about theni for years to come."
Although Elway is coming off
his worst game of the season, his
statistics this year are still im
pressive. He has completed 166
passes in 264 attempts for 2036
yards and 17 touchdowns. He has
broken virtually every Stanford
and Pac-10 passing record, and
he is within reaching of several
career NCAA records.
Claude Felton, the SID at the
University of Geogia, takes a
Heisman campaign approach
similar to Rose.
We're just trying to make the
media aware of what Herschel is
doing," he said. "We send out
weekly mailings to the media
with Herschel's updated stats,
and note every record which he
breaks, which is just about every
week now."
While Elway has been in a mini
slump, Walker has been improv
ing every week since his thumb
injury at the start of the season,
and many people now consider
him the front runner. He's rushed
for 975 yards on 209 carries for a
4.6 average and has been im
pressive the last few weeks, gain
ing 152 yards last Saturday.
"I'd say his chances are good,"
Felton predicts about Walker's
Heisman standings. "Three
weeks ago they probably weren't
that good, but now he has as
good an opportunity as anybody
else. He's steadily gotten stronger
every week."
SMU Sports Information Di
rector Bob Condron takes a
much more aggressive approach
to the Heisman campaign. Pro
moting running back Eric
Dickerson for the Heisman
Trophy has become almost a full
time job. While Rose and Felton
seem more content to let their

field, Condron's strategy is to

finishes in the top five."
Tony Eason is another quar
terback whose name is men
tioned in the same breath as the
Heisman Trophy. In eight games
(one more than the rest of the
candidates) , he has completed
203 passes in 330 attempts for
2484 yards and 13 touchdowns.
"We got an awareness cam

paign going early," Illinois SID
Tab Bennett explained, "but we
haven't done a whole lot beyond
that. "I think that Tony is a very
legitimate candidate and he's
having a successful performance
this year."
In a season often called "The
year of the quarterback," the big
surprise has been UCLA's Tom
Ramsey who leads the nation in
the sophisticated quarterback
rankings.
Ramsey was not a legitimate
candidate at the start of the sea
son, but has been impressive
enough this year to get a
Heisman campaign started at
UCLA. He has completed 136
passes in 208 attempts for 2042
yards and 16 touchdowns.
"There's not really any
strategy," UCLA SID Gary
Rausch explains about Ramsey's
Heisman buildup. "We're just
trying to open as many doors as
possible. Sporting News has a
cover story ready, they've al
ready shot all the photos and
done the interviews, and we're
just trying to make it as easy as
possible for him to get national
exposure.
"There's no question that he is
a dark horse candidate because
he didn't have the stats coming
into this year. In fact, we felt Cor
mac Carney had the best chance
of achieving All-America honors
this year and he is on our press
guide cover. The problem is that
all of the other quarterbacks had
great stats for the past couple of
years."
If the sports information direc
tors around the country voted for
the Heisman Trophy, John
Elway would be the clear winner.
Cardinal Today conducted a
random sampling of sports in
formation directors around the
country and found Stanford's
quarterback Elway to be the clear
first choice of college SIDs, fol
lowed by Georgia's Herschel
Walker and Pittsburgh's Dan
Marino.
Of course it is the sportswriters
1000 of them to be exact
that ultimately decide who wins
the Heisman Trophy. But the
critical link between the players
on the field and the writers in the
press box are the college SIDs.
Promoting a candidate for the
Heisman Trophy varies from col
lege to college. Cardinal Today
talked with SIDs from Stanford,
Pittsburgh, Illinois, UCLA,
Southern Methodist University,
Georgia and Penn State and
found that Heiman promotion
strategies were as varied as the
schools themselves.
"It's a misconception that
SIDs do anything," Stanford
SID Bob Rose explained about
promoting a Heisman candidate.,
"It comes down to what you do
on the field. It's my job to inform
the media of John's statistics.
"I feel that I'm dealing in a
position of strength because John
is such a uniquely talented quar
terback. I have a whole drawer
full of quotes from coaches and
scouts who have said that John
may be the greatest quarterback
to ever play the game at any level.
I don't feel that I have to go out
and do anything special."
As for Elway's chances of win
ning the award, Rose feels that
the contest will definitely be
tween Elway and Georgia run
ning back Herschel Walker.
"There's no question that
Herschel is the greatest threat to
John. He's also a uniquely tal
ented player. Like John, he's also
being called one of the greatest
players ever at his position. I
think the two players are definite
ly separated from the pack.
"When John and Herschel

leave college football," Rose
added."people will still be talking
about theni for years to come."
Although Elway is coming off
his worst game of the season, his
statistics this year are still im
pressive. He has completed 166
passes in 264 attempts for 2036
yards and 17 touchdowns. He has
broken virtually every Stanford
and Pac-10 passing record, and
he is within reaching of several
career NCAA records.
Claude Felton, the SID at the
University of Geogia, takes a
Heisman campaign approach
similar to Rose.
We're just trying to make the
media aware of what Herschel is
doing," he said. "We send out
weekly mailings to the media
with Herschel's updated stats,
and note every record which he
breaks, which is just about every
week now."
While Elway has been in a mini
slump, Walker has been improv
ing every week since his thumb
injury at the start of the season,
and many people now consider
him the front runner. He's rushed
for 975 yards on 209 carries for a
4.6 average and has been im
pressive the last few weeks, gain
ing 152 yards last Saturday.
"I'd say his chances are good,"
Felton predicts about Walker's
Heisman standings. "Three
weeks ago they probably weren't
that good, but now he has as
good an opportunity as anybody
else. He's steadily gotten stronger
every week."
SMU Sports Information Di
rector Bob Condron takes a
much more aggressive approach
to the Heisman campaign. Pro
moting running back Eric
Dickerson for the Heisman
Trophy has become almost a full
time job. While Rose and Felton
seem more content to let their
candidates earn the award on the
field, Condron's strategy is to
win it through the air, not by
passing, but via the postal ser
vice.
"We put out 1500 specialized
mailings on two guys, Dickerson
and James," Condron said last
week"We call them the pony ex
press. We also have a weekly

newletter. Before the year, we
sent out videotaped highlights to
all the networks. Obviously
Dickerson is the one we're
pushing right now."
Condron's problem at the be
ginning of the season was that
both Dickerson and James were
legitimate candidates for the
Heisman Trophy. Although
Dickerson splits time in the
backfield with James, he has still
compiled impressive statistics.
Rushing for 1119 yards on only
154 carries, Dickerson boasts a
7.3 yards per carry average and
has rushed for 100 yards or more
in 19 of his last 22 games.
At SMU, the Heisman cam
paign is serious business, and is a
large part of Condron's job.
When Cardinal Today asked him
about his general Heisman cam
paign strategy, Condron replied,
"Do you have 30 minutes?"
With all the effort that Con
dron is putting into Dickerson's
campaign, however, he main
tains a sense of humor about the
Heisman race and Dickerson's
chances of winning it.
"For Dickerson to win," Con
dron said, "let's see. Elway
would probably have to leave the
country and Walker would have
to get hurt."
Although quarterback Dan
Marino is having a subpar year at
Pittsburgh, his name is still men
tioned when the Heisman
Trophy is brought up. Pittsburgh
SID Joyce Aschenbrenner ad
mits that their carrpai , r n for
Marino has not been too intense.
. "We're not doing much of any
thing right now," she explained.
"We do give the press his up to
date statistics, but that's about it.
"I think he has a good chance
of winning," Aschenbrenner
added. "He has had a great three
year career. He has been a real
team leader. I feel to many people
look just for the statistics, but
Danny is a field general."
Thus far, Marino's statistics
have fallen short of last year. He
has completed 119 passes for
1532 yards and nine touchdowns,
but has had a problem with in
terceptions.
The other big quarterback
hope of the East is Penn State
quarterback Todd Blackledge.
Dave Baker, the SID at Penn
State, echoes comments similar
to Rose regarding his strategy for
promoting Blackledge.
"We aren't publishing any
prochures," he said. "We've nev
er really gone to that type of pro
motion because we feel it is not
becoming of the University. We
feel that players win the award on
the field."
Baker feels that Blackledge
does not stand much chance of
winning the award because the he
has not thrown much in the past
few weeks. Blackledge has at
tempted the fewest number of
passes of the top quarterback
candidates, and currently has
completed 112 passes in 190 at
tempts for 1445 yards and 17
touchdowns.
"Right now he's not going to
win the award. In the last two
weeks he has not thrown the ball
that much. His job is to win, and
he (Blackledge) told me last week
that if winning means throwing
the less, that's what he'll do.
"I would hope, however,"
Baker added, "that Blackledge
finishes in the top five."
Tony Eason is another quar
terback whose name is men
