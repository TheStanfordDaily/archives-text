# Husky comer comes home
## 
### MARK ZEIGLER 
The last time Stanford and
Washington met in Stanford Sta
dium, a sophomore cornerback
made a big play a very big play
late in the game when all the
marbles were on the table.
With the score knotted at 24-
all, Stanford within striking dis
tance of the end zone and the
Rose Bowl on the line, quarter
back John Elway threw what
looked like a sure touchdown
pass into the endzone. It was
knocked away at the last second
by the young defensive back.
Moments later, the Huskies re
gained possession of the ball and
drove within Chuck Nelson field
goal range, which, for Nelson, is
as good as three points. True to
his near perfect record, Nelson
split the uprights as time ran out
and the Cardinal kissed the game
and the Rose Bowl goodbye.
Today, Elway again will face

that "spoiler" right cor
nerback Bill Stapleton an Ail-
American honorable mention
choice by Pro Football Weekly
last season and All Pac-10 hon
orable mention for the past two
years. Stapleton, a 6-foot, 191
pound senior, teams with left cor
nerback Ray Horton, also a sen
ior, to form one of the most tal
ented and experienced duo of
cornerbacks in the nation.
"This is the ultimate test this
week (against Elway) to see how
much we've improved since the
start of the season," Stapleton re
marked in a phone interview last
Tuesday. The cornerback is a
graduate of San Francisco's Lin
coln High where he was a prep
All-America as both a junior and
senior.
Indeed Elway and Co. will
pose the Huskies' biggest de
fensive challenge to date this sea
son, something Stapleton takes

in stride.
"You can't really go out and
try to stop him," he said. "You
just try to contain him. You keep
him inside the 30-yard lines and
not in the end zone."
To do so, the No. 2 ranked
Huskies will employ a variety of
tactics, according to Stapleton,
including basic man-to-man and
zone pass coverage. He also
stressed a sufficient defensive line
surge as key to pressuring Elway
and "containing" his record set
ting passing attack.
Though he doesn't like to look
too far ahead, Stapleton realizes
that today's contest is just the
first of what he calls "four big
games." The Huskies face the
likes of UCLA, Arizona State
and intra-state rival Washington
State after today's date with
Stanford.

ranked Huskies, Stapleton feels
the pressure of gaining not only a
Rose Bowl berth, but the na
tional championship as well.
Nonetheless, he remains op
timistic.
"In the past two years, I didn't
really think we had a good
chance at going to the Rose
Bowl," he explained. "We have a
better team this year than in the
past and so I tjiink we have a
good shot at the Rose Bowl.
"To be national champs, we
have to win 11 (regular season)
games and a post-season bowl
game," he continued.
A national championship
would the only fitting going away
present to a senior class that has
been so instrumental in bringing
the Huskies out of the land of
football mediocrity. Though
1982's Huskie squad has been
four years in the making, the
seeds of success first emerged
when Stapleton was a freshman.
"We first noticed that (the
potential to be great) when we
were on the scout team against
the varsity (as freshmen)," he
noted. "There was already a
among the fellows."

His performance in his last vis
it to Stanford Stadium as well as
having family and friends attend
ing the game, however, are not
the only reason Stapleton will
feel at home playing in Stanford
Stadium.
"It's a grass field," he said.
"It's somewhat like my grass
field in high school. As a de
fensive back, we have to plant
hard (when backpedaling). On
Astro-turf it's kind of hard, but
on grass, it's a bit more secure."
The Huskies play their home
games on artifical turf, so a grass
field is a treat for the defensive
backs.
And although Stapleton has
only five career interceptions, he
will not hold back this afternoon.
"If the ball comes, I'm going for
it. . I'll be conservative, but
agressive."
A speech communications ma
jor, Stapleton is interested in
eventually embarking on a
teaching career. "I want to teach
people and help people learn.
"But the teaching field doesn't
offer much monetary considera
tion," he added. "You do it be
cause you want to." J

ented and experienced duo of
cornerbacks in the nation.
"This is the ultimate test this
week (against Elway) to see how
much we've improved since the
start of the season," Stapleton re
marked in a phone interview last
Tuesday. The cornerback is a
graduate of San Francisco's Lin
coln High where he was a prep
All-America as both a junior and
senior.
Indeed Elway and Co. will
pose the Huskies' biggest de
fensive challenge to date this sea
son, something Stapleton takes

in stride.
"You can't really go out and
try to stop him," he said. "You
just try to contain him. You keep
him inside the 30-yard lines and
not in the end zone."
To do so, the No. 2 ranked
Huskies will employ a variety of
tactics, according to Stapleton,
including basic man-to-man and
zone pass coverage. He also
stressed a sufficient defensive line
surge as key to pressuring Elway
and "containing" his record set
ting passing attack.
Though he doesn't like to look
too far ahead, Stapleton realizes
that today's contest is just the
first of what he calls "four big
games." The Huskies face the
likes of UCLA, Arizona State
and intra-state rival Washington
State after today's date with
Stanford.

A TASK CUT OUT: Washington defensive back Bill Stapleton,
a Bay Area product, faces a difficult task today stopping John
Elway. Two years ago at Stanford Stadium, Stapleton deflected
an Elway pass in the endzone to preserve a Husky victory.
ranked Huskies, Stapleton feels
the pressure of gaining not only a
Rose Bowl berth, but the na
tional championship as well.
Nonetheless, he remains op
timistic.
"In the past two years, I didn't
really think we had a good
chance at going to the Rose
Bowl," he explained. "We have a
better team this year than in the
past and so I tjiink we have a
good shot at the Rose Bowl.
"To be national champs, we
have to win 11 (regular season)
games and a post-season bowl
game," he continued.
A national championship
would the only fitting going away
present to a senior class that has
been so instrumental in bringing
the Huskies out of the land of
football mediocrity. Though
1982's Huskie squad has been
four years in the making, the
seeds of success first emerged
when Stapleton was a freshman.
"We first noticed that (the
potential to be great) when we
were on the scout team against
the varsity (as freshmen)," he
noted. "There was already a
among the fellows."

His performance in his last vis
it to Stanford Stadium as well as
having family and friends attend
ing the game, however, are not
the only reason Stapleton will
feel at home playing in Stanford
Stadium.
"It's a grass field," he said.
"It's somewhat like my grass
field in high school. As a de
fensive back, we have to plant
hard (when backpedaling). On
Astro-turf it's kind of hard, but
on grass, it's a bit more secure."
The Huskies play their home
games on artifical turf, so a grass
field is a treat for the defensive
backs.
And although Stapleton has
only five career interceptions, he
will not hold back this afternoon.
"If the ball comes, I'm going for
it. . I'll be conservative, but
agressive."
A speech communications ma
jor, Stapleton is interested in
eventually embarking on a
teaching career. "I want to teach
people and help people learn.
"But the teaching field doesn't
offer much monetary considera
tion," he added. "You do it be
cause you want to." J
The last time Stanford and
Washington met in Stanford Sta
dium, a sophomore cornerback
made a big play a very big play
late in the game when all the
marbles were on the table.
With the score knotted at 24-
all, Stanford within striking dis
tance of the end zone and the
Rose Bowl on the line, quarter
back John Elway threw what
looked like a sure touchdown
pass into the endzone. It was
knocked away at the last second
by the young defensive back.
Moments later, the Huskies re
gained possession of the ball and
drove within Chuck Nelson field
goal range, which, for Nelson, is
as good as three points. True to
his near perfect record, Nelson
split the uprights as time ran out
and the Cardinal kissed the game
and the Rose Bowl goodbye.
Today, Elway again will face
