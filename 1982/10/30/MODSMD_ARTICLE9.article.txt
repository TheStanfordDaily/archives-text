# Husky comer comes home
## 
### MARK ZEIGLER 
The last time Stanford and
Washington met in Stanford Sta
dium, a sophomore cornerback
made a big play a very big play
late in the game when all the
marbles were on the table.
With the score knotted at 24-
all, Stanford within striking dis
tance of the end zone and the
Rose Bowl on the line, quarter
back John Elway threw what
looked like a sure touchdown
pass into the endzone. It was
knocked away at the last second
by the young defensive back.
Moments later, the Huskies re
gained possession of the ball and
drove within Chuck Nelson field
goal range, which, for Nelson, is
as good as three points. True to
his near perfect record, Nelson
split the uprights as time ran out
and the Cardinal kissed the game
and the Rose Bowl goodbye.
Today, Elway again will face

that "spoiler" right cor
nerback Bill Stapleton an Ail-
American honorable mention
choice by Pro Football Weekly
last season and All Pac-10 hon
orable mention for the past two
years. Stapleton, a 6-foot, 191
pound senior, teams with left cor
nerback Ray Horton, also a sen
ior, to form one of the most tal
ented and experienced duo of
cornerbacks in the nation.
"This is the ultimate test this
week (against Elway) to see how
much we've improved since the
start of the season," Stapleton re
marked in a phone interview last
Tuesday. The cornerback is a
graduate of San Francisco's Lin
coln High where he was a prep
All-America as both a junior and
senior.
Indeed Elway and Co. will
pose the Huskies' biggest de
fensive challenge to date this sea
son, something Stapleton takes

in stride.
"You can't really go out and
try to stop him," he said. "You
just try to contain him. You keep
him inside the 30-yard lines and
not in the end zone."
To do so, the No. 2 ranked
Huskies will employ a variety of
tactics, according to Stapleton,
including basic man-to-man and
zone pass coverage. He also
stressed a sufficient defensive line
surge as key to pressuring Elway
and "containing" his record set
ting passing attack.
Though he doesn't like to look
too far ahead, Stapleton realizes
that today's contest is just the
first of what he calls "four big
games." The Huskies face the
likes of UCLA, Arizona State
and intra-state rival Washington
State after today's date with
Stanford.
Like the rest of the No. 2

A TASK CUT OUT: Washington defensive back Bill Stapleton,
a Bay Area product, faces a difficult task today stopping John
Elway. Two years ago at Stanford Stadium, Stapleton deflected
an Elway pass in the endzone to preserve a Husky victory.
