It is with great sadness that the Stanford Sing
les community notes the passing of Master
Williamson M. Evers. In his decades at Stan
ford, Mr. Evers has done more to spread the
social thought of Hugh Hefner and Helen Gur
ley Brown than anyone since Columbus disco
vered alternative use for sheep. Now, how
ever, a medical tragedy is compelling Dr.
Evers to marry. But Bill, it's not necessary!
There is a cure now for herpes. It's called
Extra-Strength Tylenol. Just check at your
local drugstore and then you can rejoin us.
