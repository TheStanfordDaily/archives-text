HOW WILL YOU VOTE FOR
PEACE?
0 YES on Prop. 12
Bilateral Nuclear Weapons Freeze
0 DAVE WALD for U.S. Senate
Peace & Freedom Party
Both Wilson and Brown favor the B-1 bomber, the Green
Berets and maintaining our arsenal of nuclear weapons,
along with approving and supporting Israel's invasion of
Lebanon and the military junta's repression in El Salvador.
Wilson backs Reagan's draft registration plan, and Brown
advocates doubling our conventional military forces in
Europe.
DAVE WALD offers a reasonable alternative to these
insane policies. Wald demands that military spending be
slashed and that federal funds be used for human needs
jobs, schools, health care, housing.
