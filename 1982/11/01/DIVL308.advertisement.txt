Something on your mind?
Say it on your back with the

Yes, with this dandy product you can put any messages you like on the
garment of your choice: front or back of a t-shirt or pull-over sweater; the
back of your jacket, windbreaker, jogging suit, uniform or BBQ apron.
The BACK WORDS KIT comes complete with 162 letters of the alphabet,
numerals and punctuation marks, all 1" high. It comes with four 10" long
"backing strips" that you can sew on any outer garment. On these strips you
then affix any combination of letters. The backing stips can be washed or
dry cleaned on the garment. The letters are color-fast. They can be attach
ed and reattached hundreds of times. You can make a new message in
minutes. You can make a million different messages. Did someone say, "I
don't get it?" Perhaps the illustrated examples below will give doubters an
idea of BACK WORDS' versatility.
(Note: The photos were shot using a dummy model. This should not be
taken as a reflection on prospective purchasers. It's just that the dummy
proved cooperative, did not fidgit, demand refreshments or require exhor
bitant modeling fees.)
