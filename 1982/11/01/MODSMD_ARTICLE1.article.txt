# Neighbors scared after killing
## 
### GLEN ALLERHAND JAN MIRELES 
Fear pervades the Frenchman's Hill
I neighborhood.
"Solicitors ... if you ring or knock,
the police will be called to verify your
identity," reads the hand-printed sign
near the door at 848 Allardice Way.
Several people decline to speak to re
porters. Others open the door a crack to
seek identification.
A week after University student
Angela Dee Arvidson was stabbed to
death here, the residents of this quiet
street speak about the incident in
hushed tones.
"Everyone was terrified," said one
woman, a former University graduate
student. The neighborhood had a false
sense of security before the slaying, she
f added, "Now we're just more careful."
The woman refused to give her name.
"We will have fewer dealings with
outside enterprises," the woman said.
The Halloween weekend just then be
ginning, she added that an adult would
accompany her children during trick
or-treating.
"This has affected the women more,"
another resident said. "They are fright
ened." He is a next-door neighbor of
Dr. Laurence Kedes and Shirley Kedes,
residents of the home where Arvidson
was killed. Laurence Kedes is an as
sociate professor of hematology in the
Medical School.
"This door would not have been
opened," the neighbor said, if his chil
dren or wife were there without him.
"I'm trying to be home a little bit
more."
Jeannette Blaschke, who lives at 855
Allardice, produced a University letter
containing home security tips. Among
the recommendations: install viewers in
front doors, avoid accepting random
deliveries and do not open doors for
strangers. Stanford Police Chief
Marvin Herrington sent the letter last
week to homes in the areas of
Frenchman's Hill, Pine Hill and Peter
Coutts, according to Patrol Captain
Marvin Moore.
Donald John Amos, the suspect in
the Arvidson case, worked as a de
liveryman.
One resident said he plans to install a
burglar alarm in his home, but cau
tioned that it will not provide protec
tion against a deliveryman who is per
mitted in the house.
Blaschke, who lives across the street
from the Redes', said she has told her
children not to inform telephone callers
when she and her husband are away
from home. She also said she will or
ganize a neighborhood watch system if
no one else acts soon. Blaschke called
this the "best deterrent" to crime.
She said she thinks the police now pa
trol the neighborhood more often than
they did before the slaying.
The former graduate student ex
pressed surprise that patrols apparently
have not increased. She said that be
cause so many faculty members live on
Frenchman's Hill, the University bears
responsibility for providing protection.
In fact, the University police have not

increased patrols, Moore said. Even
before the slaying, he added,
Frenchman's Hill was "one of our
priority areas."
Blaschke said she still regards her
neighborhood as safer than others in
the Bay Area. "I prefer this area be
cause we live so close together," she
said. "We know our neighbors."
Yet conversations spoken through
closed doors and head-shaking that un
derscores a refusal to talk suggest that
the slaying remains like a bad dream on
Allardice Way. A
"Friday night (after Arvidson war
slain), I didn't sleep very well," said a
woman who lives on Allardice. "There
are a lot of crazy people around who
figured this? There was no reason to
murder her."
"How much could you really defend
yourself?" asked Marlys Mallett, who
lives at 861 Allardice. "Little things are
making us more scared. Even though
we start getting over it, we talk about it.
It brings fears back."

the recommendations: install viewers in
front doors, avoid accepting random
deliveries and do not open doors for
strangers. Stanford Police Chief
Marvin Herrington sent the letter last
week to homes in the areas of
Frenchman's Hill, Pine Hill and Peter
Coutts, according to Patrol Captain
Marvin Moore.
Donald John Amos, the suspect in
the Arvidson case, worked as a de
liveryman.
One resident said he plans to install a
burglar alarm in his home, but cau
tioned that it will not provide protec
tion against a deliveryman who is per
mitted in the house.
Blaschke, who lives across the street
from the Redes', said she has told her
children not to inform telephone callers
when she and her husband are away
from home. She also said she will or
ganize a neighborhood watch system if
no one else acts soon. Blaschke called
this the "best deterrent" to crime.
She said she thinks the police now pa
trol the neighborhood more often than
they did before the slaying.
The former graduate student ex
pressed surprise that patrols apparently
have not increased. She said that be
cause so many faculty members live on
Frenchman's Hill, the University bears
responsibility for providing protection.
In fact, the University police have not

increased patrols, Moore said. Even
before the slaying, he added,
Frenchman's Hill was "one of our
priority areas."
Blaschke said she still regards her
neighborhood as safer than others in
the Bay Area. "I prefer this area be
cause we live so close together," she
said. "We know our neighbors."
Yet conversations spoken through
closed doors and head-shaking that un
derscores a refusal to talk suggest that
the slaying remains like a bad dream on
Allardice Way. A
"Friday night (after Arvidson war
slain), I didn't sleep very well," said a
woman who lives on Allardice. "There
are a lot of crazy people around who
figured this? There was no reason to
murder her."
"How much could you really defend
yourself?" asked Marlys Mallett, who
lives at 861 Allardice. "Little things are
making us more scared. Even though
we start getting over it, we talk about it.
It brings fears back."
