A time for water management

The efforts of the various levels of government to
construct an elaborate network of dams, reservoirs
and aquaducts throughout the state is one of the
most important reasons why agriculture continues
to be the number one business in California.
Through this labyrinth, water is transported from
one end of the state to the other, making productive
farm land out of what would otherwise be barren
and desolate regions. Without irrigation Kern
County, the most productive agricultural county in
the state, would be able to produce only a fraction
of the wide variety of crops it now grows.
And yet amid this monument to man's efforts at
increasing food production, there exist serious wa
ter problems that, if not addressed quickly, could
lead to the destruction of the state's crop- produc
ing capabilities. We feel Proposition 13, the water
reform initiative, represents an important step that
addresses some of the long-ignored problems that
plague water use in California and threaten the
health of its economy.
The director of the State Water Resources De
partment, Ronald Robie, has stated repeatedly that
the most important water problem in California is
the overdraft of groundwater basins, which occurs
when more water is pumped out of the basins than
is replenished each year. Although this problem
threatens to turn certain areas of the state into
deserts, it has been virtually ignored for years.
Proposition 13 will require 11 areas in the state
where the problem is particularly serious to develop
and execute groundwater management plans under
the approval of the State Water Resources Control
Board.
Another important component of the proposi
tion requires those who benefit from state and fed
eral water projects to pay costs which more ac
curately reflect the costs associated with delivering
the water. For years highly subsidized water has
created price distortions that have resulted in ineffi
cient and wasteful water usage habits. For example,
farmers are charged from $2 to $5 for federally-sub
sidized water which costs the government about
$5O to $6O dollars to deliver. These types of distor
tions have led to the economic undervaluation of
conservation and to an inordinate reliance on large

water projects. In addition to being costly to tax
payers, these projects in many cases produce
detrimental effects on the environment.
They have also led to a distorted attitude. Instead
of the state concentrating efforts on efficiently us
ing water made available through the construction
of dams, energy has been expended to plan and con
struct new projects.
To help change these misplaced priorities, the in
itiative requires federal, state and local agencies to
implement conservation plans before new inter
basin water transfers could be made. Water dis
tricts would have to consider seriously conserva
tion alternatives such as waste water reclamation as
another source of water.
The law, poorly worded as it is, also requires the
Water Resources Control Board to consider other
uses besides agriculture for water in rivers and
streams when allocating permits. This would at
least recognize the recreational claims of rafters
and others who use rivers when decisions about is
suing permits are being made, although it in no way
assures these claimants priority.
The last and most controversial part of the in
iative prohibits the filling of the New Melones Dam
on the Stanislaus River in the foothills, until con
tracts for at least 75 percent of its water have been
signed. This measure is left over from the battle
over a dam that probably shouldn't have been built.
While we feel the goal of preserving the nine-mile
river rafting stretch is desirable, we feel that includ
ing this issue in Proposition 13 serves to confuse the
voter and that it would be better off in a separate
initiative.
Opponents of this initiative claim that it
places too much power in the hands of the Water
Resources Control Board and reduces the power of
local agencies. While we certainly favor the idea of
local control, the records compiled by these water
agencies have proven that they do not have the fore
sight and responsibility to adopt a balanced ap
proach to water use.
As a step toward infusing conservation and man
agement into the use of water in agricuture, which
accounts for 85 percent of the state's water needs,
we wholeheartedly endorse Proposition 13.

No choice offered, none made

If genetic engineers could select and combine hu
man characteristics, they would be doing a great
service by beginning with the 12th Congressional
District candidates. Combining Democrat Emmett
Lynch's compassion and political impulses with
Republican Ed Zschau's intelligence, obvious lead
ership abilities and breadth of view would be fine
work.
Just as genetic engineers can perform no such
feat, neither can we bring ourselves to endorse
either candidate. Lynch is scantily informed on
many issues, all too ready to provide stock liberal
answers to problems demanding new ideas, and
lacks the vision and expression we demand of any
one representing retiring Rep. Pete McCloskey's
district. Zschau, however, supports most of Presi
dent Reagan's social and economic measures, sup
poses free enterprise will solve all too many prob
lems and seems to empathize too little with current
hardships and social needs. Only their Libertarian
opponent's positions are worse than these men's
faults.
Lynch's economic program is standard Demo
cratic fare: closing those nasty loopholes that allow
the corporate rich to profit at the expense of others,
government programs to cure our social ills, and
spending and training to strengthen the economy.
His opposition to Reagan's social and economic
legislation is praiseworthy, but when pressed to
elaborate upon where the waste is or upon how his
programs would differ from current ones, Lynch
has pitifully little to say.
Zschau is and represents the entrepreneurial
businessman. Although he quibbles with the Rea
gan tax cuts, he is enthusiastic about the fundamen
tal strategem of using tight monetary policies and
social program cuts to balance the budget to lower
interest rates, which will spur investment, which
will in turn expand the economy and provide jobs.

All very tidy and well-argued, as long as you aren't
one of the people out of work or believes those so
cial programs have some merit.
Foreign policy confounds both men as well.
Lynch is quick to mouth the freeze and disarma
ment rhetoric despite his spotty foreign affairs
knowledge, and Zschau has swallowed the Reagan
diet of strategic interests that preclude linking U.S.
policy to human rights or other internal matters.
Lynch wants the defense budget cut but doesn't
know quite where, and Zschau would "work
toward lower real increases in the defense budget"
than Reagan's, but enormous increases never
theless.
Education fares well in both men's plans. Lynch's
27 years as a public education teacher and adminis
trator underlie his support for education espe
cially vocational and basic public education.
Zschau taught at Stanford and Harvard's business
schools after receiving his Ph.D. here and strongly
supports education funding because, typically, "it
is one of the best investments of government
funds."
Zschau is heavily favored to defeat Lynch, largely
because the Republican is the hand-picked suc
cessor to McCloskey and has outspent his oppo
nent by nearly 10 to one. Although he defends his
spending margin by saying he is educating the vot
ers (i.e., the people with money are "educating" the
voters), he is quick to separate himself from Mc-
Closkey's coziness with the PLO and attacks upon
the "Jewish lobby."
The 12th District will probably elect Zschau, an
intelligent, articulate, creative and independent
leader. We hope he realizes the world is not solely
composed of self-made millionaires such as himself
and that he turns his abundant skills toward solving
very human and very real problems confronting the
nation.

U.S. Senate Jerry Brown
In the California race, Pete Wilson's support for
Reaganomics and his political moves against the ju

Proposition 11, bottle deposit yes
Proposition 11 requires that all beer and soft

drink containers sold in California have a deposit,
which would have a significant effect on what is
clearly a growing problem: litter. The "bottle bill"
also makes good economic sense. Many studies in
dicate that it would bring a net reduction in energy
consumption and other scarce resources. A vote for
the "bottle bill" combines aesthetics and economy.
Proposition 12, nuclear weapons freeze yes
The nuclear freeze initiative offers no solution to
the diplomatic and philosophical conditions that
threaten nuclear war. It will, however, signify na

Proposition 14, redistricting yes
Proposition 14 would change the current method
of California reapportionment, which results in
crazily gerrymandered districts, by shifting re
districting responsibilities from the State Legisla
ture to a depoliticized commission. We urge you To
vote yes.
Proposition 15, handgun restrictions yes
By requiring the registration of handguns in Cali
fornia, Proposition 15 seeks to gain control over the
proliferation and violent use of these weapons,
while prohibiting limits on rifles or shotguns. These
provisions, as well as others in the bill, would re
duce handgun violence while protecting the civil

uses besides agriculture for water in rivers and
streams when allocating permits. This would at
least recognize the recreational claims of rafters
and others who use rivers when decisions about is
suing permits are being made, although it in no way
assures these claimants priority.
The last and most controversial part of the in
iative prohibits the filling of the New Melones Dam
on the Stanislaus River in the foothills, until con
tracts for at least 75 percent of its water have been
signed. This measure is left over from the battle
over a dam that probably shouldn't have been built.
While we feel the goal of preserving the nine-mile
river rafting stretch is desirable, we feel that includ
ing this issue in Proposition 13 serves to confuse the
voter and that it would be better off in a separate
initiative.
Opponents of this initiative claim that it
places too much power in the hands of the Water
Resources Control Board and reduces the power of
local agencies. While we certainly favor the idea of
local control, the records compiled by these water
agencies have proven that they do not have the fore
sight and responsibility to adopt a balanced ap
proach to water use.
As a step toward infusing conservation and man
agement into the use of water in agricuture, which
accounts for 85 percent of the state's water needs,
we wholeheartedly endorse Proposition 13.

No choice offered, none made

If genetic engineers could select and combine hu
man characteristics, they would be doing a great
service by beginning with the 12th Congressional
District candidates. Combining Democrat Emmett
Lynch's compassion and political impulses with
Republican Ed Zschau's intelligence, obvious lead
ership abilities and breadth of view would be fine
work.
Just as genetic engineers can perform no such
feat, neither can we bring ourselves to endorse
either candidate. Lynch is scantily informed on
many issues, all too ready to provide stock liberal
answers to problems demanding new ideas, and
lacks the vision and expression we demand of any
one representing retiring Rep. Pete McCloskey's
district. Zschau, however, supports most of Presi
dent Reagan's social and economic measures, sup
poses free enterprise will solve all too many prob
lems and seems to empathize too little with current
hardships and social needs. Only their Libertarian
opponent's positions are worse than these men's
faults.
Lynch's economic program is standard Demo
cratic fare: closing those nasty loopholes that allow
the corporate rich to profit at the expense of others,
government programs to cure our social ills, and
spending and training to strengthen the economy.
His opposition to Reagan's social and economic
legislation is praiseworthy, but when pressed to
elaborate upon where the waste is or upon how his
programs would differ from current ones, Lynch
has pitifully little to say.
Zschau is and represents the entrepreneurial
businessman. Although he quibbles with the Rea
gan tax cuts, he is enthusiastic about the fundamen
tal strategem of using tight monetary policies and
social program cuts to balance the budget to lower
interest rates, which will spur investment, which
will in turn expand the economy and provide jobs.

All very tidy and well-argued, as long as you aren't
one of the people out of work or believes those so
cial programs have some merit.
Foreign policy confounds both men as well.
Lynch is quick to mouth the freeze and disarma
ment rhetoric despite his spotty foreign affairs
knowledge, and Zschau has swallowed the Reagan
diet of strategic interests that preclude linking U.S.
policy to human rights or other internal matters.
Lynch wants the defense budget cut but doesn't
know quite where, and Zschau would "work
toward lower real increases in the defense budget"
than Reagan's, but enormous increases never
theless.
Education fares well in both men's plans. Lynch's
27 years as a public education teacher and adminis
trator underlie his support for education espe
cially vocational and basic public education.
Zschau taught at Stanford and Harvard's business
schools after receiving his Ph.D. here and strongly
supports education funding because, typically, "it
is one of the best investments of government
funds."
Zschau is heavily favored to defeat Lynch, largely
because the Republican is the hand-picked suc
cessor to McCloskey and has outspent his oppo
nent by nearly 10 to one. Although he defends his
spending margin by saying he is educating the vot
ers (i.e., the people with money are "educating" the
voters), he is quick to separate himself from Mc-
Closkey's coziness with the PLO and attacks upon
the "Jewish lobby."
The 12th District will probably elect Zschau, an
intelligent, articulate, creative and independent
leader. We hope he realizes the world is not solely
composed of self-made millionaires such as himself
and that he turns his abundant skills toward solving
very human and very real problems confronting the
nation.

Proposition 11, bottle deposit yes
Proposition 11 requires that all beer and soft

drink containers sold in California have a deposit,
which would have a significant effect on what is

Proposition 14, redistricting yes
Proposition 14 would change the current method

vote yes.
Proposition 15, handgun restrictions yes
By requiring the registration of handguns in Cali
fornia, Proposition 15 seeks to gain control over the
proliferation and violent use of these weapons,
while prohibiting limits on rifles or shotguns. These

A time for water management

The efforts of the various levels of government to
construct an elaborate network of dams, reservoirs
and aquaducts throughout the state is one of the
most important reasons why agriculture continues
to be the number one business in California.
Through this labyrinth, water is transported from
one end of the state to the other, making productive
farm land out of what would otherwise be barren
and desolate regions. Without irrigation Kern
County, the most productive agricultural county in
the state, would be able to produce only a fraction
of the wide variety of crops it now grows.
And yet amid this monument to man's efforts at
increasing food production, there exist serious wa
ter problems that, if not addressed quickly, could
lead to the destruction of the state's crop- produc
ing capabilities. We feel Proposition 13, the water
reform initiative, represents an important step that
addresses some of the long-ignored problems that
plague water use in California and threaten the
health of its economy.
The director of the State Water Resources De
partment, Ronald Robie, has stated repeatedly that
the most important water problem in California is
the overdraft of groundwater basins, which occurs
when more water is pumped out of the basins than
is replenished each year. Although this problem
threatens to turn certain areas of the state into
deserts, it has been virtually ignored for years.
Proposition 13 will require 11 areas in the state
where the problem is particularly serious to develop
and execute groundwater management plans under
the approval of the State Water Resources Control
Board.
Another important component of the proposi
tion requires those who benefit from state and fed
eral water projects to pay costs which more ac
curately reflect the costs associated with delivering
the water. For years highly subsidized water has
created price distortions that have resulted in ineffi
cient and wasteful water usage habits. For example,
farmers are charged from $2 to $5 for federally-sub
sidized water which costs the government about
$5O to $6O dollars to deliver. These types of distor
tions have led to the economic undervaluation of
conservation and to an inordinate reliance on large

water projects. In addition to being costly to tax
payers, these projects in many cases produce
detrimental effects on the environment.
They have also led to a distorted attitude. Instead
of the state concentrating efforts on efficiently us
ing water made available through the construction
of dams, energy has been expended to plan and con
struct new projects.
To help change these misplaced priorities, the in
itiative requires federal, state and local agencies to
implement conservation plans before new inter
basin water transfers could be made. Water dis
tricts would have to consider seriously conserva
tion alternatives such as waste water reclamation as
another source of water.
The law, poorly worded as it is, also requires the
Water Resources Control Board to consider other
uses besides agriculture for water in rivers and
streams when allocating permits. This would at
least recognize the recreational claims of rafters
and others who use rivers when decisions about is
suing permits are being made, although it in no way

Zschau is and represents the entrepreneurial
businessman. Although he quibbles with the Rea
gan tax cuts, he is enthusiastic about the fundamen
tal strategem of using tight monetary policies and
social program cuts to balance the budget to lower
interest rates, which will spur investment, which
will in turn expand the economy and provide jobs.

All very tidy and well-argued, as long as you aren't
one of the people out of work or believes those so
cial programs have some merit.
Foreign policy confounds both men as well.
Lynch is quick to mouth the freeze and disarma
ment rhetoric despite his spotty foreign affairs
knowledge, and Zschau has swallowed the Reagan
diet of strategic interests that preclude linking U.S.
policy to human rights or other internal matters.
Lynch wants the defense budget cut but doesn't
know quite where, and Zschau would "work
toward lower real increases in the defense budget"
than Reagan's, but enormous increases never
theless.
Education fares well in both men's plans. Lynch's
27 years as a public education teacher and adminis
trator underlie his support for education espe
cially vocational and basic public education.
Zschau taught at Stanford and Harvard's business
schools after receiving his Ph.D. here and strongly
supports education funding because, typically, "it
is one of the best investments of government
funds."
Zschau is heavily favored to defeat Lynch, largely
because the Republican is the hand-picked suc
cessor to McCloskey and has outspent his oppo
nent by nearly 10 to one. Although he defends his
spending margin by saying he is educating the vot
ers (i.e., the people with money are "educating" the
voters), he is quick to separate himself from Mc-
Closkey's coziness with the PLO and attacks upon
the "Jewish lobby."
The 12th District will probably elect Zschau, an
intelligent, articulate, creative and independent
leader. We hope he realizes the world is not solely
composed of self-made millionaires such as himself
and that he turns his abundant skills toward solving
very human and very real problems confronting the
nation.

11th Congressional District Tom Lantos
The congressional race for Stanford's district pits
liberal Democrat Tom Lantos against conservative
Republican Bill Royer. Lantos' commitment to
education, open research, the environment, fun
damental social services and intelligent spending
cause us to urge a vote for Lantos.
U.S. Senate Jerry Brown
In the California race, Pete Wilson's support for
Reaganomics and his political moves against the ju
diciary, compared with Jerry Brown's capacity for
producing new and needed ideas, leads us to recom
mend a vote for Brown.
California Governor Tom Bradley
Democrat Tom Bradley's views on crime, his
support of Proposition 15 and his commitment to
education and to environmental protection make
him the best candidate. We strongly endorse Brad
ley.
State Assembly Byron Sher
The race for Stanford and Palo Alto's assembly
seat between Democrat Byron Sher and Re
publican William Parkinson presents us with the
most obvious choice in the campaign: Sher is a
thoughtful, reasonable candidate who should be
reelected.
Proposition 11, bottle deposit yes
Proposition 11 requires that all beer and soft

drink containers sold in California have a deposit,
which would have a significant effect on what is
clearly a growing problem: litter. The "bottle bill"
also makes good economic sense. Many studies in
dicate that it would bring a net reduction in energy
consumption and other scarce resources. A vote for
the "bottle bill" combines aesthetics and economy.
Proposition 12, nuclear weapons freeze yes
The nuclear freeze initiative offers no solution to
the diplomatic and philosophical conditions that
threaten nuclear war. It will, however, signify na
tionally and internationally a demand that progress
be made.
Proposition 14, redistricting yes
Proposition 14 would change the current method
of California reapportionment, which results in
crazily gerrymandered districts, by shifting re
districting responsibilities from the State Legisla
ture to a depoliticized commission. We urge you To
vote yes.
Proposition 15, handgun restrictions yes
By requiring the registration of handguns in Cali
fornia, Proposition 15 seeks to gain control over the
proliferation and violent use of these weapons,
while prohibiting limits on rifles or shotguns. These
provisions, as well as others in the bill, would re
duce handgun violence while protecting the civil
liberties of all Californians.
A time for water management

The efforts of the various levels of government to
construct an elaborate network of dams, reservoirs
and aquaducts throughout the state is one of the
most important reasons why agriculture continues
to be the number one business in California.
Through this labyrinth, water is transported from
one end of the state to the other, making productive
farm land out of what would otherwise be barren
and desolate regions. Without irrigation Kern
County, the most productive agricultural county in
the state, would be able to produce only a fraction
of the wide variety of crops it now grows.
And yet amid this monument to man's efforts at
increasing food production, there exist serious wa
ter problems that, if not addressed quickly, could
lead to the destruction of the state's crop- produc
ing capabilities. We feel Proposition 13, the water
reform initiative, represents an important step that
addresses some of the long-ignored problems that
plague water use in California and threaten the
health of its economy.
The director of the State Water Resources De
partment, Ronald Robie, has stated repeatedly that
the most important water problem in California is
the overdraft of groundwater basins, which occurs
when more water is pumped out of the basins than
is replenished each year. Although this problem
threatens to turn certain areas of the state into
deserts, it has been virtually ignored for years.
Proposition 13 will require 11 areas in the state
where the problem is particularly serious to develop
and execute groundwater management plans under
the approval of the State Water Resources Control
Board.
Another important component of the proposi
tion requires those who benefit from state and fed
eral water projects to pay costs which more ac
curately reflect the costs associated with delivering
the water. For years highly subsidized water has
created price distortions that have resulted in ineffi
cient and wasteful water usage habits. For example,
farmers are charged from $2 to $5 for federally-sub
sidized water which costs the government about
$5O to $6O dollars to deliver. These types of distor
tions have led to the economic undervaluation of
conservation and to an inordinate reliance on large

water projects. In addition to being costly to tax
payers, these projects in many cases produce
detrimental effects on the environment.
They have also led to a distorted attitude. Instead
of the state concentrating efforts on efficiently us
ing water made available through the construction
of dams, energy has been expended to plan and con
struct new projects.
To help change these misplaced priorities, the in
itiative requires federal, state and local agencies to
implement conservation plans before new inter
basin water transfers could be made. Water dis
tricts would have to consider seriously conserva
tion alternatives such as waste water reclamation as
another source of water.
The law, poorly worded as it is, also requires the
Water Resources Control Board to consider other
uses besides agriculture for water in rivers and
streams when allocating permits. This would at
least recognize the recreational claims of rafters
and others who use rivers when decisions about is
suing permits are being made, although it in no way
assures these claimants priority.
The last and most controversial part of the in
iative prohibits the filling of the New Melones Dam
on the Stanislaus River in the foothills, until con
tracts for at least 75 percent of its water have been
signed. This measure is left over from the battle
over a dam that probably shouldn't have been built.
While we feel the goal of preserving the nine-mile
river rafting stretch is desirable, we feel that includ
ing this issue in Proposition 13 serves to confuse the
voter and that it would be better off in a separate
initiative.
Opponents of this initiative claim that it
places too much power in the hands of the Water
Resources Control Board and reduces the power of
local agencies. While we certainly favor the idea of
local control, the records compiled by these water
agencies have proven that they do not have the fore
sight and responsibility to adopt a balanced ap
proach to water use.
As a step toward infusing conservation and man
agement into the use of water in agricuture, which
accounts for 85 percent of the state's water needs,
we wholeheartedly endorse Proposition 13.

No choice offered, none made

If genetic engineers could select and combine hu
man characteristics, they would be doing a great
service by beginning with the 12th Congressional
District candidates. Combining Democrat Emmett
Lynch's compassion and political impulses with
Republican Ed Zschau's intelligence, obvious lead
ership abilities and breadth of view would be fine
work.
Just as genetic engineers can perform no such
feat, neither can we bring ourselves to endorse
either candidate. Lynch is scantily informed on
many issues, all too ready to provide stock liberal
answers to problems demanding new ideas, and
lacks the vision and expression we demand of any
one representing retiring Rep. Pete McCloskey's
district. Zschau, however, supports most of Presi
dent Reagan's social and economic measures, sup
poses free enterprise will solve all too many prob
lems and seems to empathize too little with current
hardships and social needs. Only their Libertarian
opponent's positions are worse than these men's
faults.
Lynch's economic program is standard Demo
cratic fare: closing those nasty loopholes that allow
the corporate rich to profit at the expense of others,
government programs to cure our social ills, and
spending and training to strengthen the economy.
His opposition to Reagan's social and economic
legislation is praiseworthy, but when pressed to
elaborate upon where the waste is or upon how his
programs would differ from current ones, Lynch
has pitifully little to say.
Zschau is and represents the entrepreneurial
businessman. Although he quibbles with the Rea
gan tax cuts, he is enthusiastic about the fundamen
tal strategem of using tight monetary policies and
