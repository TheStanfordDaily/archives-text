# Notes in the Margin
## Sino-Soviet talks important 
### 
In Beijing and Moscow, the top lead
ership groups are reconsidering their
options after the first round of talks
aimed at re-establishing the two na
tions' long-broken ties.
Given the numerous failed attempts
at a rapprochement since their fiery
break-up in the early 19605, the chances
of any substantial agreement are slim.
However, the fact that Sino-Soviet talks
have resumed at this particular time is
significant.
Noting the fading health of Soviet
leader Leonid Brezhnev, top Soviet of
ficials are beginning to look around at
each other and size up the possibilities.
While an out-and-out power struggle is
not yet in evidence, at least to the West,
the members of the Politburo and the
Secretariat of the Communist Party are
undoubtedly beginning to stake out
positions.
During the talks two weeks ago in
New York between Soviet Foreign
Minister Andrei Gromyko and Secre
tary of State George Shultz, the Soviets
said Brezhnev's health has reduced him
to a two-day work week and that a
meeting between Brezhnev and Presi
dent Reagan would be impossible.
At home, a recent campaign to en
force ideological conformity is under
way, as is a crackdown on dissent. All
signs seem to be pointing to an attempt
by the leadership to achieve domestic
calm as a means of heading off potential
popular disturbances if a prolonged
struggle ensues within the leadership.
The health-imposed retirement of
senior Politburo member Andrei
Kirilenko, which will be officially an

nounced at the party's Central Com
mittee meeting in mid-November, only
adds to the uncertainty of the suc
cession. Previously seen as the front
runner, Kirilenko, with his departure,
may increase the volatility of the suc
cession period as less-recognized lead
ers build the alliances and support es
sential to the effective conduct of poli
cy.
There is an eerie lull emanating from
Moscow, with the crackdown on
domestic opposition and the slow-mov
ing preparation and waiting.
Succession is not a matter of routine
in the Soviet Union. The leadership
struggles of the mid-1920s and the
mid-1950s provide ample evidence of
the strength of the opposing factions
within the Communist Party when no
one leader is strong enough to force
others into line.
An agreement with China before
Brezhnev's death would give the leader
ship one less thing to worry about. Ov
ertures to the Chinese are not new. But
one indication that the present round is
aimed at more than the periodic
Brezhnev initiatives is the willingness of
the Soviets to continue the discussion in
the face of uncompromising Chinese
demands: reduction of Soviet troops on
the Chinese border, Soviet exit from Af
ghanistan and dropping of Soviet sup
port for Vietnam's occupation of Cam
bodia.
Clearly, the Soviets have no intention
of assenting unilaterally to even one of
these conditions. As for the Chinese,
Soviet representative Leonid Ilyichev's
obstinacy left them with no rosy il

lusions about Soviet intentions. Bei
jing's willingness to stay with the talks is
based not on friendship but strategic
concerns and need of insurance against
closer relations between Taiwan and
United States.
Most important is that the three
weeks of talks did occur, and both sides
reported satisfactory progress.
Whether or not an agreement will
come about after the talks move to
Moscow for the next round is not at is
sue (nor is it likely). What is of
for the Soviets is that a line of
communication, if not negotiation, has
been opened at a crucial moment. Deal
or no deal, the possibility of rash ac
tions on the Chinese's part during the
succession has been reduced. Un
wanted pressure from the Soviet mili
tary in the succession process, which
might arise were a border incident to
occur, has also been rendered less like
ly-
In the Kremlin, subtle jockeying for
influence has begun. Unless disturbed
by an international crisis, the leadership
can be expected to be increasingly con
cerned with domestic affairs until
Brezhnev's death and resolution of the
succession question. The next new
move in foreign policy may well be a
"lifting of the smoke."
For now, the orders seem to be
neither "switch on" nor "switch off" in
foreign relations, simply "hold" for the
present.

said Brezhnev's health has reduced him
to a two-day work week and that a
meeting between Brezhnev and Presi

At home, a recent campaign to en
force ideological conformity is under
way, as is a crackdown on dissent. All
signs seem to be pointing to an attempt
by the leadership to achieve domestic
calm as a means of heading off potential
popular disturbances if a prolonged
struggle ensues within the leadership.
The health-imposed retirement of
senior Politburo member Andrei
Kirilenko, which will be officially an

nounced at the party's Central Com
mittee meeting in mid-November, only
adds to the uncertainty of the suc
cession. Previously seen as the front
runner, Kirilenko, with his departure,
may increase the volatility of the suc
cession period as less-recognized lead

There is an eerie lull emanating from
Moscow, with the crackdown on
domestic opposition and the slow-mov

Succession is not a matter of routine
in the Soviet Union. The leadership
struggles of the mid-1920s and the
mid-1950s provide ample evidence of
the strength of the opposing factions
within the Communist Party when no
one leader is strong enough to force
others into line.
An agreement with China before
Brezhnev's death would give the leader
ship one less thing to worry about. Ov
ertures to the Chinese are not new. But
one indication that the present round is
aimed at more than the periodic
Brezhnev initiatives is the willingness of
the Soviets to continue the discussion in
the face of uncompromising Chinese
demands: reduction of Soviet troops on
the Chinese border, Soviet exit from Af
ghanistan and dropping of Soviet sup
port for Vietnam's occupation of Cam
bodia.
Clearly, the Soviets have no intention
of assenting unilaterally to even one of
these conditions. As for the Chinese,
Soviet representative Leonid Ilyichev's
obstinacy left them with no rosy il

lusions about Soviet intentions. Bei
jing's willingness to stay with the talks is
based not on friendship but strategic
concerns and need of insurance against
closer relations between Taiwan and
United States.
Most important is that the three
weeks of talks did occur, and both sides
reported satisfactory progress.
Whether or not an agreement will
come about after the talks move to
Moscow for the next round is not at is
sue (nor is it likely). What is of
for the Soviets is that a line of
communication, if not negotiation, has
been opened at a crucial moment. Deal
or no deal, the possibility of rash ac
tions on the Chinese's part during the
succession has been reduced. Un
wanted pressure from the Soviet mili
tary in the succession process, which
might arise were a border incident to
occur, has also been rendered less like
ly-
In the Kremlin, subtle jockeying for
influence has begun. Unless disturbed
by an international crisis, the leadership
can be expected to be increasingly con
cerned with domestic affairs until
Brezhnev's death and resolution of the
succession question. The next new
move in foreign policy may well be a
"lifting of the smoke."
For now, the orders seem to be
neither "switch on" nor "switch off" in
foreign relations, simply "hold" for the
present.

In Beijing and Moscow, the top lead
ership groups are reconsidering their
options after the first round of talks
aimed at re-establishing the two na
tions' long-broken ties.
Given the numerous failed attempts
at a rapprochement since their fiery
break-up in the early 19605, the chances
of any substantial agreement are slim.
However, the fact that Sino-Soviet talks
have resumed at this particular time is
significant.
Noting the fading health of Soviet
leader Leonid Brezhnev, top Soviet of
ficials are beginning to look around at
each other and size up the possibilities.
While an out-and-out power struggle is
not yet in evidence, at least to the West,
the members of the Politburo and the
Secretariat of the Communist Party are
undoubtedly beginning to stake out
positions.
During the talks two weeks ago in
New York between Soviet Foreign
Minister Andrei Gromyko and Secre
tary of State George Shultz, the Soviets
said Brezhnev's health has reduced him
to a two-day work week and that a
meeting between Brezhnev and Presi
dent Reagan would be impossible.
