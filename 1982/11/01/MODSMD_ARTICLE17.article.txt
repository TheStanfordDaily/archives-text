## The 						ticking of the nuclear clock. 
### 
Nuclear arsenals already exist in six,
possibly eight, nations, including the
Soviet Union and China as well as the
United States, and these programs are
being constantly expanded. The world
desperately needs a multilateral freeze
on nuclear armaments, followed by a
worldwide system for verifiable nucle
ar disarmament with on-site inspection,
if we are to have a future. This crisis is
here to stay, haunting us forever, unless
we and the rest of the nations of the
world can eliminate this perpetual
threat. In fact, humanity probably can
not sustain such an intense crisis
without eventually destroying itself.
It has been shown that we can not be
lieve what our government has been
telling us these past 40 years about the
hazards of thermonuclear war, particu
larly nuclear fallout. Federal Judge
Sherman Christensen of Salt Lake City
recently ruled that the government of
the United States "practiced fraud" in
his court in a 1955 trial about the deaths
of thousands of sheep in Utah and Ne
vada, making false and misleading rep
resentations and improperly pressuring
witnesses, so that crucial information
was withheld or misrepresented. By
these and other methods the processes
of the court were manipulated to the
government's advantage, according to
the Oct. 15 issue of Science magazine.
This kind of deception has been used
before, but it is especially frightening
when our leaders can be so deliberately
misled about nuclear warfare by the
government agencies it must depend
on.
The government's purpose in these
misrepresentations was apparently to
avoid linking the deaths of these
thousands of sheep to the atmospheric
fallout from the testing of nuclear
weapons in Nevada. The reason for this
conclusion is that a recent suit on behalf
of more than 1200 victims of leukemia
and Hodgkins disease has been filed
against the government in Salt Lake
City. On October 20, 1982, Federal
Judge Bruce Jenkins denied a govern
ment motion to dismiss the case, saying
that five weeks of testimony had raised
"terribly serious questions" about the
atomic test program conducted in open
air in Nevada during the 1950s and
19605.
What is the ultimate threat of cons
tant exposure to small doses of ionizing
radiation which is bound to occur if we
continue to build and test our nuclear
weapons? Among the causes of death of
175 radiologists who died prior to 1940,

before the nuclear age, 4.57 percent
died of leukemia. At that time, even
protected by lead aprons and gloves,
their fatality rate was 10 times higher
from leukemia than for all physicians
and about twenty times higher than in
the population at large. Both Madame
Curie and her daughter, who worked
with radium and other radioactive sub
stances, died of leukemia. It is troubling
indeed that four of the eight survivors
of two accidents involving radiation ex
posure at Los Alamos in 1945 and 1946
died of leukemia within 20 years of the
accidents. Latent deaths among the
Japanese have followed a similar course
since World War 11. The final outcome
is not yet known.
George Kennan, former U.S. am
bassador to the Soviet Union, points
out in the current Atlantic Monthly

(Nov., 1982) that the nuclear clock is
ticking and that the ticks are numbered,
and he feels the end of their number is
already in sight. The world's leaders
have not yet seriously come to grips
with this reality and taken the practical
steps necessary to reverse the direction
toward self destruction.
A nuclear freeze is the most impor
tant political issue we have ever had the
opportunity to vote upon. Granted, it is
only a first step away from the abyss of
more nuclear weaponry, nuclear testing
and the final nuclear war. But the first
step must be taken. The government
will get the message. Edmund Burke
said it well: "All that is necessary
evil to prevail is for good men to do
nothing."
