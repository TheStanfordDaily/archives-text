## Team effort upends No. 2 Washington 
### SID SPAETH 
Stanford abandoned its star
system and rebounded from two
disastrous opening drives that
nearly dumped the game in
Washington's trick-or-treat bag
to upset overwhelmingly the un
defeated No. 2 Huskies 43-31
here Saturday.
The Cardinal offense, mas
querading itself for the first time
all year, mixed the run and the
pass effectively to roll up 437
yards. Mike Dotterer rushed for
106 yards and two touchdowns
while John Elway completed 20-
of-30 passes for 265 yards and
two touchdowns.
Vincent White redeemed
himself after a fumble on the first
play of the game by scooting 76
yards with a magical punt return
touchdown late in the game to
sew up the win. But it was not
these stars that determined the
outcome, coach Paul Wiggin
said.
"Playing like a team had been
one of our goals this year," Wig
gin said. "It hasn't always been
that way. We've had our ups and
downs. Today, we were a team."
The team win was reflected all
the way down to the third men on
the depth chart. Kaulana Park, a

third-team fullback, and Dwain
Hamilton, a would-be redshirt,
were forced into the game by in
juries and played key roles.
The offensive line controlled
the line of scrimmage for the sec
ond week in a row as Stanford
backs pounded out 172 yards on
the ground. The line also gave
Elway time to pick apart the
Husky defense.
"Our offensive line played very
well," Elway said. "If we have
that kind of protection, our of
fense has so many outlets, some
thing is going to work."
Elway called the game "the
biggest win of my career," but the
Cardinal was muddling through
the wet turf early.
White burst for 14 yards up the
middle on his first carry, but
fumbled when he was hit by safe
ty Vince Newsome and Washing
ton's Ron Holmes recovered at
the Stanford 34-yard line.
"I was really tight at the begin
ning," White said. "The play was
wide open, it wasn't much of a
hit. I just fumbled the ball."
Washington's Jacques Rob
inson capped a touchdown drive
with a 13-yard touchdown run
five plays later.
Elway took the snap on the

first play of the next drive and
fired it at Mike Tolliver in the left
flat, but Chris O'Connor stepped
in front to intercept at the Stan
ford 39-yard line. The Huskies
were in position to run away ear
ly, but a blitzing Garin Veris
caught quarterback Steve Pelluer
for an eight-yard loss on third
down moving the Huskies out of
Chuck Nelson's field goal range.
Veris made 14 tackles, includ
ing five for losses, in keying the
defense, which had four intercep
tions.
Stanford finally got unwound
on Washington's next series
when linebacker Kevin Bates
darted in front of a Pelluer pass
to Robinson and made a diving
interception at the Husky 36.
Elway tied the score on a 35-
yard pass to "Downtown" Steve
Brown moments later. The catch
was only the second of Brown's
career. Brown and Kenny Wil
liams make up the "angels" who
can get down the field the fastest,
Wiggin said. Brown's only other
reception was a 40-yard touch
down grab against Arizona State
last year.
Stanford fell behind again
before dominating the middle
quarters by scoring on five con

secutive possessions to roll up 30
unanswered points.
"I've believed in this team all
year," Wiggin said. "You can sit
on the sidelines and have all the
confidence in the world, but the
kids on the field have to believe in
themselves.
"I think our offensive line did a
great job against a great de
fense," Wiggin said. "I think our
defense, despite some tackling we
were not thrilled about, played
well. Our defensive line gave up
about 40-50 pounds a man
against their offensive line, but
they stayed in there very well."
The Huskies rallied to a 17-7
lead on an eight-yard touchdown
run by Robinson and a 27-yard
field goal by Nelson, but the
Cardinal quickly grabbed the
momentum for good.
Mike Dotterer grabbed a
pitch-out left, cut it inside
through a gaping hole and raced
46 yards past a stunned and off
balance Washington defense to
close the gap to three points.
Park, who was forced into ac
tion when both Greg Hooper and
Rob Moore sustained injuries
early, drove the blitzing
O'Connor outside and to the
ground and Dotterer cut it up
field and outraced the Husky sec
ondary.
"Don't think the presence of
John Elway doesn't influence
people," Wiggin said. "They
were in a man-to-man coverage
and we caught them in a shift.
They played it very close and
Mike got behind the wall in a
hurry."

When Dotterer turned it up
field, the Washington cor
nerbacks the last defenders,
were still staring at the receivers
and Dotterer "could have waved
at them," Wiggin said.
"Kaulanu Park did a great job
of getting the strong safety
down," Elway said. "Dot saw a
seam, hit it like a rocket and was
gone."
Stanford took the lead for
good on a one-yard run by Dot
terer with 2:05 remaining in the
half and added a 45-yard Mark
Harmon field goal four seconds
before halftime.
The Cardinal took advantage
of another Husky blitz on their
first possession of the second
half. O'Connor blitzed /roip?
strong safety, White picked him
up and Elway threaded a 18-yard

Kevin Baird intercepted a

Vincent White touchdown run to
give Stanford a 20-point lead, but

59 without a miss.

HUNTING FOR HUSKY: Cardinal outside linebacker Garin Veris bears down on Washington
quarterback Steve Pelluer in Stanford's fifth win of the season over the weekend. Veris, a six-foot

catch.
White, backing up as he caught
the ball, cut right and slipped by
two tacklers, rambled back
through the middle of the field
} and a crowd of bodies before out
racing everyone to the goal line.
"He (White) is magic, isn't
he," Wiggin said. "We weren't
going to use him on returns, but
we had a fumble on the last one.
We were just going to have him
fair catch it because he has the
sure hands. I'm glad we didn't."
"After the fumble, I just had to
prepare myself mentally," White
said. "I just started to relax and
have fun out there. I would have

signaled for a fair catch if he
hadn't kicked it so far. He out
kicked his coverage."
Tight end Chris Dressel, who
has been the Cardinal's key man
on third-down situations all year,
caught six passes for 106 yards.
Much of his yardage was picked
up on moves with the ball that
tight ends are not supposed to
have.
"I love that kind of situation
(third down)," Dressel said. "I'm
glad I have been able to fill that
role.
"We had to play our best to
day," Dressel continued. "We
weren't doing that early with the
turnovers, but we rose to the oc
casion. I think we showed a lot of
class."

IT'S CLOBBERIN' TIME: Stanford sophomore Terry Jackson fights off two
Husky blockers in the Cardinal's 43-31 victory over defending Rose Bowl champ

IT'S CLOBBERIN' TIME: Stanford sophomore Terry Jackson fights off two
Husky blockers in the Cardinal's 43-31 victory over defending Rose Bowl champ
Washington Saturday. Jackson, from Washington, D.C., racked up eight tackles

and 1Â½ sacks from his nose guard position in squelching the Huskies's hopes for a
national title. The win puts Stanford in good position for a possible bowl bid.
Stanford abandoned its star
system and rebounded from two
disastrous opening drives that
nearly dumped the game in
Washington's trick-or-treat bag
to upset overwhelmingly the un
defeated No. 2 Huskies 43-31
here Saturday.
The Cardinal offense, mas
querading itself for the first time
all year, mixed the run and the
pass effectively to roll up 437
yards. Mike Dotterer rushed for
106 yards and two touchdowns
while John Elway completed 20-
of-30 passes for 265 yards and
two touchdowns.
Vincent White redeemed
himself after a fumble on the first
play of the game by scooting 76
yards with a magical punt return
touchdown late in the game to
sew up the win. But it was not
these stars that determined the
outcome, coach Paul Wiggin
said.
"Playing like a team had been
one of our goals this year," Wig
gin said. "It hasn't always been
that way. We've had our ups and
downs. Today, we were a team."
The team win was reflected all
the way down to the third men on
the depth chart. Kaulana Park, a

third-team fullback, and Dwain
Hamilton, a would-be redshirt,
were forced into the game by in
juries and played key roles.
The offensive line controlled
the line of scrimmage for the sec
ond week in a row as Stanford
backs pounded out 172 yards on
the ground. The line also gave
Elway time to pick apart the
Husky defense.
"Our offensive line played very
well," Elway said. "If we have
that kind of protection, our of
fense has so many outlets, some
thing is going to work."
Elway called the game "the
biggest win of my career," but the
Cardinal was muddling through
the wet turf early.
White burst for 14 yards up the
middle on his first carry, but
fumbled when he was hit by safe
ty Vince Newsome and Washing
ton's Ron Holmes recovered at
the Stanford 34-yard line.
"I was really tight at the begin
ning," White said. "The play was
wide open, it wasn't much of a
hit. I just fumbled the ball."
Washington's Jacques Rob
inson capped a touchdown drive
with a 13-yard touchdown run
five plays later.
Elway took the snap on the

first play of the next drive and
fired it at Mike Tolliver in the left
flat, but Chris O'Connor stepped
in front to intercept at the Stan
ford 39-yard line. The Huskies
were in position to run away ear
ly, but a blitzing Garin Veris
caught quarterback Steve Pelluer
for an eight-yard loss on third
down moving the Huskies out of
Chuck Nelson's field goal range.
Veris made 14 tackles, includ
ing five for losses, in keying the
defense, which had four intercep
tions.
Stanford finally got unwound
on Washington's next series
when linebacker Kevin Bates
darted in front of a Pelluer pass
to Robinson and made a diving
interception at the Husky 36.
Elway tied the score on a 35-
yard pass to "Downtown" Steve
Brown moments later. The catch
was only the second of Brown's
career. Brown and Kenny Wil
liams make up the "angels" who
can get down the field the fastest,
Wiggin said. Brown's only other
reception was a 40-yard touch
down grab against Arizona State
last year.
Stanford fell behind again
before dominating the middle
quarters by scoring on five con

secutive possessions to roll up 30
unanswered points.
"I've believed in this team all
year," Wiggin said. "You can sit
on the sidelines and have all the
confidence in the world, but the
kids on the field have to believe in
themselves.
"I think our offensive line did a
great job against a great de
fense," Wiggin said. "I think our
defense, despite some tackling we
were not thrilled about, played
well. Our defensive line gave up
about 40-50 pounds a man
against their offensive line, but
they stayed in there very well."
The Huskies rallied to a 17-7
lead on an eight-yard touchdown
run by Robinson and a 27-yard
field goal by Nelson, but the
Cardinal quickly grabbed the
momentum for good.
Mike Dotterer grabbed a
pitch-out left, cut it inside
through a gaping hole and raced
46 yards past a stunned and off
balance Washington defense to
close the gap to three points.
Park, who was forced into ac
tion when both Greg Hooper and
Rob Moore sustained injuries
early, drove the blitzing
O'Connor outside and to the
ground and Dotterer cut it up
field and outraced the Husky sec
ondary.
"Don't think the presence of
John Elway doesn't influence
people," Wiggin said. "They
were in a man-to-man coverage
and we caught them in a shift.
They played it very close and
Mike got behind the wall in a
hurry."

When Dotterer turned it up
field, the Washington cor
nerbacks the last defenders,
were still staring at the receivers
and Dotterer "could have waved
at them," Wiggin said.
"Kaulanu Park did a great job
of getting the strong safety
down," Elway said. "Dot saw a
seam, hit it like a rocket and was
gone."
Stanford took the lead for
good on a one-yard run by Dot
terer with 2:05 remaining in the
half and added a 45-yard Mark
Harmon field goal four seconds
before halftime.

IT'S CLOBBERIN' TIME: Stanford sophomore Terry Jackson fights off two
Husky blockers in the Cardinal's 43-31 victory over defending Rose Bowl champ
Washington Saturday. Jackson, from Washington, D.C., racked up eight tackles

and 1Â½ sacks from his nose guard position in squelching the Huskies's hopes for a
national title. The win puts Stanford in good position for a possible bowl bid.
Stanford abandoned its star
system and rebounded from two
disastrous opening drives that
nearly dumped the game in
Washington's trick-or-treat bag
to upset overwhelmingly the un
defeated No. 2 Huskies 43-31
here Saturday.
The Cardinal offense, mas
querading itself for the first time
all year, mixed the run and the
pass effectively to roll up 437
yards. Mike Dotterer rushed for
106 yards and two touchdowns
while John Elway completed 20-
of-30 passes for 265 yards and
two touchdowns.
Vincent White redeemed
himself after a fumble on the first
play of the game by scooting 76
yards with a magical punt return
touchdown late in the game to
sew up the win. But it was not
these stars that determined the
outcome, coach Paul Wiggin
said.
"Playing like a team had been
one of our goals this year," Wig
gin said. "It hasn't always been
that way. We've had our ups and
downs. Today, we were a team."
The team win was reflected all
the way down to the third men on
the depth chart. Kaulana Park, a

third-team fullback, and Dwain
Hamilton, a would-be redshirt,
were forced into the game by in
juries and played key roles.
The offensive line controlled
the line of scrimmage for the sec
ond week in a row as Stanford
backs pounded out 172 yards on
the ground. The line also gave
Elway time to pick apart the
Husky defense.
"Our offensive line played very
well," Elway said. "If we have
that kind of protection, our of
fense has so many outlets, some
thing is going to work."
Elway called the game "the
biggest win of my career," but the
Cardinal was muddling through
the wet turf early.
White burst for 14 yards up the
middle on his first carry, but
fumbled when he was hit by safe
ty Vince Newsome and Washing
ton's Ron Holmes recovered at
the Stanford 34-yard line.
"I was really tight at the begin
ning," White said. "The play was
wide open, it wasn't much of a
hit. I just fumbled the ball."
Washington's Jacques Rob
inson capped a touchdown drive
with a 13-yard touchdown run
five plays later.
Elway took the snap on the

first play of the next drive and
fired it at Mike Tolliver in the left
flat, but Chris O'Connor stepped
in front to intercept at the Stan
ford 39-yard line. The Huskies
were in position to run away ear
ly, but a blitzing Garin Veris
caught quarterback Steve Pelluer
for an eight-yard loss on third
down moving the Huskies out of
Chuck Nelson's field goal range.
Veris made 14 tackles, includ
ing five for losses, in keying the
defense, which had four intercep
tions.
Stanford finally got unwound
on Washington's next series
when linebacker Kevin Bates
darted in front of a Pelluer pass
to Robinson and made a diving
interception at the Husky 36.
Elway tied the score on a 35-
yard pass to "Downtown" Steve
Brown moments later. The catch
was only the second of Brown's
career. Brown and Kenny Wil
liams make up the "angels" who
can get down the field the fastest,
Wiggin said. Brown's only other
reception was a 40-yard touch
down grab against Arizona State
last year.
Stanford fell behind again
before dominating the middle
quarters by scoring on five con

secutive possessions to roll up 30
unanswered points.
"I've believed in this team all
year," Wiggin said. "You can sit
on the sidelines and have all the
confidence in the world, but the
kids on the field have to believe in
themselves.
"I think our offensive line did a
great job against a great de
fense," Wiggin said. "I think our
defense, despite some tackling we
were not thrilled about, played
well. Our defensive line gave up
about 40-50 pounds a man
against their offensive line, but
they stayed in there very well."
The Huskies rallied to a 17-7
lead on an eight-yard touchdown
run by Robinson and a 27-yard
field goal by Nelson, but the
Cardinal quickly grabbed the
momentum for good.
Mike Dotterer grabbed a
pitch-out left, cut it inside
through a gaping hole and raced
46 yards past a stunned and off
balance Washington defense to
close the gap to three points.
Park, who was forced into ac
tion when both Greg Hooper and
Rob Moore sustained injuries
early, drove the blitzing
O'Connor outside and to the
ground and Dotterer cut it up
field and outraced the Husky sec
ondary.
"Don't think the presence of
John Elway doesn't influence
people," Wiggin said. "They
were in a man-to-man coverage
and we caught them in a shift.
They played it very close and
Mike got behind the wall in a
hurry."

When Dotterer turned it up
field, the Washington cor
nerbacks the last defenders,
were still staring at the receivers
and Dotterer "could have waved
at them," Wiggin said.
"Kaulanu Park did a great job
of getting the strong safety
down," Elway said. "Dot saw a
seam, hit it like a rocket and was
gone."
Stanford took the lead for
good on a one-yard run by Dot
terer with 2:05 remaining in the
half and added a 45-yard Mark
Harmon field goal four seconds
before halftime.
The Cardinal took advantage
of another Husky blitz on their
first possession of the second
half. O'Connor blitzed /roip?
strong safety, White picked him
up and Elway threaded a 18-yard

Kevin Baird intercepted a

Vincent White touchdown run to
give Stanford a 20-point lead, but

59 without a miss.

HUNTING FOR HUSKY: Cardinal outside linebacker Garin Veris bears down on Washington
quarterback Steve Pelluer in Stanford's fifth win of the season over the weekend. Veris, a six-foot

catch.
White, backing up as he caught
the ball, cut right and slipped by
two tacklers, rambled back
through the middle of the field
} and a crowd of bodies before out
racing everyone to the goal line.
"He (White) is magic, isn't
he," Wiggin said. "We weren't
going to use him on returns, but
we had a fumble on the last one.
We were just going to have him
fair catch it because he has the
sure hands. I'm glad we didn't."
"After the fumble, I just had to
prepare myself mentally," White
said. "I just started to relax and
have fun out there. I would have

signaled for a fair catch if he
hadn't kicked it so far. He out
kicked his coverage."
Tight end Chris Dressel, who
has been the Cardinal's key man
on third-down situations all year,
caught six passes for 106 yards.
Much of his yardage was picked
up on moves with the ball that
tight ends are not supposed to
have.
"I love that kind of situation
(third down)," Dressel said. "I'm
glad I have been able to fill that
role.
"We had to play our best to
day," Dressel continued. "We
weren't doing that early with the
turnovers, but we rose to the oc
casion. I think we showed a lot of
class."

yard pass to "Downtown" Steve
Brown moments later. The catch
was only the second of Brown's
career. Brown and Kenny Wil
liams make up the "angels" who
can get down the field the fastest,
Wiggin said. Brown's only other
reception was a 40-yard touch
down grab against Arizona State
last year.
Stanford fell behind again
before dominating the middle
quarters by scoring on five con

secutive possessions to roll up 30
unanswered points.
"I've believed in this team all
year," Wiggin said. "You can sit
on the sidelines and have all the
confidence in the world, but the
kids on the field have to believe in
themselves.
"I think our offensive line did a
great job against a great de
fense," Wiggin said. "I think our
defense, despite some tackling we
were not thrilled about, played
well. Our defensive line gave up
about 40-50 pounds a man
against their offensive line, but
they stayed in there very well."
The Huskies rallied to a 17-7
lead on an eight-yard touchdown
run by Robinson and a 27-yard
field goal by Nelson, but the
Cardinal quickly grabbed the
momentum for good.
Mike Dotterer grabbed a
pitch-out left, cut it inside
through a gaping hole and raced
46 yards past a stunned and off
balance Washington defense to
close the gap to three points.
Park, who was forced into ac
tion when both Greg Hooper and
Rob Moore sustained injuries
early, drove the blitzing
O'Connor outside and to the
ground and Dotterer cut it up
field and outraced the Husky sec
ondary.
"Don't think the presence of
John Elway doesn't influence
people," Wiggin said. "They
were in a man-to-man coverage
and we caught them in a shift.
They played it very close and
Mike got behind the wall in a
hurry."

When Dotterer turned it up
field, the Washington cor
nerbacks the last defenders,
were still staring at the receivers
and Dotterer "could have waved
at them," Wiggin said.
"Kaulanu Park did a great job
of getting the strong safety
down," Elway said. "Dot saw a
seam, hit it like a rocket and was
gone."
Stanford took the lead for
good on a one-yard run by Dot
terer with 2:05 remaining in the
half and added a 45-yard Mark
Harmon field goal four seconds
before halftime.

catch.
White, backing up as he caught
the ball, cut right and slipped by
two tacklers, rambled back
through the middle of the field

racing everyone to the goal line.
"He (White) is magic, isn't
he," Wiggin said. "We weren't
going to use him on returns, but
we had a fumble on the last one.
We were just going to have him
fair catch it because he has the
sure hands. I'm glad we didn't."
"After the fumble, I just had to
prepare myself mentally," White
said. "I just started to relax and
have fun out there. I would have

signaled for a fair catch if he
hadn't kicked it so far. He out
kicked his coverage."
Tight end Chris Dressel, who
has been the Cardinal's key man
on third-down situations all year,
caught six passes for 106 yards.
Much of his yardage was picked
up on moves with the ball that
tight ends are not supposed to
have.
"I love that kind of situation
(third down)," Dressel said. "I'm
glad I have been able to fill that
role.
"We had to play our best to
day," Dressel continued. "We
weren't doing that early with the
turnovers, but we rose to the oc
casion. I think we showed a lot of
class."

IT'S CLOBBERIN' TIME: Stanford sophomore Terry Jackson fights off two
Husky blockers in the Cardinal's 43-31 victory over defending Rose Bowl champ
Washington Saturday. Jackson, from Washington, D.C., racked up eight tackles

and 1Â½ sacks from his nose guard position in squelching the Huskies's hopes for a
national title. The win puts Stanford in good position for a possible bowl bid.
Stanford abandoned its star
system and rebounded from two
disastrous opening drives that
nearly dumped the game in
Washington's trick-or-treat bag
to upset overwhelmingly the un
defeated No. 2 Huskies 43-31
here Saturday.
The Cardinal offense, mas
querading itself for the first time
all year, mixed the run and the
pass effectively to roll up 437
yards. Mike Dotterer rushed for
106 yards and two touchdowns
while John Elway completed 20-
of-30 passes for 265 yards and
two touchdowns.
Vincent White redeemed
himself after a fumble on the first
play of the game by scooting 76
yards with a magical punt return
touchdown late in the game to
sew up the win. But it was not
these stars that determined the
outcome, coach Paul Wiggin
said.
"Playing like a team had been
one of our goals this year," Wig
gin said. "It hasn't always been
that way. We've had our ups and
downs. Today, we were a team."
The team win was reflected all
the way down to the third men on
the depth chart. Kaulana Park, a

third-team fullback, and Dwain
Hamilton, a would-be redshirt,
were forced into the game by in
juries and played key roles.
The offensive line controlled
the line of scrimmage for the sec
ond week in a row as Stanford
backs pounded out 172 yards on
the ground. The line also gave
Elway time to pick apart the
Husky defense.
"Our offensive line played very
well," Elway said. "If we have
that kind of protection, our of
fense has so many outlets, some
thing is going to work."
Elway called the game "the
biggest win of my career," but the
Cardinal was muddling through
the wet turf early.
White burst for 14 yards up the
middle on his first carry, but
fumbled when he was hit by safe
ty Vince Newsome and Washing
ton's Ron Holmes recovered at
the Stanford 34-yard line.
"I was really tight at the begin
ning," White said. "The play was
wide open, it wasn't much of a
hit. I just fumbled the ball."
Washington's Jacques Rob
inson capped a touchdown drive
with a 13-yard touchdown run
five plays later.
Elway took the snap on the

first play of the next drive and
fired it at Mike Tolliver in the left
flat, but Chris O'Connor stepped
in front to intercept at the Stan
ford 39-yard line. The Huskies
were in position to run away ear
ly, but a blitzing Garin Veris
caught quarterback Steve Pelluer
for an eight-yard loss on third
down moving the Huskies out of
Chuck Nelson's field goal range.
Veris made 14 tackles, includ
ing five for losses, in keying the
defense, which had four intercep
tions.
Stanford finally got unwound
on Washington's next series
when linebacker Kevin Bates
darted in front of a Pelluer pass
to Robinson and made a diving
interception at the Husky 36.
Elway tied the score on a 35-
yard pass to "Downtown" Steve
Brown moments later. The catch
was only the second of Brown's
career. Brown and Kenny Wil
liams make up the "angels" who
can get down the field the fastest,
Wiggin said. Brown's only other
reception was a 40-yard touch
down grab against Arizona State
last year.
Stanford fell behind again
before dominating the middle
quarters by scoring on five con

secutive possessions to roll up 30
unanswered points.
"I've believed in this team all
