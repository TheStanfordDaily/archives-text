# V.W.'s jazzy return

### ADAM BERNS 
Stanford running back Vincent White, longtime protege of
Darrin Nelson, may have taught his dancing teacher a move or
two.
Re-enacting his own version of the jitterbug, White ran back
a 76-yard punt return in the fourth quarter to ice the game for
the Cardinal.
Nelson watched the game from the stands and was as im
pressed as anyone by White's touchdown return. Asked to com
pare it with similar feats he performed on the same field, Nelson
joked, "I've never returned a punt for a touchdown."
In fact, no Cardinal has since 1975. The run was the longest in
modern Stamford history (Murray Cuddleback's 80-yard re
turn against the Olympic Club in 1923 is the only one longer)
and ranks as one of the greatest runs in Stanford history.
With 5:30 left in the game and Stanford still clinging to a
37-24 lead, Washington's Jeff Partridge punted 57 yards. White
took the ball on the Stanford 24, made some nice fakes and then
raced up the right sideline. He then cut back left, made a magnif
icent move on Washington's Aaron Williams and raced up the
left side for the score.
Wait a minute. Washington is supposed to win with special
teams play. It is the team that works so hard on the kicking
game in practice.
But this did not look like a Washington punt return. There
was not a blocking scheme set up, and White received only one
significant block.

White's run was almost the punt return that wasn't.
Not only was he not scheduled to bring back punts, but when he
did go in, he had instructions to make a fair catch.
"This week I wasn't suppose to do punt returns," White said
after the game. "On all safe punts, we're supposed to fair catch
the football. The guy just outkicked his coverage and I knew I'd
have room to run the ball."
White virtually ran through the entire Husky team and juked
at least four individuals who had clear shots at him. It was only
when he made his last cutback to the left that White even
thought about the possibility of scoring. "Once I got to the
kicker I felt that I could go all the way," he said.
"He's magic, isn't he," Paul Wiggin told a group of reporters
after the game. "His shoulder now is 100 percent. We put him in
because he is a sure-handed guy and we had fumbled the ball
earlier."
