to contest for the championship. "I'm very pleased that we were
able to win on our maiden voyage," Stanford coach Brooks
Johnson said. "It was gratifying to have our lowest score of the
year in the biggest meet of the year.
"I'm happy that the first Stanford team that contested in this
conference won it," Johnson continued. "It is a prophecy of
things to come. I feel Stanford will eventually end up being the
number one women's athletic department in the country."
The men, running without top freshman Ryan Stoll, ran a
weak race. Jim Smith finished 10th in 32:12, Charles Alexander
