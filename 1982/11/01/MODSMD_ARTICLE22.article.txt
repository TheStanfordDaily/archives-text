### CHRIS ADDINGTON 
Halloween turned out to be
three treats and one trick for the
Stanford water polo team yester
day as they finished in a tie for
second place at the Pacif
ic- 10/ Pacific Coast Athletic As
sociation interconference tour
nament at the Belmont Plaza
Natatorium in Long Beach.
Stanford, playing each of the
top four teams in the PCAA,
came away with three victories
and a loss to No. 1 UC-Irvine,
moving its record to 20-4 and re
taining its No. 2 ranking. .
"They got a lot of good
breaks," said Stanford head
coach Dante Dettamanti after
the Irvine game. "Three or four
of their goals came from their
being in the right place at the
right time."
Whatever the breaks, the final
result in the third match-up this
season between these two water
polo powerhouses was Irvine 7-3,
leaving the Anteaters secure with

their No. 1 ranking and a perfect
17-0 collegiate record.
Irvine started the contest with
a single goal in the first period
and increased that lead to 3-1 by
halftime.
The teams traded goals, even
tually putting the score at 4-3 ear
ly in the final period. But Irvine
exploded for three more, two of
them coming in the final minute
of play.
Stanford shot only 3-for-21,
due largely to the excellent de
fense of Irvine goalie John
O'Brien, who is considered by
many to be the NCAA's most ef
fective goaltender.
Senior Jeff Stiling scored twice
for Stanford on man-up situ
ations, and sophomore Tom
Lampert tallied the other goal for
the Cardinal.
When asked about the shut
out of Stanford's leading scorer
James Bergeson, Dettamanti
said, "Irvine knows Bergeson's
moves, but they can't shut him

down forever. We'll just change
his drive."
Bergeson more than made up
for his lack of points against UCI
by scoring 11 goals in the next
three games as Stanford beat
Long Beach State 13-5, Santa
Barbara 15-5 and Pepperdine
17-9.
Dettamanti praised the play of
his bench in Stanford's final three
contests. "The bench played real
ly well," he said. "Nearly ev
eryone scored and most of them
played at least one half per
game."
The bench was its finest
against UC-Santa Barbara as 10
Cardinal players broke into the
scoring column.
Irvine won the tourney with a
4-0 record, while Stanford tied
for second with UCLA and USC.
Rounding out the bottom four
were Cal at 2-2, UCSB at 1-3 and
Long Beach and Pepperdine,
each at 0-4.
