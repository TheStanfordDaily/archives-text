# Cardinal booters tie No. 6 USF
## 
### JOHN KELLY 
When the Stanford soccer team matched up against the sixth
ranked University of San Francisco yesterday in front of 1000 fans at
Maloney Field, it was a Struggle of soccer opposites.
It was a battle of strength against speed, rugged aggressiveness and
team play against flashy dribbling and individual talent, an unranked
yet obstinate contender against a perennial champion.
The result was a 0-0 tie, one which helps Stanford's chances of gain
ing a berth in the play-offs. The Cardinal now stands at 12-4-2 for the
season.
Both teams played cautiously at the outset, showing reluctance to
press forward in case of a counter-attacking goal by the opposition.
The only dangerous shots came from far outside of the penalty area,
shots which were easily handled by both goalkeepers. Eventually,
however, Stanford began to dominate, coming up with shots that were
not far off target.
The first of the Cardinal's opportunities occurred when midfielder
Walter Kingson made a strong tackle near midfield, causing the ball to
rebound toward striker Jorge Titinger, who sprinted toward the USF
goal with defenders in hasty pursuit. As USF goalkeeper Aram
Kardzair came flying out of the goal, Titinger tried to slip the ball be
tween his legs, but the ball nicked off of Kardzair's leg and slid by the
goal.
Titinger threatened again moments later by teaming up on a give
and-go pass combination with Rob West. As Titinger received the re
turn head pass from West, he thundered a point-blank shot at goal,
which was saved by Kardzair.
The second half was more of the same with Stanford creating anoth
er scoring opportunity early in the period. Angel Vazquez curled a
dipping ball across the middle which Kardzair could not handle, and a
flying Mark Talkington volley just missed.
Some quick and controlled passing in the midfield by Kingson and
Vazquez led to a penetrating pass through to striker Todd Rafalovich,
who beat a defender to the ball and then tried unsuccessfully to chip
the ball over the onrushing Kardzair. The only thing which stopped
the needed goal for Stanford was the outstanding play of Kardzair and
a devastating offsides trap led by sweeper Erik Neilsen which caught
Stanford again and again.
It was near the end of regulation time that USF had its best
chance of the afternoon, when some clever dribbling by Enrique Ingles
led him by several defenders. Ingles then pushed a ball past onrushing
Stanford goalie Willie Burkhardt which seemed sure to go in, if it were
not for a sliding Angel Vazquez, who caught the ball on the goaline
and cleared it out of danger.
The overtime period did not produce anything new. Both teams
seemed content to play defensive ball, with an occasional though not
dangerous thrust forward.
