# Card kilters take pair over weekend

The rain finally quit but a fine
drizzle hung over Roble field.
The area in front of the Univer
sity of Pacific goal cage was a
quagmire from the soaked action

of the first half of field hockey.
Early in the second half,
sophomore Stanford forward
Jennifer Bleakley engaged the
UOP goalie on the slick patch in

front of the goal.
Bleakley fired a shot which re
bounded off the goalie's pads and
lay in front of her in the mud. A
quick flick and the ball was past
the goalie and defenders but lay
stuck in the mud just outside the
goal line. Without hesitation
Bleakley dove in and finally
pushed the stubborn ball in the
net, providing Stanford with the
winning goal in the Cardinal's
final home game of the season
and concluding a two-victory
weekend.
The UOP game was put away
with eight minutes remaining
when Stanford forward Valerie
Jackson rushed the ball into the
circle and made a reverse-stick
pass to a waiting Terri Boyle who
slid the mud-caked ball into the
vacated goalcage.
The Cardinal, which has been
improving steadily throughout
the season, put together its finest
team effort to date in attaining
the 2-0 victory over traditionally
tough UOP. The weather condi
tions contributed to an amazing
56 shots on goal by Stanford.
"With all the mud, the ball
doesn't rebound off of the goal
ie's pads and stays inside the goal
area," explained Stanford coach
Onnie Killefer. "It makes it very
tough on the goalie."
"The defense was aggressive,
we passed the ball well at high

speed and the attack was able to
combine and use everything that
the team has been working on
throughout the season," added
pleased assistant coach Rachel
Smith.
Although they stressed that the
win was due to the exceptional
team effort, both Killefer and
Smith lauded the individual play
of Bleakley, Boyle and senior de
fender Becky Howell. Howell
consistently came up with the
ball in key defensive situations
while Bleakley played "the best
game of her career," according to
Killefer.
In the contest against Cal
State-Long Beach the previous
day, the Cardinal beat the 49'ers
for the second time this season by
a 1-0 score. The lone goal came
with 14 minutes gone in the sec
ond half. Junior midfielder Mary
Donahue smashed the ball into
the goal on a short corner,
stopped by Howell.
The Cardinal is currently third
in the Norpac conference behind
No. 6-ranked Berkeley and No.
13 San Jose State. The post-sea
son situation is unclear for the
team. A possible wild card berth
at nationals might very well hinge
on the outcome of San Jose State
lowa game this weekend. An up
set by San Jose over the No. 1
Hawkeyes could secure a
Cardinal bid.
