The fourth-ranked Stanford women's volleyball
team upped its record to 7-2 in league play and 18-5
overall with wins over conference foe Cal State-
Fullerton and non-conference rival San Jose State
Friday and Saturday nights in Maples Pavilion.
After easily winning the first two games against
San Jose State, 15-8 and 15-4, the Cardinal took the
toughly-contested third game, 15-13, on a kill by
sophomore substitute outside hitter Lisa Murphy.
The Spartans had jumped to a quick 5-2 advantage,
three points coming on Cardinal errors.
Stanford came back, however, and another
Murphy smash knotted the game at 5-5. The
Cardinal was not able to take the lead, though, until
a smash by Spartan senior middle blocker Jodi
Breding sailed long and put the score at 8-7. Again,
San Jose came back and tied the score at 13-13 on a
service ace by senior setter Joyce Sprout. The
Cardinal and Spartans then exchanged three
straight side-outs in a pressure-packed finale until a

Spartan smash went out to give the Cardinal a 14-13
lead. The teams exchanged side-outs once more un
til Murphy's match-winning smash.
Stanford easily handled overmatched Fullerton,
winning in three games. The Cardinal took the third
and deciding game 15-6. Stanford jumped to a 13-5
lead in the first game, until stricken by overcon
fidence, the Cardinal faltered until the Titans tied
the score at 14-14. The Stanford bench, however,
was able to salvage the game, winning 16-14. The
slow second game, whose highlight was a game-de
laying appearance by the Band, saw the Cardinal
empty its bench in a 15-7 victory.
"The bench came in and did a great job the last
two games," said Stanford assistant coach Don
Shaw.
Tonight, the Cardinal takes on No. 2-ranked
University of Hawaii, and Wednesday, No. 3 Uni
versity of Pacific in non-conference matches at 7:30
at Maples. "It's just two more really good teams
just like the rest of our schedule," said Shaw.
