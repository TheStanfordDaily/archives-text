# Daily Softball triumphs
## 
### 
A steady hitting attack combined
with a nearly flawless defense lifted the
Daily softball team to an 8-3 victory
yesterday over the Professional Jour
nalism Fellows' (PJF) team, whose
members appeared overmatched and
slightly overweight.
The PJFs also displayed surprising
defensive acumen, but made mental
mistakes which quashed most of their
scoring bids. In spite of the loss, PJF
team captain Harry Press considered
the fact that the team was able to run
around the field on a Sunday morning a
moral victory.
