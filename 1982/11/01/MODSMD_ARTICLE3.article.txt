# Campaign controversy
## Funds spark debate 
### MIKE HALE Senior staff writer 
Campaign funds where they come
from and how they are raised have
become the major issue during the last
days of the 11th District race, one of the
most expensive congressional cam
paigns in the country.
Incumbent Rep. Tom Lantos' (D-
San Mateo) campaign manager,

Katrina Lan
tos-Swett, es
timated this
weekend that
Lantos' fund
raising total
for the 1982

campaign will be $l.l million, more
than any other congressional candidate
this year. His Republican opponent,
Bill Royer, has raised approximately
$550,000, according to Royer aides
making him one of the 40 most suc
cessful fund raisers among con
gressional candidates nationwide.
At an Oct. 18 press conference with
Royer, outgoing 12th District Rep. Pete
McCloskey (R-Menlo Park) accused
Lantos of raising the bulk of his cam
paign money from Jewish groups across
the country. Royer, at the same press
conference, said more than 90 percent
of Lantos' funds came from outside of
the 11th District.
"The question of money coming
from outside the district is a very seri
ous issue," McCloskey said. "Con
gressmen respond to those who con
tribute large jsums of money to cam
paigns."
Lantos has maintained that only 50
percent of his contributions come from
out of the district, and said Mc-
Closkey's comments regarding Jewish
community sources did "not merit the
dignity of an answer."
Last week, Lantos sent out a district
wide mailing detailing alleged contribu
tions to Rover's campaign from major
oil corporations. The release named 14
oil companies, and accused Royer of
being too responsive to the needs of
business.
Royer staff members contacted this
weekend discounted the Lantos mailer,
which they called "his latest hit-piece."
Press secretary Gary Godbey said only
10 of the 14 companies listed actually
gave Royer money, and that their con
tributions totalled $lB,OOO, or about 3
percent of the Royer campaign chest.

Godbey struck back at Lantos,
claiming that Signal Oil, one of the
companies named, actually gave Lan
tos $5OO. He also claimed that following
speeches in Oklahoma, Lantos raised
$19,000 for his campaign from oil in
terests.
Godbey and Royer Campaign Man
ager Robert Martini also stood by Mc-
Closkey's and Royer's original claims.
Godbey called the disparity in figures
regarding Lantos' out-of-district fund
raising "a matter of semantics." He said
Lantos arrives at the 50 percent esti
mate by counting contributors, while
Royer's figure is based on dollar
amounts of contributions.
Godbey added that Royer's original
claim of 90 percent out-of-district fund
ing for Lantos has been amended to 75
percent in light of recent Federal Elec
tion Commission (FEC) figures.
Lantos-Swett said that, while she did
not have exact figures available, "the
vast majority of contributions are from
within the district and from within the
vicinity of the district." She said the
within-the-district figure, in terms of
contributors, would be "close to 70 per
cent."
She added that the political action
committees (PACs) who contribute to
Lantos tend to be "membership"
groups who act on the recommenda
tions of their local chapters.
"I would consider that money local
in terms of the kind of support it repre
sents," she said, even if the group has
headquarters elsewhere.

She named the National Education
Association, the National Association
of Retired Federal Employees and the
Sierra Club as "membership" groups
that had made major contributions to
the Lantos campaign.
"I would be delighted to have our
contributions and his contributions
compared source by source anytime,"
Lantos-Swett said.
Godbey and Martini were adamant
on the issue of Jewish community
sources of Lantos' funds.
"For the most part what he (Mc-
Closkey) says is true," Martini said.
"Everyone has $lOOO-$2OOO con
tributors, but they represent different
interests. In this case, there's one in
terest."

News analysis

Godbey went further, saying, "Tom
Lantos is 100 percent in the hip-pocket
ofMenachem Begin."
Godbey claimed that research done
by the Royer staff showed there was a
direct correspondance between the
dates of Lantos speeches before Jewish
groups and the dates of large contribu
tions to the Lantos campaign. Godbey
quoted Lantos as telling these groups he
was "the conscience of the Jewish com
munity in Congress" and soliciting
them to "double and triple their politi
cal contributions."
Martini, claiming that $lOO,OOO has
been contributed to the Lantos cam
paign by groups and individuals from
New York, said "why should people in
New York give $lOOO to a con
gressional candidate in California?"
"I don't want to make a necessary
connection between ethnicity and last
names," Godbey said, "but if you could
see the lists (of Lantos contributors),
you'd know what I mean."
Lantos-Swett said it was "highly in
appropriate" and "of questionable
public acceptability" for Royer's staff
"to suggest that any individual's cam
paign support be analyzed on the basis
of the last names of their contributors."
"They can't name a single Jewish
group that has contributed" to the Lan
tos campaign, she said, "because there
aren't any." She said major Jewish or
ganizations, such as the United Jewish
Appeal, do not make political contribu
tions.
She said Martini's $lOO,OOO claim for
Lantos contributions from New York
was probably "way off as well all

their others have been incorrect."
Reiterating her claim that Lantos
support comes largely from within the
district, Lantos-Swett said, "Precisely
for that reason, Tom is not beholden as
is Mr. Royer to big oil companies and
conservative PACs and big corpo
rations these are the people who have
contributed to Royer's campaign."
Beneath the claims and counter
claims about money, remarks made by
each of the campaign managers this
past weekend may point to what has be
come the real issue in the race.
Lanto-Swett said that in contrast to
Lantos' "positive, upbeat, issue-ori
ented campaign," Royer had
ducted a "negative, smearing cam
paign. The contrast is stark and startl
ing."
Martini, who has run campaigns for
other candidates, said, "I usually like
the opponent," but in regard to Lantos
said, "I have never disliked anyone
more. I think he's dangerous."
"It's been an interesting campaign,"
Martini said.
