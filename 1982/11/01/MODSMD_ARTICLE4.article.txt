Syria renews missile attacks in Lebanon
Beirut, Lebanon Syrian forces fired anti-aircraft missiles at Israeli jets
over eastern Lebanon yesterday and Christian militiamen and Moslem
gunmen battled in Lebanon's central mountains before a truce took hold.
The Israeli command in Tel Aviv said two missiles were fired from Syrian
territory and narrowly missed the reconnaissance jets in a "grave violation"
of the cease-fire that went into effect at the end of July.
Correspondent Louis Fares, who was in the village of Barr Elias near the
Syrian-Lebanese border, said he saw the missiles fired and heard two ex
plosions as they streaked through the skies toward the jets.
He said the missiles appeared to have been fired from the Syrian side of the
border, not far from eastern Lebanon's Bekaa Valley. Missiles fired from
Syria downed an Israeli Phantom jet July 24 before the cease-fire.
Israel has intensified its reconnaissance flights over eastern Lebanon fol
lowing reports Syria had introduced new missile launchers in the area. Israel
has reported destroying more than 20 missile batteries in Bekaa but has not
acted yet against missiles based just inside Syria's border.
Israel invaded Lebanon June 6 in a drive against the Palestine Liberation
Organization. Thousands of guerrillas were evacuated from west Beirut in
August but thousands more remain behind Syrian lines in eastern Lebanon.
Spaniards hail pope's first visit ever
Madrid Pope John Paul II was greeted in Madrid yesterday, at the start
of the first visit to Spain by a reigning pontiff, with a mix of official pomp and
joyous scenes of popular enthusiasm.
King Juan Carlos, who greeted John Paul with a handshake, said in a wel
come address that the 10-day papal visit came at a moment of national "anx
iety but also of hope," because "Spain is determined to live in harmony."
In his prepared statement, the pope urged Spanish Catholics to recover
their religious vigor and faith and said this would be one of the principal aims
of his trip, which will take him to 16 cities and small towns.
He reminded his listeners that Spain had historically acted as a principal
buttress of Roman Catholicism and he praised Spain's missionary zeal in
earlier ages. His remarks appeared to indicate a close identification of the
pope with a Spanish bishops' report, issued to coincide with the visit, that
complained of falling church attendance, few vocations for the priesthood
and increasingly lax moral standards.
The visit comes at a fascinating crossroads in Spain; the pontiff has arrived
following the Socialist triumph after 40 years of that party's persecution, ex
ile and opposition.
Specific issues separating the incoming Socialist government and the
Spanish religious authorities include plans for a relaxation of bans against
abortion, public funding of contraception and new education guidelines
which some Catholics say could constrain religious teaching in schools.
Right rejects rebel offer
San Salvador, El Salvador A call for peace talks from El Salvador's lef
tist rebels has provoked an angry backlash from this country's powerful
right wing, dealing a setback to what seemed like improving chances for a
negotiated end to the three-year-old civil war.
The political reversal has further soured the atmosphere here and com
promised President Alvaro Magana's U.S.-backed efforts to channel leftist
opposition from guerrilla warfare into a constitutional political process lead
ing to elections scheduled for the spring of 1984.
