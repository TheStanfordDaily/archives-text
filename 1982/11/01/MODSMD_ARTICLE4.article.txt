Syria renews missile attacks in Lebanon
Beirut, Lebanon Syrian forces fired anti-aircraft missiles at Israeli jets
over eastern Lebanon yesterday and Christian militiamen and Moslem
gunmen battled in Lebanon's central mountains before a truce took hold.
The Israeli command in Tel Aviv said two missiles were fired from Syrian
territory and narrowly missed the reconnaissance jets in a "grave violation"
of the cease-fire that went into effect at the end of July.
Correspondent Louis Fares, who was in the village of Barr Elias near the
Syrian-Lebanese border, said he saw the missiles fired and heard two ex
plosions as they streaked through the skies toward the jets.
He said the missiles appeared to have been fired from the Syrian side of the
border, not far from eastern Lebanon's Bekaa Valley. Missiles fired from
Syria downed an Israeli Phantom jet July 24 before the cease-fire.
Israel has intensified its reconnaissance flights over eastern Lebanon fol
lowing reports Syria had introduced new missile launchers in the area. Israel
has reported destroying more than 20 missile batteries in Bekaa but has not
acted yet against missiles based just inside Syria's border.
Israel invaded Lebanon June 6 in a drive against the Palestine Liberation
Organization. Thousands of guerrillas were evacuated from west Beirut in
August but thousands more remain behind Syrian lines in eastern Lebanon.
Spaniards hail pope's first visit ever
Madrid Pope John Paul II was greeted in Madrid yesterday, at the start
of the first visit to Spain by a reigning pontiff, with a mix of official pomp and
joyous scenes of popular enthusiasm.
King Juan Carlos, who greeted John Paul with a handshake, said in a wel
come address that the 10-day papal visit came at a moment of national "anx
iety but also of hope," because "Spain is determined to live in harmony."
In his prepared statement, the pope urged Spanish Catholics to recover
their religious vigor and faith and said this would be one of the principal aims
of his trip, which will take him to 16 cities and small towns.
He reminded his listeners that Spain had historically acted as a principal
buttress of Roman Catholicism and he praised Spain's missionary zeal in
earlier ages. His remarks appeared to indicate a close identification of the
pope with a Spanish bishops' report, issued to coincide with the visit, that
complained of falling church attendance, few vocations for the priesthood
and increasingly lax moral standards.
The visit comes at a fascinating crossroads in Spain; the pontiff has arrived
following the Socialist triumph after 40 years of that party's persecution, ex
ile and opposition.
Specific issues separating the incoming Socialist government and the
Spanish religious authorities include plans for a relaxation of bans against
abortion, public funding of contraception and new education guidelines
which some Catholics say could constrain religious teaching in schools.
Right rejects rebel offer
San Salvador, El Salvador A call for peace talks from El Salvador's lef
tist rebels has provoked an angry backlash from this country's powerful
right wing, dealing a setback to what seemed like improving chances for a
negotiated end to the three-year-old civil war.
The political reversal has further soured the atmosphere here and com
promised President Alvaro Magana's U.S.-backed efforts to channel leftist
opposition from guerrilla warfare into a constitutional political process lead
ing to elections scheduled for the spring of 1984.
As a result, prospects seem as clouded as ever for
a swift end to the fighting, which in a three-week
rebel offensive in eastern El Salvador has killed or
wounded several hundred more soldiers and civil
ians this month.
"The word 'negotiations' has long been im
possible here," U.S. Ambassador Deane Hinton
said in an interview. "Now the question is whether
the word 'dialogue' also will become impossible af
ter all this."
"All this" began about two weeks ago when
Magana received private peace proposals from the
insurgent leadership, reportedly through officials
of El Salvador's politically active Roman Catholic
Church.
The feeler arrived in the name of the Revolu
tionary Democratic Front, the overall rebel politi
cal group, and the Farabundo Marti National Lib
eration Front, the umbrella organization of five
anti-government guerrilla groups.
Hinton had told an interviewer for the London
Times that he was "relatively optimistic" about
chances for such a dialogue, probably through
third parties such as the Costa Ricans or the
church.
His remarks caused a storm here, generating at
tacks by leaders of the Chamber of Commerce and
the Salvadoran Industrialists Association. Both
groups include businessmen and personages close
ly identified with El Salvador's extreme right,
which cqnsiders the guerrillas "criminal terrorists"
best dealt with by high-powered rifles.
Grimmer nuclear mishap tolls
Washington The most detailed government
study of potential consequences of accidents at
atomic power plants has concluded that the worst
case death toll could exceed 100,000 and damage
could top $3OO billion at certain locations, accord
ing to documents obtained by The Washington
Post.
The new estimates, which greatly surpass the
worst-case estimate of 3300 early deaths and $l4
billion in property damage contained in the Nucle
ar Regulatory Commission's last safety study is
sued in 1975, come from a study conducted for the
commission by Sandia National Laboratories.
A sophisticated computer model, called
CRAC2, used the most comprehensive
meteorological, population and economic data
ever assembled to calculate for the first time a wide

variety of possible accident consequences for each
of the 80 sites in the United States where atomic
power plants are operating or are under construc
tion.
The worst-case scenario postulated in the study
is based on what the commission calls a "Group 1"
accident, one involving severe core damage, melt
ing of uranium fuel, essential failure of all safety
systems and a major breach of the reactor's con
tainment resulting in a large release of radio
activity into the atmosphere.
The NRC staff has estimated the probability of
such an accident which would be far more severe
than the 1979 Three Mile Island accident, which re
mains the nation's mot serious as 1 in 100,000
reactor years. Given the number of atomic power
plants operating or planned, this would mean there
is approximately a 2 percent chance of such an ac
cident occurring in the United States before the
year 2000.
Parties duel for Senate majority
Washington With the elections close at hand,
Republicans are locked in a tight race with Demo
crats for the Senate and are "holding on by their
fingernails" to the majority they won two years
ago, the chairman of the Senate Democratic Cam
paign Committee said Sunday.
Sen. Wendell Ford (D-Ky.) said that Democrats
have upset the scenario Republicans once en
visioned for a gain of up to 10 Senate seats in the
off-year election and are within striking distance of
recapturing control.
"I think our prospects of doing well in the races
for the Senate are good," Ford said. "You find all
the Democratic incumbents safe, and the Re
publican incumbents are the ones in a tight race.
The Republicans are holding on by their finger
nails."
But Sen. Robert Dole (R-Kan.) interviewed with
Ford on the CBS-TV program "Face the Nation,"
predicted that Republicans would retain their hold
on the Senate and possibly pick up two additional
seats. Republicans currently have a 54-45 edge
over Democrats in the Senate.
"We need to add to our numbers this year, but
let's face it, the economy has not responded, re
cession has lasted longer, unemployment has gone
up," Dole said. "So perhaps if we hold our own,
it'll be perceived as a victory around the country."

Indo-Pakistani rulers to meet
New Delhi, India Pakistan's President Zia ul-
Haq and India's Prime Minister Indira Gandhi will
meet here briefly today in what many regard as the
most significant attempt in nearly a decade to re
solve longstanding differences between their coun
tries.
The meeting, described officially in both coun
tries as no more than a stopover at the beginning of
a visit by Zia to Southeast Asia, will be the first be
tween Indian and Pakistani leaders since 1972.
Zia is scheduled to be on the ground in New Del
hi for just three hours. Officials of both countries
say that there is no formal agenda and that there
will be no breakthrough in Indo-Pakistani rela
tions.
However, hope has been expressed that the
meeting will give new impetus to a year-old
dialogue that began with a Pakistani proposal, in
September 1981, for a "no-war pact."
The importance of some sort of accord goes far
beyond this part of the world. India has already ex
ploded a nuclear device and Pakistan is trying to
develop a similar ability. Since Pakistan proposed
the no-war pact, India has proposed a friendship
treaty and also suggested that a joint economic and
cultural commission be formed to promote more
nonpolitical contacts.
The potential for progress in Monday's talks is
enhanced by a significant relaxation of tension
over the last year, tension that peaked 13 months
ago when the United States agreed to sell Pakistan
40 F-16 jet fighters as part of a military-economic
assistance program.
Gandhi saw the F-16s as a direct threat to India's
security, but, since India's recent buy of 40 Mirage
2000s from France, Gandhi stopped talking of
"gathering war clouds".
The improvement in Indo-Pakistani relations
comes at a time of other changes in regional rela
tionships. India's ties with China and the United
States, both allies of Pakistan, have been strength
ened and Pakistan has sought to improve its chilly
relations with the Soviet Union, which is friendly
with India.
Today's weather
