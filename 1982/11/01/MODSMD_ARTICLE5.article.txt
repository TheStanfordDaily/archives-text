# Engineer judges Trancos structurally safe

### KRISTEN CHRISTOPHER Senior staff writer 
Some residents of Trancos house will have to live
with warped and cracked walls, but they do not have
to worry about the dorm collapsing, according to a
report by Robert Matheu, a Palo Alto structural en
gineer.
Matheu inspected Trancos on Friday morning,
several hours after movements in the walls dividing
first floor bedrooms prompted fire department of
ficials to evacuate the building temporarily.
"The interior partitions separating the rooms are
non-structural and are not relied upon to support
the building," the report said. "These walls may be
removed or moved elsewhere without affecting the
structural integrity of the building."
Robert Mibach, manager of facilities and services
for residence halls, said a thorough study of alter
natives and options for replacing the walls will be
done soon, but the "major hurdle was to verify
structural integrity."
However, Norm Robinson, associate dean of resi
dential education, said Matheu's report "said what
we had known all along, and that's that there is no

danger to the structure."
The University has known about wall problems in
the Wilbur dorm complex for at least 10 or 15 years,
according to Robinson. "There have been walls re
placed before, "he said. '
Mibach said, "There are other areas of Wilbur
that have some deflection of the walls," but he is not
certain which houses are affected or the severity of
the problems.
Only walls on the first floor of Trancos are dam
aged, according to resident Larry Weiss. The rooms
on the building's south side have the most severe
flaws, he added.
There are three factors which caused the wall
bending in Trancos, according to Mibach. Two of
these factors stem from the fact that the dorm was
constructed on a dissimilar base; the concrete slab
which forms the first floor has been creeping, while
the earth it rests upon has not moved as much.
Mibach said Matheu told him that creep of con
crete can be expected when a building rests on a dis
similar base. "It is a structural phenomenon or char
acteristic," Mibach said.

However, when asked if it is known why there has
been a gradual creep of the concrete, Mibach re
plied, "No."
A third factor, not mentioned in Matheu's report,
could be the change in temperature that occurred af
ter the heat was turned on last week, according to
Mibach. Metal studs inside the walls may have bent
when the temperature increased, he said, thereby
causing the walls to change shape.
"We will continue a structural investigation," he
said, "and will involve some staff members from fa
cilities design to discuss renovation."
Mibach said he does not know how much time
would be needed to replace the existing walls, but
added, "of course, we would want to minimize the
inconvenience to students."
Steve Sellers, a resident assistant in Trancos, said,
"I think some people are still a little worried," but
for the most part, the early Friday morning episode
has turned into "kind of a joke." Resident Mike
Weis said he wants to design a dorm t-shirt similar to
the cover of Pink Floyd's album The Wall.
