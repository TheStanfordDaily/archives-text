# FBI spied on gay students here
## Students request release of classified files

The FBl's withholding of six addi
tional pages of documents related to the
agency's efforts to keep tabs on gay stu
dent organizations at Stanford and oth
er Bay Area schools in the early 1970s is
causing great concern to the gay com
munity here.
A Freedom of Information Act
(FoIA) request filed this summer by
Ray Koskovich, archivist of the Gay
and Lesbian Alliance at Stanford
(GLAS), obtained 19 pages of FBI ma
terials mostly periodical clippings on
gay student activity at Bay Area
schools. The particular exemptions to
this request which the FBI is claiming in
order to deny the release of the other
documents suggest that the agency may
have conducted more extensive spying
than the 19 pages indicate.
The Gay Law Students' Association
at Stanford is preparing an appeal to
the assistant attorney general in Wash

ington, D.C. to obtain the release of the
six pages. According to Jamie Hen
derson, president of the association, the
appeal consists of a letter to the assis
tant attorney general stating their case.
According to Henderson, the de
cision on the appeal for the release of
the documents will be made by another,
higher official in the FBI.
The FBI withheld the six pages on the
basis of three exemptions that they out
lined in a letter from their San Francis
co office to GLAS. Three pages were
withheld because they contain currently
and properly classified information,
which the agency defined as being "in
the interest of the national defense or
foreign policy." The remaining three
were withheld to protect confidential
sources and the personal privacy of oth
ers, and to protect the internal rules and
practices of the FBI.
According to Henderson, "It's really
inconceivable that any activity that the
Stanford gay groups have been in
volved in could have any effect on na

tional defense or foreign policy. There's
no indication that these documents
were ever properly classified."
A possible explanation for the use of
this exemption, Henderson added, is
that "President Reagan has issued an
executive order which greatly increases
the ability of agencies to use the na
tional defense exemption," as a reason
for withholding the information.
"One always has to take into con
sideration that there are 150,000 gov
ernment employees that have classi
fication privileges," Koskovich said.
According to Charles Marson, Law
School associate professor, "There are
hypothetical possibilities which would
justify classifying the documents, but
which would not necessarily mean that
the alliance is a security risk. However,
those hypothetical possibilities are not
terribly likely."
Robert Gast, special agent in charge
of the San Francisco office of the FBI,
said, "The mere fact that something is
classified has no relation to what is in

the material."
Of the protection of confidential
sources and the privacy of people men
tioned in the documents, Henderson
said, "they can and are supposed to de
lete this information before turning
over the documents."
He added that the FBI can entirely
refuse to turn over a piece of material
only if every part of it identifies one of
these people. From this, Henderson
concluded, "either they were doing in
depth spying or they haven't followed
their rules in complying with the Fol
Act request.
"It's somewhat ironic that the FBI
can invade the privacy of organizations
like gay groups by compiling docu
ments on them," Henderson said, "and
then refuse to disclose those documents
based on the privacy of those individ
uals whose privacies they have already
invaded."
The withholding of documents be
cause they are solely related to the in
