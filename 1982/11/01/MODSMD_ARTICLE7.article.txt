## El Salvador: Rebels call for talks; U.S. takes a stand Leftist peace plan denied 
### Compiled from news reports wire services 
Salvadoran government leaders have rebuffed re
cent leftist opposition offers to negotiate an end to
the country's civil war and reduce tensions through
out Central America.
Defense Minister Jose Guillermo Garcia, Presi
dent Alvaro Magana and Robert d'Aubuisson,
president of the Constituent Assembly, all re
nounced the leftist proposal issued last Tuesday.
Although the proposal called for unconditional
negotiations, Salvadoran leaders refused to con
sider the request. "The only dialogue" for the lef
tists, Garcia said in a statement Wednesday, "is the
dialogue with the people in the next elections."
The next elections are tentatively scheduled for
March of 1984. Leftist parties boycotted the March
28 election in which conservatives won a majority in
the Constituent Assembly.
The Democratic Revolutionary Front, a coali
tion of leftist political parties and the Farabundo
Marti organization, comprised of five guerrilla
groups, made five recommendations including:
•The Salvadoran government executive branch,
the Constituent Assembly and the armed forces
should initiate "a direct dialogue" with the Demo
cratic Front and the guerrilla organization "to es
tablish peace and social justice in El Salvador and to
contribute to detente in the region."
•Both sides should appoint policy-making dele
gates to the talks.
•Offices designed to organize negotiations and
establish communication between the two sides
should be created.
•A method of studying the participation of other
sectors, such as political parties, labor organiza
tions and business groups should be present at the
talks.
•The negotiations should be held in the presence
of witnesses, either nationals or foreigners.
Signed by top rebel commanders including
Guillermo Manuel Ungo, president of the DRF,

and Ana Guadalupe Martinez, a guerrilla leader,
the peace call was intended to take diplomatic ad
vantage of the oppositions' three-week-old military
offensive which reportedly resulted in the capture of
107 prisoners, 97 of whom have been released, ia
Chalatenango province. "
Through the joint initiative, they also hoped to
test recent suggestions from the Reagan adminis
tration that some political settlement of the conflict
might be feasible.
Ungo, a Social Democrat, has said that ultimate
ly any peace talks would hinge on U.S. willingness
to encourage talks. "The political will of the U.S. is
a vital factor in leading to any dialogue."
Realizing the attempt to open negotiations in the
three-year guerrilla war with the government might
be denied, Ungo did not rule out the possibility of
requesting future talks. "Political power in El
Salvador does not rely on one man," he said in am
interview following the proposal announcement.
Although the opposition has previously offered
to hold negotiations with the Salvadoran govern
ment, the two leaders said it was the first time a for
mal proposal had been delivered to important of
ficials in El Salvador. The initiative is unlike pre
vious proposals which the opposition has suggested
in that it is "an instrument to seek paths toward a
solution, a departure point aimed at opening doors
towards a settlement," Ungo said.
In the meantime, the Salvadoran government
does not indicate any need to bargain with the revo
lutionary forces. The Defense Ministry announced
that an army sweep in Cabanas ended last Sunday
with 76 guerrillas and one government soldier killed
and three wounded.
With the government expressing confidence in
ability to put down the insurgent forces talks do not
seem a likely occurence soon. D'Aubuisson, leader
of the far-right Nationalist Republic Alliance, said
talks with the left would be "the most vile treason
and an unqualifiably absurd policy."

tration that some political settlement of the conflict
might be feasible.
Ungo, a Social Democrat, has said that ultimate
ly any peace talks would hinge on U.S. willingness
to encourage talks. "The political will of the U.S. is
a vital factor in leading to any dialogue."
Realizing the attempt to open negotiations in the
three-year guerrilla war with the government might
be denied, Ungo did not rule out the possibility of
requesting future talks. "Political power in El
Salvador does not rely on one man," he said in am
interview following the proposal announcement.
Although the opposition has previously offered
to hold negotiations with the Salvadoran govern
ment, the two leaders said it was the first time a for
mal proposal had been delivered to important of
ficials in El Salvador. The initiative is unlike pre
vious proposals which the opposition has suggested
in that it is "an instrument to seek paths toward a
solution, a departure point aimed at opening doors
towards a settlement," Ungo said.
In the meantime, the Salvadoran government
does not indicate any need to bargain with the revo
lutionary forces. The Defense Ministry announced
that an army sweep in Cabanas ended last Sunday
with 76 guerrillas and one government soldier killed
and three wounded.
With the government expressing confidence in
ability to put down the insurgent forces talks do not
seem a likely occurence soon. D'Aubuisson, leader
of the far-right Nationalist Republic Alliance, said
talks with the left would be "the most vile treason
and an unqualifiably absurd policy."
