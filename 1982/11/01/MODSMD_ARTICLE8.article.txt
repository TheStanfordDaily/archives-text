## U.S. administration warns of aid cut 
### page edited by Jan Mireles Elaine Wang 
Compiled from news reports and wire services

In the face of a recent guerrilla offensive,
U.S. officials warned El Salvador's govern
ment that it will withdraw American aid if
rightist killings are not halted.
U.S. Ambassador Deane Hinton, in one of
his strongest statements against rightist vio
lence, blamed rightist death squads for most
of the estimated 38,000 deaths in this Central
American nation's three-year-old civil war.
The expression of concern, a departure
from the Reagan administration's "quiet
diplomacy" on Latin American human rights
abuses, was sparked by the arrests and abduc
tions of leftist activists over the past two
weeks.
Military sources said that guerrillas killed
at least 36 government troops and wounded
at least 14 others in half a dozen clashes on the
battlefield Friday. Hundreds of guerrillas at
tacked army and civil defense positions just
10 miles north of San Salvador. El Salvador's
Human Rights Commission claims that 80
percent of the 38,000 killed were civilians
caught in crossfires or murdered by rightist

death squads believed to be linked to the se
curity forces.
Speaking at a Chamber of Commerce
luncheon in San Salvador, Hinton said that at
least 68 people were murdered in El Salvador
in the first two weeks of October. "Who dares
speak out when he sees a person being
dragged off by heavily armed men in civilian
clothes?" he asked.
The United States' expressed goal is to in
duce the democratic leftists to split with the
guerrillas and join the political process, and it
is up to the Salvadoran government to check
the death squads. "Is it any wonder that much
of the world is predisposed to believe the
worst of a system which almost never brings
to justice either those who perpetrate these
acts or those who order them?" said Hinton.
He added that "neither internal confidence
nor external support can long survive here in
the absence of an effective system of criminal
justice. . . The 'mafia' must be stopped. Your
survival depends on it."
Clearly, the ambassador's reference to ex
ternal support meant U.S. military and eco
nomic aid, amounting to more than $230 mil

lion this year. Also threatened is the loss of 50
U.S. military advisers who assist the
Salvadoran army in its fight against leftist
guerrillas.
U.S. aid to El Salvador is contingent upon
congressional approval, and the Reagan ad
ministration must certify to Congress every
six months that El Salvador is making
progress in human rights and other reforms.
Reports quoted sources in Washington
that say the administration fears Congress
will not approve the continuing aid if the civil
ian deaths are not stopped. The next certifica
tion is due in January.
Meanwhile, Defense Undersecretary Fred
Ikle has been sent to San Salvador on a pre
viously planned "familiarization trip" to the
region. He is expected to discuss the human
rights issue, with specific concern over the
failure of two Salvadoran judges to resolve
two cases: the murders of two American labor
officials and a Salvadoran colleague who
were machine-gunned in San Salvador last
year, and of four U.S. church women killed in
1980 en route from the country's main air
port.
