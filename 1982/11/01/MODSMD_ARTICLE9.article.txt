# Unsolved murders cause dismay; judicial reluctance upsets U.S.
## 
### Compiled from news reports wire services 
The Reagan adminis
tration's determination to aid
the El Salvadoran govern
ment's battle against the in
surgents will be severely tested
by congressional critics, given
the background of recent ar
rests and abductions in El
Salvador.
One sticking point is the
murder last year of two Amer
ican land reform advisers,
which the Salvadoran gov
ernment is unable or unwill
ing to resolve.
On the night of Jan. 3,1981,
two enlisted men serving as
plainclothes bodyguards for
police officers visiting the
Sheraton Hotel walked up to
Michael Hammer, Mark
Pearlman and Jose Viera and
opened fire with machine
guns. The two gunmen then
quickly left the dining room
and the hotel. In a country
where at least 30,000 war-re

lated deaths have taken place,
no one tried to stop them.
Hammer, 42, was an
agrarian reform specialist and
Pearlman, 36, was a lawyer;
both were in San Salvador on
assignment for the AFL
CIO's Latin American arm,
the American Institute for
Free Labor Development.
Viera, 43, was both head of
the farmworkers' union and
president of Salvadoran in
stitute for Agrarian Trans
formation. Fiercely resented
by the ruling families, the in
stitute is empowered under
1980 laws to take land from
the propertied oligarchy for
redistribution among
Salvadoran peasants.
The investigation jointly
conducted by the AFL-CIO
and the Salvadoran govern
ment named Jose Acevedo,
35, and Santiago Gonzalez,
32, as the killers. The two ex
corporals in El Salvador's na
tional guard were arrested af

ter confessing to the crime.
They said that one of the of
ficers at the hotel that eve
ning, Lieut. Rodolfo Sibrian,
26, had told them to kill Viera
and the "fair-skinned" men,
and indeed, had handed them
the guns to do so.
Sibrian, known for his red
hair, fiery temper and anti-
Communist views, denied
being at the Sheraton that
night. When apprehended,
Sibrian was put in a line-up
for witnesses of the incident.
He was, however, allowed to
first cut and dye his red hair
black, as well as shave off his
mustache. No one recognized
him, although he was later
identified by the gunmen.
Sibrian was also ordered to
take a lie-detector test, and
failed it..
At present, U.S. officials
are frustrated by the reluc
tance of the Salvadorean judi
ciary to press for a resolution.
