# Survey to solicit student opinion
## Food service task force outlines priorities 
### JULIE RYAN 
The ASSU Food Service Task Force
will send a survey to upperclassmen in
10 random dorms today to gauge stu
dent opinions of food service in light of
the conditions during the labor strike
earlier this quarter. According to Task
Force Co-Chairman Gordon Hecker,
the task force "is trying to use the strike
to see how a pay-as-you-eat program
would work on campus."
Students responding to the survey
circulated today will be asked to judge
the amount they spent and the nutri
tional value of the food they ate during
the strike. In addition, they will be
asked to judge the quality of University
Food Service and how they feel about
"paying a set amount of money to go
through the food service line once."
All this effort is aimed to combat the
excessive cost and one-ton-per-day
food waste that a task force report last
June defined as the major problems of

University Food Service.
In that 100-page report, the Task
Force recommended that an ex
perimental fee-for-service meal plan in
which "students pay for the quantities
they eat" be tried this fall. The im
plementation of the pilot project has
since been pushed back, but former task
force Chairman Rod Beckstrom said,
"It is highly probable that this recom
mendation will be implemented in
Roble this spring."
Beckstrom, a current member of the
council of presidents, said, "We've
made some pretty good progress and
we're not stopping by any means."
Beckstrom met with administrators and
students over the summer to recalibrate
some of the figures in the report, and
added that there was "no change in the
conclusions." He said the revised report
should be out later this week.
According to Hecker, "Last year the
majority of our efforts went to in

vestigation, printing and distributing a
report documenting problems in our
food service system. This year is fun
damentally different in that we have set
down major recommendations to the
administration and it is a matter of fol
low up."
Last year's report listed five recom
mendations, the first of which was the
implementation of the "pay-as-you
eat" pilot.
The second was that the "University
should consider the advantages and dis
advantages of hiring a private contrac
tor to manage and operate the Stanford
University Food Service Program."
According to Hecker, "this is now in
the administration's court." He added
that Jason Mavis, director of facilities
and services, who has been delegated
with this task "has been very receptive
and is prepared to do much of the re
search necessary."

Norm Robinson, associate dean of
residential education, said the adminis
tration is investigating this issue and
added that his main concern in im
plementing the recommendations is
maintaining "the strong support of resi
dential education, which is so impor
tant to the University."
In response to the third recommen
dation which was to replace the meal
card with a magnetic identification card
that could also be used in capacities
such as student voting the ASSU has
set up a committee charged with study
ing the benefits and drawbacks of dif
ferent systems.
Because the task force found that the
nine University Food Service-operated
row houses ran a deficit of $ 140,000 last
year, Beckstrom said it was recom
mended that they be "allowed upon
written request to hire their own cooks

and operate their own kitchens."
Beckstrom said the task force has "re
ceived no firm commitment" on this
fourth issue. This year's task force has
labeled this "the row house conversion
project" as a priority area, according to
Hecker.
The task force also recommended
that food service should work to en

hance residential education. It said that
a system should be sought in which stu- (
dents "take a more active role in their
food service" and "make the dining en
vironment seem more like home."
No firm time schedule has been
adopted for these proposals. Hecker
said that these recommendations
"would involve major changes." He
added that "all major changes will have
some difficulties and we want to min
imize these difficulties. It will just take a
lot of time."
