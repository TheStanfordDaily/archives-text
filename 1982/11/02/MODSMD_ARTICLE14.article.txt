Vote.

Go vote: the message is a November ritual as reg
ular as the frantic banners and politicians' hurried
handshaking just a bit too close to the election
booths. The words imply that great issues will be
decided today, that policies will flow from your
ballot choices and that thousands watch the blips of
your tally in the totals for signs of pain or approval,
command or delegation of power.
All overstated but all, also, true.
On the California ballot, there's plenty at stake
today. Your votes on propositions will determine
bond issues, water management policies, the extent
of handgun registration, how political districts will
be determined and what kind of deposit you must
pay on cans and bottles. The candidates, too, offer
plenty of choices. In local congressional races, cam
paigns offer a choice between traditionally liberal
Democrats and variations on the theme of conser
vative Republicans.
Like it or not, your vote or your decision not to
vote will be watched by politicians and analysts
who, like it or not, influence the laws, choices and
policies that influence your life. This midterm elec
tion is widely regarded as a referendum on Presi
dent Reagan's economic policies, and any senti
ment as well as specific candidates emerging
from the election will determine the next years' pol
icies.

Policy-makers are watching two California races
particularly closely: the freeze proposition and the
U.S. Senate race. The freeze vote, along with simi
lar votes in other states, will gauge the political
strength of the disarmament movement. The politi
cal future of Gov. Brown, along with his presiden
tial ambitions and articulate opposition to Rea
gan's policies, is also at stake in the election.
Students are notorious for their complaints
about U.S. foreign policy, tax policies and reduc
tions in social programs. Strangely, their com
plaints of being poorly represented match their
equally notorious low turnout on election day. It's
no coincidence that those who believe their vote
matters and vote in corresponding numbers
have their views reflected in policy.
When your loan, your park, your answer to un
employment or your version of just foreign policies
is threatened, think back to your last vote and to the
representatives you chose. For candidates on to
day's ballot and the policies they will form, you will
have this vote to refer to as you damn or applaud
decisions of the next years.
This is not to suggest that problems will be solved
by your vote alone. They won't. They may, how
ever, be solved by your participation, your pas
sions, your intellect and your time. Your vote is a
start.
