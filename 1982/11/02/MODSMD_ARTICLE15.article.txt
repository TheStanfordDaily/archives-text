## Collegiate etiquette courses needed 
### 
Lately 1 have wondered: is it some
fastidious prejudice on my part or is
a large segment of American youth for
ever lost to civilization as we have
known it?
In Brooklyn, a teenage youth rapes
an 84-year-old woman in a wheelchair,
then bludgeons her to death.
In New Jersey, a 16-year-old
drowned because two of his "chums"
repeatedly punched, kicked and held
him down as he struggled for shore.
"Let him drown," screamed the beer
party watching from the beach.
These are melancholy events, set
down in full awareness that millions of
our young people are kind, courteous,
disciplined and rightly horrified by the
behavior of their peers.
But the question persists: why so
many crude, hostile kids in our midst
and how did they get that way? More to
the point, what is society doing about
it?
Society, it's good to report, is at long

last taking the problem in hand. Some
public schools are adding courses in
ethics and deportment, trying to wean
young people away from anti-social be
havior.
In Glendora, California, we read in
Psychology Today, elementary students
are being taught to "deal with anger,
make friends and understand the conse
quences of their action."
Several colleges are currently offer
ing seminars and workshops in sensi
tivity training and social skills. A typi
cal assignment: strike up a pleasant
conversation with a stranger in the
movie line.
At the University of Arizona, an
article by Lois Timnick relates, many
undergraduates were found to be too
socially insecure to date the opposite
sex. At UCLA the director of counsel
ing finds an appalling number of stu
dents who simply lack normal social
skills. This leads to anxiety, hostility

and sometimes explosive behavior.
One of yesterday's hippies, Steward
Brand (compiler of "The Whole Earth
Catalog"), now finds himself outraged
bv the bad behavior of today's youth.
Accordingly, he has established "Un
common Courtesy," described as "a
school of compassionate skills." Stu
dents in Sausalito, California, pay tui
tion. Chief textbook is "Amy Ven
derbilt's Complete Book of Etiquette,"
revised version.
In every country, notes Brand, the
rich and the educated should serve as
models of good behavior. "When they
are good, civilization flourishes," he be
lieves. And when they, too, lack a sense
of decency, then society suffers and col
leges which should be concerned
with pure learning have to teach
courses in deportment.
