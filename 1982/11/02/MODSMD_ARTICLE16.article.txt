CTA Zschau endorsement proves questionable

Political endorsements are a joke.
For the California Teachers Associa
tion (CTA) to endorse Ed Zschau over
Emmett Lynch in the 12th Con
gressional District race is a travesty.
Lynch has spent 27 years in education
as a teacher, principal and curriculum
developer both in the Sequoia Union
High School District and in Newark
district. In addition, he served as the lo
cal chapter president of CTA. All too
often voters are faced with the problem
of making a choice on the basis of cam
paign rhetoric. In this situation, how
ever, we can look at the proven track
record of a man who has served educa
tion in a variety of positions for more
than a quarter of a century.
Lynch has spent a good portion of his
life devoted to children. In fact, another
measure of the man and his wife is a lit
tle-known fact that all four of their chil
dren are adopted.
What better voice in Washington do
parents need? What better voice in
Washington do students and educators
need?
Political endorsements? Bah Hum
bug!

Stanford drivers
I was not surprised to read (Daily,
Oct. 15) that so many of the parking vi
olations in Santa Clara County occur at

Stanford. Stanford drivers are among
the rudest in the state of California. Per
haps this is because many of them are
from out of state, and they are not fa
miliar with the rules of common
courtesy for driving in California. Al
ready this quarter I have been nearly
run over about six times by horn-hon
king maniacs while walking or jogging
through a crosswalk. (Pedestrians are
supposed to have the right-of-way.)
These examples are typical of the
carelessness and disrespect that Stan
ford drivers have. Improving the situ
ation will require a little initiative on the
part of either the ASSU or whoever is
sues parking permits on campus. May
be we should require an additional writ
ten driving test for Stanford faculty,
staff and students who drive, in order to
ensure that they are familiar with both
California's and Stanford's driving
rules. It we don't do something pretty
soon we'll all be rotting on the front
grill of someone's car.

Sophomore, undeclared
Attorney general
It is no secret that crime in California
has increased at disastrous rates. Since
1980 major crimes are up by 12 percent,
murders by 15 percent and robbery by
20 percent. California's unlawful

homicide rate is almost I V2 times the na
tional average. Citizens statewide are
fearful for their lives, property and
most of all for their futures.
My concern for the future along with
my personal experience as a victim of
crime prompt me to write. I am utterly
appalled that California would even
consider John Van de Kamp as an op
tion for attorney general. Van de
Kamp's record has consistently shown
his pro-criminal bias. Not only does he
support plea bargaining for guilty, vi
olent criminals, he supports lenient bail
bond requirements for accused crimi
nals and opposes consideration of pub
lic opinion in parole proceedings.
Furthermore, Van de Kamp's move to
dismiss the horrifying Hillside
Strangler case reeks of incompetence.
We need not and should not per
petuate California as a crime haven.
George Nicholson's experience as a
fighting deputy district attorney, as ex
ecutive director of the California Dis
trict Attorneys Association and as sen
ior assistant attorney general have
proven time and again his intent to pro
tect the people and promulgate firm
laws.
The choice appears obvious while the
alternative may be disastrous.

Reelect Tom Lantos
Observers of the political scene na
tionally have noted that political cam
paign waters have become especially
muddled this election year. In view of
commonplace negative campaigns
which offer voters choices based on lit
tle but substanceless accusations, Pen
insula voters should appreciate the
clear differences between Congressman
Tom Lantos and his challenger, Re
publican Bill Royer.
Voters should recognize Lantos' op
position to continued military aid to El
Salvador and Royer's support of Rea
gan's policy of military assistance in
view of the human rights violations
there; of Lantos' co-sponsorship of the
House nuclear freeze resolution and
Royer's voting record supporting
massive increases in the defense budget,
including nuclear weapons delivery sys
tems; of Lantos' fight against Watt's
plans to drill for oil off our coast, and
Royer's support of the Interior secre
tary's general policies.
This year the electorate ought to re
ject overwhelmingly candidates and
campaigns based on diversions that ov
erlook the true merits of the candidates.
In looking at the issues, voters will pre
serve the support of our electoral proc
ess by according it the respect it de
serves.
