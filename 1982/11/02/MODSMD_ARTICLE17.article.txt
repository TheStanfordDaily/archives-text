## Ancient media adviser offers insights 
### 
At the age of 2013, Mel Plotkin is the
oldest living media consultant. Long
before the emergence of political action
committees and sophisticated polling,
Mel advised ancient leaders on matters
of political strategy. Because I was
eager to hear Mel's perspective on the
May 1982 campaign, I visited him at his
house in the Hollywood Hills. I found
him reading on his patio. Wearing a tan
Nehru suit and a broad-rimmed pith
helmet, he bent over a table covered
with documents written in Greek, San
skrit and other long-forgotten lan
guages. He didn't look a day over 81.
Mel sipped a Perrier and a lime as I
explained the purpose of my visit and
asked him who was the best media can
didate of all time:
Mel: "Well, Moses was good. Our
polls showed that he wouldn't get the
Egyptian vote, so we ran against the
Pharoah's record of high interest rates
and high pyramids. Moses started to get
strong support from the Jewish com
munity, especially after I concocted the
slogan "Next year in Jerusalem!"
Alben: "How did the deliverance of
the 10 commandments influence the
campaign?"
Mel: "This was one of the first media
events, but no one realized it at the time.
God originally wanted 20 command

ments, but we couldn't afford that
much television time so we bargained
him down to 10. The special effects were
terrific all that thunder and lightning
on Mt. Sinai really put the fear of God
into the children of Israel. It was almost
as flashy as The Empire Strikes Back.
Alben: "Any disappointments in that
campaign?"
Mel: "The campaign manager melted

down my consulting fee we were paid
in coins in those days and fashioned
a golden bear, or maybe it was a cow.
Anyway, the Hebrews told me 1
wouldn't get paid until they got to some
"Promised Land." I had to wait over 40
years for my fee that's a lot of in
terest."
Alben: "Does any other great cam
paigner you've worked with rival
Moses?"
Mel: "I'd have to say Napolean

would run a close second to him if they
ran in the same district. Even before he
became emperor. Napolean enjoyed
great name recognition as a result ofthe
brandy commercials he was doing,
which portrayed a gallant figure in bat
tle. I told him why tamper with suc
cess, keep the funny hat and the white
horse, the French love it!"
Alben: "How did you dreamrup

Napolean's famous pose?"
Mel: "It derives from a commercial
we shot just before the Russian cam
paign. Microphones were primitive in
those days and we had to ask the em
peror to hide one under his tunic and
hold it in place with his right hand. Lat
er on we used boom mikes, but my
pollsters found that the voters liked the
"Napoleonic" pose, so we left it in. We
had lots of gimmicks in that campaign.
One of the most successful was naming
one of my wife Emma's pastries aftei
the emperor."
Alben: "Have you ever worked for a
candidate who refused to follow your
advise?"
Mel: "General Custer. With
flaxen locks of his and his dashing
cavalry uniform he could have been
president of the United States, but he
insisted on doing all his own stunts up
at the Little Big Horn. Well, Sitting Bull
and Crazy Horse had other ideas."
Alben: "Any thoughts on the 1982
campaign?"
Mel: "The Republicans should
knock off this 'Stay the Course,' busi
ness. My experience has proven that no
one likes high interest rates and higta
pyramids." "
