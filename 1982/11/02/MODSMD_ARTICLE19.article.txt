"Ladies on the right of your
partner, gentlemen on the
left," and so begins a
ballroom dance class held at
the Clubhouse Ballroom on
Monday nights.
The class is taught by Lou
and Brown Whitaker, who
have been involved in
ballroom dancing for the past
12 years. "We started out by
taking dance lessons
ourselves. We like them so
much we wanted to start
teaching!" said Lou.
Ballroom dancing can defi
nitely become habit-forming.
"We have some people in our
classes who are back for their
25th series of lessons," Lou
said.
"The classes are very popu
lar," she continued. "They are
absolutely huge. There are
about 75 people enrolled in
each of the classes. We teach
the swing, fox-trot, cha-cha,
samba, ramba tango and the
waltz. The students really
learn how to dance."
Brown Whitaker explains
the dances and steps to the
students who are circled
around the Whitakers. Lou
and Brown demonstrate the
steps to the class.
Brown has a sense of humor

which lightens up the at
mosphere of the class. "You
can flirt with your partner
only," Brown said to his stu
dents, "have eye-contact with
your partner, not your neigh
bor's partner!"
"While you're dancing
always keep smiling, even
though your blisters hurt,"
Brown advised. His anecdotes
combined with his detailed in
structions makes the process
of learning the dances en
joyable and simple.
The classes are comprised
of an assortment of people of
various ages and occupations.
Some dance students are af
filiated with Stanford, while
others are from the surround
ing communities. Brown tells
his students to switch partners
between dances, so they meet
new people and experience
dancing with different types
of partners.
The dance students have a
number of reasons for joining
the class. Peter Vansant, a
computer engineer, noted, "I
enjov dancing, but 1 wasn't
very good at it. 1 wanted to be
able to dance and feel com
fortable about my skill when
out with friends."
George Lynch said, "I took
the class before because 1

wanted to learn how to dance,
and I've really enjoyed it. I've
taken it for four quarters. At
first I had a hard time learning
the steps, but now when I look
at the beginners I can't im
agine how it was ever hard. It
just takes time and practice."
But can the skills learned in
hours of diligent work at the
Whitaker's class be used in the
outside world of rock, punk
and disco? The answer is yes.
The Whitakers provide a list
of times and places that
dances are held in the area.
The tea-dances at the Hyatt
Regency in San Francisco are
popular for students to prac
tice their dance technique.
Social events are another
place where ballroom dance
skills can be put to practical
use. "Mv husband and I took
a lot of classes before our wed
ding so we would know how
to dance correctly at the wed
ding party," commented
Becki Wright.
Although the ballroom
dance class is in popular de
mand, there is a small prob
lem with enrollment. The
Whitakers observed that their
Stanford classes have a
greater number of males than
females.
