# Board to vote in December
## Committee urges cut in proxy votes 
### JULIE KAUFMANN Senior Staff Writer 
Five years ago, it was the hottest issue
on campus. It sparked fasts, rallies, let
ter-writing and the wearing of black
armbands. Finally, it led to the mass ar
rest of nearly 300 students.
But today, the Commission on In
vestment Responsibility (CIR) has a
|hard time getting any community input
when it discusses voting on stock proxy
issues resolutions placed on corpo
rate ballots by shareholders, calling for
the company to, for example, cease
South African activity or infant for
mula sales to Third World countries.
After a year of deliberation, the CIR,
an advisory group of faculty, students,
staff and alumni, has recommended
that the University cut substantially the
number of proxy votes it casts each year
from about 50 to just a few.
The announcement was made more
two weeks ago, but CIR Chairman
Alexander Dallin said he has received
no reaction at all to the recommenda
tions, on which the board of trustees
will vote in December. The lack of re
sponse "confirms that it is not a hot is
sue on campus," Dallin said.
The commission requested a
moratorium on proxy voting last year
in order to study the process, which it
said had become "too hurried and too
limited to do justice to the issues in
volved."
During "proxy season," several
weeks before corporation annual meet
ings each spring, the commission re
ceives a dozen or more proxy ballots ev
ery week, History Prof. Dallin said.
could not do an adequate job of re
searching, discussing and ... passing
on recommendations to the trustees."
Past CIRs have voted on every proxy
issue, but if the trustees approve the
proposal, next year's commission
would consider voting proxies only on
"the most important, serious, or
salient" issues where "substantial social
injury is at stake."
These changes won't cut the work
load, but will make the commission
more effective, Dallin said. "The com
mission would not have to look at every

single thing that comes up. They will
have the choice of being selective. I
think that makes much more sense," he
said.
In its report to the trustees, the com
mission makes these recommendations:
•Trustees normally should not vote
any shareholder proxy involving social
issues.
•The commission should consider al
legations of substantial social injury re
sulting from corporate behavior only
by majority vote.
•After research, study and delibera
tion, any recommendations for action
by the trustees should be made only by
two-thirds vote of the commission, or
eight of its 12 members.
•The recommendations may call for
voting Stanford's shares, making repre
sentation to management, divestment
or any other action the commission re
gards as appropriate.
The terms of the year-long
moratorium on proxy voting provided
for exceptions in specific cases, but "the
occasion never arose," Dallin said.
Though members of the commission
agreed unanimously on the basic rec
ommendations, they held "different
and incompatible positions" on the role
of the University as an ethical investor
and the effectiveness of the proxy proc
ess itself.
A majority statement signed by
Dallin and six other members, for the
most part faculty and students, main
tains the importance of proxy votes.
The votes "help keep a company's man
agement honest," Dallin said, and are
part of the University's proper educa
tional role.
The votes are sometimes effective in
"stirring up" issues, he added. "It was
enough to make Nestle and other com
panies reconsider their policy regarding
infant formula sales in Third World
countries."
A second statement, signed by four
members including former board of
trustees President Peter Bing, outlines
the proxy process, noting that the issues
rarely receive more than 10 percent of
the shareholders' votes. Proxies are

"not likely to be effective," the
statement says, and recommends in
stead that Stanford divest itself of stock
in companies that have caused "sub
stantial social injury."
Since Stanford owns less than one
half of 1 percent of each corporation in
which it has stock, divestiture can not
be used as a political tool, statement II
continues, but rather will ensure that
the University does not profit from so
cial injury.
Statement 111, signed by three mem
bers, maintains that the commission
should not takepositions "on the popu
lar political and social issues of the
day."
Some members endorsed two
statements.
Glynn O'Donnell, a student com
mission member, said there was a clear
division between the faculty/student
and staff/alumni points of view, but all
members "found great value in the
commission and wanted it to con
tinue."
The proxy process isn't necessarily
effective, "but it is the only existing
mechanism to effect corporate respon
sibility. If we didn't vote on proxies,
that in itself would be a statement,"
O'Donnell said.
Investor responibility has been an is
sue at other universities, too, Dallin
said, but most don't vote every proxy is
sue. "One reason why we seem to be ov
erburdened is we were trying to do a
more thorough and complete job than
other schools."
The Stanford investment portfolio
includes holdings in about 400 com
panies worth more than $5OO million.
The commission has always had the
option to recommend divestment of a
certain stock, but Stanford has never
sold stock because of a CIR recommen
dation, Dallin said.
The CIR was established in June
1977, after the arrest of 294 people at an
Old Union sit-in the month before pro
testing the University's abstention on a
proxy vote involving Ford Motor Co.'s
South African investments.
