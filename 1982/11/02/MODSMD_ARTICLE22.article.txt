## Art Pepper talks on the straight life 
### TED GIOJA 
When I interviewed saxophonist Art Pepper
on May 18, his conversation revealed an op
timistic outlook on the future which belied the
medical problems which had plagued him for
years. Less than a month later Pepper was felled
by the stroke that led to his death a passing
all the more cruel coming, as it did, during one
of the most creative periods of his long career.
In his mid-fifties, an age at which most musi
cians have either been exiled from the limelight
or have remained there by rehashing past
triumphs, Pepper had begun to achieve the suc
cesses which had eluded him during earlier dec
ades. In 1980 he was named "jazz musician of
the year" bv Jazz Journal, and was similarly
honored by Japan's Swing Journal; during this
same period his records and performances
brought him, in addition to critical acclaim, a
degree of economic security.
For Pepper these rewards were all the more
appreciated, coming after a period in which he
spent much of his time in prison on drug related
charges. The 'sos and '6os found Pepper serving
time in institutions such as Chino, Folsom and
San Quentin. After his eventual release Pep
per's return to music was short-lived soon he
was back in an institutional setting, only this
time voluntarily, at Synanon. During his three
years there Pepper successfully weaned himself
from his long-standing heroin addiction and
also met his third wife, Laurie. His experiences
with drug addiction and prison life are moving
ly outlined in his autobiography Straight Life,
written with the assistance of his wife and pub
lished three years ago.
After his rehabilitation from drugs, Pepper's
return to regular performing in the late '7os pre
sented him with a different and in many ways
more intimidating challenge. His achievements,
which were by no means insignificant, were to
many fans only a dim memory from the past. In
1951 he finished second behind Charlie Parker
in the Downbeat poll, narrowly being edged out
by 957 votes to 945, and was runner-up in the
following year as well. In 1952 and 1953 he fin
ished third in the Metronome poll behind
Parker and Lee Konitz. Yet 1953 was also the
beginning of the end for Pepper: later in that
year he was arrested and charged with possess
ing one gram of heroin.

A quarter of a century was 'to pass before
Pepper, cured of heroin addiction, was to regain
his position as a poll winner and pre-eminent
alto saxophonist. That he succeeded in surpass
ing his past achievements is testimony to the de
termination of this gifted individual and to the
maturity and depth of his music.
Talking to Art Pepper, one immediately
senses this determination and drive for achieve
ment. I asked him about the musical goals he
still hoped to attain, and he responded with an
enthusiasm which is rare among veteran musi
cians:
"I'd love to make a two or three album set
which would let me play in a number of musical
settings which I haven't done before: I'd like to
plav with some Latin rhythm players, people
like Tito Puente; maybe do some numbers with
a trumpet section or with Toshiko's band (The
Toshiko Akivoshi/Lew Tabackin big band);
also I'd like to do some real down-home gospel
numbers a Ray Charles type of thing; maybe
some duets with George Cables, and also some
numbers solo saxophone.
"I recorded solo one time for John Snyder,

but I don't know if I approached it in the right
way. I tried to play like there was a rhythm sec
tion with me, so I didn't take a lot of the liberties
I could have taken. If I tried it again I'd do it
differently." (These performances, done for
Snyder's Artist House label, have yet to be is
sued. They feature Pepper playing unaccom
panied versions of "Lover Man," "Body and
Soul," and "You Go To My Head.")
Pepper spoke eagerly about a planned con
cert in New York for that city's summer jazz
festival. He clearly felt that he still had a great
deal to prove to East Coast critics who had had
few chances to hear him during the past two
decades. Unlike many musicians, Pepper was
always very concerned with what critics said
about him. He pointed out, with scarcely dis
guised disappointment, that he had been per
forming for 40 years and had never had his pic
ture on the cover of Downbeat ("That's some
thing I've always wanted.") and that he was get
ting more recognition overseas than in parts of
the United States.
He knew, with surprising exactitude, which
polls he had won, in which years, and on which
magazine covers and calendars he had ap
peared. The warm receptions he had received
on his recent international tours were, despite
the strain such tours placed on his health, a
source of great satisfaction to Pepper. "I've
been amazed at the following I've gained over
seas not only in England, but in places like
Japan too. Last year we made two trips to Eu
rope, and also went to Japan, Australia and
Canada. So far this year I've been doing less,
but we'll be touring later this summer." Neither
the tour or the anticipated concert in New York
were destined to take place; his last concert hall
appearance was, instead, at an all-star tribute to
Duke Ellington which had taken place in Los
Angeles a few days before the interview.
Pepper attributed his increased following
partly to the success of his autobiography
Straight Life. "The book has been good for me.-
It seems to have reached a lot of people many
who don't really follow jazz. People have
thanked me for telling my story so honestly."
When asked about the "West Coast/Cool
School," a label that has often been applied to
his playing, Pepper challenged its validity.
"They coin a phrase and that becomes your

identity. I think I play fuller and in a more
searching way than the 'West Coast' label
would lead one to think." Almost as an after
thought he added: "A lot of guys came from
California who were never branded as 'West
Coast players Mingus, Dexter, Harol Land.
But with me the label stuck."
We spoke of Pepper's new album Roadgame,
which had been pressed but not yet released at
the time of the interview. Pepper felt that the
album, which had been recorded live at Los An
geles Maiden Voyage club, represented one of
his finer efforts. "It's always a special challenge
recording live," he remarked, "but it has
worked well for me in the past. I did some rec
ords at the Village Vanguard in New York
which were well received, and we tried it again
on this album. I'm very happy with Roadgame
unlike the Village Vanguard albums. I did
this with my present working groups: George
Cables on piano, Carl Burnett on drums and
David Williams on bass.
"On one number I play clarinet, which is
something I've started doing more of lately. I
had played it a number of years back on the Art
Pepper plus Eleven album and on some albums I
had done for other people, like Henry Mancini,
but I hadn't really used the instrument a lot af
ter that. When I was in Japan they asked me
why I didn't play clarinet any more. After that I
started working on it again, although my wife
and some friends weren't so sure about it."
Pepper admitted that he practiced the sax
ophone very little, but added "I think about
music all the time. I'm interested in doing more
work in composing and arranging. One of the
things I'm doing is working on ways of getting a
quartet to sound like a larger group." Pepper
elaborated on some of the ways this could be
done: "For example, you can have different in
struments playing unison lines, or by using the
bass as a melodic instrument rather than just as
a timekeeper." Pepper's use of these techniques
can be heard on his compositions "Mambo
Kovama" (on the Art Pepper Today album) and
"Make a List" (on the Straight Life album).
I questioned Pepper on whether he had been
especially impressed by any of the younger mu
sicians he had heard. In his response, Pepper
pointedly avoided mentioning other alto
players and instead cited trumpeters Wynton

Marsalis and Freddie Hubbard. When asked
point blank about other alto players, such as
Phil Woods, he replied "I have the highest ad
miration for Phil," but was quick to add "you
know, I'm trying to do something a little dif
ferent from that,"
indeed, "doing something a little different,"
was almost a point of honor with Pepper. Early
in his career he avoided the pervasive Bird im
itations being practiced by most of his
poraries, and instead adopted tenor sax
notably Lester Young, A1 Cohn and Zoot
Sims as some of his earliest idols. When he
later experimented with making changes in his
style it was another tenor player, John Col
trane, whose influence showed up in Pepper's
work. In his autobiography, Pepper wrote
about Coltrane: "He's the only guy I've heard
in my life that I said 'l'd give my right arm to
play like that.' "
Pepper told me of the great enjoyment he got
out of working with Coltrane's long-standing
drummer, Elvin Jones. "I worked with Elvin on
The Trip and on the albums we recorded ajÂ£e
Village Vanguard. He's a fantastic musicians to
play with. He's especially good on things with a
6/8 feel to them."
Throughout the interview I was struck by
Pepper's absorption in music and his singular
artistic integrity. This was in striking contrast to
what one might expect from reading his auto
biography a book which paints him as a trou
bled man who is only incidentally a musidian.
Pepper's dedication was all the more apparent
during the last few years of his life, when he
turned down lucrative commercial gigs in order
to concentrate on performing the type of music
which he felt represented him.
In 1980 Pepper told an interviewer that he felt
"each performance I could give could be my
last." In recent years he had undergone
tions on his liver and for a burst spleen, and had
been sidelined by other assorted medical prob
lems pneumonia, a ventral hernia, a frac
tured rib. Yet the health problems in no way
curbed the intensity of his playing. Almost in
defiance of his physical ailments, Pepper played
with an unrelenting passion which is Well
documented on his recordings and which, no
doubt, has earned for him that special niche in
the annals of jazz for which he strived.
