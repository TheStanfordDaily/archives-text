# 'Dear Liar' not up to Shaw
## 
### MARC FAJER 
Toward the end of their 40-year cor
respondence, Patrick Campbell wrote
to George Bernard Shaw that she did not
wish to wait for his death to publish their let
ters because she wanted, as soon as possible,
to release the "thrush in your throat."
Jerome Kilty's play, "Dear Liar," based on
those letters, shows us how well and how
wittily the thrush could sing. Unfortunately,
the thrush did not write the play, and despite
a very fine performance by Dakin Matthews
as Shaw, the American Conservatory
Theatre production cannot hide the fact that
Kiltv is a bird of a different order.
Campbell (DeAnn Mears) was one
of the premiere actresses in London in the
early years of this century. Shaw admired
her greatly, and eventually convinced her to
originate the part of Eliza Doolittle in
"Pygmalion." Over the course of their cor
respondence and the negotiations leading to
her agreement to do his show, Shaw fell in
love with her and was ultimately jilted. After
"Pygmalion," he rapidly rose in prominence
while she aged, apparently not too graceful
ly. Her letters reveal that she grew more and
more desperate over time, but Shaw had
never forgiven her, and was of little help.
"Dear Liar" is composed of excerpts from
the letters between them, which sometimes
are pieced together into dialogue, allowing
the two actors to relate to one another; often
they are just used as monologues. With little

interaction between the characters, dramatic
tension needs to be established by the con
tent. In the first act, Kilty succeeds in doing
this. The growing affection between Shaw
and Campbell, the arguments before and
during "Pygmalion," and the jilting keep us
interested despite some clumsy transitions.
The second act, however, is primarily con
cerned with arguments about the fate of the
letters themselves, and plays very slowly.
Director James Edmondson has done a
good job covering the flaws in the play
and emphasizing its best moments: those
written by Shaw. The rehearsals of
"Pygmalion," and the readings from "The
Apple Cart" are very funny scenes and show
the actors at their best, working together.
Matthews has many fine moments on his
own in a rich portrayal that demonstrates
the brilliance of Shaw while remaining
cognizant of the man who is aging behind his
words over the course of the evening. His let
ter describing his mother's funeral is moving
and funny in turns and is the most memo
rable piece in the show because of the com
bination of Shaw's words and careful han
dling bv actor and director.
Mears' performance as Campbell suffers
from an apparent decision to accept Shaw's
description of the actress as someone who
"could not live with real people in the real
world." She never seems to retreat from an

imposed staginess and in moments in which
a real woman should be seen through the
layers of actress, there is none there. This is
especially true during the desperate last
stages of her life. Mears can be very funny at
times, as during the "Pygmalion" re
hearsals, but it is difficult to believe that this
Campbell had all London at her feet.
Richard Seger's set consists of two

archways (which look suspiciously like
brown versions of those used in "Black
Comedy," "Mourning Becomes Electra,"
etc., last season) and a couple of desks and
chairs. ACT's apparent efforts to advertise
poverty with minimalist scenery were more
successful in "The Gin Game," and the pro
duction would have been much better served
by eliminating the archways altogether, as

they only emphasize the lack of backdrop
without adding anything in particular.
"Dear Liar" runs through November
27th at the Geary Theatre in San Francisco.
Dakin Matthews' performance, at least, is
worth seeing, but for a worthwhile evening
of theater, you would do better to go straight
to the thrush's mouth.

Theatre production cannot hide the fact that
Kiltv is a bird of a different order.
Campbell (DeAnn Mears) was one
of the premiere actresses in London in the
early years of this century. Shaw admired
her greatly, and eventually convinced her to
originate the part of Eliza Doolittle in
"Pygmalion." Over the course of their cor
respondence and the negotiations leading to
her agreement to do his show, Shaw fell in
love with her and was ultimately jilted. After
"Pygmalion," he rapidly rose in prominence
while she aged, apparently not too graceful
ly. Her letters reveal that she grew more and
more desperate over time, but Shaw had
never forgiven her, and was of little help.
"Dear Liar" is composed of excerpts from
the letters between them, which sometimes
are pieced together into dialogue, allowing
the two actors to relate to one another; often
they are just used as monologues. With little

interaction between the characters, dramatic
tension needs to be established by the con
tent. In the first act, Kilty succeeds in doing
this. The growing affection between Shaw
and Campbell, the arguments before and
during "Pygmalion," and the jilting keep us
interested despite some clumsy transitions.
The second act, however, is primarily con
cerned with arguments about the fate of the
letters themselves, and plays very slowly.
Director James Edmondson has done a
good job covering the flaws in the play
and emphasizing its best moments: those
written by Shaw. The rehearsals of
"Pygmalion," and the readings from "The
Apple Cart" are very funny scenes and show
the actors at their best, working together.
Matthews has many fine moments on his
own in a rich portrayal that demonstrates
the brilliance of Shaw while remaining
cognizant of the man who is aging behind his
words over the course of the evening. His let
ter describing his mother's funeral is moving
and funny in turns and is the most memo
rable piece in the show because of the com
bination of Shaw's words and careful han
dling bv actor and director.
Mears' performance as Campbell suffers
from an apparent decision to accept Shaw's
description of the actress as someone who
"could not live with real people in the real
world." She never seems to retreat from an

imposed staginess and in moments in which
a real woman should be seen through the
layers of actress, there is none there. This is
especially true during the desperate last
stages of her life. Mears can be very funny at
times, as during the "Pygmalion" re
hearsals, but it is difficult to believe that this
Campbell had all London at her feet.
Richard Seger's set consists of two

archways (which look suspiciously like
brown versions of those used in "Black
Comedy," "Mourning Becomes Electra,"
etc., last season) and a couple of desks and
chairs. ACT's apparent efforts to advertise
poverty with minimalist scenery were more
successful in "The Gin Game," and the pro
duction would have been much better served
by eliminating the archways altogether, as

they only emphasize the lack of backdrop
without adding anything in particular.
"Dear Liar" runs through November
27th at the Geary Theatre in San Francisco.
Dakin Matthews' performance, at least, is
worth seeing, but for a worthwhile evening
of theater, you would do better to go straight
to the thrush's mouth.
