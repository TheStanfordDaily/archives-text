# Marriage, politics and war in Monsignor
## 
### STEVE VINEBERG 
If you doubt that Christopher
.Reeve is a star, watch him in
Monsignor. His tall athlete's
frame dominates every scene he's
in (and he's in almost every
scene), and his soft, earnest blue
eyes draw the camera the way
|Paul Newman's do. He brings the
lame natural sweetness and
charm to this movie that he
.brought to the two Superman pic
tures, and the director, Frank
Perrv, features him in close-up
after close-up. Not that it's- a
great performance in fact, for
the first two-thirds of the picture
he isn't really acting at all, and
then in the last third, when he
plays an older man, he acts badly,
holding his mouth tight and half
spitting, half-shrieking his lines
fco show that he's under pressure.
TJut star presence does not rely on
.'good acting (though Reeve has
shown considerable talent in his
pther movies).
After a decade and a half of
-directing mostly terrible movies,
uFrank Perry seems to have found
his niche: Monsignor, like his last
ifilm, Mommie Dearest, is an old
fashioned Hollywood product,
replete with huge full-screen
Virtually all of it takes
â– place in Rome, where Father
John Flaherty (Reeve) is sta
tioned at the Vatican, so Perry
in scenes of high church
with dozens of extras in
J scarlet robes, and the on-location
exteriors have the usual trav
elogue flavor; there's even an in
domitably chipper musical score
.bv John Williams. The second
scene (after the ordaining of
Flaherty) is a big Italian-Ameri
can wedding right out of The
Godfather, and two minutes later
we're in the trenches of World

War 11, where Flaherty braves
enemy fire to give a dying soldier
his last rites and then forget his
vocation long enough to mow
down a cluster of advancing Na
zis. By the time we reach the Vat
ican, which Perry and the writers,
Abraham Polonsky and Wendell
Mayes, have set up as an openly
political honeycomb ruled by a
pair of cardinaljbees (Fernando

Rev and Adolfo Celi), we know
that we're not going to believe a
word of this movie. And in some
fashion this recognition liberates
us. We no longer have to worry
about plot logic or originality or
character motivation (there's
almost none), and so Monsignor,
preposterous as it is, turns out to
be quite enjoyable.
The central idea of the movie is
that clergymen are politicians (it
was also a theme in the Water
gate parody Nasty Habits and
last year's True Confessions ) but
Flaherty brings a new style to the
Catholic Church: he is a busi
nessman, with mob connections.
His best friend, Lodovico Varese
(Joe Cortese), is in the employ of
a Sicilian don (Jason Miller) and

through him Flaherty involves
the Vatican in the post-war Ital
ian black market. This double
punch permits Monsignor the
luxury of being both an expensive
gangster epic and a political com
edy. The cast of characters in
cludes an ambitious friar with
surveillance skills (Tomas
Milian), an obscene, cigar-chom
ping Boston bishop (Robert

Proskv), and an emaciated pope
with a death's-head face
(Leonardo Cimino). As conniv
ing Cardinal Vinci, Adolfo Celi
gets to repeat his number as the
worldly villain in Thunderball,
this time in a classier costume; as
his adversary, Cardinal Santoni,
Fernando Rey looks like Leo
Carroll, and he's too sage to be
much fun. There is an amusing
scene between these two, how
ever, in which they smile super
ciliously at each other like over
dressed lap dogs in a Disney car
toon.
Perhaps the silliest single
episode in Monsignor is Flaher
ty's love affair with a young pos
tulant named Clara (Genevieve
Bujold). Bujold's specialty is

portraying women considerably
younger than herself (the charac
ter she played in Obsession re
verts to childhood at the end of
the picture, and Bujold carried it
off), but the skin around her eyes
has begun to line, so that with her
hair tied severely back and
braided she looks like an aging
pixie, and in her scenes with
Christopher Reeve you can tell
that they weren't born in the
same decade. Clara retreated into
a convent after a series of dis
astrous love affairs, and she
hasn't vet attained the status of a
novice because the nuns doubt
her commitment; on her first date
with Flaherty, she tells him she
only has an hour and begins to
undress. When he's around her,
he wears his army uniform with
his chaplain's stripes removed so
she won't know he's a priest, but
she guesses that he's keeping a se
cret from her and asks him if he's
married. Their scenes feature the
sort of garish dialogue one as
sociates with Ross Hunter soap
operas starring Rock Hudson or
Lana Turner: "I'm living with the
need to tell you something," he
savs, and she replies, "You're a
mystery. It attracts me." She
finds out the truth, of course, in
the middle of mass at the Vat
ican, when she is returning to her
pew after receiving the pope's
blessing and she sees Flaherty sit
ting among the other priests. This
may be the only time in his career
that Frank Perry has demon
strated any wit: he pulls the cam
era back and we see that Clara
has stopped traffic, so that her re
lationship to Flaherty is made si
lently obvious to everyone in that
enormous church. (Bujold is ter
rific here; she makes us see that it
is the depth of Clara's astonish

ment and hurt that incapacitates
her in this extremely public place.
It's the only real acting moment
in the picture.) Later, when Clara
meets Flaherty for the last time,
she speaks a sensational howler
that the writers must have been
saving: "So you were married, af
ter all." It's a deliriously foolish
movie.

Bette Midler is freakishly tal
ented, but her weird blend of
high-powered energy, lowdown
sexiness, blurry little-girl vulner
ability and camp hilarity makes it
impossible for her to play con
ventional roles. A number of not
easily-pegged, first-rate per
formers, particularly women,
have had this difficulty: it ex
plains why Lily Tomlin could
give stunning performances in
Nashville and The Late Show and
then be such a maudlin drip in
Moment by Moment, or why Liza
Minnelli, so phenomenal in
Cabaret and New York, New
York, could go so hopelessly
wrong in Arthur. In The Rose,
playing a Janis Joplin-style rock
star, Midler gave one of the most
astonishing debut performances
in movies, and her filmed stage
show, Divine Madness, begs com
parison with the Richard Pryor
nightclub pictures, but she's just
dreadful in Jinxed! It's a part no
women of talent should have to
play a mediocre country and
western singer who is so depen
dent on the man she lives with
(Rip Torn), and so bullied by
him, that she can't extricate
herself from the relationship
and Midler whines and blubbers
her way through most of it. A
dull actress like Marsha Mason
would have fared much better;
Midler tries to do so many things
at once that she ends up as a car
toon version of herself.
It doesn't help that the role
makes almost no sense and the
movie, written by Bert Blessing
and David Newman and directed
by Don Siegel, shifts tone every
20 minutes, imitating The
Postman Always Rings Twice for
a while and then switching to
screwball comedy. Rip Torn
(who plays a gambler) gets
through it by flashing that great
dirtv smile of his, but Ken Wahl,
who displayed restless drive and
some sensitivity in The Wan
derers and Fort Apache, the
Bronx, seems to know how
fatuous he looks in lace shirts and
immaculate curls (he plays the
blackjack dealer Torn has "jinx
ed" and is following through all
the gambling spots in Nevada),
and he gives a stiff, uncom
fortable performance. Jinxed! is
unspeakably trashy, but unlike
Monsignor it isn't very entertain
ing, perhaps because Bette
Midler is impaled on it. Even her
rendition of the theme song over
the end credits fails to lift one's
spirits.
