# Hospital workers to vote on unionization
## 
### KAREN SPRINGEN 
About 1200 University Hospital service and
maintenance workers will vote for or against union
representation in an election Friday and Saturday.
The University is urging the workers to vote no,
according to University Counsel Priscilla Wheeler.
The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB)
ordered the election earlier this month following a
petition by Local 715 of the Service Employees In
ternational Union AFL-CIO. Local 715, which
represents 10,000 employees, currently serves as
the union bargaining unit for 1350 United Stan
ford Workers.
Michael Baratz, USW executive secretary, said
Local 715 petitioned to the NLRB after more than
a majority of the 1200 workers eligible to vote
including nursing assistants, unit service assistants,
housekeeping workers, dietary workers and main
tenance employees signed authorization cards
circulated last October through April.
To date, Local 715 does not represent any em
ployees at the hospital, a non-profit subsidiary cor
poration of the University. The only union
bargaining unit at the hospital is the Committee for
the Recognition of Nursing Achievement
(CRONA), which represents about 1250 nurses.
"The hospital is urging employees to look close
ly at the facts," said Wheeler. The main question

concerns "how employees at the hospital look at
Local 715," she said. The University and the hospi
tal question whether or not Local 715 best repre
sents hospital employees.
Local 715 already represents about 1200 Valley
Medical Center employees, and "they have better
conditions," Baratz said.
Workers' grievances against management in
cludes scheduling, lack of knowledge of the wage
structure and other "long-term problems," Baratz
said. He said, however, that workers face the "in
credible, awesome resources of management." He
added: "Overall their (the hospital employees')
benefit package may not be as good as other simi
lar institutions."
Baratz said the result of the election will depend
on "whether there is a collective sense. You have to
be together. . . one person cannot take on Sheldon
King (hospital executive vice-president and direc
tor)."
The outcome will also depend on "how much the
hospital. . .can scare them," Baratz said. The Uni
versity tells employees that the union will "take all
their money in dues and go(to Europe with it," he
claimed.
According to Dan Robinson, assistant director

of personnel for employee hospital relations, said
employees do not have a strong pro-union or
ganization, such as the Office Staff Organizing
Committee (OSOC) in the clerical unionization
election last spring. The Hospital Organizing
Committee is "certainly nothing like OSOC was,"
he said.
The University and the hospital are distributing
"factual information about what it means to be in a
union," Robinson said. Informational flyers dis
tributed by the hospital have given information on
the meaning of a strike and the effects of a union on
salaries. The general theme of the flyer campaign is
one encouraging employees to vote no.
According to Ron Just, director of operations
and maintenance at the hospital, "There's a small
handful that will probably vote for the union." Just
estimated that only four or five of the 62 operations
and maintenance employees even turned in author
ization cards.
Workers fear wage and benefit losses, Just said.
He questioned Local 715 as a union best suited to
represent the hospital employees, and noted that
workers had previously voted against Local 35, a
crafts union he described as more suited to employ
ee needs than Local 715.
