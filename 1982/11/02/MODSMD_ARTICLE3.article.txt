Role of Marines in Lebanon to expand
Washington The U.S. Marines in Lebanon, who until now have been
largely isolated in the Beirut International Airport, will expand their duties
to begin "limited" patrols of the main thoroughfares in predominantly
Christian East Beirut, the Reagan administration announced yesterday.
State Department spokesman John Hughes said the 1200 Marines were
ordered by President Reagan to join French and Italian troops in the 3800-
man multinational force in undertaking the new assignment at the request of
Lebanese President Amin Gemayel.
Hughes added that these new duties will involve only part of the U.S. cont
ingent at any one time and will not require any increase in its size.
Pentagon planners have indicated that the force, which entered Beirut
Sept. 25 after the massacre of Palestinian civilians there, may be given in
creasingly broader peace-keeping duties throughout Lebanon to facilitate a
withdrawal of Israeli, Syrian and Palestine Liberation Organization forces
there.
However, Reagan administration officials, sensitive to the potentially
controversial political implications of a widened American role in Lebanon,
sought to stress the limited nature of the new assignment announced yester
day.
(In Beirut, a 19-year-old U.S. Marine and two civilians were wounded
when a car bomb exploded Monday morning less than 100 yards from the
U.S. Marine beachhead in the southern suburbs of Ouzai.
(The explosion about 11:30 a.m. marked the first time there had been any
hostile action against the Marines since they arrived in Beirut five weeks ago
as part of the multinational peace-keeping force.
(As part of the 4200-man force, the Marines' main job is to police the area
around Beirut International Airport. There was little doubt that the Marines
were the target of the explosion, because the area is large
ly unpopulated; the only other people in the area were
motorists and vendors along the side of the busy high
way.
(A spokesman at the American Embassy said the
Marine, a corporal whose name was not available, re
quired only first aid for his superficial wound. One of the
civilians reportedly was wounded seriously.
(No one was arrested in the bombing, which destroyed
the car, although the area was sealed off for a short time.)
Rhetoric ends, balloting begins
Washington On the eve of off-year elections Re
publicans don't expect to win, Democratic campaigners
talked of tougher times ahead while President Reagan
urged Americans "to cast your votes for hope, not de
spair."
The Democratic chairman accused the White House of
plotting post-election cuts in Social Security. Reagan
countered with a pre-recorded assertion that the Demo
crats were trying to scare voters with claims they knew to
be false.
The rhetoric ends, and the balloting begins before sun
up today in New England.
Voters will choose a new House of Representatives, 33
senators and 36 governors. They will elect state legisla
tors in 46 states, and settle ballot issues highlighted by nu
clear freeze votes in nine.
With just one exception, the party of the president has
lost congressional seats in every off-year election since
the Civil War, and GOP strategists expect 1982 to follow
suit.
Their consensus is that Republicans will lose about 20
of their 192 seats in the House. They expect to hold con
trol of the Senate, maybe even tighten it a little.
The campaign ended as it began, with national debate
centered on the troubled economy. Reagan said his is the
course to better times and asked the voters to be patient.
He blamed current economic woes on big-spending gov
ernment policies of the past and said Democrats offer
only more of the same.
The Democratic argument is that Reagan has had his
chance for two years, and that it is time to change eco
nomic policy. Edmund Muskie, former secretary of state,
senator and presidential candidate, was their spokesman
in a recorded, election-eve TV commercial.
Muskie said the decision to be made today is "whether
we stay the course for a privileged few or say America can
do better for all of us."
NATO pushes for spending increase
Mons, Belgium NATO's American commander is
pushing European armies to devote more of their budgets
to a buildup in conventional arms that some alliance of
ficials say could lessen the West's dependence on nuclear
weapons and help defuse expected protests against new
U.S. atomic missiles in Europe.
Promoted by U.S. Gen. Bernard Rogers, the supreme
allied commander in Europe, this focus on accepting the
higher costs of a stronger conventional arsenal is running
into opposition from those already concerned over bigger
defense budgets during a protracted recession.
West Germany and other European allies bridled at
the prospect of new hikes in defense spending and fear
that stressing new conventional arms could in fact under
mine public support for the deployment in Europe next
year of Pershing 2 and ground-launched cruise missiles.
The call for a conventional force buildup coincides
with efforts here at allied command headquarters to re

vise NATO battle plans and incorporate a new gener
ation of conventional missiles capable of massive strikes
deep within Warsaw Pact territory.
Designed to cut off front-line Soviet attack forces from
reinforcements and support troops, the new long-range
missiles have compounded apprehensions of West Eu
ropean governments not accustomed to plotting ex
tensive cross-border warfare and massive ground, as well
as air, penetrations into East European territory.
Another source of potential political friction involves
France, which is not a member of NATO's military struc
ture. The Paris government intends to invest heavily in a
new generation of tactical nuclear weapons for the 19905,
a policy that runs counter to NATO thinking that ad
vanced, costly conventional armaments will dominate
future battlefields.
Man scales Embarcadero Center
San Francisco A proponent of the nuclear weapons
freeze on today's ballot scaled 19 floors of a 45-story of
fice building in San Francisco yesterday 11 months af
ter climbing the same building in another peace gesture.
The man identified by police as Edwin Drummond
used rock-climbing equipment to reach the 19th floor
shortly before 2 p.m. as onlookers gawked from the street
in the city's financial district.
Drummond, who began the ascent at 8:25 a.m., started
to climb down at 4 p.m. and reached the ground about
6:30 p.m., witnesses said. Police cited him for malicious
mischief, disturbing the peace and misdemeanor tres
passing before releasing him, Drummond told reporters.
New Tylenol suspect sought
Chicago Authorities investigating the seven
Tvlenol-cvanide deaths issued an all-points bulletin yes
terday for a man "with a history of mental disorders," Il
linois Attorney General Tyrone Fahner said.
Fahner identified the man as Kevin Masterson, 35, and
said he is wanted for questioning in connection with the
killings.
"An interview with Masterson is essential," Fahner
said in a statement released by the multi-agency task
force investigating the deaths.
Seven people died in the Chicago area in late Septem
ber after swallowing Extra-Strength Tylenol capsules
that had been filled with cyanide.
The FBI is still looking for James Lewis, who is
charged in an alleged $1 million extortion attempt from
Johnson & Johnson, the parent company of the makers
of Tylenol, McNeil Consumer Products Co.
Although Lewis is charged only with extortion, Fahner
repeatedly has said authorities want to question him and
his wife to see if they know anything about the killings.
India, Pakistan agree to talks
New Delhi, India India and Pakistan agreed yester
day to begin official discussions here in December on
long-dormant proposals for a non-aggression treaty.
Meeting for the first time on subcontinent soil, Paki
stani President Mohammed Zia ul-Haq and Indian Prime
Minister Indira Gandhi appeared to have given signifi
cant impetus to the sluggish dialogue on improving Indi
an-Pakistani relations, although both sides acknowl
edged there was no breakthrough in substantive issues
that have prompted three wars and a hectic arms race be
tween the neighbors.
After two hours of talks with Gandhi during a stopover
on his way to Indonesia and Malaysia, Zia was almost ef
fusive about what he termed the "heart-to-heart ex
change," telling reporters that "it couldn't be better" and

adding, "I think, God willing, that it will pave the way to
better relations between Pakistan and India."
"It is not possible to resolve all problems at such a brief
meeting, but it will be a success if doubts and suspicions
between the two countries can be removed," Zia said.
Gandhi merely characterized the talks only as "cor
dial."
The two leaders had met in 1980 in Salisbury during a
celebration of Zimbabwe's independence, and in Bel
grade after the death of Yugoslavia's Marshal Josip Tito,
but it was the first encounter in the region and the first
time since 1972 that a Pakistani president visited India as
the guest of the prime minister.
In a communique, the two leaders agreed to establish a
joint commission to improve relations, particularly in ec
onomic and cultural exchanges, and to hold sub
ministerial level discussions here in December on a Paki
stani draft of a no-war pact and an Indian draft of a "trea
ty of peace, friendship and cooperation."
Gandhi and Zia also said they looked forward to conti
nuing their dialogue at the summit meeting of the non
aligned movement, scheduled to be held here in March.
Poles protest against regime
Warsaw Polish militants turned All Saints Day into
a silent political protest yesterday, unfurling Solidarity
banners and putting up new monuments to demonstrat
ors killed bv the Communist martial law regime.
Police made no attempt to intervene, but remained on
guard in Warsaw and other cities in advance of an eight
hour general strike called by the Solidarity underground
for Nov. 10.
Millions of Poles streamed to cemeteries across the na
tion for the second day yesterday, snarling traffic and car
rying armloads of flowers, candles and wreaths to be
placed on the graves of loved ones.
In Warsaw, protesters put up red banners marked
"Solidarity" at the Powazki Cemetery near a new memo
rial to Maximilian Kolbe, the priest canonized Oct. 10 as
"the protecter of all imprisoned."
They also placed flowers at a nearby unofficial memo
rial for 4500 Polish officers executed in the Katyn forest
in what is now the Soviet Union.
Although responsibility for the deaths of the officers
whose mass grave was discovered in 1943 has not been
officially fixed, most Poles suspect the Soviets, who at the
time of the discovery blamed the Nazis.
The Polish government has refused Solidarity de
mands to erect a monument at the Katyn memorial, now
marked by three rough birch crosses.
Small hand-made placards were placed beneath the
birch crosses Sunday reading: "In Memory of People
who Died in 1956-1982 for Truth and Freedom."
Legislators criticize S. African loan
Washington An anticipated favorable vote by the
United States this week on a $l.l billion International
Monetary Fund loan to South Africa has brought warn
ings from key members of Congress that future U.S. fun
ding for international lending could be in jeopardy.
At least 35 legislators have written Treasury Secretary
Donald Regan opposing the loan outright or urging that
such a loan contain conditions designed to change South
Africa's system of apartheid, or racial separation.
Reagan administration sources have given no public
indication of how the United States will vote tomorrow,
but they say that a delay, which some members of Con
gress have requested, is unlikely, and that the U.S. vote
will be strictly on economic grounds.
A meeting between a Treasury delegation led by Rich
ard Erb, the U.S. executive director to the IMF, and con
gressional staff members a week ago failed to sway

Capitol Hill sentiment, according to participants.
"My greatest concern is that U.S. support for yet an
other IMF loan to South Africa, the largest international
loan in South Africa's history, will be perceived by the
South African government as an endorsement of the gov
ernment's spending priorities and will be viewed by the
non-white community within South Africa as support for
an unjust status quo," Rep. Howard Wolpe (D-Mich.)
chairman of the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on
Africa, wrote Regan.
The loan issue comes at an awkward time for the ad
ministration, as it struggles to maintain momentum for
the centerpiece of its Africa policy, an effort to gain inde
pendence for South African-controlled Namibia.
Pope praises 'contemplative life'
Salamanca, Spain Pope John Paul II journeyed yes
terday to Old Castile to reaffirm the virtues of the con
templative life in the modern world.
Traveling through the historic area north of Madrid,
the pope flew by helicopter to Avila, the famous walled
city and birthplace of St. Teresa of Jesus. The pope said
siie was his "favorite daughter."
He told them how deeply he believed that their con
templative vocation was important not only to them
selves but to Christianity and to the world at large.
He called the nuns "the spearhead of the church."
"The contemplative life continues to occupy a place of
honor in the church," he emphasized.
After meeting with the nuns, he conducted Mass just
under the walls of Old Avila, a setting that overlooks the
rolling plains of Castile.
An estimated 200,000 Spaniards gathered to hear him,
including King Juan Carlos I and Queen Sofia. The
crowd spread down the hillside to the Adaja River.
Queen Sofia was given Communion by the pope. Her
three children were also in attendance.
The pope said in his homily that St. Teresa and her
mentor, St. John of the Cross, also a Spaniard, were two
of the "spiritual teachers of my inner life." He said they
were also "two shining beacons" of the church in Spain
who have "enlightened with their spiritual doctrine the
paths of my country, Poland."
After his morning in Avila, the pope was flown to Alba
de T ormes, the stronghold of the Duke of Alba, where St.
Teresa was buried in 1592.
Here he spoke to thousands more in an open-air cere
mony at which he officially closed the year-long 400 th an
niversary of the death of St. Teresa.
The pope's last visit of the day was to the old university
city of Salamanca. The community boasts three separate
universities; the oldest was founded by Alfonso IX of
Leon about 1218.
The pope arrived in the early evening at the Plaza
Mayor, received a tumultuous welcome as his car, the so
called Popemobile, wound through the tortuous streets.
