## 
### JAY FRAMSON 
Pedestrians and bicyclists on Lausen
Mall near the Engineering Corner were
detoured for an hour yesterday after
noon when construction workers dig
ging up a tree hit a gas pipe.
Stanford police and fire crews sealed
off the area between the Quad and
White Plaza at about 3:30 p.m. while
workers from Pacific Gas and Electric
sealed the leak.
According to Stanford Police Capt.
Raoul Niemeyer, Career Planning and
Placement Center staffers, who could
smell the gas leak, were advised to close
their windows. But a note on the door
yesterday indicated the office closed
earlv.

Construction workers were digging
at about 3:15 p.m. in preliminary work
for a bell tower to be constructed near
the site when they severed a two-inch
gas pipe.
The leak posed no danger for passer
sbv or people working in nearby offices,
Niemeyer said, because a light wind was
blowing at the time.
Students trying to pass between the
Quad and White Plaza or between
Meyer and Green libraries and the
Quad had to go around the roped-off
site either by going up Escondido Mall
or behind Green Library.
Security guards kept the area sealed
off until 4:30 p.m., when PG & E work
ers suceeded in closing the leak.
