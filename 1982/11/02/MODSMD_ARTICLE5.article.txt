# Student attempts suicide
## 
### HEATHER MILLAR 
Graduate student Steven Conradson
was rushed to Cowell Student Health
Center yesterday morning after
slashing his wrists in an attempt to com
mit suicide, according Stanford Police
Capt. Raoul Niemeyer.
Conradson, a fifth-year Ph.D. stu
dent in organic chemistry, was then
transferred to the Redwood City Kaiser
Hospital, according to Dean of Student
Affairs James Lyons.
He was later admitted to the psy
chiatric ward of the Martinez Kaiser
Hospital where a spokesman said the
student was "still being orientated."
The spokesman said it was too early to
make a statement regarding the pa
tient's condition.
The details of the attempt have not
been released by police. Niemeyer said
the incident occurred outside the Old
Organic Chemistry building, but
chemistry students reported seeing par
amedics gathered around the bushes
near the Mudd Chemistry building.
Lyons said the grad student had ap
parently been offered psychiatric help
recently after Conradson's friends
alerted doctors at Cowell's Counseling
and Psychiatric Services.
His mother, Diane Conradson, said,
"Steven was under a lot of pressure.
Like most grad students, he works very
hard." She added that she did not think
this was a suicide attempt. "If Steven
had wanted to take his life, he would
have. 1 think this was a cry for help."
According to Dr. James Mc-
Clenahan, director of Cowell Student
Health Center, about 10 to 20 similiar
incidents gestures as well as serious
attempts occur on campus each year.
"I'm very concerned that the school
would have this much of an effect on
people," said Conradson's mother.
"It's disturbing to think that students
would find it so pressuring as to want to
take their own lives. I don't think any
thing is worth that."
