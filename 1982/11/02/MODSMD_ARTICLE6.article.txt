# Students wage campaigns for candidates
## 
### STEVE KAUFMAN Staff writer 
For some students at Stanford, the
upcoming elections mean no more than
extra junk mail in their post office box
and another table in White Plaza. But
for students like Sue Zaroff, the elec
tions are more than pushing levers in a
voting booth.
Zaroff, the chief coordinator for the
Tom Lantos for Congress Campaign
here, is one of many students who enjoy
getting involved in political campaigns.
"My life is wild right now," said the
Rinconada resident assistant. "I'm
trying to be a good RA and a good or
ganizer at the same time."
"Stanford needs a good student voice
in Washington," she explained. "I
wanted to get involved, and found the
Lantos campaign the most consistent
with mv own personal political beliefs."
She added that personal motivation
and a desire to learn more about the
workings of the political system are the
major reasons why students get in
volved in political campaigns.
Despite the efforts of such volun
teers, political apathy at Stanford is still
viewed bv many students as a problem.

"We were hoping for a good fight from
the Rover for Congress folks," Zaroff
said, "but he has had very little pres
ence. Overall, we are very happy that
the competition isn't strong, but it has
taken a bit of the excitement out of it."
This disappointment in Stanford
apathy is also shared by other volun
teers. Edward Romero, a volunteer for
the Stanford Democrats, believes aca
demic pressure is the major cause of po
litical inactivity. "With 18 units and a
chem problem set, it is difficult to de
vote a lot of time to politics," Romero
said.
"I would say that a majority of the
student body isn't taking an active part
in this election," he said. The current
student apathy is especially surprising
considering the issues involved in this
election, he added.
"The nuclear freeze, student aid cut
backs and the gun initiative are all im
portant issues in students' lives," he
said. "It's sad that many don't know the
stances; it makes them susceptible to a
lot of rhetoric."
Another factor contributing to the
lack of activity is the timing of the elec

tion, Romero said. Because it is not ac
companied by a presidential election,
interest in the issues has dropped com
pared to the 1980 elections.
Organizations such as the Stanford
Democrats and the Stanford Re
publican League have served as the in
itial link between individual candidates
and the student.
"1 became involved in campus poli
tics after attending a meeting of the
Stanford Republican League," said
Terry Miller, a volunteer for the Bill
Rover for Congress Campaign. "I
wanted to get involved, and they steered
me towards the Royer camp, where I
help with precinct blocks and taking
phone calls at headquarters."
For those students involved in these
campaigns, balancing schoolwork and
volunteer activities has proven to be a
chore. "Basically, my classes are on
hold," Zaroff said. "It's a fast-paced
life, full of ballooning, papering the
campus." She added that the hours of
volunteering are often long. "I wake up
at 8:30 or 9 and invariably my phone
rings."
Despite the pressures of campaign
ing, student volunteers believe their

time spent bringing politics closer to
students' lives is not time wasted. "Just
because one is in college doesn't mean
one has to stop out of political life,"
Zaroff explained. "It is possible to re
main aware of major issues even with
the difficulties of academia." She added
that convincing freshmen to register to
vote is a major factor in helping to raise,
political consciousness.
"Often-times, people say that they
will write home for ballots, but this
more often than not never happens,"
she said. According to Zaroff, if
freshmen are shown the importance of
re-registering locally, it often leads to a
greater degree of political activity dur
ing their undergraduate years. "It's im
portant for everyone to know what's
going on; after all, politics are a part of
life."
