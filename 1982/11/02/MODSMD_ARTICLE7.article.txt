## Say it with flowers, clothes: Stanford Mother's Club runs wild 
### MARINA PICCIOTTO 
What do Stanford mothers
look like? Do they pull their
white hair back into a bun and sit
in rocking chairs while their chil
dren study? Or do they have a
tennis tan and ride around in
convertible sports cars between
cocktail parties?
Actually, neither. Stanford
moms look a lot like moms you
saw at your hometown PTA
meetings and the Stanford Moth
er's Club Chrysanthemum Party
held last Sunday, October 24,
looked a lot like a jazzed-up ver
sion of a hometown PTA func
tion. The difference was that the
PTA never did things on quite the
same scale. They didn't have the
Svntex grounds to house their
white elephant sales and they
didn't have Saks Fifth Avenue to
stage a fashion show.
The Mother's Club of Stan
ford is just that: a group of wom
en who arq either parents of stu
dents or of alumni. It is a chari
table organization that raises
money for scholarships through
the Chrysanthemum Party and
mailings to Stanford parents.
Last year it raised enough money
for three full scholarships for the
University and, in addition, gave
donations to the hospital and
other departments in Stanford
that needed help.
The organization began in
1917 when a group of mothers
saw that sick students had no
place to go for health care. The
group tended to students with

colds and flu until they were well
enough to go back to school.
Once the hospital was built, the
Mother's Club was out of a job,
so they formed a charitable or
ganization to become the first
beneficiaries of the hospital.
Today, the hospital has so
many endowments that the
Mother's Club puts its money
into scholarships. (They do, how
ever, still donate a nominal sum
to the hospital every year in
memory of their initial support.)
The Chrysanthemum Party
raises about $12,000 a year for
the club but it still seems to be a
PTA bazaar. Mothers from
around the world send their pre
serves, needlepoint, crafts and
crocheting to be sold at the party,
and Stanford musical groups,
such as the Stanford Mendicants

(bottom right).
The highlight of the party was
the fashion show by Saks Fifth
Avenue with coaches, students
and alumni modeling. The
models were rather shy but that
added to the homey feeling.
Among the models were coaches
George Haines and Skip Man
ning, Mother's Club president
Anne Hopkins and the Stanford
Dollies.
This year's party was a finan
cial success and was attended or
supported by club members from
all over the country. Of course
some of the ladies attending had
white hair pulled back in a bun
and some had tennis tans but all
seemed to have in common that
good mood that seems to come
over mothers when they are
trying to help their kids.
