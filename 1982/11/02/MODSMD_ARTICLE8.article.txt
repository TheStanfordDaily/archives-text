# New aid could cure hearing problems
## 
### MARY CATHERINE FISH 
If you've ever cupped your hand behind your
ear you've noticed that the action increases hear
ing clarity and gives amplification. A new, non
electronic hearing aid provides a similar im
provement in much the same way. Stanford Uni
versity School of Medicine researchers in
troduced the Earesonator at the annual meeting
of the American Academy of Otolaryngology
and Head and Neck Surgery in New Orleans. It
is a possible answer to the kind of mild hearing
problems that affect more than a million Ameri
cans.
Dr. Richard Goode, professor of surgery, and
his colleague, Richard O' Keefe, have been work
ing on the Earesonator for the past four years. It
is worn within the ear, and is basically an exten
tion of acoustical devices dating back to the
1800s. Goode actually tested old hearing aids
from a museum at Kent State University in
Ohio.
According to Goode, medical treatments of
the past consisted mostly of using acoustical de
vices which preceded electronic hearing aids.
"They worked quite well and were very effective
for the time they were developed," he said.
The earliest of these devices were ear trum
pets. When small units for insertion in the ear
were introduced, they got a bad name because
the improvement was minimal. As Goode put it,
"They actually served as earplugs." The devices
were touted as miracle cures for hearing prob
lems, and their history is surrounded by an aura
of quackery. They were consistently declared
fraudulent by the Federal Trade Commission.

With better knowledge of acoustical prin
ciples and more sophisticated instruments, Stan
ford researchers were able to invent the
Earesonator. It is a tiny device made of butyrate
plastic and methyl methacrylate. When it is put
in the ear, the size of the opening of the ear cavity
is changed. There is an opening to the
Earesonator itself which can be adjusted to pro
duce shifts in the resonant frequency of sound
entering the ear cavity, j
Shifting the resonant downward is the key to
the device's efficacy. Usually the ear resonates at
frequencies between 2800 and 4000 Hertz. This
resonance provides 10 to 15 decibels of
amplification. However, the frequencies of 1000

to 2500 Hertz are where most speech frequencies
are, and the unaided ear hardly amplifies these
frequencies at all. When the Earesonator
changes the ear's cavity volume, it enables the
ear to resonate in these important lower frequen
cies, thereby producing 10 to 15 decibels of
amplification.
In most cases, benefits are maximized by
binaural use that is, one in each ear. Each de
vice would be tuned slightly differently in order
to provide as wide a range of amplified frequen
cies as possible. A tone audiogram, which is
basically a graph of percentage hearing loss, is
made from tests done to determine sharpness
and range in the middle frequencies. As well as
having to be fine-tuned, the devices also require
custom fitting. Impressions of the ear are made
and are sent along with the audiogram to the lab
oratories.
The devices have been fitted for 30 patients so
far and are presently available only at Stanford
and the affiliated Palo Alto Veterans Adminis
tration Medical Center. Candidates are screened
carefully and Goode stresses that the
Earesonator is for use in mild hearing loss cases
and cannot perform the functions of a conven
tional aid. However, in cases where a person has
trouble hearing clearly in auditoriums, groups of
people, noisy surroundings and so forth, at $5O
it may be a useful and inexpensive alternative to
an electronic hearing aid, which may cost up to
$3OO. Electronic hearing aids also have problems
such as squeaks, squeals, the need for batteries
and the fragility of the device.
The need for a device like the the Earesonator,
a cheap, convienent hearing aid, is increasing as
the population age distribution is shifting up
ward. Goode feels "it would be nice for people to
have a choice."

Richard O'Keefe, have been

his colleague, Richard O' Keefe, have been work
ing on the Earesonator for the past four years. It
is worn within the ear, and is basically an exten
tion of acoustical devices dating back to the
1800s. Goode actually tested old hearing aids
from a museum at Kent State University in
Ohio.
According to Goode, medical treatments of
the past consisted mostly of using acoustical de
vices which preceded electronic hearing aids.
"They worked quite well and were very effective
for the time they were developed," he said.
The earliest of these devices were ear trum
pets. When small units for insertion in the ear
were introduced, they got a bad name because
the improvement was minimal. As Goode put it,
"They actually served as earplugs." The devices
were touted as miracle cures for hearing prob
lems, and their history is surrounded by an aura
of quackery. They were consistently declared
fraudulent by the Federal Trade Commission.

With better knowledge of acoustical prin
ciples and more sophisticated instruments, Stan
ford researchers were able to invent the
Earesonator. It is a tiny device made of butyrate
plastic and methyl methacrylate. When it is put
in the ear, the size of the opening of the ear cavity
is changed. There is an opening to the
Earesonator itself which can be adjusted to pro
duce shifts in the resonant frequency of sound
entering the ear cavity, j
Shifting the resonant downward is the key to
the device's efficacy. Usually the ear resonates at
frequencies between 2800 and 4000 Hertz. This
resonance provides 10 to 15 decibels of
amplification. However, the frequencies of 1000

to 2500 Hertz are where most speech frequencies
are, and the unaided ear hardly amplifies these
frequencies at all. When the Earesonator
changes the ear's cavity volume, it enables the
ear to resonate in these important lower frequen
cies, thereby producing 10 to 15 decibels of
amplification.
In most cases, benefits are maximized by
binaural use that is, one in each ear. Each de
vice would be tuned slightly differently in order
to provide as wide a range of amplified frequen
cies as possible. A tone audiogram, which is
basically a graph of percentage hearing loss, is
made from tests done to determine sharpness
and range in the middle frequencies. As well as
having to be fine-tuned, the devices also require
custom fitting. Impressions of the ear are made
and are sent along with the audiogram to the lab
oratories.
The devices have been fitted for 30 patients so
far and are presently available only at Stanford
and the affiliated Palo Alto Veterans Adminis
tration Medical Center. Candidates are screened
carefully and Goode stresses that the
Earesonator is for use in mild hearing loss cases
and cannot perform the functions of a conven
tional aid. However, in cases where a person has
trouble hearing clearly in auditoriums, groups of
people, noisy surroundings and so forth, at $5O
it may be a useful and inexpensive alternative to
an electronic hearing aid, which may cost up to
$3OO. Electronic hearing aids also have problems
such as squeaks, squeals, the need for batteries
and the fragility of the device.
The need for a device like the the Earesonator,
a cheap, convienent hearing aid, is increasing as
the population age distribution is shifting up
ward. Goode feels "it would be nice for people to
have a choice."

EARESONATOR: A new, non-electronic
hearing aid developed by Surgery Prof. Richard
Goode and his colleague Richard
O'Keefe has the potential to improve the
Bearing of more than a million Americans.
If you've ever cupped your hand behind your
ear you've noticed that the action increases hear
ing clarity and gives amplification. A new, non
electronic hearing aid provides a similar im
provement in much the same way. Stanford Uni
versity School of Medicine researchers in
troduced the Earesonator at the annual meeting
of the American Academy of Otolaryngology
and Head and Neck Surgery in New Orleans. It
is a possible answer to the kind of mild hearing
problems that affect more than a million Ameri
cans.
