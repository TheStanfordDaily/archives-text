### KEVIN GROSS MIKE HALE 
Democratic Incumbent Tom Lantos
(D-San Mateo) swept to victory in the
11th Congressional District last night,
defeating Republican challenger Bill
Royer by a sound margin following an
expensive, mudslinging campaign.
With 85 percent of the precincts in San
Mateo County reporting, Lantos led by
77,013 votes to Roye.-'s 58,167.
In his victory speech, delivered at
10:30 p.m. before about 1000 exultant
supporters in the Burlingame Machin
ists' Union Hall, Lantos said, "We have
chosen to take the high road, and the
people of the Peninsula have clearly
said they prefer the high road."
Lantos later called his victory "a
landslide" in light of a Republican vic
tory in the California senate race.
Royer conceded the race an hour and
a half after the polls closed. At around
9:45, he rose for the second time to

speak. He said, "with over 70 percent of
the vote in, I am trailing by about
14,000 votes. I feel that this is a bigger
margin than we can overcome ... I feel
good about the overall campaign, al
though it is evident we did not get our
message across."
These candidates were both familiar
to voters in the 11th District, which
runs from Daly City to Palo Alto and
includes the Stanford campus. In 1980
Royer was the incumbent and Lantos
the challenger who in his own words
"didn't have a ghost of a chance." Lan
tos won a narrow, upset victory in that
election.
Campaign tactics and campaign
spending had become the major issues
in the last days of this year's race, and
Lantos emphasized this in his victory
remarks. He said the campaign had
proved Peninsula voters "have a tre
mendous regard for the sanctity of the

electoral process," and said he hoped
that in future campaigns "both sides
will take the high road."
Without naming Royer, Lantos said
he would "not only let bygones be
bygones, but Annette and I will go
home and enjoy our apple pie," a refer
ence to a Royer television commercial
which showed a Lantos look-alike de
vouring an apple pie.
About 20 minutes before his con
cession speech, Royer told his sup
porters "with 42 percent of the vote in,
we are trailing by 6250 votes. But I'm
not conceding a thing. I'm still very op
timistic." However, there was a notice
able quieting of the crowd after this an
nouncement.
While the attitude at the Royer cele
bration appeared on the surface to be
optimistic, campaign workers were ob
viously prepared for defeat. "We've still
