### KEVIN GROSS MIKE HALE 
Democratic Incumbent Tom Lantos
(D-San Mateo) swept to victory in the
11th Congressional District last night,
defeating Republican challenger Bill
Royer by a sound margin following an
expensive, mudslinging campaign.
With 85 percent of the precincts in San
Mateo County reporting, Lantos led by
77,013 votes to Roye.-'s 58,167.
In his victory speech, delivered at
10:30 p.m. before about 1000 exultant
supporters in the Burlingame Machin
ists' Union Hall, Lantos said, "We have
chosen to take the high road, and the
people of the Peninsula have clearly
said they prefer the high road."
Lantos later called his victory "a
landslide" in light of a Republican vic
tory in the California senate race.
Royer conceded the race an hour and
a half after the polls closed. At around
9:45, he rose for the second time to

speak. He said, "with over 70 percent of
the vote in, I am trailing by about
14,000 votes. I feel that this is a bigger
margin than we can overcome ... I feel
good about the overall campaign, al
though it is evident we did not get our
message across."
These candidates were both familiar
to voters in the 11th District, which
runs from Daly City to Palo Alto and
includes the Stanford campus. In 1980
Royer was the incumbent and Lantos
the challenger who in his own words
"didn't have a ghost of a chance." Lan
tos won a narrow, upset victory in that
election.
Campaign tactics and campaign
spending had become the major issues
in the last days of this year's race, and
Lantos emphasized this in his victory
remarks. He said the campaign had
proved Peninsula voters "have a tre
mendous regard for the sanctity of the

electoral process," and said he hoped
that in future campaigns "both sides
will take the high road."
Without naming Royer, Lantos said
he would "not only let bygones be
bygones, but Annette and I will go
home and enjoy our apple pie," a refer
ence to a Royer television commercial
which showed a Lantos look-alike de
vouring an apple pie.
About 20 minutes before his con
cession speech, Royer told his sup
porters "with 42 percent of the vote in,
we are trailing by 6250 votes. But I'm
not conceding a thing. I'm still very op
timistic." However, there was a notice
able quieting of the crowd after this an
nouncement.
While the attitude at the Royer cele
bration appeared on the surface to be
optimistic, campaign workers were ob
viously prepared for defeat. "We've still

got hope," said one young female sup
porter, after hearing the announce
ment.
Meanwhile, at the Lantos campaign
celebration "euphoria" was the word
most often heard from his supporters
and it suited well the atmosphere at the
victory celebration. With Lantos' vic
tory assured, attention there shifted to
the much closer races for senator and
governor and to the exact time of Lan
tos' arrival.
One Royer supporter discussed the
reasons for Royer's defeat. According
to Bill Boyd, an ardent Royer sup
porter, "If you have a photogenic per
sonality, which Lantos has, and you
have money you can win a Con
gressional race."
Royer said, "What's troubled me

most was that we couldn't get across
where the money (for Lantos) was com
ing from. It was not in the best interests
of the district."
Royer has accused Lantos of receiv
ing 90 percent of his campaign funds
from outside the 11th District. Later,
Royer said, "I wish we could have been
more competitive, money-wise."
Lantos, who began his fund-raising
effort in January 1981, raised about
$1.1 million for the race, more than any
other congressional candidate in the na
tion. Royer's final total is expected to
be around $550,000, which is also
among the largest amounts raised by a
congressional candidate.
Lantos' Campaign Manager Timber
Dick said the margin of victory in the
race made it obvious that the spending
edge "didn't matter. We would have
won even if he had equalled our spend
ing dollar for dollar."

Dick said Royer "made a number of
strategic blunders" and that his cam
paign "wasn't effective from a grass
roots standpoint." He said the dif
ference between the Lantos and Royer
campaigns was that Royer didn't give
voters any positive reasons to vote for
him
Lantos himself told reporters, "he
(Royer) didn't lack resources, he lacked
a program and a record."
Joh/i Dunbar, a Royer campaign
aide, cited nationwide Democratic vot
ing trends as another reason for Royer's
defeat. "The district is 54 percent Dem
ocratic registration and 33 percent Re
publican," he said.
Apparently, some of the Royer staff
had been anticipating defeat. One staff
member said, "We tracked the race Fri
day night, and found that Royer was 27
percent back."
Independent polls taken just before

the election had shown the race to be
even, but Lantos' staff members said
their own surveys had indicated a 20
percent edge for Lantos as the race con
cluded. Lantos' Campaign Director
Katrina Lantos-Swett said that while
the ease of the victory didn't surprise
her, the 21,000 vote edge in San Mateo
County "did exceed my expectations."
Lantos aides repeatedly referred to
the success of their canvassing efforts.
Dick said Field Operations Manager
Rick Fijolek "designed a get-out-the
vote effort like I'd never seen."
Royer noted that Peace and Freedom
Party candidate Wilson Branch had re
ceived only 706 votes, with over 50 per
cent of the precincts reporting. In 1981,
in a highly publicized statement, Royer
blamed the position of the levers on vot
ing machines for his loss, because
Branch had received 13,800 votes in the
1980 election.
