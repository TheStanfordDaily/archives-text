# Analysts forecast shift toward left in Congress
## 
### GLEN ALLERHAND 
The Reagan administration will face
increasing difficulty in getting its pro
grams through Congress due to Demo
cratic gains in the House, according to
University election analysts.
"On balance, you'll have a com
petitive Congress," said John Chubb,
assistant political science professor.
Chubb said that in the 1981 tax and
budget battles, House Democrats
needed approximately 20 seats to wield
influence. If a minimal 20-seat Demo
crat gain in the House is assumed,
Chubb said, the party will better be able
to match Republican power.
Initial television network projections
gave the Democrats a gain of between
20 and 34 House seats.
Seymour Martin Lipset, a Hoover
Institution senior fellow, said the con
gressional "bipartisan conservative
coalition won't be able to carry the day.
"I suspect the Democrats will seek to
lower the rate of increase in defense
spending," Lipset added. He said the
change in the House partisan balance
might also affect the third year of the
Reagan administration tax cut. Lipset
said he based his assessment on a radio
broadcast which put House Democrat
ic gains at 27 seats.
Political Science Prof. David
Danelski said, "this will be the year for
(House Speaker) Tip O'Neill to work
with a larger majority." But he cau
tioned that the potential gain of Demo
cratic power depends on which House
members lost.
Chubb cited factors which he said
mitigated a potentially larger Re
publican loss during hard economic
times. For one, the Republicans were
able to attract strong candidates last
year, when Reagan's public standing

was higher and Democrats could not
draw equally strong candidates.
Another factor Chubb said was the
Republicans' sizable campaign fund
advantage which exceeded the Demo
crats' by six or seven times.
Chubb indicated that overall the elec
tion was neither a referendum on Rea
ganomics nor an endorsement of Rea
ganomics.
As for the California U.S. Senate
race, won by San Diego Mayor Pete
Wilson, Chubb said he did not "see how
this could be anything but a response to
Brown as an individual. Wilson, in my
opinion, is not a dynamic, highly attrac
tive candidate."
Lipset agreed, saying the voters were
"pulled in two directions." He sug
gested voters had to decide between
having Brown as senator or having a
Democrat as senator.
On the California gubernatorial race,
Lipset expressed surprise at the dis
crepancy between exit polls, which in
dicated Los Angeles Mayor Tom Brad
ley would win, and initial election te
turns, which showed state Attorney
General George Deukmejian in the
lead. Lipset said that "there may be a
hidden vote" that is based on racial
prejudice.
Deukmejian had fired his campaign
director for suggesting that some Cali
fornia voters would not support a black
candidate.
With regard to Tom Lantos' victory
in the 11th District congressional race,
analysts expressed no surprise. Chubb
said challenger Bill Royer was not a
particularly "attractive candidate." Re
districting that put Palo Alto and Stan
ford in Lantos' district, Chubb added,
also helped the incumbent by increasing
the number of liberal voters.
