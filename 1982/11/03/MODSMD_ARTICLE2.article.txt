"One of the things people who do polls are
accused of doing is ruining elections (with early
predictions)," said pollster Steve Teichner ap
pearing on K ABC-TV. "I don't think we've ru
ined anyone's election tonight."
One thing was certain in advance of the vote
count — this year's governor's race was waged
at the highest cost in state history.
Between them, Bradley and Deukmejian
spent 516.6 million — more than double the
$8.2 million spent in 1978 by Brown and his op
ponent, Evelle Younger.
The higher price tag was credited to a focus
on TV commercials as a campaign tool. The
30-sccond TV spots often cost as much as
$30,000 each in major television markets.
In its final weeks, the gubernatorial cam
paign became volatile — an unexpected turn in
a contest between two soft-spoken men whose
party politics belied their essentially similar
views on many issues.
Both men accused each other of waging "a
nasty, negative campaign." One major flap
arose when a Bradley commercial attempted to
link Deukmejian to Watergate. Another
erupted when Deukmejian's campaign man
ager made a remark about a hidden anti-black
vote which could sway the election.
Deukmejian, who had scrupulously avoided
mention of Bradley's race in the campaign, dis
avowed the remark and fired campaign man
ager Bill Roberts.
Bradley, who has avoided making his race
an issue, called the remark an insult — not to
him but to the voters — and blamed it on Deu

kmejian.
"You cannot disavow your campaign man
ager," said Bradley. "He's the alter-ego of the
candidate."
Both parties claim mandates
Washington — Democratic and Republican
leaders claimed contradictory mandates on
Reaganomics today after midterm elections in
which the Democrats strengthened their
House majority but failed to break the GOP
hold on the Senate.
President Reagan was described as "up
beat" by White House staff chief James Baker,
who also said that when the 98th Congress
takes office in January "we may have to com
promise some more."
But Baker contended that "there's no ques
tion but what the president will continue to be
able to lead this country effectively over the
next two years."
"A disastrous defeat for the president," said
Democratic House Speaker Tip Q'Neill, who
added, "Today, the American people sent a
message: set a fair course."
"I think what the American people said was,
stay the course," said Republican Party chair
man Richard Richards.
Incumbent senators winning
Washington — Senate incumbents won re
election in 15 states last night and led in eight
more as America's voters elected the new Con
gress that will decide whether to stay President
Reagan's course — or stay his hand — for the
next two years.
As the votes were counted in off-year elec
tions dominated by the debate over the econo

my, 10 Democrats and four Republicans won
new Senate terms, and the GOP picked up a
seat in Virginia.
Republicans were leading for more than
enough Senate seats to renew their control of
that chamber in the 98th Congress.
Early returns in closely-contested House
elections pointed to a sizable Democratic gain.
House Speaker Tip O'Neill said the voters
were sending a message to Reagan: "Set a fair
course." But at, the White House, Reagan aide
James Baker said "the president is not groan
ing."
Rep. Paul Trible, in defeating Lt. Gov. Rich
ard Davis, was gaining 52 percent of the Vir
ginia vote to succeed retiring Sen. Harry Byrd,
an independent who had voted for Reagan
programs but for Democratic control of the
chamber.
But Republican Sen. Harrison Schmitt of
New Mexico was trailing Democrat Jeff
Bingaman, the state attorney general. The na
tional television networks said their
projections showed Schmitt would lose.
Republican Senate seats also were in
jeopardy in New Jersey — where Rep. Mil
licent Fenwick trailed Democratic busi
nessman Frank Lautenberg — as well as Mis
souri and Minnesota. There were only sparse
returns from the latter states.
Democrats gain in House
Washington — Democrats outdistanced Re
publicans in dozens of House races where Pres
ident Reagan's economic policies had been a
prime issue and marched toward a sizable mid
term gains yesterday in the chamber they have
controlled for 28 years.

The major Democratic victbries came as
Americans elected a newly reapportioned
House of Representatives drawn to reflect a
10-year population migration to the Sun Belt.
Republicans had once hoped to cash in on
this population shift away from traditionally
Democratic areas. But, with the failure of eco
nomic recovery to materialize, Democrats
seemed well on their way to recouping most of
the House losses they suffered in the 1980 GOP
landslide, when Democrats lost 33 seats.
By mid-evening, Democrats had won or
were leading in 208 districts; Republicans in
128. CBS News projected the overall Demo
cratic gain of 34 seats, and NBC News said the
pickup would be 25 seats.
Brown justices in close battle
Los Angeles — State Supreme Court Justice
Frank Richardson won easy confirmation yes
terday but three appointees of Gov. Brown,
facing an unprecedented Republican-spon
sored challenge, had close battles in early re
turns.
With 5.7 percent of the precincts reporting,
Richardson, the court's most conservative
member and last remaining appointee of Gov.
Ronald Reagan, had a comfortable 72 percent
of the vote.
But Justices Otto Kaus, Allen Broussard
and Cruz Reynoso — targets of the GOP cam
paign against "Jerry's judges" — were having
tougher going, though pollster Mervin Field
on Los Angeles television station KNXT pre
dicted all would be confirmed based on in
terviews with voters leaving the polls.
Kaus had 51 percent of the vote, Broussard
49 percent and Reynoso 45 percent. Each
needed a majority to stay on the court.

"One of the things people who do polls are

One thing was certain in advance of the vote
count — this year's governor's race was waged
at the highest cost in state history.
Between them, Bradley and Deukmejian
spent 516.6 million — more than double the
$8.2 million spent in 1978 by Brown and his op
ponent, Evelle Younger.
The higher price tag was credited to a focus
on TV commercials as a campaign tool. The
30-sccond TV spots often cost as much as
$30,000 each in major television markets.
In its final weeks, the gubernatorial cam
paign became volatile — an unexpected turn in
a contest between two soft-spoken men whose
party politics belied their essentially similar
views on many issues.
Both men accused each other of waging "a
nasty, negative campaign." One major flap
arose when a Bradley commercial attempted to
link Deukmejian to Watergate. Another
erupted when Deukmejian's campaign man
ager made a remark about a hidden anti-black
vote which could sway the election.
Deukmejian, who had scrupulously avoided
mention of Bradley's race in the campaign, dis
avowed the remark and fired campaign man
ager Bill Roberts.
Bradley, who has avoided making his race
an issue, called the remark an insult — not to
him but to the voters — and blamed it on Deu

kmejian.
"You cannot disavow your campaign man
ager," said Bradley. "He's the alter-ego of the
candidate."
Both parties claim mandates
Washington — Democratic and Republican
leaders claimed contradictory mandates on
Reaganomics today after midterm elections in
which the Democrats strengthened their
House majority but failed to break the GOP
hold on the Senate.
President Reagan was described as "up
beat" by White House staff chief James Baker,
who also said that when the 98th Congress
takes office in January "we may have to com
promise some more."
But Baker contended that "there's no ques
tion but what the president will continue to be
able to lead this country effectively over the
next two years."
"A disastrous defeat for the president," said
Democratic House Speaker Tip Q'Neill, who
added, "Today, the American people sent a
message: set a fair course."
"I think what the American people said was,
stay the course," said Republican Party chair
man Richard Richards.
Incumbent senators winning
Washington — Senate incumbents won re
election in 15 states last night and led in eight
more as America's voters elected the new Con
gress that will decide whether to stay President
Reagan's course — or stay his hand — for the
next two years.
As the votes were counted in off-year elec
tions dominated by the debate over the econo

my, 10 Democrats and four Republicans won
new Senate terms, and the GOP picked up a
seat in Virginia.
Republicans were leading for more than
enough Senate seats to renew their control of
that chamber in the 98th Congress.
Early returns in closely-contested House
elections pointed to a sizable Democratic gain.
House Speaker Tip O'Neill said the voters
were sending a message to Reagan: "Set a fair
course." But at, the White House, Reagan aide
James Baker said "the president is not groan
ing."
Rep. Paul Trible, in defeating Lt. Gov. Rich
ard Davis, was gaining 52 percent of the Vir
ginia vote to succeed retiring Sen. Harry Byrd,
an independent who had voted for Reagan
programs but for Democratic control of the
chamber.
But Republican Sen. Harrison Schmitt of
New Mexico was trailing Democrat Jeff
Bingaman, the state attorney general. The na
tional television networks said their
projections showed Schmitt would lose.
Republican Senate seats also were in
jeopardy in New Jersey — where Rep. Mil
licent Fenwick trailed Democratic busi
nessman Frank Lautenberg — as well as Mis
souri and Minnesota. There were only sparse
returns from the latter states.
Democrats gain in House
Washington — Democrats outdistanced Re
publicans in dozens of House races where Pres
ident Reagan's economic policies had been a
prime issue and marched toward a sizable mid
term gains yesterday in the chamber they have
controlled for 28 years.

The major Democratic victbries came as
Americans elected a newly reapportioned
House of Representatives drawn to reflect a
10-year population migration to the Sun Belt.
Republicans had once hoped to cash in on
this population shift away from traditionally
Democratic areas. But, with the failure of eco
nomic recovery to materialize, Democrats
seemed well on their way to recouping most of
the House losses they suffered in the 1980 GOP
landslide, when Democrats lost 33 seats.
By mid-evening, Democrats had won or
were leading in 208 districts; Republicans in
128. CBS News projected the overall Demo
cratic gain of 34 seats, and NBC News said the
pickup would be 25 seats.
Brown justices in close battle
Los Angeles — State Supreme Court Justice
Frank Richardson won easy confirmation yes
terday but three appointees of Gov. Brown,
facing an unprecedented Republican-spon
sored challenge, had close battles in early re
turns.
With 5.7 percent of the precincts reporting,
Richardson, the court's most conservative
member and last remaining appointee of Gov.
Ronald Reagan, had a comfortable 72 percent
of the vote.
But Justices Otto Kaus, Allen Broussard
and Cruz Reynoso — targets of the GOP cam
paign against "Jerry's judges" — were having
tougher going, though pollster Mervin Field
on Los Angeles television station KNXT pre
dicted all would be confirmed based on in
terviews with voters leaving the polls.
Kaus had 51 percent of the vote, Broussard
49 percent and Reynoso 45 percent. Each
needed a majority to stay on the court.

"One of the things people who do polls are
accused of doing is ruining elections (with early
predictions)," said pollster Steve Teichner ap
pearing on K ABC-TV. "I don't think we've ru
ined anyone's election tonight."
One thing was certain in advance of the vote
count — this year's governor's race was waged
at the highest cost in state history.
Between them, Bradley and Deukmejian
spent 516.6 million — more than double the
$8.2 million spent in 1978 by Brown and his op
ponent, Evelle Younger.
The higher price tag was credited to a focus
on TV commercials as a campaign tool. The
30-sccond TV spots often cost as much as
$30,000 each in major television markets.
In its final weeks, the gubernatorial cam
paign became volatile — an unexpected turn in
a contest between two soft-spoken men whose
party politics belied their essentially similar
views on many issues.
Both men accused each other of waging "a
nasty, negative campaign." One major flap
arose when a Bradley commercial attempted to
link Deukmejian to Watergate. Another
erupted when Deukmejian's campaign man
ager made a remark about a hidden anti-black
vote which could sway the election.
Deukmejian, who had scrupulously avoided
mention of Bradley's race in the campaign, dis
avowed the remark and fired campaign man
ager Bill Roberts.
Bradley, who has avoided making his race
an issue, called the remark an insult — not to
him but to the voters — and blamed it on Deu

kmejian.
"You cannot disavow your campaign man
ager," said Bradley. "He's the alter-ego of the
candidate."
Both parties claim mandates
Washington — Democratic and Republican
leaders claimed contradictory mandates on
Reaganomics today after midterm elections in
which the Democrats strengthened their
House majority but failed to break the GOP
hold on the Senate.
President Reagan was described as "up
beat" by White House staff chief James Baker,
who also said that when the 98th Congress
takes office in January "we may have to com
promise some more."
But Baker contended that "there's no ques
tion but what the president will continue to be
able to lead this country effectively over the
next two years."
"A disastrous defeat for the president," said
Democratic House Speaker Tip Q'Neill, who
added, "Today, the American people sent a
message: set a fair course."
"I think what the American people said was,
stay the course," said Republican Party chair
man Richard Richards.
Incumbent senators winning
Washington — Senate incumbents won re
election in 15 states last night and led in eight
more as America's voters elected the new Con
gress that will decide whether to stay President
Reagan's course — or stay his hand — for the
next two years.
As the votes were counted in off-year elec
tions dominated by the debate over the econo

my, 10 Democrats and four Republicans won
new Senate terms, and the GOP picked up a
seat in Virginia.
Republicans were leading for more than
enough Senate seats to renew their control of
that chamber in the 98th Congress.
Early returns in closely-contested House
elections pointed to a sizable Democratic gain.
House Speaker Tip O'Neill said the voters
were sending a message to Reagan: "Set a fair
course." But at, the White House, Reagan aide
James Baker said "the president is not groan
ing."
Rep. Paul Trible, in defeating Lt. Gov. Rich
ard Davis, was gaining 52 percent of the Vir
ginia vote to succeed retiring Sen. Harry Byrd,
an independent who had voted for Reagan
programs but for Democratic control of the
chamber.
But Republican Sen. Harrison Schmitt of
New Mexico was trailing Democrat Jeff
Bingaman, the state attorney general. The na
tional television networks said their
projections showed Schmitt would lose.
Republican Senate seats also were in
jeopardy in New Jersey — where Rep. Mil
licent Fenwick trailed Democratic busi
nessman Frank Lautenberg — as well as Mis
souri and Minnesota. There were only sparse
returns from the latter states.
Democrats gain in House
Washington — Democrats outdistanced Re
publicans in dozens of House races where Pres
ident Reagan's economic policies had been a
prime issue and marched toward a sizable mid
term gains yesterday in the chamber they have
controlled for 28 years.

The major Democratic victbries came as
Americans elected a newly reapportioned
House of Representatives drawn to reflect a
10-year population migration to the Sun Belt.
Republicans had once hoped to cash in on
this population shift away from traditionally
Democratic areas. But, with the failure of eco
nomic recovery to materialize, Democrats
seemed well on their way to recouping most of
the House losses they suffered in the 1980 GOP
landslide, when Democrats lost 33 seats.
By mid-evening, Democrats had won or
were leading in 208 districts; Republicans in
128. CBS News projected the overall Demo
cratic gain of 34 seats, and NBC News said the
pickup would be 25 seats.
Brown justices in close battle
Los Angeles — State Supreme Court Justice
Frank Richardson won easy confirmation yes
terday but three appointees of Gov. Brown,
facing an unprecedented Republican-spon
sored challenge, had close battles in early re
turns.
With 5.7 percent of the precincts reporting,
Richardson, the court's most conservative
member and last remaining appointee of Gov.
Ronald Reagan, had a comfortable 72 percent
of the vote.
But Justices Otto Kaus, Allen Broussard
and Cruz Reynoso — targets of the GOP cam
paign against "Jerry's judges" — were having
tougher going, though pollster Mervin Field
on Los Angeles television station KNXT pre
dicted all would be confirmed based on in
terviews with voters leaving the polls.
Kaus had 51 percent of the vote, Broussard
49 percent and Reynoso 45 percent. Each
needed a majority to stay on the court.
