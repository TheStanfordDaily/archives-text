lower rebuilding begins

" Construction of the new bell tower be
• tween Cubberley Education Building and
The Career Planning and Placement Center,
which was interrupted on Monday when
workers hit a gas pipe, is underway and
scheduled to be finished "before February"
according to Shirley Chen, the project man
ager.
! The new tower will house four of the five
original bells and the original clockworks
; that have been restored by Emeritus Prof.
• Henry Fuchs and aides.
Originally on the top of Memorial
Church, the clock tower included a dial,
\ bells and the internal works. The earthquake
of 1906 destroyed the original clock tower as
well as the dial.A new wooden tower was
£ built, but in 1967 was torn down as a result
J of a University site improvement plan. The
works and three of the bells were put on dis
• play in the Terman Engineering Library.
! A person "closely affiliated with the Uni
; versity" contributed "a personal gift to re
~ build the tower," said Chen.
When finished, the tower's clock will keep
time and the bells will chime.

Award honors Vucinich
A newly created prize for the most impor
tant contribution to Slavic studies published
in the United States in the last calendar year,
has been created to commend Prof. Wayne
Vucinich, head of the Center for Russian
and East European Studies (CREES).

Dorothy Atkinson, executive director of
the American Association for the Advance
ment of Slavic Studies (A A ASS), announced
the creation of the award at a convention
held in Washington, D.C. recently.
Vucinich, who has worked at the Univer
sity since 1946, holds the Robert and Flor

ence McDonnell endowed professorship for
East European history.
As chairperson of CREES since 1972,
Vucinich "has been an influence in establish
ing (the University) as one of the leading
centers for Russian and East European stud
ies in this country," said Atkinson. "He has
done this both through his own personal
contributions and by inviting specialists,"
added Atkinson.
Vucinich "has been an active member in
the field both nation-wide and international
ly," said Atkinson,"And this prize was given
in honor and recognition of his contribu
tions." The award was planned secretly
while Vucinich was away.
Zinoviev to speak
On Monday, Nov. 8 at 8 p.m. Soviet
philosopher, novelist and dissident Alex
ander Zinoviev will speak in Annenberg
Auditorium.
Sponsored by the Associated Students
Speakers Bureau, Zinoviev's talk will cover
U.S.-Soviet relations.
A member of the philosophy faculty at the
University of Moscow, Zinoviev also had a
research appointment at the Institute of Phi
losophy of the Soviet Academy of Sciences
before his defection.
Zinoviev has authored two major works:
The Yawning Heights and The Radiant
Future. His defection was influenced by the
publication of The Yawning Heights in the
western world.
Leonid Brezhnev revoked Zinoviev's
citizenship because of "behavior damaging
to Soviet prestige."

Prof, assumes Argonne post
Prof. Dirk Walecka, former chairman of
the physics department, has been named an
Argonne Fellow at the Argonne National
Laboratory.
The newly established post is awarded to
distinguished scientist or engineer "who has

achieved very high distiction and pre
eminence in his or her field.
While working for the University,
Walecka served as chairman of the Faculty
Senate and was associate dean of humanities
and sciences.
An internationally reknowned theoretical
physicist, Walecka will research the "fun
damental phenomena involved in the scat

tering of energetic electrons by nuclei," an
area in which Walecka is well-informed.
Context names alternatives
Context system users who are unable to
complete their programs by the Dec. 31 clos
ing date will be able to use a similar system in
the (iraduate School of Business (GSB) until
July I, 1983 announced the Center for In
formation Technology (CIT).
Those with books, dissertations or similar
copy in the system will have to fill out an ap
plication form available in the Context of
fices, 115 Pine Hall (telephone 497-4376).
The system which is operated by CIT is
being discontinued because it has not paid
for itself since its installation in the summer
of 1981.
Alternative use seminars presented by the
Context staff with the Administrative In
formation Svstems, Computer Systems and
Services and Instruction and Research In
formation Systems offered options includ
ing comercial word processors, personal
computers, the CIT IBM 3081 (a large main
frame computer here) and possible use of
context systems on other campus com
puters.
In an effort to ease the removal of the
Context system, CIT has increased efforts to
improve the services of the IBM 3081 main
frame. A new Xerox high-speed printer will
hopefully be able to print files prepared with
TeX, a typesetting program developed by
Computer Sciences Prof. Donald Knuth. In
April, a full-screen version of the editing sys
tem of the IBM 3081 is scheduled to be
readv.
