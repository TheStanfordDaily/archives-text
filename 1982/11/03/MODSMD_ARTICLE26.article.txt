## Stanford spikers fall to Hawaii 
### STEPHEN STRENG 
The No. 2-ranked University
of Hawaii narrowly defeated
fourth-ranked Stanford 3-1 in
women's volleyball Monday at
Maples Pavilion in a match

which featured a confrontation
between two of the country's
most dominant middle blockers,
Hawaii's Dietra Collins and
Stanford's Kim Oden.
The anticipated match-up was

overshadowed by the defenses
and outside hitters, however,
with more screaming smashes
and spectacular digs occurring in
the course of one point than usu
ally happen in a game.
Hawaii won the match-decid
ing fourth game, 16-14, on a kill
bv Hawaii's other star middle
blocker, sophomore Lisa Strand.
The Cardinal had fallen behind
early, 4-0, as it had in most of the
previous games, but was able to
tie it up at 4-4 on smashes by
sophomore outside hitter Susan
Compton. Stanford then went
ahead when Oden nailed an er
rant W'ahine bump for the go
ahead point.
The Cardinal was able to in
crease its lead to 12-6 and ap
peared to have the game under
control when Hawaii went on a
seven-point tear that was cul
minated hv two straight service
aces by sophomore Sue
Hemenwav, giving the Wahine
the lead at 13-12.
The two teams then began the
heart-stopping finish that almost
sent the crowd of 550 into hyster
ics. The teams began by exchang
ing side-outs five straight times
until Cardinal sophomore
middle blocker Brandace Hope
blocked a Collins kill to tie the
score at 13-13. Stanford and Ha
waii then exchanged side-outs
once more with Stanford gaining
the advantage on a tip of a bad set
that caught Hope bv surprise but
also surprised the shocked
Wahine as it dropped in good. A
double hit call on Hawaii then
sent the score to 14-13 as Stan
ford stood only one point away
from victory. Hawaii got a side
out, though, and a Hemenway
smash, a double-hit call, and
Strand's kill gave the match to
Hawaii.

Stanford came out roaring in
the first game, taking advantage
of a tentative, pressing Hawaii.
The Cardinal built up a 10-6 lead
as Oden blocked and smashed,
outplaying her Hawaiian coun
terpart. The Wahine came back
to grab a momentary lead at
13-11, but an Oden smash, a
Strand shot into the net, and two
double-hit calls gave the
Cardinal a 15-13 win.
Stanford was unable to over
come early, large deficits in the
next two games as Collins began
to assert herself.
The Cardinal lost the second
game 15-10 after falling behind
11-4. In the third game, after fall
ing behind X-0, Stanford came
back to tie at 11-11 before bow
ing out 15-12.
"You can't give up those
streaks of points like that," said a
dejected Stanford assistant coach
Don Shaw. "It just makes it too
hard on you."
"We're not readv to play Ha
waii vet," he added. "Thev're the
best team in the country, I
think." Shaw made a point of
emphasizing "yet," though.
Tonight at 7:30 p.m.
the Cardinal takes on the Univer
sity of Pacific in a non-con
ference game at Maples Pavilion.
Stanford has already lost one
game to UOP, that coming early
in the season in the Tachikara In
vitational Tournament.
"They're rated No. 3 in the
country, and they deserve to be
there," said Shaw. "Thev're a re
ally good team."
The UOP game will be the last
home game of the season for the
Cardinal, and will be the last
game in Maples for seniors J.J.
(Jearhart, Deanna Bovette, and
kisi Haine. Bovette has been a
starter since her freshman vear.

fourth-ranked Stanford 3-1 in
women's volleyball Monday at
Maples Pavilion in a match

which featured a confrontation
between two of the country's
most dominant middle blockers,
Hawaii's Dietra Collins and
Stanford's Kim Oden.
The anticipated match-up was

overshadowed by the defenses
and outside hitters, however,
with more screaming smashes
and spectacular digs occurring in
the course of one point than usu
ally happen in a game.
Hawaii won the match-decid
ing fourth game, 16-14, on a kill
bv Hawaii's other star middle
blocker, sophomore Lisa Strand.
The Cardinal had fallen behind
early, 4-0, as it had in most of the
previous games, but was able to
tie it up at 4-4 on smashes by
sophomore outside hitter Susan
Compton. Stanford then went
ahead when Oden nailed an er
rant W'ahine bump for the go
ahead point.
The Cardinal was able to in
crease its lead to 12-6 and ap
peared to have the game under
control when Hawaii went on a
seven-point tear that was cul
minated hv two straight service
aces by sophomore Sue
Hemenwav, giving the Wahine
the lead at 13-12.
The two teams then began the
heart-stopping finish that almost
sent the crowd of 550 into hyster
ics. The teams began by exchang
ing side-outs five straight times
until Cardinal sophomore
middle blocker Brandace Hope
blocked a Collins kill to tie the
score at 13-13. Stanford and Ha
waii then exchanged side-outs
once more with Stanford gaining
the advantage on a tip of a bad set
that caught Hope bv surprise but
also surprised the shocked
Wahine as it dropped in good. A
double hit call on Hawaii then
sent the score to 14-13 as Stan
ford stood only one point away
from victory. Hawaii got a side
out, though, and a Hemenway
smash, a double-hit call, and
Strand's kill gave the match to
Hawaii.

Stanford came out roaring in
the first game, taking advantage
of a tentative, pressing Hawaii.
The Cardinal built up a 10-6 lead
as Oden blocked and smashed,
outplaying her Hawaiian coun
terpart. The Wahine came back
to grab a momentary lead at
13-11, but an Oden smash, a
Strand shot into the net, and two
double-hit calls gave the
Cardinal a 15-13 win.
Stanford was unable to over
come early, large deficits in the
next two games as Collins began
to assert herself.
The Cardinal lost the second
game 15-10 after falling behind
11-4. In the third game, after fall
ing behind X-0, Stanford came
back to tie at 11-11 before bow
ing out 15-12.
"You can't give up those
streaks of points like that," said a
dejected Stanford assistant coach
Don Shaw. "It just makes it too
hard on you."
"We're not readv to play Ha
waii vet," he added. "Thev're the
best team in the country, I
think." Shaw made a point of
emphasizing "yet," though.
Tonight at 7:30 p.m.
the Cardinal takes on the Univer
sity of Pacific in a non-con
ference game at Maples Pavilion.
Stanford has already lost one
game to UOP, that coming early
in the season in the Tachikara In
vitational Tournament.
"They're rated No. 3 in the
country, and they deserve to be
there," said Shaw. "Thev're a re
ally good team."
The UOP game will be the last
home game of the season for the
Cardinal, and will be the last
game in Maples for seniors J.J.
(Jearhart, Deanna Bovette, and
kisi Haine. Bovette has been a
starter since her freshman vear.
