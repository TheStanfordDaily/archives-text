# Club booters shock national teams in Hawaii
## 
### JENNIFER SEYMOUR 
As the only university team
competing in the Royal Hawai
ian International women's soccer
tournament last week in Hon
olulu, Stanford could not have
been up against anv stiffer com
petition. Among the tour
nament's entries were Leiahi's
and world champion Taiwan's
national teams, and a host of oth
er seasoned international teams.
Fifteen members of Stanford's
soccer club fought their way to
the semi-final rounds of the tour
nament, ultimately losing to the
two teams that competed in the
tourney finals, Taiwan and
Leiahi.

"l think that if we play during
our regular season the way we
played in Hawaii," Stanford full
back Stephanie Beames said,
"We could really go places, and
probably be the best in our
league."
, "Our performance made those
present respect and recognize us
as a team to look out for," said
Stanford coach Tony lgwe."We
played well against national
teams that have plaved together
two and three years."
Stanford beat Monte Bello
from Los Angeles 5-1 in first
round plav, and shut out Royal
Hawaii 3-0 in the next round.
Captain Sue More led the team

in scoring, with a tourney hat
trick.
It was the match with Taiwan
which culminated Stanford's
tournament plav. Neck-and
ncck with the top women's soccer
team in the world, Stanford
staved off Taiwan's attack until,
in the last seven minutes of the
game, a defensive error let
Taiwan score. Taiwan went on
take the tourney title, ousting
Leiahi 2-1 in overtime play of the
finals.
"Every skill we had ever prac
ticed or learned, they (Taiwan)
implemented," said Beames.
" rhev were beautiful players.
But we forced them to make mis

takes, kept them from making
any plavs."
"Everyone had a job on the
field and everyone did it," com
mented lgwe."The goalies were
outstanding, everyone played
well. We had a goal before we
came to the tournament, .and
here we implemented it."
After losing by such a near
margin to Taiwan, Stanford lost
to L.eiahi 3-1.
"After Taiwan beat us, the
team was really bummed," re
counts Beames. "It was hard to
get psyched to plav after that."
The tournament was an ex

pensive one for team members,
who had to pay their own way to
Honolulu, and for the team itself,
which had to finance other tour
nament expenses. Despite this,
and the loss to Taiwan, both
players and coach were excited
about the trip's outcome.
"The international experience
was very good for the team, and
especially for individuals who
plan to go on in soccer and play
after college," said More.
"Adidas is sponsoring a tour
nament here (Stanford) in May,"
said Igwe. "We look forward to
hosting these teams then."
