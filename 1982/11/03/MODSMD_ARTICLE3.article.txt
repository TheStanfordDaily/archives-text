# Zschau takes 12th District in a landslide
## 
### KATHY CHRISTIE Staff writer 
Singing and dancing were the order
of the evening last night at the post-elec
tion party of newly-elected Republican
Rep. Ed Zschau. Zschau, who will rep
resent California's 12th district, which
includes portions of San Mateo, Santa
Clara and Stanislaus Counties, beat
Democratic opponent Emmett Lynch
by a margin of 2 to 1.
Zschau, a former professor at Stan
ford and Harvard business schools and
a former president of System In
dustries, a minicomputer company
which he founded, cited his "quali
fications and positions on the issues" as
the crucial reasons for his victory.
"People were interested in the econo
my, and they wanted someone who was
in business to represent them," said
Zschau
The current ill -health of the economy
emerged as the primary issue in this
campaign as it did throughout the na
tion. The candidates' positions on the
economy differed sharply. At a forum
last week held at the Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center, Lynch said "If we
continue on the current course, I sus

pect we will be in a much worse disaster
than we are now."
Zschau refused to blame the Reagan
administration for the current re
cession. Instead he blamed the re
cession on the high interest rates, which
1 he said were imposed by the Carter ad
ministration.
Zschau, like Reagan, supports the
view that a reduced deficit and re
strained government spending are the
most important methods for obtaining
economic recovery.
Both candidates favored a nuclear
freeze, the Equal Rights Amendment
and federal funding of abortions.
Jan Schroeder, campaign manager
for Lynch, said Stanislaus County,
which contains only 15 percent of the
voters and is 55 percent Democratic,
may have swung the election, due to
"not getting the support of some of the
people in the area that we were hoping
for."
Although Schroeder said Lynch did
extensive campaigning in the county,
Zschau claimed that Lynch only went
there twice, while he spent one or two
days a week in the "gerrymandered"
county. Zschau said he had to concen

trate on Stanislaus in an effort to get rid
of his reputation as a "city slicker"
there.
Differences in spending between the
candidates were large, with Zschau hav
ing the overwhelming edge. Zschau said
he raised approximately $600,000,
while at the SLAC forum Lynch said he
would spend about $50,000. Zschau
said business was the source of much of
his support, and Lynch cited labor and
education interests as being his major
contributors.
Zschau's victory speech came at 11
p.m., when only 10,000 votes had been
tallied. In his speech, he said that in ad
dition to helping him win the election,
he felt that campaigning had helped
him meet the people in his district and
"see what had to be done."
"I want to involve as many people as
I can in the government of our coun
try," he said. He also thanked the 2000
to 3000 volunteers who worked on the
campaign in his speech.
Although he has never served in pub
lic office, Zschau is confident of his abil
ity to perform well.
