New York — The striking National Football League players
union yesterday made major concessions to management, in
cluding dropping its demands for a percentage of television rev
enues and a centra! fund. The Associated Press learned.
With the strike in its 43rd day and a seventh regular-season
weekend a likely casualty by today, the union was virtually
abandoning several key elements of its financial package.
Management, too, made a concession in its bargaining posi
tion by agreeing to include players' performance and incentive
bonuses in the collective bargaining agreement.
The latest concession by the union is its third since the talks
began. The players originally sought 55 percent of all NFL
gross revenues, and later modified that to a demand for 50 per
cent of the TV revenues. Now, they have backed off that, too.
The union is seeking, instead, only a guarantee that it receive
a share in any renegotiated TV package. In other words, if the
lucrative cable television market becomes part of the NFL's ov
erall package before the existing $2.1-billion TV contract ex
pires after the 1986 season, the union would get a share of it.
Like the TV percentage demand, the central fund was con
sidered a cornerstone of the union's proposal — and likewise
has been opposed by the management council, the owners'
bargaining unit.
The owners also are offering for the first time a com
prehensive severance package based on the minimum annual
wage scale.
