Norway, Japan may ignore whaling ban
Washington — Norway and Japan took steps yesterday that
would allow them to ignore the forthcoming worldwide
moratorium on commercial whaling, prompting Secretary of
State George Shultz to warn of possible economic sanctions in
retaliation.
In Tokyo, Japanese officials announced plans to lodge a for
mal complaint against the ban, a move that would allow com
mercial hunting of whales after the ban takes effect in 1986.
The International Whaling Commission imposed the
moratorium last July with strong support from the United States
in an effort to stem the worldwide decline in the whale popu
lation. The action was hailed as a victory for conservationists.
Hours after Japan's announcement, Norwegian Fisheries
Minister Thor Listau said his country will continue to hunt
whales in the northeast Atlantic Ocean after 1986.
The moves set off a round of diplomatic negotiations between
the United States and officials of the two nations. Japan is one of
the world's leading whaling nations.
The formal objections filed by Japan and Norway are the only
legal steps required for whaling nations to exempt themselves
from the Whaling Commission's ban.
Japan now catches an estimated 13,000 to 14,000 whales each
year, including sperm whales, which are on the American en
dangered species list.
"If Japan ignores the moratorium, it's the end of the whales,"
said Lew Regenstein of the Fund for Animals, one of the groups
that pushed for the international ban. "It will make it impossible
to achieve conservation measures in the future."
Pope decries Gonzalez campaign
Madrid — Pope John Paul II shook hands with Spain's Social
ist premier-designate yesterday but seven hours later took the of
fensive against his campaign pledges to liberalize the laws against
divorce, contraception and abortion.
The Roman Catholic pontiff said his meeting with Felipe
Gonzalez, whose Socialist Party won last week's general election
bv a landslide, should "remove any doubts — if there ever were
any — about my respect for the country's freely elected leaders."
He told Gonzalez and other political and military leaders the
church respects "the temporal order of things" but must speak
out on matters "that have to do with God and influence the cons
cience of his children, in their private and public lives."
And John Paul spoke out later with one of his strongest
statements on what his church calls "family issues" at a twilight,
open-air "Mass for the Christian Family." Police estimated 1.5
million people jammed the Paseo de la Castellana, one of Ma
drid's main arteries.
Denouncing abortion, his voice rising with emotion, he asked:
"What sense is there to speak about the dignity of man and his
fundamental rights if you don't protect an innocent or if you al
low doctors and public or private (medical) services to destroy
defenseless human lives?"
He attacked artificial birth control as "a falsification of the in
terior truth of conjugal love." And he said of divorce, "Accord
ing to God's plan, marriage is a community of love indissoluble
and lasting for life."
The platform on which the Socialists won a majority in the
Spanish parliament last Thursday includes proposals to establish
family planning centers in all public health facilities, to make
divorce easier and to permit abortion where the life of the mother
is in danger. It also wants to reduce government subsidies to pa
rochial schools.
The Catholic church refrained from active participation in the
election campaign but made clear its strong disapproval of these
platform planks.

Carter's memoirs disclose spy deals
Washington — The Soviet Union, in a 1979 deal worked out
with top aides to President Carter, agreed not to execute a spy
condemned to death after being caught working for the United
States in Russia.
The revelation that the Soviets "agreed not to execute... one of
our spies who had been condemned to die," is included in the
just-published memoirs of the former president as an entry in his
diary on April 26, 1979.
Carter discloses that the heretofore secret American attempt
to save the life of the unidentified spy was part of a larger nego
tiation in which the administration arranged for five leading So
viet human-rights activists to leave the Soviet Union. In return,
the U .S. sent back to Moscow two Soviet employees of the Unit
ed Nations in New York who were convicted here of espionage.
The swap involving the Soviet dissidents and what Carter, in
his memoirs, calls the "two United Nations minor spies" was
rather widely publicized at the time. The portion involving the
spy for the United States, presumably a Russian who was caught
in the Soviet Union, was not made public here.
When asked about the comment in Carter's new book, "Keep
ing Faith," two former senior officials in his administration ex
pressed the view that the ex-president had committed an "in
discretion," as one put it, by revealing this.
The negotiations over the fate of the spy were conducted in
private between former Carter national security adviser
Zbigniew Brzezinski and his deputy, David Aaron, and Soviet
Ambassador to the United States Anatoliy Dobrynin. A condi
tion of those talks, officials said, was that they would not be
made public.
Other officials said it is unusual for an American president to
voluntarily acknowledge that there are American spies inside the
Soviet Union.
Soviets declare arms talks near deadlock
Moscow — A ranking Soviet military leader said last night that
Soviet-American arms control negotiations in Geneva are ap
proaching a "deadlock" because of calculated U.S. attempts to
block any progress in the talks.
Col. Gen. Nikolai Chervov, who is head of the general staff
department on strategic weapons and a member of the inner
leadership of the armed forces, accused the Reagan adminis
tration of deliberately seeking to create an impression that some
progress was being made at the two sets of negotiations in Gene
va.
"Actually, nothing of the sort has happened," the general said
in an interview distributed by the official news agency Novosti.
Chervov's comment was the most direct official statement on
the progress of the superpower talks on curbing medium-range
nuclear weapons in Europe and reducing strategic armaments. It
seemed to be in line with a harsher tone adopted by Soviet Presi
dent Leonid Brezhnev recently. In two of his latest speeches deal
ing with foreign policy, Brezhnev had made no mention of the
Geneva negotiations.
Germans to minimize dei sse increases
Bonn, West Germany — Defense Minister Manfred Woerner
said yesterday that the Reagan administration should not expect
major increases in West German military spending in the near
term under the new conservative Bonn government.
But, apparently eager to do something tangible to back up a
promise to stabilize U.S.-German relations, Woerner hinted he
would announce an expanded German contribution to the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization's infrastructure fund next
week.

Touching on a wide range of alliance matters in an interview,
the minister confirmed that unpublicized West German prepara
tions to accept new U.S.-made Pershing II nuclear missiles at the
end of 1983 were "on schedule." He reaffirmed Bonn's willing
ness to follow through with the deployment if U.S.-Soviet arms
reduction talks fail, but said he expected more "serious protests"
in West Germany before the missiles arrive.
Commenting on recent calls by Gen. Bernard Rogers, the
NATO commander in Europe, to pay more for expensive new
conventional armaments, Woerner said he also favored greater
alliance emphasis on conventional weaponry to lessen depen
dence on the nuclear deterrent. But this, he added, was a
longterm proposition, and, stressing the continued importance
of nuclear weapons to deter war, Woerner cautioned Rogers and
others against raising public expectations that a prospective con
ventional buildup might alleviate shorter term needs to mod
ernize NATO's nuclear arsenal.
S. African guerilla attacks on upswing
Washington — A Washington lobby group that has previously
obtained sensitive classified documents says it has been given a
U.S. intelligence report that warns that the African National
Congress, the main guerrilla group operating in South Africa, is
gaining strength and is weighing a more militant strategy involv
ing attacks on white civilian targets.
A second document made available to The Washington Post
by Trans-Africa, a black American lobby group on African af
fairs, suggests that the white-minority government in South
Africa is discussing suppression of reliable reports of successful
guerrilla attacks to protect white morale.
That report is contained in what Trans-Africa describes as a
copy of a page from the April 15, 1982, National Intelligence
Daily, a highly classified compilation of current intelligence in
formation from the CIA, the Defense Intelligence Agency, the
National Security Agency and other intelligence sources. It is
circulated by the CIA director, as head of U.S. intelligence, to a
limited number of senior policy-makers in the White House, the
Cabinet and elsewhere in Washington and to certain military
commanders overseas.
The daily summary said Pretoria was considering new and
stricter limitations on publicizing terrorist attacks because "the
ANC benefits from press coverage of its attacks." That, in turn,
the summary said, "will strengthen the militants in the ANC who
want the group to engage in spectacular attacks against whites."
Stocks rally for moderate gain
The stock market staged a broad rally yesterday in surprising
ly heavy election-day trading, although blue-chip issues pulled
back from their peaks of the session.
Electronic, aerospace, financial, drug and energy stocks paced
the advance.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 13.98 points
Monday, had climbed another 26.49 points as trading moved
into its final two hours yesterday. But the measure then pulled
back and closed with a 16.38-point gain at 1,022.08.
Gainers led more than four to one over losers on the New
York Stock Exchange, whose composite index rose 1.20 to 79.12,
and 343 issues reached new 52-week highs.- Big Board volume
swelled to 104.77 million shares from 73.53 million in the pre
vious session.

"What sense is there to speak about the dignity of man and his
fundamental rights if you don't protect an innocent or if you al
low doctors and public or private (medical) services to destroy

He attacked artificial birth control as "a falsification of the in

The platform on which the Socialists won a majority in the
Spanish parliament last Thursday includes proposals to establish

Carter's memoirs disclose spy deals
Washington — The Soviet Union, in a 1979 deal worked out
with top aides to President Carter, agreed not to execute a spy
condemned to death after being caught working for the United
States in Russia.
The revelation that the Soviets "agreed not to execute... one of
our spies who had been condemned to die," is included in the
just-published memoirs of the former president as an entry in his
diary on April 26, 1979.
Carter discloses that the heretofore secret American attempt
to save the life of the unidentified spy was part of a larger nego
tiation in which the administration arranged for five leading So
viet human-rights activists to leave the Soviet Union. In return,
the U .S. sent back to Moscow two Soviet employees of the Unit
ed Nations in New York who were convicted here of espionage.
The swap involving the Soviet dissidents and what Carter, in
his memoirs, calls the "two United Nations minor spies" was
rather widely publicized at the time. The portion involving the
spy for the United States, presumably a Russian who was caught
in the Soviet Union, was not made public here.
When asked about the comment in Carter's new book, "Keep
ing Faith," two former senior officials in his administration ex
pressed the view that the ex-president had committed an "in
discretion," as one put it, by revealing this.
The negotiations over the fate of the spy were conducted in
private between former Carter national security adviser
Zbigniew Brzezinski and his deputy, David Aaron, and Soviet
Ambassador to the United States Anatoliy Dobrynin. A condi
tion of those talks, officials said, was that they would not be
made public.
Other officials said it is unusual for an American president to
voluntarily acknowledge that there are American spies inside the
Soviet Union.
Soviets declare arms talks near deadlock
Moscow — A ranking Soviet military leader said last night that
Soviet-American arms control negotiations in Geneva are ap
proaching a "deadlock" because of calculated U.S. attempts to
block any progress in the talks.
Col. Gen. Nikolai Chervov, who is head of the general staff
department on strategic weapons and a member of the inner
leadership of the armed forces, accused the Reagan adminis
tration of deliberately seeking to create an impression that some
progress was being made at the two sets of negotiations in Gene
va.
"Actually, nothing of the sort has happened," the general said
in an interview distributed by the official news agency Novosti.
Chervov's comment was the most direct official statement on
the progress of the superpower talks on curbing medium-range
nuclear weapons in Europe and reducing strategic armaments. It
seemed to be in line with a harsher tone adopted by Soviet Presi
dent Leonid Brezhnev recently. In two of his latest speeches deal
ing with foreign policy, Brezhnev had made no mention of the
Geneva negotiations.
Germans to minimize dei sse increases
Bonn, West Germany — Defense Minister Manfred Woerner
said yesterday that the Reagan administration should not expect
major increases in West German military spending in the near
term under the new conservative Bonn government.
But, apparently eager to do something tangible to back up a
promise to stabilize U.S.-German relations, Woerner hinted he
would announce an expanded German contribution to the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization's infrastructure fund next
week.

Touching on a wide range of alliance matters in an interview,
the minister confirmed that unpublicized West German prepara
tions to accept new U.S.-made Pershing II nuclear missiles at the
end of 1983 were "on schedule." He reaffirmed Bonn's willing
ness to follow through with the deployment if U.S.-Soviet arms
reduction talks fail, but said he expected more "serious protests"
in West Germany before the missiles arrive.
Commenting on recent calls by Gen. Bernard Rogers, the
NATO commander in Europe, to pay more for expensive new
conventional armaments, Woerner said he also favored greater
alliance emphasis on conventional weaponry to lessen depen
dence on the nuclear deterrent. But this, he added, was a
longterm proposition, and, stressing the continued importance
of nuclear weapons to deter war, Woerner cautioned Rogers and
others against raising public expectations that a prospective con
ventional buildup might alleviate shorter term needs to mod
ernize NATO's nuclear arsenal.
S. African guerilla attacks on upswing
Washington — A Washington lobby group that has previously
obtained sensitive classified documents says it has been given a
U.S. intelligence report that warns that the African National
Congress, the main guerrilla group operating in South Africa, is
gaining strength and is weighing a more militant strategy involv
ing attacks on white civilian targets.
A second document made available to The Washington Post
by Trans-Africa, a black American lobby group on African af
fairs, suggests that the white-minority government in South
Africa is discussing suppression of reliable reports of successful
guerrilla attacks to protect white morale.
That report is contained in what Trans-Africa describes as a
copy of a page from the April 15, 1982, National Intelligence
Daily, a highly classified compilation of current intelligence in
formation from the CIA, the Defense Intelligence Agency, the
National Security Agency and other intelligence sources. It is
circulated by the CIA director, as head of U.S. intelligence, to a
limited number of senior policy-makers in the White House, the
Cabinet and elsewhere in Washington and to certain military
commanders overseas.
The daily summary said Pretoria was considering new and
stricter limitations on publicizing terrorist attacks because "the
ANC benefits from press coverage of its attacks." That, in turn,
the summary said, "will strengthen the militants in the ANC who
want the group to engage in spectacular attacks against whites."

Norway, Japan may ignore whaling ban
Washington — Norway and Japan took steps yesterday that
would allow them to ignore the forthcoming worldwide
moratorium on commercial whaling, prompting Secretary of
State George Shultz to warn of possible economic sanctions in
retaliation.
In Tokyo, Japanese officials announced plans to lodge a for
mal complaint against the ban, a move that would allow com
mercial hunting of whales after the ban takes effect in 1986.
The International Whaling Commission imposed the
moratorium last July with strong support from the United States
in an effort to stem the worldwide decline in the whale popu
lation. The action was hailed as a victory for conservationists.
Hours after Japan's announcement, Norwegian Fisheries
Minister Thor Listau said his country will continue to hunt
whales in the northeast Atlantic Ocean after 1986.
The moves set off a round of diplomatic negotiations between
the United States and officials of the two nations. Japan is one of
the world's leading whaling nations.
The formal objections filed by Japan and Norway are the only
legal steps required for whaling nations to exempt themselves
from the Whaling Commission's ban.
Japan now catches an estimated 13,000 to 14,000 whales each
year, including sperm whales, which are on the American en
dangered species list.
"If Japan ignores the moratorium, it's the end of the whales,"
said Lew Regenstein of the Fund for Animals, one of the groups
that pushed for the international ban. "It will make it impossible
to achieve conservation measures in the future."
Pope decries Gonzalez campaign
Madrid — Pope John Paul II shook hands with Spain's Social
ist premier-designate yesterday but seven hours later took the of
fensive against his campaign pledges to liberalize the laws against
divorce, contraception and abortion.
The Roman Catholic pontiff said his meeting with Felipe
Gonzalez, whose Socialist Party won last week's general election
bv a landslide, should "remove any doubts — if there ever were
any — about my respect for the country's freely elected leaders."
He told Gonzalez and other political and military leaders the
church respects "the temporal order of things" but must speak
out on matters "that have to do with God and influence the cons
cience of his children, in their private and public lives."
And John Paul spoke out later with one of his strongest
statements on what his church calls "family issues" at a twilight,
open-air "Mass for the Christian Family." Police estimated 1.5
million people jammed the Paseo de la Castellana, one of Ma
drid's main arteries.
Denouncing abortion, his voice rising with emotion, he asked:
"What sense is there to speak about the dignity of man and his
fundamental rights if you don't protect an innocent or if you al

defenseless human lives?"

Soviets declare arms talks near deadlock
Moscow — A ranking Soviet military leader said last night that
Soviet-American arms control negotiations in Geneva are ap
proaching a "deadlock" because of calculated U.S. attempts to
block any progress in the talks.
Col. Gen. Nikolai Chervov, who is head of the general staff
department on strategic weapons and a member of the inner
leadership of the armed forces, accused the Reagan adminis
tration of deliberately seeking to create an impression that some
progress was being made at the two sets of negotiations in Gene
va.
"Actually, nothing of the sort has happened," the general said
in an interview distributed by the official news agency Novosti.
Chervov's comment was the most direct official statement on
the progress of the superpower talks on curbing medium-range
nuclear weapons in Europe and reducing strategic armaments. It
seemed to be in line with a harsher tone adopted by Soviet Presi
dent Leonid Brezhnev recently. In two of his latest speeches deal
ing with foreign policy, Brezhnev had made no mention of the
Geneva negotiations.
Germans to minimize dei sse increases
Bonn, West Germany — Defense Minister Manfred Woerner
said yesterday that the Reagan administration should not expect
major increases in West German military spending in the near
term under the new conservative Bonn government.
But, apparently eager to do something tangible to back up a
promise to stabilize U.S.-German relations, Woerner hinted he
would announce an expanded German contribution to the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization's infrastructure fund next
week.

Touching on a wide range of alliance matters in an interview,
the minister confirmed that unpublicized West German prepara
tions to accept new U.S.-made Pershing II nuclear missiles at the
end of 1983 were "on schedule." He reaffirmed Bonn's willing
ness to follow through with the deployment if U.S.-Soviet arms
reduction talks fail, but said he expected more "serious protests"
in West Germany before the missiles arrive.
Commenting on recent calls by Gen. Bernard Rogers, the
NATO commander in Europe, to pay more for expensive new
conventional armaments, Woerner said he also favored greater
alliance emphasis on conventional weaponry to lessen depen
dence on the nuclear deterrent. But this, he added, was a
longterm proposition, and, stressing the continued importance
of nuclear weapons to deter war, Woerner cautioned Rogers and
others against raising public expectations that a prospective con
ventional buildup might alleviate shorter term needs to mod
ernize NATO's nuclear arsenal.
S. African guerilla attacks on upswing
Washington — A Washington lobby group that has previously
obtained sensitive classified documents says it has been given a
U.S. intelligence report that warns that the African National
Congress, the main guerrilla group operating in South Africa, is
gaining strength and is weighing a more militant strategy involv
ing attacks on white civilian targets.
A second document made available to The Washington Post
by Trans-Africa, a black American lobby group on African af
fairs, suggests that the white-minority government in South
Africa is discussing suppression of reliable reports of successful
guerrilla attacks to protect white morale.
That report is contained in what Trans-Africa describes as a
copy of a page from the April 15, 1982, National Intelligence
Daily, a highly classified compilation of current intelligence in
formation from the CIA, the Defense Intelligence Agency, the
National Security Agency and other intelligence sources. It is
circulated by the CIA director, as head of U.S. intelligence, to a
limited number of senior policy-makers in the White House, the
Cabinet and elsewhere in Washington and to certain military
commanders overseas.
The daily summary said Pretoria was considering new and
stricter limitations on publicizing terrorist attacks because "the
ANC benefits from press coverage of its attacks." That, in turn,
the summary said, "will strengthen the militants in the ANC who
want the group to engage in spectacular attacks against whites."

Norway, Japan may ignore whaling ban
Washington — Norway and Japan took steps yesterday that
would allow them to ignore the forthcoming worldwide
moratorium on commercial whaling, prompting Secretary of
State George Shultz to warn of possible economic sanctions in
retaliation.
In Tokyo, Japanese officials announced plans to lodge a for
mal complaint against the ban, a move that would allow com
mercial hunting of whales after the ban takes effect in 1986.
The International Whaling Commission imposed the
moratorium last July with strong support from the United States
in an effort to stem the worldwide decline in the whale popu
lation. The action was hailed as a victory for conservationists.
Hours after Japan's announcement, Norwegian Fisheries
Minister Thor Listau said his country will continue to hunt
whales in the northeast Atlantic Ocean after 1986.
The moves set off a round of diplomatic negotiations between
the United States and officials of the two nations. Japan is one of
the world's leading whaling nations.
The formal objections filed by Japan and Norway are the only
legal steps required for whaling nations to exempt themselves
from the Whaling Commission's ban.
Japan now catches an estimated 13,000 to 14,000 whales each
year, including sperm whales, which are on the American en
dangered species list.
"If Japan ignores the moratorium, it's the end of the whales,"
said Lew Regenstein of the Fund for Animals, one of the groups
that pushed for the international ban. "It will make it impossible
to achieve conservation measures in the future."
Pope decries Gonzalez campaign
Madrid — Pope John Paul II shook hands with Spain's Social
ist premier-designate yesterday but seven hours later took the of
fensive against his campaign pledges to liberalize the laws against
divorce, contraception and abortion.
The Roman Catholic pontiff said his meeting with Felipe
Gonzalez, whose Socialist Party won last week's general election
bv a landslide, should "remove any doubts — if there ever were
any — about my respect for the country's freely elected leaders."
He told Gonzalez and other political and military leaders the
church respects "the temporal order of things" but must speak
out on matters "that have to do with God and influence the cons
cience of his children, in their private and public lives."
And John Paul spoke out later with one of his strongest
statements on what his church calls "family issues" at a twilight,
open-air "Mass for the Christian Family." Police estimated 1.5
million people jammed the Paseo de la Castellana, one of Ma
drid's main arteries.
Denouncing abortion, his voice rising with emotion, he asked:
"What sense is there to speak about the dignity of man and his
fundamental rights if you don't protect an innocent or if you al
low doctors and public or private (medical) services to destroy
defenseless human lives?"
He attacked artificial birth control as "a falsification of the in
terior truth of conjugal love." And he said of divorce, "Accord
ing to God's plan, marriage is a community of love indissoluble
and lasting for life."
The platform on which the Socialists won a majority in the
Spanish parliament last Thursday includes proposals to establish
family planning centers in all public health facilities, to make
divorce easier and to permit abortion where the life of the mother
is in danger. It also wants to reduce government subsidies to pa
rochial schools.
The Catholic church refrained from active participation in the
election campaign but made clear its strong disapproval of these
platform planks.

Carter's memoirs disclose spy deals
Washington — The Soviet Union, in a 1979 deal worked out
with top aides to President Carter, agreed not to execute a spy
condemned to death after being caught working for the United
States in Russia.
The revelation that the Soviets "agreed not to execute... one of
our spies who had been condemned to die," is included in the
just-published memoirs of the former president as an entry in his
diary on April 26, 1979.
Carter discloses that the heretofore secret American attempt
to save the life of the unidentified spy was part of a larger nego
tiation in which the administration arranged for five leading So
viet human-rights activists to leave the Soviet Union. In return,
the U .S. sent back to Moscow two Soviet employees of the Unit
ed Nations in New York who were convicted here of espionage.
The swap involving the Soviet dissidents and what Carter, in
his memoirs, calls the "two United Nations minor spies" was
rather widely publicized at the time. The portion involving the
spy for the United States, presumably a Russian who was caught
in the Soviet Union, was not made public here.
When asked about the comment in Carter's new book, "Keep
ing Faith," two former senior officials in his administration ex
pressed the view that the ex-president had committed an "in
discretion," as one put it, by revealing this.
The negotiations over the fate of the spy were conducted in
private between former Carter national security adviser
Zbigniew Brzezinski and his deputy, David Aaron, and Soviet
Ambassador to the United States Anatoliy Dobrynin. A condi
tion of those talks, officials said, was that they would not be
made public.
Other officials said it is unusual for an American president to
voluntarily acknowledge that there are American spies inside the
Soviet Union.
