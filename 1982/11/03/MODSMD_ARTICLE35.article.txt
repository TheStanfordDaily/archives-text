# State swept for murder suspect

### SID ATKINS Staff writer 
Police have so far been unable to lo
cate the prime suspect in the recent
slaying of a Stanford student, who they
believe is hiding in one of the outlying
counties of Northern California where
some of his relatives live.
Lieutenant Ron Conway ofthe Santa
Clara County Sheriffs Department
said he is sure the suspect, Donald
Amos, knows he is wanted by the po
lice. "He knows we want him, and he's
not going to turn himself in," Conway
said. "People in his neighborhood con
tacted him and told him that we were in
the area with a search warrant on Fri
day night," he said.
Amos fled his San Jose home with his
wife and has not been seen since shortly
after the killing took place a little over a
week ago.
A delivery man with a criminal rec
ord, Amos is wanted in connection with
the Oct. 22 stabbing of Angela
Arvidson. Arvidson was cleaning a fac
ulty member's home in the
Frenchman's hill neighborhood of
campus when she was fatally assaulted.
Police believe that Amos made a de
livery to that house, where Arvidson
worked part-time to help pay her tui
tion.
Amos' past criminal record includes
an arrest for rape, kidnapping and as
sault with a deadly weapon. He served
time in the Santa Cruz County Jail for
the latter charge.
Police have issued an all-points bul
letin to patrolmen across the nation in
order to apprehend Amos. The two pri
mary investigators from the Santa
Clara County Sheriffs Department are
still working on the case, but now they
are receiving help in the investigation
from police in those California counties
where Amos has relatives. So far the po
lice have been unable to contact any of
Amos' relatives.
In another effort to locate Amos, po
lice are putting together a flyer that will
be distributed in the counties where he
is believed to be hiding, according to
Captain Raoul Niemeyer of the Stan
ford Police Department. The flyer will
contain a picture of Amos, his wife, and
his car, along with an explanation of
why he is wanted.
Niemeyer said,"The idea is to flood
the counties where Amos has reason to
be with the flyers and hope that some
one gives us a tip. We'll either catch him
like that or we'll spot him from a patrol
car. Maybe we'll pull him over for a
traffic violation."
Conway said there is no new evidence
that would link Amos to the killing, but
that there is already sufficient informa
tion available to arrest him.
