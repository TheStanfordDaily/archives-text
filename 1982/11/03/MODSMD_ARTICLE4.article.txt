# University humanities rank poorly

Stanford's faculty placed in the top
10 in only two of nine humanities grad

leased nationwide survey by a branch of
the National Academy of Sciences
(NAS). In the survey, the English De

while the Philosophy Department re

the survey, has been used in the past to
judge the quality of a University's pro

Vice-Provost Gerald Lieberman,
dean of graduate studies, said, "I

Stanford up in number one, two or
three."
In addition to English and philoso

linguistics and music.
The survey, in which Lieberman par
ticipated, was done two years ago and
thus does not include improvements in
the humanities graduate programs that
have taken place since then, he said. For
example, the ratings do not reflect dist

President Donald Kennedy took office,
he said.
"Kennedy has made that (improve
ments in humanities programs) an ob
ject of his administration," he said.
