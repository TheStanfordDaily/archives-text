# University humanities rank poorly
## 
### KAREN SPRINGEN 
Stanford's faculty placed in the top
10 in only two of nine humanities grad
uate programs rated in a recently re
leased nationwide survey by a branch of
the National Academy of Sciences
(NAS). In the survey, the English De
partment achieved a tenth place rating
while the Philosophy Department re
ceived an eighth place ranking.
The faculty rating, one of 12 areas in
the survey, has been used in the past to
judge the quality of a University's pro
grams.
Vice-Provost Gerald Lieberman,
dean of graduate studies, said, "I
wouldn't say that Stanford's not in
cluded ... clearly we would like to see
Stanford up in number one, two or
three."
In addition to English and philoso
phy, the survey rated classics, art his
tory, French, German, Spanish,
linguistics and music.
The survey, in which Lieberman par
ticipated, was done two years ago and
thus does not include improvements in
the humanities graduate programs that
have taken place since then, he said. For
example, the ratings do not reflect dist
inguished appointments made since
President Donald Kennedy took office,
he said.
"Kennedy has made that (improve
ments in humanities programs) an ob
ject of his administration," he said.
Dean of Humanities and Sciences
Norman Wessells said, "There's a pe
culiar lagin this kind ofthing. . .Ittakes
awhile for the news to get out." He
pointed to the new humanities center as
evidence of the efforts to further de
velop humanities here.
Wessells said building a stronger hu-
manities program "is a challenge but
not one to be discouraged."
The National Research Council, a
branch of the NAS, conducted the sttfc
vev by asking more than a 1000 pftf
fessors to rate the departments of uni
versities throughout the nation. In the
faculty ratings, Harvard led in three
fields including classics, philosophy
and Spanish literature, while Y&le
ranked number one in English and
French and tied with Princeton and the
University of Wisconsin-Madison for
first in German.
Princeton, the University of Chicago
and UC-Berkeley shared the top rating
in music. In the fields surveyed, Cal and
Yale each rated in the top five seven
times.
Unfortunately, Lieberman said, the
National Academy of Sciences sent
only one copy of the results to the Uni
versity. "There's only one copy in the
University and the President hasn't
even gotten it,"he said.
Stanford rated above Harvard in
four of the nine categories, said
Lieberman. But he quipped, "It's true
that Harvard was above Stanford in
five of the nine."
