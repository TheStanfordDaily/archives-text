# Professor re-elected
## Sher prevails in Assembly 
### KATHY OLMSTED 
Incumbent California Assemblyman
Byron Sher (D-Palo Alto) yesterday de
feated Republican challenger Bill
Parkinson in the race to represent Stan
ford and Palo Alto in Sacramento.
With 72.2 percent of the precincts re
ported in Santa Clara County, Sher led
Parkinson 35,905 votes to 14,756. With
42 out of 86 precincts reported in San
Mateo County, Sher had 64 percent of
the vote to Parkinson's 30.5 percent in
the balloting for the 21st Assembly dis
trict, which emcompasses parts of both
counties.
Sher, a law professor at the Univer
sity for the past 25 years, was quietly
confident of victory early in the eve
ning. With just the absentee ballot
count in, he said he was happy with the
way the campaign had gone.
"I'm pleased," he said. "I think we
ran a good campaign."
Sher won handily in the low-key cam
paign, marked by its lack of mud-sling
ing among the candidates. The former
Palo Alto mayor and city councilman
cited the support of his district mem
bers and the endorsements of every lo
cal paper as contributing to his success.
He also pointed to his record in the As
sembly as a factor in his victory.
"I had a fairly good first term," he
said, adding that he had kept in touch
with the people in his distrct and ex
perienced success in his legislative pro
grams.
Kip Upper, Sher's campaign man
ager, also cited Sher's service as a legis
lator as a major reason for his win.
"People recognized the good job that
Bvron's done for the last two years," he
said.
Parkinson, who was thought by
many to have run the race to get name
recognition for use in a later contest,
was in rather good spirits after his de
feat.
"I'm generally pretty happy — and

it's not always easy to be happy in de
feat," he said when contacted by phone
after 15 percent of the precincts had re
ported.
Parkinson said he was pleased with
the way the campaign had gone, and
was glad that the candidates had not re
sorted to personal attacks.
"There's always a temptation to take
the easy way out in politics," he said.
"I'd rather sit here and lose than do
that." Sher agreed that they had con
ducted a "good, clean kind of cam
paign."'
Sher accurately predicted a
"healthy" victory early on.
"I think I'm gonna win," he said, af
ter receiving the absentee vote totals,
which placed him substantially ahead in
the race, even though absentee voters
are traditionally conservative.
Sher was never seriously challenged
by Parkinson, but he suggested that his
opponent might try again for another
office.
"He's interested in politics, he's an
attractive young guv, and it's clear he'll
be running again for some office," he
said of Parkinson. Parkinson refused to
speculate on the possibility that he
might run for another office, but said
that the campaign had enabled him to
"make the connections" with the peo
ple necessary to "win an Assembly
seat.'*9
Parkinson said he was pleased that he
had received as many votes as he did,
considering that he was fighting an in
cumbent whooutspent him nearly 10 to
I. He estimated that he had spent
SS(XX). Sher said he expected his total
campaign expenditures to range from
$50,000 to $55,000.
Sher agreed that he had an advantage
in the campaign.
"Clearly I had more resources than
the other candidates," he said, adding
that he thought Parkinson never ex
pected to win.

The minor candidates in the race re
ceieved very small percentages of the
vote. Frank De Sio of the Peace and
Freedom Party received 1.2 percent of
the vote in Santa Clara County and 2.4
percent in San Mateo County. Russell
Fridlev, a Libertarian, received 2.2 per
cent of the Santa Clara County votes
and 2.9 percent of the San Mateo Coun
ty votes.
Parkinson said he maintained his en
thusiasm throughout the campaign.
"We never gave up," he said.
Throughout the race clear differences
emerged between the candidates' posi
tions on the issues. Sher supported
Proposition 11 (the bottle bill), Propo
sition 12 (the nuclear freeze initiative)
and Proposition 15 (the handgun con
trol initiative), all of which were op
posed by Parkinson.
Sher's victory party at his elegant
home in Palo Alto was rather quiet and
reserved, with campaign workers
evidently confident of their candidate's
success but upset by the projected de
feats of several Democratic candidates.
At one point, the party was surprised
to see Sher's 1980 defeated opponent,
Greg Morris, serving as a political ana
lyst on one of the local news shows.
"Just think Byron," one observer
pointed out,"if you had lost you
could've been on (television) tonight."

bers and the endorsements of every lo
cal paper as contributing to his success.
He also pointed to his record in the As
sembly as a factor in his victory.
"I had a fairly good first term," he
said, adding that he had kept in touch
with the people in his distrct and ex
perienced success in his legislative pro
grams.
Kip Upper, Sher's campaign man
ager, also cited Sher's service as a legis
lator as a major reason for his win.
"People recognized the good job that
Bvron's done for the last two years," he
said.
Parkinson, who was thought by
many to have run the race to get name
recognition for use in a later contest,
was in rather good spirits after his de
feat.
"I'm generally pretty happy — and

it's not always easy to be happy in de
feat," he said when contacted by phone
after 15 percent of the precincts had re
ported.
Parkinson said he was pleased with
the way the campaign had gone, and
was glad that the candidates had not re
sorted to personal attacks.
"There's always a temptation to take
the easy way out in politics," he said.
"I'd rather sit here and lose than do
that." Sher agreed that they had con
ducted a "good, clean kind of cam
paign."'
Sher accurately predicted a
"healthy" victory early on.
"I think I'm gonna win," he said, af
ter receiving the absentee vote totals,
which placed him substantially ahead in
the race, even though absentee voters
are traditionally conservative.
Sher was never seriously challenged
by Parkinson, but he suggested that his
opponent might try again for another
office.
"He's interested in politics, he's an
attractive young guv, and it's clear he'll
be running again for some office," he
said of Parkinson. Parkinson refused to
speculate on the possibility that he
might run for another office, but said
that the campaign had enabled him to
"make the connections" with the peo
ple necessary to "win an Assembly
seat.'*9
Parkinson said he was pleased that he
had received as many votes as he did,
considering that he was fighting an in
cumbent whooutspent him nearly 10 to
I. He estimated that he had spent
SS(XX). Sher said he expected his total
campaign expenditures to range from
$50,000 to $55,000.
Sher agreed that he had an advantage
in the campaign.
"Clearly I had more resources than
the other candidates," he said, adding
that he thought Parkinson never ex
pected to win.

The minor candidates in the race re
ceieved very small percentages of the
vote. Frank De Sio of the Peace and
Freedom Party received 1.2 percent of
the vote in Santa Clara County and 2.4
percent in San Mateo County. Russell
Fridlev, a Libertarian, received 2.2 per
cent of the Santa Clara County votes
and 2.9 percent of the San Mateo Coun
ty votes.
Parkinson said he maintained his en
thusiasm throughout the campaign.
"We never gave up," he said.
Throughout the race clear differences
emerged between the candidates' posi
tions on the issues. Sher supported
Proposition 11 (the bottle bill), Propo
sition 12 (the nuclear freeze initiative)
and Proposition 15 (the handgun con
trol initiative), all of which were op
posed by Parkinson.
Sher's victory party at his elegant
home in Palo Alto was rather quiet and
reserved, with campaign workers
evidently confident of their candidate's
success but upset by the projected de
feats of several Democratic candidates.
At one point, the party was surprised
to see Sher's 1980 defeated opponent,
Greg Morris, serving as a political ana
lyst on one of the local news shows.
"Just think Byron," one observer
pointed out,"if you had lost you
could've been on (television) tonight."


Assemblyman Byron Sher
Incumbent California Assemblyman
Byron Sher (D-Palo Alto) yesterday de
feated Republican challenger Bill
Parkinson in the race to represent Stan
ford and Palo Alto in Sacramento.
With 72.2 percent of the precincts re
ported in Santa Clara County, Sher led
Parkinson 35,905 votes to 14,756. With
42 out of 86 precincts reported in San
Mateo County, Sher had 64 percent of
the vote to Parkinson's 30.5 percent in
the balloting for the 21st Assembly dis
trict, which emcompasses parts of both
counties.
Sher, a law professor at the Univer
sity for the past 25 years, was quietly
confident of victory early in the eve
ning. With just the absentee ballot
count in, he said he was happy with the
way the campaign had gone.
"I'm pleased," he said. "I think we
ran a good campaign."
Sher won handily in the low-key cam
paign, marked by its lack of mud-sling
ing among the candidates. The former
Palo Alto mayor and city councilman
cited the support of his district mem
bers and the endorsements of every lo
cal paper as contributing to his success.
