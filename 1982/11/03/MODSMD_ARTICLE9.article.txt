# Lantos puts emotion-packed campaign behind him
## 
### MIKE HALE Senior staff writer 
Rep. Tom Lantos (D-San Mateo)
said last night that his post-victory
plans were "to go home, have an apple
pie and go to sleep."
Lantos was referring to a television
commercial aired by his Republican
challenger, Bill Royer, which showed a
Lantos look-alike devouring an apple
pie that represented the national
budget. The advertisement was seen by
many as the low point of a campaign
that was known more for its tactics than
its issues.
Lantos' victory speech was con
cerned mainly with the ethics of the
campaign, and he said later that while
he had "no scientific measure" of the ef
fects of Royer's tactics "literally
thousands of people have commended
us for our issue-oriented campaign"
over the last few weeks.
He said he did not feel that the apple
pie commercial was a turning point in
the race, as many of his supporters
claim, but that it "capsulized the at

titude of the opposition" toward 11th
District voters.
"The opposition clearly underrated
the people of the Peninsula," he said.
"Even if the ad gave us a few extra
votes, I'd rather have a higher level" of
campaign from both sides, he added.
Lantos said he was not surprised at
the apparently large margin of victory,
having predicted that he would win by
25,000 votes.
Royer, in his concession remarks, re
ferred to Lantos' $1.1 million campaign
chest as a major reason for his victory.
Lantos refused to comment on the ef
fect of spending levels in the race,
saying, "I have no reaction to anything
my opponent has to say anymore."
He added, "it's ludicrous for Re
publicans to poor-mouth themselves
when they outspend Democrats by
heavy margins" in most races. He said
he will continue to support legislation
that would place limits on campaign
fund-raising and expenditures.
Lantos noted that Royer received the
endorsement of the largest daily news

paper in the district (the San Mateo
Times), as well as the support of the
Reagan administration and of outgoing
12th District Rep. Paul McCloskey(R-
Menlo Park), which all helped to offset
his spending disadvantage. McCloskey
campaigned extensively for Royer and
criticized the sources of Lantos' cam
paign funds.
Lantos cited voter response to his leg
islative record and to his service for the
district while in Congress as the reasons
for his victory.
"The people of the Peninsula have
again demonstrated they are ticket
splitters," Lantos said, "who judge can
didates on their own merits."
Calling himself an "independent"
legislator, Lantos said, "that is why I fit
the Peninsula so well."
Lantos said his main objective in the
next session of Congress would be to
urge the Reagan administration to pro
pose "a bilateral, verifiable nuclear
freeze" to the Soviet Union. The nucle
ar arms race, he said, is "the paramount

issue of our age."
He said an arms freeze is necessary
"both for reasons of peace, and to save
$33 billion a year," the amount he esti
mates a freeze would eliminate in mili
tary expenditures.
Citing unemployment as the primary
domestic issue, Lantos called current
unemployment figures "unacceptable."
He said Royer had totally embraced
President Reagan's economic policies,
and that the election had served as a
"referendum on the failed economic
policies of the administration."
Lantos said he expected that the next
Congress, with its larger Democratic
majority in the House, will be more suc
cessful in promoting Democratic eco
nomic plans.
"With the increased majority, many
policies we have proposed but haven't
pushed through" will have a better
chance, he said. He predicted that the
coalition of Republicans and Southern
Democrats that has supported adminis
tration economic policies will fall apart.
