To "Several Senior Managers
in The Office of Development" ■■■
For my performance evaluation for 1981-2, as well as in
previous years, I was told that my relationship with". . .
several senior managers in the Office of
Development.. had to be improved. Ever since I have
been in my current position, I have been secretly
evaluated by you, and, in spite of my asking my
supervisor who you are, what you were asked, and what
you said, 1 am never informed. Perhaps in the interest of
fairness you will step forward and answer these
questions. Thank you.
Henry P. Organ, Associate Director
