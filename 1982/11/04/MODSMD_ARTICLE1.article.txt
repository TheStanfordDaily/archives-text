Democrats make big election gains
Washington — The Democrats counted their gains from Capitol Hill to
the county courthouses yesterday, after a midterm election that left Presi
dent Reagan confronting a choice between compromise and stalemate on his
basic program.
Reagan said Republicans have "every reason to feel good" about retain
ing the eight-vote U.S. Senate majority that they won on his coattails in 1980.
But that was about their only consolation prize on a day that saw the Demo
crats considerably strengthen their hand Tuesday by gaining 26 House seats,
seven governorships and at least nine state legislative houses.
Although the Democrats failed to gain in the number of seats they hold in
the Senate, they won 20 of the 33 contested on Tuesday and "came within a
whisper," in the words of Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee
chairman Wendell Ford of Kentucky, of wresting back control of that
chamber. A shift of just 43,000 votes in five states — Nevada, Rhode Island,
Vermont, Missouri and Wyoming — would have given the Democrats those
seats and Senate control.
"So much for Republican realignment dreams," said Democratic Na
tional Chairman Charles Manatt, savoring a victory that will magnify his
party's voice in policy decisions for the next two years and improve its pros
pects for the 1984 presidential race.
While Reagan insisted publicly that he was "very pleased" with the out
come, House Speaker Thomas (Tip) O'Neill (D-Mass.) declared it "a dis
astrous defeat for the president."
Bradley considers recount
Los Angeles — The counting is over, the verdict is in: Republican George
Deukmejian beat Democrat Tom Bradley by a skimpy 52,295 votes out of
7.5 million cast for governor. But Bradley refused to concede yesterday and
is thinking about a possible recount.
"We shall look at the figures as quickly as possible to determine whether
there is any basis for asking for a recount," said Bradley, the 64-year-old Los
Angeles mayor who came agonizingly close to becoming the first elected
black governor in the nation's history.
Whether he concedes or not, all the votes have been counted and all that
remains now is the clean-up canvass that could take as much as 28 days.

State election officials in Sacra
mento confirmed that there are from
40,000 to 50,000 ballots that remain to
be processed for one reason or anoth
er — bent or mutilated punchcard
ballots, improperly directed or de
layed ballots, and other technical de
fects.
But those alone aren't enough to
overturn Attorney General Deu
kmejian's victory. And Bradley and
his advisers reportedly aren't too keen
on "prolonging the agony."
State Democratic officials and a
I representative of Deukmejian
checked with the Secretary of State's
office yesterday to determine the re
count procedure, to help determine
what success might be expected from
such a move.

Propositions mostly defeated; bonds, freeze pass
Los Angeles — A ferocious, multi-million dollar battle over California's
ballot propositions has ended with the overwhelming defeat of a first-ever
attempt to limit handguns and rejection of the 5-cent deposit "bottle bill."
Proposition 15, the handgun initiative, and Proposition 11, the beverage
container deposit proposal, were leading in polls until the final weeks. But a
last-minute spending blitz by opponents turned the tide.
The non-binding nuclear freeze initiative was approved handily following
a close race. The tally was 3.79 million, or 52.4 percent in favor, to 3.43 mil
lion, or 47.5 percent against.
Still another battle over water ended in the defeat of Proposition 13, an
environmentalist-backed proposal aimed at forcing local water districts to
get state approval for water conservation plans. The measure went down
4.48 million votes to 2.44 million.
Proposition 14, the effort to take reapportionment duties away from the
Legislature and give them to a special commission was defeated 3.6 million
votes to 2.9 million.
Propositions 1 -5, the five bond propositions on the ballot, all passed. They
will raise some $1.5 billion for schools, new jails, environmental planning,
housing and veterans.
But Proposition 9, a little-noticed measure allowing public schools to loan
textbooks to private schools, was defeated soundly.
Three of the four remaining four ballot measures, Propositions 6, 7, and
10, were defeated, while Proposition 8 was narrowly approved.
