## Wilderness Protection Act: prohibiting destruction, or limiting development? 
### KEN BROWN 
Among the unfinished business to be handled
by the Senate when it returns for a lame duck
session after the November elections is the Wil
derness Protection Act, a bipartisan bill passed
by the House of Representatives. This bill pro
. hibits oil and gas leasing in places designated as
Wilderness Areas by the National Forest Ser
vice, and in areas under study for inclusion in
the wilderness system.
The threat of oil and gas leasing in the wil
derness became a major political issue in 1982,
particularly in the intermountain West, where
there is overwhelming, and often vocal, public
opposition to oil and gas leasing in designated
Wilderness Areas. This opposition must com
< bat the well-financed and influential pressure of
* corporations seeking to develop these areas for
oil and gas.
The conflict has its roots in the Wilderness
Act of 1964, which was established to provide
"present and future generations the benefits of
an enduring resource of wilderness." Up to the
present day, the Wilderness Act has designated

With the Arab oil embargo in
1973, the paths of
conservationists and mineral
interests began to cross again.

reserves within the U.S.
Wilderness system began to
look more appealing.

a total of 80 million acres of federal land as wil
derness, with 23.6 million acres of that land
being in the lower 48 states. At the time of the
act's passage, however, one of the political con
cessions granted to the mining industries to
ensure its passage was that "all laws pertaining
to mineral leasing" shall apply to Wilderness
Areas until the end of 1983. This meant that
Wilderness Areas, like any other piece of feder
al land, would be open to mineral leasing and
development until Jan. 1, 1984, with the ap
proval of the appropriate federal agencies. Of
course lease privileges could extend past the
1984 deadline, but no leases in Wilderness
Areas could be granted after the deadline.
In 1964, and for quite a few years following,
there was little interest within the mining in
dustry for exploring the mineral potential of
wilderness lands. The same rugged and remote
qualities which made an area suitable for in
clusion in the Wilderness System also made it
prohibitively expensive for mineral explora
tion, let alone development. For the time being
then, preservationists and mineral interests
took diverging paths.
With the Arab oil embargo in 1973, the paths
of conservationists and mineral interests began
to cross again. High prices for oil and gas sud
denly became higher, and by the late 1970s the
potential reserves within the U.S. Wilderness
system began to look more appealing. Econom
ically at least, the extraction of these resources
was within reach.
Of course mining and oil companies had

done little exploration work in the Wilderness
Areas. By 1979, when a steady stream of ap
plications for mineral leases in Wilderness
Areas began to inundate the Forest Service, 15
years of the 20 year grace period established by
the Wilderness Act of 1964 had vanished. With
little political pressure, the Forest Service con
tinued to plod along, eventually accumulating a
tremendous backlog of lease applications. The
applications which were processed were rou
tinely rejected on the basis that they threatened
special environmental and other resource val
ues.
In October of 1980 the pace and pressure
began to pick up when the Mountain States Le
gal Foundation, at that time headed by the pres
ent Secretary of the Interior James Watt, won a
court case against the Department of Interior
and the Forest Service, forcing them to process
their backlog of lease applications. When Watt
became the Secretary of Interior under Presi
dent Reagan in 1981, the acceleration of the
leasing process in Wilderness Areas seemed like
a foregone conclusion.
When Watt took office in 1981, he an
nounced that he would act on the thousands of
pending lease applications in Wilderness Areas.
Watt's plans for wilderness leasing launched the
Reagan administration into the midst of an ex
plosive and politically expensive nationwide en
vironmental issue.
By the summer of 1982, with the midterm

elections rapidly approaching, candidates who
had once been openly pro-development and
supportive of oil and gas leasing in Wilderness
Areas were looking for a way out of the damag
ing conflict in which they had become en
tangled. The administration had seriously un
derestimated the public opposition to their at
tempts to speed up the leasing process and to in
corporate some type of "release" language
which would prohibit additions to the Wil
derness System. In response to such pressures,
the normally pro-development Manual Lujan
(R-N.M.) joined forces with one ofthe House's
leading preservationists, John Seiberling (D-
Ohio) to introduce a bill in the House of Repre
sentatives which would prohibit all mineral

president could, with the
approval of both houses of
Congress, open Wilderness

leasing in designated Wilderness Areas.
The bill, known officially as the Lujan-
Seiberling Wilderness Protection Act, was

amended in Rep. Morris Udall's (D-Ariz.) In
terior committee to apply the leasing ban to
only "soft-rock" minerals, and was presented
to the House after two strenuous days of mark
up in the committee on July 25. On Aug. 12, the
Wilderness Protection Act passed in the House
of Representatives by an overwhelming margin
of 340-58.

Watt's plans for wilderness
leasing launched the Reagan
administration into the midst of
an explosive and politically
expensive nationwide
environmental issue.

Soon after its passage in the House, a compa
nion version of the House's Wilderness Protec
tion Act was introduced in the Senate by Sen.
Henry Jackson (D-Wash.). Within a matter of
days, the Senate equivalent of the Wilderness
Protection Act was supported by 54 Senators
who signed on as co-sponsors of the bill. The
bill was unable to move through the Senate
before the election recess, and is now left among
the unfinished business for the Senate to com
plete when it returns in November.
In its present form, the Wilderness Protection
Act prohibits any "soft-rock" mineral leasing.
"Soft-rock" minerals include oil, gas, oil shale,
coal, phosphate, potassium, sulfur, gilsonite
and geothermal development. The act does, in
its present form, permit leasing in designated
Wilderness Areas for "hard rock" mining, a
term which includes such minerals as cobalt,
molvbdemun and copper until the 1984 decline.
Concern for the availability of these dwindling
hard-rock minerals had been a stumbling block
for wilderness preservation. The act also con
tains provisions whereby in the event of a "na
tional emergency" the president could, with the
approval of both houses of Congress, open Wil
derness Areas to leasing. While preservation
ist's are not happy with these compromises,
they feel that they are acceptable and necessary
to the act's passage.
Industry, while apparently gaining some
ground, lost quite a bit on other issues. As the
bill now stands there is no "release" language
which prohibits future additions to the Wil
derness System. The act also protects areas
being considered for wilderness designation
from soft-rock mineral leasing and prohibits
seismic blasting in Wilderness Areas, two major
points of concern for the mining and oil in
dustry.
Oil companies are understandably opposed
to the Wilderness Protection Act in its present
form. ARCO and Conoco in particular have re
peatedly attempted to convince Congress and
the public that the disruption of wilderness val
ues by oil and gas exploration has been greatly
overemphasized. H.C. Jameson, the president
of ARCO Exploration Company in Denver, in
his efforts to inform members of Congress in
personal letters of ARCO company opinion,
has stated that if exploration leads to develop
ment it will "minimally disturb only a small
fraction of wilderness land areas for short peri
ods of time."
Another point of contention for the oil in
dustries is their belief that locking up the Wil

derness Areas of the United States will seriously
compromise the nation's ability to regulate its
economic and energy situation. The oil com
panies believe that development of U.S. mineral
reserves in Wilderness Areas is critical to the fis
cal and strategic welfare of the nation.
In countering these claims, preservationists
are quick to point out that only 1.2 percent, or
23.6 million acres, of the lower 48 states is desig
nated wilderness and that only 4 percent of the
lower 48 could ever be included in the Wil
derness System. In contrast, they point out, De
partment of Interior records show that there are
550 million acres of federal land available for
mineral leasing in the United States, while a to
tal of only 100 million acres of that land are cur
rently under lease.
The oil industry's claim that exploration and
development can co-exist with wilderness val
ues is another hotly contested point. Opinion
on the effects of exploration activity and ex
ploratory drilling on wilderness seems to de
pend on one's preference. Those who favor pro
duction argue that the effects of exploration
vanish within a matter of months, while those
who favor preservation feel that the presence of
blasting crews, test drilling rigs and the like ir
reparably damage wilderness values. Impartial
parties often have a hard time deciding. In the
end though, the only opinion which matters is
the legal definition of wilderness.
The problem with leasing and exploration is
that it may ultimately lead to development and
production in an area. While pro-development
forces may feel that the law is sufficiently hazy
to permit exploration activities in Wilderness
Areas, there is no doubt that oil and gas produc-

tion with its attendant support facilities, roads,
power lines and pipelines is grossly incom
patible with any area designated as wilderness.
If the nation is truly committed to preserving
some of its wilderness heritage, preservation
ist's argue, why should we allow the initial steps
which will lead to the destruction of that wil
derness?
There is no small amount of truth in this fear,
as oil and mineral companies well know. Once a
lease has been granted for an area, the Forest
Service can no longer refuse to permit the full
scale development of the area if the lease holder
feels he has located enough oil or gas to warrant
production. After the Forest Service has issued
an exploratory lease for an area it can no longer
prohibit drilling. It can merely direct activities
to minimize the environmental impacts of the
drilling.

ist's argue, why should we allow the initial steps
which will lead to the destruction of that wil
derness?
There is no small amount of truth in this fear,
as oil and mineral companies well know. Once a
lease has been granted for an area, the Forest
Service can no longer refuse to permit the full
scale development of the area if the lease holder
feels he has located enough oil or gas to warrant
production. After the Forest Service has issued
an exploratory lease for an area it can no longer
prohibit drilling. It can merely direct activities
to minimize the environmental impacts of the
drilling.

Among the unfinished business to be handled
by the Senate when it returns for a lame duck
session after the November elections is the Wil
derness Protection Act, a bipartisan bill passed
by the House of Representatives. This bill pro
. hibits oil and gas leasing in places designated as
Wilderness Areas by the National Forest Ser
vice, and in areas under study for inclusion in
the wilderness system.
The threat of oil and gas leasing in the wil
derness became a major political issue in 1982,
particularly in the intermountain West, where
there is overwhelming, and often vocal, public
opposition to oil and gas leasing in designated
Wilderness Areas. This opposition must com
< bat the well-financed and influential pressure of
* corporations seeking to develop these areas for
oil and gas.
The conflict has its roots in the Wilderness
Act of 1964, which was established to provide
"present and future generations the benefits of
an enduring resource of wilderness." Up to the
present day, the Wilderness Act has designated

a total of 80 million acres of federal land as wil
derness, with 23.6 million acres of that land
being in the lower 48 states. At the time of the
act's passage, however, one of the political con
cessions granted to the mining industries to
ensure its passage was that "all laws pertaining
to mineral leasing" shall apply to Wilderness
Areas until the end of 1983. This meant that
Wilderness Areas, like any other piece of feder
al land, would be open to mineral leasing and
development until Jan. 1, 1984, with the ap
proval of the appropriate federal agencies. Of
course lease privileges could extend past the
1984 deadline, but no leases in Wilderness
Areas could be granted after the deadline.
In 1964, and for quite a few years following,
there was little interest within the mining in
dustry for exploring the mineral potential of
wilderness lands. The same rugged and remote
qualities which made an area suitable for in
clusion in the Wilderness System also made it
prohibitively expensive for mineral explora
tion, let alone development. For the time being
then, preservationists and mineral interests
took diverging paths.
With the Arab oil embargo in 1973, the paths
of conservationists and mineral interests began
to cross again. High prices for oil and gas sud
denly became higher, and by the late 1970s the
potential reserves within the U.S. Wilderness
system began to look more appealing. Econom
ically at least, the extraction of these resources
was within reach.
Of course mining and oil companies had

done little exploration work in the Wilderness
Areas. By 1979, when a steady stream of ap
plications for mineral leases in Wilderness
Areas began to inundate the Forest Service, 15
years of the 20 year grace period established by
the Wilderness Act of 1964 had vanished. With
little political pressure, the Forest Service con
tinued to plod along, eventually accumulating a
tremendous backlog of lease applications. The
applications which were processed were rou
tinely rejected on the basis that they threatened
special environmental and other resource val
ues.
In October of 1980 the pace and pressure
began to pick up when the Mountain States Le
gal Foundation, at that time headed by the pres
ent Secretary of the Interior James Watt, won a
court case against the Department of Interior
and the Forest Service, forcing them to process
their backlog of lease applications. When Watt
became the Secretary of Interior under Presi
dent Reagan in 1981, the acceleration of the
leasing process in Wilderness Areas seemed like
a foregone conclusion.
When Watt took office in 1981, he an
nounced that he would act on the thousands of
pending lease applications in Wilderness Areas.
Watt's plans for wilderness leasing launched the
Reagan administration into the midst of an ex
plosive and politically expensive nationwide en
vironmental issue.
By the summer of 1982, with the midterm

elections rapidly approaching, candidates who
had once been openly pro-development and
supportive of oil and gas leasing in Wilderness
Areas were looking for a way out of the damag
ing conflict in which they had become en
tangled. The administration had seriously un
derestimated the public opposition to their at
tempts to speed up the leasing process and to in
corporate some type of "release" language
which would prohibit additions to the Wil
derness System. In response to such pressures,
the normally pro-development Manual Lujan
(R-N.M.) joined forces with one ofthe House's
leading preservationists, John Seiberling (D-
Ohio) to introduce a bill in the House of Repre
sentatives which would prohibit all mineral

leasing in designated Wilderness Areas.
The bill, known officially as the Lujan-
Seiberling Wilderness Protection Act, was

amended in Rep. Morris Udall's (D-Ariz.) In
terior committee to apply the leasing ban to
only "soft-rock" minerals, and was presented
to the House after two strenuous days of mark
up in the committee on July 25. On Aug. 12, the
Wilderness Protection Act passed in the House
of Representatives by an overwhelming margin
of 340-58.

Watt's plans for wilderness
leasing launched the Reagan
administration into the midst of
an explosive and politically
expensive nationwide
environmental issue.

Soon after its passage in the House, a compa
nion version of the House's Wilderness Protec
tion Act was introduced in the Senate by Sen.
Henry Jackson (D-Wash.). Within a matter of
days, the Senate equivalent of the Wilderness
Protection Act was supported by 54 Senators
who signed on as co-sponsors of the bill. The
bill was unable to move through the Senate
before the election recess, and is now left among
the unfinished business for the Senate to com
plete when it returns in November.
In its present form, the Wilderness Protection
Act prohibits any "soft-rock" mineral leasing.
"Soft-rock" minerals include oil, gas, oil shale,
coal, phosphate, potassium, sulfur, gilsonite
and geothermal development. The act does, in
its present form, permit leasing in designated
Wilderness Areas for "hard rock" mining, a
term which includes such minerals as cobalt,
molvbdemun and copper until the 1984 decline.
Concern for the availability of these dwindling
hard-rock minerals had been a stumbling block
for wilderness preservation. The act also con
tains provisions whereby in the event of a "na
tional emergency" the president could, with the
approval of both houses of Congress, open Wil
derness Areas to leasing. While preservation
ist's are not happy with these compromises,
they feel that they are acceptable and necessary
to the act's passage.
Industry, while apparently gaining some
ground, lost quite a bit on other issues. As the
bill now stands there is no "release" language
which prohibits future additions to the Wil
derness System. The act also protects areas
being considered for wilderness designation
from soft-rock mineral leasing and prohibits
seismic blasting in Wilderness Areas, two major
points of concern for the mining and oil in
dustry.
Oil companies are understandably opposed
to the Wilderness Protection Act in its present
form. ARCO and Conoco in particular have re
peatedly attempted to convince Congress and
the public that the disruption of wilderness val
ues by oil and gas exploration has been greatly
overemphasized. H.C. Jameson, the president
of ARCO Exploration Company in Denver, in
his efforts to inform members of Congress in
personal letters of ARCO company opinion,
has stated that if exploration leads to develop
ment it will "minimally disturb only a small
fraction of wilderness land areas for short peri
ods of time."
Another point of contention for the oil in
dustries is their belief that locking up the Wil

derness Areas of the United States will seriously
compromise the nation's ability to regulate its
economic and energy situation. The oil com
panies believe that development of U.S. mineral
reserves in Wilderness Areas is critical to the fis
cal and strategic welfare of the nation.
In countering these claims, preservationists
are quick to point out that only 1.2 percent, or
23.6 million acres, of the lower 48 states is desig
nated wilderness and that only 4 percent of the
lower 48 could ever be included in the Wil
derness System. In contrast, they point out, De
partment of Interior records show that there are
550 million acres of federal land available for
mineral leasing in the United States, while a to
tal of only 100 million acres of that land are cur
rently under lease.
The oil industry's claim that exploration and
development can co-exist with wilderness val
ues is another hotly contested point. Opinion
on the effects of exploration activity and ex
ploratory drilling on wilderness seems to de
pend on one's preference. Those who favor pro
duction argue that the effects of exploration
vanish within a matter of months, while those
who favor preservation feel that the presence of
blasting crews, test drilling rigs and the like ir
reparably damage wilderness values. Impartial
parties often have a hard time deciding. In the
end though, the only opinion which matters is
the legal definition of wilderness.
The problem with leasing and exploration is
that it may ultimately lead to development and
production in an area. While pro-development
forces may feel that the law is sufficiently hazy
to permit exploration activities in Wilderness

If the nation is truly committed to preserving
some of its wilderness heritage, preservation
ist's argue, why should we allow the initial steps
which will lead to the destruction of that wil

There is no small amount of truth in this fear,
as oil and mineral companies well know. Once a
lease has been granted for an area, the Forest
Service can no longer refuse to permit the full
scale development of the area if the lease holder
feels he has located enough oil or gas to warrant
production. After the Forest Service has issued
an exploratory lease for an area it can no longer
prohibit drilling. It can merely direct activities
to minimize the environmental impacts of the
drilling.

Among the unfinished business to be handled
by the Senate when it returns for a lame duck
session after the November elections is the Wil

by the House of Representatives. This bill pro

Wilderness Areas by the National Forest Ser
vice, and in areas under study for inclusion in
the wilderness system.
The threat of oil and gas leasing in the wil
derness became a major political issue in 1982,
particularly in the intermountain West, where
there is overwhelming, and often vocal, public
opposition to oil and gas leasing in designated
Wilderness Areas. This opposition must com
< bat the well-financed and influential pressure of
* corporations seeking to develop these areas for
oil and gas.
The conflict has its roots in the Wilderness
Act of 1964, which was established to provide
"present and future generations the benefits of
an enduring resource of wilderness." Up to the
present day, the Wilderness Act has designated

a total of 80 million acres of federal land as wil
derness, with 23.6 million acres of that land
being in the lower 48 states. At the time of the
act's passage, however, one of the political con
cessions granted to the mining industries to
ensure its passage was that "all laws pertaining
to mineral leasing" shall apply to Wilderness
Areas until the end of 1983. This meant that
Wilderness Areas, like any other piece of feder
al land, would be open to mineral leasing and
development until Jan. 1, 1984, with the ap
proval of the appropriate federal agencies. Of
course lease privileges could extend past the
1984 deadline, but no leases in Wilderness
Areas could be granted after the deadline.
In 1964, and for quite a few years following,
there was little interest within the mining in
dustry for exploring the mineral potential of
wilderness lands. The same rugged and remote
qualities which made an area suitable for in
clusion in the Wilderness System also made it
prohibitively expensive for mineral explora
tion, let alone development. For the time being
then, preservationists and mineral interests
took diverging paths.
With the Arab oil embargo in 1973, the paths
of conservationists and mineral interests began
to cross again. High prices for oil and gas sud
denly became higher, and by the late 1970s the
potential reserves within the U.S. Wilderness
system began to look more appealing. Econom
ically at least, the extraction of these resources
was within reach.
Of course mining and oil companies had

done little exploration work in the Wilderness
Areas. By 1979, when a steady stream of ap
plications for mineral leases in Wilderness
Areas began to inundate the Forest Service, 15
years of the 20 year grace period established by
the Wilderness Act of 1964 had vanished. With
little political pressure, the Forest Service con
tinued to plod along, eventually accumulating a
tremendous backlog of lease applications. The
applications which were processed were rou
tinely rejected on the basis that they threatened
special environmental and other resource val
ues.
In October of 1980 the pace and pressure
began to pick up when the Mountain States Le
gal Foundation, at that time headed by the pres
ent Secretary of the Interior James Watt, won a
court case against the Department of Interior
and the Forest Service, forcing them to process
their backlog of lease applications. When Watt
became the Secretary of Interior under Presi
dent Reagan in 1981, the acceleration of the
leasing process in Wilderness Areas seemed like
a foregone conclusion.
When Watt took office in 1981, he an
nounced that he would act on the thousands of
pending lease applications in Wilderness Areas.
Watt's plans for wilderness leasing launched the
Reagan administration into the midst of an ex
plosive and politically expensive nationwide en
vironmental issue.
By the summer of 1982, with the midterm

elections rapidly approaching, candidates who
had once been openly pro-development and
supportive of oil and gas leasing in Wilderness
Areas were looking for a way out of the damag
ing conflict in which they had become en
tangled. The administration had seriously un
derestimated the public opposition to their at
tempts to speed up the leasing process and to in
corporate some type of "release" language
which would prohibit additions to the Wil
derness System. In response to such pressures,
the normally pro-development Manual Lujan
(R-N.M.) joined forces with one ofthe House's
leading preservationists, John Seiberling (D-
Ohio) to introduce a bill in the House of Repre
sentatives which would prohibit all mineral

leasing in designated Wilderness Areas.
The bill, known officially as the Lujan-
Seiberling Wilderness Protection Act, was

amended in Rep. Morris Udall's (D-Ariz.) In
terior committee to apply the leasing ban to
only "soft-rock" minerals, and was presented
to the House after two strenuous days of mark
up in the committee on July 25. On Aug. 12, the
Wilderness Protection Act passed in the House
of Representatives by an overwhelming margin
of 340-58.

Watt's plans for wilderness
leasing launched the Reagan
administration into the midst of
an explosive and politically
expensive nationwide
environmental issue.

Soon after its passage in the House, a compa
nion version of the House's Wilderness Protec
tion Act was introduced in the Senate by Sen.
Henry Jackson (D-Wash.). Within a matter of
days, the Senate equivalent of the Wilderness
Protection Act was supported by 54 Senators
who signed on as co-sponsors of the bill. The
bill was unable to move through the Senate
before the election recess, and is now left among
the unfinished business for the Senate to com
plete when it returns in November.
In its present form, the Wilderness Protection
Act prohibits any "soft-rock" mineral leasing.
"Soft-rock" minerals include oil, gas, oil shale,
coal, phosphate, potassium, sulfur, gilsonite
and geothermal development. The act does, in
its present form, permit leasing in designated
Wilderness Areas for "hard rock" mining, a
term which includes such minerals as cobalt,
molvbdemun and copper until the 1984 decline.
Concern for the availability of these dwindling
hard-rock minerals had been a stumbling block
for wilderness preservation. The act also con
tains provisions whereby in the event of a "na
tional emergency" the president could, with the
approval of both houses of Congress, open Wil
derness Areas to leasing. While preservation
ist's are not happy with these compromises,
they feel that they are acceptable and necessary
to the act's passage.
Industry, while apparently gaining some
ground, lost quite a bit on other issues. As the
bill now stands there is no "release" language
which prohibits future additions to the Wil
derness System. The act also protects areas
being considered for wilderness designation
from soft-rock mineral leasing and prohibits
seismic blasting in Wilderness Areas, two major
points of concern for the mining and oil in
dustry.
Oil companies are understandably opposed
to the Wilderness Protection Act in its present
form. ARCO and Conoco in particular have re
peatedly attempted to convince Congress and
the public that the disruption of wilderness val
ues by oil and gas exploration has been greatly
overemphasized. H.C. Jameson, the president
of ARCO Exploration Company in Denver, in
his efforts to inform members of Congress in
personal letters of ARCO company opinion,
has stated that if exploration leads to develop
ment it will "minimally disturb only a small
fraction of wilderness land areas for short peri
ods of time."
Another point of contention for the oil in
dustries is their belief that locking up the Wil

derness Areas of the United States will seriously
compromise the nation's ability to regulate its
economic and energy situation. The oil com
panies believe that development of U.S. mineral
reserves in Wilderness Areas is critical to the fis
cal and strategic welfare of the nation.
In countering these claims, preservationists
are quick to point out that only 1.2 percent, or
23.6 million acres, of the lower 48 states is desig
nated wilderness and that only 4 percent of the
lower 48 could ever be included in the Wil
derness System. In contrast, they point out, De
partment of Interior records show that there are
550 million acres of federal land available for
mineral leasing in the United States, while a to
tal of only 100 million acres of that land are cur
rently under lease.
The oil industry's claim that exploration and
development can co-exist with wilderness val
ues is another hotly contested point. Opinion
on the effects of exploration activity and ex
ploratory drilling on wilderness seems to de
pend on one's preference. Those who favor pro
duction argue that the effects of exploration
vanish within a matter of months, while those
who favor preservation feel that the presence of
blasting crews, test drilling rigs and the like ir
reparably damage wilderness values. Impartial
parties often have a hard time deciding. In the
end though, the only opinion which matters is
the legal definition of wilderness.
The problem with leasing and exploration is
that it may ultimately lead to development and
production in an area. While pro-development

ploratory drilling on wilderness seems to de
pend on one's preference. Those who favor pro
duction argue that the effects of exploration
vanish within a matter of months, while those
who favor preservation feel that the presence of
blasting crews, test drilling rigs and the like ir
reparably damage wilderness values. Impartial
parties often have a hard time deciding. In the
end though, the only opinion which matters is
the legal definition of wilderness.
The problem with leasing and exploration is
that it may ultimately lead to development and
production in an area. While pro-development
forces may feel that the law is sufficiently hazy
to permit exploration activities in Wilderness
Areas, there is no doubt that oil and gas produc-

Oil companies are
understandably opposed to the
Wilderness Protection Act in
its present form. ARCO and
Conoco in particular have
repeatedly attempted to
convince Congress and the
public that the disruption of
wilderness values by oil and gas
exploration has been greatly
overemphasized.

power lines and pipelines is grossly incom

If the nation is truly committed to preserving
some of its wilderness heritage, preservation

which will lead to the destruction of that wil

There is no small amount of truth in this fear,
as oil and mineral companies well know. Once a
lease has been granted for an area, the Forest
Service can no longer refuse to permit the full
scale development of the area if the lease holder
feels he has located enough oil or gas to warrant
production. After the Forest Service has issued
an exploratory lease for an area it can no longer
prohibit drilling. It can merely direct activities
to minimize the environmental impacts of the
drilling.
