## The 						Stanford Daily We deserve a recount 
### 
We believe that a recount is required for the
gubernatorial race between Tom Bradley and
George Deukmejian. Out of 7 million votes cast,
only 51,000 votes separate these two contenders.
Out of every set of 140 voting decisions, only one
more voter chose Deukmejian than Bradley. In the
heat of election night ballot-counting there js plenty
of room for error or even, in the spirit of Cook
County, deliberate falsification and sabotage. Giv
en the immense expense and importance of this
contest for a four-year term in Sacramento, we be
lieve that California voters have an absolute right
to know the exact results of this crucial race.
As a rule-of-thumb, politicians demand and ex
pect a recount when the pronounced victory's plu
rality is less than one percent. The Bradley-Deu
kmejian slugfest certainly fulfills this requirement
with a span of only 0.7 percent between the two po
litical combatants. The old-timer's rule-of-thumb
should definitely be applied in this case.

On a subtler note, we are perplexed by the glaring
discrepancy between the Democratic candidates'
exit polls and the final results. In the history of their
use, exit polls have proven to be highly reliable in
struments when administered by expert teams of
social scientists and statisticians. Not only do we re
spect the interpretive skill of the Democratic teams,
but we must also acknowledge the superior track
records of Field and Teischner, California pollsters
who both predicted a Bradley victory on the basis
of their exit polls. Race ar.d "Brown phobia" have
been factors in this election. The 7 percent gap be
tween scientifically based expectations and "reali
ty" is far too yawning to be ignored.
With an illegal budget deficit looming, decisions
emanating from the new governor's office will af
fect the direction of state funding priorities for the
remainder of the 1980s. When the stakes are so
large, we deserve more than four years of doubt and
suspicion. We deserve a recount.
