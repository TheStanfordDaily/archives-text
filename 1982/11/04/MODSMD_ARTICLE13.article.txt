One of our editorial board members remembers
the school-sponsored air raid drills, the panic
stricken rushes on the supermarkets and the chill of
death in the air during the Cuban Missile Crisis of
the autumn of 1962.
Two decades have passed since this traumatic
childhood incident, but scholars, government of
ficials and laymen still debate the lessons to be de
rived from this nation's weeks spent on the brink of
the Apocalypse; this is what President John Ken
nedy called the "abyss of destruction." The con
troversy centers around the confrontational poli
cies of the United States in a nuclear age, both the
motivations and the consequences of American be
havior.
The hard-line philosophy is best represented by
political analyst George Will. Will believes that our
vacillation in the Cuban Missile Crisis is the cause
of many of our problems in Latin America today.
To get the Soviet missiles out of our backyard, Ken
nedy offered Premier Nikita Khrushchev a quid
pro quo: the United States would agree not to in
vade Cuba and topple the Castro regime if the Sovi
et Union would remove its offensive missiles from
the island. Will believes that we "chickened-out" in
this game of chicken; through the promise of no in
vasion, America gained nothing and inadvertently
rewarded aggression. The Bear was caught with his
paw in a Caribbean honey jar, and we weakly per
mitted him to lick his larcenous pickpocket's fin
gers and skulk away without any punishment.
Northwestern University professor Gary Wills
advocates a diametrically opposite perspective.
Wills believes that we provoked an unnecessary
crisis and confrontation with the Soviet Union, a
near-catastrophe spurred by Kennedy's obsessive
imprisonment in a macho personal ethic and ex
cessive psycho-sexual appetites. Wills warns that
American presidents who feel the compulsive need
to prove their virility and demonstrate their man
hood in the Oval Office may instead serve as the
libidinous catalysts for the incineration of the
planet.
Rather than celebrating the memory of the
Cuban Missile Crisis, we believe that the American
people should heed its lessons concerning the dan
gers of brinksmanship. The events of two decades
ago are best characterized by the dynamic interplay
between confrontational brinksmanship and diplo
matic restraint, between prudent caution and pure
luck.
A war-hardened generation held power in 1962,
both in Washington and Moscow. Each super
power accepted the realpolitik assumptions of the
Cold War, but respected the code of mutual re
straint. The world was a far different place because
it had been untempered by the harsh disillusion

ments of dissenting NATO and Warsaw Pact allies.
It was our team against their team. In the show
down over the armed projectiles, located only 90
miles from our shores, we had the U.N. behind us,
the OAS and NATO entirely on our side. West Ger
man "Greens" did not challenge our motives, Ven
ezuela had not yet founded OPEC and Argentina
did not find a Falklands-inspired "Anglo con
spiracy" under every bed. The Third World was not
a concept. American prestige and conventional mil
itary superiority were unchallenged by any other
power.
Kennedy kept the nuclear genies in the bottle be
cause of the superiority of our conventional forces,
the strength of our international diplomatic sup
port, and J.F.K.'s penchant for giving the Soviets
every possible face-saving "out" from the October
situation. In the late president's eyes, survival was
its own reward and more important than any
artificial breast-beating over "victory."
Change over the intervening years has not
worked to our advantage. Worse yet, outside of
strategic nuclear arms, the present administration
refuses to acknowledge that any change has taken
place. The Reaganauts are frozen into an early-'6os
mentality, without the saving graces of restraint,
wisdom and (indeed, upon occasion) rationality.
With or without a confirming nod from the White
House, shifting force formulas and diplomatic
equations have altered America's position in the
world. Not only is our prestige in tatters, we are
also one of the world's favorite scapegoats. We can
not count on rational behavior and restraint among
present leaders in either capital. The precarious sit
uation may further deteriorate with the emergence
of either a New Right American president or an ag
gressively expansionistic post-Brezhnev collective
leadership in the Kremlin. The rising generation of
leaders has not yet learned restraint from the rav
ages of World War 11, and we cannot afford to
educate them at our expense.
Then-Secretary of State Dean Rusk summarized
the Cuban Missile Crisis with the following graphic
statement: "We were eyeball to eyeball, and I think
the other fellow just blinked." Did anybody really
blink? Does it really matter? When the issue of ex
tinction is on the table, the stakes for blinking are
naturally high. We are delighted that somebody
flashed his eyelashes, or none of us would be here
today.
We were fortunate during our last stumble-drunk
waltz around the nuclear minefield. We may not be
so lucky the next time we dance with destiny at the
abyss, especially if we seek our light-footed political
comforts in the enfolding and smothering arms of
the war-loving Valkyries.
