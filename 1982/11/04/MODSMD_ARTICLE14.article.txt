## Confusion: from Jane Fonda to' Urgent Treatment' 
### 
OK, OK, I'll confess: I really don't understand
anything anymore. Oh, I used to — or at least I
thought I did — but I know now I'm really just ter
ribly confused.
I don't know why I'm confused — and don't real
ly have any excuse, I don't think. Here I am, major
ing in International Relations at one of the finest
universities in the country, and I should have de
veloped at least the rudiments of a careful analytical
ability by now; I have experience in second-culture
learning which should help me understand a variety
of perspectives; and I'm still young and should be
able to keep an open mind long enough to under
stand at least some things.
Unfortunately not: I'm still confused. All the
models of foreign policy behavior I've seen won't ex
plain how the United States can both boycott a wide
range of technical exports to the Soviet Union while
concluding a huge boycott-proof grain sale to that
same nation. After all, if boycotts are effective, you
keep your options open by not selling boycott-proof
grain, and if they're not effective, you don't boycott
high-tech equipment. Right?
Or how do you explain how a U.S.-supplied
cluster bomb (for "defensive" purposes only) kills
an American in Beirut? No, no, that question's too 1
easy — how do you explain the fact that the United
States still supplies Israel with the things? To kill our
soldiers?
But, OK, I'll admit that the Mideast is a special
case — illogic is its major product. We'll move a bit
closer to home, then: if we assume that there will
always be a few crazy people around we can explain
the so-called Tylenol murders. But what of all the
"copycat" poisonings? No motives, no publicity
seeking, just a form of homicidal vandalism. Why?
Or for that matter, can you explain any kind of
vandalism?

Not all societies are as crime-ridden as ours, of
course — Austria is a case in point. Crime is more
or-less nonexistent in Austria. Seeds for my con
fusion, however, are not: for example, no one in the
• entire country will admit to ever having voted for
Bruno Kreiskv, Austria's prime minister since 1969.
Nevertheless, he will probably be (once again!) re
elected next year, by an even more impressive
margin than last time. How?
Kreisky's not alone, of course — here in this
country, across both the world and political spec
trum from Kreisky, we have President Reagan —
the guy whose policies the average man on the street
professes to be against, but who remains "person
ally popular." Similarly, Adolf Hitler was an "ex
cellent orator" — but that's not a good reason to
vote for him, just as I wouldn't vote for Tom
Havden just because I happen to think that Jane
Fonda's a good actress.
• Speaking of Jane Fonda, what about her "work
out book?" Or any other bestseller? Non-fiction
bestsellers are all diets, exercise plans or Carl Sagan
picture books that look nice on a coffee table; fiction
bestsellers are generally better, but still usually just a
stop above a Harlequin romance with a historical
setting (usually World War II). Obviously, some
body buys these books — but why?
And while we're on mass culture, prime-time tele
vision and The National Enquirer (largest U.S. news
paper circulation) so defy my comprehension that I
will only mention them in passing.
The University, too, intellectual though it may be,
confuses me: ever wander through the back rooms
of the Old Union bureaucracy and wonder why ev
eryone just quotes you "Stanford Policy" and says,

"I'm sorry that's beyond my control?" And why
don't the student employees there know how their
department works?
Similarly, why do the "Urgent Treatment" people
at Cowell make you fill out forms before they treat
your "urgent" problem? Why doesn't somebody
turn the heat on in University housing when it's ob
viously cold outside? Who painted my window
open?
Why don't the backpack checkers at Green Li
brary check to see if any of those books in your pack
are library books? Why do people get so much more
upset about a football players' strike than about the
sale of unhealthy baby formulas to the Third World?
How representative is the House of Representatives
if you have to be wealthy to afford the campaign?
Why do such senseless, obnoxious people like Valley
Giris exist?
Why is the only movie I've seen in a while that
made sense "Pink Floyd: the Wall?" Why isn't Stan
ford's "Humor Magazine" funny? Is Leonid
Brezhnev ever going to die? Really? Why does Uni
versity construction work go from 7 a.m. to 3 p.m.
instead of from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.? (I sleep until 9
a.m..) Why do normally sensible countries like
Norway, Sweden and Denmark still have kings?
How on earth can anyone have believed that the
E.R.A. would have led to co-ed public restrooms?
Why doesn't a "residential university" like Stan
ford have enough residences? What sort of people
join the Ku Klux Klan and why? Have you, any
members of your family or any of your friends ever
been called as part of a "nationwide telephone sur
vey?"
Why are there always ties for the Nobel Prize?
