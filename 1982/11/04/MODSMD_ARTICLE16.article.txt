## Life beyond the football games 
### 
What a weekend the last one was.
The Stanford football team gave ev
eryone a great thrill with its upset win
over Washington. The holiday season
and cool fall weather took firm control.
Halloween parties ignited the campus
with students laughing at each other's
costumes and couples dancing late into
the night; excitement and joy again pre
vailed.
Down south, amid the glittering
lights of Los Angeles, the Who concert
created emotions in 100,000 individuals
that some may never feel again. And on
Sunset Boulevard, chills ran through an
ambitious young man as he sat in a fine
restaurant, eating gourmet pizza and
gazing out at a sea of intoxicating build
ings and signs.
What great feelings, what a great
time.
These are the things that make us
happy; these are the moments that we
feel joy. Each moment was electric, and
each moment was ugly. Most im
portantly, each could be felt by a few.
None is universal: therefore, all may
very well be inferior. However, they
could be all we have.
More than 50,000 people cheered
wildly during the heroics of John Elway
and Vincent White; billions of people
have never heard of them; billions have
never heard of Stanford, and millions
have never heard of football. So, it was
an intense joy felt last Saturday by some
students and alumni in one small corner
of the world. It might have even made
my day. Meanwhile, a Long Beach
State student lies paralyzed for seven
weeks now since an opening day neck
injury against UCLA. How isolated,
our joy. How insignificant.
At another football stadium, around
6:30 the night before, four guys and
some instruments turned thousands of
disparate individuals into one powerful
and joyous whole. The Who have
reached millions of people around the
world in the last two decades. For some
the hours at the concert were the ex
perience of a lifetime. Their realities
could not compare with the two magic
hours of hero worship and passion.
The atmosphere was amazing in the
oval structure; the lights, the sounds,
the figure of Townsend with his guitar,
Daltrv with his microphone. One
ceased to think ... of the ugly scenes
earlier in the day, of seven-year-old kids
drunk and sick, of bodies lying to the

left and right of the mass humanity
waiting in line, of reasonable human
beings throwing glass bottes at others in
line, of people becoming nothing more
than cattle and of the stadium turning
into an armed camp.
One may remember what one
chooses: the beautiful, clapping, cheer
ing, unified whole or the human waste
and ugliness of the hours and years
before. A young man had to remember
that the sounds of"Baba O'Riley" and
"Behind Blue Eyes" which he felt to be
wondrous and inspirational, are just
loud, irritating noises to his parents.
What drives some to joy and en
lightenment cannot even touch most.
The instinctual, animalistic power of
the Who, which makes young masses
feel at home, can be compared to the re
fined, elevated taste of Spago, a new,
chic restaurant on Sunset Boulevard,
one night later. Warren Beatty and
Diane Keaton are regulars at Spago;
politicians, musicians, all the best and
beautiful people enjoy the sensations of
the exclusive restaurant. They feel a
joyous energy in the special at
mosphere, cherishing the exquisitely
prepared food, the sauces and salad
dressings, the puff pastries and delicate
appetizers. Their blood rushes as they
look out at the city — the city they are
conquering, the city that gives them all
the power and success they desire.
John DeLorean may have been
thinking about Spago, or something
similar, as he sat enjoying a private
table and a private room in the Termi
nal Island penitentiary. He might have
been pondering the many moments of
incredible joy that wealth brought him.
It sounded so good; it could make any
of us happy. He was released from pris
on last Friday and retreated into seclu
sion as the rest of us began enjoying
such a grand weekend.
And just two blocks down the street
from Spago the prime territory for Hol
lywood's prostitutes begins. Three or
four stand together, not worrying too
much about happiness, looking to
maki the money that will bring them
the joy of going to a fine restaurant.
This whole article is irrelevant in their
lives.
The restaurant stands as the most
fleeting and insignificant of all the
pleasures so far discussed; still, all the
"best" people, industrial "fat cats" and
crusading activists for social justice all

look forward to their next dinner in
Beverly Hills.
What about the more general feelings
of joy — the familial warmth of the
holiday season, the excitement and hu
man interaction of holiday parties, the
simple joys beginning with Halloween,
continuing with Thanksgiving and
Christmas. These foundations for hap
piness assuredly have more substance.
People are at the root of these pleasures
and almost everyone can relate to the
feelings of joy meaningful human rela
tionships can bring.
Still, the outside world can intrude on
even the simplest of pleasures, remind
ing us even in our moments of genuine,
heart-felt happiness that we live in a
troubled, even diseased society. The
traditions of Halloween came to a
screeching halt this year, as more than
40 cities banned trick or treating alto
gether and every community ds
- the tradition out of fear («g>r
the safety of children.
In the midst of personal happineip,
whether it be on the surface pleasurelef
an exciting weekend or the true joy u£a
special relationship, whether we are for
getting our troubles at a concert or a£a
Halloween party, we are forced to Re
member that our society has creatediift
dividuals who will poison a capsuld^f
Tylenol or inject cyanide into a can<|y
bar. £
None of us has time to fully under
stand the causes; we take time to shiver
in horror, then return to our simple
pleasures. Some of us who can never
completely let go will think of the dis
ease again as it interferes with a fine din
ner, a great show or an exciting footbili
game. But we will cling to our simple
pleasures, also, and they will give tys
great joy.
If they are all we have, our lives mpy
be very empty. But as we search for uni
versal, for true happiness, they certam-
Iv can give us a big lift. »"
As my thoughts wane, the joys of the
last weekend slip into the past; concerns
of the world await this moment. By the
time these words are read election re
sults will be known and the concerns
will be fading as the joys of another
weekend approach.
