Stock market reaches new high
The stock market surged to a historic high yesterday with a record ad
vance that touched off jubilation, and a touch of awe, on Wall Street.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, the long-standing indicator that
represents "the market" to most Americans, skyrocketed 43.41 points to
1,065.49.
That eclipsed the previous record gain of 38.81 points set on Aug. 17, aiid
carried it past a peak that had stood as a financial Everest for almost a dec
ade.
On Jan. 11, 1973, the average closed at 1,051.70. Dozens of times since
then, the Dow had risen into the low 1000s, but each time had turned back in
an economy plagued by inflation, periodic bouts of high interest rates, and
most recently a severe recession.
Several other broader, but lesser-known market indexes also hit all-time
highs in what Edward Yardeni, economist at Prudential-Bache Securities,
callcd "an incredibly impressive performance."
"It's something no one would have believed tnree months ago," said
Charles Jensen, an analyst at MKI Securities. "There's a feeling of real, real
optimism."
Prices were rising steadily near the close in hectic trading, evoking expec
tations of more fireworks when the markets reopen this morning.
Yesterday's volume on the New York Stock Exchange totaled 137.01 mil
lion shares, the fifth largest total in exchange history.
Since Aug. 12, the Dow Jones industrial have now risen more than 288
points in what many analysts have read as a portent of better times ahead,
perhaps beginning early next year, for the economy.
Marines to expand patrol duties in Lebanon
Washington — The United States and Italy yesterday moved toward
changing the character and size of the multinational force trying to keep the
peace in Lebanon.
U.S. Marines are to start patrolling the Beirut-to-Damascus Highway,
probably today, and part of their job is to check persons who might be
Palestine Liberation Organization combatants trying to return to Lebanon
from Syria.
Officials acknowledged that sniper fire and land
mines along the highway make this a new and
riskier mission for the 1200 Marines who, during
this second deployment, have been confined to the
relative safety of the Beirut airport.
But, officials added, the Lebanese government
sought the additional Marine presence to help sta
bilize the country. The officials added that it will be
touch-and-go during intitial patrolling on limited
stretches of the highway and said only experience
will determine whether the Marine contingent can
handle the extra duty without being increased.
The future of the force and withdrawal of Israeli
and Syrian troops from Lebanon are expected to
be main topics in a meeting between Reagan and
Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin at the
White House Nov. 19. In announcing the meeting
yesterday, the White House said Begin will be in
the United States on a private visit.
The tactical plan, subject of last-minute snags
between the U.S. military chain of command and
special envoy Morris Draper over procedures, calls
for patrols of jeeps carrying three Marines armed
with M-16 rifles and wearing flak jackets. A Leba
nese translator would go along on every patrol.
Besides checking suspicious looking traffic,
sources said, the Marines will search for and re
move mines along the vital roadway.
As of last night, the plan was to send out the first
Marine patrol today. A State Department official,
resorting to a euphemism for the Marines' new and
dangerous mission, said their job will be "to
monitor traffic."

Gunmen seize consulate
Cologne, West Germany — Gunmen who seized
the Turkish consulate in Cologne surrendered to
police early this morning. All hostages in the build
ing were released, police said. No other details
were immediately available.
Terrorists claiming to be Marxists opposed to
Turkey's military rule took over the Turkish Con
sulate in a storm of gunfire yesterday, seizing an
undetermined number of hostages.
About 55 of the 80 captives the attackers claimed
to be holding were released. Forty of them were re
leased an hour after the takeover, and the rest in
separate stages as telephone negotiations with po
lice and Turkish officials wore on into the night.
Details of the talks were not disclosed.
At one point early in the siege, a terrorist held a
woman hostage at a window, aimed a gun at her
head, and shouted through a megaphone for police
to pull back.
Throughout the day, gunfire was heard from the
building but there were no indication that any of
the released hostages reported the captives were
being harmed.
Police said five people were injured by flying
glass during the assault, which was launched by an
unknown number of attackers at midmorning. But
police said that as far as they knew, there were no
gunshot wounds.

West reschedules Polish debt
Bonn, West Germany — Shaken by the inability
of several nations to pay their foreign debt this
year, Western banks yesterday signed an agree
ment with Poland rescheduling most of its 1982
debt.
The agreement, covering a total $3.4 billion in
commercial principal and interest owed by Poland
this year, was more lenient than the first reschedul
ing arrangement concluded with Poland last year.
It also included a new provision that the banks
would recycle about half of Poland's interest
payments in the form of new trade credits.
This seemed to reflect Western bankers' recogni
tion of Poland's worsened financial predicament as
well as their eagerness to recover at least some of
their money from the troubled communist state.
Breaking precedent, the banks decided this year
to negotiate an accord with Warsaw authorities
before Western governments — also heavily in
vested in Poland — have even begun talks on an
official 1982 debt due of nearly $6 billion. Banks
last year waited for the governments to reschedule,
but this vear Western governments froze the talks
in retaliation for the imposition of martial law in
December of last year.
Under the terms of the accord, 95 percent of the
$2.3 billion dollars of principal will be repaid over
3 1-2 years after a four-year grace period.
Like the 1981 agreement, which allowed Poland
to roll over $2.4 billion in bank debt, the new deal
sets interest on the deferred principal at 1.75 per
cent above the floating London interbank lending
rate — the cost of obtaining funds in London mon
ey markets — plus a 1 percent rescheduling fee. Po
land is obligated to pay the remaining 5 percent of
principal before the end of this year.

West nears pipeline agreement
Washington — Italian Prime Minister Giovanni
Spadolini said vesterdav after talks with President
Reagan that the United States has proposed a new
Western policy on strategic trade with the Soviet
Union and that a "solution" to the divisive
Siberian gas pipeline question "is very near.'
The proposals, which reportedly were discussed
informallv by some European ambassadors yester
day, are to be outlined at the State Department to
day in the fourth meeting in a week and a half of
high-ranking U.S., European, Canadian and
Japanese diplomats on the issue.
A State Department official closely involved in
the talks said yesterday it is now "60-40 that an
agreement can be reached."
The more optimistic tone of yesterday's com
ments ran sharply counter to suggestions from
both sides of the Atlantic earlier in the week that
there seemed to be a lack of political will in Wash
ington and in the European capitals to reach an
agreement.
"The Western world must find and define a com
mon approach based on a greater strictness of an
economic nature in its relations with the Eastern
world." Spadolini said after he met with Reagan
for an hour and a half yesterday.
He said the the approach must be "based on and
inspired by" four points, going further than any of
ficial has yet done to outline in public the proposed
agreement that has been under discussion for a
month:
"First, no undue gift to the Soviet Union as far
as credits are concerned. Second, greater strictness
in the transfer of technologies to the Soviet Union.
Third, implementation of a security net within the
Western system so as to reduce the dependence on
the Soviet Union concerning raw materials and
energy products. Fourth, the contracts that al
ready have been signed by European countries
concerning the pipeline must be honored so as not
to pre-judge the credibility as far as the trade of the
Western world is concerned."

U.S. for Falklands resolution
United Nations — The American decision to
support an Argentine resolution calling for nego
tiation on the Falkland Islands was made at a Cab
inet meeting on Monday, despite a personal appeal
from British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher to
President Reagan that the United States abstain,
American officials said yesterday.
The conciliatory gesture toward Argentina —
which also constituted a rare public split with Brit
ain — came less than a month before the presi
dent's fence-mending visit to three Latin American
countries — Brazil, Colombia and Costa Rica.
In London, Foreign Minister Francis Pym
called in the American ambassador yesterday to
express British dissatisfaction with the American
decision on the resolution, which is to be voted on
bv the General Assembly today or tomorrow.
British officials at the United Nations admitted
that London was "dismayed and angry" over the
move, and expressed concern that the American
announcement would erode support by other na
tions for the British position against the resolution.
Already, Western diplomats said, three of Brit
ain's nine partners in the European Community —
France, Ireland and Italy — have indicated their
intention to vote for the text put forward by Argen
tina and 19 other Latin American nations.
Thus far in the assembly debate, only New Zea
land has fully backed the British stance against the
resolution and against a resumption of nego
tiations with Argentina on sovereignty over the is
lands.
Assembly resolutions are not legally binding on
governments, and British Ambassador Sir John
Thomson has already served warning that the
adoption of this one would "not alter the policy of
the (British) government."
He said Britain opposed any U.N. resolution,
and argued that if it entered talks on the basis of the
present text, the outcome would be prejudged in
Argentina's favor.

Salvadoran army, rebels clash
Usulutan, El Salvador — The army of El
Salvador and rebel bands fought sharp, bloody
skirmishes this week amid coastal farmlands in
what could be a crucial struggle to get this nation's
cotton crop to market.
Instead of accepting a guerrilla challenge to fight
over three war-battered little towns in the north,
the army is struggling to keep the roads open in El
Salvador's farming heartland in the southeast. A
crack battalion of almost 1000 men has been as
signed here to protect farmers who will start har
vesting the cotton crop this month..
Cotton is the country's No. 3 cash crop (after
coffee and sugar cane) and a major source of hard
currency. El Salvador's economy, has been badly
wakened by almost three years' civil war and the
guerrillas are trying to halt the harvest as part of
their economic war against the government.
Moving in small bands, they slip down from

hideouts on the slopes of the region's forested,
cloud-shrouded volcanoes to burn vehicles on the
main roads, or to hide in the fields and machine
gun crop dusting planes. Three of of the planes
have been shot down in a month.
The U.S. trained Atonal Battalion, meanwhile,
is sending out patrols to trv to surprise the rebel
bands, staggering them with superior firepower in
brief encounters before the guerrillas can escape
back into the hills. Other troops guard key bridges
in a coastal plain cut bv numerous rivers.
"We're trying to force them down toward the
coast," said Maj. Napoleon Hernandez, an officer
of the Atonal, "to give the people here a little faith,
a little securitv, so thev can bring the cotton crop
in."
Soviets criticize election
Moscow — The Soviet media yesterday night de
scribed the outcome of the U.S. elections as a "vote
of no confidence in the entire political program of
the Reagan administration."
But despite the tone of satisfaction in which they
announced a "serious defeat" of President Rea
gan, the Soviets seem to have found little comfort
in the results.
According to well-informed political sources,
the Democrats' gains were not substantial enough,
from a Soviet point of view, to cripple the adminis
tration for the next two years. According to these
preliminary readings. Moscow is unlikely to expect
that the president will be forced to change his anti-
Soviet policy.
In turn, the election results are not expected to
have significant impact on a current reappraisal of
Soviet foreign policy.
In a speech to the Soviet armed forces chiefs last
week, President Leonid Brezhnev clearly indicated
that a policy shift is planned, including a new wave
of weapons modernization to counter the Ameri
can arms buildup.
In a commentary on the elections, the govern
ment newspaper Izvestia skirted around issues of
foreign policy and arms control and merely em
phasized that even incomplete results had made it
clear that "the overwhelming majority of Ameri
can voters" favored a freeze on nuclear production
and deployment.
Izvestia said the outcome showed a "discontent
of the broad sections of the population" with Rea
gan's policies. It quoted Soviet observers as being
unanimous in the view that only a failure of the
Democrats to provide an effective "alternative"
economic policy prevented a larger Republican de
feat.

Chicago mayoral race starts
Chicago — Just as the rest of the nation began a
respite from politicians, campaign commercials
and rhetoric yesterday, the "real" political season
opened here.
The race for mayor of Chicago, an office Illinois
Democrats consider the most powerful in the state,
is on, Chicago residents have to suffer through
almost four more months of political activity, and
some think this time it promises to be the most in
tense seen here in the last 50 years.
Chicago is probably the only city in the nation
where sb much attention is paid to the race for
mayor, with the months of campaigning for na
tional and statewide offices serving merely as the
preliminaries before the main event.
So far there is only one candidate, Mayor Jane
Byrne, who has already about $3 million in cam
paign funds. But her political nemesis, Richard
Daley, son of the late Chicago Mayor Richard
Daley, is expected to declare his candidacy Thurs
day.

Gov't report: fallout not harmful
Salt Lake City — Study by study, the federal
government is building its case that years of above
ground atomic weapons tests in Nevada were car
ried out without harming those who lived in the lit
tle rural communities caught in the radioactive
fallout of the towering mushroom clouds.
The studies, which cost $6 million, support what
the government has said ever since testing — and
complaints of illness resulting from it — began in
the 19505: Not nearly enough fallout fell on the res
idents of Utah, Nevada and Arizona to cause the
leukemia and other cancers that some persons at
tribute to the fallout.
The government's case has been unfolding in a
federal District Court here, where Judge Bruce
Jenkins is hearing the first 24 of 1192 damage
claims against the government. The claims seek
millions of dollars in damages and allege that gov
ernment negligence caused about 300 individuals
to contract leukemia and other cancers as a result
of exposure to radioactive fallout.

Today's weather
Mostly sunny and mild today, with a few high
