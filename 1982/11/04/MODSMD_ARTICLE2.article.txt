Stock market reaches new high
The stock market surged to a historic high yesterday with a record ad
vance that touched off jubilation, and a touch of awe, on Wall Street.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, the long-standing indicator that
represents "the market" to most Americans, skyrocketed 43.41 points to
1,065.49.
That eclipsed the previous record gain of 38.81 points set on Aug. 17, aiid
carried it past a peak that had stood as a financial Everest for almost a dec
ade.
On Jan. 11, 1973, the average closed at 1,051.70. Dozens of times since
then, the Dow had risen into the low 1000s, but each time had turned back in
an economy plagued by inflation, periodic bouts of high interest rates, and
most recently a severe recession.
Several other broader, but lesser-known market indexes also hit all-time
highs in what Edward Yardeni, economist at Prudential-Bache Securities,
callcd "an incredibly impressive performance."
"It's something no one would have believed tnree months ago," said
Charles Jensen, an analyst at MKI Securities. "There's a feeling of real, real
optimism."
Prices were rising steadily near the close in hectic trading, evoking expec
tations of more fireworks when the markets reopen this morning.
Yesterday's volume on the New York Stock Exchange totaled 137.01 mil
lion shares, the fifth largest total in exchange history.
Since Aug. 12, the Dow Jones industrial have now risen more than 288
points in what many analysts have read as a portent of better times ahead,
perhaps beginning early next year, for the economy.
Marines to expand patrol duties in Lebanon
Washington â€” The United States and Italy yesterday moved toward
changing the character and size of the multinational force trying to keep the
peace in Lebanon.
U.S. Marines are to start patrolling the Beirut-to-Damascus Highway,
probably today, and part of their job is to check persons who might be
Palestine Liberation Organization combatants trying to return to Lebanon
from Syria.
