## Out on their own, but with some excess baggage Bobby McFerrin: too good for his own good 
### MARK BUCKO 
Bobby McFerrin
Great American Music Hall
Sunday, October 24
Some try to compare him to Al
Jarreau, but he doesn't have the
fluidity. Others liken him to
George Benson, but he's not
nearly as smooth. He is black and
he sings jazz, but there the com
parison ends.
Bobby McFerrin, who appears
monthly at the Great American
Music Hall in San Francisco, is
an innovator, one of the most ex

citing jazz vocalists to come
along in years. He's an up-and
comer as thev sav — a new
album, sold out shows in the city
and raves from peers and critics
alike.
McFerrin's October shows at
the Music Hall created much ex
citement after his dynamic sets in
September, but despite numer
ous highlights, they proved to be
uneven affairs. McFerrin, giving
the fans their money's worth,
performed for nearlv three-and
a-half hours with his three-piece
band, yet failed to maintain the
level of excitement generated by
his best material.
McFerrin's strung-out ar
rangements and poor pacing
took away from the manv magic
moments when the audience felt
like participants rather than ob
servers. McFerrin is a top rate
performer when he's hot and
mesmerized the sold-out crowd
with his amazing range and con
trol. But on the other hand, too
much mesmerizing, too much
scatting and too much im
provisation can prove too heavy
for the attention span.
McFerrin uses his voice in a
very unique manner — more as
the fourth instrument in an ex
cellent road band than as the vo
calist in a jazz combo. He focuses
on relatively traditional jazz ma
terial combined with his own
compositions and a few adapted
pop tunes such as Van Mor
rison's "Moondance" and John
Hall's "Dance With Me." What

isn't traditional is his unique
squeaking, squawking and slid
ing up and down the scales.
McFerrin imitates numerous in
struments while singing, often
jumping from one to another and
often a capella. Much to the au
dience's delight, he even cocks his
hands as if playing an imaginary
flute.
McFerrin runs into trouble
when stretching this unique tal
ent a little too far. Similarly his
backing crew. Simplv too manv
tunes featured a vocal solo, fol
lowed by a piano solo, followed
by a bass solo, a drum solo, a vo
cal solo and so on. McFerrin
needs to mix up theelements a bit
more, including his deep Gil
Scott-Heron-like voice and his
contrasting improvisation abili
ties.
On the other hand, McFerrin's
combo demonstrated fine in
terplay amongst themselves and
piano player Paul Nagel soloed
They in themselves
created a sideshow of sorts, be
cause of McFerrin's unselfish
willingness to step aside and let
them go.
The evening's highlights came
from McFerrin's more familiar
material such as "Feline," an
easy pop ballad, and "You've
Really Got a Hold On Me," with
the audience singing Phoebe
Snow's part, who duets with
McFerrin on his debut LP.
McFerrin also drew on older jazz
material from the likes of
Thelonius Monk and Winton

Marcellus, resulting in a hit-or
niiss spontaneity, but never
theless demonstrating his ad
mirable adaptability.

Too much
mesmerizing, too
much scatting and too
much improvisation
can prove too heavy
for the attention span.

McFerrin's LP offers much of
the same. He touches on so many
different aspects of jazz and pop,
but none are really satisfactorily
developed. Half of the album's
tunes are non-originals, most of
which account for the pop flavor
of side one. McKerrin leads off
with a skattv version of John
Hall's "Dance With Me" wrap
ping his thick, low voice around
sessionman Victor Keldman's
dancing piano. He rounds out the
side with a dynamite version of
Smokev Robinson's "You've
Really Got A Hold On Me",
(sung with Phoebe Snow, whose
career could use a boost), Van
Morrison's "Moondance" and
two original tunes of which the
ballad "Keline" would be the
most likely single. McKerrin
slides into his vocals here with the
best of the balladeers and throws
in some improvisation (for lack
of a better word) that defies ex
planation.

More of the same for "Moon
dance" which would be the
album's best, except for McFer
rin's "Sightless Bird,' a soaring
ballad of laving down Fife's
burdens that unfolds from a
.i in pie two-chord progression to
i sailing trademark McKerrin
mprovisation. It's the kind of
long that makes him an in
novator rather than just another
competent voice.
McKerrin runs into trouble
with some of his more unusual
material. "All Feets Can Dance"
is a clever dittv with multiple
voicing, vet it gets tiresome after
the novelty wears off. Likewise,
"Hallucinations" and
"Chicken" weigh too heavily on
the pacing established on side
two with "Bird," "Peace," a
smooth crooner by Horace Sil
ver, and "Juvillee." McFerrin
simply has too many styles and
ideas to fit onto one piece of
vinyl.
(
A heavyweight collection! of
studio session men were gathered
for the LP including Feldrrian,
Larry Klein on bass and veteran
John Guerin on drums.
Feldman's work on the Fertder
Khodes is especially outstanding.
In all, despite inconsistencies,
Bobby McFerrin is as strong a de
but as any. The bright moments
are worth it, the weak ones for
givable. 1 anxiously await album
number two.
