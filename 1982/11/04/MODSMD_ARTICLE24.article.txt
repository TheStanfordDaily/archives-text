# Donald Fagen: did Steely Dan really break up? Well, maybe...

Donald Fagen
Nightflv
Warner Bros. Records
First, let's clear up some con
fusion hiding behind the names.
Donald Fagen's new solo album
can be thought of for all intents
and purposes as the new Steely
Dan album. The only "official"
members of the band since
Countdown To Ecstasy have been
Fagen and sometimes bassist
Walter Becker. Though Becker
doesn't play at all on this album,
it would be misleading to think of
Nightfly as Fagen's "going out
on his own." Fagen does all the
writing, singing and arranging;
he plays most of the keyboards
and synthesizers and, presum
ably, selects each of the dozens of
impeccable studio musicians.
This album's assemblage is pretty
similar to 1980s Gaucho, though
by virtue of greater numbers they
give a lusher sound.

The major development is that
Fagen's music on Sightfly is his
most thematically coherent and
satirical album. The songs repre
sent fantasies entertained by peo
ple such as Fagen as a youth in
the late '50s and early '60s, and
they portray a naively optimistic
caricature of establishment prop
aganda. His characters ap
preciate how much better life has
been getting, and promise it will
keep getting better. "What a
beautiful world this will be/What

a glorious time to be free" prom
ises the opening track, "I.G.Y.
(International Geophysical
Year)." Technology, of course,
gets inevitably better: "The
future looks bright/On that train
all graphite and glitter/Undersea
by rail/Ninety minutes from
New York to Paris/Well by sev
enty-six we'll be AOK."
Not only does civilization get
better, but adult life promises the
fulfillment of the dreams of
youth. In "Maxine" Fagen's per
sona bids his girlfriend "We've
got to hold out till graduation . . .

" then: "We'll move up to Man
hattan/And fill the place with
friends/Drive to the coast and
drive right back again/One day
we'll wake up and make love but
till then/Try to hang on Max
ine."
Waiting through the un
avoidable delay of gratification
seems to be life's biggest frustra
tion. In "New Frontier" Fagen
looks eagerly forward to the
great life decisions upcoming,
leading surely to his self-ac
tualization: "Well 1 can't wait till
I move to the city/Till I finally
make up my mind/To learn de

sign and study overseas."
Also in "New Frontier" Fagen
captures '50s nuclear-family
naivete bv recalling the old
bomb-shelter facade of security:
"Yes we're gonna have a wind
ging/A summer smoker under
ground/It's just a dugout that my
dad built/In case the reds decide
to push the button down/We've
got provisions and lots of
beer/The key word is survival on
the new frontier."
Fagen's phraseology is, clear
ly, as clever and intricate as it's
always been and the vocals have
the usual relaxed, jazzy ex
pression. His occasional
cynicism * disappears into
boundless innocence. Musically,
Nighlfly's lush pure layers con
vey the same tunnel-visioned op
timism. Hordes of studio musi
cians add one smooth, upbeat
touch each. In this respect, Night
fly is unartistically close to 1980s
Gaucho. But then, the rest of new
jazz and jazz-fusion hasn't been
advancing Very fast either.
All in all, Nightfly is a good
album, though far from ex
perimental. The "successful ar
tist's new album rule" holds firm:
if you liked the other Steely Dan
albums, you'll like this one, too.
If you're not i"to Steely Dan yet,
you don't need this album to keep
abreast of 1982's pop innova
tions, but with the exception of
1978's brillian Aja this is as good
a place to discover Steely Dan as
anv.
