# BILLY JOEL faces Bill Martin—and finds maturity

Bill Martin is dead, and the
man who killed him does not
mourn.
After hiding behind that image
for most of his career, on The
Nylon Curtain Billy Joel has
dropped Martin as an alter ego,
and is starting to write songs that
spring from his soul— quite a dif
ference from the lounge lizard
Martin represented.
This isn't a career move. I'm
sure Bill Martin, piano man,
would last a lot longer in the big
but-shallow pond of pop
stardom than will Billy Joel, bit
ter divorcee. Joel does not have a
choice. He can no longer even
pretend to be Martin.
Since the release of Songs in the
Attic Joel has faced major crises
in his life. In a perverse, freakish
way, his sources of pride seemed
to have turned against him. Billy
Joel, the Long Island motorcycle
tough of "You May be Right,"
nearly crippled his hand in a cycle

accident, and the romantic
dreamer of "Just the Way You
Are" is now divorced.
Sad to sav, these tragedies have
brought maturity to his music.
The Nylon Curtain cannot be dis
missed as fluff. Some of it is mis
guided or perhaps insensitive,
but none of it is tainted by the fa
cile rhyming or inflexible view
points that brought so much
critical ire.
The real introduction to the
album is the opening song on
Side Two, "She's Right On
Time." This song connects the
album to the rest of Joel's career
by making a bridge between the
wide-eved romantic and the old
and wounded man of the rest of
the album.
The song starts quietly, sub
dued. Off a few chords Joel runs a
short, questioning melody, which
is swallowed by the bombast of
drum and bass. "Turn on all the
Christmas lights," he urges.
"Turn the choral music higher,
pile more wood upon the fire,
that should make the atmosphere
complete." His woman is coming

home, and he wants the at
mosphere to be right for her wel
come.
She's right on time, he says,
and she's always known how to
do things right. He's "a man with
so much tension, far too many
sins to mention — She don't have
to take it anymore." Despite
whatever he did wrong, she's
coming hack, and — damn the
cost — he wants her. "Left to my
own device, I can always make
believe that there's nothing
wrong. Still I will choose to live in
the complicated world that we
shared for so long — Good or
bad, right or wrong."
Joel's singing testifies to his
faith. He believes she will soon
return, and he almost hears her
footsteps in the street. However,
as the song ends he is still piling
wood on the fire and swearing
that she's choosing the "perfect
moment"- but she doesn't arrive.
That poignant moment is fol
lowed by "A Room of Our
Own," a bitter rave-up about the
differences that become so acute
through time. He sings of the

need to get away at tunes, to have
a room of your ovsn to heal in.
The tone of the song belies this
equanimity, though, as Joel spits
the words out, alternately bitter
and mocking.
Contrasting the needs or wants
of this embattled couple Joel runs
from a rather horrific suicide ref
erence — "You've got pills and
I've got razor blades" — to the
mundane — "You ve got yoga,
honey, and I've got beer"— to
the crass — "You've got love,
darlin', I've got sex ' — to the vi
tal — "You've got vour room,
honey, and I've got mine."
"It's alright," he shouts, but
it's obvious that it isn't. Still, he
recognizes the fact that some
times differences can be so great
that even people who care about
each other can be t'orccd apart.
After singing of love, rejection,
and being toyed with, Joel has
only now started to realize that
sometimes there isn't a villain in
heartbreak.
"Surprises," the third and final
song of his divorce trilogy, shows
most strongly the Beatles in
fluence on the alburn. The song
almost seems a condemnation;
the theme is that there should be
no surprise to the hreak-up, and
it seems to be sung to the other
person, but within the lyrics there
are lines which he has to be
addressing to himself.
"I'd be lying if I told you I had
no regrets," he says, but then he
turns the song inward. Joel be
rates himself for being so wide
eyed, and rises to a highly Len
nonesque falsetto on "but it
shouldn't surprise vou at all."
His father left his family when
Joel was young, and later in the
song he sings "What has it cost
you? What have you won? The
sins of the fathers are the sins of
the sons — It was always within
you, it will always continue, but it
shouldn't surprise vou at all."
Aside from that triptych, the
rest of the album is divided into
roughly equal parts of interest
ing-but-uncomniercial and
catchy-but-flawed songs. The ra
dioplav songs are mostly the lat
ter, including "Allentown" and
"Pressure."

Reaganomics makes its first
appearance in pop music in "Al
lentown," a song about the new
industrial ghost towns. The songs
opens with the sound of a train,
and Joel chants "sis-boom-bah"
over the effect. This is odd, as one
would think that the noise is sup
posed to represent a steel factory
rather than a train.
Over an oddly bouncing,
almost mockingly bright, beat,
he sings about settling down in
Allentown and how "every child
had a pretty good shot to get at
least as far as his old man got" —
until the depression hit. The
dream goes wrong — "They nev
er taught us what was real: Iron
and coke, chromium steel"—
and the hope dies: "Well, it's
hard to keep a good man down,
but I won't be getting up today."
"Allentown" gets very close to
mocking its subject, but "Pres
sure" comes right out and mocks
itself. Released as a single before
the album, it made some people
wonder if Joel was going the Lin
da-Ronstadt-noveau-punk
scene. Over a driving bass line he
invokes all the cliches of pres
sure: loaded guns, two outs and
the bases loaded, and un
answerable questions.

After singing of love,
rejection, and being
toyed with, Joel has
only now started to
realize that
sometimes there isn't
a villain in
heartbreak.

Nothing is really said in the
song, and after he sings "All your
life is channel 13, Sesame Street,
what does it mean?" he drops
into conversational voice to say
"I'll tell you what it means."
What does it mean? "Pressure!"
Two other songs are most
memorable for the heavy Beatles
influence, namely "Scandinavian
Skies" and "Laura." The former
is a weird, Sgt. Pepper-type or-
