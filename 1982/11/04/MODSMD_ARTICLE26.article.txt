# BILLY JOEL THE NYLON CURTAIN
## 
### 
ehestra piece centered on a trip to
Holland, which is well textured
and fun to listen to, despite its in
comprehensibility.
"Laura" is about some
pathologically dependent friend,
who demands more and more
support, paying him back with
affection he feels guiltv for not re
turning. He's tied up by his best
intentions, responding to her ev
ery whim. "Here I am, feeling
like a fucking fool. Do I react the
way exactly she intends me to?"
At the end of the song Joel hits
the guts of the problem, in per
haps the best insight he hras yet
shown: "Laura loves me, even if I
don't care — that's niv prob
lem. . . .She always says I'm the
best friend that she's ever had.
How do you hang up on someone
who needs you like that?" De
spite jarringly sillv "Ooh, oohs"
and an overextended vocal, Joel
sings this song with sinceritv,
making his plight believable; in
short, making it his.
The last two songs on each side
show two aspects of the new
maturity in Joel's music. One,
"Goodnight Saigon." shows that
maturity is reallv a growth proc
ess, and there can be painful
stops along the way.
The song is all high passion, a
tale of chaos in the Vietnam War.
The marines — brothers on
Parris Island — pray and cower
in the trenches, rule the day but
live in fear of the night, and lose
track of wrong and right; but
who is Billv Joel to tell us this?
The song is, to a degree, over
produced, and it just doesn't
wash for Billv Joel to sing of the
horror of Vietnam — in his last
serious song, "Captain Jack," he
sang about seeing his friends die

from drugs and uselessness, a
horror he had a right to describe.
Nor does it sound right for the
male chorus to boom out "And
we said we'd all go down togeth
er" at the end of the verses. In a
song bracketed with motor
noises and sung in a frail voice,
the power and assurance of the
chorus does not work, even as
irony.
The final song, "Where's the
Orchestra," is an odd touch of
metaphor. Plangentlv, Joel sings
of confusion, sitting in the au
dience for his life and mistakenly
expecting a musical instead of a
drama. It's a song of resignation,
even despair, but the bitterness is
gone. It's all over, he seems to
say, and there's nothing to do but
learn a lesson and go on.
In interviews, Billv Joel says
that this album deals with accept
ing defeat and facing up to cir
cumstances. That maturity is evi
dent on the album — although
the music may have been shaped
more by the limiting injury to his
hands than a conscious desire to
move away from lush pianos —
and ii has imparted a different,
more concrete value to almost all
of the songs here.
Still, that's not an unrestrained
approval. Billv Joel, or Bill
Martin, had a gift to write songs
that were wistful, romantic, but
not embarrassing. There was
nothing for anyone to be
ashamed about in liking his mu
sic, and now that there is less in
nocence to it it would be un
fortunate if that maturity were to
eliminate forever the beauty or
joy that Billv Joel's music once
had.
