A 12-ton steel radiation shield ac
cidentally fell al the Stanford High
Energy Research Laboratory i uesday.
earning an estimated $ 100.000 of phyji

The accident resulted in no injuries.
The shield — which is about eight in
ches thick, seven feet wide and 20 feet

principal investigator in the project.
Pantell said the exact cause of the ac
cident has not been confirmed. Failure
Analysis Associates has been asked to
determine the cause.
