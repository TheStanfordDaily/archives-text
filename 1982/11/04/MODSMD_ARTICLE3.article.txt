Increased transportation problems
and damage to San Francisquito Creek
were the most emotional concerns
raised last night in a public hearing on
the proposed Stanford West housing.
The hearing, required by federal law,
was the principal public review of the
more than 450-page draft of the En

planners currently indicate that the
project will house 2800 to 3800 faculty
members and graduate students in 1400

Nearly 100 area residents present in
the City Council chambers in Palo Alto
criticized the report's failure to address

citizen of Palo Alto. "If the develop

in automobile traffic would reach an
unacceptable level." Blumenthal said
the increased traffic would add to safety
problems and lead to higher pollution
levels.
Residents also cited the failure of the
report to provide adequate provisions
for bicycle lanes, storage facilities and
protection from theft. This failure is
seen as contradictory to the report's as
sumption that most residents will use
bicycles to travel between the Univer
sity and Stanford West.
Citizens expressed dismay over the
proposed extension of Willow Road,
claiming it would threaten the
ecological balance, increase traffic and
invite further development in the area.
"I am violently opposed to this
project", said Linda Ettinger, a resident
of Menlo Park. "We were told at first
that Willow Road would have nothing
to do with the Stanford West project,
and suddenly it's back in question." She
