# Negative reaction voiced in hearing on Stanford West housing project
## 
### STEVE KAUFMAN Staff Writer 
Increased transportation problems
and damage to San Francisquito Creek
were the most emotional concerns
raised last night in a public hearing on
the proposed Stanford West housing.
The hearing, required by federal law,
was the principal public review of the
more than 450-page draft of the En
vironmental Impact Report (EIR) pre
pared for the project. Stanford West
planners currently indicate that the
project will house 2800 to 3800 faculty
members and graduate students in 1400
to 1600 units.
Nearly 100 area residents present in
the City Council chambers in Palo Alto
criticized the report's failure to address
many important issues. Of these, in
creased traffic congestion was a chief
concern.
"The Stanford West project would
pose an insurmountable traffic prob
lem," commented David Blumenthal, a
citizen of Palo Alto. "If the develop
ment is allowed, the resulting increase

in automobile traffic would reach an
unacceptable level." Blumenthal said
the increased traffic would add to safety
problems and lead to higher pollution
levels.
Residents also cited the failure of the
report to provide adequate provisions
for bicycle lanes, storage facilities and
protection from theft. This failure is
seen as contradictory to the report's as
sumption that most residents will use
bicycles to travel between the Univer
sity and Stanford West.
Citizens expressed dismay over the
proposed extension of Willow Road,
claiming it would threaten the
ecological balance, increase traffic and
invite further development in the area.
"I am violently opposed to this
project", said Linda Ettinger, a resident
of Menlo Park. "We were told at first
that Willow Road would have nothing
to do with the Stanford West project,
and suddenly it's back in question." She
fears that Willow Road might develop
into a major expressway and believes
there is a need for compromise.
Citizens also expressed concern over
the possible effects of the project on San
Francisquito Creek. The erratic behav
ior of the creek, its unstable slopes and
its natural beauty were all cited as rea
son not to go ahead with the project.
Area residents fear the addition of a
high population density project to their
neighborhood, viewing it as an invasion
of their peace and privacy. They claim
that the area will be overpopulated and

that the inconvenience of
seven-year construction,
