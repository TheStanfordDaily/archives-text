# Research volume falls short of Univ. expectations
## 
### MIKE HALE Senior staff writer 
Stagnant federal research funding,
the chief culprit in a projected $3 mil
lion University budget shortfall for
1982-83, could lead to "a change in the
fundamental nature of the University"
warns Gerald Lieberman, dean of grad
uate studies and research.
Lieberman told the Daily yesterday
that the volume of federally sponsored
research performed at Stanford will be
'•virtually the same" this w<UwU voar
as it was in 1981-82. Seen against infla
tion, this represents a loss in volume for
the University. This flattening trend
was first seen in 1981-82, Lieberman
said.
Albert Hastorf, vice president and
provost, has predicted that research
volume for 1982-83 will fall $6 million
short of projections, meaning that
about $3 million less in indirect cost re
imbursements than expected will be
paid into the University's general fund.
Asked whether the drop in research
could have been predicted. Lieberman
said, "there was not really any way of

anticipating this problem any faster
than we've seen it." He said the "first
inkling" of the problem appeared last
spring, and that the University has been
watching it since.
Lieberman said that for now the de
cline will have an impact strictly on the
general University budget, in terms of
lower indirect cost recovery payments.
He warned, however, that if the prob
lem continued departments might find
themselves unable to provide sufficient
~ #JCm cVr support for their graduate stu
dents.
He said he had not yet seen any evi
dence of graduate students being hurt,
and that the number of graduate stu
dents in the University was up slightly
this year.
Departments that find themselves in
trouble because of lack of research
growth will be helped "over the short
run" by the University, Lieberman
said, with the hope that the department
involved could "turn it around."
He said last year the University put
"one-time money" into departments
that might have been hurt by severe fed

eral cutbacks. "We wanted to give them
the opportunity to react to the cuts and
turn it around." He cited civil engineer
ing as a department that suffered se
verely from cutbacks last year, specifi
cally in the Environmental Protection
Agency.
The Economics and Psychology De
partments, which have the largest social
science research volumes here, have
been especially hard hit by the sag in re
search. Psychology Prof. J. Merrill
Carlsmith, director of the Boy» Town
Center, said the slowdown in psy
chology research reflected the Reagan
administration's "general approach of
downplaying mental health research."
Economics Prof. David Starrett, de
partment vice-chairman, said, "gener
ally people in Washington are looking
for a quicker return on their investment
. .. people aren't willing to wait any
more." He said that while this affects
the University as a whole, the social sci
ences suffer because other disciplines
are seen as being "closer to the produc
tion process."
Starrett said the research slowdown

did have a direct effect on the depart
ment, in that the money available for
hiring visiting faculty decreases, forcing
the department faculty to take on a
heavier teaching load.
He said that while there could be
"cumulating problems" for faculty mo
rale if the situation worsens, he feels
"we'll be able to turn it around."
Lieberman said the drop in volume in
these departments had been expected
by the University. It doesn't make a
large difference in the total research
volume, he said, because the absolute
volume in the social studies is small.
Prof. Robert White, chairman of the
Electrical Engineering Department,
suggested at a Faculty Senate meeting
last week that faculty incentives for
higher research volumes should be in
creased. "I can think of none now," he
said, adding, "There's an enormous
category of disincentives."
Lieberman disagreed, saying faculty
members who are interested in pursuing
research have their incentive "built in."
Starrett said, "Economics Department
people really want to get the grants,
even though the University doesn't
make it as attractive as they possibly
could."
According to Lieberman, major re
search universities across the country
are experiencing the same difficulties as
Stanford. "Their projections are no bet
ter than our own," he said.
Lieberman feels the real lesson to be
learned from the present difficulties is

"that we're very depend
whims of the federal govern
changes in policies makebi
in our budget."
He warned, "Wealllil«!
it is today," adding that all
the University will be affect
rent situation is not revet
cutbacks "are inevitable,"
He. concluded that the
largely that of predicting!
research growth
"There's no way to i
projections ... Once in
come in high. If vou ahl
high, you're a lousy estii
sav that as a statistician.''
