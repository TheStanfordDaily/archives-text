# Repairs to halt Twain, Dormer roof leaks
## 
### SANDRA BODOVITZ Staff writer 
Rooms in Twain and Donner Halls have been se
riously leaking for more than a year, according to
Twain residents. The necessary major repairs finally
started Nov. 2 after rugs, furniture and personal
belongings had been ruined.
According to Robert Mibach, the facilities man
ager of the residence halls, the problem was brought
to his attention in the winter of last year. After in
vestigating the problem , officials determined that
the entire roof needed replacing. The projected cost
of the project is $85,000 according to Mibach.
"The workd was scheduled to start in September.
In August, due to some possible strike signals, it was
determined that the project should be delayed,"
Mibach said. He predicted that 80 percent of the
work would have been completed before the stu
dents returned to campus if the strike had not oc
curred.
The work was not scheduled to begin last spring
because Stern hosts many conferences and receives
the spillover from the "Branner Hotel" during

spring, Mibach said.
The funding for the project had to be ap
propriated from the Housing Capital Reserves
Fund. Mibach said his request for funds was han
dled promptly and that, "while it didn't look like
anything was going on a lot was going on behind the
scenes."
Twain residents did think that nothing was being
done to alleviate the problem. According to one
Twain resident who also lived in Twain last year,
"we basically got the run-around last year. Ev
eryone meant to do it, but it wasn't high on their list
of priorities."
Chris Tigno, a resident assistant at Twain, said
that during freshman orientation they discovered
leaks and reported them to Vicki Baker at the Stern
Office. Nothing was done, according to Tigno, until
the second big storm when more residents registered
complaints. "We were then told that they would
start fixing it bv Nov. 8," Tigno said. The starting
date was subsequently moved to Nov. 2.
Five rooms in Twain North and two rooms in

Twain East have major leaks. Renee Tenzel, a resi
dent of Twain North, said her ceiling was leaking
and her carpet was mildewed when she moved into
her room at the end of September.
"The people who had the room last year had the
room leaking all year and residential management
did nothing," Tenzel said. When it rains, a gallon of
water an hour comes through her ceiling, Tenzel
said. The water is not clear but is high in alkali con
tent and has discolored clothing and carpets.
Tenzel talked to Peter Harvey, office supervisor
of housing management, and Mibach at the Resi
dential Management Office. Tenzel said that both
Harvey and Mibach seemed personally concerned
but the only thing that was done was taping plastic
over the leak.
Mibach said he will be happy to talk to students
about refinishing furniture and cleaning rugs that
have been damaged by water stains. "We certainly
are here to help students and we don't want to incon
venience anvone," Mibach said.
