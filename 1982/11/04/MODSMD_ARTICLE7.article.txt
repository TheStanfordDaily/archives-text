### SANDRA BODOVITZ Staff writer 
Israel's moral responsibility for the
Beirut massacres cannot be denied, but
responsibility does not imply guilt,
Hirsh Goodman, a correspondent for
the Jerusalem Post, told a capacity
crowd in Kresge Auditorium last night.
"I've been there physically. So there
was shooting, so there was firing, but
between that and knowing there was a
massacre is a big, big difference,"
Goodman said. Goodman is a military
correspondent and strategic analyst for
the Post. He is also a consultant for
CBS news and was one of the first Is
raeli reporters to visit Egypt.
Goodman said he does not believe
that Israeli officials knew that the
massacre was taking place. He ex
pressed full confidence in the Council of
Inquiry to determine what happened.
The media coverage of the massacres

added to the confusion, according to
Goodman. "The media coverage of
Lebanon has made it almost impossible
to understand what happened in Leba
non," Goodman added.
Israel's initial invasion of Lebanon
was justified according to Goodman.
He said that Israeli officials had found
"document after document pointing to
hostile intentions" on the part of the
PLO. The journalist added that "At

necessary."
Goodman said a definite disparity ex

led by Prime Minister Begin, and De

Goodman praised Sharon as a strategic
genius.

America," Goodman said. "In order to
be effective in the Middle East they
(American officials) need to pre-posi
tion (have allies in the area to support
military operations)" and Israel is the
only nation in the Mideast that will help
them to do so, Goodman added.
In terms of the war's effect on Israel,
Goodman said that in all the years he
has lived in Israel he has never seen it so
divided. He views the anti-war demon
strations in Israel as both a sign of
strength and of weakness. Goodman
said that the demonstrations showed Is
rael's commitment to democracy as
well as airing the moral concerns of the
people.
