## Arms buildup: stumbling blocks to mutual disarmament U.S., Soviets balk; tension flares 
### 
( ompiltd from news reports and wire services
Soviet-American arms control nego
tiations in Geneva may be approaching a
"deadlock" because of calculated U.S. at
tempts to block any progress in the talks, ac
cording to a ranking Soviet military leader.
Col. Gen. Nikolai Chervov, who is head of
the general staff department on strategic
weapons and a member of the inner leader
ship of the armed forces, in a statement Tues
day, accused the Reagan administration of
deliberately seeking to create an impression
that some progress was being made at the two
sets of negotiations held in Geneva.
The military leader's comment was the
most direct official statement on the progress
of the superpower talks on curbing medium
range nuclear weapons in Europe and reduc
ing strategic armaments. The statement
seemed to echo the harsher tone adopted by
Soviet President Leonid Brezhnev in recent
weeks. In two of his latest speeches dealing
with foreign policy, Brezhnev ignored men
tioning the Geneva negotiations.
But Chervov appeared to go beyond pre
vious official pronouncements by asserting
that the Reagan administration has put for
ward proposals "that they knew in advance
cannot be accepted by the Soviet side."
Chervov indicated that by refusing to alter its
views in medium-range and strategic weap
ons talks, the United States is "essentially re
fusing to search for mutually acceptable solu
tions."

The general said that the administration
was deliberately trying to convince European
allies that some progress was being made at
Geneva and that it was doing so in an effort to
secure deployment next year of new U.S. me
dium-range nuclear weapons in Western Eu
rope.
"In reality, the United States keeps the ne
gotiations running idle as it demands con
cession from the Soviet Union," he said. Not
ing that any talks are a "two way street,"
Chervov warned, "If the United States stand
does not develop in a constructive direction,
then naturally the Soviet Union will have no
grounds to develop its stand. As a result, the
negotiations will be deadlocked."
Meanwhile the United States has leveled
charges that it is the Soviet Union and its in
creasingly militaristic policy that has threat
ened a breakdown in talks.
Seizing upon a recent speech given by
Brezhnev which called for an increase in Sovi
et arms as proof, Defense Secretary Caspar
Weinberger last week argued that more al
locations for the military are needed in the
face of a Soviet arms buildup. Weinberger
also voiced disapproval of nuclear freeze pro
posals. "We think the truth is that a nuclear
freeze will weaken the deterrent forces that we
have to relv on to prevent war."
Turning to current domestic efforts at an
arms freeze, Weinberger maintained that a
nuclear freeze would increase the danger of
war and "would make it far more difficult to

negotiate anything like a substantive nuclear
arms reduction with the Soviet Union." Dur
ing a Washington conference he argued that
under a freeze the Soviet Union would retain
new missile forces while the United States
would he prevented from modernizing.
The defense secretary also accused the So
viet Union of undertaking military prepara
tions at "an unprecedented level" while one
government expert said the expected Soviet
budget for next year would reflect a rise in the
military sector. Current Soviet military
spending figures, which have been steady in
recent years at slightly over 17 billion rubles
(some $25 billion), are viewed as only a sym
bolic amount rather than a true reflection of
Soviet military expenditure.
Brezhnev's 20-minute speech last Friday
before 500 military leaders was strikingly de
fensive and added fuel to Weinberger's
charges of stepped-up Soviet arms. The aging
leader spoke harshly of Reagan's adminis
tration, accusing it of pushing the world "into
the flames of nuclear war."
One Soviet official said the speech in
dicated a dangerous development because it
indicated the exhaustion of Soviet leader
ship's patience with the United States' stance.
Another said that though Brezhnev still
hoped the United States might abandon a
policy of confrontation for cooperation, the
Kremlin was not ruling out the possibility of
policy leading the world back into a cold war.

Brezhnev's 20-minute speech last Friday
before 500 military leaders was strikingly de
fensive and added fuel to Weinberger's
charges of stepped-up Soviet arms. The aging
leader spoke harshly of Reagan's adminis
tration, accusing it of pushing the world "into
the flames of nuclear war."
One Soviet official said the speech in
dicated a dangerous development because it
indicated the exhaustion of Soviet leader
ship's patience with the United States' stance.
Another said that though Brezhnev still
hoped the United States might abandon a
policy of confrontation for cooperation, the
Kremlin was not ruling out the possibility of
policy leading the world back into a cold war.

( ompiltd from news reports and wire services
Soviet-American arms control nego
tiations in Geneva may be approaching a
"deadlock" because of calculated U.S. at
tempts to block any progress in the talks, ac
cording to a ranking Soviet military leader.
Col. Gen. Nikolai Chervov, who is head of
the general staff department on strategic
weapons and a member of the inner leader
ship of the armed forces, in a statement Tues
day, accused the Reagan administration of
deliberately seeking to create an impression
that some progress was being made at the two
sets of negotiations held in Geneva.
The military leader's comment was the
most direct official statement on the progress
of the superpower talks on curbing medium
range nuclear weapons in Europe and reduc
ing strategic armaments. The statement
seemed to echo the harsher tone adopted by
Soviet President Leonid Brezhnev in recent
weeks. In two of his latest speeches dealing
with foreign policy, Brezhnev ignored men
tioning the Geneva negotiations.
But Chervov appeared to go beyond pre
vious official pronouncements by asserting
that the Reagan administration has put for
ward proposals "that they knew in advance
cannot be accepted by the Soviet side."
Chervov indicated that by refusing to alter its
views in medium-range and strategic weap
ons talks, the United States is "essentially re
fusing to search for mutually acceptable solu
tions."

The general said that the administration
was deliberately trying to convince European
allies that some progress was being made at
Geneva and that it was doing so in an effort to
secure deployment next year of new U.S. me
dium-range nuclear weapons in Western Eu
rope.
"In reality, the United States keeps the ne
gotiations running idle as it demands con
cession from the Soviet Union," he said. Not
ing that any talks are a "two way street,"
Chervov warned, "If the United States stand
does not develop in a constructive direction,
then naturally the Soviet Union will have no
grounds to develop its stand. As a result, the
negotiations will be deadlocked."
Meanwhile the United States has leveled
charges that it is the Soviet Union and its in
creasingly militaristic policy that has threat
ened a breakdown in talks.
Seizing upon a recent speech given by
Brezhnev which called for an increase in Sovi
et arms as proof, Defense Secretary Caspar
Weinberger last week argued that more al
locations for the military are needed in the
face of a Soviet arms buildup. Weinberger
also voiced disapproval of nuclear freeze pro
posals. "We think the truth is that a nuclear
freeze will weaken the deterrent forces that we
have to relv on to prevent war."
Turning to current domestic efforts at an
arms freeze, Weinberger maintained that a
nuclear freeze would increase the danger of
war and "would make it far more difficult to

negotiate anything like a substantive nuclear
arms reduction with the Soviet Union." Dur
ing a Washington conference he argued that
under a freeze the Soviet Union would retain
new missile forces while the United States
would he prevented from modernizing.
The defense secretary also accused the So
viet Union of undertaking military prepara
tions at "an unprecedented level" while one
government expert said the expected Soviet
budget for next year would reflect a rise in the
military sector. Current Soviet military
spending figures, which have been steady in
recent years at slightly over 17 billion rubles
(some $25 billion), are viewed as only a sym
bolic amount rather than a true reflection of
Soviet military expenditure.
Brezhnev's 20-minute speech last Friday
before 500 military leaders was strikingly de
fensive and added fuel to Weinberger's
charges of stepped-up Soviet arms. The aging

tration, accusing it of pushing the world "into
