# Arms policy debate on quality vs. quantity continues
## 
### 
Compiled from news reports and wire
services
Whether the United States
should have a military whose
strength is based on numbers
or quality is being sharply de
bated by defense planners. It
is a question which could af
fect the organization and the
look of the U.S. military in
years to come.
The Reagan administration
plans to spend $1500 billion
on the Defense Department in
the next five years and defense
planners are caught in a de
bate over whether to continue
putting money into high-tech
nology weapons or to shift
toward a policy of procuring

less technologically sophisti
cated weapons in greater
numbers.
Critics of the Pentagon
such as Senator Gary Hart of
Colorado say that the armed
forces may find themselves
with a technologically superi
or arsenal that is greatly out
numbered, giving the United
States a disadvantage on the
battlefield.
These critics have pointed
out that the high cost of com
plex weapons like the M-l
tank and large aircraft car
riers forces the military to put
its eggs in fewer baskets.
The problem is highlighted
bv the fact that even with the

great amounts of money the
Reagan administration plans
to spend, the number of weap
ons available will only slightly

It doesn *t do just because the Soviets have
100 airplanes for me to build 100 inferior
airplanes. / can *t justfix the quantity
problem without matching it with quality.

increase.
For instance, in the 1970s
spending on tactical air power
increased at an average rate of
10.4 percent a year, while the
number of fighters and attack
aircraft actually declined.

The main reason for this is
obsolescence and increasing
costs. The Navy said this year
that it was losing fighter and

attack aircraft to age and at
trition faster than it was ob
taining new ones.
In the early 1950s the Unit
ed States cbuld produce about
6000 tanks yt\6 6000 planes a
year. By the 1980s these fig

ures were closer to 600.
The Navy, which had 888
active-duty ships in 1965, now
has 490. Air Force active-duty
aircraft totaled 12,689 in
1964, but only 7194 this year.
The Soviet Union, on the
other hand, is said to be pro
ducing about 1300 fighters a
year. The U.S. military
budget calls for 180 fighters
for the Air Force for next
year.
Pentagon policy advocates
like Liet. Gen. John Chain,
the Air Force deputy chief of
staff, do not dispute that there
is a numbers problem. But
they claim that technological

superiority is more important.
Chain argues, "It doesn't
do just because the Soviets
have 100 airplanes for me to
build 100 inferior airplanes. I
can't just fix the quantity
problem without matching it
with quality."
Meanwhile, Pentagon of
ficials have notified Congress
that they expect the nuclear

weapons modernization pro
gram will build so many new
warheads that the military
will run out of special bomb
grade materials by the end of
the decade.
They say there is danger
this may happen unless three
nuclear reactors responsible
for producing highly purified
bomb-grade plutonium and
tritium undergo extensive
modernization.
