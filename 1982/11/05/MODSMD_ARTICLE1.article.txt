# Branner, University clash over cost of sidewalk 'art'
## 
### LISA LYNCH 
The new pavement in front of Bran
ner Hall may not seem any different
from the average sidewalk. But thanks
to Branner residents who engraved
their names in the wet cement, students
and the Residential Management Of
fice are battling over the right of cement
carvers to practice their art and the re
sponsibilities of students who damage
University property.
The concrete was poured several days
ago to salvage a bicycle parking area
that frequently became muddy during
rainstorms. A guard was kept by the ce
ment while it was being poured until 8
p.m., when he was replaced by a resi
dent assistant, who kept watch until 1
a.m. Wheji the area was left unguarded,
students went outside and carved their
names in the U'lfriost-dry compete, along
with slogans such as "Swingles'" and
"Okie Lives."
When the graffiti was discovered, the
management office declared that the
students had damaged the concrete and
that it would have to be replaced, at a
cost of $1100. They said that unless in
dividual students paid for the damage,
the money would have to come from
Branner dues.
An "intent to bill" notice has been
served on Branner Hall and notices are
being delivered to individuals whose
names appear in the cement. Both
freshmen and the RAs are outraged by

the University's position.
"No way is this damage," said Dave
Lempert, a Branner RA. "Damage is
something that structurally impairs the
property." Lempert claims the Univer
sity's position is ridiculous. "It's an ex
ample of arrogance of power in the ad
ministration," he said.
In addition to claiming that the con
crete graffiti is harmless, residents of
Branner say that it actually enhances
University property. A petition is cur
rently being passed around the
dormitory to have the pavement de
clared a work of art. The petition also
claims that the estimated cost of replac
ing the pavement is much too high,
since only a small portion of the con
crete where the graffiti was written
would actually need to be replaced.
When told of the incident, Art Prof.
Albert Elsen, who heads the Committee
on Outdoor Art, claimed that it is im
possible for the students to have their
graffiti designated as art. "Are any of
them artists?" he asked, "Do any of
them have credentials?"
Elsen said the committee would not
consider judging whether the graffiti
was art. "The students didn't set out to
create artwork; it was their intention af
ter the fact. They have no case," he said.
Another complaint the students are,
making is that they were not informed
of the consequences of cement-carving.

CONCRETE EVIDENCE: Hardened vanity press may cost Branner residents
$1100. Disagreements between University officials and Branner resion
the nature of their "artwork" surfaced when students autographed the
wet cement in front of their dorm.
