# Clydesdales horse around for Anheuser- Busch

### MIKA HOLGERSON 
The advertisement jingle, "Here
comes the King, here comes the big
number one .. " will be ringing
through White Plaza today at
noon. From the confines of the TV
screen, the famous Budweiser
Clysedale horses will "come to
life" to visit Stanford.
The Budweiser team will meet
the Stanford band and the Dollies
in the Wilbur parking lot and then
together will parade to White Plaza
at noon. After half an hour in
White Plaza, the "Clydes" will pro
ceed to the Children's Hospital,
where they will "team up" with San
Francisco 49er receiver Dwight
Clark at 2 p.m.

As part of a promotional cam
paign, the Anheuser-Busch com
pany and Stanford's Campus En
tertainment Board (CEB) are
bringing Budweiser's "gentle
giants" to the Farm. Since the qual
ity of beer used to be measured by
how far draft horses could pull
their load in one day, these majestic
Clydesdales symbolize quality for
Anheuser-Busch. For the CEB
they offer a great opportunity to
publicize Stanford's new student
run organization.

Nearly 50 years ago, in 1933,

Americans celebrated the repeal of
the Prohibition. August Busch, a
future owner of the beer company,
celebrated the repeal's success by
presenting his father with the first
Budweiser Clydesdale team. Since
then, the Clydesdales have pulled
the red, white and gold Anheuser-
Busch beer wagon across America.
Besides fulfilling the require
ments of bay color, four white

stockings and a blaze of white on
the face, an Anheuser-Busch
Clydesdale must have a gentle tem
perament. Guided by slow and
quiet commands, three-year-old
Clydesdale learn to pull a beer
wagon as part of an eight-horse
hitch. The horse and handler learn
to understand each other and, al
though it takes two men to drive

team, the horses can respond to a
mere slight of the hand.
f'dr their annual 300 ap
pearances across the country, the
horses must be in the best of health.
Travelling with the hitch are seven
groomsmen who care for, feed and
groom them. Before each public
performance, the Clydesdales must
patiently endure about five hours

of washing, braiding and re-rib
boning.
Walt Brady, head driver for the
St. Louis hitch, has traveled with
the Clydesdales for nearly half a
century and has become quite fond
of his gentle friends. "You really
get attached to them," he said.
"They become your children." Af
ter spending 10 months a year, six

days a week, eight hours a day with
them for 42 years, Brady claims
that each individual horse has his
own distinctive personality.
The eight-horse hitch that will
appear on campus today is from
Romoland, a Clydesdale stable fa
cility near Anheuser-Busch's Los
Angeles brewery. Lloyd Fergeson
will be the head driver of the hitch.
The Clydesdale was originally a

large horse bred to carry Scottish
knights into battle. In America this
powerful animal was a work horse
used to pull heavy loads and to
brew beer. Though rising mecha
nization lessened the need for horse
power, they are still a popular show
horse.
Anheuser-Busch breeds its
Clydesdales at Grant's Farm in St.

Louis, Missouri. There, 75 pure
bred horses romp in the rolling
fields and luxuriate in the stables.
Grant's stables are no ordinary
stables for ordinary horses, how
ever. The horses live in an oval
shaped stone building complete
with cathedral glass windows, a
chandelier, and an office and wait
ing room for the grooms and vis
itors.
Bringing the "gentle giants" to
Stanford wasn't a simple, clear-cut
task, according to Bill Fair,
Anheuser Busch's college repre
sentative here. "This has been in
the planning stages for nearly two
months," he said.
"We had to get a police escort,
we had to talk to people from Pub
lic Events, grourids and Operations
and Maintenence," added Fair,
who "grew up with the Clydes"
while attending high school in St.
Louis, Anheuser-Busch's home
base.
Fair asserts that the horses are
not exclusively for advertising
purposes. "They (the Clydes) are a
medium through which we
(Anheuser-Busch) can meet peo
ple," he said. "They're not at Stan
ford to sell beer. Otherwise, we
wouldn't be taking them to the
Children's Hospital."
