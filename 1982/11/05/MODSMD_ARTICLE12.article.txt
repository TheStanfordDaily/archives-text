## Beware the Libertarian dream 
### 
He spoke to us with the confidence of a successful
missionary. With eyes glowing at the mention of the
liberty provided by the "free market," Libertarian
gubernatorial candidate Dan Dougherty presented
simple answers to each election issue and insisted
that, yes, his day would come.
He lost, fortunately. But Dougherty and the
thousands who mouth his party line didn't intend
to win: Libertarian candidates were running to
spread the word, to prepare for their Utopia which
reflects the thought of the 1890s more than of the
forthcoming decades.
It seems at first hard to oppose the Libertarians'
slogans of freedom, limited government and liberty
all to be achieved through that bastion of im
agined individualism, the free market (whatever
that is). Who after all, is against peace, freedom and
apple pie? But along with their unopposable
slogans, the Libertarians bring no sense of commit
ment to their society and little understanding that
current problems are too complex, too rooted in
historical circumstance, to be banished with an ap
peal to a rugged competition that brought with it
more than a few limits to liberty.
The Libertarian position has an uncanny ability
to align with the weaknesses of the moment's au
dience: a few years ago, the catch issues were op
position to the draft and drug laws; now the raging
topics are, not surprisingly, tax reduction, lim
ited government spending and support of a budget
reducing nuclear freeze. This election was no dif
ferent. Dougherty, for example, ran on the plat
form of "revitalizing the economy" (tax cuts and no
more nasty regulation), "unshackling education"
(reducing public education) and "breaking the cy
cle of poverty" (eliminating welfare programs so
that the poor, too, can grow rich without govern
ment interference). ,
From their Fortress America foreign policy to
their rabid opposition to regulatory and social pro

grams, the Libertarians display the impulses that
lead some analysts to label them anarchists and
that show a remarkable ignorance of the very real
needs and conflicts of a modern, complex society.
From the California budget, for example,
Dougherty proposes initial reductions of $1 billion
of economic and environmental regulatory pro
grams and $4 billion from health and social pro
grams including at least a 45 percent initial slash
in all health and welfare programs.
The Libertarian position's similarity to Andrew
Carnegie's social Darwinism but stripped of
Carnegie's limited compassion and respect for the
mind is most clear in its education plan.
Dougherty proposes cutting $5 billion from state
aid to elementary and high school education, under
the assumption that the marketplace of private
education will and should educate the young.
Dougherty's irresponsibility and anti-intellectual
tinge is more apparent in his higher education poli
cies: "elimination of all funding for the University
of California, the California State University, and
the California Community Colleges."
The effects of the Libertarian programs are as
dismaying as the cult's growth (Eleventh District
voters cast 2884 ballots for Libertarian Chuck
Olsen last Tuesday). Perhaps worse is the impulse
of the members: the rich and self-sufficient, who
have benefited most from American institutions
and policies, seem intent upon casting their few ob
ligations aside. They dabble in politics to con
solidate their competitive position while mas
querading at helping the poor through the free mar
ket.
Their hypocrisy and narcissism would be for
givable if it were not so dangerous. Their so-called
freedom is theirs alone and comes at the expense of
the poor, of a society subjected to unregulated busi
ness and of those who recognize that only greater
commitment and participation not less will
continue the strengths of our society.
