## System denies rights of victims 
### 
While I was walking with some
friends through a dorm nearly two
weeks ago, someone said to us, "Did
you hear? A girl was murdered on cam
pus in broad daylight." I had to walk
away as I came close to crying and the
familiar pain in my chest began to grow.
It was another senseless waste of life.
The tears and the pain returned the fol
lowing Monday as I read about Angela
Arvidson. The story of her death re
minded me of another tragedy which
took place exactly two years ago Mon
day, while I was a sophomore at Cal
State, Sacramento. After leaving a
fraternity dinner dance, seniors Mary
Beth Sowers>and Craig Miller were kid
napped at gunpoint and murdered.
Like Angela, they were both outstand
ing individuals academically, social
ly and professionally. Although I was
never fortunate enough to know
Angela, Craig was my best friend, Mary
Beth my only sister.
I have become more aware of this
kind of atrocity in the past two years,
but I grieve for those who are not more
aware. We often hear that violent crime
has reached epidemic proportions in
this country and yet it seems that some
people don't realize the severity of the
problem. On any given day, it is im
possible to read a major newspaper
without rape, assault or murder staring
me in the face. We read about it, hear
about it and talk about it, but what is
being done about it? I have discussed
the problem with lawyers, policemen
and district attorneys. What do they

say? It just has to happen to enough
people before the legislators of this
country will pass some truly effective
legislation to keep habitual criminals
off the street.
So many people are wrapped up in
trying to protect the rights of the crimi
nals that our rights as law-abiding
citizens are sacrificed. Right now, the
attorneys representing Gerald Gallego,
the man accused of killing Mary Beth
and Craig, are trying to have all charges
dropped because Gallego's "constitu
tional rights were violated" when he
was apprehended. What these lawyers

are referring to is the FBl's questioning
of Gallego as to Mary Beth's where
abouts. At the time, we did not know
whether she was alive or dead her
body was not found until a month after
she was killed. As Gallego was being
questioned, and yelling about his con
stitutional rights, my father called the

attorney general's office in Sacramanto
and asked, "Who is protecting my
daughter's rights?" Some time later,
someone in the office called back and
said, "I'm sorry, Mr. Sowers, we just
don't have an answer for you."
If you read about many of tfifese
crimes, one striking fact becomes ap
parent: the majority of violent attacks
are committed by habitual criminals.
These are people who have been in
custody before and then released, just
like Gallego and the prime suspect in
the Arvidson case. I am not a criminal
justice major; I do not have the ex
perience or the knowledge to offer solu
tions. All I can do is appeal to anyone
who will listen. Please, become aware,
become involved, now. Don't wait until
it happens to you or someone you love.
I'd like to offer by deepest sympa
thies to Angela's family and friends
along with this poem which was written
for my sister by one of her friends:
Do not stand at my grave and weep.
I am not there, I do not sleep.
I am a thousand winds that blow.
I am the diamond glints on snow.
1 am the sunlight on ripened grain.
I am the gentle autumn's rain.
When you wake in the morning hush,
I am the swift uplifting rush,
of quiet birds in circled flight.
I am the soft stars that shine at night.
So do not stand at my grave and cry.
I am not there, I did not die.

the Arvidson case. I am not a criminal
justice major; I do not have the ex
perience or the knowledge to offer solu
tions. All I can do is appeal to anyone
who will listen. Please, become aware,
become involved, now. Don't wait until
it happens to you or someone you love.
I'd like to offer by deepest sympa
thies to Angela's family and friends
along with this poem which was written
for my sister by one of her friends:
Do not stand at my grave and weep.
I am not there, I do not sleep.
I am a thousand winds that blow.
I am the diamond glints on snow.
1 am the sunlight on ripened grain.
I am the gentle autumn's rain.
When you wake in the morning hush,
I am the swift uplifting rush,
of quiet birds in circled flight.
I am the soft stars that shine at night.
So do not stand at my grave and cry.
I am not there, I did not die.

If you read about many
of these crimes, one
striking fact becomes
apparent:
the majority of violent
attacks are committed
by habitual criminals.
While I was walking with some
friends through a dorm nearly two
weeks ago, someone said to us, "Did
you hear? A girl was murdered on cam
pus in broad daylight." I had to walk
away as I came close to crying and the
familiar pain in my chest began to grow.
It was another senseless waste of life.
The tears and the pain returned the fol
lowing Monday as I read about Angela
Arvidson. The story of her death re
minded me of another tragedy which
took place exactly two years ago Mon
day, while I was a sophomore at Cal
State, Sacramento. After leaving a
fraternity dinner dance, seniors Mary
Beth Sowers>and Craig Miller were kid
napped at gunpoint and murdered.
Like Angela, they were both outstand
ing individuals academically, social
ly and professionally. Although I was
never fortunate enough to know
Angela, Craig was my best friend, Mary
Beth my only sister.
I have become more aware of this
kind of atrocity in the past two years,
but I grieve for those who are not more
aware. We often hear that violent crime
has reached epidemic proportions in
this country and yet it seems that some
people don't realize the severity of the
problem. On any given day, it is im
possible to read a major newspaper
without rape, assault or murder staring
me in the face. We read about it, hear
about it and talk about it, but what is
being done about it? I have discussed
the problem with lawyers, policemen
and district attorneys. What do they

say? It just has to happen to enough
people before the legislators of this
country will pass some truly effective
legislation to keep habitual criminals
off the street.
So many people are wrapped up in
trying to protect the rights of the crimi
nals that our rights as law-abiding
citizens are sacrificed. Right now, the
attorneys representing Gerald Gallego,
the man accused of killing Mary Beth
and Craig, are trying to have all charges
dropped because Gallego's "constitu
tional rights were violated" when he
was apprehended. What these lawyers

are referring to is the FBl's questioning
of Gallego as to Mary Beth's where
abouts. At the time, we did not know
whether she was alive or dead her
body was not found until a month after
she was killed. As Gallego was being
questioned, and yelling about his con
stitutional rights, my father called the

attorney general's office in Sacramanto
and asked, "Who is protecting my
daughter's rights?" Some time later,
someone in the office called back and
said, "I'm sorry, Mr. Sowers, we just
don't have an answer for you."
If you read about many of tfifese
crimes, one striking fact becomes ap
parent: the majority of violent attacks
are committed by habitual criminals.
These are people who have been in
custody before and then released, just
like Gallego and the prime suspect in
the Arvidson case. I am not a criminal
justice major; I do not have the ex
perience or the knowledge to offer solu
tions. All I can do is appeal to anyone
who will listen. Please, become aware,
become involved, now. Don't wait until
it happens to you or someone you love.
