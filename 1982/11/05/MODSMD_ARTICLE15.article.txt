## U.S. foreign policy aids Soviets 
### 
Despite the emotionalized approach
of Renard Strautman's critique (Daily,
Oct. 13) of my column of October 6,
several friends have urged me to re
spond to his points. Many of the flaws
in his argument stem from a limited
knowledge of the Soviet Union, while
others I think relate to excessive gener
alization and misreading.

Strautman's assumption that Sov
iet s have a critical perspective on Sovi
et state pronouncements as they apply
to foreign policy is simply untenable.
He says that a cynical view of anti-
American propaganda "is already
widely disseminated" but points to no
empirical evidence. Like most Ameri
cans, average Soviet citizens have a very
pro-state point of view in the area of
foreign policy, while in domestic policy
they may have major (if silent) com
plaints. Part of this relates to the strong
memory of World War 11, and part to
the death of critical news reporting.
Until I spent some time in the Soviet
Union and conducted numerous con
versations with people (in Russian, un
supervised) I had also simply assumed
that the viewpoint one reads about in
the West in memoirs of dissident in
tellectuals was widespread. In fact,
however, outside Moscow and Lenin
grad quite the opposite is true, and a
strongly nationalistic and ideologically
unquestioning frame of mind prevails.
In his letter, Strautman attempts to
argue that the examples of Spain and
Greece prove that U.S. aid to author
itarian regimes fosters democracy. His
claims employ somewhat lazy historical
research, considering our almost non
existent ties to the former Franco gov
ernment. Significantly, his argument
neglects our major, long-term author
itarian aid recipients in Latin America.
Throughout Central America particu
larly, his claim of the evolutionary ef
fect of "democratic" aid has proved
false, where instead we have extended
the lives of several brutal dictatorships.

In Chile, and the Dominican Republic,
U.S. "aid" had clearly the reverse ef
fect, aiding anti-democratic forces and
leading to creation of violent, regressive
regimes.
Finally, Strautman's concluding
comment "public opinion does not a
policy make" regarding the strength of
popular considerations in policy-mak

ing has no bearing whatsoever on my
argument; I stated as much in my own
article. I fail to understand in this re
spect why Strautman attempted to read
a policy of "appeasement" into my col
umn. Revamping our patently ineffec
tive Latin American policies and a pull
ing back of Cold War rhetoric is prag
matic, not cowardly.
These policies are alienating our al
lies while giving the Soviet military
added strength in bugetary issues
within the USSR. On a p. opagandist
level, the effect of our policies (and this
was my argument) is to strengthen Rus

sian nationalistic feelings among the
population and lend credence to the
government's doctrinal claims about
the inherent militarism and hostility of
the capitalist West. The reciprocal ef
fect is always evident in the United
States when the Soviets increase their
military outlays, sword-rattling and in
volvement in foreign conflicts (witn»
the U.S. popular reaction to the
vasion of Afghanistan and Carter's ef
fective rallying of nationalism and anti-
Communism).
One last and crucial contradiction in
Strautman's piece is his argument for
the democratic character of Greece and
Spain (both pro-socialist) along with a
rejection of a change of course toward
moderate socialist foreign policy which
is resulting in the strengthening of the
radical left over the moderate-socialist
center as happened in Nicaragua.
While 1 support Strautman's right to
offer his own interpretation of events, 1
would ask that when proposing coun
ter-arguments he stick to what colum
nists say and not what he seems to en
vision as some generally Hawed scheme
of all "whining liberals." The Dailffjl
should be a forum for (he discussion of
ideas, not a barnyard for random
mudslinging.

Until I spent some time in the Soviet Union and
conducted numerous conversations with people (in
Russian, unsupervised) I had also simply assumed
that the viewpoint one reads about in the West in
memoirs of dissident intellectuals was widespread.

Despite the emotionalized approach
of Renard Strautman's critique (Daily,
Oct. 13) of my column of October 6,
several friends have urged me to re
spond to his points. Many of the flaws
in his argument stem from a limited
knowledge of the Soviet Union, while
others I think relate to excessive gener
alization and misreading.

Strautman's assumption that Sov
iet s have a critical perspective on Sovi
et state pronouncements as they apply
to foreign policy is simply untenable.
He says that a cynical view of anti-
American propaganda "is already
widely disseminated" but points to no
empirical evidence. Like most Ameri
cans, average Soviet citizens have a very
pro-state point of view in the area of
foreign policy, while in domestic policy
they may have major (if silent) com
plaints. Part of this relates to the strong
memory of World War 11, and part to
the death of critical news reporting.
Until I spent some time in the Soviet
Union and conducted numerous con
versations with people (in Russian, un
supervised) I had also simply assumed
that the viewpoint one reads about in
the West in memoirs of dissident in
tellectuals was widespread. In fact,
however, outside Moscow and Lenin
grad quite the opposite is true, and a
strongly nationalistic and ideologically
unquestioning frame of mind prevails.
