## Scholarly defense of minority recruitment recalled 
### 
The announcement that Robert Ro
senzweig, vice president for public af
fairs, was resigning to assume the presi
dency of the AAU next January called
to mind an article he authored almost
15 years ago. The article was written
during a period in which there was
much racial strife on many university
campuses across the country, as con
cerned individuals were advancing the
cause of increased enrollment of stu
dents of color. The title of his article
was "The Reach of the Submerged,"
and it appeared in the Sum
mer/Autumn 1968 issue of Stanford
Today.

What was significant about the Ro

senzweig article was that, as associate
provost at the time, I believe he was ex
pressing the University's rationale for
recruiting and admitting more students
of color. That rationale centered mainly
around the parameter and necessity of
student body diversity. This article was
written in the face of bitter reaction
from some alumni, disappointed pa
rents whose sons and daughters were
not admitted to the University and oth
ers. What often troubles me are public
positions taken by sponsors of pro
grams benefitting people of color that
are not well-founded, or are weakly de
fended. Whether the article was solic
ited or volunteered, the position taken
by Rosenzweig was logical, scholarly

and strongly presented and founded on
institutional wisdom.

Suicide coverage
I was deeply disturbed by the front
page article, "Student Attempts Sui
cide," (Daily, Nov. 2). Both the Daily
and its sources have seriously com
promised the student's right to privacy;
if not- legally, then ethically. Your de
cision to publish his name was ill-ad
vised. As a former hospital adminis
trator, I was disgusted by the willing
ness of Martinez Kaiser Hospital to

discuss the patient's condition with a
campus newspaper. That the dean of
Student Affairs would publicly reveal a
previous offer of psychiatric help to a
particular student is appalling.
Suicide is a legitimate and pressing
topic of discussion both on and off cam
pus. Greater awareness of its incidence,
causes and warning signs can facilitate
successful intervention. There is noth
ing wrong with reporting an attempt,
but to do so with the insensitivity dis
played in your article is uncons
cionable. Anonymity would not detract
from the salience of the issue, only from
its sensationalism.

Pull over
Last Saturday evening I had the privi
lege of riding with a police officer dur
ing her shift as part of the Community
Ride Along program. The evening was
both educational and exciting, an ex
perience I would recommend to any
one. One thing that stands out was the
poor reaction some drivers had when
we were responding to an emergency.
All drivers except one pulled over to the
right as we approached, but many did
not stop; they merely reduced speed.
California law dictates that a driver
must pull over and stop when safe upon
hearing or seeing a siren. This also
makes common sense. As a driver, you
do not know what the emergency vehi
cle is going to do near your car; turn
right, turn left, pass by, switch lanes etc.
If you are moving, albeit slowly, the
chances for misinterpretation and
hence accident increases dramati
cally. In our case a coasting car made a
right turn we had to make extremely
difficult.
So please, when seeing an active
emergency vehicle, pull over and stop,
not matter which side of the road the ve
hicle is on. It's the law. More im
portantly, it's best for you and your
passengers, the people in the respond
ing vehicle and the victim(s) in need of
prompt help.
