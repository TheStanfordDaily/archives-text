# Aid officer sees little benefit
## Scholarship search services criticized 
### LISA TSENG 
The rising costs of attending college coupled with cut
backs in federal student aid have led to an increase in the
number and popularity of private scholarship and financial
aid search companies. Although these companies offer a va
riety of services for students, two top financial aid officers
here have criticized the value of their services.
According to Robert Huff, director of financial aids, these
companies are "not worth the expense incurred. You just
don't find a scholarship sitting there.
"What I have heard about these search services has not
caused me to make a list of these services and inform stu
dents. I just haven't sensed much benefit," he said.
Huff said the University provides information on finan
cial aid for all students who need it. Nearly 70 percent of the
freshmen are receiving some form of financial aid this year,
he said.
Of the $ 18.3 million total that undergraduates here will re
ceive in financial aid, $1.4 million of it will come from
sources outside the University and the state and federal gov
ernment.
Outside funds are available to students and to obtain
them, he said, "it's just a matter of seeking and choosing
them according to personal need."
Vince De Anda, acting associate director of financial aids,
said he has not seen a computer service that compensates for
the difficulty in winning scholarships. "80 percent of the
sources included in these service packets pass through the fi

nancial aids office on an individual basis anyway," he said.
DeAnda recommended that students do their own re
search for financial aid through library sources and discover
the best ways to seek aid for themselves.
However, Rea Christofferson, director of advertising at
Peterson's Guides, which publishes scholarship informa
tion, said she assumed the information was helpful.
Most of the private scholarship services offer a privately
designed computerized printout of those sources best suited
to a student's situation and need. They provide students with
names and addresses of donors.
One such service, the Scholarship Bank, has an informa
tion pool including 25,000 possible scholarship sources. Ac
cording to Steve Banz, director of the Los Angeles-based ser
vice, this list is regularly updated. After completing a ques
tionaire on academic and financial background, he said, the
applicant can receive either a minimum of 20 source names
at cost of $35 or a minimum of 50 for $45.
In addition, a special deal provided by the service allows
two students to recieve printouts for the price of one, he
added
Your Own Financial Aid Factory, a book written by
Robert Leider is another form of a financial aid search ser
vice. This guide includes step-by-step instructions to the fi
nancial aid process plus descriptions of over 50,000 scholar
ships at 700 different colleges. It also offers information on
government and privately-sponsored scholarships.
Peterson's Guides, the publishers
that put this edition out, also promote
their own computerized compilation of
alternative sources of financial aid.
