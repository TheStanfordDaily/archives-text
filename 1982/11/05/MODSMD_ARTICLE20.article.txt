## Card comeback upsets UOP 
### STEPHEN STRENG 
The No. 4-ranked Stanford
women's volleyball team upset
the No. 3-ranked University of
the Pacific Wednesday night at
Maples Pavilion, winning the
fifth game in a 19-17 heart
stopper after having lost the first
two games of the match.
The winning point of the fifth
game came on a double-hit call
on the Tigers after a kill by junior

setter Kari Rush had given the
Cardinal a side-out.
Stanford reversed the trend of
the first two games and built up a
13-5 lead in the fifth, mostly on
kills and blocks by freshman sen
sation Kim Oden who finished
with 32 kills for the night. UOP
would not give up, though, and
came back to tie the game 13-13
when Pacific's freshman outside
hitter Pam Burdue nailed an er

rant Stanford bump for a kill.
That began the thrilling finale
with each team going at each oth
er point for point, side-out for
side-out until the score stood
knotted at 17-17.
Oden smashed a kill to give the
Cardinal an 18-17 advantage.
That was followed by a Pacific
side-out, Rush's kill, and the
double-hit call that gave Stan
ford the match. It was the first

five-game match played in
Maples this year and the last
home game of the season.
The first two games were a re
play of a common Cardinal
malady of the last few games: fall
ing behind early and being un
able to come back. After falling
behind 9-3, the Cardinal lost the
first game 15-11. In the second
game, Stanford was unable to re
bound from an 11-3 deficit and
lost the game 15-10.
The Cardinal got into trouble
on their own mistakes. Seven of
Pacific's first nine points in the
second game came on either er
rant Cardinal shots that went
out-of-bounds or into the net, or
on ball-handling errors.
The third game saw an instant
turnaround in Stanford's play.
The Cardinal roared out to an
8-0 lead. The stunned Tigers were
never close as the Card won the
game 15-7.
It did not appear as though
Stanford would be able to keep
up their pace as they fell behind
again, 5-2, in the all-important
fourth game. Fighting for their
lives, the Cardinal battled back
to take their first lead at 8-7 on a
smash by senior outside hitter
Deanne Boyette. Pacific sprung
back, however, and went ahead
11-10 on a spike by sophomore
outside hitter Lisa Franco. But it
would prove to be UOP's last
lead, as Stanford went ahead for
good, 12-11, on a block by Oden
and Rush. The Cardinal won the
game 15-13.
"It was a great comeback,"
said an elated assistant coach
Don Shaw. "We were trying too
hard in the beginning. We were
creating our own problems."
Commenting on the fifth
game, Shaw said, "We had our
usual 13-5 lead that disappeared
and turned into a 19-17 heart
throbber. The crowd was great.
That's something we haven't had
in past years."
This weekend Stanford travels
to UCLA to play in the National
Invitational Tournament. The
tournament consists of 20 teams,
16 of them ranked in the top 20 in
the nation. Last year the
Cardinal finished fourth.

setter Kari Rush had given the
Cardinal a side-out.
Stanford reversed the trend of
the first two games and built up a
13-5 lead in the fifth, mostly on
kills and blocks by freshman sen
sation Kim Oden who finished
with 32 kills for the night. UOP
would not give up, though, and
came back to tie the game 13-13
when Pacific's freshman outside
hitter Pam Burdue nailed an er

rant Stanford bump for a kill.
That began the thrilling finale
with each team going at each oth
er point for point, side-out for
side-out until the score stood
knotted at 17-17.
Oden smashed a kill to give the
Cardinal an 18-17 advantage.
That was followed by a Pacific
side-out, Rush's kill, and the
double-hit call that gave Stan
ford the match. It was the first

five-game match played in
Maples this year and the last
home game of the season.
The first two games were a re
play of a common Cardinal
malady of the last few games: fall
ing behind early and being un
able to come back. After falling
behind 9-3, the Cardinal lost the
first game 15-11. In the second
game, Stanford was unable to re
bound from an 11-3 deficit and
lost the game 15-10.
The Cardinal got into trouble
on their own mistakes. Seven of
Pacific's first nine points in the
second game came on either er
rant Cardinal shots that went
out-of-bounds or into the net, or
on ball-handling errors.
The third game saw an instant
turnaround in Stanford's play.
The Cardinal roared out to an
8-0 lead. The stunned Tigers were
never close as the Card won the
game 15-7.
It did not appear as though
Stanford would be able to keep
up their pace as they fell behind
again, 5-2, in the all-important
fourth game. Fighting for their
lives, the Cardinal battled back
to take their first lead at 8-7 on a
smash by senior outside hitter
Deanne Boyette. Pacific sprung
back, however, and went ahead
11-10 on a spike by sophomore
outside hitter Lisa Franco. But it
would prove to be UOP's last
lead, as Stanford went ahead for
good, 12-11, on a block by Oden
and Rush. The Cardinal won the
game 15-13.
"It was a great comeback,"
said an elated assistant coach
Don Shaw. "We were trying too
hard in the beginning. We were
creating our own problems."
Commenting on the fifth
game, Shaw said, "We had our
usual 13-5 lead that disappeared
and turned into a 19-17 heart
throbber. The crowd was great.
That's something we haven't had
in past years."
This weekend Stanford travels
to UCLA to play in the National
Invitational Tournament. The
tournament consists of 20 teams,
16 of them ranked in the top 20 in
the nation. Last year the
Cardinal finished fourth.
