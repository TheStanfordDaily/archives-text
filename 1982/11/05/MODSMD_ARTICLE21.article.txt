# Card hosts red-hot 'Cats
## 
### SID SPAETH 
With a 43-31 win over No. 2
Washington last week, Stan
ford has set its sights on a
bowl game.
But so has Arizona, who
has not lost in four games in
cluding a win over Notre
Dame and tie with UCLA,
both on the road. Arizona has
not lost on the road this sea
son.
There is no turning back
now and each of the final
three games is extremely im
portant. Stanford hosts Ari
zona, a conference surprise,
tomorrow in the first of its im
portant final three games.
John Elway, the most-ac
claimed passer in Stanford
football history, will play in
his last home game.
"Whether John wins the
Heisman or not," Stanford
coach Paul Wiggin said. "I
know the best player in Amer
ica is right here at Stanford. I
really believe that."
Stanford's attack became
more balanced last week and
three other seniors, who also
will play their final home
games, emerged, at least, as
co-stars.
Running back Mike Dot
terer slashed for back-to-back
100-yard rushing games on
the Cardinal's newly-polished
pitch sweeps. Running back
Vincent White, who shares
backfield time with Dotterer,
danced for a 76-yard touch
down punt return.
Tight end Chris DresseT

caught six passes and has es
tablished himself as Stan
ford's trump card on crucial
downs.
"Chris (Dressel) played the
best game of his life against
Washington," Wiggin said.
"He's a complete tight end,
who continues to deliver in
the clutch for us."
The offensive line has pro
vided the impetus for the new
ly-found running game. The
threat of the run has also
helped the line protect Elway,
who earlier in the year had
been sacked four or more
times a game.
"It is going to be a tremen
dous challenge," Wildcat
coach Larry Smith said.
"Stanford, as a team, has im
proved tremendously. The
last two weeks they have
found away to win and that is
what we preach here.
"And what can you say
about Elway? He is great, but
I think they are a better team
now because they aren't de
pending solely on John
Elway. They have given the
running backs the opportuni
ty and they've done a good
job."
Hanging on to the football
could be the key factor.
Stanford leads the league
with 19 interceptions, but Ari
zona, behind quarterback
Tom Tunnicliffe, has thrown
only four. Stanford's Charles
Hutchings and Arizona's
Randy Robbins are co-lead
ers in the Pac-10 with five in

terceptions each.
Stanford leads the Pac-10 in
turnover ratio with a plus-14
on give-away/take-away ra
tio.
Linebacker Garin Veris
bolstered Stanford's defensive
surge against Washington
with 14 tackles including four
sacks for a minus-33 yards
and also caused a fumble.
"There couldn't have been
a better game played by any
one in the Pac-10 last week
end," Wiggin said. "He's sim
ply great player, and great
players make great plays."
The Stanford secondary
has been jumbled by injuries.
Eric Price and Rodney
Gilmore are listed as uncer
tain-to-doubtful. Darrell
Grissum will move from safe
ty to cornerback and Dwain
Hamilton will be back-up at
at both corners and Steve
Lemon will be back-up at
both safeties.
Tunnicliffe's offense has
averaged 504 yards and 44.5
points in its last two games.
Tunnicliffe has connected on
nearly 58 percent of his passes
for 1625 yards this season.
The Wildcat offensive line
was named offensive player of
the week on regional tele
vision last week as they
opened holes for an array of
Arizona backs. Fullback
Courtney Griffin leads the
Cats with 339 yards rushing,
but the tailback position has

been unstable with three players
sharing action.
Vance Johnson has rushed for
251 yards, btit was hampered in
the early season with a bruised
shoulder and an ankle sprain.
Brian Holland was academically
ineligible until three weeks ago
and Phil Freeman broke an ankle
last week and is lost for the sea
son.
Brad Anderson leads the re
ceiving corps with 34 receptions
for 610 yards.
The Wildcat defense is an
chored by inside linebacker
Ricky Hunley, who according to
Wiggin "falls into the same cate
gory as Vernon Maxwell (Arizo
na State), Mark Stewart (Wash
ington) and Garin Veris." Line
backer Glenn Perkins and Rob
bins are also keys to the Arizona
defense.
The defense has allowed only
84.8 yards in its last four games.
"Arizona was a team that peo
ple rated ahead of us in the pre
season," Wiggin said. "But even
after they tied UCLA (24-24) and
beat Notre Dame this year, they
were still called 'spoilers'. Well, I
think what was once considered
spoilers is now just an outstand
ing football team."

OSKIE: Stanford defensive back Kevin Baird celebrates after picking off his third 'oskie' of the
season in the Cardinal's 43-31 upset of Washington last weekend. With foifr interceptions against
the Huskies, Stanford continues to lead the Pac-10 with 19 going into tomorrow's final home contest
against the Wildcats.

VERSATILE ATTACK: Stanford quarterback John Elway, in what is becoming less and less of
an uncharacteristic pose, hands off to one of his backs in Stanford's win over the Huskies. The
Cardinal rushing attack rambled for 192 yards against UW, and will be tested tomorrow against
the fourth-best rushing defense in the conference in Arizona.
