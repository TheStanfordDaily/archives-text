# Water poloists close home slate Saturday
## 
### CHRIS ADDINGTON 
James Bergeson, John Tan
ner, Jeff Sailing, Kirk Jensen,
Greg Lambert and Don King
are all names familiar to ev
eryone who follows Stanford
water polo. But, this weekend
these six will wear the
Cardinal red for the last time
at their home pool.
The No. 2-ranked Stanford
squad will host this season's
last home matches at De-
Guerre pool this afternoon at
4 p.m. against UC-Davis and
tomorrow at 11 a.m. against
the University of the Pacific.
"We've really been working
hard this week in preparation
for the end of the season,"
commented Stanford coach
Dante Dettamanti. "It will be

a nice break to play two non
conference teams."
UC-Davis, a Division II
School, is unranked while
UOP has been a surprise in
the NCAA and is currently
ranked No. 7 after several sea
sons of anonymity.
"These games will give us a
good chance to work on some
new offensive adjustments,"
said Dettamanti. "UOP will
give us a good game. They're
quick and scrappy."
Stanford still has three
league contests before the
NCAA national cham
pionships. Next weekend they
travel to Los Angeles to take
on USC and UCLA and then
it's the Big Splash at Berkeley
on November 20th.
