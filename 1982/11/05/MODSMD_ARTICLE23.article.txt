# Official Daily, KZSU picks with guest greek
## 
### 
Guest Greek is a weekly feature of the Daily
sports section, where we find some unsuspecting
soul to put his/her predictive powers on the line
against the greek gods, sports editors Steve Odell
and Sid Spaeth. Also on the weekly slate are
KZSU sports director Tom Kohn and the Latest

Line from Las Vegas.
This week's Guest Greek is Bruce Rosenstock,
an assistant professor of Classics at Stanford who.
appropriately inough, is an instructor in Greek.
Rosenstock proclaimed" May Stanford win," and
added "Kleos Aphthiton" as an afterthought.
