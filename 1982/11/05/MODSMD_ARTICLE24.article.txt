# Rose resigns as Stanford SID
## 
### ADAM BERNS 
Sports information director
Bob Rose confirmed yester
day that he will resign his post
effective at the end of the foot
ball season.
Rose will become public re
lations director for the Los
Angeles Express of the newly
formed United States Foot
ball League, a move that will
reportedly double his present
salary.
Stanford's SID since 1979,
Rose has been instrumental in
John Elway's Heisman
Trophy campaign. He will re
linquish his duties at Stanford
following the California foot
ball game Nov. 20, regardless
of whether the Cardinal is in
vited to a bowl game.
"The L.A. Express had
shown interest a few months
before," Rose said last night.
"It was obviously not good
timing to leave in the middle
of football season, however,

so I postponed my decision
until now.
"There were many reasons
for taking the job," Rose ex
plained. "The salary is good,
it's professional football and
it's a great career opportunity.
It was a move I couldn't turn
down."
The announcement of
Rose's resignation came as
somewhat of a surprise be
cause of its timing, but inside
sources said that Rose has
been looking into other op
portunities for a while. His
wife, Lacy Lee Rose, quit as
head of promotions and pub
licity for the Athletic Depart
ment earlier this year.
"I think that it's a career
move for Bob," Stanford ath
letic director Andy Geiger
told the Daily last night. "I've
been pleased with his work for
Stanford. Bob Rose is as good
as one gets."
Geiger said that Rose's re

placement will be announced
next Monday. Assistant SID
Steve Raczynski appears to be
the frontrunner for the spot.
An insider, he would be a
logical choice because of
Stanford's probable bowl ap
pearance. Raczynski was the
SID at Princeton before tak
ing the assistant SID job at
Stanford, replacing former as
sistant SID Chris Pre
imesberger this summer. Pre
imesberger left last spring to
take a job with the Peninsula
Times Tribune.
In a telephone interview
last night, Raczynski men
tioned that he had talked to
Geiger about the post but said
that the announcement about
RoSe's successor would be
coming next week.
In related news, Geiger dis
pelled rumors that he would
be leaving Stanford to take
the job as executive director of
the Pacific-10 conference.
