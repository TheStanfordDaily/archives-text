# NFL strike update
## 
### Associated Press 
New York National Football League club owners, in a new, bid to
end the 45-day-old strike, last night offered the players a bonus of up'
to $60,000 apiece. !
In what the management council entitled its "Money Now" pro-,
posal, which it said was worth $6O million for 1982, each vested veter-!
an would receive $60,000 as soon as a new collective bargaining agree-!
ment was signed.
A vested player is one who has played at least three games into his!
fourth season. The management council estimated that half the 1500!
players would fall into that category.
