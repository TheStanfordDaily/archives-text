## The 						Man Who Would Be Mick makes a party record 
### STEFAN MALMOLI 
What ever happened to New
York rock and roll? What hap
pened to all of those punk fore
fathers like Lou Reed and 1 om
Verlaine? When was the last time
Patti Smith released something,
or more important, when was the
last time that Blondie or the
Ramones put out something
worthwhile? Besides Talking
Heads, I can think ot no other
New York band or performer
that is still progressing favorably
with their music. Then in the
midst of all this rubble, emerges
David Johansen, former leader
of the N.Y. Dolls. For all of you
uninformed West Coasters and
you ignorant East Coasters, the
Dolls were an early 70s pre
punk, glitter-rock band that was
truly great before its time. As one
of their albums accurately de
scribed them, they were Too
Much Too Soon. However, the
Mick Jaggerized leader of the
band, David Johansen, after a
few years of uneventful solo
albums, has Finally compiled a
live album that brings back the
bite and urgency of the New
York rock scene. Live It Up cap
tures the spontaneous, soul-stir
ring atmosphere of Johansen's
kinetic live shows, thus enabling
him to come up with the party
record of the year.

David Johansen's main
strength lies in his abilities to
communicate in concert an inno
cent and free-wheeling at
mosphere. His songs are Phil
Spector rhythm-and-blues-in
fluenced vignettes with a British
Invasion (Old Wave) punch. On
previous records, his songs
seemed shallow and unsubstan
tial at times. However, when per
formed live, the songs take on a
passion and intensity that enable
the songs to go beyond their ori
ginal limitations. On his own
"Funky But Chic," the listener
(audience) cannot help but get
caught up in the positive dance
fervor of the song. Even
Johansen's Mick Jagger postur
ings and imitations seem good
natured and amusing. Ev
erything about these songs is fun
and on his remake of the 'sos
novelty hit, "Stranded In The
Jungle," the effect is almost hys
terical.
Musically, the album succeeds
since it collects Johansen's best
material, dating from the Dolls
standout, "Personality Crisis,"
through Johansen's more ac
cessible solo efforts, like
"Melody." His own lyrics can be
satirical, angered and desperate
but always, they never lose ttyeir
light and amusing qualities. In
songs like "Frenchette,"

Johansen is willing to give up his
girl, just as long as she'll still
dance with him "I can't get the
kind of love that I want, that I
need, so let's just dance!".
Basically, Johansen cannot give
up dancing because dancing can
be as emotional as love and sex (if
it isn't that already). As he re
lated, "Ever since you've been
away, it's been so hard to dance."
Johansen's music is a synthesis
of Phil Spector's famed "wall of
sound" productions with the
tighter, sparser aspects of
Rolling Stones-type rock. There
are touches of Springsteen and
Motown thrown in as well, which
is clearly pointed out in his
ballad, "Donna." However, the
album's true success lies in the ex
cellent choice of cover versions
that Johansen and his band per
form. Johansen's re-doings of
"classics" are like mini-re
discoverings of rock's past. His
remake of the Spector-produced
Ronettes hit, "Is This What I Get
For Loving You," takes the song
out of its original girl-group con
text, thus enabling it to take on
some painfully powerful mo
ments. Likewise, his cover of the
Four Tops' "Reach Out, I'll Be
There" is the perfect song for
Johansen to communicate men
tally and physically with the au
dience. The song's intensity

grows with each chorus, and the
desire to "reach out" fully to the
audience results in Johansen
physically diving into the au
dience to really reach out and be
there.
For an artist who has been
around for as long as David
Johansen has without gaining
commercial acceptance, the rock
and roll life must have lost its vi
tality and vision. However, Jy
Johansen, the same dream Si
the same uplifting spirit are ever
present, since he is still on stage
having fun. His passion for fight
ing the hardships of life through
rock and roll (regardless of
whether he wins or loses) is best
represented in Johansen's tour de
force of a remake. In Johansen's
medley of the Animals' great re
bellion anthems ("We Gotta Get
Out Of This Place/ Don't Bring
Me Down /It's My Life"), he
places himself and his
a defiant stance to fight hardsmp
with rock. When he sings the
classic lines, "It's a hard world to
get a break in; all the good things
have been taken," we know that
he isn't kidding. Above all
though, we also know that David
Johansen is still gaining satisfac
tion in this hard world that won't
give him the break that he de
serves. It truly is an inspiring
piece of rock and roll.
