Planned Israeli settlements nettle U.S.

Washington The Reagan administration reacted sharply yesterday to
reports that Israel is going ahead with a decision to build more Jewish settle
ments on the Israeli-occupied West Bank. The State Department called the
action "most unwelcome," and the White House said it was "not helpful" to
the Middle East peace process.
"We cannot understand why, at a time when we are actively seeking
broader participation in the peace process, Israel persists in a pattern of ac
tivity which erodes the confidence of all.. ~" said State Department spokes
man Alan Romberg, referring to U.S. efforts to win the backing of Jordan
and other moderate Arab nations for President Reagan's peace initiative in
the Middle East.
When he made his peace proposals on Sept. 1, Reagan called for a freeze
on Israeli settlement in the occupied West Bank, where more than 20,000
Jews now live in more than 100 such settlements among 800,000
Palestinians. Reagan proposed that Palestinians in the West
Bank and Gaza be granted self-rule in association with Jordan.
But the Israeli Caoinet acted later in September to approve es
tablishment of eight new settlements on the West Bank. Housing
Minister David Levy said in Israel Wednesday that five of the
eight would be set up soon.
Reacting to reports of Levy's statement, State Department
spokesman Romberg said yesterday that this determination to
continue expansion of Israeli settlements on the West Bank
"raises questions about Israel's willingness to abide by the prom
ise of U.N. Security Council Resolution 242 that territory will be
exchanged for true peace."
Israeli diplomats said they were surprised at the harsh lan
guage. One senior Israeli diplomat termed the U.S. public
criticism "a mistake."
U.S. forces monitor East Beirut
Beirut The U.S. Marines, one day behind schedule, ex
panded their role in the Lebanese capital yesterday and began
patrolling sections of East Beirut, where Christian militiamen
have refused to lay down their arms.
The Marines were scheduled to begin the patrols on Wednes
day, but a bureaucratic foul-up had prevented the orders from
coming down through the chain of command from Washington.
On yesterday, however, the patrol went off without a hitch, as
14 Marines, accompanied by a Lebanese army officer, drove four
jeeps through portions of both East and West Beirut.
The small convoy's presence is intended to be a symbolic ex
pansion of the American role in Beirut, which the Lebanese gov
ernment hopes will ease the difficulty of the country's regular
army in deploying throughout the nation's unoccupied areas. At
present, tljat is not much land, as the Israelis occupy the southern
half of Lebanon, and the Syrians and Palestinians occupy the
eastern Bekaa Valley.
The Marines uneventfully patrolled a 4'/2-mile circuit for 2 x h
hours before returning to their base near the Beirut International
Airport. A Marine spokesman said another patrol is scheduled
for Friday and that it would follow a different route.
Hopes for lame-duck Congress fade
Washington Democratic gains in the House and post-elec
tion Republican soul-searching in the Senate have virtually
eliminated chances of significant action by Congress when it re
turns Nov. 29 for a lame-duck session that few of its members
wanted in the first place.
Prospects for major legislation, already dim before Tuesday's
elections, are even dimmer now, congressional sources said yes
terday.
The session, demanded by President Reagan during the cam
paign to prod the 97th Congress into completing its budget work,
is likely to wind up without accomplishing much more than pas
sage of a few appropriations bills and more stopgap funding for
the rest of the government.
It is not even certain that a defense appropriations bill, con
sidered a priority item by the administration as well as many con
gressional leaders, will be adopted before the 97th Congress
fades into history shortly before Christmas, aides to several lead
ers said yesterday.
The modest agenda contrasts with a relatively ambitious set of
pre-election marching orders from Reagan, including passage of
a balanced-budget constitutional amendment, regulatory re
form, "enterprise zones" to help revitalize deteriorating neigh
borhoods, and a new clean air bill as well as appropriations bills.
Even the White House appeared to lower its sights yesterday,
however, as deputy press secretary Larry Speakes said that ap
propriations bills would be the main purpose of the session. Con
gress so far has passed only three of 13 appropriations bills.
Stock trading zooms to new high
New York A late selling wave swept Wall Street yesterday
during the busiest day ever on the New York Stock Exchange,
sending the Dow Jones industrials average into a sharp retreat
from Wednesday's record-shattering performance.
But the overall tally on the Big Board had nine stocks rising in
price for every eight that fell, and 584 issues reached one-year
highs while there were no new lows recorded.
"A lot of fireworks is going on here," said analyst Eldon
Grimm at Birr, Wilson & Co.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks tumbled 15.27
points to 1050.22. A day earlier, the best-known indicator of
stock market performance rose into uncharted territory, soaring
a record 43.41 points to reach an all-time high of 1065.49.

Yesterday's Finish was just below the previous record of
1051.70, reached Jan. 11, 1973.
Deukmejian foresees bipartisan era
Los Angeles Governor-elect George Deukmejian, brim
ming with confidence and with goodwill toward Democrats, said
yesterday he will meet with outgoing Gov. Brown next week on
the transfer of power.
Along with the power goes the responsibility for solving some
serious state problems, the new Republican governor told an
Ambassador Hotel news conference.
He said he would be delighted if Democrat Brown and the
Democrat-controlled Legislature met in special session soon to
grapple with the state's impending budget deficit, rather than
leave it for him when he takes control in January.
All of the comments came from the newly-elected governor
who said he has yet to hear from Mayor Tom Bradley, the Demo
crat he beat in Tuesday's election.
And as for Bradley's talk about a possible recount of the
ballots because Deukmejian's winning margin was only 52,295
out of more than 7.5 million votes cast, the Republican said, "I
have not heard or read about any areas where there are any al
legations about some kind of irregularities, anything signifi
cant."
From Bradley headquarters came word that the election re
sults are being studied and no decision on whether to ask for a
recount will be made until the study is completed. That may not
be until next week, a Bradley aide said.
U.S. votes with Argentina on Falklands
United Nations Despite strong British objections, the Unit
ed States joined the General Assembly majority yesterday in call
ing for Britain and Argentina to renew negotiations on sov
ereignty over the Falkland Islands.
The vote was 90-12 in favor of the non-binding resolution,
sponsored by Argentina and 19 other Latin American countries.
There were 52 abstentions.
No specific time limit was set for resumption of talks on sov
ereignty over the remote South Atlantic archipelago, which Brit
ain reclaimed from Argentine invaders after a 74-day undeclared
war that ended June 14.
U.S. officials said President Reagan personally authorized the
American delegation's "yes" vote in a move toward healing a rift
in Washington's relations with Latin America. They said he felt
the resolution contained no threat to Britain's vital interests.
British Ambassador Sir John Thomson said before the vote
that it was "impossible to accept a call for negotiations as if the
Argentine invasion had never occurred."
Illinois race remains up in the air
Chicago Democratic challenger Adlai Stevenson pulled to
within 171 votes of Republican Gov. James Thompson on yes
terday with more than 3.5 million ballots counted and thousands
still out in a race headed toward one of the closest finishes in Illi
nois history.
The incumbent's margin less than five one-thousandths of 1
percent held after a nearly complete unofficial tally of returns
from the Democratic stronghold of Chicago.
But it appeared that even after the last votes were tabulated,
the nation's only undecided race for governor might remain just
that until the State Board of Elections certifies the vote Nov. 22.
Returns had yet to be reported from 15 precincts in the city,
where five ballot boxes were turned in empty and 10 more were
reported missing, officials said. They estimated that 5000 poten
tial votes were involved. It was not certain when those totals
would be available.
Results also were not expected until this morning for 106 sub
urban Cook County precincts, the county clerk's office said. The
clerk would give no estimate of the number of ballots from those
areas. Thompson had generally run ahead in the suburbs, but it
was not known exactly what areas the missing precincts covered.
FDA describes packaging rules
Washington The Food and Drug Administration yesterday
issued rules that require all non-prescription drugs sold in the
United States to be packaged in tamper-resistant containers.
The new FDA regulation will affect 200,000 to 300,000 sepa
rate products, all of which will have to be manufactured with
tamper-resistant packages in either 90 or 180 days unless a spe
cial exemption is granted.
The regulation allows manufacturers to choose among a varie
ty of acceptable tamper-resistant packages: foil seals under the
cap, shrink-bands around the cap and bottle or "bubble" pack
ages in which plastic is shrunk around the bottle or individual

capsule and then glued to a backing, among others.
Manufacturers will be required to print distinctive designs on
the tamper-resistant material so that it will be easier for con
sumers to detect tampering. Each package must also include a
printed warning that the package is tamper-resistant and should
be examined and not used if there is evidence of tampering.
Secretary of Health and Human Services Richard Schweiker
estimated that the regulation will cost between $2O million and
$4O million, all of which is expected to be passed through to the
consumer in the form of a l-to-2-cent rise in the price of non
prescription drugs. The non-prescription drug industry, whose
own recommendations bear a strong resemblance to the final
regulation, praised the new rules.
The new regulation was written and passed through the bu
reaucracy in less than a month, in response not only to the seven
murders by cyanide-contaminated Tylenol in Chicago, but also
to the wave of copycat poisonings and product tamperings since
that time.
The FDA alone has recorded nearly 300 such incidents, more
than three dozen of them confirmed by FDA investigation.
Many others reported to police or health officials have not been
counted by the FDA.
Reagan's men predict huge deficit
Washington In the clear light of a post-eiection day, Reagan
administration officials now concede the government faces a
tidal wave of red ink that could crest somewhere between $l5O
billion and $2OO billion in fiscal 1984.
Though loath to discuss it before Tuesday's verdict was in,
these officials, still requesting anonymity, admit also that no
solution is in sight. Budget Director David Stockman, limited by
Reagan's insistence that only only non-defense cuts are accep
table, was said to have told an aide that "I don't know what we
are going to do."
Stockman is perplexed, as well, by the president's refusal, at
least for now, to consider higher taxes, sources say.
But the president said, in the wake of election gains by House
Democrats, that he would have to compromise with Congress, as
he did last year in accepting tax increases and modest defense
cuts forced on him by his fellow Republicans. How far he would
go remained unclear.
"We won't compromise on principles of what we absolutely
believe is essential to the recovery," Reagan said Wednesday.
Treasury Secretary Donald Regan told reporters yesterday
"we have learned to compromise" with Democrats, but he said
"I have a closed mind" to canceling next year's scheduled cut in
income tax rates.
Record numbers seek jobless benefits
Washington The number of Americans drawing unemploy
ment benefits climbed to an all-time peak of 4,680,000 in the
week ending Oct. 16, the Department of Labor reported yester
day.
The overall jobless rate last month, which includes those who
are not covered by unemployment compensation, will be an
nounced today. Most analysts expect it to show an increase from
September's 10.1 percent figure.
While the 4,680,000 figure was the highest ever, the rate of job
lessness among workers covered by unemployment insurance
edged up only 0.1 percent to 5.4 percent, still below the record 7
percent rate set in the aftermath of the 1974-75 recession.
At the same time, the number of new claims for jobless pay,
which reflects recent layoffs, fell by 10,000 to 677,000 in the week
ending Oct. 23. This was a decline of 30,000 from the one-week
record of 703,000 established in mid-September.
Talking to reporters before the Department of Labor report
was issued, Secretary of the Treasury Donald Regan said the
main priority of the new Congress should be to "make certain
there is economic recovery because therein lies the solution of the
unemployment problem."
Regan, however, indicated that the administration would not
propose any new job-creation programs next year, saying: "Just
fiscal stimulus or throwing dollars doesn't solve the problem."
Meantime, other economic signals were mixed. Government
reports showed that auto sales were up slightly in late October;
major retailers reported sales declines last month; mortgage in
terest rates edged down and the foreign trade deficit for the third
quarter hit a peak.
Today's weather
