# 'Strider': the difficult life of a piebald gelding
## 
### MARC FAJER 
Theatreworks opened its 14th Winter Festival Friday
night with a moving musical allegory of discrimination
and class relations. St rider, based on a Leo Tolstoy short
story, is about the difficult life of a piebald gelding. The
title role is portrayed brilliantly by Anthony Haney and
fine singing, as well as other good performances, makes
this show worth seeing.
Strider was created by Soviet playwright Mark
Rozokovsky and adapted for the American stage by
Robert Kalfin and Steve Brown, featuring a translation
by Tamara Sunguroff. The music is by Rozokovsky, S.
Vetink and Norman Berman, with English lyrics by
Brown. The show premiered on Broadway in 1979.
Director Robert Kelley has done a fine job staging the
northern California premiere of the play. Carefully han
dled personal moments are carefully interspersed with
the exuberant full chorus numbers. Choreographer Susie
Cashion has worked well with Kelley to present a cast
that can suggest horse movements. This is especially ef
fective in the number, "Song of the Herd," which is about
being part of the group. Musical Director Dawn Horst
has also done impressive work, both with the vocalists
and the well-balanced band. The music is lovely through
out and the lyrics are clearly understandable. "Oh, Mor
tal," an ensemble number at the beginning of the show,
brought tears to my eyes; both the singing and Haney's
performance downstage were beautiful.

It is difficult to find enough good things to say about "
Haney. He manages to display a wide range of emotions
(and a broad variety of ages) onstage while continually
reminding us that he is representing a horse. His first
clumsy steps as a colt and his fascinated pursuit of a but
terfly show childlike innocence, confusion and a joy that
is charming to observe. Similarly, his first romance with
the young filly Viazpurika (Lindy Berman) beautifully

captures shy, awkward adolescence. As Strider ages,
Haney presents us with philosophical despair after he has
been gelded, followed by total joy at winning a race for
his beloved master, Prince Serpuhovsky (Michael
Lederer). He also sings impressively; "Live Long
Enough" ("and sorrow and joy are one") is a powerful
tribute to survival and is a high point of the show because
of Haney's voice and presence, as well as the fine choral
singing behind them.
Stanford undergraduate Barney Stein as Darling, a
show horse and friend of Strider's, is good whether speak*'
ing, singing, dancing or just horsing around. "Darling's
Romance," ("if love's not a science, just that I'm not a
horse") is a very funny, well-performed tribute to sexual
love. Stein and Haney together create the funniest se

quence in the show when they compete to be chosen by
Prince Serpuhovsky. Lederer, as the prince, has some
very good moments, especially when demonstrating the
greed and detachment of the rich. Brent Davis, as Feofan
his servant, is also good. They combine with Haney to
sing "Troika," the first act finale, about the joy of being
in the best dressed carriage in Moscow and the power of
not having to stop for anyone. The choreography here,
and the accompanying snowstorm are clever and beau
tiful.
The show is certainly not perfect. The overture is not
well danced, and the second act is a bit slow, especially
the Prince's long description of his decline. Kelley overin
dulges in sexual sight gags and cheapens the duet between
Strider and Viazapurika unnecessarily. The few flaws dis
appear, however, in the power of the play. This produc
tion does an excellent job of bringing out those problems
that the allegory is supposed to unveil. The use of move
ment and music succeed in creating a very interesting and
often very moving world. William Roberts' set, some
thing like a cross between a stable and a Russian church,
expertly lit by John Rathman, evokes a feeling of fable
which is very appropriate for the story unfolding within
It. ■ ••• • > '"*> * ■V 1 '''-v * "-•■ I
Strider plays at the Lucie Stern Community Center in
Palo Alto Thursday through Saturday, November 4-6
and 11-13 at 8 p.m. Anthony Haney's performance alone
is worth the admission price, and there are many more
good reasons to go.

It is difficult to find enough good
things to say about Anthony Haney.
