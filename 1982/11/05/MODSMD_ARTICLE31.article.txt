Akira Kurosawa on the pop
ularity o/Rashomon:
"Well, you see ... it's
about this rape."

Highly recommended

Dodes'ka-den (197C) ★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Akira Kurosawa set this
serene, lyrical film
among the poor in an un
named city: paralyzed or
muted by their own fear
and hardships, they are
reminiscent of the pipe
dreamers in O'Neill'sT/ie
Iceman Cometh, but the
delicate melancholy with
which he portrays them
suggests Hans Christian
Andersen, and so do the
fairy-tale, finger-painted
art direction and photog
raphy. The dramatis per
sonae include a cuckold
who plays father to all his
whore-wife's kids, a girl
who constructs paper
flowers until she col
lapses from exhaustion, a
thief, an old sage, and —
most memorably — a
poet and his beggar son,
who live in the carcass of
an ancient abandoned
car. Beautifully acted and
directed.
Plays Thursday only
with Rashomon.

Taps
Memorial Auditorium
George C. Scott has never been
worse than here, as General
Bache, a half-cracked old head
master at a military academy who
imbues his students with a pre-
World War I chivalric code of sol
dierly conduct and then gets the
school closed down when he
shoots a rambunctious townie at
a graduation ball. The movie is
directed by Harold Becker and
shot by Owen Roizsman in a
somber tone that indicates it is in
tended to be high art, but it's so
poorly structured that you can't
figure out how you're supposed to
take Bache's teachings, which the
boys revere. With Timothy Hut
ton as the cadet major who leads
the boys to rebel against the clos
ing of the academy.
Plays Sunday evening.

r Citizen Kane (1941) ★
Kresge Auditorium
Orson Welles was only in his
mid-20s when he came to Holly
wood to make this film, but he
had already established himself as
an enfant terrible on Broadway
and on radio. The bristling, vi
brant feeling of the picture is due
in part to the youthfulness of
most of the people who col
laborated on it (only the
screenwriter, Herman Man
kiewicz, had been working in
movies for long) and in part to the
subject: publisher William Ran
dolph Hearst, who was still very
much alive. An extraordinary
movie. With a Mercury Theater
cast: Welles as Kane, Joseph Cot
ten, Dorothy Comingore, Ruth
Warrick, Agnes Moorehead, Ev
erett Sloane. Photographed by
Gregg Toland.
Plays tonight.

Monsignor
Old Mill 6, Mountain View
Early in this Frank Perry pic
ture after a big Italian-Ameri
can wedding out of The God
father, and a sequence in the
trenches of World War 11, in
which the priest hero (Christ
opher Reeve) mows down a
cluster of advancing Nazis we
know that we're not going to be
lieve a word of this movie, and so
it turns out to be quite enjoyable.
Most of it takes place at the Vat
ican: the cast ofcharcters includes
a pair of adversary cardinal bees
who rule this Roman political
honeycomb (Fernando Rey and
Adolfo Celi), a Mafioso (Joe Cor
tese), a Sicilian don (Jason
Miller), a cigar-chomping Boston
bishop (Robert J. Prosky), an am
bitious friar with surveillance
skills (Tomas Milian), and a
young postulant who has an affair
with our priest (Genevieve Bu
jold, who does the only real acting
in the film). Christopher Reeve
doesn't act at all for the first two
thirds of the movie, and then acts
badlv for the rest, but he's un
deniably a star.

Looking for Mr. Goodbar
(1977)
Bishop Auditorium
Richard Brooks adapted Ju
dith Rossner's bestseller to the
screen and directed it in his usual
lurid, high-decibel fashion. Diane
Keaton gives a semi-successful
performance as Theresa Dunn, a
devoted teacher who leads the fa
miliar double life, haunting sin
gles bars at night: Keaton makes
Theresa's enjoyment of sex fully
believable, but she doesn't give
the character sufficient depth.
(Perhaps she would have had to
rewrite the script to pull it off.)
The movie is sort of Freudian and
sort of admonitory about the dan
gers of living the kind of high life
Theresa's addicted to, but it
grows more and more confusing
(and more and more repellent) as
Brooks drives us toward the rape
murder finale. The supporting
cast includes Tuesday Weld and
William Atherton, who have
nothing much to do; Richard
Kiley, Alan Feinstein and Tom
Berenger, who are terrible; and
Richard Gere, who is appealing
and funny in his debut per
formance.
Plays tomorrow night.

Pepe Le Moko (1937) ★
Fox, Redwood City
Many American movie lovers
know the Charles Boyer-Hedy
Lamarr version, released the fol
lowing year and containing scenes
lifted from the original; too few
people have seen Jean Cabin as
the gangster hero trapped in the
Casbah and longing to return to
his beloved Paris. Julien
Duvivier, a superb technician,
directed this magnificent roman
tic drama, co-starring Mireille
Balin, Marcel Dalio and Gaston
Modot.
Plavs Thursday only with
Rim

Lolita (1962) *
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Though it was almost
universally dismissed on
its release as a watering
down of the novel a
novel, incidentally, that
had been reviled in most
quarters on publication
Stanley Kubrick's
black comedy is possibly
his best movie. Vladimir
Nabokov, the author of
the book, did his own
adaptation, retaining a
surprising amount of the
celebrated verbal wit of
the original, and the cast
could hardly have been
better: James Mason as
Humbert Humbert, lover
of nymphets; Shelley

Winters as pretentious,
clinging Charlotte Haze;
and best of all, Peter
Sellers as Clare Quilty.
None of them has ever
surpassed his or her work
in this movie. The film is
overlong and structurally
flawed, and the
cinematography is a little
drab, but this is one of
the best American mov
ies of the '6os. With Sue
Lyon, certainly adequate
as Lolita.
Plays Tuesday and
Wednesday with Being
There.

New Varsity, Palo Alto
"Often men won't
speak the truth even to
themselves," says one of
the characters in Akira
Kurosawa's unforget
table film, and adapt
ing a story by Akugatawa
- he sets out to prove that
v the truth is un -
discoverable. The plot is
devilishly simple: a ban
dit (Toshiro Mifune) robs
a noble (Masayuki Mori)
in the forest and rapes his
wife (Machiko Kyo); the
noble dies at the ban
dit's hands or at his own.
Kurosawa plays out the
story four times, com
municating the per
ception of each of the
major characters and that
of a woodcutter (Takasi
Shimura) who claims to
have witnessed the entire
episode. Machiko Kyo,
later the Lady Macbeth of
Kurosawa's Throne of
Blood, gives a re
markably versatile per
formance.
Plays Thursday only
with Dodes'ka-den.
