Kennedy's visit
Get prepared this weekend so you
can be sure to fire off those questions
when University President Donald
Kennedy saunters into the Daily offices
at Monday's staff lunch. All staffers
should be sure to attend. Refreshments
and fireworks to start at high noon.
Happy hour
Imbibe, imbibe we say. Once more
the Daily offices will host the media
spectacular 3600 seconds of the most
awesome liquid entertainment, for sure.
Staffers, don't forget to show up at 4:30
this afternoon. Bottles provided,
cups optional.
