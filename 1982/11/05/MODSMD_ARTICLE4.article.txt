# Improvements in residential life considered
## 
### KATHERINE HUTT Senior staff writer 
Changes may be forthcoming in the residential
education program here as a result of a soon-to-be
issued faculty senate report.
"We are trying to enhance the intellectual charac
ter of the residences," said Assoc. History Prof.
Kennell Jackson, chairman of the Subcommittee on
Residential Education and Advising, which is re
sponsible for the report.
The subcommittee has targeted several areas of
residential education for improvement. They in
clude the freshman and sophomore years, faculty in
volvement in the residences and the involvement of
different areas of the University in the program.
A fourth issue under discussion by the subcom
mittee is residential education administrative prob
lems. "There are stuctural difficulties," said sub
committee member Diana Paul, assistant professor
of religious stuies.
In addition, the subcommittee will discuss im
provements in theme houses and may discuss
changes in the fraternity system.
The subcommittee, which consists of represent
atives from all areas of the University and three stu
dents, was first formed in spring of 1981. Their re
port, which will be the culmination of five quarters
of discussion, will be finished by the end of this quar
ter, according to Jackson. The subcommittee will
then present it to its parent committee, the Commit
tee on Undergraduate Studies, and then to the facul
ty senate.
Norm Robinson, associate dean of Residential
education, said that in practical terms the major
goal of the subcommittee's efforts, the improvement

of intellectual life in the residences, means "how to
get people interested in and excited about ideas, and
talking about them at dinner."
Methods of improving the freshman and
sophomore years through the residential education
program is one topic being investigated. This subject
includes a discussion of the advantages and disad
vantages of four-class and all-freshmen dorms for
incoming freshmen.
One problem with sophomore year, when advis
ing is not residentially based, according to Bose, is
that students frequently move into Manzanita or
Mirrielees and lose contact with their freshman-year
advisers. To alleviate this problem, she said the sub
committee's goal is to enable students to maintain
contact with these former advisers.
A second topic of concern to the subcommittee is
increased faculty involvement in student residences.
"Part of the Residential Education system is a com
mitment on the part of the faculty to extend the
educational process beyond the classroom," said
Paul.
Paul described two ways of achieving this goal,
both of which are under consideration by the sub
committee. First, he said University President
Donald Kennedy could encourage more faculty
members to become involved in dorm life. Also,
Row Houses could acquire faculty affiliates, who
would have dinner there once a week and coordinate
a house program.
According to Paul, "Residential Education
should get other parts of the University more in
volved (in dorm life) the Humanities Center, visit
ing scholars, feminist studies, new academic pro
grams which have been established."

The new dorms may provide the answer to this
problem. Because they are laid out in wings which
hold 10 or 12 people, they could be used to house
small special interest groups those not large
enough to fill an entire dorm, according to Paul.
In addition to these areas of concern to the sub
committee, Robinson would "like to see students in
the residence halls assuming increased responsibility
for programming, so that the resident assistants
don't have to do everything."
The subcommittee has not discussed fraternities
thus far, according to Paul. However, junior Mitali
Bose, a student member of the subcommittee, said
the issue "may come up later on."
Robinson spoke to a recent meeting of fraternity
presidents about the future of the fraternity system
here, according to Andy Beal, interfraternity coun
cil (IFC) president Andy Beal. "He wasn't going to
anticipate what the faculty senate was going to rule,
but he perceives that there's a potential problem,"
Bealsaid.
Asa result of the considerable increase in Univer
sity housing spaces which the new dorms will pro
vide, Robinson "thinks that it is possible that the
fraternities might have a hard time maintaining cur
rent levels of membership," according to Beal.
Robinson, who is also a subcommittee member,
said in an interview that he had been warning the
fraternities of these concerns "for a long time, ever
since we started talking about new housing." He
added that below-average rush results of fraternities
last spring, were "a basis for concern. Nobody
wants a weak fraternity system."
Changes may be forthcoming in the residential
education program here as a result of a soon-to-be
issued faculty senate report.

One problem with sophomore year, when advis
ing is not residentially based, according to Bose, is
that students frequently move into Manzanita or
Mirrielees and lose contact with their freshman-year
advisers. To alleviate this problem, she said the sub
committee's goal is to enable students to maintain
contact with these former advisers.
A second topic of concern to the subcommittee is
increased faculty involvement in student residences.
"Part of the Residential Education system is a com
mitment on the part of the faculty to extend the
educational process beyond the classroom," said
Paul.
Paul described two ways of achieving this goal,
both of which are under consideration by the sub
committee. First, he said University President
Donald Kennedy could encourage more faculty
members to become involved in dorm life. Also,
Row Houses could acquire faculty affiliates, who
would have dinner there once a week and coordinate
a house program.
According to Paul, "Residential Education
should get other parts of the University more in
volved (in dorm life) the Humanities Center, visit
ing scholars, feminist studies, new academic pro
grams which have been established."

The new dorms may provide the answer to this
problem. Because they are laid out in wings which
hold 10 or 12 people, they could be used to house
small special interest groups those not large
enough to fill an entire dorm, according to Paul.
In addition to these areas of concern to the sub
committee, Robinson would "like to see students in
the residence halls assuming increased responsibility
for programming, so that the resident assistants
don't have to do everything."
The subcommittee has not discussed fraternities
thus far, according to Paul. However, junior Mitali
Bose, a student member of the subcommittee, said
the issue "may come up later on."
Robinson spoke to a recent meeting of fraternity
presidents about the future of the fraternity system
here, according to Andy Beal, interfraternity coun
cil (IFC) president Andy Beal. "He wasn't going to
anticipate what the faculty senate was going to rule,
but he perceives that there's a potential problem,"
Bealsaid.
Asa result of the considerable increase in Univer
sity housing spaces which the new dorms will pro
vide, Robinson "thinks that it is possible that the
fraternities might have a hard time maintaining cur
rent levels of membership," according to Beal.
Robinson, who is also a subcommittee member,
said in an interview that he had been warning the
fraternities of these concerns "for a long time, ever
since we started talking about new housing." He
added that below-average rush results of fraternities
last spring, were "a basis for concern. Nobody
wants a weak fraternity system."
Changes may be forthcoming in the residential
education program here as a result of a soon-to-be
issued faculty senate report.
"We are trying to enhance the intellectual charac
ter of the residences," said Assoc. History Prof.
Kennell Jackson, chairman of the Subcommittee on
Residential Education and Advising, which is re
sponsible for the report.
The subcommittee has targeted several areas of
residential education for improvement. They in
clude the freshman and sophomore years, faculty in
volvement in the residences and the involvement of
different areas of the University in the program.
A fourth issue under discussion by the subcom
mittee is residential education administrative prob
lems. "There are stuctural difficulties," said sub
committee member Diana Paul, assistant professor
of religious stuies.
In addition, the subcommittee will discuss im
provements in theme houses and may discuss
changes in the fraternity system.
The subcommittee, which consists of represent
atives from all areas of the University and three stu
dents, was first formed in spring of 1981. Their re
port, which will be the culmination of five quarters
of discussion, will be finished by the end of this quar
ter, according to Jackson. The subcommittee will
then present it to its parent committee, the Commit
tee on Undergraduate Studies, and then to the facul
ty senate.
Norm Robinson, associate dean of Residential
education, said that in practical terms the major
goal of the subcommittee's efforts, the improvement

of intellectual life in the residences, means "how to
get people interested in and excited about ideas, and
talking about them at dinner."
Methods of improving the freshman and
sophomore years through the residential education
program is one topic being investigated. This subject
includes a discussion of the advantages and disad
vantages of four-class and all-freshmen dorms for
incoming freshmen.
