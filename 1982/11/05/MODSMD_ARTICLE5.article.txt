# Energy specialists proposed as guest profs
## 
### STEVE KAUFMAN Staff Writer 
Two nationally renowned energy
experts may come to Stanford as guest
professors next spring as a result of on
going efforts by a small group of stu
dents here.
Amory and L. Hunter Lovins, the
husband and wife team which founded
the Soft Energy Path movement, are
being considered to teach two courses
on energy policy. The Lovinses have
achieved national fame for their work
on energy policy in renewable energy
sources and have been active in the
Friends of the Earth Foundation.
Civil Engineering Prof. Lyna Wig
gins said the efforts to bring the Lovins
here are going well. "The students are
making a serious effort on this project,
and everyone is following through on
their individual tasks." Wiggins sup
ported the idea of the Lovins' teaching
at Stanford, calling them "good people
for students to see."
Interest in the two energy specialists
originally came from the student group
Stanford for Environmental Educa
tion, but insufficient interest kept the

idea from being carried out.
However, Moose Hydeman, a co-ter
minal student in mechanical engineer
ing sensed the potential benefits of a vis
it from the Lovinses and took over the
project. "I began to talk to my friends
about the idea, and they seemed really
enthusiastic," said Hydeman.
"We approached the Lovinses with
an initial proposal for classes, and they
expressed a lot of interest," he said.
rfThe dozen or so students working on
the project are finalizing a proposal for
the syllabus, course structure and read
ing lists. Currently, the students plan on
the Lovins' teaching one three-unit lec
ture course and one five-unit seminar
class.
"We want to commit them for seven
weeks in the spring," said Paul Helliker,
a graduate student in engineering eco
nomic systems. "We feel that they
would be a great addition to the cam
pus, and hope that they find our pro
posal acceptable." He added that put
ting the final touches on the proposal is
currently the most important concern
of the group.

Project volunteers see involving stu
dents with many different interests as
an important priority. To accomplish
this, the courses would be offered
through the Undergraduate Special
Programs department, which would al
low them to be cross-listed with many
different majors.
"We want to generate broad-based
support for the ideas which the Lov
inses will present," said Hydeman. "If
we can attract a variety of majors, these

courses could unify some of the diverse
interests on campus."
The Lovinses, who are currently oh a
lecture tour, will meet with members of
the group on Nov. 11 to discuss the pro
posal and hammer out any remaining
details. "We will have a good feeling for
the class and what remains to be done
after the meeting," Hydeman said. He
added that details concerning guest lec
tures, outside talks and other ap
pearances still needed to be discussed.
