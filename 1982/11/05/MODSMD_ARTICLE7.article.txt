# Funding stalls Mexico campus plans
## 
### STEVETROUSDALE Staff writer 
Budgetary problems have forced the
Overseas Studies Office (OSO) to post
pone plans for a campus in Mexico
City, despite interest by both students
and University officials in establishing
a campus there.
The OSO prepared a proposal on a
campus in Mexico City in the late '7os,
but abandoned this effort because of a
50 percent cut in its budget, according
to Patricia Clark, associate director for
finance of the overseas office.

Furthermore, there are no current
proposals for a campus there, said
Michael Jackson, the assistant director

of the OSO. He said the Academic Pro
gram Committee (APC), which in
vestigates future sites for campuses
abroad, was looking into expanding the
University's overseas program, but he
added that "no proposal (is) before the
APC looking at a program in Mexico
City or anywhere."
He said his office was also looking at
the prospect of another campus, most
likely in the Third World, but that no
specific site had been chosen.
However, Daryl Sawyer, the assis
tant to the director of the OSO, said the
proposal for a campus in Mexico City
was a priority for her office, despite the
budgetary constraints.

Despite these setbacks for the pro
posed campus, there has been interest
expressed by various students for such a
program. ASSU Senator Jerry
Wertheim has co-sponsored a resolu
tion which states that "the ASSU sup
ports the Overseas Studies Office in its
efforts to create a Stanford-in-Mexico
program." The resolution offers the re
sources of the ASSU to help the OSO in
its efforts to create such a campus.
He said that "I think ASSU resources
would be used in keeping the heat on
them (the University)" in the quest for
the campus.
When told that there was no work
being done on the Mexico City campus
because of budgetary constraints,
Wertheim said, "I don't think there's
any excuse for lack of funding" be
cause, he said, "1 think a program in
Mexico City is more justifiable than a
program anywhere else" due to the
University's emphasis on Latin Ameri
can studies in various departments,
such as History.
In reference to Wertheim and Gradu
ate Senator Erik Thompson's ASSU
resolution, Jackson said "some
have gotten the cart before the horse."
