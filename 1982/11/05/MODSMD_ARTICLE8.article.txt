## One-fourth of students stop out 
### KAREN SPRINGEN 
Stopping out. The connota
tions are negative for parents
who fear their children are
"dropping out" and positive for
most students.
In fact, about 24 percent of the
students here stop out for at least
one quarter, according to Dean
Namboothiri, statistical analyst
of the registrar's office.
Yet the University boasts an 87
percent "survival rate," which
means that the vast majority of
students graduate within a seven
year time span, Registrar Sally
Mahoney said. "Stopping out is
not related to dropping out," she
added.
Students stop out, usually for
one quarter, to explore pre-pro
fessional work experience, to
travel overseas, to clarify goals or
to earn money, Mahoney said.
Other positive consequences of
stopping out include gaining
further appreciation of the Uni
versity and increased self-con
fidence and maturity. However,
stopping out may result in
boredom, lack of a fulfilling job,
lessened study skills and failure
to resolve important questions.
Stopping out is a simple pro

cedure because the University
does not require students to re
ceive any academic permission.
"It's so easy to get in and go out,"
said third-year sophomore Jim
my Kimzey. Senior David
Dodson explained, "You just
don't register."
The University, which imposes
no time limit, does not necessar
ily encourage stopping out.
"What we don't do is discourage
it," said Mahoney.
Several counseling and advis
ing programs are available; there
are advisers in the Office of the
Dean of Student Affairs and in
the Cowell's Counseling and Psy

etiological Services office. And
the Career Planning and Place
ment Center (CPPC) offers stop
ping-out counseling in addition
to a resource guide, Stopping
Out: What For and How To.
Students expressed different
motives behind their decisions to
take time off from the standard
academic terms.
Kimzey, who stopped out last
year, said, "It's a good idea as far
as clarifying your goals and ob
jectives." But he said, "I was
bored to death because I was at
home with this boring, nowhere
job (selling auto parts). The
whole time I was out I wanted to
be back at Stanford."
Third-year sophomore Mike
Collev stopped out for two quar
ters and gave guitar lessons. "I
was not motivated 1 percent aca
demically," he said. "I figured I
wasn't doing myself any good.
One day it just hit me I ought to
stop out ... I really thought
about it for a long time."
Dennis Ryan, who will be a
fourth-year junior next year, is
working full-time as an IBM pro
grammer this year. He is stop
ping out to earn money, ex
perience and financial independ

ence.
Ryan stopped out for the first
time last fall, when he worked as
a carpenter s assistant because of
lack of motivation. This year he
would not have stopped out
without a good job.
"I didn't really speak to any
one at all. I just didn't go," Ryan
said. "My parents don't under
stand the concept of stopping
out," he added.
Fourth-year senior Jane West,
who stopped out winter quarter
to work in Vail, Colorado, also
found that stopping out "wasn't
endorsed by anybody at home."
She recommended stopping out
for a whole year, however, since
"winter quarter is disruptive."
The University environment
tended to be all theory and no
practice, West added.
Fourth-year senior Jordan
Bender, who plans to graduate in
June, is working for an invest
ment banking firm. "My job
basically made me decide to stop
out . . . it's my future," Bender
said.
"If anyone needs a broker, tell
them to give me a call!" Bender
added.
Dodson stopped out last win
ter after spending fall quarter in
Cliveden. "At the end of my
sophomore year, I just didn't feel
that I was getting my money's
worth here," he said.

Dodson traveled to Israel and
Egypt in December and worked
in England three months. "Col
lege Isn't something you have to
do in four years," Dodson said.
"You just sort of get on the social
treadmill."
Fifth-year senior Justin
Roach, who is working with a
real estate developer, said, "I've
further focused my goals ... I
will have that work expedience.
Last spring there was no way
I'd have been ready to hop out
into the big bright world and find
a job ... I was going through the
motions on campus."
Fifth-year senior Pete Frost
stopped out two years ago to
work for John Anderson's presi
dential campaign. "I stopped out
because the opportunity arose,"
he said. "Financially I regret it
but not in any other way."

Fields in which students have
worked while stopped out in
clude computer, programming,
factory work, public relations,
government, clerical, land
scaping, teaching, house
painting, roofing, hospital work,
bartending and farm labor.

Students also stop out to
travel, take courses, work over
seas and campaign.
