# Arizona's Hunley wants a repeat performance
## 
### PETER CASTILLO 
One of the major causes in the
Cardinal's loss to the University
of Arizona last year was the out
standing performance of then
sophomore Ricky Hunley. When
all the totals were added up at the
end of the game, Hunley had
sacked John Elway once, assisted
in four tackles and made 11 un
assisted tackles in one of his best
games all year.
Hunley is a 6-foot-1 junior
hailing from Roanoke, Virginia
who led the Wildcat defense in
total tackles (121) from his inside

linebacker position. He was
named outstanding Wildcat de
fensive player, named to the
Pac-10 first team, made hon
orable lhention in The As
sociative Press All-American
team and was chosen to be pre
season All-America in Septem
ber's Playboy poll. With all these
honors it would be expected that
there would be a lot of pressure
on Hunley, but he has not let it
bother him.
"Sure, there is some pressure
to perform well since I am ex
pected now to play well in each

game. But, I do not let it get to me
and I do not put pressure on my
self, except to play my best. Also,
if the whole team plays well it
only makes me look better."
Last year Arizona was able to
contain Elway to only 152 yards
and he was only 14 of 34, but
Hunley admits things might be
different if Stanford can establish
a ground game.
"If the Cards establish a good
running game early it will make it
tough on us, for it will only allow
Elway more time to pass,"
Hunley explained. "For the team

to do well we will have to shut off
the ground game, unlike Wash
ington, so we can put pressure on
John. Still, we can not afford to
neglect either in trying to stop
one for each can hurt us."

Hunley, of course, is an impor
tant Fixture in the Wildcat de
fense, but considers himself only
one part of an 11-man team that
must get on the Field to perform
well and to make the important
plays. He characterized the de
fense as vastly improved over last
year and this has allowed the of
fense to score more as they are
able to stop their opponents in
three plays each series more often
and let the offense in.
Though there has been a few
ups and down, Hunley has
played consistently in each game
to the expectations of his critics.
Hunley summed up the season so
far.
"So far I have had a good sea
son and am where I would like to

be in my development," he said.
"I try to play at a steady pace
throughout the game and be ag
gressive on the field. Right now I
feel really good about myself and
the team."
This could spell trouble for the
Cards as Hunley is coming off
one of his best games last week
against Washington State. He
felt that the "real me" came out,
and he was more aggressive,
working off the blocks better and
ultimately making more tackes
and a destructive force against
the Cougars.
"Right now the team's attitude
is very positive," comments
Hunley. "Also, any team in the
Pac-10 could knock off another
on any weekend, so this game
should be really interesting."
Considering last week's upset
over Washington, Arizona and
the Wildcat defense, led by
number 89 Hunley, should be a
formidable opponent.
