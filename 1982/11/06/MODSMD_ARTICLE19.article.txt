# CT's Guest Greek of the Week
## Hargadon accepted as Greek God 
### 
Guest Week is a weekly feature
of Cardinal Today in which a
highly selected group of outstand
ing individuals get to put their pre
dictive powers on the line in front
of some 80,000 people.
This week's Guest Greek is
Dean of Admissions Fred
Hargadon. Hargadon's quali
fications for Guest Greek cannot
be questioned. Any Stanford stu
dent will tell you that he is witty,
highly intelligent, and most of all,
has an uncanny ability to make
the right decision. Hargadon's

qualifications, however, extend
beyond his intellect. He has a fol
lowing on campus that would
make any Greek god jealous.
Hargadon has no questions
about who will win the Cal-USC
game. The Trojan horse is hun
gry and Hargadon feels that USC
will breeze to a 42-14 win. He ex
plains the pick:
"It's one thing to lose to a fel
low probationer," Hargadon
said. "But it's a real no-no for
USC to even thipk of losing to
any university in Northern Cali

fornia, where they have both li
braries and football teams.
Besides, they haven't been fed
this week."
In the Stanford-Arizona game,
Hargadon predicts Stanford will
win 34-14 and leaves no doubt
who he feels has the No. 1 team.
"(Stanford will win) partly be
cause a great group of seniors ap
pear in Stanford Stadium for the
last time and they'll want us to
know that. And partly because,
according to my poll, Stanford's
the best team in the country."
