# Bergren tops in his clash

### DAVE DUTCHER 
A brief look at John Bergren in
the Stanford Cardinal football
press guideshows one number
that is hard to overlook a 3.9
grade point average.
Bergren, a 6-foot-5, 240 pound
junior, will start at left defensive
tackle for the Cardinal today
against Arizona.
Indeed, the press guide has an
advantage over Bergren in that it
claims to know his grade point
average. Bergren himself does
not know his exact GPA and in
talking to him, one gets the im
pression that merely achieving
good grades and a high GPA are
not the most important facet of
Bergren's academic endeavors.
"Three point nine could be
right," Bergren said. "That fig
ure might be a little high, but I
haven't checked lately. That
might sound a little funny, but I
usually have a pretty good idea of
what grade I'm getting in a class.
"Actually I grade myself as to
what 1 learn in a class it's more
of an afterview," he continued.
"I guess I should check it out,"
Bergren bashfully admitted.
Aside from learning, surpris
ingly, that Bergren does not
know his exact grade point aver
age, Bergren is as serious about
learning as he is about playing
football. A college football
player has to be serious about the
studying aspect of college to be
named to the Academic All-
American first team, as Bergren
was last vear.

"It's an honor to me but I
don't think I'd put it on a pedes
tal like being named captain or
most valuable player," he said.
"It (the award) just kind of
popped out of the blue."
Despite being named as a
member of the elite collection of
student-athletes, Bergren feels
there are others, on the Stanford
team alone, deserving of the rec
ognition.

"I don't know if I look at being
named Academic All-America as
being set apart from others.

There are a lot of good students
on the team," he said, adding
with a grin, "but it (the award) is
a good source of jokes on the
field when I've done something
wrong."

Bergren becomes even more
serious when speaking of this
year's team and feels that the suc
cess the Cardinal has enjoyed, a
5-3 overall record and a 3-2
Pac-10 log, has been due in a
large part to the coaching staff.
"The coaching staff has been
one unit for three years," Bergren
said. "When I came in as a
freshman the seniors had had
four staffs by then. A big factor is
solidarity; it's more of a team
feeling now. We've had good tal
ent this year, not necessarily
more than we've had before, but
we're together as a team."
Bergren is from South Bend,
Ind. and to college football fans
that particular place means one
thing: Notre Dame.
"I grew up under the Golden
Dome," Bergren admitted. "But
in high school I never thought I
would play college football.
"In December of my senior
year in high school I went to
Notre Dame as One of my recruit
ing trips and at first I was swept
over by the football tradition
there that's their recruiting
philosophy."

Bergren called himself
"smart" in not committing to a
school early in his senior year and
went on other trips, and Palo
Alto was one place on his itiner
ary.
"I liked the Stanford at
mosphere. I got the feeling that I
could fit in here and I think Stan
ford has been particularly good
for me."
Bergren feels that for one who
strives for excellence on the
playing field as well as in the
classroom, Stanford is the ideal
place to pursue those interests.
"1 like the idea of academics
and athletics here," he said. "The
whole idea of a scholarship is just
that scholarship. I think the

idea in general has been dis
torted," Bergren added, referring
to the number of football pro
grams being caught for academic
and recruiting violations.
"The whole recruiting thing is
hard for naive seniors," Bergren
said. "It's good to have advice. I
didn't, and the whole situation
tore at me some."

Last season Bergren ranked
fifth in tackles with 60. Against
UCLA, in a 26-23 upset win for
the Cardinal, he logged two
sacks, eight tackles and a blocked
field goal. Other stellar efforts in
cluded Purdue (nine tackles), San
Jose State (seven tackles, two
fumbles caused and one sack)
and Ohio State, where Bergren
contributed eight tackles and a
sack.
In his first game, as a freshman
at Stanford in 1980, Bergren suf
fered a hairline fracture in one
foot. He then rebounded from
the injury and earned a starting
job for the year's final two games
against USC and Cal. He com-

season.
Bergren is a chemical engineer
ing major, and he is also hoping
to complete the biology core re
quirements. Working on both
biology and chemical engineer
ing will probably take Five years
total, Bergren admitted, adding
that he is still not sure about what
he wants to pursue after complet
ing his education.
"Marine biology and oceano
graphy are kind of down the
line," he said, "but it's hard to
say what I'll be doing in three
years, which is when I'll be
done."

Bergren made the All-State
First Team his senior year at
John Adams High School. His
junior season achievements in
cluded being named to All-State
Honorable Mention, All-Metro
and All-Conference teams. But,
despite the awards and recogni
tion he has received, Bergren has
his own idea of accomplishment.
"What I consider great
achievement is someone who has
pushed themselves to their limits
and has achieved things they
thought they couldn't do. I re
spect that kind of person."

A brief look at John Bergren in
the Stanford Cardinal football
press guideshows one number
that is hard to overlook a 3.9
grade point average.
Bergren, a 6-foot-5, 240 pound
junior, will start at left defensive
tackle for the Cardinal today
against Arizona.
Indeed, the press guide has an
advantage over Bergren in that it
claims to know his grade point
average. Bergren himself does
not know his exact GPA and in
talking to him, one gets the im
pression that merely achieving
good grades and a high GPA are
not the most important facet of
Bergren's academic endeavors.
"Three point nine could be
right," Bergren said. "That fig
ure might be a little high, but I
haven't checked lately. That
might sound a little funny, but I
usually have a pretty good idea of
what grade I'm getting in a class.
"Actually I grade myself as to
what 1 learn in a class it's more
of an afterview," he continued.
"I guess I should check it out,"
Bergren bashfully admitted.
Aside from learning, surpris
ingly, that Bergren does not
know his exact grade point aver
age, Bergren is as serious about
learning as he is about playing
football. A college football
player has to be serious about the
studying aspect of college to be
named to the Academic All-
American first team, as Bergren
was last vear.

"It's an honor to me but I
don't think I'd put it on a pedes
tal like being named captain or
most valuable player," he said.
"It (the award) just kind of
popped out of the blue."
Despite being named as a
member of the elite collection of
student-athletes, Bergren feels
there are others, on the Stanford
team alone, deserving of the rec
ognition.

"I don't know if I look at being
named Academic All-America as
being set apart from others.

There are a lot of good students
on the team," he said, adding
with a grin, "but it (the award) is
a good source of jokes on the
field when I've done something
wrong."

Bergren becomes even more
serious when speaking of this
year's team and feels that the suc
cess the Cardinal has enjoyed, a
5-3 overall record and a 3-2
Pac-10 log, has been due in a
large part to the coaching staff.
"The coaching staff has been
one unit for three years," Bergren
said. "When I came in as a
freshman the seniors had had
four staffs by then. A big factor is
solidarity; it's more of a team
feeling now. We've had good tal
ent this year, not necessarily
more than we've had before, but
we're together as a team."
Bergren is from South Bend,
Ind. and to college football fans
that particular place means one
thing: Notre Dame.
"I grew up under the Golden
Dome," Bergren admitted. "But
in high school I never thought I
would play college football.
"In December of my senior
year in high school I went to
Notre Dame as One of my recruit
ing trips and at first I was swept
over by the football tradition
there that's their recruiting
philosophy."

Bergren called himself
"smart" in not committing to a
school early in his senior year and
went on other trips, and Palo
Alto was one place on his itiner
ary.
"I liked the Stanford at
mosphere. I got the feeling that I
could fit in here and I think Stan
ford has been particularly good
for me."
Bergren feels that for one who
strives for excellence on the
playing field as well as in the
classroom, Stanford is the ideal
place to pursue those interests.
"1 like the idea of academics
and athletics here," he said. "The
whole idea of a scholarship is just
that scholarship. I think the

idea in general has been dis
torted," Bergren added, referring
to the number of football pro
grams being caught for academic
and recruiting violations.
"The whole recruiting thing is
hard for naive seniors," Bergren
said. "It's good to have advice. I
didn't, and the whole situation
tore at me some."

Last season Bergren ranked
fifth in tackles with 60. Against
UCLA, in a 26-23 upset win for
the Cardinal, he logged two
sacks, eight tackles and a blocked
field goal. Other stellar efforts in
cluded Purdue (nine tackles), San
Jose State (seven tackles, two
fumbles caused and one sack)
and Ohio State, where Bergren
contributed eight tackles and a
sack.
In his first game, as a freshman
at Stanford in 1980, Bergren suf
fered a hairline fracture in one
foot. He then rebounded from
the injury and earned a starting
job for the year's final two games
against USC and Cal. He com-

Bergren is a chemical engineer

that he is still not sure about what
he wants to pursue after complet
