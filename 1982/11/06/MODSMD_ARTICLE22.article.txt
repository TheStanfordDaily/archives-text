# Park gets psyched for Cardinal's fill-in role
## 
### PETER CASTILLO 
In Stanford's first sustained
drive against Washington last
week both regular fullbacks,
Greg Hooper and Rob Moore,
were injured and taken out for
the rest of the game. Coach Wig

gin then called in little-used
sophomore Kaulana Park.
After shaking off some early
butterflies, Park became an im
portant part of the Cardinal of--
fense by providing important
blocks and keeping the defense
away from John Elway.

"I was a little nervous because
I was not expecting to play," said
Park. "So, I had to get psyched
up and once inthe game started, I
tried to do the best job I could."
An all-state fullback at
Kamehameha High School in
Hawaii, the 6-foot-3, 220 pound
Park has not been used to sitting
on the bench. On the bench,
though, Park has tried to learn
from Hooper and Moore during
the games the good things they
do and to apply them when
ever he would enter a game.
He has not been called upon
much in the past two years. He
was only in seven plays last year
and a few early this year, but
when called upon Park was
ready. The most visible play he
took part in was the 46-yard run
bv Mike Dotterer. He made a
block on the Washington safety
that freed Dotterer.
"The Dotterer run was a com
plete team effort for each person

did their job," Park said. At the
time of the block I was only con
cerned about doing my job.
When Mike entered the end zone
it was a great feeling because all
of us had done a good job in
freeing Mike."
At first it was hard for Park to
get into the flow of the game, but
relying on what he had learned in
practice, he improved on each
plav. Throughout the game he
tried to play harder on each play
and though he only gathered 25
yards in nine carries, he was not
discouraged.
As the game progressed, Park
sensed the growing optimism and
excitement on the sidelines and in
the stands. This excitement car
ried to the field as he got more
psyched as the game progressed.
At the end of the game there was
elation, but also looking forward
to next week against Arizona.
With Moore out for the rest of
the year with a knee injury Park

can expect to be playing in the
weeks to come. "Against Arizo
na I will try to do my best and to
plav better in this game than I did
last week against Washington. It
will be a little easier this week be
cause I have the experience from
last week's game and with
Hooper hopefully playing, he
will take some of the pressure off
mv shoulders."

In many of the major news
papers, Park's name has been ap
pearing and to any player the ad
ditional attention is flattering.
Park put it into perspective
saying, "The victory was a team
effort and in that sense all the
players should be mentioned that
helped contribute to the win. Of
course, it is a little strange be
cause I am not used to it."
Park is a civil engineering ma
jor. He is not worrying about
next year, and what is in his mind
now is the Arizona game and
midterms.
