# Stanford aims for post season bid today
## 
### ADAM BERNS 
Two giant killers meet on the
farm today and both desperately
need victories to keep their bowl
hopes alive.
Stanford (5-3, 3-2 conference)
and Arizona (4-2-1, 2-1-1) have
both logged impressive upsets
this year and are in the thick of
the bowl picture. Arizona's rec
ord includes an upset over Notre
Dame and a tie with No. 9 ranked
UCLA while Stanford has upset
then No. 11 Ohio State and last
week knocked off No. 1 Wash
ington.

"These are two team struggl
ing to reach some dignity," Stan
ford coach Paul Wiggin said. "I
think its going to be a hard
fought game. We want to win be
cause its important to our players
and our program."
Coming off the Washington
victory and with the game against
UCLA coming up next week, the
Cardinal can not afford to look
past Arizona, although Wiggin
admits that being as up as
the team was last week will be dif
ficult.
"We'll try to eliminate all the
wonderfulness that goes with this
kind of victory," Wiggin said
about last week's game. "We
need to give our total focus
towards our next opponent now.
"This is not a cocky group of
kids," Wiggin added. "What
they see right now is Arizona.
They seem to know that the one
at a time direction that has to
be."

Looking past the Wildcats
would be a big mistake. Al
though Arizona started slowly,
they 3 been on a roll the past
couple of weeks especially on
the road where the Wildcats
have chalked up all their big up
sets.
"Arizona was a team that peo
ple rated ahead of us in the pre

season polls," Wiggin said. "But
even after they tied UCLA
(24-24) and beat Norte Dame this
year, they were still called
spoilers. Well, I think what was
once considered spoilers is now
just an outstanding football
team.

"Arizona was a team that had
some problems early and the de
fense carried them through, but
lately the offense has been going
along real well."
Arizona coach Larry Smith
feels that his teams turnabout
came following its one week
break after the lowa game and
before UCLA.
"We went back and worked on
fundamentals," he said. "We got
back together as a team. Some
times you can use a week off to
get things back together."
Lately the Arizona offense, led
bv quarterback Tom Tunnicliffe,
has been amassing some im
pressive statistics as the Wildcats
are outscoring their opponents
by almost 12 points a game. Two
weeks ago Tunnicliffe was named
Pacific-10 offensive player of the
week for a 21 of 27 performance
against Pacific which amassed
427 yards and six touchdowns.
The Arizona offense also fea
tures wide receiver Brad An
derson (34 receptions, 610 yards),
tailback Vance Johnson (231
yards, 60 carries), and fullback
Courtney Griffin (323 yards, 71
carries).
"Their offense is much more
pass oriented than in past years,"
Wiggin said about the Wildcats
diverse offensive scheme. "The
key for their running game is the
perimeter. Basically it is the USC
type of sweep. They have a guy
named Vance Johnson who has a
little bit of Darrin (Nelson) in
him."
From a defensive standpoint,
Arizona has also been playing

better. It is led by preseason All-
America inside linebacker Ricky
Hunlev and what Wiggin calls a
fairly .quick secondary.
"They play a three deep basic
secondary," Wiggin explained.
Then they do some bizarre things
up front. They work in packages
of things on the defensive line but
they don't bring in eight guys like
Arizona State does."
Last year Arizona was able to
pretty much shut Stanford quar
terback John Elway down. He
only connected on 14 of 34 passes
for 152 yards and one touchdown
in the Stanford loss. But Arizona
coach Smith is not real confident
about the prospects of shutting
down Elway again.
"Two years ago I felt that he
was the best college quarterback
in the game today, maybe ever,"
Smith said. "He had a tremen
dous arm. It was just like a torna
do coming down. He can turn a
football game around so quick
ly."
The Stanford offense has
added some diversity of its own.
After finding a running game
with Mike Dotterer at Washing
ton State, the Cardinal came
back to Stanford Stadium and
showed it off to its home fans.
Dotterer had his second 100 yard
game as the Cardinal ran with
success against the tough Wash
ington defense.
With the return to health of
running back Vincent White, the
Cardinal may use its so-called jet
back backfield of White and Dot
terer.
Injuries last week to starting
fullbacks Rob Moore (torn knee
ligaments) and Greg Hooper
(pinched nerve), causes some
problems at the fullback posi
tion. Although Hooper is ex
pected to return this week,
Moore will be out for the rest of

White returned a punt 73 yards last week to spark the
Cardinal's upset over No. 1 Washington. White, who has been
recovering from a shoulder injury, should be close to 100 percent
this week.
the season. Sophomore Kaulana
Park filled in admirably last week
and is expected to split time with
Hooper today.
The Stanford passing game
also got rolling after a
several week slump. Elway con
nected on 20 of 30 passes for 265
yards and two touchdowns, but
most importantly avoided the big
sacks which have been hurting
the team earlier in the year.
Tight end Chris Dressel played
his best game, in an outstanding
and surprising season, '
catching six passes for over 100
yards, bringing his season total to
33 catches for 464 yards.

"Chris Dressel had the best
game he's ever played," Wiggin
said about his performance last
week. "1 don't know whether I've
seen a better performance."
Besides catching passes,
Dressel made several key blocks
to open up the Cardinal running
game.
In general, Wiggin was pleased
with the performance of the of
fensive line, both its pass and run
blocking.
"I think a couple of guys grew
up," Wiggin said. "I think Mike
Teeuws did an outstanding job.
Chris Rose was excellent and so
were the rest of the people up
front."

On defense, the Cardinal sec
ondary has been outstanding.
Leading the conference in air
piracy with 19 interceptions,
Stanford will face a quarterback
in Tunnicliffe, who has not
thrown an interception in four
games (119 attempts).
"Defensively the key to our
success have been the turnovers,"
Stanford cornerback Kevin
Baird, who intercepted a key pass
last week explained. "That's
something we didn't do last
year."
Sophomore outside linebacker
Garin Veris has been a domi
nating force on the Cardinal de
fense. Chosen as the defensive

player of the game against Wash
ington, the 6-foot-6, 250
pounder, had 14 tackles, includ
ing four sacks for 33 yards in
losses.
"There couldn't have been a
better game played by anyone in
the Pac-10 last weekend," Wig
gin said about Veris' per
formance. "He's simply a great
player. And great players make
great plays."
A pass rush will be important
today because Tunnicliffe is the
type of quarterback who will
burn any defense if he has time.
Baird feels that Tunnicliffe's only
weakness is throwing under pres
sure and he thinks that a good

pass rush will be important.
"Tunnicliffe moves well in the
pocket," Baird said, "but he
doesn't move around all that
well."
In the kicking department, Ar
izona features the Pac-10's lead
ing punter in Craig Schiller who
boasts a 43.9 yard average. Wild
cat field goal kicker Max Zende
jas also rates among the top top
in the conference, connecting on
11 of 17 field goals and 23 of 23
PATs. Cardinal clips
Stanford chances of appearing
in a post season bowl appear
quite good. The Sun Bowl
scouted last week's game and if
the Cardinal wins two of its last
three games, it will probably be

invited to either the Sun or Blue
bonnet Bowl. If Stanford wins its
remaining three games, it stands
a chance of going to the Fiesta
Bowl on New Years Day.
Elwav will probably break
seveal records today. He needs
only 20 more competions to
break the all-time NCAA career
mark of 717 set by Mark
Hermann of Purdue. He should
also break the Pac-10 career of
fense mark, needing only 26 more
yards to break Jim Plunkett's rec
ord. Last week, Elway broke the
Pac-10 career mark for most
plays total offense with 1372.

better. It is led by preseason All-
America inside linebacker Ricky
Hunlev and what Wiggin calls a
fairly .quick secondary.
"They play a three deep basic
secondary," Wiggin explained.
Then they do some bizarre things
up front. They work in packages
of things on the defensive line but
they don't bring in eight guys like
Arizona State does."
Last year Arizona was able to
pretty much shut Stanford quar
terback John Elway down. He
only connected on 14 of 34 passes
for 152 yards and one touchdown
in the Stanford loss. But Arizona
coach Smith is not real confident
about the prospects of shutting
down Elway again.
"Two years ago I felt that he
was the best college quarterback
in the game today, maybe ever,"
Smith said. "He had a tremen
dous arm. It was just like a torna
do coming down. He can turn a
football game around so quick
ly."
The Stanford offense has
added some diversity of its own.
After finding a running game
with Mike Dotterer at Washing
ton State, the Cardinal came
back to Stanford Stadium and
showed it off to its home fans.
Dotterer had his second 100 yard
game as the Cardinal ran with
success against the tough Wash
ington defense.
With the return to health of
running back Vincent White, the
Cardinal may use its so-called jet
back backfield of White and Dot
terer.

fullbacks Rob Moore (torn knee
ligaments) and Greg Hooper
(pinched nerve), causes some

the season. Sophomore Kaulana
Park filled in admirably last week
and is expected to split time with
Hooper today.
The Stanford passing game
also got rolling after a
several week slump. Elway con
nected on 20 of 30 passes for 265
yards and two touchdowns, but
most importantly avoided the big
sacks which have been hurting
the team earlier in the year.
Tight end Chris Dressel played
his best game, in an outstanding
and surprising season, '
catching six passes for over 100
yards, bringing his season total to
33 catches for 464 yards.

"Chris Dressel had the best
game he's ever played," Wiggin
said about his performance last
week. "1 don't know whether I've
seen a better performance."
Besides catching passes,
Dressel made several key blocks
to open up the Cardinal running
game.
In general, Wiggin was pleased
with the performance of the of
fensive line, both its pass and run
blocking.
"I think a couple of guys grew
up," Wiggin said. "I think Mike
Teeuws did an outstanding job.
Chris Rose was excellent and so
were the rest of the people up
front."

On defense, the Cardinal sec
ondary has been outstanding.
Leading the conference in air
piracy with 19 interceptions,
Stanford will face a quarterback
in Tunnicliffe, who has not
thrown an interception in four
games (119 attempts).
"Defensively the key to our
success have been the turnovers,"
Stanford cornerback Kevin
Baird, who intercepted a key pass
last week explained. "That's
something we didn't do last
year."
Sophomore outside linebacker
Garin Veris has been a domi
nating force on the Cardinal de
fense. Chosen as the defensive

player of the game against Wash
ington, the 6-foot-6, 250
pounder, had 14 tackles, includ
ing four sacks for 33 yards in
losses.
"There couldn't have been a
better game played by anyone in
the Pac-10 last weekend," Wig
gin said about Veris' per
formance. "He's simply a great
player. And great players make
great plays."
A pass rush will be important
today because Tunnicliffe is the
type of quarterback who will
burn any defense if he has time.
Baird feels that Tunnicliffe's only
weakness is throwing under pres
sure and he thinks that a good

pass rush will be important.
"Tunnicliffe moves well in the
pocket," Baird said, "but he
doesn't move around all that
well."
In the kicking department, Ar
izona features the Pac-10's lead
ing punter in Craig Schiller who
boasts a 43.9 yard average. Wild
cat field goal kicker Max Zende
jas also rates among the top top
in the conference, connecting on
11 of 17 field goals and 23 of 23
PATs. Cardinal clips
Stanford chances of appearing
in a post season bowl appear
quite good. The Sun Bowl
scouted last week's game and if
the Cardinal wins two of its last
three games, it will probably be

invited to either the Sun or Blue
bonnet Bowl. If Stanford wins its
remaining three games, it stands
a chance of going to the Fiesta
Bowl on New Years Day.
Elwav will probably break
seveal records today. He needs
only 20 more competions to
break the all-time NCAA career
mark of 717 set by Mark
Hermann of Purdue. He should
also break the Pac-10 career of
fense mark, needing only 26 more
yards to break Jim Plunkett's rec
ord. Last week, Elway broke the
Pac-10 career mark for most
plays total offense with 1372.
Two giant killers meet on the
farm today and both desperately
need victories to keep their bowl
hopes alive.
Stanford (5-3, 3-2 conference)
and Arizona (4-2-1, 2-1-1) have
both logged impressive upsets
this year and are in the thick of
the bowl picture. Arizona's rec
ord includes an upset over Notre
Dame and a tie with No. 9 ranked
UCLA while Stanford has upset
then No. 11 Ohio State and last
week knocked off No. 1 Wash
ington.

"These are two team struggl
ing to reach some dignity," Stan
ford coach Paul Wiggin said. "I
think its going to be a hard
fought game. We want to win be
cause its important to our players
and our program."
Coming off the Washington
victory and with the game against
UCLA coming up next week, the
Cardinal can not afford to look
past Arizona, although Wiggin
admits that being as up as
the team was last week will be dif
ficult.
"We'll try to eliminate all the
wonderfulness that goes with this
kind of victory," Wiggin said
about last week's game. "We
need to give our total focus
towards our next opponent now.
"This is not a cocky group of
kids," Wiggin added. "What
they see right now is Arizona.
They seem to know that the one
at a time direction that has to
be."

Looking past the Wildcats
would be a big mistake. Al
though Arizona started slowly,
they 3 been on a roll the past
couple of weeks especially on
the road where the Wildcats
have chalked up all their big up
sets.
"Arizona was a team that peo
ple rated ahead of us in the pre

season polls," Wiggin said. "But
even after they tied UCLA
(24-24) and beat Norte Dame this
year, they were still called
spoilers. Well, I think what was
once considered spoilers is now
just an outstanding football
team.

"Arizona was a team that had
some problems early and the de
fense carried them through, but
lately the offense has been going
along real well."
Arizona coach Larry Smith
feels that his teams turnabout
came following its one week
break after the lowa game and
before UCLA.
"We went back and worked on
fundamentals," he said. "We got
back together as a team. Some
times you can use a week off to
get things back together."
Lately the Arizona offense, led
bv quarterback Tom Tunnicliffe,
has been amassing some im
pressive statistics as the Wildcats
are outscoring their opponents
by almost 12 points a game. Two
weeks ago Tunnicliffe was named
Pacific-10 offensive player of the
week for a 21 of 27 performance
against Pacific which amassed
427 yards and six touchdowns.
The Arizona offense also fea
tures wide receiver Brad An
derson (34 receptions, 610 yards),
tailback Vance Johnson (231
yards, 60 carries), and fullback
Courtney Griffin (323 yards, 71
carries).
"Their offense is much more
pass oriented than in past years,"
Wiggin said about the Wildcats
diverse offensive scheme. "The
key for their running game is the
perimeter. Basically it is the USC
type of sweep. They have a guy
named Vance Johnson who has a
little bit of Darrin (Nelson) in
him."
From a defensive standpoint,
Arizona has also been playing

Stanford cornerback Kevin
Baird, who intercepted a key pass
last week explained. "That's
something we didn't do last
year."
Sophomore outside linebacker
Garin Veris has been a domi
nating force on the Cardinal de
fense. Chosen as the defensive

player of the game against Wash
ington, the 6-foot-6, 250
pounder, had 14 tackles, includ
ing four sacks for 33 yards in
losses.
"There couldn't have been a
better game played by anyone in
the Pac-10 last weekend," Wig
gin said about Veris' per
formance. "He's simply a great
player. And great players make
great plays."
A pass rush will be important
today because Tunnicliffe is the
type of quarterback who will
burn any defense if he has time.
Baird feels that Tunnicliffe's only
weakness is throwing under pres
sure and he thinks that a good

pass rush will be important.
"Tunnicliffe moves well in the
pocket," Baird said, "but he
doesn't move around all that
well."
In the kicking department, Ar
izona features the Pac-10's lead
ing punter in Craig Schiller who
boasts a 43.9 yard average. Wild
cat field goal kicker Max Zende
jas also rates among the top top
in the conference, connecting on
11 of 17 field goals and 23 of 23
PATs. Cardinal clips
Stanford chances of appearing
in a post season bowl appear
quite good. The Sun Bowl
scouted last week's game and if
the Cardinal wins two of its last
three games, it will probably be

invited to either the Sun or Blue
bonnet Bowl. If Stanford wins its
remaining three games, it stands
a chance of going to the Fiesta
Bowl on New Years Day.
Elwav will probably break
seveal records today. He needs
only 20 more competions to
break the all-time NCAA career
mark of 717 set by Mark
Hermann of Purdue. He should
also break the Pac-10 career of
fense mark, needing only 26 more
yards to break Jim Plunkett's rec
ord. Last week, Elway broke the
Pac-10 career mark for most
plays total offense with 1372.
Two giant killers meet on the
farm today and both desperately
need victories to keep their bowl
hopes alive.
Stanford (5-3, 3-2 conference)
and Arizona (4-2-1, 2-1-1) have
both logged impressive upsets
this year and are in the thick of
the bowl picture. Arizona's rec
ord includes an upset over Notre
Dame and a tie with No. 9 ranked
UCLA while Stanford has upset
then No. 11 Ohio State and last
week knocked off No. 1 Wash
ington.

"These are two team struggl
ing to reach some dignity," Stan
ford coach Paul Wiggin said. "I
think its going to be a hard
fought game. We want to win be
cause its important to our players
and our program."
Coming off the Washington
victory and with the game against
UCLA coming up next week, the
Cardinal can not afford to look
past Arizona, although Wiggin
admits that being as up as
the team was last week will be dif
ficult.
"We'll try to eliminate all the
wonderfulness that goes with this
kind of victory," Wiggin said
about last week's game. "We
need to give our total focus
towards our next opponent now.
"This is not a cocky group of
kids," Wiggin added. "What
they see right now is Arizona.
They seem to know that the one
at a time direction that has to
be."

Looking past the Wildcats
would be a big mistake. Al
though Arizona started slowly,
they 3 been on a roll the past
couple of weeks especially on
the road where the Wildcats
have chalked up all their big up
sets.
"Arizona was a team that peo
ple rated ahead of us in the pre

season polls," Wiggin said. "But
even after they tied UCLA
(24-24) and beat Norte Dame this
year, they were still called
spoilers. Well, I think what was
once considered spoilers is now
just an outstanding football
team.

"Arizona was a team that had
some problems early and the de
fense carried them through, but
lately the offense has been going
along real well."
Arizona coach Larry Smith
feels that his teams turnabout
came following its one week
break after the lowa game and
before UCLA.
"We went back and worked on
fundamentals," he said. "We got
back together as a team. Some
times you can use a week off to
get things back together."
Lately the Arizona offense, led
bv quarterback Tom Tunnicliffe,
has been amassing some im
pressive statistics as the Wildcats
are outscoring their opponents
by almost 12 points a game. Two
weeks ago Tunnicliffe was named
Pacific-10 offensive player of the
week for a 21 of 27 performance
against Pacific which amassed
427 yards and six touchdowns.
The Arizona offense also fea
tures wide receiver Brad An
derson (34 receptions, 610 yards),
tailback Vance Johnson (231
yards, 60 carries), and fullback
Courtney Griffin (323 yards, 71
carries).
"Their offense is much more
pass oriented than in past years,"
Wiggin said about the Wildcats
diverse offensive scheme. "The
key for their running game is the
perimeter. Basically it is the USC
type of sweep. They have a guy
named Vance Johnson who has a
little bit of Darrin (Nelson) in
him."
From a defensive standpoint,
Arizona has also been playing

better. It is led by preseason All-
America inside linebacker Ricky
Hunlev and what Wiggin calls a
fairly .quick secondary.
"They play a three deep basic
secondary," Wiggin explained.
Then they do some bizarre things
up front. They work in packages
of things on the defensive line but
they don't bring in eight guys like
Arizona State does."
Last year Arizona was able to
pretty much shut Stanford quar
terback John Elway down. He
only connected on 14 of 34 passes
for 152 yards and one touchdown
in the Stanford loss. But Arizona
coach Smith is not real confident
about the prospects of shutting
down Elway again.
"Two years ago I felt that he
was the best college quarterback
in the game today, maybe ever,"
Smith said. "He had a tremen
dous arm. It was just like a torna
do coming down. He can turn a
football game around so quick
ly."
The Stanford offense has
added some diversity of its own.
After finding a running game
with Mike Dotterer at Washing
ton State, the Cardinal came
back to Stanford Stadium and
showed it off to its home fans.
Dotterer had his second 100 yard
game as the Cardinal ran with
success against the tough Wash
ington defense.
With the return to health of
running back Vincent White, the
Cardinal may use its so-called jet
back backfield of White and Dot
terer.
Injuries last week to starting
fullbacks Rob Moore (torn knee
ligaments) and Greg Hooper
(pinched nerve), causes some
problems at the fullback posi
tion. Although Hooper is ex
pected to return this week,
Moore will be out for the rest of

this week.
the season. Sophomore Kaulana
Park filled in admirably last week
and is expected to split time with
Hooper today.
The Stanford passing game
also got rolling after a
several week slump. Elway con
nected on 20 of 30 passes for 265
yards and two touchdowns, but
most importantly avoided the big
sacks which have been hurting
the team earlier in the year.
Tight end Chris Dressel played
his best game, in an outstanding
and surprising season, '
catching six passes for over 100
yards, bringing his season total to
33 catches for 464 yards.

"Chris Dressel had the best
game he's ever played," Wiggin
said about his performance last
week. "1 don't know whether I've
seen a better performance."
Besides catching passes,
Dressel made several key blocks
to open up the Cardinal running
game.
In general, Wiggin was pleased
with the performance of the of
fensive line, both its pass and run
blocking.
"I think a couple of guys grew
up," Wiggin said. "I think Mike
Teeuws did an outstanding job.
Chris Rose was excellent and so
were the rest of the people up
front."

On defense, the Cardinal sec
ondary has been outstanding.
Leading the conference in air
piracy with 19 interceptions,
Stanford will face a quarterback
in Tunnicliffe, who has not
thrown an interception in four
games (119 attempts).
"Defensively the key to our
success have been the turnovers,"
Stanford cornerback Kevin
Baird, who intercepted a key pass
last week explained. "That's
