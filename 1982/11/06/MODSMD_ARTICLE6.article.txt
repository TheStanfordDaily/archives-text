# Rowen returns to Farm as Card's opponent
## 
### BETH KLEID 
Alumnus Keith Rowen, in his
fourth year as the offensive line
coach for Arizona, has visions of
victory for his team in his mind
and feelings of loyalty to Stan
ford in his heart.
Rowen attended Stanford
from 1970-74 and was a member
of the football team. In 1975 and
1976 he worked part time on
Stanford's football coaching
staff. The bond between Rowen
and Stanford is a strong one.
"I have extremely fond memo
ries of my years at Stanford,"
said Rowen, "it was a tremen
dous place to go to school. It was
a great experience for me from a
football standpoint and from an
educational standpoint. I just
can't say enough positive things
about it."

At Stanford Rowen majored in
political science and received his
masters degree in education, but
he always wanted to go into
coaching. "My father has been a
college football coach for San

Fransisco State for the past 30
years, so I had ties in the field. I
grew up believing that I could be
a college football coach, and now
I'm doing it!" remarked Rowen.
After his years as a Stanford
football player Rowen was
drafted by the Philadelphia
Eagles. "Pro ball was a great op
portunity for me because I en
joyed playing football so much,
and it was a chance for me to con
tinue playing. It's also a nice
thing financially if you're really
good. I just wasn't good enough,
and I was released. You can only
be as good as you can be," com
mented Rowen.

Rowen's coaching philosophy
deals with self-improvement and
self-satisfaction. He believes that
the players should strive to be the
best that they can possibly be.
"At Arizona we tell our kids that
what's important is improving
themselves and getting the most
out of their potentials." Rowen
continued, "We stress setting

goals. We don't worry about tak
ing on Stanford or USC, for ex
ample. What we do worry about
is us getting better."
Rowen feels that this goal set
ting process should go beyond
the football field. He encourages
his players to find an academic
interest and to focus on it. Arizo
na makes use of career counsel
ors to help the athletes pinpoint
their interests.
College football players are
greatly respected by Rowen. He
noted, "To be a college football
player you have to be an outstan
ding individual. Most people
don't realize how much stress is
placed on the players as a result
of sports and academics. College
football is extremely demanding
for the students."

"I get an awful lot of satisfac
tion out of coaching college foot
ball players," stated Rowen. He
enjoys interacting with the stu
dents at a critical point in their
lives. "It is such a thrill to see the

kids mature as football players
and as individuals. I like to see
the kids take their energy and
channel it in a positive direc
tion."
Rowen admits that it will be
difficult to come to Stanford as
an opponent. He is able to sepa
rate his feelings about his alma
mater from his job, but this is a
difficult task. "From a personal
standpoint, playing Stanford will
be very tough," remarked
Rowen. "We have been studying
and preparing the best that we
can to beat them, but it is hard for
me to alienate my special feelings
for Stanford."

From a professional stand
point Rowen acknowledges
Stanford to be a fine opponent.
"We have great respect for Stan
ford as a team. I think that Paul
Wiggin is one of the finest people
in the coaching profession and
John Elway is one of the best col
lege players in America. I've
played under and worked for

Stanford's coaching staff, and I
think they're outstanding."
As for his own team, Rowen is
pleased with Arizona's per
formances this season. "This
year has gone very well. Beating
Notre Dame was a high point.
We tied UCLA, but I think we
deserved to win," said Rowen.
Rowen is looking forward to
the Arizona-Stanford game, and
he thinks the match up will be a
good one. "We are expecting a
very exciting game between two
football teams which are on the
rise," Rowen remarked.
Stanford was a very special
place for Rowen. "I want to
thank the whole community, the
alumni and the supporters of the
football program for making my
years at Stanford unforgettable."
Yet, there is a point where
Rowen draws the line and puts
his feelings for Stanford
aside."We are looking forward
to a big victory today," he said
with enthusiasm.

channel it in a positive direc
tion."
Rowen admits that it will be
difficult to come to Stanford as
an opponent. He is able to sepa
rate his feelings about his alma
mater from his job, but this is a
difficult task. "From a personal
standpoint, playing Stanford will
be very tough," remarked
Rowen. "We have been studying
and preparing the best that we
can to beat them, but it is hard for
me to alienate my special feelings
for Stanford."

From a professional stand
point Rowen acknowledges
Stanford to be a fine opponent.
"We have great respect for Stan
ford as a team. I think that Paul
Wiggin is one of the finest people
in the coaching profession and
John Elway is one of the best col
lege players in America. I've
played under and worked for

Stanford's coaching staff, and I
think they're outstanding."
As for his own team, Rowen is
pleased with Arizona's per
formances this season. "This
year has gone very well. Beating
Notre Dame was a high point.
We tied UCLA, but I think we
deserved to win," said Rowen.
Rowen is looking forward to
the Arizona-Stanford game, and
he thinks the match up will be a
good one. "We are expecting a
very exciting game between two
football teams which are on the
rise," Rowen remarked.
Stanford was a very special
place for Rowen. "I want to
thank the whole community, the
alumni and the supporters of the
football program for making my
years at Stanford unforgettable."
Yet, there is a point where
Rowen draws the line and puts
his feelings for Stanford
aside."We are looking forward
to a big victory today," he said
with enthusiasm.
Alumnus Keith Rowen, in his
fourth year as the offensive line
coach for Arizona, has visions of
victory for his team in his mind
and feelings of loyalty to Stan
ford in his heart.
Rowen attended Stanford
from 1970-74 and was a member
of the football team. In 1975 and
1976 he worked part time on
Stanford's football coaching
staff. The bond between Rowen
and Stanford is a strong one.
"I have extremely fond memo
ries of my years at Stanford,"
said Rowen, "it was a tremen
dous place to go to school. It was
a great experience for me from a
football standpoint and from an
educational standpoint. I just
can't say enough positive things
about it."

At Stanford Rowen majored in
political science and received his
masters degree in education, but
he always wanted to go into
coaching. "My father has been a
college football coach for San

Fransisco State for the past 30
years, so I had ties in the field. I
grew up believing that I could be
a college football coach, and now
I'm doing it!" remarked Rowen.
After his years as a Stanford
football player Rowen was
drafted by the Philadelphia
Eagles. "Pro ball was a great op
portunity for me because I en
joyed playing football so much,
and it was a chance for me to con
tinue playing. It's also a nice
thing financially if you're really
good. I just wasn't good enough,
and I was released. You can only
be as good as you can be," com
mented Rowen.

Rowen's coaching philosophy
deals with self-improvement and
self-satisfaction. He believes that
the players should strive to be the
best that they can possibly be.
"At Arizona we tell our kids that
what's important is improving
themselves and getting the most
out of their potentials." Rowen
continued, "We stress setting

goals. We don't worry about tak
ing on Stanford or USC, for ex
ample. What we do worry about
is us getting better."
Rowen feels that this goal set
ting process should go beyond
the football field. He encourages
his players to find an academic
interest and to focus on it. Arizo
na makes use of career counsel
ors to help the athletes pinpoint
their interests.
College football players are
greatly respected by Rowen. He
noted, "To be a college football
player you have to be an outstan
ding individual. Most people
don't realize how much stress is
placed on the players as a result
of sports and academics. College
football is extremely demanding
for the students."

"I get an awful lot of satisfac
tion out of coaching college foot
ball players," stated Rowen. He
enjoys interacting with the stu
dents at a critical point in their
lives. "It is such a thrill to see the

kids mature as football players
and as individuals. I like to see
the kids take their energy and
channel it in a positive direc
tion."
