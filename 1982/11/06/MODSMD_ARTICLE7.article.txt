# Nolan follows in his father's footsteps
## 
### LISA STERN 
In the fourth of a series of ex
clusive interviews, Cardinal To
day spoke with special assistant
coach Mike Nolan, who works
with defensive backfield coordi
nator Chuck Detwiler. Nolan, who
graduated from Woodside High
School and the University of Ore
gon, is, at age 23, the youngest
member of the Stanford coaching
staff Nolan, the son of former San
Francisco 49er and New Orleans
Saint head coach Dick Nolan, was
a standout free safety with the
Ducks in 1980, collecting 83
tackles and four interceptions.
Later that year he signed as a free
agent with the Denver Broncos and
played in two pre-season games
before he was cut in the second to
the last round. In this discussion,
Nolan talks about the improve
ment in the Cardinal defensive sec
ondary, his change from player to
coach, and the advantages of grow
ing up in the NFL.
CT: What were your im
pressions of the performance of
the defensive backfield last Sat
urday against Washington?
Nolan: A lot of times during
the game I'm in the press box
charting and things like that so
for the most part I get to see the
secondary only for an instant. I
catch one side or the other so it's
hard for me to see during the
game how they've actually done
something or who's made the er
ror if something has gone wrong.
But alter the game and looking at
the films it's easier to say. I think
the secondary as whole has done
real well. We had some people in
there who hadn't played a down
yet, and I felt they did a fine job. I
thought that the guys who had
been in there consistently main
tained throughout that game as
well.

CT: When you played at Ore
gon in your senior year the Ducks
were rated second in the Pac-10
against the pass. Have you tried
to implement any of those de

fenses in the Cardinal secondary?
Nolan: To an extent. Nothing
really changed from when I was a
player to when I became a coach,
and a lot of the things we use I
still have in my mind. I usually
share these with Chuck, and he
basically makes the decisions of
what we're going to use and what
we're not. I feel I've brought
about a few changes, whether
they be minor or major, in the
secondary. I think that the main
thing is that Chuck and 1 are on
the same lines on a lot of things.
Now Chuck is able to do a lot of
what he wants, and I think that is
the main reason for a lot of our
changes.
CT: As the defensive backfield
special assistant, how do you de
fine your role as a coach?
Nolan: My role is basically to
assist Coach Detwiler on the
Field. I deal with four guys, and
they're spread out across the en
tire field. It's tough for only one
guv to coach the whole secondary
on the field. So my being there
helps because 1 can watch two
guys on one side, and he can
watch two on the other. I think
that has helped him the most in
looking for ways to improve the
defensive backfield.
CT: How did you become spe
cial assistant for the secondary?
Nolan: I have known Coach
Wiggin for a long time. He
coached under my father at San
Francisco, and when I was real
little I used to come out and play
catch with him. I had talked to
him for a while about getting inot
coaching even as a player. Last
year when I was at Oregon as a
graduate assistant and we came
down here I talked to him just for
a minute, and he mentioned that
at the end of the year if I needed
help in moving on or getting
someplace else that he would be
glad to help me.
I was planning on leaving Ore
gon anyway because I felt that it
would benefit me, and I called
him and talked to him. It just so

happened that there was an open
ing, and I'm here.
CT: What advantages or dis
advantages are there to being the
youngest member of the
coaching staff?
Nolan: The only thing that
could be a disadvantage that was
a disadvantage last year was that
up there at Oregon I played with
the guys and then coached them.
But although here I'm close in
age, I've never played with these
guvs. They don't really know me.
They only know me as a coach
right now. Being the youngest on
the staff, though, is not really an
advantage or a disadvantage. I'm
just trying to learn.
CT: After your experience with
the Denver Broncos and then as a
coach, do you still have aspira
tions of playing pro football?
Nolan: No not really. Being
around it all my life I've seen that
there are a lot of guys who go af
ter it time and time again. They
go out there, and they get cut the
first year and they want to go
back the next year. And I can't
deny the fact that I had the desire
to, and at times I still wish I was
playing. It's a lot easier than
coaching. It's just a physical
thing, and the hours are not as
long. But right now I'm not in
terested in playing anymore. For
example, USFL comes up and
people ask you about that, but I
don't want to get into that. I've
seen time and time again guys get
torn down, and it's just de
moralizing. To go out there and
give it all you've got, and then to
be denied something really hurts.
But I feel fortunate to have gone
as long as I did.
CT: What advantages and dis
advantages did you have growing
up as Dick Nolan's son?
Nolan: There weren't really
any disadvantages. For example,
I brought my father's name up in
getting the chance to play college
football and getting to coach
here. It's helped me in that way.
Growing up in football and being

around it as a kid you see a lot of
kids from all over the country. It
was a good experience to know a
lot of professional atheletes, and
a lot of them are still my friends
now. For me they are my friends,
and that's exciting.
CT: Did you ever feel any pres
sure to play football?
Nolan: That's something that I
got asked a lot as I was growing
up. I never got pressure from my
father. He advocated playing
sports, but he didn't care which
ones. A lot of times parents force
their kids into playing sports, and
they'll turn away from it as they
get older. But I did it basically on
my own, and that's why I stuck
with it.
CT: Did your father tutor you
in football?
Nolan: He used to play with us,
but he never coached us. As a kid

you play football to have fun,
and your're not concerned with
learning a lot of the little fun
damental things. I learned those
on my own being around the
camps.
CT: Where is your career
headed in the future?
Nolan: I definitely want to
move up. Right now I don't have
an actual position of my own. It's
difficult for me to stay here and
do that. So I basically will have to
go someplace else to move up.
The sooner I move up the better.
I can't count on it. I just have to
do my best here. Someone said to
me the other day that you have to
be a good follower to be a good
leader. I have to do a good job as
a part time assistant before I can
be a good full time assistant.
That's what I have to concentrate
on now.

I can't count on it. I just have to
do my best here. Someone said to
me the other day that you have to
be a good follower to be a good
leader. I have to do a good job as
a part time assistant before I can
be a good full time assistant.
That's what I have to concentrate

THE YOUNG AND THE RESTLESS: Stanford special assistant
for defensive backs Mike Nolan, may be only 23, but head
coach Paul Wiggin feels that he is an important asset to the
coaching staff.
In the fourth of a series of ex
clusive interviews, Cardinal To
day spoke with special assistant
coach Mike Nolan, who works
with defensive backfield coordi
nator Chuck Detwiler. Nolan, who
graduated from Woodside High
School and the University of Ore
gon, is, at age 23, the youngest
member of the Stanford coaching
staff Nolan, the son of former San
Francisco 49er and New Orleans
Saint head coach Dick Nolan, was
a standout free safety with the
Ducks in 1980, collecting 83
tackles and four interceptions.
Later that year he signed as a free
agent with the Denver Broncos and
played in two pre-season games
before he was cut in the second to
the last round. In this discussion,
Nolan talks about the improve
ment in the Cardinal defensive sec
ondary, his change from player to
coach, and the advantages of grow
ing up in the NFL.
CT: What were your im
pressions of the performance of
the defensive backfield last Sat
urday against Washington?
Nolan: A lot of times during
the game I'm in the press box
charting and things like that so
for the most part I get to see the
secondary only for an instant. I
catch one side or the other so it's
hard for me to see during the
game how they've actually done
something or who's made the er
ror if something has gone wrong.
But alter the game and looking at
the films it's easier to say. I think
the secondary as whole has done
real well. We had some people in
there who hadn't played a down
yet, and I felt they did a fine job. I
thought that the guys who had
been in there consistently main
tained throughout that game as
well.

CT: When you played at Ore
gon in your senior year the Ducks
were rated second in the Pac-10
against the pass. Have you tried
to implement any of those de

fenses in the Cardinal secondary?
Nolan: To an extent. Nothing
really changed from when I was a
player to when I became a coach,
and a lot of the things we use I
still have in my mind. I usually
share these with Chuck, and he
basically makes the decisions of
what we're going to use and what
we're not. I feel I've brought
about a few changes, whether
they be minor or major, in the
secondary. I think that the main
thing is that Chuck and 1 are on
the same lines on a lot of things.
Now Chuck is able to do a lot of
what he wants, and I think that is
the main reason for a lot of our
changes.
CT: As the defensive backfield
special assistant, how do you de
fine your role as a coach?
Nolan: My role is basically to
assist Coach Detwiler on the
Field. I deal with four guys, and
they're spread out across the en
tire field. It's tough for only one
guv to coach the whole secondary
on the field. So my being there
helps because 1 can watch two
guys on one side, and he can
watch two on the other. I think
that has helped him the most in
looking for ways to improve the
defensive backfield.
CT: How did you become spe
cial assistant for the secondary?
Nolan: I have known Coach
Wiggin for a long time. He
coached under my father at San
Francisco, and when I was real
little I used to come out and play
catch with him. I had talked to
him for a while about getting inot
coaching even as a player. Last
year when I was at Oregon as a
graduate assistant and we came
down here I talked to him just for
a minute, and he mentioned that
at the end of the year if I needed
help in moving on or getting
someplace else that he would be
glad to help me.
I was planning on leaving Ore
gon anyway because I felt that it
would benefit me, and I called
him and talked to him. It just so

happened that there was an open
ing, and I'm here.
CT: What advantages or dis
advantages are there to being the
youngest member of the
coaching staff?
Nolan: The only thing that
could be a disadvantage that was
a disadvantage last year was that
up there at Oregon I played with
the guys and then coached them.
But although here I'm close in
age, I've never played with these
guvs. They don't really know me.
They only know me as a coach
right now. Being the youngest on
the staff, though, is not really an
advantage or a disadvantage. I'm
just trying to learn.
CT: After your experience with
the Denver Broncos and then as a
coach, do you still have aspira
tions of playing pro football?
Nolan: No not really. Being
around it all my life I've seen that
there are a lot of guys who go af
ter it time and time again. They
go out there, and they get cut the
first year and they want to go
back the next year. And I can't
deny the fact that I had the desire
to, and at times I still wish I was
playing. It's a lot easier than
coaching. It's just a physical
thing, and the hours are not as
long. But right now I'm not in
terested in playing anymore. For
example, USFL comes up and
people ask you about that, but I
don't want to get into that. I've
seen time and time again guys get
torn down, and it's just de
moralizing. To go out there and
give it all you've got, and then to
be denied something really hurts.
But I feel fortunate to have gone
as long as I did.
CT: What advantages and dis
advantages did you have growing
up as Dick Nolan's son?
Nolan: There weren't really
any disadvantages. For example,
I brought my father's name up in
getting the chance to play college
football and getting to coach
here. It's helped me in that way.
Growing up in football and being

around it as a kid you see a lot of
kids from all over the country. It
was a good experience to know a
lot of professional atheletes, and
a lot of them are still my friends
now. For me they are my friends,
and that's exciting.
CT: Did you ever feel any pres
sure to play football?
Nolan: That's something that I
got asked a lot as I was growing
up. I never got pressure from my
father. He advocated playing
sports, but he didn't care which
ones. A lot of times parents force
their kids into playing sports, and
they'll turn away from it as they
get older. But I did it basically on
my own, and that's why I stuck
with it.
CT: Did your father tutor you
in football?
Nolan: He used to play with us,
but he never coached us. As a kid

you play football to have fun,
and your're not concerned with
learning a lot of the little fun
damental things. I learned those
on my own being around the
camps.
CT: Where is your career
headed in the future?
Nolan: I definitely want to
move up. Right now I don't have
an actual position of my own. It's
difficult for me to stay here and
do that. So I basically will have to
go someplace else to move up.
The sooner I move up the better.
I can't count on it. I just have to
do my best here. Someone said to
me the other day that you have to
be a good follower to be a good

you play football to have fun,
and your're not concerned with
learning a lot of the little fun
damental things. I learned those
on my own being around the
camps.
CT: Where is your career
headed in the future?
Nolan: I definitely want to
move up. Right now I don't have
an actual position of my own. It's
difficult for me to stay here and
do that. So I basically will have to
go someplace else to move up.
The sooner I move up the better.
I can't count on it. I just have to
do my best here. Someone said to
me the other day that you have to
be a good follower to be a good
leader. I have to do a good job as
a part time assistant before I can
be a good full time assistant.
That's what I have to concentrate
on now.

THE YOUNG AND THE RESTLESS: Stanford special assistant
for defensive backs Mike Nolan, may be only 23, but head
coach Paul Wiggin feels that he is an important asset to the
coaching staff.
In the fourth of a series of ex
clusive interviews, Cardinal To
day spoke with special assistant
coach Mike Nolan, who works
with defensive backfield coordi
nator Chuck Detwiler. Nolan, who
graduated from Woodside High
School and the University of Ore
gon, is, at age 23, the youngest
member of the Stanford coaching
staff Nolan, the son of former San
Francisco 49er and New Orleans
Saint head coach Dick Nolan, was
a standout free safety with the
Ducks in 1980, collecting 83
tackles and four interceptions.
Later that year he signed as a free
agent with the Denver Broncos and
played in two pre-season games
before he was cut in the second to
the last round. In this discussion,
Nolan talks about the improve
ment in the Cardinal defensive sec
ondary, his change from player to
coach, and the advantages of grow
ing up in the NFL.
CT: What were your im
pressions of the performance of
the defensive backfield last Sat
urday against Washington?
Nolan: A lot of times during
the game I'm in the press box
charting and things like that so
for the most part I get to see the
secondary only for an instant. I
catch one side or the other so it's
hard for me to see during the
game how they've actually done
something or who's made the er
ror if something has gone wrong.
But alter the game and looking at
the films it's easier to say. I think
the secondary as whole has done
real well. We had some people in
there who hadn't played a down
yet, and I felt they did a fine job. I
thought that the guys who had
been in there consistently main
tained throughout that game as
well.

CT: When you played at Ore
gon in your senior year the Ducks
were rated second in the Pac-10
against the pass. Have you tried
to implement any of those de

fenses in the Cardinal secondary?
Nolan: To an extent. Nothing
really changed from when I was a
player to when I became a coach,
and a lot of the things we use I
still have in my mind. I usually
share these with Chuck, and he
basically makes the decisions of
what we're going to use and what
we're not. I feel I've brought
about a few changes, whether
they be minor or major, in the
secondary. I think that the main
thing is that Chuck and 1 are on
the same lines on a lot of things.
Now Chuck is able to do a lot of
what he wants, and I think that is
the main reason for a lot of our
changes.
CT: As the defensive backfield
special assistant, how do you de
fine your role as a coach?
Nolan: My role is basically to
assist Coach Detwiler on the
Field. I deal with four guys, and
they're spread out across the en
tire field. It's tough for only one
guv to coach the whole secondary
on the field. So my being there
helps because 1 can watch two
guys on one side, and he can
watch two on the other. I think
that has helped him the most in
looking for ways to improve the
defensive backfield.
CT: How did you become spe
cial assistant for the secondary?
Nolan: I have known Coach
Wiggin for a long time. He
coached under my father at San
Francisco, and when I was real
little I used to come out and play
catch with him. I had talked to
him for a while about getting inot
coaching even as a player. Last
year when I was at Oregon as a
graduate assistant and we came
down here I talked to him just for
a minute, and he mentioned that
at the end of the year if I needed
help in moving on or getting
someplace else that he would be
glad to help me.
I was planning on leaving Ore
gon anyway because I felt that it
would benefit me, and I called
him and talked to him. It just so

happened that there was an open
ing, and I'm here.
CT: What advantages or dis
advantages are there to being the
youngest member of the
coaching staff?
Nolan: The only thing that
could be a disadvantage that was
a disadvantage last year was that
up there at Oregon I played with
the guys and then coached them.
But although here I'm close in
age, I've never played with these
guvs. They don't really know me.
They only know me as a coach
right now. Being the youngest on
the staff, though, is not really an
advantage or a disadvantage. I'm
just trying to learn.
CT: After your experience with
the Denver Broncos and then as a
coach, do you still have aspira
tions of playing pro football?
Nolan: No not really. Being
around it all my life I've seen that
there are a lot of guys who go af
ter it time and time again. They
go out there, and they get cut the
first year and they want to go
back the next year. And I can't
deny the fact that I had the desire
to, and at times I still wish I was
playing. It's a lot easier than
coaching. It's just a physical
thing, and the hours are not as
long. But right now I'm not in
terested in playing anymore. For
example, USFL comes up and
people ask you about that, but I
don't want to get into that. I've
seen time and time again guys get
torn down, and it's just de
moralizing. To go out there and
give it all you've got, and then to
be denied something really hurts.
But I feel fortunate to have gone
as long as I did.
CT: What advantages and dis
advantages did you have growing
up as Dick Nolan's son?
Nolan: There weren't really
any disadvantages. For example,
I brought my father's name up in
getting the chance to play college
football and getting to coach
here. It's helped me in that way.
Growing up in football and being

around it as a kid you see a lot of
kids from all over the country. It
was a good experience to know a
lot of professional atheletes, and
a lot of them are still my friends
now. For me they are my friends,
and that's exciting.
CT: Did you ever feel any pres
sure to play football?
Nolan: That's something that I
got asked a lot as I was growing
up. I never got pressure from my
father. He advocated playing
sports, but he didn't care which
ones. A lot of times parents force
their kids into playing sports, and
they'll turn away from it as they
get older. But I did it basically on
my own, and that's why I stuck
with it.
CT: Did your father tutor you
in football?
Nolan: He used to play with us,
but he never coached us. As a kid

you play football to have fun,
and your're not concerned with
learning a lot of the little fun
damental things. I learned those
on my own being around the
camps.
CT: Where is your career
headed in the future?
Nolan: I definitely want to
move up. Right now I don't have
an actual position of my own. It's
difficult for me to stay here and
do that. So I basically will have to
go someplace else to move up.
The sooner I move up the better.
I can't count on it. I just have to
do my best here. Someone said to
me the other day that you have to
be a good follower to be a good
leader. I have to do a good job as
a part time assistant before I can
be a good full time assistant.
That's what I have to concentrate
on now.
