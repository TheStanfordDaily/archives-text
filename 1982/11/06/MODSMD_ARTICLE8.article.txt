# Wyman brothers reunited on Cardinal squad
## 
### DAVE DUTCHER 
For brothers David and Mike Wyman, playing togeth
er on the Stanford Cardinal football team is no different
from the time they spent growing up together. And when
the Cardinal takes the field today against Arizona, the
Wvmans will both be wearing the Stanford uniform for
the ninth time this year.
But this is not the first season in they are playing on the
same team.
The Reno, Nevada duo grew up playing football in
their backyard, played on the same high school team to
gether and after Mike came to Stanford in 1980, it was
only a matter of time two years to be exact before
David made bis appearance at the Farm.
"It's fun, I like it," Mike answered when asked what he
thought of playing on the same team as his younger
brother. "We played together in high school when I was a
senior and he was a sophomore."
At Wooster High School, the pair each compiled for
midable playing records. Mike was voted the 1979 Ne
vada State Player of the Year and in that same senior sea
son was named to the All-State first team. In his junior
campaign, Mike garnered second team All-State honors.
In addition to being selected to the All-America hon
orable mention squad, Mike also played basketball for
four years.
David followed in Mike's footsteps, being named the
1981 Nevada Player of the Year. David was also a two

time All-State selection and a member of a state cham
pionship team at Wooster. The three years David played
for Wooster, the teams compiled a 26-3 overall record.
"He had a good high school career," Mike said of
David. "He had to turn some people down when it cams
to picking a school." Among the schools that recruited
David were Notre Dame, UCLA, Nebraska and Wash
ington.
"Both Mike and I had trouble deciding between Wash
ington and here," David said. "That's why it was so sweet
Saturday," he added, referring to Stanford's 43-31 win
over Washington.
Both players are on the defensive side of the line of
scrimmage. Mike (6-foot-6, 245 pounds) holds down the
number two slot at defensive tackle behind fellow junior
John Bergren. David, a 6-3 freshman, is slated for for ac
tion in today's game behind sophomore Matt Soderlund.
"It's more of a team type of thing with both of us on
defense," Mike said. "When we were young my Dad
worked and went to school, and we never lived in one
place for more than two years, and we never really had a
lot of friends.
"So what we used to do was throw a football on the
roof and wait for it to come down, and then whoever got
the ball would run around the backyard with it and the
other guy would try to tackle him."
"We would play like that all day long," David added.
Neither David or Mike played football before high

school but since starting to compete have received con
tinuous support from their parents, who, according to
Mike, have seen every game this year except the Purdue
and Ohio State matchups. "My Dad says he's always
wanted to travel around to watch us, and since we're at
the same school it's a lot easier," Mike pointed out.
It was the Wvmans' parents who stressed doing well in
the classroom along with athletic achievement. "They
made it a challenge for us to do well in both athletics and
academics," Mike said.
The Wvmans own a sawmill in Reno and as an eco
nomics major, Mike hopes to get involved in the business
aspects of running their sawmill. As a freshman, David is
"trying to get my basic requirements done." He added
that having a brother at Stanford for two years before his
arrival has been an asset.
"I definitely had it easy as far as that's concerned," he
said. "He kind of blazed a trail for me. Also when I got
here to start football I knew what it was going to be like."
Mike obviously does not regret coming to the Farm.
"I think Stanford is a gieat university," he said. "I like
how we can play good football and at the same time we
honestly go to class and pass our courses. We're honest
and fair, and we do things right. We can still beat the
number one team in the country (Washington was ranked
No. 1 by the UPI before the loss to the Cardinal last Sat
urday) and do things the right way."
