# Band utilizes laws of physics for today's show

### ROBERT BYERS 
Presented by Edward 80, H.
Mickelson and R. Sinclair, De
partment of Materials Science
and Engineering, Stanford Uni
versity.

Our halftime show today ex
amines the effects of imperfec
tions on the evolution and result
ing properties of solid micro
structures. When a liquid is
cooled below its melting tem
perature, solid nuclei begin to
form preferentially at in
homogeneities in the liquid. Due
to surface energy effects, nuclei
with sizes less than some critical
value will be unstable. However,
the nuclei with radii larger than r
will be stable and will transform
the liquid to the solid phase. In

simple terms, the liquid says to
itself, "I am a rock."
To determine the mechanical
behavior of the resulting solid,
stress-strain experiments are per
formed. The solid will normally
pass through several character
istic stages. In the elastic region
(low stress), the deformation will
be reversible. At the yield point,
inhomogenous plastic deforma
tion begins and propagates
through the sample in the form of
Luder bands. Next, strain hard
ening occurs up to the ultimate
tensile stress, there the applied
stress becomes simply too much,
and the material "break(s) up."
At the atomic level, the stress
strain behavior may be explained

bv the presence of line imperfec
tions "dislocations" in the
crystal structure. In the elastic re
gion, impurity atoms pin the dis
locations. At the yield point, the
impurity atoms can no longer
"hold the line" and plastic de
formation begins.
For semiconductor materials,
it is the electronic properties
which are of interest. These prop
erties may be radically altered by
the introduction of "dopant" at
oms. In the band theory ofsolids,
these dopant atoms add electron
energy levels in the band gap. The
band structure of the solid can be
deteremined from photo excita
tion experiments i.e. by
"light(ing) up" the crystal with

photons of known wavelength.
Sufficiently energetic photons
will excite electrons from the
valence band to the conduction
band or from impurity levels to
the conduction band. The
threshold energies for these ex
citations are directly related to
the position of the energy level
with respect to the conduction
band.
Thus, by introduction im
perfections in a controlled fash
ion, it is possible to tailor the me
chanical and electrical properties
of materials to a wide variety of
applications.
Oh, and ves, there will also be a
pre-game show this afternoon. In
order to simplify things before

the Halftime onslaught the
LSJUMB will presents its GIVE
("You can get it if you really
want it") USA ("Livin' in the
USA") BOWL ("All 1 Ever
Wanted") BID ("Two Tickets
to Paradise") show. Of course,
before any of the pre-game festiv
ities can get under way, the Band
will form the traditional AXE
and play "Come Join The Band"
the BIG GAME is only two
weeks awav so get keyed!
It has been an outstanding
home football season, and the
LSJUMB hopes that you have
enjoyed our shows as much as we
have enjoyed presenting them! B-
