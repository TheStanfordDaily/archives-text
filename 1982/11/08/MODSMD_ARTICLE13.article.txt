## The 						Stanford Daily Financial problems not local 
### 
University Provost A 1 Hastorf recently revealed
his fears that Stanford would plunge into a $3 mil
lion operating budget deficit for the fiscal year
1982-83. A few days later, University President
Donald Kennedy made a pronouncement in Palo
Alto that Stanford shared a "democracy of pover
ty" with all other American institutions of higher
education.
This unexpected news left us reeling in a state of
shock. Stanford? In the red] We were always led to
believe that this was a wealthy school, always in the
top three nationally when it came to soliciting con
tributions from alumni. Most Californians still
think of Stanford as a collegian's country club, a
private reservation for the few remaining rich kids
in America. Why did we get kicked out of Eden?
In a nutshell, federal and state support for re
search and tuition assistance has been plummeting
faster than students' career expectations over the
last few years. The Reagan administration is dis
couraging social science and humanities research,
perhaps because it might lead down politically in
convenient and threatening paths.
Evidence for this rampant anti-intellectualism ex
ists just about Everywhere one chooses to look.
Congress recently turned back an attempt by the
president to make further cuts in the Guaranteed
Student Loan program. Reagan has already suc
ceeded, however, in slashing funding to the Na
tional Science Foundation, which, in turn, funds
graduate students and research scholars. Pell
Grants have also been cut.
To give this issue a little perspective, however,
Stanford's losses have been minor when compared
to the perilous state of public education in the state
of California. Budget cutbacks for the nine-campus
University of California system totalled nearly
$ 100 million last year. UC officials do not speculate
publicly on what the shortfall might be for
the current academic year, but everyone "in the
know" realizes that it will be far worse this time

around. UC students will probably be asked to con
tribute hundreds of dollars in extra fees before the
academic year is over, especially if there is no tax
increase before spring. Cal State and the communi
ty colleges suffer from even more horrendous finan
cial problems.
Given the anti-intellectual attitudes presently
manifested across the nation, the American univer
sity is a particularly vulnerable institution. Univer
sities are socially benevolent and non-exploiting in
stitutions, yet they are still much-maligned and sk.
directly before the cross-hairs of the New Right's
heavy artillery.
The present administration in Washington and
most California voters claim to be defenders of
Western civilization and its traditions, even when
they simultaneously deny support to universities.
This is a non sequitur because the university is a so
cial manifestation of the ideals of the West.
There is something all too American about
"wanting something for nothing." It is no accident,
no small coincidence, that this sad delusion has
taken place during the presidency of the Great
Communicator, Ronald Reagan. More than
Madison Avenue blather, more than cool televised
blandness, however, will be required to save our
universities and ourselves.
Education is essential to the survival of a de
mocatic non-totalitarian society. We do not want
or need an elitist priesthood of wisdom-mongers;
knowledge rightly belongs to all people. Only
education can revitalize and reconstruct the Ameri
can economy; trained personnel are required for
the creation of new wealth, needed to keep the en
gines of affluence traveling down the right track.
We should avoid the siren call of politicians who
have retreated into the dark world of their own
blind fantasies. The stakes could not possibly be
higher; education ensures nothing less than the sur
vival of the much-touted American Dream for our
generation.
