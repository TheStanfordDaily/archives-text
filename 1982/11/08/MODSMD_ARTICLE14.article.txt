## Individualism in dorm's cement 
### 
Several weeks ago I thought that the
only things worth cementing around
Branner Hall were friendships, but it
seems that the University has proven
me wrong. Just a few days ago, the
creeping mass of civilization oozed its
silicates into the Branner courtyard re
placing verdant abundance with con
crete in another necessary operation to
protect Western culture and everything
it stands for.
Perhaps this is just another necessary
evil. The cement provides a dry parking
area for bicycles. Similarly, several feet
in front of the cement, along Escondido
Road, there was once a row of hedges
where there are now several parking
spaces and automobiles, my aging Ford
among them.
But the slow spread of asphalt and ce
ment over the surface of this planet isn't
the whole of the story. The full story of
the cement reveals something more
about the arrogance of power and, per
haps, of man's feeble efforts to deny his
mortality.
As the cement dried, in the darkness
of the early morning hours, several
young people ran outside to leave their
imprints. As the University erects its
great edifices to stand against time and
to announce the power of Western cul
ture to the advanced civilizations which
will follow, these students similarly
rushed to leave their lasting impressions
in the cement to signify their fleeting
presence to future generations.
"Okies Rule," one wrote. "MG the
Swingle," expressed another.
And the University spoke. It vowed
to charge the students $1100 to tear up
the cement and to redo it in order to ob
literate the few scratchings in the sur
face. "It is unsightly," they proclaimed.
"It is damage to University property."
The same University which, rightly
or wrongly, placed Mozart I and several
other pieces of metal modernity in the
midst of campus, which challenged its
detractors with the argument that free
expression and tolerance for new art
forms were the hallmarks of a great uni
versity, called the etchings in the cement
an unsightly damage to property.
The same University which takes

pride in its history and which places the
names of its own presidents on the walls
of its buildings, was shocked when stu
dents feebly scratched in their
messages. "It's different," they cried.
"Students knew they would be
charged for damaging the cement,"
they claimed, in a culture where carv
ings in cement are as common as traffic
lines painted on the roads and where
generations of Stanford students have
been encouraged to carve their names in
tables at Rosotti's restaurant, a
trademark of that institution for dec
ades.
"If we allow students to get away
with this, they'll view it as an invitation
to damage property in the future," they
remarked about students whom they
had so carefully admitted to Stanford
on the basis of their records of intellec
tual achievement, maturity and com
munity service.
"Damage is anything that changes
property beyond ordinary wear and
tear," they claimed, reserving for them
selves the right to define "ordinary wear
and tear" and "damage" as they
pleased.
Little did it matter that the Univer
sity had entered into a contractual resi

dential agreement with its student resi
dents and then chose later to redefine
the terms of the agreement in its favor.
Little did it matter that there might
be other solutions than spending $1100
to destroy and redo the cement.
It would be easy to dismiss my argu
ment on the basis of self-interest, were 1
one of the parties; but I amy*
not. I did not carve in the wet cement,
nor did I encourage others to do so.
Yet, somehow, I would still like to see
those etchings remain. I would like to
see them remain for the same reason
that I want to see Mozart I on campus,
for the same reason that I want to pro
tect the beautiful mural of the Little
Prince which was painted last year in a
student room in Branner, and for the
same reason that I even want to protect
the spray paint graffiti on New York's
subway walls.
I want to be reminded sometimes that
even in a society where the collective
sometimes seems to dominate the indi
vidual, that those individuals without
the weight of propriety and financial
power behind them still have an op
portunity for self-expression.

the cement and to redo it in order to ob
literate the few scratchings in the sur
face. "It is unsightly," they proclaimed.
"It is damage to University property."
The same University which, rightly
or wrongly, placed Mozart I and several
other pieces of metal modernity in the
midst of campus, which challenged its
detractors with the argument that free
expression and tolerance for new art
forms were the hallmarks of a great uni
versity, called the etchings in the cement
an unsightly damage to property.
The same University which takes

pride in its history and which places the
names of its own presidents on the walls
of its buildings, was shocked when stu
dents feebly scratched in their
messages. "It's different," they cried.
"Students knew they would be
charged for damaging the cement,"
they claimed, in a culture where carv
ings in cement are as common as traffic
lines painted on the roads and where
generations of Stanford students have
been encouraged to carve their names in
tables at Rosotti's restaurant, a
trademark of that institution for dec
ades.
"If we allow students to get away
with this, they'll view it as an invitation
to damage property in the future," they
remarked about students whom they
had so carefully admitted to Stanford
on the basis of their records of intellec
tual achievement, maturity and com
munity service.
"Damage is anything that changes
property beyond ordinary wear and
tear," they claimed, reserving for them
selves the right to define "ordinary wear
and tear" and "damage" as they
pleased.
Little did it matter that the Univer
sity had entered into a contractual resi

dential agreement with its student resi
dents and then chose later to redefine
the terms of the agreement in its favor.
Little did it matter that there might
be other solutions than spending $1100
to destroy and redo the cement.
It would be easy to dismiss my argu
ment on the basis of self-interest, were 1
one of the parties; but I amy*
not. I did not carve in the wet cement,
nor did I encourage others to do so.
Yet, somehow, I would still like to see
those etchings remain. I would like to
see them remain for the same reason
that I want to see Mozart I on campus,
for the same reason that I want to pro
tect the beautiful mural of the Little
Prince which was painted last year in a
student room in Branner, and for the
same reason that I even want to protect
the spray paint graffiti on New York's
subway walls.
I want to be reminded sometimes that
even in a society where the collective
sometimes seems to dominate the indi
vidual, that those individuals without
the weight of propriety and financial
power behind them still have an op
portunity for self-expression.

Several weeks ago I thought that the
only things worth cementing around
Branner Hall were friendships, but it
seems that the University has proven
me wrong. Just a few days ago, the
creeping mass of civilization oozed its
silicates into the Branner courtyard re
placing verdant abundance with con
crete in another necessary operation to
protect Western culture and everything
it stands for.
Perhaps this is just another necessary
evil. The cement provides a dry parking
area for bicycles. Similarly, several feet
in front of the cement, along Escondido
Road, there was once a row of hedges
where there are now several parking
spaces and automobiles, my aging Ford
among them.
But the slow spread of asphalt and ce
ment over the surface of this planet isn't
the whole of the story. The full story of
the cement reveals something more
about the arrogance of power and, per
haps, of man's feeble efforts to deny his
mortality.
As the cement dried, in the darkness
of the early morning hours, several
young people ran outside to leave their
imprints. As the University erects its
great edifices to stand against time and
to announce the power of Western cul
ture to the advanced civilizations which
will follow, these students similarly
rushed to leave their lasting impressions
in the cement to signify their fleeting
presence to future generations.
"Okies Rule," one wrote. "MG the
Swingle," expressed another.
And the University spoke. It vowed
to charge the students $1100 to tear up
the cement and to redo it in order to ob
literate the few scratchings in the sur
face. "It is unsightly," they proclaimed.
"It is damage to University property."
