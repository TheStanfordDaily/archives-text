## 'Me-first' Californians denied useful bottle bill 
### 
I voted; therefore, my outcry is legit
imate. It's also concerned, frustrated
and disgusted, though that has little to
do with its legitimacy.
I'm not going to complain about
mudslinging congressional campaigns,
or even uncontrolled handguns, but
about something that strikes me closer
to home — the bottle refund measure
(Proposition 11). Last Tuesday, voters
decided not to put forth the extra effort
required to implement five-cent de
posits on soft drink and beer con
tainers. While the fact that Californians
had the bill on the ballot at all deserves
some praise, their rejection of the pro
posal can be blamed primarly on basic
American (Californian?) selfishness. In
keeping with the current fad of cutting
spending, voters opted not to sacrifice
the money and convenience necessary
to initiate a wholly rational and sensible
practice of returning containers.

I didn't vote for the bottle bill. Nor
did I vote against it. I chose instead to
punch holes in an absentee ballot for
my home state, Oregon, where the gov
ernment and the people decided years
ago that saving our resources was worth
a nickel-per-can deposit. I'm not saying
that it's not a hassle to carry sticky con
tainers back to the store, that employ
ees don't grumble a little about count
ing bottles, or that week-old empty six
packs are nice things to have lying
around the house. But, like bellbottoms
and rain, you get used to it. And, after a
while, it becomes unimaginable that
there could be any other way to do
things.
I guess I get a little gratification from
returning empties to the store. Besides
the cold cash, it's kind of an ego trip to
think that you're helping decrease con
sumption of the Earth's non-renewable
resources. While the deposit per indi

vidual container is minimal, it seems to
be enough to reduce freeway litter by in
viting picker-uppers to earn some cash.
Exit Ecotopia; enter California,
home of Mono Lake, rock groups, cults
and Reaganomics. Land of consump
tion. Within a few years, residents of
this sun-blessed state are bound to
stumble upon the fact that things such
as water use, public schools and natural
resources need a little money, a little at
tention and maybe even some extra ef
fort. Selfishness is not an answer; it's an
excuse. The defeat of Proposition 11 is a
clear example of the "me-first" Califor
nian attitude. Let's hope that some
good Northwestern vibes can trickle
down into this land so concerned about
"looking out for number one — " while
this land still exists.
