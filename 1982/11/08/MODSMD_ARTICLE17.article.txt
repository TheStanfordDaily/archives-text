## Rape and the male's culpability 
### 
Rape is an extremely important thing
for men here (and everywhere) to think
about and deal with .. . yet, at the same
time, we rarely do. That's probably be
cause men really don't understand rape.
Since it is men who commit rapes, we
don't really feel victimized by it. We can
sympathize ... but it's very difficult to
empathize or to see how rape and re
lated sex-role issues affect our daily
lives and relationships. Perhaps it is
time we started taking responsibility for
changing that.
It's hard for men to understand wom
en's feelings about rape — feelings of
fear and frustration and anger. It's hard
for us to know what it's like to be afraid
to go jogging alone or to have to ask
someone to walk with us to the library
or to the Coffee House . . . It's hard for
us to experience a woman's sense of an
ger at this confinement and to know
that sense of frustration and pow
erlessness which such confinement
creates.
It's even harder to most men to know
what it feels like to have someone try to
force sex. on a date or after a party —
someone you thought respected you as
a person or as a friend. As men, we've
been conditioned from birth to hide
from our own feelings, to repress them.
That conditioning also makes us less
sensitive to the feelings of those around
us. It is about time that we started fac
ing up to them.
If we men understand only one thing
from all this, it should be the realization
that rape is a community problem. It is
not just a woman's problem! It is some
thing that each and every one of us must
face and take responsibility for chang
ing. All men are implicated in the prob
lem of rape, yet we are so often unwill
ing to be part of the terrible yet logical
extension of many of the same values
and sex-role patterns which we play out
in our daily lives. Our responsibility for
dealing with rape is rooted in this ev
eryday behavior, and rethinking some
of it will benefit all of us, not just our
women friends.
When we talk about the need for men
to understand the problem of rape and
to take their share of responsibility for
it, we need to look for ways in which we,
as men, can start to do that. Remember
the letter to the Daily last year that sug
gested a temporary male curfew — the
idea that men should not go anywhere
on this campus after 6 p.m. without
some sort of escort — an idea which was
successfully tried at UC-Berkeley a few
years ago. Well, when we first read that,
it was hard to see how such a proposal
would really help solve the problem.
Why were the two women really sug
gesting it?
The point of such an exercise — this
requirement that all men be forced to
find an escort after dark — would not
merely be a new means for protecting
women, nor would it be an attempt to
confine men out of anger. Instead, it
would help men to feel what women
must experience every day. It would
help us get in touch with thc daily reality
of rape ... the reality which women
know too well — of always having to
find a jogging partner. It is a way by
which we men would start to be sensi
tive to the roots of a woman's ex
perience — the daily fear and frustra
tion.
There are several more concrete
things which all men must consider in
helping a community confront the
problem of rape. First, in the long term,
rape can only be successfully overcome
bv a re-examination and re-evaluation
of our traditional sex role behavior and
attitudes. We must remember that a
clear majority of rapes occur between
people who knew each other before.
They take place more often in the
bedroom than in the bushes, and the
vast majority of these kind go un
reported, for obvious reasons.
Men here and everywhere have to
start taking responsibility for this kind
of acquaintance/date rape (some may
call it "forced sex"). We have to stop
hiding behind such easy ration

alizations as "I could never rape any
body," and start examining the ways in
which we and our friends really relate to
the women we know. Have you ever
forced sex on someone? Or have you
ever heard her say no but gone ahead
anyway because that's what you felt like
and because you told yourself that's
what your "partner" really wants un
derneath? Sounds vaguely familiar? If
so, then realize how it reflects the at
titudes which many males learn from
day one — attitudes which require some
fundamental rethinking.
It's pretty clear that rape is rooted in
forms of dominance and aggression as
well as in men's sexual conditioning. It
is the ultimate and most horrible man
ifestation of these values. Since we men
are taught these values and so often em
body them, it is up to us to play a major
role in changing them.
On a daily basis, each of us can work
to become more sensitive and aware as
men — in our relationship, in our be
havior and attitudes, and in our dis
cussions with friends, both male and
female. That is where the seeds ot im
portant, substantive changc arc sown. 1
This change is the real long-term solu
tion to rape, if only we have the good
sense to see how changes benefit all of
us, including men, and not feel threat
ened by them. If women's anger and de
mands for change are threatening to us,
we must look inside ourselves and our
beliefs for the reasons why. We must
ask ourselves why so many men feel
threatened by strong, assertive women
and our friends who call themselves
feminists. It is far too easy to simply be
defensive, as we always seem to be.
What is so ironic is that the changes
which dVe being demanded are totally in
our self-interest. Women are merely
asking us to become more feeling,
thoughtful, sensitive human beings.
How can men be so defensive about
that?
In the short term, there are several
other practical things that we as men
can do to deal with the issue of rape.
First of all, we men must take far
greater initiative in telling people when
we are going to the library, or jogging,
or to some other place where it is safer
(and more fun) to go in a group, partic
ularly at night. Don't force women to

ask us to escort them. That puts the
male once again in the role of protector
and paternalist. We do not need that. It
is demeaning to women and it is not a
fair burden for them to have to bear. It
perpetuates many of the same stere
otypes which lead to rape. Further, a lot
of women simply won't ask for help.
We men must take the initiative and
make it a comfortable suggestion; it
should not be: 'TIJ protect you by walk
ing you to the library," kind of thing.
A second important concept: when
you find yourself in a lonely place, par
ticularly at night, and there's a woman
walking in front of you ... drop back,
take a different route, do not frighten
her. We've raised this scenario in count
less Rape Education Project dis
cussions in dorms and 99 percent of all
women have said they just wished the
guy would disappear in those circum-!
stances. It might seem nice to go up and
say, "Hi, can I escort you someplace."
Often this response can be misin
terpreted.
A third important suggestion: No
more rape jokes. They areaWunny. W«
should all know that by now.
times, though, the hardest thing to do is
to call your friends on jokes or other
"harmless" sexist comments. It's a
shame that we don't do it more often.
Finally, and perhaps most im
portantly, we must remind ourselves
how the issue of rape connects so close
ly to many of the behavior patterns that
each of us acts out on a daily basis.
That's what makes it possible to view
this problem in a positive framework.
Bv treating rape as a community prob
lem for which we all share responsi
bility, we have the chance to build new
trust and caring on individual as well as
community levels.
The attitude and behavioral changes
which are necessary to attack the cause
of rape in our society are the very same
changes which will make our personal
relationships more open, sensitive and
communicative. What better reason
could we ask for to start beginning the
process of change today.

other practical things that we as men
can do to deal with the issue of rape.
First of all, we men must take far
greater initiative in telling people when
we are going to the library, or jogging,
or to some other place where it is safer
(and more fun) to go in a group, partic
ularly at night. Don't force women to

ask us to escort them. That puts the
male once again in the role of protector
and paternalist. We do not need that. It
is demeaning to women and it is not a
fair burden for them to have to bear. It
perpetuates many of the same stere
otypes which lead to rape. Further, a lot
of women simply won't ask for help.
We men must take the initiative and
make it a comfortable suggestion; it
should not be: 'TIJ protect you by walk
ing you to the library," kind of thing.
A second important concept: when
you find yourself in a lonely place, par
ticularly at night, and there's a woman
walking in front of you ... drop back,
take a different route, do not frighten
her. We've raised this scenario in count
less Rape Education Project dis
cussions in dorms and 99 percent of all
women have said they just wished the
guy would disappear in those circum-!
stances. It might seem nice to go up and
say, "Hi, can I escort you someplace."
Often this response can be misin
terpreted.
A third important suggestion: No
more rape jokes. They areaWunny. W«
should all know that by now.
times, though, the hardest thing to do is
to call your friends on jokes or other
"harmless" sexist comments. It's a
shame that we don't do it more often.
Finally, and perhaps most im
portantly, we must remind ourselves
how the issue of rape connects so close
ly to many of the behavior patterns that
each of us acts out on a daily basis.
That's what makes it possible to view
this problem in a positive framework.
Bv treating rape as a community prob
lem for which we all share responsi
bility, we have the chance to build new
trust and caring on individual as well as
community levels.
The attitude and behavioral changes
which are necessary to attack the cause
of rape in our society are the very same
changes which will make our personal
relationships more open, sensitive and
communicative. What better reason
could we ask for to start beginning the
process of change today.

Rape is an extremely important thing
for men here (and everywhere) to think
about and deal with .. . yet, at the same
time, we rarely do. That's probably be
cause men really don't understand rape.
Since it is men who commit rapes, we
don't really feel victimized by it. We can
sympathize ... but it's very difficult to
empathize or to see how rape and re
lated sex-role issues affect our daily
lives and relationships. Perhaps it is
time we started taking responsibility for
changing that.
It's hard for men to understand wom
en's feelings about rape — feelings of
fear and frustration and anger. It's hard
for us to know what it's like to be afraid
to go jogging alone or to have to ask
someone to walk with us to the library
or to the Coffee House . . . It's hard for
us to experience a woman's sense of an
ger at this confinement and to know
that sense of frustration and pow
erlessness which such confinement
creates.
It's even harder to most men to know
what it feels like to have someone try to
force sex. on a date or after a party —
someone you thought respected you as
a person or as a friend. As men, we've
been conditioned from birth to hide
from our own feelings, to repress them.
That conditioning also makes us less
sensitive to the feelings of those around
us. It is about time that we started fac
ing up to them.
If we men understand only one thing
from all this, it should be the realization
that rape is a community problem. It is
not just a woman's problem! It is some
thing that each and every one of us must
face and take responsibility for chang
ing. All men are implicated in the prob
lem of rape, yet we are so often unwill
ing to be part of the terrible yet logical
extension of many of the same values
and sex-role patterns which we play out
in our daily lives. Our responsibility for
dealing with rape is rooted in this ev
eryday behavior, and rethinking some
of it will benefit all of us, not just our
women friends.
When we talk about the need for men
to understand the problem of rape and
to take their share of responsibility for
it, we need to look for ways in which we,
as men, can start to do that. Remember
the letter to the Daily last year that sug
gested a temporary male curfew — the
idea that men should not go anywhere
on this campus after 6 p.m. without
some sort of escort — an idea which was
successfully tried at UC-Berkeley a few
years ago. Well, when we first read that,
it was hard to see how such a proposal
would really help solve the problem.
Why were the two women really sug
gesting it?
The point of such an exercise — this
requirement that all men be forced to
find an escort after dark — would not
merely be a new means for protecting
women, nor would it be an attempt to
confine men out of anger. Instead, it
would help men to feel what women
must experience every day. It would
help us get in touch with thc daily reality
of rape ... the reality which women
know too well — of always having to
find a jogging partner. It is a way by
which we men would start to be sensi
tive to the roots of a woman's ex
perience — the daily fear and frustra
tion.
There are several more concrete
things which all men must consider in
helping a community confront the
problem of rape. First, in the long term,
rape can only be successfully overcome
bv a re-examination and re-evaluation
of our traditional sex role behavior and
attitudes. We must remember that a
clear majority of rapes occur between
people who knew each other before.
They take place more often in the
bedroom than in the bushes, and the
vast majority of these kind go un
reported, for obvious reasons.
Men here and everywhere have to
start taking responsibility for this kind
of acquaintance/date rape (some may
call it "forced sex"). We have to stop
hiding behind such easy ration

alizations as "I could never rape any
body," and start examining the ways in
which we and our friends really relate to
the women we know. Have you ever
forced sex on someone? Or have you
ever heard her say no but gone ahead
anyway because that's what you felt like
and because you told yourself that's
what your "partner" really wants un
derneath? Sounds vaguely familiar? If
so, then realize how it reflects the at
titudes which many males learn from
day one — attitudes which require some
fundamental rethinking.
It's pretty clear that rape is rooted in
forms of dominance and aggression as
well as in men's sexual conditioning. It
is the ultimate and most horrible man
ifestation of these values. Since we men
are taught these values and so often em
body them, it is up to us to play a major
role in changing them.
On a daily basis, each of us can work
to become more sensitive and aware as
men — in our relationship, in our be
havior and attitudes, and in our dis
cussions with friends, both male and
female. That is where the seeds ot im
portant, substantive changc arc sown. 1
This change is the real long-term solu
tion to rape, if only we have the good
sense to see how changes benefit all of
us, including men, and not feel threat
ened by them. If women's anger and de
mands for change are threatening to us,
we must look inside ourselves and our
beliefs for the reasons why. We must
ask ourselves why so many men feel
threatened by strong, assertive women
and our friends who call themselves
feminists. It is far too easy to simply be
defensive, as we always seem to be.
What is so ironic is that the changes
which dVe being demanded are totally in
our self-interest. Women are merely
asking us to become more feeling,
thoughtful, sensitive human beings.
How can men be so defensive about
that?
In the short term, there are several
other practical things that we as men

First of all, we men must take far

problem of rape. First, in the long term,
rape can only be successfully overcome
bv a re-examination and re-evaluation
of our traditional sex role behavior and
attitudes. We must remember that a
clear majority of rapes occur between
people who knew each other before.
They take place more often in the
bedroom than in the bushes, and the
vast majority of these kind go un
reported, for obvious reasons.
Men here and everywhere have to
start taking responsibility for this kind
of acquaintance/date rape (some may
call it "forced sex"). We have to stop
hiding behind such easy ration

alizations as "I could never rape any
body," and start examining the ways in
which we and our friends really relate to
the women we know. Have you ever
forced sex on someone? Or have you
ever heard her say no but gone ahead
anyway because that's what you felt like
and because you told yourself that's
what your "partner" really wants un
derneath? Sounds vaguely familiar? If
so, then realize how it reflects the at
titudes which many males learn from
day one — attitudes which require some
fundamental rethinking.
It's pretty clear that rape is rooted in
forms of dominance and aggression as
well as in men's sexual conditioning. It
is the ultimate and most horrible man
ifestation of these values. Since we men
are taught these values and so often em
body them, it is up to us to play a major
role in changing them.
On a daily basis, each of us can work
to become more sensitive and aware as
men — in our relationship, in our be
havior and attitudes, and in our dis
cussions with friends, both male and
female. That is where the seeds ot im
portant, substantive changc arc sown. 1
This change is the real long-term solu
tion to rape, if only we have the good
sense to see how changes benefit all of
us, including men, and not feel threat
ened by them. If women's anger and de
mands for change are threatening to us,
we must look inside ourselves and our
beliefs for the reasons why. We must
ask ourselves why so many men feel
threatened by strong, assertive women
and our friends who call themselves
feminists. It is far too easy to simply be
defensive, as we always seem to be.
What is so ironic is that the changes
which dVe being demanded are totally in
our self-interest. Women are merely
asking us to become more feeling,
thoughtful, sensitive human beings.
How can men be so defensive about
that?
In the short term, there are several
other practical things that we as men
can do to deal with the issue of rape.
First of all, we men must take far
greater initiative in telling people when
we are going to the library, or jogging,
or to some other place where it is safer
(and more fun) to go in a group, partic
ularly at night. Don't force women to

ask us to escort them. That puts the
male once again in the role of protector
and paternalist. We do not need that. It
is demeaning to women and it is not a
fair burden for them to have to bear. It
perpetuates many of the same stere
otypes which lead to rape. Further, a lot
of women simply won't ask for help.
We men must take the initiative and
make it a comfortable suggestion; it
should not be: 'TIJ protect you by walk
ing you to the library," kind of thing.
A second important concept: when
you find yourself in a lonely place, par
ticularly at night, and there's a woman
walking in front of you ... drop back,
take a different route, do not frighten
her. We've raised this scenario in count
less Rape Education Project dis
cussions in dorms and 99 percent of all
women have said they just wished the
guy would disappear in those circum-!
stances. It might seem nice to go up and
say, "Hi, can I escort you someplace."
Often this response can be misin
terpreted.
A third important suggestion: No
more rape jokes. They areaWunny. W«
should all know that by now.
times, though, the hardest thing to do is
to call your friends on jokes or other
"harmless" sexist comments. It's a
shame that we don't do it more often.
Finally, and perhaps most im
portantly, we must remind ourselves
how the issue of rape connects so close
ly to many of the behavior patterns that
each of us acts out on a daily basis.
That's what makes it possible to view
this problem in a positive framework.
Bv treating rape as a community prob
lem for which we all share responsi
bility, we have the chance to build new
trust and caring on individual as well as
community levels.
The attitude and behavioral changes
which are necessary to attack the cause
of rape in our society are the very same
changes which will make our personal
relationships more open, sensitive and
communicative. What better reason
could we ask for to start beginning the
process of change today.

Rape is an extremely important thing
for men here (and everywhere) to think
about and deal with .. . yet, at the same
time, we rarely do. That's probably be
cause men really don't understand rape.
Since it is men who commit rapes, we
don't really feel victimized by it. We can
sympathize ... but it's very difficult to
empathize or to see how rape and re
lated sex-role issues affect our daily
lives and relationships. Perhaps it is
time we started taking responsibility for
changing that.
It's hard for men to understand wom
en's feelings about rape — feelings of
fear and frustration and anger. It's hard
for us to know what it's like to be afraid
to go jogging alone or to have to ask
someone to walk with us to the library
or to the Coffee House . . . It's hard for
us to experience a woman's sense of an
ger at this confinement and to know
that sense of frustration and pow
erlessness which such confinement
creates.
It's even harder to most men to know
what it feels like to have someone try to
force sex. on a date or after a party —
someone you thought respected you as
a person or as a friend. As men, we've
been conditioned from birth to hide
from our own feelings, to repress them.
That conditioning also makes us less
sensitive to the feelings of those around
us. It is about time that we started fac
ing up to them.
If we men understand only one thing
from all this, it should be the realization
that rape is a community problem. It is
not just a woman's problem! It is some
thing that each and every one of us must
face and take responsibility for chang
ing. All men are implicated in the prob
lem of rape, yet we are so often unwill
ing to be part of the terrible yet logical
extension of many of the same values
and sex-role patterns which we play out
in our daily lives. Our responsibility for
dealing with rape is rooted in this ev
eryday behavior, and rethinking some
of it will benefit all of us, not just our
women friends.
When we talk about the need for men
to understand the problem of rape and
to take their share of responsibility for
it, we need to look for ways in which we,
as men, can start to do that. Remember
the letter to the Daily last year that sug
gested a temporary male curfew — the
idea that men should not go anywhere
on this campus after 6 p.m. without
some sort of escort — an idea which was
successfully tried at UC-Berkeley a few
years ago. Well, when we first read that,
it was hard to see how such a proposal
would really help solve the problem.
Why were the two women really sug
gesting it?
The point of such an exercise — this
requirement that all men be forced to
find an escort after dark — would not
merely be a new means for protecting
women, nor would it be an attempt to
confine men out of anger. Instead, it
would help men to feel what women
must experience every day. It would
help us get in touch with thc daily reality
of rape ... the reality which women
know too well — of always having to
find a jogging partner. It is a way by
which we men would start to be sensi
tive to the roots of a woman's ex
perience — the daily fear and frustra
tion.
There are several more concrete
things which all men must consider in
helping a community confront the
problem of rape. First, in the long term,
rape can only be successfully overcome
bv a re-examination and re-evaluation
of our traditional sex role behavior and
