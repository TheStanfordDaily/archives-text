## Exotic stolen goods located 
### KAREN SPRINGEN 
Police made the largest recovery of stolen goods in Stan
ford history last Thursday, according to Stanford Police
Chief Marvin Herrington.
Stolen property estimated at 5750,000 was recovered from
the home of a La Honda couple, Robert and Maureen
O'Connor, who may have been involved in more than 130
Midpeninsula burglaries, including those of at least 30 Stan
ford residences. The losses from the burglaries during the
last two years amount to more than $2.5 million.
An area-wide all points bulletin has been issued for
O'Connor, who successfully fled on foot from his home
when officers arrived to question his wife Thursday, said
Stanford Capt. Raoul Niemeyer, who has directed the in
vestigation. Maureen O'Connor was arrested at the scene.
Robert O'Connor is still at large. Police should have a
warrant for his arrest today.
Niemeyer, Stanford Sgt. Nick Bruno, FBI agent Mike
Keeley and Detective Elizabeth Martin of the Palo Alto Po
lice Department went to the La Honda residence. "When we
knocked on the front door, we saw the man believed to be
O'Connor move to the rear, then bolt out of the house like
a hornet." When Maureen O'Connor arrived, she was told
to go to her house. The man believed to be Robert O'Connor
was spotted again, "but took off across a field into the for
est," Niemeyer said.
After observing suitcases with owner's names, art objects,
expensive photographic equipment, firearms, valuable rugs,
furs and jewelry, they obtained a search warrant, returned to

the house with a U-Haul truck and spent 12 hours filling it
with the stolen property.
The police found little TV or stereo equipment. "He was a
professional in it for the money," Niemeyer said. "He knew
this area was affluent. People travel around the world collec
ting, and he'd collect from them."
The burglar, who cases houses by innocuously jogging
around the area at night, is described as an athletic, white
male, five-feet, 11 inches tall, 39 years old, 150 pounds, with
curlv brown hair, a mustache and beard, and a large space
between his front teeth.
Most of the burglaries occurred during the autumn be
tween 5 p.m. and 10 p.m. Thursdays and Fridays. After
parking his car, the burglar jogged to likely houses and usu
ally entered through the rear of the house. He apparently
wore gloves.
Last year, a Menlo Park police officer found a white Saab,
which contained O'Connor's wallet, near the scene of an in
terrupted burglary. The car was filled with jewelry and other
property. When police arrested O'Connor as a possible sus
pect, the visual identification was insufficient and O'Connor
was released.
Later, O'Connor was traced to an art dealer in Renton,
Washington, who noticed a name and address with some
valuable plates and contacted detectives in Los Altos. Be
cause the property had crossed state lines, the FBI became
involved. Niemeyer matched photos they took of a rug
which O'Connor left on consignment with the dealer and
pictures of a kashan rug photographed
bv its Stanford owner.
The owner, a Faculty Ghetto resident
who asked to remain anonymous, said
the burglar entered his house through a
screen window on the second floor last
November. "They took everything that
was worth anything in the house," he
said.
The resident said several neighbors
and residents of Frenchman's Hill had
also been burglarized.
The Stangl family home at 1028 Ver
nier Place was burglarized Friday, Oct.
8. The burglary was similar to the other
Midpeninsula burglaries in the past two
years. The burglar took exotic goods
and entered the Stangls' house between
7 p.m. and 9 p.m. while the family was
out to dinner, according to Juthica
Stangl, the American Studies House
cook. He probably entered by removing
a window screen, she said.
Stangl said the burglar took 23
unique brocade saris, oriental silver an

tiques, ivorv chests from India, gold
watches, a tea set, several cameras and
other unique items. He then apparently
placed the stolen goods in a suitcase, a
camera bag and her son's backpack.
"He didn't take any TVs or radios,"
Stangl said. "He was very particular
about what he took," she added. He left
three saris and "took only the very valu
able ones." She said he did not seem
knowledgeable about jewelry, since he
took some costume jewelry. "He just
emptied drawers."
The burglar fed the family dog with
cream and eggs "to calm him down,"
Stangl said.
Niemeyer will hold a news con
ference this morning at 10 at the Police
Office on Serra St.and open the back
door of the truck with the recovered
property. But burglary victims will not
be able to claim any stolen goods for at
least a week, as police must maintain
control of the evidence.
Burglary victims have been asked to
obtain copies of their police reports and
call 497-9639 if they believe their prop
erty may have been recovered.
