## Wildcats score 28 points in final 12 minutes Arizona coasts by blundering Stanford 
### SID SPAETH 
Bowl-bound Arizona, capital
izing on key Stanford late-game
blunders, scored 28 points in the
final 12 minutes Saturday to
wrestle an important 41-27 con
ference win from the tiring
Cardinal.
The Wildcats trailed by 14
points with 12:46 remaining after
Vincent White burst through the
Arizona defense for a 22-yard
touchdown run. but the Wildcats
were about to break the dike.
Arizona had fourth-and-two
at the Cardinal 33-yard line when
quarterback Tom Tunnicliffe
faked a hand-off into the line and
pulled the Cardinal secondary in.
Tunnicliffe then stepped back
and lobbed a 67-yard scoring
strike to tight end Mark Keel,
who was 10 yards behind the
Stanford coverage.
"We had a guy (free safety
Vaughn Williams) bite on the
running play action," Wiggin
said. "I think that play was the
momentum changer. We were
playing pretty sound defense up
until that point. That gave them
life and put them back in the ball
game."
Arizona quickly shifted into
high gear and, after a Stanford
punt, drove 78 yards in 10 plays
to tie the game.
"They had one good drive,"
Wiggin said. "The one that
brought it to a tie was a sustained
well-executed drive.
Arizona offensive linemen,
who had played ihe Cardinal de
fense to a draw for most of the
game, quickly became dominant.
Running backs Vance Johnson,
Brian Holland and William Red
man were all key factors in the
drive that ended with a one-yard
plunge bv Holland behind the
block of right tackle Marsharne
Graves.
"They were sucking (air),"
said Graves, who is from San
Francisco. "We were told at the
beginning of the week that they
weren't a good fourth quarter
team and we should just go out
there and keep pounding them.
We just went right out there. We
knew we could do it."

The game was still tied, but the
floodgates sprung open three sec
onds later when reserve cor
nerback Lvnnden Brown, anoth
er San Francisco native, tackled
freshman returnman Ken Wil
liams at the 13-yard line and
stripped the ball loose. The ball
bounced back to the Stanford
four-yard line where Bryan
Evans recovered to set up the
winning touchdown.
"I knew that what I'm sup
posed to do is try to strip him of
the ball," Brown said. "I hit him
high and then brought mv arms
down, and the ball popped
loose."
Williams had fumbled the pre
vious kickoff, but the Cardinal
recovered.
"I feel bad for him," Wiggin
said of Williams. "He is a great
athlete and, if you put the ball in
his hands 100 times, a higher per
centage of good things will hap
pen than bad. We still believe in
him. It's a team sport and one
young person can't shoulder the
blame."
The fatigued Stanford defense
trudged back onto the field and it
looked like they might pull off a
goal-line stand after the Wildcats
were marched back to the 14 on
successive procedure penalties.
Defensive tackle John Bergren
dropped Johnson at the 11, mak
ing it third down and goal to go.
After a time-out, Arizona
scored on a flea-flicker giving
them the lead for good.
Tunnicliffe pitched to Holland
on a sweep right, Holland pulled
up and fired back across the field
to Tunnicliffe who was not ac
counted for in the coverage and
he easily walked in for an 11-yard
touchdown. A fourth quarter Ar
izona halfback pass had also
beaten the Cardinal last year in
Tucson.
"I knew it would be there,"
said Tunnicliffe, who suggested
the play to his coach Larry
Smith. "I was carrying out my
fakes all day on the sweeps and
nobody was acknowledging
them. We were expecting man
coverage and that doesn't leave
anyone to cover the quarter

back."
Wiggin said Stanford was pre
pared for the halfback pass.
"We were truly aware of it and
had worked on it," Wiggin said.
"It's a difficult play because the
quarterback is not counted for in
the defense. We called onto the
field 'halfback pass.' We just for
got to tell them it was to the quar
terback."
Arizona then began to pile up
the score as the Cardinal ap
peared to muddling in a foot of
snow in their end of the field.
Quarterback John Elwav and
White got their signals crossed on
a pass pattern in the next series
and Randy Robbins intercepted,
returning the ball 36 yards to the
Stanford six-vard line.
Elwav scrambled and White
had finished his pattern and was
trying to find an open spot.
Elwav guessed White would go
back to the middle, he didn't, and
Robbins was the only person
there to meet the pass. It was
Robbins'. sixth interception of
the year.
Holland scored in three plays
and the Wildcats would have
scored again after regaining
possession following a Chris
Dressel fumble, but the clock ran
out as they lined up on the Stan
ford two-vard line.

Johnson led the Arizona
ground game with 160 vards on
18 carries, including a 79-yard
touchdown breakaway early in
the game for the Wildcats's first
score.
Johnson took a pitch right, but
cut the plav back inside and burst
past the Stanford linemen and
linebackers. The Cardinal's last
defender, Darrell Grissum, was
taken out of the plav on a down
field block.
"It wasn't even against a
blitz," Wiggin said. "That's the
scarv thing."
Wiggin said he did not "feel
good" about Stanford's rhythm
on offense all day, but the first
Cardinal drive was impressive.
Stanford moved down the field
in chunks on a 20-yard comple
tion to Mike Tolliver and a dazzl
ing run by White on a screen pass
that would have put the ball at
the 14-vard line, but was moved
back on a clipping call.
The Cardinal bounced back to
pick up 14 yards on a Mike Dot
terer run and then White faked a
reverse and made another pat
ented run to the Arizona five.
But the drive stalled and the
Cardinal settled for a 22-yard
field goal by Mark Harmon.
Stanford regained the lead on a
19-vard touchdown pass to

Dressel. Picking up the blitz,
Elwav hit Dressel in the vacated
area in the middle for the score.
Safety Vaughn Williams
padded the lead two plays later,
stepping in front a Tunnicliffe
pass intended for Kevin Ward
and racing 27 yards untouched
for a touchdown and a 17-7 lead.
Arizona closed the gap with a
74-vard, 12-plav touchdown
drive in the second quarter, scor
ing on a Tunnicliffe sneak from
one yard out.
Stanford added a 28-yard
Mark Harmon field goal before
halftime and the scoreless third
quarter.
"We were better (than Arizo
na) in the first half and lousy in
the second," Wiggin said.
"That's surprising because we
have been a fairly dominant team
in the second half. Our offense
didn't plav as well as we hoped it
would and there were two or
three field position things at the
end that hurt us."
Elway completed 22-of-33
passes for 259 yards. Playing in
his last home game, he surpassed
Jim Plunkett's Pac-10 career to
tal offense record with 8411 yards
and former Purdue quarterback
Mark Herrmann's NCAA career
completion mark with 720 com
pletions.
