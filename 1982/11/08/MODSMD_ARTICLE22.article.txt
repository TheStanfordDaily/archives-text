## Flea-flicked again 
### 
When Arizona quarterback
Tom Tunnicliffe hauled in the
anvthing-but-spiral pass from
halfback Brian Holland late
in the fourth quarter Saturday
to give the Wildcats the go
ahead touchdown, a lot of
people were under the im
pression it was the game's key
play.
They were wrong.
One trick play does not a
victory make.
"We knew we had a lot of
time left. We just kept our
heads up and never gave up,"
Tunnicliffe said after the
game.

Quit patting yourself on the
back, Tommy. Neither side
hung its head or gave up.
The key plays Arizona used
to dismantle the Cardinal
41-27 were not flea flickers
and gadgets. They were not
based on vague intangibles or
philosophies. Rather, they
were the 59 punishing running
plays that piled up 302 yards,
especially the 21 in the fourth
quarter for 134 yards.
The ground game allowed
Arizona to be in position to
make the trick plays which
beat Stanford. The ground

game allowed Arizona to take
advantage of the two fourth
quarter Cardinal turnovers.
Finally, the ground game al
lowed Arizona to keep its of
fense and Stanford's tiring de
fense on the field, and John
Elwav and the Cardinal of
fense off.

The Odes Factor

"The key to today's win
was our ability to run the ball
effectively in the fourth quar
ter," said Wildcat coach
Larry Smith. "We felt their
defense really got tired in the
fourth quarter. We just kept
pounding awav."
Scrawled on the black
board in the visitors's locker
room were the words, "Find a
way to win."
The way Arizona finally
settled on was to be found be
hind the right side blocking
combination of guard Jeff
Kiewel and tackle Marsharne
Graves as Arizona runners
continually hammered the
right side successfully.
Meanwhile, Stanford be
came conservative in the third
quarter, passing the football
only three times for four
yards. The two completed
passes were both to running
backs in the flat.
Stanford was beaten by Ar
izona 17-13 in its conference
opener a year ago by, coin-
a fourth-quarter
halfback pass thrown by
Holland. With Stanford lead
ing 13-10, the Wildcats had a
fourth down-and-four at the
Cardinal 42-yard line when
Holland lofted a pass to a
wide-open flanker Bob Carter
for a touchdown and the win
ning points.
Tunnicliffe, who bounced
back from three interceptions
in the first three quarters,
called Saturday's flea flicker.
"I knew it would be there," he
said. "That's the first one of
those I've ever caught in a
game, though."
