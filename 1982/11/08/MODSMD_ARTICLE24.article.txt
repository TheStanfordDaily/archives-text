# 'Dream' tells Johnson not to give up

### ADAM BERNS 
Arizona running back Vance
Johnson never let himself get
down, even when Stanford had
apparently put the game out of
reach, taking a 27-13 lead with
12:46 left to play. He knew the
Wildcats were going to win, and
win big.
"Last week 1 was a little ner
vous about the game but Neon
(Arizona running back Edwards)
told me that he had a dream
where he saw this big white dove.
He assured me we were going to
win.
"When Stanford took the lead,
1 was down a little bit, you know.
But 1 remembered Neon
told me. We were going to beat
them and beat them bad. Then all
of a sudden we started scoring."
The dove and Stanford turn
overs notwithstanding, the main
reason for Arizona's offensive
success against Stanford was its
running game, led by Johnson's
160 yards.
Carrying the ball 18 times,
Johnson led a Wildcat running
game which frustrated and wore
down the Cardinal defense all af
ternoon. While Arizona gained
only 166 yards through the air,
the ground game netted 302.
Johnson's most spectacular
run of the day was a 79-yard
jaunt early in the first quarter. On
the play, he started wide and then
cut up a seam in the Cardinal de
fense, outrunning everybody.

"They were looking for a
sweep," Johnson explained.
"Last week we were successful
running wide against Washing
ton State. Coach Larry Smith
(Arizona's head coach) told me
to string it out as long as possible
and then cut it inside. The free
safety bit outside and behind the
block of Courtney (Griffin). I
was able to cut it up the middle."
Although Johnson is only a
sophomore and has been ham
pered by injuries this season, he
already has established himself as
a premier running back. Johnson
was a Blue Chip magazine
freshman All-America last year
and was 15th nationally in all
purpose yardage with 1577 yards,
an average of 141.5 per game.
Stanford coach Paul Wiggin
knew that Johnson was a danger
ous back, proclaiming before the
game: "He has a little bit of Dar
rin (Nelson) in him."
Asked to compare himself with
Nelson after the game, Johnson
said: "I think I'm that type of
runner. I'm a little taller than he
is but I think he is faster. Maybe
in the future I could be as good a
back as he was."
"It was an excellent per
formance," Smith said about
Johnson's running. "He has
great speed."
In the second quarter, Brian
Holland replaced Johnson and
played the entire quarter. The
.two split time, alternating plays

in the second half. Johnson
seemed to like that arrangement
better.
"I don't know why I played the
entire first quarter and Brian the
second," Johnson said. "After
that 79-yard run 1 was tired and

couldn't seem to get going after
that. I felt like it was more effec
tive switching us in on every oth
er play because I had time to
catch my breath."
Johnson caught his breath, but
the Card couldn't catch him.
