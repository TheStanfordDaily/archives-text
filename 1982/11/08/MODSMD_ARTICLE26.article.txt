# Water poloists dominate final home matches
## 
### CHRIS ADDINGTON 
Most water polo games that are 5-4 in the second quar
ter usually finish as fairly balanced contests. But, what
ever University of the Pacific had vanished, and whatever
Stanford didn't have suddenly appeared as the Cardinal
reeled off 12 unanswered goals to finish with a resound
ing 16-5 defeat over seventh-ranked UOP.
"These guys will make me old fast," said Stanford head
coach Dante Dettamanti. "I was a little concerned at the
start of the game."
UOP jumped to a quick two-goal lead before Stan
ford's James Bergeson scored from outside. One more
goal from Bergeson and two from UOP left Stanford
trailing 4-2 at the end of the first period.
Two man-advantage situations and two Jeff Stiling
tallies tied the score at four, but UOP's Mike Haley
scored on a cross-cage pass to give the Tigers the advan
tage once again.

But three goals by John Tanner and Kirk Jensen, two
by Tom Lampert and Bergeson and one apiece from Greg
Lambert and Curtis Hanst made the final score.
"We weren't really worried," said Stanford
sophomore goalkeeper Steve Moyer, "just sort of an
noyed with the way we were playing."
The Cardinal, displaying some of its finest shooting of
the year, scored on 16-of-28 shots and three-of-four on
man-up situations.
"We started out well," commented UOP head coach
Dennis Nugent. "The shots just stopped going in and we
fell apart." UOP only connected on five-of-20 shots-on
goal.
The victory was especially sweet for Cardinal seniors
Bergeson, Stiling, Lambert, Tanner, Jensen and Don
King as they played before a home crowd for the last time
in their Stanford careers.

Stanford started off the weekend Friday with a 16-8
win over UC-Davis. The Cardinal led the Aggies 10-2
before the starters came out and gave the second squad a
chance to work.
Stanford's bench outscored the Aggies 6-5 in the sec
ond half led by the efforts of freshmen Jamie Velez and
Mike Reynolds, who had two goals apiece.
In junior varsity action, Stanford's undefeated squad
extended their winning streak to 12 with resounding vic
tories over Davis by a score of 8-2 and UOP by a score of
8-4.
Stanford's biggest contests, however, lie ahead. The
Cardinal's last three games are extremely important in
order to retain its No. 2 ranking behind No. 1 UC-Irvine.
All three games are away and all three are against top
ranked Pacific-10 conference opponents USC, UCLA
and UC-Berkeley. â€¢
