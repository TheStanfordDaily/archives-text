# Officials agree on hospital consolidation
## 
### 
The plan to consolidate the Chil
dren's Hospital at Stanford (CHAS)
and the pediatric department of the
Stanford University Hospital (SUH)
was formally agreed upon last Thurs
day at a signing ceremony.
The contract was signed by Univer
sity President Donald Kennedy, SUH
President Lawrence Crowley and Ken
neth Sayre, chairman of the CHAS
board. The agreement creates a corpo
ration to operate the new children's
hospital and authorizes planning for
construction of the facility.
"Just like a marriage courtship, we
have spent the past year getting to know

each other's needs and expectations,
and we are now joyously celebrating a
bonding of our goals and interests,"
said Crowley, who is also the Univer
sity's vice president for medical affairs.
"And like a marriage, we must
marshal the groundwork and bond thus
far achieved to forge an ongoing rela
tionship," he added.
Informal discussions about develop
ment of a single children's medical cen
ter have been going on for many years,
but formal planning began only last
November. Issues leading to the merger
included rising costs, concerns about
duplication of services and the problem

of transporting patients the one-mile
distance between the two hospitals.
The new $40 million facility, planned
to be completed by May 1987, will be
physically attached to SUH, but will
adopt the name Children's Hospital at
Stanford. The 60 beds of CHAS and the
44 pediatric acute medical-surgical and
pediatric intensive-care beds of SUH
will be housed in the new facility, along
with the Stanford Children's Am
bulatory Care Center, which operates
27 clinics.
Inpatient services in the 15 specialties
now offered by both hospitals will also
be provided.

The facility's final planning and con
struction will be guided by a recently,
appointed board of directors, consist
ing of 10 members â€” five from each of
the existing CHAS and SUH boards.
Crowley will be ex officio chairman of
the board until the hospital opens.
"We will now get on with the busi
ness of taking two dynamic institutions
and creating a new entity which is even
greater than the sum of its original
parts," Sayre said.
However, state and local agencies
must conduct a review process and ap
prove the consolidation before con
struction of the facility begins.
