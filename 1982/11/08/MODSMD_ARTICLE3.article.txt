if negative votes cast. "I really can't figure
had expected it to be really close," said

Debra Harris, a hospital worker and chairperson of
the organizing committee. "I hadn't expected us to
lose like this at all."
Hospital workers were urged to vote against join
ing the union by hospitalmanagement, which op
poses union representation of hospital workers by
any union.
"The hospital is not interested in union represen
tation at the hospital," Robinson said.
"It was a vote of confidence in the hospital. Hos
pital management felt, as the employees expressed,
that working directly with our employees is the best
way to conduct business," he said. Nurses are the
only hospital employees currently represented by a
union.
Union leaders blamed the University's anti-union
campaign tactics, the negative effect of USW's re
cent strike, and the lack of union organizers among
hospital workers.
"The overriding reason for the vote was they were
afraid," Baratz said.
"Fear got instilled in them through the (Univer
sity's) campaign. They were told that if they voted
for the union something bad would happen to
them," he said.
During the past two weeks, the union and the
University have distributed numerous flyers to
workers in the hospital and to their homes in an ef
fort to sway the election.
"Almost every day they come out with some

thing," said hospital worker Mary Ann Garcia.
"Whenever something comes out from man
agement, then the union comes out with something
correcting what they said."
University flyers told workers that if the union
won the election workers would have to pay dues,
would be forced to go out on strikes, would be sub
ject to fines and would not be guaranteed higher
wages and benefits.
"Reject this bid for your DUES by voting NO on
November 5 or 6," one University flyer said.
Union fivers told workers if they joined USW
they could Rave fairer hiring practices, scheduling
by seniority, guaranteed hours, paid holidays, guar
anteed benefits and a stronger voice in the hospital's
operations.
Hospital worker Mark Clark said despite the del
uge of propaganda, workers were still confused
about the implications of unionization.
Union leaders said that hospital managers were
successful in making workers think they would be
forced to go out on strike frequently if they joined
the union.
"That's one of the biggest tools management
used. The (recent) strike scared a lot of people,"
Harris said. "I don't care what else we tell them
about wages, when they see that union go on strike,
they don't want it," she said.
University Labor Counsel Priscilla Wheeler said
the University urged workers to vote
against joining USW because it is an ir
responsible union.
"Their strike was an irresponsible act
and we would not like to see that kind ot
union at Stanford University Hospital.
It was not necessary to achieve a settle
ment," Wheeler said.
Union leaders said the strike was not
irresponsible.
Another University flyer had a chart
showing that wages are lower at Valley
Medical Center in San Jose where
workers are represented by USW's
union than they are at Stanford Hospi
tal. Union organizer Harris said the
chart "was the thing that really did it."
Harris said the comparison was un
fair because Valley Medical is a public
hospital.
Organizer Harris said two previous

attempts by other unions to organize
hospital workers has "burned out"
many workers.
Union organizers said a group of
about 20 workers approached the union
two years ago asking for help in resolv
ing grievances against the hospital.
The union filed about 20 unfair labor
practice charges against the University
for incidents last fall that occurred
while the union sought workers' signa
tures, required before an election could
be held. The National Labor Relations
Board's (NLRB) regional director filed
a complaint againt the University and a
notice of hearing for two of the charges.
The charges centered on two separate
incidents in which the union claimed a
supervisor unlawfully questioned a
worker about his reason for supporting
the union.
The NLRB's future ruling on the in
cidents will not affect the election be
cause they took place before the elec
tion was scheduled.

if negative votes cast. "I really can't figure
had expected it to be really close," said

Debra Harris, a hospital worker and chairperson of
the organizing committee. "I hadn't expected us to
lose like this at all."
Hospital workers were urged to vote against join
ing the union by hospitalmanagement, which op
poses union representation of hospital workers by
any union.
"The hospital is not interested in union represen
tation at the hospital," Robinson said.
"It was a vote of confidence in the hospital. Hos
pital management felt, as the employees expressed,
that working directly with our employees is the best
way to conduct business," he said. Nurses are the
only hospital employees currently represented by a
union.
Union leaders blamed the University's anti-union
campaign tactics, the negative effect of USW's re
cent strike, and the lack of union organizers among
hospital workers.
"The overriding reason for the vote was they were
afraid," Baratz said.
"Fear got instilled in them through the (Univer
sity's) campaign. They were told that if they voted
for the union something bad would happen to
them," he said.
During the past two weeks, the union and the
University have distributed numerous flyers to
workers in the hospital and to their homes in an ef
fort to sway the election.
"Almost every day they come out with some

thing," said hospital worker Mary Ann Garcia.
"Whenever something comes out from man
agement, then the union comes out with something
correcting what they said."
University flyers told workers that if the union
won the election workers would have to pay dues,
would be forced to go out on strikes, would be sub
ject to fines and would not be guaranteed higher
wages and benefits.
"Reject this bid for your DUES by voting NO on
November 5 or 6," one University flyer said.
Union fivers told workers if they joined USW
they could Rave fairer hiring practices, scheduling
by seniority, guaranteed hours, paid holidays, guar
anteed benefits and a stronger voice in the hospital's
operations.
Hospital worker Mark Clark said despite the del
uge of propaganda, workers were still confused
about the implications of unionization.
Union leaders said that hospital managers were
successful in making workers think they would be
forced to go out on strike frequently if they joined
the union.
"That's one of the biggest tools management
used. The (recent) strike scared a lot of people,"
Harris said. "I don't care what else we tell them
about wages, when they see that union go on strike,
they don't want it," she said.
University Labor Counsel Priscilla Wheeler said
the University urged workers to vote
against joining USW because it is an ir
responsible union.
"Their strike was an irresponsible act
and we would not like to see that kind ot
union at Stanford University Hospital.
It was not necessary to achieve a settle
ment," Wheeler said.
Union leaders said the strike was not
irresponsible.
Another University flyer had a chart
showing that wages are lower at Valley
Medical Center in San Jose where
workers are represented by USW's
union than they are at Stanford Hospi
tal. Union organizer Harris said the
chart "was the thing that really did it."
Harris said the comparison was un
fair because Valley Medical is a public
hospital.
Organizer Harris said two previous

attempts by other unions to organize
hospital workers has "burned out"
many workers.
Union organizers said a group of
about 20 workers approached the union
two years ago asking for help in resolv
ing grievances against the hospital.
The union filed about 20 unfair labor
practice charges against the University
for incidents last fall that occurred
while the union sought workers' signa
tures, required before an election could
be held. The National Labor Relations
Board's (NLRB) regional director filed
a complaint againt the University and a
notice of hearing for two of the charges.
The charges centered on two separate
incidents in which the union claimed a
supervisor unlawfully questioned a
worker about his reason for supporting
the union.
