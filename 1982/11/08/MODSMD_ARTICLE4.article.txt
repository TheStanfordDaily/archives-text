Stanford University Hospital
lo have saved the life of a 40-
man suffering from a con
tart abnormality.
dGrunden, a computer techni
-1 Ventura, was listed in critical
c condition yesterday after Fri
iration.
Cioodkind, a hospital spokes-

man, said that Grunden was taken off
the respirator on the morning following
the operation, an indication that he is
recovering quickly.
Heart-lung recipients are "auto
matically determined critical because of
the relatively new nature of the opera
tion," Goodkind said, and generally re
main in intensive care for about a week.
Grunden was born with a ventricular
septal defect — a heart abnormality
which now can be corrected by surgery

during early childhood. A hole between
the two chambers of the heart led to an
overcirculation of blood in the lungs
and increased pressure in the
pulmonary arteries — the arteries that
carry blood from the heart to the lungs.
Grunden's heart and lungs had dete
riorated to the extent that a transplant
was necessary to save his life. The five
hour operation was conducted by Dr.
Stuart Jamieson, assistant professor of
cardiovascular surgery and director of

the heart-lung program.
There are presently four or five peo
ple waiting for heart-lung donors, ac
cording to Goodkind, and in the past
few months, several.patients have died
because of the lack of donors.
The first heart-lung transplant, done
on March 9, 1981, t at Stanford, was
made possible after the development of
a drug called cyclosporine that aids in
fighting infection.
