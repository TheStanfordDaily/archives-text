Israel authorized militia reentry
Jerusalem — Despite reports of civilian casual
ities, the Israeli army allowed Lebanese Christian
militia units in the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps
of West Beirut to bring in fresh troops and restock
their ammunition supplies during the second day
of the massacre there, a senior Israeli army officer
said yesterday.
Brig. Gen. Amos Yaron, the commander of all
Israeli forces in the Beirut area, said he authorized
the resupply and troop rotation operation even af
ter he and a superior, Maj. Gen. Amir Drori, had
become uneasy about the militiamen's behavior
and initially had ordered a halt to the militia units'
activities in the camps.
But Yaron, testifying before the state judicial
board of inquiry that is investigating the Septem
ber massacre of hundreds of Palestinian refugees in
the camps, said that by then he presumed that most
civilians had fled from the area.
Prime Minister Menachem Begin is scheduled to
testify publicly before the inquiry board today.
Yaron, who at times was visibly nervous, testi
fied for an hour in public before the three-member
commission and for another 90 minutes in private.
His public testimony raised anew the question of
whythe Israelis, alerted as early as the night of
Thursday, Sept. 16, to the possibility of heavy civil
ian casualties, allowed the Christian Phalangist
militia units to remain in the Palestinian neighbor
hoods until the morning of Saturday, Sept. 18.
Soviets parade new weapons
Moscow — The Soviet Union rolled a brawny
display of military hardware through Red Square
Sunday in Revolution Day festivities President
Leonid Brezhnev said should "cool the hot heads
of some imperialist politicians."
Soviet generals displayed two weapons never
before seen at the parade — an improved surface
to-air missile and an updated armored personnel
carrier reportedly in use against Moslem in
surgents in Afghanistan. Hundreds of thousands
of Muscovites jammed the cobblestone square to
watch the show.

Defense Minister Marshal Dmitri Ustinov, 74,
presided over the military ceremonies marking the
65th anniversary of the Bolshevik Revolution,
which led to the founding of the Soviet state. He
stood beside the 75-year-old Brezhnev atop the red
marble mausoleum of revolutionary leader
Vladimir Lenin.
Ustinov and Brezhnev both denounced the
United States in tough speeches that showed no
sign of easing the Kremlin's anti-American
rhetoric.
Afterwards, at a Kremlin reception attended by
U.S. Ambassador Arthur Hartman, Brezhnev
warned,"We shall do the utmost to see to it that
those who like military ventures should never take
the land of the Soviets unawares, that the potential
aggressor should know: a crushing retaliatory
strike will inevitably be in for him. Our might and
vigilance will cool, I think, the hot heads of some
imperialist politicians."
Iranians advance into Iraq
Tehran — Iranian forces yesterday pushed about
six miles into Iraqi territory as an offensive
launched the night before in the Ein Khosh region
of north Khuzistan continued, Iranian television
reported.
A joint communique from the Iranian army and
Revolutionary Guards said more than 2000 Iraqis
had been killed in the thrust, bringing to 6000 the
number killed in the "Moharam" offensive
launched Nov. I.
The communique added that 1500 new prisoners
had been taken, adding to the 1900 already seized
in the offensive. It said that three Iraqi planes were
shot down, and one of the pilots was captured.
Iranian parliament speaker Hashemi Rafsan
jani, who serves as the Ayatollah Ruhollah Kho
meini's representative on the country's Supreme
Defense Council, said yesterday there could be no
peace until Iran's rights were recognized, the
Tehran TV program reported.
U.S. aids Bolivia's drug busts
Washington — The United States is offering
Bolivia's new government about $140 million in

aid as the South American nation cracks down on
its narcotics producers and traffickers, and turns
over to American authorities a Bolivian whom
U.S. officials allege is a major international co
caine dealer.
The aid package, according to U.S. officials, in
cludes $30 million for narcotics enforcement and
agricultural redevelopment to replace the growing
of coca leaf in Bolivia's Chapare region. Although
the Bolivian economy is on the verge of collapse,
the country of 5.5 million people is the source of
billions of dollars of illegal cocaine sold in the
United States.
The remaining $110 million in economic aid
rests on Bolivia's agreement to economic reforms
sought by the International Monetary Fund and
major banks.
The U.S. aid offer comes at a time when the new
ly elected, democratic government of President
Siles Zuazo in La Paz is beginning to do something
about Bolivia's illegal drug business, according to
American officials who said last week that the aid
is contingent on Bolivia accomplishing specified
goals in narcotics control and economic reform.
Bradley concedes to Deukmejian
Los Angeles — Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley
conceded defeat Saturday in the gubernatorial race
and announced that he would not ask for a recount
of the ballots cast in Tuesday's election.
Bradley's campaign manager, Nelson Rising,
said the mayor and his campaign staff decided, "a
recount would not reveal significant miscalcula
tions, and it doesn't appear that any reported vot
ing irregularities were sufficient enough to warrant
recount or contesting."
Rising said that Bradley had been prepared to
concede the election on Wednesday morning, but
his advisers had talked him into considering the
possibility of a recount.
Today's weather
