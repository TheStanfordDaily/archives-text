# Stanford officials optimistic
## University reapplying for cloning patent 
### MARK GILLIS 
The Office of Technology Licensing
is optimistic that the U.S. Patent Office
will reconsider and issue the University
a patent for gene splicing and cloning
techniques in response to a 22-r>age
amendment submitted by the Univer
sity two weeks ago.
"They (Patent Office officials)
brought up some valid issues, but we
feel that the response we sent answers
very adequately all the issues and that
now they should see our point of view,"
said Katharine Ku, University patent
adviser. Licensing office Director Niels
Reimers also said he expected approval
from the U.S. Patent Office.
The technique under debate was the
creation of Genetics Prof. Stanley
Cohen, and Herbert Hoyer, a
biochemist from UC-San Francisco. In
1980 the Patent Office awarded them
a patent for earlier work in gene cloning
which has since brought $1.4 million to
Stanford and UCSF.
In August, the Patent Office denied
Stanford a patent for Boyer and
Cohen's more recent gene cloning and
splicing process. With three months to
respond, the licensing office wrote the
reply, which the Patent Office received

on Nov. I.
The first objection offered by the Pat
ent Office was that it wasn't "enabl
ing," Ku said. "It (the patent) has to
teach a person of ordinary skills in the
art how to make and use an invention.
Like a contract party, the government
excludes others from using that inven
tion if you've properly disclosed how to
make and use it." Asked why it was not
enabling, Ku said, "That gets into a
very technical part of it."

Several professors, including
Bernard Weisblum of the University of
Wisconsin and Stanley Falkow and
David Hogness of Stanford, have made
declarations that, in their opinion, this
patent is enabling.
Ku believes that the Patent Office's
second objection, the "Darwinian" is
sue, was not valid because it was not
based on proven data.
"They claim the process occurs in na
ture; if it did, and it's only theoretical, it
would occur over thousands of years.
We're claiming man's intervention to
make something happen." She also
feels that the objections come from a
bias in past vears which viewed DNA
manipulation as a potential risk.
The controversy caused by Prof.
Robert Helling of Michigan over co-in
ventorship was the third hurdle. Hell
ing, who co-authored a paper on the
process with Bover, Cohen and Annie
Chang, a genetics research associate,
has stated that he should also get credit
for the invention.
The Licensing Office requested proof
of his claims. "Since he fails to come
forward with evidence," Ku said, "he
really shouldn't be an inventor. It is a le
gal definition: someone who has con

tributed a significant portion to the
conception of an invention."
If given, the patent would create rev
enue for Stanford that would be used
for research and education. After 15
percent of the money is taken for ad
ministrative expenses, the remainder is
divided evenly between the University,
the department and Cohen. Cohen was
not available to comment on the issue,
but Ku said, "His portion is primarily
devoted to felowships."
Should the Patent Office reject this
amendment, the University could still
reply until the Patent Office decides
there no longer remains a valid argu
ment.
"Patent prosecution is just a give and
take thing," Ku said. "We would
pursue it further in case they don't ac
cept our present application." As the
Patent Office has no deadline, it is not
known when it will respond.
Ku explained Cohen's and Bover's
collaboration: "Thev put two pieces of
the puzzle together Boyer was working
with restriction enzvmes, which cut
I)NA in certain places; Cchen was
working with plasmids, a vector which
allows you to add DNA to an or
ganism."

creation of Genetics Prof. Stanley
Cohen, and Herbert Hoyer, a
biochemist from UC-San Francisco. In
1980 the Patent Office awarded them
a patent for earlier work in gene cloning
which has since brought $1.4 million to
Stanford and UCSF.
In August, the Patent Office denied
Stanford a patent for Boyer and
Cohen's more recent gene cloning and
splicing process. With three months to
respond, the licensing office wrote the
reply, which the Patent Office received

on Nov. I.
The first objection offered by the Pat
ent Office was that it wasn't "enabl
ing," Ku said. "It (the patent) has to
teach a person of ordinary skills in the
art how to make and use an invention.
Like a contract party, the government
excludes others from using that inven
tion if you've properly disclosed how to
make and use it." Asked why it was not
enabling, Ku said, "That gets into a
very technical part of it."

Several professors, including
Bernard Weisblum of the University of
Wisconsin and Stanley Falkow and
David Hogness of Stanford, have made
declarations that, in their opinion, this
patent is enabling.
Ku believes that the Patent Office's
second objection, the "Darwinian" is
sue, was not valid because it was not
based on proven data.
"They claim the process occurs in na
ture; if it did, and it's only theoretical, it
would occur over thousands of years.
We're claiming man's intervention to
make something happen." She also
feels that the objections come from a
bias in past vears which viewed DNA
manipulation as a potential risk.
The controversy caused by Prof.
Robert Helling of Michigan over co-in
ventorship was the third hurdle. Hell
ing, who co-authored a paper on the
process with Bover, Cohen and Annie
Chang, a genetics research associate,
has stated that he should also get credit
for the invention.
The Licensing Office requested proof
of his claims. "Since he fails to come
forward with evidence," Ku said, "he
really shouldn't be an inventor. It is a le
gal definition: someone who has con

tributed a significant portion to the
conception of an invention."
If given, the patent would create rev
enue for Stanford that would be used
for research and education. After 15
percent of the money is taken for ad
ministrative expenses, the remainder is
divided evenly between the University,
the department and Cohen. Cohen was
not available to comment on the issue,
but Ku said, "His portion is primarily
devoted to felowships."
Should the Patent Office reject this
amendment, the University could still
reply until the Patent Office decides
there no longer remains a valid argu
ment.
"Patent prosecution is just a give and
take thing," Ku said. "We would
pursue it further in case they don't ac
cept our present application." As the
Patent Office has no deadline, it is not
known when it will respond.
Ku explained Cohen's and Bover's
collaboration: "Thev put two pieces of
the puzzle together Boyer was working
with restriction enzvmes, which cut
I)NA in certain places; Cchen was
working with plasmids, a vector which
allows you to add DNA to an or
ganism."
