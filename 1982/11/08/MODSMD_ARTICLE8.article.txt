## Spain: Leftward shift spurs democracy; problems linger Socialist party garners overwhelming support 
### 
Compiled from news reports an J *ire ser
vices
For the first time in four dec
ades, Spain will have a leftist gov
ernment after a clear victory bv
the Spanish Socialist Workers
Party (PSOE) in recent elections.
It was the third freely elected
government since Gen. Francis
co Franco's death, and an indica
tion that the once-tenuous de
mocracy established in that
country is now strengthening. A
record voter turnout of 79.5 per
cent voted an absolute majority
of 201 seats for the PSOE in the
350-member Cortes, the lower
house of Parliament and main
ruling body.
The chief opposition will be
the Alianza Popular, a right-wing
party which ran a strong second
with 106 seats. The Communists
won onlv five seats.

Despite fears of another coup
attempt bv thefranquista military
faction after the one uncovered
last month, the three-week cam
paign went relatively smoothly.
Much of the public enthusiasm
was focused on the new prime
minister, Felipe Gonzalez, who
shuttled through the country on a
grueling 25-day campaign and
projected an image of reason
ableness, honesty and mod
eration. At 40, Gonzalez will be
the youngest European head of
government.
From the Socialist electoral
platform, the Andalusian lawyer
called for a plan to fight un
employment as the first priority,
but not by sweeping nationaliza
tions akin to the situation in
France. Indeed, the only segment
of the economy proposed for na
tionalization electric power
network.

Instead, the party plans a tight
ly controlled state credit program
to support small- to medium-size
business investment in depressed
areas, and thus create 800,000
jobs over the next four years.
Even though Spain has dem
onstrated the ability to move
peacefully to the left, there is still
a danger that army hardliners
could try to upset the delicate
transition period before the So
cialists officially take over next
month.
On Oct. 3, 1982, three officers
were arrested and accused of
trying to seize the government on
election eve. In 1981 two officers
were jailed for an attempted
coup, and other officers were
transferred to new posts.
The army, however, is largely
monarchist and respectful of the
king's authority. Thus King Juan
Carlos, an ardent supporter of

democracy, acts as an essential
buffer between the civilian and
military authorities in Spain. It
was he who personally thwarted
the 1981 coup; and although
Gonzalez is not considered an
avid monarchist, his Socialist
government is expected to seek
the king's counsel in future con
frontations with the military. For
now, the tension is expected to
persist until the king summons
the new Parliament, which is ex
pected to happen by Nov. 22.
Another major problem which
the Socialists inherit is the failing
economy, recession-bound with
16 percent unemployment and 12
percent inflation.
The Bank of Spain outlined an
economic stabilization plan with
wage limitations and tighter fis
cal and monetary policies last
week, and economists feel that

there is little choice but to accept
the austere measures.
This constraint, however, will
leave Gonzalez little space to im
plement Socialist programs.
Furthermore, the new govern
ment faces continuing threats of
Basque terrorism and bitter de
bates over Socialist proposals to
legalize abortion.
In the wake of Socialist vic
tories in France, Greece and Swe
den, the Spanish elections were
closely watched in other interna
tional capitals as a swing to the
left in Western European poli
tics.
Some analysts, however, have
suggested that voting trends
toward the left are more a result
of widespread economic prob
lems which work against incum
bent governments.

last month, the three-week cam
paign went relatively smoothly.
Much of the public enthusiasm
was focused on the new prime
minister, Felipe Gonzalez, who
shuttled through the country on a
grueling 25-day campaign and
projected an image of reason
ableness, honesty and mod
eration. At 40, Gonzalez will be
the youngest European head of
government.
From the Socialist electoral
platform, the Andalusian lawyer
called for a plan to fight un
employment as the first priority,
but not by sweeping nationaliza
tions akin to the situation in
France. Indeed, the only segment
of the economy proposed for na
tionalization electric power
network.

Instead, the party plans a tight
ly controlled state credit program
to support small- to medium-size
business investment in depressed
areas, and thus create 800,000
jobs over the next four years.
Even though Spain has dem
onstrated the ability to move
peacefully to the left, there is still
a danger that army hardliners
could try to upset the delicate
transition period before the So
cialists officially take over next
month.
On Oct. 3, 1982, three officers
were arrested and accused of
trying to seize the government on
election eve. In 1981 two officers
were jailed for an attempted
coup, and other officers were
transferred to new posts.
The army, however, is largely
monarchist and respectful of the
king's authority. Thus King Juan
Carlos, an ardent supporter of

democracy, acts as an essential
buffer between the civilian and
military authorities in Spain. It
was he who personally thwarted
the 1981 coup; and although
Gonzalez is not considered an
avid monarchist, his Socialist
government is expected to seek
the king's counsel in future con
frontations with the military. For
now, the tension is expected to
persist until the king summons
the new Parliament, which is ex
pected to happen by Nov. 22.
Another major problem which
the Socialists inherit is the failing
economy, recession-bound with
16 percent unemployment and 12
percent inflation.
The Bank of Spain outlined an
economic stabilization plan with
wage limitations and tighter fis
cal and monetary policies last
week, and economists feel that

there is little choice but to accept
the austere measures.
This constraint, however, will
leave Gonzalez little space to im
plement Socialist programs.
Furthermore, the new govern
ment faces continuing threats of
Basque terrorism and bitter de
bates over Socialist proposals to
legalize abortion.
In the wake of Socialist vic
tories in France, Greece and Swe
den, the Spanish elections were
closely watched in other interna
tional capitals as a swing to the
left in Western European poli
tics.
Some analysts, however, have
suggested that voting trends
toward the left are more a result
of widespread economic prob
lems which work against incum
bent governments.
