Compiled from news reports and wire services
In an act that is Feared could trigger a military
move against Spain's new socialist government
two men on a motorcycle assassinated a top
Spanish general in a hail of submachine-gun fire
Thursday.
Gen. Victor Lago Roman, 63-year-old com
mander of the elite Brunete First Armored
Division, was shot as he was being driven to
work on a busy residential street near Madrid's
Arch of Triumph. The career officer who
spurned body guards died instantly, according
to the Madrid civilian governor's office. The
gunmen then sped away through traffic, wit
nesses told police.
Prime suspects in the assassination are
Basque terrorists, but there was no immediate
claim of responsibility offered after the killing.
Sixteen 9-millimeter parabellum shell casings
were found lying near the general's black sedan.
The ammunition is the same used in the past by
ETA-M, the radical military wing of the Basque
separatist organization.
The Basque separatist organization has been
at odds with Spanish government throughout
modern history and has long sought autonomy
from Spain. A new Spanish constitution
adopted in 1978 provided for the establishment
of autonomous regions beginning in 1980, but
when the government slowed the full implemen
tation of \\m\led se\f-ru\e unlit \983, the Basque
Nationalist party refused to participate in Na

tional Assembly proceedings. Insurgents from
the northern region of Spain have since been
fighting for independence from the Spanish na
tion.
On Friday, the president of the Basque re
gion, Carlos Garaicoechea, who is also head of
the centrist Basque Nationalist Party, called the
killing of Lago Roman "a crime and an ex
ecrable provocation."
Responding to the killing, Socialist Premier
elect Felipe Gonzalez also termed the killing "a
provocation." He said that if the attackers were
trying to challenge "the new majority chosen by
the Spanish people," his government would
"use all means at the disposal of the democratic
state to do away with the scourge of terrorism."
Gonzalez and his Socialist Workers' Party
won an overwhelming victory a week ago in
general elections that guaranteed them a ma
jority in Parliament for the first time in Spanish
history. After the victory Gonzalez said that
"pacification" of the Basque region and banish
ing Spain's "coup mentality" would be Socialist
priorities.
Only hours after the killing, Pope John Paul
11, who was in the midst of his 10-day tour of the
Spanish provinces, offered prayers forjhe slain
general. In his homily at a large oudoor mass in
western Spain the pope departed from his pre
pared sermon to address the attending 150,000
worshipers.
"Before ending rrty WordS I'vvdftttolhvite'yotf

to raise a prayer for the last victim — and all the
victims — of terrorism in Spain." The pope said
Spain finds itself "wounded in its aspiration to
see itself rid of the painful phenomenon of ter
rorism. Everyone should understand that vio
lence is not the way to the solution of human
problems," he said.
The pope has been under extremely tight se
curity during his visit to Spain — a trip that
began only three days after the country elected
its first Socialist government since the eve of the
bloody civil war in 1936 which left scars still not
altogether healed in Spain.
Lago Roman's Brunete division is considered
to be a hotbed of the far right-wing within the
army's officer corps. The previous commander
of the division was Lt. Gen. Jaime Milans del
Bosch, who was sentenced to 30 years imprison
ment for his role in an abortive military coup in
February 1981.
Gen. Prudencio Pedrosa Sobrado, who will
succeed Lago Roman as commander of the
division, said the army hoped the government
would "take the necessary measures to finish
once and for all with this situation. The role of
the armed forces is to defend the integrity of the
fatherland and we shall respect the established
constitutional order," he said.
