# 500 possible guest profs
## McCloskey tops list 
### KATHERINE HUTT Senior staff writer 
Rep. Paul McCloskey (R-Menlo
Park) will be one of 500 names on a list
of prospective guest professors that the
ASSU Guest Professorship Bureau will
submit to the senate for approval to
night, according to recently instituted
Bureau Director Seth Linfield.
Members of the bureau had initiated

discussions with McCloskey about the
possibility of his teaching at Stanford
before Linfield's arrival, and "Mc-
Closkey had independently expressed
an interest in serving as a guest pro
fessor," according to Linfield.
McCloskey said he has corresponded

with the bureau about the issue, and he
has "told them that I'd enjoy doing it."
Linfield added, "Just having come
into this position, I do not see any defi
ciencies with McCloskey's quali
fications. He certainly would be an as
set to the University and a valuable re
source to the students. In addition, we
â€¢ very much appreciate his eagerness to
teach here. However, nothing definite
has vet been set up and a lot of other
people are being considered."
McCloskey was defeated in his bid
for the U.S. Senate in the June primary
and his congressional term of office of
ficially ends Jan. 3. He announced last
week that he will resume practicing law,
after a hiatus of 15 years, when he be
comes a partner in the San Francisco
firm of Brobeck Phleger & Harrison in
January.
McCloskey has long been associated
with the University. He received both
his undergraduate and law degrees
here, and he practiced here from 1957
until he ran for Congress in 1967. He
also taught at the Law School here, as
well as at UC-Berkeley's Boalt Hall.
McCloskey said he would like to
teach a course here through the Politi
cal Science Department, covering ma
jor events of the last 20 years. He would
examine events from the Cuban missile
crisis through the Israeli invasion of
Lebanon, considering the decisions
