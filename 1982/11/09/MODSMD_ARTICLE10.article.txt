## The 						Stanford Daily Big money and the media blitz 
### 
Two of the hotly contested proposition races in
the election repeated a familiar political pattern. In
the campaigns for Proposition 11, the mandatory
beverage container deposit law, and Proposition
15, the handgun control initiative, the side with the
overwhelming spending advantage overcame a def
icit in the polls by staging a final media blitz to cap
ture the election.
Although polls on these measures taken before
the election showed a fair number of undecided vot
ers, both initiatives did enjoy substantial leads prior
to the election. For instance, a statewide poll on
Proposition 11 taken in mid-September showed
twice as many people favoring the initiative as op
posing it. Similar polls taken before the election
found that Proposition 15 held a wide margin of
support.
However, the popularity of these initiatives
began to erode as their opponents' huge funding
advantages took effect. Opponents of the deposit
initiative — corporate groups such as bottling com
panies and grocery chains — raised more than 10
times as much money as those in favor of the bill.
This disadvantage was made even more pro
nounced by a practice of some supermarket chains
of printing signs on shopping bags urging voters to
defeat the proposition.
The campaign surrounding the handgun control
initiative was marked by a similar disparity in fund
ing, caused largely by the efforts of the initiative's
well-organized opponent, the NRA, which pumped
millions of dollars into the race.
Wide funding differences were not unique to

these two proposition campaigns: many races for
state and national offices had lopsided levels of fun
ding.
Although there are many reasons why this type of
discrepancy exists, in the Proposition 11 campaign
spending differences were caused by corporations'
ability to invest heavily against the measure. On the
other hand, the campaign against Proposition 15
was financed largely through the efforts of an effi
cient popular organization.
Although the races were funded by different
sources, the decisive factor in both was the use of
the same tactic: a final media advertising blitz. It
was this last-minute advertising saturation that dis
torted the issues and in many cases misled voters.
As often occurs in a heated campaign, partisans
used artistic license in describing the far-reaching
consequences of an initiative. Unfortunately, the
way these initiatives were portrayed by their oppo
nents bore little resemblance to the legislative ana
lyst's description of them in the state voter pam
phlet.
While voters are best served by large amounts of
information and there is a wide range of interpreta
tions of laws governing the campaigns, there should'
be limits on how far both sides can take those in
terpretations. Without a system that would allow
an impartial panel to screen election material, vot
ers need to be particularly aware of the amount of
misinformation being circulated and make a special
effort to base their vote on views from all sides —
not just the side with money.
