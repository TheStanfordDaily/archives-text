# Jerry Brown for Stanford
## 
### 
Dear Jerry Brown,
Well, we gave it our best shot, but you still man
aged to blow it. We commanded our most long
winded editorialist to endorse you for the Senate.
Boy, were we shocked when our pronouncement
failed to tip the balance in your favor. As Stanford
goes, so goes California — or so we thought.
Never mind, Jerry, for all is forgiven. We don't
hold any grudges against you for making us look
foolish. To the contrary, we want to offer you a
unique path to redemption and a really neat op
portunity for your very long future.
We recently read in one of the San Francisco
newspapers that you would just love to teach at a
genuinely first-rate university for a term or two.
Hell, Jerry, why didn't you just say so in the first
place? Stanford awaits you with open arms!
Just think of all the interesting and provocative
courses that you could teach in the various schools
and departments of the University:
Law School — "Creative Judicial Appointments:
Sacramento Follies and the California Bench";
Biological sciences — "Impact of Medfly Mating
Cycles Upon the Comeback of the Gadfly";
Political science — "New Age Politics:
Mushroom Clouds and Modern Electioneering";
Come on, old boy, be a sport! Just think of all the
joys and advantages of the Stanford life-style. We'll
build a private ashram for you, complete with
redwood hot-tub and Buddhist worry beads, in the

Faculty Ghetto. When spring arrives, you can prac
tice you contemplative arts by walking on the wa
ters of Lake Lagunita. As for TAs, we'll rent a few
retired NASA astro-chimps from Moffett Field.
These furry workaholics and creative risk-takers
will considerably lighten your teaching load — they
work cheap, don't talk back and would never
dream of writing negative memoirs that would be
critical of you.
In the weeks ahead, Jerry, drooling Ivy League
predators will attempt to entice you to go East.
Heed our warning, Guv, and don't trip over the
deep wolf tracks at your door. Why should you
fight mid-life crises in the company of those uppity
snobs at Harvard? They'll only'age you at a faster
rate; a little grey at the temples is very dist
inguishing, but don't go overboard. Face it, wa
tercress sandwiches and cardigan sweaters just
aren't your style.
Look, Jerry, you can have a great little rest at
Stanford, a period for recuperation and regenera
tion. If the Farm failed to break John Anderson
and George Shultz, it certainly won't hurt you.
If you're still in doubt, Jerry, just give us a call at
The Stanford Daily, 497-4632 (ask for Richard),
and then we can have a nice little chat.
Honestly, Jerry, when filtered through a Cardinal
prism, moonbeams can cast a beautiful light.
Peace and Love,
The editorial board
