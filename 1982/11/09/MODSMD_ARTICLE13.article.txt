# The 						Question Mark Mark Soble
## A 						manipulated military policy 
### 
Soviet advances in Afghanistan and
the Soviet Union's military buildup
during the 1970s were major con
tributors to Ronald Reagan's election
as president. Only the economy seemed
to be a more pressing matter to the gen
eral populace. But, despite fears of mili
tary inferiority, it appears that
stastistics have been manipulated and
manufactured.
• Another example seems to have oc
curred less than two weeks ago. Ap
parently the Reagan administration
found that a Military Manpower Task
Force report justified a continuation of
peacetime draft registration. But Selec
tive Service spokesmen now report that
their director might have made an error
in his statement. Recently, Pentagon of
ficials confirmed that no recommenda
tions were made on the current regis
tration system.
Yet Reagan insists that in almost all
areas we need to play "catch-up." This
is a little difficult to swallow because the
cruise missile, Trident submarine and
other U.S. technological innovations
far surpass Soviet technology. In fact, it
is widely believed that American
ICBMs were as capable in the 1960s as
many Soviet ICBMs are today.
Further, the aircraft of the Soviet
Union and the United States are simply
not comparable. This has been demon
strated in combat when Israel and Iran
have used outdated U.S. planes and de
feated enemies using more recent Soviet
aircraft.
One problem at the ballot box seems
to be that many people still believe that

pumping money into the military will
eventually benefit the economy (espe
cially as opposed to social program
spending). Common ideology will have
it that military spending wili stimulate
the economy — as does other spending.
This is not so. Military spending does
not contribute to the level of living or
foster production.

Additionally, military spending will
not create jobs. This money stays within
the military industry; in effect, there
fore, it does not contribute to civilian
welfare. And although this may lead to
a bigger GNP, a bigger GNP means
nothing without the creation of useful
goods and services or an improvement
in the standard of living.
Nor are the military contractors simi
lar to their corporate counterparts. In
deed, most military firms are involved
in a process of cost-maximization; how

ever, the majority of corporate agencies
practice cost-minimization.
A long-standing argument has been
that military research significantly con
tributes to civilian technology. In fact,
military research is only applicable to
forms of military technology.
It is evident in the wake of Reagan's
economic policies that increases in mili-

tarv spending create poverty, techno
logical deterioration and economic in
stability. Because political power is
largely an extension of economic
power, it would seem doubtful that the
military economy would willingly ac
cept re-conversion to a non-military
status. And, in observing Reagan's ac
tions, it seems the military economy has
found a valuable ally.
