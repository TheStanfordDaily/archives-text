## Reflections on Spanish general elections 
### 
The October 28 Spanish general elections were
truly a watershed in the history of Spain's young de
mocracy. The Socialist Workers Party (PSOE) vic
tory is significant, first, because it represents a tran
sition from the founding authoritarian leadership to
a truly democratic one and, second, because it pro
vides visible evidence of a widespread commitment
to parliamentary politics and democracy.
Spain's transition began in November 1975, after
the death of Gen. Francisco Franco. Franco had
presided over an authoritarian regime that survived
for almost 40 years. The Spanish transition was his
torically unique in that it was initiated and con
ducted by franquists, and was carried out almost en
tirely within the franquist legislative process. Under
the prime ministership of Adolfo Suarez, former
minister of Spain's single political party, the fran
quist legislature was convinced to approve its own
replacement with a democratically elected par
liament — and the military and church were per
suaded to refrain from intervention.
In the first two general elections, in 1977 and
1979, Adolfo Suarez's Union of the Democratic
Center (UCD) was able to muster close to 35 percent
of the vote, while the largest opposition party, the
Spanish Socialist Workers Party (PSOE) captured
about 30 percent of the vote. The two resulting UCD
governments presided over a non-inconsiderable
democratization of the Spanish political system.
However, Suarez's coalition suffered from some
of the contradictions of the peculiar Spanish model
of transition. Due to the necessity of gaining the sup
port of both the army and the democratic opposi
tion, Suarez was ambiguous about his plans for
democratization in the early phases of the transition
and he deceived both groups in order to carry out
the delicate reform strategy. This deception was the
logical product of a transition which attempted to
square a circle: to democratize a political system us
ing authoritarian political structures and under the
leadership of prominent authoritarian politicians.
Thus, Suarez assured a virtually untouched mili
tary hierarchy that it would not be significantly re
formed and that the Communist Party would never
be legalized. Suarez's subsequent reversals on both
issues explain, to a large extent, the deception within
the military and the attempted military coup of Feb
ruary, 1981. Suarez promised the electorate that
sweeping reforms would be implemented by his
UCD government. But as an amalgam of widely di
vergent political parties, formed hastily to prevent a
1977 victory of the PSOE or the more conservative
Popular Alliance (AP), UCD was unable to agree on
virtually every issue. This best explains the process

of near suicidal disintegration which has character
ized the coalition since its first victory in 1977. The
result has been the abandonment of the coalition's
right wing to AP, the exit of the social democrats to
the PSOE and, finally, the flight of Adolfo Suarez to
his own party. UCD won only 12 seats and 5.76 per
cent of the vote recently compared to 168 seats and
34.96 percent in 1979.
The elections thus signify an end to transition pol
itics in which a schizophrenic 'consociational' coali
tion was necessary to oversee a delicate process of
political change. The electoral results suggest a shift
to a model of bipolarity.
Rather than viewing the PSOE victory as a
triumph for socialism, it is more appropriate to see
those elections as a clear mandate for democratic
politics. The most significant result was the extreme
ly high voter turnout (79.5 percent) which has effec
tively silenced predictions of continuing decreases in
voter turnout, a thorn in the side of Spain's de
mocracy ever since the first democratic elections in
June of 1977. The alarming rate of abstention in the
1979 municipal elections, the aborted coup attempt
in 1981, the government's subsequent inability to
discipline the armed forces and the last minute at
tempts bv sectors of the military to frighten the elec
torate away from the PSOE had begun to cast doubt
on the viability of Spanish democracy. In this at
mosphere, in which the extreme right hoped to capi
talize, the general elections became a referendum on
the democratic regime.
The dramatic increase in votes from Fraga
Iribarne's AP is best explained by the almost com
ical incompetence of UCD in recent months. APisa
conservative party whose commitment to democrat
ic institutions is fairly solid. Fraga's electoral fail
ures in 1977 and 1979 pushed him into positions
which raised some doubt about his democratic re
solve, but his underdog victory will surely restore his
faitl in the democratic system. Fraga is often billed
as an authoritarian politician. But despite his often
authoritarian demeanor, Fraga is more Gaullist
than authoritarian. As an author of the Spanish
Constitution of 1978, as one of the foremost liberals
within the franquist regime and as a widely re
spected figure in Europe and the United States,
Fraga's recent success presents no real danger to
Spanish democracy.
Along with UCD, the Spanish Communist Party
(PCE) was the other big loser in the elections. San
tiago Carrillo has long been considered the father of
Eurocommunism, but in the last two years he has
found it impossible to tolerate internal party de
mocracy and has purged most of the party's most

competent leaders. The PCE drubbing in the elec
tions will mean that the PSOE will have con
siderably less pressure from its left.
While much media coverage has focused on
Spain's new governing party, it is worthwhile to note
two general observations. First, Gonzalez's victory
also reflects a victory of the moderate wing of the
Socialist Party after an often-bitter five-year strug
gle. Few recall that in 1977 the PSOE was Europe's (
most radical socialist party, whose victory would
have terrified the State Department. While the "lef
tist socialist" faction was all but eliminated at the
last Party Congress, the electoral triumph will se
cure the power of the moderates within the PSOE
party structure.
Second, if the limits to democratically elected so
cialist governments have already been made clear by
the experiences of Labour in Britain, the socialists in
France and PASOK in Greece, the constraints on
the PSOE will be even greater. The persistence of
vestiges of authoritarianism in the bureaucracy, the
public sector, the military and the educational sys
tem present serious obstacles for the Spanish social
ists. Likewise, social characteristics of the country
will increase the need for caution and prudence. The
current visit of the pope to Spain only days after the
socialist victory is a hardly coincidental warning to
Spain's agnostic prime minister.
Given this web of obstacles and constraints, the
PSOE will likely place increasing emphasis on for
eign policy and shy away from touchy domestic pro
grams. Like the Papandreau administration in
Greece, Spain will take an increasingly aggressive
and independent stance in foreign affairs. Spain's in
fluence in Latin American will lend particular signif
icance to this shift. In addition, Gonzalez will call
for a referendum on Spain's membership in NATO
and will attempt to renegotiate with the United
States the recently approved agreement to place mil
itary bases in Spain. However, even in the foreign
policy sphere, the limits to an aggressive foreign pol
icy, especially given the Reagan administration's
views on Latin America and the East-West conflict,
will soon become evident.
Thus, Spain's democracy has been bolstered by
the recent election. By rejecting the threats made by
extreme rightists and sectors of the military,
Spaniards have once again, in large numbers, shown
their support for democratic institutions. By pro
pelling the Spanish Socialist Workers Party into
power, they have also revealed their preference for
responsible and progressive change.

democratization in the early phases of the transition
and he deceived both groups in order to carry out
the delicate reform strategy. This deception was the
logical product of a transition which attempted to
square a circle: to democratize a political system us
ing authoritarian political structures and under the
leadership of prominent authoritarian politicians.
Thus, Suarez assured a virtually untouched mili
tary hierarchy that it would not be significantly re
formed and that the Communist Party would never
be legalized. Suarez's subsequent reversals on both
issues explain, to a large extent, the deception within
the military and the attempted military coup of Feb
ruary, 1981. Suarez promised the electorate that
sweeping reforms would be implemented by his
UCD government. But as an amalgam of widely di
vergent political parties, formed hastily to prevent a
1977 victory of the PSOE or the more conservative
Popular Alliance (AP), UCD was unable to agree on
virtually every issue. This best explains the process

of near suicidal disintegration which has character
ized the coalition since its first victory in 1977. The
result has been the abandonment of the coalition's
right wing to AP, the exit of the social democrats to
the PSOE and, finally, the flight of Adolfo Suarez to
his own party. UCD won only 12 seats and 5.76 per
cent of the vote recently compared to 168 seats and
34.96 percent in 1979.
The elections thus signify an end to transition pol
itics in which a schizophrenic 'consociational' coali
tion was necessary to oversee a delicate process of
political change. The electoral results suggest a shift
to a model of bipolarity.
Rather than viewing the PSOE victory as a
triumph for socialism, it is more appropriate to see
those elections as a clear mandate for democratic
politics. The most significant result was the extreme
ly high voter turnout (79.5 percent) which has effec
tively silenced predictions of continuing decreases in
voter turnout, a thorn in the side of Spain's de
mocracy ever since the first democratic elections in
June of 1977. The alarming rate of abstention in the
1979 municipal elections, the aborted coup attempt
in 1981, the government's subsequent inability to
discipline the armed forces and the last minute at
tempts bv sectors of the military to frighten the elec
torate away from the PSOE had begun to cast doubt
on the viability of Spanish democracy. In this at
mosphere, in which the extreme right hoped to capi
talize, the general elections became a referendum on
the democratic regime.
The dramatic increase in votes from Fraga
Iribarne's AP is best explained by the almost com
ical incompetence of UCD in recent months. APisa
conservative party whose commitment to democrat
ic institutions is fairly solid. Fraga's electoral fail
ures in 1977 and 1979 pushed him into positions
which raised some doubt about his democratic re
solve, but his underdog victory will surely restore his
faitl in the democratic system. Fraga is often billed
as an authoritarian politician. But despite his often
authoritarian demeanor, Fraga is more Gaullist
than authoritarian. As an author of the Spanish
Constitution of 1978, as one of the foremost liberals
within the franquist regime and as a widely re
spected figure in Europe and the United States,
Fraga's recent success presents no real danger to
Spanish democracy.
Along with UCD, the Spanish Communist Party
(PCE) was the other big loser in the elections. San
tiago Carrillo has long been considered the father of
Eurocommunism, but in the last two years he has
found it impossible to tolerate internal party de
mocracy and has purged most of the party's most

competent leaders. The PCE drubbing in the elec
tions will mean that the PSOE will have con
siderably less pressure from its left.
While much media coverage has focused on
Spain's new governing party, it is worthwhile to note
two general observations. First, Gonzalez's victory
also reflects a victory of the moderate wing of the
Socialist Party after an often-bitter five-year strug
gle. Few recall that in 1977 the PSOE was Europe's (
most radical socialist party, whose victory would
have terrified the State Department. While the "lef
tist socialist" faction was all but eliminated at the
last Party Congress, the electoral triumph will se
cure the power of the moderates within the PSOE
party structure.
Second, if the limits to democratically elected so
cialist governments have already been made clear by
the experiences of Labour in Britain, the socialists in
France and PASOK in Greece, the constraints on
the PSOE will be even greater. The persistence of
vestiges of authoritarianism in the bureaucracy, the
public sector, the military and the educational sys
tem present serious obstacles for the Spanish social
ists. Likewise, social characteristics of the country
will increase the need for caution and prudence. The
current visit of the pope to Spain only days after the
socialist victory is a hardly coincidental warning to
Spain's agnostic prime minister.
Given this web of obstacles and constraints, the
PSOE will likely place increasing emphasis on for
eign policy and shy away from touchy domestic pro
grams. Like the Papandreau administration in
Greece, Spain will take an increasingly aggressive
and independent stance in foreign affairs. Spain's in
fluence in Latin American will lend particular signif
icance to this shift. In addition, Gonzalez will call
for a referendum on Spain's membership in NATO
and will attempt to renegotiate with the United
States the recently approved agreement to place mil
itary bases in Spain. However, even in the foreign
policy sphere, the limits to an aggressive foreign pol
icy, especially given the Reagan administration's
views on Latin America and the East-West conflict,
will soon become evident.
Thus, Spain's democracy has been bolstered by
the recent election. By rejecting the threats made by
extreme rightists and sectors of the military,
Spaniards have once again, in large numbers, shown
their support for democratic institutions. By pro
pelling the Spanish Socialist Workers Party into
power, they have also revealed their preference for
responsible and progressive change.

The October 28 Spanish general elections were
truly a watershed in the history of Spain's young de
mocracy. The Socialist Workers Party (PSOE) vic
tory is significant, first, because it represents a tran
sition from the founding authoritarian leadership to
a truly democratic one and, second, because it pro
vides visible evidence of a widespread commitment
to parliamentary politics and democracy.
Spain's transition began in November 1975, after
the death of Gen. Francisco Franco. Franco had
presided over an authoritarian regime that survived
for almost 40 years. The Spanish transition was his
torically unique in that it was initiated and con
ducted by franquists, and was carried out almost en
tirely within the franquist legislative process. Under
the prime ministership of Adolfo Suarez, former
minister of Spain's single political party, the fran
quist legislature was convinced to approve its own
replacement with a democratically elected par
liament — and the military and church were per
suaded to refrain from intervention.
In the first two general elections, in 1977 and
1979, Adolfo Suarez's Union of the Democratic
Center (UCD) was able to muster close to 35 percent
of the vote, while the largest opposition party, the
Spanish Socialist Workers Party (PSOE) captured
about 30 percent of the vote. The two resulting UCD
governments presided over a non-inconsiderable
democratization of the Spanish political system.
However, Suarez's coalition suffered from some
of the contradictions of the peculiar Spanish model
of transition. Due to the necessity of gaining the sup
port of both the army and the democratic opposi
tion, Suarez was ambiguous about his plans for
democratization in the early phases of the transition
and he deceived both groups in order to carry out
the delicate reform strategy. This deception was the

Rather than viewing the PSOE victory as a
triumph for socialism, it is more appropriate to see
those elections as a clear mandate for democratic
politics. The most significant result was the extreme
ly high voter turnout (79.5 percent) which has effec
tively silenced predictions of continuing decreases in
voter turnout, a thorn in the side of Spain's de
mocracy ever since the first democratic elections in
June of 1977. The alarming rate of abstention in the
1979 municipal elections, the aborted coup attempt
in 1981, the government's subsequent inability to
discipline the armed forces and the last minute at
tempts bv sectors of the military to frighten the elec
torate away from the PSOE had begun to cast doubt
on the viability of Spanish democracy. In this at
mosphere, in which the extreme right hoped to capi
talize, the general elections became a referendum on
the democratic regime.
The dramatic increase in votes from Fraga
Iribarne's AP is best explained by the almost com
ical incompetence of UCD in recent months. APisa
conservative party whose commitment to democrat
ic institutions is fairly solid. Fraga's electoral fail
ures in 1977 and 1979 pushed him into positions
which raised some doubt about his democratic re
solve, but his underdog victory will surely restore his
faitl in the democratic system. Fraga is often billed
as an authoritarian politician. But despite his often
authoritarian demeanor, Fraga is more Gaullist
than authoritarian. As an author of the Spanish
Constitution of 1978, as one of the foremost liberals
within the franquist regime and as a widely re
spected figure in Europe and the United States,
Fraga's recent success presents no real danger to
Spanish democracy.
Along with UCD, the Spanish Communist Party
(PCE) was the other big loser in the elections. San
tiago Carrillo has long been considered the father of
Eurocommunism, but in the last two years he has
found it impossible to tolerate internal party de
mocracy and has purged most of the party's most

competent leaders. The PCE drubbing in the elec
tions will mean that the PSOE will have con
siderably less pressure from its left.
While much media coverage has focused on
Spain's new governing party, it is worthwhile to note
two general observations. First, Gonzalez's victory
also reflects a victory of the moderate wing of the
Socialist Party after an often-bitter five-year strug
gle. Few recall that in 1977 the PSOE was Europe's (
most radical socialist party, whose victory would
have terrified the State Department. While the "lef
tist socialist" faction was all but eliminated at the
last Party Congress, the electoral triumph will se
cure the power of the moderates within the PSOE
party structure.
Second, if the limits to democratically elected so
cialist governments have already been made clear by
the experiences of Labour in Britain, the socialists in
France and PASOK in Greece, the constraints on
the PSOE will be even greater. The persistence of
vestiges of authoritarianism in the bureaucracy, the
public sector, the military and the educational sys
tem present serious obstacles for the Spanish social
ists. Likewise, social characteristics of the country
will increase the need for caution and prudence. The
current visit of the pope to Spain only days after the
socialist victory is a hardly coincidental warning to
Spain's agnostic prime minister.
Given this web of obstacles and constraints, the
PSOE will likely place increasing emphasis on for
eign policy and shy away from touchy domestic pro
grams. Like the Papandreau administration in
Greece, Spain will take an increasingly aggressive
and independent stance in foreign affairs. Spain's in
fluence in Latin American will lend particular signif
icance to this shift. In addition, Gonzalez will call
for a referendum on Spain's membership in NATO
and will attempt to renegotiate with the United
States the recently approved agreement to place mil
itary bases in Spain. However, even in the foreign
policy sphere, the limits to an aggressive foreign pol
icy, especially given the Reagan administration's
views on Latin America and the East-West conflict,
will soon become evident.
Thus, Spain's democracy has been bolstered by
the recent election. By rejecting the threats made by
extreme rightists and sectors of the military,
Spaniards have once again, in large numbers, shown
their support for democratic institutions. By pro
pelling the Spanish Socialist Workers Party into
power, they have also revealed their preference for
responsible and progressive change.
