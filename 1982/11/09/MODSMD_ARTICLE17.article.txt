## Warren Zevon severs his relationship with alcohol 
### STEFAN MALMOLI 
Zevon relates
his turmoil by contrasting
his own successes in pulling his
life together with two people
who have failed in recovering theirs.

Warren Zevon
The Envoy
Elektra/Asylum Records
The word was out. Stuman and
K.B. from New York said that I
must catch Warren Zevon on
tour and that I must get his new
LP, The Envoy. I just couldn't be
lieve it. The guy whose claim to
fame was an ode to those
"Werewolves of London," was
actually being recommended to
me from across the country.
Well, as an uninitiated listener
into the music and style of
. Warren Zevon, I decided to listen
and give this artist a try. After all,
. there was something appealing
. about an LA rocker whose en
deavors over the years have in
cluded an acclaimed first album
produced bv Jackson Browne
• and a recent (winning) battle with
■ alcoholism. And after seeing him
-live at his triumphant Kevstone
• Palo Alto show recently, this
I only made the purchasing of his
J new album second nature.
J The Envoy, as Zevon's Lp is
called, is driven bv a tough de
cisiveness and a cool calculated
; method that is distinctive of the
best of the world's envoys. Zevon
• plays his role perfectly and his
• music reflects the envoy's goal to
solve and prevent further turmoil
• in the world around him. From
ithe opening marching, militant

beat of the title track, the album
takes on many challenges and
problems and attempts to make
some sense in the chaos surroun
ding us.
The Envoy is Zevon at his most
brutal and his most tender. It is
an emotional album, filled with
the pangs of his fight with alco
holism and his struggle to achieve
prominence personally and musi
cally. He tackles a plethora of
subjects that had become en
tangled in his alcoholic daze.
Thus, bv catharticly releasing his
frustation and pain, he can en
vision a positive, loving and
hopeful future. As he passion
ately expresses, "I've felt your
pain and 1 know your sorrow/
You could try to let the past slip
away/ Live for today/ Don't
stop believing in tomorrow."
To achieve his final optimistic
line though, Zevon had to ex
press his personal plight through
out the previous material on the
album. Zevon had to let down his
defenses in order to let his true
emotions show. He does so in a
variety of musical forms, which
enables Zevon to combine seri
ous, Springsteen-like dramas

with Beach Boys humor ("The
Hula Hula Boys"); and loving
ballads with kick-ass hard rock.
Therefore, just as the envoy must
employ all modes and methods of
strategy to alleviate world crises,
Zevon combines varying musical
styles and lyric to alleviate his
own crisis.
Zevon's powerful style,
though, is derived in large part by
a Springsteen view of how rock
and roll should be played and
sung. He even caters to these
Springsteen tendencies in such
songs as "Let Nothing Come Be
tween You" and"The Over
draft" (which contains such
Springsteen passages as, "I had a
little girl, now/ We crossed the
state line/ It was more than just
an overdraft/ We were looking at
time"). In emulating Springsteen
though, Zevon still does add his
own sense of originality. Spring
steen would never be caught per
forming this album's strongest
and wittiest cut, "Ain't That
Pretty At All." On this song,
Zevon captures the intense emo
tion and the ironic humor in
herent in alcoholism. Above all,
though, it also captures the relief

of finally casting off his de
partures on the bottle to face the
harsh reality of life sober: "I've
done everything I wanted to do/
I've done that too/ And it ain't
that pretty at all .../ So I'm
going to hurl myself against the
wall 'caus I'd rather feel bad than
not feel anything at all."
In addition though, Zevon re
lates his turmoil by contrasting
his own successes in pulling his
life together with two people who
failed in recovering theirs. One is
an anonymous, everyday pusher
who is read about and forgotten
daily; the other is a little more fa
mous — namely, Elvis Presley. In
"Charlie's Medicine,'' the former
case, we are told of a pill pusher
who is blown away. However, the
irony was the only thing to scare
him into straightening out his
own life — "Charlie dealt in
pharmaceuticals/ He sold these
expensive drugs/ I gave Charlie
all my money/ What the hell was
I thinking of .../ 1 came to say
goodbye/ I'm sorrv Charlie
died/ I came to finish paying my
bill." Directly analogous is in the
latter song, dealing with Elvis
Presley. In "Jesus Mentioned,"
Zevon depicts the king of rock
and roll, as a victim to pills and
booze. Zevon can relate unequiv
ocally because he almost ended
up following the route of Presley.
Zevon has survived though, and
therefore, he can be far more bit
ter and sarcastic in telling this
tale — "Can't you just imagine
digging up the king Begging him
to sing about those heavenly
mansions Jesus mentioned . . ./
He went walking on the water —
with his pills."
Zevon, therefore is relating his
story as one who has climbed his
way out of the false state of drink
and drug, unlike "Charlie" and
Presley. He's finally learned to
accept life's hardships without
the addiction to any artificial
stimuli. As he proclaims, "I ap
preciate the best, but I'm settling
for less; 'cause I'm looking for
the next best thing." Through
out, the whole album is filled mu
sically with the same intense need
to communicate this fact. Per
sonally, it's inspirational to know
that there is still vital life in rock
and roll beyond drugs and drink.
Zevon, as the envoy, is delivering
this tough proposal to all who are
willing to listen.

"Werewolves of London," was
actually being recommended to
me from across the country.
Well, as an uninitiated listener
into the music and style of
. Warren Zevon, I decided to listen
and give this artist a try. After all,
. there was something appealing
. about an LA rocker whose en
deavors over the years have in
cluded an acclaimed first album
produced bv Jackson Browne
• and a recent (winning) battle with
■ alcoholism. And after seeing him
-live at his triumphant Kevstone
• Palo Alto show recently, this
I only made the purchasing of his
J new album second nature.
J The Envoy, as Zevon's Lp is
called, is driven bv a tough de
cisiveness and a cool calculated
; method that is distinctive of the
best of the world's envoys. Zevon
• plays his role perfectly and his
• music reflects the envoy's goal to
solve and prevent further turmoil
• in the world around him. From
ithe opening marching, militant

beat of the title track, the album
takes on many challenges and
problems and attempts to make
some sense in the chaos surroun
ding us.
The Envoy is Zevon at his most
brutal and his most tender. It is
an emotional album, filled with
the pangs of his fight with alco
holism and his struggle to achieve
prominence personally and musi
cally. He tackles a plethora of
subjects that had become en
tangled in his alcoholic daze.
Thus, bv catharticly releasing his
frustation and pain, he can en
vision a positive, loving and
hopeful future. As he passion
ately expresses, "I've felt your
pain and 1 know your sorrow/
You could try to let the past slip
away/ Live for today/ Don't
stop believing in tomorrow."
To achieve his final optimistic
line though, Zevon had to ex
press his personal plight through
out the previous material on the
album. Zevon had to let down his
defenses in order to let his true
emotions show. He does so in a
variety of musical forms, which
enables Zevon to combine seri
ous, Springsteen-like dramas

with Beach Boys humor ("The
Hula Hula Boys"); and loving
ballads with kick-ass hard rock.
Therefore, just as the envoy must
employ all modes and methods of
strategy to alleviate world crises,
Zevon combines varying musical
styles and lyric to alleviate his
own crisis.
Zevon's powerful style,
though, is derived in large part by
a Springsteen view of how rock
and roll should be played and
sung. He even caters to these
Springsteen tendencies in such
songs as "Let Nothing Come Be
tween You" and"The Over
draft" (which contains such
Springsteen passages as, "I had a
little girl, now/ We crossed the
state line/ It was more than just
an overdraft/ We were looking at
time"). In emulating Springsteen
though, Zevon still does add his
own sense of originality. Spring
steen would never be caught per
forming this album's strongest
and wittiest cut, "Ain't That
Pretty At All." On this song,
Zevon captures the intense emo
tion and the ironic humor in
herent in alcoholism. Above all,
though, it also captures the relief

of finally casting off his de
partures on the bottle to face the
harsh reality of life sober: "I've
done everything I wanted to do/
I've done that too/ And it ain't
that pretty at all .../ So I'm
going to hurl myself against the
wall 'caus I'd rather feel bad than
not feel anything at all."
In addition though, Zevon re
lates his turmoil by contrasting
his own successes in pulling his
life together with two people who
failed in recovering theirs. One is
an anonymous, everyday pusher
who is read about and forgotten
daily; the other is a little more fa
mous — namely, Elvis Presley. In
"Charlie's Medicine,'' the former
case, we are told of a pill pusher
who is blown away. However, the
irony was the only thing to scare
him into straightening out his
own life — "Charlie dealt in
pharmaceuticals/ He sold these
expensive drugs/ I gave Charlie
all my money/ What the hell was
I thinking of .../ 1 came to say
goodbye/ I'm sorrv Charlie
died/ I came to finish paying my
bill." Directly analogous is in the
latter song, dealing with Elvis
Presley. In "Jesus Mentioned,"
Zevon depicts the king of rock
and roll, as a victim to pills and
booze. Zevon can relate unequiv
ocally because he almost ended
up following the route of Presley.
Zevon has survived though, and
therefore, he can be far more bit
ter and sarcastic in telling this
tale — "Can't you just imagine
digging up the king Begging him
to sing about those heavenly
mansions Jesus mentioned . . ./
He went walking on the water —
with his pills."
Zevon, therefore is relating his
story as one who has climbed his
way out of the false state of drink
and drug, unlike "Charlie" and
Presley. He's finally learned to
accept life's hardships without
the addiction to any artificial
stimuli. As he proclaims, "I ap
preciate the best, but I'm settling
for less; 'cause I'm looking for
the next best thing." Through
out, the whole album is filled mu
sically with the same intense need
to communicate this fact. Per
sonally, it's inspirational to know
that there is still vital life in rock
and roll beyond drugs and drink.
Zevon, as the envoy, is delivering
this tough proposal to all who are
willing to listen.
