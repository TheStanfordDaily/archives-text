# 'Fast Times': slight, but pleasurable

Fast Times at Ridgemont High
may be the kind of movie you're
not supposed to admit to enjoy
ing, like Caveman or Used Cars.
but I had a much better time at it
than at any new release in the last
month. Amy Heckerling, the de
but director, has a knack for
blackout comedy, and the lightly
parodistic tone she's found is just
right for Cameron Crowe's
script, based on his own book
about kids attending a suburban
California high school. (In order
to research his subject, Crowe en
rolled as a student in the school
he was surveying.) Anyone who
has spent time around teenagers
will recognize the accuracy of the
dialogue and of some of the bits:
students sniffing the freshly dit
toed schedules passed out by a
zealous teacher; a trio of girls dis
playing the "Pat Benatar look";

wholesale, reasonably elaborate
and hilariously unabashed cheat
ing in the classroom of an overly
trusting staff member.
Heckerling has a good casting
eye and the sense not to force the
action, so she gets a surprising
number of lovely small per
formances, mostly from actors
who are as new to movies as she
is. The performers appear un
pressured, as the characters do in
class, in the cafeteria and in the
shopping mall where many of
them work in their spare hours.
Jennifer Jason Leigh and Phoebe
Cates, as Stacey and Linda, share
the best scenes. Linda is a virgin
al-looking dark beauty whose ef
forts to instruct Stacey by confid
ing the details of her own sex life
have a funny incongruousness.
Stacey's light brown hair is Alice
in Wonderland-length, and she

wrinkles her nose and tilts her
head dreamily when she finds a
boy she likes; following Linda's
directions, she makes un
mistakable passes at her dates,
but she is so instinctively modest
that she can't help deprecating
herself and thus cancelling out
her aggressiveness. Her scenes
with Mike Damone (Richard
Romanus), who gets her preg
nant, and Mark "Rat" Rattner
(Brian Backer, who appearered
in the Woody Allen play The
Floating Lightbulb), who is both
attracted to and terrified by her,
are more than just authentic: thev
derive from a field of experience
common to all of us. Mike comes
on like a snake oil salesman: engi
neering a pathetic ticket scalping
business that takes most of his
energy, he gives a desperate im
itation of an adult with a jaun
diced view of romance. He tutors
Rat in the fine points of seduc
tion, but turns out to be a ner
vous, overanxious lover himself.
When Stacey undresses for him,
his fear makes him rigid and
emotionally cold; when she tells
him she's pregnant, he backs
clumsily out of her life (and prac
tically out of the film, too, which
is unfortunate).
Stacey's brother Brad is played
by Judge Reinhold, who has far
off eyes and a vocal style that can
best be described as nasal slick.
Brad is Crowe's most interesting
character — a romantic whose
low boiling point explodes him
out of a series of faintly ridicu
lous situations but whose basic
decency keeps him grounded.
(It's easy to believe the familial
ties between Brad and Stacey,
who have a common — and tacit
— sense of values. They're nice
kids.) But the real hero of Fast
Times at Ridgemont High is Jeff
Spicoli (Sean Penn), who looks
like a '60s holdover, junior
division, but talks in a version of
Southern California hip so exag
gerated it seems remote — almost

Martian. Spicoli, we are told, has
been stoned since the third grade,
and he has attained a pure,
amiable high: he provides unin
terrupted entertainment for his
classmates and for us. Penn gave
an unmemorable performance as
Timothy Hutton's best friend in
last year's Taps (perhaps a wise
choice under the circumstances),
but he invents a new type of com
edy routine here and sustains it
through the entire film.
The kids' acting is so con
sistently unaffected that Ray
Walston, wound up tight as a re
lentless history teacher, is in a dif
ferent movie. You can see him
setting his professional stage co
median's skills to work, but
they're appallingly misplaced
here — the young actors are so
fresh that they make him look
bad, and he turns Mr. Hand into
such a pill that when we finally
see the selfless concern behind his
nagging, we don't believe it.
I realize that in discussing Fast
Times at Ridgemopt High at this
length, I am probably overrating
it; in fact, pleasurable and
shrewdly observed though it may
be, it's a slight movie. Heckerl
ing's major strength — her light
touch — is also her major
weakness: she doesn't hold any
scene long enough to explore the
characters. The film has almost
no depth beyond what the actors
bring to it, and the blackout
sketch format keeps cutting them
off. The picture moves so quickly
that we don't have time to linger
over the missed moments, but it's
so good-natured that we proba
bly wouldn't care about them
anyhow. However, we do care
about the characters, and the
film's succinctness holds them at
bay.

here — the young actors are so
fresh that they make him look

such a pill that when we finally
see the selfless concern behind his
nagging, we don't believe it.
I realize that in discussing Fast
Times at Ridgemopt High at this
length, I am probably overrating
it; in fact, pleasurable and
shrewdly observed though it may
be, it's a slight movie. Heckerl
ing's major strength — her light
touch — is also her major
weakness: she doesn't hold any
scene long enough to explore the
characters. The film has almost
no depth beyond what the actors
bring to it, and the blackout
sketch format keeps cutting them
off. The picture moves so quickly
that we don't have time to linger
over the missed moments, but it's
so good-natured that we proba
bly wouldn't care about them
anyhow. However, we do care
about the characters, and the
film's succinctness holds them at
bay.

may be the kind of movie you're
not supposed to admit to enjoy
ing, like Caveman or Used Cars.
but I had a much better time at it
than at any new release in the last
month. Amy Heckerling, the de
but director, has a knack for
blackout comedy, and the lightly
parodistic tone she's found is just
right for Cameron Crowe's
script, based on his own book
about kids attending a suburban
California high school. (In order
to research his subject, Crowe en
rolled as a student in the school
he was surveying.) Anyone who
has spent time around teenagers
will recognize the accuracy of the
dialogue and of some of the bits:
students sniffing the freshly dit
toed schedules passed out by a
zealous teacher; a trio of girls dis
playing the "Pat Benatar look";

wholesale, reasonably elaborate
and hilariously unabashed cheat
ing in the classroom of an overly
trusting staff member.
Heckerling has a good casting
eye and the sense not to force the
action, so she gets a surprising
number of lovely small per
formances, mostly from actors
who are as new to movies as she
is. The performers appear un
pressured, as the characters do in
class, in the cafeteria and in the
shopping mall where many of
them work in their spare hours.
Jennifer Jason Leigh and Phoebe
Cates, as Stacey and Linda, share
the best scenes. Linda is a virgin
al-looking dark beauty whose ef
forts to instruct Stacey by confid
ing the details of her own sex life
have a funny incongruousness.
Stacey's light brown hair is Alice
in Wonderland-length, and she

wrinkles her nose and tilts her
head dreamily when she finds a
boy she likes; following Linda's
directions, she makes un
mistakable passes at her dates,
but she is so instinctively modest
that she can't help deprecating
herself and thus cancelling out
her aggressiveness. Her scenes
with Mike Damone (Richard
Romanus), who gets her preg
nant, and Mark "Rat" Rattner
(Brian Backer, who appearered
in the Woody Allen play The
Floating Lightbulb), who is both
attracted to and terrified by her,
are more than just authentic: thev
derive from a field of experience
common to all of us. Mike comes
on like a snake oil salesman: engi
neering a pathetic ticket scalping
business that takes most of his
energy, he gives a desperate im
itation of an adult with a jaun
diced view of romance. He tutors
Rat in the fine points of seduc
tion, but turns out to be a ner
vous, overanxious lover himself.
When Stacey undresses for him,
his fear makes him rigid and
emotionally cold; when she tells
him she's pregnant, he backs
clumsily out of her life (and prac
tically out of the film, too, which
is unfortunate).
Stacey's brother Brad is played
by Judge Reinhold, who has far
off eyes and a vocal style that can
best be described as nasal slick.
Brad is Crowe's most interesting
character — a romantic whose
low boiling point explodes him
out of a series of faintly ridicu
lous situations but whose basic
decency keeps him grounded.
(It's easy to believe the familial
ties between Brad and Stacey,
who have a common — and tacit
— sense of values. They're nice
kids.) But the real hero of Fast
Times at Ridgemont High is Jeff
Spicoli (Sean Penn), who looks
like a '60s holdover, junior
division, but talks in a version of
Southern California hip so exag
gerated it seems remote — almost

Martian. Spicoli, we are told, has
been stoned since the third grade,
and he has attained a pure,
amiable high: he provides unin
terrupted entertainment for his
classmates and for us. Penn gave
an unmemorable performance as
Timothy Hutton's best friend in
last year's Taps (perhaps a wise
choice under the circumstances),
but he invents a new type of com
edy routine here and sustains it
through the entire film.
The kids' acting is so con
sistently unaffected that Ray
Walston, wound up tight as a re
lentless history teacher, is in a dif
ferent movie. You can see him
setting his professional stage co
median's skills to work, but
they're appallingly misplaced
here — the young actors are so
fresh that they make him look
bad, and he turns Mr. Hand into
such a pill that when we finally
see the selfless concern behind his
nagging, we don't believe it.
