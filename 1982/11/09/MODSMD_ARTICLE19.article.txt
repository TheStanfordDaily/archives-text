# The 						once and future Count keeps his style
## 
### TED GIOIA Count Basie The New Varsity Monday, November 1 
Early jazz, like feudal society,
had its own lines of aristocracy:
Count Basie, Duke Ellington,
King Oliver and King Bolden
were among the most famous
noblemen to grace the infant
days of American improvisa
tional music, and their de
meanors, as well as their titles, re
flected a patriarchal bearing and
urbanity that was truly re
markable — especially when one
considers the offstage struggles
against racism and discrimina
tion which most of these musi
cians faced.
Of this first generation of jazz's
nobility only Basie and Earl
Hines (the name Earl being
Hines' real first name and not an
other Napoleonic attempt to
crown one's self with an assumed
honor) remain as powerful forces
in music. Basie, even more than
Hines, has managed to retain a
large following which, if one is to
judge from the audience at his ap
pearance at Palo Alto's New
Varsity, is not only enthusiastic,
but also surprisingly young. In
deed, some of the pieces in the
band's repertoire have been
around longer than many of the
listeners that were present Mon
day night.

Yet when one thinks about it,
the appeal of Basics music for
younger ears makes good sense.
Unlike Duke Ellington, Fletcher
Henderson, Glenn MilTer, Benny
Goodman and a host of other
band leaders, Basic placed vir
tually all of his emphasis on
simple arrangements which were
strongly related to the blues and
blues-oriented music. Anyone fa
miliar with the development of
modern poular music will recog
nize how similar this approach is
to the one used bv many rock
bands: rock and roll, like Basie's
music, derives from the blues —
perhaps it would not be overly
misleading to call his band the
Rolling Stones of the 30s.
The formula is one that works
just as well in the '80s, as his per
formance made quite clear. Over
half of the songs he played quick
ly moved into a gospel/blues
groove which proyed irresistible.
Such narrow programming risks
falling into monotony, but
Basie's strong, propelling rhythm
section, anchored by guitarist
Freddie Green (who has the
almost unbelievable distinction
of having played with the Count
for half a century) can hold in
terest when lesser groups would
flounder around hopelessly.
, Singer Dennis Roland dis
played soulful roots that would

be well suited to a Motown
album, but when he sang the
blues he evoked Joe Williams —
another long-time Basie singer —
and showed that he is com
fortable in more than one area of
Afro-American music. It was
only when he attempted Duke El
lington's ballad "Solitude" that
he appeared to be sinking in un
charted waters. Basie's band has
never been at its best with slow
numbers, and Roland's awkward
phrasing did little to help matters
on this tune.
Basie is just as much a show
man as he is a musician. The au
dience's initial dismay at seeing
the Count brought to the piano in
a wheelchair was dissipated by
his ease of manner and light rep
artee throughout the per

formance. Despite its appearance
of spontaneity, the program was
tightly constructed and carefully
rehearsed. Even the humorous
interchanges between Basie and
guitarist Green were virtually
identical to what I saw them do in
1977 (and, 1 speculate, probably
go much farther back than that),
while the arrangements (for ex
ample "April in Paris") have
been in the band's book since
time immemorial.
Yet familiarity, far from breed
ing contempt, was a virtue; the
band's vitality and ease of execu
tion no doubt stemmed from
their intimate knowledge of the
material, and Basie's repartee
never sounds dated even to the
listener who has heard it all
before.

Basie is almost an institution in
American music, and as with any
tradition he gains by following
the formulas of the past. When
Basie breaks into "Ja Da" he
brings back memories of Kansas
City jazz — that amazing and
unique contribution to our coun
try's musical heritage; and just by
closing one's eyes, images appear
of the musical legends of that
city: Herschel Evans, Jay
McShann, Lester Young and
Charlie Parker. For Basie, only a
mediocre pianist in terms of tech
nique and compositional skills,
music is style; and that style, de
spite the vicissitudes of recent
popular music, hides its age so
well that one speculates that the
sounds of jazz's era of nobility
will remain vital and expressive
for some time to come.

their intimate knowledge of the
material, and Basie's repartee
never sounds dated even to the
listener who has heard it all
before.

Basie is almost an institution in
American music, and as with any
tradition he gains by following
the formulas of the past. When
Basie breaks into "Ja Da" he
brings back memories of Kansas
City jazz — that amazing and
unique contribution to our coun
try's musical heritage; and just by
closing one's eyes, images appear
of the musical legends of that
city: Herschel Evans, Jay
McShann, Lester Young and
Charlie Parker. For Basie, only a
mediocre pianist in terms of tech
nique and compositional skills,
music is style; and that style, de
spite the vicissitudes of recent
popular music, hides its age so
well that one speculates that the
sounds of jazz's era of nobility
will remain vital and expressive
for some time to come.

Early jazz, like feudal society,
had its own lines of aristocracy:
Count Basie, Duke Ellington,
King Oliver and King Bolden
were among the most famous
noblemen to grace the infant
days of American improvisa
tional music, and their de
meanors, as well as their titles, re
flected a patriarchal bearing and
urbanity that was truly re
markable — especially when one
considers the offstage struggles
against racism and discrimina
tion which most of these musi
cians faced.
Of this first generation of jazz's
nobility only Basie and Earl
Hines (the name Earl being
Hines' real first name and not an
other Napoleonic attempt to
crown one's self with an assumed
honor) remain as powerful forces
in music. Basie, even more than
Hines, has managed to retain a
large following which, if one is to
judge from the audience at his ap
pearance at Palo Alto's New
Varsity, is not only enthusiastic,
but also surprisingly young. In
deed, some of the pieces in the
band's repertoire have been
around longer than many of the
listeners that were present Mon
day night.

Yet when one thinks about it,
the appeal of Basics music for
younger ears makes good sense.
Unlike Duke Ellington, Fletcher
Henderson, Glenn MilTer, Benny
Goodman and a host of other
band leaders, Basic placed vir
tually all of his emphasis on
simple arrangements which were
strongly related to the blues and
blues-oriented music. Anyone fa
miliar with the development of
modern poular music will recog
nize how similar this approach is
to the one used bv many rock
bands: rock and roll, like Basie's
music, derives from the blues —
perhaps it would not be overly
misleading to call his band the
Rolling Stones of the 30s.
The formula is one that works
just as well in the '80s, as his per
formance made quite clear. Over
half of the songs he played quick
ly moved into a gospel/blues
groove which proyed irresistible.
Such narrow programming risks
falling into monotony, but
Basie's strong, propelling rhythm
section, anchored by guitarist
Freddie Green (who has the
almost unbelievable distinction
of having played with the Count
for half a century) can hold in
terest when lesser groups would
flounder around hopelessly.
, Singer Dennis Roland dis
played soulful roots that would

be well suited to a Motown
album, but when he sang the
blues he evoked Joe Williams —
another long-time Basie singer —
and showed that he is com
fortable in more than one area of
Afro-American music. It was
only when he attempted Duke El
lington's ballad "Solitude" that
he appeared to be sinking in un
charted waters. Basie's band has
never been at its best with slow
numbers, and Roland's awkward
phrasing did little to help matters
on this tune.
Basie is just as much a show
man as he is a musician. The au
dience's initial dismay at seeing
the Count brought to the piano in
a wheelchair was dissipated by
his ease of manner and light rep
artee throughout the per

formance. Despite its appearance
of spontaneity, the program was
tightly constructed and carefully
rehearsed. Even the humorous
interchanges between Basie and
guitarist Green were virtually
identical to what I saw them do in
1977 (and, 1 speculate, probably
go much farther back than that),
while the arrangements (for ex
ample "April in Paris") have
been in the band's book since
time immemorial.
Yet familiarity, far from breed
ing contempt, was a virtue; the
band's vitality and ease of execu
tion no doubt stemmed from
their intimate knowledge of the
material, and Basie's repartee
never sounds dated even to the
listener who has heard it all
before.
