# Denial of tenure to Freedman still being re-examined
## 
### DAVID SANCHEZ 
Last spring's decision to deny tenure to award
winning History Prof. Estelle Freedman is still being
reconsidered, according to William Chace, associate
dean of Humanities and Sciences (H & S).
Chace is hoping for a decision by early December,
but he cautioned that decisions of this type cannot
be rushed.
"We want to do it right," Chace said, "and the
only way to do these things right is not to spare any
time." He said he felt that "all things con
sidered,"the decision process was "moving along as
quickly as any other case."
The deans of H & S decided last March to follow
a unanimous recommendation by the Committee on
Appointments and Promotions (CAP) that Freed
man not be granted tenure. Students and faculty
members in the History Department, which had
voted to recommend that Freedman be granted
tenure, protested the CAP decision.
The History Department responded to the de
cision late last spring by forming a special commit
tee, led by Prof. Carl Degler. The committee as
sembled a large file of materials, including letters
from references outside the University, that pointed

to Freedman's "achievement and quality,", accord
ing to Chace. Chace said this file was submitted to
the deans of H & S, who in turn submitted the file to
the CAP, which refused to make a recommendation
because the file "had not been properly solicited."
The tenure decision was thus delayed until after
summer, because the History Department did not
resubmit a corrected file until mid-October.
Prof. James Sheehan, chairman of the History
Department, explained that the problem with the
file was "essentially a procedural matter."
"The department writes to people all over the
country, asking for their views on the candidate,"
explained Sheehan. "The A and P committee (CAP)
felt that in order to make a decision, it had to have
outside letters gathered under a different formula â€”
that is, that the request for information be worded
differently."
Chace noted that this procedure is customarily
followed by all tenure considerations.
Freedman co-founded the program in feminist
studies here, and is in her seventh year of teaching,
feminist and other groups on campus vigorously
protested the decision not to grant her tenure last
year, and students presented Chace with petitions

bearing more than 300 res.
Chace said that he could not say how much weight
the CAP would give to these petitions, which are in
cluded in the Kreqdman file, but he noted that "stu
dent opinion is certainly taken into account."
However, he added, " I think that the best judges
of achievement are other scholars. I don't
think that students are very good judges of scholarly
achievement."
Rules set by the American Association of Univer
sity Professors prohibit professors from working for
more than six years at the same university without
being granted tenure. If tenure is refused, professors
have a one-year grace period during which they may
remain at the university. Freedman is on leave this
quarter and could not be reached to comment on
whether she would continue to teach here if not
granted tenure.
The six-member CAP is composed of faculty
members drawn from the humanities, social science
and science divisions of the School of H & S. The
committee reviews recommendations made by de
partments within the School of H & S regarding
tenure candidates and, in turn, makes recommenda-
tions to the deans.

Chace stressed that the CAP is only

an advisory body, and that the decision
to grant or not grant tenure rests solely
with the deans of H & S.
"We do make the decision here," ex
plained Chace. "We make it on the
basis of their (CAP members') advice,
but we are perfectly free not to follow
their advice."
Only three of the five deans will be
participating in the decision: Chace,
Dean Norman Wessels and Applied
Physics Prof. Calvin Quate. Associate
deans Carolyn Lougeeand David Ken-,
nedv will not take part because both
history professors, and it is the deans'
policy to exclude from tenure delibera
tions all deans who are members of the
candidate's department.
Freedman received the Lloyd W.
Dinklespiel award for outstanding ser
vices to undergraduate education in
June, 1981.
