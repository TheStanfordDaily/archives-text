Begin testifies on massacre
Jerusalem — Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin testified yesterday
that he and his Cabinet raised no objection to the use of right-wing Christian
militiamen to invade the Palestinian refugee camps in Beirut despite a warn
ing from the army chief of staff that the Falangists might engage in "an out
burst of revenge."
Begin told the commission investigating the Sept. 16-18 massacre of
Palestinian civilians that he first learned of the decision to send the
Falangists into the camps when Defense Minister Ariel Sharon explained the
exercise to the Cabinet Sept. 16, several hours after the operation had begun.
At that time, the Cabinet could have called off the attack but chose not to do
so.
In his 45 minutes of public testimony before the three-member tribunal,
Begin said he never suspected that Falangists troops would kill women, chil
dren and old men. However, in a seeming contradiction, he also said that
prior to the massacre he was concerned about the possibility that Lebanese
Christians might seek revenge against the Moslem population for the as
sassination of President-elect Bashir Gemayel, the Falangist leader.
Confirming testimony that Sharon had given to the commission two
weeks ago, Begin said that the Cabinet agreed June IS, during the second
week of the war, to use the Israeli-armed and Israeli-trained Falangist forces
whenever possible in the fight against the Palestine Liberation Organization.
However, Begin said he was not told in advance of specific plans to use the
Falangists to mop up PLO guerrillas thought to be hiding in the Sabra and
Chatilla refugee camps.
Pope announces Polish visit
Warsaw, Poland — In a move apparently timed to dilute support for anti
regime strikes and protests called for later this week, the Polish government
and the Roman Catholic Church jointly announced yesterday that Pope
John Paul IPs long-delayed second visit to his homeland is set for June 18.
A communique released by both the official PAP news agency and the Of
fice of the Episcopate said that Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, head of the
martial-law regime, and Archbishop Jozef Glemp, primate of Poland, had
agreed to the date at a meeting yesterday morning.
The four-sentence communique also said that the two had discussed the
situation in the country and "expressed mutual concern over maintaining
and strengthening peace, social order and honest work."
The announcement came just two days before the date that was set by un
derground Solidarity leaders for new anti-government strikes and demon
strations to protest the formal banning of the free trade union last month.
Glemp, who has consistently voiced support for Solidarity, has nonetheless
joined the authorities in publicly opposing the planned protests for fear they
could lead to more bloodshed.
By setting a new date for the papal visit, both sides apparently hope to give
Poland's overwhelmingly Catholic population second thoughts about par
ticipating in more anti-government actions.
Larger deficit forecast
Washington — A budget deficit of $170 billion or
$ 175 billion is probable in this fiscal year and next,
director Alice Rivlin of the Congressional Budget
Office said yesterday.
A delayed recovery from the recession, plus
scaled-back forecasts of economic growth in 1983,
accounted for the forecast of the increased deficit
spending since the office's estimate of only two
months ago, Rivlin said.
"We're going to need a tax increase to get the
deficit down," she told reporters during a meeting.
"The question is how to do it in the least damaging
way to the economy."
Her comments came as President Reagan began
a series of meetings with his fiscal and economic
advisers before making decisions on the budget for
fiscal year 1984 that he will send to Congress in
January.
Reagan, who has rejected the idea of a tax in
crease next year, once predicted a deficit of only
$ 115 billion for the current fiscal year but that esti
mate clearly has become outdated.
The budget office in September estimated
budget deficits of $ 155 billion for the current fiscal
year and $ 152 billion for fiscal year 1984, which be
gins Oct. I, 1983.
Those estimates, Rivlin told reporters yesterday,
now appear to be clearly optimistic in view of the
"flat" economy so far in the fourth quarter and the
lower estimates of growth next year.
De Lorean pleads innocent
Los Angeles — Automaker John De Lorean
pleaded innocent yesterday to nine charges of co
caine trafficking and racketeering in an alleged
deal to sell $24 million in cocaine and raise money
for his ailing auto company.
Two co-defendants also pleaded innocent and
trial was set for Jan. 7. However, attorneys for all
three men indicated complicated pre-trial motions
could delay the trial's start.
Standing before U.S. District Judge Robert
Takasugi, De Lorean said he understood the
charges against him. Asked by the court clerk what
plea he wished to enter to the first count of the in
dictment, De Lorean answered in a firm voice,
"Not guilty."
The clerk then asked, "Is it your intention to
enter the same plea to the remaining charges
against you?"
"Yes," De Lorean said, "not guilty."
As De Lorean stepped back from the podium in
the center of the crowded courtroom, co-defendant
William Morgan Hetrick, stepped forward with his
lawyer and went through the same procedure, also
pleading not guilty.
The third defendant, Stephen Lee Arrington, the
only one of the three who came to court in prison
garb, stepped forward and said quickly, "Not guil
ty," when asked for his plea.
Hetrick's attorney, Stephen Wilson, said the 50-
vear-old aviation company owner wanted a review
of his bail, which is currently set at $20 million. The
judge scheduled a hearing for tomorrow morning
to consider that request.
Pension reforms suggested
Washington — The National Commission on

Social Security Reform released yesterday a laun
dry list of methods to shore up the system, ranging
from higher gasoline and whiskey taxes to belt
tightening measures for the 36 million benefi
ciaries.
The 15-member panelWs expected to pick and
choose later this week from among the options laid
out in the background book prepared by its staff.
The list suggests ways to revamp the system, pro
viding estimates of savings and how much each
idea could contribute to eradicating Social Secur
ity's deficits during the 1980s and over the next 75
years.
The menu includes such unpopular possibilities
as gradually raising the normal retirement age of
65, cutting cost-of-living increases and phasing in a
tax on Social Security benefits.
Noticeably absent from the list is any plan to
make Social Security voluntary or to jettison its so
called "welfare" aspects, such as the 50 percent
spouses' share of benefits or the skewed formula
that gives low-income workers relatively more for
their payroll tax dollar.
The commission is scheduled to hold a three-day
decision-making meeting starting Thursday in
Alexandria, Virginia.
Social Security's old age fund, which had to bor
row for the first time in history last month to cover
the November checks, faces shortages of $100
billion to $200 billion during the rest of the 1980s.
To cover that gap, the system needs either to gener
ate higher revenues or reduce its expenditures or
both.
Prison fire kills 27
Biloxi, Miss. — Twenty-seven prisoners died in
their county jail cells early yesterday when a former
mental patient set a fire in a padded cell and thick,
choking smoke raced through the ventilation sys
tem, knocking out the jailer who had the keys.
An additional 61 people were injured, including
firefighters, police officers, jailers and inmates of
the Harrison County Jail — almost all by smoke
inhalation. Hospitals said 10 inmates and a jailer
were in critical condition.
"The ones that stayed alive got wet towels and
wrapped them around their face or got in a shower
and put wet blankets over them," said Charlie
Acevedo, an inmate hospitalized for smoke inhala
tion. "The ones that didn't, died."
The former mental patient was being charged
with 27 counts of capital murder, said Albert
Necaise, the district attorney for Harrison County.
Those killed included 25 men and two women.
The inmates were asleep when the fire started at
about 1:30 a.m. and they were quickly overcome by
smoke from the smoldering polyurethane, a syn
thetic material used as protective padding in an
isolation cell, said Harold Windham, an assistant
fire chief.
Soviet bombers threaten carriers
Washington — Soviet supersonic Backfire
bombers have made their first simulated missile
strikes against U.S. aircraft carriers and started pa
trolling the Sea of Japan in what the Navy says
adds "a new dimension to the threat to the sea
lanes."
Even though the planes stayed about 120 miles
awav from the two carriers, that is well within the
striking range of the AS-4 Kitchen missiles they
carry, intelligence sources said.

The maneuvers occurred in late Sept. and early
Oct. during a major U.S. naval exercise in the
northern Pacific, according to the Navy.
U.S. population to increase
Washington — The U.S. population is likely to
rise by about a third to 309 million by the year
2050, then begin to decline, the Census Bureau said
yesterday.
It was the first time the bureau had classified
zero population growth as a likely outcome in this
country.
The bureau also said 21.7 percent of the popu
lation is likely to be over age 65 by 2050, up from
11.4 percent now, while blacks would probably
make up 16.8 percent then, as against 11.9 percent
now.
The new report said female life expectancy is ex
pected to rise to 83.6 years in 2050 from 78.3 now
and male life expectancy to 75.1 years from 70.7.
The U.S. population is now about 232 million
and is growing at a rate of about nine-tenths of 1
percent a year. The bureau said this growth rate is
likely gradually to fade and the nation is likely to
reach zero population growth by the middle of the
next century.
Marine exercises anger Spanish
Washington — U.S. Marines are about to make
an unpublicized practice landing on the Moroccan
coast, exacerbating delicate talks with a new So
cialist government in Spain, which already is balk
ing over American military bases and its member
ship in NATO.
"We would not like it," said a Spanish diplomat
who asked to remain anonymous. The official ob
jected to the location of the impending Marine
landing, near Spanish enclaves on the Moroccan
coast across from Gibraltar.
At least one senior Pentagon official is known to
have suggested that the U.S.-Moroccan exercise,
described as the first ever, be postponed or can
celled. But there was every indication yesterday
that the maneuvers would go ahead on schedule
starting today.
The exercise comes at a time when the United
States faces the possibility of tough negotiations
with the new Socialist Spanish government over
continued American use of key bases in Spain.
The new Spanish Prime Minister Felipe
Gonzalez said during the recent election campaign
that he would try to renogotiate a base agreement
with the United States signed only last July. Also,
Gonzalez said Spain would reconsider its member
ship in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization,
which it joined in May.
Stocks down in quiet trading
Stock prices suffered a broad setback today
amid uncertainty over prospects for further cuts in
the Federal Reserve's discount rate.
Trading was relatively quiet.
Today's weather
Partly cloudy today, showers likely with a
chance of thundershowers tapering off in the after
noon. Continued cool. Highs in the 50s. Lows to
night and Wednesday in the 30s and low 40s. Vari
able winds to 15 mph. Chance of measurable pre
cipitation 60 percent.

northern Pacific, according to the Navy.
U.S. population to increase
Washington — The U.S. population is likely to
rise by about a third to 309 million by the year
2050, then begin to decline, the Census Bureau said
yesterday.
It was the first time the bureau had classified
zero population growth as a likely outcome in this
country.
The bureau also said 21.7 percent of the popu
lation is likely to be over age 65 by 2050, up from
11.4 percent now, while blacks would probably
make up 16.8 percent then, as against 11.9 percent
now.
The new report said female life expectancy is ex
pected to rise to 83.6 years in 2050 from 78.3 now
and male life expectancy to 75.1 years from 70.7.
The U.S. population is now about 232 million
and is growing at a rate of about nine-tenths of 1
percent a year. The bureau said this growth rate is
likely gradually to fade and the nation is likely to
reach zero population growth by the middle of the
next century.
Marine exercises anger Spanish
Washington — U.S. Marines are about to make
an unpublicized practice landing on the Moroccan
coast, exacerbating delicate talks with a new So
cialist government in Spain, which already is balk
ing over American military bases and its member
ship in NATO.
"We would not like it," said a Spanish diplomat
who asked to remain anonymous. The official ob
jected to the location of the impending Marine
landing, near Spanish enclaves on the Moroccan
coast across from Gibraltar.
At least one senior Pentagon official is known to
have suggested that the U.S.-Moroccan exercise,
described as the first ever, be postponed or can
celled. But there was every indication yesterday
that the maneuvers would go ahead on schedule
starting today.
The exercise comes at a time when the United
States faces the possibility of tough negotiations
with the new Socialist Spanish government over
continued American use of key bases in Spain.
The new Spanish Prime Minister Felipe
Gonzalez said during the recent election campaign
that he would try to renogotiate a base agreement
with the United States signed only last July. Also,
Gonzalez said Spain would reconsider its member
ship in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization,
which it joined in May.

Begin testifies on massacre
Jerusalem — Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin testified yesterday
that he and his Cabinet raised no objection to the use of right-wing Christian
militiamen to invade the Palestinian refugee camps in Beirut despite a warn
ing from the army chief of staff that the Falangists might engage in "an out
burst of revenge."
Begin told the commission investigating the Sept. 16-18 massacre of
Palestinian civilians that he first learned of the decision to send the
Falangists into the camps when Defense Minister Ariel Sharon explained the
exercise to the Cabinet Sept. 16, several hours after the operation had begun.
At that time, the Cabinet could have called off the attack but chose not to do
so.
In his 45 minutes of public testimony before the three-member tribunal,
Begin said he never suspected that Falangists troops would kill women, chil
dren and old men. However, in a seeming contradiction, he also said that
prior to the massacre he was concerned about the possibility that Lebanese
Christians might seek revenge against the Moslem population for the as
sassination of President-elect Bashir Gemayel, the Falangist leader.
Confirming testimony that Sharon had given to the commission two
weeks ago, Begin said that the Cabinet agreed June IS, during the second
week of the war, to use the Israeli-armed and Israeli-trained Falangist forces
whenever possible in the fight against the Palestine Liberation Organization.
However, Begin said he was not told in advance of specific plans to use the
Falangists to mop up PLO guerrillas thought to be hiding in the Sabra and
Chatilla refugee camps.
Pope announces Polish visit
Warsaw, Poland — In a move apparently timed to dilute support for anti
regime strikes and protests called for later this week, the Polish government
and the Roman Catholic Church jointly announced yesterday that Pope
John Paul IPs long-delayed second visit to his homeland is set for June 18.
A communique released by both the official PAP news agency and the Of
fice of the Episcopate said that Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, head of the
martial-law regime, and Archbishop Jozef Glemp, primate of Poland, had
agreed to the date at a meeting yesterday morning.
The four-sentence communique also said that the two had discussed the
situation in the country and "expressed mutual concern over maintaining
and strengthening peace, social order and honest work."
The announcement came just two days before the date that was set by un
derground Solidarity leaders for new anti-government strikes and demon
strations to protest the formal banning of the free trade union last month.
Glemp, who has consistently voiced support for Solidarity, has nonetheless
joined the authorities in publicly opposing the planned protests for fear they
could lead to more bloodshed.
By setting a new date for the papal visit, both sides apparently hope to give
Poland's overwhelmingly Catholic population second thoughts about par
ticipating in more anti-government actions.
Larger deficit forecast
Washington — A budget deficit of $170 billion or
$ 175 billion is probable in this fiscal year and next,
director Alice Rivlin of the Congressional Budget
Office said yesterday.
A delayed recovery from the recession, plus
scaled-back forecasts of economic growth in 1983,
accounted for the forecast of the increased deficit
spending since the office's estimate of only two
months ago, Rivlin said.
"We're going to need a tax increase to get the
deficit down," she told reporters during a meeting.
"The question is how to do it in the least damaging
way to the economy."
Her comments came as President Reagan began
a series of meetings with his fiscal and economic
advisers before making decisions on the budget for
fiscal year 1984 that he will send to Congress in
January.
Reagan, who has rejected the idea of a tax in
crease next year, once predicted a deficit of only
$ 115 billion for the current fiscal year but that esti
mate clearly has become outdated.
The budget office in September estimated
budget deficits of $ 155 billion for the current fiscal
year and $ 152 billion for fiscal year 1984, which be
gins Oct. I, 1983.
Those estimates, Rivlin told reporters yesterday,
now appear to be clearly optimistic in view of the
"flat" economy so far in the fourth quarter and the
lower estimates of growth next year.
De Lorean pleads innocent
Los Angeles — Automaker John De Lorean
pleaded innocent yesterday to nine charges of co
caine trafficking and racketeering in an alleged
deal to sell $24 million in cocaine and raise money
for his ailing auto company.
Two co-defendants also pleaded innocent and
trial was set for Jan. 7. However, attorneys for all
three men indicated complicated pre-trial motions
could delay the trial's start.
Standing before U.S. District Judge Robert
Takasugi, De Lorean said he understood the
charges against him. Asked by the court clerk what
plea he wished to enter to the first count of the in
dictment, De Lorean answered in a firm voice,
"Not guilty."
The clerk then asked, "Is it your intention to
enter the same plea to the remaining charges
against you?"
"Yes," De Lorean said, "not guilty."
As De Lorean stepped back from the podium in
the center of the crowded courtroom, co-defendant
William Morgan Hetrick, stepped forward with his
lawyer and went through the same procedure, also
pleading not guilty.
The third defendant, Stephen Lee Arrington, the
only one of the three who came to court in prison
garb, stepped forward and said quickly, "Not guil
ty," when asked for his plea.
Hetrick's attorney, Stephen Wilson, said the 50-
vear-old aviation company owner wanted a review
of his bail, which is currently set at $20 million. The
judge scheduled a hearing for tomorrow morning
to consider that request.
Pension reforms suggested
Washington — The National Commission on

Social Security Reform released yesterday a laun
dry list of methods to shore up the system, ranging
from higher gasoline and whiskey taxes to belt
tightening measures for the 36 million benefi
ciaries.
The 15-member panelWs expected to pick and
choose later this week from among the options laid
out in the background book prepared by its staff.
The list suggests ways to revamp the system, pro
viding estimates of savings and how much each
idea could contribute to eradicating Social Secur
ity's deficits during the 1980s and over the next 75
years.
The menu includes such unpopular possibilities
as gradually raising the normal retirement age of
65, cutting cost-of-living increases and phasing in a
tax on Social Security benefits.
Noticeably absent from the list is any plan to
make Social Security voluntary or to jettison its so
called "welfare" aspects, such as the 50 percent
spouses' share of benefits or the skewed formula
that gives low-income workers relatively more for
their payroll tax dollar.
The commission is scheduled to hold a three-day
decision-making meeting starting Thursday in
Alexandria, Virginia.
Social Security's old age fund, which had to bor
row for the first time in history last month to cover
the November checks, faces shortages of $100
billion to $200 billion during the rest of the 1980s.
To cover that gap, the system needs either to gener
ate higher revenues or reduce its expenditures or
both.
Prison fire kills 27
Biloxi, Miss. — Twenty-seven prisoners died in
their county jail cells early yesterday when a former
mental patient set a fire in a padded cell and thick,
choking smoke raced through the ventilation sys
tem, knocking out the jailer who had the keys.
An additional 61 people were injured, including
firefighters, police officers, jailers and inmates of
the Harrison County Jail — almost all by smoke
inhalation. Hospitals said 10 inmates and a jailer
were in critical condition.
"The ones that stayed alive got wet towels and
wrapped them around their face or got in a shower
and put wet blankets over them," said Charlie
Acevedo, an inmate hospitalized for smoke inhala
tion. "The ones that didn't, died."
The former mental patient was being charged
with 27 counts of capital murder, said Albert
Necaise, the district attorney for Harrison County.
Those killed included 25 men and two women.
The inmates were asleep when the fire started at
about 1:30 a.m. and they were quickly overcome by
smoke from the smoldering polyurethane, a syn
thetic material used as protective padding in an
isolation cell, said Harold Windham, an assistant
fire chief.
Soviet bombers threaten carriers

Pension reforms suggested
Washington — The National Commission on

Social Security Reform released yesterday a laun
dry list of methods to shore up the system, ranging
from higher gasoline and whiskey taxes to belt
tightening measures for the 36 million benefi
ciaries.
The 15-member panelWs expected to pick and
choose later this week from among the options laid
out in the background book prepared by its staff.
The list suggests ways to revamp the system, pro
viding estimates of savings and how much each
idea could contribute to eradicating Social Secur
ity's deficits during the 1980s and over the next 75
years.
The menu includes such unpopular possibilities
as gradually raising the normal retirement age of
65, cutting cost-of-living increases and phasing in a
tax on Social Security benefits.
Noticeably absent from the list is any plan to
make Social Security voluntary or to jettison its so
called "welfare" aspects, such as the 50 percent
spouses' share of benefits or the skewed formula
that gives low-income workers relatively more for
their payroll tax dollar.
The commission is scheduled to hold a three-day
decision-making meeting starting Thursday in
Alexandria, Virginia.
Social Security's old age fund, which had to bor
row for the first time in history last month to cover
the November checks, faces shortages of $100
billion to $200 billion during the rest of the 1980s.
To cover that gap, the system needs either to gener
ate higher revenues or reduce its expenditures or
both.
Prison fire kills 27
Biloxi, Miss. — Twenty-seven prisoners died in
their county jail cells early yesterday when a former
mental patient set a fire in a padded cell and thick,
choking smoke raced through the ventilation sys
tem, knocking out the jailer who had the keys.
An additional 61 people were injured, including
firefighters, police officers, jailers and inmates of
the Harrison County Jail — almost all by smoke
inhalation. Hospitals said 10 inmates and a jailer
were in critical condition.
"The ones that stayed alive got wet towels and
wrapped them around their face or got in a shower
and put wet blankets over them," said Charlie
Acevedo, an inmate hospitalized for smoke inhala
tion. "The ones that didn't, died."
The former mental patient was being charged
with 27 counts of capital murder, said Albert
Necaise, the district attorney for Harrison County.
Those killed included 25 men and two women.
The inmates were asleep when the fire started at
about 1:30 a.m. and they were quickly overcome by
smoke from the smoldering polyurethane, a syn
thetic material used as protective padding in an
isolation cell, said Harold Windham, an assistant
fire chief.
Soviet bombers threaten carriers
Washington — Soviet supersonic Backfire
bombers have made their first simulated missile
strikes against U.S. aircraft carriers and started pa
trolling the Sea of Japan in what the Navy says
adds "a new dimension to the threat to the sea
lanes."
Even though the planes stayed about 120 miles
awav from the two carriers, that is well within the
striking range of the AS-4 Kitchen missiles they
carry, intelligence sources said.

The maneuvers occurred in late Sept. and early
Oct. during a major U.S. naval exercise in the
northern Pacific, according to the Navy.
U.S. population to increase
Washington — The U.S. population is likely to
rise by about a third to 309 million by the year
2050, then begin to decline, the Census Bureau said
yesterday.
It was the first time the bureau had classified
zero population growth as a likely outcome in this
country.
The bureau also said 21.7 percent of the popu
lation is likely to be over age 65 by 2050, up from
11.4 percent now, while blacks would probably
make up 16.8 percent then, as against 11.9 percent
now.
The new report said female life expectancy is ex
pected to rise to 83.6 years in 2050 from 78.3 now
and male life expectancy to 75.1 years from 70.7.
The U.S. population is now about 232 million
and is growing at a rate of about nine-tenths of 1
percent a year. The bureau said this growth rate is
likely gradually to fade and the nation is likely to
reach zero population growth by the middle of the
next century.
Marine exercises anger Spanish
Washington — U.S. Marines are about to make
an unpublicized practice landing on the Moroccan
coast, exacerbating delicate talks with a new So
cialist government in Spain, which already is balk
ing over American military bases and its member
ship in NATO.
"We would not like it," said a Spanish diplomat
who asked to remain anonymous. The official ob
jected to the location of the impending Marine
landing, near Spanish enclaves on the Moroccan
coast across from Gibraltar.
At least one senior Pentagon official is known to
have suggested that the U.S.-Moroccan exercise,
described as the first ever, be postponed or can
celled. But there was every indication yesterday
that the maneuvers would go ahead on schedule
starting today.
The exercise comes at a time when the United
States faces the possibility of tough negotiations
with the new Socialist Spanish government over
continued American use of key bases in Spain.
The new Spanish Prime Minister Felipe
Gonzalez said during the recent election campaign
that he would try to renogotiate a base agreement
with the United States signed only last July. Also,
Gonzalez said Spain would reconsider its member
ship in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization,
which it joined in May.

Begin testifies on massacre
Jerusalem — Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin testified yesterday
that he and his Cabinet raised no objection to the use of right-wing Christian
militiamen to invade the Palestinian refugee camps in Beirut despite a warn
ing from the army chief of staff that the Falangists might engage in "an out
burst of revenge."
Begin told the commission investigating the Sept. 16-18 massacre of
Palestinian civilians that he first learned of the decision to send the
Falangists into the camps when Defense Minister Ariel Sharon explained the
exercise to the Cabinet Sept. 16, several hours after the operation had begun.
At that time, the Cabinet could have called off the attack but chose not to do
so.
In his 45 minutes of public testimony before the three-member tribunal,
Begin said he never suspected that Falangists troops would kill women, chil
dren and old men. However, in a seeming contradiction, he also said that
prior to the massacre he was concerned about the possibility that Lebanese
Christians might seek revenge against the Moslem population for the as
sassination of President-elect Bashir Gemayel, the Falangist leader.
Confirming testimony that Sharon had given to the commission two
weeks ago, Begin said that the Cabinet agreed June IS, during the second
week of the war, to use the Israeli-armed and Israeli-trained Falangist forces
whenever possible in the fight against the Palestine Liberation Organization.
However, Begin said he was not told in advance of specific plans to use the
Falangists to mop up PLO guerrillas thought to be hiding in the Sabra and
Chatilla refugee camps.
Pope announces Polish visit
Warsaw, Poland — In a move apparently timed to dilute support for anti
regime strikes and protests called for later this week, the Polish government
and the Roman Catholic Church jointly announced yesterday that Pope
John Paul IPs long-delayed second visit to his homeland is set for June 18.
A communique released by both the official PAP news agency and the Of
fice of the Episcopate said that Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, head of the
martial-law regime, and Archbishop Jozef Glemp, primate of Poland, had
agreed to the date at a meeting yesterday morning.
The four-sentence communique also said that the two had discussed the
situation in the country and "expressed mutual concern over maintaining
and strengthening peace, social order and honest work."
The announcement came just two days before the date that was set by un
derground Solidarity leaders for new anti-government strikes and demon
strations to protest the formal banning of the free trade union last month.
Glemp, who has consistently voiced support for Solidarity, has nonetheless
joined the authorities in publicly opposing the planned protests for fear they
could lead to more bloodshed.
By setting a new date for the papal visit, both sides apparently hope to give
Poland's overwhelmingly Catholic population second thoughts about par
ticipating in more anti-government actions.
Larger deficit forecast
Washington — A budget deficit of $170 billion or
$ 175 billion is probable in this fiscal year and next,
director Alice Rivlin of the Congressional Budget
Office said yesterday.
A delayed recovery from the recession, plus
scaled-back forecasts of economic growth in 1983,
accounted for the forecast of the increased deficit
spending since the office's estimate of only two
months ago, Rivlin said.
"We're going to need a tax increase to get the
deficit down," she told reporters during a meeting.
"The question is how to do it in the least damaging
way to the economy."
Her comments came as President Reagan began
a series of meetings with his fiscal and economic
advisers before making decisions on the budget for
fiscal year 1984 that he will send to Congress in
January.
Reagan, who has rejected the idea of a tax in
crease next year, once predicted a deficit of only
$ 115 billion for the current fiscal year but that esti
mate clearly has become outdated.
The budget office in September estimated
budget deficits of $ 155 billion for the current fiscal
year and $ 152 billion for fiscal year 1984, which be
gins Oct. I, 1983.
Those estimates, Rivlin told reporters yesterday,
now appear to be clearly optimistic in view of the
"flat" economy so far in the fourth quarter and the
lower estimates of growth next year.
De Lorean pleads innocent
Los Angeles — Automaker John De Lorean
pleaded innocent yesterday to nine charges of co
caine trafficking and racketeering in an alleged
deal to sell $24 million in cocaine and raise money
for his ailing auto company.
Two co-defendants also pleaded innocent and
trial was set for Jan. 7. However, attorneys for all
three men indicated complicated pre-trial motions
could delay the trial's start.
Standing before U.S. District Judge Robert
Takasugi, De Lorean said he understood the
charges against him. Asked by the court clerk what
plea he wished to enter to the first count of the in
dictment, De Lorean answered in a firm voice,
"Not guilty."
The clerk then asked, "Is it your intention to
enter the same plea to the remaining charges
against you?"
"Yes," De Lorean said, "not guilty."
As De Lorean stepped back from the podium in
the center of the crowded courtroom, co-defendant
William Morgan Hetrick, stepped forward with his
lawyer and went through the same procedure, also
pleading not guilty.
The third defendant, Stephen Lee Arrington, the
only one of the three who came to court in prison
garb, stepped forward and said quickly, "Not guil
ty," when asked for his plea.
Hetrick's attorney, Stephen Wilson, said the 50-

agreed to the date at a meeting yesterday morning.
The four-sentence communique also said that the two had discussed the
situation in the country and "expressed mutual concern over maintaining
and strengthening peace, social order and honest work."
The announcement came just two days before the date that was set by un
derground Solidarity leaders for new anti-government strikes and demon
strations to protest the formal banning of the free trade union last month.
Glemp, who has consistently voiced support for Solidarity, has nonetheless
joined the authorities in publicly opposing the planned protests for fear they
could lead to more bloodshed.
By setting a new date for the papal visit, both sides apparently hope to give
Poland's overwhelmingly Catholic population second thoughts about par
ticipating in more anti-government actions.
Larger deficit forecast
Washington — A budget deficit of $170 billion or
$ 175 billion is probable in this fiscal year and next,
director Alice Rivlin of the Congressional Budget
Office said yesterday.
A delayed recovery from the recession, plus
scaled-back forecasts of economic growth in 1983,
accounted for the forecast of the increased deficit
spending since the office's estimate of only two
months ago, Rivlin said.
"We're going to need a tax increase to get the
deficit down," she told reporters during a meeting.
"The question is how to do it in the least damaging
way to the economy."
Her comments came as President Reagan began
a series of meetings with his fiscal and economic
advisers before making decisions on the budget for
fiscal year 1984 that he will send to Congress in
January.
Reagan, who has rejected the idea of a tax in
crease next year, once predicted a deficit of only
$ 115 billion for the current fiscal year but that esti
mate clearly has become outdated.
The budget office in September estimated
budget deficits of $ 155 billion for the current fiscal
year and $ 152 billion for fiscal year 1984, which be
gins Oct. I, 1983.
Those estimates, Rivlin told reporters yesterday,
now appear to be clearly optimistic in view of the
"flat" economy so far in the fourth quarter and the
lower estimates of growth next year.
De Lorean pleads innocent
Los Angeles — Automaker John De Lorean
pleaded innocent yesterday to nine charges of co
caine trafficking and racketeering in an alleged
deal to sell $24 million in cocaine and raise money
for his ailing auto company.
Two co-defendants also pleaded innocent and
trial was set for Jan. 7. However, attorneys for all
three men indicated complicated pre-trial motions
could delay the trial's start.
Standing before U.S. District Judge Robert
Takasugi, De Lorean said he understood the
charges against him. Asked by the court clerk what
plea he wished to enter to the first count of the in
dictment, De Lorean answered in a firm voice,
"Not guilty."
The clerk then asked, "Is it your intention to
enter the same plea to the remaining charges
against you?"
"Yes," De Lorean said, "not guilty."
As De Lorean stepped back from the podium in
the center of the crowded courtroom, co-defendant
William Morgan Hetrick, stepped forward with his
lawyer and went through the same procedure, also
pleading not guilty.
The third defendant, Stephen Lee Arrington, the
only one of the three who came to court in prison
garb, stepped forward and said quickly, "Not guil
ty," when asked for his plea.
Hetrick's attorney, Stephen Wilson, said the 50-
vear-old aviation company owner wanted a review
of his bail, which is currently set at $20 million. The
judge scheduled a hearing for tomorrow morning
to consider that request.
Pension reforms suggested
Washington — The National Commission on

Social Security Reform released yesterday a laun
dry list of methods to shore up the system, ranging
from higher gasoline and whiskey taxes to belt
tightening measures for the 36 million benefi
ciaries.
The 15-member panelWs expected to pick and
choose later this week from among the options laid
out in the background book prepared by its staff.
The list suggests ways to revamp the system, pro
viding estimates of savings and how much each
idea could contribute to eradicating Social Secur
ity's deficits during the 1980s and over the next 75
years.
The menu includes such unpopular possibilities
as gradually raising the normal retirement age of
65, cutting cost-of-living increases and phasing in a
tax on Social Security benefits.
Noticeably absent from the list is any plan to
make Social Security voluntary or to jettison its so
called "welfare" aspects, such as the 50 percent
spouses' share of benefits or the skewed formula
that gives low-income workers relatively more for
their payroll tax dollar.
The commission is scheduled to hold a three-day
decision-making meeting starting Thursday in
Alexandria, Virginia.
Social Security's old age fund, which had to bor
row for the first time in history last month to cover
the November checks, faces shortages of $100
billion to $200 billion during the rest of the 1980s.
To cover that gap, the system needs either to gener
ate higher revenues or reduce its expenditures or
both.
Prison fire kills 27
Biloxi, Miss. — Twenty-seven prisoners died in
their county jail cells early yesterday when a former
mental patient set a fire in a padded cell and thick,
choking smoke raced through the ventilation sys
tem, knocking out the jailer who had the keys.
An additional 61 people were injured, including
firefighters, police officers, jailers and inmates of
the Harrison County Jail — almost all by smoke
inhalation. Hospitals said 10 inmates and a jailer
were in critical condition.
"The ones that stayed alive got wet towels and
wrapped them around their face or got in a shower
and put wet blankets over them," said Charlie
Acevedo, an inmate hospitalized for smoke inhala
tion. "The ones that didn't, died."
The former mental patient was being charged
with 27 counts of capital murder, said Albert
Necaise, the district attorney for Harrison County.
Those killed included 25 men and two women.
The inmates were asleep when the fire started at
about 1:30 a.m. and they were quickly overcome by
smoke from the smoldering polyurethane, a syn
thetic material used as protective padding in an
isolation cell, said Harold Windham, an assistant
fire chief.
Soviet bombers threaten carriers
Washington — Soviet supersonic Backfire
bombers have made their first simulated missile
strikes against U.S. aircraft carriers and started pa
trolling the Sea of Japan in what the Navy says
adds "a new dimension to the threat to the sea
lanes."
Even though the planes stayed about 120 miles
awav from the two carriers, that is well within the
striking range of the AS-4 Kitchen missiles they
carry, intelligence sources said.

The maneuvers occurred in late Sept. and early
Oct. during a major U.S. naval exercise in the
northern Pacific, according to the Navy.
U.S. population to increase
Washington — The U.S. population is likely to
rise by about a third to 309 million by the year
2050, then begin to decline, the Census Bureau said
yesterday.
It was the first time the bureau had classified
zero population growth as a likely outcome in this
country.
The bureau also said 21.7 percent of the popu
lation is likely to be over age 65 by 2050, up from
11.4 percent now, while blacks would probably
make up 16.8 percent then, as against 11.9 percent
now.
The new report said female life expectancy is ex
pected to rise to 83.6 years in 2050 from 78.3 now
and male life expectancy to 75.1 years from 70.7.
The U.S. population is now about 232 million
and is growing at a rate of about nine-tenths of 1
percent a year. The bureau said this growth rate is
likely gradually to fade and the nation is likely to
reach zero population growth by the middle of the
next century.
Marine exercises anger Spanish
Washington — U.S. Marines are about to make
an unpublicized practice landing on the Moroccan
coast, exacerbating delicate talks with a new So
cialist government in Spain, which already is balk
ing over American military bases and its member
ship in NATO.
"We would not like it," said a Spanish diplomat
who asked to remain anonymous. The official ob
jected to the location of the impending Marine
landing, near Spanish enclaves on the Moroccan
coast across from Gibraltar.
At least one senior Pentagon official is known to
have suggested that the U.S.-Moroccan exercise,
described as the first ever, be postponed or can
celled. But there was every indication yesterday
that the maneuvers would go ahead on schedule
starting today.
The exercise comes at a time when the United
States faces the possibility of tough negotiations
with the new Socialist Spanish government over
continued American use of key bases in Spain.
The new Spanish Prime Minister Felipe
Gonzalez said during the recent election campaign
that he would try to renogotiate a base agreement
with the United States signed only last July. Also,
Gonzalez said Spain would reconsider its member
ship in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization,
which it joined in May.
Stocks down in quiet trading
