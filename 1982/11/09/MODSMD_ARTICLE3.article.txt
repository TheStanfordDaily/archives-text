Begin testifies on massacre
Jerusalem — Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin testified yesterday
that he and his Cabinet raised no objection to the use of right-wing Christian
militiamen to invade the Palestinian refugee camps in Beirut despite a warn
ing from the army chief of staff that the Falangists might engage in "an out
burst of revenge."
Begin told the commission investigating the Sept. 16-18 massacre of
Palestinian civilians that he first learned of the decision to send the
Falangists into the camps when Defense Minister Ariel Sharon explained the
exercise to the Cabinet Sept. 16, several hours after the operation had begun.
At that time, the Cabinet could have called off the attack but chose not to do
so.
In his 45 minutes of public testimony before the three-member tribunal,
Begin said he never suspected that Falangists troops would kill women, chil
dren and old men. However, in a seeming contradiction, he also said that
prior to the massacre he was concerned about the possibility that Lebanese
Christians might seek revenge against the Moslem population for the as
sassination of President-elect Bashir Gemayel, the Falangist leader.
Confirming testimony that Sharon had given to the commission two
weeks ago, Begin said that the Cabinet agreed June IS, during the second
week of the war, to use the Israeli-armed and Israeli-trained Falangist forces
whenever possible in the fight against the Palestine Liberation Organization.
However, Begin said he was not told in advance of specific plans to use the
Falangists to mop up PLO guerrillas thought to be hiding in the Sabra and
Chatilla refugee camps.
Pope announces Polish visit
Warsaw, Poland — In a move apparently timed to dilute support for anti
regime strikes and protests called for later this week, the Polish government
and the Roman Catholic Church jointly announced yesterday that Pope
John Paul IPs long-delayed second visit to his homeland is set for June 18.
A communique released by both the official PAP news agency and the Of
fice of the Episcopate said that Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, head of the
martial-law regime, and Archbishop Jozef Glemp, primate of Poland, had
agreed to the date at a meeting yesterday morning.
The four-sentence communique also said that the two had discussed the
situation in the country and "expressed mutual concern over maintaining
and strengthening peace, social order and honest work."
The announcement came just two days before the date that was set by un
derground Solidarity leaders for new anti-government strikes and demon
strations to protest the formal banning of the free trade union last month.
Glemp, who has consistently voiced support for Solidarity, has nonetheless
joined the authorities in publicly opposing the planned protests for fear they
could lead to more bloodshed.
By setting a new date for the papal visit, both sides apparently hope to give
Poland's overwhelmingly Catholic population second thoughts about par
ticipating in more anti-government actions.
