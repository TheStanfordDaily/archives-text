# Police unveil goods, seek arrest warrant
## 
### ADAM GOODMAN 
Stanford Police yesterday planned to
obtain a warrant for the arrest of Rob
ert O'Connor, whom police now believe
may have been involved in more than
l3oMid-Peninsula burglaries of goods
with a value of more than $3 million.
Police would neither confirm nor
deny whether additional warrants may
be forthcoming.
Stanford Police Captain Raoul
Niemeyer, who is heading the investiga
tion, announced at a press conference
yesterday morning that police weretftill
searching for O'Connor, who fled from
his La Honda home last Thursday when
police arrived to question his wife. An
all-points-bulletin has already been is
sued.
When asked whether O'Connor was
considered dangerous, Niemeyer re
plied, "He has had a large number of
firearms and may have others. From his
history, though, he would rather run."
Niemeyer also unveiled an 18-foot U-
Haul truck stuffed with $750,000 worth
of allegedly stolen merchandise which
was confiscated from O'Connor's home
at 84 Sears Ranch Rd. Police will not
begin unloading and cataloging the
merchandise until today, Niemeyer
said.
Items in the truck include many art
collections of both paintings and
sculptures as well as items such as
stamps, coins, rugs, sporting goods, a
cello, a guitar, bikes and tires.
The items were confiscated Thursday
when Stanford and Palo Alto police,
along with FBI agent Mike Keeley,
went to O'Connor's La Honda resi
dence to discuss property left at a pawn
shop by O'Connor's wife, Maureen.
The police did not have a search war
rant when they arrived. When police
knocked on the front door, the man be
lieved to be O'Connor ran out the back.
When Maureen O'Connor arrived lat
er, she refused to consent to a search of
the home. Police waited until Niemeyer
and Keeley came back with a warrant
before they entered the house.
Niemeyer said yesterday that he
could not have obtained a warrant "lo
cally"beforehand. According to
Keeley, the U.S. Attorney's Office had
not issued a warrant earlier either but
rather "had the matter under review."
According to Keeley, the FBI was
notified somewhat less than six months
ago of the O'Connor case.
Niemeyer said that through the
months the case was shuttled "back and
forth" between the FBI and local au
thorities because the FBI had "higher

priorities."
Keeley said he was not "at liberty to
say" if the FBI had been responsible for
any delay in the case because of other
pressing matters. "We did some in
vestigation and we will do some addi
tional investigation," he said.
Niemeyer also revealed that Stanford
and other area police have staged "un
successful" stakeouts in order to catch
O'Connor. He described a three-week
stakeout of Stanford and surroundftig
area neighborhoods.
"He avoided us like the plague, like
he knew we were out there," Niemeyer
said. "Maybe he had a scanner."
The stakeouts began after
O'Connor's arrest by Menlo Park Po
lice more than a year ago when a police
officer found a white Saab registered to
O'Connor with stolen goods from an
interrupted burglary in it. O'Connor's
wallet was also in the car.
The police officer also saw a man in a
jogging suit jump out of nearby bushes
and run away. Because police were un
able to obtain sufficient visual identi
fication that O'Connor was the man
seen, he was released.
"We were very, very frustrated. We
knew who was doing it but couldn't
prove it," Niemeyer said.

Niemeyer said he believes O'Connor
operated independently or with only a
few accomplices. The suspect is de
scribed as a very athletic white male,
five-feet 11 inches tall, 39 years old, 150
pounds, with collar length curly brown
hair, a moustache and beard, and a
large split between his front teeth.
Though Niemeyer did not say if
O'Connor was currently employed, he
said the suspect is believed to have been
a jeweler, photographer, teacher and
track coach. "We have information
that he has a degree in art, specifically in
Asian and Indian art," Niemeyer said.


Robert O'Connor
"He appears to be a very intelligent
individual. He does know art."
Niemeyer insisted that O'Connor is
not believed to be a member of any
large burglary ring. He said police now
think that O'Connor was responsible
for the so-called "twilight burglaries"
beginning in 1981 as well as more recent
cat burglaries. The twilight burglaries
occurred mostly between the hours of 5

p.m. and 6 p.m. while people were not
at home. The cat burglaries usually oc
curred after midnight while people were
at home, Niemever said. Niemeyer said
faculty homes, but no student resi
dences, were included in the burglaries.
Niemeyer said when police finish
cataloging the confiscated goods, he
will assign a couple of days to match
goods with owners. Mid-Peninsula vic
tims burglarized since early 1981 who
think their property may have been re
covered should obtain a copy of police
reports and call (415) 497-9639.

covered should obtain a copy of police
reports and call (415) 497-9639.
Stanford Police yesterday planned to
obtain a warrant for the arrest of Rob
ert O'Connor, whom police now believe
may have been involved in more than
l3oMid-Peninsula burglaries of goods
with a value of more than $3 million.
Police would neither confirm nor
deny whether additional warrants may
be forthcoming.
Stanford Police Captain Raoul
Niemeyer, who is heading the investiga
tion, announced at a press conference
yesterday morning that police weretftill
searching for O'Connor, who fled from
his La Honda home last Thursday when
police arrived to question his wife. An
all-points-bulletin has already been is
sued.
When asked whether O'Connor was
considered dangerous, Niemeyer re
plied, "He has had a large number of
firearms and may have others. From his
history, though, he would rather run."
Niemeyer also unveiled an 18-foot U-
Haul truck stuffed with $750,000 worth
of allegedly stolen merchandise which
was confiscated from O'Connor's home
at 84 Sears Ranch Rd. Police will not
begin unloading and cataloging the
merchandise until today, Niemeyer
said.
Items in the truck include many art
collections of both paintings and
sculptures as well as items such as
stamps, coins, rugs, sporting goods, a
cello, a guitar, bikes and tires.
The items were confiscated Thursday
when Stanford and Palo Alto police,
along with FBI agent Mike Keeley,
went to O'Connor's La Honda resi
dence to discuss property left at a pawn
shop by O'Connor's wife, Maureen.
The police did not have a search war
rant when they arrived. When police
knocked on the front door, the man be
lieved to be O'Connor ran out the back.
When Maureen O'Connor arrived lat
er, she refused to consent to a search of
the home. Police waited until Niemeyer
and Keeley came back with a warrant
before they entered the house.
Niemeyer said yesterday that he
could not have obtained a warrant "lo
cally"beforehand. According to
Keeley, the U.S. Attorney's Office had
not issued a warrant earlier either but
rather "had the matter under review."
According to Keeley, the FBI was
notified somewhat less than six months
ago of the O'Connor case.
Niemeyer said that through the
months the case was shuttled "back and
forth" between the FBI and local au
thorities because the FBI had "higher

priorities."
Keeley said he was not "at liberty to
say" if the FBI had been responsible for
any delay in the case because of other
pressing matters. "We did some in
vestigation and we will do some addi
tional investigation," he said.
Niemeyer also revealed that Stanford
and other area police have staged "un
successful" stakeouts in order to catch
O'Connor. He described a three-week
stakeout of Stanford and surroundftig
area neighborhoods.
"He avoided us like the plague, like
he knew we were out there," Niemeyer
said. "Maybe he had a scanner."
The stakeouts began after
O'Connor's arrest by Menlo Park Po
lice more than a year ago when a police
officer found a white Saab registered to
O'Connor with stolen goods from an
interrupted burglary in it. O'Connor's
wallet was also in the car.
The police officer also saw a man in a
jogging suit jump out of nearby bushes
and run away. Because police were un
able to obtain sufficient visual identi
fication that O'Connor was the man
seen, he was released.
"We were very, very frustrated. We
knew who was doing it but couldn't
prove it," Niemeyer said.

Niemeyer said he believes O'Connor
operated independently or with only a
few accomplices. The suspect is de
scribed as a very athletic white male,
five-feet 11 inches tall, 39 years old, 150
pounds, with collar length curly brown
hair, a moustache and beard, and a
large split between his front teeth.
Though Niemeyer did not say if
O'Connor was currently employed, he
said the suspect is believed to have been
a jeweler, photographer, teacher and
track coach. "We have information
that he has a degree in art, specifically in
Asian and Indian art," Niemeyer said.


Robert O'Connor
"He appears to be a very intelligent
individual. He does know art."
Niemeyer insisted that O'Connor is
not believed to be a member of any
large burglary ring. He said police now
think that O'Connor was responsible
for the so-called "twilight burglaries"
beginning in 1981 as well as more recent
cat burglaries. The twilight burglaries
occurred mostly between the hours of 5

p.m. and 6 p.m. while people were not
at home. The cat burglaries usually oc
curred after midnight while people were
at home, Niemever said. Niemeyer said
faculty homes, but no student resi
dences, were included in the burglaries.
Niemeyer said when police finish
cataloging the confiscated goods, he
will assign a couple of days to match
goods with owners. Mid-Peninsula vic
tims burglarized since early 1981 who
think their property may have been re
covered should obtain a copy of police
reports and call (415) 497-9639.
