# Basement overtaken
## Cro Mem residents fight to remove University office 
### CAROLINE RHOADS 
The residents of Crothers Memorial
Hall have called upon the ASSU to
pressure the University to relocate the
Residence Hall Manager's office
(RMO), which takes up two rooms in
the dorm's basement.
The residents are also trying to stop
planned expansion of the office, which
is responsible for the physical upkeep of
University dormitories.
RMO moved into Cro Mem three
years ago and officials recently in
dicated that they want to expand its
outer office into the dorm's library.
Residents averted a similar attempt in
the fall of 1979.
Students in Cro Mem have met with
Yolanda Townsend, ASSU council of
presidents member, because they be
lieve the ASSU will be able to convince
the University that RMO should not be
located in the residence. Although these
meetings have not vet produced any
substantial progress, participants hope
the University will be convinced to
cancel plans to expand the office.
Neil Midkiff, a resident of Cro Mem
since 1977, has drawn up a white paper
listing the students' proposals for re
locating the office and reallocating the
space which is now taken up by the of
fice.
"Ideally, we feel that the RMO
should not be located in a dorm," he
said. At the same time, according to
Midkiff, the residents recognize space
problems and are working directly with
the RMO to come up with alternatives.
Students have proposed that the
R MO be moved to two trailers in Man
zanita Park, which will be vacant when
260 students move from the trailers to
the suites at Governor's Corner during
winter quarter.
According to Robert Mibach, facil
ities manager for residence halls, Cro
Mem is an ideal location for the RMO

because it has a central location.
Mibach said the trailers would be inap
propriate because the office would be
taking up living space which would oth
erwise be available to students and be
cause the RMO does not oversee Man
zanita Park operations.
The RMO also contends that it needs

to expand its operations in Cro Mem
because its working area is too con
gested presently.
Sam Stevens, a former Cro Mem resi
dent, who has been involved in the issue
since 1979, gives a variety of reasons —
from the diverse nationalities of the res
idents to their irregular working hours

— why the RMO should not expand
more into Cro Mem.
Charlie Jackson, ASSU senator and
Cro Mem resident, concurs. He said
that the expansion proposed by the
RMO is not feasible because it would
relocate the students' library next to the
laundry room, which is noisy.


STUDENTS RELAX IN THE LOUNGE: Residents
of Crothers Memorial Hall socialize and study in a com
rnOß area. However, part of their basement previously

Hall Manager's office. Some students are upset and
have asked the ASSU for help In reclaiming the area.
