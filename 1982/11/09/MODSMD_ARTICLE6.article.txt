## University's Greek system Sororities at Stanford 
### KATHY REHM 
The following article is the first installment of a
three-part series on the sorority and fraternity sys
tem — the Greek system — at Stanford. Today's
article deals with Stanford students in sororities.
Tomorrow's installment will look at the problems
with fraternities' images here while the final piece
will examine the sororities' and fraternities' rela
tionship to the University.
You look up from your books in second floor
Meyer to see some giggling women hopping up
the stairs with their shoelaces tied together. You
pass it off as freshman antics but later, on your
way home, you pass by chalk outlines of bodies
in White Plaza and then hear some spirited sing
ing directed at fraternity house windows. More
freshman midterm release? Nope — these ac
tivities are only a part of a Stanford sorority in
itiation.

Do female Greeks really exist at Stanford?
Why don't they have houses like most of their
male counterparts? What in the world do they
do? As Alpha Phi Kirsten Sanders says, "We
sort 0f... developed our own traditions here."
According to intersorority council (ISC) pres
ident Suzanne Schendel, since a 1977 Title IX
suit revoked the board of trustee's 1944 decision
to ban sororities on campus, the groups have
been gaining membership — but this time
without University housing. Most members say
that they like it that way. "We've decided that we
don't want a house," said junior Cheryl Korte of
Delta Gamma. "It's just that kind of image we
don't want."
Sorority members agree that the uniqueness
of the Stanford system lies in the fact that the
selective groups are not housed together. Al
though the sororities are classified by the Uni
versity as groups "which are not yet, but aspire
to be, residential or residentialiy located," none
of the groups is currently working toward attain
ing a housing system similar to that of Stanford's
fraternities. "Personally, I hope housing is a
long way off," Schendel said.
The board of trustees decision to prohibit
sororities and sorority houses from campus was
made in an effort to eliminate the conflict be
tween the sororitv row house members and the

women in dorms, which at the time were single
sex. Since the 1977 cancellation of the ban, the
sororities have been actively working toward re
gaining University recognition by diluting na
tional chapter control with what the University
terms "autonomy."
In addition, the six ISC members are all af
filiated with their national chapters, something
of which the University doesn't wholly approve.
Diana Conklin, director of the Row, cites na
tional control as the basis of the University's re
fusal to recognize four of the six. Delta Gamma
and Sigma Delta Tau, as recognized groups,
have the right to meet on campus if they desire.
Unrecognized groups must meet off campus in
apartments or alumni homes, an inconvenience
which members are painfully aware of— espe
cially during rush, when time, safety and trans
portation are important considerations.
The reasons why Stanford women have joined
sororities vary, but most members agree with
Theta pledge Jeanette Howard that "it's a good
way to meet other women." Sanders said a rea
son she rushed was that she missed the
camaraderie of her all-female high school. Social
contact seems to be a major factor in the to-rush
or-not-to-rush decision; many members said
that they were anxious to meet people outside of
their dorm or their major.
Last spring's rush open house was held in a
Palo Alto junior high school, where rushing
females were directed from room to room every
30 minutes. "It can be ego-deflating when you go
through rush because they judge you on 20
minutes of knowing you," Howard said. "I
didn't enjoy the experience much."
Korte, too, was turned off by the prospect of
spring formal rush. "It seemed really impersonal
that you would meet someone and talk for 10
minutes and judge their personality." She in
stead went through open rush, which she con
siders "more relaxed." Open rush is carried on
year-round by groups which didn't meet the
quota set during formal rush.
None of the active members seemed to enjoy
formal rush either. Schendel said, "It's hard for
a girl to tell what we're like during formal rush."
Nevertheless, the goal is "to let all the sororities
see all the girls and all the girls see all the
sororities."
While groups use slide shows and friendly
smiles to entice prospective members to their
turf, the rushing women are worrying about
their charm and appearance. "Everyone tries to
have the best party," Sanders explained. "That's
the nature of rush, I guess."
Allen noted that while jeans and t-shirts are
disallowed, nice dress is "part of selling your
self."
According to Schendel, the selection of
pledges if basically intuitive. "It's hard to say
what we look for," she said thoughtfully. "It's a
shame we have to pick."
"I don't think there was as much competition
between the people in the sororities as there was


Tcrri Bovle/Daily
between those who were trying to get in," How
ard said of last year's rush. She noted that some
sorority hopefuls were disappointed that they
didn't receive a bid from the sorority of their
choice, although Schendel called the six groups
"all basically the same."
While traditions such as group ceremonies,
colors and emblems differ from group to group,
the primary distinguishing factor between Stan
ford's female Greeks seems to be the individuals
within the group at the given time. Every group
has a specific charity for which they raise money
throughout the year.
Alpha PhiA, sqlj balloons and lollipops to
raise money for the heart fund, while Allen said
that some of the Kappa dues — around $90 per
quarter for actives — goes toward their charity,
the Association for the Blind.
So why do Stanford sororities keep such a low
profile? Members agree that it's because the
groups don't have on-campus housing and em
phasize the fact that a major attraction of the
Greek system is that it isn't large and pre-domi
nant. Korte said quietly, "I'm glad they don't
push it on you here."
Sanders compared it to Greek systems at USC
and Berkeley: "It's not the central part of Stan
ford existence to be in the Greek system." She

added that she wouldn't want it that way. "Hav
ing to spend that much time so you're always
trying to impress people superficially is not very
appealing to me," she said.
Schendel, constantly worried about the
groups' public image, pointed out a unique
aspect of the Stanford system. During formal
rush, a rushee is guaranteed a spot in one of the
six ISC groups if she is willing to be accepted into
any one of them. Allen said that although she as
a prospective member put down all six on her
preference card, that's "not common."
"People get the impression that we're ex
clusive little clubs," Schendel noted. "It just isn't
true." In answer to a common accusation, she
defended, "discrimination is not a practice in
which we engage," adding that "there may be
nothing we can do" about stereotyping.
Fully aware of the common labels, sorority
members are anxious to improve their image. Al
len, concerned with the groups' images, is eager
to "make people realize we're not a bunch of
stuffy girls who sit around and drink tea." Allen
is frustrated that "a lot of people come here with
preconceived notions of what a sorority is."
Sanders admitted that she didn't want any
part of the sorority system during the first part of
her freshman year, because of stories she'd heard
from USC sororities, but she went through rush
just to see what it was like. "I'm glad I went
through so I could evaluate it for myself," How
ard said.

with fraternities' images here while the final piece
will examine the sororities' and fraternities' rela
tionship to the University.
You look up from your books in second floor
Meyer to see some giggling women hopping up
the stairs with their shoelaces tied together. You
pass it off as freshman antics but later, on your
way home, you pass by chalk outlines of bodies
in White Plaza and then hear some spirited sing
ing directed at fraternity house windows. More
freshman midterm release? Nope — these ac
tivities are only a part of a Stanford sorority in
itiation.

Do female Greeks really exist at Stanford?
Why don't they have houses like most of their
male counterparts? What in the world do they
do? As Alpha Phi Kirsten Sanders says, "We
sort 0f... developed our own traditions here."
According to intersorority council (ISC) pres
ident Suzanne Schendel, since a 1977 Title IX
suit revoked the board of trustee's 1944 decision
to ban sororities on campus, the groups have
been gaining membership — but this time
without University housing. Most members say
that they like it that way. "We've decided that we
don't want a house," said junior Cheryl Korte of
Delta Gamma. "It's just that kind of image we
don't want."
Sorority members agree that the uniqueness
of the Stanford system lies in the fact that the
selective groups are not housed together. Al
though the sororities are classified by the Uni
versity as groups "which are not yet, but aspire
to be, residential or residentialiy located," none
of the groups is currently working toward attain
ing a housing system similar to that of Stanford's
fraternities. "Personally, I hope housing is a
long way off," Schendel said.
The board of trustees decision to prohibit
sororities and sorority houses from campus was
made in an effort to eliminate the conflict be
tween the sororitv row house members and the

women in dorms, which at the time were single
sex. Since the 1977 cancellation of the ban, the
sororities have been actively working toward re
gaining University recognition by diluting na
tional chapter control with what the University
terms "autonomy."
In addition, the six ISC members are all af
filiated with their national chapters, something
of which the University doesn't wholly approve.
Diana Conklin, director of the Row, cites na
tional control as the basis of the University's re
fusal to recognize four of the six. Delta Gamma
and Sigma Delta Tau, as recognized groups,
have the right to meet on campus if they desire.
Unrecognized groups must meet off campus in
apartments or alumni homes, an inconvenience
which members are painfully aware of— espe
cially during rush, when time, safety and trans
portation are important considerations.
The reasons why Stanford women have joined
sororities vary, but most members agree with
Theta pledge Jeanette Howard that "it's a good
way to meet other women." Sanders said a rea
son she rushed was that she missed the
camaraderie of her all-female high school. Social
contact seems to be a major factor in the to-rush
or-not-to-rush decision; many members said
that they were anxious to meet people outside of
their dorm or their major.
Last spring's rush open house was held in a
Palo Alto junior high school, where rushing
females were directed from room to room every
30 minutes. "It can be ego-deflating when you go
through rush because they judge you on 20
minutes of knowing you," Howard said. "I
didn't enjoy the experience much."
Korte, too, was turned off by the prospect of
spring formal rush. "It seemed really impersonal
that you would meet someone and talk for 10
minutes and judge their personality." She in
stead went through open rush, which she con
siders "more relaxed." Open rush is carried on
year-round by groups which didn't meet the
quota set during formal rush.
None of the active members seemed to enjoy
formal rush either. Schendel said, "It's hard for
a girl to tell what we're like during formal rush."
Nevertheless, the goal is "to let all the sororities
see all the girls and all the girls see all the
sororities."
While groups use slide shows and friendly
smiles to entice prospective members to their
turf, the rushing women are worrying about
their charm and appearance. "Everyone tries to
have the best party," Sanders explained. "That's
the nature of rush, I guess."
Allen noted that while jeans and t-shirts are
disallowed, nice dress is "part of selling your
self."
According to Schendel, the selection of
pledges if basically intuitive. "It's hard to say
what we look for," she said thoughtfully. "It's a
shame we have to pick."
"I don't think there was as much competition
between the people in the sororities as there was


Tcrri Bovle/Daily
between those who were trying to get in," How
ard said of last year's rush. She noted that some
sorority hopefuls were disappointed that they
didn't receive a bid from the sorority of their
choice, although Schendel called the six groups
"all basically the same."
While traditions such as group ceremonies,
colors and emblems differ from group to group,
the primary distinguishing factor between Stan
ford's female Greeks seems to be the individuals
within the group at the given time. Every group
has a specific charity for which they raise money
throughout the year.
Alpha PhiA, sqlj balloons and lollipops to
raise money for the heart fund, while Allen said
that some of the Kappa dues — around $90 per
quarter for actives — goes toward their charity,
the Association for the Blind.
So why do Stanford sororities keep such a low
profile? Members agree that it's because the
groups don't have on-campus housing and em
phasize the fact that a major attraction of the
Greek system is that it isn't large and pre-domi
nant. Korte said quietly, "I'm glad they don't
push it on you here."
Sanders compared it to Greek systems at USC
and Berkeley: "It's not the central part of Stan
ford existence to be in the Greek system." She

added that she wouldn't want it that way. "Hav
ing to spend that much time so you're always
trying to impress people superficially is not very
appealing to me," she said.
Schendel, constantly worried about the
groups' public image, pointed out a unique
aspect of the Stanford system. During formal
rush, a rushee is guaranteed a spot in one of the
six ISC groups if she is willing to be accepted into
any one of them. Allen said that although she as
a prospective member put down all six on her
preference card, that's "not common."
"People get the impression that we're ex
clusive little clubs," Schendel noted. "It just isn't
true." In answer to a common accusation, she
defended, "discrimination is not a practice in
which we engage," adding that "there may be
nothing we can do" about stereotyping.
Fully aware of the common labels, sorority
members are anxious to improve their image. Al
len, concerned with the groups' images, is eager
to "make people realize we're not a bunch of
stuffy girls who sit around and drink tea." Allen
is frustrated that "a lot of people come here with
preconceived notions of what a sorority is."
Sanders admitted that she didn't want any
part of the sorority system during the first part of
her freshman year, because of stories she'd heard
from USC sororities, but she went through rush
just to see what it was like. "I'm glad I went
through so I could evaluate it for myself," How
ard said.

pass it off as freshman antics but later, on your
way home, you pass by chalk outlines of bodies
in White Plaza and then hear some spirited sing
ing directed at fraternity house windows. More
freshman midterm release? Nope — these ac
tivities are only a part of a Stanford sorority in
itiation.

Do female Greeks really exist at Stanford?
Why don't they have houses like most of their
male counterparts? What in the world do they
do? As Alpha Phi Kirsten Sanders says, "We
sort 0f... developed our own traditions here."
According to intersorority council (ISC) pres
ident Suzanne Schendel, since a 1977 Title IX
suit revoked the board of trustee's 1944 decision
to ban sororities on campus, the groups have
been gaining membership — but this time
without University housing. Most members say
that they like it that way. "We've decided that we
don't want a house," said junior Cheryl Korte of
Delta Gamma. "It's just that kind of image we
don't want."
Sorority members agree that the uniqueness
of the Stanford system lies in the fact that the
selective groups are not housed together. Al
though the sororities are classified by the Uni
versity as groups "which are not yet, but aspire
to be, residential or residentialiy located," none
of the groups is currently working toward attain
ing a housing system similar to that of Stanford's
fraternities. "Personally, I hope housing is a
long way off," Schendel said.
The board of trustees decision to prohibit
sororities and sorority houses from campus was
made in an effort to eliminate the conflict be
tween the sororitv row house members and the

women in dorms, which at the time were single
sex. Since the 1977 cancellation of the ban, the
sororities have been actively working toward re
gaining University recognition by diluting na
tional chapter control with what the University
terms "autonomy."
In addition, the six ISC members are all af
filiated with their national chapters, something
of which the University doesn't wholly approve.
Diana Conklin, director of the Row, cites na
tional control as the basis of the University's re
fusal to recognize four of the six. Delta Gamma
and Sigma Delta Tau, as recognized groups,
have the right to meet on campus if they desire.
Unrecognized groups must meet off campus in
apartments or alumni homes, an inconvenience
which members are painfully aware of— espe
cially during rush, when time, safety and trans
portation are important considerations.
The reasons why Stanford women have joined
sororities vary, but most members agree with
Theta pledge Jeanette Howard that "it's a good
way to meet other women." Sanders said a rea
son she rushed was that she missed the
camaraderie of her all-female high school. Social
contact seems to be a major factor in the to-rush
or-not-to-rush decision; many members said
that they were anxious to meet people outside of
their dorm or their major.
Last spring's rush open house was held in a
Palo Alto junior high school, where rushing
females were directed from room to room every
30 minutes. "It can be ego-deflating when you go
through rush because they judge you on 20
minutes of knowing you," Howard said. "I
didn't enjoy the experience much."
Korte, too, was turned off by the prospect of
spring formal rush. "It seemed really impersonal
that you would meet someone and talk for 10
minutes and judge their personality." She in
stead went through open rush, which she con
siders "more relaxed." Open rush is carried on
year-round by groups which didn't meet the
quota set during formal rush.
None of the active members seemed to enjoy
formal rush either. Schendel said, "It's hard for
a girl to tell what we're like during formal rush."
Nevertheless, the goal is "to let all the sororities
see all the girls and all the girls see all the
sororities."
While groups use slide shows and friendly
smiles to entice prospective members to their
turf, the rushing women are worrying about
their charm and appearance. "Everyone tries to
have the best party," Sanders explained. "That's
the nature of rush, I guess."
Allen noted that while jeans and t-shirts are
disallowed, nice dress is "part of selling your
self."
According to Schendel, the selection of
pledges if basically intuitive. "It's hard to say
what we look for," she said thoughtfully. "It's a
shame we have to pick."
"I don't think there was as much competition
between the people in the sororities as there was


Tcrri Bovle/Daily
between those who were trying to get in," How
ard said of last year's rush. She noted that some
sorority hopefuls were disappointed that they
didn't receive a bid from the sorority of their
choice, although Schendel called the six groups
"all basically the same."
While traditions such as group ceremonies,
colors and emblems differ from group to group,
the primary distinguishing factor between Stan
ford's female Greeks seems to be the individuals
within the group at the given time. Every group
has a specific charity for which they raise money
throughout the year.
Alpha PhiA, sqlj balloons and lollipops to
raise money for the heart fund, while Allen said
that some of the Kappa dues — around $90 per
quarter for actives — goes toward their charity,
the Association for the Blind.
So why do Stanford sororities keep such a low
profile? Members agree that it's because the
groups don't have on-campus housing and em
phasize the fact that a major attraction of the
Greek system is that it isn't large and pre-domi
nant. Korte said quietly, "I'm glad they don't
push it on you here."
Sanders compared it to Greek systems at USC
and Berkeley: "It's not the central part of Stan
ford existence to be in the Greek system." She

added that she wouldn't want it that way. "Hav
ing to spend that much time so you're always
trying to impress people superficially is not very
appealing to me," she said.
Schendel, constantly worried about the
groups' public image, pointed out a unique
aspect of the Stanford system. During formal
rush, a rushee is guaranteed a spot in one of the
six ISC groups if she is willing to be accepted into
any one of them. Allen said that although she as
a prospective member put down all six on her
preference card, that's "not common."
"People get the impression that we're ex
clusive little clubs," Schendel noted. "It just isn't
true." In answer to a common accusation, she
defended, "discrimination is not a practice in
which we engage," adding that "there may be
nothing we can do" about stereotyping.
Fully aware of the common labels, sorority
members are anxious to improve their image. Al
len, concerned with the groups' images, is eager
to "make people realize we're not a bunch of
stuffy girls who sit around and drink tea." Allen
is frustrated that "a lot of people come here with
preconceived notions of what a sorority is."
Sanders admitted that she didn't want any
part of the sorority system during the first part of
her freshman year, because of stories she'd heard
from USC sororities, but she went through rush
just to see what it was like. "I'm glad I went
through so I could evaluate it for myself," How
ard said.
