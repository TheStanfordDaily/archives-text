# Internships can be a way to earn and learn

Excellent opportunities exist at
Stanford for students who are in
terested in participating in in
ternship programs. Whether one
is a geology, economics or elec
trical engineering major, the
Stanford Internship Program
(SIP) has an appropriate in
ternship. The SIP catalogues
over 500 internships for which
both undergraduate and gradu
ate students may apply.
According to Patti Yukawa,
assistant to the director of the
SIP, the most popular types of in
ternships are those dealing with
government service. The SIP also
has internships available in busi
ness, communications, educa
tion, environment, health, fine
arts, social sciences and technical
areas.
Yukawa stated that there are
"'three major reasons why stu
dents take internships: to have
practical experience, to reinforce
career objectives and to identify
skills."
In order to obtain an in
ternship, a student must submit
an application to a prospective
employer. These applications
generally consist of a resume,
a transcript and a cover letter.
The SIP functions not only to
help students locate internships,
but also to aid them in putting to
gether their resume and cover let
ters.
Internships are available all
over the country for varying
lengths of time, and there are
even internships in foreign coun
tries. To be eligible for an in
ternship in a foreign country a
student must be a member of the
International Association of Stu
dents in Economics and Business
Management, or AIESEC (its in
itials in French).
According to Russ Ferrill,
president of the AIESEC chapter
here, his organization has in
ternships available in over 59
countries around the world. Al
though it is desireable for the stu
dent to be able to speak a foreign
language, many of these in
ternships do not require language
fluency.
Derrick Strahorn, a senior ma
joring in economics and interna
tional relations, was a sales intern
with Proctor and Gamble last
summer. Strahorn worked in a
sales division that tried to per
suade retail stores to buy P A G
products. Strahorn feels that he
gained practical experience from
his internship. He also com
mented that it had a sobering ef
fect on him because he became
aware that there are "some things
you just can't learn in school."
In Strahorn's case, his in
ternship has the potential of get
ting him a job with Proctor and
Gamble. Many other companies
also use internships as trials to
see whether a student will work
out as an employee. Strahorn
feels that even if he doesn't take a
job with Proctor and Gamble, he

will have benefited from his time
there. He said that he believes in
ternships are "good for resumes
and help to gain practical knowl
edge."
Pete Ramirez is another stu
dent who has participated in an
internship program. Ramirez, a
human biology major, spent six
months as an intern at the Wilson
Center, an adolescent psy
chology hospital in Faribault,
Minnesota. Ramirez lived in a
unit with patients who ranged in
age from 14 to 21. As part of his
job he acted as a role model for
these adolescents. His other job
duties included taking patients to
activities, driving them to doc
tors' appointments, and being on
duty, when he was responsible
for any problems which arose in
the unit.
Some of the incidents with
which he had to deal with were
fights between patients, at
tempted suicides and patients
running away. However, his only
compensation for this job was
room and board during his six
month stay there. Ramirez com
mented that one of the biggest
things he gained from this "great
experience" was that he "learned
to handle Stress." Ramirez, like
Strahorn, also stated that he
"learned things he could not
learn in school."
Internship programs are not
only for the benefit of students.
Nick Sim of the Atlantic Rich
field Company (A RCO) said that
companies see internships "as an
investment in the long-term well
being of the company." He em
phasized that internships are not
provided just for good public re
lations, but that companies pro
vide internships in their own self
interest. In fact, Sim commented
that in ARCO's case, "having an
internship in no way guarantees
the student that he will have a job
with A RCO when he graduates."
However, some companies
and agencies, such as the IRS, do
provide internships with the ex
pressed intention of recruiting
future employees. Rochelle Ol
ive, college recruiter for the IRS,
actively recruits students for in
ternships. The goal of the IRS is
to find students, primarily jun
iors or first-quarter seniors, who
are interested in working for
them, and then to use the in
ternships as a training period.
Rochelle said that the interns
are paid about $5.65 an hour,
which translates into approx
imately 512,000 per year. If they
do a good job during their in
ternship, "they are almost guar
anteed a position with the IRS."
When the interns do start as full
time employees they can earn as
much as 516,000 a year,
Rochelle commented that in a
time when jobs are hard to come
buy, internships are a great way
for college students to get ex
perience that will improve their
chances in the job market.
