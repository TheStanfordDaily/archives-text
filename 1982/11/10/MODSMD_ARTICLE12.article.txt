# Mock interviewing improves techniques
## 
### PAUL AINSLIE 
One of the most important
functions of the Career Planning
and Placement Center (CPPC)
here is to help students prepare
for interviews with prospective
employers. The CPPC, which
permits all students to use this
service, accomplishes this
through its counseling services,
weekly career workshops and
programs, placement files and
mock interviews.
In its involvement with stu
dents, the CPPC works to instill
self-confidence as well as to es
tablish one's goals and values
through self-assessment, accord
ing to Debbie Duncan, assistant
to the director of the CPPC. In
terviewing skills are then de
veloped after the student has ac
quired some direction in his job
hunting.
Opportunities to interview
with various firms are then bid
upon, utilizing the bidding sys
tem initiated last year by Malin
da Kaewert, then the supervisor
of employment. However, many
students find it useful to partake
in the CPPC's mock-interview
progTam before actually in
terviewing for a job.
This opportunity is open to
any student who has attended a
self-assessment workshop at the
CPPC or in residences. The stu
dent is interviewed by CPPC staff
members while being videotaped.
The tape is then played back as
the student watches and the staff
members interject comments and
make constructive criticisms.
This is a very effective means of
building up a student's self-con
fidence while refining his in
terviewing skills, because, as a
student develops his interview
skills he becomes more confident
of these skills.
There are about 400 com
panies which conduct on-campus
interviews. However, Duncan
said that there are many more in
terviewing opportunities off
campus. A student shouldn't be
afraid to check into outside op
portunities, he said, because the
CPPC offers current information
on these firms as well. Duncan
also stressed that you can "major
in anything you want, and still
get a job."
The liberal arts field has ex
perienced a progressive increase
in hiring in recent years. This is in
part due to the high cost of hiring
students with a masters degree in
business administration.
What strategies are available
to the student faced with a repre
sentative of a major corporation?
Other than utilizing common
sense and answering questions
explicitly and with examples, one
can also ask questions. A CPPC
handout provided these ex
amples: "What part of your work
do you consider dull or repeti
tious?" "What percentage of
your time do you have to devote
to this (boring work)?"

Although this manuever tends
to shift the interviewing focus
onto the representative, he can
respond by asking the student
stress questions. Typical stress
questions include: "Give us an
example of your management
style" and "Why should we hire
you?" Stress interviews are rarely
given, but an interviewer is likely
to ask at least one such question
so as to better evaluate how the
student will respond under
stressful conditions.
