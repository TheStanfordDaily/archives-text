# 35,000 reside in Bay Area
## Alumni are an important source of career help 
### KAREN SPRINGEN 
Alumni contacts, often cited as
the name-of-the-game in landing
a job, literally surround students
here â€” the University has more
than 110,000 living alums (35,000
in the Bay Area alone).
These alumni represent a
strong potential resource for
both informational and job
search purposes. In an effort to
facilitate student-alumni interac
tion and to match students with
interested alumni, the Alumni
Association has implemented
three informational programs:
the Alumni Contact Service,
Day-on-the-Job and Experience
bv-Degrees.
The Alumni Contact Service,
which began with a mass mailing
in 1979, operates out of Bowman

Alumni House. It records in
formation on alumni who re
sponded to these mailings. Alum
ni responses are then filed ac
cording to career and geographi
cal area.
The contact service now covers
11 geographical areas: the Bay
Area, Los Angeles, San Diego,
Chicago, Texas, Colorado, Ore
gon, Washington state, Washing
ton, D.C., New York and Bos
ton. Listings in each location
range from consulting and sales
to architecture, banking, engi
neering and communications.
Margot Nelson, director of
classes and services at the Alumni
Assocation, said that alumni vol
unteer to give informational in
terviews rather than job in
terviews. But informational in

terview contacts often help in lat
er job searches, she added, be
cause alumni may refer students
to firms which have job openings.
Students tend to identify more
easily with alums than with the
average recruiter. "It's someone
who has the same background,"
Nelson said.
In addition, students may per
ceive alumni as less frightening
than other contacts. Because of
the informal nature of informa
tional interviews with alumni,
students can comfortably ask,
"What is it like to be X?" Nelson
explained.
To arrange an informational
meeting students may write to
alumni in their home town before
vacation and then follow up on
the contact while on break.

The Alumni Contact Service
information forms, updated ev
ery two years, are sent to each
alumni in a selected geographical
area. Questionnaires ask alumni
for their name, address and
phone number, position, name of
their corporation, a job descrip
tion and if they might offer sum
mer employment.
Nelson estimated that three to
five students per day use the
Alumni Contact Service Hies.
Many students think they want
to be lawyers, accountants or
sales representatives but do not
fully understand what these jobs
entail.
The Day-on-the-Job program,
which began last year, allows stu
dents to experience a specific
vocation firsthand by spending a

day at work with an alumnus.
Senior Doug Nomiyama, stu
dent intern for Day-on-the-Job,
said, "It's up to the students
themselves to contact the alum.
The only limit is that some of the
professionals out there can only
take one or two students a
month."
Students who wish to use the
Day-on-the-Job booklet, which
now lists about 200 interested
Bay Area alumni, should go to
Bowman Alumni House.
Experience-by-Degrees, which
began in the spring of 1981, pro
motes alumni-student interac
tion by producing four to six sem
inars which feature graduates
who majored in different fields.
Senior Kevin Rosenstein, a
student intern for Experience-by-
Degrees, said the first seminar
will be held in history on Jan. 13.
Other evening seminars will fea
ture economics, human biology,
political science and American
Studies graduates.
About 40 alumni participated
in Experience-by-Degrees last
year, said Rosenstein.
Programs are extremely ac
cessible. "You just show up,"
Rosenstein said. And they are
not limited to seniors.
