# Graduate schools here place 90 percent in jobs
## 
### FELICIA LEE 
The graduate schools of law,
business, computer science and
medicine here have all reported
that over 90 percent of their grad
uates were employed within a
year of finishing school. The
Medical School had the best
placement percentage, placing 99
percent of its graduates in hospi
tal internship programs.
The success of graduate stu
dents here in finding careers in
their chosen fields can be at
tributed to both the faculty and
the caliber of students of these
schools. For instance, the com

puter science department recent
ly had 320 applications for 20
spaces in its Ph.D. program. The
few who do make it into this pro
gram, however, have little or no
trouble finding jobs.
With job offers from elite firms
also come fairly high salaries.
The salaries for Law School
graduates who are working in le
gal firms range from $12,000 to
$48,000, while computer science
Ph.D.s can expect to earn about
$32,000 a year.
The types of firms with which
graduates of these schools find

work vary among the different
schools. Within the individual
schools, however, there are no
ticeable trends in the types of jobs
and locations favored by gradu
ates. Law graduates, according
to the Law School's 1981 em
ployment report, tend to start
their careers with large, private
law firms, while Business School
graduates are more evenly
divided among different-sized
companies.
The geographic location of the
firms at which graduates work
also varies among the different
schools. While Law and Business

School graduates tend to take
jobs in California and the North
east, students with computer sci
ence degrees generally stay in the
Silicon Valley area, where their
skills are more in demand.
The reasons students are
drawn to the graduate schools
here are as varied as the students
themselves. Although one gradu
ate student admitted that the
draw of money and prestige is
often a factor, she emphasized
that a student's reasons for
choosing Stanford are often per
sonal and "very different for ev
erybody."
