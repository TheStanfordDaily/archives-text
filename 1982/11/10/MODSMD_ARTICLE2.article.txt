# The 						Careers supplement: What's in it for you?
## 
### 
This issue, a special supple
ment to The Stanford Daily, is an
attempt to bring to students here
a look at a very valuable part of
their years at Stanford: the search
for a job.
The Career Planning and
Placement Center provides the
bulk of services aimed at prepar
ing students for their years after
graduation. The center helps stu
dents prepare for job interviews
bv taping practice interviews and
then reviewing them with the stu
dent; it provides information and
workshops on internships and

careers; and it informs students
here of companies that will be re
cruiting on campus.
Seniors who are planning to
enter the job market after gradu
ation have several problems fac
ing them. They must write their
resume, which is a letter detailing
their past accomplishments and
future ambitions.
They must also arrange for
professors who know them to
write recommendations for
them, so that future employers
may be able to obtain a better
idea of their abilities from anoth

er source.
Finally, they must, of course,
apply for jobs. For those who
majored in engineering and most
other scientific fields, this search
will probably be somewhat less
hectic than that for liberal arts
majors, because of the high de
mand in the job market for those
who have taken a science degree.
However, even liberal arts ma
jors may see more opportunities
open for them, as companies
look to them instead of to higher
paid MBAs for various begin
ning management positions.

Of course, business school
graduates, as well as those who
have graduated from the other
professional schools here, have
an excellent chance of landing a
job in the first several months af
ter graduation. Salaries for these
graduates range from $12,000 to
$48,000 for their first job.
The CPPC advises that jun
iors, sophomores and even
freshmen can and should begin
their career search early. They
can do so by applying for in
ternships and using the Alumni
Contact Service, a service of the
Alumni Association.
These two services can be very
valuable to an undergraduate
who is willing to utilize them. The
former can provide a student
with valuable work service for a
varying length of time, while the
latter allows students to follow a
Stanford alumnus through a reg
ular day on his job, as well as
helps students make contact with
Stanford alumni in fields they
may wish to enter.
Graduate students can also re
ceive help from the CPPC. Be
cause Stanford's graduate
schools are ranked among the
highest in the nation, students
there usually have no trouble fin
ding a job. In fact, the Medical
School placed 99 percent of its
graduates in internship pro
grams.
