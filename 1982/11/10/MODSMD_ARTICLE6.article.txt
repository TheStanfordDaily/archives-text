# CPPC helps students plan for that first job
## 
### MARY LUCIA BUN 
Separating career planning
from career placement creates a
false dichotomy, according to
Chris Shinkman, the director of
the Career Planning and Place
ment Center (CPPC) here. Ca
reer placement, he explained, is a
developmental process which in
cludes career planning. He said
that it is best begun as soon as
possible, even as early as the
freshman or sophomore years.
However, Shinkman said he
considered counseling the foun
dation of CPPC services and de
scribed the several steps in the
CPPC's counseling process as
follows:
• First, students are counseled
to help them obtain a better un
derstanding of their skills and
values.
• Second, students are given
more information about options
available in the work world.
• Third, job-seekers are en
couraged to test some of their
tentative choices through sum
mer or part-time jobs or in
ternships, or by preparing them
selves through relevant
coursework. In fact, Shinkman
said he believed that coursework
can give students both practical
skills, such as accounting and
computer programming, and the
opportunity to see whether they
like the type of work involved in
their chosen field.
•Finally, students are coun
seled on the specifics of searching
for a job, such as resume-writing
skills, interviewing strategy, job
search techniques and job list
ings.
The CPPC offers services for
most students at every level of
university study. Programs at the
Student Employment Office
(SEO), which is a part of the
CPPC, are aimed at helping un
dergraduates plan for possible
career choices. Besides listing op
portunities for internships or
part-time work, the SEO offers
one-to-one counseling on career
planning.
For graduate students, CPPC
services range from arranging in
terviews with on-campus re
cruiters to counseling to holding
workshops on interviewing tech
niques for careers both in and out
of academia.
Although on-campus recruit
ing is the most visible CPPC ser
vice, the center's staff does not
consider this their most valuable
program. They see the Alumni
Contact Service (ACS), a service
of the Alumni Association, as a
very valuable resource. As
Shinkman noted, the ACS is a
valuable career-exploration re
source in that it allows students
to get information directly from
the source. "Visiting an alumnus
at his place of work is a chance to
visualize the work setting; 'Can I
see myself working here? Is it
what I imagined it to be?' "
However, the Alumni Contact
Service can be more than just a

method of exploring different ca
reers. Kathy Campbell, the assis
tant to the director for liberal arts
at the CPPC, stresses the service's
potential for establishing early
contacts in a student's field of in
terest. "If you can tap in to some
one in the right network, you'll
make it more likely that you
know the right person at the right
time," she said.
Furthermore, because the
companies that recruit at the
University do not represent the
whole range of possible career
fields, such as those in smaller
companies, community service
organizations, the arts, advertis
ing and the media, students in
terested in these fields often turn
away from the CPPC, once they
see which companies do and do
not recruit here. Campbell feels
that this attitude is unfortunate,
because these students in particu
lar could benefit most from
CPPC services, especially the
Alumni Contact Service. No
matter how good a student's cov
er-letter and resume, papers sent
from an unknown candidate do
not compare to credentials of
someone an employer has met or
worked with through a summer
internship.
Of course, contacts alone will
not get you a job. As Campbell
stresses, "The candidate has to
have what it takes: A contact may
just get your foot in the door."
Everyone on the CPPC staff
agrees that students cannot come
in early enough. Doing some
thinking ahead of time would
prevent having to do all career
planning during the senior year,
which for most students is a hec
tic year academically as well.
Furthermore, Campbell suggests
that job-hunting workshops
throughout the senior year would
be more valuable with previous
exploration of the various SEO
services or the Alumni Contact
Service.
The senior year, however, is by
no means too late for planning,
especially if students can devote
autumn quarter to researching
their field. Although most stu
dents do not use all the CPPC ser
vices until their senior year, SEO
Director Hector Cuevas feels op
timistic about the extent to which
some students make use of SEO
internships and part-time jobs
available throughout their un
dergraduate years. Cuevas esti
mates that students from both
liberal arts and technical fields
have one or two pre-professional
internships prior to entering the
full-time job market.
This year, an estimated 50 per
cent of alumni returning to use
the CPPC's resources were less
than two years out of school; the
other half were either laid-off or
were making career transitions.
Gloria Johnston, the CPPC's sec
retary for the liberal arts, feels
that one major reason for dis
illusionment with a student's first
