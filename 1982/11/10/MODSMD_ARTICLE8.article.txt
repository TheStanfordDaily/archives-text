# Resumes help sell job-seekers

### JEFFREY WEISS 
The resume can be thought of
as an advertisement for oneself.
It is the first attempt to interest a
prospective employer in one's
talents, accomplishments and
potential.
A one-page resume is ideal for
a recent college graduate with
limited work experience. There
are two resume formats which
are used by and acceptable to em

plovers. The traditional chrono
logical resume is preferable for
most students. The functional re
sume should be used only by the
student applying for a job in a
Field in which he has had no work
experience.
Chronological resumes begin
with basic identification in
formation such as name, address
(both present and permanent)
and phone number.

The next section contains a
statement of the job objective,
which must be as specific as pos
sible in identifying the type of
position sought.
In the education section, stu
dents should include all institu
tions attended since high school,
dates of attendance, degrees held
and major areas of study. These
items, as well as the work ex
perience information which fol
lows, should be listed in reverse
chronological order.
The work experience section
should include dates, employers,
responsibilities, titles and ac
complishments.
Any other relevant factors re
flecting your positive attributes
as a job applicant should be in
cluded. This could be member
ship in university committees or
honorary societies, publications,
travels, extracurricular activities
and hobbies.
A cover letter should accom
pany every resume sent out to a
potential employer. This letter
should say how you found out
about the job, why you are in
terested in the job and what spe
cific qualifications you have for
the job.
Writing a job objective is often
difficult for the student who has
many different interests. One op
tion is to have a general objective
in the resume and a specific ex
planation of your interest in each
particular cover letter sent out
with each resume. Another possi
blity is to have two or three re
sumes each stating a different job
objective. The most thorough
solution is to have a different ob
jective sent with each inquiry.
Renee Filice, director of liberal
arts at the CPPC, does not think
it is necessary to have the resume
typeset, but she does recom
mends having the resume copied
on a good quality heavy paper or
typing the resume with a type
writer which has elite type.
