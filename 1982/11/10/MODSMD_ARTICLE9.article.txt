# Recommendations present insights for employers

### TIM WHALEN 
One of the most important
way-stations in the CPPC's un
derground railroad to life after
Stanford is the desk of Karyl
Thorn, supervisor of candidate
records. All the personal and aca
demic information of seniors and
graduate students applying to
medical schools, law schools,
business schools and various oth
er institutions, as well as those in
terviewing for jobs, is collected
and processed in the Candidate
Records Department.
Presently, about 15,000 manil
la folders are filed away in the
storerooms below the CPPC.
(Thorn proudly claims never to
have lost a file in her two years as
supervisor.)
While resumes, transcripts and
such can sometimes provide an
accurate picture of a candidate's
qualifications, often the only in
dication of the character of appli
cants is contained in their letters
of recommendation.
These letters, as anyone who
has applied to the University will
remember, are written by the
professors and faculty best ac
quainted with the applicant and
with an agreement of confiden
tiality for the writer. This con
fidentiality is used in the belief
that the writer can be more open
in giving his views about a stu
dent's abilities if he knows that
the applicant cannot read them.
Thus, the recommendation is
considered a more accurate pro
file of the applicant.
The drawback, according to
Thorn, it that the students do not
know if a letter of recommenda
tion will be beneficial or
detrimental to their application;
although she has read all 60,000

letters on file. Thorn cannot even
tell a student if a particular letter
is positive or negative.
This secrecy may drive some
applicants into fits of paranoia,
but apparently most are confi
dent in the discretion of their
chosen character judges. Mike
Weiss, a senior majoring in eco
nomics, had three recommenda
tions written for his applications
to law school. For these letters he
asked two communications pro
fessors and Rob Robinson, a
German Studies professor and
resident fellow in Lagunita, who
had asked Weiss to be a resident
advisor this year. All three had
known Weiss for some time. Ac
cording to Weiss, he "couldn't
care less if he never reads the let
ters."
Professor Richard Thompson,
chairman of the Human Biology
Program and one of the most
prolific recommendations writ
ers on campus, states that con
fidentiality neither helps nor hin
ders the composition of his let
ters. His only aim is to deliver the
best possible recommendation
for the student.
What is important, said
Thompson, is a knowledge of the
subject of the letter as more than
just a face in a lecture-hall. When
given a request for a recommen
dation from a student they do not
feel comfortably familiar with,
many professors feel obliged to
decline. Others conduct in
terviews to gain an impression of
the extra-curricular side of the
student. Norman Wessels, dean
of Humanities and Sciences, con
ducted more than 60 half-hour
interviews last spring before writ
ing his recommendations.
