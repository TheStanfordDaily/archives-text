# BREZHNEV DEAD

Moscow — Leonid Brezhnev, head of the Com
munist Party and president of the Soviet Union, has
died, the Tass news agency reported today
The official agency said the 75-year-old leader
died a "sudden death" at 8:30 a.m. yesterday (9:30
p.m. Tuesday PST). It said the announcement was
made by the Central Committee of the party.
Brezhnev had led the Soviet Union for 18 years,
taking over from the ousted Nikita Khrushchev in
October, 1954.
There was no immediate announcement of a suc
cessor. Politburo officials Yuri Andropov and
Konstantin Chernenko are widely regarded as the
chief contenders for the post.
Here at Stanford, Soviet expert Alexander Dallin,
a professor of history, would offer no guess as to
who Brezhnev's successor would be, but said he ex
pected the Soviets to maintain continuity in leader
ship.
Brezhnev was last seen in public Sunday presiding
over the massive Red Square parade marking the
65th anniversary of the Bolshevik Revolution.
"The name of Leonid Ilyich Brezhnev, a true con

tinuer of Lenin's great cause and an ardent cham
pion of peace and Communism, will live forever in
the hearts of the Soviet people and the entire
progressive mankind," Tass said.
Brezhnev kept a firm grip on power by insisting
that colleagues join in decision-making and share
the blame for ideas that went wrong.
He was the most conservative of the Kremlin
leaders who preceded him, author of the so-called
"Brezhnev doctrine" — a tough policy of brooking
no opposition from dissidents as evidenced in the in
vasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968 and the Soviet
support of the Polish martial law regime.
After the fiery Lenin, ruthless Stalin and visionary
Khrushchev, he often looked to be a faceless bu
reaucrat, stiffly reading his speeches and laboriously
consulting colleagues on major decisions.
But he also did more than any of his predecessors
to consolidate the Soviet Union as a major world
power and bring it to nuclear parity with the United
States.
He chose modest, controlled economic growth for
the country instead of Nikita Khrushchev's wildly
ambitious schemes; preferred coexistence and de

tente to V.I. Lenin's revolutionary fervor; and re
placed Josef Stalin's aggressive expansionism with a
careful probing for international gains.
Brezhnev was said to have considered his major
accomplishments the signing with President Jimmy
Carter in June, 1979, of the SALT II strategic arms
agreement; the adoption of a new "Brezhnev" con
stitution for the Soviet Union in 1977, and his moves
toward international detente.
However, detente suffered a sharp setback in late
1979 when the Kremlin dispatched the first of some
85,000 troops to neighboring Afghanistan in an ef
fort to quell Moslem resistance to that country's
Marxist regime.
Following the intervention, the U.S. Senate re
fused even to consider the SALT II treaty, and
Ronald Reagan, who defeated Carter in the 1980
presidential election, said it had to be renogiatated.
Clearly ill at ease in formal speeches and ceremo
nies, the 200-pound Brezhnev could be warm and
confident with small groups ranging from factory
workers to foreign statesmen.
