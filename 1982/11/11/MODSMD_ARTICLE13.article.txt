# Greek system's relations with University
## 
### KATHY REHM Last in a series 
The relationship between
fraternities and sororities here
and their national organizations
is a matter of some concern to
Residential Education. Accord
ing to Diana Conklin, director of
the Row and assistant dean of
student affairs, "The University
is not going to recognize a group
that is controlled from outside
the University. We believe stu
dents are capable of managing
their own affairs."

But the topic of national vs.
University control of the
sororities and fraternities here is
not as touchy as one might first
imagine. Put simply, policies per
taining to the groups state that a
chapter must have "comparable
freedom from extra-University
control" in order to be recog
nized.
Currently, 13 fraternities and
two sororities are recognized by
the University. Conklin ex
plained that the reason that most
of the fraternities have been rec
ognized while only a small por
tion of the sororities have is that
the fraternities' nationals are
much less controlling than the
sororities'.
University policy requires that
the purposes and procedures of
recognized voluntary student
groups such as sororities and
fraternities must be "not in
consistent with the goals and
standards of the University."
Conklin said that this is where
the conflicts usually occur, be
cause some national sorority
constitutions include rules re
garding an individual's activities
within the group based on her
standing in the sorority and in the
University.
According to Suzanne
Schendel, president of the In
tersororitv Council (ISC), na
tional sororities have the power
to impose penalities or expel

members from sororities. Al
though Schendel said problems
are rare, she said that it is some
times easier to have them dealt
with on a national level. Such na
tional control is contradictory to
what Conklin called the Univer
sity's "non-parentai treatment"
of students.
Despite these conflicts,
Schendel said there are "not a lot
of hard feelings (between) the
girls and the University" on the
issue of recognition. Several
sororities are working closely
with Conklin in order to achieve
a balance between their national
organizations and the Univer
sity.
Most of Stanford's fraternities
found the magic intermediary be
tween their nationals and the
University long ago. Beta Theta
Pi President Mike Melendezsaid
that most chapters rely mostly
upon their local alumni and deal
with the nationalsonlvenough to
stay in good standing with them.
The exception is Kappa Sigma,
whose chapter here was deaf
filiated from its national or
ganization last spring.
Because the Greek system at
Stanford was originally entirely
residentially oriented, the Uni
versity classifies both sororities
and fraternities as "residentially
related selective groups." The
policies regarding these pertain
only to single sex groups, how
ever, and they state "subjective
selection of members will not be
extended to co-educational
groups."
Res Ed also attempts to eliminate
early recruitment of potential
sorority and fraternity rushees.
"Freshmen should be allowed to
have their freshman experience
(for) at least the first quarter
without outside pressure," said
Conklin. She noted that this rule
applied not only to sororities and
fraternities but also to co-ops and
theme houses on campus.
Two autonomous groups fully
approved of and recognized by
the University are the ISC and its
counterpart, the Interfraternity
Council (IFC), which consist of
one or two representatives from
each member group. IFC Presi
dent Andv Beal said that his
group's goals are primarily

directed at improving the
fraternities' image. Besides com
munitv service and campus ac-1
tivities such as the Mega-!
Nooner, Aqua hollies and rush.i
this year's IFC is addressing the!
accusation of racial discrimina-1
tion. \
According to Beal, the IFC is'
planning a detailed study of the,
relationships of religious, cul-'
tural and racial diversity between
dorm students, rushees and
fraternity members. Me said that
if the diversity ratios of fraternity
houses are not consistent with
those of dorms, it is because stu
dents are discriminating them
selves in the rush turnout. "There
is no house that discriminates,"
he said, and Conklin agreeed that
she has "not found prejudice in
any constitution or in any prac
tice."
The I f-'C's development of a ju
dicial committee is also an at
tempt to show the University that
fraternities can deal with prob
lems among themselves. "Ev
eryone here is adult enough to
make their own decision," Beal
said, and added that the Univer
sity is supportive of the commit
tee idea.
Like the IFC, the ISC exists
primarily to run and regulate
rush, unite its member groups,
and promote their image.
Schendel called the anonymity of
Stanford's sororities sad and said
that a major function of the ISC
is to "get people to know what
we're about."
Last year's main effort of the
ISC was the co-sponsorship of
Women's Day, a conglomeration
of booths, speakers and enter
tainment designed to educate the
public about opportunities for
women at Stanford.
Since both the ISC and the IFC
are recognized bv the University,
they have the right to meet on
campus. Conklin spoke positive
ly about both the Greek system
and the individuals within the
system, and is working diligently
with the groups that wish to be
come recognized. "The basis of
our insistence on local autonomy
isan abiding faith in theabilityof
students to run their own af
fairs," she said. "We have not
been proven wrong in the history
of this University."

residentially oriented, the Uni
versity classifies both sororities
and fraternities as "residentially
related selective groups." The
policies regarding these pertain
only to single sex groups, how
ever, and they state "subjective
selection of members will not be
extended to co-educational
groups."
Res Ed also attempts to eliminate
early recruitment of potential
sorority and fraternity rushees.
"Freshmen should be allowed to
have their freshman experience
(for) at least the first quarter
without outside pressure," said
Conklin. She noted that this rule
applied not only to sororities and
fraternities but also to co-ops and
theme houses on campus.
Two autonomous groups fully
approved of and recognized by
the University are the ISC and its
counterpart, the Interfraternity
Council (IFC), which consist of
one or two representatives from
each member group. IFC Presi

group's goals are primarily

directed at improving the
fraternities' image. Besides com
munitv service and campus ac-1
tivities such as the Mega-!
Nooner, Aqua hollies and rush.i
this year's IFC is addressing the!
accusation of racial discrimina-1
tion. \
According to Beal, the IFC is'
planning a detailed study of the,
relationships of religious, cul-'
tural and racial diversity between
dorm students, rushees and
fraternity members. Me said that
if the diversity ratios of fraternity
houses are not consistent with
those of dorms, it is because stu
dents are discriminating them
selves in the rush turnout. "There
is no house that discriminates,"
he said, and Conklin agreeed that
she has "not found prejudice in
any constitution or in any prac
tice."
The I f-'C's development of a ju
dicial committee is also an at
tempt to show the University that
fraternities can deal with prob
lems among themselves. "Ev
eryone here is adult enough to
make their own decision," Beal
said, and added that the Univer
sity is supportive of the commit
tee idea.
Like the IFC, the ISC exists
primarily to run and regulate
rush, unite its member groups,
and promote their image.
Schendel called the anonymity of
Stanford's sororities sad and said
that a major function of the ISC
is to "get people to know what
we're about."
Last year's main effort of the
ISC was the co-sponsorship of
Women's Day, a conglomeration
of booths, speakers and enter
tainment designed to educate the
public about opportunities for
women at Stanford.
Since both the ISC and the IFC
are recognized bv the University,
they have the right to meet on
campus. Conklin spoke positive
ly about both the Greek system
and the individuals within the
system, and is working diligently
with the groups that wish to be
come recognized. "The basis of
our insistence on local autonomy
isan abiding faith in theabilityof
students to run their own af
fairs," she said. "We have not
been proven wrong in the history
of this University."

The relationship between
fraternities and sororities here
and their national organizations
is a matter of some concern to
Residential Education. Accord
ing to Diana Conklin, director of
the Row and assistant dean of
student affairs, "The University
is not going to recognize a group
that is controlled from outside
the University. We believe stu
dents are capable of managing
their own affairs."

But the topic of national vs.
University control of the
sororities and fraternities here is
not as touchy as one might first
imagine. Put simply, policies per
taining to the groups state that a
chapter must have "comparable
freedom from extra-University
control" in order to be recog
nized.
Currently, 13 fraternities and
two sororities are recognized by
the University. Conklin ex
plained that the reason that most
of the fraternities have been rec
ognized while only a small por
tion of the sororities have is that
the fraternities' nationals are
much less controlling than the
sororities'.
University policy requires that
the purposes and procedures of
recognized voluntary student
groups such as sororities and
fraternities must be "not in
consistent with the goals and
standards of the University."
Conklin said that this is where
the conflicts usually occur, be
cause some national sorority
constitutions include rules re
garding an individual's activities
within the group based on her
standing in the sorority and in the
University.
According to Suzanne
Schendel, president of the In
tersororitv Council (ISC), na
tional sororities have the power
to impose penalities or expel

members from sororities. Al
though Schendel said problems
are rare, she said that it is some
times easier to have them dealt
with on a national level. Such na
tional control is contradictory to
what Conklin called the Univer
sity's "non-parentai treatment"
of students.
Despite these conflicts,
Schendel said there are "not a lot
of hard feelings (between) the
girls and the University" on the
issue of recognition. Several
sororities are working closely
with Conklin in order to achieve
a balance between their national
organizations and the Univer
sity.
Most of Stanford's fraternities
found the magic intermediary be
tween their nationals and the
University long ago. Beta Theta
Pi President Mike Melendezsaid
that most chapters rely mostly
upon their local alumni and deal
with the nationalsonlvenough to
stay in good standing with them.
The exception is Kappa Sigma,
whose chapter here was deaf
filiated from its national or
ganization last spring.
