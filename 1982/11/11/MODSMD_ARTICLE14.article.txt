## The 						Stanford Daily Flirting with irresponsibility 
### 
Only five years ago, it seemed that the University
was at last willing to take moral responsibility for
its investment decisions. At that time, largely be
cause of widespread student opposition to the Uni
versity's investment procedures, the University
created the Commission on Investment Responsi
bility (CIR). Until last vear, the CIR carefully re
searched every corporate ballot the University re
ceived — about 50 a year — before presenting them
to the board of trustees for a vote. Its careful re
search work helped ensure that the University,
which seeks the maximum return for its money
when it invests, was putting that money to respon
sible use.
Recently, however, the University has shown less
concern for its financial responsibilities. The proc
ess began last year when the the CIR, claiming that
the process of proxy voting had become "too hur
ried and too limited to do justice to the issues in
volved," requested a moratorium on voting last
year. Last week, a report to the board of trustees
prepared by the CIR recommended that future
CI Rs consider voting proxies only on "the most im
portant, serious, or salient" issues where "substan
tial social injury is at stake." Irresponsibility threat
ens to become institutionalized.
The ClR's concern that insufficient time and at
tention were being given to important issues is justi
fied. Many decisions were only superficially in
vestigated before recommendations were made and
it is clear that change was needed. But none of the
recommendations — submitted in the form of a ma
jority statement and two minority statements —
proposed an expansion of the size and scope of the
commission so that sufficient attention could be
given to all issues. This would be the most respon
sible solution.

If there continues to be a problem attracting fac
ulty members and others to serve on the com
mission, a stipend could be offered as an incentive.
Responsible investment of the University's $500
million portfolio would be worth the small price
and would allow the commission to do the job it
ought: carefully examine every issue on every proxy
ballot it considers and then recommend to the
board how the vote should be cast.
The danger in following the commission's recom
mendation, which chairman and Political Science
Prof. Alexander Dallin described as "... not look
at every single thing that comes up," but only to
consider voting proxies on the most salient issues,
should be clear: occasionally, the importance or
significance of an issue may not be readily dis
cernible. In such a case, it is important that a closer
look be taken; one can not err too far on the side of
responsibility.
What worries us even. more than the com
mission's recommendation is that it comes amid
growing apathy about University policy — the"I
don't care" attitide manifested itself in one of the
ClR's minority reports, which stated that the com
mission should not take positions "on the popular
political and social issues of the day." The CI R was
created in large part because of widespread student
protest, which culminated in a mass sit-in of Old
Union, against the University's abstention on a
Ford Motor Co. South African investment vote.
Now members of that very committee seem to be
advocating the same such abstention.
If the board approves the CI R's recommendation
and the number of issues considered and votes cast
was indeed reduced, the University would run the
risk of abdicating its moral responsibility as an in
vestor. Such approval would be a regrettable and ir
responsible mistake.
