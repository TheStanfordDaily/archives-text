## Brazil's budding democracy? 
### 
Few words are as widely used and yet
ambigious as "democracy." Defining
democracy becomes increasingly im
portant as the "project for democracy"
plays a greater role in tne developing
nations faced with economic crises.
Specifically, "re-democratization" for
several countries in South America —
Ecuador, Bolivia, Peru and Brazil —
has been often noted. However, as a
brief sketch of an increasingly "demo
cratic" Brazil illustrates, these coun
tries are not entirely democratic.
Brazil is currently emerging from 18
years of military dictatorship following
the "revolution" of 1964. National elec
tions are scheduled for November 15
when Brazilians will vote for governors,
local deputies, and state and federal
congressmen and senators. However,

several factors work against these be
coming popular elections. First, the
voter must correctly spell the name of
each candidate or write in the cor
responding number. Failure to do so re
sults in nullification of the ballot. In a
country with up to 75 percent illiteracy
in some regions, the complicated voting
procedure naturally prevents the
poorer voter from political partici
pation. Second, the contested positions
have little influence in the formation of
public policy. The president and his
cabinet have overwhelming power in
dictating all federal and state expen
ditures. Third, the Brazilians are faced
with the threat of a right-wing military
coup should the results of the election
be too far-left for the Brazilian military.
Further, debate and discussion have

been greatly restricted during the cam
paign by a law which prohibits radio
and television appearances by can
didates during the final two months of
the campaign.
I am neither using the United States
as a model nor neglecting the positive
aspects of Brazilian "democracy" — a
marked decline in torture and an in
creased political consciousness among
the Brazilian people. I only intend to
demonstrate the very limited bounds in
which one South American "de
mocracy" operates.
