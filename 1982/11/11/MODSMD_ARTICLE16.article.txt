## The 						false premises of PLO settlement plan 
### 
The idea that the conflict in the Mideast will end
when a PLO-led Palestinian Arab state is formed on
the West Bank and Gaza has been getting a lot of
press in recent months. Indeed, it seems to be a satis
fvingly simple solution. It is based on two tacit pre
mises. The first premise is that the Arab nations
trust the PLO to have a state. The second premise is
that the Arab-Israeli tensions are caused by general
Arab concern for the Palestinian Arab refugees. Un
fortunately, these premises are both false.
Consider the events leading to the present situ
ation.
In 1922, 80 percent of the land constituting the
British mandate of Palestine was closed to Jewish
settlement. This Eastern part of Palestine became
Jordan. The remaining 20 percent of the mandate
was again divided between the Palestinian Arabs
and Palestinian Jews by the partition of 1947. The
Jewish state was immediately attacked upon incep
tion by five Arab nations. The Grand Mufti of Jeru
salem, Haj Amin el-Husseini, joined the heads of the
invading nations in urging the Arab inhabitants to
leave before the slaughter of Jews began. About
600,000 Palestinian Arabs took this advice.
These events started the Palestinian Arab refugee
problem. In the words of the Jordonian daily,
(Palestine. Feb. 19, 1949): "The Arab States, which
had encouraged the Palestine Arabs to leave their
homes temporarily in order to be out of the way of
the Arab invasion armies, have failed to keep their
promises to help these refugees." It should be noted
that 160,000 Arabs did not leave. There are current
ly 600,000 Israeli Arabs who have equal voting
rights and have representatives in the Knesset.
Let us now consider the premise that the Arab na
tions trust the PLO to have a state. In 1950 Jordan
formally annexed the West Bank (no misprint here).
It held this land until 1967. Did Jordan give this land
(ostensibly the land the PLO now desires) to the
PLO? No, it did not. It did not make any effort to
establish a second Arab state in Palestine. It did.

however, allow the PLO a base to stage the Jor
danian government. In 1970-71, Jordan waged a bit
ter war against the PLO killing upwards of6ooo peo
ple. The PLO then re-assembled their forces in Leb
anon. The presence of the Palestinian Arab ter
rorists tipped the delicate political balance holding
the Lebanese government together, resulting in a
civil war between the Christians and Arabs in 1975.
When it seemed as if the PLO was going to win, the
Syrians entered the fray and attacked the PLO. By
1976, one out of every 200 Lebanese had died in the
fighting and one out of every six had fled the coun
try. The Arab states have every reason to believe
that, given the PLO's disruptive past, a PLO-run
state would serve as a destsabilizing element in the
region. Jordan knows this better than any other
state, since the PLO has rightly claimed Jordan as
part of Palestine (Article 2, Palestine National Cov
enant, Cairo 1968).
Next we must consider the premise that Arab-Is
raeli tensions are caused by Arab concern for the
Palestinian Arab refugees. The very fact that there
would be no refugees if the Arab nations hadn't at
tacked in 1948 refutes this contention. In this war,
Egypt seized the Gaza Strip. It controlled this land
and its Palestinian Arab inhabitants until 1967. As
was the case with the West Bank, no state was
formed. The Palestinian Arabs were barred from
Egypt and subject to strict curfews. In the words of
Martha Gellhorn writing in the Atlantic Monthly in
October 1961: "The Gaza is not a hell-hole, not a
visible disaster. It is worse. It is a jail."
The Arab nations have insisted on keeping the
Palestinian Arabs in refugee camps where they live
under the care of the United Nations. Is there any
need for this? The combined land holdings of the
Arab league and Egypt are 5,286,000 square miles.
Israel has 7993 square miles. The combined popu
lation of the Arab league and Egypt was 157,250,000
in 1980 compared to 3,800,000 for Israel. This dis
parity doesn't seem to get much attention. The Ar
abs certainly have the space. How about resources?

In the recent war in Lebanon the Israelis captured
over a billion dollars in weapons from the PLO. The
Arab world and the PLO have seen fit to use their
vast resources for military purposes, while forcing
the Palestinian Arabs to live in shabby camps.
One might ask, "What would the Jews do in a sim
ilar situation." The question would be rather,
"What did the Jews do in the similar situation?"
Jews living in Arab countries were (and are) subject
to intense persecution. Consider for example the
case of the Jewish community in Iraq. In 1948, this
community numbered 125,000. Twenty-five years of
pogroms, public hangings and anti-Jewish laws
caused the Jewish community to flee. In 1973 only
400 Jews remained. Between 1948 and 1973 over
700,000 Jews fled savage persecution in Syria, Iraq,
Libya, Lebanon, Yemen, South Yemen, Tunisia,
Morocco, Algeria and Egypt. They were immediate
ly absorbed by the small state of Israel. The Palesti
nian Arabs can similarly be resetteled in any of the
enormous Arab states or at the very least in Jordan.
After all, Jordan is Eastern Palestine. Already, 60 to
70 percent of Jordan's population consists of West
Palestinian Arabs.
Given the intransigent nature of the Arab nations
in the past, the picture painted above may look
bleak â€” but it needn't. Despite everything, the Is
raelis are willing to negotiate. Israelis desperately
want peace. They are willing to take risks for peace,
but the Arabs must first give up their avowed goal of
destroying Israel. Consider Egypt's Anwar Sadat,
the first Arab leader to accept Israel's right to exist.
The Israelis responded by returning the entire Sinai
peninsula along with Israel's only oil fields. The
Arabs called Sadat a traitor and called for his as
sassination (with known results). The PLO con
tinues to assassinate any Palestinian Arab official
who calls for talks with Israel. Israel has offered ne
gotiations with all of its neighbors. The ball is in the
Arab court.

70 percent of Jordan's population consists of West
Palestinian Arabs.
Given the intransigent nature of the Arab nations
in the past, the picture painted above may look
bleak â€” but it needn't. Despite everything, the Is
raelis are willing to negotiate. Israelis desperately
want peace. They are willing to take risks for peace,
but the Arabs must first give up their avowed goal of
destroying Israel. Consider Egypt's Anwar Sadat,
the first Arab leader to accept Israel's right to exist.
The Israelis responded by returning the entire Sinai
peninsula along with Israel's only oil fields. The
Arabs called Sadat a traitor and called for his as
sassination (with known results). The PLO con
tinues to assassinate any Palestinian Arab official
who calls for talks with Israel. Israel has offered ne
gotiations with all of its neighbors. The ball is in the
Arab court.

The idea that the conflict in the Mideast will end
when a PLO-led Palestinian Arab state is formed on
the West Bank and Gaza has been getting a lot of
press in recent months. Indeed, it seems to be a satis
fvingly simple solution. It is based on two tacit pre
mises. The first premise is that the Arab nations
trust the PLO to have a state. The second premise is
that the Arab-Israeli tensions are caused by general
Arab concern for the Palestinian Arab refugees. Un
fortunately, these premises are both false.
Consider the events leading to the present situ
ation.
In 1922, 80 percent of the land constituting the
British mandate of Palestine was closed to Jewish
settlement. This Eastern part of Palestine became
Jordan. The remaining 20 percent of the mandate
was again divided between the Palestinian Arabs
and Palestinian Jews by the partition of 1947. The
Jewish state was immediately attacked upon incep
tion by five Arab nations. The Grand Mufti of Jeru
salem, Haj Amin el-Husseini, joined the heads of the
invading nations in urging the Arab inhabitants to
leave before the slaughter of Jews began. About
600,000 Palestinian Arabs took this advice.
These events started the Palestinian Arab refugee
problem. In the words of the Jordonian daily,
(Palestine. Feb. 19, 1949): "The Arab States, which
had encouraged the Palestine Arabs to leave their
homes temporarily in order to be out of the way of
the Arab invasion armies, have failed to keep their
promises to help these refugees." It should be noted
that 160,000 Arabs did not leave. There are current
ly 600,000 Israeli Arabs who have equal voting
rights and have representatives in the Knesset.
Let us now consider the premise that the Arab na
tions trust the PLO to have a state. In 1950 Jordan
formally annexed the West Bank (no misprint here).
It held this land until 1967. Did Jordan give this land
(ostensibly the land the PLO now desires) to the
PLO? No, it did not. It did not make any effort to
establish a second Arab state in Palestine. It did.

however, allow the PLO a base to stage the Jor
danian government. In 1970-71, Jordan waged a bit
ter war against the PLO killing upwards of6ooo peo
ple. The PLO then re-assembled their forces in Leb
anon. The presence of the Palestinian Arab ter
rorists tipped the delicate political balance holding
the Lebanese government together, resulting in a
civil war between the Christians and Arabs in 1975.
When it seemed as if the PLO was going to win, the
Syrians entered the fray and attacked the PLO. By
1976, one out of every 200 Lebanese had died in the
fighting and one out of every six had fled the coun
try. The Arab states have every reason to believe
that, given the PLO's disruptive past, a PLO-run
state would serve as a destsabilizing element in the
region. Jordan knows this better than any other
state, since the PLO has rightly claimed Jordan as
part of Palestine (Article 2, Palestine National Cov
enant, Cairo 1968).
Next we must consider the premise that Arab-Is
raeli tensions are caused by Arab concern for the
Palestinian Arab refugees. The very fact that there
would be no refugees if the Arab nations hadn't at
tacked in 1948 refutes this contention. In this war,
Egypt seized the Gaza Strip. It controlled this land
and its Palestinian Arab inhabitants until 1967. As
was the case with the West Bank, no state was
formed. The Palestinian Arabs were barred from
Egypt and subject to strict curfews. In the words of
Martha Gellhorn writing in the Atlantic Monthly in
October 1961: "The Gaza is not a hell-hole, not a
visible disaster. It is worse. It is a jail."
The Arab nations have insisted on keeping the
Palestinian Arabs in refugee camps where they live
under the care of the United Nations. Is there any
need for this? The combined land holdings of the
Arab league and Egypt are 5,286,000 square miles.
Israel has 7993 square miles. The combined popu
lation of the Arab league and Egypt was 157,250,000
in 1980 compared to 3,800,000 for Israel. This dis
parity doesn't seem to get much attention. The Ar
abs certainly have the space. How about resources?

In the recent war in Lebanon the Israelis captured
over a billion dollars in weapons from the PLO. The
Arab world and the PLO have seen fit to use their
vast resources for military purposes, while forcing
the Palestinian Arabs to live in shabby camps.
One might ask, "What would the Jews do in a sim
ilar situation." The question would be rather,
"What did the Jews do in the similar situation?"
Jews living in Arab countries were (and are) subject
to intense persecution. Consider for example the
case of the Jewish community in Iraq. In 1948, this
community numbered 125,000. Twenty-five years of
pogroms, public hangings and anti-Jewish laws
caused the Jewish community to flee. In 1973 only
400 Jews remained. Between 1948 and 1973 over
700,000 Jews fled savage persecution in Syria, Iraq,
Libya, Lebanon, Yemen, South Yemen, Tunisia,
Morocco, Algeria and Egypt. They were immediate
ly absorbed by the small state of Israel. The Palesti
nian Arabs can similarly be resetteled in any of the
enormous Arab states or at the very least in Jordan.
After all, Jordan is Eastern Palestine. Already, 60 to
70 percent of Jordan's population consists of West
Palestinian Arabs.
