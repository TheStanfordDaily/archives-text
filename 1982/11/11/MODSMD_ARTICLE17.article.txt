## Paper shuffling, backpack zipping disrupt class 
### 
Not many of us are completely
angelic when it comes to class atten
dance and tardies. This is under
standable given our remarkably active
and unpredictable daily life and its ac
companying time pressure. There are
some things over which we have little or
no control. Most students are fairly
conscientious, though, and most pro

fessors fairly understanding.
One thing we can control — and
don't do very well now — is how and
when we leave class. It's easy to think
that in a large lecture class, the pro
fessor won't notice you shuffling your
papers two minutes before the bell. It's
true. He won't notice you in particular,
but he certainty will notice 150 shuffling

papers and zipping backpacks, day af
ter day, and he certainly will be irked.
Another point of friction can be stu
dents leaving class (often in droves) af«
ter deciding thev don't like the lecture
or the guest speaker. What could b<
more rude? The fact that we pay so
much money to go here is no justifi
cation for being obnoxious to our pro*

fessors, as some argue. Respect isn't
measured in dollars. We should all have
the decency to not leave or start to leave
until the period is over, just as pro
fessors should plan to finish on time.
