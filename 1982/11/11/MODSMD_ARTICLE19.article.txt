## Why not put MX on the moon? 
### 
Over the past 10 years, U.S. military
officials have considered and discarded
over 30 different basing plans in their
search for an invulnerable method of
deploying the MX missile. It finally
looks as if the search might be winding
down to some sort of conclusion since
President Reagan has promised to rec
ommend a basing plan to Congress by
Dec. 1. As a consequence of Reagan's
promise, all of the hawks at the Pen
tagon have been busily scratching on
the backs of envelopes, hoping to sub
mit the winning entry to "The Basing
Game." They haven't had so much fun
since Atari came out with its "Commie
Invaders" video game.
Defense Secretary Caspar Wein
berger's pet scheme for basing the MX
was to put it on lightweight planes that
would be kept aloft for extended time
periods. This idea was appropriately
titled "Big Bird" option. I say ap
propriately because the name was taken
from a Sesame Street character and ac
curately reflects the degree of sophisti
cation and intelligence behind the con
tinuous flight option.
Another idea whose time never came
was the plan to put 100 MX missiles in
4600 shelters connected by train tracks
and shuttle them all around the state of
Nevada. Unfortuately for the ad
vocates of the "Shell Game," residents
of Nevada and nearby states were for
some odd reason upset over the pros
pect of the U.S. government spending

between $30 and $100 billion and using
more resources than went into the en
tire federal highway system in order to
make most of Nevada a target for
thousands of Soviet missiles.
A third option that the Pentagon
considered was concealing small MX
missiles in trucks and ferrying them
around on the nation's highways. Seri
ously. Critics of this plan were quick to
raise unforseen and highly involved
technical questions such as: "Well, gee,
don't you think that if everyone was
afraid that the Russians were going to
launch a nuclear attack then there
might be something of a traffic jam?"
Fortunately, these three basing
schemes proved to be so manifestly
absurd that they are no longer under se
rious consideration. Unfortunately,
they hae been replaced by a plan that is

I've got a better idea. Why don 7we just hire
professional baseball players to run around the
missile base with aluminum baseball bats to swat
down incoming missiles?

equally ludicrous. This plan has be
come known as the "dense-pack" op
tion, a title that is again symbolic of the
awesome intellectual capacities of its
proponents. The idea behind dense
pack is that the United States could
supposedly make its MX missiles in
vulnerable by basing them close togeth
er so that incoming Soviet missiles
would destroy each other instead of de
stroying the MX system.
When I first heard of the dense pack
plan, I didn't know if I should laugh or
cry. The dense-pack concept, I thought,
was flawed in several ways in even the
most rudimentary armchair nuclear
strategist would be quick to discover.
One of these was the painfully obvious
conclusion that if the force of one Sovi
et nuclear blast was enough to keep
further Soviet missiles from getting in,
then it was certainly enough to keep
U.S. missiles from getting out. Another
was the possibility that the Soviets
could merely simultaneously detonate
a number of nuclear missiles in order to
destroy closely packed MX missiles, a
feat which would be no great challenge
to any country capable of launching

missiles over thousands of miles to land
within several hundred feet of their
targets. Surely, I thought, the Pentagon
must have considered and overcome
such elementary objections?
If there is one thing that the MX con
troversy has taught me, it is this: never
overestimate the intelligence of anyone
who thinks that Ronald Reagan is the
best thing since the Cold War.
When questioned recently about the
possibility that the Soviets might de
stroy densely packed MX missiles by si
multaneously detonating several war
heads at ground level, an Air Force gen
eral who is one of the leading advocates
of dense pack replied, according to The
New York Times, that "the United
States could, if necessary, defeat such
an offense by strewing the missile base
with large boulders." Right.

I've got a better idea. Why don't we
just hire professional baseball play«rs
to run around the missile base with
aluminum baseball bats to swat down
incoming missiles? In fact, I've got sev
eral better ideas. Why don't we take all
of the highly skilled MX proponents
who are so vital to our nation's security
and densely pack them somewhere in
the middle of Nevada so they'll be
"safe" from Soviet missiles and safely
remote from Washington? Why don't
we disguise M X launchers as grain silos
so the Soviets won't nuke America for
fear of irradiating the grain that they
need? Why don't we sell the Soviets
shoes with the laces tied together so that
they'll trip when they reach for the nu
clear button?
Why are we and the Soviets so insane
ly paranoid that we refuse to seriously
negotiate an arms treaty that places lim
itations on destabilizing first strike
weapons like the MX, the Pershing 11,
the Trident D-5 and the SS-18 and 19?
