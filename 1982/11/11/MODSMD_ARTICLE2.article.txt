# Pleased with Democratic gain
## Univ. lauds election results 
### DAVID AZRIN Senior staff writer 
Top administrators here are hopeful that the strong Dem
ocratic electoral showing will stem the tide of President Rea
gan's budget cuts and send more federal dollars Stanford's
way.
They believe the addition of 26 Democratic seats in the
House may enable Congress to hold the line against Reagan
adminstration cutbacks in funding for research and student
financial aid.
"Looking at the composition of the House, the average
level of sympathy for funding would probably be better. I
expect it will be easier for the University to get its message
across," President Donald Kennedy told the Daily.
But the failure of Democrats to gain control of the Senate
may make it difficult for these funding bills to get out of
"Congress, according to Robert Freelen, associate vice presi
dent of public affairs.
Republican control of the Senate managed to survive the
election test, although GOP senators in more than five states
barely squeaked by their Democratic opponents.
"With the Senate still controlled by Republicans, you
could end up with more stalemates," Freelen said.
Administrators fear that despite the Democratic gains,
record-high federal budget deficits will prevent future feder
al funding increases.
"When you see all the news about the deficits, you can't
help but be pessimistic about the levels of funding," Freelen
said.
Gerald Lieberman, dean of graduate studies and research,
said Reagan adminstration cuts have reduced the level of re
search funding here. But he said that the federal budget defi
cit will probably prevent the new Congress from increasing
funding.
"I'm not optimistic that there's going to be a major shift in
research funding policy over the next two years especially be
cause the deficit is so enormous," Lieberman said.
The University was particularly affected by the Reagan
adniinstration's cuts in federal agencies, Lieberman said,
particularly the cuts in the Environmental Protection Agen
cy.
Lieberman said that the defense budget cuts proposed by
Democrats to help balance the budget may also have a
detrimental effect on federal research funding.
"There will be some cutbacks in defense, but I don't see it
going into research. In fact, there may be cutbacks in defense
research and that could have a negative effect," he said.
Funding for the National Institute of Health and the Na
tional Science Foundation, two important sources of re
search dollars, has remained slightly below inflation, accord
ing to Lieberman.
The Reagan adminstration has also proposed drastic cuts

in federal student financial aid during the past two years. Fi
nancial aid administrators here said they are hopeful the new
Congress will provide stronger resistance against future cuts,
but they fear the budget deficit will make funding increases
impossible.
"1 don't expect were going to see much in increases until
the whole issue of the budget deficits is resolved. We're just
going to try and hold the line," said Robert Huff, director of
financial aids.
"With the pressure on the federal budget, we aren't going
to see any great increases in student aid," Freelen said.
Huff predicted that the Reagan adminstration would pro
pose deeper cuts in student aid next year, but he hopes the
stronger Democratic House "will be less disposed to go
along with the administration's proposed cuts."
Kennedy was also optimistic that the new Congress will
provide stronger-resistance against cuts. Conc«rnir*f>»H»deni
aid, Kennedy said, "I think we can expect to do significantly
better in this House than the last."
The Reagan adminstration has supported eliminating the
State Student Incentive Grants (SSIG), Supplementary
Education Opportunity Grants (SEOG), and National
Direct Student Loans (NDSL), according to Jacyn Mitchell,
legislative analyst in government relations.
In addition, the administration has supported cutting
back Guaranteed Student Loans (GSL) by disqualifying
graduate students and by increasing the origination fee, she
said.
The present Democratic Congress has provided some re
sistance to the cuts, though they have approved bills which
will decrease student aid funding by 9 to 30 percent in real
dollars for the 1982 academic year, according to Mitchell.
These cuts include a needs analysis for GSL, a 5 percent
GSL loan origination fee, a cap on funding for Pell-Grants,
and increased NDSL interest rates.
Last month, Congress overrode a presidential veto on a
supplemental appropriations bill which will reduce cuts in
Pell-Grants and SEOG programs from 25 percent to only 4
percent, Mitchell said.
The House Appropriations Committee has voted to keep
student aid funding levels constant for the 1983 academic
year, but the measure still must pass the full House and Sen
ate.
"Congress basically is rejecting the president's programs
to cut student aid," Mitchell said.
The biggest obstacle to any increases in federal funding
facing the new Congress appears to be the federal budget def
icit. According to Freelen, "the pressure is mounting on Re
publicans and Democrats to come to grips with the federal
budget."
