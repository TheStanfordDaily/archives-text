# Emeritus professors recalled to duty
## 
### ERNST HALPERIN 
Ten more emeritus pro
fessors have been recalled to
active duty here for the aca
demic year 1982-83, bringing
the total for the current year
to 29.
Although the individual
reasons for returning to active
duty may differ, emeritus pro
fessors are generally recalled
to active teaching duty for two
basic reasons: to participate in
a special program, or to lec
ture.
"In order to keep pro
fessors' services who are great
lecturers, the University re
calls them so as not to lose
their skills," said Marvin
Chodorow, emeritus pro
fessor in applied physics and
electrical engineering.

Prof. Alexander Fetter,
chairman of the Faculty Sen
ate, agreed. "Recalling emer
iti is a matter of making good
use of excellent teachers," he
said. "Some of the best faculty
I know are emeritus pro
fessors."
For the professors them
selves, teaching is a way to
keep in touch with the ac
tivities of the university.
"I enjoy teaching," said
Bert Gerow, emeritus pro
fessor of anthropology and
the curator of the an
thropological collection here.
"It's very informative."
Arthur Giese, emeritus pro
fessor of undergraduate stud
ies and the humanities special
program, said: "The pay is
not enough to be a motive for

emeriti to teach. I enjoy
teaching beacause I like to
keep up with the younger gen
eration. Often they have ideas
which are quite good. In
teaching, you are forced to be
aware of what's going on
around you. It keeps you ac
tive."
The decision to recall a pro
fessor is made at the de
partmental level, then the rec
ommendation is passed on to
the dean's office. The dean ap
proves the nomination, and
he gives it to the provost's of
fice, which then issues an in
vitation to the professor.
Emeritus professors' work
loads are usually lighter than
regular professors, and emer
iti do not have to be assigned
to faculty committees.
