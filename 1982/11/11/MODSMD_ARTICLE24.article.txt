## Insights at the A 						tender Emanuel Ax plays the classics 
### MARC VINCENTI 
Tenderness, claritv of musical thought, the
willingness to put his heart and mind at the
composer's service — these were the qualities
shown by Emanuel Ax in his piano recital in
Memorial Auditorium last Sunday.
A friendly, bespectacled man in his early 30s,
Ax is an American pianist who we can look for
ward to hearing for years to come.
His program was chosen with care. The first
half consisted of a Haydn sonata, the Six Little
Pieces, Opus 19 by Schoenberg, and
Beethoven's Variations and Fugue, Opus 35
("Eroica"). The juxtaposition of the Haydn and

Schoenberg works is intriguing The sonata
(Hob. KVI/48) has a free-form quality to it. It
has only two movements, and the first one is not
in standard sonata form but in a form that alter
nates episodes in C-major and C-minor, all the
while developing their musical material. The
movement also alternates — almost im
pressionisticallv — between rippling bursts of
energy and quiet pools of repose.
The Schoenberg pieces, too. though in a more
modern idiom, present simply a flow of occur
rences — some fast and fleeting, some slow and
contemplative. Shoenberg's work seems like a
more fragile, evanescent incarnation of the
same spirit that prompted Haydn. Or, if you

will. Schoenberg's music sounds like Haydn
struck suddenly by self-doubt.
This Havdn-Schoenberg sensibility was the
perfect foil for Beethoven's Variations and
Fugue, which are founded so securely upon a
stable bass progression, and which are so struc
turally water-tight and dramatically well
shaped. From Beethoven and his concentrated,
careful design the program leapt, across an in
termission, to romantic impulse and blended
sonorities — in other words, to Chopin.
Ax's rendition of the Beethoven work could
be termed the "piece de resistance" of the after
noon. Every nook and cranny of the piece, all
the variations, all the thematic material and in
cidental motives were made purposeful,
coherent and part of the whole. And vet a spec
trum of feeling was encompassed; the variations
were truly various, full of contrasts.
In Ax's hands, the work followed this outline:
I) An introductory "fanfare" that displays the
crucial bass theme, at once creating suspense
and raising our expectations; 2) A succession of
variations that are infectious, spirited, and
carefree, which lead surprisingly to 3) A long
Largo section with an unexpected, sober mood
of searching and questioning, which dissolves
into 4) An energetic fugue that returns us to a
happy, affirmative state of affairs.
At the very beginning, in the opening meas
ures, Ax gave us a firm tempo and a distinct
phrasing of the theme, thus laving a solid foun
dation for all that followed. His tempo re
mained constant (except for the Largo) straight
through to the subject of the fugue, many pages
later. The initial theme, in octaves, was played
entirely "non legato;" quiet, detached notes
building slightly to a quickening, staccato end
of-phrase that created immediate suspense.
Then, all alone and inexplicable, there were the
three bold chords on the dominant tone, rapped
out firmly, insistently — the harbingers of much
that was to come.
The treble theme (familiar from the "Eroica"
symphonv) was stated with assurance, op
timism and good humor. Of the variations. I
can give only some highlights. Variation
number one prolonged the sunny mood, but
number two made a rapid crescendo — surging
ahead on the roller-coaster triplets, ascending
dizzily to the cadenza, which was a long for
tissimo slide, as outlandish as the wavy images
in a fun-house mir.ror.
Variation VII was a small drama in itself,
with the octave canon sounding like a playful,
puckish child, and the dense, rumbling chords
playing the role of a frowning, scolding grand
father. The ensuing variation was a nice con
trast — a dreamy, Chopinesque interlude col
ored with a lot of pedal.
The tenth variation included a curt, clear re
minder of the thrice-struck fortissimo motive.
Variation XIII buzzed noisily, with the high,
grace-noted B-flat chirping out loonily above

the din. The minor-key 14th variation led nicely
into the Largo variation, wherein Ax took a dis
tinct change-of-pacc into a more sober, ques
tioning, deadly-earnest world. The dramatic si
lences were well-timed, and Ax made vivid
sense out of the one-at-a-time, climactic notes
marked "tenuto." These were forceful jabs; no
longer is the music simplv questioning. This is
an outcry, a demand.
And so on. The felicites of Ax's interpreta
tion are too numerous to mention. His brisk,
bright trills gave momentum to the finale's hap
py farewell, and the concluding cadence
bespoke a firm "It's over."
Ax's performance of the Haydn sonata was
all that could be wished. The "Andante con
espressione" exhibited a well-governed
momentum, power held in restraint, and feel
ings at once lender and unwavering. The tempo
was ever-so-gently expanded and contracted.
(In his master class on Saturday night, Ax com
mented wryly that there are two ways of playing
in one strict time: "on the fast side, and on the
slow side.") The staccato runs were neat and
clean. Nearing the end the triplet rush was ex
hilarating, and in the deceptive cadence that
ensues Ax held the unforeseen chord for a long
time, letting all the energy dissipate into near
silence.
In the Rondo Ax didn't stint on the "presto"
pace, preferring to smudge a note or two rather
than to dampen bv one jot the music's giggly
spirit.
In the Six Little Pieces, Opus 19 by Schoen
berg, Ax seems to have taken his cue from the
last of the six. This tiny piece is a spare, muted
lament, written at a time when Schoenberg bore
in his mind the recent death of his friend Gustav
Mahler. In Ax's interpretation, the hush of this
closing statement is expanded to embrace, to
one degree or another, the entire suite. Thus,
the music has the poignant quality of a faintly
heard conversation, where one can't make out
the words but can hear only their murmur.
Aided by subtle pedalling, Ax's playing of
this work was surprisingly songful and legato.
His chords were well-balanced so that, in this
music where every note counts, every note was
heard. The second piece was so slowly paced
that one could hear the reiterated staccato
thirds echo inside the piano like ghosts. The
lone accented, rolled chord was a stab of alarm.
The end of the fourth piece provided the only
angry outburst, and Ax scrupulously observed
the marking ("martellato"). In the last piece,
the softly chiming chords were the gentlest of
tugs on one's heartstrings, and Ax achieved the
requested "pppp" quietness. He sounded the
ending eighth-notes without a trace of ritardan
do, then let the notes die out of their own ac
cord.
After intermission, the program was all
Chopin: the Ballade in F minor, three
Mazurkas, and the Andante Spianato and

Grande Polonaise. Ax's feeling for Chopin was
pervaded by a tenderness that was, however, en
tirely free of cloving sentiment or gushy
rhapsodizing. His Chopin can be exuberant and
muscular without being strident or overbear
ing. Though fond of delaying the downbeat or
slowing a phrase at its end, Ax doesn't make a
vice of his rubato. He can play a springy dance
rhythm, and he can make the piano sing.
The Ballade is the most substantial of these
works. Notable in Ax's interpretation were the
healthy clip of his tempo (he didn't emphasize
the "Andante . . at the expense of the ". . .

con moto"), the downplaying of the counter
melody that emerges to accompany the theme,
and his big accelerando on the massive chords
that lead to the "fff" climax — following which
he slowed up not a whit on the C-major resolu
tion. Ax appeared to be quite immersed in the

coda, which is a muddy stretch of music unless
you keep your head above water.
In the Andante Spianato and Grande
Polonaise the showy effects were not shown-olf,
but came across as a natural display of high
spirits. Ax's "leggiero" runs were gossamer,
and he took the piece about as seriously as one
C an — always aware that we're mainly just
along for the ride, and the ride is a lot of fun.
Ax played two encores: a lovely "Des
Abends" from Schumann's Opus 12, and an
other Chopin mazurka, Opus 59 No. 2.
Emanuel Ax isan unassuming man. Hischar-

acteristic gesture is a modest, agreeable shrug
accompanied by a mild smile. That's the look he
gave in response to the applause, indicating his
willingness to play a second encore — as if td
say, "Well, if you really want me to . . Yes, 1
reallv wanted him to.

minder of the thrice-struck fortissimo motive.
Variation XIII buzzed noisily, with the high,
grace-noted B-flat chirping out loonily above

the din. The minor-key 14th variation led nicely
into the Largo variation, wherein Ax took a dis
tinct change-of-pacc into a more sober, ques
tioning, deadly-earnest world. The dramatic si
lences were well-timed, and Ax made vivid
sense out of the one-at-a-time, climactic notes
marked "tenuto." These were forceful jabs; no
longer is the music simplv questioning. This is
an outcry, a demand.
And so on. The felicites of Ax's interpreta
tion are too numerous to mention. His brisk,
bright trills gave momentum to the finale's hap
py farewell, and the concluding cadence
bespoke a firm "It's over."
Ax's performance of the Haydn sonata was
all that could be wished. The "Andante con
espressione" exhibited a well-governed
momentum, power held in restraint, and feel
ings at once lender and unwavering. The tempo
was ever-so-gently expanded and contracted.
(In his master class on Saturday night, Ax com
mented wryly that there are two ways of playing
in one strict time: "on the fast side, and on the
slow side.") The staccato runs were neat and
clean. Nearing the end the triplet rush was ex
hilarating, and in the deceptive cadence that
ensues Ax held the unforeseen chord for a long
time, letting all the energy dissipate into near
silence.
In the Rondo Ax didn't stint on the "presto"
pace, preferring to smudge a note or two rather
than to dampen bv one jot the music's giggly
spirit.
In the Six Little Pieces, Opus 19 by Schoen
berg, Ax seems to have taken his cue from the
last of the six. This tiny piece is a spare, muted
lament, written at a time when Schoenberg bore
in his mind the recent death of his friend Gustav
Mahler. In Ax's interpretation, the hush of this
closing statement is expanded to embrace, to
one degree or another, the entire suite. Thus,
the music has the poignant quality of a faintly
heard conversation, where one can't make out
the words but can hear only their murmur.
Aided by subtle pedalling, Ax's playing of
this work was surprisingly songful and legato.
His chords were well-balanced so that, in this
music where every note counts, every note was
heard. The second piece was so slowly paced
that one could hear the reiterated staccato
thirds echo inside the piano like ghosts. The
lone accented, rolled chord was a stab of alarm.
The end of the fourth piece provided the only
angry outburst, and Ax scrupulously observed
the marking ("martellato"). In the last piece,
the softly chiming chords were the gentlest of
tugs on one's heartstrings, and Ax achieved the
requested "pppp" quietness. He sounded the
ending eighth-notes without a trace of ritardan
do, then let the notes die out of their own ac
cord.
After intermission, the program was all
Chopin: the Ballade in F minor, three
Mazurkas, and the Andante Spianato and

Grande Polonaise. Ax's feeling for Chopin was
pervaded by a tenderness that was, however, en
tirely free of cloving sentiment or gushy
rhapsodizing. His Chopin can be exuberant and
muscular without being strident or overbear
ing. Though fond of delaying the downbeat or
slowing a phrase at its end, Ax doesn't make a
vice of his rubato. He can play a springy dance
rhythm, and he can make the piano sing.
The Ballade is the most substantial of these
works. Notable in Ax's interpretation were the
healthy clip of his tempo (he didn't emphasize
the "Andante . . at the expense of the ". . .

con moto"), the downplaying of the counter
melody that emerges to accompany the theme,
and his big accelerando on the massive chords
that lead to the "fff" climax — following which
he slowed up not a whit on the C-major resolu
tion. Ax appeared to be quite immersed in the

coda, which is a muddy stretch of music unless
you keep your head above water.
In the Andante Spianato and Grande
Polonaise the showy effects were not shown-olf,
but came across as a natural display of high
spirits. Ax's "leggiero" runs were gossamer,
and he took the piece about as seriously as one
C an — always aware that we're mainly just
along for the ride, and the ride is a lot of fun.
Ax played two encores: a lovely "Des
Abends" from Schumann's Opus 12, and an
other Chopin mazurka, Opus 59 No. 2.
Emanuel Ax isan unassuming man. Hischar-

acteristic gesture is a modest, agreeable shrug
accompanied by a mild smile. That's the look he
gave in response to the applause, indicating his
willingness to play a second encore — as if td
say, "Well, if you really want me to . . Yes, 1
reallv wanted him to.



'He took the piece about as

and the ride is a lot of fun. ..'


Tenderness, claritv of musical thought, the
willingness to put his heart and mind at the
composer's service — these were the qualities
shown by Emanuel Ax in his piano recital in
Memorial Auditorium last Sunday.
A friendly, bespectacled man in his early 30s,
Ax is an American pianist who we can look for
ward to hearing for years to come.
His program was chosen with care. The first
half consisted of a Haydn sonata, the Six Little
Pieces, Opus 19 by Schoenberg, and
Beethoven's Variations and Fugue, Opus 35
("Eroica"). The juxtaposition of the Haydn and

Schoenberg works is intriguing The sonata
(Hob. KVI/48) has a free-form quality to it. It
has only two movements, and the first one is not
in standard sonata form but in a form that alter
nates episodes in C-major and C-minor, all the
while developing their musical material. The
movement also alternates — almost im
pressionisticallv — between rippling bursts of
energy and quiet pools of repose.
The Schoenberg pieces, too. though in a more
modern idiom, present simply a flow of occur
rences — some fast and fleeting, some slow and
contemplative. Shoenberg's work seems like a
more fragile, evanescent incarnation of the
same spirit that prompted Haydn. Or, if you

will. Schoenberg's music sounds like Haydn
struck suddenly by self-doubt.
This Havdn-Schoenberg sensibility was the
perfect foil for Beethoven's Variations and
Fugue, which are founded so securely upon a
stable bass progression, and which are so struc
turally water-tight and dramatically well
shaped. From Beethoven and his concentrated,
careful design the program leapt, across an in
termission, to romantic impulse and blended
sonorities — in other words, to Chopin.
Ax's rendition of the Beethoven work could
be termed the "piece de resistance" of the after
noon. Every nook and cranny of the piece, all
the variations, all the thematic material and in
cidental motives were made purposeful,
coherent and part of the whole. And vet a spec
trum of feeling was encompassed; the variations
were truly various, full of contrasts.
In Ax's hands, the work followed this outline:
I) An introductory "fanfare" that displays the
crucial bass theme, at once creating suspense
and raising our expectations; 2) A succession of
variations that are infectious, spirited, and
carefree, which lead surprisingly to 3) A long
Largo section with an unexpected, sober mood
of searching and questioning, which dissolves
into 4) An energetic fugue that returns us to a
happy, affirmative state of affairs.
At the very beginning, in the opening meas
ures, Ax gave us a firm tempo and a distinct
phrasing of the theme, thus laving a solid foun
dation for all that followed. His tempo re
mained constant (except for the Largo) straight
through to the subject of the fugue, many pages
later. The initial theme, in octaves, was played
entirely "non legato;" quiet, detached notes
building slightly to a quickening, staccato end
of-phrase that created immediate suspense.
Then, all alone and inexplicable, there were the
three bold chords on the dominant tone, rapped
out firmly, insistently — the harbingers of much
that was to come.
The treble theme (familiar from the "Eroica"
symphonv) was stated with assurance, op
timism and good humor. Of the variations. I
can give only some highlights. Variation
number one prolonged the sunny mood, but
number two made a rapid crescendo — surging
ahead on the roller-coaster triplets, ascending
dizzily to the cadenza, which was a long for
tissimo slide, as outlandish as the wavy images
in a fun-house mir.ror.
Variation VII was a small drama in itself,
with the octave canon sounding like a playful,
puckish child, and the dense, rumbling chords
playing the role of a frowning, scolding grand
father. The ensuing variation was a nice con
trast — a dreamy, Chopinesque interlude col
ored with a lot of pedal.
The tenth variation included a curt, clear re
minder of the thrice-struck fortissimo motive.
Variation XIII buzzed noisily, with the high,
grace-noted B-flat chirping out loonily above

the din. The minor-key 14th variation led nicely
into the Largo variation, wherein Ax took a dis
tinct change-of-pacc into a more sober, ques

Tenderness, claritv of musical thought, the
willingness to put his heart and mind at the
composer's service — these were the qualities
shown by Emanuel Ax in his piano recital in
Memorial Auditorium last Sunday.
A friendly, bespectacled man in his early 30s,
Ax is an American pianist who we can look for
ward to hearing for years to come.
His program was chosen with care. The first
half consisted of a Haydn sonata, the Six Little
Pieces, Opus 19 by Schoenberg, and
Beethoven's Variations and Fugue, Opus 35
("Eroica"). The juxtaposition of the Haydn and

Schoenberg works is intriguing The sonata
(Hob. KVI/48) has a free-form quality to it. It
has only two movements, and the first one is not
in standard sonata form but in a form that alter
nates episodes in C-major and C-minor, all the
while developing their musical material. The
movement also alternates — almost im
pressionisticallv — between rippling bursts of
energy and quiet pools of repose.
The Schoenberg pieces, too. though in a more
modern idiom, present simply a flow of occur
rences — some fast and fleeting, some slow and
contemplative. Shoenberg's work seems like a
more fragile, evanescent incarnation of the
same spirit that prompted Haydn. Or, if you

will. Schoenberg's music sounds like Haydn
struck suddenly by self-doubt.
This Havdn-Schoenberg sensibility was the
perfect foil for Beethoven's Variations and
Fugue, which are founded so securely upon a
stable bass progression, and which are so struc
turally water-tight and dramatically well
shaped. From Beethoven and his concentrated,
careful design the program leapt, across an in
termission, to romantic impulse and blended
sonorities — in other words, to Chopin.
Ax's rendition of the Beethoven work could
be termed the "piece de resistance" of the after
noon. Every nook and cranny of the piece, all
the variations, all the thematic material and in
cidental motives were made purposeful,
coherent and part of the whole. And vet a spec
trum of feeling was encompassed; the variations
were truly various, full of contrasts.
In Ax's hands, the work followed this outline:
I) An introductory "fanfare" that displays the
crucial bass theme, at once creating suspense
and raising our expectations; 2) A succession of
variations that are infectious, spirited, and
carefree, which lead surprisingly to 3) A long
Largo section with an unexpected, sober mood
of searching and questioning, which dissolves
into 4) An energetic fugue that returns us to a
happy, affirmative state of affairs.
At the very beginning, in the opening meas
ures, Ax gave us a firm tempo and a distinct
phrasing of the theme, thus laving a solid foun
dation for all that followed. His tempo re
mained constant (except for the Largo) straight
through to the subject of the fugue, many pages
later. The initial theme, in octaves, was played
entirely "non legato;" quiet, detached notes
building slightly to a quickening, staccato end
of-phrase that created immediate suspense.
Then, all alone and inexplicable, there were the
three bold chords on the dominant tone, rapped
out firmly, insistently — the harbingers of much
that was to come.
The treble theme (familiar from the "Eroica"
symphonv) was stated with assurance, op
timism and good humor. Of the variations. I
can give only some highlights. Variation
number one prolonged the sunny mood, but
number two made a rapid crescendo — surging
ahead on the roller-coaster triplets, ascending
dizzily to the cadenza, which was a long for
tissimo slide, as outlandish as the wavy images
in a fun-house mir.ror.
Variation VII was a small drama in itself,
with the octave canon sounding like a playful,
puckish child, and the dense, rumbling chords
playing the role of a frowning, scolding grand
father. The ensuing variation was a nice con
trast — a dreamy, Chopinesque interlude col
ored with a lot of pedal.
The tenth variation included a curt, clear re
minder of the thrice-struck fortissimo motive.
Variation XIII buzzed noisily, with the high,
grace-noted B-flat chirping out loonily above

the din. The minor-key 14th variation led nicely
into the Largo variation, wherein Ax took a dis
tinct change-of-pacc into a more sober, ques
tioning, deadly-earnest world. The dramatic si
lences were well-timed, and Ax made vivid
sense out of the one-at-a-time, climactic notes
marked "tenuto." These were forceful jabs; no
longer is the music simplv questioning. This is
an outcry, a demand.
And so on. The felicites of Ax's interpreta
tion are too numerous to mention. His brisk,
bright trills gave momentum to the finale's hap
py farewell, and the concluding cadence
bespoke a firm "It's over."
Ax's performance of the Haydn sonata was
all that could be wished. The "Andante con
espressione" exhibited a well-governed
momentum, power held in restraint, and feel
ings at once lender and unwavering. The tempo
was ever-so-gently expanded and contracted.
(In his master class on Saturday night, Ax com
mented wryly that there are two ways of playing
in one strict time: "on the fast side, and on the
slow side.") The staccato runs were neat and
clean. Nearing the end the triplet rush was ex
hilarating, and in the deceptive cadence that
ensues Ax held the unforeseen chord for a long
time, letting all the energy dissipate into near
silence.
In the Rondo Ax didn't stint on the "presto"
pace, preferring to smudge a note or two rather
than to dampen bv one jot the music's giggly
spirit.
In the Six Little Pieces, Opus 19 by Schoen
berg, Ax seems to have taken his cue from the
last of the six. This tiny piece is a spare, muted
lament, written at a time when Schoenberg bore
in his mind the recent death of his friend Gustav
Mahler. In Ax's interpretation, the hush of this
closing statement is expanded to embrace, to
one degree or another, the entire suite. Thus,
the music has the poignant quality of a faintly
heard conversation, where one can't make out
the words but can hear only their murmur.
Aided by subtle pedalling, Ax's playing of
this work was surprisingly songful and legato.
His chords were well-balanced so that, in this
music where every note counts, every note was
heard. The second piece was so slowly paced
that one could hear the reiterated staccato
thirds echo inside the piano like ghosts. The
lone accented, rolled chord was a stab of alarm.
The end of the fourth piece provided the only
angry outburst, and Ax scrupulously observed
the marking ("martellato"). In the last piece,
the softly chiming chords were the gentlest of
tugs on one's heartstrings, and Ax achieved the
requested "pppp" quietness. He sounded the
ending eighth-notes without a trace of ritardan
do, then let the notes die out of their own ac
cord.
After intermission, the program was all
Chopin: the Ballade in F minor, three
Mazurkas, and the Andante Spianato and

Grande Polonaise. Ax's feeling for Chopin was
pervaded by a tenderness that was, however, en
tirely free of cloving sentiment or gushy
rhapsodizing. His Chopin can be exuberant and
muscular without being strident or overbear
ing. Though fond of delaying the downbeat or
slowing a phrase at its end, Ax doesn't make a
vice of his rubato. He can play a springy dance
rhythm, and he can make the piano sing.
The Ballade is the most substantial of these
works. Notable in Ax's interpretation were the
healthy clip of his tempo (he didn't emphasize
the "Andante . . at the expense of the ". . .

con moto"), the downplaying of the counter
melody that emerges to accompany the theme,
and his big accelerando on the massive chords
that lead to the "fff" climax — following which
he slowed up not a whit on the C-major resolu
tion. Ax appeared to be quite immersed in the

coda, which is a muddy stretch of music unless
you keep your head above water.
In the Andante Spianato and Grande
Polonaise the showy effects were not shown-olf,
but came across as a natural display of high

and he took the piece about as seriously as one
