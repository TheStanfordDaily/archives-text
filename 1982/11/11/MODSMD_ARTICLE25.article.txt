## Versatile Joe Jackson proves his maturity 
### NATHAN BROSTROM LUKE COLE 
The last time that I went to a
Joe Jackson concert was in the
summer of 1980 at the Universal
Amphitheater in Hollywood.
This was in the midst of Joe's
"angry young man" days, a time
when he taunted the crowds, ver
bally abusing his fans and storm
ing off stage after only an hour's
worth of music. This was also the
beginning of his diversification, a
transition period from the driv
ing, upbeat hits of his first two
albums, Look Sharp and I'm the

Man, to the slower, more
abrasive sound of Beat Crazy;
the crowds had not yet accepted
the transition and Joe seemed
tormented by their rejection and
annoyed bv requests for old fa
vorites. Thus, it was with trepida
tion that I went to see Joe Jack
son last Saturday night at the
Berkeley Community Theater.
The concert was thus one of
the most pleasant surprises of the
year. For the last few years, Joe
and his new band have been ex
perimenting with a number of in
novative musical forms, from the
swinging sound of 1940s bop on
Joe Jackson's Jumping Jive to the
clean, refined melodies on his
new album Night and Day. Gone
were the biting, edgy lyrics of
Beat Crazy: Joe had actually
written a number of songs about
genuine romance, not the
estranged relationships of "One
to One" or "Geraldine and
John". His last two albums had
also been noted for the absence of

guitars, and all rumors proved
correct when the band appeared
sans guitars.
Jackson opened up with one of
his new songs, "Another
World," and then satisfied the
expectant crowd with three older
tunes off of Look Sharp. "Fools
in Love," though treated in Jack
son's new, mellower style, still
had its haunting edge. "Look
Sharp" was just as raucous as
ever despite the lack of guitar,
and "Sunday Papers" showed
that Joe's sardonic social
criticism has not tempered with
his music. The set reassured fans
that Jackson would indeed play
his older stuff, missing guitar and
all, with the same flair and energy
of years past.
Jackson bantered often with
the crowd, asking if the hooters
and shriekers were "from L.A."
and one time leaving the stage en
tirely in mock disgust at repeated
whistling. His antics (and those
of the crowd) seemed in good hu
mor, though, a distinct change
from his earlier concert tours.
The entire band gathered at
center stage for what proved to
be one of the high points of the
evening, an a cappella version of
"Is She Really Going Out With
Him?" The song proved to the 1
audience that Joe Jackson is a
musician on his own terms, will- j
ing to experiment with songs and
styles that please him. The fact!

that it also pleased the audience is
another tribute to his talent as a
musician. His experiments went
further with "Cha Cha Loco," a
new song with a latin beat and ev
ery imaginable percussion instru
ment.
Jackson's first set concluded
with a taste of his new album, the
song "Real Men," which com
bines the intricate melodies of his
new sound with the harsh social
statements of previous works
("This one's dedicated to all you
macho men in the audience," an
nounced Joe).
Joe Jackson is as innovative in
his choice of band members as in
his choice of music — two wom
en on percussion and syn
thesizers complemented another
male percussionist and the ever
present Graham Maby on bass.
The intermission ended with a
Frank Sinatra recording of Cole
Porter's classic "Night and

Day," establishing the tone for
the second set and setting the
stage for Jackson's elaborate
keyboard melodies, a style remi
niscent of Porter's era. The key
board is the main element of
Jackson's new sound, and re
flects his growing maturity as a
musician — a musician not de
pendent on the guitar for the
body of his sound. Jackson is
more confident and at peace with
himself, and this is shown by the
new sensitivity in his lyrics and
the tight, harmonic sound of the
keyboards.
Joe Jackson's keyboards were
showcased in the second set,
which opened with an emotional
version of"Breaking Us in Two"
and continued through most of
the remaining songs off of Night
and Day. "Cancer" and "Target"
both feature a. percussion-ori
ented latin beat and Joe's piano.
His current hit "Steppin' Out"
not only provided the best exam
ple of his new style, but also
proved its popular appeal; the ec
static crowd rushed the stage and
remained there for the rest of the
concert. Jackson left the stage for
.many of the songs, preferring a
behind the elevated key-

« board near the back of the
stage. The string of new
songs was punctuated with
a moving rendition of the
older song "It's Different
For Girls" and a highly

energetic version of "One More
Time." He also featured two
songs from his intermediate peri
od: "Beat Crazy," an abrasive,
rowdy dance tune, and "Tuxedo
Junction," a song off Joe Jack
son's Jumpiri Jive that featured a
tremendous bass line but lost
some of its quality with the sub
stitution of synthesizers for
horns.
He closed the set on a poignant
and powerful note ("This one is
for all the romantics out there —
everyone who cried at ET"),
playing "A Slow Song" to the
height of its romantic potential,
drawing every musical peak to its
emotional utmost.
The band left the stage to the
thunderous applause of the sell
out crowd. They returned for two
encores, as different from each
other as night and day and yet
surprisingly compatible. The first
encore demonstrated again Joe
Jackson's versatility, featuring a
selection of Motown hits from
the 19605. Unlike other per
formers who attempt the same,
Jackson's renditions of these
classics were successful; he did
not need a road map to the beat.

After driving through Stevie
Wonder's "Uptight," Jackson
combined with bassist Mabv for
especially well done covers of
Smokev Robinson's "Tears of a
Clown" and the Su -
premes/Temptations' "I'm
Going to Make You Love Me."
He finished the medlev with
"Heatwave" and Marvin Gaye's
"How Sweet it is."
Again the band left the stage
and again the crowd responded
enthusiastically. Joe and the
band returned for one final song,
which, to no one's surprise, was
"I'm the Man," the raging favor
ite of Joe's fans. This conclusion
to the concert proved to all that
Joe Jackson has successfully
melded his styles and emerged as
a stronger, more mature musi
cian. He is the man.
