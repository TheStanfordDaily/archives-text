## 
### 
Santa Clara County Sheriff detec
tives are now looking past state lines as
well as within San Jose citv limits in
their search for Donald John Amos, the
suspect in last month's murder of Stan
ford junior Angela Arvidson, according
to police.
Lt. Ron Conway, a homicide detec
tive, said police are checking "a couple
of places out of state" in addition to
continuing their statewide search for
Amos. Conway said that residences of
Amos's relatives are being investigated.
Monday night, however, the Amos
investigation shifted to Oak Ridge Mall
in San Jose after detectives received a
call from someone who thought they
had recognized Amos. Conway said po
lice were unable to locate Amos, though
they did find someone who came close
to matching his description.
Since the call came from someone
who knew Amos, Conway said this per
son may have actually seen the suspect,
even though police were unable to lo
cate Amos.
Conway said the police periodically
receive tips from people regarding the
location of Amos.
The department is still in the process
of mailing out "wanted" fliers to police
throughout the state and additional out
of state areas, Conway said.
Police believe Amos fled his San Jose
home with his wife shortly after the Oct.
22 murder of Arvidson in a faculty
member's campus home. Amos was
employed as a delivery man and
Arvidson worked part-time cleaning at
the home.
