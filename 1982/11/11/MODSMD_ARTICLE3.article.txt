Polish crackdown stifles strikes amid riots
Warsaw — Thousands of Poles shouting "Solidarity Lives" and "Down
with the Junta" battled riot police in Warsaw, Wroclaw and Nowa Huta yes
terday. But tough measures by the martial law regime apparently stymied
nationwide work stoppages called by the union's underground leaders.
A shipyard worker in Gdansk admitted there was "such panic and fear
that people worked" despite calls for sit-down strikes to protest the outlaw
ing of Solidarity. The official PAP news agency acknowledged sporadic at
tempts to slow down factories, but said "honest, efficient work" prevailed.
"This positive balance of events allows us to hope ... that martial law can
be lifted before the end of this year if political, economic and social condi
tions are still favorable," government spokesman Jerzy Urban told a news
conference.
In Washington, President Reagan accused the Polish government of "de
claring war on its own people," adding: "One can imprison protesters, club
and disperse demonstrators with tear gas or water cannons, but the specter
remains: never again will the self-appointed representatives of the workers
be able to pretend that they represent anyone but themselves.
"Our hearts go out to the brave Polish people. By struggling for freedom
and social justice against overwhelming odds, they fight for a cause all hu
manity shares with them."
An estimated 3000 Poles massed yesterday at the courthouse where Soli
darity was registered two years ago, and police in helmets and plastic shields
chased them about two miles to Warsaw University, where the demonstrat
ors dispersed under barrages of water cannon, tear gas and flares.
In Wroclaw, in southwestern Poland, an estimated 15,000 people marched
through the main square waving Solidarity banners and chanting slogans.
Police firing tear gas and water cannon broke up the crowd, but about 2000
protesters battled on as police fired stun and smoke grenades.
The demonstrators built barricades and
broke windows of the Wroclaw Hotel, and po
lice fired flares into the barricades setting them
on fire. Youths threw rocks at police, smashing
windows of cars and nearby shops.
Reagan leans to gas levy
Washington — President Reagan, who said
before the election he was opposed to a tax in
crease next year, appeared to be opening the
door yesterday to a five cent a gallon increase
in the gasoline tax to finance rebuilding of the
nation's crumbling roads, bridges and mass
transit systems.
The president said at his Sept. 28 news con
ference that no tax increase would be proposed
to reduce the deficit next year "unless there's a
palace coup and I'm overtaken or over
thrown." But yesterday White House spokes
man Larry Speakes suggested an increase in
the gasoline tax would not violate that pledge
because the gasoline tax is not a tax, but a "user
fee."
Speakes said Reagan has not decided wheth
er to ask Congress for the increase. The federal
gasoline tax is now 4 cents a gallon. Transpor
tation Secretary Drew Lewis, who also calls the
tax a user fee, has been trying for a year to sell
the president on an extra nickel a gallon to
raise $5.5 billion annually for transportation.
Reagan deferred action on the Lewis proposal
earlier this year, but it was presented to him
again yesterday at a session of the Cabinet
Council on Economic Affairs.
Democrats propose job plan
Washington — The drive for some sort of
federal jobs program picked up steam yester
day with House Democrats proposing a $4.35
billion project that would put more than
600,000 Americans to work repairing roads,
bridges and sewers and rehabilitating public
buildings.
In a direct challenge to President Reagan,
Rep. Henry Reuss (D-Wis.), who outlined the
Democratic plan at a news conference, said
most of the money for the proposal could be
provided through cuts in defense spending.
At the same time. Secretary of the Treasury
Donald Regan and Senate Finance Committee
chairman Robert Dole (R-Kan.) threw their
support behind a plan to create 300,000 jobs
with a highway-bridge repair project to be fi
nanced by a five-cent increase in the federal
gasolone tax.
This GOP proposal would be more
palatable to President Reagan than any big
spending public works program. Nevertheless,
Senate Republican leaders are considering
proposals for a jobs program that could call for
outlays of as much as $6 billion while creating
200,000 public works jobs.
The Democratic proposal as presented by
Reuss, chairman of the Joint Economic Com
mtteee, calls for:
—Spending $3.6 billion next year to enable
local governments to hire unemployed people
to work on bridge painting and repair, main
tenance of roads and bus and subway systems,

repair of public buildings and public housing,
and maintenance of sewer systems.
—Creating an American Conservation
Corps, that would spend $250 million on a one
year program to provide 20,000 year-round
and 50.000 summer jobs for youths working on
rehabilitation and conservation of public
lands.
—Spending $500 million on a long-term
program of repairing federal facilities.
In addition to outlays of $4.35 billion for
jobs, the Democrats propose to provide $2
billion in mortgage subsidies for home buyers,
$600 million in grants to stimulate construc
tion of rental housing, and $600 million in tax
credits to people who convert old buildings
into rental units.
Countdown stays on course
Cape Canaveral, Fla. — Despite the storm
that left almost 2 inches of rain on the space
shuttle's landing site at Edwards Air Force
Base in California, U.S. space agency officials
held fast yesterday to their intention of
launching Columbia at 7:19 EST this morning.
The countdown had proceeded through yes
terday without major problems. Officials
switched from the Edwards dry lake bed,
which is likely to be soggy when Columbia is
scheduled to land next Tuesday, to the base's
concrete runway, where Columbia landed on
July 4.
If everything goes as planned, the crew of
mission commander Vance Brand, 51, pilot
Robert Overmyer, 46, and mission specialists
William Lenoir, 43, and Joseph Allen, 45, will
have made at least two orbits of Earth before
most West Coast residents have even arisen.
At about 11:15 a.m. EST, after the Colum
bia is to achieve its orbit altitude of 184 miles,
the craft's path should take it within 48 miles of
the Soviet Salyut 7 space station, where two
cosmonauts have been living since May 13.
About 3 p.m. EST, the Columbia crew plans to
set out the first of two communications satel
lites carried in the shuttle's cargo hold.
With Overmyer at the controls of the Co
lumbia and Lenoir in control of the deploy
ment process, the Satellite Business Systems
No. 3 (SBS-3) spacecraft will be sprung loose.
A motor aboard the satellite is to then drive it
up to an altitude of 22,300 miles over the
Earth's equator, where its orbital motion will
be synchronized with a point on the surface. It
will thus seem stationary to anyone on the
ground.
The four astronauts spent a quiet, easy day
around the spaceport on yesterday. They
turned in at about 5 p.m. EST to get at least
eight hours of sleep before the flight.
IMF loans billions to Mexico
Washington — The International Monetary
Fund has tentatively approved a $3.8 billion
emergency loan to help Mexico meet its huge
foreign debts providing the financially trou
bled country takes strong belt-tightening steps
at home, financial sources said yesterday.
The three-year loan, subject to the formal
approval of the international lending agency's

board of directors, is the centerpiece of an aid
package stitched together by the world's lead
ing bankers to prevent the Third World's larg
est debtor from falling into default.
Knowledgeable sources, who did not want
their names used, declined to discuss details of
the domestic austerity program imposed on
Mexico in return for the loan, but they in
dicated that a major cut in domestic spending
w as one of the conditions.
IMF and Mexican officials reached a ten
tative agreement Tuesday after haggling for
months over the specific conditions, the
sources said.
The loan would be the second largest ever
extended by the IMF. The largest loan, valued
at $5.3 billion in current dollars, went to India
a year ago.
U.S. gov't quiets envoy
Washington — White House has quietly
urged the U.S. ambassador in El Salvador to
refrain from any more public criticism of hu
man rights abuses in that country for the time
being, administration officials said yesterday.
Administration officials stressed that Am
bassador Deane Hinton was in no way being
reprimanded for a speech he made last month
that startled and annoyed rightist businessmen
in El Salvador because it contained sharp
criticism of the government there. But the of
ficials, who declined to be identified, said the
word has been passed "to keep it quiet for now
because the speech got more publicity than ex
pected."
Officials said Hinton himnself had reached
the same conclusion independently and there
fore planned no further public criticism of the
Salvadoran regime.
Legislative session requested
Sacramento — A new state budget deficit es
timate of more than $1 billion Wednesday
prompted Senate Pro Tem David Roberti to
ask Gov. Edmund Brown Jr. for a special legis
lative session.
Brown's office said it received Roberti's let
ter, but no decision has been made, and there
was no immediate comment. Nor was there im
mediate comment from Assembly Speaker
Willie Brown (D-San Francisco).
The new estimate — the largest yet — came
from state Finance Director Mary
Graves. She said a shortfall of $665 million in
state revenues had already been forecast.
But in addition to that, the federal tax cut of
last July I "did not have the stimulative impact
expected," and sales gains proved to be only
temporary.
"Declining interest rates have yet to be felt in
the key housing and auto sectors. Employment
continues to slide, and the jobless rate has gone
above 10 percent.
"Uncertainty about monetary policy, the
mushrooming federal deficit, and the future
path of interest rates appear to be restraining
spending at all levels," she said.
Until this estimate of a $ 1.117 million hole in
the budget by neXt June, by Ms. Graves' esti

mate. the previous highest forecast was $982
million. The current budget is $25 billion.
Only Monday, state Controller Ken Cory
said he would have to borrow $400 million
from private sources to pay this month's bills.
He said the interest, while only about 5 per
cent. would still cost the taxpayers about $6
million.
Spy faces 35-year term
London — Soviet spy Geoffrey Prime, con
victed of espionage that caused "incalculable
harm" to Britain and its Western allies during
14 years of treachery, was sentenced yesterday
to 35 years in jail.
The 44-year-old former translator for Brit
ish intelligence was sentenced to three addi
tional years for sexual assaults on three young
girls. Police questioning about those crimes led
him to confess his guilt and his espionage ac
tivities to his wife, who informed police.
"By your treachery you have done in
calculable harm to the interests and security of
this country and the interests and security of
our friends in the (NATO) alliance," Lord
Chief Justice Lord Lane said.
Earlier this month intelligence sources said
Prime knew every monitored Soviet message
and every code broken at Britain's Govern
ment Communications Headquarters for elec
tronic intelligence-gathering in Cheltenham.
Gays may get spousal rights
San Francisco — In a move to extend un
precedented new rights to homosexual
couples, a Board of Supervisors committee has
voted to grant unmarried "domestic partners"
a series of services and benefits the city has re
served for married persons until now. The
measure seems certain to pass when it comes
up before the full board later this month.
Under Legislation approved unanimously
by the three-member committee, homosexual
or unmarried heterosexual couples may file a
statement establishing a "domestic partner
ship." They would pay a fee and establish an
official record — much as they would if they
were obtaining a marriage license.
Such couples would swear that they shared
the "common necessaries of life" — meaning
income and housing — and were each other's
"principal domestic partner." Both would at
test that they have not had a different domestic
partner within the previous six months. Either
partner later could file a "statement of termi
nation," similar to a dissolution.
