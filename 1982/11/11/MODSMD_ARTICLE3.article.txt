Polish crackdown stifles strikes amid riots
Warsaw â€” Thousands of Poles shouting "Solidarity Lives" and "Down
with the Junta" battled riot police in Warsaw, Wroclaw and Nowa Huta yes
terday. But tough measures by the martial law regime apparently stymied
nationwide work stoppages called by the union's underground leaders.
A shipyard worker in Gdansk admitted there was "such panic and fear
that people worked" despite calls for sit-down strikes to protest the outlaw
ing of Solidarity. The official PAP news agency acknowledged sporadic at
tempts to slow down factories, but said "honest, efficient work" prevailed.
"This positive balance of events allows us to hope ... that martial law can
be lifted before the end of this year if political, economic and social condi
tions are still favorable," government spokesman Jerzy Urban told a news
conference.
In Washington, President Reagan accused the Polish government of "de
claring war on its own people," adding: "One can imprison protesters, club
and disperse demonstrators with tear gas or water cannons, but the specter
remains: never again will the self-appointed representatives of the workers
be able to pretend that they represent anyone but themselves.
"Our hearts go out to the brave Polish people. By struggling for freedom
and social justice against overwhelming odds, they fight for a cause all hu
manity shares with them."
An estimated 3000 Poles massed yesterday at the courthouse where Soli
darity was registered two years ago, and police in helmets and plastic shields
chased them about two miles to Warsaw University, where the demonstrat
ors dispersed under barrages of water cannon, tear gas and flares.
In Wroclaw, in southwestern Poland, an estimated 15,000 people marched
through the main square waving Solidarity banners and chanting slogans.
Police firing tear gas and water cannon broke up the crowd, but about 2000
protesters battled on as police fired stun and smoke grenades.
