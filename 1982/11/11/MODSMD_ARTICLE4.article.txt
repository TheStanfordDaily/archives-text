# Heart transplant patient stable
## 
### 
Philip McGrath, 22, who Tuesday
sustained the second heart-lung trans
plant performed here within four days,
remained in serious but stable condi
tion yesterday, and doctors said they
plan to have him sit and stand up for a
short time today.
The operation, performed by Dr.
Stewart Jamieson of the Department of
Cardiovascular Surgery, was the ninth
heart lung procedure completed since
the University started the program
March of 1980.
But Millicent McGrath, the patient's
mother, said she and her husband Law
rence McGrath were "both kind of
flying high at this point because he
looked so fantastic." According to Mrs.
McGrath, her son was groggy but mo
tioned her to his bedside yesterday
morning to proudly show her his finger
nails and mumble "no blue."
The younger McGrath has had blue
"nail beds" since birth due to his condi
tion, known as ventricular septal defect
(VSD). Those afflicted with VSD are
born with a hole between the left and
right chambers of the heart. Though re
cent techniques have made it possible to
correct the defect in infants, that pro
cedure was unavailable to McGrath.
For a few vears, victims of the defect
can live fairlv normal lives. McGrath

was a student at Suffolk Community
College on his native Long Island until
he dropped out for medical reasons.
If left uncorrected, however, the hole
allows blood to flow between the cham
bers of the heart, causing too much
blood to flow into the lungs. After a pe
riod of years, both the heart and lungs
become damaged. Only a heart-lung
transplant can save the patient's life.
The operation was performed on
short notice. McGrath's parents did not
know a suitable donor was available
until Monday evening. "Thev haven't
had a suitable donor in five months,"
said Mrs. McGrath. "Who would have
expected another one so soon?"
According to Jamieson, there are lit
erally hundreds of people who could
benefit from the operation performed
on McGrath and, earlier this week, on
Ronald Grunden. But Jamieson said it
is so difficult to find donors that most of
these people die before a transplant op
eration is viable alternative. In addi
tion, the Stanford facility can only ac
comodate 12 heart-lung patients a vear.
McGrath said his son was very brave
while awaiting a donor. "He never
wavered." said the father. " He had a
verv firm committment all the way."

McGrath has been here with his son for
two months. His wife arrived two weeks
ago when the older McGrath children
chipped in to buy his wife a plane ticket
as a birthday present.
Several of the nine heart-lung trans
plants, and many of the 244 heart-only
transplants performed at the Univer
sity, have returned to active, even ath
letic lives. Though Jamieson is pleased
with the outcome of the two latest
transplants, he stressed that recovery is
a life-long process.
McGrath and Grunden will have to
take medication for the rest of their
lives to resist rejection of the trans
planted tissue.
The discovery of Cyclosporin (for
merly called Cvclosporine A) was the
impetus that allowed the heart-lung
procedure to be revived last year after a
hiatus of i I vears.
The new drug overcomes problems
which caused the three earlier attempts
in New York, South Africa and Texas
to result in failure. Cyclosporin, used
on both heart and heart-lung patients
since December 1980, is more effective
than other immunosupressants at fight
ing rejection while minimizing the pos
sibility of infection. It also allows the
windpipe to heal and the lungs to func
tion.
