# Engineers analyze dorm walls
## 
### KRISTEN CHRISTOPHER Senior staff writer 
Residents of room 104 in Trancos
house have been inconvenienced since
last Wednesday when University main
tenance removed part of their bowed
wall in an attempt to pinpoint the cause
of its curvature.
However, a study of the inside of the
wall simply reconfirmed earlier con
clusions about the reason for the bend
ing, according to Charles Uhrhammer,
a Palo Alto structural engineer who
sent a report of his analysis to the Uni
versity on Monday.
"The deflection has been caused by
movement of the (foundation) slabs,
which is to be expected," Uhrhammer
said. That same explanation was pro
vided bv another Palo Alto structural
engineer, Robert Matheu, who in
spected the dorm on Friday, Oct. 29
several hours after it was evacuated be
cause residents noticed cracking and
bending of the walls.
According to Robert Mibach, man
ager of facilities and services for resi
dence halls, a section of the wall's con
crete covering was removed "because
we wanted to actually look at how the
pencil metal studs were put together."
The studs are thin pieces of twisted
metal which run vertically inside the
walls at approximately two-foot in
tervals. One was removed so that it
could be closely studied.
Since bending of the studs in several
rooms of Trancos has caused the walls
to bow, Mibach said the University de
cided that looking at them might give a
more accurate explanation for the
structural changes.
Although he has not seen Uhrharn
mer's report, Mibach said he is not sur
prised that it did not provide a new ex
planation.
Raul Lopez-Guerra, a resident of
room 104, said that seeing the bent
metal studs has made him more worried
about the safety of the building.
"There's no way to look at it and not
think there's something wrong."
Larry Weiss, Lopez-Guerra's room
mate, said that some of the many engi
neers who have visited their room dur
ing the last week have asked if anyone
bent the studs because they were sur
prised at the extent of the damage.
Lopez-Guerra said that after the
wall's concrete was removed, he moved
his bed so that itsend rather than entire
length was placed against the wall.
However, he moved the bed to the
middle of the room on Sunday momine
alter he wasawakened at 5 a.m. bv what
he referred toas"tappingsounds"com
ing from the wall.
"It scared me because it was like
somebody was in there," Lopez-Guerra
said. He described himself as someone
who does not wake up even when loud
music is turned on, and said that there
fore he woke up Weiss because "I
wanted to make sure I wasn't hallu
cinating."
Weiss said that "since then we've
been living with like half a room."
"What bothers me is the fact that
they (the University) took it for granted
that they could do anything they
wanted to," Lopez-Guerra said.
He said he was awakened by several
engineers last Wednesday inquiring if it
would be alright for a small portion of
the wall to be removed.
