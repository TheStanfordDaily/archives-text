# Budget battles looming; partisan standoff ahead

Compiled from news reports and wire services
The battle of the budget is taking shape as
House Democrats prepare to press for legisla
tion to create jobs in the special post-election
session of Congress. The session was principally
called to provide needed appropriations to keep
the government going after the start of the fiscal
year on October I. But the Democrats have
seized the initiative to push for a multibillion
dollar jobs program before the next Congress
convenes in Januarv.
"The lame-duck session will be a down
payment on our election mandate. We're sup
posed to do something, and do it fairly quickly,"
an aide to the House Democratic leadership
commented.
The Democrats announced on Tuesday that
they will press for legislation to provide funds
for public service jobs for the rebuilding of high
ways, bridges, sewer systems and other facilities
that are in disrepair. Congressional sources say
that Rep. Henry Reuss(D-Wis.)chairmanofthe
congressional Joint Economic Committee, has
drawn up a set of recommendations to put
600.000 people to work, provide housing sub
sidies, and modify next year's income tax cut.
Concerned that unemployment, which has
reached 10.4 percent of the work force, could be
come a Democratic issue, Senate Republicans
are working on a proposal of their own to create
200,000 jobs. Unlike the Democratic proposal,
which would be based on an area's unemploy
ment rate, the Republican proposal will provide
funds on the basis of those public facilities in
greatest need of repair. The Republican pro
posal also differs from the Democratic one in re
lying on a 5-cent gasoline tax for funding. The
Democrats are calling for cuts in military spend
ing to fund their proposal.
The Democratic proposal, which was dis
cussed in a closed session on Tuesday, calls for a
$3.5 billion package of public service jobs. The
jobs would go to people unemployed for at least
15 weeks of the past 26 weeks, as of the time the
measure would take effect. The bill would also
include $2 billion to subsidize moderate- priced
housing, similar to a $3 billion item in an emer
gency spending bill that Reagan vetoed earlier
this year as too-costly. An additional 51.2 billion
would be provided for housing rental assistance
and mortgage subsidies for inexpensive housing.
The plan also recommends that a $700 limit be

placed on the tax break that could be gained
from the 10 percent personal income tax rate cut
scheduled for next July 1.
Reagan is said to be cool to all of these sugges
tions. Deputy White House Press Secretary
Larry Speakes warned that the president still op
poses "make-work, dead-end programs." Sen
ate Republicans are thus concerned that they
may be heading on a collision course with the
White House.
But there is general agreement in Congress
that the message of last week's election was that

people want something done about the high un
employment rates. Both White House and con
gressional sources are now talking about forging
a new bipartisan coalition to cooperate on
budget matters. In that conciliatory vein, an aide
to the Senate Republican leadership commented
that "we don't think that the Senate is in a posi
tion to turn down a jobs bill if the House sends
one over here."
Many leaders are now saying that the Reagan
administration will have to compromise either
on its opposition to raising taxes or to cutting de
fense spending. Reagan is reviewing budget pro
posals this week with members of the Cabinet in
order to try to come to terms with a budget defi
cit for 1984 now being estimated at $200 billion.
