## Squaring off: tough choices ahead for Social Security Social Security ills Debate continues over system cures 
### 
Compiled from news reports and wire services
Adding existing federal revenues to Social
Security and offering older workers tax cred
its for postponing retirement may be one way
of remedying the system, according to House
Majority Leader Jim Wright.
Instead of slowing the current cost
of-living increases for Social Security reci
pients, he suggested in a television interview
Sunday that the troubled trust funds be
bolstered with other federal revenues from
offshore oil and an increase in the distilled al
cohol tax.
The Interior Department predicted $18
billion in revenue from the sale of offshore oil
drilling leases in fiscal year 1982, but is ex
pected to end up with several billion less when
actual sales are totaled. In 4 the adminis

tration's budget proposals in revenues from
the alcohol excise tax, about $6 billion was
projected.
Wright's comments come during a time of
much debate between the parties; the old-age
trust fund runs out of money this month and
Congress needs to get going on alternative
funding sources. Already it has had to borrow
$600 million from the disability fund to cover
$13.2 billion of benefit checks issued this
month. The program may be up to $200
billion short of the amount it needs to pay
benefits on time during this decade.
The issues will be discussed today as the
bipartisan National Commission on Social
Security Reform enters a marathon session to
come up with recommendationsto Congress
and President Reagan.
Chaired bv economist Alan Greenspan, the
Commission hopes to find a common ground
among the seven congressional members in
an effort to gain broad support from both
parties. The proposal package to keep Social
Security afloat and effective must be backed
by substantial numbers of both Republicans
and Democrats, in order to prevent a time
consuming face-off in Congress.
Meanwhile, the debate goes on among in
dividual members. In response to Wright's
suggestion to fund Social Security through
offshore oil lease sales revenues or through an
excise tax increase on spirits, Democratic
aides claimed that such practices would mean
tapping the general Treasury revenues.
The problem stems from the fact that the
old-age trust fund has been paying out more

than it has been taking in for the last several
years; to pour more money into it from gener
al Treasury revenues would increase expen
diture on the social program and hence drain
the system.
In economic terms, inflation has increased
benefits while recession has kept payroll tax
revenues down. Politically speaking, Con
gress has gone ahead with generous benefit
increases without providing adequate means
of paying them.
At present, Social Security is funded solely
bv the payroll tax, which is under the juris
diction of the House Ways and Means Com
mittee. Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.)
expressed a willingness to consider loans, but
not grants from the Treasury to Social Secur
ity.
"If I were going to entertain something, i{
would only be to borrow," Rostenkowskr
said in an interview conducted by The New
York Times. "The idea of general
means a means test ultimately. The last thing
I want to do is put the senior citizen of this
country in a position where he has to divorce
himself from other income to get Social Se
curity. I don't see a lot of of popularity for it
on mv committee."
Although Wright opposes fiddling with
payroll taxes and cost-of-living increases,
those ideas are actually the most Common
measures recommended to tackle the cast!"
crisis in Social Security.
