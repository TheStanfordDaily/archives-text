# The 						Review adopts new format
## 
### KATHY OLMSTED 
A newly revamped conservative newspaper
here is attempting to influence what staff mem
bers see as the liberal bias on campus — and it's
attracting considerable attention in the process.
Since The Stanford Review has been re-re
leased in a shorter format this fall, it has ex
perienced climbing circulation, greater fundrais
ing possibilities and national exposure.
According to staff members, the Review is de
signed to provide a voice for the large number of
conservatives on campus.
"I think there are a lot more conservatives
here than conservative activism would in-'
dicate," said Lew Davies, a member of the steer
ing committee of the Stanford Conservative Po
litical Alliance (SCPA), which publishes the Re
view. "There really has been no conservative
voice on campus," he said.
"It's not quite 'in' to be conservative," agreed
Tim Hanigan, a Review writer and SCPA mem
ber. The paper is designed to change this stigma
by providing a legitimate print outlet for conser
vative views.
Unlike most campus publications, the Review
receives no money from the Publications Board.
Instead, it is financed entirely by private dona
tions.
None of the SCPA members contacted would
specifically name the sources of the group's
$21,000 annual budget, about half of which is
spent on the Review. Hanigan said the SCPA so
licited funds from University alumni, Fortune
500 corporations and educational foundations.
The Review is now in the midst of a major fun
draising drive which was started earlier this fall.
Davies said he hopes the fundraising drive
would be helped by the exposure the paper re
ceived in a recent article in Time magazine,
which cited the Review as an example of the
"conservative upsurge" in journalism on cam
puses across the nation. But Davies said he did
not consider the Time piece to be a "positive arti
cle bv any means."

SCPA steering committee
member David Eisner said the
Review attempts to provide a
'larger forum of ideas on
campus* to counter the liberal
bias exhibited by the campus
press, the University
administration and the theme
house system.

The Time correspondent gave the Review
some names of foundations known to contribute
to conservative student publications, Hanigan
said. The Review is particularly interested in con
tacting the Institute for Educational Affairs, a
foundation mentioned in the article as having a
conservative reputation.
' According to Davies, the national exposure
'has helped the Review attract the attention here
that it lacked before.
"It (the Time article) will probably make peo
ple take us as a more credible group," he said.

adding that the SCPA members got "absolutely
no response" before the article came out. More
attention is evidently to come: a reporter from
the Christian Science Monitor talked to some Re
view staff members last week.
The article in Time suggested that the Review
is part of a nationwide trend towards conserva
tive campus publications. But the staff members
of the Review here tried to distance themselves
from other college papers, especially the con
troversial Dartmouth Review. SCPA members
have been in touch with other conservative pub
lications but "haven't asked them for help or
recommendations," Davies said. Some of the
Dartmouth practices, such as the listing the
names of the members of the gay student or
ganization there, were in poor taste, he said.

7 think there are a lot more
conservatives here than
conservative activism would
indicate... there really has
been no conservative voice on
campus.'

Bill Sneed, a SCPA steering committee mem
ber and the editor of the last issue of the Review,
agreed that the Review has no plans to follow in
the footsteps of the Dartmouth paper.
" The Dartmouth Review made a few mistakes
in my opinion," he said, adding that the paper's
"caustic, sarcastic" style would not be emulated
here.
The SCPA has actually had a publication
since the spring of 1981, but that paper was pub
lished in once a quarter in a journal format and
was called the Stanford Conservative Review. The
present version of the Review has steadily in
creased its circulation since dropping the word
"conservative" from its title and instituting a
shorter, bi-weekly format this fall. Sneed said
the SCPA printed 1000 copies of the first issue,
3000 copies of the second and is expecting to
publish 5000 copies of the edition to be released
on Tuesday.
The Review staff members feel that their paper
fills an important need on campus. SCPA steer
ing committee member David Eisner said the
Review attempts to provide a "larger forum of
ideas on campus" to counter the liberal bias ex
hibited in the campus press, the University ad
ministration and the theme house system.
Sneed agreed that students here are routinely
"bombarded" with liberal ideas from the Daily,
the feminist paper Aurora and the black paper
the Real News, and thus conservative students
need a forum to express their views. He pointed
out that the Review's story on the misuse of
work-study funds by the Stanford Progressive
Alliance was neglected by the Daily.
"No one covered that — we had to," he said.
The Review's purpose is more to "stimulate dis
cussion" on campus rather than to be an ex
clusively conservative publication, he added.
Hanigan said that the SCPA members prac
tice a type of "intellectual conservatism."
"We have taken a conservative stance, and we
base this stance on intellect," he said.
