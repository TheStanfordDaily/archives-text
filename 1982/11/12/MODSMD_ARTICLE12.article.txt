# The 						aero-hydrodynamic way to sail
## 
### MARY CATHERINE FISH Staff writer 
The sailboat is actually a com
bination of hydrofoil and aero
foil — a hybrid of ship and air
plane, Polish emigre and leading
sailing authority C.A. Marchaj
said last week here in a lecture on
the aero-hydrodynamics of sail
ing.
Marchaj, a visiting research
fellow at the University of South
ampton in England, is the author
of what is often termed the "bible
of sailing" — Sailing Theory and
Practice.
Marchaj cited three "basic
strategy factors" for faster
yachts: hull efficiency, sail effi
ciency and a computerized
targeting system.
Marchaj applied his sailing ex
pertise to the British effort to try
to design a craft that could win
the America's Cup race. This ef
fort was limited'by the regu
lations of the race, he said. One of

these requires triangular sails,
which Marchaj described as the
worst possible design because of
drag components that are in
volved.
After the lecture, Marchaj in
dicated that his work in now tak
ing new directions. He said, "I
believe I perhaps over-valued . ..
how to make a boat faster . ..
Now I am working on, rather,
what should be done in order to
make a boat safer . . . The speed
performance is very frequently in
a kind of contradiction with
seaworthiness."
Currently, Marchaj is working
for an American corporation
which is trying to develop new
kinds of commercial boats. His
work involves the possibility of
using sails to drive fishing boats
and commercial vessels.
He wouldn't say more about
his newest ideas because many of
them have patents pending. He
did, however, pique some

curiosity by adding, "1 managed
to produce something which is
better than anything so far de
veloped for this purpose."
Although Marchaj lives in
England, he is originally from
Poland. In an interview, he
talked about his different ex
periences. During World War 11,
he was attached to Polish in
telligence agencies fighting
against the Nazis. He was ar
rested by the Gestapo, but es
caped on his way to a concentra
tion camp. He survived and con
tinued to fight for the Polish
"Home Army-'
After the war, he ran into more
trouble. "When Communists
came to Poland, 1 was arrested
for the second time," he said. "As
a matter of fact, I was arrested
eight times in my life. This time as
an 'enemy of the people' I was
kept in prison for two years. I was
persecuted many times and final
ly I managed to find asylum in

Britain."
During his time in Poland
catches of fish were consistently,
confiscated, thus his interests
turned to racing and the theory
involved in making fast boats. In
fact, he was six-time sailing
champion of Poland in the Finri
class. S
"However," he said, "I was
not allowed to go abroad to repi
resent Poland, except Hungary
on one occasion. I could compete
in international regattas, buj
only in Poland." J
Then what he called "peculiar
circumstances" resulted in his
seeking asylum in Britain. "I waj
representing Europe, East Eu t *-
rope, for about 12 years in the
ternational Yacht-Racing
Union," he said. "I was de
liberately framed by the Com
munist regime in order to be
forced to become a kind of secrei
agent in the West. I refused and
asked for political asylum." i
