# I-Center strives to find homes for foreign grad students

### IRIS MASSION 
Each year, the shortage of on-campus
housing causes problems for graduate stu
dents and particularly for foreign graduate
students at Stanford. In order to aid interna
tional students in their search for housing, a
group of volunteers from the Bechtel Interna
tional Center have joined forces with the
Community Committee for International
Students (CCIS), a Mid-Peninsula organiza
tion which provides various new student ser
vices, instruction in English, family programs
and opportunities for community interaction
to foreign students.
The Housing Bureau is one of the services
the CCIS, and International Center volun
teers have collaborated specifically to give
personalized attention to Stanford's foreign
graduate students lacking University hous
ing. The Housing Bureau's services include
making community contacts, looking for off
campus rooms and apartments and acting as
liaisons between foreign students and land
lords. Lee Zeigler, director of the Interna
tional Center, stated that of 275 foreign grad
uate students from 65 countries, 107 rental
lists had filled through Bechtel's Housing Bu
reau.
The Housing Bureau's task was particular

ly difficult due to the change in the graduate
housing lottery. The new system consists of
an initial housing draw in Mav in which new
graduate students have priority. Housing as
signments made to graduate students without
children are limited to one academic year; as
signments made to married graduate students
with children are limited to four vears.
The initiation of the new housing system
meant that all graduate students had to draw
for on-campus housing last May, and wait
lists were compiled for subsequent drawings
as space allowed. Students with low draws
were asked to move out of their residences
and told to make off-campus housing ar
rangements. The previous housing system al
lowed graduate students to remain in their
housing assignments until graduation.
The availability of on-campus graduate
housing is further restricted to four resi
dences: Crothers, Crothers Memorial, Escon
dido Village and Mirrielees Apartments.
Crothers gives preference to law students and
Crothers Memorial to engineering students.
Escondido Village is the only residence on
campus for married graduate students with
children.
What housing officials did not expect,
however, was that thev had beep overly con

servative in their estimates of on-campus
graduate student housing.
"More spaces opened up later (after the
housing assignments had been made) and
those graduate students who were on waitr
lists had been told to seek off-campus hous' r
ing," said Zeigler. He added that he thought
the greater vacancy rate was probably caused
by the new one-year guarantee for single
graduate student housing. Many students
opted to make independent housing arranges
ments, which were more practical and per
manent than participating in the University's
lottery each year.
"By the time the University opened up the
extra housing (immediately prior to the start
of fall quarter), some people had already
made irrevocable off-campus housing corri
mitments," Zeigler said. J
Residential Education has undertaken ap
investigation into the reasons that causefi
such a hign number of vacancies. Committees
have been formed to determine why students
dropped off the wait-lists and to ascertain the
demand for future graduate housing.

"Next year, we expect less of a crunch for
graduate housing because the new system will
have ironed itself out," concluded Zeigler. !
