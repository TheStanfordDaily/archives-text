## The 						Stanford Daily Reasonable use of open space 
### 
If you're like us, or if you were like us when you
were younger, you spent a lot of your time growing
up in Downtown Suburbia playing in vacant lots.
Sure, the school playground had swings and jungle
gyms, and your parents didn't want you hanging
around on undeveloped land, but the acre or so of
wilderness down the block offered a small haven for
those who preferred the simple pleasures of dirt to
asphalt.
But the interests of the community had to be
filled, and eventually the vacant lot gave way to a
house, or an office park, or a gas station. And you
understood the reasons why, but still wished that
there could be some way to preserve the open space.
Not that the wishing changed anything, of course.
We're all older now, but vacant lots are still
around, and people are still wishing for open space.
In the latest example around these parts, the vacant
lot is called Stanford West, and it's the city of Palo
Alto that wants the lot to remain vacant.
The University is currently planning to build
1400 to 1600 units of housing in the Stanford West
area in the near future. In doing so, the adminis
tration is doing what it can to alleviate housing
shortages for faculty and graduate students who
succumb to the University's attractive enticements
and decide to come here, only to find housing costs
more in keeping with El Dorado than Downtown
Suburbia. It's an admirable effort; more and better
(and cheaper) housing is vital to a university justifi
ably concerned with the quality of its teaching. The
development of Stanford West is both in keeping
with the hard economic facts of academic recruiting
and a welcome show of support for teaching by the
University.
But Palo Alto, or rather the more vocal residents
of the city, doesn't see things so easily. They argue

that developing housing for 2800 to 3800 faculty
members and graduate students would pose "insur
mountable" traffic problems for Palo Alto. In addi
tion, they say that the University's plan to sur
mount the traffic problem (bv extension of Willow
Road) would threaten the ecological balance and
destroy the natural beautv of San Francisquito
Creek.
We're not so sure about that last part. Have you
taken a look at San Francisquito Creek recently?
It's not Yosemite. What is important about the area
to Palo Alto residents is that it remains open — not
for any particular reason, mind you, just that it re
mains open.
That attitude of blind preservation is a little an
noying to us. Of course, we'd prefer conservation of
space and resources to unnecessary expansion —
you'd be hard pressed to find someone who doesn't,
short of the Department of the Interior. But the
University's past responsible conduct in planning
and development leads one to trust its decisions —
especially in comparison with some of its neigh
bors.
Palo Alto is fairly notorious in the Santa Clara
Valley area in that it actively seeks the involvement
of "clean" industry (such as universities and Silicon
Valley firms) and reaps the benefits, but leaves it to
Menlo Park and Mountain View to absorb the so
cial costs of such expansion. Perhaps it shouldn't be
Palo Alto's time to put aside childish things like va
cant lots; after all, it is certainly time for the Univer
sity to attend to people's fears for open space by
more clearly delineating its space use policy. How
ever, in the case of Stanford West, wishing for open
space won't put a roof over anyone's head, and that
is what is needed now.
