## U.S. foreign policy victimized Beirut

In 1967 Israel appeared to be a small
nation about to be destroyed by pow
erful neighbors. Since then the United
States has provided Israel with billions
of dollars in armament. Israel now has
more tanks than Britain and France
combined and an air force exceeded in
size only by the air fleets of the two su
perpowers. Thus, a large, conservative
force of professional soldiers has been

and it fosters the illusion that there are
military solutions to all international
problems.
Defense Minister Ariel Sharon com
mands the Israeli military. In past wars,
as a field officer, he ignored the orders
of his superiors. For such acts he was
dubbed "King of Israel." In August
1981 Sharon was made minister of de
fense even though he said he wanted to
invade Lebanon. He ordered a massive
military build-up along the Lebanese
border and then waited for a pretext for
launching an invasion. No powerin the
Mideast can stop the Israeli forces. Yet
when they entered Lebanon they sys
tematically destroyed cities and civil
ians. Week after week Sharon expanded
the objectives of the invasion.
He attempted to cover up the extent

of the devastation. The army chief-of
staff instructed his officers to "fight for
an enlarged Israel." This unnecessary
war was a callous attempt to destroy the
Palestinian people; it was launched by
Jews whose history shows that people
cannot be destroyed by war.
In a Cold War era, the stability of a
country has been equated with military
strength to fend off communism. The

the United States has created a military
caste which takes the law into its own
hands. The invasion of Lebanon shows
that cancerous military growth has
changed Israel. The military not only
disdains civilian control, but arrogantly
claims that "military victory will coun

terbalance the failures and inade
quacies of the Begin government."
Religion has been the banner of in
vaders of the Mideast. The "true" re
ligion of invaders made the indigenous
people a sub-human race. But in the Is
raeli Army many of the troops are in
digenous people who treat Arabs as
equals. Sharon and most of his officers
are descendents of European Jews. In
Beirut the officers ordered their troops
not to interfere with the massacre. The
revulsion of Israeli citizens led to an in
vestigation that is focusing attention on
other violations of international law
that were condoned by Israeli officers.
What right did they have to create the
mercenary army of Major Haddad in
southern Lebanon?
In a search for "strategic advantage,"
the United States has given Israel ex
cessive military power. We are con
fronted with the hard facts of our com
plicity in what has happened. The Unit-

Ed States is responsible for the havoc
wrought by wanton export of military
"aid." Military power will not bring
peace or stability to the Mideast.
