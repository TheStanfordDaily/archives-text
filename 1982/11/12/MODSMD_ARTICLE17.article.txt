## Libertarian movement stresses individual liberty 
### 
I am not an expert on Libertarianism
and I did not hear Dan Dougherty
speak, but allow me to express my dis
may at the Daily's Nov. 5 editorial,
"Beware the Libertarian Dream." This
editorial suffered from a weak, super
ficial appraisal of the Libertarian alter
native and a cheap appeal to petty prej
udice in describing Libertarians.
I am well aware of the limiting factors
that exert a negative influence on edito
rial presentations. You do not have
enough space to explain every detail
and nuance of your argument. The Dai
ly however, failed to present any part of
an argument in refuting Libertarian
positions. It simply presented random
Libertarian proposals and dismissed
them as simplistic, ignorant and ridicu
lous. It never explained why their pro
posals are such. Why are cuts of $5
billion in the California budget anar
chistic and ignorant? Is it so obvious
that it needs no explanation? Apparent
ly so. Why arc the cuts in funding to
public education so reprehensible? You
claim such a proposal is irresponsible
and anti-intellectual, but you do not ex
plain why. Time and time again you re
tort to name-calling instead of argu
ment-exploding while attacking the
Libertarian position.
I hope the Daily chooses to run an
other editorial on Libertarianism. Next
time, however, I wish you would spend
a little time legitimately discussing
Ideas. Here arc a few you might want to
analyze;
•A government's only legitimate

purpose is to maximize and guarantee
individual freedom, not collective hap
piness.
•Any form of personal taxation is an as
sault on individual freedom and thus
unconstitutional.
•If the most just form of government
also happens to lead to the most human
misery, should that form of government
be rejected in favor of a less just, less mi
serable system?

Fraternity article
The article on fraternity life (Daily,
Nov. 9) at Stanford misrepresented and
perverted many beliefs which are very
important to me. This response is an at
tempt to clarify my position as IFC
president, as well as my personal be
liefs.
To begin with, I was misquoted. The
article claims that I said, "There are
stereotypes out there to be had ~.
propagated bv stupid people." This is
not what I said nor have I ever made
such an assertion. I do believe, how
ever, that the stereotypes of fraternities
at Stanford which do exist result from
lack of information about the
fraternities and the fraternity system.
Currently the IFC is planning projects
which will increase the amount of in
formation that will be made available to
the Stanford community.
The article states that I blame people

who come into Stanford with stere
otypical views of fraternities. It did not
say what I blame them for but apparent
ly it is because they perpetuate such
views. It would be foolish for me to
blame people for not having full knowl
edge of the Stanford fraternities before
they are even introduced to the system.
I do not blame such people. Instead, my
point was simply that I feel people come
to college with preconceptions abut
fraternity life. I know, and admitted in
the article that I did. The important
point is that such notions will not
change unless information is made
available to people and those persons
choose to evaluate such information
objectively.
The article correctly related my belief
that fraternities at Stanford become as
sociated with a party image because
they gain most of their recognition and
are most commonly associated with the
promotion of parties. Unfortunately,
the article sserted that I didn't believe
that this was, "the sort of image one
wishes to perpetuate." This is incorrect.
What I wanted to communicate was the
fact that fraternities not only provide
social activities, but also offer other
benefits to the Stanford community.
Finally, I was hurt by the statement
concerning my own fraternity. Again
the reporter did not understand the
point I was trying to make. I know that
all the members of Phi Kappa Psi know
that I am proud of them and our
fraternity, and that I did not join be
cause it had a "low profile."

There are further points of dispute,
but it should be obvious that a re
porter's own bias can fundamentally
pervert beliefs which are central to an
individual. I would only ask that the
Daily and its writers be more aware of
this potential in the future.

Cloning patent
The article, "University Reapplying
for Cloning Patent" (Daily, Nov. 8),
may have have been confusing to those
who have been following the progress
of the negotiations with the Patent Of
fice. I would like to correct and clarify a
few specific points:
First, it is important to note that 15
percent of the royalty income goes
directly to Stanford for the costs of ad
ministering the license. After payment
of direct expenses, the remaining funds
are divided evenly be'tween Stanford
and the University of California. Each
university then distributes its share ac
cording to its patent policy.
Second, the pending application cov
ers the products of the DNA cloning
technique; a patent was issued Decem
ber 2, 1980, on the technique itself. At
this time, we are not technically "reap
plying" for a cloning patent, we are
merely responding to a routine Patent
Office rejection notice.

I am not an expert on Libertarianism
and I did not hear Dan Dougherty
speak, but allow me to express my dis
may at the Daily's Nov. 5 editorial,
"Beware the Libertarian Dream." This
editorial suffered from a weak, super
ficial appraisal of the Libertarian alter
native and a cheap appeal to petty prej
udice in describing Libertarians.
I am well aware of the limiting factors
that exert a negative influence on edito
rial presentations. You do not have
enough space to explain every detail
and nuance of your argument. The Dai
ly however, failed to present any part of
an argument in refuting Libertarian
positions. It simply presented random
Libertarian proposals and dismissed
them as simplistic, ignorant and ridicu
lous. It never explained why their pro
posals are such. Why are cuts of $5
billion in the California budget anar
chistic and ignorant? Is it so obvious
that it needs no explanation? Apparent
ly so. Why arc the cuts in funding to
public education so reprehensible? You
claim such a proposal is irresponsible
and anti-intellectual, but you do not ex
plain why. Time and time again you re
tort to name-calling instead of argu
ment-exploding while attacking the
Libertarian position.
I hope the Daily chooses to run an
other editorial on Libertarianism. Next
time, however, I wish you would spend
a little time legitimately discussing
Ideas. Here arc a few you might want to
analyze;
•A government's only legitimate

purpose is to maximize and guarantee
individual freedom, not collective hap
piness.
•Any form of personal taxation is an as
sault on individual freedom and thus
unconstitutional.
•If the most just form of government
also happens to lead to the most human
misery, should that form of government
be rejected in favor of a less just, less mi
serable system?

Fraternity article
The article on fraternity life (Daily,
Nov. 9) at Stanford misrepresented and
perverted many beliefs which are very
important to me. This response is an at
tempt to clarify my position as IFC
president, as well as my personal be
liefs.
To begin with, I was misquoted. The
article claims that I said, "There are
stereotypes out there to be had ~.
propagated bv stupid people." This is
not what I said nor have I ever made
such an assertion. I do believe, how
ever, that the stereotypes of fraternities
at Stanford which do exist result from
lack of information about the
fraternities and the fraternity system.
Currently the IFC is planning projects
which will increase the amount of in
formation that will be made available to
the Stanford community.
The article states that I blame people

who come into Stanford with stere
otypical views of fraternities. It did not
say what I blame them for but apparent
ly it is because they perpetuate such
views. It would be foolish for me to
blame people for not having full knowl
edge of the Stanford fraternities before
they are even introduced to the system.
I do not blame such people. Instead, my
point was simply that I feel people come
to college with preconceptions abut
fraternity life. I know, and admitted in
the article that I did. The important
point is that such notions will not
change unless information is made
available to people and those persons
choose to evaluate such information
objectively.
The article correctly related my belief
that fraternities at Stanford become as
sociated with a party image because
they gain most of their recognition and
are most commonly associated with the
promotion of parties. Unfortunately,
the article sserted that I didn't believe
that this was, "the sort of image one
wishes to perpetuate." This is incorrect.
What I wanted to communicate was the
fact that fraternities not only provide
social activities, but also offer other
benefits to the Stanford community.
Finally, I was hurt by the statement
concerning my own fraternity. Again
the reporter did not understand the
point I was trying to make. I know that
all the members of Phi Kappa Psi know
that I am proud of them and our
fraternity, and that I did not join be
cause it had a "low profile."

There are further points of dispute,
but it should be obvious that a re
porter's own bias can fundamentally
pervert beliefs which are central to an
individual. I would only ask that the
Daily and its writers be more aware of
this potential in the future.

Cloning patent
The article, "University Reapplying
for Cloning Patent" (Daily, Nov. 8),
may have have been confusing to those
who have been following the progress
of the negotiations with the Patent Of
fice. I would like to correct and clarify a
few specific points:
First, it is important to note that 15
percent of the royalty income goes
directly to Stanford for the costs of ad
ministering the license. After payment
of direct expenses, the remaining funds
are divided evenly be'tween Stanford
and the University of California. Each
university then distributes its share ac
cording to its patent policy.
Second, the pending application cov
ers the products of the DNA cloning
technique; a patent was issued Decem
ber 2, 1980, on the technique itself. At
this time, we are not technically "reap
