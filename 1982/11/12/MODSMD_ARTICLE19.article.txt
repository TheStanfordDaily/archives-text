## Electoral politics lead to stagnation 
### 
The great election of 1982 is over and,
just like every other election in our 206-
year history, almost forgotten. On Nov.
2, a small percentage of those citizens
endowed by our "democracy" with the
right to vote cast their ballots, hoping to
make their voices heard among the din
raised by the diverse factions of this
enormous country. What, if anything,
did they hope to accomplish? On what
basis did they choose how to vote, or
even whether or not to vote at all?
My ears are perennially glued to the
political grapevine. Here in California I
have heard strong opinions expressed
on issues varying from gun control to
the bottle bill to the nuclear freeze; from
Gov. Brown to Tom Bradley, and even
occassionally bv implication to Presi-

A new world is in the making. We have had enough
of liberal democratic capitalism: we know what it
promises and what it delivers. As a race we now
have the choice to move on to the post-liberal age,
to a world where man *s activity is dominated by the
desire to fulfill human wishes and improve the
quality of life, rather than by the need to make
money.

dent Reagan. I have been involved in
heated discussions, quiet talks and des
peration. For despite what we say and
how we vote, our democratic choice is
really quite limited. The government,
much like an automobile, tends to run
in the same fashion regardless of what
brand of gasoline or politician we fill it
with.
This is not to say that one adminis
tration is precisely like another. A Con
gress controlled by the Democratic Par
ty might well spend 10 or 15 percent less
on defense; say perhaps, 1.4 rather than
1.5 trillion dollars over the next five
years. The balance between inflation
and unemployment inherent in our
chaotic economy might well be tipped
in the opposite direction by a per
centage point or two. Foreign policy
might wear the guise of the ideology of
human rights, but on a day-to-day
basis, little but the rhetoric would be
likely to change.

Is it any wonder, then, that dis
illusionment with the electoral system is
epidemic in the United States? The
Marxists of the 19th century considered
voting the "opiate of the masses" —
that is not precisely the case, for the
masses soon build up tolerance and find
that the opium holds little hope of re
lieving their suffering. The unemployed
know full well that Reaganomics has
made their situation worse; however,
they are equally disillusioned with a
Democratic Party unable to propose ra
tional alternatives. The black people of
the South are cognizant of the ir
reparable social and psychological
damage inflicted upon them by racism,
yet George Wallace is re-elected gov
ernor of Alabama. The self-destructive

tendencies of the electorate are full
proof that when it comes to American
electoral politics, it really doesn't mat
ter who wins. The difference is only a
quantitative one, a difference in the
degree to which most of the nation will
he subjugated to the wishes of those tru
ly in power, far beyond the halls of Con
gress.
The theory of electoral politics is
much like that of Adam Smith's free
market economics — the conflict of op
posing interests is supposed to produce
efficiency in production, just as the de
sire of the political consumer should
eventually be satisfied by aligning with
the act : ">ns of their representatives. If
the consumer does not like one product,
he buys another; if he does not like one
politician, he is just as free to vote for
another.
The problem with these theories of
opposing forces is that on an empirical
level, they simply do not operate as

Smith predicted. Rather than pres
enting the consumer with a wide range
of choices, most economic entities and
political organizations have moved
toward the center of the road, resulting
in effective monopolies which usurp the
freedom of consumer choice upon
which the theory is based. On a more
theoretical level, it seems self-evident
that in human society order does not
arise from chaos; that is, one cannot
hope to produce a just and harmonious
society with unjust means or by the
more or less violent conflict of opposing
forces.
A new world is in the making. We
have had enough of liberal democratic
capitalism: we know what it promises
and what it delivers. As a race we now
have the choice to move on to the post
liberal age, to a world where man's ac
tivity is dominated by the desire to
fulfill human wishes and improve the
quality of life, rather than by the need to
make money. Electoral politics will not
bring an end to the nuclear arms race,
perhaps the most visible manifestation
of the absurdity of our world. The mot}-

ey spent on bombs will not go toward
helping to feed the starving masses until
we assert our will, by reshaping the
world in the way we see fit. Electoral
politics is not the way; it promise?
change and delivers stagnation. It ap
pears that the American public is pain*
fully cognizant of that fact.
