# Soviet Union after Brezhnev
## Local experts' predictions differ 
### KRISTEN CHRISTOPHER Senior staff writer 
Soviet experts here agree that it is
nearly impossible to predict who will
succeed Leonid Brezhnev as Soviet
president, but they differ in their opin
ions of how his death .will affect lhat
country's policies.
Brezhnev, 75, died Wednesday of an
apparent heart attack. He had been
leader of the Soviet Union's Com
munist Party — the country's most
powerful position — for 18 years. In
1977, he also took over as head of state,
gaining the title of chairman of the Pre
sidium of the Supreme Soviet.
Scholars cited a general lack of
knowledge about Soviet internal affairs
and the historical delay between estab
lished leaders as reasons that make
guessing Brezhnev's successor difficult.

"We know so little about all these in
ternal decision-making processes" that
it is difficult to make an accurate pre
diction, according to Jan Triska, politi
cal science professor and specialist in
Soviet affairs.
— Triska did say, however, that Yuri
Andropov, 68, a senior Politburo mem
ber and former KGB chief, "may have
the best chance." Commenting on An
dropov's appointment as chairman of
the funeral committee, he said, "I think
it's symbolic — it may mean something
but it may not."
Robert Conquest, a senior research
fellow at the Hoover Institution, said he
views Andropov and Konstantin
Chernenko, 71, also a senior Politburo
member and a close associate of
Brezhnev, as the two most likely can
didates. But looking at history, Con

quest said, "the winner of the first
round has lost power later."
Conquest, recently returned from a
meeting of Soviet specialists at the
Rockefeller Foundation in New York,
continued, "It's impossible to predion
completely* it's harder than book
making."
Soviet history was also mentioned by
Robert Wesson, a senior research fel
low at Hoover. "Nobody can really suc
ceed Brezhnev for a number of years...
looking at Soviet history, it will take
three, four or five years for the leader to
emerge," he said. "In the past the per
son who has seemed the most obvious
has not become the real leader."
Citing a difficulty in predicting how
the change in Soviet leadership will af
fect the functioning of that country,
