# Soviet Union after Brezhnev
## Local experts' predictions differ 
### KRISTEN CHRISTOPHER Senior staff writer 
Soviet experts here agree that it is
nearly impossible to predict who will
succeed Leonid Brezhnev as Soviet
president, but they differ in their opin
ions of how his death .will affect lhat
country's policies.
Brezhnev, 75, died Wednesday of an
apparent heart attack. He had been
leader of the Soviet Union's Com
munist Party — the country's most
powerful position — for 18 years. In
1977, he also took over as head of state,
gaining the title of chairman of the Pre
sidium of the Supreme Soviet.
Scholars cited a general lack of
knowledge about Soviet internal affairs
and the historical delay between estab
lished leaders as reasons that make
guessing Brezhnev's successor difficult.

"We know so little about all these in
ternal decision-making processes" that
it is difficult to make an accurate pre
diction, according to Jan Triska, politi
cal science professor and specialist in
Soviet affairs.
— Triska did say, however, that Yuri
Andropov, 68, a senior Politburo mem
ber and former KGB chief, "may have
the best chance." Commenting on An
dropov's appointment as chairman of
the funeral committee, he said, "I think
it's symbolic — it may mean something
but it may not."
Robert Conquest, a senior research
fellow at the Hoover Institution, said he
views Andropov and Konstantin
Chernenko, 71, also a senior Politburo
member and a close associate of
Brezhnev, as the two most likely can
didates. But looking at history, Con

quest said, "the winner of the first
round has lost power later."
Conquest, recently returned from a
meeting of Soviet specialists at the
Rockefeller Foundation in New York,
continued, "It's impossible to predion
completely* it's harder than book
making."
Soviet history was also mentioned by
Robert Wesson, a senior research fel
low at Hoover. "Nobody can really suc
ceed Brezhnev for a number of years...
looking at Soviet history, it will take
three, four or five years for the leader to
emerge," he said. "In the past the per
son who has seemed the most obvious
has not become the real leader."
Citing a difficulty in predicting how
the change in Soviet leadership will af
fect the functioning of that country,
Wesson said, "Even if we knew the
name of that person, we wouldn't know
the directions he would take."
Each Soviet leader has made changes
in policies, Wesson said, "so it is very
important who becomes the eventual
boss."
Triska and Conquest, however, said
they do not think new leadership will
produce changes in policy.
"Of course any sort of major change
or major-looking change does give one
the opportunity to make policy
statements . . . but I don't think there's
much give in their policy-making,"
Conquest said.
Triska said, "There are not going to
be innovators .. . they're trying to keep
stability."
Both Triska and Wesson said they
think that instability within the Soviet

Union will occur, but it will probably
not affect relations between the United
States and the Soviet Union.
"In a time of uncertainty the Soviets
are likely to be more cautious," Wesson
said. He said the United States did not
take advantage of Soviet instability af
ter Stalin's death, and does not think it
will now.
It is important to realize, Wesson
said, that "the Soviet Union is not a ris
ing power — their capabilities are de
creasing and I think they will continue
to decrease."
Triska said, "The Soviet Union is
very vulnerable at moments of transi
tion," but that after listening to a
statement by President Reagan did not
think the current administration would
try to take advantage of the instability.
New party leaders are officially
chosen by the 319 voting members of
the Central Committee, according to
party rules, but "in effect it is the Polit
buro that makes the decision," Con
quest said.

It has been said that if the smaller and
more elite Politburo is divided between
two candidates, the Central Committee
may play a more significant role in the
decision-making process, according to
Conquest, but he thinks it is more likely
that the Politburo may turn to a "com
promise candidate."
"I think Chernenko's strengths have
been slightly underestimated ... he
stands with the status quo in the Polit
buro," Conquest said. In citing betting
odds, however, he placed him even with
Andropov at 2-to-l against.
He placed odds against Viktor
Griskin, leader of the Communist Party
in Moscow, at 5-to-l; Dimitri Ustinov,
defense minister, at 10-to-l; Andrei
Kirilenko, a senior Politburo member,
at 25-to-l; and"the field" at 30-to-l.
Conquest added that Foreign Min
ister Andrei Gromyko may support
Andropov's bid for party leadership in
an attempt to obtain the presidency for
himself.
