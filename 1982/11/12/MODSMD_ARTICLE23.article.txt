## Card's trip to Rose Bowl early, but crucial for bowl bid 
### SID SPAETH 
Stanford gets a whiff of the
roses it will miss this year when
the Cardinal travels to the Rose
Bowl tomorrow to play UCLA.
The Cardinal's bowl hopes
dimmed Saturday when its
fourth quarter follies gave Arizo
na a 41-27 win. The Cardinal will
probably have to win both its re
maining games to get a bowl bid,
most likely the Aloha Bowl.
Arizona scored 28 points in the
closing 12 minutes Saturday, the

last two touchdowns set up by a
Stanford fumble and an intercep
tion.
"The fourth quarter against
Arizona is not what this team is
all about," Stanford coach Paul
Wiggin said. "There's tremen
dous character and a will to win
on this Stanford team. 1 fully ex
pect our players to rebound from
this loss and play well on Satur
day."
UCLA, meanwhile, dropped a

10-7 struggle to Washington last
week, lowering the Bruins's rec
ord to 7-1 -1 and tying them with
Arizona for fourth place in the
Pacific-10 standings. The match
up will be critical for both teams'
bowl hopes and will feature an air
show between the schools'
Heisman Trophy candidate
quarterbacks — John Elwav and
Tom Ramsey.
Statistically, both are
awesome, and in raw ability can

match each other spiral-for
spiral, rainmaker-for-rainmaker.
Ramsey has completed 161-
of-260 passes for 2375 yards and
18 touchdowns.
Elway has completed 208-
of-327 passes for 2560 yards and
20 touchdowns.
"Tom Ramsey is the focal
point of an explosive UCLA of
fense," Wiggin said. "Their em
phasis has shifted to the pass this
year, and they've been highly
productive with it. They have an
outstanding group of receivers to
go along with a fine quarter
hack.' 1
Ramsey goes mainly to his
wide receivers, Elway to his
backs.
UCLA split end Cormac
Carney has 37 catches for 595
yards, while deep-threat flanker
Jojo Townsell has 31 receptions
for 608 yards and eight touch
downs.
Bruin tight end Paul
Bergmann has been steady with
30 catches for 458 yards.
Stanford counters with a more
versatile receiving corps led by
running back Vincent White with
a league-leading 45 receptions
and tight end Chris Dressel with
37 catches for 523 yards.
From the outside, split end
Emile Harry has 36 grabs for 583
yards and flanker Mike Tolliver
has 23 catches for 361 yards. The
two have combined for eight
touchdowns.
UCLA's ground attack, which
has averaged 135.8 yards a game,
is led bv tailbacks Frank
Cephous with 274 yards on 65 at
tempts and Danny Andrews with
419 yards on 49 rushes. Kevin
Nelson, younger brother of
former Cardinal great Darrin
Nelson, has been hampered by
injuries all season and has been
held to 157 yards on 61 attempts.
Nelson rushed for 883 yards last
season.
Stanford's rushing game has
emerged as a definite threat. Vin
cent White has rushed for 390
yards on 71 carries and averages
20.8 yards on punt returns.
Mike Dotterer, who shares
backfield time with White, has
slashed for a team-leading 420

yards on 81 attempts.
UCLA's defense has held op
ponents to 136 yards and 18
points per game. Free safety Don
Rogers has 68 tackles and has
knocked down 10 passes while in
tercepting two. Strong safety
Tom Sullivan has 43 tackles.
Inside linebacker Blanchard
Montgomery has 69 tackles and
comerback Lupe Sanchez has 30
tackles, nine knocked-down
passes and a team-leading five in

terceptions.
Stanford's defensive strength
has been in interceptions. The
Cardinal, leading the Pac-lOwith
22 aerial steals, is paced by strong
safety Charles Hutchings with
five and cornerback-safety Dar
rell Grissum with four.
Free safety Vaughn Williams
leads the Card with 72 tackles
and seven knockdowns, but out
side linebacker Garin Veris has
provided the main up-front surge

with 64 tackles including nine
sacks and 15 tackles-for-losses.
Tackle John Bergren has 57
tackles while cornerback Kevin
Baird has 62.
Stanford's secondary will be
healthy again as Rod Gilmore
and Eric Price are scheduled to
return along with offensive tackle
Jeff Deaton. Linebacker Kevin
Bates and fullback Greg Hooper
are listed as probable starters.
