# Spikers face tough weekend on road
## 
### STEPHEN STRENG 
The Stanford women's vol
leyball team puts its No. 3 na
tional ranking and its 7-2 league
record to a grueling test this
weekend when it faces Western
Collegiate Athletic Association
foes No. 11 ranked UCLA, No. 8
Arizona, and No. 7 Arizona
State on the road. The Cardinal
plays UCLA todav, Arizona
tomorrow and ASU on Sunday.
Stanford underwent a similar
test earlier in the season when it
played all three teams in one
weekend at home. In that series
the Cardinal defeated UCLA and
Arizona but lost to ASU.
Being ranked No. 3 nationally
almost assures the Cardinal of a
spot in the NCAA playoffs, but
wins this weekend could move
Stanford closer to first place in
the league rankings and help

Stanford obtain a coveted first
round bve. Stanford is presently
second in the WCAA behind San
Diego State, 10-1.
Even though the Cardinal had
easily beaten them earlier in the
season, assistant coach Don
Shaw is worried most about
UCLA. "They've been playing
very well lately, and thev've got
ten back some injured
plavers,"said Shaw, "Arizona
and Arizona State are really hot
and cold teams."
The Cardinal is coming off a
fourth-place finish in the presti
gious National Invitational
Tournament this past weekend.
The tournament consisted of 20
teams, 16 of those in the top-20of
the nation. Stanford lost to No. 2
ranked Hawaii in the third round
consolation match.

pounds a hit past a would-be-biocker in the Cardinal's win over
UCLA in Maples Pavilion earlier this year. Hope and the
Cardinal face a tough weekend as they face UCLA, ASU and
Arizona all on the road.
