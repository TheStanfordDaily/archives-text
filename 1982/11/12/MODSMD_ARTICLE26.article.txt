## 
### 
Stanford basketball coach
Tom Davis has signed three
high school players to letters
of intent to attend school here
next fall, he announced yes
terday.
The players are taking ad
vantage of a new NCAA rule,
which allows prospective ath
letes to sign letters of intent
during an eight-day period in
November.
Grady Johnson, a six-foot
eight center from Atlanta,
Doug Wall, a 6-6 forward
from Grass Valley, and Nov
ian Whitsitt, a 6-1 guard from
San Pedro, all agreed to play
for the former Boston College
coach in 1983.

"We're extremely pleased
with the caliber of the three
athletes," Davis said. "We've
helped ourselves at all three
positions — guard, forward
and center — and we are cer
tainly impressed with the aca
demic credentials of-each."
Johnson averaged 17 points
and 14 rebounds at Booker T.
Washington High School in
Atlanta last year. He ranks in
the top 10 of his class academ
ically and is president of his
senior class.
"Grady was bigger and
faster than many of the ath
letes that 1 had a chance to re
cruit," said assistant coach
Bobby Hunter. "He possesses
good skills, a fine touch from
the free throw line for a big
man and, most impressively
of all, he is extremely
coachable."
"He's a power player,"
added assistant coach Bruce
Pearl. "Bobby Hunter went
from nowhere to sign him
(Johnson). Northwestern,
who had him all but signed,
sealed, and delivered, called
(Stanford athletic director)
Andy Geiger and con
gratulated him on signing
Grady Johnson. He's got all
of the tools, they're just un
tapped as of yet."
Wall averaged 13 points
and 11 rebounds as he led Ne
vada Union High School to a
14-0 record last year in the
Foothill League and a 26-6
record overall.
"Doug Wall had an out
standing summer competing
against some players with na

tional reputations and estab
lishing himself as a fine
Division I forward," said
Davis. "Fle's a very aggressive
player on the boards and is a
fine shooter."
Whitsitt averaged 24.2
points to lead all juniors in the
city in scoriflg and eight as
sists last season at San Pedro
High School.
"We're very excited at the
prospect of having Novian en
tering Stanford," said assis
tant coach Cory Russell. "His
tremendous speed and
quickness will be a great asset
to our backcourt. We're hop
ing that he may be able to con
tribute right away."
"These guys may not have
been the best available skill
wise," said Pearl of the trio.
"But we sense that they have
something inside them which
will make them great. Wheth
er they will be great basketball
players, great engineers, great
flutists, we don't know, but
they all want to be great. And
that's the kind of kids we have
to recruit."
