# Poloists seek third consecutive Pacific-10 title this weekend
## 
### CHRIS ADDINGTON 
If you're taking a road trip
to Los Angeles this weekend,
there's more than one sport to
occupy the time.
The Stanford water polo
team will travel to USC's
home pool at the Colliseum to
plav at 3 p.m. today. The
Cardinal faces UCLA at 10:30
a.m. tomorrow.
The No. 2 ranked Cardinal
is undefeated in league plav
and could bring the PAC-10
crown to the Farm for the
third straight year with two
victories this weekend.
"This is a tough back-to
back weekend for us," said

Cardinal head coach Dante
Dettamanti. "These teams re
ally get psyched in their home
pools."
The University of Southern
California is currently ranked
No. 5 in the nation but they
have failed to post a victory in
the tough PAC-10 conference.
UCLA, ranked No. 3, is
paced by Boogie Black and
swimming speedster Robin
Leamy.
"UCLA has lots of depth,"
commented Dettamanti.
"They have lots of substitutes
and they use them often," he
added. The Bruins, with a 2-2

PAC-IO record, are currently
in a tie with UC-Berkelev for
second place.
Stanford has been plagued
by slow starts in many of its
games this year especially
against these two squads.
"We've really got to move
and get involved right from
the start," senior John Tanner
said. "If we do this, the of
fense really takes off."
After this weekend Stan
ford will have one more regu
lar season game against
Berkeley in the Big Splash and
then it's on to the NCAAs
over Thanksgiving break.
