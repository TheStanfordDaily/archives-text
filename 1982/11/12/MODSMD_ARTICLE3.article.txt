# U.S.-Soviet nuclear tensions linked to resource competition
## 
### DAVID AZRIN Senior staff writer 
San Francisco — Soviet-American hostilities have been
caused largely by a superpower battle to exploit the world's
natural resources, David Brower, chairman and founder of
Friends of the Earth, said at a nuclear arms conference yes
terday.
"The war against the earth is leading directly to the final
war, the war against the people," Brower said before a 400-
member audience at St. Mary's Cathedral.
Brower kicked off a day-long conference entitled "Solu
tions to End the Weapons Crisis" which included speeches
by various experts on the nuclear arms race.
"As we seek to protect our resources from the rest of the
world, we are mining the soil," Brower said. "What is caus
ing war is the fight over what's left in the bottom of the bar
rel."
The former guest professor advocated a nuclear arms
freeze with the Soviet Union to reverse the arms race: "We
must consider what we can do with that kind of money to
secure the earth rather than try to blow it up. A reversal of

the superpower nuclear arms race is an essential first step."
Two other experts, Robert Barker, special projects pro
gram leader at Lawrence Livermore Laboratory, and Marin
Malia, a history professor at UC-Berkeley, disagreed with
Brower's analysis. Both men said the Soviet Union is in
herently hostile and expansionist, and they advocated lim
ited arms reduction talks with the Soviet Union.
"They are paranoid because their ideology requires that.
The Soviet Union is a monstrously failed Utopia and the
Utopia can only be enforced by fear and terror," Malia said.
Malia said American policy-makers must be aware that
the Soviets will always be hostile toward the United States
whenever they negotiate with the Soviet Union.
"They view their relations with the outside world as a con
dition of hostility and war and everything they do is part of
this war," he said.
"It is only by programs which have a realistic view of the
Soviet Union that we can meaningfully deal with the arms
race," Malia said.
Some audience members heckled Malia when he said the
peace movement has been used as a tool
by the Soviet Union to apply unilateral
pressure on the United States.
Barker also said the United States
must continually expand its nuclear
capabilities to check Soviet military ex
pansionism.
"We have had peace in the European
arena for 37 years only because of the
balance, but the balance has now been
tipped."
Barker said that Soviet deployment
of SS-20 missiles along European
borders has given the Soviet Union
weapon superiority there. The United
States must either expand its nuclear
capabilities or convince the Soviet
Union to reduce it forces, Barker said.
"If it occurs in the mind of the next
Soviet leader that he can gain politically
in Europe by using a perceived superi
ority, he will do it," Barker said.
Barker and Malia debated with two
other experts who favored a verifiable
nuclear freeze with the Soviet Union.
Phillip Morrison, astrophysics pro
fessor at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, and Ted Ralston, former
Senate staff member, downplayed the
hostile intentions of the Soviet Union,
characterizing the Soviet military build
up as a largely defensive move.
"Their build-up in the 1960s was a re
action to the build-up by the United
States in the previous five or six years,"
said Ralston, a member of the Stanford
Arms Control and Disarmament Fo
rum.
Ralston and Morrison both dis
counted arguments that verification of
a nuclear freeze will be impossible.
"The arms race is not to be scored.
You can't count up the points. The real
point is that neither side has been so
much in peril than they are today,"
Morrison said.
"It is a constant chess game. And
that's alright. It has led to an uneasy
peace. But the time has come to say
enough," he said.
Scheduled speaker Gen. Vladimir
Kulagin, Soviet deputy consul, was un
able to appear because of events sur
rounding the death of former Soviet
President Leonid Brezhnev, organizers
said.
Other speakers included Stanford
History Prof. Barton Bernstein, David
McFadden, director of the Mid-Penin
sula Conversion Project and Owen
Chamberlain, Nobel Laureate and UC-
Berkelev physics professor.

Barker and Malia debated with two
other experts who favored a verifiable
nuclear freeze with the Soviet Union.
Phillip Morrison, astrophysics pro
fessor at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, and Ted Ralston, former
Senate staff member, downplayed the
hostile intentions of the Soviet Union,
characterizing the Soviet military build
up as a largely defensive move.
"Their build-up in the 1960s was a re
action to the build-up by the United
States in the previous five or six years,"
said Ralston, a member of the Stanford
Arms Control and Disarmament Fo
rum.
Ralston and Morrison both dis
counted arguments that verification of
a nuclear freeze will be impossible.
"The arms race is not to be scored.
You can't count up the points. The real
point is that neither side has been so
much in peril than they are today,"
Morrison said.
"It is a constant chess game. And
that's alright. It has led to an uneasy
peace. But the time has come to say
enough," he said.
Scheduled speaker Gen. Vladimir
Kulagin, Soviet deputy consul, was un
able to appear because of events sur
rounding the death of former Soviet
President Leonid Brezhnev, organizers
said.
Other speakers included Stanford
History Prof. Barton Bernstein, David
McFadden, director of the Mid-Penin
sula Conversion Project and Owen
Chamberlain, Nobel Laureate and UC-
Berkelev physics professor.
San Francisco — Soviet-American hostilities have been
caused largely by a superpower battle to exploit the world's
natural resources, David Brower, chairman and founder of
Friends of the Earth, said at a nuclear arms conference yes
terday.
"The war against the earth is leading directly to the final
war, the war against the people," Brower said before a 400-
member audience at St. Mary's Cathedral.
Brower kicked off a day-long conference entitled "Solu
tions to End the Weapons Crisis" which included speeches
by various experts on the nuclear arms race.
"As we seek to protect our resources from the rest of the
world, we are mining the soil," Brower said. "What is caus
ing war is the fight over what's left in the bottom of the bar
rel."
The former guest professor advocated a nuclear arms
freeze with the Soviet Union to reverse the arms race: "We
must consider what we can do with that kind of money to
secure the earth rather than try to blow it up. A reversal of

the superpower nuclear arms race is an essential first step."
Two other experts, Robert Barker, special projects pro
gram leader at Lawrence Livermore Laboratory, and Marin
Malia, a history professor at UC-Berkeley, disagreed with
Brower's analysis. Both men said the Soviet Union is in
herently hostile and expansionist, and they advocated lim
ited arms reduction talks with the Soviet Union.
"They are paranoid because their ideology requires that.
The Soviet Union is a monstrously failed Utopia and the
Utopia can only be enforced by fear and terror," Malia said.
Malia said American policy-makers must be aware that
the Soviets will always be hostile toward the United States
whenever they negotiate with the Soviet Union.
"They view their relations with the outside world as a con
dition of hostility and war and everything they do is part of
this war," he said.
"It is only by programs which have a realistic view of the
Soviet Union that we can meaningfully deal with the arms
race," Malia said.
Some audience members heckled Malia when he said the
peace movement has been used as a tool
by the Soviet Union to apply unilateral
pressure on the United States.
Barker also said the United States
must continually expand its nuclear
capabilities to check Soviet military ex
pansionism.
"We have had peace in the European
arena for 37 years only because of the
balance, but the balance has now been
tipped."
Barker said that Soviet deployment
of SS-20 missiles along European
borders has given the Soviet Union
weapon superiority there. The United
States must either expand its nuclear
capabilities or convince the Soviet
Union to reduce it forces, Barker said.
"If it occurs in the mind of the next
Soviet leader that he can gain politically
in Europe by using a perceived superi
ority, he will do it," Barker said.
