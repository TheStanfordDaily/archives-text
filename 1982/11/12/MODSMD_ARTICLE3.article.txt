San Francisco â€” Soviet-American hostilities have been
caused largely by a superpower battle to exploit the world's
natural resources, David Brower, chairman and founder of
Friends of the Earth, said at a nuclear arms conference yes
terday.
"The war against the earth is leading directly to the final
war, the war against the people," Brower said before a 400-
member audience at St. Mary's Cathedral.
Brower kicked off a day-long conference entitled "Solu

by various experts on the nuclear arms race.
"As we seek to protect our resources from the rest of the
world, we are mining the soil," Brower said. "What is caus

must consider what we can do with that kind of money to
secure the earth rather than try to blow it up. A reversal of

the superpower nuclear arms race is an essential first step."
Two other experts, Robert Barker, special projects pro
gram leader at Lawrence Livermore Laboratory, and Marin
Malia, a history professor at UC-Berkeley, disagreed with
Brower's analysis. Both men said the Soviet Union is in
herently hostile and expansionist, and they advocated lim
ited arms reduction talks with the Soviet Union.
"They are paranoid because their ideology requires that.
The Soviet Union is a monstrously failed Utopia and the
Utopia can only be enforced by fear and terror," Malia said.
Malia said American policy-makers must be aware that
the Soviets will always be hostile toward the United States
whenever they negotiate with the Soviet Union.
"They view their relations with the outside world as a con
dition of hostility and war and everything they do is part of
this war," he said.
"It is only by programs which have a realistic view of the
Soviet Union that we can meaningfully deal with the arms
race," Malia said.
Some audience members heckled Malia when he said the
