# Stanford to host frisbee tournament
## 
### 
Ultimate frisbee is a fast paced,
7-player team sport involving
shuttling the disc back-and-forth
between team members down the
field and into the end-zone for
the score. A dropped disc means
a loss of possession.
Disc golf is a somewhat less
dynamic event, but it too is grow
ing in popularity. Sunday's tour
nament will mark the debut of
the new disc golf course which
winds its way around the Stadi
um (the course will remain after
the tournament). Like standard
golf, each throw counts as one
stroke, and the lowest score wins
the round.

The game of Frisbee has
evolved very quickly. The metal
"Frisbie Company" tins hurled
around by Ivy League students
some 30 years ago have evolved
into high-tech, tough plastic
"sport-discs" hurled bv millions
of people worldwide in a myriad
of Frisbee competitions.
Stanford will host the AMF
Voit-Ultimate-Disc Golf Classic
of 1982 Sunday from 11 a.m. to 4
p.m.
There will be both co-ed and
open divisions in both events,
and both events are open to all
who wish to participate. The
events require no entry fees.
