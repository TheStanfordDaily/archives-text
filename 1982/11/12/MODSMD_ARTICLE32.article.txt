Dinner at the Velvet Turtle is a

taurant is a welcome haven for
any food connoisueur but surely

We visited the restaurant on a

Friday night and were seated
about 10 minutes after our 7 p.m.
reservations. We were quickly
studying the menu's continental
cuisine, ranging from beef and
seafood to veal and fish. The
menu choices, while varied,
tended to one common trait —
they were expensive. A cheaper
way to go can sometimes be
found on the daily special black
board every waiter or waitress
will present to your table. The
fresh fish specials are the best
deal, usually about $7.95.
Our choices were the roast
prime rib of beef — Velvet Turtle
Cut — (at $14.95 it's $2 more
than the regular cut but worth it
for true lovers of thick prime rib)
and the filet mignon and lobster
tail combination special ($17.95).
The prime rib came with baked
potato, horseradish and au jus.
The special came with generous
portions of lobster and filet, ac
companied by tasty cooked car
rots. All beef, seafood and spe
cialty meals are served with a
fresh vegetable, French bread
and your choice of the soup du
jour or gazpacho a la Seville or
chilled cucumber soup or mixed
green salad. The salad is tossed at
vour table.

For $1.50 extra you can order
the French onion soup au gratin
instead of the soup du jour. The
soup was extremely tasty and the
cheese was layered on nice and
thick. However, the cheese used
was swiss and not the better-tast
ing guerriere expected at these
prices.
We also ordered appetizers —
luscious potato skins ($3.50) with

cheese, bacon and sour cream
and unbelievably good
mushrooms ($4.25) stuffed with
crab and shrimp and covered
with hollandaise sauce. You get
plenty of potato skins for two but
the mushrooms are on the skim
py side. Other featured ap
petizers include escargots
($4.95), trench fried zucchini

On the Friday night
we were there, the
restaurant was
crowded but we
probably saw only
one other couple
within 20 years of our
age.

($2.50) and the ever-tempting
avocado with crab and shrimp
salad ($4.95) — a half avocado
filled with crab and shrimp.
We had two glasses of the
house rose with our meal ($1.75
each). As our waitress pointed
out, buying two glasses is a better
deal than half a bottle.
Service was exceptional. Our

waitress was extremely efficient
and pleasant. Her advice was
graciously accepted and she was
right on all counts from entrees
to wine to desserts. As for our
busbov, he was . . . well, overly
efficient. He was extremely atten
tive and it became most annoying
to have him filling our water
glasses every time we took a sip.
It got to the point where we were

counting how manv times he
came over to add a touch of fresh
water to our just-under-full
glasses. (Nine times during the
course of two hours.)
Though we were stuffed, we
both of course managed to order
dessert anyway. Our choices: the
chocolate mousse torte ($2.95)
and the amaretto torte ($3.50).
They both tasted great, so you
may want to make sure to save
some room when you go.
Now for the bad news. At the
Velvet Turtle no one can deny the
exceptional quality of the food,
especially when you consider that

the 23-restaurant chain is run by
Saga Corporation, the food ser
vice people located on campuses
all across the country and with its
headquarters just down the road
on Sand Hill.
However, we must tell of the
gauche decor inside. When first
walking in, you will think you are
walking into the huge lobby of an
elegant hotel. The overly deco
rated rooms reek of ostentation.
The decor is too brassy, too
nouveau riche — as if the owners
have worked too hard to impress
you. In fact, this certainly may be
the case, as our waitress told us

that the Sharon Heights Velvet
Turtle is the "flagship" Of the
chain.
The restaurant is divided into
six dining rooms — each deco
rated in its own velvety decor. We
recommend the garden room,
which features wicker chairs.
Stanford students seem to be a
rare sight at the Velvet Turtle. On
the Friday night we were there,
the restaurant was crowded but
we probably saw only one other
couple that was within 20 years of
our age. That doesn't mean this
isn't a place for students to go.

We especially recommend it for
when the parents or grand
parents come or even for a quick
getaway for two.
Probably the most discourag
ing reason for students is the high
price. Our dinner totaled $64
with tip. But if you stick to the
specials or the fish, you can do
much better.
The Velvet Turtle is also open
for lunch and has a cocktail
lounge

The prime rib came with baked
potato, horseradish and au jus.
The special came with generous
portions of lobster and filet, ac
companied by tasty cooked car
rots. All beef, seafood and spe
cialty meals are served with a
fresh vegetable, French bread
and your choice of the soup du
jour or gazpacho a la Seville or
chilled cucumber soup or mixed
green salad. The salad is tossed at
vour table.

For $1.50 extra you can order
the French onion soup au gratin
instead of the soup du jour. The
soup was extremely tasty and the
cheese was layered on nice and
thick. However, the cheese used
was swiss and not the better-tast
ing guerriere expected at these
prices.
We also ordered appetizers —
luscious potato skins ($3.50) with

cheese, bacon and sour cream
and unbelievably good
mushrooms ($4.25) stuffed with
crab and shrimp and covered
with hollandaise sauce. You get
plenty of potato skins for two but
the mushrooms are on the skim
py side. Other featured ap
petizers include escargots
($4.95), trench fried zucchini

On the Friday night
we were there, the
restaurant was
crowded but we
probably saw only
one other couple
within 20 years of our
age.

($2.50) and the ever-tempting
avocado with crab and shrimp
salad ($4.95) — a half avocado
filled with crab and shrimp.
We had two glasses of the
house rose with our meal ($1.75
each). As our waitress pointed
out, buying two glasses is a better
deal than half a bottle.
Service was exceptional. Our

waitress was extremely efficient
and pleasant. Her advice was
graciously accepted and she was
right on all counts from entrees
to wine to desserts. As for our
busbov, he was . . . well, overly
efficient. He was extremely atten
tive and it became most annoying
to have him filling our water
glasses every time we took a sip.
It got to the point where we were

counting how manv times he
came over to add a touch of fresh
water to our just-under-full
glasses. (Nine times during the
course of two hours.)
Though we were stuffed, we
both of course managed to order
dessert anyway. Our choices: the
chocolate mousse torte ($2.95)
and the amaretto torte ($3.50).
They both tasted great, so you
may want to make sure to save
some room when you go.
Now for the bad news. At the
Velvet Turtle no one can deny the
exceptional quality of the food,
especially when you consider that

the 23-restaurant chain is run by
Saga Corporation, the food ser
vice people located on campuses
all across the country and with its
headquarters just down the road
on Sand Hill.
However, we must tell of the
gauche decor inside. When first
walking in, you will think you are
walking into the huge lobby of an
elegant hotel. The overly deco
rated rooms reek of ostentation.
The decor is too brassy, too
nouveau riche — as if the owners
have worked too hard to impress
you. In fact, this certainly may be
the case, as our waitress told us

that the Sharon Heights Velvet
Turtle is the "flagship" Of the
chain.
The restaurant is divided into
six dining rooms — each deco
rated in its own velvety decor. We
recommend the garden room,
which features wicker chairs.
Stanford students seem to be a
rare sight at the Velvet Turtle. On
the Friday night we were there,
the restaurant was crowded but
we probably saw only one other
couple that was within 20 years of
our age. That doesn't mean this
isn't a place for students to go.

We especially recommend it for
when the parents or grand
parents come or even for a quick
getaway for two.
Probably the most discourag
ing reason for students is the high
price. Our dinner totaled $64
with tip. But if you stick to the
specials or the fish, you can do
much better.
The Velvet Turtle is also open
for lunch and has a cocktail
lounge

We visited the restaurant on a

Friday night and were seated
about 10 minutes after our 7 p.m.
reservations. We were quickly
studying the menu's continental
cuisine, ranging from beef and
seafood to veal and fish. The
menu choices, while varied,
tended to one common trait —
they were expensive. A cheaper
way to go can sometimes be
found on the daily special black
board every waiter or waitress
will present to your table. The
fresh fish specials are the best
deal, usually about $7.95.
Our choices were the roast
prime rib of beef — Velvet Turtle
Cut — (at $14.95 it's $2 more
than the regular cut but worth it
for true lovers of thick prime rib)
and the filet mignon and lobster
tail combination special ($17.95).
The prime rib came with baked
potato, horseradish and au jus.
