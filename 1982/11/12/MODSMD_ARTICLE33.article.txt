[squash, canned peaches and

tends to be a bit damp, there's an
other cellar down El Camino that
offers just as many goodies, but
with a friendly warmth sure to
ward off the chill autumn air.

One of the first
steakhouses in the

One of the first steakhouses in
the Bay Area, The Cellar has
been in business since 1969.
The life of most restaurants
seems to be five years, so its sheer
staying power indicates the res
taurant must be doing something
right.
And that something includes
service as well as food.

We arrived at The Cellar a few
minutes before our 7:30 p.m. res
ervation. When we walked
through the front door we were
impressed by the handsome
wooden staircase that leads up to
the dining area. Thick rope
linked sculpted bannisters and
gave the impression of walking
a dock.
At the top of the stairs we were
greeted bv a cheerful hostess who
promptly seated us at a window
table overlooking the back patio.
The back patio, complete with
goldfish-stocked pond and
wooden deck, is used for Happy
Hours on warm summer eve
nings. When the nights get cooler
cocktails are moved inside, but
free hors d'oeuvres are still
served from 5-6 p.m.
Famished, we ordered quickly
and were pleasantly surprised
when our waiter responded in
kind. A subtle wink from our
waiter let us know that our
choices, a beef filet wrapped in
bacon ($12.95) and a fresh filet of
English sole stuffed with crab
meat ($9.95) would not disap
point us.
All dinners include salad, soup
and rice so be prepared to stay
awhile. If you're in the mood for
seafood, entrees include Austral
ian lobster tail ($14.95), scampi
($11.95) or shellfish piccata,
lobster, prawns and scallops
sauteed with white wine and
capers in lemon butter sauce
($12.95), a house specialty. If
beef is more your style, there are
at least six entrees ranging from
$7.95 to 13.95 from which to

/the\
fmiAR

choose.
The salad bar consists of a
standard lettuce and the typical
broccoli, cauliflower, tomato
and vegetable fare. What it lacks
in imagination, the salad bar
makes up for in volume.
The chicken and rice soup
however proved to be another
matter. The Cellar must have
raided grandma's and emerged
victorious with a delicious recipe
for a soup that beats Campbell's
by a long shot. A tasty sourdough
bread, also included in the meal,
complemented the soup and
salad.
In the interest of being thor
ough in our review, we ordered
two appetizers, deep fried
mushrooms and zucchini — both

$1.95 and both quite satisfying.

petizers include steamed clams
($3.95) and calamari ($2.95) deep

fried with lemon garlic butter.
We recommend ordering only
one of the vegetable or seafood
appetizers offered. The ample
portions are more than enough
for two. You'll need to save room
for the main course.

Timing is something to ap
preciate at a restaurant and our
waiter timed the entrees' arrival
well. Though my partner pro
nounced the sole delicious, at 6'
1" he found it was less than fill
ing. Baked and topped with au
gratin sauce, the sole did, how
ever, satisfy the tastebuds.

Quite frankly, my filet proved
a bit disappointing. Although it
was plump and juicy, it had more
fat on it than I had bargained.

The accompanying rice, sea
soned with bits of onion was de
scribed as "good" by my partner.
The adjective seemed to fit.
Anything that the meal might
have lacked was more than made
up for by the dessert menu. The
original mudpie ($1.50) proved
to be a delicious oreo cookie
crust topped with coffee ice
cream sure to satisfy any after
dinner cravings. And the
raspberry cheesecake ($1.95),
equally as good, was creamv but
not so rich as to overwhelm.
Though not extensive, as there
are only four choices, the dessert
menu is definitely a fine ending to
an overall tastv meal.
After dinner we decided to ex
plore further our surroundings.

The chicken and rice
soup, however,
proved to be another

We approved of the stained glass
light shades softening the glare
found in much restaurant light

ing and the extensive use of wood
detailing. Plants were strategical
ly placed throughout the dining
room. Antique mirrors hung on
one wall showed an attention to

Though there is a
small pub upstairs, a
second winding

[squash, canned peaches and

other cellar down El Camino that
offers just as many goodies, but
with a friendly warmth sure to
ward off the chill autumn air.

steakhouses in the

One of the first steakhouses in
the Bay Area, The Cellar has
been in business since 1969.
The life of most restaurants
seems to be five years, so its sheer
staying power indicates the res
taurant must be doing something
right.
And that something includes
service as well as food.

We arrived at The Cellar a few
minutes before our 7:30 p.m. res
ervation. When we walked
through the front door we were
impressed by the handsome
wooden staircase that leads up to
the dining area. Thick rope
linked sculpted bannisters and
gave the impression of walking
a dock.
At the top of the stairs we were
greeted bv a cheerful hostess who
promptly seated us at a window
table overlooking the back patio.
The back patio, complete with
goldfish-stocked pond and
wooden deck, is used for Happy
Hours on warm summer eve
nings. When the nights get cooler
cocktails are moved inside, but
free hors d'oeuvres are still
served from 5-6 p.m.
Famished, we ordered quickly
and were pleasantly surprised
when our waiter responded in
kind. A subtle wink from our
waiter let us know that our
choices, a beef filet wrapped in
bacon ($12.95) and a fresh filet of
English sole stuffed with crab
meat ($9.95) would not disap
point us.
All dinners include salad, soup
and rice so be prepared to stay
awhile. If you're in the mood for
seafood, entrees include Austral
ian lobster tail ($14.95), scampi
($11.95) or shellfish piccata,
lobster, prawns and scallops
sauteed with white wine and
capers in lemon butter sauce
($12.95), a house specialty. If
beef is more your style, there are
at least six entrees ranging from
$7.95 to 13.95 from which to

/the\
fmiAR

choose.
The salad bar consists of a
standard lettuce and the typical
broccoli, cauliflower, tomato
and vegetable fare. What it lacks
in imagination, the salad bar
makes up for in volume.
The chicken and rice soup
however proved to be another
matter. The Cellar must have
raided grandma's and emerged
victorious with a delicious recipe
for a soup that beats Campbell's
by a long shot. A tasty sourdough
bread, also included in the meal,
complemented the soup and
salad.
In the interest of being thor

two appetizers, deep fried
mushrooms and zucchini — both

petizers include steamed clams
($3.95) and calamari ($2.95) deep

fried with lemon garlic butter.
We recommend ordering only
one of the vegetable or seafood
appetizers offered. The ample
portions are more than enough
for two. You'll need to save room
for the main course.

Timing is something to ap
preciate at a restaurant and our
waiter timed the entrees' arrival
well. Though my partner pro
nounced the sole delicious, at 6'
1" he found it was less than fill
ing. Baked and topped with au
gratin sauce, the sole did, how
ever, satisfy the tastebuds.

Quite frankly, my filet proved
a bit disappointing. Although it
was plump and juicy, it had more
fat on it than I had bargained.

The accompanying rice, sea
soned with bits of onion was de
scribed as "good" by my partner.
The adjective seemed to fit.
Anything that the meal might
have lacked was more than made
up for by the dessert menu. The
original mudpie ($1.50) proved
to be a delicious oreo cookie
crust topped with coffee ice
cream sure to satisfy any after
dinner cravings. And the
raspberry cheesecake ($1.95),
equally as good, was creamv but
not so rich as to overwhelm.
Though not extensive, as there
are only four choices, the dessert
menu is definitely a fine ending to
an overall tastv meal.
After dinner we decided to ex
plore further our surroundings.
