## 'Good Soul of Setzuan': degradation & enlightenment 
### ELAINE WANG 
Set in 20th century China,
Bertolt Brecht's The Good Soul of
Setzuan, produced by the Drama
Department and showing this
week in the Little Theatre, aptly
depicts the misery and degrada
tion of poverty. Three gods arrive
in the city of Setzuan in a quest to
find one good person to prove
that the world should continue
and that their commandments
are valued. Chang, the water
seller, meets them and attempts
to find lodging for the tired de
ities, but no one is generous
enough to provide it. Only Shen
Te, the prostitute, helps Chang,
and is later given some money by
Che gods — enough to open her
pwn tobacco shop.
Having found out that Shen Te
has come into sudden riches, a
horde of parasitic relations and
debtors descends upon the wom
an. Shen Te supports all of them
until finally, to protect herself,
she assumes the guise of a shrewd
and brutal male cousin, Shui Ta,
who arrives and puts all the
spongers to work at his tobacco
factory. Meanwhile, Shen Te has
fallen in love with the pilot Yang
Sun, basically an unreliable man.
When she becomes pregnant, her
"cousin" Shui Ta surfaces to run
the business. He is a harsh em

ployer, and soon is accused by
the irate workers of doing away
with Shen Te. A trial is held, with
the gods masquerading as judges.
Demanding that the court be
cleared, Shui Ta reveals himself
to be Shen Te, who then cries out
that no one can be good and re
main good, as well as survive in
this world. The gods in turn
praise Shen Te and congratulate
themselves on having found a
good soul. Relieved and happy,
they ascend home amid Shen Te's
frantic appeals for help.
Brecht ended The Good Soul of
Setzuan there, but the Drama
Department took it further, espe
cially in their innovative presen
tation. Scenes were introduced
via projections onto a cloud
hanging from the ceiling of the
stage — an effect that is simulta
neously strategic and more con
venient than listing over a dozen
scenes and interludes on the pro
eram.
The costumes were suitably
drab, except for the tackily
brilliant robes of the three gods.
With Chinese lanterns perched
upon their heads, they cut a ridic
ulous, but humorous picture.
Opening night began hesitatingly
for the trio; but as they steadily
grew more exhausted from their
world tour, the rapport and flow

of their performances improved.
The tourist antics of the third
god. with his Japanese camera,
was a fun touch, definitely not
missed by an appreciative au
dience.
None of the characters evoked
an overwhelming sense of com
passion. although they are all en
meshed in pitiful existences. The
family of six who came crawling
and insisting to Shen Te that she
feed them was quite onerous (and
therefore well-played).
Several of the character parts
were notable, namely Brun's Shu
Fu and Mrs. Shin (Nike
Doukas). Brun played the
barber, a self-styled philan
thropist — cruel to Chang the
water seller but kind to Shen Te,
whom he wants. And Brun does
it well; a stiff posture and jerky
arm movements enhanced a con
vincing portrayal of the decrepit
man. Doukas, as the widow Shin,
also elicits praise for her per
formance as the nosy, ingratiat
ing and contemptuous person
who ultimately becomes Shen
Te's confidante. Slithering in and
out of scenes, Doukas delivered
Shin's lines with a marvelous
snideness.
The most demanding, how
ever, was the role of Shen
Te/Shui Ta, exceptionally played

by Johanna Dickey. Alternately
dispassionate, gentle and ruth
less, Dickey did not snap abrupt
ly from the kind Shen Te to the
barbarous and calculating Shui
Ta. Rather, one could feel and
see all aspects of her character
while only one was "in charac
ter" or emphasized. Thus, when
Shen Te addresses the audience
and tells them that she must help
the spongers, there is both the
good-hearted woman and the
cold edge of her cousin in opera
tion.
An especially telling and well
executed scene was the interlude
where Shen Te actually changes
into Shui Ta, trading her clothes
for trousers and mask; as she be
comes her cousin, her singing
changes from a soft high tone to a
gratingly low one.
All in all. the production was
excellent. Every bit part had an
amusing moment, and even the
audience got to be part of the dra
ma during the trial scene, when
the characters positioned them
selves in the aisles. The ending
note is the key to the Drama De
partment production of The
Good Soul of Setzuan. While it
doesn't solve Shen Te's problems
or answer her last cries for help, it
is a witty and enlightening con
clusion to the evening.

neously strategic and more con
venient than listing over a dozen
scenes and interludes on the pro
eram.
The costumes were suitably
drab, except for the tackily
brilliant robes of the three gods.
With Chinese lanterns perched
upon their heads, they cut a ridic
ulous, but humorous picture.
Opening night began hesitatingly
for the trio; but as they steadily
grew more exhausted from their
world tour, the rapport and flow

of their performances improved.
The tourist antics of the third
god. with his Japanese camera,
was a fun touch, definitely not
missed by an appreciative au
dience.
None of the characters evoked
an overwhelming sense of com
passion. although they are all en
meshed in pitiful existences. The
family of six who came crawling
and insisting to Shen Te that she
feed them was quite onerous (and
therefore well-played).
Several of the character parts
were notable, namely Brun's Shu
Fu and Mrs. Shin (Nike
Doukas). Brun played the
barber, a self-styled philan
thropist — cruel to Chang the
water seller but kind to Shen Te,
whom he wants. And Brun does
it well; a stiff posture and jerky
arm movements enhanced a con
vincing portrayal of the decrepit
man. Doukas, as the widow Shin,
also elicits praise for her per
formance as the nosy, ingratiat
ing and contemptuous person
who ultimately becomes Shen
Te's confidante. Slithering in and
out of scenes, Doukas delivered
Shin's lines with a marvelous
snideness.
The most demanding, how
ever, was the role of Shen
Te/Shui Ta, exceptionally played

by Johanna Dickey. Alternately
dispassionate, gentle and ruth
less, Dickey did not snap abrupt
ly from the kind Shen Te to the
barbarous and calculating Shui
Ta. Rather, one could feel and
see all aspects of her character
while only one was "in charac
ter" or emphasized. Thus, when
Shen Te addresses the audience
and tells them that she must help
the spongers, there is both the
good-hearted woman and the
cold edge of her cousin in opera
tion.
An especially telling and well
executed scene was the interlude
where Shen Te actually changes
into Shui Ta, trading her clothes
for trousers and mask; as she be
comes her cousin, her singing
changes from a soft high tone to a
gratingly low one.
All in all. the production was
excellent. Every bit part had an
amusing moment, and even the
audience got to be part of the dra
ma during the trial scene, when
the characters positioned them
selves in the aisles. The ending
note is the key to the Drama De
partment production of The
Good Soul of Setzuan. While it
doesn't solve Shen Te's problems
or answer her last cries for help, it
is a witty and enlightening con
clusion to the evening.

Set in 20th century China,
Bertolt Brecht's The Good Soul of
Setzuan, produced by the Drama
Department and showing this
week in the Little Theatre, aptly
depicts the misery and degrada
tion of poverty. Three gods arrive
in the city of Setzuan in a quest to
find one good person to prove
that the world should continue
and that their commandments
are valued. Chang, the water
seller, meets them and attempts
to find lodging for the tired de
ities, but no one is generous
enough to provide it. Only Shen
Te, the prostitute, helps Chang,
and is later given some money by
Che gods — enough to open her
pwn tobacco shop.
Having found out that Shen Te
has come into sudden riches, a
horde of parasitic relations and
debtors descends upon the wom
an. Shen Te supports all of them
until finally, to protect herself,
she assumes the guise of a shrewd
and brutal male cousin, Shui Ta,
who arrives and puts all the
spongers to work at his tobacco
factory. Meanwhile, Shen Te has
fallen in love with the pilot Yang
Sun, basically an unreliable man.
When she becomes pregnant, her
"cousin" Shui Ta surfaces to run
the business. He is a harsh em

ployer, and soon is accused by
the irate workers of doing away
with Shen Te. A trial is held, with
the gods masquerading as judges.
Demanding that the court be
cleared, Shui Ta reveals himself
to be Shen Te, who then cries out
that no one can be good and re
main good, as well as survive in
this world. The gods in turn
praise Shen Te and congratulate
themselves on having found a
good soul. Relieved and happy,
they ascend home amid Shen Te's
frantic appeals for help.
Brecht ended The Good Soul of
Setzuan there, but the Drama
Department took it further, espe
cially in their innovative presen
tation. Scenes were introduced
via projections onto a cloud
hanging from the ceiling of the
stage — an effect that is simulta
neously strategic and more con
venient than listing over a dozen
scenes and interludes on the pro
