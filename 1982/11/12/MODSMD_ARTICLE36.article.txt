# Peterson and Hancock: mentor and apprentice

### MARK ZEIGLER 
Oscar Peterson/Herbie Hancock
Davies Symphony Hall
Monday, November 8
Oscar Peterson didn't say a
word to the packed Davies
Symphony Hall crowd Mon
day night during his solo key
board performance as part of
the Kool Jazz Festival. He
didn't announce the names of
his songs. He didn't even say
"thank you" to the assorted
standing ovations he received.
Then again, he didn't have to.
Oscar Peterson, you see,
speaks through his piano, be it
part of his jazz trio or just by
itself. He thanks the crowd by
standing up, bowing once or
twice and then breaking out a
huge, cheek to cheek smile.
And as for announcing song
titles, who cares? Music is mu
sic; knowing the names of the
tunes played isn't going to
make the concert better or
worse.
for Peterson was
keyboardist Herbie Hancock,
known more for his electric
jazz/fusion efforts than his
solo piano abilities. But Han
cock impressed even the most
critical ears, not necessarily
bv the tunes he played, but by
the smooth ease with which
his hands caressed the keys.
Hancock, however, was ob
viously a bit fazed when he
walked onto the large Davies
Symphony Hall stage, barren
exempt for the huge concert
grand. He could have felt
no:h ; r.g but out of place in a
matching suit in front of an

audience of evening-dressers
much older than him sitting in
one of America's premier
symphony halls. A smoky
nightclub in a back alley this
wasn't.
Hancock approached the
microphone to acknowledge
the cheers for his entrance and
opened his mouth, but no
words came out. Hancock
had just realized the Davies
seating configuration includes
seats in front of and behind the
stage — something else he
wasn't used to.
But what was new to Han
cock was home to Peterson,
the granddad of active jazz pi
anists. Accordingly, Peterson
walked out, bowed, smiled,
sal at the piano and began to
play. When he was finished,
he stood up, bowed and
smiled to the roaring crowd
and walked off the stage.
If anything, Hancock had a
thing or two to learn from Pe
terson about giving a per
formance; Hancock played
the role of the apprentice and
Peterson the mentor.
True to his role as the youth
in the show, Hancock dis
played the radical spontaneity
and individualism expected of
him. After his second tune, he
decided, on the spot, to do
something "a little different."
Instead of immediately
playing his third and final
tune, "Dolphin Dance," Han
cock wanted to play inside the
piano — anything but the 88
keys — and proceeded to
pound and strum the innards

of the concert grand much like
a doctor inspecting a patient's
body.
Before he embarked on this
wood-pounding escapade,
however, Hancock joked that
critics probably would think
that "now he thinks he's mas
tered the keys and is moving
inside the piano." Hancock
replied with his most modest
voice, "Well, I haven't."
No, he hasn't, but he sure as
hell did a good job faking it.
Although he was rattled by
the situation, he was com
fortable at the piano, showing
that perhaps his true love lies
in straight jazz piano and not
his money-making ventures in
jazz/fusion. It was comfort
ing to see such a fine main
stream artist cross back over
from the land that has
brought so much wealth but
not so much musical satisfac
tion.
Peterson, on the other
hand, is as close to "mastering
the keys" as one gets. Al
though he also improvised, he
did so in a more conservative
tone. Peterson used his re
fined spontaneity to enhance
his songs — so smoothly that
the audience could barely no
tice the change from melody
to improvisation.
Peterson does everything
right. He plavs flawlessly, im
provises originally and, above
all, does his job — entertains
the audience. People didn't
pay 17 bucks a head for noth
ing.

Just saying Peterson is a
keyboard god (his nickname
is Hercules) is easy enough;
classifying the music he plavs
is a different storv, however.
The Kool Ja/z Festival pro
moters called the evening a pi
ano summit, indicating both
artists would plav jazz piano.
Not so.
Indeed Hancock plaved a -
Wayne Shorter tune as part of
his "jazz" piano set. But Pe
terson's songs and style are
closer to blues or even ragtime
paino. Peterson's pieces were
much shorter and more up
beat than Hancock's and fea
tured much more coherent
rhythms. Besides, Hancock's
music is "serious," and Peter
son's fun.
The most noticeable dif
ference between the two was
their left hands. While Han
cock's usually helped out in
the melody, Peterson's gave a
legitimate bass line to his •
songs. You could clap to Pe- •
terson's tunes, not to Han
cock's.
After each of the two had
performed solo, thev reap
peared for three duets.
Though the songs themselves
weren't spectacular, the mere
fact that Peterson and Han
cock were on the same stage
doing the same thing made it
worthwhile.
There were no electric
basses, no synthesizers and no
bands. There were just two pi- •
anos and two great pianists.

stream artist cross back over
from the land that has
brought so much wealth but
not so much musical satisfac
tion.
Peterson, on the other
hand, is as close to "mastering
the keys" as one gets. Al
though he also improvised, he
did so in a more conservative
tone. Peterson used his re
fined spontaneity to enhance
his songs — so smoothly that
the audience could barely no
tice the change from melody
to improvisation.
Peterson does everything
right. He plavs flawlessly, im
provises originally and, above
all, does his job — entertains
the audience. People didn't
pay 17 bucks a head for noth
ing.

Just saying Peterson is a
keyboard god (his nickname
is Hercules) is easy enough;
classifying the music he plavs
is a different storv, however.
The Kool Ja/z Festival pro
moters called the evening a pi
ano summit, indicating both
artists would plav jazz piano.
Not so.
Indeed Hancock plaved a -
Wayne Shorter tune as part of
his "jazz" piano set. But Pe
terson's songs and style are
closer to blues or even ragtime
paino. Peterson's pieces were
much shorter and more up
beat than Hancock's and fea
tured much more coherent
rhythms. Besides, Hancock's
music is "serious," and Peter
son's fun.
The most noticeable dif
ference between the two was
their left hands. While Han
cock's usually helped out in
the melody, Peterson's gave a
legitimate bass line to his •
songs. You could clap to Pe- •
terson's tunes, not to Han
cock's.
After each of the two had
performed solo, thev reap
peared for three duets.
Though the songs themselves
weren't spectacular, the mere
fact that Peterson and Han
cock were on the same stage
doing the same thing made it
worthwhile.
There were no electric
basses, no synthesizers and no
bands. There were just two pi- •
anos and two great pianists.

Oscar Peterson/Herbie Hancock
Davies Symphony Hall
Monday, November 8
Oscar Peterson didn't say a
word to the packed Davies
Symphony Hall crowd Mon
day night during his solo key
board performance as part of
the Kool Jazz Festival. He
didn't announce the names of
his songs. He didn't even say
"thank you" to the assorted
standing ovations he received.
Then again, he didn't have to.
Oscar Peterson, you see,
speaks through his piano, be it
part of his jazz trio or just by
itself. He thanks the crowd by
standing up, bowing once or
twice and then breaking out a
huge, cheek to cheek smile.
And as for announcing song
titles, who cares? Music is mu
sic; knowing the names of the
tunes played isn't going to
make the concert better or
worse.
for Peterson was
keyboardist Herbie Hancock,
known more for his electric
jazz/fusion efforts than his
solo piano abilities. But Han
cock impressed even the most
critical ears, not necessarily
bv the tunes he played, but by
the smooth ease with which
his hands caressed the keys.
Hancock, however, was ob
viously a bit fazed when he
walked onto the large Davies
Symphony Hall stage, barren
exempt for the huge concert
grand. He could have felt
no:h ; r.g but out of place in a
matching suit in front of an

audience of evening-dressers
much older than him sitting in
one of America's premier
symphony halls. A smoky
nightclub in a back alley this
wasn't.
Hancock approached the
microphone to acknowledge
the cheers for his entrance and
opened his mouth, but no
words came out. Hancock
had just realized the Davies
seating configuration includes
seats in front of and behind the
stage — something else he
wasn't used to.
But what was new to Han
cock was home to Peterson,
the granddad of active jazz pi
anists. Accordingly, Peterson
walked out, bowed, smiled,
sal at the piano and began to
play. When he was finished,
he stood up, bowed and
smiled to the roaring crowd
and walked off the stage.
If anything, Hancock had a
thing or two to learn from Pe
terson about giving a per
formance; Hancock played
the role of the apprentice and
Peterson the mentor.
True to his role as the youth
in the show, Hancock dis
played the radical spontaneity
and individualism expected of
him. After his second tune, he
decided, on the spot, to do
something "a little different."
Instead of immediately
playing his third and final
tune, "Dolphin Dance," Han
cock wanted to play inside the
piano — anything but the 88
keys — and proceeded to
pound and strum the innards

of the concert grand much like
a doctor inspecting a patient's
body.
Before he embarked on this
wood-pounding escapade,
however, Hancock joked that
critics probably would think
that "now he thinks he's mas
tered the keys and is moving
inside the piano." Hancock
replied with his most modest
voice, "Well, I haven't."
No, he hasn't, but he sure as
hell did a good job faking it.
Although he was rattled by
the situation, he was com
fortable at the piano, showing
that perhaps his true love lies
in straight jazz piano and not
his money-making ventures in
jazz/fusion. It was comfort
ing to see such a fine main
stream artist cross back over
from the land that has
brought so much wealth but
not so much musical satisfac
tion.
