"The movie breakthrough
has finally come."
— Pauline Kael on Last
Tango in Paris

★ Highly recommended

Last Tango in Paris (1973)
Aquarius, Palo Alto *
Bernardo Bertolucci's study of
a neurotic sexual relationship be
tween a middle-aged man — a
one-time Bohemian whose wife
has just committed suicide — and
a young French bourgeoise may
be the greatest film of the last 20
years. No one has ever explored
sexuality in movies in as intimate
and unrelenting a manner.
Bertolucci and Marlon Brando,
who plays the tragic hero, are
surely the most amazing director
actor combination since D.W.
Griffith and Lillian Gish; to de
scribe what Brando does for this
movie would require searching
for new superlatives. With Maria
Schneider, Jean-Pierre Leaud,
Maria Michi and Massimo Girot
ti; screenplay by Bertolucci and
Franco Arcalli; photographed by
Vittorio Storaro; music by Gato
Barbieri. The paintings in the
opening credits are by Francis
Bacon.
The Importance of Being
Earnest (1952) ★
Festival, Palo Alto
Anthony Asquith's screen ver
sion of the delirious Oscar Wilde
play — perhaps the funniest com
edy ever written — is a testament
to the virtues of filmed theater:
who could ever hope to see an
Earnest on any stage with a cast
like this one? Edith Evans, in pur
ple, pink and green, is Lady
Bracknell; Michael Redgrave is
Jack; Joan Greenwood, her vel
vety voice a wicked parody of ov
ercultivated actresses like Greer
Garson, is Gwendolyn; Dorothy
Tutin is Cicely; Margaret
Rutherford is Miss Prism; Miles
Malleson is Canon Chasuble —
and all of them are superb. Only
Michael Denison, as Algernon,
gives a disappointing per
formance.
Plays through Wednesday with
Pygmalion.
The Eagle (1926)
Fox, Redwood City
Rudolph Valentino's
penultimate movie, based on a
Pushkin story, parodies the ro
mantic melodramas that made
him famous. He plays a 19th-cen
tury Russian variation on Robin
Hood, an avenger nicknamed
"The Black Eagle,"and he gets to
• wear military outfits and fur hats
(he looks smashing in them) and
make love to Vilma Banky, who
has perfect little features. It's a sil
ly, pleasant spoof: the director,
Clarence Brown, does a nice job
with the actors and maintains a
good pace. Written by Hans Kra
1y and designed by William Cam
eron Menzies.
Plays Wednesday only.
It Came from Hollywood
Palo Alto Square, Palo Alto
Andrew Salt and Malcolm Leo
assembled this compilation of bits
from what they feel are the worst
movies of all time. Presumably
they were limited by the attitude
of other producers and directors
to this project, and so could not
focus on unforgettable moments
from expensive Hollywood
fiascoes like The Sandpiper and
Tora! Tora! Toral; therefore near
ly everything in the collection
looks cheap. And most of it is un
mistakably dreadful, especially
the scenes from Plan 9from Outer
Space and Mars Wants Women.
Narrated by Dan Aykroyd, Gilda
Radner, John Candy and Cheech
& Chong.

The Seven Samurai (1954) ★
Annenberg Auditorium
Akira Kurosawa's lusty, spec
tacular adventure, set amid the
civil wars in 16th-century Japan.
A community of farmers, slowly
starving under the double burden
of land taxes and the raids of
brigands, hires samurai to protect
them, and swords really start to
flv. The characters have a funny,
foolish braggadocio, and the ac
tors (Toshiro Mifune, Takashi
Shimura, Yoshio Inaba, etc.) give
stylized performances remi
niscent of the silent comedies. The
real star, of course, is Kurosawa,
who displays the kind of witty
mastery of film technique that
still makes audiences grin. (N. 8.:
The original version of The Seven
Samurai weighed in at three-and
a-half hours; this is the edited
print, which runs for two hours
and 11 minutes.)
Plays Thursday evening.
Horse Feathers (1932) ★
Bishop Auditorium
The Marx Brothers produced
their purest, most unrestrained
comedies at Paramount in the ear
ly days of the talkies. This send
up of collegiate musicals was their
fourth picture and, except for
Duck Soup, it is probably their
best. This is the one in which
Harpo brings a fish with a sword
stuck through it to the door of a
speakeasy in order to gain admit
tance (the password is
"swordfish") and Groucho sings
"Whatever it is, I'm against it."
He plays Professor Quincy
Adams Flagstaff, president of
Huxley College; Chico and
Harpo sign up as students so they
can play in the big football game
against Darwin, and Zeppo plays
Flagstaff's son(!). With Thelma
Todd, David Landau, Robert
Greig, James Pierce and Nat
Pendleton; screenplay by Bert
Kalmar, Harry Ruby, S.J. Per
elman & Will Johnstone; songs by
Kalmar & Ruby; directed by
Norman McLeod.
Plays tonight.
The Best Little Whorehouse in
Texas
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Colin Higgins may be the worst
director in Hollywood, but his in
exorable baseness seems to tap
into some kind of pop cultural
mainstream: everything he does
makes money. He worked on the
script of this movie, too, with the
authors of the Broadway musical
it's drawn from, Larry L. King
and Peter Masterson (King wrote
the Playboy article that inspired
the show); the dialogue alternates
between Academy Awards show
type filler and the kind of double
entendres one usually hears at cir
cumcisions. It's a respectable
movie, though — stupefyingly re
spectable. Dolly Parton makes
her initial entrance down a stair
case in a red gown, like Barbra
Streisand in Hello, Dolly! (the pic
ture echoes The Music Man in
other spots); as the madam, she
looks terrific and is intensely
likable. Her leading man is Burt
Reynolds, who plays the local
sheriff with an unappealing reti
cence. Glazed-looking Dom De-
Luise and Jim Nabors, in the
Andy Devine role, give grotesque
performances, but the movie is
momentarily redeemed when
Charles Durning, as the gleefully
evasive governor, sings and
dances "Sidestep."
Plays tomorrow only with
Blazing Saddles.

Oliver! (1968) *
New Varsity, Palo Alto
A great movie musical. In
adapting the hit Lionel Bart
show, screenwriter Vernon Harris
wisely returned to Dickens: the
dialogue is right out of Oliver
Twist. And the director, Carol
Reed, somehow managed to cap
ture both the Dickensian spirit
and the essence of musical com
edy; when you think of how many
■wrong turns the movie could have
made, the results seem mirac
ulous. (Just compare it to most of
the big-budget musicals Holly
wood was putting out in the same
era.) The magnificent cast fea
tures Ron Moody as Fagin, Ol
iver Reed as Bill Sykes, Shani
Wallis as Nancy, Harry Secombe
as Mr. Bumble, Mark Lester as
Oliver, and Jack Wild as the
Artful Dodger; Onna White did
the spectacular choreography and
John Box the lovely designs. This
deserving popular success, proba
bly Carol Reed's best movie after
The Third Man. was also his last
blaze of glory; though he lived un
til 1976, he never again rose to
such heights.
Plays Sunday only with Annie.
Breathless (1961) *
Fox, Redwood City
"It's normal: squealers squeal,
burglars burgle, killers kill and
lovers love," says Michel Poic
card (Jean-Paul Belmondo), the
hero of Jean-Luc Godard's vivify
ing film, one of the landmarks of
the French New Wave. LikeTruf
faut in Shoot the Piano Player,
Godard recasts the American
gangster pictures so beloved of
post-war French audiences in a
new, startling mold that is at once
jokey, self-referential, and unset
tling. The main characters,
Michel and his beautifully, moral
ly blank girl friend Patricia (Jean
Seberg), are in love with style. A
great film, with a hypnotic per
formance from Belmondo.
Plays Thursday only with King
of Hearts.
Pygmalion (1938) ★
Festival, Palo Alto
Anthony Asquith and Leslie
Howard co-directed this justifi
ably famous film version of the
Shaw play; it may be the only time
Shaw has been so well served in
the movies. (Pygmalion is also
likely his most filmable script.)
Howard is a witty, romantic Pro
fessor Higgins — he personalizes
his pipe in so distinctive a manner
that after you've seen this per
formance, you may not be able to
imagine him without one — and
her portrayal of Eliza Dolittle
made Wendy Hiller a star. With
Wilfrid Lawson, Scott Sun
derland, Marie Lohr, David Tree
and Esme Percy.
Plays through Wednesday with
The Importance of Being Earnest.
Up in Smoke (1978)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
The quest for great dope is the
theme of this comedy, in which
Cheech Martin and Tommy
Chong make their movie debut.
Silly as it is, it's relaxed and pleas
ant; the effects of the weed
Cheech and Chong keep smoking
seem to get to the audience as
well. Among movies of this type
— jokey sophomoric hits like
Animal House — this is probably
the best.
Plays today only with Things
Are Tough All Over and Cheech
and Chong's Nice Dreams.

The Grapes of Wrath (1940)
New Varsity, Palo Alto ★
Like the John Steinbeck novel,
John Ford's famous screen ver
sion isn't as good as its reputa
tion, but it's made with such inte
grity and singleness of vision, and
it's so emotionally charged, that
you remember it more vividly
than a lot of better pictures. The
biblical-hillbilly dialogue is im
possible, and most of the acting is
arresting in all the wrong ways,
but Henry Fonda is a terrific Tom
Joad. Gregg Toland photo
graphed, the year before he did
Citizen Kane; it's easy to see why
he was the hottest young camer
aman in Hollywood. (His death in
1948, at the age of 44, was a real
tragedy.) With Jane Darwell,
John Carradine, Charley
Grapewin, Dorris Bowdon, Rus
sell Simpson, Zeffie Tilbury, O.Z.
Whitehead, John Qualen and Ed
die Quillan.
Plays Tuesday and Wednesday
with Mr. Roberts.
L'Awentura (1961) ★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Monica Vitti's restless walk on
the beach might be the emblem of
Michelangelo Antonioni's mas
terpiece — the one great film
about the anomie and alienation
of the late '50s and early '60s. The
wealthy protagonists are true
drifters: nothing binds them to
each other for very long, and their
tragedy is that they can still feel
the loss of what was once impor
tant to them (the capacity to find
meaning in their lives, perhaps, or
to hold onto it). Vitti is simply
magnificent in the central role of
Claudia, and Gabriele Ferzetti (as
Sandro) and Lea Massari (as
Anna, the woman who disap
pears) givd expert performances.
This film may remind you of Re
noir's The Rules of the Game, a
picture as closely bound up with
the last days before the Second
World War as L'Awentura is with
its era.
Plays Thursday only with
Juliet of the Spirits.

Richard Prvor I.ive on the
Sunset Strip *
Kresge Auditorium
Richard Prvor's 25-minute
I'reebuse routine mav represent
the farthest leap anv comic has
taken since Lenny Bruce: simulta
neously hilarious and harrowing,
it plays so many disparate emo
tional chords that one doesn't
know exactly how to respond to
it. The rest of this filmed night
club show (directed by Joe
Lavton and shot by Haskell Wex
ler) isn't up to Richard Pryor Live
in Concert — there are a few seri
ous moments that come across as
sentimental — but most of it is
marvellous, and liberating.
Plays tomorrow evening.
Ragtime
Memorial Auditorium
E.L. Doctorow's deftly ironic
novel, in which celebrities and fic
tive personalities touch each oth
er's lives in mysterious, unan
ticipated ways, is annihilated by
director Milos Fornian and
screenwriter Michael Weller.
They don't seem to have just mis
understood the book; one won
ders if they've even read it. For
man's explicit style functions like
a wrecker's ball levelled at scene
after scene; he turns the irony into
burlesque — cruel burlesque in
which the characters (and the ac
tors) suffer. The cast of (mostly)
excellent actors Includes James
Cagnev, Mary Steenburgen,
James Olson, Brad Dourif, Moses
Gunn, Elizabeth McGovern,
Howard E. Rollins, Robert Joy,
Kenneth McMillan and Debbie
Allen; Forman seems so serenely
unaware of what they can do that
he stifles everyone except for
Cagnev, Dourif and McMillan.
Plavs Sunday evening.

a-half hours; this is the edited
print, which runs for two hours
and 11 minutes.)
Plays Thursday evening.
Horse Feathers (1932) ★
Bishop Auditorium
The Marx Brothers produced
their purest, most unrestrained
comedies at Paramount in the ear
ly days of the talkies. This send
up of collegiate musicals was their
fourth picture and, except for
Duck Soup, it is probably their
best. This is the one in which
Harpo brings a fish with a sword
stuck through it to the door of a
speakeasy in order to gain admit
tance (the password is
"swordfish") and Groucho sings
"Whatever it is, I'm against it."
He plays Professor Quincy
Adams Flagstaff, president of
Huxley College; Chico and
Harpo sign up as students so they
can play in the big football game
against Darwin, and Zeppo plays
Flagstaff's son(!). With Thelma
Todd, David Landau, Robert
Greig, James Pierce and Nat
Pendleton; screenplay by Bert
Kalmar, Harry Ruby, S.J. Per
elman & Will Johnstone; songs by
Kalmar & Ruby; directed by
Norman McLeod.
Plays tonight.
The Best Little Whorehouse in
Texas
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Colin Higgins may be the worst
director in Hollywood, but his in
exorable baseness seems to tap
into some kind of pop cultural
mainstream: everything he does
makes money. He worked on the
script of this movie, too, with the
authors of the Broadway musical
it's drawn from, Larry L. King
and Peter Masterson (King wrote
the Playboy article that inspired
the show); the dialogue alternates
between Academy Awards show
type filler and the kind of double
entendres one usually hears at cir
cumcisions. It's a respectable
movie, though — stupefyingly re
spectable. Dolly Parton makes
her initial entrance down a stair
case in a red gown, like Barbra
Streisand in Hello, Dolly! (the pic
ture echoes The Music Man in
other spots); as the madam, she
looks terrific and is intensely
likable. Her leading man is Burt
Reynolds, who plays the local
sheriff with an unappealing reti
cence. Glazed-looking Dom De-
Luise and Jim Nabors, in the
Andy Devine role, give grotesque
performances, but the movie is
momentarily redeemed when
Charles Durning, as the gleefully
evasive governor, sings and
dances "Sidestep."
Plays tomorrow only with
Blazing Saddles.

Oliver! (1968) *
New Varsity, Palo Alto
A great movie musical. In
adapting the hit Lionel Bart
show, screenwriter Vernon Harris
wisely returned to Dickens: the
dialogue is right out of Oliver
Twist. And the director, Carol
Reed, somehow managed to cap
ture both the Dickensian spirit
and the essence of musical com
edy; when you think of how many
■wrong turns the movie could have
made, the results seem mirac
ulous. (Just compare it to most of
the big-budget musicals Holly
wood was putting out in the same
era.) The magnificent cast fea
tures Ron Moody as Fagin, Ol
iver Reed as Bill Sykes, Shani
Wallis as Nancy, Harry Secombe
as Mr. Bumble, Mark Lester as
Oliver, and Jack Wild as the
Artful Dodger; Onna White did
the spectacular choreography and
John Box the lovely designs. This
deserving popular success, proba
bly Carol Reed's best movie after
The Third Man. was also his last
blaze of glory; though he lived un
til 1976, he never again rose to
such heights.
Plays Sunday only with Annie.
Breathless (1961) *
Fox, Redwood City
"It's normal: squealers squeal,
burglars burgle, killers kill and
lovers love," says Michel Poic
card (Jean-Paul Belmondo), the
hero of Jean-Luc Godard's vivify
ing film, one of the landmarks of
the French New Wave. LikeTruf
faut in Shoot the Piano Player,
Godard recasts the American
gangster pictures so beloved of
post-war French audiences in a
new, startling mold that is at once
jokey, self-referential, and unset
tling. The main characters,
Michel and his beautifully, moral
ly blank girl friend Patricia (Jean
Seberg), are in love with style. A
great film, with a hypnotic per
formance from Belmondo.
Plays Thursday only with King
of Hearts.
Pygmalion (1938) ★
Festival, Palo Alto
Anthony Asquith and Leslie
Howard co-directed this justifi
ably famous film version of the
Shaw play; it may be the only time
Shaw has been so well served in
the movies. (Pygmalion is also
likely his most filmable script.)
Howard is a witty, romantic Pro
fessor Higgins — he personalizes
his pipe in so distinctive a manner
that after you've seen this per
formance, you may not be able to
imagine him without one — and
her portrayal of Eliza Dolittle
made Wendy Hiller a star. With
Wilfrid Lawson, Scott Sun
derland, Marie Lohr, David Tree
and Esme Percy.
Plays through Wednesday with
The Importance of Being Earnest.
Up in Smoke (1978)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
The quest for great dope is the
theme of this comedy, in which
Cheech Martin and Tommy
Chong make their movie debut.
Silly as it is, it's relaxed and pleas
ant; the effects of the weed
Cheech and Chong keep smoking
seem to get to the audience as
well. Among movies of this type
— jokey sophomoric hits like
Animal House — this is probably
the best.
Plays today only with Things
Are Tough All Over and Cheech
and Chong's Nice Dreams.

The Grapes of Wrath (1940)
New Varsity, Palo Alto ★
Like the John Steinbeck novel,
John Ford's famous screen ver
sion isn't as good as its reputa
tion, but it's made with such inte
grity and singleness of vision, and
it's so emotionally charged, that
you remember it more vividly
than a lot of better pictures. The
biblical-hillbilly dialogue is im
possible, and most of the acting is
arresting in all the wrong ways,
but Henry Fonda is a terrific Tom
Joad. Gregg Toland photo
graphed, the year before he did
Citizen Kane; it's easy to see why
he was the hottest young camer
aman in Hollywood. (His death in
1948, at the age of 44, was a real
tragedy.) With Jane Darwell,
John Carradine, Charley
Grapewin, Dorris Bowdon, Rus
sell Simpson, Zeffie Tilbury, O.Z.
Whitehead, John Qualen and Ed
die Quillan.
Plays Tuesday and Wednesday
with Mr. Roberts.
L'Awentura (1961) ★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Monica Vitti's restless walk on
the beach might be the emblem of
Michelangelo Antonioni's mas
terpiece — the one great film
about the anomie and alienation
of the late '50s and early '60s. The
wealthy protagonists are true
drifters: nothing binds them to
each other for very long, and their
tragedy is that they can still feel
the loss of what was once impor
tant to them (the capacity to find
meaning in their lives, perhaps, or
to hold onto it). Vitti is simply
magnificent in the central role of
Claudia, and Gabriele Ferzetti (as
Sandro) and Lea Massari (as
Anna, the woman who disap
pears) givd expert performances.
This film may remind you of Re
noir's The Rules of the Game, a
picture as closely bound up with
the last days before the Second
World War as L'Awentura is with
its era.
Plays Thursday only with
Juliet of the Spirits.

Richard Prvor I.ive on the
Sunset Strip *
Kresge Auditorium
Richard Prvor's 25-minute
I'reebuse routine mav represent
the farthest leap anv comic has
taken since Lenny Bruce: simulta
neously hilarious and harrowing,
it plays so many disparate emo
tional chords that one doesn't
know exactly how to respond to
it. The rest of this filmed night
club show (directed by Joe
Lavton and shot by Haskell Wex
ler) isn't up to Richard Pryor Live
in Concert — there are a few seri
ous moments that come across as
sentimental — but most of it is
marvellous, and liberating.
Plays tomorrow evening.
Ragtime
Memorial Auditorium
E.L. Doctorow's deftly ironic
novel, in which celebrities and fic
tive personalities touch each oth
er's lives in mysterious, unan
ticipated ways, is annihilated by
director Milos Fornian and
screenwriter Michael Weller.
They don't seem to have just mis
understood the book; one won
ders if they've even read it. For
man's explicit style functions like
a wrecker's ball levelled at scene
after scene; he turns the irony into
burlesque — cruel burlesque in
which the characters (and the ac
tors) suffer. The cast of (mostly)
excellent actors Includes James
Cagnev, Mary Steenburgen,
James Olson, Brad Dourif, Moses
Gunn, Elizabeth McGovern,
Howard E. Rollins, Robert Joy,
Kenneth McMillan and Debbie
Allen; Forman seems so serenely
unaware of what they can do that
he stifles everyone except for
Cagnev, Dourif and McMillan.
Plavs Sunday evening.
Reviews by Steve Vineherg

"The movie breakthrough
has finally come."
— Pauline Kael on Last
Tango in Paris

★ Highly recommended

Last Tango in Paris (1973)
Aquarius, Palo Alto *
Bernardo Bertolucci's study of
a neurotic sexual relationship be
tween a middle-aged man — a
one-time Bohemian whose wife
has just committed suicide — and
a young French bourgeoise may
be the greatest film of the last 20
years. No one has ever explored
sexuality in movies in as intimate
and unrelenting a manner.
Bertolucci and Marlon Brando,
who plays the tragic hero, are
surely the most amazing director
actor combination since D.W.
Griffith and Lillian Gish; to de
scribe what Brando does for this
movie would require searching
for new superlatives. With Maria
Schneider, Jean-Pierre Leaud,
Maria Michi and Massimo Girot
ti; screenplay by Bertolucci and
Franco Arcalli; photographed by
Vittorio Storaro; music by Gato
Barbieri. The paintings in the
opening credits are by Francis
Bacon.
The Importance of Being
Earnest (1952) ★
Festival, Palo Alto
Anthony Asquith's screen ver
sion of the delirious Oscar Wilde
play — perhaps the funniest com
edy ever written — is a testament
to the virtues of filmed theater:
who could ever hope to see an
Earnest on any stage with a cast
like this one? Edith Evans, in pur
ple, pink and green, is Lady
Bracknell; Michael Redgrave is
Jack; Joan Greenwood, her vel
vety voice a wicked parody of ov
ercultivated actresses like Greer
Garson, is Gwendolyn; Dorothy
Tutin is Cicely; Margaret
Rutherford is Miss Prism; Miles
Malleson is Canon Chasuble —
and all of them are superb. Only
Michael Denison, as Algernon,
gives a disappointing per
formance.
Plays through Wednesday with
Pygmalion.
The Eagle (1926)
Fox, Redwood City
Rudolph Valentino's
penultimate movie, based on a
Pushkin story, parodies the ro
mantic melodramas that made
him famous. He plays a 19th-cen
tury Russian variation on Robin
Hood, an avenger nicknamed
"The Black Eagle,"and he gets to
• wear military outfits and fur hats
(he looks smashing in them) and
make love to Vilma Banky, who
has perfect little features. It's a sil
ly, pleasant spoof: the director,
Clarence Brown, does a nice job
with the actors and maintains a
good pace. Written by Hans Kra
1y and designed by William Cam
eron Menzies.
Plays Wednesday only.
It Came from Hollywood
Palo Alto Square, Palo Alto
Andrew Salt and Malcolm Leo
assembled this compilation of bits
from what they feel are the worst
movies of all time. Presumably
they were limited by the attitude
of other producers and directors
to this project, and so could not
focus on unforgettable moments
from expensive Hollywood
fiascoes like The Sandpiper and
Tora! Tora! Toral; therefore near
ly everything in the collection
looks cheap. And most of it is un
mistakably dreadful, especially
the scenes from Plan 9from Outer
Space and Mars Wants Women.
Narrated by Dan Aykroyd, Gilda
Radner, John Candy and Cheech
& Chong.

The Seven Samurai (1954) ★
Annenberg Auditorium
Akira Kurosawa's lusty, spec
tacular adventure, set amid the
civil wars in 16th-century Japan.
A community of farmers, slowly
starving under the double burden
of land taxes and the raids of
brigands, hires samurai to protect
them, and swords really start to
flv. The characters have a funny,
foolish braggadocio, and the ac
tors (Toshiro Mifune, Takashi
Shimura, Yoshio Inaba, etc.) give
stylized performances remi
niscent of the silent comedies. The
real star, of course, is Kurosawa,
who displays the kind of witty
mastery of film technique that
still makes audiences grin. (N. 8.:
The original version of The Seven
Samurai weighed in at three-and

new, startling mold that is at once
jokey, self-referential, and unset
tling. The main characters,
Michel and his beautifully, moral
ly blank girl friend Patricia (Jean
Seberg), are in love with style. A
great film, with a hypnotic per
formance from Belmondo.
Plays Thursday only with King
of Hearts.
Pygmalion (1938) ★
Festival, Palo Alto
Anthony Asquith and Leslie
Howard co-directed this justifi
ably famous film version of the
Shaw play; it may be the only time
Shaw has been so well served in
the movies. (Pygmalion is also
likely his most filmable script.)
Howard is a witty, romantic Pro
fessor Higgins — he personalizes
his pipe in so distinctive a manner
that after you've seen this per
formance, you may not be able to
imagine him without one — and
her portrayal of Eliza Dolittle
made Wendy Hiller a star. With
Wilfrid Lawson, Scott Sun
derland, Marie Lohr, David Tree
and Esme Percy.
Plays through Wednesday with
The Importance of Being Earnest.
Up in Smoke (1978)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
The quest for great dope is the
theme of this comedy, in which
Cheech Martin and Tommy
Chong make their movie debut.
Silly as it is, it's relaxed and pleas
ant; the effects of the weed
Cheech and Chong keep smoking
seem to get to the audience as
well. Among movies of this type
— jokey sophomoric hits like
Animal House — this is probably
the best.
Plays today only with Things
Are Tough All Over and Cheech
and Chong's Nice Dreams.

The Grapes of Wrath (1940)
New Varsity, Palo Alto ★
Like the John Steinbeck novel,
John Ford's famous screen ver
sion isn't as good as its reputa
tion, but it's made with such inte
grity and singleness of vision, and
it's so emotionally charged, that
you remember it more vividly
than a lot of better pictures. The
biblical-hillbilly dialogue is im
possible, and most of the acting is
arresting in all the wrong ways,
but Henry Fonda is a terrific Tom
Joad. Gregg Toland photo
graphed, the year before he did
Citizen Kane; it's easy to see why
he was the hottest young camer
aman in Hollywood. (His death in
1948, at the age of 44, was a real
tragedy.) With Jane Darwell,
John Carradine, Charley
Grapewin, Dorris Bowdon, Rus
sell Simpson, Zeffie Tilbury, O.Z.
Whitehead, John Qualen and Ed
die Quillan.
Plays Tuesday and Wednesday
with Mr. Roberts.
L'Awentura (1961) ★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Monica Vitti's restless walk on
the beach might be the emblem of
Michelangelo Antonioni's mas
terpiece — the one great film
about the anomie and alienation
of the late '50s and early '60s. The
wealthy protagonists are true
drifters: nothing binds them to
each other for very long, and their
tragedy is that they can still feel
the loss of what was once impor
tant to them (the capacity to find
meaning in their lives, perhaps, or
to hold onto it). Vitti is simply
magnificent in the central role of
Claudia, and Gabriele Ferzetti (as
Sandro) and Lea Massari (as
Anna, the woman who disap
pears) givd expert performances.
This film may remind you of Re
noir's The Rules of the Game, a
picture as closely bound up with
the last days before the Second
World War as L'Awentura is with
its era.
Plays Thursday only with
Juliet of the Spirits.

Richard Prvor I.ive on the
Sunset Strip *
Kresge Auditorium
Richard Prvor's 25-minute
I'reebuse routine mav represent
the farthest leap anv comic has
taken since Lenny Bruce: simulta
neously hilarious and harrowing,
it plays so many disparate emo
tional chords that one doesn't
know exactly how to respond to
it. The rest of this filmed night
club show (directed by Joe
Lavton and shot by Haskell Wex
ler) isn't up to Richard Pryor Live
in Concert — there are a few seri
ous moments that come across as
sentimental — but most of it is
marvellous, and liberating.
Plays tomorrow evening.
Ragtime
Memorial Auditorium
E.L. Doctorow's deftly ironic
novel, in which celebrities and fic
tive personalities touch each oth
er's lives in mysterious, unan
ticipated ways, is annihilated by
director Milos Fornian and
screenwriter Michael Weller.
They don't seem to have just mis
understood the book; one won
ders if they've even read it. For
man's explicit style functions like
a wrecker's ball levelled at scene
after scene; he turns the irony into
burlesque — cruel burlesque in
which the characters (and the ac
tors) suffer. The cast of (mostly)
excellent actors Includes James
Cagnev, Mary Steenburgen,
James Olson, Brad Dourif, Moses
Gunn, Elizabeth McGovern,
Howard E. Rollins, Robert Joy,
Kenneth McMillan and Debbie
Allen; Forman seems so serenely
unaware of what they can do that
he stifles everyone except for
Cagnev, Dourif and McMillan.
Plavs Sunday evening.
Reviews by Steve Vineherg

"The movie breakthrough
has finally come."
— Pauline Kael on Last
Tango in Paris

★ Highly recommended

Last Tango in Paris (1973)
Aquarius, Palo Alto *
Bernardo Bertolucci's study of
a neurotic sexual relationship be
tween a middle-aged man — a
one-time Bohemian whose wife
has just committed suicide — and
a young French bourgeoise may
be the greatest film of the last 20
years. No one has ever explored
sexuality in movies in as intimate
and unrelenting a manner.
Bertolucci and Marlon Brando,
who plays the tragic hero, are
surely the most amazing director
actor combination since D.W.
Griffith and Lillian Gish; to de
scribe what Brando does for this
movie would require searching
for new superlatives. With Maria
Schneider, Jean-Pierre Leaud,
Maria Michi and Massimo Girot
ti; screenplay by Bertolucci and
Franco Arcalli; photographed by
Vittorio Storaro; music by Gato
Barbieri. The paintings in the
opening credits are by Francis
Bacon.
The Importance of Being
Earnest (1952) ★
Festival, Palo Alto
Anthony Asquith's screen ver
sion of the delirious Oscar Wilde
play — perhaps the funniest com
edy ever written — is a testament
to the virtues of filmed theater:
who could ever hope to see an
Earnest on any stage with a cast
like this one? Edith Evans, in pur
ple, pink and green, is Lady
Bracknell; Michael Redgrave is
Jack; Joan Greenwood, her vel
vety voice a wicked parody of ov
ercultivated actresses like Greer
Garson, is Gwendolyn; Dorothy
Tutin is Cicely; Margaret
Rutherford is Miss Prism; Miles
Malleson is Canon Chasuble —
and all of them are superb. Only
Michael Denison, as Algernon,
gives a disappointing per
formance.
Plays through Wednesday with
Pygmalion.
The Eagle (1926)
Fox, Redwood City
Rudolph Valentino's
penultimate movie, based on a
Pushkin story, parodies the ro
mantic melodramas that made
him famous. He plays a 19th-cen
tury Russian variation on Robin
Hood, an avenger nicknamed
"The Black Eagle,"and he gets to
• wear military outfits and fur hats
(he looks smashing in them) and
make love to Vilma Banky, who
has perfect little features. It's a sil
ly, pleasant spoof: the director,
Clarence Brown, does a nice job
with the actors and maintains a
good pace. Written by Hans Kra
1y and designed by William Cam
eron Menzies.
Plays Wednesday only.
It Came from Hollywood
Palo Alto Square, Palo Alto
Andrew Salt and Malcolm Leo
assembled this compilation of bits
from what they feel are the worst
movies of all time. Presumably
they were limited by the attitude
of other producers and directors
to this project, and so could not
focus on unforgettable moments
from expensive Hollywood
fiascoes like The Sandpiper and
Tora! Tora! Toral; therefore near
ly everything in the collection
looks cheap. And most of it is un
mistakably dreadful, especially
the scenes from Plan 9from Outer
Space and Mars Wants Women.
Narrated by Dan Aykroyd, Gilda
Radner, John Candy and Cheech
& Chong.

The Seven Samurai (1954) ★
Annenberg Auditorium
Akira Kurosawa's lusty, spec
tacular adventure, set amid the
civil wars in 16th-century Japan.
A community of farmers, slowly
starving under the double burden
of land taxes and the raids of
brigands, hires samurai to protect
them, and swords really start to
flv. The characters have a funny,
foolish braggadocio, and the ac
tors (Toshiro Mifune, Takashi
Shimura, Yoshio Inaba, etc.) give
stylized performances remi
niscent of the silent comedies. The
real star, of course, is Kurosawa,
who displays the kind of witty
mastery of film technique that
still makes audiences grin. (N. 8.:
The original version of The Seven
Samurai weighed in at three-and
a-half hours; this is the edited
print, which runs for two hours
and 11 minutes.)
Plays Thursday evening.
Horse Feathers (1932) ★
Bishop Auditorium
The Marx Brothers produced
their purest, most unrestrained
comedies at Paramount in the ear
ly days of the talkies. This send
up of collegiate musicals was their
fourth picture and, except for
Duck Soup, it is probably their
best. This is the one in which
Harpo brings a fish with a sword
stuck through it to the door of a
speakeasy in order to gain admit
tance (the password is
"swordfish") and Groucho sings
"Whatever it is, I'm against it."
He plays Professor Quincy
Adams Flagstaff, president of
Huxley College; Chico and
Harpo sign up as students so they
can play in the big football game
against Darwin, and Zeppo plays
Flagstaff's son(!). With Thelma
Todd, David Landau, Robert
Greig, James Pierce and Nat
Pendleton; screenplay by Bert
Kalmar, Harry Ruby, S.J. Per
elman & Will Johnstone; songs by
Kalmar & Ruby; directed by
Norman McLeod.
Plays tonight.
The Best Little Whorehouse in
Texas
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Colin Higgins may be the worst
director in Hollywood, but his in
exorable baseness seems to tap
into some kind of pop cultural
mainstream: everything he does
makes money. He worked on the
script of this movie, too, with the
authors of the Broadway musical
it's drawn from, Larry L. King
and Peter Masterson (King wrote
the Playboy article that inspired
the show); the dialogue alternates
between Academy Awards show
type filler and the kind of double
entendres one usually hears at cir
cumcisions. It's a respectable
movie, though — stupefyingly re
spectable. Dolly Parton makes
her initial entrance down a stair
case in a red gown, like Barbra
Streisand in Hello, Dolly! (the pic
ture echoes The Music Man in
other spots); as the madam, she
looks terrific and is intensely
likable. Her leading man is Burt
Reynolds, who plays the local
sheriff with an unappealing reti
cence. Glazed-looking Dom De-
Luise and Jim Nabors, in the
Andy Devine role, give grotesque
performances, but the movie is
momentarily redeemed when
Charles Durning, as the gleefully
evasive governor, sings and
dances "Sidestep."
Plays tomorrow only with
Blazing Saddles.

Oliver! (1968) *
New Varsity, Palo Alto
A great movie musical. In
adapting the hit Lionel Bart
show, screenwriter Vernon Harris
wisely returned to Dickens: the
dialogue is right out of Oliver
Twist. And the director, Carol
Reed, somehow managed to cap
ture both the Dickensian spirit
and the essence of musical com
edy; when you think of how many
■wrong turns the movie could have
made, the results seem mirac
ulous. (Just compare it to most of
the big-budget musicals Holly
wood was putting out in the same
era.) The magnificent cast fea
tures Ron Moody as Fagin, Ol
iver Reed as Bill Sykes, Shani
Wallis as Nancy, Harry Secombe
as Mr. Bumble, Mark Lester as
Oliver, and Jack Wild as the
Artful Dodger; Onna White did
the spectacular choreography and
John Box the lovely designs. This
deserving popular success, proba
bly Carol Reed's best movie after
The Third Man. was also his last
blaze of glory; though he lived un
til 1976, he never again rose to
such heights.
Plays Sunday only with Annie.
Breathless (1961) *
Fox, Redwood City
"It's normal: squealers squeal,
burglars burgle, killers kill and
lovers love," says Michel Poic
card (Jean-Paul Belmondo), the
hero of Jean-Luc Godard's vivify
ing film, one of the landmarks of
the French New Wave. LikeTruf
faut in Shoot the Piano Player,
Godard recasts the American
gangster pictures so beloved of
post-war French audiences in a
new, startling mold that is at once
jokey, self-referential, and unset
tling. The main characters,
Michel and his beautifully, moral

Plays tomorrow evening.
Ragtime
Memorial Auditorium
E.L. Doctorow's deftly ironic
novel, in which celebrities and fic
tive personalities touch each oth
er's lives in mysterious, unan
ticipated ways, is annihilated by
director Milos Fornian and
screenwriter Michael Weller.
They don't seem to have just mis
understood the book; one won
ders if they've even read it. For
man's explicit style functions like
a wrecker's ball levelled at scene
after scene; he turns the irony into
burlesque — cruel burlesque in
which the characters (and the ac
tors) suffer. The cast of (mostly)
excellent actors Includes James
Cagnev, Mary Steenburgen,
James Olson, Brad Dourif, Moses
Gunn, Elizabeth McGovern,
Howard E. Rollins, Robert Joy,
Kenneth McMillan and Debbie
Allen; Forman seems so serenely
unaware of what they can do that
he stifles everyone except for
Cagnev, Dourif and McMillan.

Reviews by Steve Vineherg

"The movie breakthrough
has finally come."
— Pauline Kael on Last
Tango in Paris

★ Highly recommended

Last Tango in Paris (1973)
Aquarius, Palo Alto *
Bernardo Bertolucci's study of
a neurotic sexual relationship be
tween a middle-aged man — a
one-time Bohemian whose wife
has just committed suicide — and
a young French bourgeoise may
be the greatest film of the last 20
years. No one has ever explored
sexuality in movies in as intimate
and unrelenting a manner.
Bertolucci and Marlon Brando,
who plays the tragic hero, are
surely the most amazing director
actor combination since D.W.
Griffith and Lillian Gish; to de
scribe what Brando does for this
movie would require searching
for new superlatives. With Maria
Schneider, Jean-Pierre Leaud,
Maria Michi and Massimo Girot
ti; screenplay by Bertolucci and
Franco Arcalli; photographed by
Vittorio Storaro; music by Gato
Barbieri. The paintings in the
opening credits are by Francis
Bacon.
The Importance of Being
Earnest (1952) ★
Festival, Palo Alto
Anthony Asquith's screen ver
sion of the delirious Oscar Wilde
play — perhaps the funniest com
edy ever written — is a testament
to the virtues of filmed theater:
who could ever hope to see an
Earnest on any stage with a cast
like this one? Edith Evans, in pur
ple, pink and green, is Lady
Bracknell; Michael Redgrave is
Jack; Joan Greenwood, her vel
vety voice a wicked parody of ov
ercultivated actresses like Greer
Garson, is Gwendolyn; Dorothy
Tutin is Cicely; Margaret
Rutherford is Miss Prism; Miles
Malleson is Canon Chasuble —
and all of them are superb. Only
Michael Denison, as Algernon,
gives a disappointing per
formance.
Plays through Wednesday with
Pygmalion.
The Eagle (1926)
Fox, Redwood City
Rudolph Valentino's
penultimate movie, based on a
Pushkin story, parodies the ro
mantic melodramas that made
him famous. He plays a 19th-cen
tury Russian variation on Robin
Hood, an avenger nicknamed
"The Black Eagle,"and he gets to
• wear military outfits and fur hats
(he looks smashing in them) and
make love to Vilma Banky, who
has perfect little features. It's a sil
ly, pleasant spoof: the director,
Clarence Brown, does a nice job
with the actors and maintains a
good pace. Written by Hans Kra
1y and designed by William Cam
eron Menzies.
Plays Wednesday only.
It Came from Hollywood
Palo Alto Square, Palo Alto
Andrew Salt and Malcolm Leo
assembled this compilation of bits
from what they feel are the worst
movies of all time. Presumably
they were limited by the attitude
of other producers and directors
to this project, and so could not
focus on unforgettable moments
from expensive Hollywood
fiascoes like The Sandpiper and
Tora! Tora! Toral; therefore near
ly everything in the collection
looks cheap. And most of it is un
mistakably dreadful, especially
the scenes from Plan 9from Outer
Space and Mars Wants Women.
Narrated by Dan Aykroyd, Gilda
Radner, John Candy and Cheech
& Chong.

The Seven Samurai (1954) ★
Annenberg Auditorium
Akira Kurosawa's lusty, spec
tacular adventure, set amid the
civil wars in 16th-century Japan.
A community of farmers, slowly
starving under the double burden
of land taxes and the raids of
brigands, hires samurai to protect
them, and swords really start to
flv. The characters have a funny,
foolish braggadocio, and the ac
tors (Toshiro Mifune, Takashi
Shimura, Yoshio Inaba, etc.) give
stylized performances remi
niscent of the silent comedies. The
real star, of course, is Kurosawa,
who displays the kind of witty
mastery of film technique that
still makes audiences grin. (N. 8.:
The original version of The Seven
Samurai weighed in at three-and
a-half hours; this is the edited
print, which runs for two hours
and 11 minutes.)
Plays Thursday evening.
Horse Feathers (1932) ★
Bishop Auditorium
The Marx Brothers produced
their purest, most unrestrained
comedies at Paramount in the ear
ly days of the talkies. This send
up of collegiate musicals was their
fourth picture and, except for
Duck Soup, it is probably their
best. This is the one in which
Harpo brings a fish with a sword
stuck through it to the door of a
speakeasy in order to gain admit
tance (the password is
"swordfish") and Groucho sings
"Whatever it is, I'm against it."
He plays Professor Quincy
Adams Flagstaff, president of
Huxley College; Chico and
Harpo sign up as students so they
can play in the big football game
against Darwin, and Zeppo plays
Flagstaff's son(!). With Thelma
Todd, David Landau, Robert
Greig, James Pierce and Nat
Pendleton; screenplay by Bert
Kalmar, Harry Ruby, S.J. Per
elman & Will Johnstone; songs by
Kalmar & Ruby; directed by
Norman McLeod.
Plays tonight.
The Best Little Whorehouse in
Texas
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Colin Higgins may be the worst
director in Hollywood, but his in
exorable baseness seems to tap
into some kind of pop cultural
mainstream: everything he does
makes money. He worked on the
script of this movie, too, with the
authors of the Broadway musical
it's drawn from, Larry L. King
and Peter Masterson (King wrote
the Playboy article that inspired
the show); the dialogue alternates
between Academy Awards show
type filler and the kind of double
entendres one usually hears at cir
cumcisions. It's a respectable
movie, though — stupefyingly re
spectable. Dolly Parton makes
her initial entrance down a stair
case in a red gown, like Barbra
Streisand in Hello, Dolly! (the pic
ture echoes The Music Man in
other spots); as the madam, she
looks terrific and is intensely
likable. Her leading man is Burt
Reynolds, who plays the local
sheriff with an unappealing reti
cence. Glazed-looking Dom De-
Luise and Jim Nabors, in the
Andy Devine role, give grotesque
performances, but the movie is
momentarily redeemed when
Charles Durning, as the gleefully
evasive governor, sings and
dances "Sidestep."
Plays tomorrow only with
Blazing Saddles.

Oliver! (1968) *
New Varsity, Palo Alto
A great movie musical. In
adapting the hit Lionel Bart
show, screenwriter Vernon Harris
wisely returned to Dickens: the
dialogue is right out of Oliver
Twist. And the director, Carol
Reed, somehow managed to cap
ture both the Dickensian spirit
and the essence of musical com
edy; when you think of how many
■wrong turns the movie could have
made, the results seem mirac
ulous. (Just compare it to most of
the big-budget musicals Holly
wood was putting out in the same
era.) The magnificent cast fea
tures Ron Moody as Fagin, Ol
iver Reed as Bill Sykes, Shani
Wallis as Nancy, Harry Secombe
as Mr. Bumble, Mark Lester as
Oliver, and Jack Wild as the
Artful Dodger; Onna White did
the spectacular choreography and
John Box the lovely designs. This
deserving popular success, proba
bly Carol Reed's best movie after
The Third Man. was also his last
blaze of glory; though he lived un
til 1976, he never again rose to
such heights.
Plays Sunday only with Annie.
Breathless (1961) *
Fox, Redwood City
"It's normal: squealers squeal,
burglars burgle, killers kill and
lovers love," says Michel Poic
card (Jean-Paul Belmondo), the
hero of Jean-Luc Godard's vivify
ing film, one of the landmarks of
the French New Wave. LikeTruf
faut in Shoot the Piano Player,
Godard recasts the American
gangster pictures so beloved of
post-war French audiences in a
new, startling mold that is at once
jokey, self-referential, and unset
tling. The main characters,
Michel and his beautifully, moral
ly blank girl friend Patricia (Jean
Seberg), are in love with style. A
great film, with a hypnotic per
formance from Belmondo.
Plays Thursday only with King
of Hearts.
Pygmalion (1938) ★
Festival, Palo Alto
Anthony Asquith and Leslie
Howard co-directed this justifi
ably famous film version of the
Shaw play; it may be the only time
Shaw has been so well served in
the movies. (Pygmalion is also
likely his most filmable script.)
Howard is a witty, romantic Pro
fessor Higgins — he personalizes
his pipe in so distinctive a manner
that after you've seen this per
formance, you may not be able to
imagine him without one — and
her portrayal of Eliza Dolittle
made Wendy Hiller a star. With
Wilfrid Lawson, Scott Sun
derland, Marie Lohr, David Tree
and Esme Percy.
Plays through Wednesday with
The Importance of Being Earnest.
Up in Smoke (1978)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
The quest for great dope is the
theme of this comedy, in which
Cheech Martin and Tommy
Chong make their movie debut.
Silly as it is, it's relaxed and pleas
ant; the effects of the weed
Cheech and Chong keep smoking
seem to get to the audience as
well. Among movies of this type
— jokey sophomoric hits like
Animal House — this is probably
the best.
Plays today only with Things
Are Tough All Over and Cheech
and Chong's Nice Dreams.

The Grapes of Wrath (1940)
New Varsity, Palo Alto ★
Like the John Steinbeck novel,
John Ford's famous screen ver
sion isn't as good as its reputa
tion, but it's made with such inte
grity and singleness of vision, and
it's so emotionally charged, that
you remember it more vividly
than a lot of better pictures. The
biblical-hillbilly dialogue is im
possible, and most of the acting is
arresting in all the wrong ways,
but Henry Fonda is a terrific Tom
Joad. Gregg Toland photo
graphed, the year before he did
Citizen Kane; it's easy to see why
he was the hottest young camer
aman in Hollywood. (His death in
1948, at the age of 44, was a real
tragedy.) With Jane Darwell,
John Carradine, Charley
Grapewin, Dorris Bowdon, Rus
sell Simpson, Zeffie Tilbury, O.Z.
Whitehead, John Qualen and Ed
die Quillan.
Plays Tuesday and Wednesday
with Mr. Roberts.
L'Awentura (1961) ★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Monica Vitti's restless walk on
the beach might be the emblem of
Michelangelo Antonioni's mas
terpiece — the one great film
about the anomie and alienation
of the late '50s and early '60s. The
wealthy protagonists are true
drifters: nothing binds them to
each other for very long, and their
tragedy is that they can still feel
the loss of what was once impor
tant to them (the capacity to find
meaning in their lives, perhaps, or
to hold onto it). Vitti is simply
magnificent in the central role of
Claudia, and Gabriele Ferzetti (as
Sandro) and Lea Massari (as
Anna, the woman who disap
pears) givd expert performances.
This film may remind you of Re
noir's The Rules of the Game, a
picture as closely bound up with
the last days before the Second
World War as L'Awentura is with
its era.
Plays Thursday only with
Juliet of the Spirits.
