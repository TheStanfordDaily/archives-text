Soviet leadership stresses continuity

Moscow — The Soviet Union began an uncertain and cumbersome
transfer of power yesterday following the death of President Leonid
Brezhnev, 75, from a heart attack Wednesday. Brezhnev, the fourth man to
occupy the post of Soviet Communist Party leader since the founding of the
Soviet state, had ruled for 18 years.
Calling on the Soviet people to rally firmly behind the party and govern
ment and display "a high sense of awareness and organization," an official
proclamation by the leadership pledged to continue Brezhnev's policy of de
tente and emphasized the continuity of Soviet domestic and foreign policies
in general.
But it also warned about the need for greater vigilance and underscored
that "a crushing retaliatory blow" awaits any potential aggressor. The
statement was issued in the name of the Communist Party Central Commit
tee, the Supreme Soviet (the nation's parliament) and the Council of Min
isters (the Cabinet).
There were no official indications on who would take over Brezhnev's
twin positions as general secretary of the party's Central Committee and
chief of state. Given the extreme secrecy that surrounds party deliberations,
outsiders do not even know how the man, or men, who will assume
Brezhnev's posts and mantle will be chosen.
Diplomatic observers attached considerable importance to the
fact that Yuri Andropov, 68, a senior Politburo member and
former chief of the Soviet secret police, was named to head an
official funeral committee.
Chernenko, the Josest associate of Brezhnev who in effect
served as a stand-in for the ailing leader for the most part of this
year, is regarded as a possible successor.
The news of Brezhnev's death was broken to the Soviet people
at 11 a.m. Thursday, or almost 27 hours after fatal heart attack.
In the intervening period rumors had swept the city that either he
or another senior figure had passed away.
The delay was believed to have been caused by the absence of a
known mechanism of succession.
Brezhnev successor sought
Moscow — More than 18 hours after the announcement of
President Leonid Brezhnev's death, there were no official
statements to indicate who would succeed him as Chairman of
the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet — and thus as head of state
— and as leader of the party, the real seat of political power in the
Soviet Union.
It appeared likely that the two positions would be separated as
they were before 1977. Western analysts and usually reliable So
viet sources believe Brezhnev's close associate, Konstantin
Chernenko, 71, and the former chairman of the Committee for
State Security, the KGB, Yuri Andropov, 68, who stepped down
from the KGB in May, are the most likely candidates to assume
the more important mantle of party leadership, at least on an in
terim basis.
An official obituary praising Brezhnev as "the most promi
nent political figure of our time" and decrees on funeral arrange
ments were also issued during the day in the name of the Central
Committee, the Supreme Soviet and the Council of Government
Ministers, an indication that all three bodies were meeting in
joint session throughout the day. Late into last evening, lights
were burning brightly in virtually every window of the Central
Committee headquarters, the Council of Ministers building and
at KGB headquarters on Dzerzhinsky Square.
Reagan sends Bush to Moscow funeral
Washington — President Reagan responded yesterday to the
death of Leonid Brezhnev by calling for improved relations with
the Soviet Union but turned down a proposal by his foreign poli
cy advisers that he take what one of them called "the dramatic
step" of attending the funeral of the Soviet president.
Reagan, rejecting the recommendation of Secretary of State
George Schultz, said that Vice President George Bush would
head the U.S. delegation to Moscow.
Shultz had proposed that Reagan take the precedent-setting
step of attending the funeral himself in an effort to improve U.S.-
Soviet relations during a time of transition. "Our two nations
bear a tremendous responsibility for peace in a dangerous time
— a responsibility that we don't take lightly," Reagan said in a
statement opening his news conference last night.
Reagan holds press conference
Washington — President Reagan said last night that he is con
sidering whether to seek a 5-cent-a-gallon gasoline tax to repair
the nation's highways and bridges and create thousands of jobs.
The president, who hinted that he favored the proposal, which
he termed a "user fee" rather than a tax increase, said at a news
conference that it would cost the average motorist $30 more a
year.
Reagan said no decision has been made regarding the tax, but
noted that the additional tax on top of the current 4-cent-a
gallon federal levy would not reduce the incentives to save and
invest from the three-year tax cuts enacted by Congress in 1981.
The president strongly opposed Democratic proposals for
multibiilion dollar job-creating programs, saying they would be
a "drag on the economy and really slow down our effort to re
store the economy." His guideline for considering whether to
veto such measures, the president said, would be whether they
advance or delay recovery from recession.
Replying to another question on possible cuts in defense
spending, the president said, "V/e are looking at everything."
But he indicated that no cuts in defense would be made if they
"delay or set back what we think we need to have to close down
the window of vulnerability (to Soviet attacks) which we in
herited."
Reagan said that foreign agents unquestionably play a role in
the movement for a nuclear weapons freeze, but spokesmen of
the freeze campaign called his charge"documentable baloney."
Reagan said intelligence considerations kept him from laying
out the proof for his assertion.

He said foreign agents — he did not specify Soviets — had
played a role in the pro-freeze demonstrations.
"There has been the organization of some of the big demon
strations — the one in New York and so forth — there is no ques
tion about foreign agents that were sent to help instigate and help
create and keep such a movement going," he said.
Brezhnev's demise draws varied response
Washington — Former President Carter said yesterday that
Leonid Brezhnev's death could prompt the Kremlin to take a
more confrontational stance toward the United States, but one
time Secretary of State Henry Kissinger predicted the Soviets
may mount a "peace offensive."
Their comments illustrated the broad range of reaction voiced
bv President Reagan, senior U.S. officials who have met person
ally with Brezhnev, members of Congress and professional
Kremlinologists.
At the White House, Reagan expressed condolences and de
clared his administration's desire to "work toward an improved
relationship with the Soviet Union." He called Brezhnev "one of
the world's most important figures for nearly two decades."
Reagan's initial comments on Brezhnev's death did not go into
detail on what type of impact the Kremlin succession could have
on the overall fabric of U.S.-Soviet relations.
But Carter, speaking to reporters in Washington, said he
would not be surprised if Moscow shifts temporarily toward "a
more confrontational relationship" with the United States.
Carter's predecessor in the White House, Gerald Ford hoped
that Brezhnev's death " will not lead to a wide swing in the Soviet
policy that would preclude progress toward a reduction in nucle
ar weapons and the solution of other policies between the United
States and the Soviet Union."
Former President Nixon described Brezhnev as "a strong
leader of a strong people. As a Russian, he was warm, effusive,
ebullient. As a Communist, he was a ruthless schemer and a re
lentless aggressor. But he was not a madman. He was a realist.
... He wanted the world. But he did not want war.
(In a Daily interview, Warren Christopher, former deputy sec
retary of state and current member of the Stanford University
Board of Trustees, said this country "is in for an unstable peri
od" due to competition for leadership in the Soviet Union.
"One of the things we know so little about is succession in the
Soviet Union — that's what makes it an unstable period," he
said.
Christopher said he is fairly sure that former KGB chief Yuri
Andropov will take over as party chairman. "His star appears to
have been rising.
"We may look back on Brezhnev as a moderate," he added.)
Polish regime to free Walesa
Warsaw — Interned Solidarity leader Lech Walesa has offered
to help "find a solution" to Poland's problems and will be freed
without conditions in a few days, the martial law regime said yes
terday.
The announcement came a day after the failure of a general
strike called by underground leaders of the outlawed independ
ent labor union.
"If it is true, Lwill be happy," Walesa's wife Danuta told The
Associated Press by telephone from the couple's home in the
northern port city of Gdansk. "I'm full of joy and fear, because I
cannot imagine the crowds of people who will want to see him."
Government spokesman Jerzy Urban told foreign reporters at
a hurriedly called news conference yersterday that Walesa's re
lease would be delayed until sometime in "the next few days be
cause of technical reasons such as different formalities, his lug
gage and so forth."
"No conditions were put to Walesa concerning his release," he
added.
Shuttle deploys commercial satellite
Cape Canaveral — Four American astronauts put the United
States in the space hauling business yesterday when they suc
cessfully released a massive communications satellite from the
space shuttle Columbia and placed it behind them in the vast
open seas of space.
Flying Columbia into orbit on its first operational mission af
ter four test flights, astronauts Vance Brand, Robert Overmyer,
William Lenoir and Joseph Allen carried into orbit with them
almost identical twin satellites to serve the television and tele
phone needs of North America.They deployed the American sat
ellite (the second is Canadian) in precisely the position its com
mercial owners wanted it.
"You've got a lot of happy people down here, Joe," astronaut
Michael Coates called up to Allen from the Mission Control
Center in Houston. "You guys do good work."

"We deliver," replied Allen, who with Lenoir maneuvered the
satellite away from Columbia and into space while Brand and
Overmver flew the 100-ton spaceliner. "You should have seen
how it looked from here."
Reagan expands Habib's Mideast role
Washington — President Reagan yesterday named veteran
diplomat Philip Habib his new special representative for the
Middle East, giving him authority over negotiations both for
withdrawal of foreign forces from Lebanon and for the presi
dent's Middle East peace initiative.
Habib said he would pursue both objectives simultaneously.
"Don't think we can't succeed," he told reporters.
It was Habib who last summer negotiated the withdrawal of
Palestinian forces from Beirut, ending the Israeli siege of the city
and bringing U.S. forces to the Mideast as part of a multi
national unit that left once but returned after the massacre of
Palestinians in the Sabra and Shatila camps in mid-September.
With Habib's appointment yesterday, Reagan's team for
pressing U.S. goals in the troubled region is complete.
Italian prime minister resigns
Rome — Prime Minister Giovanni Spadolini submitted his
resignation yesterday, initiating Italy's 43rd government crisis
since World War 11, but President Sandro Pertini refused to ac
cept it.
The attempted resignation capped a Cabinet crisis that
erupted while Spadolini was visiting the United States a week
ago and is centered on feuding among Cabinet ministers over ec
onomic issues.
The official newspaper of Spadolini's small, but influential
Republican Party said he decided to resign "in the last hours in
Los Angeles" during his American trip.
But Pertini's refusal to accept the resignation left the fate of the
2-month-old Spadolini government unclear. A statement from
the presidential palace said only that Pertini had told the prime
minister to refer the government deadlock to Parliament.
The public feuding between the Cabinet's two chief financial
ministers — Nino Andretta, the Christian Democratic minister
of the Treasury, and Rino Formica, the Socialist finance minister
— had reached the stage of personal insults.
Commission concurs on Social Security
Washington — The president's advisory commission on Social
Security unanimously agreed yesterday that the giant system re
quires between $150 billion and $200 billion of tax increases or
benefit cuts in the next seven years to stave off bankruptcy.
The commission, in the first day of a scheduled three-day
meeting here, did not get to the question of how that much mon
ey might be raised.
But economist Alan Greenspan, the commission chairman,
said he regarded agreement simply on the dimensions of the
problem as significant because there has been so much dispute in
the past even over that. In general, Republicans have been saying
major reforms are needed to save the system, and Democrats
that lesser steps might do.
And one commission member, former Rep. Joe Waggonner
(D-La.) said he thinks the commission and Congress will ul
timately find the money in part by curtailing future cost-of-living
increases in benefits and bringing federal, state and local govern
ment employees into the system. He also said it seemed likely
there would be attempts to move forward to 1984 tax increases
now scheduled for 1985, 1986 and 1990,
Dow Jones closes on the up side
New York — Stock prices rallied sharply near the close yester

spending, the president said, "V/e are looking at everything."
But he indicated that no cuts in defense would be made if they
"delay or set back what we think we need to have to close down
the window of vulnerability (to Soviet attacks) which we in
herited."
Reagan said that foreign agents unquestionably play a role in
the movement for a nuclear weapons freeze, but spokesmen of
the freeze campaign called his charge"documentable baloney."
Reagan said intelligence considerations kept him from laying
out the proof for his assertion.

He said foreign agents — he did not specify Soviets — had
played a role in the pro-freeze demonstrations.
"There has been the organization of some of the big demon
strations — the one in New York and so forth — there is no ques
tion about foreign agents that were sent to help instigate and help
create and keep such a movement going," he said.
Brezhnev's demise draws varied response
Washington — Former President Carter said yesterday that
Leonid Brezhnev's death could prompt the Kremlin to take a
more confrontational stance toward the United States, but one
time Secretary of State Henry Kissinger predicted the Soviets
may mount a "peace offensive."
Their comments illustrated the broad range of reaction voiced
bv President Reagan, senior U.S. officials who have met person
ally with Brezhnev, members of Congress and professional
Kremlinologists.
At the White House, Reagan expressed condolences and de
clared his administration's desire to "work toward an improved
relationship with the Soviet Union." He called Brezhnev "one of
the world's most important figures for nearly two decades."
Reagan's initial comments on Brezhnev's death did not go into
detail on what type of impact the Kremlin succession could have
on the overall fabric of U.S.-Soviet relations.
But Carter, speaking to reporters in Washington, said he
would not be surprised if Moscow shifts temporarily toward "a
more confrontational relationship" with the United States.
Carter's predecessor in the White House, Gerald Ford hoped
that Brezhnev's death " will not lead to a wide swing in the Soviet
policy that would preclude progress toward a reduction in nucle
ar weapons and the solution of other policies between the United
States and the Soviet Union."
Former President Nixon described Brezhnev as "a strong
leader of a strong people. As a Russian, he was warm, effusive,
ebullient. As a Communist, he was a ruthless schemer and a re
lentless aggressor. But he was not a madman. He was a realist.
... He wanted the world. But he did not want war.
(In a Daily interview, Warren Christopher, former deputy sec
retary of state and current member of the Stanford University
Board of Trustees, said this country "is in for an unstable peri
od" due to competition for leadership in the Soviet Union.
"One of the things we know so little about is succession in the
Soviet Union — that's what makes it an unstable period," he
said.
Christopher said he is fairly sure that former KGB chief Yuri
Andropov will take over as party chairman. "His star appears to
have been rising.
"We may look back on Brezhnev as a moderate," he added.)
Polish regime to free Walesa
Warsaw — Interned Solidarity leader Lech Walesa has offered
to help "find a solution" to Poland's problems and will be freed
without conditions in a few days, the martial law regime said yes
terday.
The announcement came a day after the failure of a general
strike called by underground leaders of the outlawed independ
ent labor union.
"If it is true, Lwill be happy," Walesa's wife Danuta told The
Associated Press by telephone from the couple's home in the
northern port city of Gdansk. "I'm full of joy and fear, because I
cannot imagine the crowds of people who will want to see him."
Government spokesman Jerzy Urban told foreign reporters at
a hurriedly called news conference yersterday that Walesa's re
lease would be delayed until sometime in "the next few days be
cause of technical reasons such as different formalities, his lug
gage and so forth."
"No conditions were put to Walesa concerning his release," he
added.
Shuttle deploys commercial satellite
Cape Canaveral — Four American astronauts put the United
States in the space hauling business yesterday when they suc
cessfully released a massive communications satellite from the
space shuttle Columbia and placed it behind them in the vast
open seas of space.
Flying Columbia into orbit on its first operational mission af
ter four test flights, astronauts Vance Brand, Robert Overmyer,
William Lenoir and Joseph Allen carried into orbit with them
almost identical twin satellites to serve the television and tele
phone needs of North America.They deployed the American sat
ellite (the second is Canadian) in precisely the position its com
mercial owners wanted it.
"You've got a lot of happy people down here, Joe," astronaut
Michael Coates called up to Allen from the Mission Control
Center in Houston. "You guys do good work."

"We deliver," replied Allen, who with Lenoir maneuvered the
satellite away from Columbia and into space while Brand and
Overmver flew the 100-ton spaceliner. "You should have seen
how it looked from here."
Reagan expands Habib's Mideast role
Washington — President Reagan yesterday named veteran
diplomat Philip Habib his new special representative for the
Middle East, giving him authority over negotiations both for
withdrawal of foreign forces from Lebanon and for the presi
dent's Middle East peace initiative.
Habib said he would pursue both objectives simultaneously.
"Don't think we can't succeed," he told reporters.
It was Habib who last summer negotiated the withdrawal of
Palestinian forces from Beirut, ending the Israeli siege of the city
and bringing U.S. forces to the Mideast as part of a multi
national unit that left once but returned after the massacre of
Palestinians in the Sabra and Shatila camps in mid-September.
With Habib's appointment yesterday, Reagan's team for
pressing U.S. goals in the troubled region is complete.
Italian prime minister resigns
Rome — Prime Minister Giovanni Spadolini submitted his
resignation yesterday, initiating Italy's 43rd government crisis
since World War 11, but President Sandro Pertini refused to ac
cept it.
The attempted resignation capped a Cabinet crisis that
erupted while Spadolini was visiting the United States a week
ago and is centered on feuding among Cabinet ministers over ec
onomic issues.
The official newspaper of Spadolini's small, but influential
Republican Party said he decided to resign "in the last hours in
Los Angeles" during his American trip.
But Pertini's refusal to accept the resignation left the fate of the
2-month-old Spadolini government unclear. A statement from
the presidential palace said only that Pertini had told the prime
minister to refer the government deadlock to Parliament.
The public feuding between the Cabinet's two chief financial
ministers — Nino Andretta, the Christian Democratic minister
of the Treasury, and Rino Formica, the Socialist finance minister
— had reached the stage of personal insults.
Commission concurs on Social Security
Washington — The president's advisory commission on Social
Security unanimously agreed yesterday that the giant system re
quires between $150 billion and $200 billion of tax increases or
benefit cuts in the next seven years to stave off bankruptcy.
The commission, in the first day of a scheduled three-day
meeting here, did not get to the question of how that much mon
ey might be raised.
But economist Alan Greenspan, the commission chairman,
said he regarded agreement simply on the dimensions of the
problem as significant because there has been so much dispute in
the past even over that. In general, Republicans have been saying
major reforms are needed to save the system, and Democrats
that lesser steps might do.
And one commission member, former Rep. Joe Waggonner
(D-La.) said he thinks the commission and Congress will ul
timately find the money in part by curtailing future cost-of-living
increases in benefits and bringing federal, state and local govern
ment employees into the system. He also said it seemed likely
there would be attempts to move forward to 1984 tax increases
now scheduled for 1985, 1986 and 1990,

Soviet leadership stresses continuity

Moscow — The Soviet Union began an uncertain and cumbersome
transfer of power yesterday following the death of President Leonid
Brezhnev, 75, from a heart attack Wednesday. Brezhnev, the fourth man to
occupy the post of Soviet Communist Party leader since the founding of the
Soviet state, had ruled for 18 years.
Calling on the Soviet people to rally firmly behind the party and govern
ment and display "a high sense of awareness and organization," an official
proclamation by the leadership pledged to continue Brezhnev's policy of de
tente and emphasized the continuity of Soviet domestic and foreign policies
in general.
But it also warned about the need for greater vigilance and underscored
that "a crushing retaliatory blow" awaits any potential aggressor. The
statement was issued in the name of the Communist Party Central Commit
tee, the Supreme Soviet (the nation's parliament) and the Council of Min
isters (the Cabinet).
There were no official indications on who would take over Brezhnev's
twin positions as general secretary of the party's Central Committee and
chief of state. Given the extreme secrecy that surrounds party deliberations,
outsiders do not even know how the man, or men, who will assume
Brezhnev's posts and mantle will be chosen.
Diplomatic observers attached considerable importance to the
fact that Yuri Andropov, 68, a senior Politburo member and
former chief of the Soviet secret police, was named to head an
official funeral committee.
Chernenko, the Josest associate of Brezhnev who in effect
served as a stand-in for the ailing leader for the most part of this
year, is regarded as a possible successor.
The news of Brezhnev's death was broken to the Soviet people
at 11 a.m. Thursday, or almost 27 hours after fatal heart attack.
In the intervening period rumors had swept the city that either he
or another senior figure had passed away.
The delay was believed to have been caused by the absence of a
known mechanism of succession.
Brezhnev successor sought
Moscow — More than 18 hours after the announcement of
President Leonid Brezhnev's death, there were no official
statements to indicate who would succeed him as Chairman of
the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet — and thus as head of state
— and as leader of the party, the real seat of political power in the
Soviet Union.
It appeared likely that the two positions would be separated as
they were before 1977. Western analysts and usually reliable So
viet sources believe Brezhnev's close associate, Konstantin
Chernenko, 71, and the former chairman of the Committee for
State Security, the KGB, Yuri Andropov, 68, who stepped down
from the KGB in May, are the most likely candidates to assume
the more important mantle of party leadership, at least on an in
terim basis.
An official obituary praising Brezhnev as "the most promi
nent political figure of our time" and decrees on funeral arrange
ments were also issued during the day in the name of the Central
Committee, the Supreme Soviet and the Council of Government
Ministers, an indication that all three bodies were meeting in
joint session throughout the day. Late into last evening, lights
were burning brightly in virtually every window of the Central
Committee headquarters, the Council of Ministers building and
at KGB headquarters on Dzerzhinsky Square.
Reagan sends Bush to Moscow funeral
Washington — President Reagan responded yesterday to the
death of Leonid Brezhnev by calling for improved relations with
the Soviet Union but turned down a proposal by his foreign poli
cy advisers that he take what one of them called "the dramatic
step" of attending the funeral of the Soviet president.
Reagan, rejecting the recommendation of Secretary of State
George Schultz, said that Vice President George Bush would
head the U.S. delegation to Moscow.
Shultz had proposed that Reagan take the precedent-setting
step of attending the funeral himself in an effort to improve U.S.-
Soviet relations during a time of transition. "Our two nations
bear a tremendous responsibility for peace in a dangerous time
— a responsibility that we don't take lightly," Reagan said in a
statement opening his news conference last night.
Reagan holds press conference
Washington — President Reagan said last night that he is con
sidering whether to seek a 5-cent-a-gallon gasoline tax to repair
the nation's highways and bridges and create thousands of jobs.
The president, who hinted that he favored the proposal, which
he termed a "user fee" rather than a tax increase, said at a news
conference that it would cost the average motorist $30 more a
year.
Reagan said no decision has been made regarding the tax, but
noted that the additional tax on top of the current 4-cent-a
gallon federal levy would not reduce the incentives to save and
invest from the three-year tax cuts enacted by Congress in 1981.
The president strongly opposed Democratic proposals for
multibiilion dollar job-creating programs, saying they would be
a "drag on the economy and really slow down our effort to re
store the economy." His guideline for considering whether to
veto such measures, the president said, would be whether they
advance or delay recovery from recession.
Replying to another question on possible cuts in defense
spending, the president said, "V/e are looking at everything."
But he indicated that no cuts in defense would be made if they
"delay or set back what we think we need to have to close down
the window of vulnerability (to Soviet attacks) which we in
herited."

the movement for a nuclear weapons freeze, but spokesmen of
the freeze campaign called his charge"documentable baloney."

out the proof for his assertion.

played a role in the pro-freeze demonstrations.
"There has been the organization of some of the big demon

diplomat Philip Habib his new special representative for the
Middle East, giving him authority over negotiations both for
withdrawal of foreign forces from Lebanon and for the presi
dent's Middle East peace initiative.
Habib said he would pursue both objectives simultaneously.
"Don't think we can't succeed," he told reporters.
It was Habib who last summer negotiated the withdrawal of
Palestinian forces from Beirut, ending the Israeli siege of the city
and bringing U.S. forces to the Mideast as part of a multi
national unit that left once but returned after the massacre of
Palestinians in the Sabra and Shatila camps in mid-September.
With Habib's appointment yesterday, Reagan's team for
pressing U.S. goals in the troubled region is complete.
Italian prime minister resigns
Rome — Prime Minister Giovanni Spadolini submitted his
resignation yesterday, initiating Italy's 43rd government crisis
since World War 11, but President Sandro Pertini refused to ac
cept it.
The attempted resignation capped a Cabinet crisis that
erupted while Spadolini was visiting the United States a week
ago and is centered on feuding among Cabinet ministers over ec
onomic issues.
The official newspaper of Spadolini's small, but influential
Republican Party said he decided to resign "in the last hours in
Los Angeles" during his American trip.
But Pertini's refusal to accept the resignation left the fate of the
2-month-old Spadolini government unclear. A statement from
the presidential palace said only that Pertini had told the prime
minister to refer the government deadlock to Parliament.
The public feuding between the Cabinet's two chief financial
ministers — Nino Andretta, the Christian Democratic minister
of the Treasury, and Rino Formica, the Socialist finance minister
— had reached the stage of personal insults.
Commission concurs on Social Security
Washington — The president's advisory commission on Social
Security unanimously agreed yesterday that the giant system re
quires between $150 billion and $200 billion of tax increases or
benefit cuts in the next seven years to stave off bankruptcy.
The commission, in the first day of a scheduled three-day
meeting here, did not get to the question of how that much mon
ey might be raised.
But economist Alan Greenspan, the commission chairman,
said he regarded agreement simply on the dimensions of the
problem as significant because there has been so much dispute in
the past even over that. In general, Republicans have been saying
major reforms are needed to save the system, and Democrats
that lesser steps might do.
And one commission member, former Rep. Joe Waggonner
(D-La.) said he thinks the commission and Congress will ul
timately find the money in part by curtailing future cost-of-living
increases in benefits and bringing federal, state and local govern
ment employees into the system. He also said it seemed likely
there would be attempts to move forward to 1984 tax increases
now scheduled for 1985, 1986 and 1990,

Soviet leadership stresses continuity

Moscow — The Soviet Union began an uncertain and cumbersome
transfer of power yesterday following the death of President Leonid
Brezhnev, 75, from a heart attack Wednesday. Brezhnev, the fourth man to
occupy the post of Soviet Communist Party leader since the founding of the
Soviet state, had ruled for 18 years.
Calling on the Soviet people to rally firmly behind the party and govern
ment and display "a high sense of awareness and organization," an official
proclamation by the leadership pledged to continue Brezhnev's policy of de
tente and emphasized the continuity of Soviet domestic and foreign policies
in general.
But it also warned about the need for greater vigilance and underscored
that "a crushing retaliatory blow" awaits any potential aggressor. The
statement was issued in the name of the Communist Party Central Commit
tee, the Supreme Soviet (the nation's parliament) and the Council of Min
isters (the Cabinet).
There were no official indications on who would take over Brezhnev's
twin positions as general secretary of the party's Central Committee and
chief of state. Given the extreme secrecy that surrounds party deliberations,
outsiders do not even know how the man, or men, who will assume
Brezhnev's posts and mantle will be chosen.
Diplomatic observers attached considerable importance to the
fact that Yuri Andropov, 68, a senior Politburo member and
former chief of the Soviet secret police, was named to head an
official funeral committee.
Chernenko, the Josest associate of Brezhnev who in effect
served as a stand-in for the ailing leader for the most part of this
year, is regarded as a possible successor.
The news of Brezhnev's death was broken to the Soviet people
at 11 a.m. Thursday, or almost 27 hours after fatal heart attack.
In the intervening period rumors had swept the city that either he
or another senior figure had passed away.
The delay was believed to have been caused by the absence of a
known mechanism of succession.
Brezhnev successor sought
Moscow — More than 18 hours after the announcement of
President Leonid Brezhnev's death, there were no official
statements to indicate who would succeed him as Chairman of
the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet — and thus as head of state
— and as leader of the party, the real seat of political power in the
Soviet Union.
It appeared likely that the two positions would be separated as
they were before 1977. Western analysts and usually reliable So
viet sources believe Brezhnev's close associate, Konstantin
Chernenko, 71, and the former chairman of the Committee for
State Security, the KGB, Yuri Andropov, 68, who stepped down
from the KGB in May, are the most likely candidates to assume
the more important mantle of party leadership, at least on an in
terim basis.
An official obituary praising Brezhnev as "the most promi
nent political figure of our time" and decrees on funeral arrange
ments were also issued during the day in the name of the Central
Committee, the Supreme Soviet and the Council of Government
Ministers, an indication that all three bodies were meeting in
joint session throughout the day. Late into last evening, lights
were burning brightly in virtually every window of the Central
Committee headquarters, the Council of Ministers building and
at KGB headquarters on Dzerzhinsky Square.
Reagan sends Bush to Moscow funeral
Washington — President Reagan responded yesterday to the
death of Leonid Brezhnev by calling for improved relations with
the Soviet Union but turned down a proposal by his foreign poli
cy advisers that he take what one of them called "the dramatic
step" of attending the funeral of the Soviet president.
Reagan, rejecting the recommendation of Secretary of State
George Schultz, said that Vice President George Bush would
head the U.S. delegation to Moscow.
Shultz had proposed that Reagan take the precedent-setting
step of attending the funeral himself in an effort to improve U.S.-
Soviet relations during a time of transition. "Our two nations
bear a tremendous responsibility for peace in a dangerous time
— a responsibility that we don't take lightly," Reagan said in a
statement opening his news conference last night.
Reagan holds press conference
Washington — President Reagan said last night that he is con
sidering whether to seek a 5-cent-a-gallon gasoline tax to repair
the nation's highways and bridges and create thousands of jobs.
The president, who hinted that he favored the proposal, which
he termed a "user fee" rather than a tax increase, said at a news
conference that it would cost the average motorist $30 more a
year.
Reagan said no decision has been made regarding the tax, but
noted that the additional tax on top of the current 4-cent-a
gallon federal levy would not reduce the incentives to save and
invest from the three-year tax cuts enacted by Congress in 1981.
The president strongly opposed Democratic proposals for
multibiilion dollar job-creating programs, saying they would be
a "drag on the economy and really slow down our effort to re
store the economy." His guideline for considering whether to
veto such measures, the president said, would be whether they
advance or delay recovery from recession.
Replying to another question on possible cuts in defense
spending, the president said, "V/e are looking at everything."
But he indicated that no cuts in defense would be made if they
"delay or set back what we think we need to have to close down
the window of vulnerability (to Soviet attacks) which we in
herited."
Reagan said that foreign agents unquestionably play a role in
the movement for a nuclear weapons freeze, but spokesmen of
the freeze campaign called his charge"documentable baloney."
Reagan said intelligence considerations kept him from laying
out the proof for his assertion.

He said foreign agents — he did not specify Soviets — had
played a role in the pro-freeze demonstrations.
"There has been the organization of some of the big demon
strations — the one in New York and so forth — there is no ques
tion about foreign agents that were sent to help instigate and help
create and keep such a movement going," he said.
Brezhnev's demise draws varied response
Washington — Former President Carter said yesterday that
Leonid Brezhnev's death could prompt the Kremlin to take a
more confrontational stance toward the United States, but one
time Secretary of State Henry Kissinger predicted the Soviets
may mount a "peace offensive."
Their comments illustrated the broad range of reaction voiced
bv President Reagan, senior U.S. officials who have met person
ally with Brezhnev, members of Congress and professional
Kremlinologists.
At the White House, Reagan expressed condolences and de
clared his administration's desire to "work toward an improved
relationship with the Soviet Union." He called Brezhnev "one of
the world's most important figures for nearly two decades."
Reagan's initial comments on Brezhnev's death did not go into
detail on what type of impact the Kremlin succession could have
on the overall fabric of U.S.-Soviet relations.
But Carter, speaking to reporters in Washington, said he
would not be surprised if Moscow shifts temporarily toward "a
more confrontational relationship" with the United States.
Carter's predecessor in the White House, Gerald Ford hoped
that Brezhnev's death " will not lead to a wide swing in the Soviet
policy that would preclude progress toward a reduction in nucle
ar weapons and the solution of other policies between the United
States and the Soviet Union."
Former President Nixon described Brezhnev as "a strong
leader of a strong people. As a Russian, he was warm, effusive,
ebullient. As a Communist, he was a ruthless schemer and a re
lentless aggressor. But he was not a madman. He was a realist.
... He wanted the world. But he did not want war.
(In a Daily interview, Warren Christopher, former deputy sec
retary of state and current member of the Stanford University
Board of Trustees, said this country "is in for an unstable peri
od" due to competition for leadership in the Soviet Union.
"One of the things we know so little about is succession in the
Soviet Union — that's what makes it an unstable period," he
said.
Christopher said he is fairly sure that former KGB chief Yuri
Andropov will take over as party chairman. "His star appears to
have been rising.
"We may look back on Brezhnev as a moderate," he added.)
Polish regime to free Walesa
Warsaw — Interned Solidarity leader Lech Walesa has offered
to help "find a solution" to Poland's problems and will be freed
without conditions in a few days, the martial law regime said yes
terday.
The announcement came a day after the failure of a general
strike called by underground leaders of the outlawed independ
ent labor union.
"If it is true, Lwill be happy," Walesa's wife Danuta told The
Associated Press by telephone from the couple's home in the
northern port city of Gdansk. "I'm full of joy and fear, because I
cannot imagine the crowds of people who will want to see him."
Government spokesman Jerzy Urban told foreign reporters at
a hurriedly called news conference yersterday that Walesa's re
lease would be delayed until sometime in "the next few days be
cause of technical reasons such as different formalities, his lug
gage and so forth."
"No conditions were put to Walesa concerning his release," he
added.
Shuttle deploys commercial satellite
Cape Canaveral — Four American astronauts put the United
States in the space hauling business yesterday when they suc
cessfully released a massive communications satellite from the
space shuttle Columbia and placed it behind them in the vast
open seas of space.
Flying Columbia into orbit on its first operational mission af
ter four test flights, astronauts Vance Brand, Robert Overmyer,
William Lenoir and Joseph Allen carried into orbit with them
almost identical twin satellites to serve the television and tele
phone needs of North America.They deployed the American sat
ellite (the second is Canadian) in precisely the position its com
mercial owners wanted it.
"You've got a lot of happy people down here, Joe," astronaut
Michael Coates called up to Allen from the Mission Control
Center in Houston. "You guys do good work."

"We deliver," replied Allen, who with Lenoir maneuvered the
satellite away from Columbia and into space while Brand and
Overmver flew the 100-ton spaceliner. "You should have seen
how it looked from here."
Reagan expands Habib's Mideast role

served as a stand-in for the ailing leader for the most part of this
year, is regarded as a possible successor.
The news of Brezhnev's death was broken to the Soviet people
at 11 a.m. Thursday, or almost 27 hours after fatal heart attack.
In the intervening period rumors had swept the city that either he
or another senior figure had passed away.
The delay was believed to have been caused by the absence of a
known mechanism of succession.
Brezhnev successor sought
Moscow — More than 18 hours after the announcement of
President Leonid Brezhnev's death, there were no official
statements to indicate who would succeed him as Chairman of
the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet — and thus as head of state
— and as leader of the party, the real seat of political power in the
Soviet Union.
It appeared likely that the two positions would be separated as
they were before 1977. Western analysts and usually reliable So
viet sources believe Brezhnev's close associate, Konstantin
Chernenko, 71, and the former chairman of the Committee for
State Security, the KGB, Yuri Andropov, 68, who stepped down
from the KGB in May, are the most likely candidates to assume
the more important mantle of party leadership, at least on an in
terim basis.
An official obituary praising Brezhnev as "the most promi
nent political figure of our time" and decrees on funeral arrange
ments were also issued during the day in the name of the Central
Committee, the Supreme Soviet and the Council of Government
Ministers, an indication that all three bodies were meeting in
joint session throughout the day. Late into last evening, lights
were burning brightly in virtually every window of the Central
Committee headquarters, the Council of Ministers building and
at KGB headquarters on Dzerzhinsky Square.
Reagan sends Bush to Moscow funeral
Washington — President Reagan responded yesterday to the
death of Leonid Brezhnev by calling for improved relations with
the Soviet Union but turned down a proposal by his foreign poli
cy advisers that he take what one of them called "the dramatic
step" of attending the funeral of the Soviet president.
Reagan, rejecting the recommendation of Secretary of State
George Schultz, said that Vice President George Bush would
head the U.S. delegation to Moscow.
Shultz had proposed that Reagan take the precedent-setting
step of attending the funeral himself in an effort to improve U.S.-
Soviet relations during a time of transition. "Our two nations
bear a tremendous responsibility for peace in a dangerous time
— a responsibility that we don't take lightly," Reagan said in a
statement opening his news conference last night.
Reagan holds press conference
Washington — President Reagan said last night that he is con
sidering whether to seek a 5-cent-a-gallon gasoline tax to repair
the nation's highways and bridges and create thousands of jobs.
The president, who hinted that he favored the proposal, which
he termed a "user fee" rather than a tax increase, said at a news
conference that it would cost the average motorist $30 more a
year.
Reagan said no decision has been made regarding the tax, but
noted that the additional tax on top of the current 4-cent-a
gallon federal levy would not reduce the incentives to save and
invest from the three-year tax cuts enacted by Congress in 1981.
The president strongly opposed Democratic proposals for
multibiilion dollar job-creating programs, saying they would be
a "drag on the economy and really slow down our effort to re
store the economy." His guideline for considering whether to
veto such measures, the president said, would be whether they
advance or delay recovery from recession.
Replying to another question on possible cuts in defense
spending, the president said, "V/e are looking at everything."
But he indicated that no cuts in defense would be made if they
"delay or set back what we think we need to have to close down
the window of vulnerability (to Soviet attacks) which we in
herited."
Reagan said that foreign agents unquestionably play a role in
the movement for a nuclear weapons freeze, but spokesmen of
the freeze campaign called his charge"documentable baloney."
Reagan said intelligence considerations kept him from laying
out the proof for his assertion.

He said foreign agents — he did not specify Soviets — had
played a role in the pro-freeze demonstrations.
"There has been the organization of some of the big demon
strations — the one in New York and so forth — there is no ques
tion about foreign agents that were sent to help instigate and help
create and keep such a movement going," he said.
Brezhnev's demise draws varied response
Washington — Former President Carter said yesterday that
Leonid Brezhnev's death could prompt the Kremlin to take a
more confrontational stance toward the United States, but one
time Secretary of State Henry Kissinger predicted the Soviets
may mount a "peace offensive."
Their comments illustrated the broad range of reaction voiced
bv President Reagan, senior U.S. officials who have met person
ally with Brezhnev, members of Congress and professional
Kremlinologists.
At the White House, Reagan expressed condolences and de
clared his administration's desire to "work toward an improved
relationship with the Soviet Union." He called Brezhnev "one of
the world's most important figures for nearly two decades."
Reagan's initial comments on Brezhnev's death did not go into
detail on what type of impact the Kremlin succession could have
on the overall fabric of U.S.-Soviet relations.
But Carter, speaking to reporters in Washington, said he
would not be surprised if Moscow shifts temporarily toward "a
more confrontational relationship" with the United States.
Carter's predecessor in the White House, Gerald Ford hoped
that Brezhnev's death " will not lead to a wide swing in the Soviet
policy that would preclude progress toward a reduction in nucle
ar weapons and the solution of other policies between the United
States and the Soviet Union."
Former President Nixon described Brezhnev as "a strong
leader of a strong people. As a Russian, he was warm, effusive,
ebullient. As a Communist, he was a ruthless schemer and a re
lentless aggressor. But he was not a madman. He was a realist.
... He wanted the world. But he did not want war.
(In a Daily interview, Warren Christopher, former deputy sec
retary of state and current member of the Stanford University
Board of Trustees, said this country "is in for an unstable peri
od" due to competition for leadership in the Soviet Union.
"One of the things we know so little about is succession in the
Soviet Union — that's what makes it an unstable period," he
said.
Christopher said he is fairly sure that former KGB chief Yuri
Andropov will take over as party chairman. "His star appears to
have been rising.
"We may look back on Brezhnev as a moderate," he added.)
Polish regime to free Walesa
Warsaw — Interned Solidarity leader Lech Walesa has offered
to help "find a solution" to Poland's problems and will be freed
without conditions in a few days, the martial law regime said yes
terday.
The announcement came a day after the failure of a general
strike called by underground leaders of the outlawed independ
ent labor union.
"If it is true, Lwill be happy," Walesa's wife Danuta told The
Associated Press by telephone from the couple's home in the
northern port city of Gdansk. "I'm full of joy and fear, because I
cannot imagine the crowds of people who will want to see him."
Government spokesman Jerzy Urban told foreign reporters at
a hurriedly called news conference yersterday that Walesa's re
lease would be delayed until sometime in "the next few days be
cause of technical reasons such as different formalities, his lug
gage and so forth."
"No conditions were put to Walesa concerning his release," he
added.
Shuttle deploys commercial satellite
Cape Canaveral — Four American astronauts put the United
States in the space hauling business yesterday when they suc
cessfully released a massive communications satellite from the
space shuttle Columbia and placed it behind them in the vast
open seas of space.
Flying Columbia into orbit on its first operational mission af
ter four test flights, astronauts Vance Brand, Robert Overmyer,
William Lenoir and Joseph Allen carried into orbit with them
almost identical twin satellites to serve the television and tele
phone needs of North America.They deployed the American sat
ellite (the second is Canadian) in precisely the position its com
mercial owners wanted it.
"You've got a lot of happy people down here, Joe," astronaut
Michael Coates called up to Allen from the Mission Control
Center in Houston. "You guys do good work."

"We deliver," replied Allen, who with Lenoir maneuvered the
satellite away from Columbia and into space while Brand and
Overmver flew the 100-ton spaceliner. "You should have seen
how it looked from here."
Reagan expands Habib's Mideast role
Washington — President Reagan yesterday named veteran
diplomat Philip Habib his new special representative for the
Middle East, giving him authority over negotiations both for
withdrawal of foreign forces from Lebanon and for the presi
dent's Middle East peace initiative.
Habib said he would pursue both objectives simultaneously.
"Don't think we can't succeed," he told reporters.
It was Habib who last summer negotiated the withdrawal of
Palestinian forces from Beirut, ending the Israeli siege of the city
and bringing U.S. forces to the Mideast as part of a multi
national unit that left once but returned after the massacre of
Palestinians in the Sabra and Shatila camps in mid-September.
With Habib's appointment yesterday, Reagan's team for
pressing U.S. goals in the troubled region is complete.
Italian prime minister resigns
Rome — Prime Minister Giovanni Spadolini submitted his
resignation yesterday, initiating Italy's 43rd government crisis
since World War 11, but President Sandro Pertini refused to ac
cept it.
The attempted resignation capped a Cabinet crisis that
erupted while Spadolini was visiting the United States a week
ago and is centered on feuding among Cabinet ministers over ec
onomic issues.
The official newspaper of Spadolini's small, but influential
Republican Party said he decided to resign "in the last hours in
Los Angeles" during his American trip.
But Pertini's refusal to accept the resignation left the fate of the
2-month-old Spadolini government unclear. A statement from
the presidential palace said only that Pertini had told the prime
minister to refer the government deadlock to Parliament.
The public feuding between the Cabinet's two chief financial
ministers — Nino Andretta, the Christian Democratic minister
of the Treasury, and Rino Formica, the Socialist finance minister
— had reached the stage of personal insults.
Commission concurs on Social Security
Washington — The president's advisory commission on Social
Security unanimously agreed yesterday that the giant system re
quires between $150 billion and $200 billion of tax increases or
benefit cuts in the next seven years to stave off bankruptcy.
The commission, in the first day of a scheduled three-day
meeting here, did not get to the question of how that much mon
ey might be raised.
But economist Alan Greenspan, the commission chairman,
said he regarded agreement simply on the dimensions of the
problem as significant because there has been so much dispute in
the past even over that. In general, Republicans have been saying
major reforms are needed to save the system, and Democrats
that lesser steps might do.
And one commission member, former Rep. Joe Waggonner
(D-La.) said he thinks the commission and Congress will ul
timately find the money in part by curtailing future cost-of-living
increases in benefits and bringing federal, state and local govern
ment employees into the system. He also said it seemed likely
there would be attempts to move forward to 1984 tax increases
now scheduled for 1985, 1986 and 1990,

Soviet leadership stresses continuity

Moscow — The Soviet Union began an uncertain and cumbersome
transfer of power yesterday following the death of President Leonid
Brezhnev, 75, from a heart attack Wednesday. Brezhnev, the fourth man to
occupy the post of Soviet Communist Party leader since the founding of the
Soviet state, had ruled for 18 years.
Calling on the Soviet people to rally firmly behind the party and govern
ment and display "a high sense of awareness and organization," an official
proclamation by the leadership pledged to continue Brezhnev's policy of de
tente and emphasized the continuity of Soviet domestic and foreign policies
in general.
But it also warned about the need for greater vigilance and underscored
that "a crushing retaliatory blow" awaits any potential aggressor. The
statement was issued in the name of the Communist Party Central Commit
tee, the Supreme Soviet (the nation's parliament) and the Council of Min
isters (the Cabinet).
There were no official indications on who would take over Brezhnev's
twin positions as general secretary of the party's Central Committee and
chief of state. Given the extreme secrecy that surrounds party deliberations,
outsiders do not even know how the man, or men, who will assume
Brezhnev's posts and mantle will be chosen.
Diplomatic observers attached considerable importance to the
fact that Yuri Andropov, 68, a senior Politburo member and
former chief of the Soviet secret police, was named to head an
official funeral committee.
Chernenko, the Josest associate of Brezhnev who in effect
served as a stand-in for the ailing leader for the most part of this
year, is regarded as a possible successor.
The news of Brezhnev's death was broken to the Soviet people
at 11 a.m. Thursday, or almost 27 hours after fatal heart attack.
In the intervening period rumors had swept the city that either he
or another senior figure had passed away.
The delay was believed to have been caused by the absence of a
known mechanism of succession.
Brezhnev successor sought
Moscow — More than 18 hours after the announcement of
President Leonid Brezhnev's death, there were no official
statements to indicate who would succeed him as Chairman of
the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet — and thus as head of state
— and as leader of the party, the real seat of political power in the
Soviet Union.

nent political figure of our time" and decrees on funeral arrange
ments were also issued during the day in the name of the Central
Committee, the Supreme Soviet and the Council of Government
Ministers, an indication that all three bodies were meeting in
joint session throughout the day. Late into last evening, lights
were burning brightly in virtually every window of the Central

at KGB headquarters on Dzerzhinsky Square.
