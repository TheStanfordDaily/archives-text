Soviet leadership stresses continuity

Moscow â€” The Soviet Union began an uncertain and cumbersome
transfer of power yesterday following the death of President Leonid
Brezhnev, 75, from a heart attack Wednesday. Brezhnev, the fourth man to
occupy the post of Soviet Communist Party leader since the founding of the
Soviet state, had ruled for 18 years.
Calling on the Soviet people to rally firmly behind the party and govern
ment and display "a high sense of awareness and organization," an official
proclamation by the leadership pledged to continue Brezhnev's policy of de
tente and emphasized the continuity of Soviet domestic and foreign policies
in general.
But it also warned about the need for greater vigilance and underscored
that "a crushing retaliatory blow" awaits any potential aggressor. The
statement was issued in the name of the Communist Party Central Commit
tee, the Supreme Soviet (the nation's parliament) and the Council of Min
isters (the Cabinet).
There were no official indications on who would take over Brezhnev's
twin positions as general secretary of the party's Central Committee and
chief of state. Given the extreme secrecy that surrounds party deliberations,
outsiders do not even know how the man, or men, who will assume
Brezhnev's posts and mantle will be chosen.
