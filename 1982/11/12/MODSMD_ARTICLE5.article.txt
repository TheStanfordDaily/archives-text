# Preliminary financial report
## Students may face 12% tuition hike 
### KATHY CHRISTIE Staff writer 
A 12 percent tuition hike may be in store for the
1983-84 academic year if the projected $3 million
budget gap becomes a reality, Provost Albert
Hastorf announced yesterday at the Faculty Senate
meeting.
Hastorf presented the preliminary financial re
port to the senate, saying that the main cause for the
gap is a projected decrease in research volume which
will cause a decrease in indirect costs recovered from
the federal government. The report does not include
figures for the School of Medicine, the Graduate
School of Business or the research program of the
Hoover Institution.
Hastorf emphasized that although it may be pos
sible to solve the problem with "one hit on the
head," the University will probably choose to ex
tend the financial recovery over the next four years.
Next year, in fact, the preliminary report predicts a
possible $1 million deficit.
"By budgeting a $1 million deficit, if we do have
some improvements in income, if we have been over
ly pessimistic in our research volume estimates, then
that's just lovely," said Hastorf.
Besides the decrease in research volume, Hastorf
pointed to inflation, energy costs, decreases in feder
ally funded student aid and the University's own
"generating new programs" as "forces pushing us
out of balance."
The tuition hike assumes that there will be a 6 per
cent inflation rate. This follows the 15 percent in
crease of 1982-83. Hastorf said that at present it

looks as if the 1984-85 and 1985-86 academic years
will require 9 percent increases. Despite these in
creases, Hastorf emphasized that the University will
continue to be committed to aid-blind admissions
policies, and that there will be no budget cuts to fi
nancial aid. "That costs us money," Hastorf re
marked.
The preliminary forecasts were made on the as
sumption that there will be "full recovery of indirect
costs," Hastorf said. Although he said he hopes the
indirect rate will remain at 69 percent for the
1983-84 year, Hastorf said the University may have
to look for some increase, possibly as much as 4 per
cent.
Hastorf said the preliminary report proposes to
make up $2 million of the gap through a reduction in
the "contribution from the operating budget to the
facility reserve." He said this is the "reserve that we
use to refurbish classrooms, to rebuild and re-equip
laboratories and other crucial aspects of our facil
ities. It is not a reserve to be used for building new
buildings."
In lieu of the 1 percent cutbacks requested of de
partments earlier in the year, Hastorf said, "We
have sent a letter to the deans and directors asking
them to contemplate what they do in order to
get 5 percent out of their budget." He said this could
be done bv such acts as "possibly not replacing a re
signed assistant or secretary, or even faculty mem
ber, and thus saving some money and contributing
that to the central core."
The preliminary financial forecast labels these

two moves as "temporary gap closers."
The "permanent gap closers" that the report men
tions are the restricted funds charge, which officials
hope will generate $1.2 million, a reduction in con
solidations and improvements ($400,000), central
initiatives ($2 million) and budget cuts and new in
come ($3.25 million).
Under the heading of central initiatives, Hastorf
pointed to several specific measures to be taken. "By
increasing our efforts in regard to energy expen
ditures, we can decrease our energy expenditures
and achieve a substantial saving," he said. He also
noted that a "shift from prepaid leases that we have
in the industrial park to leases on an annual basis,
and some of those increases in income will be
pumped into the operating budget. Thirdly, we are
exploring actively the possibility of shifting our
budgeting for sabbatical leaves to the staff benefit
pool."
Stanford is hardly the only school to have finan
cial difficulties. Hastorf noted that, among other
schools, Northwestern was forced to put a freeze on
faculty and staff salaries last year, and M IT is under
going three years of budget-cutting to reduce expen
ditures by $10 million. He also said that such state
schools as the University of Washington and the
University of Michigan have taken a "meat-axe" to
their budgets. He said that these are measures we are
"desperately anxious to avoid."
Hastorf emphasized that although many assump
tions were made in preparing this preliminary re
port, "the issues we have to deal with are still there,
even if the assumptions may change somewhat."

Hastorf emphasized that although it may be pos
sible to solve the problem with "one hit on the
head," the University will probably choose to ex
tend the financial recovery over the next four years.
Next year, in fact, the preliminary report predicts a
possible $1 million deficit.
"By budgeting a $1 million deficit, if we do have
some improvements in income, if we have been over
ly pessimistic in our research volume estimates, then
that's just lovely," said Hastorf.
Besides the decrease in research volume, Hastorf
pointed to inflation, energy costs, decreases in feder
ally funded student aid and the University's own
"generating new programs" as "forces pushing us
out of balance."
The tuition hike assumes that there will be a 6 per
cent inflation rate. This follows the 15 percent in
crease of 1982-83. Hastorf said that at present it

looks as if the 1984-85 and 1985-86 academic years
will require 9 percent increases. Despite these in
creases, Hastorf emphasized that the University will
continue to be committed to aid-blind admissions
policies, and that there will be no budget cuts to fi
nancial aid. "That costs us money," Hastorf re
marked.
The preliminary forecasts were made on the as
sumption that there will be "full recovery of indirect
costs," Hastorf said. Although he said he hopes the
indirect rate will remain at 69 percent for the
1983-84 year, Hastorf said the University may have
to look for some increase, possibly as much as 4 per
cent.
Hastorf said the preliminary report proposes to
make up $2 million of the gap through a reduction in
the "contribution from the operating budget to the
facility reserve." He said this is the "reserve that we
use to refurbish classrooms, to rebuild and re-equip
laboratories and other crucial aspects of our facil
ities. It is not a reserve to be used for building new
buildings."
In lieu of the 1 percent cutbacks requested of de
partments earlier in the year, Hastorf said, "We
have sent a letter to the deans and directors asking
them to contemplate what they do in order to
get 5 percent out of their budget." He said this could
be done bv such acts as "possibly not replacing a re
signed assistant or secretary, or even faculty mem
ber, and thus saving some money and contributing
that to the central core."
The preliminary financial forecast labels these

two moves as "temporary gap closers."
The "permanent gap closers" that the report men
tions are the restricted funds charge, which officials
hope will generate $1.2 million, a reduction in con
solidations and improvements ($400,000), central
initiatives ($2 million) and budget cuts and new in
come ($3.25 million).
Under the heading of central initiatives, Hastorf
pointed to several specific measures to be taken. "By
increasing our efforts in regard to energy expen
ditures, we can decrease our energy expenditures
and achieve a substantial saving," he said. He also
noted that a "shift from prepaid leases that we have
in the industrial park to leases on an annual basis,
and some of those increases in income will be
pumped into the operating budget. Thirdly, we are
exploring actively the possibility of shifting our
budgeting for sabbatical leaves to the staff benefit
pool."
Stanford is hardly the only school to have finan
cial difficulties. Hastorf noted that, among other
schools, Northwestern was forced to put a freeze on
faculty and staff salaries last year, and M IT is under
going three years of budget-cutting to reduce expen
ditures by $10 million. He also said that such state
schools as the University of Washington and the
University of Michigan have taken a "meat-axe" to
their budgets. He said that these are measures we are
"desperately anxious to avoid."
Hastorf emphasized that although many assump
tions were made in preparing this preliminary re
port, "the issues we have to deal with are still there,
even if the assumptions may change somewhat."
A 12 percent tuition hike may be in store for the
1983-84 academic year if the projected $3 million
budget gap becomes a reality, Provost Albert
Hastorf announced yesterday at the Faculty Senate
meeting.
Hastorf presented the preliminary financial re
port to the senate, saying that the main cause for the
gap is a projected decrease in research volume which
will cause a decrease in indirect costs recovered from
the federal government. The report does not include
figures for the School of Medicine, the Graduate
School of Business or the research program of the
Hoover Institution.
Hastorf emphasized that although it may be pos
sible to solve the problem with "one hit on the
head," the University will probably choose to ex
tend the financial recovery over the next four years.
