# CPPC hopeful about job placement

### SID ATKINS Staff writer 
Although the national unemployment rate recently
reached its highest level since the depression, the director
of the Career Planning and Placement Center here is
basically optimistic about the employment opportunities
for qualified people.
Chris Shinkman said that Stanford students have a
"tremendous advantage" when searching for job op
portunities, but he warned, "It's a tough market this year.
College students generally will have to be more ag
gressive, thoughtful, and invest more time in pursuing
positions with companies."
Job opportunities today are more plentiful for techni
cally prepared people like computer scientists and engi
neers, but Shinkman said students should not make ca
reer choices on the basis of statistics.
"Statistics change," he told the Daily. "If someone
would have entered Stanford four years ago and not

wanted to be a teacher because labor market statistics
said that field was bad, they would have made a mistake."
Talented and hard working people are still in demand
in any field, he said. "You see horror stories in the media
about Ph.D.'s driving taxi-cabs and flipping hamburgers
because it makes for interesting reading. But anybody
who has earned a Ph.D. ought to have the brain power to
hustle up a job, if they want one. I don't have much sym
pathy for those that don't."
More than 400 employers will visit the CPPC between
now and April, recruiting Stanford seniors who will enter
the work force after graduation.
About 300 of these organizations are looking for peo
ple with technical backrounds. Shinkman attributed this
imbalance to the ability of large technical firms to have a
recruiting staff. "The recruiting on campus does not rep
resent the world of work," he said.


OUT OF WORK: Students last year waited outside
the Career Planning and Placement Center (CPPC)
to sign up for interviews with the 400 companies who

James Fishman/Daily
visit each year. CPPC officials remain optimistic
that students will still be able to find employment de
spite the high national employment rate.
