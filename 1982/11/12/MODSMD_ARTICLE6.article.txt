# CPPC hopeful about job placement
## 
### SID ATKINS Staff writer 
Although the national unemployment rate recently
reached its highest level since the depression, the director
of the Career Planning and Placement Center here is
basically optimistic about the employment opportunities
for qualified people.
Chris Shinkman said that Stanford students have a
"tremendous advantage" when searching for job op
portunities, but he warned, "It's a tough market this year.
College students generally will have to be more ag
gressive, thoughtful, and invest more time in pursuing
positions with companies."
Job opportunities today are more plentiful for techni
cally prepared people like computer scientists and engi
neers, but Shinkman said students should not make ca
reer choices on the basis of statistics.
"Statistics change," he told the Daily. "If someone
would have entered Stanford four years ago and not

wanted to be a teacher because labor market statistics
said that field was bad, they would have made a mistake."
Talented and hard working people are still in demand
in any field, he said. "You see horror stories in the media
about Ph.D.'s driving taxi-cabs and flipping hamburgers
because it makes for interesting reading. But anybody
who has earned a Ph.D. ought to have the brain power to
hustle up a job, if they want one. I don't have much sym
pathy for those that don't."
More than 400 employers will visit the CPPC between
now and April, recruiting Stanford seniors who will enter
the work force after graduation.
About 300 of these organizations are looking for peo
ple with technical backrounds. Shinkman attributed this
imbalance to the ability of large technical firms to have a
recruiting staff. "The recruiting on campus does not rep
resent the world of work," he said.


OUT OF WORK: Students last year waited outside
the Career Planning and Placement Center (CPPC)
to sign up for interviews with the 400 companies who

James Fishman/Daily
visit each year. CPPC officials remain optimistic
that students will still be able to find employment de
spite the high national employment rate.
In addition to setting up the campus
interviews, the CPPC organizes a series
of workshops designed to improve stu
dents' job search techniques. In these
workshops, strategies, resume writing
and interview techniques are discussed.

Shinkman said that despite the tight
job situation, a greater number of stu
dents do not seem to be heading to
graduate school, thereby delaying the
frustration of looking for a job. "Stu
dents are starting to take into con
sideration the money and time invest
ment involved in attending some gradu
ate schools. In law, many are applying
to the top schools only. They're think
ing that it wouldn't be a sound invest
ment to go to a lesser known school."
He said that his staff is beginning to see
a glut of potential lawyers and MBAs.
Statistics confirm that fewer students

today plan to attend graduate school
directly out of college than in the mid
'7os. In a survey administered to seniors
bv the Undergraduate Studies Office in
1975, 53 percent of all participating stu
dents indicated that they planned to
enter graduate school immediately.
That figure has decreased to 37 per
cent, according to a survey adminis
tered to the Class of 1982. The recent
survey also showed that 89 percent of
the student body here plans to attend
some form of graduate school even
tually.
John Boli, research coordinator for
the Undergraduate Research Office,
said the decline in the number of stu
dents entering graduate school right
away is due in part to the increased pop
ularity of the MBA. Business schools
generally like their applicants to have at
least two years of work experience.
"Their is a perception among stu
dents today that they can't go to grad
school right away. The funding isn't as
available anymore, so many students

feel they can't afford grad school," Boli
said.
Bob Schulman is a senior in math sci
ence who hopes to do programming for
an engineering firm after graduation.
He said he is not worried about getting
a job, and planned to do all his in
terviewing at the CPPC.
"For technical majors the op
portunities are there right now. If you
want to work for a big company, they'll
be on campus. All the companies from
my home town even came to campus,"
Schulman said.
The outlook for some liberal arts ma
jors who wish to work right after gradu
ation does not appear as bright. As
Janet Craycroft, a history major who
plans to attend law school, put it,"I
went down to the CPPC once this year
and discovered that I could work for
Macv's or Bullock's if 1 wanted to. If I
had been intent on getting a job right
out of Stanford I would have been an
engineer."
