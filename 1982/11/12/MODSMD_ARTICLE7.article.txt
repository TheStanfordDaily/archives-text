Campus residents voted overwhelm
ingly for Democratic candidates and
liberal ballot initiatives last week, per
haps indicating that Stanford votersare
a solidly liberal pocket in a conservative
state.

News analysis

Unofficial totals for the 10 campus
precincts showed that campus voters
supported most heavily two measures
— Proposition J 1, the "bottle bill," and
Proposition 15, the handgun regis
tration intiative — that were easilv de
feated in statewide voting.
Proposition 11 received 2663 "ves
votes on campus, 87 percent of those
cast, compared to a 44 percent favor
able vote statewide. The disparity was
even greater with Proposition 15, which

was favored by onlv 37 percent of the
voters in the state but received 2610
votes, an 86 percent majority, on cam
pus.
Two other controversial proposi
tions were almost as successful at Stan
ford. Proposition 12, the nuclear freeze
initiative, which passed by a slim 4 per
centage points statewide, won 83 per
cent of the campus vote. Proposition
13, the water resources bill, was ap
proved by 82 percent of Stanford voters
but resoundingly defeated on the state
level.
The four liberal propositions were
also supported by Palo Alto voters,
though not to the same extent. Af
firmative totals there ranged from 67
percent in favor of the water bill to 73
percent supporting the freeze initiative.
Democratic candidates for office also
took the campus vote bv surprisingly
wide margins. Los Angeles Mayor Tom
Bradley polled 81 percent in the

gubernatorial voting; he had a nearly
2000-vote edge on campus, while losing
by just over 50,000 votes statewide.
Gov. Brown, who won 68 percent of the
campus vote, did 21 percentage points
better in the U.S. Senate race here than
he did overall.
Campus voters went along with the
majority in the local congressional and
Assembly races, both of which were
won by Democratic incumbents. Rep.
Tom Lantos (D-San Mateo) took 78
percent of the campus vote, substantial-

ly above his
district-win
ning total. As
semblyman
Byron Sher,
who won re
election by a

more than 2-to-l margin, did even bet
ter on campus, taking 84 percent of the
vote.

Stanford voters appeared to be vot
ing the Democratic ticket in the less
prominent statewide races also. The
Democratic candidates, all of whom
won, received a consistent 70 to 75 per
cent of the campus vote. The lone ex
ception was the battle for lieutenant
governor, wh.ere Republican Carol
Hallett pulled up to 35 percent of the
vote in some precincts.
This pattern held for the first five
propositions, all bond issues which
were victorious on the state level.
Third-party candidates did only
slightly better on campus than
elsewhere, rarclv polling better than 5
percent of the votes cast.
Totals were fairly uniform across the
10 precincts. Results from the Escon
dido Village polling place and the three
precincts covering faculty residence
areas showed slightly smaller majorities
for the propositions.
