## 
### GLEN ALLERHAND Staff writer 
Donald John Amos, the suspect in the stabbing
death of Stanford student Angela Arvidson,
walked into a jail in San Jose and turned himself in
to Santa Clara County sheriffs early yesterday
morning.
"I'm Don Amos. I understand you guys are
looking for me," the suspect reportedly said to the
sheriffs.
Amos, 29, was then placed under arrest and
questioned by Sgt. Tom Beck and Detective Mike
Lombardo. He is scheduled to be arraigned today.
Amos had been sought in the Oct. 22 slaying of
Arvidson, a junior here, who was found stabbed in
the Stanford home of Laurence Kedes, associate
professor in the Medical School. Arvidson had
been working as a part-time housekeeper for the
family.
A Santa Clara County judge issued a no-bail ar
rest warrant for Amos on Oct. 26.

Stanford Police Chief Marvin Herrington
speculated yesterday that Amos was forced to sur
render because he had "no resources." Her
rington said he had heard rumors that Amos' fam
ily had remained with him following Arvidson's
death.
Amos and his wife Gwendolyn, 22, have three
children. Floyd Rogers, Amos' father-in-law, said
yesterday he knew nothing about the suspect's
surrender or whereabouts since the slaying.
He said he learned from his wife in a brief
telephone conversation that she and the children
were all right. Rogers said he felt relief that he
"had his daughter and grandchildren back
again."
Other reactions to Amos' surrender varied.
Michael Torrey, Arvidson's stepfather, said he
and his wife, Marlene Torrey, felt "immense re
lief." Torrey added that if Amos is the killer, "We
pray that justice is served with a solid conviction."
He said the Sheriff's Office informed

him of the surrender in a phone call yesterday
morning about 9:20.
Donald Arvidson, the victim's father, gave the
following response: "I guess ever since the after
noon of Oct. 22, the matter has been in the hands
of the Santa Clara County District Attorney's of
fice."
Arvidson said he had heard the news of the sur
render from the Torreys. The police did not con
tact him.
Shirley Kedes, resident of the home where
Angela was killed, said the family felt a "sense of
relief." She said Herrington had called yesterday
morning. Kedes said her husband had tried unsuc
cessfully to contact Donald Arvidson upon learn
ing the news.
Kedes expressed surprise at the surrender, add
ing that the "vigilance" of police may have been
an influential factor.
She said Amos had already been given a "sec
ond chance" in life, referring to his release after

serving a one-year sentence for assault with a
deadly weapon in 1975. Kedes said now the killer
has "ruined his life and the lives of his family."
Police named Amos as the suspect in the case
after the Kedes' son Todd found a receipt with a
notation for trash can liner bags in the driveway of
their home.
Amos worked as a deliveryman for the Los
Altos-based firm of Tompkins Promotions. Amos
had been scheduled to make a delivery to the
Kedes home the day of the slaying.
Authorities obtained a search warrant for
Amos' home, where they found a bloodied pair of
jeans and a torn flannel shirt.
An all-points bulletin was issued on the Sunday
after the killing. Amos, described as six-foot
three-inches tall and 210 pounds, was thought at
the time to be headed for California's Central Val
ley. Herrington said that since the slaying, police
had received reports placing Amos in the Bay
