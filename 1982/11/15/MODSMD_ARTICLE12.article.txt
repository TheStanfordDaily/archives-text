## The
						Stanford Daily Teetering Lebanese peace 
### 
An eight-story Israeli headquarters collapsed in
the Lebanese city of Tyre recently, killing 94 per
sons — both Israeli soldiers and Palestinians being
held by Israelis for questioning. Israeli officials first
blamed the building's destruction on Palestinian
fighters, but an Israeli general later said the tragedy
may have been caused by a structural fault.
His suggestion is particularly apt for American
officials as they entangle more Marines in the
teetering, temporary structure of Lebanese peace.
Like the recent disaster, renewed hostilities would
prompt blame passed by all sides — but would, sad
ly, probably stem from structural flaws.
American midterm elections and Soviet deaths
have forced the changing American presence in
Lebanon from the attention of the general public. If
there is anything that deserves scrutiny and official
justification, it is the extent to which American
troops are maintaining the rickety "peace
framework" and how large American involvement
is in case the structure comes down.
The American peacekeeping presence which
started as a token force near the Beirut airport has
increasingly become a force designed to separate
warring parties that control four-fifths of Lebanon.
American Marines are now stationed in the streets
of East Beirut and have begun to patrol sections of
the crucial and much-disputed Beirut to Demascus
highway. It is hardly reassuring that this expanded
American role is subject to open, informed debate
when the State Department refers to the involve
ment as increased "traffic monitoring".
In a nation divvied up between remaining Palesti
nian Liberation Organization members, Syrian

troops, Christian Phalangists, Israeli armored
units, the international peacekeeping force and —
lest we forget — the Lebanese government forces, it
is foolhardy to think that a few more American
troops in a few more locations would bring peace to
the nation. What the troops may do is bring the ex
tra months of peace necessary for some sort of dip
lomatic success.
Despite the Reagan administration's belief in the
persuasion of force, U.S. troops will not do much
convincing in Lebanon. However much American
officials would wish the world back to the 19505, a
more complex, bitter and bloody Lebanese situ
ation prevents the success of an Eisenhower-styled
Marine landing patterned on that of 1956.
Americans are rightly attempting to find a diplo
matic settlement to the region's immediate con
flicts. Special envoy Philip Habib has hopped on
the Mideast shuttle in place of Morris Draper, with
the hope that Habib's past trips give him the
leverage to achieve a settlement. However, the
questions of what the exact role of how many
American troops in what parts of Lebanon for ex
actly how long still remain and go pitifully un
answered.
American troop commitment should not be per
ceived in any quarter, especially a White House
drooling at the prospect of extended American in
fluence in the Mideast, as the solution for the re
gion's conflicts, and only constant scrutiny and
questioning will limit U.S. troop involvement.
American arms cannot strengthen a structure
threatening to topple at the gust of war rumors.
Only diplomacy can remedy structural flaws.
