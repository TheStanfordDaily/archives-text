## Middle-class guiltists pervert the rape issue 
### 
Guiltism, an amorphous and inchoate species of
leftism, appeared on the American scene in the
1960s in response to the various "social justice"
crusades of that era and persists today as the con
ventional "attitude set" (I'd hestitate to say "wis
dom") of many college-educated people. Unlike the
conventional liberalism that preceded it, the logic of
guiltism rests primarily on the psychological vulner
abilities of those espousing it rather than on a con
sistent and balanced application of political princi
ple to specific issues. Its moorings are in the emo
tional claims made by the peer group combined with
the psychological terror that aggressive activists are
able to muster against potential dissenters.
For example, a liberal would support equal rights
for women because he believes the accident of
gender shouldn't impose liabilities on a person's op
portunities. A guiltist, in contrast, feels compelled to
go much further. He must crusade against "male
dominance," which is whatever the militants tell
him it is and work to change "male consciousness"
accordingly. To avoid being labeled a "racist" he'll
make sure his opinions are in line with whatever the
militants tell him "racism" now means. Carried
along by the emotional logic of guilt he soon loses
whatever faculty he had to distinguish between posi
tions taken on sensible principle and stands taken
because of the activists' terror, which may easily
lead him to apply moral criteria in contradictory
ways.
The dynamic behind guiltism is the inability of
middle-class Americans to stand up to aggressive
militants in their midst when the latter succeed in
persuading others that some cherished American
principle hasn't been adhered to in their case. This is
the militants' "leverage" and it explains how so
many Americans threw reason to the wind and be
came guiltists during the 1960s and thereafter.

Using the twisted logic that developed, they op
posed the Pentagon because American troops were
killing women and children in Vietnam but couldn't
denounce the communists, who were killing plenty
of women and children then and were to kill or
brutalize many more later. Moral blinders had to be
donned because at schools like Stanford the guiltists
worried about antagonizing "Third World" mili-

The irony is that social defenses
against rape and other crimes —
which presumably guiltists like
anyone else would abhor — are
weakened as judges, members of
parole boards and others catch
the spirit and begin to share in the
collective guilt about felons who
either shouldn *t be behind bars
(that's cruel) or shouldn't be
behind them too long.

tants (mostly home-grown) who had an emotional
stranglehold on the community. (Had non-comba
tant casualties occasioned the same level of concern
during World Warr 11, allied arms would never have
liberated Europe).
And it persists. Take the attitude toward; the
problem of rape, for example. Because lower-in
come people and minorities are disproportionately

more apt to be involved in crime and go to prison
than middle-class people like himself, the guiltist
can't take a hard-line stand against criminals. That
could get him into trouble with the militants. But if
he advocates male escorts for females at night, that
may get him into trouble with the feminists. That the
activists may not hold views truly representative of
the groups they claim to "lead" either doesn't occur
to the guiltist or wouldn't matter if it did because it is
the activists who can disturb his peace of mind, not
the masses they claim to represent.
The guiltist may then be left with only frivolous
remedies to recommend (e.g. men should change
their fundamental attitudes towarc# women, stop
telling rape jokes, or move about the campus at
night in ways that won't frighten women). (
The irony is that social defenses against rape and
other crimes — which presumably guiltists like any
one else would abhor — are weakened as judges,
members of parole boards and others catch the spirit
and begin to share in the collective guilt about felons
who either shouldn't be behind bars (that's cruel) or
shouldn't be behind them too long. When one reads
how assaultive felons are being rotated in and out of
prison, getting minimal sentences, one wonders how
our society can properly be considered a civilization.
In the case of rape, nothing could be more op
pressive of womens' rights, not even old-fashioned
male chivalry. But the guiltists' approach to the
problem, which is to sermonize to try and change
middle-class sex-role attitudes, is hardly an answer.
Because I think universities should be centers of
reason rather than sandboxes for guiltist "con
sciousness raising," I nominate guiltism as the
"ism" to be combatted during the 1980s and offer
this editorial as the opening salvo in the campaign.
