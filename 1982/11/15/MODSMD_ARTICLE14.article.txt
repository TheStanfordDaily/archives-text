## Libertarians oppose statism, favor liberty 
### 
Hypocrites, narcissists, cultists, So
cial Darwinists, Utopians and unthink
ing supporters of a narrow party line
was the Daily's recent editorial
judgment on the Libertarian Party's
members and their philosophy
("Beware the Libertarian dream," Nov.
5). While the Daily's language might be
considered to be normal election-time
invective and abuse, a cursory reading
of any libertarian literature, either of
the Party itself, or preferably other
more scholarly material, would have
quickly shown how absurd such accusa
tions are.
It is a canard that Libertarians are
merely warmed-over- 19th-century So
cial Darwinists. This view ignores the
differences between the modern liber
tarian movement and Social Darwinists
such as Andrew Carnegie and misin
terprets aspects of Social Darwinist
thought. For example, neither Herbert
Spencer nor William Graham Sumner
ever opposed in principle individuals'
charitable acts. What they did oppose
was the coercive expropriation of the
taxpayers' resources by the state for so
called charitable purposes.
Spencer's and Sumner's opposition
was libertarian in that it was based,
first, on the principle that to violate
anyone's rights for whatever reason was
a crime; and second, on the insight than
handing money over to the state creates
nothing, but merely increases the state's
size and scope by giving jobs to un
productive bureaucrats and power to
politicians.
The Libertarian solution to poverty
is to end inflation (by ending the Feder
al Reserve's irresponsible expansion of
credit); to create jobs (by ending regu
lations that prevent business from ex
panding and by eliminating progressive
income taxes that prevent small busi
nesses from accumulating the capital to

employ more people); and, where nec
essary, to encourage private charity.
Libertarians want to free the individ
ual from political and economic restric
tions that are created by the state to
protect the privileged interest groups
that feed off it. Examples of such re
strictions include agricultural price sup
ports, tariffs and quotas on foreign
steel, restrictions on sexual practices,
conscription, taxes to pay for the mili
tary, ad infinitum.
The Daily editorial interpreted this
desire to free the individual from all
artificial political bonds as an attempt
to do without any commitment to
broader social ties. In fact, the opposite
is the case. The Libertarian wants to
eliminate all state-imposed bonds that
tie the individual to church, state or
community, precisely because individ
uals will thus be enabled to form them
selves into whatever groups they desire.
Families, communities and regions
would be able to secede from the cen
tralized state in order to peacefully
pursue their own visions of the good
and the just. What is at issue is not
rugged, atomistic individualism vs.
commitment to community, but how
social bonds and communities are to be
organized. Either they are enforced by
state power, or they are the result of vol
untary and peaceful organization by
free individuals.
The Daily's charge of irresponsibility
and anti-intellectualism with regard to
Libertarian educational policy is also
unfounded. Libertarians oppose com
pulsory attendance laws and state fi
nance of education, which is not the
same thing as opposing —*or denigrat
ing — education per se. Again, the
question is over the proper ends, not the
means. As individualists, libertarians
arc committed to developing the full
potential of each and every person, but

to do so requires an environment as free
of violence and intimidation as pos
sible. Unfortunately, state education
has as its very essence the coercion of
the tax collector, curriculum officer and
the truant officer. According to the lib
ertarians, a real sense of community
cannot develp if children are forcibly
taught unquestioning respect for state
power, the justice of imperial ex
pansion and the oppression of less-or
ganized and less powerful groups such
as blacks, native americans and Third
World peasants, all in the name of
"public" education.
It is indeed strange that Libertarians
are accused of supporting a "Fortress
America foreign policy." That is what
we have now; a garrison state with hun
dreds of thousands of troops all over
the world and an economically crippl
ing military-industrial complex at
home. All this libertarians unalterably
oppose.
Instead, libertarians look to the clas
sical-liberal tradition of free trade and
the free movement of capital and people
throughout the world, rather than the
garrison state, to end the threat of war.
Libertarians would like to see:
• the complete withdrawal of all
American foreign-based troops to
within the borders of the U.S.;
•»the demobilization of these hun
dreds of thousands of unproductive and
tax-consuming soldiers and their trans
ferral to civilian industry;
• the dismantling of the horrific mili
tary-industrial complex and the privi
leged "new class" that benefits from
tax-funded war production and re
search;
• the total abolition of the intrusive
and aggressive CIA;
• the immediate dismantling of the
nuclear arsenal. From a libertarian

point of view, the use of such weapons is t
immoral, because they are in
discriminate in their destruction; they
annihilate the innocent and peaceful
along with the aggressive. i
In the libertarian view, defense policy
must return to the function of protect
ing the individual and his or her proper
ty from aggression, rather than con
suming hundreds of billions of dollars,
distorting the economy and aggravat
ing world tensions with foreign in
terventions and pointless arms race.
A final point concerns the accusation
that Libertarians are insincere and hyp
ocritical. Libertarians have a deeply
held conviction that all forms of coer
cion are wrong and intolerable. They
believe that the state is the embodiment
of physical force and intimidation and
should therefore be opposed.
A well-defined theory of property
rights is, in the libertarian view, the sin
gle best means to achieve security for
the individual against the predations of
the state or other individuals. Liber
tarians' abhorrence of coercion and the
violation of personal and property
rights leads to a feeling of indignation
that so much injustice exists in the
world.
It also leads to a feeling of solidarity ,
with those groups victimized by the ,
state, whether it be the poor, suffering
from unemployment and inflation, the I
peasants of Latin American countries,
struggling for peace and land rights
against American-supported regimes,
or the creative and productive individ- ;
uals who are hampered by progressive
taxation and regulation. In the liber- i
tarian's eyes, all suffer at the hands of 1
the state and all deserve justice.

rights leads to a feeling of indignation
that so much injustice exists in the

peasants of Latin American countries,

Hypocrites, narcissists, cultists, So
cial Darwinists, Utopians and unthink
ing supporters of a narrow party line
was the Daily's recent editorial
judgment on the Libertarian Party's
members and their philosophy
("Beware the Libertarian dream," Nov.
5). While the Daily's language might be
considered to be normal election-time
invective and abuse, a cursory reading
of any libertarian literature, either of
the Party itself, or preferably other
more scholarly material, would have
quickly shown how absurd such accusa
tions are.
It is a canard that Libertarians are
merely warmed-over- 19th-century So
cial Darwinists. This view ignores the
differences between the modern liber
tarian movement and Social Darwinists
such as Andrew Carnegie and misin
terprets aspects of Social Darwinist
thought. For example, neither Herbert
Spencer nor William Graham Sumner
ever opposed in principle individuals'
charitable acts. What they did oppose
was the coercive expropriation of the
taxpayers' resources by the state for so
called charitable purposes.
Spencer's and Sumner's opposition
was libertarian in that it was based,
first, on the principle that to violate
anyone's rights for whatever reason was
a crime; and second, on the insight than
handing money over to the state creates
nothing, but merely increases the state's
size and scope by giving jobs to un
productive bureaucrats and power to
politicians.
The Libertarian solution to poverty
is to end inflation (by ending the Feder
al Reserve's irresponsible expansion of
credit); to create jobs (by ending regu
lations that prevent business from ex
panding and by eliminating progressive
income taxes that prevent small busi
nesses from accumulating the capital to

employ more people); and, where nec
essary, to encourage private charity.
Libertarians want to free the individ
ual from political and economic restric
tions that are created by the state to
protect the privileged interest groups
that feed off it. Examples of such re
strictions include agricultural price sup
ports, tariffs and quotas on foreign
steel, restrictions on sexual practices,
conscription, taxes to pay for the mili
tary, ad infinitum.
The Daily editorial interpreted this
desire to free the individual from all
artificial political bonds as an attempt
to do without any commitment to
broader social ties. In fact, the opposite
is the case. The Libertarian wants to
eliminate all state-imposed bonds that
tie the individual to church, state or
community, precisely because individ
uals will thus be enabled to form them
selves into whatever groups they desire.
Families, communities and regions
would be able to secede from the cen
tralized state in order to peacefully
pursue their own visions of the good
and the just. What is at issue is not
rugged, atomistic individualism vs.
commitment to community, but how
social bonds and communities are to be
organized. Either they are enforced by
state power, or they are the result of vol
untary and peaceful organization by
free individuals.
The Daily's charge of irresponsibility
and anti-intellectualism with regard to
Libertarian educational policy is also
unfounded. Libertarians oppose com
pulsory attendance laws and state fi
nance of education, which is not the
same thing as opposing —*or denigrat
ing — education per se. Again, the
question is over the proper ends, not the
means. As individualists, libertarians
arc committed to developing the full
potential of each and every person, but

to do so requires an environment as free
of violence and intimidation as pos
sible. Unfortunately, state education
has as its very essence the coercion of
the tax collector, curriculum officer and
the truant officer. According to the lib
ertarians, a real sense of community
cannot develp if children are forcibly
taught unquestioning respect for state
power, the justice of imperial ex
pansion and the oppression of less-or
ganized and less powerful groups such
as blacks, native americans and Third
World peasants, all in the name of
"public" education.
It is indeed strange that Libertarians
are accused of supporting a "Fortress
America foreign policy." That is what
we have now; a garrison state with hun
dreds of thousands of troops all over
the world and an economically crippl
ing military-industrial complex at
home. All this libertarians unalterably
oppose.
Instead, libertarians look to the clas
sical-liberal tradition of free trade and
the free movement of capital and people
throughout the world, rather than the
garrison state, to end the threat of war.
Libertarians would like to see:
• the complete withdrawal of all
American foreign-based troops to
within the borders of the U.S.;
•»the demobilization of these hun
dreds of thousands of unproductive and
tax-consuming soldiers and their trans
ferral to civilian industry;
• the dismantling of the horrific mili
tary-industrial complex and the privi
leged "new class" that benefits from
tax-funded war production and re
search;
• the total abolition of the intrusive
and aggressive CIA;
• the immediate dismantling of the
nuclear arsenal. From a libertarian

point of view, the use of such weapons is t
immoral, because they are in
discriminate in their destruction; they
annihilate the innocent and peaceful
along with the aggressive. i
