# Notes in the Margin
## Technological society in 2010 
### 
The year: 2010. Two men are sitting
on a white porcelain bench outside a
treatment room. There is a beastly glare
coming from the ceiling lights, but the
two don't seem to notice. Clearly,
they're part of society's dangerous, re
gressive element. The back of each of
their white cotton-nylon tunics reads, in
computer-terminal green: "techno-de
mented."

Squinting in the light, the one on the
right starts up a conversation. "You
never told me, when did you first notice
you were a true deviant?" Like the oth
er, his hair is cropped painfully short,
but his blue eves shine suddenly as he
poses the question, as if recalling a time
long past.
"If I remember, it was way back in
'75 when my dad bought me a hand cal
culator for mv high school chemistry
class. For all its batteries and buttons,
the square root function wouldn't work
— probably a case of factory techno
sabotage. So, I'd always have to round
off — you can imagine the ridicule I suf
fered!"
"What a nightmare! I guess you had
no choice after that. It's like the robo
doctors say: 'Techno-degeneracy and
disillusion can usually be traced to the
patient's youth.' No wonder you ended
up here."
"Yeah. And you? You told me about
the arrest, but where are the roots? How
did your deviance start?"
"I think back in mv senior year in col
lege."
"What happened? Were you one of
the "overdose reaction" engineers who
rejected all their formulas when the jobs
dried up in the '80s and before the state
founded those techno-tanks?"
"No, no, no. I was a die-hard reac
tionary from the beginning. We had a
choice, and I declared social science as a
freshman. My folks kept saying I was
avoiding reality and headed for a rude
awakening, but you know the idealism
of youth."
"Sure, but wasn't it exciting? Re
member that job market under Reagan?
What a challenge — so biological, dog
eat-dog, struggle or starve! I was a hu
manities graduate and proud. Ah, the
glories of a B.A. — did you get one of
those? My little brother, the vice-min
ister of computers up in the O-sector
now, used to laugh at me when he'd
come home from college and I was
working in a grocery store. '8.A.,' he'd
say, you schmuk, all that stands for is
Bad Advice!"
"Hold on there,this was my story, re
member? I was a senior when suddenly
one day this card arrives in the mail. 'In
stant Teller' it was called: free checking,
a tax credit, unlimited hours, football
tickets, read your fortune and I don't
know what else."
"I think I got one of those too, but I
threw it awav."

"Well, at the time, I thought it was
progressive. So, there I was, inching up
in line, so anxious that it was I was
in a boat going upriver in search of
Kurtz's camp or something. Then, I
saw it."
"What. . . who?"
"The gaping jaws of the electronic
devil as its plastic mug widened. The
guy in front of me had already thrust his
beautiful red, white and blue card in as
a sacrifice. Swallowed whole. Beep
burp. He looked scared, but punched in
some electronic song that seemed to
sooth the beast: beep, bop, beep, bop,
beep. That guy had real guts; I was
shaking."
"Go on, what did you do?"
"Finally, the machine spit him out
some sort of bribe. 1 think they were in
cahoots. Maybe he was a computer sci
ence TA or something. Who knows?
The thing disgorged his card, he began
counting his money and I moved up,
But all I remember seeing is those giani
plastic jaws about to slam shut on me.
took off as fast as 1 could run."
"You survived. That's what counts."
"A few months later, when I wen
home after graduation, I tried to tell mj
little sister about it. I wanted to warn
her. "But 'they' had already gotten her. •
The video game generation of the earljk
'80s, remember?"
"Yeah, converted so many young
ones, even before techno-worship be
came mandatory in the schools. We're
some of the last ones left I guess. When
the technology police caught up with
me, I'd been reduced to teaching finger
painting to four-year-old pre-computes
in a nursery. I thought it was all over."
Suddenly, the white doors of the
treatment room swing open and a
gleaming robot snatches up the speak
er, pulling him towards the humming
consoles inside
"It's time again, but I promise to you
friend, I'll never let them teach me
FORTRAN, never!"
The other smiled and waiting until
the two had disappeared, slid his fingers
into his white hospital boots. With a
black magic market, he began scribbl
ing outlandish counter-revolutionary
graffiti on the brilliant formica walls.
