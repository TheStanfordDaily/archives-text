# University to consider ASSU recycling subsidy
## 
### KEVIN GROSS Staff Writer 
In an effort to keep alive its recycling
program, the ASSU has asked the Uni
versity to subsidize partially the service,
claiming that it saves the University
money that would otherwise be spent
on trash disposal.
"The recycling program is saving the
University over $19,000 annually in
dump fees, hauling costs and janitorial
wages," said council of presidents
member Cynthia Mathewson. She said
this amount was determined using a
formula based on the University's own
figures for trash disposal costs.
"We are optimistic that the nego
tiations with (Vice President of Busi
ness and Finance) Bill Massy will suc
ceed," Mathewson said, but added that
the negotiations are only in the pre
liminary stage.
Leslie' Young, a director of ASSU
Recycling, was also hopeful, although
she described a recent discussion be
tween the COP and University officials
as "not a good meeting." Young and
Fred Beddall, ASSU recycling coordi
nator, will begin meeting with Univer
sity officials this week in hopes of reach
ing a compromise on program funding.
Noting that many people in the Uni
versity administration feel that there
ought to be a recycling program, Dean
of Student Affairs James Lyons said,
"Some of us cannot imagine the Uni
versity without a recycling program .. .
The big question is, are there the re
sources to do it?"

Although he is optimistic about the
program's chances of obtaining Uni
versity funds this year, Lyons said,
"The real issue is next year, when re
cycling will be competing with other
programs for funding." The University
is expected to have its own $3 million
budget deficit this year.
Student Financial Manager Bob
Brody said University subsidization of
the recycling program "makes good
business sense." He also stressed the ur
gency of the problem, noting that the
recycling program lost $18,000 last year
and is projected to lose $16,000 to
$17,000 this year. Unless the program
receives additional revenue, the total
ASSU budget deficit for this year will
be more than $27,000.
"Unless the program comes up with
some type of outside support by
Thanksgiving, it is likely that it will be
canceled," he said, referring to an
earlier ASSU Senate action setting a
Dec. 10 deadline for the program to
"prove itself to have made substantial
progress towards self-sufficiency."
All of the ASSU officials stressed
that this was not a "bail-out" proposal,
because the University would be fund
ing a program the ASSU claims has
probably saved it over $49,000 in trash
removal and disposal costs since the
program's inception in 1978. Brody
said the funding proposal was "more
like a subsidy. Paying for a service pro
vided."
