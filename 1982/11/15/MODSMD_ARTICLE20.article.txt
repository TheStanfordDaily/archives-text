# Newest student-produced magazine features interview format
## 
### KATHY CHRISTIE Staff writer 
Those who noticed lights in the Publica
tions Board room at wee hours this past
weekend were witnesses to the genesis of the
University's newest student-produced maga
zine: Stanford Interview.
The magazine, which is scheduled to be out
bv this Thursday, is the brainchild of seniors
Michael Weiss and Brett Love.
"We wanted to do something that had not
been done in our four years here," explained
Weiss. "We first thought about making a
movie about students here, but we decided
that was not feasible this quarter."
When asked why he expects Stanford In
terview to be different than other magazines
on campus, Weiss replied,"We're going to
make it very easy to read; it's going to com
pletely pleasurable."
"We wanted to produce something that
would actually get read, that would appeal to
the whole community," said Love. "We tried
to come up with a formula that would do that.
Certain other magazines just appeal to a cer
tain type of group, and that's why they're not
well-circulated. That's why we hit on the in
terview format."
"The original idea was Andy Warhol's In
terview magazine. We also wanted to do
things that did well on this campus," Love
continued, adding that he had noticed that
the only magazine that "really did well in the
last few years was Inside Stanford when they
did the Sex at Stanford story."
Stanford Interview will contain a "com
parative sex survey with Eastern schools —
Harvard and Yale — and Western Schools —
Berkeley, USC and Stanford," said Love. In
it, he said that "we try to come to some con
clusions about whether there are differences
between East and West, between North and
South." In keeping with the format of the
magazine, interviews with a "fraternity presi

dent at Berkeley and a former president of the
Panhellenic Council at USC" are also fea
tured in the article.
Weiss said that the first issue contains in
terviews with people that, "are different in
that they combine qualities that most people
only have one of. Ceci Hopp: she's number
one runner in the country and she's also ex
tremely prettv. Mike Heise: he's constantly in
shows, he's an athlete and he's also a poten
tial Rhodes scholar."
Besides Hopp and Heise, Love said, "We
have Mike Boone, who is a computer soft
ware wiz, owns a corporation and talks about
grossing a million dollars with a video game
he's releasing. We have the cross-country
team. We have an article on the psychological
effects of housing . . . how housing affects
friendships and how people deal with one an
other.
"We also have an interview with Robert
Cohn, professor in the French department,
who is very outspoken on the subject of the
humanities at Stanford," said Love. "Recent
ly there was a survey published by the Na
tional Academy of sciences that ranked only
two of nine humanities departments in the
top 10. Robert Cohn is someone who's ad
dressed that issue for a long time and we gave
him the chance to say 'I told you so — now
let's do something about it!' "
The "piece de resistance" according to
Love is an interview with "Dr. William
Shocklev, whose ideas of racial genetic ine
quality and whose studies on IQ ... are rath
er controversial."
Apart from "about $450" in funding from
the Pub Board, Weiss says that the money for
ads," because the magazine will be dis
tributed free.
"Up until Wednesday the magazine was
not coming out because we did not have the

money," said Weiss. "Paul Khavari (as
sociate editor) and I spent from 12:30 to 7 on
Wednesday ... getting rejected and getting
ads ... we got 5620."
"The most important thing about the mag
azine was the tremendous amount we
learned," said Khavari. He added that al
though things looked uncertain at the start,
"the staff really gelled," especially drawing
from among the residents of Lagunita Court,
where both he and Weiss are RAs.
"I think the magazine is a good example of
showing how you can do something against
all odds," said Weiss. "There were two major
times when people told us we couldn't do it:
the night we needed the ads .j,\ and when
Eleanor Meltzer (now production manager)
told us we couldn't put a magazine together in
one weekend and have it look professional."
Although Love is the only one with ex
tensive journalistic experience, all remain op
timistic as to the magazine's potential suc
cess.

two of nine humanities departments in the
top 10. Robert Cohn is someone who's ad
dressed that issue for a long time and we gave
him the chance to say 'I told you so — now
let's do something about it!' "
The "piece de resistance" according to
Love is an interview with "Dr. William
Shocklev, whose ideas of racial genetic ine
quality and whose studies on IQ ... are rath
er controversial."
Apart from "about $450" in funding from
the Pub Board, Weiss says that the money for
ads," because the magazine will be dis
tributed free.
"Up until Wednesday the magazine was
not coming out because we did not have the

money," said Weiss. "Paul Khavari (as
sociate editor) and I spent from 12:30 to 7 on
Wednesday ... getting rejected and getting
ads ... we got 5620."
"The most important thing about the mag
azine was the tremendous amount we
learned," said Khavari. He added that al
though things looked uncertain at the start,
"the staff really gelled," especially drawing
from among the residents of Lagunita Court,
where both he and Weiss are RAs.
"I think the magazine is a good example of
showing how you can do something against
all odds," said Weiss. "There were two major
times when people told us we couldn't do it:
the night we needed the ads .j,\ and when
Eleanor Meltzer (now production manager)
told us we couldn't put a magazine together in
one weekend and have it look professional."
Although Love is the only one with ex
tensive journalistic experience, all remain op
timistic as to the magazine's potential suc
cess.

Those who noticed lights in the Publica
tions Board room at wee hours this past
weekend were witnesses to the genesis of the
University's newest student-produced maga
zine: Stanford Interview.
The magazine, which is scheduled to be out
bv this Thursday, is the brainchild of seniors
Michael Weiss and Brett Love.
"We wanted to do something that had not
been done in our four years here," explained
Weiss. "We first thought about making a
movie about students here, but we decided
that was not feasible this quarter."
When asked why he expects Stanford In
terview to be different than other magazines
on campus, Weiss replied,"We're going to
make it very easy to read; it's going to com
pletely pleasurable."
"We wanted to produce something that
would actually get read, that would appeal to
the whole community," said Love. "We tried
to come up with a formula that would do that.
Certain other magazines just appeal to a cer
tain type of group, and that's why they're not
well-circulated. That's why we hit on the in
terview format."
"The original idea was Andy Warhol's In
terview magazine. We also wanted to do
things that did well on this campus," Love
continued, adding that he had noticed that
the only magazine that "really did well in the
last few years was Inside Stanford when they
did the Sex at Stanford story."
Stanford Interview will contain a "com
parative sex survey with Eastern schools —
Harvard and Yale — and Western Schools —
Berkeley, USC and Stanford," said Love. In
it, he said that "we try to come to some con
clusions about whether there are differences
between East and West, between North and
South." In keeping with the format of the
magazine, interviews with a "fraternity presi

dent at Berkeley and a former president of the
Panhellenic Council at USC" are also fea
tured in the article.
Weiss said that the first issue contains in
terviews with people that, "are different in
that they combine qualities that most people
only have one of. Ceci Hopp: she's number
one runner in the country and she's also ex
tremely prettv. Mike Heise: he's constantly in
shows, he's an athlete and he's also a poten
tial Rhodes scholar."
Besides Hopp and Heise, Love said, "We
have Mike Boone, who is a computer soft
ware wiz, owns a corporation and talks about
grossing a million dollars with a video game
he's releasing. We have the cross-country
team. We have an article on the psychological
effects of housing . . . how housing affects
friendships and how people deal with one an
other.
"We also have an interview with Robert
Cohn, professor in the French department,
who is very outspoken on the subject of the
humanities at Stanford," said Love. "Recent
ly there was a survey published by the Na
tional Academy of sciences that ranked only
two of nine humanities departments in the
top 10. Robert Cohn is someone who's ad
dressed that issue for a long time and we gave
him the chance to say 'I told you so — now
let's do something about it!' "
