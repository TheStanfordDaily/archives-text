## Bruins roll past Cardinal in arms race 
### SID SPAETH 
Pasadena, Calif. — The Pacif
ic-10 version of the arms race was
unilaterally disarmed long
enough for UCLA to rush for 351
yards Saturday and roll past
Stanford 38-35, eliminating the
Cardinal from the post-season
bowl picture.

Bruin quarterback Jom
Ramsey added 314 yards in the
aerial circus that featured two of
the premier passers in the nation.
UCLA's piercing attack rolled
up 651 yards, pouring through a
Stanford defense that was little
more efficient than a sieve.
Stanford Heisman Trophy

candidate John Elway completed
29-of-39 passes for 352 yards, but
watched helplessly as UCLA's
offensive machine was slowed to
a punt only once.
"There is no question we gave
up a lot of yardage," Stanford
coach Paul Wiggin said. "Wejust
couldn't stop their momentum.

They had the ability to run the
plays they had to. They had a
very good game plan — display
ing a good balance between the
run and the pass."
Bruin tailback Danny An
drews rushed for 148 yards,
sweeping and punching through
gaping holes and past would-be

tacklers. Kevin Nelson, brother
of former Stanford great Darrin,
rushed for 90 yards on 13 carries.
Wide receivers Jojo Townsell
and Cormac Carney had six re
ceptions each for a combined 202
yards and two touchdowns.
"We were just trying to keep
the defense off-balance,"
Ramsey said. "We'll take yards
any way we can get them. They
(UCLA's offensive line) pro
tected us when we were throwing
and opened some holes when we
were running."
Ramsey orchestrated his
linemen, mixing the run with the
pass, as they opened holes that
were as large as the ones Ramsey
found in the Stanford secondary.
"There were two things that
stood out in this game from a de
fensive standpoint," Wiggin said.
"First was our inability to tackle
cleanly, and second was our in
ability to contain the quarter
back."
Ramsey rolled away from nu
merous would-be sackers and
completed passes for big yardage
against the drawn apart defense
— a trick made famous by
Ramsey's high school nemesis,
Elwav.
Ramsey's key pass came early
in the second half with Stanford
trailing 21-18. On third-and-sev
en from the UCLA 44-yard line,
Ramsey ducked away from one
Stanford rusher and, with nose
guard Terry Jackson tugging on
one leg, dumped the ball to
Frank Bruno in the middle.
Bruno raced to the Stanford 26-
yard line, setting up UCLA's
fourth touchdown and a 10-point
lead.
"He (Bruno) is an outlet on
that particular play," Ramsey
said. "I had seen him earlier, but
had to avoid some rushers."
The big play was the exception
to UCLA's balanced and patient
attack, however.
"When you have three re
ceivers the caliber of Carney,
Townsell and Williams, you have
deep threats offensively," Wiggin
said. "We tried to minimize what
they do best, but their balanced
attack proved to be the dif
ference."
One punt, a missed field goal
and two fumbles were the only
times UCLA drives were stopped
as Stanford tacklers often sat
emptv-armed as Bruins ran by.
Asked why the Cardinal had
such a poor day tackling, Wiggin
said, "I don't know. Honest to
God, if 1 knew I'd look you right
in the eve and tell you, but I have
no goddamned idea."
Stanford's offense, meanwhile,
kept scratching back at the ever
increasing UCLA score.
The Cardinal moved to within
three points after running back
Vincent White took an Elway
pass in the right flat, pulled away
from linebacker Doug West and
glided 11 yards into the end zone.

passes for 137 of UCLA's 651 yards — the second highest total
of the school's history. UCLA led from start to finish to beat
the Cardinal 38-35 Saturday.
Elway, who left the game
earlier for a short time with a stiff
ankle, hit White in the right cor
ner of the end zone for the two
point conversion.
With 3:52 remaining in the
game, Wiggin elected to kick off
deep instead of trying to recover
the ball on an onside kick.
The strategy appeared to pay
off when return man Dokie Wil
liams muffed the kick and could
return it onlv to the 11-yard line.

UCLA quickly roared out of
the hole, maintaining its of
fensive dominance and running
the clock out.
"We had to hope our defense
would go down and hold them,"
Wiggin said. "I don't know if we
had the grounds for that hope,
but you have to believe."
White had 14 receptions for
124 yards, while Emile Harry
caught five passes for 130 yards.
White and Mike Dotterer com

bined for 111 yards rushing from
their halfback spot.
"I'm satisfied (with the of
fense)," said Elway, who became
the first player in NCAA history
to pile up more than 2500 total
offense yards three seasons.
"We're not going to be perfect.
We're not going to score every
time. We did get 35 points on the
board against a defense who we
had a lot of respect for.
"The line did a good job of giv

ing me time to throw," Elway
continued. "When they did get
through, it was early and I could
get away."
Winning the arms race was not
enough against UCLA's com
bined air and ground forces.
"The key to the game was our
offensive line dominating the line
of scrimmage," Ramsey said.
"We beat them physically and
anv time vou do that; .

i down a 47-yard touchdown catch from John Elway in the Card's
: :38-35 loss at UCLA Saturday. Elway said, "Emile always •
! -seems to be able turn on the jets as soon as he sees the ball.'*


GROUND ZERO: UCLA running back Kevin Nelson, younger
brother of former Stanford great and Minnesota Viking Darrin
Nelson, takes a dive after a gain Saturday. Nelson, who has been

hampered by injuries all season, rushed 90 yards as UCLA's po
tent offensive attack stalled only three times in their 38-35 win
that eliminated Stanford from bowl contention.
