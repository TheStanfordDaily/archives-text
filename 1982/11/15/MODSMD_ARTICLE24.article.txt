### STEPHEN STRENG 
The nationally No. 3-
ranked Stanford women's vol
leyball team stunned the
Western Collegiate Athletic
Association, defeating con
ference rivals No. 11 UCLA,
No. 8 Arizona, and No. 7 Ari
zona State in road games Fri
day, Saturday, and Sunday.
The wins improve Stan
ford's record to 10-2 in the
WCAA and 27-8 overall.
The Cardinal remains in
second place behind league
leading San Diego State,
which is 11-2. The Cardinal
can insure themselves at least
a tie for first place in the
WCAA by winning their two
remaining conference games
— at Long Beach State Thurs
day and at USC Friday.
The Cardinal concluded its
amazing weekend by defeat
ing ASU in Tempfc, Ariz, in
three straight games, 15-5,
16-14, and 15-3. The win
avenged an earlier loss to the
Sun Devils during a previous
Stanford weekend marathon
against the same three teams
at Maples Pavilion.

Stanford started off its
streak with a win over UCLA
at Pauley Pavilion in only its
third five-game match of the
season. The Cardinal took the
first game 15-11, lost the close
second game 16-14, and won
the third 15-7. The Bruins
fought back, though, and
handily defeated Stanford
15-4. The Cardinal proved
that turnabout is fair play in
the deciding fifth game and
beat UCLA 15-4.
The next day on its
whirlwind tour of the
Southwest, the Cardinal met
Arizona in Tucson and pro
ceeded to play another five
game match. This time Stan
ford dropped the first game,
15-11, but decisively won the
next two in consecutive 15-3
blowouts. The Wildcats were
able to pull together, winning
the fourth game 15-9, but
were unable to contain the
streaking Cardinal as Stan
ford won the final game 15-6.
The Cardinal now is as
sured of an NCAA playoff
bid, and is in a position possi
bly to claim a first-round bye.
