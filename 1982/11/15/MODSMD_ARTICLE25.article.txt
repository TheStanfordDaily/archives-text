# Ramsey said he beat defense, not Elway

### MARK ZEIGLER 
Puadcaa, — UCLA
quarterback Tom Ramsey
walked back from the shower
following his team's 38-35 vic
tory over the Stanford
Cardinal Saturday. A towel
surrounded his waist. His
brown hair was dripping wet.
Immediately, reporters and
TV crews swarmed his dress
ing area and began firing
questions at the six-foot, 187-
pound senior.
How do you feel about your
performance today? Was it
your best ever? How about
Stanford's defense? To all
these, Ramsey gave routine
response after response, click
ing on a mental tape recorder
with pre-recorded answers.
But as soon as a writer
asked Ramsey to comment of
the much-hyped confronta
tion with former high school
rival and Heisman trophy
candidate John Elway, the
"tape recorder" clicked off.
The mustached Bruin
turned and stared the writer
straight in the face, replacing
his usual soft, carefree voice
with a sterner, even cross
tone.
"It's not a one-on-one con
frontation," he said to the
writer. "It never will be and it
never has been. It's not Tom
Ramsey vs. John Elway. It's
Tom Ramsey against the
Stanford defense."
While the Elway-Ramsey
battle can be mulled over by
statisticians and Heisman
Trophy voters, there was a
clear-cut winner in the
Ramsey-Stanford competi
tion.
If numbers mean anything,
Ramsey completed 19 for 27
passes for 314 yards, two
touchdowns and no intercep
tions. He also scambled for 26
yards, allowing Cardinal de
fenders to sack him but once.
Complementing his aerial
efforts, Ramsey mixed in a
bruising ground attack that
picked up 337 yards in 52 car
ries, a six-yards-plus average
per attempt. The Bruins
amassed 36 first downs (a
UCLA record) and 651 total
yards (20 yards short of the
school record), turning the
ball over twice and punting
once.
It was enough for UCLA
coach Terry Donahue to call
his quarterback's play the best
of his career, one which has
seen school, conference and
national records fall like over
ripe fruit from a tree.
"Tom Ramsey was spec
tacular; that's all I can say
about him," Donahue said.

"It was Tom Ramsey's best
performance of the year — he
ignited our offense and kept
the ball away from Stanford
when we had to."
The man who on the receiv
ing end of six Ramsey passes
Saturday, including his ninth
and tenth TD catches, senior
Jojo Townsell, said Ramsey
played "like he always does —
in spectacular fashion. He's
done the things that have
made us win games all year."

One of those "things" was
Ramsey's scrambling comple
tion to fullback Frank Bruno
in the third quarter, the big
gest play of the game. Facing
a crucial third down and seven
at the UCLA 44-yard line,
Ramsey, with Card nose
guard Terry Jackson wrapped
around his legs, hit Bruno un
der Stanford's secondary for a
33-yard gain that ended at the
Cardinal 26.
"He (Bruno) is an outlet on
that particular play," Ramsey
said. "I had seen him earlier,
but had to avoid some
rushers."
Bruno called the play the
biggest in his career. "That
was just an incredible play by
Tom (Ramsey)," he said. Sev
en plays later, Ramsey lofted
a perfectly timed floater to
Jojo Townsell in the left cor
ner of Stanford's end zone.
Townsell screened cor
nerback Darrell Grissum and
pulled down the touchdown
catch to give the Bruins a
28-18 lead.
"We (Stanford) could just
never stop them or contain
them when we had to," said
Cardinal coach Paul Wiggin.
"We just couldn't stop their
momentum."
Their momentum and Tom
Ramsey, that is.

The man who on the receiv
ing end of six Ramsey passes
Saturday, including his ninth
and tenth TD catches, senior
Jojo Townsell, said Ramsey
played "like he always does —
in spectacular fashion. He's
done the things that have
made us win games all year."

One of those "things" was
Ramsey's scrambling comple
tion to fullback Frank Bruno
in the third quarter, the big
gest play of the game. Facing
a crucial third down and seven
at the UCLA 44-yard line,
Ramsey, with Card nose
guard Terry Jackson wrapped
around his legs, hit Bruno un
der Stanford's secondary for a
33-yard gain that ended at the
Cardinal 26.
"He (Bruno) is an outlet on
that particular play," Ramsey
said. "I had seen him earlier,
but had to avoid some
rushers."
Bruno called the play the
biggest in his career. "That
was just an incredible play by
Tom (Ramsey)," he said. Sev
en plays later, Ramsey lofted
a perfectly timed floater to
Jojo Townsell in the left cor
ner of Stanford's end zone.
Townsell screened cor
nerback Darrell Grissum and
pulled down the touchdown
catch to give the Bruins a
28-18 lead.
"We (Stanford) could just
never stop them or contain
them when we had to," said
Cardinal coach Paul Wiggin.
"We just couldn't stop their
momentum."
Their momentum and Tom
Ramsey, that is.


Tom Ramsey
Puadcaa, — UCLA
quarterback Tom Ramsey
walked back from the shower
following his team's 38-35 vic
tory over the Stanford
Cardinal Saturday. A towel
surrounded his waist. His
brown hair was dripping wet.
Immediately, reporters and
TV crews swarmed his dress
ing area and began firing
questions at the six-foot, 187-
pound senior.
How do you feel about your
performance today? Was it
your best ever? How about
Stanford's defense? To all
these, Ramsey gave routine
response after response, click
ing on a mental tape recorder
with pre-recorded answers.
But as soon as a writer
asked Ramsey to comment of
the much-hyped confronta
tion with former high school
rival and Heisman trophy
candidate John Elway, the
"tape recorder" clicked off.
The mustached Bruin
turned and stared the writer
straight in the face, replacing
his usual soft, carefree voice
with a sterner, even cross
tone.
"It's not a one-on-one con
frontation," he said to the
writer. "It never will be and it
never has been. It's not Tom
Ramsey vs. John Elway. It's
Tom Ramsey against the
Stanford defense."
While the Elway-Ramsey
battle can be mulled over by
statisticians and Heisman
Trophy voters, there was a
clear-cut winner in the
Ramsey-Stanford competi
tion.
If numbers mean anything,
Ramsey completed 19 for 27
passes for 314 yards, two
touchdowns and no intercep
tions. He also scambled for 26
yards, allowing Cardinal de
fenders to sack him but once.
Complementing his aerial
efforts, Ramsey mixed in a
bruising ground attack that
picked up 337 yards in 52 car
ries, a six-yards-plus average
per attempt. The Bruins
amassed 36 first downs (a
UCLA record) and 651 total
yards (20 yards short of the
school record), turning the
ball over twice and punting
once.
It was enough for UCLA
coach Terry Donahue to call
his quarterback's play the best
of his career, one which has
seen school, conference and
national records fall like over
ripe fruit from a tree.
"Tom Ramsey was spec
tacular; that's all I can say
about him," Donahue said.

"It was Tom Ramsey's best
performance of the year — he
ignited our offense and kept
the ball away from Stanford
when we had to."
The man who on the receiv
ing end of six Ramsey passes
Saturday, including his ninth
and tenth TD catches, senior
Jojo Townsell, said Ramsey
played "like he always does —
in spectacular fashion. He's
done the things that have

Ramsey, that is.
