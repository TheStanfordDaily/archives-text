# Bruin back rushes for career high
## Andrews' sweet tooth bites Cardinal 
### ADAM BERNS 
Pasadena, Calif. â€” It was like
taking candy from a babv, mavbe
easier.
The UCLA Bruins ran and
passed through the Stanford de
fense to the tune of 651 yards to
tal offense, with 337 coming on
the ground.
No one found it any sweeter
than UCLA running back Dannv
Andrews.
The sophomore rushed for 148
yards on 21 carries. It marked the
second consecutive game that a
Stanford opponent's running
back has rushed for a career high.
Andrews's performance was also
the best for a Bruin back this sea
son, bettering the old mark by 69
yards.
Andrews squirmed, wiggled
and just plain ran through the
Stanford defense all afternoon.
Mthough his longest run was
only 19 vards, he consistently
picked up chunks of 10-12 yards,
frustrating the Cardinal defense.
Credit should also go to the
UCLA offensive line which dom
inated Stanford's defense all af
ternoon and Andrews is the first
to give the line credit.
"The line deserves a lot of the
credit," Andrews said after the
game. "You can put all of their
names in: (Irv) Eatman, (Blake)
Wingle, (Dan) Dufour, (Chris)
Yelich and (Duval) Love."

When asked about fullback
Krank Bruno who contributed
several key blocks, Andrews en
thusiastically added: "Frank
Bruno does that for me everv
game. He was great."
Andrews' touchdown run
came on UCLA's second
possession. It was tvpical of his
running all day long.
With a second-and-six on the
Stanford seven-yard line, An
drews bolted over right tackle for
the score. "It was just speed,"
Andrews said of the run."I
stretched it out as long as I could
and hit the seam."
The most effective running
play for the Bruins was cutting
back over the tackles on sweeps.
Last week Arizona had success
with the same plav and Andrews
gave his explanation why.
"They are a very pursuant de
fense," he said. "Our strategy
was to stretch it out as long as we
could and then cut back."
Although Andrews was quick
to give the offensive line credit in
opening up holes in the Stanford
defense, Ramsey's effectiveness
passing the ball also aided the
rushing attack. "We started mov
ing the ball when they dropped
their guvs back in pass defense,"
Andrews said.
