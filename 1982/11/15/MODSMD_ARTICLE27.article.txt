Ceci Hopp and Kim
Schnurpfeil paced the Stanford
women's cross country team to a
resounding victory while the men
finished their season with a sev
enth place finish at the Pacif
ic- 10/ District 8 Championships
this weekend in Fresno.
Hopp and Schnurpfeil finished
first and second with times of
16:02 and 16:09 respectively. Pat
tiSue Plumer placed ninth overall
with a time of 16:39, Anne Locke
ran 10th in 16:40, and Regina
Jacobs finished 11th in 16:43.

Hopp broke her own course rec
ord by 28 seconds. Her time was
the fastest in the country this
year; Schnurpfeil's was the sec
ond fastest.
Stanford coach Brooks John
son said he was "extremely
elated." He was a bit disap
pointed that the Cardinal was
still unable to run its seven best
people at the same time.
"These girls run their best
when the stakes are highest,"
Johnson said. "Success or ad
versity doesn't turn their heads."
When asked about Stanford's
prospects at the NCAA Cham

pionships next week in Bloom
ington, Ind., Johnson predicted
that Stanford will finish among
the top two or three.
"The most critical thing is
luck," he said. "We need to keep
everyone healthy. The team that
has five of its top seven running
well has the best chances."
The men finished their season
just about as they had expected.
They had wanted to finish fifth,
but a scanty five points separated
fifth and seventh places in the
race won by Oregon.
Bill Graham finished 25th ov
erall in 30:34, Brian Pettingill was

27th in 30:39, Jim Smith ran 36th
in 30:53, Pat Fox placed 4lst in
31:05 and Charles Alexander was
52nd in 31:27.
"All in all, it was a really good
race," Cardinal men's coach
Mike Tomasello said, "We're
pleased, though our expectations
for this year were not met."
All but one member of the
team ran his personal best time.
"Running those personal best
times proves we're moving for
ward," Tomasello said. "We im
proved quite a bit and we're al
ready looking forward to next
vear."
