# Card thwarts late UCLA surge
## Poloists win league crown 
### CHRIS ADDINGTON 
The Stanford water polo
team wrapped up its third
consecutive conference cham
pionship and its seventh in the
last eight years this weekend
with a 9-8 victory over UCLA
and a 12-7 triumph over
Southern California.
The No. 2-nationally
ranked Cardinal increased its
Pacific-10 record to 5-0 with
one league contest remaining
to clinch the conference title.
UCLA is 3-3 and UC-
Berkeley is 3-2.
The two victories also as
ssured Stanford of a No. 2
seed in the NCAA national
championships in two weeks.
The Cardinal will be ranked
behind undefeated UC-
Irvine.
Stanford led UCLA 9-8
with one minute to play Fri
day. The Cardinal turned the
ball over with 20 seconds left
and UCLA head coach Bob
Horn called time out to re
group his team.
The Bruins put the ball in
play and their first shot re
bounded off the arms of Stan
ford goalkeeper Steve Moyer
into the field of play where

UCLA recovered. Once more
Moyer came to the rescue as a
last second desperation shot
bounced off his head and out
of-play.
"I really don't think the
learn played its best," com
mented Stanford assistant
coach and former All-Ameri
ca Jodv Campbell. "It was re
ally frustrating because we
had the opportunities and we
couldn't put the game out of
reach."
Stanford went ahead 2-1 at
the end of the first period and
from then on neither side
could gain more than a single
goal advantage. UCLA took a
5-4 lead but the Cardinal
scored twice to take a 6-5 lead
at the end of the third quarter.
"We should have beat them
by four or five goals," said
Campbell. "They went to a
bizarre man-down defensive
formation and it really con
fused our play."
UCLA's off-beat for
mation almost won the day as
they held the Cardinal to only
3-of-11 scores in man-up situ
ations.
Stanford was paced by Tom
Lampert, John Tanner and

James Bergeson who collected
two scores each. UCLA's
leading scorer was Scott
Thornton with four goals for
the match.
In Friday's game the
Cardinal outlasted a physical
USC squad for the victory. "It
was a rough game with lots of
activity but everyone was
scoring well," said Campbell.
Another highlight of the
weekend was the play of Stan
ford's junior varsity squad
who finished their season with
a 12-7 defeat of the UCLA
and a perfect 13-0 record for
the year. The Stanford JVs are
unofficially the best junior
squad in the nation and they
responded to this by tossing
coach Campbell into the pool
after their victory.
The Cardinal, sporting a
24-4 overall record, will play
California November 20 at
the recently redesigned Har
mon Pool on the Berkeley
campus. The Golden Bears,
20-7-2, will be fighting for the
victory which would give
them second place in the
Pac-10 and a trip tcv tfie
NCAAs. -
