# Two injured in Alpha Delt nocturnal trek
## 
### HEATHER MILLAR 
Two Alpha Delta Phi members on a
fraternity excursion fell down a ravine
early Friday morning â€” one sustaining
a bruised chest and sprained wrist, the
other a fractured ankle and two cracked
- vertebrae, Dean of Student Affairs Jim
Lyons said yesterday.
Responding an hour after the fall,
paramedics took Alpha Delt active
Scott Walter and pledge Paul Duffy to
Stanford Hospital, witnesses said.
Walter, who sustained the milder in
juries, was expected to be released from
the hospital today. Duffy said he will re
main in the hospital "for at least a
week."

BotK went on what Jim Cadena, as
sistant row director and fraternity
liaison, termed a "pledge education"
excursion into the hills around Skyline
Boulevard last Thursday night.
After climbing around the hills,
drinking some beer, and talking until
early in the morning, the two lost their
balance and fell into a ravine, according
to David Chenevert, the Alpha Delt
house president. It is unclear whether
the two falls occurred in close prox
imity, Chenevert said.
"I was just about to leave, and then
suddenly I'm falling, and then I'm hit
ting the ground," said Walter. "It must

have been about 15 or 20 feet... I just
don't remember." Walter said his
bruised chest aggravated an old
wrestling injury.
Recalled Duffy: "We were climbing
around, had some beers, when about 15
of us decided to climb to the highest
point ... I was just standing there and
then I guess I lost my balance and
started falling. I was hitting things all
the way down and then I just smashed
into the ground. It must have been
about 80 feet." Duffy said he is in a
great deal of pain and under sedation.
Chenevert said similiar expeditions
into the hills were organized about four
times a year and had nothing to do with

any sort of "Hell Week" initiation rit
uals, though the Alpha Delts do hold in
itiation ceremonies. "It's a tradition to
go off into the hills,' he said. "The
house has been going up there for sever
al years. We don't have any hazing or
punishment. We don't do things like
that."
University officials echoed this senti
ment and said they are not investigating
for any suspicious initiation rites or
"hazing."
"I'm sure that this was not part of
hazing .. . knowing this group of
guvs," said Row Director Diana Con
klin.
