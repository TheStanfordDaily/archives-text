scoreless overtimes.

awav in the first extra period
when sophomore striker Casio
Conceicao received a pass and
flicked the ball under Foulk, but
the goal was nullified because of
a pushing penalty prior to the
shot, inciting a reaction from the
crowd of 4300.
"Cal plays a dropback de
fensive type of game" said Talk
ington. "They funneled back and
protected the whole game, forc
ing us to shoot from the outside.
It works for them."
Senior Jeff Jones played the
entire game at goalkeeper for
Stanford in his final collegiate
contest and recorded 12 saves,
highlighted in the middle of the
second half, when with out
stretched arms, Jones tipped a
high-arcing Cal shot-on-goal just
over the post.
It was also the last college ap
pearance for Cardinal seniors
Talkington, Doug Clark, Albert
Jordan, and Steve Moe. Senio*
