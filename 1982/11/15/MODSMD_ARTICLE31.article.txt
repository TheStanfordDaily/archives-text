# Student's condition remains guarded

### 
Junior Scott Whitelaw remains in "guarded"— or critical
but stable — condition in the North Intensive Care Unit of
the Stanford Hospital after contracting a severe case of viral
pneumonia, a hospital spokesman said last night.
"The doctors didn't give us too much hope three days
ago," said father Scotty Whitelaw of his son. "But he seems
to be holding on. The most important thing is to keep him
alive. We just need to get through the next two weeks."
Whitelaw's parents and three sisters have flown out from
Cape Cod, Mass. to be with him.
The student first fell sick two weeks ago and was soon ad
mitted to Stanford Hospital. He has been on a respirator
ever since and the doctors on duty refused to release
Whitelaw's prognosis, repeating that he remained in

"guarded condition."
"Scott has a lot of determination and fire," said Scott
Grinis, president of the Phi Delta Theta fraternity, of which
Whitelaw is a member. "I'm sure that's helping him."
Grinis said the human biology major "has brief periods of
coherence" but was unable to receive any visitors. To over
come this barrier, graduate student Jack Martin has or
ganized a videotaping of friends in White Plaza Tuesday be
tween noon and 4 p.m..
If Whitelaw's condition remains stable, he may be able to
view the videotape later in the week, his father said. "We're
excited about the opportunity. I'm sure it will be a good
tonic... it will be there when his mind and body are ready to
accept it."
