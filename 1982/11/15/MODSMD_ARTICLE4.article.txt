# Kedes family still shaken by Arvidson homicide
## 
### GLEN ALLERHAND Staff writer 
When Shirley Kedes returned home
on the afternoon of Oct. 22, she found a
fire truck, police cars and a crowd of
people near the house. But she con
vinced herself that nothing particularly
bad had happened.
"It was as though no one was mov
ing, so I felt that whatever it was, was
over," Kedes said. But as her son Todd,
who was in the crowd, approached her,
she asked him what happened. "He
didn't answer me. He just started shak
ing his head and he said it was no one in
our family," Kedes said.
Todd Kedes, 16, had returned home
from school about 3 p.m. to find trail of
blood in the front hallway, located on
the second floor. "There was a lot.
There was blood on the tile," he said.
Kedes and his mother spoke with the
txatly last Wednesday W an interview in
their Stanford home. Junior Angela
Arvidson, 20, was stabbed to death
there on Friday, Oct. 22. It was her
fourth day on the job as a part-time
housekeeper for the Kedes family.
At first, Kedes said, he thought
someone had fallen down the stairway
leading to the third floor. "I ran up
stairs and then I came back down. I saw
the blood. I saw it leading to the pit," he
said, referring to a room adjacent to the
hallway and below the level of the
elevated living room.
Arvidson was lying on the pit's built
in red sofa. "I went straight over to her
there and she was still breathing,"
Kedes said. "I must've screamed and
said, *oh, my God,' or something."
He raced into the kitchen and called
the 911 emergency number, not yet re
alizing that Arvidson had been stabbed.
He thought she had fallen on a metal
portion of the vacuum cleaner she had
been using. Kedes then ran outside onto
the second-floor wooden deck.
"I kind of screamed and collapsed,"
he said. He ran back inside after a
minute or two to try to revive her. But
Arvidson had stopped breathing.
"I didn't touch her because I looked
over beforehand and saw her neck was
cut. I only saw one (slice), but it was
enough to make me give up hope,"
Kedes said.
He went outside again, and the police
arrived just seconds later with sirens
blaring. A fire truck accompanied the
cars. Only after the police arrived did

Todd think that Arvidson had been
killed. "Right after I started thinking
that, (the officer) said something about
homicide on his walkie-talkie," Todd
said.
Mrs. Kedes returned home about
4 p.m. She had left between 2 and 2:15
to do some errands with a friend.
Angela was home alone, for an hour at
most. Kedes said people are almost
always coming and going from her
house. She added that it was just a
"weird day" in that no family member
of friend was home between the time
she left and her son returned.
Arvidson apparently died during that
time. She was working as a housekeeper
for the Kedeses, and was scheduled to
work Monday and Friday afternoons.
Kedes said she had called Arvidson
at 12:20, waking her from a nap. When
Arvidson explained that she was tired
from preparing for upcoming
midterms, Kedes told her not to come.
But Arvidson arrived at 1:20, about 50
minute late. Kedes said Arvidson only
got through vacuuming the kitchen
carpet that afternoon.
"She still didn't know her way
around that much, but she knew where
all the doors were," Kedes said. "Some
of my last words to her were 'now the
doors are locked. Make sure you keep
them locked.' "
But no one broke into the house. Po
lice think that the killer was a dc
liveryman, Donald John Amos, 29,
who gained entry when Arvidson
opened the door. Amos surrendered
yesterday to Santa Clara County sher
iffs in San Jose.
The trail of blood in the house sug
gests that Angela was stabbed in the
hallway and carried to the built-in sofa.
Kedes pointed out faint blood stains
that remain on the white molding in the
kitchen, which is adjacent to the
hallway.
Kedes explained she had not been ex
pecting a delivery on Friday. But she
had received a phone solicitation the
previous Monday evening to purchase
garbage liner bags. She placed an order,
and was promised a Tuesday morning
delivery. Kedes said she stayed home
until 2 p.m. Tuesday, but the order nev
er arrived. The soliciting company,
identified by police as Tompkins Pro
motions of Los Altos, never called to
reschedule a delivery.
