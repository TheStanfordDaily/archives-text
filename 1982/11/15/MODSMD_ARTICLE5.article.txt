Walesa returns home after delay
Gdansk, Poland — Solidarity chief Lech Walesa returned to a joyful home
coming yesterday after mysteriously disappearing for more than a day fol
lowing his release from 11 months in martial-law custody.
"In my future conduct, I will be courageous but also prudent and there is
no discussion on it. We must win!" Walesa vowed. He spoke through a
loudspeaker from a window in his apartment after rushing inside past about
500 cheering friends and supporters.
There was no immediate explanation for Walesa's delay in coming home
to his first-floor apartment in this Baltic port city where his wife, seven chil
dren and hundreds of people had maintained a long, anxious vigil.
Walesa was arrested when martial law was imposed Dec. 13 and Solidarity
suspended. The independent union was outlawed by Parliament last month.
Hundreds of other Solidarity leaders and activists also were arrested and al
though many have been freed, some are still imprisoned.
The crowd broke into cheers when the 39-year-old union chief showed up
just before 10:30 p.m. "There is no freedom without Solidarity!" the crowd
cried.
Walesa, still with his bushy mustache and wearing a gray suit, jumped
from a Peugeot and rushed into the building without shaking hands. He was
accompanied by four bodyguards whom witnesses described as government
security agents.
After five minutes and in response to the incessant chants of the crowd,
Walesa came to the window and said, "I will speak very briefly because I
have not used my voice for one year."
"We have to reach an agreement, but not on our knees," he said, echoing
the statement he made in an interview with the government television
network Saturday before he was realeased.
When he asked if the interview had been shown on tele
vision last night, the crowd roared, "No."
USSR, Europe react to sanction lift
The state-run Soviet news agency Tass said yesterday
that U.S. trade sanctions to block construction of the
Siberian pipeline had failed.
This appeared to be the first official reaction to Presi
dent Reagan's decision to lift the sanctions. The Tass dis
patch did not mention Reagan's Saturday announce
ment.
Reagan's announcement Saturday of a U.S.-European
"plan of action" on East-West trade is being portrayed in
Western Europe as no breakthrough, but rather a rein
forcement of previous understandings within the al
liance.
But Britain, Italy, West Germany and France con
tended the sanctions were unfair to them and had cost
West European firms an estimated $11 million in lost
contracts with the Soviets.
While allied officials welcomed the removal of Ameri
can sanctions against the Soviet gas pipeline, British For
eign Minister Francis Pym said yesterday that European
governments had made "no concessions" in return for
what he said had been "a unilateral decision by the Amer
icans." Strategic studies on various aspects of East-West
trade that the allies have agreed to undertake would be
done, Pym said, "without commitments" to impose new
limits.
Other officials said privately that the alliance accord
constituted a promise only to pursue more intensively a
program of review and consultation on trade relations
with the Soviet bloc that Western leaders already hadout
lined at summit meetings last June in Versailles and
Bonn.
Disputes arose after those summits as to just how much
restraint in Soviet-bloc business the allies had endorsed.
The sharpest clash over interpretation occurred between
Washington and Paris, and this conflict appeared still
somewhat unresolved over the weekend in view of
France's declaration that it was not a party to the new
agreement.
At best, the latest accord seems to represent a reaf
firmation by the Western Europeans that trade is at least
an element worth considering in the overall East-West
strategy mix, in the view of observers here.
Soviets apply U.S. tech to military
Washington — The Soviet Union, in what appears to
be a carefully planned program approved by the
Kremlin's top leadership, has used large amounts of sto
len and legally acquired U.S. technology to achieve
"giant strides in military strength," according to a Senate
report released yesterday.
The report by the Senate permanent subcommittee on
investigations was based on a declassified Central In
telligence Agency study and on testimony that disclosed,
among other things, how Soviet agents set up a U.S. com
pany that transferred $10 million worth of sensitive mi
croprocessor manufacturing equipment to the Soviet
Union.
"The U.S. research and development establishment is
viewed by the Soviets as a mother lode ... In fact, they
tap into it so frequently that one must wonder if they re
gard U.S. Rand D as their own national asset," Jack Ver

ona of the Defense Intelligence Agency told the subcom
mittee in May.
Soviet efforts to obtain the technology came at a time
when Yuri Andropov, the new Soviet leader, headed the
KGB, the Soviet security police and intelligence agency.
The Senate report culminates an investigation of more
than two years that was led bv Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.),
now the subcommittee's ranking minority member.
It charges the Commerce Department with slipshod
enforcement of trade controls and calls on the U.S. in
telligence community and law enforcement agencies to be
more aggressive in stemming the flow of microelectronic,
laser, radar and precision manufacturing technology to
the Soviets.
In detailing a pattern of attempted theft, bribery and
other abuses by the Soviets, it appears to buttress the
Reagan administration's campaign for tough restrictions
on trade involving products and processes with a poten
tial military application.
Bush optimistic from Soviet relations
Moscow — Vice President George Bush, arriving here
to attend the funeral of Leonid Brezhnev, told the new
Soviet leadership yesterday that opportunities now exist
to seek "a world of greater harmony, not only between
the two great superpowers, but for all nations."
Secretary of State George Shultz made the same point
when he arrived earlier yesterday, telling American re
porters that President Reagan felt that "particularly right
now" the United States and the Soviet Union have a bet
ter chance to work "for a more constructive relationship
than we have had up to now."
Bush, who interrupted a trip in Africa to head the U.S.
delegation to today's funeral, said when he arrived, "As
we pay our respects to a renowned leader, let us also take
this occasion to give serious thought to the great and
positiveopportunities that are before us all."
After almost two years of mutual recriminations, the
vice president's statement, issued in the name of Presi
dent Reagan, appeared tosymbolize a feeling of expected
changes in the air that pervades the Soviet capital.
It seems clear to observers here that the Soviet Union
has entered a period of change that could mark a turning
point in its foreign and domestic policies.
As if to underscore the generational change at the top
of the Soviet hierarchy, well-informed sources disclosed
yesterday night that the oldest member of the Politburo,
Arvid Peishe, 83, had died, creating yet another vacancy
in the ruling body. The deaths of Brezhnev, Peishe and
Mikhail Suslov and the ouster of Andrei Kirilenko have
reduced from 14 to 10 the number of Politburo members
in the course of this year.
The news of Pelshe's death is being withheld, according
to the sources, in order not to mar the Brezhnev funeral,
an occasion that has brought to Moscow the largest
number of foreign leaders and dignitaries since the coro
nation of Nicholas II in 1894.
The burial in Red Square is expected to be attended by
representatives of more than 100 countries, including the
political leaders of more than 40 nations, at least 19 heads
of state and representatives of three European royal fami
lies.
Vietnam vets attend memorial service
Washington — Under the soaring arches of the Wash
/ ington Cathedral, Vietnam veterans heard prayers yester
day that the reconciliation they seek can lead to an end of

Among the congregants was former Ambassador El
lsworth Bunker, 88, who was America's chief represent
ative in Vietnam when half a million American troops
were there. Bunker left in 1973, six weeks after the de
parture of U.S. forces during a negotiated withdrawal
that ended in a Communist takeover.
While well-dressed Washingtonians prayed alongside
visiting Vietnam veterans in frayed Held jackets at the
cathedral, spontaneous rituals of remembrance took
place at the black granite walls of the Vietnam Veterans
Memorial.
The memorial, built at the insistence of Vietnam veter
ans, was dedicated Saturday following a triumphant vet
erans' parade down Constitution Avenue.
The parade, the veterans said, gave them what they
wanted — a nation's ceremonial gratitude for their sacri
fices no matter how divisive and futile the cause may have
been.
On this blustery Sunday, thousands of people came to
the wall. Veterans from many places returned one last
time before heading for home.
At the base of the walls, bearing 57,939 namesof Amer
icans who did not return from Vietnam, flowers, flags
and burning candles had been placed in tribute to those
who died.
At one place, someone had leaned a large tinted photo
graph against the wall. It showed an unsmiling GI stand
ing outside his pup tent, a dog on a leash at his side.
Leaders of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund,
which raised $7 million to build the monument, partici
pated in the cathedral service.
Jan Scruggs, the former infantryman who conceived
the idea for a memorial to honor all 2.7 million who
served in the war, read a lesson from the Book of Daniel.
Funeral for Begin's wife held today
Jerusalem — With his private grief temporarily block
ing out the responsibilities and cares of office, Israeli
Prime Minister Menachem Begin today buries his wife,"
Aliza, for 43 years his closest confidant.
At Begin's request, the funeral will be closed to all but
family and close personal friends. By a grim coincidence,
the ceremony coincides with a day of national mourning
for the Israeli soldiers killed in the explosion of a south
ern Lebanon military headquarters.
The prime minister broke off a visit to the United
States to return to Israel shortly after he received word in
Los Angeles of his wife's death Saturday. Begin was in his
room at a hotel preparing to address the Council of Jew
ish Federations when the report reached him.
Begin's spokesman, Uri Porat, told reporters aboard
the prime minister's Israeli air force jetliner that Begin
would resume his trip to the United States following a 30-
dav period of mourning. Israel radio reported Porat also
said Begin would continue to lead the country.
Another government official, who asked that he not be
identified, said in Jerusalem that no date had been set for
a resumption of the trip, which had been scheduled to in
clude a meeting with President Reagan on Friday.
For the next seven days, Begin is expected to put aside
his official duties while observing shivah, the Jewish peri
od of mourning.
Israeli officer testifies on massacre
Jerusalem — A senior Israeli army officer, in testimony
that conflicted with Prime Minister Menachem Begin's,

yesterday told a panel probing the Beirut massacre that
Begin contacted his army chief of staff about the matter
hours earlier than the prime minister said he had.
Lt. Col. Zeev Zecharin told the commission of inquiry
into the Sept. 16-18 massacre of Palestinians that Begin
spoke with Lt. Gen. Raphael Eytan at 10:30 a.m. Sept. 18
to seek information related to the massacre, at a time Be
gin said he was in synagogue observing the Rosh
Hashana Jewish holiday.
In testimony earlier this month, Begin said he did not
find out that a massacre took place until that evening,
when he heard the news in a British Broadcasting Corp.
radio broadcast. He said he called Eytan afterward.
Hundreds of Palestinian men, women and children
were killed after Israel's military command, in control of
West Beirut at the time, allowed Lebanese Christian
Phalange militiamen to enter the Sabra and Chatilla refu
gee camps. The Israelis invaded Lebanon on June 6 to
rout the Palestine Liberation Organization.
Begin's government reluctantly established the three
member judicial commission of inquiry after Israelis de
manded an accounting for the army's possible role in the
atrocity. Begin has denied all Israeli responsibility.
Trespassers damage nuclear sub
Hartford, Conn. — An attack by seven peace activists
who said they cut through a fence around the Electric
Boat shipyard in Groton, Conn., and damaged the re
cently launched Trident submarine Georgia with ham
mers and marred it with their blood may prompt renewed
congressional scrutiny of security at the plant.
The predawn break-in at the facility on the Thames
River just north of Long Island Sound came early yester
day, five days after nine other protesters were sentenced
for a similar incident July 5. An investigation into secur
ity after that incident brought admissions from officials
that it needed to be improved.
Groton is the only shipyard in the United States where
the nuclear-powered, missile-firing Tridents are pro
duced.
U.S. Sen. William Cohen (R-Maine), chairman of the
Senate Armed Services' sea power subcommittee said
yesterday that he may reopen hearings on the quality of
security at the shipyard.
Monk discovers new source of insulin
Collegeville A Benedictine monk, working in a
homemade attic laboratory at St. John's University, has
discovered how to stimulate the production of cells that
secrete insulin in adult rats.
The Rev. Cyprian Weaver says his discoveries are
"very preliminary" and have no application to humans
yet.
The 37-year-old science teacher said he increased the
amount of insulin produced by healthy adult rats by lac
ing their drinking water with trypsin inhibitor, a color
less, odorless chemical extracted from raw soybeans.
Today's weather
