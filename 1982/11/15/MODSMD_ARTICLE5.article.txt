Walesa returns home after delay
Gdansk, Poland â€” Solidarity chief Lech Walesa returned to a joyful home
coming yesterday after mysteriously disappearing for more than a day fol
lowing his release from 11 months in martial-law custody.
"In my future conduct, I will be courageous but also prudent and there is
no discussion on it. We must win!" Walesa vowed. He spoke through a
loudspeaker from a window in his apartment after rushing inside past about
500 cheering friends and supporters.
There was no immediate explanation for Walesa's delay in coming home
to his first-floor apartment in this Baltic port city where his wife, seven chil
dren and hundreds of people had maintained a long, anxious vigil.
Walesa was arrested when martial law was imposed Dec. 13 and Solidarity
suspended. The independent union was outlawed by Parliament last month.
Hundreds of other Solidarity leaders and activists also were arrested and al
though many have been freed, some are still imprisoned.
The crowd broke into cheers when the 39-year-old union chief showed up
just before 10:30 p.m. "There is no freedom without Solidarity!" the crowd
cried.
Walesa, still with his bushy mustache and wearing a gray suit, jumped
from a Peugeot and rushed into the building without shaking hands. He was
accompanied by four bodyguards whom witnesses described as government
security agents.
After five minutes and in response to the incessant chants of the crowd,
Walesa came to the window and said, "I will speak very briefly because I
have not used my voice for one year."
"We have to reach an agreement, but not on our knees," he said, echoing
the statement he made in an interview with the government television
network Saturday before he was realeased.
