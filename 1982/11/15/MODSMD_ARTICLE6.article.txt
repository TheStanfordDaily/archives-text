# Funding expected to balance budget
## ASSU requests more aid from University 
### STEVE TROUSDALE Staff writer 
The ASSU, cxpected to post a deficit of almost
$11,000 this year, will probably receive University
funds to meet the shortfall, according to ASSU and
University officials.
The ASSU's position is that "the University is
not providing for expenses that it should be, i.e.,
governance," according to Student Financial
Manager Bob Brodv.
Brodv said the University should help "make up
the difference between what our budget should be
and what we can support." For this year he expects
the University funding to total approximately
$11,000, exclusive of any funding for ASSU Re
cycling or for ASSU services on Lake Lagunita.
COP member Cynthia Mathewson, last year's
student financial manager, attributed the deficit to
the fact that the ASSU endowment "has been de
creasing in real terms when we thought it was keep
ing up with inflation in real terms."
This happened because for the past five or six
years the University has been returning to the
ASSU the yield from the ASSU endowment, rather

than reinvesting it, according to Mathewson. She
said, "... the University has been telling us that
money from Merge Pool B (a University fund pool
that contains the ASSU endowment) has been in
creasing at the rate of inflation, and then giving us
money from the top."
Margaret Ann Fidler, assistant dean of student
affairs, said the mixup wasdue to an accident in the
University business office, but said the error had
not created a financial problem for the ASSU until
budget year 1981-82. Even then, she said, the prob
lem was not serious.
Mathewson said the ASSU has been negotiating
University funding of the basic costs of gov
ernance. The University already pays for the Stu
dent Organizations Fund, the ASSU banking ser
vice which holds the accounts of many student
groups. Mathewson said the University and the
ASSU are talking about "what we can determine
as the basic costs of governance."
Fidler also said the ASSU and the University
were looking into possible solutions for this budg
etary problem, despite the cutbacks which are oc
curring in the University's budget. "We in Student
Affairs and everyone else in the University have

been asked to look for cuts," she said, "but I'd be
surprised to see cuts in the ASSU budget."
She described several ways in which the the
Dean of Student Affairs (DOSA) Office could fund
part of the ASSU budget. One way would be to ask
the University for more money. "The University is
going to have some money it is going to put into
new things," she said.
DOSA could also reallocate money within its
own budget. Either way, Fidler said, "once we
come to agreement on financial aid we'd try to
make it possible (to provide it)."
She added that the University might ask the
ASSU to voluntarily spend less than the amount al
located in its budget for certain items. "I would not
be suprised to sec this (underspending)," she said.
The $11,000 general deficit is not the only one
facing the ASSU. In addition to this shortfall is in
its general operating expenses, the ASSU faces def
icits in its recycling program and in the services it
provides on Lake Lagunita.
The ASSU is currently searching for outside fun
ding for ASSU Recycling (see related story this
page), which faces a deficit of. Fidler said the lake
services, which include the boathouse and life-
guards, face a worst-case deficit of
$14,000. For this shortfall the ASSU
will need short-term funding, but she
could not say where this money would
come from. „
This is so, she said, because DOSA
has only a $15,000 reserve which was set
up to cover the ASSU in situations like
that which it presently faces. This is not
enough money to cover both the operat
ing deficit and the shortfall in its lake
programs.
Greg Ray, chairman of the ASSU Fi
nance Committee, said that to combat
future deficits there may be changes
made in the way the ASSU budget is

structured. The budget may be broken
down into two sections — one contain
ing service functions, such as Sunday
Flicks, which the University would not
fund, and the other encompassing gov
ernance items, which he said that the
University might fund.
Fidler said the University did fund
governance costs for the ASSU
1976, when both the ASSU and the
University agreed that the ASSU would
pay for these costs.
Within recent years the ASSU budget
has grown tremendously. It has in
creased by 85 percent since 1980-81 and
nearly tripled since 1978-79, according
to Fidler. The 1982-83 ASSU budget is
about $100,000.
Dean of Student Affairs James Lyons
said, "for the past few years they (the

ASSU) have added to their programs
without examining the costs." He
added that this did not rule out the use
of University funds to subsidize the
ASSU budget.
Lyons said that even in an era of gen
eral University budget-cutting funding
must be flexible enough to meet dif
ferent demands, and that since the
ASSU does have a need for money its
demands will be considered.
As if deficits weren't enough, the Fi
nance Committee has faced internal
problems too. A bill on recycling that
was reported unanimously to the Sen
ate from the finance committee did not
pass, in part because some members of
the committee voted against the bill.
While this can partly be attributed to
the fact that the bill was amended on the

Senate floor, certain members of the fi
nance committee voted for a bill that set
an earlier shutdown date for recycling
than had been proposed in the original
finance committee bill.
Paul Barber, a finance committee
member who voted against the bill, said
that he did so because "to have a dead
line after Dec. 10 would serve no
purpose." He said this date was the
latest the ASSU could submit a pro
posal for Univerrity funding.
Larry Ausubel, one of the finance
committee members who ™t e d for the
original deadline, left that Senate meet
ing early. "If I did it was because I felt
disgusted." he said. "I don't taink the
Senate has been doing enough to save
recycling."
