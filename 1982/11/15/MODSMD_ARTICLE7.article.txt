## Power play: Soviets change leaders, keep game plan New leader named Transition period smooth 
### 
Compiled from news reports and wire services
The swift and efficient appointment of Yuri An
dropov as general secretary of the Soviet Com
munist Party has added credibility to Soviet leaders'
official proclamation of seeking continuity in Sovi
et domestic and foreign policies.
Andropov's rise to leader of the Communist Par
tv came as a surprise to few. Through his position as
KGB chief over the last 15 years, Andropov has de
veloped a reputation as man intolerant of corrup
tion and has long been deemed devoted to the poli
cies of former general secretary Leonid Brezhnev.
Although Soviets expressed pride in the orderly
transition, it is of some import to note that the bat
tle for succession began long before Brezhnev's
death. Andropov's advantage came last January
with the death of Mikhail Suslov, the party ideol
ogue and kingmaker. An extended and brutal polit
ical struggle then began. It was not so much that the
Kremlin had acquired smooth transition tech
niques as that the duration of Brezhnev's decline of
fered Andropov time to garner support in his suc
cession struggle before the former party leader suc
cumbed to ill health.
A promotion for Andropov last spring strength
ened his hand in executing day-to-day domestic pol
icy and quite possibly enabled him to edge out his
prime opponent, Konstantin Chernenko, a long
time Brezhnev aide.
Unlike previous leaders, Andropov takes over
the leading party position with considerable power

and authority. In an aging and shrunken Politburo,
he seems to have the support of the members who
wield real, independent power — Defense Minister
Dmitri Ustinov, Foreign Minister Andrei
Gromyko and Vladimir Shcher-Bitskygn, the
Ukrainian party leadeF. There are three vacancies
on the Politburo, enough for the new party leader to
pack the body with his own men.
The tall, bespectacled Andropov is considered
urbane and well-informed. At 68, the former am
bassador to Hungary may be younger and shrewder
than his predecessor, but Andropov is expected to
adhere to the Soviet line.
On international affairs, Andropov is not ex
pected to veer from current policies which include
keeping allies in subjugation, propagating detente
and peace, maintaining a big military machine and
pursuing an opening toward China and a hard line
with Washington.
In harmony with recent tough speeches by
Brezhnev, Andropov said after his election that
peace "can only be defended by relying on the invin
cible might of the Soviet armed forces." Though he
did not mention specifically detente or disarma
ment Andropov reassured colleagues of continuity
when he stressed a need for a "collective leader
ship."
Although it seems Andropov has inherited a
stable framework from which to lead, the suc
cession struggle over the transition to a younger
generation is yet to be accomplished.
