# No change expected; Soviet move awaited

Despite the Soviet leadership change that followed Leonid
Brezhnev's death Wednesday the Reagan administration is not op
timistic about improved relations with the communist nation.
In a news conference Thursday night, President Reagan said he did
not foresee new opportunities for peace. The president indicated the
United States has done its share in trying to improve the strained East-
West relations and is now waiting for "some action, not just words"
from the Soviets.
Though some advisers had urged Reagan to attend the former gen
eral secretary's funeral himself and to use this time of transition in the
Soviet Union to ease international tensions the president ignored their
advice saying his presence was not necessary. "I believe that we can
continue that search for peace without my attendance at the services."
Throughout his address Reagan declined to strike a conciliatory
note toward the Soviets, choosing instead to blame the Soviets for any
antagonism between the two nations. "We are prepared and ready,
and they know that, about trying to have a better relation," he said.
"We need some action that they — it takes two to tango — that they
want to tango also." Reagan said he "took the first step" last year
when he lifted the grain embargo.
But in an action said delayed by Brezhnev's death, the president
lifted sanctions on equipment for the Soviet natural gas pipeline Sat
urday. The sanctions had been leveled earlier this year in response to
Poland's imposing martial law.
Fundamentally, the administration view is that Yuri Andropov's
succession as general secretary will bring no quick, dramatic changes
in Soviet policies and that only as the new Soviet leaders face the com
petitive economic squeeze of the arms race and consider the cost of
trying to match the $ 1.5 trillion, five-year U.S. military buildup will
they be willing to make concessions in arms talks.
The Soviet leader served as ambassador to Hungary and watched as
Soviet tanks crushed the 1956 uprising. Some experts predicted at
tempts by Andropov to repeat his successes in Hungary in decentraliz
ing the economy and giving farmers and workers incentives to increase
production.
Kremlin-watchers citing Andropov's background raised some con
cern that relations under his leadership may actually worsen. An
dropov spent most of the past 15 years in control of what many regard
as the world's most powerful secret police. In that capacity he is ex
pected to have played critical roles in the invasions of Czechoslovakia
and Afghanistan, in the seeming crushing of the Solidarity movement
in Poland and in the fragmentation of the domestic dissident move
ment.
