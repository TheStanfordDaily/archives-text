# World leaders predict deadlock

Initial world uneasiness
over the death of Soviet leader
Leonid Brezhnev is subsiding
into more of a wait-and-see
attitude among European
countries and China.
With the relatively quick
selection of former KGB
Chief Yuri Andropov, the So
viet transition looks like it will
be smooth. But West Europe
an diplomats and political
leaders last week predicted a
lengthy period of diplomatic
immobility and deadlock in
East-West relations.
Former Secretary of State
Henry Kissinger, who is on a
private visit to Paris, said last
week, "The Soviets may want
a breathing space 112 from in
ternational adventures. We
(the West) may face a peace
offensive to get international
tensions out of the way."
This does not mean, how
ever, that tensions will in
crease; rather, that little is
likely to happen while the
Kremlin sorts out its new
leadership. In this sense, other

nations will also have some
breathing space.
While West Germany's new
center-right coalition ex
pressed its sympathy over
Brezhnev's death, officials in
terviewed in Bonn saw it as a
political bonus that would
suit Chancellor Helmut
Kohl's government while it
deals with its own problems of
transition. In the long run, the
cautiously optimistic Europe
ans predict that East-West re
lations will improve.
No one expects anv over
night change in government
policy in Poland, East Germa
ny, Czechoslovakia, Roma
nia, Hungary and Bulgaria.
How much leeway, if any, the
governments of those coun
tries will be granted under the
new leadership in Moscow,
and whether thev will be in
terested in using it, will proba
bly not become clear for.some
time.
Yet Brezhnev's death
comes at a time of political
and economic crisis in the
Eastern bloc, and important
policy decions may be forced
on the leaders of these coun

tries before they would like to
make them.
A Polish writer said, "Ev
erything depends on who gets
the mantle and what that per
son's opinion of detente is,
but I am almost sure that
eventually it will mean liber
alization for Poland. The man
who succeeds Brezhnev will
be economically forced to as
sume a more liberal line if the
world is not to blow up im
mediately."
The situation is critical in
Poland, where the govern
ment has just decided to lift
martial law and to release Sol
idarity leader Lech Walesa.
As long as public protest
against the regime continues
to diminish, the authorities
will go ahead with their plan.
Meanwhile, Brezhnev's
death was marked by official
eulogies praising him as a man
of pdace and "a great friend of
Poland who understood our
problems."
Comments in the streets
bordered on glee in some
cases. Overhearing a journal
ist asking a young woman for
her reaction to the news, an

old man rushed over and vol
unteered, "We're all happy
that another dog has died."
From China the reaction
was cool and subdued. Peking
had no immediate official
comment on the death, and
the formal message of con
dolence was studiously non
committal, as if the Chinese
Politburo were still mulling
how to approach relations
with the Kremlin during a
transition of power.
Border conflicts and ideol
ogical differences were only
beginning to be breached by
the first round of Sino-Soviet
talks, the last major initiative
of Brezhnev's career.
The" first "consultations"
aimed at normalization got
under way two months before
his passing, and it is not
known how much farther the
talks will get.
If it is correct, however,
that Brezhnev spoke for a col
lective apparatus, then
Western analysts foresee no
major change of direction for
those who succeed him, be
cause they would have been in
on the decision-making.
