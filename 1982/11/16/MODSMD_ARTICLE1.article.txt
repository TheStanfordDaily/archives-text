# Few grads opposed
## DoD funds Comp Sci 
### JULIE KAUFMANN Staff writer 
A small group of graduate students
and professors who oppose the heavy
military sponsorship of computer sci
ence research here know they are in the
minority.
Yesterday, History Prof. Barton
Bernstein reminded them. "You are
concerned about something that most
people in the University don't care
about," Bernstein told the group at
their noon meeting. And, with the cur
rent shortage of non-military funding,
"vou are the spearheads of your own
destruction."
The Department of Defense (DoD)
pays for about two-thirds of Stanford's
computer science research. Currently
the DoD has $7.8 million invested in the
department, in ongoing projects study
ing such things as tutoring systems,
artificial intelligence and large-scale sci
entific computing.
This year, other sources of research
funding have declined but, compared to
last year's figures, the DoD spends 13
percent more money nationwide on re
search with some military applications.
To third-year doctoral student Jerry
Plotnick, these figures represent in
tellectually dishonest behavior. "The
University has pandered to DoD in or
der to grow, to take advantage of gov
ernment sponsorship," Plotnick told
the Daily. "I think people are blinded to
the dangers of militarism .. .(Stanford)
is pandering to forces that might even
tually harm it."
Plotnick, who founded the weekly
discussion group last spring, won't
work for the military. This strong
stance has been an inconvenience, but
thanks to an understanding Ph.D. ad
visor, Plotnick said he hasn't had to
compromise.
Computer Science Prof. Jeffrey Ull
man's database work is funded by the
National ScienceTroundaton (NSF) as
well as the Air Force, and Plotnick
works on the NSF portion. "To me, not
taking DoD funds has a certain symbol
ic importance," Plotnick explained.
For most graduate students, "the ques
tion of where your funding is coming
j'torfi doesn't seem to come into the pic
ture. "

This is one thing the 35-member
group would like to change, explained
Peter Hocschild, a third-year computer
science Ph.D. student. Arriving stu
dents "find a lot of pressure to join a re
search group fairly quickly," Hocschild
said. The DoD funds the bulk of these
research groups.
I he professors directing the groups
don't talk about who is footing the bill,
he said, and "unless you're fairly sus
picious yourself, you're not likely to
ask."
Because Hocschild receives an NSF
fellowship, he, too, has been able to
avoid DoD projects. "I don't get as
much money on the (fellowship) deal,
but I can survive without the extra mon
ey."
The group's only Lculty members
are Computer Science Prof. Terry
Winogradand Mechanical Engineering
Prof. Bernard Roth. Neither accepts
DoD money, and Winograd readily ad
mits that the department would change
radically if others followed suit.
"Things that are being done now
couldn't be done without (DoD
funds)," he said.
Bernstein detailed the history of gov
ernment-funded research for about 20
group members yesterday. The rela
tionship was "forged in World War II,"
he said, when many students went off to
fight and left the schools "looking for
something else to do" for patriotism as
well as scholarship. These efforts led to
the development of radar and the atom
bomb.
The small, early contributions of the
Office ot Naval Research and the NSF
multiplied, but until the 19605, no one
objected to the government's presence
on campus, Bernstein said.
In the 19605, classified military re
search and work for the Central In
telligence Agency (CIA) aroused stu
dent and faculty protest. Stanford
barred classified projects but defeated a
proposal to halt CIA activity here, he
continued.
In the end, however, "nothing
changed. The (Vietnam) War slowly
ran down and the issues seeped away,"
he said. Today, in the short-term out
look, "funding is either going to come
from DoD or it's not going to come."

Because Hocschild receives an NSF
fellowship, he, too, has been able to
avoid DoD projects. "I don't get as
much money on the (fellowship) deal,
but I can survive without the extra mon
ey."
The group's only Lculty members
are Computer Science Prof. Terry
Winogradand Mechanical Engineering
Prof. Bernard Roth. Neither accepts
DoD money, and Winograd readily ad
mits that the department would change
radically if others followed suit.
"Things that are being done now
couldn't be done without (DoD
funds)," he said.
Bernstein detailed the history of gov
ernment-funded research for about 20
group members yesterday. The rela
tionship was "forged in World War II,"
he said, when many students went off to
fight and left the schools "looking for
something else to do" for patriotism as
well as scholarship. These efforts led to
the development of radar and the atom
bomb.
The small, early contributions of the
Office ot Naval Research and the NSF
multiplied, but until the 19605, no one
objected to the government's presence
on campus, Bernstein said.
In the 19605, classified military re
search and work for the Central In
telligence Agency (CIA) aroused stu
dent and faculty protest. Stanford
barred classified projects but defeated a
proposal to halt CIA activity here, he
continued.
In the end, however, "nothing
changed. The (Vietnam) War slowly
ran down and the issues seeped away,"
he said. Today, in the short-term out
look, "funding is either going to come
from DoD or it's not going to come."
A small group of graduate students
and professors who oppose the heavy
military sponsorship of computer sci
ence research here know they are in the
minority.
Yesterday, History Prof. Barton
Bernstein reminded them. "You are
concerned about something that most
people in the University don't care
about," Bernstein told the group at
their noon meeting. And, with the cur
rent shortage of non-military funding,
"vou are the spearheads of your own
destruction."
The Department of Defense (DoD)
pays for about two-thirds of Stanford's
computer science research. Currently
the DoD has $7.8 million invested in the
department, in ongoing projects study
ing such things as tutoring systems,
artificial intelligence and large-scale sci
entific computing.
This year, other sources of research
funding have declined but, compared to
last year's figures, the DoD spends 13
percent more money nationwide on re
search with some military applications.
To third-year doctoral student Jerry
Plotnick, these figures represent in
tellectually dishonest behavior. "The
University has pandered to DoD in or
der to grow, to take advantage of gov
ernment sponsorship," Plotnick told
the Daily. "I think people are blinded to
the dangers of militarism .. .(Stanford)
is pandering to forces that might even
tually harm it."
Plotnick, who founded the weekly
discussion group last spring, won't
work for the military. This strong
stance has been an inconvenience, but
thanks to an understanding Ph.D. ad
visor, Plotnick said he hasn't had to
compromise.
Computer Science Prof. Jeffrey Ull
man's database work is funded by the
National ScienceTroundaton (NSF) as
well as the Air Force, and Plotnick
works on the NSF portion. "To me, not
taking DoD funds has a certain symbol
ic importance," Plotnick explained.
For most graduate students, "the ques
tion of where your funding is coming
j'torfi doesn't seem to come into the pic
ture. "

This is one thing the 35-member
group would like to change, explained
Peter Hocschild, a third-year computer
science Ph.D. student. Arriving stu
dents "find a lot of pressure to join a re
search group fairly quickly," Hocschild
said. The DoD funds the bulk of these
research groups.
I he professors directing the groups
don't talk about who is footing the bill,
he said, and "unless you're fairly sus
picious yourself, you're not likely to
ask."
Because Hocschild receives an NSF
fellowship, he, too, has been able to
avoid DoD projects. "I don't get as
much money on the (fellowship) deal,
but I can survive without the extra mon
ey."
