## The 						Stanford Daily Who will win the jobs bill?

Only the pollsters lost for sure in the midterm
election, but as both parties vie to capture that
elusive creature, the election mandate, party lead
ers are sure to check the latest polls to see where
Americans most want relief: unemployment.
Almost as prevalent as Washington lobbyists
seeking to cash their PAC contributions in for fa
vorable votes, proposals for jobs legislation seem to
be popping up from every federal building large
enough to sport Doric columns. The foremost Re
publican candidate issues from the Transportation
Department, where Drew Lewis has emerged from
obscurity long enough to suggest that a five-cent in
crease in the federal gasoline tax provide the funds
necessary to put 320,000 people to work repairing
the nation's highways and mass transit systems.
The leading Democratic alternative, sponsored
by Rep. Henry Reuss (D-Wis.), is a hodge-podge of
immediate unemployment relief which includes ev
erything from housing start incentives to an attack
on the third vear of President Reagan's tax cut to
repairs of the pipes leading to vour kitchen sink.
This 53.6 billion public works program is supposed
to create 600,000 public service jobs, as well as pro
vide $3.2 billion to subsidize housing starts — and,
it may be assumed, cure the common cold through
an attack on another administration policy.
Both plans attempt to address the chicquest polit
ical issue of the moment: repairing the nation's eco
nomic infrastructure. While the state of American
bridges, sewers and highways is indeed terrible —
and whose repair is vital to economic growth, par
ticularly for poverty-stricken regions — it is being
addressed more as a political gimmick than as a
pressing problem. Who is against repairing the in
frastructure? No one: Atari Democrats and ardent
supplv-siders can dilate to no end about how solv
ing infrastructure problems will cure America's ills,
from unemployment to low productivity to, one
gathers, low voter turnout. Few, however, seem
able to come up with the trillions of dollars neces
sary this decade to make a dent in the problem.
Even so, each partv is more than willing to use the
issue's natural bipartisan support for its own politi
cal purposes. The Republicans hope to defuse

criticism of their callousness toward the un
employed and of Reaganomics' enormous con
tribution to the unemployment rate. The Demo
crats, too, are twisting the moment to their own
ends: their jobs program would attempt to re
suscitate Great Society ideals while attacking the
president's tax program, investment incentives and
foreign policy through the back door of immediate
relief for the unemployed.
It's a bidding war out there, and it's hell. Your
dollars are being used to buy your vote, and both
parties are using battlefield intrigue to raise their
banner over whichever jobs plan clears the houses.
Despite the political crassness so obvious in both
plans, a few good things are emerging following the
ballot counts. The most important is that the lame
duck session starting Nov. 29 promises an end to
the pre-election spate of timidness in a naturally
timid Congress; constructive legislation addressing
crucial issues is at least possible. A gasoline tax, de
spite its slightly regressive character, is also a good
idea: money paid bv those who use the nation's
highways will rebuild those parts now in disrepair
— as well as contribute much-needed funds to the
nation's mass transit systems.
The Democrats, on the other hand, have the right
idea when they look at the military budget as the
logical source of funds for both jobs and infrastruc
ture repair. Reagan has convinced few people of the
necessity of the current arms buildup and has re
sorted to Commie-baiting — whether toward the
freeze movement or toward opponents of his Cen
tral American policies — to draw attention from his
foreign policy failures and the cost of his weapons
programs.
While it would be too much to expect party lead
ers to concentrate upon issues rather than one-up
smanship, we hope that neither lets this consensus
— another beast unsuccessfully tracked for years
by seasoned trail guides during the Carter adminis
tration — escape. A jobs program — tied, in the
best case, to a go at infrastructure problems and
funding for important programs through higher
taxes and reductions in the military budget — is
needed badly and would be fine work for any con
gressional session.
