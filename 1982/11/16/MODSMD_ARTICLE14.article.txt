# Hospital's heartening news
## 
### 
It is often easy to overlook the significance of
events happening close by. An example, for many
of us at least, has been the spate of successful heart
lung transplants carried out at Stanford Hospital
beginning in March 1981. Since then, doctors at the
hospital, currently led by Stuart Jamieson, director
of the heart-lung program, have conducted nine
heart-lung transplants; many of the patients have
returned to active, healthy lives. Still, we remained
for the most part unimpressed and wondered, as
journalists, when the event would lose the news
worthiness that made some news organizations
cluster around the hospital whenever another
heart-lung transplant was announced.
That reaction, we realize now, was more than a
bit premature. As long as Stanford continues to be
the only location in the world where heart-lung
transplants are being performed, each transplant at
Stanford is cause for such attention. Last week,
when Jamieson performed two transplants within a
period of four days, our attention was redoubled.
Both operations seem to have been successful: two
men, one aged 40, the other 22, have new hearts and
lungs and, with them, chances for survival in
numerably better than before their operations. It is
cause for celebration.
Beyond the celebration comes reflection. Of

Jamieson and the program's other doctors, we are
in awe: the ability to take a chronically ill man an<#
bestow upon him the potential for a healthy, even
active life, is a wonderful and miraculous thing. To
last week's patients and all the others, we wish
speedy recoveries and good health. To the heart
lung program in general, we wish continued growth
and expansion; for while we are chauvinistically
proud of Stanford's success, we realize that only
through geographical expansion of the ability to
conduct such operations will the most people bene
fit.
Expansion, however, requires more than the
transfer of knowledge. It requires public concern
manifested in the willingness to be an organ donor.
At Stanford today, doctors remind us, patients are
waiting for heart-lung donors; some have died in
past weeks because no donors come forth. We need
to be aware that, even after death, we can help oth
ers live. In California, and in most other states, you
can offer an organ donation upon death simply by
filling out a form and affixing it to the back of your
driver's license. It's easy to put off. But it's just as
easy to do. And the moment that it takes to sign the
form could mean a gift of long, healthy life for
someone who might otherwise die while waiting for
help.
