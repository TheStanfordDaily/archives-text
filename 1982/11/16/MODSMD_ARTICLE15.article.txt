## ASSU recycling project needs University support 
### 
In the wake of the 1982 elections, Cal
ifornia residents must face their short
sightedness and their lack of concern
for the preservation of our natural re
sources. The Stanford community has
the opportunitv to challenge this at
titude. Within the next couple of weeks,
a University committee will decide
whether or not to help fund the ASSU
recycling project. This program annual
ly saves nearly 1000 tons of recyclable
materials from being hauled away as
"garbage" and dumped into the
bavlands as landfill. Be assured that the
money Stanford does not invest now
toward recvcling will be paid later to
someone hired to find a new dumping
site when we have filled in too much of
the Bay. Whatever is decided, it will be a
reflection of the University's philoso
phy concerning the management of nat
ural resources.
A prestigious university should act as
a vanguard in the community. Theo
retically it is the place where en
lightenment, creativity and experimen
tation are growing and boundless. By
supporting recvcling, the University
can demonstrate the necessity of chang
ing our wasteful habits. We hope the
administration regards the ASSU re
cycling project as an invaluable learn
ing resource for the community as well
as for the students. The Stanford com
munity should be proud, as we are, of
the efforts and success of the student
run recycling program. As our re

sources dwindle, such concern and ded
ication to conservation is admirable.
The University is concerned with the
economic risks involved in supporting
recycling. Surely the University must
realize that recycling is not only a viable
alternative, but it is the easiest and most
reasonable alternative to simple dis
posal.
We all must assume responsibility for
our living, consuming, wasting habits.
Recycling is only a beginning, but it is
easy and practical. A three-minute les
son is all you need to learn the dif
ference between an aluminum, tin or
bimetal can and vou are ready to recy
cle. There is one more detail. Retrain
your mind to ask, "Is this recyclable?"
before throwing anything away. If it is
recyclable, vou need only toss it into the
appropriate green barrel, be it glass, pa
per or aluminum. And be conscien
tious. Anyone who has worked with re
cycling will tell vou it is no fun to reach
into a barrel for a stack of newspapers
and pull out a day-old peanut butter
and jelly sandwich instead. Actively
support recvcling by recycling. It is
practical, easv and rewarding.

The article reporting a student sui
cide attempt (Daily, Nov. 2) correctly
attributed its sources of information.
The Cowell Student Health Center
was also mentioned in the article and
lest there he any confusion, I am writing
to emphasize that the information re
ported did not come from Cowell. We
think it is very important that students
feel free to come to Cowell/CAPS for
any sort of problems, knowing; that
these interactions will be treated con
fidentially.

I am disturbed by the misinformation
contained in the Pass/Fail cartoon
(Daily, Nov. 9) that implied that the
University preferentiallv seeks to admit
gav and Jewish candidates to its under
graduate program in order to fill a mi

nority admissions quota. In fact, Stan
ford doe'sn't practice affirmative action
toward Jewish people and actively prac
tices economic discrimination against
gav students. For example, gay students
with domestic partners are denied mar
ried housing in Escondido Village and
domestic partners of gay students can
not be enrolled as dependents in student
health insurance policies. As for re
ligious favoritism, both the "non
denominational" Memorial Church
and its image on the traditional Stan
ford class ring sport a cross, not a Star
of David.
Finally, the lack of even a single
native American faculty member at
Stanford after well over a decade of
symbolic recruitment in undergraduate
admissions confirms what I suspect was
the message that the cartoonists had in
mind when drawing the cartoon: af
firmative action programs in under
graduate admissions are a half-hearted
exercise in public relations, unaccom
panied bv any serious intent to allow
minorities and women increased repre
sentation in positions of authority. If
you don't believe it, ask award-winning
Prof. Estellc Freedman, who remains
untenured by an institution that be
moans a lack of "qualified" minority
and female candidates for faculty posi
tions.

In the wake of the 1982 elections, Cal
ifornia residents must face their short
sightedness and their lack of concern
for the preservation of our natural re
sources. The Stanford community has
the opportunitv to challenge this at
titude. Within the next couple of weeks,
a University committee will decide
whether or not to help fund the ASSU
recycling project. This program annual
ly saves nearly 1000 tons of recyclable
materials from being hauled away as
"garbage" and dumped into the
bavlands as landfill. Be assured that the
money Stanford does not invest now
toward recvcling will be paid later to
someone hired to find a new dumping
site when we have filled in too much of
the Bay. Whatever is decided, it will be a
reflection of the University's philoso
phy concerning the management of nat
ural resources.
A prestigious university should act as
a vanguard in the community. Theo
retically it is the place where en
lightenment, creativity and experimen
tation are growing and boundless. By
supporting recvcling, the University
can demonstrate the necessity of chang
ing our wasteful habits. We hope the
administration regards the ASSU re
cycling project as an invaluable learn
ing resource for the community as well
as for the students. The Stanford com
munity should be proud, as we are, of
the efforts and success of the student
run recycling program. As our re

sources dwindle, such concern and ded
ication to conservation is admirable.
The University is concerned with the
economic risks involved in supporting
recycling. Surely the University must
realize that recycling is not only a viable
alternative, but it is the easiest and most
reasonable alternative to simple dis
posal.
We all must assume responsibility for
our living, consuming, wasting habits.
Recycling is only a beginning, but it is
easy and practical. A three-minute les
son is all you need to learn the dif
ference between an aluminum, tin or
bimetal can and vou are ready to recy
cle. There is one more detail. Retrain
your mind to ask, "Is this recyclable?"
before throwing anything away. If it is
recyclable, vou need only toss it into the
appropriate green barrel, be it glass, pa
per or aluminum. And be conscien
tious. Anyone who has worked with re
cycling will tell vou it is no fun to reach
into a barrel for a stack of newspapers
and pull out a day-old peanut butter
and jelly sandwich instead. Actively
support recvcling by recycling. It is
practical, easv and rewarding.

The article reporting a student sui
cide attempt (Daily, Nov. 2) correctly
attributed its sources of information.
The Cowell Student Health Center
was also mentioned in the article and
lest there he any confusion, I am writing
to emphasize that the information re
ported did not come from Cowell. We
think it is very important that students
feel free to come to Cowell/CAPS for
any sort of problems, knowing; that
these interactions will be treated con
fidentially.

I am disturbed by the misinformation
contained in the Pass/Fail cartoon
(Daily, Nov. 9) that implied that the
University preferentiallv seeks to admit
gav and Jewish candidates to its under
graduate program in order to fill a mi

nority admissions quota. In fact, Stan
ford doe'sn't practice affirmative action
toward Jewish people and actively prac
tices economic discrimination against
gav students. For example, gay students
with domestic partners are denied mar
ried housing in Escondido Village and
domestic partners of gay students can
not be enrolled as dependents in student
health insurance policies. As for re
ligious favoritism, both the "non
denominational" Memorial Church
and its image on the traditional Stan
ford class ring sport a cross, not a Star
of David.
