## Why do I read the Chronicle? 
### 
Professional journalists have ap
plauded the recent recognition of the
San Francisco Chronicle as America's
best newspaper. At their annual con
vention in Fair Law, New Jersey, the
Society of American Newspaper
Readers awarded their renowned
Walter O. Lemon memorial prize to the
Chronicle for its "outstanding coverage
of national news events of 1981 To a
long-time Chronicle afficionado such as
vours truly, the winner of the 1981
Lemon prize comes as no surprise — in
fact, the award was certainly a few years
overdue.

Their touching article revealed that a rare African
vulture which apparently bears a resemblance to
E. T. had escaped his zoo enclosure and was
winging his way to the nearest phone booth.

The emergence of the Chronicle as the
nation's number one source of news
should only shock those individuals
who missed the Chronicle's coverage of
the following major stories:
"Three-storv Marijuana Plant
Found in Santa Cruz." While the Los
Angeles Times and Bay Area papers
lagged several weeks behind on this
story of international import, the
Chronicle's daring investigators were
on the scene to report the discovery of
the 26-foot tall marijuana tree and
brought back live pictures from the
scene. Joseph Pulitzer himself could not
deny that the Chron's coverage of this
event marked a high point in American
journalism.
"Freeze-Dried Dog Must Stay
Home" — Where were Woodward and
Bernstein when the Chronicle told the
nation that Isabel Burks of Columbus,
Ohio had freeze-dried her canine com
panion, who went by the name of
"Teco," pending the resolution of a
lawsuit against her veterinarian? Burks,
who keeps her freeze-dried friend in a
terrarium in her home, plans to submit
Teco as solid evidence in her malprac
tice suit against Teco's doctor, Dilbagh
Kooner.
"Students Forced to Wear Toilet
Seats" — I'm sure Sy Hersh of The New
York Times would have liked to break
this storv involving West Delaware
High School in Manchester, lowa, but
he was probably too busy writing about
remote world issues. When teachers re
quired students who wished to go to the

bathroom during class hours to wear
toilet seats around their necks, the
Chronicle was on the scene. Incisive in
terviews revealed that students were
"embarrassed" to walk down the halls
with toilet seats around their necks.
And where was Ted Koppel and his
ABC News crew when the Chronicle's
intrepid journalists ventured to Okla
homa City to report: "E.T. Lookalike
Won't Go Home." Their touching arti
cle revealed that a rare African vulture
which apparently bears a resemblance
to E.T. had escaped his zoo enclosure
and was winging his way to the nearest

phone booth.
Critics of America's leading news
paper may argue that stories about
breast-feeding at the polls (in Farm
ington, W.Va.), about the daring theft
of the Chancellor of the Exchequer's
trousers and about the greeting card
that took 51 years to arrive at its desti
nation (in White Plains, N.Y.) should

not compete for newsprint with articles
about the nation's economy or special
envoy Philip Habib's crisis diplomacy.
This is an extremely near-sighted ap
proach to journalistic priorities. When
traditionally boring news events break,
the Chronicle proceeds to reprint what
ever The Associated Press had to say
about the event, thereby freeing its
courageous staff to ask about the kind
of news that people really care about.
The entire front section of the
Chronicle can be digested over a break
fast of two donuts and a tall glass of
Tang. This allows the reader to wander
through the Sporting Green and comics
at his leisure. The crossword puzzle can
then be clipped and easily completed
later in the day.
Other papers may boast about their
expensive foreign bureaus or complex
editorials, but no other leading daily
features white, green and pink sections
in the same issue. When the paper is
"put to bed" each night, San Francis
cans, Palo Altans and Stanfordites can
rest assured that the timely thud of the
Chronicle will reach their doorsteps at
the dawn's first light.
