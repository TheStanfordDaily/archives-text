## Not enough variations on a theme 
### 
By CHRISTINA LEPNIS
The Stanford Dance Division's "In
vitational Dance Concert" performed
last weekend in Roble Studio and, in
presenting works by alumni and Bay
Area choreographers, was a tame and
unstartling event. The program
achieved a few memorable moments
but suffered from a generally uniform
temper.

Mobius Stageworks, a San Jose col
lective, opened the concert with a neo
symbolic group piece excerpted from a
longer work, "Microtheatre for the
Digital Age." Whatever concept the
choreographers wished to express here
got lost as the dancers were exclusively
busied with making shapes and pat
terns. Toward the end, a single dancer
quite unaccountably burst into feverish
movement among her more sedate
companions, showing off more tech
nique tham inspiration. The piece in to
tal had no particular effect, except may
be tedium. The music was provided live
with electric instruments and was high
ly reminiscent of the slow, dated rock
played bv bands at high school dances.
"Portrait, Part I" by Ellen Bromberg
began as a jazzy caricature of a suave,
trenchcoated, briefcase-carrying busi
nessman and gradually descended into
disorientation and despair as he ap
parently recognized the madness and
vacuity of executive liffe. The piece con
cluded with his rejection of the trap
pings that have defined his professional
and ultimately personal self. This all
too familiar picture of modern society
and psychological stress was partially
redeemed by soloist John Henry's
portrayal of the stylish-turned-tor
mented careerist.
John Goodwin's "Sleeping Sonata,"
featuring Diane Freccero and Jancy
Limpert of Stanford's dance faculty,

was a slow, controlled and hypnotic de
piction of two undulating couples en
gaged in a series of in-tandem ma
neuvers. Brian Eno's soothing, steady
music and the radiance of the simple
purple bodysuits enhanced the work's
calm and somnolent effect. (For
tunately, the dancers drifted off to sleep
before I did). However, this exploration
remained more sensual than sensuous
and thus deprived itself of a deeper,
richer potential.
San Jose's Danceworks brought
"Black Box, Floating Pictures," where
we were once again treated to bodysuits
and the electric guitar. As in the open

ing piece, the movement itself could not
sustain a lasting image.
The first instance of pace finally sur
faced in Julienne Weston's "Woven
Oddities," a quick, sharp trio that com
bined a creative use of space and repeti
tion. King Crimson's measured beat
and frictionless sound added to the
sleek zip of the choreography. Best of
all, this piece did not pretend to be more
than it was: a concoction of strides and
pulses glossed with New Wave philoso
phy.
"Martin — Part I," by and with
Martin Kravitz, was a dance of self-rec
ognition and a puzzling preoccupation

with a babv carriage. It was undoubted
ly a "heavy" symbol (the man as infant?
past innocence?) but appeared less use
ful as a stage prop. Kravitz would stare
into it, push it about and move his
trained body in and out of dejection
before ambling offstage, optimistically
munching on an apple (another sym
bol?).
M v favorite pieces were the next two
elegant solos, both performed by the
choreographers themselves. The first,
"Mv Sister, Mv Bride" by Ann

Malmuth-Onn, was an exquisite, folk
loric tribute to woman. The dance
achieved a depth and dignified grace by
Malmuth-Onn's ability to project a per
sonality so compatible with the subtly
stylized tradition of the work. The sec
ond, "Solitaire," bv Leslee Lewis, was
rather more cool and detached but
equally mystical in its Indian and
Eastern flavor and smooth, pensive mo
tion. An atmospheric capsule, it was
one of the few pieces that knew the vir
tue of brevity.

The last work, "Slowly the Voices"
by Regina DeCosse and the Cabrillo
Dance Ensemble, was a ceremonious,
attractive and lulling composition ac
companied bv a sound-track of poetry
and chanting. However, every dance on
the program was invariably meditative
either in an abstrct or (more rarely) in a
narrative fashion. A marked change of
tempo and energy level from piece to
piece was sadlv absent and this hurt the
evening's several more promising offer
ings.

"Portrait, Part I" by Ellen Bromberg
began as a jazzy caricature of a suave,
trenchcoated, briefcase-carrying busi
nessman and gradually descended into
disorientation and despair as he ap
parently recognized the madness and
vacuity of executive liffe. The piece con
cluded with his rejection of the trap
pings that have defined his professional
and ultimately personal self. This all
too familiar picture of modern society
and psychological stress was partially
redeemed by soloist John Henry's
portrayal of the stylish-turned-tor
mented careerist.
John Goodwin's "Sleeping Sonata,"
featuring Diane Freccero and Jancy
Limpert of Stanford's dance faculty,

was a slow, controlled and hypnotic de
piction of two undulating couples en
gaged in a series of in-tandem ma
neuvers. Brian Eno's soothing, steady
music and the radiance of the simple
purple bodysuits enhanced the work's
calm and somnolent effect. (For
tunately, the dancers drifted off to sleep
before I did). However, this exploration
remained more sensual than sensuous
and thus deprived itself of a deeper,
richer potential.
San Jose's Danceworks brought
"Black Box, Floating Pictures," where
we were once again treated to bodysuits
and the electric guitar. As in the open

ing piece, the movement itself could not
sustain a lasting image.
The first instance of pace finally sur
faced in Julienne Weston's "Woven
Oddities," a quick, sharp trio that com
bined a creative use of space and repeti
tion. King Crimson's measured beat
and frictionless sound added to the
sleek zip of the choreography. Best of
all, this piece did not pretend to be more
than it was: a concoction of strides and
pulses glossed with New Wave philoso
phy.
"Martin — Part I," by and with
Martin Kravitz, was a dance of self-rec
ognition and a puzzling preoccupation

with a babv carriage. It was undoubted
ly a "heavy" symbol (the man as infant?
past innocence?) but appeared less use
ful as a stage prop. Kravitz would stare
into it, push it about and move his
trained body in and out of dejection
before ambling offstage, optimistically
munching on an apple (another sym
bol?).
M v favorite pieces were the next two
elegant solos, both performed by the
choreographers themselves. The first,
"Mv Sister, Mv Bride" by Ann

Malmuth-Onn, was an exquisite, folk
loric tribute to woman. The dance
achieved a depth and dignified grace by
Malmuth-Onn's ability to project a per
sonality so compatible with the subtly
stylized tradition of the work. The sec
ond, "Solitaire," bv Leslee Lewis, was
rather more cool and detached but
equally mystical in its Indian and
Eastern flavor and smooth, pensive mo
tion. An atmospheric capsule, it was
one of the few pieces that knew the vir
tue of brevity.

The last work, "Slowly the Voices"
by Regina DeCosse and the Cabrillo
Dance Ensemble, was a ceremonious,
attractive and lulling composition ac
companied bv a sound-track of poetry
and chanting. However, every dance on
the program was invariably meditative
either in an abstrct or (more rarely) in a
narrative fashion. A marked change of
tempo and energy level from piece to
piece was sadlv absent and this hurt the
evening's several more promising offer
ings.


By CHRISTINA LEPNIS
The Stanford Dance Division's "In
vitational Dance Concert" performed
last weekend in Roble Studio and, in
presenting works by alumni and Bay
Area choreographers, was a tame and
unstartling event. The program
achieved a few memorable moments
but suffered from a generally uniform
temper.

Mobius Stageworks, a San Jose col
lective, opened the concert with a neo
symbolic group piece excerpted from a
longer work, "Microtheatre for the
Digital Age." Whatever concept the
choreographers wished to express here
got lost as the dancers were exclusively
busied with making shapes and pat
terns. Toward the end, a single dancer
quite unaccountably burst into feverish
movement among her more sedate
companions, showing off more tech
nique tham inspiration. The piece in to
tal had no particular effect, except may
be tedium. The music was provided live
with electric instruments and was high
ly reminiscent of the slow, dated rock
played bv bands at high school dances.
