# Getting the last word in
## 
### BARRY LURIE 
It's new, exciting and intelligent, and
these are only few of the adjectives that
could describe Supertramp's latest
album, "... famous last words
Unlike the group's best-selling prede
cessor, Breakfast in America, this
phenomenal batch of music has soared
above the commercialism the band
once so desperately needed. Now,
armed with an established reputation,
Supertramp has produced a con
glomeration of songs which fit neatly
and flow perfectly in a form of art sur
passing the genius of even their first
album. Crime of the Century. Quite
clearly, the Supertramp clan has re
turned to its roots, belting out its
message louder and clearer than ever
before: do it, and don't let anyone get in
your way.
Don't get me wrong — the instru
ments and tunes are decidedly Super
tramp's. John Helliwell still blares his
sax on almost every song and Rick
Davies and Roger Hodgson bounce on
their pianoseven better than in Crime of
the Century (Siebenberg's drumming,
however, remains as hopelessly unexcit

ing as ever). But something has
changed, and for the better. It becomes
obvious that the long time between
their last two albums was devoted to
practicing, experimenting with and per
fecting their music, which culminates in
this very serious but important record.
The album starts off loud and grabs
you — after that, there's never a dull
moment. "Crazy" serves as a perfect in
troduction to the rest of the album, im
mediately emphasizing the social pres
sures of being an artist: "Right if you
win, wrong if you lose/Nobody listens
when you're singing the blues." Of
course, the bouncy and quick-paced
song is by no means a blues song and we
know this will be true for the rest of the
songs. After all, no one listens to the
blues, right? Very clever.
The message succeeds. In "Know
Who You are," probably the album's
finest and prettiest song, a moaning and
languishing Rick Davies tells it as it is:
"Sing it out for all to hear/because
you've so much to say/and you've so
much to do." The song is especially in
teresting in that the beat and lyrics con
tradict each other — a lazy, wavy tune

against powerful message. Hodgeson's
guitar work is highly romantic and
moving. But then, Davies suddenly lets
out a daring chain of "la-dee-das" in
the middle. While this would normally
seem a childish effect, the mood already
created lets him get away with it. Fan
tastically engineered, the song runs
smoothly and, well, perfectly.
"My Kind of Lady," a jumpy but
cynical adulterated '40s song about
blind love and its aftereffects,
the album back on track, away from its
moody digression. Hodgson's earlier
Bee-Gee high voice in Breakfast in
America's "The Logical Song" now re
turns, if only to mock a woman saying
trite romantic phrases. The song is a
pleasure.
Never does Helliwell's omnipresent
saxophone blare as powerfully as in
"It's Raining Again," and it catches ev
erybody by surprise. The song, a bit
monotonous at first, soon recuperates
with a sudden change in tune midway
through. The repetition is then excused
as imagery of watching rain fall, and we
realize the switch of tone is also a call to
stop sulking: "C'mon you little fighter/

and get back up again" — very much
the same message as "Dreamer" from
Crime of the Century.

in "C'est le Bon," the album's long
est song, Davies recites his own history
as a struggling artist fighting against all

the odds: "Well there were days I can
tell you quite honestly/ I saw myself

winding up in the monastery." In
the middle, the writer calls on the
artists to do their part — to say
what they have to say, to fight
back, " 'Cause there's a lot of
crazy people/ Who've forgotten
where their heart is." The
message here is crystal clear:
don't let others force you into
doing what you weren't meant to
do. The rosy sweet image that too
many people are "hurting those
flowers and those trees," al-

though simple, is especially effec
tive in that it is a return to think
ing simply and sensibly. How
ever, Davies' French accent, I am
sorry to say, leaves much to be
desired.
A sinister and quick piano and
bereaved sax introduce Super
tramps "Waiting So Long," a
harsh dose of pessimism which
recalls the heights of former
glory. The song is a condemna
tion and mockery of someone liv
ing in the past: "If this world is
unimpressive/ it's been that way
for quite a while." The last words
fade off beautifully, giving way to
creeping and growing acoustic
guitar, which eventually takes
over. It becomes the start of an
eerie, James Bond-type finale —
a guitar and bass duet remi
niscent of (and almost as good as)

Pink Floyd's "Comfortably
Numb."
Although the album's last song
runs on and on with little de
velopment, Davis and Hodgson
can easily excuse it as the proper
conclusion to their masterpiece:
"Don't leave me now/ all alone
in this crazy world" — leaving
the listener in the same mood as
did Crime of the Century.
There is more to Supertramp's
style here: it is an intelligent
cohesion of songs which avoid a
depressing tone by jumping from
a melodramatic song to a more
bouncy and uplifting one, al-

though the messages in all the
songs are serious and they are
meant to be taken seriously. The
album is beautifully performed,
flawlessly engineered and just
plain well-constructed.
Call it taoist, transcendental,
hedonistic or what you will, but
Supertramp's message needs no
labels — know what you are and
what you want to be. The album
is clearly one of suffering, not one
which festers in and rots the pro
lific mind, but rather one which is
surmounted and conquered.
Supertramp says it all per
fectly with their album cover: a
man in the precarious position of
balancing on a tight-rope but
walking steadfast in one direc
tion. Behind him, however, an
unknown hand with scissors
threatens to ruin his act.

fectly with their album cover: a
man in the precarious position of
balancing on a tight-rope but
walking steadfast in one direc
tion. Behind him, however, an
unknown hand with scissors
threatens to ruin his act.

It's new, exciting and intelligent, and
these are only few of the adjectives that
could describe Supertramp's latest
album, "... famous last words
Unlike the group's best-selling prede
cessor, Breakfast in America, this
phenomenal batch of music has soared
above the commercialism the band
once so desperately needed. Now,
armed with an established reputation,
Supertramp has produced a con
glomeration of songs which fit neatly
and flow perfectly in a form of art sur
passing the genius of even their first
album. Crime of the Century. Quite
clearly, the Supertramp clan has re
turned to its roots, belting out its
message louder and clearer than ever
before: do it, and don't let anyone get in
your way.
Don't get me wrong — the instru
ments and tunes are decidedly Super
tramp's. John Helliwell still blares his
sax on almost every song and Rick
Davies and Roger Hodgson bounce on
their pianoseven better than in Crime of
the Century (Siebenberg's drumming,
however, remains as hopelessly unexcit

ing as ever). But something has
changed, and for the better. It becomes
obvious that the long time between
their last two albums was devoted to
practicing, experimenting with and per
fecting their music, which culminates in
this very serious but important record.
The album starts off loud and grabs
you — after that, there's never a dull
moment. "Crazy" serves as a perfect in
troduction to the rest of the album, im
mediately emphasizing the social pres
sures of being an artist: "Right if you
win, wrong if you lose/Nobody listens
when you're singing the blues." Of
course, the bouncy and quick-paced
song is by no means a blues song and we
know this will be true for the rest of the
songs. After all, no one listens to the
blues, right? Very clever.
The message succeeds. In "Know
Who You are," probably the album's
finest and prettiest song, a moaning and
languishing Rick Davies tells it as it is:
"Sing it out for all to hear/because
you've so much to say/and you've so
much to do." The song is especially in
teresting in that the beat and lyrics con
tradict each other — a lazy, wavy tune

against powerful message. Hodgeson's
guitar work is highly romantic and
moving. But then, Davies suddenly lets
out a daring chain of "la-dee-das" in
the middle. While this would normally
seem a childish effect, the mood already
created lets him get away with it. Fan
tastically engineered, the song runs
smoothly and, well, perfectly.
"My Kind of Lady," a jumpy but
cynical adulterated '40s song about
blind love and its aftereffects,
the album back on track, away from its
moody digression. Hodgson's earlier
Bee-Gee high voice in Breakfast in
America's "The Logical Song" now re
turns, if only to mock a woman saying
trite romantic phrases. The song is a
pleasure.
Never does Helliwell's omnipresent
saxophone blare as powerfully as in
"It's Raining Again," and it catches ev
erybody by surprise. The song, a bit
monotonous at first, soon recuperates
with a sudden change in tune midway
through. The repetition is then excused
as imagery of watching rain fall, and we
realize the switch of tone is also a call to
stop sulking: "C'mon you little fighter/

and get back up again" — very much
the same message as "Dreamer" from
Crime of the Century.

in "C'est le Bon," the album's long
est song, Davies recites his own history
as a struggling artist fighting against all

the odds: "Well there were days I can
tell you quite honestly/ I saw myself

winding up in the monastery." In
the middle, the writer calls on the
artists to do their part — to say
what they have to say, to fight
back, " 'Cause there's a lot of
crazy people/ Who've forgotten
where their heart is." The
message here is crystal clear:
don't let others force you into
doing what you weren't meant to
do. The rosy sweet image that too
many people are "hurting those
flowers and those trees," al-

though simple, is especially effec
tive in that it is a return to think
ing simply and sensibly. How
ever, Davies' French accent, I am
sorry to say, leaves much to be
desired.
A sinister and quick piano and
bereaved sax introduce Super
tramps "Waiting So Long," a
harsh dose of pessimism which
recalls the heights of former
glory. The song is a condemna
tion and mockery of someone liv
ing in the past: "If this world is
unimpressive/ it's been that way
for quite a while." The last words
fade off beautifully, giving way to
creeping and growing acoustic
guitar, which eventually takes
over. It becomes the start of an
eerie, James Bond-type finale —
a guitar and bass duet remi
niscent of (and almost as good as)

Pink Floyd's "Comfortably
Numb."
Although the album's last song
runs on and on with little de
velopment, Davis and Hodgson
can easily excuse it as the proper
conclusion to their masterpiece:
"Don't leave me now/ all alone
in this crazy world" — leaving
the listener in the same mood as
did Crime of the Century.
There is more to Supertramp's
style here: it is an intelligent
cohesion of songs which avoid a
depressing tone by jumping from
a melodramatic song to a more
bouncy and uplifting one, al-

though the messages in all the
songs are serious and they are
meant to be taken seriously. The
album is beautifully performed,
flawlessly engineered and just
plain well-constructed.
Call it taoist, transcendental,
hedonistic or what you will, but
Supertramp's message needs no
labels — know what you are and
what you want to be. The album
is clearly one of suffering, not one
which festers in and rots the pro
lific mind, but rather one which is
surmounted and conquered.
