# Springsteen wanders through a dark Nebraska

### DAVID SCHMELZER 
Bruce Springsteen
Nebraska
Columbia Records

Certainly the most striking thing
about Bruce Springsteen's Nebraska is
its daring and, for me, this makes the
album admirable by itself; even if the
songs themselves were complete fail
ures one would want to commend the
effort. By now most music followers
likely know Nebraska's history: Spring
steen was just writing songs for his new
album with the E-Street Band when he
discovered that most of the songs
sounded "right" in his own rough ver
sions of them, which he's recorded by
himself into a four-track recorder in his
home; so he took the tape he had, got
some people to doctor its sound up a
bit. and then released it as it was. What
that left him and his distributors was a
record that was flagrantly anti-com
mercial â€” a dark, mournful album
without the kick of his fine band to
make it catchy.

The effect of his decision is that the
lyrics become such a strong focus of the
album that the music seems secondary,
a striking contrast to the recent light,
but bouncy songs he wrote for Garv
U.S. Bonds. As always his lyrics are
fascinating, but one might wonder
what's gotten him so depressed in the
last few years. Apparently, he was in
fluenced bv a biography of Charles
-Starkweather, one of the "Badlands"
killers who was executed more than a
decade ago. The title song deals directly
with this, but its influence flows over to
each of the songs. Springsteen's vision
has darkened since Born to Run, but the
two intervening albums have had their
hopeful moments: the defiance of "The
Promised Land" and the playfulness of
"Sherry Darling" being two examples
that quickly come to mind. But one is
hard-pressed to find even a hopeful line
in the songs here and the few possi
bilities seem a bit pathetic when
weighed against the overall despair of
the vision.
This is my central difficulty with Ne
braska. As much as one can admire the

storytelling, one has to make a de
termined effort to enjoy the album. Un
doubtedly, the lack of the variety and
spirit the E-Street Band might have giv
en the record contributes to this. With
Nebraska Springsteen has returned to
the early times when CBS records ex
pected him to be the next Bob Dylan,
when they had no idea he could sing
rock music. The songs here are all
mournful; within that class they run
from sleepy to pulsing,which turns out
to be a narrow range bv most standards.
The crying harmonica he used so effec
tively on "The River" returns on this,
but it's so heavy and oppressive in most
instances that it's difficult to see its
beauty. Certain of the livelier songs,
particularly "Open All Night," "John
ny 99" and, perhaps, "Atlantic City"
make one wonder what might have
been had these numbers been turned
over to a full band, but most of the mu
sic is muddy and understated enough to
make it difficult to predict how a band
would have affected it. Much of side
two comes across as a lightly accom
panied, darkly melodic poetry reading.

Again, there's no question that the
message is interesting to consider but,
as can happen when reading a book like
In Cold Blood, looking at this is so grim
as to kill any feeling other than an
aesthetic appreciation and the type of
voyeurism one can feel when studying
abnormal psychology. He certainly
captures the horror of a Charles
Starkweather when he sings in "Ne
braska," "I can't say I'm sorry for the
things that we done/ At least for a little
while sir me and her we had us some
fun" and he seems to try to explain the
blackness of the album in the song's
closing line, suggesting that "there's
just a meanness in this world."
But that meanness is so unremitting
as to make one wonder what events
have made Springsteen so depressed as
to seem almost suicidal. His "Johnny
99" is a former factory worker whose
plant closes down, leaving him (like the
narrator in "Atlantic City") "debts no
honest man could pay." Most of what
he has is being repossessed and one
night he gets drunk and kills a man. Af
ter the judge sentences him to 99 years

he tries to keep some of his demolished
self-respect by asking to be executed.
He and Springsteen seem to be saying
that we're all victims of an increasingly
malevolent society, which breaks down
the distinction between ourselves and
"the bad (or sick) guvs out there" that
we read about. "Now 1 ain't sayin' that
makes me an honest man/ But it was
more'n all this that put that gun in my
hand."
The man in "Atlantic City" still does
think the city's special. He doesn't want
to join the Mob that's tearing it down
but, like Johnny 99, he's "tired of com
in' out on the losin' end." The "High
way Patrolman" doesn't want to chase
down his "bad" brother, but he finally
has no choice. Springsteen writes such
that none of the characters are bad of
themselves; they're so-called normal
people pushed into a corner, looking
desperately to find a non-drastic way
out. When "State Trooper's" suicidal
man pleads. "Mister state trooper
please don't stop me," he's begging for
just the opposite. Like the rest of the

album's characters he's looking
for a way out and, like the others,
he won't find one.
Springsteen plays some games
that connect several of the songs.
Like the desperate man in "State
Trooper," the man in "Open All
Night" asks to be delivered
"from nowhere," but his de
liverance won't come through
death, but through distraction.
This guy's life is as desolate as the

others' we've met; he's just better
able to deal with it. After a dis
pute with his boss, he's consigned
to driving the night shift, keeping
him hours away from his girl.
With this intertwining of
songs, Springsteen, perhaps,
does hint at a bit of his own his
tory. "Mansion on the Hill," the
lone song to end with am image
of beauty, deals with the memo
ries of a man who, as a child, was
awed by beauty. "Used Cars"
deals with an adolescent who is
embittered by what life he has
seen and is ready to break away.

And "My Father's House"
focuses on a man who has broken
away from his father, later realiz
ing how important a reconcil
iation is, only to return and find
his father is gone, leaving the nar
rator's sins to "lie unatoned."
The album's bleakness isn't
tempered by its final song, "Rea
son to Believe," which seems to
be saying that a working man can
find some hope but, to do so, he
has to create it himself from the
darkest of surroundings. A dead
dog, a dead man, a jilted girl and
a jilted groom are among the

sources from which he reasons to
believe spring.
Whether free from artistic con
science or sheer ego, Springsteen
has fashioned an album that,
while darkly beautiful, almost
dares you to find pleasure in it.
There's discovery and there's cer

tainly appreciation but, for me,
mostly what's there is a strong
curiosity about what his next
album with the E-Street Band
will be like, as if Nebraska were
something he had to grow
through in order to find a new
lyrical vision to go with his pre
viously compelling music.
