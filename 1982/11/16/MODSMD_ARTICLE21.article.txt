# An evening with Gilbert and Sullivan
## 
### JAN MIRELES 
Sometimes common
phrases really are true. In the
case of Gilbert and Sullivan's
H.M.S. Pinafore, "our's is not
to reason why" does strike a
resounding chord. The musi
cal, produced by the Stanford
Savoyards, is standard Gil
bert and Sullivan fare. In a
light-hearted two hours
young and not-so-young lov
ers meet, this time aboard the
H.M.S. Pinafore, and profess
undying love only to be sepa
rated by a cruel twist of fate.
By the evening's end however,
all is well as the result of a
highly illogical confession
which brings the lovers to
gether in a "happily forever
after" ending.
But the routine plot and the
lack of logic aren't what mat
ters. What matters is that if
it's Gilbert and Sullivan you
can't go wrong. And the
Savoyards did a pretty good
job as a showcase for the two
masters' music and comedy.
Though the show started on
a slow note that might be at
tributed to opening night jit
ters, the cast managed to pick
up momentum as the per
formance progressed and
seemed to be enjoying itself by
the time the second act rolled
around.
During the opening
number of the show we were
introduced to our hero, sailor
Ralph Rackstraw, as played
bv Mark Daniel. Daniel sings
incredibly well, offering a ro
mantic, crooning style that

could set many hearts aflutter.
Unfortunately Daniel was
probably chosen more for his
voice than his acting ability.
The words he delivered at
times lacked emotional im
pact. Though he obediently
professed his love to the cap
tain's daughter plaved by
Kathleen Young, in an amus
ing repartee, any meaningful
glances between the two that
might have indicated deeper
feelings were lost to the au
dience.
Young as the captain's
dutiful daughter both pleased
and perplexed those present.
Young tripped lightly
through her role as the object
of Rackstraw's attentions and
her lilting soprano com
plemented Daniel's tenor.
However, some of the lyrics
were obscured in her attempts
to reach the higher notes. And
indeed the highest notes
caused some degree of worry
as a number of patrons visibly
flinched as the heroine
strained to expand her range.
A fine supporting cast did
much to round out the other
wise skillful performances of
Daniel and Young. Two de
lights were the characters
brought to life by Richard
Dehmel and Ed Firestone.
From the moment Dehmel
made his First appearance as
the pompous but lovable Cap
tain Corcoran until the clos
ing scene he commanded at
tention whenever he came on
stage. Unafraid to play the
fool, Dehmel slipped into his

character with ease and ex
hibited a flare for facial ex
pressions that sent the au
dience into giggles more than
once.
Always in character, and
what a character, was Fire
stone in the role of Sir Joseph
Porter, Lord Admiral of the
British navy. Firestone's ren
dition of the persnickety, "if
you please" Sir Joseph added
spice to more than one scene.
But there was nothing Sir
Joseph could do that Little
Buttercup, played by Lila An
derson, couldn't fix with a
quick confession. Anderson
did a fine job of tying together
scenes and ultimately bring
ing together more than one
pair of lovers.
Standout performances by
minor characters Dick Dead
eye (Todd Schurk) and Bill
Bobstay (Chris Dant) also de
serve mention. Schurk as the
pessimistic Deadeve was thor
oughly despised for his efforts
to thwart Josephine and
Ralph's elopement. Dant of
fered a nice addition and ex
hibited his musical talent in an
all-too-brief solo spot during
the second act.
For the most part the
chorus sang extremely well,
although things did get out of
hand once or twice when it
seemed the orchestra got
ahead of the singers in some of
the faster paced songs. But
once the initial stiffness wore
off and the players began to
enjoy themselves rather than
wondering if the audience was

having a good time, the show
improved rapidly.
The orchestra, under the
direction of Karl Friburg
shone throughout the evening
— consistently an excellent
vehicle for Gilbert and Sul
livan's compositions.
A word of advice to poten
tial audiences. Don't try to

figure out Gilbert and Sul
livan — just sit back and enjoy
two hours of wonderful mu
sic, some amusing lyrics and a
pleasant Savoyard produc
tion.

wise skillful performances of
Daniel and Young. Two de
lights were the characters
brought to life by Richard
Dehmel and Ed Firestone.
From the moment Dehmel
made his First appearance as
the pompous but lovable Cap
tain Corcoran until the clos
ing scene he commanded at
tention whenever he came on
stage. Unafraid to play the
fool, Dehmel slipped into his

character with ease and ex
hibited a flare for facial ex
pressions that sent the au
dience into giggles more than
once.
Always in character, and
what a character, was Fire
stone in the role of Sir Joseph
Porter, Lord Admiral of the
British navy. Firestone's ren
dition of the persnickety, "if
you please" Sir Joseph added
spice to more than one scene.
But there was nothing Sir
Joseph could do that Little
Buttercup, played by Lila An
derson, couldn't fix with a
quick confession. Anderson
did a fine job of tying together
scenes and ultimately bring
ing together more than one
pair of lovers.
Standout performances by
minor characters Dick Dead
eye (Todd Schurk) and Bill
Bobstay (Chris Dant) also de
serve mention. Schurk as the
pessimistic Deadeve was thor
oughly despised for his efforts
to thwart Josephine and
Ralph's elopement. Dant of
fered a nice addition and ex
hibited his musical talent in an
all-too-brief solo spot during
the second act.
For the most part the
chorus sang extremely well,
although things did get out of
hand once or twice when it
seemed the orchestra got
ahead of the singers in some of
the faster paced songs. But
once the initial stiffness wore
off and the players began to
enjoy themselves rather than
wondering if the audience was

having a good time, the show
improved rapidly.
The orchestra, under the
direction of Karl Friburg
shone throughout the evening
— consistently an excellent
vehicle for Gilbert and Sul
livan's compositions.
A word of advice to poten
tial audiences. Don't try to

figure out Gilbert and Sul
livan — just sit back and enjoy
two hours of wonderful mu
sic, some amusing lyrics and a
pleasant Savoyard produc
tion.

Mark Daniel and Kathleen Young
in H.M.S. Pinafore
Sometimes common
phrases really are true. In the
case of Gilbert and Sullivan's
H.M.S. Pinafore, "our's is not
to reason why" does strike a
resounding chord. The musi
cal, produced by the Stanford
Savoyards, is standard Gil
bert and Sullivan fare. In a
light-hearted two hours
young and not-so-young lov
ers meet, this time aboard the
H.M.S. Pinafore, and profess
undying love only to be sepa
rated by a cruel twist of fate.
By the evening's end however,
all is well as the result of a
highly illogical confession
which brings the lovers to
gether in a "happily forever
after" ending.
But the routine plot and the
lack of logic aren't what mat
ters. What matters is that if
it's Gilbert and Sullivan you
can't go wrong. And the
Savoyards did a pretty good
job as a showcase for the two
masters' music and comedy.
Though the show started on
a slow note that might be at
tributed to opening night jit
ters, the cast managed to pick
up momentum as the per
formance progressed and
seemed to be enjoying itself by
the time the second act rolled
around.
During the opening
number of the show we were
introduced to our hero, sailor
Ralph Rackstraw, as played
bv Mark Daniel. Daniel sings
incredibly well, offering a ro
mantic, crooning style that

could set many hearts aflutter.
Unfortunately Daniel was
probably chosen more for his
voice than his acting ability.
The words he delivered at
times lacked emotional im
pact. Though he obediently
professed his love to the cap
tain's daughter plaved by
Kathleen Young, in an amus
ing repartee, any meaningful
glances between the two that
might have indicated deeper
feelings were lost to the au
dience.
Young as the captain's
dutiful daughter both pleased
and perplexed those present.
Young tripped lightly
through her role as the object
of Rackstraw's attentions and
her lilting soprano com
plemented Daniel's tenor.
However, some of the lyrics
were obscured in her attempts
to reach the higher notes. And
indeed the highest notes
caused some degree of worry
as a number of patrons visibly
flinched as the heroine
strained to expand her range.
A fine supporting cast did
much to round out the other
wise skillful performances of
Daniel and Young. Two de
