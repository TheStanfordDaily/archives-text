# New Law Dean Ely stresses career options, diversity

### MARIE-JEANNE JUILLAND 
John Hart Ely, the outspoken new dean of the
Stanford Law School, boasts impressive credentials
to back his plans for change.
A Yale Law School graduate, Ely helped win the
landmark Gideon v. Wainright decision in the Su
preme Court establishing the poor's constitutional
right to representation; he clerked for Chief Justice
barl Warren and was an attorney for the Warren
Commission's investigation into President John
Kennedy's assassination.
In 1968, he secured an associate professorship at
Y ale. He taught at Harvard for 13 years as one of the
youngest endowed professors. In 1975, he served as
counsel to the Department of Transportation.
He is one ot the few persons with an endowed
deanship at Stanford and the first dean chosen by a
major American law school from outside its own
faculty in more than a decade.
Yet Elv, whose appointment to head the Law
School has widely been acknowledged as a coup for
the University, is also quick to criticize the legal pro
fession for the "frightening" growth of corporate
firms, and for the number of Stanford students

going into those firms.
"Most partners share the sense that the growth of
the profession has taken a life of its own but they
never stop to examine what this trend means to soci
ety," he said.
Similarly, Ely said he thinks "It's tragic when first
year students see the upperclass students in suits and
forget the reason they came to school." He said the
number of Stanford students taking corporate jobs
is higher than at other law schools.
"Students are obsessed with placement and get
ting a job," he said.
Elv criticized the legal profession as "full of law
yers at 40 not knowing why they got there."
He said "several students raised the possibility
that the faculty writes off students as beyond hope to
talk to about alternative careers/' He added, "the
faculty is verv important" in guiding careers, but it's
not that thev're encouraging big firm practice. In
deed, Ely said he thinks that one reason the faculty
committee chose him as dean is because of their in
terest in making students aware of alternatives.
Ely champions public interest law careers, but
savs he doesn't want to "radically change where stu

dents end up." Combatting the exodus to corporate
law, Elv believes, might best be served by a loan for
giveness plan for students with low-paying jobs after
graduation. He notes that the present economic situ
ation and the multitude of corporate law firms offer
security through fat salaries which is difficult to
match.
He added, "We're thinking in even more radical
terms for the future. We should be moving to loans
as opposed to scholarships.
"For example, you would attend law school and
then owe X percent of your income for the next 20
vears. We'd lower the percentage if you earn very lit
tle."
He cautioned, "I'm not sure what we'll do since
the idea is controversial and has enormous initial
costs."
"This loan plan is rational and almost in
evitable," he said, predicting that it will happen
"before we're out of the century."
Elv is optimistic about the Law School faculty's
interest in studying large corporate firms. "At Stan
ford, my hope lies with professors Bill Simon and
