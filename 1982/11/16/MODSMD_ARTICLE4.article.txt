Breshnev buried at Red Square
Moscow — Leonid Brezhnev, who ruled the Soviet Union for the past 18
years, was buried with military honors in Red Square yesterday as his suc
cessor pledged that the dead leader's "cause will be continued in the deeds of
our party and people."
With the sounds of bells, factory and ship sirens and artillery salutes ring
ing from Vladivostok on the Pacific Ocean to Kaliningrad on the Baltic Sea,
Brezhnev's body was lowered into the ground next to the grave of dictator
Joseph Stalin at 12.45 p.m. (4:45 a.m. EST).
Several of his close colleagues wept openly during the final moments of the
ceremony behind the Lenin Mausoleum as Brezhnev's wife, Viktoria, and
daughter, Galina, followed the ancient tradition of Russian orthodoxy by
kissing the dead leader's forehead and lips before the coffin was closed.
Yuri Andropov, who succeeded Brezhnev as Soviet Communist Party
leader, led other top officials to the gravesite to throw handfuls of earth into
the grave.
Numerous foreign representatives including more than 40 political leaders
watched the ceremony in what for Moscow was extraordinarily mild and dry
weather. Vice President George Bush led the American delegation, which
included Secretary of State George Shultz andMoscow Hartman.
Judge dismisses draft case
Los Angeles — U.S. District Judge Terry Hatter dismissed the govern
ment's case yesterday against a California man who refused to register for
the draft, finding that the government's prosecution of David Alan Wayte
was discriminatory.
Hatter found, in addition, that a 1980 presidential proclamation reviving
draft registration was invalid because it was put into effect sooner than per-

mitted by law.
The decision was hailed as "a big victory" by Wayte of nearby
Pasadena, who had contended that he and a handful of others
were singled out for prosecution because of their outspoken op
position to draft registration.
Wayte, the first person indicted in the Los Angeles area for
failing to register for a possible draft, said the dismissal was "a
serious setback to the Selective Service program."
Wavte's attornev, Mark Rosenbaum of the American Civil
Liberties Union, said the outcome was "a self-inflicted indict
ment of this administration — an administration which cowers
behind lies."
Hatter's decision came as little surprise. The government had
invited a dismissal on Nov. 5, when it refused to comply with two
of the judge's orders. The first required that the government give
the defense White House and Pentagon documents dealing with
development of prosecution policy in draft-registration cases.
The second directed Presidential Counselor Edwin Meese to ap
pear as a witness.
Walesa addresses foreign press
Gdansk — Celebrating his first full day of freedom, Lech
Walesa, the leader of Poland's outlawed Solidarity trade union,
yesterday said he was walking along a political tightrope.
Walesa told foreign correspondents in interviews at his home
here that, before his release Sunday, he had gotten a three-hour
lecture from officials at the prosecutor general's office in War
saw. He did not give details, but they presumably warned him
that, under martial-law regulations, he would face arrest if he at
tempted to conduct union activity.
Walesa, a one-time electrician who rose to world attention in
August 1980 when he led a strike of shipyard workers here that
ended with an agreement to set up independent trade unions,
said he was both surprised and "very suspicious" when he first
heard last Wednesday that he would be freed. Insisting that his
release had been unconditional, he said: "I signed nothing; I put
myself under no obligations; I joined nothing; I was simply re
leased."
Aside from putting on weight, Walesa appeared to have
changed little as a result of his 11 months in detention. In the 24
hours since his release, he has displayed the same canny political
sense and feeling for symbolic gestures that marked him out as a
leader in August 1980.
Bush, Andropov meet in Moscow
Moscow — U.S. Vice President George Bush and new Soviet
leader Yuri Andropov met for a half-hour after the Brezhnev fu
neral yesterday to discuss what both said was a desire to improve
relations between the superpowers.
Bush said afterward the talks were "frank, cordial and sub
stantive."
The Soviet news agency Tass said Andropov told Bush the
Kremlin was "prepared to build relations with the United States
on the basis of full equality, non-interference, mutual respect for
the interests of the peoples of both nations and the improvement
of the international situation."
The meeting came four hours after Andropov's predecessor as
Communist Party general secretary, Leonid Brezhnev, was given
a hero's burial in Red Square.
It was the highest-level U.S.-Soviet meeting since Brezhnev
signed the second strategic arms limitation treaty with then-Pres
ident Carter in June 1979. The Kremlin has cited the latter U.S.
failure to ratify that treaty as one major cause of tension between
the superpowers.
Since President Reagan took office in January 198\, East-
West relations also have worsened over Afghanistan, Poland, the
Middle East, and Central America, as well as the arms race.
Bush said he carried a message from Reagan for Andropov on
"the strong desire of the United States to work for an improved
relationship with the Soviet Union."
GOP governors question Reagan's policies
Kansas City, Mo. — Republican governors, their ranks
thinned by the Nov. 2 midterm election, turned on President
Reagan's representatives here yesterday and blamed their losses
on the nationwide unemployment problem and administration
policies that are "scaring people to death."
South Dakota Gov. William Janklow, a conservative Re
publican, used that phrase in arguing with White House pollster
Richard Wirthlin's claim that there is broad public support for
Reagan's policies and the Republican Party faces "no problem
that can't be solved by a 3 percent growth rate." <
The 19 Republican governors gathered here — almost a third
of whom will not be back in office next year — listed a dozen
other concerns, ranging from huge federal budget deficits, ex
cessive military spending and a general perception that "Re
publicans care only about the rich" to antagonism of minorities
and women, tolerance of narrow-focus, negative campaign
groups, and what Janklow called "screwball ideas" for changing
Social Security.
The public spanking of the administration by the Republican
governors marked a political turning point. For the past two
years, while some of them had grumbled privately about Rea
gan's spending priorities, they had strongly supported his efforts
to slow the growth of the federal budget, cut taxes and shift pro
grams back to the states.

Salvadoran guardsmen to face trial
San Salvador — A criminal court judge yesterday ordered five
national guardsmen to stand trial in the murder of four Ameri
can Roman Catholic churchwomen nearly two years ago.
Judge Bernardo Murcia, who conducted the nine-month
equivalent of a grand jurv probe here, ruled there is enough evi
dence for a trial against the guardsmen. Details of the indictment
have not been made public.
The case has added significance because of demands from the
Reagan administration that this and other cases of alleged gov
ernment brutality be stopped as a condition for continued U.S.
aid.
The United States is providing $238.5 million in economic aid
and $81 million in military assistance this year to help the gov
ernment fight a 3-vear-old insurrection by leftist guerrillas.
The three Roman Catholic nuns and a lay worker, who had
been working with Salvadoran peasants, were detained and shot
dead by a national guard patrol 30 miles outside the capital Dec.
4, 1980. Some showed signs of rape.
The bodies of nuns Ita Ford, 40, of Brooklyn, N.Y., and
Maura Clarke, 49, of Queens, N.Y.; Dorothy Dazel, 41, and lay
worker Jean Donovan, both of Cleveland, Ohio, were found by
then-American Ambassador Robert White. They had been hasti
ly buried in a shallow grave.
Allies assert continuation of trade talks
Paris — France and Britain declared yesterday that they will
continue negotiations with the United States on future Western
trade with the Soviet Union but said no concessions were made
to lead President Reagan to lift the U.S. embargo on Soviet natu
ral gas pipeline supplies.
"France is not a part of any deal," French President Francois
Mitterrand told reporters who talked with him at the opening of
an international food exhibition in Paris. "It was up to those who
imposed the embargo to lift it. It's as simple as thai. I have said
all along that it was not negotiable. Good sense has prevailed.
Finally, the embargo has been lifted."
But he said that Reagan's announcement Saturday that there
was agreement "in substance" on a plan to restrict strategic trade
with the Soviet Union "does not correspond to reality for
France."
In London, meanwhile, British Foreign Secretary Francis
Pym, interviewed on television before leaving for Moscow and
the funeral of Soviet President Leonid Brezhnev, said:
"There are no concessions. It was a unilateral decision by the
Americans to apply sanctions, so it was a unilateral decision to
end them. There has been agreement about the principles under
lying trade with Eastern Bloc countries. We ought not to trade in
a way that gives the Soviet Union some strategic or military ad
vantage, or subsidizes the Soviet economy. But this in no way
implies a trade war with the Soviet Union — I should be quite
against that."
Space shuttle landing scheduled
Edwards Air Force Base — Space shuttle Columbia headed for
a dawn landing in the California desert today, its crew elated
with the ship's milestone satellite deployments but deeply disap
pointed bv a canceled space walk.
With commander Vance Brand and pilot Robert Overmyer at
the controls, the shuttle's big engines were to be fired high above
the Indian Ocean to start the spacecraft on an hour-long descent
to a touchdown on a concrete runway at Edwards Air Force
B~s~.
Landing was set for 6:34 a.m. PST, eight minutes after sunrise.
"We look forward to seeing you," Brand told capsule com
municator Michael Coats before the astronauts retired last
night.
Columbia and its men — Brand, Overmyer, William Lenoir
and Joseph Allen — are returning in triumph despite the can
cellation of the space walk, derailed by technical faults in
NASA's new $2 million space suits.
The scrubbing of the dual excursion into the open cargo bay by
Lenoir and Allen, coming yesterday on the last full day of the
five-dav flight, overshadowed earlier accomplishments in which
the ship released its first two commercial satellites into orbit and
qualifed as an operational space transportation system.
That was the major goal, and it was executed flawlessly on the
first two days. The space walk was a secondary, but important,
objective. The failure to carry it out has cast some doubt on the
reliability of the suits and what effect this might have on future
shuttle missions where space walks will be mandatory. Within
two or three years they are to be routine.
Supreme court stiffens immigration
Washington — The Supreme Court eased the way yesterday
for U.S. immigration officials to bar aliens from returning to the
United States if they engage in conduct considered illegal or im
proper during trips abroad.
Overturning a lower court decision, the justices ruled that legal
aliens may be kept at borders or airports for possible exclusion
from the United States and need not be given the lengthier and
more elaborate protections of the deportation process.
The ruling came in the case of Maria Plasencia, an El
Salvadoran woman who was a permanent resident alien in Los
Angeles from 1970 to 1975. She was found to be smuggling illegal
aliens into the United States when she tried to return from a brief
trip to Tijuana, Mexico.

Ihe decision gives immigration officials power to apply
against legal aliens returning to the United States many of the
same broad powers of exclusion they have always wielded over
aliens trying to enter the United States for the first time.
Under federal law, aliens engaging in criminal conduct like
smuggling may be excluded from the United States. So may drug
addicts, chronic alcoholics, paupers, professional beggars,
stowaways, anarchists, Nazi collaborators, prostitutes, sexual
deviants, persons who engage in or advocate polygamy and per
sons likely to become public charges.
I he new ruling applies to any resident alien who leaves the
United States for the purpose of engaging in the sort of activity
for which he could have been excluded in the first place. A 1963
Supreme Court decision protects legal aliens from being barred
from returning alter an "innocent, casual and brief excursion,"
such as a shopping trip across the border.
NFL strike settlement narrowly aborted
New York — A settlement was reported near last night by a go
between in negotiations to end the National Football League
strike. The players' chief negotiator, however, said the owners
had reneged on parts of their offer and "there is not a deal that is
even close."
And Jim Miller, a spokesman for the owners, also said the two
sides remained far apart.
The conflicting reports came as the league announced a cont
ingency plan to resume the season this weekend.
Talks resumed unexpectedly earlier Monday after the NFL
Players Association suffered a setback in efforts to have the
owners cited for bad-faith bargaining.
"Sometime this evening we should have an all-inclusive agree
ment," said Paul Martha, a former NFL running back and law
yer who was acting as an unofficial mediator,
"It is mainly a question of money," he said. "Five or six items
remain to be negotiated. We have a long night of bargaining
ahead."
Even as Martha was talking, however, union chief Ed Garvey
was accusing the owners of "union-busting" and pulling back
portions of their latest contract offer.
"We thought last night that maybe we were getting close, but
those forces in the Management Council who want to defeat the
union apparently prevailed again," Garvey said. "I think they
were hoping the union would say, 4 We can't get there, so let's give
up."
Researchers discover self-splicing gene
New York — Researchers said yesterday they have discovered
genetic material that can rearrange itself without the help of
enzymes, a much simpler process than scientists had thought
possible.
"The discovery is so novel that one doesn't know the full im
plications, but it will certainly change the way we discuss things,"
said Phillip Sharp, a biologist at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology.
The researchers at the University of Colorado in Boulder, led
by the biochemist Thomas Cech, found what they call "self-splic
ing RNA" in a single-celled animal called Tetrahymenathat lives
in ponds.
Ribonucleic acid, one of the complex chemicals that carries ge
netic information, is normally cut, rearranged and spliced to
gether bv enzymes, proteins made for that purpose.
The research will be published today in the journal Cell.
The discovery of self-splicing RNA has attracted the attention
of biologists interested in evolution, Cech said, because it is a
very simple process that could have operated in even the most
primitive organisms.
In higher animals, genes made up of DNA — deox
yribonucleic acid — carry a code that directs the production of
RNA. The RNA is spliced by enzymes, and then it, in turn,
directs the formation of the thousands of proteins that make up
living cells.
The discovery that RNA was rearranged and spliced was made
in the mid-19705. Scientists do not know for certain why splicing
occurs or exactly what its function is. "It could be part of some
central process that we don't know," said Sharp.
Cech was trying to understand that process when he stumbled
on the self-splicing RNA. In trying to determine what enzyme
spliced a particular strand of RNA in Tetrahymena, he purified
the RNA hoping to find a bit of the enzyme attached to it. After
the purification, there was no enzyme present.
Stock prices suffer serious drop
Stock prices suffered their largest loss in three weeks yesterday
amid some new doubts about the interest-rate outlook.
Rates rose in the bond and short-term money markets, partly
in response to money-supply statistics issued late in the day by
the Federal Reserve.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials tumbled 18.49 to
1021.43, its biggest decline since it took a near-record drop of
36.33 points on Oct. 25.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange totaled 78.90 mil
lion shares, down from 95.08 million in the previous session.

Breshnev buried at Red Square
Moscow — Leonid Brezhnev, who ruled the Soviet Union for the past 18
years, was buried with military honors in Red Square yesterday as his suc
cessor pledged that the dead leader's "cause will be continued in the deeds of
our party and people."
With the sounds of bells, factory and ship sirens and artillery salutes ring
ing from Vladivostok on the Pacific Ocean to Kaliningrad on the Baltic Sea,
Brezhnev's body was lowered into the ground next to the grave of dictator
Joseph Stalin at 12.45 p.m. (4:45 a.m. EST).
Several of his close colleagues wept openly during the final moments of the
ceremony behind the Lenin Mausoleum as Brezhnev's wife, Viktoria, and
daughter, Galina, followed the ancient tradition of Russian orthodoxy by
kissing the dead leader's forehead and lips before the coffin was closed.
Yuri Andropov, who succeeded Brezhnev as Soviet Communist Party
leader, led other top officials to the gravesite to throw handfuls of earth into
the grave.
Numerous foreign representatives including more than 40 political leaders
watched the ceremony in what for Moscow was extraordinarily mild and dry
weather. Vice President George Bush led the American delegation, which
included Secretary of State George Shultz andMoscow Hartman.
Judge dismisses draft case
Los Angeles — U.S. District Judge Terry Hatter dismissed the govern
ment's case yesterday against a California man who refused to register for
the draft, finding that the government's prosecution of David Alan Wayte
was discriminatory.
Hatter found, in addition, that a 1980 presidential proclamation reviving
draft registration was invalid because it was put into effect sooner than per-

mitted by law.
The decision was hailed as "a big victory" by Wayte of nearby
Pasadena, who had contended that he and a handful of others
were singled out for prosecution because of their outspoken op
position to draft registration.
Wayte, the first person indicted in the Los Angeles area for
failing to register for a possible draft, said the dismissal was "a
serious setback to the Selective Service program."
Wavte's attornev, Mark Rosenbaum of the American Civil
Liberties Union, said the outcome was "a self-inflicted indict
ment of this administration — an administration which cowers
behind lies."
Hatter's decision came as little surprise. The government had
invited a dismissal on Nov. 5, when it refused to comply with two
of the judge's orders. The first required that the government give
the defense White House and Pentagon documents dealing with
development of prosecution policy in draft-registration cases.
The second directed Presidential Counselor Edwin Meese to ap
pear as a witness.
Walesa addresses foreign press
Gdansk — Celebrating his first full day of freedom, Lech
Walesa, the leader of Poland's outlawed Solidarity trade union,
yesterday said he was walking along a political tightrope.
Walesa told foreign correspondents in interviews at his home
here that, before his release Sunday, he had gotten a three-hour
lecture from officials at the prosecutor general's office in War
saw. He did not give details, but they presumably warned him
that, under martial-law regulations, he would face arrest if he at
tempted to conduct union activity.
Walesa, a one-time electrician who rose to world attention in
August 1980 when he led a strike of shipyard workers here that
ended with an agreement to set up independent trade unions,
said he was both surprised and "very suspicious" when he first
heard last Wednesday that he would be freed. Insisting that his
release had been unconditional, he said: "I signed nothing; I put
myself under no obligations; I joined nothing; I was simply re
leased."
Aside from putting on weight, Walesa appeared to have
changed little as a result of his 11 months in detention. In the 24
hours since his release, he has displayed the same canny political
sense and feeling for symbolic gestures that marked him out as a
leader in August 1980.
Bush, Andropov meet in Moscow
Moscow — U.S. Vice President George Bush and new Soviet
leader Yuri Andropov met for a half-hour after the Brezhnev fu
neral yesterday to discuss what both said was a desire to improve
relations between the superpowers.
Bush said afterward the talks were "frank, cordial and sub
stantive."
The Soviet news agency Tass said Andropov told Bush the
Kremlin was "prepared to build relations with the United States
on the basis of full equality, non-interference, mutual respect for
the interests of the peoples of both nations and the improvement
of the international situation."
The meeting came four hours after Andropov's predecessor as
Communist Party general secretary, Leonid Brezhnev, was given
a hero's burial in Red Square.
It was the highest-level U.S.-Soviet meeting since Brezhnev
signed the second strategic arms limitation treaty with then-Pres
ident Carter in June 1979. The Kremlin has cited the latter U.S.
failure to ratify that treaty as one major cause of tension between
the superpowers.
Since President Reagan took office in January 198\, East-
West relations also have worsened over Afghanistan, Poland, the
Middle East, and Central America, as well as the arms race.
Bush said he carried a message from Reagan for Andropov on
"the strong desire of the United States to work for an improved
relationship with the Soviet Union."
GOP governors question Reagan's policies
Kansas City, Mo. — Republican governors, their ranks
thinned by the Nov. 2 midterm election, turned on President
Reagan's representatives here yesterday and blamed their losses
on the nationwide unemployment problem and administration
policies that are "scaring people to death."
South Dakota Gov. William Janklow, a conservative Re
publican, used that phrase in arguing with White House pollster
Richard Wirthlin's claim that there is broad public support for
Reagan's policies and the Republican Party faces "no problem
that can't be solved by a 3 percent growth rate." <
The 19 Republican governors gathered here — almost a third
of whom will not be back in office next year — listed a dozen
other concerns, ranging from huge federal budget deficits, ex
cessive military spending and a general perception that "Re
publicans care only about the rich" to antagonism of minorities
and women, tolerance of narrow-focus, negative campaign
groups, and what Janklow called "screwball ideas" for changing
Social Security.
The public spanking of the administration by the Republican
governors marked a political turning point. For the past two
years, while some of them had grumbled privately about Rea
gan's spending priorities, they had strongly supported his efforts
to slow the growth of the federal budget, cut taxes and shift pro
grams back to the states.

Salvadoran guardsmen to face trial
San Salvador — A criminal court judge yesterday ordered five
national guardsmen to stand trial in the murder of four Ameri
can Roman Catholic churchwomen nearly two years ago.
Judge Bernardo Murcia, who conducted the nine-month
equivalent of a grand jurv probe here, ruled there is enough evi
dence for a trial against the guardsmen. Details of the indictment
have not been made public.
The case has added significance because of demands from the
Reagan administration that this and other cases of alleged gov
ernment brutality be stopped as a condition for continued U.S.
aid.
The United States is providing $238.5 million in economic aid
and $81 million in military assistance this year to help the gov
ernment fight a 3-vear-old insurrection by leftist guerrillas.
The three Roman Catholic nuns and a lay worker, who had
been working with Salvadoran peasants, were detained and shot
dead by a national guard patrol 30 miles outside the capital Dec.
4, 1980. Some showed signs of rape.
The bodies of nuns Ita Ford, 40, of Brooklyn, N.Y., and
Maura Clarke, 49, of Queens, N.Y.; Dorothy Dazel, 41, and lay
worker Jean Donovan, both of Cleveland, Ohio, were found by
then-American Ambassador Robert White. They had been hasti
ly buried in a shallow grave.
Allies assert continuation of trade talks
Paris — France and Britain declared yesterday that they will
continue negotiations with the United States on future Western
trade with the Soviet Union but said no concessions were made
to lead President Reagan to lift the U.S. embargo on Soviet natu
ral gas pipeline supplies.
"France is not a part of any deal," French President Francois
Mitterrand told reporters who talked with him at the opening of
an international food exhibition in Paris. "It was up to those who
imposed the embargo to lift it. It's as simple as thai. I have said
all along that it was not negotiable. Good sense has prevailed.
Finally, the embargo has been lifted."
But he said that Reagan's announcement Saturday that there
was agreement "in substance" on a plan to restrict strategic trade
with the Soviet Union "does not correspond to reality for
France."
In London, meanwhile, British Foreign Secretary Francis
Pym, interviewed on television before leaving for Moscow and
the funeral of Soviet President Leonid Brezhnev, said:
"There are no concessions. It was a unilateral decision by the
Americans to apply sanctions, so it was a unilateral decision to
end them. There has been agreement about the principles under
lying trade with Eastern Bloc countries. We ought not to trade in
a way that gives the Soviet Union some strategic or military ad
vantage, or subsidizes the Soviet economy. But this in no way
implies a trade war with the Soviet Union — I should be quite
against that."
Space shuttle landing scheduled
Edwards Air Force Base — Space shuttle Columbia headed for
a dawn landing in the California desert today, its crew elated
with the ship's milestone satellite deployments but deeply disap
pointed bv a canceled space walk.
With commander Vance Brand and pilot Robert Overmyer at
the controls, the shuttle's big engines were to be fired high above
the Indian Ocean to start the spacecraft on an hour-long descent
to a touchdown on a concrete runway at Edwards Air Force
B~s~.
Landing was set for 6:34 a.m. PST, eight minutes after sunrise.
"We look forward to seeing you," Brand told capsule com
municator Michael Coats before the astronauts retired last
night.
Columbia and its men — Brand, Overmyer, William Lenoir
and Joseph Allen — are returning in triumph despite the can
cellation of the space walk, derailed by technical faults in
NASA's new $2 million space suits.
The scrubbing of the dual excursion into the open cargo bay by
Lenoir and Allen, coming yesterday on the last full day of the
five-dav flight, overshadowed earlier accomplishments in which
the ship released its first two commercial satellites into orbit and
qualifed as an operational space transportation system.
That was the major goal, and it was executed flawlessly on the
first two days. The space walk was a secondary, but important,
objective. The failure to carry it out has cast some doubt on the
reliability of the suits and what effect this might have on future
shuttle missions where space walks will be mandatory. Within
two or three years they are to be routine.
Supreme court stiffens immigration
Washington — The Supreme Court eased the way yesterday
for U.S. immigration officials to bar aliens from returning to the
United States if they engage in conduct considered illegal or im
proper during trips abroad.
Overturning a lower court decision, the justices ruled that legal
aliens may be kept at borders or airports for possible exclusion
from the United States and need not be given the lengthier and
more elaborate protections of the deportation process.
The ruling came in the case of Maria Plasencia, an El
Salvadoran woman who was a permanent resident alien in Los
Angeles from 1970 to 1975. She was found to be smuggling illegal
aliens into the United States when she tried to return from a brief
trip to Tijuana, Mexico.

Ihe decision gives immigration officials power to apply
against legal aliens returning to the United States many of the
same broad powers of exclusion they have always wielded over
aliens trying to enter the United States for the first time.
Under federal law, aliens engaging in criminal conduct like
smuggling may be excluded from the United States. So may drug
addicts, chronic alcoholics, paupers, professional beggars,
stowaways, anarchists, Nazi collaborators, prostitutes, sexual
deviants, persons who engage in or advocate polygamy and per
sons likely to become public charges.
I he new ruling applies to any resident alien who leaves the
United States for the purpose of engaging in the sort of activity
for which he could have been excluded in the first place. A 1963
Supreme Court decision protects legal aliens from being barred
from returning alter an "innocent, casual and brief excursion,"
such as a shopping trip across the border.
NFL strike settlement narrowly aborted
New York — A settlement was reported near last night by a go
between in negotiations to end the National Football League
strike. The players' chief negotiator, however, said the owners
had reneged on parts of their offer and "there is not a deal that is
even close."
And Jim Miller, a spokesman for the owners, also said the two
sides remained far apart.
The conflicting reports came as the league announced a cont
ingency plan to resume the season this weekend.
Talks resumed unexpectedly earlier Monday after the NFL
Players Association suffered a setback in efforts to have the
owners cited for bad-faith bargaining.
"Sometime this evening we should have an all-inclusive agree
ment," said Paul Martha, a former NFL running back and law
yer who was acting as an unofficial mediator,
"It is mainly a question of money," he said. "Five or six items
remain to be negotiated. We have a long night of bargaining
ahead."
Even as Martha was talking, however, union chief Ed Garvey
was accusing the owners of "union-busting" and pulling back
portions of their latest contract offer.
"We thought last night that maybe we were getting close, but
those forces in the Management Council who want to defeat the
union apparently prevailed again," Garvey said. "I think they
were hoping the union would say, 4 We can't get there, so let's give
up."
Researchers discover self-splicing gene
New York — Researchers said yesterday they have discovered
genetic material that can rearrange itself without the help of
enzymes, a much simpler process than scientists had thought
possible.
"The discovery is so novel that one doesn't know the full im
plications, but it will certainly change the way we discuss things,"
said Phillip Sharp, a biologist at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology.
The researchers at the University of Colorado in Boulder, led
by the biochemist Thomas Cech, found what they call "self-splic
ing RNA" in a single-celled animal called Tetrahymenathat lives
in ponds.
Ribonucleic acid, one of the complex chemicals that carries ge
netic information, is normally cut, rearranged and spliced to
gether bv enzymes, proteins made for that purpose.
The research will be published today in the journal Cell.
The discovery of self-splicing RNA has attracted the attention
of biologists interested in evolution, Cech said, because it is a
very simple process that could have operated in even the most
primitive organisms.
In higher animals, genes made up of DNA — deox
yribonucleic acid — carry a code that directs the production of
RNA. The RNA is spliced by enzymes, and then it, in turn,
directs the formation of the thousands of proteins that make up
living cells.
The discovery that RNA was rearranged and spliced was made
in the mid-19705. Scientists do not know for certain why splicing
occurs or exactly what its function is. "It could be part of some
central process that we don't know," said Sharp.
Cech was trying to understand that process when he stumbled
on the self-splicing RNA. In trying to determine what enzyme
spliced a particular strand of RNA in Tetrahymena, he purified
the RNA hoping to find a bit of the enzyme attached to it. After
the purification, there was no enzyme present.
Stock prices suffer serious drop
Stock prices suffered their largest loss in three weeks yesterday
amid some new doubts about the interest-rate outlook.
Rates rose in the bond and short-term money markets, partly
in response to money-supply statistics issued late in the day by
the Federal Reserve.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials tumbled 18.49 to
1021.43, its biggest decline since it took a near-record drop of
36.33 points on Oct. 25.

Breshnev buried at Red Square
Moscow — Leonid Brezhnev, who ruled the Soviet Union for the past 18
years, was buried with military honors in Red Square yesterday as his suc
cessor pledged that the dead leader's "cause will be continued in the deeds of
our party and people."
With the sounds of bells, factory and ship sirens and artillery salutes ring
ing from Vladivostok on the Pacific Ocean to Kaliningrad on the Baltic Sea,
Brezhnev's body was lowered into the ground next to the grave of dictator
Joseph Stalin at 12.45 p.m. (4:45 a.m. EST).
Several of his close colleagues wept openly during the final moments of the
ceremony behind the Lenin Mausoleum as Brezhnev's wife, Viktoria, and
daughter, Galina, followed the ancient tradition of Russian orthodoxy by
kissing the dead leader's forehead and lips before the coffin was closed.
Yuri Andropov, who succeeded Brezhnev as Soviet Communist Party
leader, led other top officials to the gravesite to throw handfuls of earth into
the grave.
Numerous foreign representatives including more than 40 political leaders
watched the ceremony in what for Moscow was extraordinarily mild and dry
weather. Vice President George Bush led the American delegation, which
included Secretary of State George Shultz andMoscow Hartman.
Judge dismisses draft case
Los Angeles — U.S. District Judge Terry Hatter dismissed the govern
ment's case yesterday against a California man who refused to register for
the draft, finding that the government's prosecution of David Alan Wayte
was discriminatory.
Hatter found, in addition, that a 1980 presidential proclamation reviving
draft registration was invalid because it was put into effect sooner than per-

mitted by law.
The decision was hailed as "a big victory" by Wayte of nearby
Pasadena, who had contended that he and a handful of others
were singled out for prosecution because of their outspoken op
position to draft registration.
Wayte, the first person indicted in the Los Angeles area for
failing to register for a possible draft, said the dismissal was "a
serious setback to the Selective Service program."
Wavte's attornev, Mark Rosenbaum of the American Civil
Liberties Union, said the outcome was "a self-inflicted indict
ment of this administration — an administration which cowers
behind lies."
Hatter's decision came as little surprise. The government had
invited a dismissal on Nov. 5, when it refused to comply with two
of the judge's orders. The first required that the government give
the defense White House and Pentagon documents dealing with
development of prosecution policy in draft-registration cases.
The second directed Presidential Counselor Edwin Meese to ap
pear as a witness.
Walesa addresses foreign press
Gdansk — Celebrating his first full day of freedom, Lech
Walesa, the leader of Poland's outlawed Solidarity trade union,
yesterday said he was walking along a political tightrope.
Walesa told foreign correspondents in interviews at his home
here that, before his release Sunday, he had gotten a three-hour
lecture from officials at the prosecutor general's office in War
saw. He did not give details, but they presumably warned him
that, under martial-law regulations, he would face arrest if he at
tempted to conduct union activity.
Walesa, a one-time electrician who rose to world attention in
August 1980 when he led a strike of shipyard workers here that
ended with an agreement to set up independent trade unions,
said he was both surprised and "very suspicious" when he first
heard last Wednesday that he would be freed. Insisting that his
release had been unconditional, he said: "I signed nothing; I put
myself under no obligations; I joined nothing; I was simply re
leased."
Aside from putting on weight, Walesa appeared to have
changed little as a result of his 11 months in detention. In the 24
hours since his release, he has displayed the same canny political
sense and feeling for symbolic gestures that marked him out as a
leader in August 1980.
Bush, Andropov meet in Moscow
Moscow — U.S. Vice President George Bush and new Soviet
leader Yuri Andropov met for a half-hour after the Brezhnev fu
neral yesterday to discuss what both said was a desire to improve
relations between the superpowers.
Bush said afterward the talks were "frank, cordial and sub
stantive."
The Soviet news agency Tass said Andropov told Bush the
Kremlin was "prepared to build relations with the United States
on the basis of full equality, non-interference, mutual respect for
the interests of the peoples of both nations and the improvement
of the international situation."
The meeting came four hours after Andropov's predecessor as
Communist Party general secretary, Leonid Brezhnev, was given
a hero's burial in Red Square.
It was the highest-level U.S.-Soviet meeting since Brezhnev
signed the second strategic arms limitation treaty with then-Pres
ident Carter in June 1979. The Kremlin has cited the latter U.S.
failure to ratify that treaty as one major cause of tension between
the superpowers.
Since President Reagan took office in January 198\, East-
West relations also have worsened over Afghanistan, Poland, the
Middle East, and Central America, as well as the arms race.
Bush said he carried a message from Reagan for Andropov on
"the strong desire of the United States to work for an improved
relationship with the Soviet Union."
GOP governors question Reagan's policies
Kansas City, Mo. — Republican governors, their ranks
thinned by the Nov. 2 midterm election, turned on President
Reagan's representatives here yesterday and blamed their losses
on the nationwide unemployment problem and administration
policies that are "scaring people to death."
South Dakota Gov. William Janklow, a conservative Re
publican, used that phrase in arguing with White House pollster
Richard Wirthlin's claim that there is broad public support for
Reagan's policies and the Republican Party faces "no problem
that can't be solved by a 3 percent growth rate." <
The 19 Republican governors gathered here — almost a third
of whom will not be back in office next year — listed a dozen
other concerns, ranging from huge federal budget deficits, ex
cessive military spending and a general perception that "Re
publicans care only about the rich" to antagonism of minorities
and women, tolerance of narrow-focus, negative campaign
groups, and what Janklow called "screwball ideas" for changing
Social Security.
The public spanking of the administration by the Republican
governors marked a political turning point. For the past two
years, while some of them had grumbled privately about Rea
gan's spending priorities, they had strongly supported his efforts
to slow the growth of the federal budget, cut taxes and shift pro
grams back to the states.

Salvadoran guardsmen to face trial
San Salvador — A criminal court judge yesterday ordered five
national guardsmen to stand trial in the murder of four Ameri
can Roman Catholic churchwomen nearly two years ago.
Judge Bernardo Murcia, who conducted the nine-month
equivalent of a grand jurv probe here, ruled there is enough evi
dence for a trial against the guardsmen. Details of the indictment
have not been made public.
The case has added significance because of demands from the
Reagan administration that this and other cases of alleged gov
ernment brutality be stopped as a condition for continued U.S.
aid.
The United States is providing $238.5 million in economic aid
and $81 million in military assistance this year to help the gov
ernment fight a 3-vear-old insurrection by leftist guerrillas.
The three Roman Catholic nuns and a lay worker, who had
been working with Salvadoran peasants, were detained and shot
dead by a national guard patrol 30 miles outside the capital Dec.
4, 1980. Some showed signs of rape.
The bodies of nuns Ita Ford, 40, of Brooklyn, N.Y., and
Maura Clarke, 49, of Queens, N.Y.; Dorothy Dazel, 41, and lay
worker Jean Donovan, both of Cleveland, Ohio, were found by
then-American Ambassador Robert White. They had been hasti
ly buried in a shallow grave.
Allies assert continuation of trade talks
Paris — France and Britain declared yesterday that they will
continue negotiations with the United States on future Western
trade with the Soviet Union but said no concessions were made
to lead President Reagan to lift the U.S. embargo on Soviet natu
ral gas pipeline supplies.
"France is not a part of any deal," French President Francois
Mitterrand told reporters who talked with him at the opening of
an international food exhibition in Paris. "It was up to those who
imposed the embargo to lift it. It's as simple as thai. I have said
all along that it was not negotiable. Good sense has prevailed.
Finally, the embargo has been lifted."
But he said that Reagan's announcement Saturday that there
was agreement "in substance" on a plan to restrict strategic trade
with the Soviet Union "does not correspond to reality for
France."
In London, meanwhile, British Foreign Secretary Francis
Pym, interviewed on television before leaving for Moscow and
the funeral of Soviet President Leonid Brezhnev, said:
"There are no concessions. It was a unilateral decision by the
Americans to apply sanctions, so it was a unilateral decision to
end them. There has been agreement about the principles under
lying trade with Eastern Bloc countries. We ought not to trade in
a way that gives the Soviet Union some strategic or military ad
vantage, or subsidizes the Soviet economy. But this in no way
implies a trade war with the Soviet Union — I should be quite
against that."
Space shuttle landing scheduled
Edwards Air Force Base — Space shuttle Columbia headed for
a dawn landing in the California desert today, its crew elated
with the ship's milestone satellite deployments but deeply disap
pointed bv a canceled space walk.
With commander Vance Brand and pilot Robert Overmyer at
the controls, the shuttle's big engines were to be fired high above
the Indian Ocean to start the spacecraft on an hour-long descent
to a touchdown on a concrete runway at Edwards Air Force
B~s~.
Landing was set for 6:34 a.m. PST, eight minutes after sunrise.
"We look forward to seeing you," Brand told capsule com
municator Michael Coats before the astronauts retired last
night.
Columbia and its men — Brand, Overmyer, William Lenoir
and Joseph Allen — are returning in triumph despite the can
cellation of the space walk, derailed by technical faults in
NASA's new $2 million space suits.
The scrubbing of the dual excursion into the open cargo bay by
Lenoir and Allen, coming yesterday on the last full day of the
five-dav flight, overshadowed earlier accomplishments in which
the ship released its first two commercial satellites into orbit and
qualifed as an operational space transportation system.
That was the major goal, and it was executed flawlessly on the
first two days. The space walk was a secondary, but important,
objective. The failure to carry it out has cast some doubt on the
reliability of the suits and what effect this might have on future
shuttle missions where space walks will be mandatory. Within
two or three years they are to be routine.
Supreme court stiffens immigration
Washington — The Supreme Court eased the way yesterday
for U.S. immigration officials to bar aliens from returning to the
United States if they engage in conduct considered illegal or im
proper during trips abroad.
Overturning a lower court decision, the justices ruled that legal
aliens may be kept at borders or airports for possible exclusion
from the United States and need not be given the lengthier and
more elaborate protections of the deportation process.
The ruling came in the case of Maria Plasencia, an El
Salvadoran woman who was a permanent resident alien in Los
Angeles from 1970 to 1975. She was found to be smuggling illegal
aliens into the United States when she tried to return from a brief
trip to Tijuana, Mexico.

Ihe decision gives immigration officials power to apply
against legal aliens returning to the United States many of the
same broad powers of exclusion they have always wielded over
aliens trying to enter the United States for the first time.
Under federal law, aliens engaging in criminal conduct like
smuggling may be excluded from the United States. So may drug
addicts, chronic alcoholics, paupers, professional beggars,
stowaways, anarchists, Nazi collaborators, prostitutes, sexual
deviants, persons who engage in or advocate polygamy and per
sons likely to become public charges.
I he new ruling applies to any resident alien who leaves the
United States for the purpose of engaging in the sort of activity
for which he could have been excluded in the first place. A 1963
Supreme Court decision protects legal aliens from being barred
from returning alter an "innocent, casual and brief excursion,"
such as a shopping trip across the border.
NFL strike settlement narrowly aborted
New York — A settlement was reported near last night by a go
between in negotiations to end the National Football League
strike. The players' chief negotiator, however, said the owners
had reneged on parts of their offer and "there is not a deal that is
even close."
And Jim Miller, a spokesman for the owners, also said the two
sides remained far apart.
The conflicting reports came as the league announced a cont
ingency plan to resume the season this weekend.
Talks resumed unexpectedly earlier Monday after the NFL
Players Association suffered a setback in efforts to have the
owners cited for bad-faith bargaining.
"Sometime this evening we should have an all-inclusive agree
ment," said Paul Martha, a former NFL running back and law
yer who was acting as an unofficial mediator,
"It is mainly a question of money," he said. "Five or six items
remain to be negotiated. We have a long night of bargaining
ahead."
Even as Martha was talking, however, union chief Ed Garvey
was accusing the owners of "union-busting" and pulling back
portions of their latest contract offer.
"We thought last night that maybe we were getting close, but
those forces in the Management Council who want to defeat the
union apparently prevailed again," Garvey said. "I think they
were hoping the union would say, 4 We can't get there, so let's give
up."
Researchers discover self-splicing gene
New York — Researchers said yesterday they have discovered
genetic material that can rearrange itself without the help of
enzymes, a much simpler process than scientists had thought
possible.
"The discovery is so novel that one doesn't know the full im
plications, but it will certainly change the way we discuss things,"
said Phillip Sharp, a biologist at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology.
The researchers at the University of Colorado in Boulder, led
by the biochemist Thomas Cech, found what they call "self-splic
ing RNA" in a single-celled animal called Tetrahymenathat lives
in ponds.
Ribonucleic acid, one of the complex chemicals that carries ge
netic information, is normally cut, rearranged and spliced to
gether bv enzymes, proteins made for that purpose.
The research will be published today in the journal Cell.
The discovery of self-splicing RNA has attracted the attention
of biologists interested in evolution, Cech said, because it is a
very simple process that could have operated in even the most
primitive organisms.
In higher animals, genes made up of DNA — deox
yribonucleic acid — carry a code that directs the production of
RNA. The RNA is spliced by enzymes, and then it, in turn,
directs the formation of the thousands of proteins that make up
living cells.
The discovery that RNA was rearranged and spliced was made
in the mid-19705. Scientists do not know for certain why splicing
occurs or exactly what its function is. "It could be part of some
central process that we don't know," said Sharp.
Cech was trying to understand that process when he stumbled
on the self-splicing RNA. In trying to determine what enzyme
spliced a particular strand of RNA in Tetrahymena, he purified
the RNA hoping to find a bit of the enzyme attached to it. After
the purification, there was no enzyme present.
Stock prices suffer serious drop
Stock prices suffered their largest loss in three weeks yesterday
amid some new doubts about the interest-rate outlook.
Rates rose in the bond and short-term money markets, partly

The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials tumbled 18.49 to
1021.43, its biggest decline since it took a near-record drop of
36.33 points on Oct. 25.

The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials tumbled 18.49 to
1021.43, its biggest decline since it took a near-record drop of
36.33 points on Oct. 25.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange totaled 78.90 mil

Breshnev buried at Red Square
Moscow — Leonid Brezhnev, who ruled the Soviet Union for the past 18
years, was buried with military honors in Red Square yesterday as his suc
cessor pledged that the dead leader's "cause will be continued in the deeds of
our party and people."
With the sounds of bells, factory and ship sirens and artillery salutes ring
ing from Vladivostok on the Pacific Ocean to Kaliningrad on the Baltic Sea,
Brezhnev's body was lowered into the ground next to the grave of dictator
Joseph Stalin at 12.45 p.m. (4:45 a.m. EST).
Several of his close colleagues wept openly during the final moments of the
ceremony behind the Lenin Mausoleum as Brezhnev's wife, Viktoria, and
daughter, Galina, followed the ancient tradition of Russian orthodoxy by
kissing the dead leader's forehead and lips before the coffin was closed.
Yuri Andropov, who succeeded Brezhnev as Soviet Communist Party
leader, led other top officials to the gravesite to throw handfuls of earth into
the grave.
Numerous foreign representatives including more than 40 political leaders
watched the ceremony in what for Moscow was extraordinarily mild and dry
weather. Vice President George Bush led the American delegation, which
included Secretary of State George Shultz andMoscow Hartman.
Judge dismisses draft case
Los Angeles — U.S. District Judge Terry Hatter dismissed the govern
ment's case yesterday against a California man who refused to register for
the draft, finding that the government's prosecution of David Alan Wayte
was discriminatory.
Hatter found, in addition, that a 1980 presidential proclamation reviving
draft registration was invalid because it was put into effect sooner than per-

mitted by law.
The decision was hailed as "a big victory" by Wayte of nearby
Pasadena, who had contended that he and a handful of others
were singled out for prosecution because of their outspoken op
position to draft registration.
Wayte, the first person indicted in the Los Angeles area for
failing to register for a possible draft, said the dismissal was "a
serious setback to the Selective Service program."
Wavte's attornev, Mark Rosenbaum of the American Civil
Liberties Union, said the outcome was "a self-inflicted indict
ment of this administration — an administration which cowers
behind lies."
Hatter's decision came as little surprise. The government had
invited a dismissal on Nov. 5, when it refused to comply with two
of the judge's orders. The first required that the government give
the defense White House and Pentagon documents dealing with
development of prosecution policy in draft-registration cases.
The second directed Presidential Counselor Edwin Meese to ap
pear as a witness.
Walesa addresses foreign press
Gdansk — Celebrating his first full day of freedom, Lech
Walesa, the leader of Poland's outlawed Solidarity trade union,
yesterday said he was walking along a political tightrope.
Walesa told foreign correspondents in interviews at his home
here that, before his release Sunday, he had gotten a three-hour
lecture from officials at the prosecutor general's office in War
saw. He did not give details, but they presumably warned him
that, under martial-law regulations, he would face arrest if he at
tempted to conduct union activity.
Walesa, a one-time electrician who rose to world attention in
August 1980 when he led a strike of shipyard workers here that
ended with an agreement to set up independent trade unions,
said he was both surprised and "very suspicious" when he first
heard last Wednesday that he would be freed. Insisting that his
release had been unconditional, he said: "I signed nothing; I put
myself under no obligations; I joined nothing; I was simply re
leased."
Aside from putting on weight, Walesa appeared to have
changed little as a result of his 11 months in detention. In the 24
hours since his release, he has displayed the same canny political
sense and feeling for symbolic gestures that marked him out as a
leader in August 1980.
Bush, Andropov meet in Moscow
Moscow — U.S. Vice President George Bush and new Soviet
leader Yuri Andropov met for a half-hour after the Brezhnev fu
neral yesterday to discuss what both said was a desire to improve
relations between the superpowers.
Bush said afterward the talks were "frank, cordial and sub
stantive."
The Soviet news agency Tass said Andropov told Bush the
Kremlin was "prepared to build relations with the United States
on the basis of full equality, non-interference, mutual respect for
the interests of the peoples of both nations and the improvement
of the international situation."
The meeting came four hours after Andropov's predecessor as
Communist Party general secretary, Leonid Brezhnev, was given
a hero's burial in Red Square.
It was the highest-level U.S.-Soviet meeting since Brezhnev
signed the second strategic arms limitation treaty with then-Pres
ident Carter in June 1979. The Kremlin has cited the latter U.S.
failure to ratify that treaty as one major cause of tension between
the superpowers.
Since President Reagan took office in January 198\, East-
West relations also have worsened over Afghanistan, Poland, the
Middle East, and Central America, as well as the arms race.
Bush said he carried a message from Reagan for Andropov on
"the strong desire of the United States to work for an improved
relationship with the Soviet Union."
GOP governors question Reagan's policies
Kansas City, Mo. — Republican governors, their ranks
thinned by the Nov. 2 midterm election, turned on President
Reagan's representatives here yesterday and blamed their losses
on the nationwide unemployment problem and administration
policies that are "scaring people to death."
South Dakota Gov. William Janklow, a conservative Re
publican, used that phrase in arguing with White House pollster
Richard Wirthlin's claim that there is broad public support for
Reagan's policies and the Republican Party faces "no problem
that can't be solved by a 3 percent growth rate." <
The 19 Republican governors gathered here — almost a third
of whom will not be back in office next year — listed a dozen
other concerns, ranging from huge federal budget deficits, ex
cessive military spending and a general perception that "Re
publicans care only about the rich" to antagonism of minorities
and women, tolerance of narrow-focus, negative campaign
groups, and what Janklow called "screwball ideas" for changing
Social Security.
The public spanking of the administration by the Republican
governors marked a political turning point. For the past two
years, while some of them had grumbled privately about Rea
gan's spending priorities, they had strongly supported his efforts
to slow the growth of the federal budget, cut taxes and shift pro
grams back to the states.

Salvadoran guardsmen to face trial
San Salvador — A criminal court judge yesterday ordered five
national guardsmen to stand trial in the murder of four Ameri
can Roman Catholic churchwomen nearly two years ago.
Judge Bernardo Murcia, who conducted the nine-month
equivalent of a grand jurv probe here, ruled there is enough evi
dence for a trial against the guardsmen. Details of the indictment
have not been made public.
The case has added significance because of demands from the
Reagan administration that this and other cases of alleged gov
ernment brutality be stopped as a condition for continued U.S.
aid.
The United States is providing $238.5 million in economic aid
and $81 million in military assistance this year to help the gov
ernment fight a 3-vear-old insurrection by leftist guerrillas.
The three Roman Catholic nuns and a lay worker, who had
been working with Salvadoran peasants, were detained and shot
dead by a national guard patrol 30 miles outside the capital Dec.
4, 1980. Some showed signs of rape.
The bodies of nuns Ita Ford, 40, of Brooklyn, N.Y., and
Maura Clarke, 49, of Queens, N.Y.; Dorothy Dazel, 41, and lay
worker Jean Donovan, both of Cleveland, Ohio, were found by
then-American Ambassador Robert White. They had been hasti
ly buried in a shallow grave.
Allies assert continuation of trade talks
Paris — France and Britain declared yesterday that they will
continue negotiations with the United States on future Western
trade with the Soviet Union but said no concessions were made
to lead President Reagan to lift the U.S. embargo on Soviet natu
ral gas pipeline supplies.
"France is not a part of any deal," French President Francois
Mitterrand told reporters who talked with him at the opening of
an international food exhibition in Paris. "It was up to those who
imposed the embargo to lift it. It's as simple as thai. I have said
all along that it was not negotiable. Good sense has prevailed.
Finally, the embargo has been lifted."
But he said that Reagan's announcement Saturday that there
was agreement "in substance" on a plan to restrict strategic trade
with the Soviet Union "does not correspond to reality for
France."
In London, meanwhile, British Foreign Secretary Francis
Pym, interviewed on television before leaving for Moscow and
the funeral of Soviet President Leonid Brezhnev, said:
"There are no concessions. It was a unilateral decision by the
Americans to apply sanctions, so it was a unilateral decision to
end them. There has been agreement about the principles under
lying trade with Eastern Bloc countries. We ought not to trade in
a way that gives the Soviet Union some strategic or military ad
vantage, or subsidizes the Soviet economy. But this in no way
implies a trade war with the Soviet Union — I should be quite
against that."
Space shuttle landing scheduled
Edwards Air Force Base — Space shuttle Columbia headed for
a dawn landing in the California desert today, its crew elated
with the ship's milestone satellite deployments but deeply disap
pointed bv a canceled space walk.
With commander Vance Brand and pilot Robert Overmyer at
the controls, the shuttle's big engines were to be fired high above
the Indian Ocean to start the spacecraft on an hour-long descent
to a touchdown on a concrete runway at Edwards Air Force
B~s~.
Landing was set for 6:34 a.m. PST, eight minutes after sunrise.
"We look forward to seeing you," Brand told capsule com
municator Michael Coats before the astronauts retired last
night.
Columbia and its men — Brand, Overmyer, William Lenoir
and Joseph Allen — are returning in triumph despite the can
cellation of the space walk, derailed by technical faults in
NASA's new $2 million space suits.
The scrubbing of the dual excursion into the open cargo bay by
Lenoir and Allen, coming yesterday on the last full day of the
five-dav flight, overshadowed earlier accomplishments in which
the ship released its first two commercial satellites into orbit and
qualifed as an operational space transportation system.
That was the major goal, and it was executed flawlessly on the
first two days. The space walk was a secondary, but important,
objective. The failure to carry it out has cast some doubt on the
reliability of the suits and what effect this might have on future
shuttle missions where space walks will be mandatory. Within
two or three years they are to be routine.
Supreme court stiffens immigration
Washington — The Supreme Court eased the way yesterday
for U.S. immigration officials to bar aliens from returning to the
United States if they engage in conduct considered illegal or im
proper during trips abroad.
Overturning a lower court decision, the justices ruled that legal
aliens may be kept at borders or airports for possible exclusion
from the United States and need not be given the lengthier and
more elaborate protections of the deportation process.
The ruling came in the case of Maria Plasencia, an El
Salvadoran woman who was a permanent resident alien in Los
Angeles from 1970 to 1975. She was found to be smuggling illegal
aliens into the United States when she tried to return from a brief
trip to Tijuana, Mexico.

Ihe decision gives immigration officials power to apply
against legal aliens returning to the United States many of the
same broad powers of exclusion they have always wielded over
aliens trying to enter the United States for the first time.
Under federal law, aliens engaging in criminal conduct like
smuggling may be excluded from the United States. So may drug
addicts, chronic alcoholics, paupers, professional beggars,
stowaways, anarchists, Nazi collaborators, prostitutes, sexual
deviants, persons who engage in or advocate polygamy and per
sons likely to become public charges.
I he new ruling applies to any resident alien who leaves the
United States for the purpose of engaging in the sort of activity
for which he could have been excluded in the first place. A 1963
Supreme Court decision protects legal aliens from being barred
from returning alter an "innocent, casual and brief excursion,"
such as a shopping trip across the border.
NFL strike settlement narrowly aborted
New York — A settlement was reported near last night by a go
between in negotiations to end the National Football League
strike. The players' chief negotiator, however, said the owners
had reneged on parts of their offer and "there is not a deal that is
even close."
And Jim Miller, a spokesman for the owners, also said the two
sides remained far apart.
The conflicting reports came as the league announced a cont
ingency plan to resume the season this weekend.
Talks resumed unexpectedly earlier Monday after the NFL
Players Association suffered a setback in efforts to have the
owners cited for bad-faith bargaining.
"Sometime this evening we should have an all-inclusive agree
ment," said Paul Martha, a former NFL running back and law
yer who was acting as an unofficial mediator,
"It is mainly a question of money," he said. "Five or six items
remain to be negotiated. We have a long night of bargaining
ahead."
Even as Martha was talking, however, union chief Ed Garvey
was accusing the owners of "union-busting" and pulling back
portions of their latest contract offer.
"We thought last night that maybe we were getting close, but
those forces in the Management Council who want to defeat the
union apparently prevailed again," Garvey said. "I think they
were hoping the union would say, 4 We can't get there, so let's give
up."
Researchers discover self-splicing gene
New York — Researchers said yesterday they have discovered
genetic material that can rearrange itself without the help of
enzymes, a much simpler process than scientists had thought
possible.
"The discovery is so novel that one doesn't know the full im
plications, but it will certainly change the way we discuss things,"
said Phillip Sharp, a biologist at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology.
The researchers at the University of Colorado in Boulder, led
by the biochemist Thomas Cech, found what they call "self-splic
ing RNA" in a single-celled animal called Tetrahymenathat lives
in ponds.
Ribonucleic acid, one of the complex chemicals that carries ge
netic information, is normally cut, rearranged and spliced to
gether bv enzymes, proteins made for that purpose.
The research will be published today in the journal Cell.
The discovery of self-splicing RNA has attracted the attention
of biologists interested in evolution, Cech said, because it is a
very simple process that could have operated in even the most
primitive organisms.
In higher animals, genes made up of DNA — deox
yribonucleic acid — carry a code that directs the production of
RNA. The RNA is spliced by enzymes, and then it, in turn,
directs the formation of the thousands of proteins that make up
living cells.
The discovery that RNA was rearranged and spliced was made
in the mid-19705. Scientists do not know for certain why splicing
occurs or exactly what its function is. "It could be part of some
central process that we don't know," said Sharp.
Cech was trying to understand that process when he stumbled
on the self-splicing RNA. In trying to determine what enzyme
spliced a particular strand of RNA in Tetrahymena, he purified
the RNA hoping to find a bit of the enzyme attached to it. After
the purification, there was no enzyme present.

the Federal Reserve.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials tumbled 18.49 to
1021.43, its biggest decline since it took a near-record drop of
36.33 points on Oct. 25.

Breshnev buried at Red Square
Moscow — Leonid Brezhnev, who ruled the Soviet Union for the past 18
years, was buried with military honors in Red Square yesterday as his suc
cessor pledged that the dead leader's "cause will be continued in the deeds of
our party and people."
With the sounds of bells, factory and ship sirens and artillery salutes ring
ing from Vladivostok on the Pacific Ocean to Kaliningrad on the Baltic Sea,
Brezhnev's body was lowered into the ground next to the grave of dictator
Joseph Stalin at 12.45 p.m. (4:45 a.m. EST).
Several of his close colleagues wept openly during the final moments of the
ceremony behind the Lenin Mausoleum as Brezhnev's wife, Viktoria, and
daughter, Galina, followed the ancient tradition of Russian orthodoxy by
kissing the dead leader's forehead and lips before the coffin was closed.
Yuri Andropov, who succeeded Brezhnev as Soviet Communist Party
leader, led other top officials to the gravesite to throw handfuls of earth into
the grave.
Numerous foreign representatives including more than 40 political leaders
watched the ceremony in what for Moscow was extraordinarily mild and dry
weather. Vice President George Bush led the American delegation, which
included Secretary of State George Shultz andMoscow Hartman.
Judge dismisses draft case
Los Angeles — U.S. District Judge Terry Hatter dismissed the govern
ment's case yesterday against a California man who refused to register for
the draft, finding that the government's prosecution of David Alan Wayte
was discriminatory.
Hatter found, in addition, that a 1980 presidential proclamation reviving
draft registration was invalid because it was put into effect sooner than per-

mitted by law.
The decision was hailed as "a big victory" by Wayte of nearby
Pasadena, who had contended that he and a handful of others
were singled out for prosecution because of their outspoken op
position to draft registration.
Wayte, the first person indicted in the Los Angeles area for
failing to register for a possible draft, said the dismissal was "a
serious setback to the Selective Service program."
Wavte's attornev, Mark Rosenbaum of the American Civil
Liberties Union, said the outcome was "a self-inflicted indict
ment of this administration — an administration which cowers
behind lies."
Hatter's decision came as little surprise. The government had
invited a dismissal on Nov. 5, when it refused to comply with two
of the judge's orders. The first required that the government give
the defense White House and Pentagon documents dealing with
development of prosecution policy in draft-registration cases.
The second directed Presidential Counselor Edwin Meese to ap
pear as a witness.
Walesa addresses foreign press
Gdansk — Celebrating his first full day of freedom, Lech
Walesa, the leader of Poland's outlawed Solidarity trade union,
yesterday said he was walking along a political tightrope.
Walesa told foreign correspondents in interviews at his home
here that, before his release Sunday, he had gotten a three-hour
lecture from officials at the prosecutor general's office in War
saw. He did not give details, but they presumably warned him
that, under martial-law regulations, he would face arrest if he at
tempted to conduct union activity.
Walesa, a one-time electrician who rose to world attention in
August 1980 when he led a strike of shipyard workers here that
ended with an agreement to set up independent trade unions,
said he was both surprised and "very suspicious" when he first
heard last Wednesday that he would be freed. Insisting that his
release had been unconditional, he said: "I signed nothing; I put
myself under no obligations; I joined nothing; I was simply re
leased."
Aside from putting on weight, Walesa appeared to have
changed little as a result of his 11 months in detention. In the 24
hours since his release, he has displayed the same canny political
sense and feeling for symbolic gestures that marked him out as a
leader in August 1980.
Bush, Andropov meet in Moscow
Moscow — U.S. Vice President George Bush and new Soviet
leader Yuri Andropov met for a half-hour after the Brezhnev fu
neral yesterday to discuss what both said was a desire to improve
relations between the superpowers.
Bush said afterward the talks were "frank, cordial and sub
stantive."
The Soviet news agency Tass said Andropov told Bush the
Kremlin was "prepared to build relations with the United States
on the basis of full equality, non-interference, mutual respect for
the interests of the peoples of both nations and the improvement
of the international situation."
The meeting came four hours after Andropov's predecessor as
Communist Party general secretary, Leonid Brezhnev, was given
a hero's burial in Red Square.
It was the highest-level U.S.-Soviet meeting since Brezhnev
signed the second strategic arms limitation treaty with then-Pres
ident Carter in June 1979. The Kremlin has cited the latter U.S.
failure to ratify that treaty as one major cause of tension between
the superpowers.
Since President Reagan took office in January 198\, East-
West relations also have worsened over Afghanistan, Poland, the
Middle East, and Central America, as well as the arms race.
Bush said he carried a message from Reagan for Andropov on
"the strong desire of the United States to work for an improved
relationship with the Soviet Union."
GOP governors question Reagan's policies
Kansas City, Mo. — Republican governors, their ranks
thinned by the Nov. 2 midterm election, turned on President
Reagan's representatives here yesterday and blamed their losses
on the nationwide unemployment problem and administration
policies that are "scaring people to death."
South Dakota Gov. William Janklow, a conservative Re
publican, used that phrase in arguing with White House pollster
Richard Wirthlin's claim that there is broad public support for
Reagan's policies and the Republican Party faces "no problem
that can't be solved by a 3 percent growth rate." <
The 19 Republican governors gathered here — almost a third
of whom will not be back in office next year — listed a dozen
other concerns, ranging from huge federal budget deficits, ex
cessive military spending and a general perception that "Re
publicans care only about the rich" to antagonism of minorities
and women, tolerance of narrow-focus, negative campaign
groups, and what Janklow called "screwball ideas" for changing
Social Security.
The public spanking of the administration by the Republican
governors marked a political turning point. For the past two
years, while some of them had grumbled privately about Rea
gan's spending priorities, they had strongly supported his efforts
to slow the growth of the federal budget, cut taxes and shift pro
grams back to the states.

Salvadoran guardsmen to face trial
San Salvador — A criminal court judge yesterday ordered five
national guardsmen to stand trial in the murder of four Ameri
can Roman Catholic churchwomen nearly two years ago.
Judge Bernardo Murcia, who conducted the nine-month
equivalent of a grand jurv probe here, ruled there is enough evi
dence for a trial against the guardsmen. Details of the indictment
have not been made public.
The case has added significance because of demands from the
Reagan administration that this and other cases of alleged gov
ernment brutality be stopped as a condition for continued U.S.
aid.
The United States is providing $238.5 million in economic aid
and $81 million in military assistance this year to help the gov
ernment fight a 3-vear-old insurrection by leftist guerrillas.
The three Roman Catholic nuns and a lay worker, who had
been working with Salvadoran peasants, were detained and shot
dead by a national guard patrol 30 miles outside the capital Dec.
4, 1980. Some showed signs of rape.
The bodies of nuns Ita Ford, 40, of Brooklyn, N.Y., and
Maura Clarke, 49, of Queens, N.Y.; Dorothy Dazel, 41, and lay
worker Jean Donovan, both of Cleveland, Ohio, were found by
then-American Ambassador Robert White. They had been hasti
ly buried in a shallow grave.
Allies assert continuation of trade talks
Paris — France and Britain declared yesterday that they will
continue negotiations with the United States on future Western
trade with the Soviet Union but said no concessions were made
to lead President Reagan to lift the U.S. embargo on Soviet natu
ral gas pipeline supplies.
"France is not a part of any deal," French President Francois
Mitterrand told reporters who talked with him at the opening of
an international food exhibition in Paris. "It was up to those who
imposed the embargo to lift it. It's as simple as thai. I have said
all along that it was not negotiable. Good sense has prevailed.
Finally, the embargo has been lifted."
But he said that Reagan's announcement Saturday that there
was agreement "in substance" on a plan to restrict strategic trade
with the Soviet Union "does not correspond to reality for
France."
In London, meanwhile, British Foreign Secretary Francis
Pym, interviewed on television before leaving for Moscow and
the funeral of Soviet President Leonid Brezhnev, said:
"There are no concessions. It was a unilateral decision by the
Americans to apply sanctions, so it was a unilateral decision to
end them. There has been agreement about the principles under
lying trade with Eastern Bloc countries. We ought not to trade in
a way that gives the Soviet Union some strategic or military ad
vantage, or subsidizes the Soviet economy. But this in no way
implies a trade war with the Soviet Union — I should be quite
against that."
Space shuttle landing scheduled
Edwards Air Force Base — Space shuttle Columbia headed for
a dawn landing in the California desert today, its crew elated
with the ship's milestone satellite deployments but deeply disap
pointed bv a canceled space walk.
With commander Vance Brand and pilot Robert Overmyer at
the controls, the shuttle's big engines were to be fired high above
the Indian Ocean to start the spacecraft on an hour-long descent
to a touchdown on a concrete runway at Edwards Air Force
B~s~.
Landing was set for 6:34 a.m. PST, eight minutes after sunrise.
"We look forward to seeing you," Brand told capsule com
municator Michael Coats before the astronauts retired last
night.
Columbia and its men — Brand, Overmyer, William Lenoir
and Joseph Allen — are returning in triumph despite the can
cellation of the space walk, derailed by technical faults in
NASA's new $2 million space suits.
The scrubbing of the dual excursion into the open cargo bay by
Lenoir and Allen, coming yesterday on the last full day of the
five-dav flight, overshadowed earlier accomplishments in which
the ship released its first two commercial satellites into orbit and
qualifed as an operational space transportation system.
That was the major goal, and it was executed flawlessly on the
first two days. The space walk was a secondary, but important,
objective. The failure to carry it out has cast some doubt on the
reliability of the suits and what effect this might have on future
shuttle missions where space walks will be mandatory. Within
two or three years they are to be routine.
Supreme court stiffens immigration
Washington — The Supreme Court eased the way yesterday
for U.S. immigration officials to bar aliens from returning to the
United States if they engage in conduct considered illegal or im
proper during trips abroad.
Overturning a lower court decision, the justices ruled that legal
aliens may be kept at borders or airports for possible exclusion
from the United States and need not be given the lengthier and
more elaborate protections of the deportation process.
The ruling came in the case of Maria Plasencia, an El
Salvadoran woman who was a permanent resident alien in Los
Angeles from 1970 to 1975. She was found to be smuggling illegal
aliens into the United States when she tried to return from a brief
trip to Tijuana, Mexico.

Ihe decision gives immigration officials power to apply
against legal aliens returning to the United States many of the
same broad powers of exclusion they have always wielded over
aliens trying to enter the United States for the first time.
Under federal law, aliens engaging in criminal conduct like
smuggling may be excluded from the United States. So may drug
addicts, chronic alcoholics, paupers, professional beggars,
stowaways, anarchists, Nazi collaborators, prostitutes, sexual
deviants, persons who engage in or advocate polygamy and per
sons likely to become public charges.
I he new ruling applies to any resident alien who leaves the
United States for the purpose of engaging in the sort of activity
for which he could have been excluded in the first place. A 1963
Supreme Court decision protects legal aliens from being barred
from returning alter an "innocent, casual and brief excursion,"
such as a shopping trip across the border.
NFL strike settlement narrowly aborted
New York — A settlement was reported near last night by a go
between in negotiations to end the National Football League
strike. The players' chief negotiator, however, said the owners
had reneged on parts of their offer and "there is not a deal that is
even close."
And Jim Miller, a spokesman for the owners, also said the two
sides remained far apart.
The conflicting reports came as the league announced a cont
ingency plan to resume the season this weekend.
Talks resumed unexpectedly earlier Monday after the NFL
Players Association suffered a setback in efforts to have the
owners cited for bad-faith bargaining.
"Sometime this evening we should have an all-inclusive agree
ment," said Paul Martha, a former NFL running back and law
yer who was acting as an unofficial mediator,
"It is mainly a question of money," he said. "Five or six items
remain to be negotiated. We have a long night of bargaining
ahead."
Even as Martha was talking, however, union chief Ed Garvey
was accusing the owners of "union-busting" and pulling back
portions of their latest contract offer.
"We thought last night that maybe we were getting close, but
those forces in the Management Council who want to defeat the
union apparently prevailed again," Garvey said. "I think they
were hoping the union would say, 4 We can't get there, so let's give
up."
Researchers discover self-splicing gene
New York — Researchers said yesterday they have discovered
genetic material that can rearrange itself without the help of
enzymes, a much simpler process than scientists had thought
possible.
"The discovery is so novel that one doesn't know the full im
plications, but it will certainly change the way we discuss things,"
said Phillip Sharp, a biologist at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology.
The researchers at the University of Colorado in Boulder, led
by the biochemist Thomas Cech, found what they call "self-splic
ing RNA" in a single-celled animal called Tetrahymenathat lives
in ponds.
Ribonucleic acid, one of the complex chemicals that carries ge
netic information, is normally cut, rearranged and spliced to
gether bv enzymes, proteins made for that purpose.
The research will be published today in the journal Cell.
The discovery of self-splicing RNA has attracted the attention
of biologists interested in evolution, Cech said, because it is a
very simple process that could have operated in even the most
primitive organisms.
In higher animals, genes made up of DNA — deox
yribonucleic acid — carry a code that directs the production of
RNA. The RNA is spliced by enzymes, and then it, in turn,
directs the formation of the thousands of proteins that make up
living cells.
The discovery that RNA was rearranged and spliced was made
in the mid-19705. Scientists do not know for certain why splicing
occurs or exactly what its function is. "It could be part of some
central process that we don't know," said Sharp.
Cech was trying to understand that process when he stumbled
on the self-splicing RNA. In trying to determine what enzyme
spliced a particular strand of RNA in Tetrahymena, he purified
the RNA hoping to find a bit of the enzyme attached to it. After
the purification, there was no enzyme present.
