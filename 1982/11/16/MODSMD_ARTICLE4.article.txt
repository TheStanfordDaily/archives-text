Breshnev buried at Red Square
Moscow — Leonid Brezhnev, who ruled the Soviet Union for the past 18
years, was buried with military honors in Red Square yesterday as his suc
cessor pledged that the dead leader's "cause will be continued in the deeds of
our party and people."
With the sounds of bells, factory and ship sirens and artillery salutes ring
ing from Vladivostok on the Pacific Ocean to Kaliningrad on the Baltic Sea,
Brezhnev's body was lowered into the ground next to the grave of dictator
Joseph Stalin at 12.45 p.m. (4:45 a.m. EST).
Several of his close colleagues wept openly during the final moments of the
ceremony behind the Lenin Mausoleum as Brezhnev's wife, Viktoria, and
daughter, Galina, followed the ancient tradition of Russian orthodoxy by
kissing the dead leader's forehead and lips before the coffin was closed.
Yuri Andropov, who succeeded Brezhnev as Soviet Communist Party
leader, led other top officials to the gravesite to throw handfuls of earth into
the grave.
Numerous foreign representatives including more than 40 political leaders
watched the ceremony in what for Moscow was extraordinarily mild and dry
weather. Vice President George Bush led the American delegation, which
included Secretary of State George Shultz andMoscow Hartman.
Judge dismisses draft case
Los Angeles — U.S. District Judge Terry Hatter dismissed the govern
ment's case yesterday against a California man who refused to register for
the draft, finding that the government's prosecution of David Alan Wayte
was discriminatory.
Hatter found, in addition, that a 1980 presidential proclamation reviving
draft registration was invalid because it was put into effect sooner than per-

mitted by law.
