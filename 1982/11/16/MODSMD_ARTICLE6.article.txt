# Suspect: no knowledge of slaying

### SID ATKINS Staff writer 
Donald Amos, the prime suspect in
last month's slaying of Stanford Junior
Angela Arvidson claims he knows noth
ing about the crime, according to Stan
ford Police Chief Marvin Herrington.
"Right now he's not admitting to
anything," Herrington said. "They'll
keep questioning him if he says he's
willing to talk, but I'll be suprised if he
does."
Amos is being detained on a no-bail
warrant in connection with the October
22 stabbing of the 20-year-old
Arvidson. She was murdered in the
campus home of Laurence Kedes, an
associate Medical School professor,
where she was working as a house
keeper and discovered when the fami
ly's 16-year old son returned from
school.
Over the past three weeks, police
have conducted stake-outs, distributed
flyers and issued an all-points bulletin
nationally in efforts to apprehend
Amos, a deliveryman linked to the
crime because a receipt was found in the
driveway of the Kedes home. On Sun
day, Amos gave himself up by walking
into the Santa Clara County Jail and
declaring, "I understand you guys are
looking for me."
Amos was scheduled to be arraigned
yesterday in Palo Alto Municipal
Court, but the judge postponed the
hearing until Friday, after Amos re
quested that a public defender be pro
vided on his behalf. Herrington said
that until the time of yesterday's ar
raignment, Amos insisted he did not
need any counsel.
Lieutenant Ron Conway of the Santa
Clara County Sheriffs Department
said that police have taken blood and
fingerprints from Amos and are conti
nuing to take steps to place him at the
scene of the crime. But he withheld in
formation gained from questioning.
"The district attorney is very ada
mant that no information of this type
get out before the trial," Conway said.
Amos is being held without bail, al
though bail could still be set at a later
hearing. Because Amos has requested a
public defender and turned himself in,
indicating indigence, there is little like
lihood that he will even attempt to post
bail, Conway said.
Herrington said this will probably be
a capital case, meaning Amos will have
to plead 'not guilty' and could face the
death penalty if convicted.
"In a capital case, defendants aren't
allowed to plead guilty, because then
you could have innocent people being
put to death by the system," Herrington
explained. He added that at the pre
liminary hearing, Amos' defense will
probably argue against the nature of the
charge, seeking reduction from first
degree murder.
Although Amos could be given the
death penalty, Herrington said he
would not speculate on this now be
cause anv sentencing "is still a long way
off."
Both Herrington and Conway said
they were relieved to have Amos behind
bars. "Now that he's incarcerated, we
can get to the development of a case
against him, instead of worrying about
catching him," Herrington said.
