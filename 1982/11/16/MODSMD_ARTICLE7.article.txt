The Lebanese most fear a scenario of
indefinite Israeli occupation of their
country, according to Lebanese jour
nalist Hisham Milhelm who spoke last
night at a forum sponsored by the
ASSU Speakers Bureau.
Milhelm, who isa Washington-based
correspondent for a Saudi newspaper,
said Israel aims "to incorporate the
economy of Southern Lebanon into
their own market." He explained that
"the Israelis have always wanted to get
water in Southern Lebanon."
Milhelm stressed the importance of
strengthening the fragmented Lebanese
government in dealing with Israeli oc
cupation. He said "all the recent de
velopments present the Lebanese peo
ple with the historical opportunity to
reunify the country by creating a na
tional coalition to deal with Israel." He
suggested that Lebanon establish a uni
fied nationalist army and call for the
withdrawal of Israel and Syria from
its land.
During questioning Milhelm said
"Personally I doubt if an Israeli

withdrawal can be secured politically
the only option is to fight them, then
why not?"
Milhelm added he thought Lebanon
might be the staging ground for a war of
attrition. "The Lebanese people would
be willing to sacrifice if the Lebanese
government would take the lead," he
said. But Milhelm suggested that many
Lebanese citizens think President Amin
Gemayel doesn't even have the support
of the Lebanese army.
"I think I am speaking for most Leb
anese of my generation when I say I will
not live with the Israelis and accept the
dichotomy of the occupier and the oc
cupied."
The speaker spent much of his speech
describing the historical background of
Lebanon to the group of 50 people who
attended the disussion. "Lebanon is a
mosaic of cultural diversity," he said.
Unfortunately the governmental sys
tem has not succeeded in creating a uni
fied Lebanese identity, according to
Milhelm. He said he thought the gov
ernment should be based on cultural
pluralism and democracy.
