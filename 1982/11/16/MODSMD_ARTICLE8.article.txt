## Rebholz: students too apathetic 
### KAREN ADAMS 
As a 21-vear member of the Stanford English
Department, the 1980 recipient of the
Dinkelspiel award for distinguished contribu
tions to undergraduate education and a former
president of the American Association of Uni
versity Professors, English Prof. Ronald
Rebholz has earned the right to pass judgment
on Stanford students. University policy and
academe in general. And he does.
In an interview, Rebholz, resident fellow at
Trancos, expressed dismav and disappointment
at Stanford students for being apathetic about
events that will affect them directly. "There is
something too narrow about students that they
are unwilling to inform themselves of issues that
have a direct bearing on their lives," he said.
"During the United Stanford Workers Strike,
the resident fellow of Madera and I got our RAs
to distribute 1000 leaflets on the doors and din
ing room tables advertising a talk by the chief ne
gotiator of the union and 23 students turned up.
One thousand leaflets, 23 students. That seems
to me to be either indifference or apathy about
something that affected students' lives directly
Rebholz' second example of student apathy
dealt with senior Doug Dietrich, who organized
a SWOPSI course on nuclearenergy and nuclear
warfare with a focus on the Bay Area and lined
up a series of recognized speakers, only to have
no one enroll in the course.
Rebholz attributes such apathy primarily to
the egocentricitv of this generation, but feels that
people are wrongly convinced that they have lit
tle influence. He sees the only solution to this
problem in forcing people to think about some
thing other than themselves by bombarding
them with publicity and events.
In addition to encountering indifference
among students, Rebholz has found that it is
hard to change the way people think.
The prime mover behind the effort to institute
the Western Culture requirement in 1977,
Rebholz has had his share of dead-ends and
compromises. Currently the coordinator of the
Great Works track, he said, "We wanted the
Great Works model to prevail over the entire
University, and we were shot down. I still think
it would have been better if everyone were taking
the same course."
He also said the University would operate
more efficiently and beneficially if the distribu
tion requirements were increased, if the quarter
system were abolished and if the grading system
were drastically altered.
According to Rebholz, the seven areas of the
distribution requirements are in need of ex
pansion. He explained, "If the purpose of the re
quirements is to expose students to the way in
which people of different disciplines think, then
one quarter is simply not enough."
Rebholz also criticized the quarter system,
saying, "It is virtually impossible to write
lengthy essays based on serious study and
careful reflection within the limits of a quarter."
He is encouraged bv the fact that a Stanford
committee is currently considering the merits of
following UC-Berkelev in returning to the se
mester system, but he foresees two major ob
stacles. First, "Berkeley is switching back to a

system that lives vividly in their minds since
they've only been on quarters since 1967, where
as we've been on the quarter system for as long
as anybody around here can remember. So there
is a kind of psychological bias against a revolu
tionary move of the calendar."
Furthermore, Rebholz recognizes that some
disciplines, such as engineering, are better ac
comodated by quarters, while others, especially
the humanities, operate more efficiently on se
mesters. Even so, he said, "We humanists cer
tainly feel that it's time we had a calendar that
accomodates our disciplines."
Thus, Rebholz is intrigued by an alternative to
both the quarter and semester plans — the
Golub system, comprised of six, five-week seg
ments and named after Gene Golub, professor
of computer science here, who suggested the
idea. Rebholz sees in Golubs the potential for
"incredible flexibility," because humanities
could offer three Golub courses while engineer
ing could offer courses for one or two Golubs.
Next on Rebholz' list of the ills of academe:
grading. First of all, he said, "I don't think
grades are all that inflated. Stanford students
work bv and large very hard and in most cases I
think they're up to 'A' or 4 B' work.
"More important, I don't liketheentire meth
od of grading. I think that teaching and learning
are cooperative acts and it's an awful thing as a
teacher to change from cooperative investigator
of the truth to judge at the end of the quarter or
semester or Golub. It contaminates in the stu
dent's mind the idea that the teacher is a fellow
learner."
As a former Rhodes Scholar, Rebholz ad
mires the British system of grading, which in
volves people who are external examiners. "That
system enables the integrity of the relationship
between student and teacher to continue and it's
not an impossible system to achieve either," he
said.
Even so, Rebholz is aware of the obstacles
that must be overcome to effect a revolutionary
change: "Nobody here has thought about se
mesters or Golubs, so it's very hard to get them
to do it. Likewise, no one has considered ex
ternal examiners so it will be next to impossible
to get them to budge."

to distribute 1000 leaflets on the doors and din
ing room tables advertising a talk by the chief ne
gotiator of the union and 23 students turned up.
One thousand leaflets, 23 students. That seems
to me to be either indifference or apathy about
something that affected students' lives directly
Rebholz' second example of student apathy
dealt with senior Doug Dietrich, who organized
a SWOPSI course on nuclearenergy and nuclear
warfare with a focus on the Bay Area and lined
up a series of recognized speakers, only to have
no one enroll in the course.
Rebholz attributes such apathy primarily to
the egocentricitv of this generation, but feels that
people are wrongly convinced that they have lit
tle influence. He sees the only solution to this
problem in forcing people to think about some
thing other than themselves by bombarding
them with publicity and events.
In addition to encountering indifference
among students, Rebholz has found that it is
hard to change the way people think.
The prime mover behind the effort to institute
the Western Culture requirement in 1977,
Rebholz has had his share of dead-ends and
compromises. Currently the coordinator of the
Great Works track, he said, "We wanted the
Great Works model to prevail over the entire
University, and we were shot down. I still think
it would have been better if everyone were taking
the same course."
He also said the University would operate
more efficiently and beneficially if the distribu
tion requirements were increased, if the quarter
system were abolished and if the grading system
were drastically altered.
According to Rebholz, the seven areas of the
distribution requirements are in need of ex
pansion. He explained, "If the purpose of the re
quirements is to expose students to the way in
which people of different disciplines think, then
one quarter is simply not enough."
Rebholz also criticized the quarter system,
saying, "It is virtually impossible to write
lengthy essays based on serious study and
careful reflection within the limits of a quarter."
He is encouraged bv the fact that a Stanford
committee is currently considering the merits of
following UC-Berkelev in returning to the se
mester system, but he foresees two major ob
stacles. First, "Berkeley is switching back to a

system that lives vividly in their minds since
they've only been on quarters since 1967, where
as we've been on the quarter system for as long
as anybody around here can remember. So there
is a kind of psychological bias against a revolu
tionary move of the calendar."
Furthermore, Rebholz recognizes that some
disciplines, such as engineering, are better ac
comodated by quarters, while others, especially
the humanities, operate more efficiently on se
mesters. Even so, he said, "We humanists cer
tainly feel that it's time we had a calendar that
accomodates our disciplines."
Thus, Rebholz is intrigued by an alternative to
both the quarter and semester plans — the
Golub system, comprised of six, five-week seg
ments and named after Gene Golub, professor
of computer science here, who suggested the
idea. Rebholz sees in Golubs the potential for
"incredible flexibility," because humanities
could offer three Golub courses while engineer
ing could offer courses for one or two Golubs.
Next on Rebholz' list of the ills of academe:
grading. First of all, he said, "I don't think
grades are all that inflated. Stanford students
work bv and large very hard and in most cases I
think they're up to 'A' or 4 B' work.
"More important, I don't liketheentire meth
od of grading. I think that teaching and learning
are cooperative acts and it's an awful thing as a
teacher to change from cooperative investigator
of the truth to judge at the end of the quarter or
semester or Golub. It contaminates in the stu
dent's mind the idea that the teacher is a fellow
learner."
As a former Rhodes Scholar, Rebholz ad
mires the British system of grading, which in
volves people who are external examiners. "That
system enables the integrity of the relationship
between student and teacher to continue and it's
not an impossible system to achieve either," he
said.
Even so, Rebholz is aware of the obstacles
that must be overcome to effect a revolutionary
change: "Nobody here has thought about se
mesters or Golubs, so it's very hard to get them
to do it. Likewise, no one has considered ex
ternal examiners so it will be next to impossible
to get them to budge."

at Stanford students for being apathetic about
events that will affect them directly. "There is
something too narrow about students that they
are unwilling to inform themselves of issues that
have a direct bearing on their lives," he said.
