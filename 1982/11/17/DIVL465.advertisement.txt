You've never
seen anything
like it. . .
A nocturnal animal, it
; has seven terminal
arms and occasionally
short hands, goes to
bed late five nights a
week, writes heads, v
lays pages, makes
adlines, deadlines,
cutlines and pics, eats
pizza at night and
sometimes its own
words. It's the Dally,
your newspaper.
You could love It!
CANCER
CAN BE BEAT.
Otto Graham,
one of football's
greatest
quarterbacks, has
made a successful
comeback: from
colorectal cancer.
And today, he's
feeling good enough
to keep working full
time as Athletic
Director of the
Coast Guard
Academy. Your
donations have
helped fund the
research and
advances in
treatment necessary
â€¢ for a recovery like
Otto Graham's.
And the recovery of
almost 2 million
others who are
living proof that
your contributions
count.
