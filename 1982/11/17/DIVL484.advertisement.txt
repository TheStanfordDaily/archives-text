The best...it's not enough. Not for you. There's no question about
your standards—you're at Stanford! Because we share your
impeccable standards, we'll be at Stanford, too. On November 18.
Looking for you.
Now you'll have an opportunity to learn in a brief, yet impactive
noontime session how Pacific Telephone is gearing up to meet
perhaps the greatest challenges ever experienced in the history
of telecommunications! Sam Ginn, Pacific Telephone's Executive
VP—Strategic Planning Officer, will tell you about some of the
changes occurring within the Company—and about the incredible
career opportunities that exist for you. And who better than
Sam Ginn? Formerly a Stanford Sloan Fellow and now a Sloan
Foundation Advisory Board Member, he's a person you can
relate to!
So, if meeting challenges is a way of life for you—if you enjoy
pressing to the limits of your potential, then we have something
in common, and we're prepared not only to recognize your
talents, but to reward them handsomely.
We look forward to meeting you at our Brown Bag Lunch on
Thursday, November 18,1982 at noon in Room 62 at the
Stanford Business School. And while you're marking your
calendar, note that on-campus interviews will be conducted for
MBA students on December 6,1982.
