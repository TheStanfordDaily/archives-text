# Crowd hails fifth shuttle landing
## 
### JAY FRAMSON 
Edwards Air Force Base, Calif. —
Roy Stowers stood in front of his
trailer in the predawn cold looking
off at the runway in the distance
where in a few minutes the Colum
bia space shuttle would land.
"You'll hear the sonic booms
come in — crack-crack — and then
vou look overth. re,"he explained,
pointing to the hills where the shut
lie would make its lo6p.
Stowers was one of an estimated
crowd 0f75,0(R) who at about 6 a.m.
vcsicrday were waiting here at Ed
waids Air Force Base to catch a
glimpse of the shuttle as it broke
through the atmosphere and glided
to earth.
It was the Columbia's fifth land
ing since the shuttle flight program
began in April 1981. An estimated
750.0<X) people — 10 times yester
day's turnout — accompanied the
shuttle's fourth landing ori July 4.
Ihe early time and the fact that
Tuesday is a workig dav may have
u«vtt4rit>L>ie<J *l» -Ww relatively low

turnout, according to NASA of
ficials, who speculated that for many
the shuttle may be becoming rou
tine.
But for the hard-core enthusiasts
»vho showed up yesterday, the shut
lie landing wasanything but routine.
People continued to arrive all
through the night in vehicles bearing
licen:plates from places like Ore
gon, Washington, Alberta and Illi
nois. Some slept in their cars, tents
or trailers while others huddled
around campfires to ward off the
near-freezing cold. Makeshift stands
dispensing food and shuttle
souvenirs stayed open all through
the night.
"It's a thrill," explained Stowers,
standing in front of his trailer. A
camera mounted on a tripod stood
ready behind him.
As it became lighter, people began
to set themselves up with blankets,
chairs, telescopes, cameras or what
ever they were able to bring with
iheni. One group had breakfast
spread out an a blanket; another

gathered around a four-foot tele
scope.
Then suddenly at 6:26 a.m. came
the staccato booms, like thunder
claps, as the shuttle crossed over the
California coast. About a minute
later a tiny grev speck could be seen,
and people clapped and cheered. In
moments the shuttle was descend
ing, and it glowed orange as it re
flected the sun which had just risen.
As the shuttle glided in for the land
ing. the crowd grew silent and then,
when it was clear it had landed, ev
eryone applauded.
"Yes sir, we deliver," commander
Vance Brand radioed the mission
operations control center in Hous
ton as the shuttle came to a halt.
"It's nice to be back."
Once again the landing had gone
off without a hitch. The show over,
the crowd began to disperse — may
be already thinking about
Challenger, the next shuttle, sched
uled to be launched in January or
February 1083.
