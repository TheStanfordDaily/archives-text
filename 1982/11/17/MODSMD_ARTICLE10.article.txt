## Child specialist warns of rushed childhood 
### LIBBY LEONARD 
Twelve-year-old Sara, wearing snug de
signer jeans and make-up, prepares breakfast
for her kid brother dailv while her mother
scurries off to work. Sara is a hypothetical ex
ample of the hurried child of the '80s — one
who is being forced to grow up too quickly.
"Many young people today are deprived of
their childhoods," Dr. David Elkind told a
large group of concerned parents and
educators during a brief campus visit last
week, sponsored bv the local Bing School.
Elkind is a child psychologist and chair
man of the Eliot-Pearson Department of
Child Study at Tufts University. He has
gained national recognition as a lecturer and
author of numerous publications on develop
mental psychology. In his most recent book.
The Hurried Child, Elkind addresses the
harmful effects of rushing children into
adulthood.
Elkind insists that children need time to
grown, to learn and to develop at their own
pace. "This is a theme we often forget in our
hurried society," he said. Today's child-rear
ing tactics seem to reflect the modern belief
that earlier is better. As a result, children are
encouraged "to take on the physical, psy
chological and social trappings of adulthood
before they are ready to do so," Elkind wrote.
Stanford students may very well be unin-'
tended victims of this hurrying phenomenon.
"Many students may not be enjoying them
selves as much, because they have led narrow,
rushed lives focusing on achievement," com
mented Elkind. "Some may have remorse lat
er on, because they missed out on some parts
of their childhoods," he added.
In recent years, it has become harder for
parents to recognize and treat children as
children, instead of miniature adults, main
tains Elkind. "We've taken away some of the
traditional markers of growing up," he said.
Clothing, for instance, used to be an in
dicator of age. Now, however, many children
are dressed in scaled-down adult garb. "Even
preschoolers look like preppies," Elkind
joked.
When children dress like adults, it's not
surprising they try to imitate grown-ups by
adopting adult language and behavior. Al
though these children, especially young teens,
may look and talk like adults, rarely do they
feel like adults, Elkind noted. Unfortunately,
parents can easily be deceived; a child's dis
play of maturity is often mistaken for true
maturity.
School-age children and teenagers are
often fooled about their own maturity level,
too. Children want to think of themselves <ts'
adults. A 16-year-old girl once told Elkind,
"I've done everything. The only thing I have
left is marriage."
Elkind is disturbed that activities once re
served for older people are being pushed
down to younger age groups. Kindergartners
are now introduced to stressing adult com
petition through organized sports. Many
children, Elkind contends, are forced to com
pete to fulfill a parent's desire, rather than the

child's. Concerned with pleasing their pa
rents. children may feel great pressure to ex
cel. Elkin believes "parents should allow chil
dren to play for plav's sake and to experience
the freedom of making their own rules."
Schedules monopolized with team practices
leave little time for childhood fun and games.
Parents who spoon fed toddlers with ad
vanced learning materials also hurry chil
dren. If a child shows no interest in reading at
age three, he should not be pressed to do so.
Hlkind recommends. Admittance to high
caliber nurserv schools has become very com
petitive in the last decade. Consequently, pre
schoolers "are burdened with the expecta
tions and anxieties normally reserved for high
school seniors,"Hlkind reported.

Forced blooming is also related to today's
changing family structure, Elkind claims.
Modern children have to adjust to single-pa
rent homes and working parents. Today more
mothers work than ever before. About one
third of the mothers of young children are
employed outside the home, according to
Elkind's findings. For working parents, "the
temptation to pile heavy domestic burdens on
the child is strong," he stated.
The spoiled, pampered child of the 1950s is
being replaced by a more independent, self
sufficient breed. Todav's child is taught to
fend for himself, which can be too much to
ask of a young person. Distinguishing what
demands are reasonable from what are not, is
not an easy task for parents, according to
Elkind. "Helping parents is one thing; taking
over their jobs is another," he wrote.
Hurried children may seem eager to as
sume adult responsibilities, yet they really do
resent the pressures which accompany these
duties,. Elkin observed. Frustration is often
disguised in order to maintain a grown-up im

ape. This deep-seated anger tends to surface
during adolescence, howevdr.
"Adolescents pay us back in their teen
years for all the sins, real or imagined, we
committed when they were children," Elkind
said. "We're beginning to see older teenagers
trving to recapture their childhoods, because
they feel they missed something," he added.
Parents are not the only hurrying agents.
Elkins also blames the media — especially
commercial television. Influenced by eco
nomics, television producers are pressed to
please the 18- to 49-year-old audience and, as
a result, children often watch shows geared
for adults.
These programs hurry young people "be
cause they expose them to the issues and con
flicts of grown-ups," Elkind noted.
Fantasy and fairytales have almost van
ished from the screen; children today are
bombarded with realism. Society falsely be
lieves "that the best way to prepare children
for a rough world is to expose them to it ear
ly," Elkind said. He insists that "striking a
balance between good fantasy and good re
alism is important."
Eklind believes many schools add to the
problem of hurrying. "Schools tends to stere
otype children and impose false expectancies
upon them," he stated. Elkin opposes the new
entrance age requirement which 'allows four
year-olds in kindergarten. He is also critical
of grade school sex education programs
which "present information
for this age."
Pressures to grow up fast influence children
in different ways. A rapid increase in drug use
and sexual activity among youths in the last
10 to 15 years is one effect of hurrying, ac
cording to Elkind. The expert child psy
chologist also believes that soaring suicide
rates in teens are related to rushed child
hoods.
In addition, incidences of stress diseases
are appearing in younger children, which
Elkind attributes, in part, to parental pres
sure for achievement. One of Elkind's col
leagues reported that 50 percent of his four to
seven-year-old patients suffered from psy
chosomatic symptoms of stress such as head
aches, stomach aches, allergic reactions and
high cholesterol levels.
Contemporary society has placed children
on a stage; they are given adult costumes and
cast in adult roles. Elkind applauds parents
and teachers who realize these young people
are only play-acting. Adults need "to see how
children view the world from inside," he said.
Bv taking time to communicate and to show
effective support, adults can help children re
lax and "develop a good sense of themselves
as people," he advised. Elkind's unique book
include other suggestions to help slacken the
load of today's rushed child.
Although parents cannot shield children
from all of society's hurrying messages, "they
can provide an oasis," Elkind commented.
Proceeds from Elkind's lecture benefit the
Birig School, which will sponsor a scriei of
similar lectures throughout the year.
