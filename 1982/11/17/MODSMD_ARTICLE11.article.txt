# Pub Board provides the funding for campus' small publications
## 
### KAREN SPRINGEN 
Readers remember Up
Front, the magazine that fea
tured cocaine on its cover and
the now-defunct Inside Stan
ford, which featured a sex sur
vey. But many lesser-known
publications, such as Real
News, also have reached the
University community.
All publications are equally ■
eligible for Publications
Board funding. The Pub
Board, the common forum for
all publications here, consists
of representatives from 17
publications. It allocates fee
assessment funds without re
gard to editorial content,
Chairman Doug Fine said. "If
there's a Stanford publica
tion, it can become a member
. . . We make them a member
if we determine they really in
tend to publish."
Allocations are based on
"financial need relative to
other publications' financial
need," Fine said. "As a publi
cation becomes older, we like
to give less," he added. Publi
cations are expected to find
other sources of revenue —
and generally they do. "Most
of them (publications) stay
around for quite awhile," he
added.
But what publications have
been popular? Up Front, a
slick magazine first published
iast spring, capitalized on the
selling power of drug-related
articles by publishing an in
depth feature on cocaine use
here. The result: good sales
and a magazine that will be
published twice this year. "It's
going to be some of the
same," said Tina Essey, co
editor of Up Front.
Stanford Interview (which
will debut tomorrow) seems
to be banking on the idea that
glossy pictures and cover
stories on sex, drugs and
good-looking athletes are
most well-read. Interview, ap
parently intended to be Stan
ford's answer to People, will
feature a cover story on ath
letes Ceci Hopp and Michael
Heiss. "By putting both these
well-known, rather good
looking people on campus on
the cover, We'll get people to
ffick IV Up," co-cdftor Brett

Love said.
Fine said publications start
up because students sec a need
that is not being filled by other
publications. Interview was
designed to fill one such void.
"We felt there were a lot of
small publications on campus
that did not reach a very large
audience," Love said.
The Pub Board receives a
three-quarter fee assessment.
Members include the Daily,
The Chaparral, The ASSU
Course Guide. Aurora (a
feminist newspaper), Dial
Tone, Draft Time, Imani, Real
Mews, Sequoia, The Independ
ent, Up Front, Stanford In
terview, The Tabloid, The
Stanford Progressive, La Onda
and The Quad. Not all these
groups receive Pub Board
funds.

Part of the reason the
ASSU granted a three-quarter
assessment to the Pub Board
was that one-half of one-quar
ter's assessment has been set
aside for the Independent with
the same amount going to the
ASSU Course Guide. This was
"instead of the Independent
asking tor its own fee
assessment," Fine said.
"If they (the Independent or
the Course Guide) need it, they
will get $4500," Fine said, es
timating that the Pub Board
would receive about $9000 af
ter fee assessment refunds.
The ASSU Course Guide
generally runs a deficit, which
the ASSU financed in the
past, senator Jim McGrath
said: "It was costing $3000 a

year," he said. So the ASSU
wanted the Course Guide un
der the Pub Board.
By contrast, other publica
tions receive a maximum of
$550, Fine said. Publications
receiving between $450 and
$550 include Sequoia, Up
Front, Interview and Dial
Tone.
Other publications, such as
the new Stanford Progressive,
published by the Stanford
Progressive Alliance (SPA),
receive less. Senior Karen Al
len, SPA representative, said
the Pub Board allocated $297
to the Progressive. The group
followed standard procedure,
she said, asking for 50 percent
of its cost. Like other groups,
they received 50 percent mi
nus 10 percent.

Next year the Pub Board
will be covered in the associa
tion fee. Beginning this
spring, the association fee will
be levied like a fee assessment
but the ASSU will determine
its amount. The senate can in
crease or decrease the fee
based on the demand for al
locations that year, McGrath
said. He predicted an increase
in Pub Board allocations.
The association fee pro
vides a more secure source of
funding, McGrath said. "If
you defeat the thing, that
means all publications* will be
hurting." The senate ultimate
ly approves Pub Board rec
ommendations because
"there has to be some popular
ballot check,"- McGrath said'

The Pub Board receives a
three-quarter fee assessment.
Members include the Daily,
The Chaparral, The ASSU
Course Guide. Aurora (a
feminist newspaper), Dial
Tone, Draft Time, Imani, Real
Mews, Sequoia, The Independ
ent, Up Front, Stanford In
terview, The Tabloid, The
Stanford Progressive, La Onda
and The Quad. Not all these
groups receive Pub Board
funds.

Part of the reason the
ASSU granted a three-quarter
assessment to the Pub Board
was that one-half of one-quar
ter's assessment has been set
aside for the Independent with
the same amount going to the
ASSU Course Guide. This was
"instead of the Independent
asking tor its own fee
assessment," Fine said.
"If they (the Independent or
the Course Guide) need it, they
will get $4500," Fine said, es
timating that the Pub Board
would receive about $9000 af
ter fee assessment refunds.
The ASSU Course Guide
generally runs a deficit, which
the ASSU financed in the
past, senator Jim McGrath
said: "It was costing $3000 a

year," he said. So the ASSU
wanted the Course Guide un
der the Pub Board.
By contrast, other publica
tions receive a maximum of
$550, Fine said. Publications
receiving between $450 and
$550 include Sequoia, Up
Front, Interview and Dial
Tone.
Other publications, such as
the new Stanford Progressive,
published by the Stanford
Progressive Alliance (SPA),
receive less. Senior Karen Al
len, SPA representative, said
the Pub Board allocated $297
to the Progressive. The group
followed standard procedure,
she said, asking for 50 percent
of its cost. Like other groups,
they received 50 percent mi
nus 10 percent.

Next year the Pub Board
will be covered in the associa
tion fee. Beginning this
spring, the association fee will
be levied like a fee assessment
but the ASSU will determine
its amount. The senate can in
crease or decrease the fee
based on the demand for al
locations that year, McGrath
said. He predicted an increase
in Pub Board allocations.
The association fee pro
vides a more secure source of
funding, McGrath said. "If
you defeat the thing, that
means all publications* will be
hurting." The senate ultimate
ly approves Pub Board rec
ommendations because
"there has to be some popular
ballot check,"- McGrath said'

Readers remember Up
Front, the magazine that fea
tured cocaine on its cover and
the now-defunct Inside Stan
ford, which featured a sex sur
vey. But many lesser-known
publications, such as Real
News, also have reached the
University community.
All publications are equally ■
eligible for Publications
Board funding. The Pub
Board, the common forum for
all publications here, consists
of representatives from 17
publications. It allocates fee
assessment funds without re
gard to editorial content,
Chairman Doug Fine said. "If
there's a Stanford publica
tion, it can become a member
. . . We make them a member
if we determine they really in
tend to publish."
Allocations are based on
"financial need relative to
other publications' financial
need," Fine said. "As a publi
cation becomes older, we like
to give less," he added. Publi
cations are expected to find
other sources of revenue —
and generally they do. "Most
of them (publications) stay
around for quite awhile," he
added.
But what publications have
been popular? Up Front, a
slick magazine first published
iast spring, capitalized on the
selling power of drug-related
articles by publishing an in
depth feature on cocaine use
here. The result: good sales
and a magazine that will be
published twice this year. "It's
going to be some of the
same," said Tina Essey, co
editor of Up Front.
Stanford Interview (which
will debut tomorrow) seems
to be banking on the idea that
glossy pictures and cover
stories on sex, drugs and
good-looking athletes are
most well-read. Interview, ap
parently intended to be Stan
ford's answer to People, will
feature a cover story on ath
letes Ceci Hopp and Michael
Heiss. "By putting both these
well-known, rather good
looking people on campus on
the cover, We'll get people to
ffick IV Up," co-cdftor Brett

Love said.
Fine said publications start
up because students sec a need
that is not being filled by other
publications. Interview was
designed to fill one such void.
"We felt there were a lot of
small publications on campus
that did not reach a very large
audience," Love said.
