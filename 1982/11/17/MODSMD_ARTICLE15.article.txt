## California's budget deficit... 
### 
Recession-wrecked California faces a large un
constitutional budget deficit, a gaping abyss that
has turned California politics upside down. Frenzy
and panic stalk the hallways of the Legislature as
the hyper-kinetic lawmakers read tea leaves, feel
the pulse of the folks back home and attempt to sec
ond-guess each other's intentions in the search for a
solution.
State tax revenues stand at the very heart of the
problem. The state's income is far below the
projected figure for this current fiscal year. The
long-term effects of Proposition 13 cannot totally
account for a shortfall that likely will range be
tween $700 million and $1.5 billion. The consensus
among the majority of experts is that the deficit will
fall into the narrower range of $1.1 billion to $1.3
billion. Economic whiz kids and old wizards all
agree that it will be next-to-impossible to suc
cessfully project gross revenues and expenditures
for the remainder of the fiscal year.
As a result of the crisis and the politicians'
analysis of the election results, sentiment is now
swinging toward new taxes rather than further
draconian budget cuts.
The problem, as always, is that powerful interests
and high-powered professional lobbies will oppose
any new tax measure proposed in Sacramento.

Tobacco and alcohol companies will oppose the so
called sin taxes. Multinational oil companies, am
bitious developers and Secretary of the Interior
James Watt will probably oppose the oil severance
tax. Also, citizens' tax revolt groups are always on
the prowl.
The upcoming special session of the Legislature
will probably prove that we live "in the worst of
times." We deeply fear that the Democrats would
like to wait and pin the blame for any further
budget cuts or new tax increases on the new
Deukmejian administration. We have an anti-tax
governor-elect, a lame-duck and existentially dis
trict governor and a notoriously divided and inef
fective Legislature. Lawmakers are simply scared
to death about doing the obvious and necessary
thing — raising taxes — and their fear of voter
retribution borders on clinical paranoia.
Perhaps some of the pressures will be taken off
our overheated state legislature when localities suc
cessfully explore alternative revenue-raising
schemes to property taxes. For the time being, how
ever, it appears that a noted political analyst's
worst fears about post-conservative America are
coming true: the Politics of Fragmentation have led
to policy stagnation and legislative gridlock.
