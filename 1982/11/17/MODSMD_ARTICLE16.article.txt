Given the state budget crisis and the natural ten
dency for legislators to cut funds for education
from any unbalanced budget, these legislators
should direct their attention toward what we con
sider to be one of California's most sacred cows: the
University of California's "fees."
This particular bovine, a nine-school system
which provides its students with the best public
education in the country, has nuzzled into the
hearts of Californians, who point to its prize-win
ning faculty and students and low tuition (euphe
mistically called registration fees) as a model of
how public education should be run. Californians,
both rich and poor, have come to take for granted
this low tuition ($ll7O at Berkeley this year) and
guard its sanctity with religious fervor.
Stanford administrators have many problems
with the UC tuition system, and, recognizing that
either Cal Grants or UC funds, or both, will be cut,
have tried over the years to persuade legislators of
the sanctity of Cal Grants. At first glance this at
tempt may seem a bit, well, selfish. The University
is attempting, naturally, to protect these funds,
which provide it with extensive state-financed fi
nancial aid; it is yelling self-defensively that UC
schools should charge more for their wealthier stu
dents. We think that a bit of self-interest in this case
may benefit all.
There is a term that has been used to describe the
California higher public education we think is ap
propriate in the case of the UC system: upward re
distribution of wealth. The state is funding a dis
proportionately wealthy group of students and
charging, in "fees," a uniform charge far below the
full cost of the education. Furthermore, when the
system is faced with near collapse, or at least drastic
reduction in quality of education, wealthier stu
dents within the schools are still asked to assume
the same direct burden as students from poorer
families.

Many defend this formula by pointing out that
wealthier Californians pay a disproportionate
amount of state taxes and should, therefore, benefit
in disproportion. We think that in the post-Propo
sition 13 era, when the wealthy are reaping the ben
efits of severely reduced property taxes, this argu
ment becomes less potent, especially when the UC
system educates such a small proportion of state
students and serves, rather, as a general service to
the welfare of the entire state.
Raising tuition at the UC schools would, of
course, be even more unfair to poorer students if
there were not a proportional increase in the Cal
Grant program — enough to offset the higher costs
for those students who cannot reasonably afford
the higher fees. Faced with tremendous pressures to
cut education budgets, this plan may be the only
way to salvage the state's higher education system:
raise fees for those who can pay while maintaining a
strong commitment to Cal Grants for those Cali
fornia residents who need them. By increasing the
tuition rate, there would still be an enormous
marginal increase in funds, even after buttressing
the Cal Grant program.
But it is even more important to recognize the ex
tent of California's budget problem. Given Gov.-
elect George Deukmejian's promise to veto any tax
hike, we must choose: either Cal Grants, which
benefit poorer Californians, are cut, or tuition is
raised at the heretofore sacrosanct UC schools.
The problem with attacking all sacred cows is
that often their defenders will protect them blindly
without realizing that there may be a better way of
protecting their existence. Deukmejian's luke
warm support of education will probably result in
cuts both in Cal Grants and the UC system. Chang
ing the UC's regressive tuition structure now may
be a way of averting future deep cuts in education.
