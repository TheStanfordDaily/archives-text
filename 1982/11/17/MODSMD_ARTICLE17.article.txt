# Waste disposal ineffective?
## 
### 
Late last month a fire fighter was injured on cam
pus while attempting to extinguish a fire that had
ignited in a load of garbage. Dr. Alain Decleve, di
rector of health and safety here, determined that the
fire flared because there were chemicals which had
been improperly discarded. The fire injury is an
isolated example of a much broader problem which
prompts us to question the effectiveness of the Uni
versity's toxic waste disposal system. Many of the
research labs here — in many scientific and medical
departments — commonly use toxic chemicals in
experiments that are not closely regulated. We are
fortunate that the injuries sustained by the fire
fighter were not more serious, and hope the hun
dreds of other people who have contact with the
wastes are luckier.
Toxic waste disposal is more than a University is
sue. Toxic chemical leaks from underground
storage facilities were detected by nearly 30 Silicon
Valley firms. One leak contaminated the drinking
water of a San Jose neighborhood. State officials

are currently conducting an investigation into re
ports of increased incidences of birth defects, mis
carriages and adult health problems among the res
idents.
Following the chemical fire, the University in
stituted a free hazardous waste disposal service to
encourage the proper disposal of toxic and other
dangerous materials. An interim disposal site has
been designated and plans are being made for a per
manent facility, which will be expensive for the
University, just as it is necessary. The cities of Santa
Clara County are responding to the situation by
considering new ordinances which would regulate
the handling and disposal of toxic chemicals.
The issue of toxic waste disposal is clearly of
growing significance to the University and surroun
ding communities for its financial, environmental
and personal safety implications. Understanding
this importance, the Daily plans a series of articles,
starting today, designed to inform better its readers
in an area of great concern to us all.
