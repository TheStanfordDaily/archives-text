## Veterans Day deserves mention regardless of political ideology 
### 
I was distressed that the Daily failed
even to mention Veterans Day any
where in the Nov. 11 issue. Despite the
anti-war sentiment of editorials appear
ing in the Daily, as a matter of respect
recognition (perhaps a photograph of
the new Vietnam Veteran Memorial)
should not have been neglected.
Regardless of our ethical views of any
war that U.S. soldiers died in, it is
crucial to remember that those men
were our countrvmen, our uncles and
maybe even our brothers.
As a prominent spokesman for one of
the nation's most prestigious univer
sities, the Daily should feel remorse for
this careless, negligent omission.

Electoral politics
Recently, I had the distinct dis
pleasure of reading Steven Weber's
opinion piece, "Electoral politics lead
to stagnation." I found his argument
quite ludicrous and his stylistic presen
tation laughable at best. His attempts to
support his opinion left an extremely
bad taste in my mouth and a feeling that
I had wasted my time even bothering to
read the opinions page of the Daily.
How many times in our educational
experience are we warned against using
broad, unsubstantiated general
izations? Weber claims that disillusion
ment with the electoral system is
epidemic in the United States — a fiery,
emotional statement certainly — but
what does he mean to achievc by drop
ping a bomb like this without support

ing it with evidence? Although I've met
many people who arc disillusioned with
politicians, I have vet to meet a person
who is definitely opposed to electoral
government.
When using such an imaginative ex
aggeration, Weber should clarify it with
at least one fragment of supporting evi
dence. Without facts, the reader will re
fer to his own experiences and see if he
can agree with the argument.
How Weber can promote credibility
in his argument by condensing the en
tire American political structure into
one nonsensical label — liberal demo
cratic capitalism — is beyond me. Per
haps he thinks that the reader is so ig
norant that he will pass right over this
and not question the logic of such a
phrase.
To be quite frank, I feel that Weber
insulted mv intelligence by expecting
me to swallow that statement and, ac

cordinglv, I viewed the rest of his essay
with the jaundiced eye it deserved. Ap
parently, he is afraid of being labeled as
one thing or another — although I cer
tainly don't know why. Perhaps he
sought to be judicious by sparing no
spectrum of American politics from his
writh.
It appears that Weber is gambling
that readers already agree with him — a
situation that creates an atmosphere for
extremely dry expository writing.
Couldn't he have taken a campus poll
or researched periodicals for some facts
that would support his opinion? I won
der why he didn't do this. Could it be
that the facts don't support his broad
'assumptions? As a reader, I demand
facts, not emotional claptrap or
tiresome cliches that fold before serious
opposition.
