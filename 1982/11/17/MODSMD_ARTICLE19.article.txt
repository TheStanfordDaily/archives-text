## U.S.S.R. policy after Brezhnev 
### 
For the Western observer, events in the Soviet Union are
difficult to understand and nearly impossible to predict.
Whereas long-term trends can be determined and analyzed,
even the most pervasive tendencies of Soviet policy contain
within them elements of contradiction and paradox. It is be
cause of the paradoxical elements in Soviet policy that our
foreknowledge of former President Leonid Brezhnev's im
minent death has aided only slightly our predictions as to the
nature of the post-Brezhnev era. However, an analysis of
Brezhnev's policies will help us to see the general direction
that the new leadership will take in the Soviet Union.
Brezhnev, in many respects, characterized Soviet political
tendencies as much as he created them. Khruschev had
maintained the doctrine of "peaceful co-existence" concur
rently with his boast, "We will bury you." The Cuban missile
crisis, to a large degree, was caused by a Soviet attempt to
expand its intercontinental missile capability while simulta
neously emphasizing the civilian aspects of the economy at
the expense of the military sector.

To say that no major changes are
expected in Andropov*s foreign policy
is by no means to imply that the
dangers will not be great.

During the Brezhnev era (1964-1982) the Soviet Union
often pursued seemingly contradictory policies. The ad
vocate of "Westpolitik" qijd, "fletente" with, the West was
also the author of the "Brezhnev doctrine," a policy jus
tifying and promising Soviet intervention states if
socialism became "endangered." The results of this doc
trine, the invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968 and martial
law in Poland in 1981, have only served to chill East-West
relations, much to the detriment of the "detente" policy.
Soviet initiatives concerning arms control during the last
18 years were accompanied by an unabated and unnecessary
unilateral military buildup in the decade following SALT I.
Soviet military spending increased throughout the Brezhnev
era on an unprecedented scale.
The ratification of the Helsinki Accords in 1975 was surely
one of Brezhnev's greatest feats. These accords recognized
the existing division of Europe and, therefore, legitimized
Soviet imperial gains of World War II while promising
greater human rights within the Soviet bloc. However, the
crowning treaty of "detente" coincided with the peaking and
subsequent demise of the very human rights the treaty was
designed to protect. Today every Soviet member of the Hel
sinki watch group has been either jailed or exiled. Emigra
tion of Jews has declined since the days of "detente" and So
viet dissidents have less freedom now than at any time since
Khruschev's de-Stalinzation.
With the apparent succession of former KGB chief Yuri
Andropov to the interim position of leadership in the USSR,
most analysts foresee little change from Brezhnev's foreign
policy.
This policy can be said to have had four basic elements:
first, a desire for greater and broader East-West trade. This
desire was motivated primarily by domestic economic need

rather than any belief that trade will prevent superpower
conflict.
Second, the Soviet Union has consistently sought to ratify
and maintain the European status quo. The "Brezhnev doc
trine" has allowed some minor divergence in the East bloc
such as the Hungarian incentive-based "New Economic
Mechanism" and the Romanian abstention from Warsaw
Pact maneuvers, but it tolerates no threats to the Communist
governments in power (as in Poland) or threats to the prin
ciples of socialism by the governments themselves (as in
Dubcek's Czechoslovakia).
Third, the era of Brezhnev's "Westpolitik" was one in
which the USSR actively pursued arms control agreements.
This pursuit of arms control was coupled, however, with an
equally vigorous military buildup in all areas: strategic, thea
ter, tactical, chemical and conventional.
Fourth, Brezhnev believed that beyond Europe the world
was open to superpower penetration and'competition. The
Third World became the objection of Soviet aggression, aid
and destabilizing influences. Expansionist policy was only
partially successful, however, because the Soviet Union suf
fered great setbacks in the Mideast and in the decline in
world esteem brought with the Afghanistan invasion.
If we agree that the new leadership will adhere to these
four principles of foreign policy, then we have yet to apply
these principles to present and future world realities. To say
that no major changes are expected in Andropov's foreign
policy is by no means to imply that the dangers will not be
great.
We can expect continued USSR-West European detente
in a muted effort to increase trade. The Soviet motives will be
primarily economic the foreign policy a.irn of put
ting a rift in NATO and isolating the United States will also
bek consideration' * " ' ''
Along with the emphasis on economic detente, it is likely
that there will be continued repression of human rights
throughout the Soviet bloc. As the economic crisis worsens
there will also be greater domestic political control in an ef
fort to maintain stability.
There probably will be no decline in the military budget,
or perhaps even no decline in its rate of growth.
Last, we can also expect the severe and chronic problems
of the Soviet economy such as agricultural failures, declining
growth in industrial production and labor shortages to play
an increasingly destabilizing role in the future. On the one
hand, these problems will cause increased desire for detente
and trade with the West; but on the other hand, they will
create intensified conflicts of priority between the military
and civilian sectors of the Soviet economy. These conflicts
could lead to increased attempts at reform or lead to military
adventurism.
The real crisis of transition will come later, as the whole
Brezhnev generation is of necessity replaced during the next
decade. The course that a younger, less experienced gener
ation — a generation which has not undergone the tragedy
of world war — will take is even more difficult to predict. We
can only hope that the direction the interim leadership takes,
and the way in which the United States responds to those in
itial steps, will encourage an accomodating, rather than con
frontational, approach after the next transition.

designed to protect. Today every Soviet member of the Hel
sinki watch group has been either jailed or exiled. Emigra
tion of Jews has declined since the days of "detente" and So
viet dissidents have less freedom now than at any time since
Khruschev's de-Stalinzation.
With the apparent succession of former KGB chief Yuri
Andropov to the interim position of leadership in the USSR,
most analysts foresee little change from Brezhnev's foreign
policy.
This policy can be said to have had four basic elements:
first, a desire for greater and broader East-West trade. This
desire was motivated primarily by domestic economic need

rather than any belief that trade will prevent superpower
conflict.
Second, the Soviet Union has consistently sought to ratify
and maintain the European status quo. The "Brezhnev doc
trine" has allowed some minor divergence in the East bloc
such as the Hungarian incentive-based "New Economic
Mechanism" and the Romanian abstention from Warsaw
Pact maneuvers, but it tolerates no threats to the Communist
governments in power (as in Poland) or threats to the prin
ciples of socialism by the governments themselves (as in
Dubcek's Czechoslovakia).
Third, the era of Brezhnev's "Westpolitik" was one in
which the USSR actively pursued arms control agreements.
This pursuit of arms control was coupled, however, with an
equally vigorous military buildup in all areas: strategic, thea
ter, tactical, chemical and conventional.
Fourth, Brezhnev believed that beyond Europe the world
was open to superpower penetration and'competition. The
Third World became the objection of Soviet aggression, aid
and destabilizing influences. Expansionist policy was only
partially successful, however, because the Soviet Union suf
fered great setbacks in the Mideast and in the decline in
world esteem brought with the Afghanistan invasion.
If we agree that the new leadership will adhere to these
four principles of foreign policy, then we have yet to apply
these principles to present and future world realities. To say
that no major changes are expected in Andropov's foreign
policy is by no means to imply that the dangers will not be
great.
We can expect continued USSR-West European detente
in a muted effort to increase trade. The Soviet motives will be
primarily economic the foreign policy a.irn of put
ting a rift in NATO and isolating the United States will also
bek consideration' * " ' ''
Along with the emphasis on economic detente, it is likely
that there will be continued repression of human rights
throughout the Soviet bloc. As the economic crisis worsens
there will also be greater domestic political control in an ef
fort to maintain stability.
There probably will be no decline in the military budget,
or perhaps even no decline in its rate of growth.
Last, we can also expect the severe and chronic problems
of the Soviet economy such as agricultural failures, declining
growth in industrial production and labor shortages to play
an increasingly destabilizing role in the future. On the one
hand, these problems will cause increased desire for detente
and trade with the West; but on the other hand, they will
create intensified conflicts of priority between the military
and civilian sectors of the Soviet economy. These conflicts
could lead to increased attempts at reform or lead to military
adventurism.
The real crisis of transition will come later, as the whole
Brezhnev generation is of necessity replaced during the next
decade. The course that a younger, less experienced gener
ation — a generation which has not undergone the tragedy
of world war — will take is even more difficult to predict. We
can only hope that the direction the interim leadership takes,
and the way in which the United States responds to those in
itial steps, will encourage an accomodating, rather than con
frontational, approach after the next transition.

For the Western observer, events in the Soviet Union are
difficult to understand and nearly impossible to predict.
Whereas long-term trends can be determined and analyzed,
even the most pervasive tendencies of Soviet policy contain
within them elements of contradiction and paradox. It is be
cause of the paradoxical elements in Soviet policy that our
foreknowledge of former President Leonid Brezhnev's im
minent death has aided only slightly our predictions as to the
nature of the post-Brezhnev era. However, an analysis of
Brezhnev's policies will help us to see the general direction
that the new leadership will take in the Soviet Union.
Brezhnev, in many respects, characterized Soviet political
tendencies as much as he created them. Khruschev had
maintained the doctrine of "peaceful co-existence" concur
rently with his boast, "We will bury you." The Cuban missile
crisis, to a large degree, was caused by a Soviet attempt to
expand its intercontinental missile capability while simulta
neously emphasizing the civilian aspects of the economy at
the expense of the military sector.

To say that no major changes are
expected in Andropov*s foreign policy
is by no means to imply that the
dangers will not be great.

During the Brezhnev era (1964-1982) the Soviet Union
often pursued seemingly contradictory policies. The ad
vocate of "Westpolitik" qijd, "fletente" with, the West was
also the author of the "Brezhnev doctrine," a policy jus
tifying and promising Soviet intervention states if
socialism became "endangered." The results of this doc
trine, the invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968 and martial
law in Poland in 1981, have only served to chill East-West
relations, much to the detriment of the "detente" policy.
Soviet initiatives concerning arms control during the last
18 years were accompanied by an unabated and unnecessary
unilateral military buildup in the decade following SALT I.
Soviet military spending increased throughout the Brezhnev
era on an unprecedented scale.
The ratification of the Helsinki Accords in 1975 was surely
one of Brezhnev's greatest feats. These accords recognized
the existing division of Europe and, therefore, legitimized
Soviet imperial gains of World War II while promising
greater human rights within the Soviet bloc. However, the
crowning treaty of "detente" coincided with the peaking and
subsequent demise of the very human rights the treaty was
designed to protect. Today every Soviet member of the Hel
sinki watch group has been either jailed or exiled. Emigra
tion of Jews has declined since the days of "detente" and So
