# Hall of Fame bowl possible
## Big Game win to fetch bowl bid 
### MARK ZEIGLER 
The Stanford football team is bowl bound pending a vic
tory in the Big Game Saturday against UC-Berkeley, Athlet
ic Director Andy Geiger announced yesterday at a press con
ference.
"I understand that if we're successful Saturday in Memo
rial Stadium in Berkeley, we'll receive an invitation to the
Hall of Fame Bowl in Birmingham, Ala., on Dec. 31,"
Cieiger said.
"The opponent would be Vanderbilt," he told a group of
about 30 journalists at Ming's Chinese restaurant in Palo
Alto. The Southeast Conference (SEC) member is 6-3 with
two games remaining. Stanford, which has never played
Vanderbilt in football, would be 6-5 if it defeats Cal.
An appearance in the Hall of Fame Bowl would be Stan
ford's first post-season bowl appearance since 1978 and its
first ever in that bowl, which is usually played between
eastern schools.
In 1978 the Cardinal beat Georgia 25-22 in the Bluebonnet
Bowl and a year earlier it upset LSU in the Sun Bowl 24-14.
Both games were on Dec. 31.
The Hall of Fame Bowl, with a scheduled kickoff of I p.m.
EST, will be televised by the Mizlou Independent Television
Network.
Although the Cardinal would enter the bowl contest just
one game over the .500 mark, it remains an attraction be
cause of Heisman Trophy candidate John Elway, Stanford's
"wide-open" stvle of play and its upset wins against na
tionallv-ranked Washington and Ohio State.
"I'm delighted," Geiger said in a phone interview last
night. "The opportunity to play in a bowl game has been the
stated goal of our seniors."
One of the happiest seniors is quarterback Elway, who has
repeatedly stated that one disappointment of his Stanford

career is the team's failure to receive a post-season bowl
game bid.
"It also helps our recruiting and it's a good pride factor,"
Cieiger added.
The Hall of Fame Bowl committee contacted Geiger yes
terday for the first time. Representatives from the bowl will
attend Saturday's Big Game in Berkeley.
"It (the bowi bid) would be after the game — if we win,"
Geiger said, dispelling anv rumors that the invitation could
be granted at half-time. According to an NCAA rule, bowl
committees cannot issue bids before Nov. 20, Big Game day.
Cieiger noted that the Athletic Department would not re
ceive much, if any, money from appearing in the Hal 1 of
Fame Bowl and being on TV. "It (the monetary considera
tions) would involve paving our way to and from the game,"
he said.
Stanford's Athletic Department reportedly has received
more than $1 million from national and regional televsion
appearances this season.
The requirement of a Stanford victory over the Cal Bears
to gain the bowl bid adds another dimension to an already
intense cross-Bay rivalry. Saturday's game marks the 85th
meeting between Stanford and Cal. The Cardinal leads the
series 40-34-10.
"I'm most eager for us to win the Big Game," Geiger re
marked. "It means more than a bowl game (bid)."
The last time a Stanford Big Game victory involved a bowl
invitation was in 1980, when a 6-4 Cardinal squad was vir
tually assured a Peach Bowl bid if they defeated Cal. How
ever, Stanford lost the Big Game 28-23 and was not invited
to the Peach Bowl.
Vanderbilt plays Tennessee-Chattanooga Saturday and
takes on Tennesse the following weekend in its final tune-up
before the Hall of Fame Bowl.
