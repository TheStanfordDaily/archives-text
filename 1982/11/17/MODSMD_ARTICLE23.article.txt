Church awaits new organ
Memorial Church is eagerlv awaiting the
arrival of a new Baroque-stvie organ The in
strument. scheduled to arrive in a vear. wiU
complement the present Romantic organ
that presently resides :n the church
The organ's designer and bu:>der. Charles
Fisk. had planned to be a nuclear physicist
until he met Herbert Nannev. a professor of
music here, m 1950. Soon afterwards, dis
cussions began aSout the poswbilm of
purchasing a new organ so that a more com
plete range of music could be played in the
no n-denominational church
The present organ. which V acne* plavs m
the Sundav services, was buik m i9oi in
Murray Harris, but the sound doe* not work
well with some of the Baroque tune* that
Nanney would like to pla>
Evelyn Almack Tumntiae, a * ?rshir»pe"
at the church, had often svTupatinaDd with
Nannev about the reed for a ne» :>rgar.. and
when she d»ec in 19 7 3. she left 54Q0.000 for
the purchase of a new instrument
Unfortunately, that amount was about
half of w hat »as neeoec Having two organs
against the same wall w ouid r»e too Ttuch of
a strain unless the north waii was reinforced
In 1979. Virginia Morrell allotted the
profits from a property saie for church reno
vaDon. This S5 30,000 helped meet the $1.9
million cost.
The board of trustee* voice this Septem
ber to adc S3OOJOOO to the organ's budget
This .ncrease wiß allow the organ to have IT

However, Fisk had not oone extensrve
work in music He nac beer a memtitr of the
Memonai Church choir at Harvard, sunt in
a boy's choir and played some piano and
trumpet

FtU was introduced :o John Swmford.
the custodian of xhe Memorial Church or
gan. who suggested that rx iFiski get in
volved an instrument pu .ding. Swmford
said. "There *no momo r. iL bui great satis
faction.**
After switching his major to music. Fisk
began 10 learn how to pla* ihe organ He
said thai he realized that man> Baroque
compositions did not sojnd right on the
church organ
Although Fisk ne*-er receded his decree,
Vannex said Fisk **isconsidered b\ most or

Baroque type organ. "* Man* mustaans 10-
da are decidi he to use th; correct type of in
strument for each piecs that is piaxed. so
Baroque organs are no» needed
The organ presentb n the church has
??55 pipes, all of which sumved the 1
earthquake with iiaJe damage. The wall be
hind the organ, however, did not do as wen

In preparation, stee frames have been

SLAC researcher retires
Joseph Baliam. associate director of the
-esearcti division at the Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center (SLACI. has retired in or
der to pursue full-time research
A 20-vear veteran a. SLaC Baliam has
Peer "a ke* guv m the whole program," said
Roaer Enckson. a research associate at
SLAC.
In addition to directing the research pro
gram.. Ballam has beer ven interested m the
nubble chamber experiments. These experi
ments involve a cylindrical tank one meter in
diameter with a glass si at and a piston at one
end. Liquid h vdrogen n kept in the tank at a
verv low temperature and under great pres
sure
The chamPe- is a "kmc oi detector for stu
dying fragments of particles produced in a
collision" said Encksor. lr order to have a
reaction, the piston is moved out verv slight
ly and ver> suuaenn Tnif movement makes
the liquid nvdrcmer start n noil

In between ihc release and the boiling, a
heam. shot through the hydrogen. aims at
the protons in the liquid. A computer at
tached to the unk monitors the reaaion and
if n sees anything interesting, it takes a pic
ture of the collision.
The panicles that are released as a result
of the collision leave behind a trail of uny
bubbles that are so close together that they
seem like a line Because the chamber is in
side a magnetic field, the paths of the
charged parities are curved Therefore, the
researchers are able to measure the particle's
charge and momentum.
One aspect of this experiment thai Ballam
has investigated is the phenomenon of
"charmed quarks.** These hypothetical ob
jects are inside a normal, sub-nuclear parti
cles Because thev are so small, no one has
been able to positively identify them, but it is
generally assumed that tbev exist.
Ballam has made progress toward identi
fying them because their spontaneous disin
tegration in the chamber causes different
tracks to appear in the photograph of the ex
periment.
Geology prof, honored
Allan Cox. dean of the School of Earth
Sciences, has named Prof. James Ingle as the
outstanding teacher of 1982 in the depart
ment The award, which was given for the
first time this \ear. includes a S2OOO cash
prize.
Ingle, who is the chairman of the Geology
Department, was honored at an Academic
Council meeting in October.
Cox said that the enthusiasm for Ingle's
oceanography and micropaleontology
courses is so great that the department runs
"a serious risk every year that the 280 stu
dents * ho take his introductory courses will
all become micropaleontologists and
saturate the » orld job market."
Aside from being cited bv associates as an
outstanding professor, students also com
mend Ingle for his teaching techniques. One
student » ho enrolled in the oceans course as
"a painless way to fulfill my math/science
requirement" became interested in the topic
because of Ingle. He said that he now com
pares his professors' teaching ability to In
gle's.
In a survey distributed to the Oceans class,
121 of the 139 students gave Ingle the highest
rating in the category of knowledge of sub
ted material.
Ingle's speciality is micropaleontology in
the Pacific He has studied the application of
paleontoloe\ in the recent geological eras.
He teaches Introduction to Micro
paleontologv. Advanced Paleontology and
Microfossils in Exploration Geology.
After spending 1967 as a visiting research
scholar at Tohoku University in Japan, In
cie came to the University as an associate
proiessor of geology. In 1981, he became as

tociate chairman of the department and a
professor of fceologv. He »a* also asked to
vpeak at (he NATO Advanced Study In
rtilute in last vear.

Hospital to dedicate chapel
The University Hospital will dedicate the
new chapel today at 4 p.m., following an
open house that begins at 2 p.m. The dedi
cation will be conducted by fcrnle Young,
the chaplain.
The old chapel was torn down almost one
year ago to make room for new patient ad
mitting services.
The stained glass window that Young said
symbolizes "hope in the midst of pain and
despair" was created by Ginny McAfee.
Bordered bv tiles used originally in Memori
al Church, the window has no specific re
ligious message because the chapel is non
denomiational.
An organizer of the chaplaincy in 1972,
Young said that he and his colleagues. Rev
erend Frank Geer and Father John Hester,
have helped relatives not only cope with
their spiritual problems, but also with prac
tical difficulties such as hotel reservations
and plane tickets.
About 65 percent of Young's patients are
terminally or critically ill and are concerned
with essential questions of life. Young said
that he tries to help them and their families
resolve some of these questions.
The chaplains, whose offices are located
next to the new chapel, are always on-call in
addition to having regular office hours.
