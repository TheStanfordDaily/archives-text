## Tentative agreement signed; NFL season starts Sunday 
### Associated Press 
New York — A tentative agree
ment was reached last night to
end the 57-dav-old National
Football League strike, the long
est and costliest walkout in sports
history. The season is to resume
Sunday.
The settlement, subject to rati
fication by player representatives
of the 28 clubs and the owners'
NFL Management Council and
then three-quarters of the owners
and a majority the 1,500 players,
was confirmed by management
negotiator Jack Donlan, union
chief Ed Garvey and union presi
dent Gene Upshaw.
Details of the settlement, in
cluding how many games the sea
son will be comprised of, were
not available pending ratifi
cation. Donlan said, however,
that Super Bowl XVII will be
played Jan. 30 in Pasadena,
Calif., as originally scheduled.
"I think we have a tentative
agreement," Donlan said. "I am
hoping it can be ratified tonight. I
am happy and elated."
The agreement was reached af
ter two days of renewed nego
tiations that began after the Na
tional Labor Relations Board re
fused the union's request to cite
the league for bargaining in bad
faith.
Estimates of the costs of the

strike ranged upwards of $275
million, based on league esti
mates of $30 million a week in
revenues and union estimates of
$9 million a week in player
salaries.
Last year, major league
baseball players struck for 50
days. Bv the time play resumed,
59 days of the 1981 season had
been lost and the estimated cost
of the strike was $150 million.
The football strike affected 112
of the originally scheduled 224
games.
This Sunday's games are Balti
more at the New York Jets, Cin
cinnati at Philadelphia, Detroit
at Chicago, Kansas City at New
Orleans, the Los Angeles Rams
at Atlanta, Miami at Buffalo,
Minnesota vs. Green Bay at Mil
waukee, New England at Cleve
land, Pittsburgh at Houston, San
Francisco at St. Louis, Seattle at
Denver, Tampa Bay at Dallas
and Washington at the New
York Giants.
On Monday night, San Diego
will visit the Los Angeles Raid
ers.
The contract between the
players' association expired on
July 15, but the training camps
opened on schedule a week later
and the exhibition season went
unterrupted.
The season opened Sept. 12
with all the games being played.

The only potential trouble was in
Seattle, where the Seahawks
threatened to strike their game
with Cleveland because Sam Mc-
Cullum, their player represent
ative, had been cut. McCullum
subsequently signed with Minne
sota.
On Sept. 15, the union's ex
ecutive committee set a strike
deadline of Tuesday, Sept. 21, the
day after the second regular-sea
son weekend, barring a break
through in negotiations that had
begun seven months earlier.
in what it called one last at
tempt to avert a strike, the union
abandoned its demand for 55
percent of the teams' gross reven
ue. Instead, it asked for $1.6
billion — the same amount man
agement was offering — but over
four years instead of five. Instead
of a percentage of the gross, it
•asked for half the league's $2.1
billion five-year television pack
age.
The union reaffirmed its de
cision to strike on Sept. 20. That
night's Giant-Packer game, the
last to be played, took place
around two power failures in a
rainy, misty Giants Stadium that
seemed to accentuate the gloom
infecting pro football.
Stadiums were dark on Sept.
26, the first regular-season week
end without football.

New York — A tentative agree
ment was reached last night to
end the 57-dav-old National
Football League strike, the long
est and costliest walkout in sports
history. The season is to resume
Sunday.
The settlement, subject to rati
fication by player representatives
of the 28 clubs and the owners'
NFL Management Council and
then three-quarters of the owners
and a majority the 1,500 players,
was confirmed by management
negotiator Jack Donlan, union
chief Ed Garvey and union presi
dent Gene Upshaw.
Details of the settlement, in
cluding how many games the sea
son will be comprised of, were
not available pending ratifi
cation. Donlan said, however,
that Super Bowl XVII will be
played Jan. 30 in Pasadena,
Calif., as originally scheduled.
"I think we have a tentative
agreement," Donlan said. "I am
hoping it can be ratified tonight. I
am happy and elated."
The agreement was reached af
ter two days of renewed nego
tiations that began after the Na
tional Labor Relations Board re
fused the union's request to cite
the league for bargaining in bad
faith.
Estimates of the costs of the

strike ranged upwards of $275
million, based on league esti
mates of $30 million a week in
revenues and union estimates of
$9 million a week in player
salaries.
Last year, major league
baseball players struck for 50
days. Bv the time play resumed,
59 days of the 1981 season had
been lost and the estimated cost
of the strike was $150 million.
The football strike affected 112
of the originally scheduled 224
games.
This Sunday's games are Balti
more at the New York Jets, Cin
cinnati at Philadelphia, Detroit
at Chicago, Kansas City at New
Orleans, the Los Angeles Rams
at Atlanta, Miami at Buffalo,
Minnesota vs. Green Bay at Mil
waukee, New England at Cleve
land, Pittsburgh at Houston, San
Francisco at St. Louis, Seattle at
Denver, Tampa Bay at Dallas
and Washington at the New
York Giants.
On Monday night, San Diego
will visit the Los Angeles Raid
ers.
The contract between the
players' association expired on
July 15, but the training camps
opened on schedule a week later
and the exhibition season went
unterrupted.
The season opened Sept. 12
with all the games being played.

The only potential trouble was in
Seattle, where the Seahawks
threatened to strike their game
with Cleveland because Sam Mc-
Cullum, their player represent
ative, had been cut. McCullum
subsequently signed with Minne
sota.
On Sept. 15, the union's ex
ecutive committee set a strike
deadline of Tuesday, Sept. 21, the
day after the second regular-sea
son weekend, barring a break
through in negotiations that had
begun seven months earlier.
in what it called one last at
tempt to avert a strike, the union
abandoned its demand for 55
percent of the teams' gross reven
ue. Instead, it asked for $1.6
billion — the same amount man
agement was offering — but over
four years instead of five. Instead
of a percentage of the gross, it
•asked for half the league's $2.1
