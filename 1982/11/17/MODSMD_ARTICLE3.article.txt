Reagan Attacks jobs proposal
New Orleans — President Reagan yesterday struck hard at critics of his
economic policy, rejecting their proposal for a public works program to re
lieve unemployment, and insisting that his defense budget and tax cuts re
main untouched.
Although Senate Republicans and House Democrats will introduce job
creating bills when Congress returns for its lame-duck session later this
month, the president strongly opposes any such legislation.
"Let's quit kidding ourselves: We will not solve the problems of un
employed auto workers and steel workers with another giant, temporary,
public works program," Reagan said. "The answers to the challenges of the
'80s do not lie in the make-work programs of the '60s and '70s. What the
unemployed need most is a broad-based economic recovery."
Scorning proposals designed to hire the unemployed to repair highways
and bridges, he said: "Our decade-long trend of rising unemployment was
not caused by highway potholes."
Reagan vowed to persist in his efforts to cut the non-defense share of fed
eral spending in order to reduce the looming federal budget deficit.
"If the United States is to meet its investment challenge, we must get the
growth of non-defense spending under control once and for all," Reagan
said. The president has put himself on a political collision course with the
advocates of reduced defense spending, a group that includes some influen
tial Congressional Republicans as well as most Democrats.
Reagan emphatically rejected critics' arguments that
his policies may have worsened the budget problem. "A
propaganda campaign would have you believe these defi
cits are caused by our so-called massive tax cut and de
fense buildup," he said.
Sino-Soviet exchange promising
Moscow — The foreign ministers of China and the So
viet Union met here yesterday in the highest level of con
tact between the two countries in 13 years, a step that con
firmed the new Kremlin leadership's intention efforts to
improve Sino-Soviet relations after two decades of enmi
ty.
[ he meeting was unlikely to result in a breakthrough in
relations, but it could speed a rapproachment between
the two dominant powers on the Asian continent,
Western analysts said.
The official Tass news agency said the meeting between
Huang Hua of China and Andrei Gromyko of the Soviet
Union involved "a brief exchange of opinions on matters
of interest to both sides."
The two foreign ministers agreed, Tass noted, that a
"political dialog" should continue between Moscow and
Peking The first round of exploratory talks on Sino-So
viet relations after a three-year hiatus took place last
month in Peking at the vice-ministerial level and a second
round is expected to begin in Moscow later this year or
earlv in 1983.
Gromvko, Tass reported, said that the Soviet leader
ship attaches great significance to normalizing relations
with China and that it "w ill continue striving for these re
lations to be switched to lines of good-neighborliness."
Huang, who was in Moscow to attend Leonid
Bre/hnev's funeral on Monday, appeared to take a more
restrained stance. Tass quoted the Chinese foreign min
ister as saving that he hoped through mutual efforts that
relations "will be gradually normalized."
Defense budget survives first test
Washington — In the first post-election test of Presi
dent Reagan's proposed defense budget, a House Ap
propriations subcommittee voted to fund in fiscal 1983
all the major weapons systems the administration sup
ports except for the controversial Pershing 2 missile.
"1 here had b<*en speculation that Democratic gains in
the Nov. 2 election would leave C ongress less inclined
than before to go along with the president's large pro
posed defense buildup, and it may yet be curtailed on the
House and Senate floors.
but mi?, subcommittee is very conscious of the com
munist threat," said Charles Wilson (D-Tex.), explaining
the reluctance vesterday to make military spending cuts.
"It's a very hawkish subcommittee."
Subcommittee members said $498 million was deleted
for procurement of Pershing 2 missiles, a central element
in plans to modernize NATO's nuclear arsenal in Eu
rope, because of unresolved technical problems rather
than opposition to the missile itself. The Pershing failed
in its first two tests and a third was postponed.
'• The Pershing has not had one successful flight," said
Chairman Joseph Addabbo (D-N.Y.), adding that he ex
pected the subcommittee action to be upheld on the floor
of the House. Other congressmen said money for the in
termediate-range missile can easily be added in a sup
plemental appropriation later this year if test results im
prove.
Pershing missiles, which would be stationed in West
Germany to counter 300 Soviet SS-20 missiles already in
stalled and aimed at Western Europe, are now the subject
of arms-control negotiations in Geneva. The Senate ap
propriations bill includes money for the Pershing and the
Reagan administration has been anxious to maintain
funding so as not to disturb relations with NATO allies.
Reactions to draft decision vary
Washington — An American Civil Liberties Union
lawyer and other opponents of the draft said yesterday

that a court decision dismissing draft registration pro
ceedings against a Pasadena, Calif., man have sounded
the "death knell" for registration.
The Department of Justice countered that the ruling
Monday bv U.S. District Judge Terry Hatter in Los An
geles had onlv limited impact. It said it will proceed with
investigations and prosecutions ol nonregistrants in a
routine manner throughout the country.
Speaking for the department, Arthur Brill, deputy di
rector of public affairs, said the government would ap
peal Hatter's findings that the government had practiced
"discriminatory prosecution" in the case of David Alan
Wavte and had revived registration in an invalid manner.
David Landau, ACLU legislative counsel, said that
"Judge Hatter had no choice" but to rule as he did and
that his decision will have "enormous significance for
other cases."
Barry Lvnn. president of Draft Action, an anti-draft
group who appeared with Landau at a press conference at
the ACLU's Washington office, said: "It would be ir
responsible and venal for the Justice Department to con
tinue to indict or bring to trial resisters while this case is
on its slow appeal."
But the Department of Justice served notice that it will
proceed with the 150 to 200 investigations of failure to
register that it is now conducting throughout the country.
Noting that the government so far has obtained 13 in
dictments and won four convictions, department spokes
man Brill said the issue of discriminatory prosecution
had been raised and lost bv defendants in three of the four
cases.
Angola frees three Americans
Lusaka, Zambia — Two American mercenaries im
prisoned for seven vears and a Washington, D.C.-area ci
vilian pilot were flying to Paris after their release by
Angola vesterday in a complex swap that involved six na
tions, the Red Cross and a guerrilla organization.
In exchange for the Americans, the liberal Union for
the Total Independence of Angola freed two Soviet
airmen; South Africa released a Soviet warrant officer
and the bodies of four other Russians, 94 Angolan sol
diers, a Cuban soldier and the body of another Cuban;
and Angola returned the bodies of three South Africans.
The exchange was carried out here under the auspices of
the Geveva-based International Committee of the Red
Cross.
The Zambian government imposed stringent security
at the airport where the swap took place. Dozens of sol
diers prevented reporters access to the released prisoners.
The balcony of the airport terminal was closed, but from
about 200 yards away the three Americans, mercenaries
Gustavo Grillo and Gary Acker, and civilian pilot Geof
frey Tyler, appeared all right and disembarked without
assistance from a twin-engine Red Cross plane that Hew
from Luanda, Angola. A second similar Red Cross plane
brought the bodies of the South Africans.
The swap had been under negotiation in seven capitals
on three continents for almost two years and had been
scheduled to happen several times before yesterday's suc
cessful exchange.
Zambia was a key participant because it provided a
neutral site as a termination point for a series of Red
Cross flights criss-crossing Southern Africa, ending more
than two years of negotiations over one of the most com
plicated prisoner exchanges in history.
Hussein says Iraqi war to continue
Baghdad, Iraq — President Saddam Hussein said yes
terday that attempts to find a negotiated settlement to the
war with Iran had failed and that Iraq would fight on in
definitely under his leadership to secure its borders.
Hussein, who usually refersto himself in the third per
son, dismissed as "silly" Iran's proposal that his resigna
tion could lead to a restoration of peace, saying "Saddam
Hussein is staying" even if the war lasts 10 years.
"The war will continue until our enemy respects us and
respectsour independence," hetoldagroupof U. S.jour
nalists. "There is no other choice. We have tried every
means, knocked on all the doors. We have nothing before
us but to fight.".

He said Iran still held the two small pockets of Iraqi
territory southeast of Baghdad — one near Basra and the
other near Abu Ghurbv. The Iraqi army, he said, was per
forming well. and had repulsed Iranian attacks during the
border fighting this week, capturing many tanks and in
flicting heavy casualties.
Significantly, though. Hussein made no demands ot
Iran other than that it cease hostilities, withdraw Irom
Iraqi territory and not interfere in internal affairs. He
threatened no new"offensives and his tone made it clear
that Iraq would like to end the 25-month-old war at the
negotiating table rather than on the battlefield.
His remarks were made at the first press conference he
has ever held with American journalists. Western
diplomats viewed the meeting as further evidence that the
Iraqi ruler was skeptical of his relationship with Moscow
and sought a gradual normalization of ties with Washing
ton.
Soviets criticize U.S. sanctions policy
Moscow — The Soviet Union's foreign trade minister
told 250 leading American businessmen yesterday that
the U.S. government should renounce "once and for all"
the use of trade sanctions as a weapon.
Opening the first full meeting of the US-USSR Trade
Council in four vears. Foreign Trade Minister Nikolai
Patolichev said the Soviet Union is interested in expand
ing business with American suppliers but only when it has
"complete confidence that agreements will not be bro
ken." .
"Without that confidence, no businessman will sign a
deal." he said.
His criticism of the use of trade sanctions against the
Soviet Union by- the Carter and Reagan administrations
was echoed bv a stalwart of President Reagan's Re
publican Partv, Sen. Bob Dole (R-Kan.).
In a speech prepared for delivery to the council last
night. Dole said U.S. trade restrictions should not be im
posed for foreign policy reasons unless bilateral ties are
curtailed across the board. He also said there should be
no restrictions on sales of non-strategic goods to the Sovi
et Union.
Patolichev said the United States share of Soviet im
ports was far below the potential and had slumped be
cause of Washington's political moves against the Sovi
ets, including President Jimmy Carter's partial embargo
on grain sales and Reagan's restrictions on sales of tech
nology.
Presidents, chief executive officers and other represent
atives of 125 U.S. companies are attending the three-day
meeting with representatives of Soviet state enterprises at
a Moscow hotel. There was speculation that the new
Communist Partv chief. Yuri Andropov, or another
member of the ruling Politburo would speak at the
Kremlin dinner that will close the conference tomorrow
night.
Gene research agency requested
Washington — The President's Commission on
Bioethics yesterday recommended that the government
establish a permanent agency to oversee future work in
genetic engineering.
Alex Capron, executive director of the commission,
told a House subcommittee that after two years of study,
the panel found no gene-splicing work, either in the plan
ning stages or under way, that is of any "fundamental
danger to human values, social norms or ethical prin
ciples."
He said religious groups that had asked for the study
were wrong in their perception of a danger to ethics in
gene engineering, but right in saying that there is a lack of
government oversight of the problem.
While no ethical problems have developed thus far in
nine years of gene engineering work, Capron told the
House Science and Technology oversight subcommittee
that important ethical crossroads will be reached in the
future — especially if science achieves the ability to trans
plant genes from animal to man or vice versa.
If things are to be added and subtracted from human
genes, Capron said, "it may ... be fruitful to clarify what
it is about human beings that is unique — whether it is the

sum ol'their characteristics or the t»o«
characteristics. iSlon °fDan

Scorning proposals designed to hire the unemployed to repair highways
and bridges, he said: "Our decade-long trend of rising unemployment was
not caused by highway potholes."
Reagan vowed to persist in his efforts to cut the non-defense share of fed
eral spending in order to reduce the looming federal budget deficit.
"If the United States is to meet its investment challenge, we must get the
growth of non-defense spending under control once and for all," Reagan
said. The president has put himself on a political collision course with the
advocates of reduced defense spending, a group that includes some influen
tial Congressional Republicans as well as most Democrats.
Reagan emphatically rejected critics' arguments that
his policies may have worsened the budget problem. "A
propaganda campaign would have you believe these defi
cits are caused by our so-called massive tax cut and de
fense buildup," he said.
Sino-Soviet exchange promising
Moscow — The foreign ministers of China and the So
viet Union met here yesterday in the highest level of con
tact between the two countries in 13 years, a step that con
firmed the new Kremlin leadership's intention efforts to
improve Sino-Soviet relations after two decades of enmi
ty.
[ he meeting was unlikely to result in a breakthrough in
relations, but it could speed a rapproachment between
the two dominant powers on the Asian continent,
Western analysts said.
The official Tass news agency said the meeting between
Huang Hua of China and Andrei Gromyko of the Soviet
Union involved "a brief exchange of opinions on matters
of interest to both sides."
The two foreign ministers agreed, Tass noted, that a
"political dialog" should continue between Moscow and
Peking The first round of exploratory talks on Sino-So
viet relations after a three-year hiatus took place last
month in Peking at the vice-ministerial level and a second
round is expected to begin in Moscow later this year or
earlv in 1983.
Gromvko, Tass reported, said that the Soviet leader
ship attaches great significance to normalizing relations
with China and that it "w ill continue striving for these re
lations to be switched to lines of good-neighborliness."
Huang, who was in Moscow to attend Leonid
Bre/hnev's funeral on Monday, appeared to take a more
restrained stance. Tass quoted the Chinese foreign min
ister as saving that he hoped through mutual efforts that
relations "will be gradually normalized."
Defense budget survives first test
Washington — In the first post-election test of Presi
dent Reagan's proposed defense budget, a House Ap
propriations subcommittee voted to fund in fiscal 1983
all the major weapons systems the administration sup
ports except for the controversial Pershing 2 missile.
"1 here had b<*en speculation that Democratic gains in
the Nov. 2 election would leave C ongress less inclined
than before to go along with the president's large pro
posed defense buildup, and it may yet be curtailed on the
House and Senate floors.
but mi?, subcommittee is very conscious of the com
munist threat," said Charles Wilson (D-Tex.), explaining
the reluctance vesterday to make military spending cuts.
"It's a very hawkish subcommittee."
Subcommittee members said $498 million was deleted
for procurement of Pershing 2 missiles, a central element
in plans to modernize NATO's nuclear arsenal in Eu
rope, because of unresolved technical problems rather
than opposition to the missile itself. The Pershing failed
in its first two tests and a third was postponed.
'• The Pershing has not had one successful flight," said
Chairman Joseph Addabbo (D-N.Y.), adding that he ex
pected the subcommittee action to be upheld on the floor
of the House. Other congressmen said money for the in
termediate-range missile can easily be added in a sup
plemental appropriation later this year if test results im
prove.
Pershing missiles, which would be stationed in West
Germany to counter 300 Soviet SS-20 missiles already in
stalled and aimed at Western Europe, are now the subject
of arms-control negotiations in Geneva. The Senate ap
propriations bill includes money for the Pershing and the
Reagan administration has been anxious to maintain
funding so as not to disturb relations with NATO allies.
Reactions to draft decision vary
Washington — An American Civil Liberties Union
lawyer and other opponents of the draft said yesterday

that a court decision dismissing draft registration pro
ceedings against a Pasadena, Calif., man have sounded
the "death knell" for registration.
The Department of Justice countered that the ruling
Monday bv U.S. District Judge Terry Hatter in Los An
geles had onlv limited impact. It said it will proceed with
investigations and prosecutions ol nonregistrants in a
routine manner throughout the country.
Speaking for the department, Arthur Brill, deputy di
rector of public affairs, said the government would ap
peal Hatter's findings that the government had practiced
"discriminatory prosecution" in the case of David Alan
Wavte and had revived registration in an invalid manner.
David Landau, ACLU legislative counsel, said that
"Judge Hatter had no choice" but to rule as he did and
that his decision will have "enormous significance for
other cases."
Barry Lvnn. president of Draft Action, an anti-draft
group who appeared with Landau at a press conference at
the ACLU's Washington office, said: "It would be ir
responsible and venal for the Justice Department to con
tinue to indict or bring to trial resisters while this case is
on its slow appeal."
But the Department of Justice served notice that it will
proceed with the 150 to 200 investigations of failure to
register that it is now conducting throughout the country.
Noting that the government so far has obtained 13 in
dictments and won four convictions, department spokes
man Brill said the issue of discriminatory prosecution
had been raised and lost bv defendants in three of the four
cases.
Angola frees three Americans
Lusaka, Zambia — Two American mercenaries im
prisoned for seven vears and a Washington, D.C.-area ci
vilian pilot were flying to Paris after their release by
Angola vesterday in a complex swap that involved six na
tions, the Red Cross and a guerrilla organization.
In exchange for the Americans, the liberal Union for
the Total Independence of Angola freed two Soviet
airmen; South Africa released a Soviet warrant officer
and the bodies of four other Russians, 94 Angolan sol
diers, a Cuban soldier and the body of another Cuban;
and Angola returned the bodies of three South Africans.
The exchange was carried out here under the auspices of
the Geveva-based International Committee of the Red
Cross.
The Zambian government imposed stringent security
at the airport where the swap took place. Dozens of sol
diers prevented reporters access to the released prisoners.
The balcony of the airport terminal was closed, but from
about 200 yards away the three Americans, mercenaries
Gustavo Grillo and Gary Acker, and civilian pilot Geof
frey Tyler, appeared all right and disembarked without
assistance from a twin-engine Red Cross plane that Hew
from Luanda, Angola. A second similar Red Cross plane
brought the bodies of the South Africans.
The swap had been under negotiation in seven capitals
on three continents for almost two years and had been
scheduled to happen several times before yesterday's suc
cessful exchange.
Zambia was a key participant because it provided a
neutral site as a termination point for a series of Red
Cross flights criss-crossing Southern Africa, ending more
than two years of negotiations over one of the most com
plicated prisoner exchanges in history.
Hussein says Iraqi war to continue
Baghdad, Iraq — President Saddam Hussein said yes
terday that attempts to find a negotiated settlement to the
war with Iran had failed and that Iraq would fight on in
definitely under his leadership to secure its borders.
Hussein, who usually refersto himself in the third per
son, dismissed as "silly" Iran's proposal that his resigna
tion could lead to a restoration of peace, saying "Saddam
Hussein is staying" even if the war lasts 10 years.
"The war will continue until our enemy respects us and
respectsour independence," hetoldagroupof U. S.jour
nalists. "There is no other choice. We have tried every
means, knocked on all the doors. We have nothing before
us but to fight.".

He said Iran still held the two small pockets of Iraqi
territory southeast of Baghdad — one near Basra and the
other near Abu Ghurbv. The Iraqi army, he said, was per
forming well. and had repulsed Iranian attacks during the
border fighting this week, capturing many tanks and in
flicting heavy casualties.
Significantly, though. Hussein made no demands ot
Iran other than that it cease hostilities, withdraw Irom
Iraqi territory and not interfere in internal affairs. He
threatened no new"offensives and his tone made it clear
that Iraq would like to end the 25-month-old war at the
negotiating table rather than on the battlefield.
His remarks were made at the first press conference he
has ever held with American journalists. Western
diplomats viewed the meeting as further evidence that the
Iraqi ruler was skeptical of his relationship with Moscow
and sought a gradual normalization of ties with Washing
ton.
Soviets criticize U.S. sanctions policy
Moscow — The Soviet Union's foreign trade minister
told 250 leading American businessmen yesterday that
the U.S. government should renounce "once and for all"
the use of trade sanctions as a weapon.
Opening the first full meeting of the US-USSR Trade
Council in four vears. Foreign Trade Minister Nikolai
Patolichev said the Soviet Union is interested in expand
ing business with American suppliers but only when it has
"complete confidence that agreements will not be bro
ken." .
"Without that confidence, no businessman will sign a
deal." he said.
His criticism of the use of trade sanctions against the
Soviet Union by- the Carter and Reagan administrations
was echoed bv a stalwart of President Reagan's Re
publican Partv, Sen. Bob Dole (R-Kan.).
In a speech prepared for delivery to the council last
night. Dole said U.S. trade restrictions should not be im
posed for foreign policy reasons unless bilateral ties are
curtailed across the board. He also said there should be
no restrictions on sales of non-strategic goods to the Sovi
et Union.
Patolichev said the United States share of Soviet im
ports was far below the potential and had slumped be
cause of Washington's political moves against the Sovi
ets, including President Jimmy Carter's partial embargo
on grain sales and Reagan's restrictions on sales of tech
nology.
Presidents, chief executive officers and other represent
atives of 125 U.S. companies are attending the three-day
meeting with representatives of Soviet state enterprises at
a Moscow hotel. There was speculation that the new
Communist Partv chief. Yuri Andropov, or another
member of the ruling Politburo would speak at the
Kremlin dinner that will close the conference tomorrow
night.
Gene research agency requested
Washington — The President's Commission on
Bioethics yesterday recommended that the government
establish a permanent agency to oversee future work in
genetic engineering.
Alex Capron, executive director of the commission,
told a House subcommittee that after two years of study,
the panel found no gene-splicing work, either in the plan
ning stages or under way, that is of any "fundamental
danger to human values, social norms or ethical prin
ciples."
He said religious groups that had asked for the study
were wrong in their perception of a danger to ethics in
gene engineering, but right in saying that there is a lack of
government oversight of the problem.
While no ethical problems have developed thus far in
nine years of gene engineering work, Capron told the
House Science and Technology oversight subcommittee
that important ethical crossroads will be reached in the
future — especially if science achieves the ability to trans
plant genes from animal to man or vice versa.
If things are to be added and subtracted from human
genes, Capron said, "it may ... be fruitful to clarify what
it is about human beings that is unique — whether it is the

sum ol'their characteristics or the t»o«
characteristics. iSlon °fDan

Reagan Attacks jobs proposal
New Orleans — President Reagan yesterday struck hard at critics of his
economic policy, rejecting their proposal for a public works program to re
lieve unemployment, and insisting that his defense budget and tax cuts re
main untouched.
Although Senate Republicans and House Democrats will introduce job
creating bills when Congress returns for its lame-duck session later this
month, the president strongly opposes any such legislation.
"Let's quit kidding ourselves: We will not solve the problems of un
employed auto workers and steel workers with another giant, temporary,
public works program," Reagan said. "The answers to the challenges of the
'80s do not lie in the make-work programs of the '60s and '70s. What the
unemployed need most is a broad-based economic recovery."
Scorning proposals designed to hire the unemployed to repair highways
and bridges, he said: "Our decade-long trend of rising unemployment was

Sino-Soviet exchange promising
Moscow — The foreign ministers of China and the So
viet Union met here yesterday in the highest level of con
tact between the two countries in 13 years, a step that con
firmed the new Kremlin leadership's intention efforts to
improve Sino-Soviet relations after two decades of enmi
ty.
[ he meeting was unlikely to result in a breakthrough in
relations, but it could speed a rapproachment between
the two dominant powers on the Asian continent,
Western analysts said.
The official Tass news agency said the meeting between
Huang Hua of China and Andrei Gromyko of the Soviet
Union involved "a brief exchange of opinions on matters
of interest to both sides."
The two foreign ministers agreed, Tass noted, that a
"political dialog" should continue between Moscow and
Peking The first round of exploratory talks on Sino-So
viet relations after a three-year hiatus took place last
month in Peking at the vice-ministerial level and a second
round is expected to begin in Moscow later this year or
earlv in 1983.
Gromvko, Tass reported, said that the Soviet leader
ship attaches great significance to normalizing relations
with China and that it "w ill continue striving for these re
lations to be switched to lines of good-neighborliness."
Huang, who was in Moscow to attend Leonid
Bre/hnev's funeral on Monday, appeared to take a more
restrained stance. Tass quoted the Chinese foreign min
ister as saving that he hoped through mutual efforts that
relations "will be gradually normalized."
Defense budget survives first test
Washington — In the first post-election test of Presi
dent Reagan's proposed defense budget, a House Ap
propriations subcommittee voted to fund in fiscal 1983
all the major weapons systems the administration sup
ports except for the controversial Pershing 2 missile.
"1 here had b<*en speculation that Democratic gains in
the Nov. 2 election would leave C ongress less inclined
than before to go along with the president's large pro
posed defense buildup, and it may yet be curtailed on the
House and Senate floors.
but mi?, subcommittee is very conscious of the com
munist threat," said Charles Wilson (D-Tex.), explaining
the reluctance vesterday to make military spending cuts.
"It's a very hawkish subcommittee."
Subcommittee members said $498 million was deleted
for procurement of Pershing 2 missiles, a central element
in plans to modernize NATO's nuclear arsenal in Eu
rope, because of unresolved technical problems rather
than opposition to the missile itself. The Pershing failed
in its first two tests and a third was postponed.
'• The Pershing has not had one successful flight," said
Chairman Joseph Addabbo (D-N.Y.), adding that he ex
pected the subcommittee action to be upheld on the floor
of the House. Other congressmen said money for the in
termediate-range missile can easily be added in a sup
plemental appropriation later this year if test results im
prove.
Pershing missiles, which would be stationed in West
Germany to counter 300 Soviet SS-20 missiles already in
stalled and aimed at Western Europe, are now the subject
of arms-control negotiations in Geneva. The Senate ap
propriations bill includes money for the Pershing and the
Reagan administration has been anxious to maintain
funding so as not to disturb relations with NATO allies.
Reactions to draft decision vary
Washington — An American Civil Liberties Union
lawyer and other opponents of the draft said yesterday

that a court decision dismissing draft registration pro
ceedings against a Pasadena, Calif., man have sounded
the "death knell" for registration.
The Department of Justice countered that the ruling
Monday bv U.S. District Judge Terry Hatter in Los An
geles had onlv limited impact. It said it will proceed with
investigations and prosecutions ol nonregistrants in a
routine manner throughout the country.
Speaking for the department, Arthur Brill, deputy di
rector of public affairs, said the government would ap
peal Hatter's findings that the government had practiced
"discriminatory prosecution" in the case of David Alan
Wavte and had revived registration in an invalid manner.
David Landau, ACLU legislative counsel, said that
"Judge Hatter had no choice" but to rule as he did and
that his decision will have "enormous significance for
other cases."
Barry Lvnn. president of Draft Action, an anti-draft
group who appeared with Landau at a press conference at
the ACLU's Washington office, said: "It would be ir
responsible and venal for the Justice Department to con
tinue to indict or bring to trial resisters while this case is
on its slow appeal."
But the Department of Justice served notice that it will
proceed with the 150 to 200 investigations of failure to
register that it is now conducting throughout the country.
Noting that the government so far has obtained 13 in
dictments and won four convictions, department spokes
man Brill said the issue of discriminatory prosecution
had been raised and lost bv defendants in three of the four
cases.
Angola frees three Americans
Lusaka, Zambia — Two American mercenaries im
prisoned for seven vears and a Washington, D.C.-area ci
vilian pilot were flying to Paris after their release by
Angola vesterday in a complex swap that involved six na
tions, the Red Cross and a guerrilla organization.
In exchange for the Americans, the liberal Union for
the Total Independence of Angola freed two Soviet
airmen; South Africa released a Soviet warrant officer
and the bodies of four other Russians, 94 Angolan sol
diers, a Cuban soldier and the body of another Cuban;
and Angola returned the bodies of three South Africans.
The exchange was carried out here under the auspices of
the Geveva-based International Committee of the Red
Cross.
The Zambian government imposed stringent security
at the airport where the swap took place. Dozens of sol
diers prevented reporters access to the released prisoners.
The balcony of the airport terminal was closed, but from
about 200 yards away the three Americans, mercenaries
Gustavo Grillo and Gary Acker, and civilian pilot Geof
frey Tyler, appeared all right and disembarked without
assistance from a twin-engine Red Cross plane that Hew
from Luanda, Angola. A second similar Red Cross plane
brought the bodies of the South Africans.
The swap had been under negotiation in seven capitals
on three continents for almost two years and had been
scheduled to happen several times before yesterday's suc
cessful exchange.
Zambia was a key participant because it provided a
neutral site as a termination point for a series of Red
Cross flights criss-crossing Southern Africa, ending more
than two years of negotiations over one of the most com
plicated prisoner exchanges in history.
Hussein says Iraqi war to continue
Baghdad, Iraq — President Saddam Hussein said yes
terday that attempts to find a negotiated settlement to the
war with Iran had failed and that Iraq would fight on in
definitely under his leadership to secure its borders.
Hussein, who usually refersto himself in the third per
son, dismissed as "silly" Iran's proposal that his resigna
tion could lead to a restoration of peace, saying "Saddam
Hussein is staying" even if the war lasts 10 years.
"The war will continue until our enemy respects us and
respectsour independence," hetoldagroupof U. S.jour
nalists. "There is no other choice. We have tried every
means, knocked on all the doors. We have nothing before
us but to fight.".

He said Iran still held the two small pockets of Iraqi
territory southeast of Baghdad — one near Basra and the
other near Abu Ghurbv. The Iraqi army, he said, was per
forming well. and had repulsed Iranian attacks during the
border fighting this week, capturing many tanks and in
flicting heavy casualties.
Significantly, though. Hussein made no demands ot
Iran other than that it cease hostilities, withdraw Irom
Iraqi territory and not interfere in internal affairs. He
threatened no new"offensives and his tone made it clear
that Iraq would like to end the 25-month-old war at the
negotiating table rather than on the battlefield.
His remarks were made at the first press conference he
has ever held with American journalists. Western
diplomats viewed the meeting as further evidence that the
Iraqi ruler was skeptical of his relationship with Moscow
and sought a gradual normalization of ties with Washing
ton.
Soviets criticize U.S. sanctions policy
Moscow — The Soviet Union's foreign trade minister
told 250 leading American businessmen yesterday that
the U.S. government should renounce "once and for all"
the use of trade sanctions as a weapon.
Opening the first full meeting of the US-USSR Trade
Council in four vears. Foreign Trade Minister Nikolai
Patolichev said the Soviet Union is interested in expand
ing business with American suppliers but only when it has
"complete confidence that agreements will not be bro
ken." .
"Without that confidence, no businessman will sign a
deal." he said.
His criticism of the use of trade sanctions against the
Soviet Union by- the Carter and Reagan administrations
was echoed bv a stalwart of President Reagan's Re
publican Partv, Sen. Bob Dole (R-Kan.).
In a speech prepared for delivery to the council last
night. Dole said U.S. trade restrictions should not be im
posed for foreign policy reasons unless bilateral ties are
curtailed across the board. He also said there should be
no restrictions on sales of non-strategic goods to the Sovi
et Union.
Patolichev said the United States share of Soviet im
ports was far below the potential and had slumped be
cause of Washington's political moves against the Sovi
ets, including President Jimmy Carter's partial embargo
on grain sales and Reagan's restrictions on sales of tech
nology.
Presidents, chief executive officers and other represent
atives of 125 U.S. companies are attending the three-day
meeting with representatives of Soviet state enterprises at
a Moscow hotel. There was speculation that the new
Communist Partv chief. Yuri Andropov, or another
member of the ruling Politburo would speak at the
Kremlin dinner that will close the conference tomorrow
night.
Gene research agency requested
Washington — The President's Commission on
Bioethics yesterday recommended that the government
establish a permanent agency to oversee future work in
genetic engineering.
Alex Capron, executive director of the commission,
told a House subcommittee that after two years of study,
the panel found no gene-splicing work, either in the plan
ning stages or under way, that is of any "fundamental
danger to human values, social norms or ethical prin
ciples."
He said religious groups that had asked for the study
were wrong in their perception of a danger to ethics in
gene engineering, but right in saying that there is a lack of
government oversight of the problem.
While no ethical problems have developed thus far in
nine years of gene engineering work, Capron told the
House Science and Technology oversight subcommittee
that important ethical crossroads will be reached in the
future — especially if science achieves the ability to trans
plant genes from animal to man or vice versa.
If things are to be added and subtracted from human
genes, Capron said, "it may ... be fruitful to clarify what
it is about human beings that is unique — whether it is the

sum ol'their characteristics or the t»o«
characteristics. iSlon °fDan

Reagan Attacks jobs proposal
New Orleans — President Reagan yesterday struck hard at critics of his
economic policy, rejecting their proposal for a public works program to re
lieve unemployment, and insisting that his defense budget and tax cuts re
main untouched.
Although Senate Republicans and House Democrats will introduce job
creating bills when Congress returns for its lame-duck session later this
month, the president strongly opposes any such legislation.
"Let's quit kidding ourselves: We will not solve the problems of un
employed auto workers and steel workers with another giant, temporary,
public works program," Reagan said. "The answers to the challenges of the
'80s do not lie in the make-work programs of the '60s and '70s. What the
unemployed need most is a broad-based economic recovery."
Scorning proposals designed to hire the unemployed to repair highways
and bridges, he said: "Our decade-long trend of rising unemployment was
not caused by highway potholes."
Reagan vowed to persist in his efforts to cut the non-defense share of fed
eral spending in order to reduce the looming federal budget deficit.
"If the United States is to meet its investment challenge, we must get the
growth of non-defense spending under control once and for all," Reagan
said. The president has put himself on a political collision course with the
advocates of reduced defense spending, a group that includes some influen
tial Congressional Republicans as well as most Democrats.
Reagan emphatically rejected critics' arguments that
his policies may have worsened the budget problem. "A
propaganda campaign would have you believe these defi
cits are caused by our so-called massive tax cut and de
fense buildup," he said.

The two foreign ministers agreed, Tass noted, that a
"political dialog" should continue between Moscow and
Peking The first round of exploratory talks on Sino-So
viet relations after a three-year hiatus took place last
month in Peking at the vice-ministerial level and a second
round is expected to begin in Moscow later this year or
earlv in 1983.
Gromvko, Tass reported, said that the Soviet leader
ship attaches great significance to normalizing relations
with China and that it "w ill continue striving for these re
lations to be switched to lines of good-neighborliness."
Huang, who was in Moscow to attend Leonid
Bre/hnev's funeral on Monday, appeared to take a more
restrained stance. Tass quoted the Chinese foreign min
ister as saving that he hoped through mutual efforts that
relations "will be gradually normalized."
Defense budget survives first test
Washington — In the first post-election test of Presi
dent Reagan's proposed defense budget, a House Ap
propriations subcommittee voted to fund in fiscal 1983
all the major weapons systems the administration sup
ports except for the controversial Pershing 2 missile.
"1 here had b<*en speculation that Democratic gains in
the Nov. 2 election would leave C ongress less inclined
than before to go along with the president's large pro
posed defense buildup, and it may yet be curtailed on the
House and Senate floors.
but mi?, subcommittee is very conscious of the com
munist threat," said Charles Wilson (D-Tex.), explaining
the reluctance vesterday to make military spending cuts.
"It's a very hawkish subcommittee."
Subcommittee members said $498 million was deleted
for procurement of Pershing 2 missiles, a central element
in plans to modernize NATO's nuclear arsenal in Eu
rope, because of unresolved technical problems rather
than opposition to the missile itself. The Pershing failed
in its first two tests and a third was postponed.
'• The Pershing has not had one successful flight," said
Chairman Joseph Addabbo (D-N.Y.), adding that he ex
pected the subcommittee action to be upheld on the floor
of the House. Other congressmen said money for the in
termediate-range missile can easily be added in a sup
plemental appropriation later this year if test results im
prove.
Pershing missiles, which would be stationed in West
Germany to counter 300 Soviet SS-20 missiles already in
stalled and aimed at Western Europe, are now the subject
of arms-control negotiations in Geneva. The Senate ap
propriations bill includes money for the Pershing and the
Reagan administration has been anxious to maintain
funding so as not to disturb relations with NATO allies.
Reactions to draft decision vary
Washington — An American Civil Liberties Union
lawyer and other opponents of the draft said yesterday

that a court decision dismissing draft registration pro
ceedings against a Pasadena, Calif., man have sounded
the "death knell" for registration.
The Department of Justice countered that the ruling
Monday bv U.S. District Judge Terry Hatter in Los An
geles had onlv limited impact. It said it will proceed with
investigations and prosecutions ol nonregistrants in a
routine manner throughout the country.
Speaking for the department, Arthur Brill, deputy di
rector of public affairs, said the government would ap
peal Hatter's findings that the government had practiced
"discriminatory prosecution" in the case of David Alan
Wavte and had revived registration in an invalid manner.
David Landau, ACLU legislative counsel, said that
"Judge Hatter had no choice" but to rule as he did and
that his decision will have "enormous significance for
other cases."
Barry Lvnn. president of Draft Action, an anti-draft
group who appeared with Landau at a press conference at
the ACLU's Washington office, said: "It would be ir
responsible and venal for the Justice Department to con
tinue to indict or bring to trial resisters while this case is
on its slow appeal."
But the Department of Justice served notice that it will
proceed with the 150 to 200 investigations of failure to
register that it is now conducting throughout the country.
Noting that the government so far has obtained 13 in
dictments and won four convictions, department spokes
man Brill said the issue of discriminatory prosecution
had been raised and lost bv defendants in three of the four
cases.
Angola frees three Americans
Lusaka, Zambia — Two American mercenaries im
prisoned for seven vears and a Washington, D.C.-area ci
vilian pilot were flying to Paris after their release by
Angola vesterday in a complex swap that involved six na
tions, the Red Cross and a guerrilla organization.
In exchange for the Americans, the liberal Union for
the Total Independence of Angola freed two Soviet
airmen; South Africa released a Soviet warrant officer
and the bodies of four other Russians, 94 Angolan sol
diers, a Cuban soldier and the body of another Cuban;
and Angola returned the bodies of three South Africans.
The exchange was carried out here under the auspices of
the Geveva-based International Committee of the Red
Cross.
The Zambian government imposed stringent security
at the airport where the swap took place. Dozens of sol
diers prevented reporters access to the released prisoners.
The balcony of the airport terminal was closed, but from
about 200 yards away the three Americans, mercenaries
Gustavo Grillo and Gary Acker, and civilian pilot Geof
frey Tyler, appeared all right and disembarked without
assistance from a twin-engine Red Cross plane that Hew
from Luanda, Angola. A second similar Red Cross plane
brought the bodies of the South Africans.
The swap had been under negotiation in seven capitals
on three continents for almost two years and had been
scheduled to happen several times before yesterday's suc
cessful exchange.
Zambia was a key participant because it provided a
neutral site as a termination point for a series of Red
Cross flights criss-crossing Southern Africa, ending more
than two years of negotiations over one of the most com
plicated prisoner exchanges in history.
Hussein says Iraqi war to continue
Baghdad, Iraq — President Saddam Hussein said yes
terday that attempts to find a negotiated settlement to the
war with Iran had failed and that Iraq would fight on in
definitely under his leadership to secure its borders.
Hussein, who usually refersto himself in the third per
son, dismissed as "silly" Iran's proposal that his resigna
tion could lead to a restoration of peace, saying "Saddam
Hussein is staying" even if the war lasts 10 years.
"The war will continue until our enemy respects us and
respectsour independence," hetoldagroupof U. S.jour
nalists. "There is no other choice. We have tried every
means, knocked on all the doors. We have nothing before
us but to fight.".

He said Iran still held the two small pockets of Iraqi
territory southeast of Baghdad — one near Basra and the
other near Abu Ghurbv. The Iraqi army, he said, was per
forming well. and had repulsed Iranian attacks during the
border fighting this week, capturing many tanks and in
flicting heavy casualties.
Significantly, though. Hussein made no demands ot
Iran other than that it cease hostilities, withdraw Irom
Iraqi territory and not interfere in internal affairs. He
threatened no new"offensives and his tone made it clear
that Iraq would like to end the 25-month-old war at the
negotiating table rather than on the battlefield.
His remarks were made at the first press conference he
has ever held with American journalists. Western
diplomats viewed the meeting as further evidence that the
Iraqi ruler was skeptical of his relationship with Moscow
and sought a gradual normalization of ties with Washing
ton.
Soviets criticize U.S. sanctions policy
Moscow — The Soviet Union's foreign trade minister
told 250 leading American businessmen yesterday that
the U.S. government should renounce "once and for all"
the use of trade sanctions as a weapon.
Opening the first full meeting of the US-USSR Trade
Council in four vears. Foreign Trade Minister Nikolai
Patolichev said the Soviet Union is interested in expand
ing business with American suppliers but only when it has
"complete confidence that agreements will not be bro
ken." .
"Without that confidence, no businessman will sign a
deal." he said.
His criticism of the use of trade sanctions against the
Soviet Union by- the Carter and Reagan administrations
was echoed bv a stalwart of President Reagan's Re
publican Partv, Sen. Bob Dole (R-Kan.).
In a speech prepared for delivery to the council last
night. Dole said U.S. trade restrictions should not be im
posed for foreign policy reasons unless bilateral ties are
curtailed across the board. He also said there should be
no restrictions on sales of non-strategic goods to the Sovi
et Union.
Patolichev said the United States share of Soviet im
ports was far below the potential and had slumped be
cause of Washington's political moves against the Sovi
ets, including President Jimmy Carter's partial embargo
on grain sales and Reagan's restrictions on sales of tech
nology.
Presidents, chief executive officers and other represent
atives of 125 U.S. companies are attending the three-day
meeting with representatives of Soviet state enterprises at
a Moscow hotel. There was speculation that the new
Communist Partv chief. Yuri Andropov, or another
member of the ruling Politburo would speak at the
Kremlin dinner that will close the conference tomorrow
night.
Gene research agency requested
Washington — The President's Commission on
Bioethics yesterday recommended that the government
establish a permanent agency to oversee future work in
genetic engineering.
Alex Capron, executive director of the commission,
told a House subcommittee that after two years of study,
the panel found no gene-splicing work, either in the plan
ning stages or under way, that is of any "fundamental
danger to human values, social norms or ethical prin
ciples."
He said religious groups that had asked for the study
were wrong in their perception of a danger to ethics in
gene engineering, but right in saying that there is a lack of
government oversight of the problem.
While no ethical problems have developed thus far in
nine years of gene engineering work, Capron told the
House Science and Technology oversight subcommittee
that important ethical crossroads will be reached in the
future — especially if science achieves the ability to trans
plant genes from animal to man or vice versa.
If things are to be added and subtracted from human
genes, Capron said, "it may ... be fruitful to clarify what
it is about human beings that is unique — whether it is the

sum ol'their characteristics or the t»o«
characteristics. iSlon °fDan

Reagan Attacks jobs proposal
New Orleans — President Reagan yesterday struck hard at critics of his
economic policy, rejecting their proposal for a public works program to re
lieve unemployment, and insisting that his defense budget and tax cuts re
main untouched.
Although Senate Republicans and House Democrats will introduce job
creating bills when Congress returns for its lame-duck session later this
month, the president strongly opposes any such legislation.
"Let's quit kidding ourselves: We will not solve the problems of un
employed auto workers and steel workers with another giant, temporary,
public works program," Reagan said. "The answers to the challenges of the
'80s do not lie in the make-work programs of the '60s and '70s. What the
unemployed need most is a broad-based economic recovery."
Scorning proposals designed to hire the unemployed to repair highways
and bridges, he said: "Our decade-long trend of rising unemployment was
not caused by highway potholes."
Reagan vowed to persist in his efforts to cut the non-defense share of fed
eral spending in order to reduce the looming federal budget deficit.
"If the United States is to meet its investment challenge, we must get the
growth of non-defense spending under control once and for all," Reagan
said. The president has put himself on a political collision course with the
advocates of reduced defense spending, a group that includes some influen
tial Congressional Republicans as well as most Democrats.
Reagan emphatically rejected critics' arguments that
his policies may have worsened the budget problem. "A
propaganda campaign would have you believe these defi
cits are caused by our so-called massive tax cut and de
fense buildup," he said.
Sino-Soviet exchange promising
Moscow — The foreign ministers of China and the So
viet Union met here yesterday in the highest level of con
tact between the two countries in 13 years, a step that con
firmed the new Kremlin leadership's intention efforts to
improve Sino-Soviet relations after two decades of enmi
ty.
[ he meeting was unlikely to result in a breakthrough in
relations, but it could speed a rapproachment between
the two dominant powers on the Asian continent,
Western analysts said.
The official Tass news agency said the meeting between
Huang Hua of China and Andrei Gromyko of the Soviet
Union involved "a brief exchange of opinions on matters
of interest to both sides."

"political dialog" should continue between Moscow and

relations "will be gradually normalized."
Defense budget survives first test
Washington — In the first post-election test of Presi
dent Reagan's proposed defense budget, a House Ap
propriations subcommittee voted to fund in fiscal 1983
all the major weapons systems the administration sup
ports except for the controversial Pershing 2 missile.
"1 here had b<*en speculation that Democratic gains in
the Nov. 2 election would leave C ongress less inclined
than before to go along with the president's large pro
posed defense buildup, and it may yet be curtailed on the
House and Senate floors.
but mi?, subcommittee is very conscious of the com
munist threat," said Charles Wilson (D-Tex.), explaining
the reluctance vesterday to make military spending cuts.
"It's a very hawkish subcommittee."
Subcommittee members said $498 million was deleted
for procurement of Pershing 2 missiles, a central element
in plans to modernize NATO's nuclear arsenal in Eu
rope, because of unresolved technical problems rather
than opposition to the missile itself. The Pershing failed
in its first two tests and a third was postponed.
'• The Pershing has not had one successful flight," said
Chairman Joseph Addabbo (D-N.Y.), adding that he ex
pected the subcommittee action to be upheld on the floor
of the House. Other congressmen said money for the in
termediate-range missile can easily be added in a sup
plemental appropriation later this year if test results im
prove.
Pershing missiles, which would be stationed in West
Germany to counter 300 Soviet SS-20 missiles already in
stalled and aimed at Western Europe, are now the subject
of arms-control negotiations in Geneva. The Senate ap
propriations bill includes money for the Pershing and the
Reagan administration has been anxious to maintain
funding so as not to disturb relations with NATO allies.
Reactions to draft decision vary
Washington — An American Civil Liberties Union
lawyer and other opponents of the draft said yesterday

that a court decision dismissing draft registration pro
ceedings against a Pasadena, Calif., man have sounded
the "death knell" for registration.
The Department of Justice countered that the ruling
Monday bv U.S. District Judge Terry Hatter in Los An
geles had onlv limited impact. It said it will proceed with
investigations and prosecutions ol nonregistrants in a
routine manner throughout the country.
Speaking for the department, Arthur Brill, deputy di
rector of public affairs, said the government would ap
peal Hatter's findings that the government had practiced
"discriminatory prosecution" in the case of David Alan
Wavte and had revived registration in an invalid manner.
David Landau, ACLU legislative counsel, said that
"Judge Hatter had no choice" but to rule as he did and
that his decision will have "enormous significance for
other cases."
Barry Lvnn. president of Draft Action, an anti-draft
group who appeared with Landau at a press conference at
the ACLU's Washington office, said: "It would be ir
responsible and venal for the Justice Department to con
tinue to indict or bring to trial resisters while this case is
on its slow appeal."
But the Department of Justice served notice that it will
proceed with the 150 to 200 investigations of failure to
register that it is now conducting throughout the country.
Noting that the government so far has obtained 13 in
dictments and won four convictions, department spokes
man Brill said the issue of discriminatory prosecution
had been raised and lost bv defendants in three of the four
cases.
Angola frees three Americans
Lusaka, Zambia — Two American mercenaries im
prisoned for seven vears and a Washington, D.C.-area ci
vilian pilot were flying to Paris after their release by
Angola vesterday in a complex swap that involved six na
tions, the Red Cross and a guerrilla organization.
In exchange for the Americans, the liberal Union for
the Total Independence of Angola freed two Soviet
airmen; South Africa released a Soviet warrant officer
and the bodies of four other Russians, 94 Angolan sol
diers, a Cuban soldier and the body of another Cuban;
and Angola returned the bodies of three South Africans.
The exchange was carried out here under the auspices of
the Geveva-based International Committee of the Red
Cross.
The Zambian government imposed stringent security
at the airport where the swap took place. Dozens of sol
diers prevented reporters access to the released prisoners.
The balcony of the airport terminal was closed, but from
about 200 yards away the three Americans, mercenaries
Gustavo Grillo and Gary Acker, and civilian pilot Geof
frey Tyler, appeared all right and disembarked without
assistance from a twin-engine Red Cross plane that Hew
from Luanda, Angola. A second similar Red Cross plane
brought the bodies of the South Africans.
The swap had been under negotiation in seven capitals
on three continents for almost two years and had been
scheduled to happen several times before yesterday's suc
cessful exchange.
Zambia was a key participant because it provided a
neutral site as a termination point for a series of Red
Cross flights criss-crossing Southern Africa, ending more
than two years of negotiations over one of the most com
plicated prisoner exchanges in history.
Hussein says Iraqi war to continue
Baghdad, Iraq — President Saddam Hussein said yes
terday that attempts to find a negotiated settlement to the
war with Iran had failed and that Iraq would fight on in
definitely under his leadership to secure its borders.
Hussein, who usually refersto himself in the third per
son, dismissed as "silly" Iran's proposal that his resigna
tion could lead to a restoration of peace, saying "Saddam
Hussein is staying" even if the war lasts 10 years.
"The war will continue until our enemy respects us and
respectsour independence," hetoldagroupof U. S.jour
nalists. "There is no other choice. We have tried every
means, knocked on all the doors. We have nothing before
us but to fight.".

He said Iran still held the two small pockets of Iraqi
territory southeast of Baghdad — one near Basra and the
other near Abu Ghurbv. The Iraqi army, he said, was per
forming well. and had repulsed Iranian attacks during the
border fighting this week, capturing many tanks and in
flicting heavy casualties.
Significantly, though. Hussein made no demands ot
Iran other than that it cease hostilities, withdraw Irom
Iraqi territory and not interfere in internal affairs. He
threatened no new"offensives and his tone made it clear
that Iraq would like to end the 25-month-old war at the
negotiating table rather than on the battlefield.
His remarks were made at the first press conference he
has ever held with American journalists. Western
diplomats viewed the meeting as further evidence that the
Iraqi ruler was skeptical of his relationship with Moscow
and sought a gradual normalization of ties with Washing
ton.
Soviets criticize U.S. sanctions policy
Moscow — The Soviet Union's foreign trade minister
told 250 leading American businessmen yesterday that
the U.S. government should renounce "once and for all"
the use of trade sanctions as a weapon.
Opening the first full meeting of the US-USSR Trade
Council in four vears. Foreign Trade Minister Nikolai
Patolichev said the Soviet Union is interested in expand
ing business with American suppliers but only when it has
"complete confidence that agreements will not be bro
ken." .
"Without that confidence, no businessman will sign a
deal." he said.
His criticism of the use of trade sanctions against the
Soviet Union by- the Carter and Reagan administrations
was echoed bv a stalwart of President Reagan's Re
publican Partv, Sen. Bob Dole (R-Kan.).
In a speech prepared for delivery to the council last
night. Dole said U.S. trade restrictions should not be im
posed for foreign policy reasons unless bilateral ties are
curtailed across the board. He also said there should be
no restrictions on sales of non-strategic goods to the Sovi
et Union.
Patolichev said the United States share of Soviet im
ports was far below the potential and had slumped be
cause of Washington's political moves against the Sovi
ets, including President Jimmy Carter's partial embargo
on grain sales and Reagan's restrictions on sales of tech
nology.
Presidents, chief executive officers and other represent
atives of 125 U.S. companies are attending the three-day
meeting with representatives of Soviet state enterprises at
a Moscow hotel. There was speculation that the new
Communist Partv chief. Yuri Andropov, or another
member of the ruling Politburo would speak at the
Kremlin dinner that will close the conference tomorrow
night.
Gene research agency requested
Washington — The President's Commission on
Bioethics yesterday recommended that the government
establish a permanent agency to oversee future work in
genetic engineering.
Alex Capron, executive director of the commission,
told a House subcommittee that after two years of study,
the panel found no gene-splicing work, either in the plan
ning stages or under way, that is of any "fundamental
danger to human values, social norms or ethical prin
ciples."
He said religious groups that had asked for the study
were wrong in their perception of a danger to ethics in
gene engineering, but right in saying that there is a lack of
government oversight of the problem.
While no ethical problems have developed thus far in
nine years of gene engineering work, Capron told the
House Science and Technology oversight subcommittee
that important ethical crossroads will be reached in the
future — especially if science achieves the ability to trans
plant genes from animal to man or vice versa.
If things are to be added and subtracted from human
genes, Capron said, "it may ... be fruitful to clarify what
it is about human beings that is unique — whether it is the

sum ol'their characteristics or the t»o«
characteristics. iSlon °fDan
