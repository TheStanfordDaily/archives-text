Reagan Attacks jobs proposal
New Orleans — President Reagan yesterday struck hard at critics of his
economic policy, rejecting their proposal for a public works program to re
lieve unemployment, and insisting that his defense budget and tax cuts re
main untouched.
Although Senate Republicans and House Democrats will introduce job
creating bills when Congress returns for its lame-duck session later this
month, the president strongly opposes any such legislation.
"Let's quit kidding ourselves: We will not solve the problems of un
employed auto workers and steel workers with another giant, temporary,
public works program," Reagan said. "The answers to the challenges of the
'80s do not lie in the make-work programs of the '60s and '70s. What the
unemployed need most is a broad-based economic recovery."
Scorning proposals designed to hire the unemployed to repair highways
and bridges, he said: "Our decade-long trend of rising unemployment was
not caused by highway potholes."
Reagan vowed to persist in his efforts to cut the non-defense share of fed
eral spending in order to reduce the looming federal budget deficit.
"If the United States is to meet its investment challenge, we must get the
growth of non-defense spending under control once and for all," Reagan
said. The president has put himself on a political collision course with the
advocates of reduced defense spending, a group that includes some influen
tial Congressional Republicans as well as most Democrats.
