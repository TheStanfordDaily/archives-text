Are you fed up with food ser
vice?
Does the Domino's pizza man
know your name, hometown and
class schedule?
Are you tired of turning to the
restaurant page for advice, and
finding only places that you hope
you'll be able to afford once you
graduate?
If you have answered yes to
any of these questions (or if you
just like great food at reasonable
prices)* then I've got the place for
you.
The Good Earth, on the corner
of University and Emerson, of
fers a wide variety of sandwiches,
salads and entrees. The restau
rant primarily offers vegetarian
dishes, but it does have its fair
share of turkey, beef and seafood
dishes.
As we entered, we immediately
noticed the distinct aroma of cin
namon and clove, probably from
their house tea blend. We were
seated in a comfortable booth
and looked out over the rest of
the restaurant which was deco
rated in earth tones of rust, beige
and brown. Plants were ev
erywhere, giving the restaurant
an extra "earthy" touch.
It took us quite a while to
choose from the extensive menu.
The choices we faced included
the Key Largo shrimp salad
($6.95), the Californian ($4.55 —
a sandwich with roast beefortur

key, melted cheese and avocado),
beef Stroganoff ($7.75) and a
wide variety of omelettes ($3.75
to $4.95).
I chose the Country French
Lasagna ($5.95), made with
spinach pasta, six cheeses,
mushrooms and red and white
sauces. My entree also included
soup or salad, and a 10-grain
roll. My partner ordered the
Fresh Spinach Salad ($4.55 for a
large), which was also served
with a roll.
Being the food-lovers we are,
we also each ordered fruit shakes
($1.95), a featured item at the
Good Earth. Both the Berry
Shake and the Super Starter (a
strawberry and melon concoc
tion) were delicious in spite of the
fact that they were actually
healthy for us — high protein
powder, natural honey and
frozen yogurt are added to all
shakes.
My lasagna was not what you
would expect to find at a typical
Italian restaurant — in fact, it
was much better. The
mushrooms, spinach pasta and
abundance of cheese made up for
the lack of meat. It was also
served with sprouts on the side
(the California way, I guess).
The spinach salad looked ex
cellent with tomatoes, sprouts,
chopped eggs and baco-bits atop
it. Mv partner (who is not one for
superlatives) proclaimed it
"good." (She later added that it
was "tastv," deciding that the

Tonv Tran/ Daily

salad deserved better than a mere
"good.")
One of the highlights of the
meal were the 10-grain rolls. The
Good Earth states that their ten
grain bread is "the ultimate in
taste experience and nutritional
goodness." They are definitely
right about the taste experience
— we were served two rolls each
and would have loved to finish
them. The only thing that
stopped us was knowing we had
to order dessert.
Everything looked tempting.
We thought about ordering apple
pie ($ 1.75) or carrot cake ($ 1.75),
but we ended up splitting the hot
berrv cobbler ($1.95), served on
(guess what) a whole-grain crust.
(Even the dessert is healthy!)
The waitress looked surprised
when we ordered dessert. Per
haps she's not used to such hearty
eaters, or perhaps we went a little
bit overboard. In any case, I
would suggest that you order a
shake or dessert and not both.
After our meal, we thought
that we had discovered a real
find: a restaurant with excellent
food, reasonable prices and
prompt service. As we left (at
about 7 p.m. on a weeknight) we
realized that we were not the only
ones to have discovered the
Good Earth — the many people
waiting outside and in the lobby
had also obviously discovered
this wonderful restaurant.
Don't be fooled by your con
servative friends who think tha
the Good Earth is just a place for
people who love sprouts and/or
live in a co-op. .This restaurant
has something for everyone, at
very affordable prices.
The Good Earth is open from
7:30 a.m. till 10 p.m. every day.

ones to have discovered the
Good Earth — the many people
waiting outside and in the lobby
had also obviously discovered
this wonderful restaurant.

servative friends who think tha
the Good Earth is just a place for
people who love sprouts and/or
live in a co-op. .This restaurant

THE GOOD EARTH
18S University Avenue

Are you fed up with food ser
vice?
Does the Domino's pizza man
know your name, hometown and
class schedule?
Are you tired of turning to the
restaurant page for advice, and
finding only places that you hope
you'll be able to afford once you
graduate?
If you have answered yes to
any of these questions (or if you
just like great food at reasonable
prices)* then I've got the place for
you.
The Good Earth, on the corner
of University and Emerson, of
fers a wide variety of sandwiches,
salads and entrees. The restau
rant primarily offers vegetarian
dishes, but it does have its fair
share of turkey, beef and seafood
dishes.
As we entered, we immediately
noticed the distinct aroma of cin
namon and clove, probably from
their house tea blend. We were
seated in a comfortable booth
and looked out over the rest of
the restaurant which was deco
rated in earth tones of rust, beige
and brown. Plants were ev
erywhere, giving the restaurant
an extra "earthy" touch.
It took us quite a while to
choose from the extensive menu.
The choices we faced included
the Key Largo shrimp salad
($6.95), the Californian ($4.55 —
a sandwich with roast beefortur

key, melted cheese and avocado),
beef Stroganoff ($7.75) and a
wide variety of omelettes ($3.75
to $4.95).
I chose the Country French
Lasagna ($5.95), made with
spinach pasta, six cheeses,
mushrooms and red and white
sauces. My entree also included
soup or salad, and a 10-grain
roll. My partner ordered the
Fresh Spinach Salad ($4.55 for a
large), which was also served
with a roll.
Being the food-lovers we are,
we also each ordered fruit shakes
($1.95), a featured item at the
Good Earth. Both the Berry
Shake and the Super Starter (a
strawberry and melon concoc
tion) were delicious in spite of the
fact that they were actually
healthy for us — high protein
powder, natural honey and
frozen yogurt are added to all
shakes.
My lasagna was not what you
would expect to find at a typical
Italian restaurant — in fact, it
was much better. The
mushrooms, spinach pasta and
abundance of cheese made up for
the lack of meat. It was also
served with sprouts on the side
(the California way, I guess).
The spinach salad looked ex
cellent with tomatoes, sprouts,
chopped eggs and baco-bits atop
it. Mv partner (who is not one for
superlatives) proclaimed it
"good." (She later added that it
was "tastv," deciding that the

Tonv Tran/ Daily

salad deserved better than a mere
"good.")
One of the highlights of the
meal were the 10-grain rolls. The
Good Earth states that their ten
grain bread is "the ultimate in
taste experience and nutritional
goodness." They are definitely
right about the taste experience
— we were served two rolls each
and would have loved to finish
them. The only thing that
stopped us was knowing we had
to order dessert.
Everything looked tempting.
We thought about ordering apple
pie ($ 1.75) or carrot cake ($ 1.75),
but we ended up splitting the hot
berrv cobbler ($1.95), served on
(guess what) a whole-grain crust.
(Even the dessert is healthy!)
The waitress looked surprised
when we ordered dessert. Per
haps she's not used to such hearty
eaters, or perhaps we went a little
bit overboard. In any case, I
would suggest that you order a
shake or dessert and not both.
After our meal, we thought
that we had discovered a real
find: a restaurant with excellent
food, reasonable prices and
prompt service. As we left (at
about 7 p.m. on a weeknight) we
realized that we were not the only
ones to have discovered the
Good Earth — the many people
waiting outside and in the lobby
had also obviously discovered
