There's something deceptively casual
about this place. Perhaps it's the name. Per
haps it's the wooden sign hanging over the
door which reads "Dinner — Lunch —
Whiskey." Perhaps it's the location next to a
photo supply store. At any rate, when we first
drove bv Henry's Monday night, I was struck
by the sudden conviction that the blazer and
tie I was wearing were dreadfully inap
propriate.
Don't you be fooled — a quick glance can
leave you with a very faulty impression. I, for
one, made the rash decision to deposit my tie
in the back seat of the car (which made me
look like someone who'd left his tie in the
car), only to sprint back to the parking lot five
minutes later when we realized that, at Hen
ry's, ties are very much in character. It's not
The Blue Fox, but in all respects (food in
cluded), it is a classy place.
You see, in appearance all indications lead
you to believe that Henry's is a bar. Actually
it is, but half of it is also a restaurant — a fact
well-hidden until you read the sign inside
which tells you that all meals are served in
what they charmingly refer to as "the back
room."
I think if 1 ever owned a restaurant, I'd
want it to look like the back room at Henry's.
They've somehow managed to accomodate a
sizable number of tables (I imagine they seat
about 50) in a relatively small room and still
preserve intimacy even at close quarters. We
were always aware of the drone of conversa
tion that filtered our way, but it was also nev
er enough to bother us. I can only it attribute
to some mysterious acoustics.
If I weren't to tell you that Henry's is only
nine years young, you'd be easily convinced
that it was a great deal older — especially
when you note the tall ceiling and a series of
absolutely massive wooden beams running
the width of it. The whole decor blends mag
nificently: from the polite touches of brass
dotting the room, to the spotless tile floor;

from the dark, rich paneling that lends an im
mediate feeling of warmth, to the huge variety
of antique photographs and other early-part
of-the-centurv memorabilia that decorates it.
(A collection, incidentally, that has no com
mon theme, but can always spark conversa
tion if, for example, you've just finished ex
plaining your class schedule for the next two
years.)
About the only room for improvement is
with regard to the furniture: the chairs may be
good for posture, but sitting dead upright can
be more than slightly uncomfortable. To
make matters worse, our table was blessed
with one short leg, which meant that every
time I reached for the wine the entire struc
ture shifted 15 degrees. In all fairness, how
ever, considering the attention to detail

I, for one, made the rash
decision to deposit my tie in
the backseat of the car
(which made me look like
someone who'd left his tie in
the car) ...

elsewhere, these small faults are exceptions to
the rule. (I might suggest avoiding the far-left
booth, though.)
All which brings us finally to the cuisine
that graced our slightly-crooked table. Hen
ry's specializes in fresh seafood, but the menu
and a large number of nightly specials leave
you with a choice that includes such tantaliz
ing fare as top sirloin and chicken moutarde
(sauteed with shallots, mushrooms, white
wine, cream and French mustard). Even the
most selective tastes can find something to
their liking here.
After sampling from a basket of whole
wheat bread (a pleasant break from the
almost-standard French version), my compa
nion and I were greeted with the soup du jour
and garden salad respectively. The soup (split
pea, in this case) was rather tepid — I hope,

again, an oversight and not common practice.
Gladly, the salad was of a decent tem
perature.
M v main course was filet of sole meuniere
(sauteed with butter, lemon and white wine)
— not a flashy dish, bv anv means, but despite
its simplicity turned out considerably well,
albeit sampled through a liberal squeeze of
lemon. From across the table came rave re
views for the Veal Picatta, sauteed in a savory
blend of capers, brandy, white wine, lemon
juice and brown sauce: a combination we
found hard to fault. Both the and veal
came with new potatoes, grean beens and (in
terestingly enough) sweet potatoes — the veal
fetches SI 1.50 (the most expensive entree on
the regular menu) and the sole $9.75. Most of
the entrees cost little more than $10.
For dessert, you might sample the
cheesecake, which for its small size packs
more cheese (and calories) per ounce than
most I've tried. We could hardly resist the
sound of "ice cream topped with raspberries
and orange liqeur," a heavenly concoction
that deserves to be eaten quickly lest the
strong stuff settle and you find yourself, as we
did, spooning orange liqeur from a glass
bowl. Both desserts cost $2.50 and with the
addition of coffee and wine earlier on, we
thought the evening's total of slightly more
than $30 more than reasonable.
We hesitated to dine on a Monday night,
being that the week's first day is traditionally
slow for most restaurants, but we found
ourself pleasantly surprised at the presence of
quite a large crowd. Henry's thoroughly de
serves this sort of publicity — owner Michael
Skuce has arrived at a combination of fine
food, scintillating atmosphere, prompt ser
vice and relatively moderate prices that's
hard to beat. I, for one, will be back soon.
Henry's also serves a delightful lunch menu
six days a week from 11:30 a.m. to 3 p.m., in
addition to dinner from 5:30 p.m. to 10 p.m.
The bar stays open until 2 a.m. and reserva
tions are recommended.
Don't forget the tie.
