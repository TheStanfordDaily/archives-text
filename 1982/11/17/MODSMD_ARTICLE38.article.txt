THE UNIVERSITY CREAMERY

If you're looking for good American food, low prices and a
down-home truck-stop atmosphere, stop by the University
Creamery for breakfast, lunch or dinner. It's the restaurant that
your eye has passed over many times without noticing as you've
walked along University Ave. The neon sign in the window tell
you the name, and hand lettered signs announce the breakfast,
lunch and dinner specials.
We stopped in for lunch, and found a row of little, vinyl
booths and a long lunch-counter/soda fountain. The stere
otypical cigarette machine stood at the back of the restaurant
and the obligatory older men reading newspapers sat along the
counter. We seated ourselves in a booth, and the waiter brought
us our menus, which informed us that the University Creamery
had been around since 1917. Looking around, the clientele
seemed indeed to be made up of many "regulars" and "old-tim
ers." The waiter exemplified his restaurant's image perfectly,
clad somewhat casually in tennis shoes .. . and a bow tie. He
was polite and eager, and quickly became busy as the lunch
crowd began to arrive.
The menu offered us "gourmet sandwiches," home-made
soup, salads, hot sandwiches and burgers and fries. We ordered
a bacon, lettuce and tomato sandwich (53.25) and a tuna melt
($3.50). Aside from the menu, a placard on the table announced
the hot lunch specials — only $3.25 Monday through Friday
from noon to 2 p.m. They included a hot turkey sandwich with
all the trimmings, a quarter-pound burger and soup, or soup,
salad and a grilled cheese sandwich on your choice of bread.
(We arrived a bit too early to take advantage of these specials.)
In any case, our food was brought fairly soon and both sand
wiches were very good. The BLT was especially tasty, served on
a crisp baguette with pepperoncini on the side.
The restaurant also featured hot apple pie with cinnamon
sauce, or a la mode with Bud's ice cream if you prefered. The
waiter asked me which of the 10 flavors of ice cream I wanted

with my pie, and seemed relieved when I chose French vanilla
rather than bittersweet chocolate or rocky road. Unfortunately,
upon checking, the waiter found that they were out of apple pie
. . . but they did have about five other kinds. We thought this
was a bit like an Italian restaurant being out of pasta, or a
McDonald's being out of ground beef, but I compromised and
ordered a dish of Bud's coffee ice cream anyway $1.20).
The menu displayed a plentiful list of tempting soda fountain
delicacies including hot fudge sundaes, but, unable to eat anoth
er bite, we declined. We did regret, as we saw a plate of steaming
golden french fries carried by, that we hadn't sampled this item.

The waiter exemplified his restaurant's
image perfectly, clad somewhat casually in
tennis shoes ... and a bow tie. He was
polite and eager, and quickly became busy
as the lunch crowd began to arrive.

Touches without which no down-home restaurant would be
complete were all there. A heavy, swarthy cook in white shirt
sleeves and a blue polyester-clad women presided behind the
counter, football and boxing posters were in the corner, and a
black clock with glowing red numbers hung at the rear of the
restaurant. The sound of burgers sizzling away on the grill pro
vided the finishing touch.
We found the Creamery a fun place, nearby, where you could
enjov a sandwich or burger, or try some good ice cream dishes
(or maybe even sample apple pie!). If you stop by Wednesday
nights from 5-9, the restaurant offers students with a student ID
a 20 percent discount on all dishes. To our surprise, the
Creamery also features live music on Friday nights from 8:30 to
11:30 along with special prices on selected dishes. Most of their
food can be prepared for take-out. The University Creamery is
open from 6:30 a.m. to 10:30 p.m. seven days a week.

THE UNIVERSITY CREAMERY
209 University Ave.

If you're looking for good American food, low prices and a
down-home truck-stop atmosphere, stop by the University
Creamery for breakfast, lunch or dinner. It's the restaurant that
your eye has passed over many times without noticing as you've
walked along University Ave. The neon sign in the window tell
you the name, and hand lettered signs announce the breakfast,
lunch and dinner specials.
We stopped in for lunch, and found a row of little, vinyl
booths and a long lunch-counter/soda fountain. The stere
otypical cigarette machine stood at the back of the restaurant
and the obligatory older men reading newspapers sat along the
counter. We seated ourselves in a booth, and the waiter brought
us our menus, which informed us that the University Creamery
had been around since 1917. Looking around, the clientele
seemed indeed to be made up of many "regulars" and "old-tim
ers." The waiter exemplified his restaurant's image perfectly,
clad somewhat casually in tennis shoes .. . and a bow tie. He
was polite and eager, and quickly became busy as the lunch
crowd began to arrive.
The menu offered us "gourmet sandwiches," home-made
soup, salads, hot sandwiches and burgers and fries. We ordered
a bacon, lettuce and tomato sandwich (53.25) and a tuna melt
($3.50). Aside from the menu, a placard on the table announced
the hot lunch specials — only $3.25 Monday through Friday
from noon to 2 p.m. They included a hot turkey sandwich with
all the trimmings, a quarter-pound burger and soup, or soup,
salad and a grilled cheese sandwich on your choice of bread.
(We arrived a bit too early to take advantage of these specials.)
In any case, our food was brought fairly soon and both sand
wiches were very good. The BLT was especially tasty, served on
a crisp baguette with pepperoncini on the side.
The restaurant also featured hot apple pie with cinnamon
sauce, or a la mode with Bud's ice cream if you prefered. The
waiter asked me which of the 10 flavors of ice cream I wanted

with my pie, and seemed relieved when I chose French vanilla
rather than bittersweet chocolate or rocky road. Unfortunately,
upon checking, the waiter found that they were out of apple pie
. . . but they did have about five other kinds. We thought this
was a bit like an Italian restaurant being out of pasta, or a
McDonald's being out of ground beef, but I compromised and
ordered a dish of Bud's coffee ice cream anyway $1.20).
The menu displayed a plentiful list of tempting soda fountain
delicacies including hot fudge sundaes, but, unable to eat anoth
er bite, we declined. We did regret, as we saw a plate of steaming
golden french fries carried by, that we hadn't sampled this item.

Touches without which no down-home restaurant would be
complete were all there. A heavy, swarthy cook in white shirt
sleeves and a blue polyester-clad women presided behind the
counter, football and boxing posters were in the corner, and a
black clock with glowing red numbers hung at the rear of the
restaurant. The sound of burgers sizzling away on the grill pro
vided the finishing touch.
We found the Creamery a fun place, nearby, where you could
enjov a sandwich or burger, or try some good ice cream dishes
(or maybe even sample apple pie!). If you stop by Wednesday
nights from 5-9, the restaurant offers students with a student ID
a 20 percent discount on all dishes. To our surprise, the
Creamery also features live music on Friday nights from 8:30 to
11:30 along with special prices on selected dishes. Most of their
food can be prepared for take-out. The University Creamery is
open from 6:30 a.m. to 10:30 p.m. seven days a week.
