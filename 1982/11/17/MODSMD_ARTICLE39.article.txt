# Once every 50 years...

### JILL SCOBY 
LA TOUR RESTAURANT
FRANCAIS
525 University Ave.
Palo Alto
321-6954
In the week preceding this re
view, I had heard so much about
La Tour that I was especially
looking forward to an excep
tionally prepared, extravagant
and expensive French meal. (My
favorite rendition of La Tour's
ambiance went something like,
"this is the restaurant you'd take
you mother to on her 50th birth
dav," which, I supposed, could
have meant you can afford a
place like this only once every 50
years.) I was not disappointed:
La Tour exudes elegance.
The decor was decidedly plush,
but not overbearing: a color
scheme of avocado and wheat (by
this time we were so hungry hal
lucinations had overtaken us!)
nicely complemented the ornate,
darkwood furnishings. The
place-settings at each table were
very pretty; in the background we
could hear strains from the
singer/pianist we had passed on
our way in. The primary (and
perfectly adequate) source of il
lumination came from candle Son
each tabfe', Khhancing the aura of
in t i it* —
The menu itself was quite ex
tensive, including everv type of
appetizer and entree from fowl
and fish to beef and lamb. (For
expediency, I'll omit the com
plete run-down.) In addition, a
rather long list of specialties
made our ultimate choice even
more difficult (however, near
starvation overcomes even the
most indecisive!). I settled on
Homard du Maine (fresh Maine
lobster) as an appetizer ($l2)
which ,was unbelievably ex
quisite. It was served in half a
lobster shell with a white sauce
and capers; tomato, cucumber
and hard-boiled egg served as
aesthetic garnishes.
Truite fumee (sinoked trout)
was the choice of my partner ($6)
— served on a bed of lettuce with
an indescribably fantastic salad
like concoction on the side,
which we were later informed,
was made from walnut meats.
On to the salad (the pause be
tween courses was perfectly

timed); from the five offered we
decided to go for the Salade
Cesare (for two, $8.50). After
about six minutes of rest (where
we noticed the rapidity with
which the couple across from us
inhaled their food) a cart was
reeled out: our waiter began to
prepare the salad at our table.
Starting with the anchovies, he
added and sampled (we decided
to forgive him for sampling from
the fork with which he stjrred)
until he reached the perfect com
bination of vinegar, oil, cheese,
salt, pepper, egg etc. (I couldn't
see everything) was reached. (It
was a bit bitter for my tastes,
probably perfect for most oth
ers.) It was then poured over a
large bowl full of iceberg and leaf
lettuce, sprinkled with more
cheese and croutons and divided
between the two of us. All in all,
quite an impressive display for a
mere salad.
Another slightly longer period
elapsed before our entrees ar
rived. But, they were more than
worth the wait! I had veal in ap
ple brandy with apples ($15.50)
which was so fantastic I hated to
finish. The veal was about twice
as thick as a' typical, scallopini
size cutlet, smothered in brandy
sauce quite different from any
thing I'd ever had served with
veal.
Snow peas, carrots and broc
coli were also served with both
our meals: we agreed that the
Hollandaise sauce was the most
delicious we had ever tasted.
(Not being particularly fond of
broccoli, I finished the sauce,
anyway.)
However, in my opinion, the
highlight of the entire evening
was my guest's Maine lobster
($22). As served, it could have
doubled as a page out of Bon Ap
petit — it was so gorgeous. And
of course, it tasted better than it
looked (I demanded a bite). The
lobster was already cracked (ex
cept for the claws) and as far as I
could tell, was too delicious for
words. (She didn't converse
much during the entree but "suc
culent" was suggested as we later
tried to describe the in
describable!) At $22 it was the
most expensive entree — but my
partner felt the price, more or

Tony Tran/ Daily

less, reflected the excellent prepa
ration.
At this point the first waiter
complemented us on our ex
cellent appetites (being rather
weight-conscious, I stifled the de
sire to retort something snide
about just recovering from
anorexia) and informed us that
our Grand Marnier Souffle ($9
for two) would be ready shortly.
(In the meantime excellent coffee
was served at $1.25 a cup!)

At this point the first
waiter complimented
us on our excellent
appetites (being
rather weight
conscious, I stifled
the desire to retort
something snide
about just recovering
from anorexia).

The souffle had been ordered
45 minutes in advance and when
the waiter reeled out his cart with
two sugar-dusted souffles, we
knew we'd made the perfect
choice to round out our meal. As
one who believes dessert can
make or break the meal, (in this
instance I may have made an ex
ception, had the need arisen) this
was absolutely the ultimate cul
mination to an evening of cul
inary masterpieces.
As you've probably deduced,
La Tour is very expensive: The
final bill for the two of us came to
$92.50, including tax and tip. On
the other hand, nothing (with the
possible exception of the lobster
appetizer and the coffee) seemed
horrendously overpriced. And
atmosphere made up for the min
iscule difference between La
Tour and other restaurants serv
ing comparable dishes.
Obviously, this is not the place
to try if you're sick of California
Quiche and frozen vegetables.
But if you're interested in im
pressing someone, or if Mom is
soon turning 50, you'll probably
want to experience La Tour.

nicely complemented the ornate,
darkwood furnishings. The
place-settings at each table were
very pretty; in the background we
could hear strains from the
singer/pianist we had passed on
our way in. The primary (and
perfectly adequate) source of il
lumination came from candle Son
each tabfe', Khhancing the aura of
in t i it* —
The menu itself was quite ex
tensive, including everv type of
appetizer and entree from fowl
and fish to beef and lamb. (For
expediency, I'll omit the com
plete run-down.) In addition, a
rather long list of specialties
made our ultimate choice even
more difficult (however, near
starvation overcomes even the
most indecisive!). I settled on
Homard du Maine (fresh Maine
lobster) as an appetizer ($l2)
which ,was unbelievably ex
quisite. It was served in half a
lobster shell with a white sauce
and capers; tomato, cucumber
and hard-boiled egg served as
aesthetic garnishes.
Truite fumee (sinoked trout)
was the choice of my partner ($6)
— served on a bed of lettuce with
an indescribably fantastic salad
like concoction on the side,
which we were later informed,
was made from walnut meats.
On to the salad (the pause be
tween courses was perfectly

timed); from the five offered we
decided to go for the Salade
Cesare (for two, $8.50). After
about six minutes of rest (where
we noticed the rapidity with
which the couple across from us
inhaled their food) a cart was
reeled out: our waiter began to
prepare the salad at our table.
Starting with the anchovies, he
added and sampled (we decided
to forgive him for sampling from
the fork with which he stjrred)
until he reached the perfect com
bination of vinegar, oil, cheese,
salt, pepper, egg etc. (I couldn't
see everything) was reached. (It
was a bit bitter for my tastes,
probably perfect for most oth
ers.) It was then poured over a
large bowl full of iceberg and leaf
lettuce, sprinkled with more
cheese and croutons and divided
between the two of us. All in all,
quite an impressive display for a
mere salad.
Another slightly longer period
elapsed before our entrees ar
rived. But, they were more than
worth the wait! I had veal in ap
ple brandy with apples ($15.50)
which was so fantastic I hated to
finish. The veal was about twice
as thick as a' typical, scallopini
size cutlet, smothered in brandy
sauce quite different from any
thing I'd ever had served with
veal.
Snow peas, carrots and broc
coli were also served with both
our meals: we agreed that the
Hollandaise sauce was the most
delicious we had ever tasted.
(Not being particularly fond of
broccoli, I finished the sauce,
anyway.)
However, in my opinion, the
highlight of the entire evening
was my guest's Maine lobster
($22). As served, it could have
doubled as a page out of Bon Ap
petit — it was so gorgeous. And
of course, it tasted better than it
looked (I demanded a bite). The
lobster was already cracked (ex
cept for the claws) and as far as I
could tell, was too delicious for
words. (She didn't converse
much during the entree but "suc
culent" was suggested as we later
tried to describe the in
describable!) At $22 it was the
most expensive entree — but my
partner felt the price, more or

Tony Tran/ Daily

less, reflected the excellent prepa
ration.
At this point the first waiter
complemented us on our ex
cellent appetites (being rather
weight-conscious, I stifled the de
sire to retort something snide
about just recovering from
anorexia) and informed us that
our Grand Marnier Souffle ($9
for two) would be ready shortly.
(In the meantime excellent coffee
was served at $1.25 a cup!)

At this point the first
waiter complimented
us on our excellent
appetites (being
rather weight
conscious, I stifled
the desire to retort
something snide
about just recovering
from anorexia).

The souffle had been ordered
45 minutes in advance and when
the waiter reeled out his cart with
two sugar-dusted souffles, we
knew we'd made the perfect
choice to round out our meal. As
one who believes dessert can
make or break the meal, (in this
instance I may have made an ex
ception, had the need arisen) this
was absolutely the ultimate cul
mination to an evening of cul
inary masterpieces.
As you've probably deduced,
La Tour is very expensive: The
final bill for the two of us came to
$92.50, including tax and tip. On
the other hand, nothing (with the
possible exception of the lobster
appetizer and the coffee) seemed
horrendously overpriced. And
atmosphere made up for the min
iscule difference between La
Tour and other restaurants serv
ing comparable dishes.
Obviously, this is not the place
to try if you're sick of California
Quiche and frozen vegetables.
But if you're interested in im
pressing someone, or if Mom is
soon turning 50, you'll probably
want to experience La Tour.

In the week preceding this re

La Tour that I was especially
looking forward to an excep

and expensive French meal. (My
favorite rendition of La Tour's
ambiance went something like,
"this is the restaurant you'd take
you mother to on her 50th birth
dav," which, I supposed, could
have meant you can afford a
place like this only once every 50
years.) I was not disappointed:
La Tour exudes elegance.
The decor was decidedly plush,
but not overbearing: a color
scheme of avocado and wheat (by
