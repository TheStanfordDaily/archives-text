# Prices may be out of reach
## Stanford West's future cloudy 
### MIKE HALE Senior staff writer 
Local government approval is not the only hurdle facing
the University's proposed Stanford West housing develop
ment. With construction of the project's First phase slated to
begin next spring, no one is really sure how many faculty and
staff members will be able to afford the housing.
The University's construction schedule for the 1469-unit
project reflects this uncertainty. Current plans are for con
struction to be phased over a four- to seven-year period, with
groups of 200 to 300 units being built in each phase. At no
time will the University be required to complete the develop
ment â€” each phase will be designed to stand alone, and the
University will retain the right to sell the development rights
for any part of the project to outside developers.
In keeping with a board of trustees action taken last
spring, -units in Stanford West will be priced at the local per
square-foot "market rate" for both sale and rental. Housing
prices in Palo Alto are currently the highest in the nation on
a comparable-size basis, according to recent surveys.
In its report to the board on Stanford West, the University
has predicted that a one-bedroom unit will sell for between
$101,250 and $127,500 and that a three-bedroom unit with a
den will sell for between $202,500 and $255,000.
According to Robin Hamill, director of housing pro
grams, the University fears that below-market pricing of
housing would turn Stanford West into a "company town."
Hamill said the University could only sell the units at a
below-market rate if it reserved the right to determine the
owner's eventual selling price. Otherwise, she said, people
who bought units at a bargain price could at any time sell
them at the market rate and "reap a windfall gain."
"That takes the value of the l T niversity's land endowment
and gives it away," Hamill said. She added that no subse
quent purchasers of a unit would benefit from the below
market rate.
Uncontrolled, below-market sales would involve "signifi
cant development risks," Hamill said. "Occupancy (of on
campus housing) cannot be viewed as a prerogative," she

added.
However, University officials do not want to control the
resale process either. Hamill said the administration, made
up as it is of "essentially free-market economists," feels this
would amount to "social engineering that would be poten
tially destructive to the institution."
She said, "It would hit people where it hurts the most, it
would he impossible to administer and it interferes with the
free market."
(While details remain fo be worked out, it appears that 15
percent of any units built at Stanford West will be put into
Palo Alto's Below-Market-Rate housing program and
priced lower than other units. Some of these will be turned
over to Palo Alto.) I
Hamill said any housing subsidy program for faculty and
staff members would be paid "over the table," not built into
sale or rental prices. As an example of this she cited the hous
ing allowance program implemented at the Peter Coutts
condominiums, where profits from condominium sales are
being applied toward purchasers' mortgage payments. Ham
ill does not foresee a subsidy program for Stanford West,
and said that if one were developed it would be only for fac
ulty and senior staff.
Hamill admits that, in the absence of subsidies, many peo
ple may not be able to afford to purchase or rent units at
Stanford West if interest rates rise. A University affordabili
ty study showed that, given 14 percent interest rates, between
26 percent and 72 percent of faculty and staff members who
want to live on campus could not afford to live at Stanford
West.
Hamill said that just before taking bids for construction,
the University would examine the prevailing interest rates. If
rates were high, she soid, a dec'sior covild be made not to go
ahead with construction.
The wide range in the affordability study can be attributed
to the two variables the University built into it: the addi
tional income a family earns, beyond a faculty or staff mem
ber's salary, and the size of the unit a family desires. The
