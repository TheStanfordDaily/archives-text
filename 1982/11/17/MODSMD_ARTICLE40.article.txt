THE NEW VARSITY

The New Varsity Restau
rant/Theatre/Bar is one of the
nicest places to sit in Palo Alto: it
has three different kinds of seats
(indoor, outdoor and theater)
and they're all very comfortable.
This is good, because all of the
things you can do there involve
sitting. You can sit and watch a
movie; you can sit and watch
people; you can sit and hear live
music or watch videos; and you
can sit and eat. You can do all of
these things as pleasantly at the
New Varsity as anywhere in Palo
Alto. This is a restaurant review,
though, and we must admit that
the dining isn't as consistently en
joyable as the other sedentary ac
tivities. But the New Varsity does
so well in so many different ways
that this seems like a minor quib
ble, somehow.
The New Varsity occupies a
vaguely Mission/Spanish Colo
nial Revival building on Univer
sity Ave. at the upper end of
downtown Palo Alto. It was built
(under the name The Varsity) in
1927 as a smaller version of the
Fox Arlington Theatre in Santa
Barbara, one of California's
great movie palaces. Movie pal
aces eventually went out of fash
ion, and now the New Varsity op
erates as a repertory cinema,
showing a mix of classics, cult
films and recent art house fare on
the biggest screen in Palo Alto.
The New Varsity probably
shows, day in and day out, the
most interesting movies within
reasonable distance of campus.
(Its only real competition, the
nearby Festival Cinema, will be
turning off its projector forever
at the end of this year.)
' The restaurant occupies an up
stairs room, part of the lobby and
what used to be an outdoor shop
ping arcade. The outdoor tables,
where you sit in director's chairs
labeled with the names of famous
uctors and directors, are at a pre
mium in spring and summer but
find few takers this time of year.
The indoor tables are a bit
crowded, but then half the fun of
the New Varsity is hearing what
the people at the other tables are
saying. One slight problem is that
all the tables are on the way to

somewhere — in the lobby peo
ple pass back and forth on their
way from theater to concession
stand, and upstairs the traffic to
and from the women's restroom
can get heavy between shows.
You could say the New Varsity
(as restaurant) is noisy and lacks
privacy; on the other hand, you
could call it lively and stimu
lating. It just depends on your
point of view.
The New Varsity menu is se
curely within the California
mainstream, meaning there are
more dishes that come with
avocado than without. The
lunch/dinner menu isn't ex
tensive: four salads, five sand-

wiches, five burgers and six en
trees, plus nightly dinner specials
and a "crepe du jour." Fiveofthe
six entrees are vegetarian, and the
sixth is a chicken tostada — for
beef, you must resort to the ham
burgers.
We've been to the New Varsity
many times, and our review din
ner was more or less a case of the
converted being preached to. It
did confirm a few things, though.
The spinach lasagne ($5.25) has
been different everytime we've
ordered it. This time it was a
quite homogeneous green mass
— you had to really like spinach
to like this dish, because the
noodles and cheese were hard to
find. The same has been true in
the past of the avocado and
chicken tostadas ($4.95 and
$5.59), which in our experience
tend to taste like onions in salsa.
If you must eat "dinner," it's
best to try the specials, even
though they're a bit more ex
pensive. (The entrees are quite

reasonable as dinners go, run
ning from 54.75 — the
"ploughman's share," a baked
potato covered with vegetables
and cheese — to $5.95 for the
chicken tostada. Specials seem to
start at $6.95.) The special the
night of our review was an ex
cellent teriyaki chicken ($7.95),
strips of marinated chicken,
green peppers and onion on a bed
of rice. The chicken was tender
and well-spiced, the vegetables
nicely cooked; unfortunately, the
rice was crunchv. Main dishes at
the New Varsity are a hit-or-miss
proposition — from day to day
you really can't predict what will
taste good, or what they'll get

right. One of our fondest memo
ries of Palo Alto is a veal picatta
eaten five years ago as a New
Varsity special, but we'd be
scared to order the same thing
again.
The safest bets at the New
Varsitv are the salads and sand
wiches. Among the highlights:
the Chicken Oriental salad
($4.25), a mixture of marinated
chicken, water chestnuts,
noodles, almonds and raisins
that's perfect if you want a sweet,
crunchv meal; The Director
(54.25), a roast beef sandwich
with onions and tomato and
melted cheddar cheese; and the
Commonwealth burger ($4.50),
served on an English muffin with
Canadian bacon and chutney on
the side.
A dinner salad is available for
$1.25 with sandwichesor 75 cents
with entrees (we took with ours
an unusual honey and curry
dressing). Finally (ending at the

lop of the menu) the New Varsity
offers French onion soup every
night ($2.35) and a soup du jour
($1.35/51.80).
Probably the best thing about
the New Varsity, outside of its
movies, are its desserts. (Some
people would put these before the
movies.) They're not really better
than what vou can get at a lot of

other places — it's just that the
Varsity is the ideal place to sit
and eat carrot cake and drink . . .
whatever you wish. There's a full
bar, with rotating wine specials,
and an espresso machine, so you
can choose your poisons. If
you're in the mood for it, you can
choose from the usual array of
coffee drinks with cute names
(coffee with bran
dv/Kahlua/Grand
Marnier/whiskev/tequila), all of
which go well with dessert.
The New Varsity offers an ex
cellent weekend brunch, with free
admission to the day's matinee
thrown in if you spend $5. A $5
dinner purchase will get you into
that night's movie for $3. If you
go just for dessert and drinks,
show up after 8:30-9 p.m., when
tables start opening up. There's
often live music, upstairs or out
doors depending on the season,
later in the evening.
