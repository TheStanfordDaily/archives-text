# University seeks toxic waste site

### SANDRA BODOVITZ Staff writer 
Editor's note: This is the first in a two
part series concerning the disposal of tox
ic wastes. Today's article reports the
University's efforts at revising toxic
waste disposal procedures and tomor
-ow's installment considers industry
problems in disposing of toxic waste.

It was 3:30 a.m. on Oct. 27 when the
Peninsula Sanitary Service driver no
ticed that his truck load of garbage was
on fire. He quickly deposited the load
on the street between the Stanford
Museum and the orthopedic research
laboratory.
Fire-fighters soon arrived on the
scene to combat the blaze. One was in-

jured in the process.
After the fire was extinguished. Uni
versity and Palo Alto health and safety
and fire officials sorted through the
more than one ton of garbage to find
the cause. They did. They discovered
many chemical solvents and flamable
materials as well as several small flasks
of other unidentifiable chemicals.
"It was determined that the fire was
started bv the presence of chemicals,"
said Dr. Alain Decleve, director of

health and safety here. "Obviously the
disposal of chemicals in trash cans is
against Stanford policy," he added.
Toxic waste disposal is a widespread
issue for the University because large
amounts of toxic chemicals are used in
iabs and research. "Th?S little incident
points to deficiency in all levels,"
Decleve said. He has recently instituted
a disposal service that is provided
without charge to the individual depar
ments to encourage them to dispose
properly of hazardous waste materials.
Funds were appropriated by the Uni
versity general fund for the project.
"The issue of budgets and finance is a
major concern," he said.
In the new service the wastes will be
transported to an interim disposal site
on campus near the Medical Center.
According to Decleve, this site is tem
porary. The University has a three-year
permit for the interim site after which it

will be required bv the state to build a
permanent facility for "storage, treat
ment and radioactive half-life decay,"
Decleve said.
In addition, he said new incineration
facilities are needed to dispose of the
chemicals property. Ucclevc said new
facilities are needed to replace the aging
facilities at the Med Center.
The location of the permanent site
has not yet been determined. "The sit
ing is going to be a sensitive issue be
cause of the 'not in my backyard' syn
drome," Decleve said. The University
has already had objections from neigh
boring residents to proposed locations
for the site.
Decleve said he thinks the best site
for the disposal facilities would be as
near to the generators of the waste
products as possible.
