# University seeks toxic waste site
## 
### SANDRA BODOVITZ Staff writer 
Editor's note: This is the first in a two
part series concerning the disposal of tox
ic wastes. Today's article reports the
University's efforts at revising toxic
waste disposal procedures and tomor
-ow's installment considers industry
problems in disposing of toxic waste.

It was 3:30 a.m. on Oct. 27 when the
Peninsula Sanitary Service driver no
ticed that his truck load of garbage was
on fire. He quickly deposited the load
on the street between the Stanford
Museum and the orthopedic research
laboratory.
Fire-fighters soon arrived on the
scene to combat the blaze. One was in-

jured in the process.
After the fire was extinguished. Uni
versity and Palo Alto health and safety
and fire officials sorted through the
more than one ton of garbage to find
the cause. They did. They discovered
many chemical solvents and flamable
materials as well as several small flasks
of other unidentifiable chemicals.
"It was determined that the fire was
started bv the presence of chemicals,"
said Dr. Alain Decleve, director of

health and safety here. "Obviously the
disposal of chemicals in trash cans is
against Stanford policy," he added.
Toxic waste disposal is a widespread
issue for the University because large
amounts of toxic chemicals are used in
iabs and research. "Th?S little incident
points to deficiency in all levels,"
Decleve said. He has recently instituted
a disposal service that is provided
without charge to the individual depar
ments to encourage them to dispose
properly of hazardous waste materials.
Funds were appropriated by the Uni
versity general fund for the project.
"The issue of budgets and finance is a
major concern," he said.
In the new service the wastes will be
transported to an interim disposal site
on campus near the Medical Center.
According to Decleve, this site is tem
porary. The University has a three-year
permit for the interim site after which it

will be required bv the state to build a
permanent facility for "storage, treat
ment and radioactive half-life decay,"
Decleve said.
In addition, he said new incineration
facilities are needed to dispose of the
chemicals property. Ucclevc said new
facilities are needed to replace the aging
facilities at the Med Center.
The location of the permanent site
has not yet been determined. "The sit
ing is going to be a sensitive issue be
cause of the 'not in my backyard' syn
drome," Decleve said. The University
has already had objections from neigh
boring residents to proposed locations
for the site.
Decleve said he thinks the best site
for the disposal facilities would be as
near to the generators of the waste
products as possible.
The issue of toxic waste disposal, ac-


George Fujii/Daily
cording to Decleve is a "very emo
tional" one. He stressed the importance
of the "involvement of the press and the
students to educate the public."
One of Decleve's goals is to educate
individuals within the University on
proper disposal methods. His program
involves detailed inventory and storage
procedures as well as safety committees
in each department to help implement
the program.
Peter Burnes, an industrial waste in
spector for the city of Palo Alto, shares
Decleve's view that the issue has to be
brought to the personal level. "The
weakest link is not corporate
philosophies but the individuals them
selves who are handling the material,"
he said. "It comes down to basic educa
tion," he added.
Burnes explained thatalthough Stan
ford or an industry mav have a com
prehensive program for waste disposal,

"it comes down to the personal decision
of the person who uses the material
where it goes," and that this "creates a
' huge gap in the system."
One cause of the problem, Decleve
said, was the rapid growth of industry
and research without sufficient con
siderations to proper waste disposal.
"Now we have regulations that tell us to
do something but they don't tell us
how," he said.
Burnes said of Stanford's situation,
"they don't have any specificiations or
people to guide them in the man
agement of their wastes.
This is a problem that they have to
deal with and I have a great deal of con
fidence in Alain,"he added.
The University has worked closely
with city and state officials in attempts
to improve its disposal procedures. The
Hnvironmental Protection Agency
(KPA) regulations have a provision
which does not demand such strict pro
cedure for users of small amounts of

toxic materials. Stanford would nor
mally fall into the small user category,
as opposed to industries which are clas
sified as large users, but California does
not have the small user provision.
Decleve called this a "blessing in dis
guise because if we don't have to follow
regulations the people who transport it
won't deal with it."
A model ordinance written by a task
force of the Santa Clara Fire Chiefs As
sociation calls for stricter regulations
on the containment and monitoring of
hazardous chemical storage. The or
dinance was formulated primarily in re
sponse to several leaks from under
ground storage tanks of Silicon Valley
firms last year. However, since the or
dinance applies to only large users it
does not directly applv to Stanford.
One of the formulators of the or
dinance, Dan Heiszer, said "on the in
ventory aspect Stanford is doing more
than the ordinance requires." Heiszer,
hazardous material inspector for the
Palo Alto Fire Department, said that at

Stanford "we are mostly concerned
with storage" of the toxic materials.
Decleve said that the ordinance does
not affect Stanford in terms of under
ground storage but might affect new fa
cilities that are still in the planning
stage. "It will affect us in more psy
chological ways. We will have to comp
ly with the intent. I don't expect it to
cause problems for Stanford but it will
give us the atmosphere for improve
ment," he said.
Burnes said that "we have begun to
look at Stanford as a possible area to
control," but added that "in my
monitoring and analysis of Stanford's
effluence (waste) from the campus I
have found no trace of the things we
usuallv look for — heavy metals and in
organic material."
Although the University is facing
some changes — and some not small ex
penses — partly as the result of regu
lations, these changes are few compared
to those that face this area's industries.

penses — partly as the result of regu
lations, these changes are few compared
to those that face this area's industries.
Editor's note: This is the first in a two
part series concerning the disposal of tox
ic wastes. Today's article reports the
University's efforts at revising toxic
waste disposal procedures and tomor
-ow's installment considers industry
problems in disposing of toxic waste.

It was 3:30 a.m. on Oct. 27 when the
Peninsula Sanitary Service driver no
ticed that his truck load of garbage was
on fire. He quickly deposited the load
on the street between the Stanford
Museum and the orthopedic research
laboratory.
Fire-fighters soon arrived on the
scene to combat the blaze. One was in-

jured in the process.
After the fire was extinguished. Uni
versity and Palo Alto health and safety
and fire officials sorted through the
more than one ton of garbage to find
the cause. They did. They discovered
many chemical solvents and flamable
materials as well as several small flasks
of other unidentifiable chemicals.
"It was determined that the fire was
started bv the presence of chemicals,"
said Dr. Alain Decleve, director of

health and safety here. "Obviously the
disposal of chemicals in trash cans is
against Stanford policy," he added.
Toxic waste disposal is a widespread
issue for the University because large
amounts of toxic chemicals are used in
iabs and research. "Th?S little incident
points to deficiency in all levels,"
Decleve said. He has recently instituted
a disposal service that is provided
without charge to the individual depar
ments to encourage them to dispose
properly of hazardous waste materials.
Funds were appropriated by the Uni
versity general fund for the project.
"The issue of budgets and finance is a
major concern," he said.
In the new service the wastes will be
transported to an interim disposal site
on campus near the Medical Center.
According to Decleve, this site is tem
porary. The University has a three-year
permit for the interim site after which it

will be required bv the state to build a
permanent facility for "storage, treat
ment and radioactive half-life decay,"
Decleve said.
In addition, he said new incineration
facilities are needed to dispose of the
chemicals property. Ucclevc said new
facilities are needed to replace the aging
facilities at the Med Center.
The location of the permanent site
has not yet been determined. "The sit
ing is going to be a sensitive issue be
cause of the 'not in my backyard' syn
drome," Decleve said. The University
has already had objections from neigh
boring residents to proposed locations
for the site.
Decleve said he thinks the best site
for the disposal facilities would be as
near to the generators of the waste
products as possible.
The issue of toxic waste disposal, ac-


George Fujii/Daily
cording to Decleve is a "very emo
tional" one. He stressed the importance
of the "involvement of the press and the
students to educate the public."
One of Decleve's goals is to educate
individuals within the University on
proper disposal methods. His program
involves detailed inventory and storage
procedures as well as safety committees
in each department to help implement
the program.
Peter Burnes, an industrial waste in
spector for the city of Palo Alto, shares
Decleve's view that the issue has to be
brought to the personal level. "The
weakest link is not corporate
philosophies but the individuals them
selves who are handling the material,"
he said. "It comes down to basic educa
tion," he added.
Burnes explained thatalthough Stan
ford or an industry mav have a com
prehensive program for waste disposal,

"it comes down to the personal decision
of the person who uses the material
where it goes," and that this "creates a
' huge gap in the system."
One cause of the problem, Decleve
said, was the rapid growth of industry
and research without sufficient con
siderations to proper waste disposal.
"Now we have regulations that tell us to
do something but they don't tell us
how," he said.
Burnes said of Stanford's situation,
"they don't have any specificiations or
people to guide them in the man
agement of their wastes.
This is a problem that they have to
deal with and I have a great deal of con
fidence in Alain,"he added.
The University has worked closely
with city and state officials in attempts
to improve its disposal procedures. The
Hnvironmental Protection Agency
(KPA) regulations have a provision
which does not demand such strict pro
cedure for users of small amounts of

toxic materials. Stanford would nor
mally fall into the small user category,
as opposed to industries which are clas
sified as large users, but California does
not have the small user provision.
Decleve called this a "blessing in dis
guise because if we don't have to follow
regulations the people who transport it
won't deal with it."
A model ordinance written by a task
force of the Santa Clara Fire Chiefs As
sociation calls for stricter regulations
on the containment and monitoring of
hazardous chemical storage. The or
dinance was formulated primarily in re
sponse to several leaks from under
ground storage tanks of Silicon Valley
firms last year. However, since the or
dinance applies to only large users it
does not directly applv to Stanford.
One of the formulators of the or
dinance, Dan Heiszer, said "on the in
ventory aspect Stanford is doing more
than the ordinance requires." Heiszer,
hazardous material inspector for the
Palo Alto Fire Department, said that at

Stanford "we are mostly concerned
with storage" of the toxic materials.
Decleve said that the ordinance does
not affect Stanford in terms of under
ground storage but might affect new fa
cilities that are still in the planning
stage. "It will affect us in more psy
chological ways. We will have to comp
ly with the intent. I don't expect it to
cause problems for Stanford but it will
give us the atmosphere for improve
ment," he said.
Burnes said that "we have begun to
look at Stanford as a possible area to
control," but added that "in my
monitoring and analysis of Stanford's
effluence (waste) from the campus I
have found no trace of the things we
usuallv look for — heavy metals and in
organic material."
Although the University is facing
some changes — and some not small ex
penses — partly as the result of regu
lations, these changes are few compared
