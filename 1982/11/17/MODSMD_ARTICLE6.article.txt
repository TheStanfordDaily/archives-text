# A 						brief history...
## 
### 
• On Oct. 27 improper disposal of chemicals caused a garbage fire that injured
one fire fighter.
• On Aug. 13 sparks from the detonation of old ether cans caused a fire which
burned 30 to 35 acres of brush. The detonation, in accordance with Stanford dis
posal procedures, was carried out by the Santa Clara County Sheriffs Department
bomb squad and an employee of the Stanford Public Safety Department.
• In 1979 the Stanford University Hospital was cited for a violation of state
health and safety standards involving the use and storage of a chemical carcinogen.
In the last three years there have been no other incidents of chemical spills or
fires, according to Dr. Alain Decleve, health and safety director here.
No records exist of toxic chemical incidents before 1980 when EPA regulations
requiring records of such incidents went into effect, according to Decleve. "Before
that time they were very casual about the disposal of chemical wastes. Some of
them would just go in the sewer or garbage because there were no regulations."
Decleve said that when he became director in July 1980 "we tried to locate the
quarry where they had buried chemicals from the Old Chemistry Building so we
could tell EPA and dig up the wastes and ship them off. There were no records of its
location."
"It's not that there were no accidents but that they were not reported. People are
defensive about the issue. If they don't have to, they don't report it," Decleve
added.
