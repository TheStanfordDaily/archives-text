# ASSU committee meets, recommends $5750 cut
## 
### 
The ASSU finance committee last
night passed and sent to the senate a bill
detailing 55750 in cuts for the 1982-83
budget.
The organization that stands to lose
the largest amount is the Office of Pub
lic Affair 1 ' b >se budget was cut
by $2300 from an original proposal of
$3500. However, the Safety Com
mission received the biggest percentage
cut, losing 78 percent, or $525, of its ori
ginal budget request of $675.
This cut was justified, according to
Mark Epstein, council of presidents
(COP) member, because the com
mission had not done any work this
quarter and in fact had spent no money
so far.
However, Senate Chair Raga Elim
remarked that "I don't want to send out
the message that we don't care about
safety." But in his memo to committee

members detailing these cuts, Elim
wrote that "Our budget problems com
bined with this group's lack of activity
warrant this cut."
The bill also suggests cuts of $900 out
of a requested $2700 in the budget for
the ASSU aH agency. This cut comes
from dropping an off-campus mailer
that the ASSU had planned to send out.
The bill also recommends cutting a
special discretionary account of the
ASSU from $4275 to $3275 because in
dividual entities within the ASSU, such
as the student financial manager's of
fice, the COP and the senate, already
have such accounts of their own.
The balance of the reductions con
sisted of cuts in funding for various so
cial activities of the ASSU, such as hap
py hours, parties and meetings for stu
dent interns.
