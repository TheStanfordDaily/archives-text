# Peace movement in East says Mother Jones editor
## 
### ALLIE GILES 
A rising unofficial peace movement among
the citizens of Eastern Europe, supposedly par
alleling that in the West, was the subject of a talk
given last Wednesday by Adam Hochschild, a
contributing editor to Mother Jones magazine
and a commentator on National Public Radio.
Using his findings from a recent trip behind
the Berlin Wall, Hochschild compared the peace
movements in Western and Eastern Europe. "A
strong peace movement can be something con
tagious, can cross national borders."
Hochschild cited several examples of the
growing strength of the peace movement in the
West. He noted that in England, for example,
the membership in the campaign for Nuclear
Disarmament has increased tenfold in recent
years. And in Sicily, Italy, over half the entire
population of the island has signed a petition
against the United States placing its cruise mis
siles there.
"The really exciting thing is now," said
Hochschild, "for the first time, there is an echo
on the other side, in Eastern Europe, of these ac
tivities." He answered his own question of "Why
is this happening now?" with his belief that "the
bellicose rhetoric of (President) Reagan and
(former Secretary of State) Haig has frightened
many" and Europeans are coming to believe
that "a 'limited nuclear war' means limited to
Europe."
Hochschild feels the movement is especially
strong in East Germany because almost ev

eryone can receive West German TV and thus
view Western demonstrations; both Germanys,
Hochschild said, feel thev are "caught between
the two superpowers."
Hochschild mentioned one of the most dra
matic public expressions of this increasing con
cern. Each February, in Dresden, Germany,
there is a memorial march for the tens of
thousandsofcitizens killed in an Allied bombing
of that city during World War 11. This year,
anonymous leaflets were circulated saying
"Look to the future, not to the past" while many
people wore headbands which read "Make
peace without weapons."
The government, Hochschild theorized, is not
cracking down on such incidents because they
are afraid of creating martyrs or of creating an
other Polish situation. But they are worried
about it, he added, joking that "if you think Rea
gan and Weinberger are upset about the freeze,
you should see the East German Politburo."
In his speech, Hochschild quoted Gandhi's
four stages of reform: "First, they ignore you,
then they abuse and ridicule you, then they crack
down and then you win." Hochschild said the
peace movement is at the abuse and ridicule
stage, meaning it is getting closer to success,
which, in the short run, he sees as "bits and
pieces of Europe dropping out of the arms race."
Hochschild's talk was sponsored by the Mid-
Peninsula Conversion Project, a non-profit or
ganization which analyzes the impact of military
spending on the economy.
