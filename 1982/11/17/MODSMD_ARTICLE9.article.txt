## 
### ALLIE GILES 
While some students cele
brated the weekend at UCLA,
others spent their Saturday after
noon drinking 30 different kinds
of foreign beer at the 2nd Annual
AIESEC International Beerfest.
Everything from Guinness
Stout to Molson Golden was
served free of charge to about 400
students during the course of the
afternoon on the back patio of
the Bechtel International Center.
The goal of the beerfest was to
make students aware of
AIESEC, a student-run, non
profit organization whose name
is a French acronym for the In
ternational Association of Stu
dents in Economics and Business
Management.
AIESEC operates in colleges
all world. Its primary
purpose is to, provide students
with business experience through

an international exchange.
AIESEC chapters in the U.S.
set up internships in companies
here for foreign students so
American students can go work
in traineeships in other countries.
AIESEC-Stanford currently
has a trainee from Germany
working for Price Waterhouse in
San Francisco, and more interns
from other countries will be ar
riving during the year; this
enables AIESEC-Stanford to
send some of their members over
seas.
While Saturday's beerfest did a
lot to promote AIESEC and
make students more familiar
with it, Russ Ferrill, president of
the Stanford chapterof AIESEC,
said that "the main idea was for
everyone to have a good time."
Besides 93 cases of beer, the after
noon's festivities included a raffle
of more than 100 prizes.
