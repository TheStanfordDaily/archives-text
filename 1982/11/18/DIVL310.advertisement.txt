My doctor
pronounced
me cured
of cancer.
My boss
didn't.
My boss didn't under
stand that I was healthy
again.
So I was let go.
A lot of people are like
ray boss. They think that
everyone dies of cancer. I
thought so. too. Until the
American Cancer Society,
through one of its service
and rehabilitation programs,
helped me return to a
normal life.
The ACS also has local
Units that help Americans
who've never had cancer
understand it better.
Today, more and more,
cancer is a curable disease.
Ignorance about cancer is
curable, too.
