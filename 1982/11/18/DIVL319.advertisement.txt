PLANNING TO MOVE OUT OF
YOUR RESIDENCE NEXT QUARTER?
Single students who are currently living in a University residence
and who plan not to return for winter quarter should notify their local
residence office of their plans. A "termination of occupancy" form
must be filed by every resident who plans to (a) graduate, (b) go to
an overseas studies center, (c) stop out, or (d) get married.
Students who fail to notify residence offices by November 19 by
filing a termination of occupancy card will lose their $5O housing
deposits.
Residents of Escondido Village who have monthly rental
agreements should plan to give thirty days notice to the Escondido
Village Office before moving out of residence.
