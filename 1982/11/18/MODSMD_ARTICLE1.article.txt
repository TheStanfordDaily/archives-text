# Shuttle pilot predicts program expansion
## 
### KAREN SPRINGEN 
Future NASA plans may include
exploration of Venus, Mars and an
asteroid, a permanent manned space
station, a return to the moon and a
manned trip to Mars within 100
years, according to the director of
the agency.
NASA Administrator James
Beggs and space shuttle pilot Dick
Truly optimistically and humor
ously presented the future of the
space program in Kresge
Auditorium last night to more than
500 people.
Citing a 13 percent increase in re
search and development funds,
Beggs said, "this administration fa
vors the sphce program."
Beggs, the sixth head of the space
agency since its founding 24 years
ago, said NASA receives a 20-30
percent return on its space invest

ment. "All of those commercial ac
tivities . . . add up to a large return,"
he said.
Later, in response to an audience
question, "How likely is the shuttle
to be used for military purposes?"
Beggs said the military provides 25
percent of the space budget. "It (the
shuttle) will enable us to monitor the
Soviet Union in compliance with the
arms control agreement we have . . .
1 view the military as sort of a valued
customer... I need their business."
In addition to commercial gains,
Beggs cited the international bene
fits of cooperation and collabora
tion. "About $lO million has been
spent from abroad on our pro
gram," he said.
"It's one of the few programs that
we have that is truly beneficial to
all," he added.
"We've gotten a lot of heroes out

of the program," Beggs said. "We've
landed 12 men on the moon."
In response to an audience query
about why NASA uses manned
rather than less-expensive un
manned programs, Beggs said, "The
plain facts are . . . the existence of a
manned program is what makes this
program go."
Truly narrated films featuring
rare footage of the takeoff and land
ing of the Columbia shuttle last year
as well as illustrations of how
astronauts function aboard the
spacecraft. His slide show "world
tour" included photos of the Straits
of Gibraltar, Naples, the Sahara
Desert and the Himalayas.
"Looking back at the earth was
really one of the biggest thrills of
all," Truly said, though "large cities
really turn out looking like big gray
splotches on the face of the earth."

Truly described the sensation of
flying: "You see fire and smoke
coming right across the windows
and you really hope that's the way
it's supposed to work . . . everything
floats your buddy, your pencil."

"I launched on my 44th birthday
about a year ago and I tell you, I felt like
a kid again," he said, showing slides
astronauts performing one-handed
push-ups.
"One good thing about eating in
space, you dop't need a table, you just
put it in the air," he said.
NASA has slated five flights for next
year, 10 for the following year and 15|
for the year after. "Believe me, we are
back in space to stay," Truly said.
Plans for the immediate future in
clude a planetary probe in 1986 and the
Large Space Telescope in 1985, which
may enable scientists to comprehend
the universe's origin 14 billion light
years ago. "We may even see the echoes
of that big bang out there," Beggs said.
