## Japanese-American group leaders persevere in struggle for redress 
### SUZANNE SMITH 
Speakers at a campus forum Sunday on re
dress for Japanese-Americans for internment
during World War II were generally
pessimistic about their chances of attaining
this redress in the near future.
But they urged a near-capacity audience at
Annenberg Auditorium to support their ef
forts, stressing the educational and psy
chological value of the effort itself.
More than 120,000 Japanese-Americans
were interned for almost four years by the
U.S. government after the Pearl Harbor at
tack stirred a wave of national paranoia, ac
cording to James Shizuru, former chairman
of the Peninsula Redress Committee (PRC),
which sponsored the forum. Victims were
forced to abandon their homes, businesses
and schools. Property loss alone has been es
timated at $4OO million in 1942, Shizuru said,
a figure that "translates into the billions to
day."
A presidential commission was established
in 1980 to address this issue. Its recommenda
tions, based on hearings and more than 300
written testimonies, are scheduled for publi
cation after December 31.
Since 1980, numerous grass roots
Japanese-American organizations have
worked to encourage and assist public partic
ipation in the commission hearings, or in
some cases, have worked independently for
redress. At Sunday's forum, representatives
from three such organizations discussed vari
ous approaches to their common objective.
The National Coalition for Re
dress/Reparations (NCRR) has drafted a bill
calling for payment of $25,000 per individual
victim and $3 billion to the Japanese com
munity at large.
"We are convinced this bill will die in this
96th Congress," said Bert Nakano, spokes
man for the NCRR. Nevertheless, he said,
NCRR is proceeding with two objectives: to
promote congressional awareness and to stir
up grass roots support.
"We must proceed on a positive note," said
Nakano. "To do otherwise would be to
wallow in defeatism and accept second-class
status."
The Japanese-American Citizens League
(JACL) is also calling for reparations of
$25,000 per individual, a figure calculated
with reference to physical losses, average
1942 wages, inflationary factors and prece
dent cases.
Accompanied by community funds, this
amount of redress would total about $lO
billion, according to Ron Wakabayashi,
JACL spokesman.
"It is unrealistic to expect this to be paid all
at once," he said. So the JACL's "pragmatic,
though not ideal," approach is to call for
phase appropriations whereby reparations
would be paid in installments for example,
$lOO million in the first five years.
JACL has also encouraged victims who
were on the 1942 federal payroll to fill out a
claim form, Wakabayashi said. And employ
ees from the Los Angeles County payroll
eligible for $5OOO in redress, he added.

Wakabayashi stressed that the principles
behind JACL's requests were as important as
the requests themselves. "Money without a
formal apology would be insufficient," he
said.
The National Council for Japanese-Ameri
can Redress (NCJAR) was formed in 1980
"with the conviction that another route must
be taken," said spokesman Rev. Lloyd Wake.
"Do we really expect the national com
mission to call for a substantial amount of re
dress? Can we realistically expect Congress to
act? Can we expect anything more than a vo
luminous report? We in NCJAR are
pessimistic," Wake said.
So NCJAR will file suit against the U.S.

government in a Superior Court in Washing
ton, D.C.
"We recognize the barriers," said Wake.
Among the largest is the doctrine of sovereign
immunity, which prohibits citizens from
suing the government. Wake said there were
ways to waive sovereign immunity, but he
would not reveal NCJAR's strategies.
The 40-year time lapse since the intern
ments poses another legal barrier. After a cer
tain time period usually from one to six
years citizens lose their right to sue.
But, according to Wake, only in 1981 did
crucial research in Washington archives pro
vide sufficient evidence to rebutt the govern
ment's reasons for internment. "Because of
this research, we can proceed from the pres
ent date," he said.
The suit will contain 20 causes of action, in
cluding violation of due process, equal pro
tection, fair trial, privacy and free speech.
Victims can receive up to $lO,OOO per cause.
Except for native American suits filed sev
eral decades ago, this case is unprecedented,
Wake stressed. "We feel we owe it to
ourselves to test the courts, to see if they really
are expressions of freedom and justice," he
said.
Unlike NCRR or JACL, NCJAR does not
support the commission process. "But
neither did we boycott it," Wake said. "Some
of us participated in the hearings. The hear
ings stirred us to action."
All three spokesmen, along with featured
speaker Ron Ikejiri, a Washington lobbyist,
agreed that despite the organizations' diver
gent approaches, they were part of a "single
movement."
They also appeared to agree on the abun
dance of problems confronting the move
ment.
Racism was one such problem. "If we were

a Caucasian group, there would be no prob
lem," said Shizuru. He cited a 1981 case
where the government paid Vietnam pro
testers $lO,OOO each for two days of intern
ment.
Japanese-Americans are still suspected of a
lingering loyalty to Japan, Ikejiri said.
"We are even blamed for the state of the.
economy," said Shizuru.
Another of the movement's problems is,
ironically, the financial success of its consti
tuency. Japanese-Americans have higher
education and income levels than white
males, according to Ikejiri. "That they could
acquire this so quickly is sometimes mis
perceived as an indication that the experience
wasn't so bad," he said.
Furthermore, Japanese-Americans are
sometimes accused of greed because other
citizens are needier, Wakabayashi pointed
out.
And their own financial success reduces
Japanese-Americans' incentive to endorse ef
forts for redress. "We're not hungry
enough," said Ikejiri. "We forget what the
Isei (first generation) went through. We're liv
ing the American Dream."
Yet another problem facing the movement
is Japanese-Americans' "tremendous
aversion to politics," Ikejiri said. "They think
it's immoral. So they lacked, and still lack,
political infrastructures to help them fight
this issue."
Ikejiri urged the predominantly Japanese-
American audience to overcome this aversion
and to write letters and offer general public
support. "Politics put Japanese-Americans in
camps; politics can get them redress," he said.
Other miscellaneous problems mentioned
by one or more of the speakers:
•Scale: "If only one person had been in
terned, he'd have had no trouble getting re
dress," said Wakabayashi
•Measuring the degree of damage done.
•Visibility: about 80 percent of Japanese-
Americans are concentrated in California
and' Hawaii, according to Wakabayashi. Said
Ikejiri: "How do we get an unemployed De
troit auto worker to support Japanese-Amer
ican redress?"
Ikejiri pointed out that Japanese-Ameri
cans have too often been paralyzed by in
decision. "Our greatest difficulty is that we do
not know what we want," he said. "How do
we define success? Does success mean receiv
ing a certain amount of money? What about
money in trust? Or is simply educating the
American public sufficient for success?"
Though the speakers generally seemed de
termined to achieve tangible results, all
agreed on the value of the redress-seeking
process itself.
"The hearings have made us realize things
about Isei and Nisei (second generation) rela
tives that we didn't know before," said
Wakabayashi. "A lot of learning and healing
resulted from the testimonies."
Said Ikejiri: "If this redress process means
that eventually we get more Japanese-Ameri
can leaders in government and other pro
fessional careers, then the process itself will
have been a success."

'Do we really expect the
national commission to call
for a substantial amount of
redress? Can we realistically
expect Congress to act? Can
we expect anything more than
a voluminous report? We in
NCJAR are pessimistic.'

terned, he'd have had no trouble getting re
dress," said Wakabayashi
•Measuring the degree of damage done.
•Visibility: about 80 percent of Japanese-
Americans are concentrated in California
and' Hawaii, according to Wakabayashi. Said
Ikejiri: "How do we get an unemployed De
troit auto worker to support Japanese-Amer
ican redress?"
Ikejiri pointed out that Japanese-Ameri
cans have too often been paralyzed by in
decision. "Our greatest difficulty is that we do
not know what we want," he said. "How do
we define success? Does success mean receiv
ing a certain amount of money? What about
money in trust? Or is simply educating the
American public sufficient for success?"
Though the speakers generally seemed de
termined to achieve tangible results, all
agreed on the value of the redress-seeking
process itself.
"The hearings have made us realize things
about Isei and Nisei (second generation) rela
tives that we didn't know before," said
Wakabayashi. "A lot of learning and healing
resulted from the testimonies."
Said Ikejiri: "If this redress process means
that eventually we get more Japanese-Ameri
can leaders in government and other pro
fessional careers, then the process itself will
have been a success."

'Do we really expect the
national commission to call
for a substantial amount of
redress? Can we realistically
expect Congress to act? Can
we expect anything more than
a voluminous report? We in
NCJAR are pessimistic.'
Speakers at a campus forum Sunday on re
dress for Japanese-Americans for internment
during World War II were generally
pessimistic about their chances of attaining
this redress in the near future.
But they urged a near-capacity audience at
Annenberg Auditorium to support their ef
forts, stressing the educational and psy
chological value of the effort itself.
More than 120,000 Japanese-Americans
were interned for almost four years by the
U.S. government after the Pearl Harbor at
tack stirred a wave of national paranoia, ac
cording to James Shizuru, former chairman
of the Peninsula Redress Committee (PRC),
which sponsored the forum. Victims were
forced to abandon their homes, businesses
and schools. Property loss alone has been es
timated at $4OO million in 1942, Shizuru said,
a figure that "translates into the billions to
day."
A presidential commission was established
in 1980 to address this issue. Its recommenda
tions, based on hearings and more than 300
written testimonies, are scheduled for publi
cation after December 31.
Since 1980, numerous grass roots
Japanese-American organizations have
worked to encourage and assist public partic
ipation in the commission hearings, or in
some cases, have worked independently for
redress. At Sunday's forum, representatives
from three such organizations discussed vari
ous approaches to their common objective.
The National Coalition for Re
dress/Reparations (NCRR) has drafted a bill
calling for payment of $25,000 per individual
victim and $3 billion to the Japanese com
munity at large.
"We are convinced this bill will die in this
96th Congress," said Bert Nakano, spokes
man for the NCRR. Nevertheless, he said,
NCRR is proceeding with two objectives: to
promote congressional awareness and to stir
up grass roots support.
"We must proceed on a positive note," said
Nakano. "To do otherwise would be to
wallow in defeatism and accept second-class
status."
The Japanese-American Citizens League
(JACL) is also calling for reparations of
$25,000 per individual, a figure calculated
with reference to physical losses, average
1942 wages, inflationary factors and prece
dent cases.
Accompanied by community funds, this
amount of redress would total about $lO
billion, according to Ron Wakabayashi,
JACL spokesman.
"It is unrealistic to expect this to be paid all
at once," he said. So the JACL's "pragmatic,
though not ideal," approach is to call for
phase appropriations whereby reparations
would be paid in installments for example,
$lOO million in the first five years.
JACL has also encouraged victims who
were on the 1942 federal payroll to fill out a
claim form, Wakabayashi said. And employ
ees from the Los Angeles County payroll
eligible for $5OOO in redress, he added.

Wakabayashi stressed that the principles
behind JACL's requests were as important as
the requests themselves. "Money without a
formal apology would be insufficient," he
said.
The National Council for Japanese-Ameri
can Redress (NCJAR) was formed in 1980
"with the conviction that another route must
be taken," said spokesman Rev. Lloyd Wake.
"Do we really expect the national com
mission to call for a substantial amount of re
dress? Can we realistically expect Congress to
act? Can we expect anything more than a vo
luminous report? We in NCJAR are
pessimistic," Wake said.
So NCJAR will file suit against the U.S.

government in a Superior Court in Washing
ton, D.C.
"We recognize the barriers," said Wake.
Among the largest is the doctrine of sovereign
immunity, which prohibits citizens from
suing the government. Wake said there were
ways to waive sovereign immunity, but he
would not reveal NCJAR's strategies.
The 40-year time lapse since the intern
ments poses another legal barrier. After a cer
tain time period usually from one to six
years citizens lose their right to sue.
But, according to Wake, only in 1981 did
crucial research in Washington archives pro
vide sufficient evidence to rebutt the govern
ment's reasons for internment. "Because of
this research, we can proceed from the pres
ent date," he said.
The suit will contain 20 causes of action, in
cluding violation of due process, equal pro
tection, fair trial, privacy and free speech.
Victims can receive up to $lO,OOO per cause.
Except for native American suits filed sev
eral decades ago, this case is unprecedented,
Wake stressed. "We feel we owe it to
ourselves to test the courts, to see if they really
are expressions of freedom and justice," he
said.
Unlike NCRR or JACL, NCJAR does not
support the commission process. "But
neither did we boycott it," Wake said. "Some
of us participated in the hearings. The hear
ings stirred us to action."
All three spokesmen, along with featured
speaker Ron Ikejiri, a Washington lobbyist,
agreed that despite the organizations' diver
gent approaches, they were part of a "single
movement."
They also appeared to agree on the abun
dance of problems confronting the move
ment.
Racism was one such problem. "If we were

a Caucasian group, there would be no prob
lem," said Shizuru. He cited a 1981 case
where the government paid Vietnam pro
testers $lO,OOO each for two days of intern
ment.
Japanese-Americans are still suspected of a
lingering loyalty to Japan, Ikejiri said.
"We are even blamed for the state of the.
economy," said Shizuru.
Another of the movement's problems is,
ironically, the financial success of its consti
tuency. Japanese-Americans have higher
education and income levels than white
males, according to Ikejiri. "That they could
acquire this so quickly is sometimes mis
perceived as an indication that the experience
wasn't so bad," he said.
Furthermore, Japanese-Americans are
sometimes accused of greed because other
citizens are needier, Wakabayashi pointed
out.
And their own financial success reduces
Japanese-Americans' incentive to endorse ef
forts for redress. "We're not hungry
enough," said Ikejiri. "We forget what the
Isei (first generation) went through. We're liv
ing the American Dream."
Yet another problem facing the movement
is Japanese-Americans' "tremendous
aversion to politics," Ikejiri said. "They think
it's immoral. So they lacked, and still lack,
political infrastructures to help them fight
this issue."
Ikejiri urged the predominantly Japanese-
American audience to overcome this aversion
and to write letters and offer general public
support. "Politics put Japanese-Americans in
camps; politics can get them redress," he said.
Other miscellaneous problems mentioned
by one or more of the speakers:
•Scale: "If only one person had been in
terned, he'd have had no trouble getting re
dress," said Wakabayashi
•Measuring the degree of damage done.
•Visibility: about 80 percent of Japanese-
Americans are concentrated in California

testers $lO,OOO each for two days of intern
ment.
Japanese-Americans are still suspected of a
lingering loyalty to Japan, Ikejiri said.
"We are even blamed for the state of the.
economy," said Shizuru.
Another of the movement's problems is,
ironically, the financial success of its consti
tuency. Japanese-Americans have higher
education and income levels than white
males, according to Ikejiri. "That they could
acquire this so quickly is sometimes mis
perceived as an indication that the experience
wasn't so bad," he said.
Furthermore, Japanese-Americans are
sometimes accused of greed because other
citizens are needier, Wakabayashi pointed
out.
And their own financial success reduces
Japanese-Americans' incentive to endorse ef
forts for redress. "We're not hungry
enough," said Ikejiri. "We forget what the
Isei (first generation) went through. We're liv
ing the American Dream."
Yet another problem facing the movement
is Japanese-Americans' "tremendous
aversion to politics," Ikejiri said. "They think
it's immoral. So they lacked, and still lack,
political infrastructures to help them fight
this issue."
Ikejiri urged the predominantly Japanese-
American audience to overcome this aversion
and to write letters and offer general public
support. "Politics put Japanese-Americans in
camps; politics can get them redress," he said.
Other miscellaneous problems mentioned
by one or more of the speakers:
•Scale: "If only one person had been in
terned, he'd have had no trouble getting re
dress," said Wakabayashi
•Measuring the degree of damage done.
•Visibility: about 80 percent of Japanese-
Americans are concentrated in California
and' Hawaii, according to Wakabayashi. Said
Ikejiri: "How do we get an unemployed De
troit auto worker to support Japanese-Amer
ican redress?"
Ikejiri pointed out that Japanese-Ameri
cans have too often been paralyzed by in
decision. "Our greatest difficulty is that we do
not know what we want," he said. "How do
we define success? Does success mean receiv
ing a certain amount of money? What about
money in trust? Or is simply educating the
American public sufficient for success?"
Though the speakers generally seemed de
termined to achieve tangible results, all
agreed on the value of the redress-seeking
process itself.
"The hearings have made us realize things
about Isei and Nisei (second generation) rela
tives that we didn't know before," said
Wakabayashi. "A lot of learning and healing
resulted from the testimonies."
Said Ikejiri: "If this redress process means
that eventually we get more Japanese-Ameri
can leaders in government and other pro
fessional careers, then the process itself will
have been a success."

'Do we really expect the
national commission to call
for a substantial amount of
redress? Can we realistically
expect Congress to act? Can
we expect anything more than
a voluminous report? We in
NCJAR are pessimistic.'
Speakers at a campus forum Sunday on re
dress for Japanese-Americans for internment
during World War II were generally
pessimistic about their chances of attaining
this redress in the near future.
But they urged a near-capacity audience at
Annenberg Auditorium to support their ef
forts, stressing the educational and psy
chological value of the effort itself.
More than 120,000 Japanese-Americans
were interned for almost four years by the
U.S. government after the Pearl Harbor at
tack stirred a wave of national paranoia, ac
cording to James Shizuru, former chairman
of the Peninsula Redress Committee (PRC),
which sponsored the forum. Victims were
forced to abandon their homes, businesses
and schools. Property loss alone has been es
timated at $4OO million in 1942, Shizuru said,
a figure that "translates into the billions to
day."
A presidential commission was established
in 1980 to address this issue. Its recommenda
tions, based on hearings and more than 300
written testimonies, are scheduled for publi
cation after December 31.
Since 1980, numerous grass roots
Japanese-American organizations have
worked to encourage and assist public partic
ipation in the commission hearings, or in
some cases, have worked independently for
redress. At Sunday's forum, representatives
from three such organizations discussed vari
ous approaches to their common objective.
The National Coalition for Re
dress/Reparations (NCRR) has drafted a bill
calling for payment of $25,000 per individual
victim and $3 billion to the Japanese com
munity at large.
"We are convinced this bill will die in this
96th Congress," said Bert Nakano, spokes
man for the NCRR. Nevertheless, he said,
NCRR is proceeding with two objectives: to
promote congressional awareness and to stir
up grass roots support.
"We must proceed on a positive note," said
Nakano. "To do otherwise would be to
wallow in defeatism and accept second-class
status."
The Japanese-American Citizens League
(JACL) is also calling for reparations of
$25,000 per individual, a figure calculated
with reference to physical losses, average
1942 wages, inflationary factors and prece
dent cases.
Accompanied by community funds, this
amount of redress would total about $lO
billion, according to Ron Wakabayashi,
JACL spokesman.
"It is unrealistic to expect this to be paid all
at once," he said. So the JACL's "pragmatic,
though not ideal," approach is to call for
phase appropriations whereby reparations
would be paid in installments for example,
$lOO million in the first five years.
JACL has also encouraged victims who
were on the 1942 federal payroll to fill out a
claim form, Wakabayashi said. And employ
ees from the Los Angeles County payroll
eligible for $5OOO in redress, he added.

Wakabayashi stressed that the principles
behind JACL's requests were as important as
the requests themselves. "Money without a
formal apology would be insufficient," he
said.
The National Council for Japanese-Ameri
can Redress (NCJAR) was formed in 1980
"with the conviction that another route must
be taken," said spokesman Rev. Lloyd Wake.
"Do we really expect the national com
mission to call for a substantial amount of re
dress? Can we realistically expect Congress to
act? Can we expect anything more than a vo
luminous report? We in NCJAR are
pessimistic," Wake said.
So NCJAR will file suit against the U.S.

government in a Superior Court in Washing
ton, D.C.
"We recognize the barriers," said Wake.
Among the largest is the doctrine of sovereign
immunity, which prohibits citizens from
suing the government. Wake said there were
ways to waive sovereign immunity, but he
would not reveal NCJAR's strategies.
The 40-year time lapse since the intern
ments poses another legal barrier. After a cer
tain time period usually from one to six
years citizens lose their right to sue.
But, according to Wake, only in 1981 did
crucial research in Washington archives pro
vide sufficient evidence to rebutt the govern
ment's reasons for internment. "Because of
this research, we can proceed from the pres
ent date," he said.
The suit will contain 20 causes of action, in
cluding violation of due process, equal pro
tection, fair trial, privacy and free speech.
Victims can receive up to $lO,OOO per cause.
Except for native American suits filed sev
eral decades ago, this case is unprecedented,
Wake stressed. "We feel we owe it to
ourselves to test the courts, to see if they really
are expressions of freedom and justice," he
said.
Unlike NCRR or JACL, NCJAR does not
support the commission process. "But
neither did we boycott it," Wake said. "Some
of us participated in the hearings. The hear
ings stirred us to action."
All three spokesmen, along with featured
speaker Ron Ikejiri, a Washington lobbyist,
agreed that despite the organizations' diver
gent approaches, they were part of a "single
movement."
They also appeared to agree on the abun
dance of problems confronting the move
ment.
Racism was one such problem. "If we were

a Caucasian group, there would be no prob
lem," said Shizuru. He cited a 1981 case
where the government paid Vietnam pro
testers $lO,OOO each for two days of intern
ment.
Japanese-Americans are still suspected of a
lingering loyalty to Japan, Ikejiri said.
"We are even blamed for the state of the.
economy," said Shizuru.
Another of the movement's problems is,
ironically, the financial success of its consti
tuency. Japanese-Americans have higher
education and income levels than white
males, according to Ikejiri. "That they could
acquire this so quickly is sometimes mis
perceived as an indication that the experience
wasn't so bad," he said.
Furthermore, Japanese-Americans are
sometimes accused of greed because other
citizens are needier, Wakabayashi pointed
out.
And their own financial success reduces
Japanese-Americans' incentive to endorse ef
forts for redress. "We're not hungry
enough," said Ikejiri. "We forget what the
Isei (first generation) went through. We're liv

is Japanese-Americans' "tremendous
aversion to politics," Ikejiri said. "They think
it's immoral. So they lacked, and still lack,
political infrastructures to help them fight
this issue."
