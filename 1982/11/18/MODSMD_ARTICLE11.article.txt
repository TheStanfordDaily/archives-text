### CAROLINE RHOADS 
Soon, a mentally ill patient
may benefit more by spending
15 minutes giving a blood
sample than by spending 15
years on a psychiatrist's
couch.
Although couches will still
be an integral part of the psy
chiatrist's office of the future,
it is likely that that same office
will hold a lot more medical
equipment than it does now.
Ideally, a patient with a se
vere mental illness will walk
into a clinic, have a blood or
spinal fluid sample taken and
then meet briefly with a doc
tor. While the doctor is in
terviewing the patient, the
blood sample will be put into
a mass spectrometer such as
the one in the new and unique
Pasarow Analytical Neu
rochemical Facility here.
From the results of the
blood test and the doctor's
analysis of the patient's men
tal state, the doctor will know
the exact type and sub-type of
the illness and will then be
able to prescribe the most ef
fective drug and psy
chotherapy for the patient.
Research designed to make
this rapid and effective treat
ment possible is now being
conducted at the Nancy
Pritzker Laboratory of Be
havioral Neurochemistry
here. In a recent talk entitled
"Psychobiology: New Ap
proaches to Mental Illness,"
Jack Barchas, professor of
psychiatry, described this re
search.
"We at the Nancy Pritzker
Lab are a group of in
vestigators studying neu
rotransmitters," Barchas
said. Neurotransmitters are
the chemicals which act as
messengers between the 100
billion nerve cells in the brain.
Evidence from their research
has shown that the levels of
certain neurotransmitters are
critical in determining a per
son's mental state.
As an example, Barchas
said that "a relative excess of
the neurotransmitter
dopamine, may be associated
with some forms of
schizophrenia." Researchers
in the Nancy Pritzker Lab
have found that under condi
tions of stress, the enzyme
which controls the formation

of dopamine is activated and
becomes six to 10 times more
productive than usual.
Barchas hypothesizes that
each different sort of depres
sion or schizophrenia will be
marked by unique variations
in the levels of certain neu
rotransmitters. By character
izing all these different vari
ations, and by correlating the
results of blood testing with
them, more accurate
diagnoses may be possible.
Though Barchas and his
colleagues do not develop
drugs to combat mental ill
ness, their research also bears
on that aspect of therapy. Psy
choactive drugs, which have
been in use for many* years,
are just now beginning to be
understood. It is thought that
one, which combats
schizophrenia, works by
blocking the enzyme which
controls the formation of
dopamine and thus by keep
ing the neurotransmitter at a
normal level.
Barchas and his colleagues
are also exploring the effects
of serotonin and nor
epinephrine two other neu
rotransmitters and the ef
fects of endorphine-like sub
stances found in the brain.
Because the effects of en
dorphines are similar to those
of opiates and morphine,
Barchas thinks they may play
a role in depression.

According to Barchas,
however, the psychiatry of the
future's greatest obstacle is
the psychiatry of today.
"Our society, in my
judgment," he said, "is doing
something very cruel in not
providing adequate care for
severaly mentally ill patients.
We owe it to these people, as
members of a humane society,
to take care of them."
Unfortunately, Barchas
said, the government is not
supporting psychiatric re
search in proportion to the
great advances being made in
the field now.
"Half of the medical beds in
our hospitals are taken up by
psychiatric patients, but only
4 percent of government
research grants are for psy
chiatric research," he said.
"Researchers in the field of
psychiatry have fewer funds
available in real money than
in 1969."
Lacking the lobbying
power of groups such as the
American Cancer Society, re
searchers in psychiatry are
looking ahead at hard times
unless the government begins
to put more money into their
field. Governmental con
tributions to psychiatric re
search would make great fi
nancial sense, Barchas said,
since the government spent
approximately $5l billion last
year in support and care of the
mentally ill.

members of a humane society,
to take care of them."
Unfortunately, Barchas
said, the government is not
supporting psychiatric re
search in proportion to the
great advances being made in
the field now.
"Half of the medical beds in
our hospitals are taken up by
psychiatric patients, but only
4 percent of government
research grants are for psy
chiatric research," he said.
"Researchers in the field of
psychiatry have fewer funds
available in real money than
in 1969."
Lacking the lobbying
power of groups such as the
American Cancer Society, re
searchers in psychiatry are
looking ahead at hard times
unless the government begins
to put more money into their
field. Governmental con
tributions to psychiatric re
search would make great fi
nancial sense, Barchas said,
since the government spent
approximately $5l billion last
year in support and care of the
mentally ill.

PSYCHIATRIC RESEARCH: Workers at the Nancy
Pritzker Laboratory of Behavioral Neurochemistry here investigate
the possible applications of neurotransmitters in
the field of chemical psychiatry.
Soon, a mentally ill patient
may benefit more by spending
15 minutes giving a blood
sample than by spending 15
years on a psychiatrist's
couch.
Although couches will still
be an integral part of the psy
chiatrist's office of the future,
it is likely that that same office
will hold a lot more medical
equipment than it does now.
Ideally, a patient with a se
vere mental illness will walk
into a clinic, have a blood or
spinal fluid sample taken and
then meet briefly with a doc
tor. While the doctor is in
terviewing the patient, the
blood sample will be put into
a mass spectrometer such as
the one in the new and unique
Pasarow Analytical Neu
rochemical Facility here.
From the results of the
blood test and the doctor's
analysis of the patient's men
tal state, the doctor will know
the exact type and sub-type of
the illness and will then be
able to prescribe the most ef
fective drug and psy
chotherapy for the patient.
Research designed to make
this rapid and effective treat
ment possible is now being
conducted at the Nancy
Pritzker Laboratory of Be
havioral Neurochemistry
here. In a recent talk entitled
"Psychobiology: New Ap
proaches to Mental Illness,"
Jack Barchas, professor of
psychiatry, described this re
search.
"We at the Nancy Pritzker
Lab are a group of in
vestigators studying neu
rotransmitters," Barchas
said. Neurotransmitters are
the chemicals which act as
messengers between the 100
billion nerve cells in the brain.
Evidence from their research
has shown that the levels of
certain neurotransmitters are
critical in determining a per
son's mental state.
As an example, Barchas
said that "a relative excess of
the neurotransmitter
dopamine, may be associated
with some forms of
schizophrenia." Researchers
in the Nancy Pritzker Lab
have found that under condi
tions of stress, the enzyme
which controls the formation

of dopamine is activated and
becomes six to 10 times more
productive than usual.
Barchas hypothesizes that
each different sort of depres
sion or schizophrenia will be
marked by unique variations
in the levels of certain neu
rotransmitters. By character
izing all these different vari
ations, and by correlating the
results of blood testing with
them, more accurate
diagnoses may be possible.
Though Barchas and his
colleagues do not develop
drugs to combat mental ill
ness, their research also bears
on that aspect of therapy. Psy
choactive drugs, which have
been in use for many* years,
are just now beginning to be
understood. It is thought that
one, which combats
schizophrenia, works by
blocking the enzyme which
controls the formation of
dopamine and thus by keep
ing the neurotransmitter at a
normal level.
Barchas and his colleagues
are also exploring the effects
of serotonin and nor
epinephrine two other neu
rotransmitters and the ef
fects of endorphine-like sub
stances found in the brain.
Because the effects of en
dorphines are similar to those
of opiates and morphine,
Barchas thinks they may play
a role in depression.

According to Barchas,
however, the psychiatry of the
future's greatest obstacle is
the psychiatry of today.
"Our society, in my
judgment," he said, "is doing
something very cruel in not
providing adequate care for
severaly mentally ill patients.
We owe it to these people, as
members of a humane society,
to take care of them."
