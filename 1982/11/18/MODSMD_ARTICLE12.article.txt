We get the movie rights

So Uncle Duke in Doonesbury thinks that John
DeLorean's life would make a good movie. Well,
we have one even better The Robert O'Connor
Story.
Picture an ordinary day in wealthy Northern Cal
ifornia neighborhoods full of BM Ws, exotic art col
lections and joggers. Yes, joggers. For lurking in
this paradise is one jogger with a fetish for those
treasured goods of his neighbors a $3 million
fetish.
Now this isn't your everyday thief. He is a teach
er, track coach, photographer and jeweler. He is
unbelievably fit and well-educated in art and even
wines. During his twilight jogs, he scouts out empty
homes into which he later enters to steal such cov
eted items as Asian and Indian sculptures, oriental
rugs and even sporting goods for his kids.
One time he even brings home a nice orange cat
named "Two."
Now while all this burglarizing goes on during a
two-year period, some local police become especial
ly irked. They want to see justice and safety return
to the palm and eucalyptus groves of their fair
cities.
In the midst of these burglaries, police almost
catch our fearless jogger, but fail. So in an act of
desperation police come up with the ultimate plan
a stakeout. But even the Keystone Kops would
probably do a better job. "He avoided us like the
plague, like he knew we were out there," said one.
"Maybe he had a scanner."
Then police get a lead from an art dealer in Wash
ington. Immediately they notify the FBI since the

goods have crossed state lines.
Now the FBI is a busy organization. They have
their own Japanese technology thieves to worry
about. So the exotic goods case is, in the words of
police, shuttled "back and forth" for another six
months.
' But on one fine day a police/FBI quartet set out
warrant-less to the jogger's La Honda home to talk
to his wife. When they knock on the front door, the
jogger escapes through the back as quickly as a
"gazelle."
But don't fret yet because our little story isn't
over. You see, one of those diligent police detec
tives is deeply devoted to finding our aforemen
tioned feline friend, "Two," which happened to be
an Abyssinian show cat worth lots of worth lots of
money. Back in La Honda, the detective asks the
jogger's own kids about the weird-colored cat.
Now daddy may have treated his children right
and brought them lots of goodies, but he certainly
never taught them when to keep their mouths shut.
The cat is at daddy's friend's house in Montara, the
children tell the detective.
Now police aren't going to let this story get a bit
boring, so they make three simultaneous pre-dawn
raids a few days later. What to their surprise! The
jogger is at the Montara home. However, this time
police have learned their lesson; a dozen of the Bay
Area's finest are ready for our speedy burglar as he
attempts to climb out a back window.
And there our story ends. Once again justice is
finally served a little over-cooked, maybe, but
certainly not well-done.

Halley's Comet: for us, once

The cold night air makes the sky seems a bit
darker now, and the stars glint sharply, alone, just
after the new moon. But not so long from now
merely in 1986 a peripatetic friend will bedazzle
and outshine the stars and even the full moon.
Astronomers have spotted Halley's Comet some
where in the reaches between Uranus and Saturn as
it rushes through the cold, sucked toward the sun
only to flare and, condensing, be whirled into the
cold again. The traveler that will light our nights is
smaller now: a bare impression on Mt. Palomar's
photographic plates from here or, more to the
point, a two-mile wide ball of ice and condensed
gases.
The comet, more than one billion miles from the
sun, will leave its mark on a generation as it trails
across the sky. Children will remember hushed ex
planations of why light across a fourth of the sky
streams so constantly showing motion without
seeming to move and you, perhaps, will share a
lover's touch as the comet's glow matches the sun
set's orange.
It is a timeless dance: the sun drifts slowly, but
swings the fast-moving comet around its multi
billion mile path. Locked together as the two bodies
are, they will never come together. The solar winds
blow the comet's tail forever away from the sun
the tail at first follows behind, but after the comet's
tight swing before heading beyond the solar system,
precedes the comet before being gathered into
harsh ice for the journey of cold miles.

It is just a small part of the comet's ellipse before
it lights our skies, but where will you be then? Of
students, only freshmen will be here, ready to grad
uate; the rest will trail across the country. The com
et has come full circle, but Stanford was a local,
struggling school when the comet last passed in
1910 and will no doubt change as much again
before anyone will spot Halley's anew.
In another cycle, Halley's Comet lit the skies
above the battle of Hastings and was feared as an
omen of change and enormous disruption. The
same sense of a world unhinged, of order betrayed,
is contained within Shakespeare's warning in
Julius Caesar : "When beggars die there are no
comets seen/ The heavens themselves blaze forth
the death of princes." There is more than a little
reason for this fear, even now: in Halley's Comet,
we see another scale of time, consistency and dis
tance that we cannot hope to grasp, except ab
stractly. We are dwarfed, so much that we can only
watch, record and wait only participate in the
meeting of Halley's Comet and the sun as spec
tators, waiting for princes and nations to rise and
fall.
It is futile to guess how Halley's Comet will be
tracked on its next visit or the range of
astronomers' tools then except to note that it will
be different, if the discovery occurs at all. For now,
we can only wonder and feel the tinge of fear in the
presence of something great and welcome
Halley's Comet.
