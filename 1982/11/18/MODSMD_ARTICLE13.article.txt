## The 						Right's Commie-baiting Soviet 'threat' 
### 
"Of the long train of 'menaces' that have ignited
discontents and anxieties in the past, none can
match the Communist Menace in its duration,
scope, impact on social and cultural values and on
voting behavior."
Frank Donner,

The New Right is on the offensive again. Its
target, the peace movement, may be a new choice,
but its weapons are old, rusty and full of holes. But
they've got a real pro on their side yup, you
guessed it the old scholar himself, Ronald Rea
gan.
In a speech before a veterans group Oct. 4 and
again during a press conference last week, Reagan
declared that the peace movement in America is
fueled and controlled by Soviet agents. Reagan in
voked as evidence none other than that journal of
incisive political analysis, The Readers Digest. Rea
gan claimed he had "documented proof' of Soviet
infiltration, based on two articles entitled "The Rus
sian Knife at America's Throat" and "The KGB's
Magical War for Peace."
Sound familiar? With this campaign to smear the
peace movement, Reagan and his New Right bud
dies join a notorius fraternity. From the union-bust
ing magnates of the Gilded Age through the Red
baiting of Gen. Palmer and Sen. Joseph McCarthy
to the Cold Warriors who brought us the domino
theory and the Vietnam War, the paranoid
pathology of anti-communism has long tainted
American politics. The ideology of fear has been an
efficient tool for desperate men and its practitioners
have been running this country for decades.
This time around, it's been tough going for those
trying to "defrost the freezeniks." A group calling
itself the Washington Legal Foundation has been
giving advice on just how to go about it; "Expose
them as a left group. What do you have to lose . . .
and state your case strongly as if you knew what you
were talking about" (The Nation, Nov. 6,1982). The
complete lack of damning evidence hasn't deterred
the true believers, however. For example, Alabama
Sen. Jeremiah Denton, chairman of the security and
terrorism subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary
Committee, has ferreted out the Communist in
fluence everywhere, even finding subversives in the
beds of his Senate colleagues. In response to Den
ton's slurs on their wives (members of Peace Links),
Senators Dale Bumpers and Paul Tsongas tartly
quipped that their wives were not KGB agents. Den

ton, however, has never been interested in reality.
Though the New Right would beg to differ, the
peace movement is certainly not the result of a few
well-placed Soviet agents. The largest protest in
American history took place on June 12 in New
York, on the eve of the United Nations' Special
Session on Disarmament. Those who didn't attend
the rallies in New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco
and elsewhere sent their support. The movement is
truly grass-roots; it consists of people as diverse and
as similar as radical feminists, Catholic priests,

housewives, unemployed auto workers, Third
World revolutionaries and middle- and upper-class
physicians. Even retired generals (ardent com
munists) and past architects of our domestic and
foreign policies have joined the effort. Yet, despite
this broad base of support and the impeccable
credentials of the prominent spokespeople or
more likely, because of these features the smear
campaign lurches forward.
As detailed in The Nation, the Red-baiters active
ly smearing the American peace movement span the
political spectrum from far right through "respect
able" conservatives and even include some major
American newspapers. For example, John Rees,
Washington correspondent for the John Birch Soci
ety's The Review of the News and a veteran in
filtrator of antiwar and anti-nuclear power groups,
has been disseminating his lurid smears to a wide au
dience. His boosters include William Buckley's Na
tional Review and the business journal Barron's.
Other mainstream periodicals active in the smear
campaign include The Wall Street Journal, which
has accomplished the remarkable feat of linking the
American Friends Service Committee to Soviet

agents. The Journal's smears were nicely timed to
coincide with the June 12 disarmament rally in New
York.
The upsurge in Red-baiting activity by the Right
is symptomatic of one phenomenon: fear. Not fear
of the "Soviet Menace," rather, fear of democracy
at home. In the recent national elections, 60 percent
of those with the opportunity to choose voted for a
freeze on building, deployment and testing of a nu
clear weapons. Many people have devoted long
hours to the peace movement's educatiohal and po
litical activities. The massive arms buildup sought
by the Reagan administration may be jeopardized
and its confrontational foreign policies rebuked.
This is the source of the Right's fear that everyday
citizens , rather than weapons designers, generals,
militarist politicians, intellectual elites and military
contractors should control governmental policies.
The campaign to smear the peace movement is the
Right's response to one of the most remarkable
manifestations of real American democracy in
years.
Since the birth of the New Cold War (to borrow
Noam Chomsky's phrase) during the Carter Admin
istration, there has been lots of effort at whipping up
hysteria about the "Soviet threat." We've now
moved into a new phase. With millions of Ameri
cans rejecting the current administration's military
spending plans and fearful for their very lives under
the shadow of atomic weapons the "Soviet threat"
no longer suffices for the Right's purposes. The
specter of domestic demons or at least "dupes"
is now required to convince people to waste hun
dreds of billion of dollars on "defense" to support
military intervention in the Third World and to ac
cede to economic deprivation. In this spirit of Sub
verting democracy, the true dupes Reagan, Den
ton and the rightist media sally forth with their
venomous accusations.
The challenge to those of us who work for peace is
not to wallow in the trench warfare of sloganeering
and wild accusations with the gendarmes of the re
gime. Instead, the struggle lies in developing a
credible alternative to this war machine we call an
economy; an alternative to the paranoia and fear
fostered by our "leaders." A truly survivable future
is what we want, and nuclear disarmament is a
modest but necessary step.
