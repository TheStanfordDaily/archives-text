## Lyrical power and Bruce's vision 
### 
"Me and her went for a ride sir, and 10
innocent people died." The music is a
very special and feeling friend.
"Everybody's got a hungry heart,"
Bruce Springsteen sings, and it is very
popular indeed. He leaps over an amp
in concert; he keeps the pace quick and
everyone is on his feet, ever so happy.
He plays "Rosalita" and no one can
complain.
But then he sits and somberly sings a
rendition of "This Land Is Your
Land," because he feels he must; many
of the faithful get very restless.
It is all music; it all entertains one
person or another. We should just leave
it at that.
But there is more; there must be more
whether we like it or not. Every song
has something to say, whether it be in
sightful or frivolous, whether it wants
to or not. Some music is blind and some
reveals a vision clear and true.
So Frank Sinatra sings "What is
America to Me." He sings of dreams
and democracy, of the beautiful and the
free, of the brave and the hopeful. He
sings and listening makes so many feel
so good. He prefaces the song by saying
how patriotic he feels, how good he
feels about our fair land. Some see irony
in the moment; some feel angry. Some
see the truth.
"Once I was a rich man, now I am so
poor."
Mick Jagger felt angry in 1965 when
the Rolling Stones released Beggar's
Banquet. His anger, his thought,
doesn't get much air play. Many Stones
fans probably would not recognize
most of the songs on the album. You
won't hear "Jigsaw Puzzle" or "Salt of
the Earth" on the radio; once in a great
while "Sympathy for the Devil" or
"Street Fighting Man" may surface.
People can't dance to these songs;
they're not conducive to jumping up
and down. But, the songs tried to tell
the truth; they tried to dig deeper; they
tried to show people the unpleasant, but
all too real, state of their lives and socie
ty. This was in the early days of a trou
bled time, when for a while no one
could be blind to the pain and injustices

his society had created, or at least to
the consequences of these creations.
"Mister the day my number comes in,
I ain't never gonna ride in no used car
again."
So now, in the fall of 1982, we have
the Frank Sinatra, in his tux
edo, smiling and singing blindly at the
Concert for the Americas. It is a simple,
unimportant scene, most will say, but in
that face one can see the ignorance of
millions. Once can see President Rea
gan proclaiming that 90 percent of all
Americans are getting along so very
nicely. One can see the upper-class pro
fessionals from their homes in the sub
urbs decrying their desperate predica
ment as overburdened taxpayers. One
can simply see a blindness to and com
plete misapprehension of the desper
ation and poverty in our midst.
In the music, we can see the blindness
or escapism, whichever you prefer, of
popular music throughout the '3os, '4os
arid 'sos. In away, the songs all did
mean something and are still very
portant. For those who wish to convey
truths of the time, the songs can be used
perfectly in movies for the purpose of
ironic commentary.

The fluffy songs of the '3os provided
devastating irony in the movie, Pennies
from Heaven , making the human misery
even more horrifying. Listening to
Sinatra sing "What is America to Me"
is no less devastating.
"Still at the end of every hard earned
day, people find some reason to believe."
Still, a few search for truth; a few re
fuse to blind themselves; a few face it.
"My dad sweats the same job, from
mornin's to morn/ Me, I walk home on
the same dirty streets where I was
born." This is America for a large per
centage of its citizens. For a significant
and rising number, the reality is even
more desperate. "If you can take a
man's life for the thoughts that's in his
head/ Then won't you sit back in that
chair and think it over judge one more
time/ And let 'em shave off my hair and
put me on/ that execution line."
After a long drought, and of course
only in isolated instances, music is once
again showing us the type of society we
have created at what may well be the be
ginning of a troubled time. Nowhere is
this done more effectively than in Bruce
Springsteen's Nebraska, quoted
throughout this column.

It is music to which every person
should listen. It is about an America
which we are fostering, an America
where some are driven to passive sub
mission, others to sudden violence. No
more hope. No more dreams.
"I can't say that I am sorry for the
things that we have done I At least for a
little while sir, me and her we had us some
fun."
It is an America that few see and
fewer wish to understand.
Similarly, Nebraska, when
was an album to which few wished
listen. Many groaned when they per
ceived the sudden shift in Springsteen's
music and concerns. It was just too
dark. They wanted Bruce to rock out, to
entertain them at parties.
Most likely, Nebraska will face the
same fate as Beggar's Banquet. People
will show a curious interest in it for a
while; the critical acclaim will be never
ending, for a few months. Then it will
fade from the mind. The radio stations
will carry on with "Bom to Run,"
"Badlands," and "Hungry Heart"
while the images of "Mansion on the

Hill," "Johnny 99," and "Nebraska"
will soon reach no one.
"Steel gates that completely surround,
sir, the mansion on the hill."
So how much better are we than
those who see nothing wrong in simply
enjoying some catchy tunes and
getting, those who see nothing wrong
the picture of Frank Sinatra singing "A
land proud and free, that's what Ameri
ca is to me."
How can we criticize unless we recog
nize the importance of Springsteen's vi
sion, a vision that drove him to take the
risk of Nebraska? It will mean the rejec
tion, at least for a time of the energy and
exuberance we demand from our mu
sic. It will mean sitting and listening to
every word of an artist who perceives
the true state of our union.
"You want to know why I did what I
done. I guess there's just a meanness in
this world."
For those who have been with us
from the beginning, that's the last
until number one makes a comebacÂ®
next time.

"My dad sweats the same job, from
mornin's to morn/ Me, I walk home on
the same dirty streets where I was
born." This is America for a large per
centage of its citizens. For a significant
and rising number, the reality is even
more desperate. "If you can take a
man's life for the thoughts that's in his
head/ Then won't you sit back in that
chair and think it over judge one more
time/ And let 'em shave off my hair and
put me on/ that execution line."
After a long drought, and of course
only in isolated instances, music is once
again showing us the type of society we
have created at what may well be the be
ginning of a troubled time. Nowhere is
this done more effectively than in Bruce
Springsteen's Nebraska, quoted
throughout this column.

It is music to which every person
should listen. It is about an America
which we are fostering, an America
where some are driven to passive sub
mission, others to sudden violence. No
more hope. No more dreams.
"I can't say that I am sorry for the
things that we have done I At least for a
little while sir, me and her we had us some
fun."
It is an America that few see and
fewer wish to understand.
Similarly, Nebraska, when
was an album to which few wished
listen. Many groaned when they per
ceived the sudden shift in Springsteen's
music and concerns. It was just too
dark. They wanted Bruce to rock out, to
entertain them at parties.
Most likely, Nebraska will face the
same fate as Beggar's Banquet. People
will show a curious interest in it for a
while; the critical acclaim will be never
ending, for a few months. Then it will
fade from the mind. The radio stations
will carry on with "Bom to Run,"
"Badlands," and "Hungry Heart"
while the images of "Mansion on the

Hill," "Johnny 99," and "Nebraska"
will soon reach no one.
"Steel gates that completely surround,
sir, the mansion on the hill."
So how much better are we than
those who see nothing wrong in simply
enjoying some catchy tunes and
getting, those who see nothing wrong
the picture of Frank Sinatra singing "A
land proud and free, that's what Ameri
ca is to me."
How can we criticize unless we recog
nize the importance of Springsteen's vi
sion, a vision that drove him to take the
risk of Nebraska? It will mean the rejec
tion, at least for a time of the energy and
exuberance we demand from our mu
sic. It will mean sitting and listening to
every word of an artist who perceives
the true state of our union.
"You want to know why I did what I
done. I guess there's just a meanness in
this world."
For those who have been with us
from the beginning, that's the last
until number one makes a comebacÂ®
next time.

How can we criticize unless we recognize the #
importance of Springsteen's vision, a vision
that drove him to take the risk of Nebraska ?
"Me and her went for a ride sir, and 10
innocent people died." The music is a
very special and feeling friend.
"Everybody's got a hungry heart,"
Bruce Springsteen sings, and it is very
popular indeed. He leaps over an amp
in concert; he keeps the pace quick and
everyone is on his feet, ever so happy.
He plays "Rosalita" and no one can
complain.
But then he sits and somberly sings a
rendition of "This Land Is Your
Land," because he feels he must; many
of the faithful get very restless.
It is all music; it all entertains one
person or another. We should just leave
it at that.
But there is more; there must be more
whether we like it or not. Every song
has something to say, whether it be in
sightful or frivolous, whether it wants
to or not. Some music is blind and some
reveals a vision clear and true.
So Frank Sinatra sings "What is
America to Me." He sings of dreams
and democracy, of the beautiful and the
free, of the brave and the hopeful. He
sings and listening makes so many feel
so good. He prefaces the song by saying
how patriotic he feels, how good he
feels about our fair land. Some see irony
in the moment; some feel angry. Some
see the truth.
"Once I was a rich man, now I am so
poor."
Mick Jagger felt angry in 1965 when
the Rolling Stones released Beggar's
Banquet. His anger, his thought,
doesn't get much air play. Many Stones
fans probably would not recognize
most of the songs on the album. You
won't hear "Jigsaw Puzzle" or "Salt of
the Earth" on the radio; once in a great
while "Sympathy for the Devil" or
"Street Fighting Man" may surface.
People can't dance to these songs;
they're not conducive to jumping up
and down. But, the songs tried to tell
the truth; they tried to dig deeper; they
tried to show people the unpleasant, but
all too real, state of their lives and socie
ty. This was in the early days of a trou
bled time, when for a while no one
could be blind to the pain and injustices

his society had created, or at least to
the consequences of these creations.
"Mister the day my number comes in,
I ain't never gonna ride in no used car
again."
So now, in the fall of 1982, we have
the Frank Sinatra, in his tux
edo, smiling and singing blindly at the
Concert for the Americas. It is a simple,
unimportant scene, most will say, but in
that face one can see the ignorance of
millions. Once can see President Rea
gan proclaiming that 90 percent of all
Americans are getting along so very
nicely. One can see the upper-class pro
fessionals from their homes in the sub
urbs decrying their desperate predica
ment as overburdened taxpayers. One
can simply see a blindness to and com
plete misapprehension of the desper
ation and poverty in our midst.
In the music, we can see the blindness
or escapism, whichever you prefer, of
popular music throughout the '3os, '4os
arid 'sos. In away, the songs all did
mean something and are still very
portant. For those who wish to convey
truths of the time, the songs can be used
perfectly in movies for the purpose of
ironic commentary.

The fluffy songs of the '3os provided
devastating irony in the movie, Pennies
from Heaven , making the human misery
even more horrifying. Listening to
Sinatra sing "What is America to Me"
is no less devastating.
"Still at the end of every hard earned
day, people find some reason to believe."
Still, a few search for truth; a few re
fuse to blind themselves; a few face it.
