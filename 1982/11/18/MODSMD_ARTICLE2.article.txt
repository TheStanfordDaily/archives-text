# Inflation rate decrease alters tuition prediction
## 
### DAVID SANCHEZ Staff writer 
The unexpected drop in inflation is
responsible for the difference between
last year's projection for tuition in
creases for the next three years and the
current prediction, according to Prov
ost Albert Hastorf.
Last December the University
projected that tuition would rise 14 per
cent in the 1983-84 school year and 11
percent in the next two years. Now,
however, increases of 12, 9 and 9 per-
are predicted.
W The University bases its long-range
tuition forecasts on a formula which in
creases tuition by the predicted rate of
inflation plus additional costs. The add
on figure is partially determined by in
creases in the reai operating budget and
bv costs such as utility bills whiph are
expected to outstrip inflation next year.
Salaries, also, will stay ahead of the
inflation rate.
"We have been trying to move
salaries by faculty and staff and
people a little bit above the
Wrate of inflation," said Hastorf. He
noted that "faculty at most major uni
versities (including Stanford) lost
ground in the '7os ... in terms of
buying power of their salaries."
Thus, according to the Operating
Budget Guidelines (OBG) presented to
the Board of Trustees last March, the
University predicted an 8 percent rate
of inflation for the 1983-84, 1984-85

and 1985-86 academic years and added
further increases of 6, 3 and 3 percent
respectively to the inflation allowances.
Current predictions assume that
there will be a 6 percent inflation rate.
Student health services, the main
tenance of library acquisitions pro
grams and a certain amount of graduate
financial aid are also estimated to in
crease by more than the inflation rate
for at least the next three academic
years, according to the 1982-83 OBG.
Hastorf also attributed the greater
than-inflation tuition increase to an in
crease in the budget which will result
from consolidations and improve
ments, or expenses incurred in doing
"new and more things."
As examples, Hastorf cited the
Western Culture program and last
year's purchase of an $BOO,OOO com
puter to expand LOTS capacity.
The University is planning to de
crease consolidations and improve
ments next year by $400,000, according
to the preliminary financial forecast.
At 6 percent, the above-inflation in
crease for the 1983-84 academic year is
double the 3 percent predicted for the
next two years.
"In terms of expenses (and) certain
commitments" the University had, the
long-range forecast looked "as though
this (the 1983-84 academic year) was
going to be a somewhat tougher year,"
Hastorf explained.
