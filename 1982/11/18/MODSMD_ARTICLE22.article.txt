## Soloists together 
### PATRICK SULLIVAN 
All-star band concerts often turn into
lengthy jam sessions in which the over
all music gets sacrificed to the endless
dueling solos among players, in which
each tries to outshine the others. Per
haps many attendant at the seventh
night of the Kool Jazz Festival at Ma
sonic Auditorium thought this might be
true of the Great Quartet, but any such
fears disappeared upon hearing the ar
tistry of Freddie Hubbard, the
chromatic pianistics of McCoy
Tvner and melodic rhythms of Eddie
Gomez and Tony Williams. These di
verse musicians produced intricately
blended music, proving the worthiness
of their title.
The choice of the band's opening
tune, "Rhvthm-ning," written by com
plex composer Thelonious Monk,
showed their dedication to serious mu
sic. This song previewed the rest of the
night's performance. Repeatedly, the
band overcame apparent musical con
tradictions exhibiting advanced tech
nique while still sounding melodic;
straying from conventional jazz beats
and still swinging; and allowing other
soloists room and time to develop solos
while pushing them forward.
Perhaps trumpeter Freddie Hub
bard's solos benefited most from the
loose rhythm section. Last May at the
Berkeley Jazz Festival, despite the pres
ence of guests Joe Henderson and Bob
by Hutcherson, Hubbard's accompani
ment seemed constrained. But last
Wednesday night, backed by players
from different backgrounds who don't
play together regularly, the sum of

Hubbard and accompaniment sounded
complete. Tvner played classical
phrases, bassist Gomez exhibited his
stvle developed from his trio dates with
Chick Corea. William's didn't just keep
time on drums, he made them speak.
They allowed Hubbard to solo against
music which had more than one
dimension. Their music, which fully
complemented Hubbard's improvising,
could also stand alone.
Hubbard's style is based on his tone.
Clear, full and possessing great range, it
could possibly be the most beautiful in
all of jazz today. This tone, along with
Hubbard's ability to execute clean, fast
runs, represents his masterful tech
nique, which he developed into his per
sonal style. He utilized time and space
and because of this his solos seemed
possessed more of effects than of
straight melody. In their own way they
sounded perfect, and evoked moods
similar to his great solo on Herbie Han
cock's "Maiden Voyage."
Hubbard, however, was not the only
one who brought back memories of an
acoustic Hancock. On his solo piece,
"The Greeting," Tyner's phrasing
moved from the cool open style of Han
cock to a more atonal, percussive one
which hinted at a Cecil Taylor in
fluence. But at all times, his classical in
fluence moved him from one extreme to
another. He sounded once again like
the post-Coltrane McCoy Tyner of the
early '7os. He exhibited his great im
provisational skills by repeatedly de
veloping a phrase to its melodic limits,
them moving with ease into a new, dif

ferent phrase. He held the audience in
awe with these shimmering passages.
The audience was so quiet one could
hear Tvner's foot keeping time on the
stage floor.
When he played with the other, how
ever, he became more of what he once
was, the classical/jazz pianist who
could swing with John Coltrane. He
filled the spaces in Hubbard's solo
cleanly, hinting at counter melodies but
not enough to sidetrack the audience
from the soloist. His left hand walked
and played the beat more often here
than when soloing, but he hardly relied
on this format thrughout the concert.
At the end of each piece he'd quietly
stand and bow to the audience, which
reminded one of the subtle, serious mu
sical dedication that each member in
the Coltrane quartet played with. Tyner


Freddie Hubbard
came to play for himself, the audience
was secondary.
Drummer Tony Williams exhibited
his own dedication, first to the music
and then to his drumming. One of the
most melodic drummers around, Tony
long ago left conventional time-keeping
for a more expressive style. He man
aged to make the band swing despite us
ing drum beats far more complicated
the traditional jazz beat. Credit
this to his phrasing. He filled whenever
he felt like it, which provided him with a
voice as expressive as the others in the
band. Hubbard may have been the lead
er, counting the band off before each
song, but throughout the concert it was
Tony who had command, total control
of the mood. By playing louder, or by
utilizing more notes, he changed the
feeling of the music. At one point in
Gomez' solo on "Black Orpheus," he
dropped out completely, allowing
Cjomez more room to explore his
Vhelody and also giving the music a
mellower tone.
Another aspect of Tony's playing is
his taste: he knows when to speak and
when not to. Once during a rest in Hub
bard's solo, Tony filled the space with a
quarter note triplet on his bass drum.
Hardly complicated and not at all dis
turbing to Hubbard, this fill enhanced
the music as this point in the song. Wil
liams perhaps more than the others
contributed to the bands cohesiveness.
Gomez on bass played similar to Wil
liams on drums. Not content with
playing a walking bass, Gomez usually
kept time with short melodic runs and
fills. Slouched over his bass, eyes
£:losed, he seemed lost in the need of his
own expression, not limited by the oth
ers, yet always contributing, providing
the foundation for their music.
There were moments throughout the
concert when all four were playing but
no one seemed to have the spotlight.
Each player contributed to the music
o equally, and as a result the songs could
- only be defined as products of each
. players expression incomplete if one
voice were omitted. By the end of the
night the audience understobd this and
responded with a standing ovation that
did not end until after the lights came
on. This same audience, which two
hours earlier failed to stand for jazz
t great Sonny Rollins, was expressing
.-their appreciation for the sincere music
•that the Great Quartet produced as a
whole.
