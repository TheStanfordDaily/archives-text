## Soloists together 
### PATRICK SULLIVAN 
All-star band concerts often turn into
lengthy jam sessions in which the over
all music gets sacrificed to the endless
dueling solos among players, in which
each tries to outshine the others. Per
haps many attendant at the seventh
night of the Kool Jazz Festival at Ma
sonic Auditorium thought this might be
true of the Great Quartet, but any such
fears disappeared upon hearing the ar
tistry of Freddie Hubbard, the
chromatic pianistics of McCoy
Tvner and melodic rhythms of Eddie
Gomez and Tony Williams. These di
verse musicians produced intricately
blended music, proving the worthiness
of their title.
The choice of the band's opening
tune, "Rhvthm-ning," written by com
plex composer Thelonious Monk,
showed their dedication to serious mu
sic. This song previewed the rest of the
night's performance. Repeatedly, the
band overcame apparent musical con
tradictions exhibiting advanced tech
nique while still sounding melodic;
straying from conventional jazz beats
and still swinging; and allowing other
soloists room and time to develop solos
while pushing them forward.
Perhaps trumpeter Freddie Hub
bard's solos benefited most from the
loose rhythm section. Last May at the
Berkeley Jazz Festival, despite the pres
ence of guests Joe Henderson and Bob
by Hutcherson, Hubbard's accompani
ment seemed constrained. But last
Wednesday night, backed by players
from different backgrounds who don't
play together regularly, the sum of

Hubbard and accompaniment sounded
complete. Tvner played classical
phrases, bassist Gomez exhibited his
stvle developed from his trio dates with
Chick Corea. William's didn't just keep
time on drums, he made them speak.
They allowed Hubbard to solo against
music which had more than one
dimension. Their music, which fully
complemented Hubbard's improvising,
could also stand alone.
Hubbard's style is based on his tone.
Clear, full and possessing great range, it
could possibly be the most beautiful in
all of jazz today. This tone, along with
Hubbard's ability to execute clean, fast
runs, represents his masterful tech
nique, which he developed into his per
sonal style. He utilized time and space
and because of this his solos seemed
possessed more of effects than of
straight melody. In their own way they
sounded perfect, and evoked moods
similar to his great solo on Herbie Han
cock's "Maiden Voyage."
Hubbard, however, was not the only
one who brought back memories of an
acoustic Hancock. On his solo piece,
"The Greeting," Tyner's phrasing
moved from the cool open style of Han
cock to a more atonal, percussive one
which hinted at a Cecil Taylor in
fluence. But at all times, his classical in
fluence moved him from one extreme to
another. He sounded once again like
the post-Coltrane McCoy Tyner of the
early '7os. He exhibited his great im
provisational skills by repeatedly de
veloping a phrase to its melodic limits,
them moving with ease into a new, dif

ferent phrase. He held the audience in
awe with these shimmering passages.
The audience was so quiet one could
hear Tvner's foot keeping time on the
stage floor.
When he played with the other, how
ever, he became more of what he once
was, the classical/jazz pianist who
could swing with John Coltrane. He
filled the spaces in Hubbard's solo
cleanly, hinting at counter melodies but
not enough to sidetrack the audience
from the soloist. His left hand walked
and played the beat more often here
than when soloing, but he hardly relied
on this format thrughout the concert.
At the end of each piece he'd quietly
stand and bow to the audience, which
reminded one of the subtle, serious mu
sical dedication that each member in
the Coltrane quartet played with. Tyner
