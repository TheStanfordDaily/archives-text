# Two great quartets jazz the Bay Area
## Ancient Modern 
### TREY ELLIS CHRIS WALTERS 
What did your grandparents do Fri
day night? Odds are they weren't bring
ing a sold out Warfield audience to its
feet. But that is exactly what the aging
vet vibrant Modern Jazz Quartet did, as
part of the Kool Jazz Festival, playing
for the first time in the Bay Area since
their Davies Hall reunion concert two
years ago.
The MJQ has since 1962 consistently
composed and played some of the most
sophisticated jazz to come out of the
bebop tradition, and their Friday night
show was no exception. The hour long
gig included everything from haunting,
oriental melodies to down and dirty
blues amazing diversity from all per
cussive combo of bass, drums, piano
and vibes.
Identically decked out in black tuxes,
the four tall black men sauntered on
stage with the self-assured grace of leg
ends, and kicked into an upbeat blues
piece. Milt Jackson vigorously attacked

his vibes, rapping out his solo with
amazing finesse and speed. When he
finished, he stepped back for a moment
and stared at the instrument, seemingly
asking himself: "Did I do that?"
Pianist John Lewis, on the other
hand, played a simple, refined solo, tap
ping at only one or two repeated notes.
This minimalist style suits him well
since he considers himself more a com
poser than a technically proficient mu
sician.
Because of this difference in style,
Jackson was more the frontman. He
was much less dependent onThe group's
rhythmic dynamics than Lewis who
used the bass and drums heavily for
support. Still, Jackson was no show
boat. In fact every member of the group
had an almost empathetic sense of
where the others were going not so
surprising after 30 years of playing to
gether.
Drummer Connie Kaye and bassist
Percy Heath, though showing little im
provisational flair, played with techni

cal perfection. The most pleasing aspect
of Heath's bass playing was his deep
and rich tone while Kaye's drumming
consistently kept clean, crisp and clear.
The band played old standards writ
ten mainly by themselves. Although
some numbers such as "Traveling" and
"Odds Against Tomorrow" were tradi
tional blues, other strayed far from the
jazz mainstream. "The Cylinder," for
example, was a stacatto piece using
chimes and bells to create a clock-like
beat, and "The Jasmine Tree," true to
its name, sounded very oriental, like

something you'd expect at the Korean,
not the Kool, Jazz Festival.
The audience, a mixture of old blacks
and young white BMW-driving law
yers, jumped to its feet at the end of the
show. Perhaps realizing how short a set
they had played, the quartet struck into
two lengthy encores. Then as silently as
they had entered, they left, to wild ap
plause. Moments later, the fat emcee
told us to clear out.
The evening before the Modern Jazz
Quartet show, Joe Pass opened with a
short set of superb solo guitar. Relying

almost entirely on improvisation, his
lengthy jams were only loosely based on
standard blues rifts. Although Pass
looked dwarfed alone up there on the
large stage, his sound was anything but
small. Closing his eyes and gritting his
teeth, he dragged two instruments
worth of sound out of his guitar. In fact
it seemed that if he had scratched his
bald head with his picking hand, one
guitar would have kept on playing.
Carmen Mc√üae, who followed Pass,
belted out her usual set of sultry blues.
This sexy grandma, in the tradition of

Billie Holiday and Dinah Washington,
comfortably bridged the gap from scat
to Streisand. But her best songs were
jazz standards like Brubeck's "Take
Five" and Monks' extremely com
plicated "Straight, No Chaser." Al
though her husky voice thins on some
of the high notes, her ability to sing in
and around the rhythms of her band
was extraordinary.
So in this age of Social Security cuts,
callous grandchildren and overpriced
nursing homes it's good to see a bunch
of old people having this much fun.
