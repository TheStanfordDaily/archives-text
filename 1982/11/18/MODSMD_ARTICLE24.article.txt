# A 						revamped Translator speaks easy
## 
### TERRI SUTTON 
Translator visited Palo Alto last
Sunday but apparently only a few
people got the message. Lead singer
and guitarist Steve Barton noticing
the chilly and cavernous reaches of
the Keystone, commented: "There
aren't many of us, so we're going to
have to crowd together to keep
warm."
Crowd we did, but not for heat.
With a few exceptions, Translator
played a set designed to incite the lis
tener: to dance, to ponder, to spread
the word (so to speak).
Translator began in 1979, gigging
around Los Angeles. After nearly a
year feeling lost among the not-so
angelic hard-core punks of that
heavenly city, the group transferred
to San Francisco meanwhile pick
ing up a producer in David Kahne
and eventually a record label: 415
Records.
Last spring, they recorded the
album Heartbeats and Triggers for
415, which was distributed by Co
lumbia, then they released a lovely
and successful single: "Ev
erywhere That I'm Not." You might

recognize it better as the song about
someone being in Tokyo, or New
York, or Moscow in any case, ev
erywhere the singer is not (hence, the
title).
And, if you've got a retentive
mind, you might even remember
Translator as the strange-looking
band at TKB's "World's Largest
Study Break" last spring, the only
group there who did not play covers
of Triumph, Deep Purple or Led
Zepplin.
No one danced last spring; they
were too stunned.
Last Sunday, though, the legs
were twitching, owing not only a
more receptive audience, but to a
large improvement on the part of
Translator itself. Having a national
tour 55 gigs in 64 days under
their hats has definitely sharpened
up the band's act: they sang in tune
more of the time, jumped around ex
citedly, even added some between
song chatter.
And the songs! Lyrics which last
spring seemed vaguely silly in their
sincerity were effectively shored up
this time with lots of pounding

guitar. Translator has been depicted
in the press as a sort of Byrds-like
folk-rock group, but they junked the
acoustic guitars this show and con
centrated on a crushing Joy
Divisionish attack of dense sound.
In the same way, the set em
phasized more of the raucous songs
of Heartbeats and Triggers, includ
ing only two of the poppier tunes:
the old single, "Everywhere That
I'm Not" and "Everywhere" (no,
not a typo).
Standouts were "Necessary Spin
ning," a driving number about
childhood reminiscent of the Gang
of Four, the eerily seductive "Favor
ite Drug," and their final selection,

"Sleeps wHTclraeicrfSel
missiles hidden in grain silos in the
United States and the Soviet Union
and contains a killer hook that I've
been humming ever since the show.
Along with a few other unfamiliar
tunes, the band also previewed their
new single "Break Down Barriers,"
which, again, seems much less
cheerily poppy than their first single,
although still catchy.
Translator's sincere politi
cal/social awareness apparent in
Barton's playful warning that "we
might not be alive tomorrow"
gives their songs continuity and
thematic strength. The power of the
band, though, lies in their melding of
these themes to danceable, original
music; like Gang of Four, Trans
lator wants to entertain while it
(hopefully) reminds us of contem
porary problems.
And hey! They encored with a
high-speed, wild rendition of "You
Make Me Dizzy, Miss Lizzy."
few of us there filled the dance floor,
and left, warm and happily ex
hausted, at the show's end.
So where were you?
