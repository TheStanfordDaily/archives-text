# John Prine: not quite on the road again

### TIM WHALEN 
John Prine
The Old Waldorf
Friday, November 12

Twelve years ago, when Kris Kristof
ferson "discovered" him playing in a
Chicago dive, John Prine was heralded
as a "new Dylan." Along with his friend
Steve "City of New Orleans" Good
man, Prine was expected to become the
chronicler of the American mood in the
'7os.
But something went wrong. Prine
played his tunes and people listened,
but not in the empathetic droves pre
dicted. Perhaps what was missing were
the sweeping Dylanesque statements,
but this was never Prine's intention. His
songs center on his intimate observa
tions of Americana. Prine claimed "lat
ter-day rockabilly is the mood I'm aim
ing for," but his often bitter insight
seemed to both bless and curse his
work.
In 1975 Common Sense, the album
which was hoped to be his big break
through, sold miserably and Prine slow
ly settled into (he woodwork of Ameri
can music but against the grain.
Last Friday night he came out of the
woodwork to perform at the Old
Waldorf in San Francisco in a show
that highlighted Prine's music at its
best, and its worst.
A sold-out crowd enthusiastically
welcomed Prine as he stepped onto the
stage but quieted down as soon as the
music began. Backed with a bass and a
steel-pedal guitar, he stroked his old,
battered Martin acoustic through a set
of bland, country/rock hybrid tunes
and within 10 minutes had the entire
audience enraptured nonetheless.
It is difficult to explain how Prine can
pull this off. He plays the guitar with a
style and expression that conveys
amusement, and a bit of surprise that he
is actually making music. At the same

time, his coarse, gravelly lyrics demand
to be taken seriously. Only he could de
liver lines like "Father forgive us for
what we must do/You forgive us, and
we'll forgive you/We'll forgive each
other 'til we both turn blue/Then we'll
whistle and go fishing in heaven," from
his latest hit "Fish and Whistle" with a
feeling of conviction.
His enthusiasm has its drawbacks
though. Half-way through his fourth
tune, a Prine classic called "Come back
to us, Barbara Lewis Hari Krishna
Beauregard," his E-string snapped.
Covering nicely, however, he continued
a capella "My spirit's broke (so's my
string), my mind's a joke, and gettin'
up's real hard." Meanwhile another
Martin was strapped around him, the
audience laughed at his ad lib, and
Prine blithely continued to tell his bitter
yet tongue-in-cheek tale of a guy who's
girl runs away to join a cult.
Suddenly, the pace of the evening
picked up as Prine traded in his Martin
for a Stratocaster electric and lashed
into a set of loud, rockabilly style songs
with titles like "(I'm going steady with)
Iron Ore Betty." Prine was having a
good time, but at the expense of his au
dience who reverted their attentions to'
their nachos and pitchers of beer.
This set focused on the lead guitarist,
a huge, hairy red-head who appeared
more at home playing rock than Prine's
more well-known country tunes. Prine
identified him as Philip Donnolly from
Dublin, Scotland, and the bass player, a
shy-looking blonde who looked like
someone's little sister, as Rachel Pierce
from Nashville.
Returning to his country, repertoire,
Prine soon started into "Illegal Smile,"
his ballad to pot-smokers which begins
"When I got up this morning/ Things
were looking bad/ Seemed like total si
lence/ Was the only friend I had/ A
bowl of oatmeal tried to stare me down

... and won/ It was 12 o'clock
before I realized I was having ... no
fun." and concludes "You may see me
tonight with an illegal smile/ It don't
cost very much but it lasts a long while/
Won't you please tell the man I didn't
kill anyone/ No I'm just trying to have
me some fun."
This is prime Prine. The music is
catchy, the lyrics are funny and in
sightful. The song is so subtle that ABC
made it the theme of a TV special on
Texas without realizing its reference.
This is what sells out the Waldorf.
The rest of the evening was well
rounded by many of his better-known
songs. "Sam Stone," one of the last
great American protest songs brought a
tear to my eye, just as it always does.
The irony in the lyrics of "That's the
Way the World Goes 'Round" where
Prine gets stuck in a bathtub "naked as
the eyes of a clown" brought a chuckle
from the crowd.
Prine moved into the spotlight to de
liver "Hello in there" in a solo. Proba
bly the greatest song Prine ever wrote, it
portrays the ostracism of the elderly in
our society in away that elicits emotion
in adolescents as well as octogenarians
"You know old trees just grow
stronger/ Old rivers grow wilder every
day/ But old people just grow lone
some/ Waiting for someone to say/
'Hello in there/ Hello.' "
Prine wrapped up his hour-and-a
half performance with his classic foot
stomper "Please Don't Bury Me," a
humerous look at organ donation:
"Give my stomach to Milwaukee if they
run out of beer/ Put my socks in a cedar
box - Just get 'em out of here/ Venus de
Milo can have my arms. Look out! I've
got her nose/ Send my mouth way
down South and give my love to Rose."
When the crowd demanded an en
core, Prine came back with an un
characteristic gesture. Rather than

placating the crowd with "Dear Abby,"
a light ode to advice columnists, which
was clearly expected, he drove into a
pair of unknown rockabilly pieces and
finished with a hauntingly downbeat
version of his popular "Saddle in the
Rain." A more inappropriate time
couldn't be found to drop these ringers
on a crowd eager to be pleased.
I was left with the impression that
Prine wanted to be liked rather than re
spected. It was sad to watch Prine de
liver a mediocre performance while
seeming to require an inordinant
amount of effort. He went through all
the familiar motions but the confidence

and spontanaiety were sorely missing in
the rendering of old tunes as well as in
the substance of his new material.
What the show did portray were the
multi-talented faces which John Prine
can wear: the folksie teller of tall tales,
the sensitive singer/songwriter, the
country star, the rock & roller. Some
thing about the singer's character can
be seen in his own words; "Nobody will
know if you're off key as long as you're
sincerely off key." But Prine's greatest
attribute was summed up ten years ago
by Kristofferson when he said, "The
guy is 28 years old but he writes songs
like he was 100."

Dublin, Scotland, and the bass player, a
shy-looking blonde who looked like
someone's little sister, as Rachel Pierce
from Nashville.
Returning to his country, repertoire,
Prine soon started into "Illegal Smile,"
his ballad to pot-smokers which begins
"When I got up this morning/ Things
were looking bad/ Seemed like total si
lence/ Was the only friend I had/ A
bowl of oatmeal tried to stare me down

... and won/ It was 12 o'clock
before I realized I was having ... no
fun." and concludes "You may see me
tonight with an illegal smile/ It don't
cost very much but it lasts a long while/
Won't you please tell the man I didn't
kill anyone/ No I'm just trying to have
me some fun."
This is prime Prine. The music is
catchy, the lyrics are funny and in
sightful. The song is so subtle that ABC
made it the theme of a TV special on
Texas without realizing its reference.
This is what sells out the Waldorf.
The rest of the evening was well
rounded by many of his better-known
songs. "Sam Stone," one of the last
great American protest songs brought a
tear to my eye, just as it always does.
The irony in the lyrics of "That's the
Way the World Goes 'Round" where
Prine gets stuck in a bathtub "naked as
the eyes of a clown" brought a chuckle
from the crowd.
Prine moved into the spotlight to de
liver "Hello in there" in a solo. Proba
bly the greatest song Prine ever wrote, it
portrays the ostracism of the elderly in
our society in away that elicits emotion
in adolescents as well as octogenarians
"You know old trees just grow
stronger/ Old rivers grow wilder every
day/ But old people just grow lone
some/ Waiting for someone to say/
'Hello in there/ Hello.' "
Prine wrapped up his hour-and-a
half performance with his classic foot
stomper "Please Don't Bury Me," a
humerous look at organ donation:
"Give my stomach to Milwaukee if they
run out of beer/ Put my socks in a cedar
box - Just get 'em out of here/ Venus de
Milo can have my arms. Look out! I've
got her nose/ Send my mouth way
down South and give my love to Rose."
When the crowd demanded an en
core, Prine came back with an un
characteristic gesture. Rather than

placating the crowd with "Dear Abby,"
a light ode to advice columnists, which
was clearly expected, he drove into a
pair of unknown rockabilly pieces and
finished with a hauntingly downbeat
version of his popular "Saddle in the
Rain." A more inappropriate time
couldn't be found to drop these ringers
on a crowd eager to be pleased.
I was left with the impression that
Prine wanted to be liked rather than re
spected. It was sad to watch Prine de
liver a mediocre performance while
seeming to require an inordinant
amount of effort. He went through all
the familiar motions but the confidence

and spontanaiety were sorely missing in
the rendering of old tunes as well as in
the substance of his new material.
What the show did portray were the
multi-talented faces which John Prine
can wear: the folksie teller of tall tales,
the sensitive singer/songwriter, the
country star, the rock & roller. Some
thing about the singer's character can
be seen in his own words; "Nobody will
know if you're off key as long as you're
sincerely off key." But Prine's greatest
attribute was summed up ten years ago
by Kristofferson when he said, "The
guy is 28 years old but he writes songs
like he was 100."

John Prine
The Old Waldorf
Friday, November 12

Twelve years ago, when Kris Kristof
ferson "discovered" him playing in a
Chicago dive, John Prine was heralded
as a "new Dylan." Along with his friend
Steve "City of New Orleans" Good
man, Prine was expected to become the
chronicler of the American mood in the
'7os.
But something went wrong. Prine
played his tunes and people listened,
but not in the empathetic droves pre
dicted. Perhaps what was missing were
the sweeping Dylanesque statements,
but this was never Prine's intention. His
songs center on his intimate observa
tions of Americana. Prine claimed "lat
ter-day rockabilly is the mood I'm aim
ing for," but his often bitter insight
seemed to both bless and curse his
work.
In 1975 Common Sense, the album
which was hoped to be his big break
through, sold miserably and Prine slow
ly settled into (he woodwork of Ameri
can music but against the grain.
Last Friday night he came out of the
woodwork to perform at the Old
Waldorf in San Francisco in a show
that highlighted Prine's music at its
best, and its worst.
A sold-out crowd enthusiastically
welcomed Prine as he stepped onto the
stage but quieted down as soon as the
music began. Backed with a bass and a
steel-pedal guitar, he stroked his old,
battered Martin acoustic through a set
of bland, country/rock hybrid tunes
and within 10 minutes had the entire
audience enraptured nonetheless.
It is difficult to explain how Prine can
pull this off. He plays the guitar with a
style and expression that conveys
amusement, and a bit of surprise that he
is actually making music. At the same

time, his coarse, gravelly lyrics demand
to be taken seriously. Only he could de
liver lines like "Father forgive us for
what we must do/You forgive us, and
we'll forgive you/We'll forgive each
other 'til we both turn blue/Then we'll
whistle and go fishing in heaven," from
his latest hit "Fish and Whistle" with a
feeling of conviction.
His enthusiasm has its drawbacks
though. Half-way through his fourth
tune, a Prine classic called "Come back
to us, Barbara Lewis Hari Krishna
Beauregard," his E-string snapped.
Covering nicely, however, he continued
a capella "My spirit's broke (so's my
string), my mind's a joke, and gettin'
up's real hard." Meanwhile another
Martin was strapped around him, the
audience laughed at his ad lib, and
Prine blithely continued to tell his bitter
yet tongue-in-cheek tale of a guy who's
girl runs away to join a cult.
Suddenly, the pace of the evening
picked up as Prine traded in his Martin
for a Stratocaster electric and lashed
into a set of loud, rockabilly style songs
with titles like "(I'm going steady with)
Iron Ore Betty." Prine was having a
good time, but at the expense of his au
dience who reverted their attentions to'
their nachos and pitchers of beer.
This set focused on the lead guitarist,
a huge, hairy red-head who appeared
more at home playing rock than Prine's
more well-known country tunes. Prine
identified him as Philip Donnolly from
Dublin, Scotland, and the bass player, a
shy-looking blonde who looked like

thing about the singer's character can
be seen in his own words; "Nobody will
know if you're off key as long as you're
sincerely off key." But Prine's greatest
attribute was summed up ten years ago
by Kristofferson when he said, "The
guy is 28 years old but he writes songs
like he was 100."
