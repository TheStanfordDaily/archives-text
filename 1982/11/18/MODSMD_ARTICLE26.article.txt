In the page one story on toxic wastes published yesterday,
it was reported that in a proposed waste disposal system,
wastes would be transported to an interim disposal site on
campus. In fact, the proposal does not call for the disposal of
wastes on campus, but rather for the storage of wastes on
campus and their subsequent disposal off campus.
That article also stated that new incineration facilities are
needed to dispose of the chemicals properly. The University
has stated a need for new incineration facilities for the
biological wastes produced by the Stanford Hospital. The
University does not burn toxic chemicals.
The Daily regrets the errors.
