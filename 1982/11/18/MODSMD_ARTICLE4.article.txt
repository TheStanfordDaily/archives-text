Reagan hints of Jan. 1 tax cut

Washington President Reagan said yesterday that he may ask Congress
to move up a scheduled 10 percent tax cut from next July 1 to Jan. 1 to pro
vide an "appealing" stimulant for the sagging economy.
The change, which would add $ 14 billion to consumer buying power in the
first half of 1983, was proposed by Treasury Secretary Donald Regan to spur
economic recovery.
The president, who spoke with reporters on a Florida trip before returning
to the White House, said that no decision has been made, but "we are talking
about it."
The possibility of a speedup in the tax cut was raised as the Commerce
Department reported a sharp increase in October in the number of permits
for future home construction an encouraging development that was
hailed by the housing industry.
Permits were issued in October at an annual rate of 1.18 million housing
units, up 17.7 percent from September and 60 percent above the figure for
October of last year.
Work began on new houses at an annual rate of 1.12 million last month,
up 1 percent from September, the department said.
On a grimmer note, the Federal Reserve Board reported that nearly one
third of U.S: factory capacity remained idle last month. The 68.4 percent use
of manufacturing capacity was the worst on record since figures were col
lected starting in 1948 and dipped below the 69.0 percent recorded in the
1975 recession.
Some of the president's top advisers, including chief White House econo
mist Martin Feldstein and Budget Director David Stockman, reportedly op
pose moving up the effective date of the tax reduction.
Opponents of a tax cut speed-up noted that it would increase a budget def
icit already estimated at at least $ 175 billion and give only a mild boost to the
economy even if consumers decide to spend the money rather than save it.
While a speed-up would put more money in consumers' hands, Feldstein
said it would not provide an equivalent increase in economic growth'. As a
result, he said, it would significantly add to the "crowding out" of private
borrowers by the need to finance the public debt and thus reduce investment
and worsen the balance of trade.
If Reagan made the request and Congress failed to approve it promptly, he
said, it would lose its impact as a shot in the arm for the economy in the
opening weeks of 1983.
Some Democrats in Congress have discussed proposals to repeal, delay or
modify the projected 1983 tax cut.

Ex-CIA agent found guilty

Alexandria, Va. Edwin Wilson, the former Central Intelligence Agency
undercover agent who was a fugitive in Tripoli for two years, was convicted
yesterday of illegally aiding the Libyan regime by exporting weapons from
the United States in 1979.
In the first of the four federal trials that Wilson, 54, is scheduled to face, a
jury deliberated four hours before convicting the millionaire entrepreneur
on seven counts of conspiracy and firearms violations.
Wilson, who received the verdict impassively with his hands
clasped behind him, was acquitted on an eighth charge of ship
ping handguns in interstate commerce without a dealer's license.
U.S. District Judge Richard Williams set Dec. 17 for sentenc
ing. Wilson, who will remain in custody on $20 million bond,
faces a maximum sentence of 39 years in prison and $240,000 in
fines.
Wilson's attorney, Herald Price Fahringer, said that he would
appeal the conviction. Fahringer told reporters that judicial rul
ings had severely restricted his planned defense that Wilsonfelt
he was still helping his government.
Chief prosecutor Theodore Greenberg told jurors that the
weapons charges had a larger significance. By illegally shipping
four handguns and an Army rifle to Libyan officials, Wilson had
demonstrated his ability to supply military goods to them and
that led to his signing a $22 million contract with Libya,
Greenberg said.
Evidence during the two-day trial showed that Wilson had
directed associates to buy four used pistols and an M-16 auto
matic rifle in North Carolina and Washington, D.C., for delivery
to Libyan intelligence officials in Bonn, West Germany.
The weapons were shipped to Europe in violation of U.S. ex
port laws.
Wilson had worked for the CIA for 15 years and for a secret
naval intelligence unit for six years before becoming a busi
nessman.
Fahringer, Wilson's attorney, had vowed last July that he
would introduce "classified information" that would "shake the
CIA to its foundations." He said that Wilson was gathering in
telligence for the CIA while living in Libya, particularly data on
sophisticated electronic Soviet equipment that Libya had
purchased.
But after hearing arguments in closed session and examining
secret documents, U.S. District Judge Oren Lewis ruled on Oct.
29 that no classified material was relevant to Wilson's defense.
Pentagon plans polygraph use
Washington — The Pentagon has drafted a directive author
izing a vast expansion of the use of lie detector tests for govern
ment employees.
Polygraph examinations could be used for everything from
screening job applicants to tracking down leaks to the press un
der the draft directive obtained by The Washington Post and con
firmed by the Pentagon yesterday as being under review.
A top Defense Department official acknowledged that lie de
tector tests could be used more widely if the draft is adopted than
under a 1975 directive now in force, but he stressed that govern
ment employees still would have the right to refuse to take them.
Hundreds of Pentagon employees in particularly sensitive
jobs, however, are being asked to sign forms waiving their right
to refuse to take lie detector tests, said the official, who asked not
to be identified.
The 1975 directive emphasizes that the polygraph should be
used sparingly, ordering Pentagon executives to "preclude its use
in cases other than serious criminal cases, national security in
vestigations and highly sensitive national security access
cases. .. ."
Pentagon officials described the draft directive as "an update"
which would provide "additional insurance" against serious se
curity breaches. Critics, including some active duty military of
ficers and Pentagon civilians, contended that the Reagan admin
istration was trying to intimidate Pentagon employees.
Factory use hits new low
Washington — About one-third of the production lines at U.S.
factories stood idle last month as the recession deepened, in what
one economist called a "near depression." The 68.4 percent fac
tory-use rate reported yesterday was the worst on record.
For the present, however, the Federal Reserve Board's fac
tory-use report was nothing but bad news. For example:
•The decline was the 13th in 15 months. And rather than get
ting smaller, the monthly drops have been getting larger: 0.2 per
centage point in August, 0.6 point in September and now 0.8
point in October.
•There were new declines in two major industries: Factory use
fell to 49.7 percent for automakers and to 42 percent for iron and
steel producers. The latter figure was that industry's lowest since
a big 1959 strike stifled output.
•For the first time in the recession, overall factory use fell
below the 1975 low of 69 percent, a figure that had been the low
est level in statistics going back to 1948.
Allen Sinai, a vice president with Data Resources Inc., said the
new operating rate "is further evidence that the U.S. economy
has suffered a near depression over the past few years" as a result
of efforts to bring down the high inflation rates of the 1970s.
Freed American mercenaries return home
Paris — Three homeward-bound Americans arrived on a
night flight from Africa yesterday after Angola released the two ,
mercenaries and pilot from prison in exchange for three Soviet

soldiers and 94 Angolan fighters.
Bypassing customs, the trio was whisked away by U.S. Em
bassy personnel after landing at 6:10 a.m. (9:10 p ; m. Tuesday
PST) aboard a commercial flight from Zambia. They were the
first to disembark from the French UTA airliner.
The men were due to arrive at Kennedy Airport in New York
at 11:05 a.m. PST aboard a TWA flight from Paris.
Mercenaries Gary Acker, 28, of Sacramento, Calif., and Ar
gentine-born Gustavo Grillo, 36, of Jersey City, N.J., had been
imprisoned since their capture in the 1975-76 Angolan civil war.
Geoffrey Tyler, 32, of Lakeland, Fla., was arrested in 1981 af
ter a forced landing in a light plane he was delivering to a cus
tomer.
Angola's Marxist government freed them under a complex
prisoner exchange hammered out in negotiations involving five
countries.
One U.S. official said Washington is hopeful that the suc
cessful swap will help negotiations over independence for South
west Africa since many of the same parties are directly involved.
In Washington, State Department officials speaking privately
said the exchange was the result of complex negotiations that
began in August 1981 and involved the governments of the Unit
ed States, Soviet Union, Angola, South Africa and Zambia.
Anti-government Angolan guerrilla leader Jonas Savimbi also
was involved, as were the South African and international com
mittees of the Red Cross.
"We're very, very pleased about this," one U.S. official said.
"We've worked on it for more than a year."
Significant Soviet signal expected
Washington The Kremlin leadership could send the United
States "a very quick and simple" signal that it seeks better rela
tions by moving toward President Reagan's nuclear arms reduc
tion proposals, a senior defense official said yesterday.
"Movement on the president's proposals would be a clear and
as unmistakeable a signal as we could get," said the official, who
spoke with newsmen under ground rules protecting his anonymi
ty.
At the same time, the official indicated that hope for any early
changes in U.S.-Soviet relations, with the rise of Soviet leader
Yuri Andropov, is tempered by a general belief that Andropov
will probably move slowly in deviating from the late Leonid
Brezhnev's policies.
"It's a general conclusion that any new leader in the Soviet
Union is going to take some time before he makes any major
changes in policy," said the official.
"I don't think that there is any basis for any firm prediction as
to what may happen. . . .It's a closed society."
He discounted the significance of a reportedly warm talk in
Moscow between Andropov and Vice President George Bush,
who headed the U.S. delegation to the Brezhnev funeral Mon
day.
"I don't think that anybody feels there was anything very ma
jor" growing out of the Andropov-Bush talk, the senior defense
official said.
Defense analysts, both military and civilian, said last week
that Andropov is likely to preside over a committee type of lead
ership an approach that makes any sharp changes in policy
direction unlikely, at least for a couple of years.
Asked what other actions the Soviets could take to indicate
they want better relations with the United States, the senior of
ficial said the Kremlin could pull troops out of Afghanistan and
apply "less pressure on Poland."
On the subject of Soviet-Chinese relations, the official said he
doubts that recent diplomatic talks between the two Communist
led countries foreshadow a healing of their 20-year feud.
The United States would be deeply concerned if there were was
a re-establishment of a Soviet-Chinese coalition, the official said,
"but I don't think anything of that kind is portended."
Vesuvius dig yields valuable finds
Washington The discovery of more than 80 well-preserved
skeletons in an ancient Italian town buried by the eruption of
Mount Vesuvius provides a treasure trove of information on
how Romans lived 1900 years ago, scientists said Tuesday.
Most of the people of Herculaneum were believed to have es
caped the A.D. 79 volcanic eruption which buried neighboring
Pompeii and several other towns.
But discovery of so many bodies indicates the people of
Herculaneum were not spared in an eruption estimated to have
been 10 times more powerful than the 1980 Mount St. Helens ex
plosion.
At a briefing sponsored by the National Geographic Society,
scientists said they suspect that hundreds of skeletons might lie
beneath the volcanic debris.
The discovery is significant because few other complete
skeletons of ancient Romans survive and none are in this good a
state of preservation, they said. The society is sponsoring efforts
to preserve the skeletons, which are in danger of decay from ex
posure.
"It is really a very major find," said Dr. Sara Bisel, an
archeologist hired to preserve and analyze the bones. "This is the
first Roman population that we've ever had a chance to study."

Reagan, bishops clash over nuclear arms
Washington The Reagan administration told the nation's
Roman Catholic bishops yesterday that the bishops' projected
call for a nuclear freeze is based on "fundamental misreadings of
American policies" and ignores U.S. negotiations with the Sovi
et Union to achieve reductions in nuclear arsenals.
National Security adviser William Clark sent a seven-page let
ter to the National Conference of Catholic Bishops, laying out
the administrations position on the nuclear freeze movement.
The conference is holding its annual meeting here this week.
Clark, representing President Reagan, Secretary of Defense
Caspar Weinberger and Secretary of State George Shultz, told
Chicago Archbishop Joseph Bemardin, head of the committee
that drafted the letter that U.S. defense policy is "guided by mor
al considerations as compelling as any which have faced man
kind."
"The strategy of deterrence on which our policies are based is
not an end in itself," Clark wrote, "but a means to prevent war
and preserve the values we cherish individual liberty, freedom
of worship, freedom of conscience and expression, respect for the
sanctity of human life, and the rule of law through representative
institutions."
Army leads in Brazilian vote
Rio de Janeiro The Brazilian military's hold on power ap
peared unchallenged in the early counting of Monday's na
tionwide elections, but opposition parties were leading in several
major population areas.
Last night, more than 48 hours after the polls closed, only
about 10 percent of the estimated 55 million votes had been
counted as election workers struggled to tabulate the hand-writ
ten ballots.
The government's official Social Democratic Party was ahead
in 13 of 22 gubernatorial races while the main opposition group,
the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party, was leading in Seven
others. In other states the figures were too close or insignificant
to forecast an outcome.
Market gain reverses recent slide
New York The stock market chalked up a broad gain yester
day, reversing the slide of the past three sessions.
Financial services, bank and retailing stocks were among the
leaders of the rally.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which had fallen
46.73 points in the last three trading days, climbed 19.50 to
1,027.50.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange totaled 84.44 mil
lion shares, down from 102.91 million Tuesday.
Today's weather
Rain likely today, heavy at times. Highs in the upper 50s to low

and worsen the balance of trade.
If Reagan made the request and Congress failed to approve it promptly, he
said, it would lose its impact as a shot in the arm for the economy in the
opening weeks of 1983.
Some Democrats in Congress have discussed proposals to repeal, delay or
modify the projected 1983 tax cut.

Ex-CIA agent found guilty

Alexandria, Va. Edwin Wilson, the former Central Intelligence Agency
undercover agent who was a fugitive in Tripoli for two years, was convicted
yesterday of illegally aiding the Libyan regime by exporting weapons from
the United States in 1979.
In the first of the four federal trials that Wilson, 54, is scheduled to face, a
jury deliberated four hours before convicting the millionaire entrepreneur
on seven counts of conspiracy and firearms violations.
Wilson, who received the verdict impassively with his hands
clasped behind him, was acquitted on an eighth charge of ship
ping handguns in interstate commerce without a dealer's license.
U.S. District Judge Richard Williams set Dec. 17 for sentenc
ing. Wilson, who will remain in custody on $20 million bond,
faces a maximum sentence of 39 years in prison and $240,000 in
fines.
Wilson's attorney, Herald Price Fahringer, said that he would
appeal the conviction. Fahringer told reporters that judicial rul
ings had severely restricted his planned defense that Wilsonfelt
he was still helping his government.
Chief prosecutor Theodore Greenberg told jurors that the
weapons charges had a larger significance. By illegally shipping
four handguns and an Army rifle to Libyan officials, Wilson had
demonstrated his ability to supply military goods to them and
that led to his signing a $22 million contract with Libya,
Greenberg said.
Evidence during the two-day trial showed that Wilson had
directed associates to buy four used pistols and an M-16 auto
matic rifle in North Carolina and Washington, D.C., for delivery
to Libyan intelligence officials in Bonn, West Germany.
The weapons were shipped to Europe in violation of U.S. ex
port laws.
Wilson had worked for the CIA for 15 years and for a secret
naval intelligence unit for six years before becoming a busi
nessman.
Fahringer, Wilson's attorney, had vowed last July that he
would introduce "classified information" that would "shake the
CIA to its foundations." He said that Wilson was gathering in
telligence for the CIA while living in Libya, particularly data on
sophisticated electronic Soviet equipment that Libya had
purchased.
But after hearing arguments in closed session and examining
secret documents, U.S. District Judge Oren Lewis ruled on Oct.
29 that no classified material was relevant to Wilson's defense.
Pentagon plans polygraph use
Washington — The Pentagon has drafted a directive author
izing a vast expansion of the use of lie detector tests for govern
ment employees.
Polygraph examinations could be used for everything from
screening job applicants to tracking down leaks to the press un
der the draft directive obtained by The Washington Post and con
firmed by the Pentagon yesterday as being under review.
A top Defense Department official acknowledged that lie de
tector tests could be used more widely if the draft is adopted than
under a 1975 directive now in force, but he stressed that govern
ment employees still would have the right to refuse to take them.
Hundreds of Pentagon employees in particularly sensitive
jobs, however, are being asked to sign forms waiving their right
to refuse to take lie detector tests, said the official, who asked not
to be identified.
The 1975 directive emphasizes that the polygraph should be
used sparingly, ordering Pentagon executives to "preclude its use
in cases other than serious criminal cases, national security in
vestigations and highly sensitive national security access
cases. .. ."
Pentagon officials described the draft directive as "an update"
which would provide "additional insurance" against serious se
curity breaches. Critics, including some active duty military of
ficers and Pentagon civilians, contended that the Reagan admin
istration was trying to intimidate Pentagon employees.
Factory use hits new low
Washington — About one-third of the production lines at U.S.
factories stood idle last month as the recession deepened, in what
one economist called a "near depression." The 68.4 percent fac
tory-use rate reported yesterday was the worst on record.
For the present, however, the Federal Reserve Board's fac
tory-use report was nothing but bad news. For example:
•The decline was the 13th in 15 months. And rather than get
ting smaller, the monthly drops have been getting larger: 0.2 per
centage point in August, 0.6 point in September and now 0.8
point in October.
•There were new declines in two major industries: Factory use
fell to 49.7 percent for automakers and to 42 percent for iron and
steel producers. The latter figure was that industry's lowest since
a big 1959 strike stifled output.
•For the first time in the recession, overall factory use fell
below the 1975 low of 69 percent, a figure that had been the low
est level in statistics going back to 1948.
Allen Sinai, a vice president with Data Resources Inc., said the
new operating rate "is further evidence that the U.S. economy
has suffered a near depression over the past few years" as a result
of efforts to bring down the high inflation rates of the 1970s.
Freed American mercenaries return home
Paris — Three homeward-bound Americans arrived on a
night flight from Africa yesterday after Angola released the two ,
mercenaries and pilot from prison in exchange for three Soviet

soldiers and 94 Angolan fighters.
Bypassing customs, the trio was whisked away by U.S. Em
bassy personnel after landing at 6:10 a.m. (9:10 p ; m. Tuesday
PST) aboard a commercial flight from Zambia. They were the
first to disembark from the French UTA airliner.
The men were due to arrive at Kennedy Airport in New York
at 11:05 a.m. PST aboard a TWA flight from Paris.
Mercenaries Gary Acker, 28, of Sacramento, Calif., and Ar
gentine-born Gustavo Grillo, 36, of Jersey City, N.J., had been
imprisoned since their capture in the 1975-76 Angolan civil war.
Geoffrey Tyler, 32, of Lakeland, Fla., was arrested in 1981 af
ter a forced landing in a light plane he was delivering to a cus
tomer.
Angola's Marxist government freed them under a complex
prisoner exchange hammered out in negotiations involving five
countries.
One U.S. official said Washington is hopeful that the suc
cessful swap will help negotiations over independence for South
west Africa since many of the same parties are directly involved.
In Washington, State Department officials speaking privately
said the exchange was the result of complex negotiations that
began in August 1981 and involved the governments of the Unit
ed States, Soviet Union, Angola, South Africa and Zambia.
Anti-government Angolan guerrilla leader Jonas Savimbi also
was involved, as were the South African and international com
mittees of the Red Cross.
"We're very, very pleased about this," one U.S. official said.
"We've worked on it for more than a year."
Significant Soviet signal expected
Washington The Kremlin leadership could send the United
States "a very quick and simple" signal that it seeks better rela
tions by moving toward President Reagan's nuclear arms reduc
tion proposals, a senior defense official said yesterday.
"Movement on the president's proposals would be a clear and
as unmistakeable a signal as we could get," said the official, who
spoke with newsmen under ground rules protecting his anonymi
ty.
At the same time, the official indicated that hope for any early
changes in U.S.-Soviet relations, with the rise of Soviet leader
Yuri Andropov, is tempered by a general belief that Andropov
will probably move slowly in deviating from the late Leonid
Brezhnev's policies.
"It's a general conclusion that any new leader in the Soviet
Union is going to take some time before he makes any major
changes in policy," said the official.
"I don't think that there is any basis for any firm prediction as
to what may happen. . . .It's a closed society."
He discounted the significance of a reportedly warm talk in
Moscow between Andropov and Vice President George Bush,
who headed the U.S. delegation to the Brezhnev funeral Mon
day.
"I don't think that anybody feels there was anything very ma
jor" growing out of the Andropov-Bush talk, the senior defense
official said.
Defense analysts, both military and civilian, said last week
that Andropov is likely to preside over a committee type of lead
ership an approach that makes any sharp changes in policy
direction unlikely, at least for a couple of years.
Asked what other actions the Soviets could take to indicate
they want better relations with the United States, the senior of
ficial said the Kremlin could pull troops out of Afghanistan and
apply "less pressure on Poland."
On the subject of Soviet-Chinese relations, the official said he
doubts that recent diplomatic talks between the two Communist
led countries foreshadow a healing of their 20-year feud.
The United States would be deeply concerned if there were was
a re-establishment of a Soviet-Chinese coalition, the official said,
"but I don't think anything of that kind is portended."
Vesuvius dig yields valuable finds
Washington The discovery of more than 80 well-preserved
skeletons in an ancient Italian town buried by the eruption of
Mount Vesuvius provides a treasure trove of information on
how Romans lived 1900 years ago, scientists said Tuesday.
Most of the people of Herculaneum were believed to have es
caped the A.D. 79 volcanic eruption which buried neighboring
Pompeii and several other towns.
But discovery of so many bodies indicates the people of
Herculaneum were not spared in an eruption estimated to have
been 10 times more powerful than the 1980 Mount St. Helens ex
plosion.
At a briefing sponsored by the National Geographic Society,
scientists said they suspect that hundreds of skeletons might lie
beneath the volcanic debris.
The discovery is significant because few other complete
skeletons of ancient Romans survive and none are in this good a
state of preservation, they said. The society is sponsoring efforts
to preserve the skeletons, which are in danger of decay from ex
posure.
"It is really a very major find," said Dr. Sara Bisel, an
archeologist hired to preserve and analyze the bones. "This is the
first Roman population that we've ever had a chance to study."

Reagan, bishops clash over nuclear arms
Washington The Reagan administration told the nation's
Roman Catholic bishops yesterday that the bishops' projected
call for a nuclear freeze is based on "fundamental misreadings of
American policies" and ignores U.S. negotiations with the Sovi
et Union to achieve reductions in nuclear arsenals.
National Security adviser William Clark sent a seven-page let
ter to the National Conference of Catholic Bishops, laying out
the administrations position on the nuclear freeze movement.
The conference is holding its annual meeting here this week.
Clark, representing President Reagan, Secretary of Defense
Caspar Weinberger and Secretary of State George Shultz, told
Chicago Archbishop Joseph Bemardin, head of the committee
that drafted the letter that U.S. defense policy is "guided by mor
al considerations as compelling as any which have faced man
kind."
"The strategy of deterrence on which our policies are based is
not an end in itself," Clark wrote, "but a means to prevent war
and preserve the values we cherish individual liberty, freedom
of worship, freedom of conscience and expression, respect for the
sanctity of human life, and the rule of law through representative
institutions."
Army leads in Brazilian vote
Rio de Janeiro The Brazilian military's hold on power ap
peared unchallenged in the early counting of Monday's na
tionwide elections, but opposition parties were leading in several
major population areas.
Last night, more than 48 hours after the polls closed, only
about 10 percent of the estimated 55 million votes had been
counted as election workers struggled to tabulate the hand-writ
ten ballots.
The government's official Social Democratic Party was ahead
in 13 of 22 gubernatorial races while the main opposition group,
the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party, was leading in Seven
others. In other states the figures were too close or insignificant
to forecast an outcome.
Market gain reverses recent slide
New York The stock market chalked up a broad gain yester
day, reversing the slide of the past three sessions.
Financial services, bank and retailing stocks were among the
leaders of the rally.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which had fallen
46.73 points in the last three trading days, climbed 19.50 to
1,027.50.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange totaled 84.44 mil
lion shares, down from 102.91 million Tuesday.

Reagan hints of Jan. 1 tax cut

Washington President Reagan said yesterday that he may ask Congress
to move up a scheduled 10 percent tax cut from next July 1 to Jan. 1 to pro
vide an "appealing" stimulant for the sagging economy.
The change, which would add $ 14 billion to consumer buying power in the
first half of 1983, was proposed by Treasury Secretary Donald Regan to spur
economic recovery.
The president, who spoke with reporters on a Florida trip before returning
to the White House, said that no decision has been made, but "we are talking
about it."
The possibility of a speedup in the tax cut was raised as the Commerce
Department reported a sharp increase in October in the number of permits
for future home construction an encouraging development that was
hailed by the housing industry.
Permits were issued in October at an annual rate of 1.18 million housing
units, up 17.7 percent from September and 60 percent above the figure for
October of last year.
Work began on new houses at an annual rate of 1.12 million last month,
up 1 percent from September, the department said.
On a grimmer note, the Federal Reserve Board reported that nearly one
third of U.S: factory capacity remained idle last month. The 68.4 percent use
of manufacturing capacity was the worst on record since figures were col
lected starting in 1948 and dipped below the 69.0 percent recorded in the
1975 recession.
Some of the president's top advisers, including chief White House econo
mist Martin Feldstein and Budget Director David Stockman, reportedly op
pose moving up the effective date of the tax reduction.
Opponents of a tax cut speed-up noted that it would increase a budget def
icit already estimated at at least $ 175 billion and give only a mild boost to the
economy even if consumers decide to spend the money rather than save it.
While a speed-up would put more money in consumers' hands, Feldstein
said it would not provide an equivalent increase in economic growth'. As a
result, he said, it would significantly add to the "crowding out" of private
borrowers by the need to finance the public debt and thus reduce investment
and worsen the balance of trade.
If Reagan made the request and Congress failed to approve it promptly, he
said, it would lose its impact as a shot in the arm for the economy in the

Fahringer, Wilson's attorney, had vowed last July that he
would introduce "classified information" that would "shake the
CIA to its foundations." He said that Wilson was gathering in
telligence for the CIA while living in Libya, particularly data on
sophisticated electronic Soviet equipment that Libya had
purchased.
But after hearing arguments in closed session and examining
secret documents, U.S. District Judge Oren Lewis ruled on Oct.
29 that no classified material was relevant to Wilson's defense.
Pentagon plans polygraph use
Washington — The Pentagon has drafted a directive author
izing a vast expansion of the use of lie detector tests for govern
ment employees.
Polygraph examinations could be used for everything from
screening job applicants to tracking down leaks to the press un
der the draft directive obtained by The Washington Post and con
firmed by the Pentagon yesterday as being under review.
A top Defense Department official acknowledged that lie de
tector tests could be used more widely if the draft is adopted than
under a 1975 directive now in force, but he stressed that govern
ment employees still would have the right to refuse to take them.
Hundreds of Pentagon employees in particularly sensitive
jobs, however, are being asked to sign forms waiving their right
to refuse to take lie detector tests, said the official, who asked not
to be identified.
The 1975 directive emphasizes that the polygraph should be
used sparingly, ordering Pentagon executives to "preclude its use
in cases other than serious criminal cases, national security in
vestigations and highly sensitive national security access
cases. .. ."
Pentagon officials described the draft directive as "an update"
which would provide "additional insurance" against serious se
curity breaches. Critics, including some active duty military of
ficers and Pentagon civilians, contended that the Reagan admin
istration was trying to intimidate Pentagon employees.
Factory use hits new low
Washington — About one-third of the production lines at U.S.
factories stood idle last month as the recession deepened, in what
one economist called a "near depression." The 68.4 percent fac
tory-use rate reported yesterday was the worst on record.
For the present, however, the Federal Reserve Board's fac
tory-use report was nothing but bad news. For example:
•The decline was the 13th in 15 months. And rather than get
ting smaller, the monthly drops have been getting larger: 0.2 per
centage point in August, 0.6 point in September and now 0.8
point in October.
•There were new declines in two major industries: Factory use
fell to 49.7 percent for automakers and to 42 percent for iron and
steel producers. The latter figure was that industry's lowest since
a big 1959 strike stifled output.
•For the first time in the recession, overall factory use fell
below the 1975 low of 69 percent, a figure that had been the low
est level in statistics going back to 1948.
Allen Sinai, a vice president with Data Resources Inc., said the
new operating rate "is further evidence that the U.S. economy
has suffered a near depression over the past few years" as a result
of efforts to bring down the high inflation rates of the 1970s.
Freed American mercenaries return home
Paris — Three homeward-bound Americans arrived on a
night flight from Africa yesterday after Angola released the two ,
mercenaries and pilot from prison in exchange for three Soviet

soldiers and 94 Angolan fighters.
Bypassing customs, the trio was whisked away by U.S. Em
bassy personnel after landing at 6:10 a.m. (9:10 p ; m. Tuesday
PST) aboard a commercial flight from Zambia. They were the
first to disembark from the French UTA airliner.
The men were due to arrive at Kennedy Airport in New York
at 11:05 a.m. PST aboard a TWA flight from Paris.
Mercenaries Gary Acker, 28, of Sacramento, Calif., and Ar
gentine-born Gustavo Grillo, 36, of Jersey City, N.J., had been
imprisoned since their capture in the 1975-76 Angolan civil war.
Geoffrey Tyler, 32, of Lakeland, Fla., was arrested in 1981 af
ter a forced landing in a light plane he was delivering to a cus
tomer.
Angola's Marxist government freed them under a complex
prisoner exchange hammered out in negotiations involving five
countries.
One U.S. official said Washington is hopeful that the suc
cessful swap will help negotiations over independence for South
west Africa since many of the same parties are directly involved.
In Washington, State Department officials speaking privately
said the exchange was the result of complex negotiations that
began in August 1981 and involved the governments of the Unit
ed States, Soviet Union, Angola, South Africa and Zambia.
Anti-government Angolan guerrilla leader Jonas Savimbi also
was involved, as were the South African and international com
mittees of the Red Cross.
"We're very, very pleased about this," one U.S. official said.
"We've worked on it for more than a year."
Significant Soviet signal expected
Washington The Kremlin leadership could send the United
States "a very quick and simple" signal that it seeks better rela
tions by moving toward President Reagan's nuclear arms reduc
tion proposals, a senior defense official said yesterday.
"Movement on the president's proposals would be a clear and
as unmistakeable a signal as we could get," said the official, who
spoke with newsmen under ground rules protecting his anonymi
ty.
At the same time, the official indicated that hope for any early
changes in U.S.-Soviet relations, with the rise of Soviet leader
Yuri Andropov, is tempered by a general belief that Andropov
will probably move slowly in deviating from the late Leonid
Brezhnev's policies.
"It's a general conclusion that any new leader in the Soviet
Union is going to take some time before he makes any major
changes in policy," said the official.
"I don't think that there is any basis for any firm prediction as
to what may happen. . . .It's a closed society."
He discounted the significance of a reportedly warm talk in
Moscow between Andropov and Vice President George Bush,
who headed the U.S. delegation to the Brezhnev funeral Mon
day.
"I don't think that anybody feels there was anything very ma
jor" growing out of the Andropov-Bush talk, the senior defense
official said.
Defense analysts, both military and civilian, said last week
that Andropov is likely to preside over a committee type of lead
ership an approach that makes any sharp changes in policy
direction unlikely, at least for a couple of years.
Asked what other actions the Soviets could take to indicate
they want better relations with the United States, the senior of
ficial said the Kremlin could pull troops out of Afghanistan and
apply "less pressure on Poland."
On the subject of Soviet-Chinese relations, the official said he
doubts that recent diplomatic talks between the two Communist
led countries foreshadow a healing of their 20-year feud.
The United States would be deeply concerned if there were was
a re-establishment of a Soviet-Chinese coalition, the official said,
"but I don't think anything of that kind is portended."
Vesuvius dig yields valuable finds
Washington The discovery of more than 80 well-preserved
skeletons in an ancient Italian town buried by the eruption of
Mount Vesuvius provides a treasure trove of information on
how Romans lived 1900 years ago, scientists said Tuesday.
Most of the people of Herculaneum were believed to have es
caped the A.D. 79 volcanic eruption which buried neighboring
Pompeii and several other towns.
But discovery of so many bodies indicates the people of
Herculaneum were not spared in an eruption estimated to have
been 10 times more powerful than the 1980 Mount St. Helens ex
plosion.
At a briefing sponsored by the National Geographic Society,
scientists said they suspect that hundreds of skeletons might lie
beneath the volcanic debris.
The discovery is significant because few other complete
skeletons of ancient Romans survive and none are in this good a
state of preservation, they said. The society is sponsoring efforts
to preserve the skeletons, which are in danger of decay from ex
posure.
"It is really a very major find," said Dr. Sara Bisel, an
archeologist hired to preserve and analyze the bones. "This is the
first Roman population that we've ever had a chance to study."

Reagan, bishops clash over nuclear arms
Washington The Reagan administration told the nation's
Roman Catholic bishops yesterday that the bishops' projected
call for a nuclear freeze is based on "fundamental misreadings of
American policies" and ignores U.S. negotiations with the Sovi
et Union to achieve reductions in nuclear arsenals.
National Security adviser William Clark sent a seven-page let
ter to the National Conference of Catholic Bishops, laying out
the administrations position on the nuclear freeze movement.
The conference is holding its annual meeting here this week.
Clark, representing President Reagan, Secretary of Defense
Caspar Weinberger and Secretary of State George Shultz, told
Chicago Archbishop Joseph Bemardin, head of the committee
that drafted the letter that U.S. defense policy is "guided by mor
al considerations as compelling as any which have faced man
kind."
"The strategy of deterrence on which our policies are based is
not an end in itself," Clark wrote, "but a means to prevent war
and preserve the values we cherish individual liberty, freedom
of worship, freedom of conscience and expression, respect for the
sanctity of human life, and the rule of law through representative
institutions."
Army leads in Brazilian vote
Rio de Janeiro The Brazilian military's hold on power ap
peared unchallenged in the early counting of Monday's na
tionwide elections, but opposition parties were leading in several
major population areas.
Last night, more than 48 hours after the polls closed, only
about 10 percent of the estimated 55 million votes had been
counted as election workers struggled to tabulate the hand-writ
ten ballots.
The government's official Social Democratic Party was ahead
in 13 of 22 gubernatorial races while the main opposition group,
the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party, was leading in Seven
others. In other states the figures were too close or insignificant
to forecast an outcome.
Market gain reverses recent slide
New York The stock market chalked up a broad gain yester
day, reversing the slide of the past three sessions.
Financial services, bank and retailing stocks were among the

The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which had fallen
46.73 points in the last three trading days, climbed 19.50 to
1,027.50.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange totaled 84.44 mil
lion shares, down from 102.91 million Tuesday.

Reagan hints of Jan. 1 tax cut

Washington President Reagan said yesterday that he may ask Congress
to move up a scheduled 10 percent tax cut from next July 1 to Jan. 1 to pro
vide an "appealing" stimulant for the sagging economy.
The change, which would add $ 14 billion to consumer buying power in the
first half of 1983, was proposed by Treasury Secretary Donald Regan to spur
economic recovery.
The president, who spoke with reporters on a Florida trip before returning
to the White House, said that no decision has been made, but "we are talking
about it."
The possibility of a speedup in the tax cut was raised as the Commerce
Department reported a sharp increase in October in the number of permits
for future home construction an encouraging development that was
hailed by the housing industry.
Permits were issued in October at an annual rate of 1.18 million housing
units, up 17.7 percent from September and 60 percent above the figure for
October of last year.
Work began on new houses at an annual rate of 1.12 million last month,
up 1 percent from September, the department said.
On a grimmer note, the Federal Reserve Board reported that nearly one
third of U.S: factory capacity remained idle last month. The 68.4 percent use
of manufacturing capacity was the worst on record since figures were col
lected starting in 1948 and dipped below the 69.0 percent recorded in the
1975 recession.
Some of the president's top advisers, including chief White House econo
mist Martin Feldstein and Budget Director David Stockman, reportedly op
pose moving up the effective date of the tax reduction.
Opponents of a tax cut speed-up noted that it would increase a budget def
icit already estimated at at least $ 175 billion and give only a mild boost to the
economy even if consumers decide to spend the money rather than save it.
While a speed-up would put more money in consumers' hands, Feldstein
said it would not provide an equivalent increase in economic growth'. As a
result, he said, it would significantly add to the "crowding out" of private
borrowers by the need to finance the public debt and thus reduce investment
and worsen the balance of trade.
If Reagan made the request and Congress failed to approve it promptly, he
said, it would lose its impact as a shot in the arm for the economy in the
opening weeks of 1983.
Some Democrats in Congress have discussed proposals to repeal, delay or
modify the projected 1983 tax cut.

Ex-CIA agent found guilty

Alexandria, Va. Edwin Wilson, the former Central Intelligence Agency
undercover agent who was a fugitive in Tripoli for two years, was convicted
yesterday of illegally aiding the Libyan regime by exporting weapons from
the United States in 1979.
In the first of the four federal trials that Wilson, 54, is scheduled to face, a
jury deliberated four hours before convicting the millionaire entrepreneur
on seven counts of conspiracy and firearms violations.
Wilson, who received the verdict impassively with his hands
clasped behind him, was acquitted on an eighth charge of ship
ping handguns in interstate commerce without a dealer's license.
U.S. District Judge Richard Williams set Dec. 17 for sentenc
ing. Wilson, who will remain in custody on $20 million bond,
faces a maximum sentence of 39 years in prison and $240,000 in
fines.
Wilson's attorney, Herald Price Fahringer, said that he would
appeal the conviction. Fahringer told reporters that judicial rul
ings had severely restricted his planned defense that Wilsonfelt
he was still helping his government.
Chief prosecutor Theodore Greenberg told jurors that the
weapons charges had a larger significance. By illegally shipping
four handguns and an Army rifle to Libyan officials, Wilson had
demonstrated his ability to supply military goods to them and
that led to his signing a $22 million contract with Libya,
Greenberg said.
Evidence during the two-day trial showed that Wilson had
directed associates to buy four used pistols and an M-16 auto
matic rifle in North Carolina and Washington, D.C., for delivery
to Libyan intelligence officials in Bonn, West Germany.
The weapons were shipped to Europe in violation of U.S. ex
port laws.
Wilson had worked for the CIA for 15 years and for a secret
naval intelligence unit for six years before becoming a busi
nessman.
Fahringer, Wilson's attorney, had vowed last July that he
would introduce "classified information" that would "shake the
CIA to its foundations." He said that Wilson was gathering in

ting smaller, the monthly drops have been getting larger: 0.2 per
centage point in August, 0.6 point in September and now 0.8
point in October.
•There were new declines in two major industries: Factory use
fell to 49.7 percent for automakers and to 42 percent for iron and
steel producers. The latter figure was that industry's lowest since
a big 1959 strike stifled output.
•For the first time in the recession, overall factory use fell
below the 1975 low of 69 percent, a figure that had been the low
est level in statistics going back to 1948.
Allen Sinai, a vice president with Data Resources Inc., said the
new operating rate "is further evidence that the U.S. economy
has suffered a near depression over the past few years" as a result
of efforts to bring down the high inflation rates of the 1970s.
Freed American mercenaries return home
Paris — Three homeward-bound Americans arrived on a
night flight from Africa yesterday after Angola released the two ,
mercenaries and pilot from prison in exchange for three Soviet

soldiers and 94 Angolan fighters.
Bypassing customs, the trio was whisked away by U.S. Em
bassy personnel after landing at 6:10 a.m. (9:10 p ; m. Tuesday
PST) aboard a commercial flight from Zambia. They were the
first to disembark from the French UTA airliner.
The men were due to arrive at Kennedy Airport in New York
at 11:05 a.m. PST aboard a TWA flight from Paris.
Mercenaries Gary Acker, 28, of Sacramento, Calif., and Ar
gentine-born Gustavo Grillo, 36, of Jersey City, N.J., had been
imprisoned since their capture in the 1975-76 Angolan civil war.
Geoffrey Tyler, 32, of Lakeland, Fla., was arrested in 1981 af
ter a forced landing in a light plane he was delivering to a cus
tomer.
Angola's Marxist government freed them under a complex
prisoner exchange hammered out in negotiations involving five
countries.
One U.S. official said Washington is hopeful that the suc
cessful swap will help negotiations over independence for South
west Africa since many of the same parties are directly involved.
In Washington, State Department officials speaking privately
said the exchange was the result of complex negotiations that
began in August 1981 and involved the governments of the Unit
ed States, Soviet Union, Angola, South Africa and Zambia.
Anti-government Angolan guerrilla leader Jonas Savimbi also
was involved, as were the South African and international com
mittees of the Red Cross.
"We're very, very pleased about this," one U.S. official said.
"We've worked on it for more than a year."
Significant Soviet signal expected
Washington The Kremlin leadership could send the United
States "a very quick and simple" signal that it seeks better rela
tions by moving toward President Reagan's nuclear arms reduc
tion proposals, a senior defense official said yesterday.
"Movement on the president's proposals would be a clear and
as unmistakeable a signal as we could get," said the official, who
spoke with newsmen under ground rules protecting his anonymi
ty.
At the same time, the official indicated that hope for any early
changes in U.S.-Soviet relations, with the rise of Soviet leader
Yuri Andropov, is tempered by a general belief that Andropov
will probably move slowly in deviating from the late Leonid
Brezhnev's policies.
"It's a general conclusion that any new leader in the Soviet
Union is going to take some time before he makes any major
changes in policy," said the official.
"I don't think that there is any basis for any firm prediction as
to what may happen. . . .It's a closed society."
He discounted the significance of a reportedly warm talk in
Moscow between Andropov and Vice President George Bush,
who headed the U.S. delegation to the Brezhnev funeral Mon
day.
"I don't think that anybody feels there was anything very ma
jor" growing out of the Andropov-Bush talk, the senior defense
official said.
Defense analysts, both military and civilian, said last week
that Andropov is likely to preside over a committee type of lead
ership an approach that makes any sharp changes in policy
direction unlikely, at least for a couple of years.
Asked what other actions the Soviets could take to indicate
they want better relations with the United States, the senior of
ficial said the Kremlin could pull troops out of Afghanistan and
apply "less pressure on Poland."
On the subject of Soviet-Chinese relations, the official said he
doubts that recent diplomatic talks between the two Communist
led countries foreshadow a healing of their 20-year feud.
The United States would be deeply concerned if there were was
a re-establishment of a Soviet-Chinese coalition, the official said,
"but I don't think anything of that kind is portended."
Vesuvius dig yields valuable finds
Washington The discovery of more than 80 well-preserved
skeletons in an ancient Italian town buried by the eruption of
Mount Vesuvius provides a treasure trove of information on
how Romans lived 1900 years ago, scientists said Tuesday.
Most of the people of Herculaneum were believed to have es
caped the A.D. 79 volcanic eruption which buried neighboring
Pompeii and several other towns.
But discovery of so many bodies indicates the people of
Herculaneum were not spared in an eruption estimated to have
been 10 times more powerful than the 1980 Mount St. Helens ex
plosion.
At a briefing sponsored by the National Geographic Society,
scientists said they suspect that hundreds of skeletons might lie
beneath the volcanic debris.
The discovery is significant because few other complete
skeletons of ancient Romans survive and none are in this good a
state of preservation, they said. The society is sponsoring efforts
to preserve the skeletons, which are in danger of decay from ex
posure.
"It is really a very major find," said Dr. Sara Bisel, an
archeologist hired to preserve and analyze the bones. "This is the
first Roman population that we've ever had a chance to study."

Reagan, bishops clash over nuclear arms
Washington The Reagan administration told the nation's
Roman Catholic bishops yesterday that the bishops' projected
call for a nuclear freeze is based on "fundamental misreadings of
American policies" and ignores U.S. negotiations with the Sovi
et Union to achieve reductions in nuclear arsenals.
National Security adviser William Clark sent a seven-page let
ter to the National Conference of Catholic Bishops, laying out
the administrations position on the nuclear freeze movement.
The conference is holding its annual meeting here this week.
Clark, representing President Reagan, Secretary of Defense
Caspar Weinberger and Secretary of State George Shultz, told
Chicago Archbishop Joseph Bemardin, head of the committee
that drafted the letter that U.S. defense policy is "guided by mor
al considerations as compelling as any which have faced man
kind."
"The strategy of deterrence on which our policies are based is
not an end in itself," Clark wrote, "but a means to prevent war
and preserve the values we cherish individual liberty, freedom
of worship, freedom of conscience and expression, respect for the
sanctity of human life, and the rule of law through representative
institutions."
Army leads in Brazilian vote
Rio de Janeiro The Brazilian military's hold on power ap
peared unchallenged in the early counting of Monday's na
tionwide elections, but opposition parties were leading in several
major population areas.
Last night, more than 48 hours after the polls closed, only
about 10 percent of the estimated 55 million votes had been
counted as election workers struggled to tabulate the hand-writ
ten ballots.
The government's official Social Democratic Party was ahead
in 13 of 22 gubernatorial races while the main opposition group,
the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party, was leading in Seven
others. In other states the figures were too close or insignificant
to forecast an outcome.
Market gain reverses recent slide
New York The stock market chalked up a broad gain yester
day, reversing the slide of the past three sessions.
Financial services, bank and retailing stocks were among the

46.73 points in the last three trading days, climbed 19.50 to
1,027.50.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange totaled 84.44 mil

Reagan hints of Jan. 1 tax cut

Washington President Reagan said yesterday that he may ask Congress
to move up a scheduled 10 percent tax cut from next July 1 to Jan. 1 to pro
vide an "appealing" stimulant for the sagging economy.
The change, which would add $ 14 billion to consumer buying power in the
first half of 1983, was proposed by Treasury Secretary Donald Regan to spur
economic recovery.
The president, who spoke with reporters on a Florida trip before returning
to the White House, said that no decision has been made, but "we are talking
about it."
The possibility of a speedup in the tax cut was raised as the Commerce
Department reported a sharp increase in October in the number of permits
for future home construction an encouraging development that was
hailed by the housing industry.
Permits were issued in October at an annual rate of 1.18 million housing
units, up 17.7 percent from September and 60 percent above the figure for
October of last year.
Work began on new houses at an annual rate of 1.12 million last month,
up 1 percent from September, the department said.
On a grimmer note, the Federal Reserve Board reported that nearly one
third of U.S: factory capacity remained idle last month. The 68.4 percent use
of manufacturing capacity was the worst on record since figures were col
lected starting in 1948 and dipped below the 69.0 percent recorded in the
1975 recession.
Some of the president's top advisers, including chief White House econo
mist Martin Feldstein and Budget Director David Stockman, reportedly op
pose moving up the effective date of the tax reduction.
Opponents of a tax cut speed-up noted that it would increase a budget def
icit already estimated at at least $ 175 billion and give only a mild boost to the
economy even if consumers decide to spend the money rather than save it.
While a speed-up would put more money in consumers' hands, Feldstein
said it would not provide an equivalent increase in economic growth'. As a
result, he said, it would significantly add to the "crowding out" of private
borrowers by the need to finance the public debt and thus reduce investment
and worsen the balance of trade.
If Reagan made the request and Congress failed to approve it promptly, he
said, it would lose its impact as a shot in the arm for the economy in the
opening weeks of 1983.
Some Democrats in Congress have discussed proposals to repeal, delay or
modify the projected 1983 tax cut.

Ex-CIA agent found guilty

Alexandria, Va. Edwin Wilson, the former Central Intelligence Agency
undercover agent who was a fugitive in Tripoli for two years, was convicted
yesterday of illegally aiding the Libyan regime by exporting weapons from
the United States in 1979.
In the first of the four federal trials that Wilson, 54, is scheduled to face, a
jury deliberated four hours before convicting the millionaire entrepreneur
on seven counts of conspiracy and firearms violations.
Wilson, who received the verdict impassively with his hands
clasped behind him, was acquitted on an eighth charge of ship
ping handguns in interstate commerce without a dealer's license.
U.S. District Judge Richard Williams set Dec. 17 for sentenc
ing. Wilson, who will remain in custody on $20 million bond,
faces a maximum sentence of 39 years in prison and $240,000 in
fines.
Wilson's attorney, Herald Price Fahringer, said that he would
appeal the conviction. Fahringer told reporters that judicial rul
ings had severely restricted his planned defense that Wilsonfelt
he was still helping his government.
Chief prosecutor Theodore Greenberg told jurors that the
weapons charges had a larger significance. By illegally shipping
four handguns and an Army rifle to Libyan officials, Wilson had
demonstrated his ability to supply military goods to them and
that led to his signing a $22 million contract with Libya,
Greenberg said.
Evidence during the two-day trial showed that Wilson had
directed associates to buy four used pistols and an M-16 auto
matic rifle in North Carolina and Washington, D.C., for delivery
to Libyan intelligence officials in Bonn, West Germany.
The weapons were shipped to Europe in violation of U.S. ex
port laws.
Wilson had worked for the CIA for 15 years and for a secret
naval intelligence unit for six years before becoming a busi
nessman.
Fahringer, Wilson's attorney, had vowed last July that he
would introduce "classified information" that would "shake the
CIA to its foundations." He said that Wilson was gathering in
telligence for the CIA while living in Libya, particularly data on
sophisticated electronic Soviet equipment that Libya had
purchased.
But after hearing arguments in closed session and examining
secret documents, U.S. District Judge Oren Lewis ruled on Oct.
29 that no classified material was relevant to Wilson's defense.
Pentagon plans polygraph use
Washington — The Pentagon has drafted a directive author
izing a vast expansion of the use of lie detector tests for govern
ment employees.
Polygraph examinations could be used for everything from
screening job applicants to tracking down leaks to the press un
der the draft directive obtained by The Washington Post and con
firmed by the Pentagon yesterday as being under review.
A top Defense Department official acknowledged that lie de
tector tests could be used more widely if the draft is adopted than
under a 1975 directive now in force, but he stressed that govern
ment employees still would have the right to refuse to take them.
Hundreds of Pentagon employees in particularly sensitive
jobs, however, are being asked to sign forms waiving their right
to refuse to take lie detector tests, said the official, who asked not
to be identified.
The 1975 directive emphasizes that the polygraph should be
used sparingly, ordering Pentagon executives to "preclude its use
in cases other than serious criminal cases, national security in
vestigations and highly sensitive national security access
cases. .. ."
Pentagon officials described the draft directive as "an update"
which would provide "additional insurance" against serious se
curity breaches. Critics, including some active duty military of
ficers and Pentagon civilians, contended that the Reagan admin
istration was trying to intimidate Pentagon employees.
Factory use hits new low
Washington — About one-third of the production lines at U.S.
factories stood idle last month as the recession deepened, in what
one economist called a "near depression." The 68.4 percent fac
tory-use rate reported yesterday was the worst on record.
For the present, however, the Federal Reserve Board's fac
tory-use report was nothing but bad news. For example:

cessful swap will help negotiations over independence for South
west Africa since many of the same parties are directly involved.
In Washington, State Department officials speaking privately
said the exchange was the result of complex negotiations that
began in August 1981 and involved the governments of the Unit
ed States, Soviet Union, Angola, South Africa and Zambia.
Anti-government Angolan guerrilla leader Jonas Savimbi also
was involved, as were the South African and international com
mittees of the Red Cross.
"We're very, very pleased about this," one U.S. official said.
"We've worked on it for more than a year."
Significant Soviet signal expected
Washington The Kremlin leadership could send the United
States "a very quick and simple" signal that it seeks better rela
tions by moving toward President Reagan's nuclear arms reduc
tion proposals, a senior defense official said yesterday.
"Movement on the president's proposals would be a clear and
as unmistakeable a signal as we could get," said the official, who
spoke with newsmen under ground rules protecting his anonymi
ty.
At the same time, the official indicated that hope for any early
changes in U.S.-Soviet relations, with the rise of Soviet leader
Yuri Andropov, is tempered by a general belief that Andropov
will probably move slowly in deviating from the late Leonid
Brezhnev's policies.
"It's a general conclusion that any new leader in the Soviet
Union is going to take some time before he makes any major
changes in policy," said the official.
"I don't think that there is any basis for any firm prediction as
to what may happen. . . .It's a closed society."
He discounted the significance of a reportedly warm talk in
Moscow between Andropov and Vice President George Bush,
who headed the U.S. delegation to the Brezhnev funeral Mon
day.
"I don't think that anybody feels there was anything very ma
jor" growing out of the Andropov-Bush talk, the senior defense
official said.
Defense analysts, both military and civilian, said last week
that Andropov is likely to preside over a committee type of lead
ership an approach that makes any sharp changes in policy
direction unlikely, at least for a couple of years.
Asked what other actions the Soviets could take to indicate
they want better relations with the United States, the senior of
ficial said the Kremlin could pull troops out of Afghanistan and
apply "less pressure on Poland."
On the subject of Soviet-Chinese relations, the official said he
doubts that recent diplomatic talks between the two Communist
led countries foreshadow a healing of their 20-year feud.
The United States would be deeply concerned if there were was
a re-establishment of a Soviet-Chinese coalition, the official said,
"but I don't think anything of that kind is portended."
Vesuvius dig yields valuable finds
Washington The discovery of more than 80 well-preserved
skeletons in an ancient Italian town buried by the eruption of
Mount Vesuvius provides a treasure trove of information on
how Romans lived 1900 years ago, scientists said Tuesday.
Most of the people of Herculaneum were believed to have es
caped the A.D. 79 volcanic eruption which buried neighboring
Pompeii and several other towns.
But discovery of so many bodies indicates the people of
Herculaneum were not spared in an eruption estimated to have
been 10 times more powerful than the 1980 Mount St. Helens ex
plosion.
At a briefing sponsored by the National Geographic Society,
scientists said they suspect that hundreds of skeletons might lie
beneath the volcanic debris.
The discovery is significant because few other complete
skeletons of ancient Romans survive and none are in this good a
state of preservation, they said. The society is sponsoring efforts
to preserve the skeletons, which are in danger of decay from ex
posure.
"It is really a very major find," said Dr. Sara Bisel, an
archeologist hired to preserve and analyze the bones. "This is the
first Roman population that we've ever had a chance to study."

Reagan, bishops clash over nuclear arms
Washington The Reagan administration told the nation's
Roman Catholic bishops yesterday that the bishops' projected
call for a nuclear freeze is based on "fundamental misreadings of
American policies" and ignores U.S. negotiations with the Sovi
et Union to achieve reductions in nuclear arsenals.
National Security adviser William Clark sent a seven-page let
ter to the National Conference of Catholic Bishops, laying out
the administrations position on the nuclear freeze movement.
The conference is holding its annual meeting here this week.
Clark, representing President Reagan, Secretary of Defense
Caspar Weinberger and Secretary of State George Shultz, told
Chicago Archbishop Joseph Bemardin, head of the committee
that drafted the letter that U.S. defense policy is "guided by mor
al considerations as compelling as any which have faced man
kind."
"The strategy of deterrence on which our policies are based is
not an end in itself," Clark wrote, "but a means to prevent war
and preserve the values we cherish individual liberty, freedom
of worship, freedom of conscience and expression, respect for the
sanctity of human life, and the rule of law through representative
institutions."
Army leads in Brazilian vote
Rio de Janeiro The Brazilian military's hold on power ap
peared unchallenged in the early counting of Monday's na
tionwide elections, but opposition parties were leading in several
major population areas.
Last night, more than 48 hours after the polls closed, only
about 10 percent of the estimated 55 million votes had been
counted as election workers struggled to tabulate the hand-writ
ten ballots.
The government's official Social Democratic Party was ahead
in 13 of 22 gubernatorial races while the main opposition group,
the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party, was leading in Seven
others. In other states the figures were too close or insignificant
to forecast an outcome.
