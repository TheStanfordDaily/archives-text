Reagan hints of Jan. 1 tax cut

Washington President Reagan said yesterday that he may ask Congress
to move up a scheduled 10 percent tax cut from next July 1 to Jan. 1 to pro
vide an "appealing" stimulant for the sagging economy.
The change, which would add $ 14 billion to consumer buying power in the
first half of 1983, was proposed by Treasury Secretary Donald Regan to spur
economic recovery.
The president, who spoke with reporters on a Florida trip before returning
to the White House, said that no decision has been made, but "we are talking
about it."
The possibility of a speedup in the tax cut was raised as the Commerce
Department reported a sharp increase in October in the number of permits
for future home construction an encouraging development that was
hailed by the housing industry.
Permits were issued in October at an annual rate of 1.18 million housing
units, up 17.7 percent from September and 60 percent above the figure for
October of last year.
Work began on new houses at an annual rate of 1.12 million last month,
up 1 percent from September, the department said.
On a grimmer note, the Federal Reserve Board reported that nearly one
third of U.S: factory capacity remained idle last month. The 68.4 percent use
of manufacturing capacity was the worst on record since figures were col
lected starting in 1948 and dipped below the 69.0 percent recorded in the
1975 recession.
Some of the president's top advisers, including chief White House econo
mist Martin Feldstein and Budget Director David Stockman, reportedly op
pose moving up the effective date of the tax reduction.
Opponents of a tax cut speed-up noted that it would increase a budget def
icit already estimated at at least $ 175 billion and give only a mild boost to the
economy even if consumers decide to spend the money rather than save it.
While a speed-up would put more money in consumers' hands, Feldstein
said it would not provide an equivalent increase in economic growth'. As a
result, he said, it would significantly add to the "crowding out" of private
borrowers by the need to finance the public debt and thus reduce investment
and worsen the balance of trade.
If Reagan made the request and Congress failed to approve it promptly, he
said, it would lose its impact as a shot in the arm for the economy in the
opening weeks of 1983.
Some Democrats in Congress have discussed proposals to repeal, delay or
modify the projected 1983 tax cut.

Ex-CIA agent found guilty

Alexandria, Va. Edwin Wilson, the former Central Intelligence Agency
undercover agent who was a fugitive in Tripoli for two years, was convicted
yesterday of illegally aiding the Libyan regime by exporting weapons from
the United States in 1979.
In the first of the four federal trials that Wilson, 54, is scheduled to face, a
jury deliberated four hours before convicting the millionaire entrepreneur
on seven counts of conspiracy and firearms violations.
