# Stanford West design subject of criticism
## 
### MIKE HALE Senior staff writer 
At the latest in a series of public dis
cussions of the proposed housing de
velopment Stanford West last night,
Menlo Park residents raised the issue of
size, Palo Alto planning commissioners
objected to the lay out of the project.
The Palo Alto Planning Commission
meeting consisted of a public hearing
followed by commission discussion of
specific site plans the University has
proposed. The next meeting, to be held
Dec. 8, will focus on the project's im
pact on Willow Road.
Nearby residents' complaints cen
tered on the project's size, and the ad
verse impact they felt this dense a de
velopment would have on their neigh
borhoods.
Kay Paar, a Menlo Park resident and
member of the City Council there, com
plained that "the project hasn't
changed significantly since the first
hearing," and said the "complaints are
all the same now as they were then."
She called the proposed housing den
sity of 28 units per acre west of Willow
Road the main complaint, and asked,
"Why on this site, which is so heavily
impacted?" She said that if the Univer
sity had no other site on which to build
a project of comparable size and densi
ty, the number of units should be sub
stantially reduced.
She likened the proposed housing to
dormitory housing, and said there was
"an incredible mix-up in the way Stan
ford is doing the planning."
Another Menlo Park resident com
pared the proposed buildings to "public
housing highrises in New York City,"
and said the project's density should be
reduced. He also referred to the
project's potential impact on Willow
Road, saying that proposed widening
did not address the primary issue of
bottlenecks at either end of the road.
Dale Draper of Menlo Park summed
up the residents' complaints by saying
"the project seems much too dense,"
and claimed most complaints could be
mitigated by reducing the number of
units.
Planning Commission members,
while expressing a number of reserva
tions about the project's design, seemed
satisified that the project as proposed is
not necessarily too large. Com
missioners' comments centered on the
development's appearance and the liv
ing conditions within the development.
Two primary site plans (Plans "A"
and "B") have been developed by
Sandy & Babcock, the Stanford West

architects; each plan would provide
1469 total units of housing. The46-acre
parcel north of Willow Road would
hold 1275 units (28 per acre), while a 4.3
acre site across Willow Road would
hold 194 units (45 per acre). The ap
proximately 50 acres involved represent
89 percent of the open land left in Palo
Alto that is zoned for high-density resi
dent..l! development.
While the Commission members
were unanimous in their preference for
Site Plan B, they nearly all agreed that
there is not that much difference be
tween the plans. Commissioner Helene
Wheeler said, "I prefer neither," and
Commission Chair Jean McCown said
the two plans were "not significantly
different."
Commissioner Fred Nichols said he
preferred Plan B because it provides a
larger "swath of open space" through
the middle of the development. He later
added that while there are features of
Plan B he would want incorporated in
any final design, he was not endorsing
the plan.
Criticisms of the project design cen
tered on the size and orientation of the
12 to 15 five-story, L-shaped buildings
that would dominate the northern sec
tion of the development, and what
McCown called a "lack of diversity" in
building types.
McCown said the buildings in the
larger northern section consisted of "a
set of types repeated over and over
again," and that the project as designed
would have a "sterile atmosphere."
Several commissioners said they feared
the development would have a "cor
ridor effect" because of the massiveness
of the 5-story buildings (they are de
signed to be 300 ft. long on side of the L,
200 feet on the other) and their orien
tation parallel to Willow Road.
Commissioner Ellen Christensen
said that in either plan, Stanford West
was "not a place for people to live." She
called for a design that would, at the
same density, provide "a sense of place
. . . the creation of a community."
Several commissioners asked that
methods be explored for increasing the
project's usable open space without de
creasing affordability.
Another widely held concern was ac
cess from the project to the central cam
pus. Commissioners suggested various
ways of providing a separate crossing
over Willow Road for bicyclists and pe
destrians at the development's en
trance.

Several commissioners said they feared
the development would have a "cor
ridor effect" because of the massiveness
of the 5-story buildings (they are de
signed to be 300 ft. long on side of the L,
200 feet on the other) and their orien
tation parallel to Willow Road.
Commissioner Ellen Christensen
said that in either plan, Stanford West
was "not a place for people to live." She
called for a design that would, at the
same density, provide "a sense of place
. . . the creation of a community."
Several commissioners asked that
methods be explored for increasing the
project's usable open space without de
creasing affordability.
Another widely held concern was ac
cess from the project to the central cam
pus. Commissioners suggested various
ways of providing a separate crossing
over Willow Road for bicyclists and pe
destrians at the development's en
trance.
At the latest in a series of public dis
cussions of the proposed housing de
velopment Stanford West last night,
Menlo Park residents raised the issue of
size, Palo Alto planning commissioners
objected to the lay out of the project.
The Palo Alto Planning Commission
meeting consisted of a public hearing
followed by commission discussion of
specific site plans the University has
proposed. The next meeting, to be held
Dec. 8, will focus on the project's im
pact on Willow Road.
Nearby residents' complaints cen
tered on the project's size, and the ad
verse impact they felt this dense a de
velopment would have on their neigh
borhoods.
Kay Paar, a Menlo Park resident and
member of the City Council there, com
plained that "the project hasn't
changed significantly since the first
hearing," and said the "complaints are
all the same now as they were then."
She called the proposed housing den
sity of 28 units per acre west of Willow
Road the main complaint, and asked,
"Why on this site, which is so heavily
impacted?" She said that if the Univer
sity had no other site on which to build
a project of comparable size and densi
ty, the number of units should be sub
stantially reduced.
She likened the proposed housing to
dormitory housing, and said there was
"an incredible mix-up in the way Stan
ford is doing the planning."
Another Menlo Park resident com
pared the proposed buildings to "public
housing highrises in New York City,"
and said the project's density should be
reduced. He also referred to the
project's potential impact on Willow
Road, saying that proposed widening
did not address the primary issue of
bottlenecks at either end of the road.
Dale Draper of Menlo Park summed
up the residents' complaints by saying
"the project seems much too dense,"
and claimed most complaints could be
mitigated by reducing the number of
units.
Planning Commission members,
while expressing a number of reserva
tions about the project's design, seemed
satisified that the project as proposed is
not necessarily too large. Com
missioners' comments centered on the
development's appearance and the liv
ing conditions within the development.
Two primary site plans (Plans "A"
and "B") have been developed by
Sandy & Babcock, the Stanford West

architects; each plan would provide
1469 total units of housing. The46-acre
parcel north of Willow Road would
hold 1275 units (28 per acre), while a 4.3
acre site across Willow Road would
hold 194 units (45 per acre). The ap
proximately 50 acres involved represent
89 percent of the open land left in Palo
Alto that is zoned for high-density resi
dent..l! development.
While the Commission members
were unanimous in their preference for
Site Plan B, they nearly all agreed that
there is not that much difference be
tween the plans. Commissioner Helene
Wheeler said, "I prefer neither," and
Commission Chair Jean McCown said
the two plans were "not significantly
different."
Commissioner Fred Nichols said he
preferred Plan B because it provides a
larger "swath of open space" through
the middle of the development. He later
added that while there are features of
Plan B he would want incorporated in
any final design, he was not endorsing
the plan.
Criticisms of the project design cen
tered on the size and orientation of the
12 to 15 five-story, L-shaped buildings
that would dominate the northern sec
tion of the development, and what
McCown called a "lack of diversity" in
building types.
McCown said the buildings in the
larger northern section consisted of "a
set of types repeated over and over
again," and that the project as designed
would have a "sterile atmosphere."
