# Ordinance to control toxic waste proposed
## 
### SANDRA BODOVITZ Staff writer Last in a series 
A proposed Santa Clara County or
dinance which would regulate under
ground chemical storage tanks has unit
ed citizens groups, firefighters and the
affected industries themselves.
Last year a leak from an under
ground storage tank of the Fairchild
Camera and Instrument Co. con
taminated the water supply of South
San Jose residents. More than 30 simi
lar leaks were reported in the Silicon
Valley last year.
According to Peter Burnes, Palo Alto
industrial waste inspector, the or
dinance would close some of the
loopholes in current waste management
controls. State and Federal regulations
do not pertain directly to underground
storage.
The ordinance was developed by a
task force of the Santa Clara Fire Chiefs
Association. According to Ted Smith of
the Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition, a
citizens' group, "the two concerns that
have come together are extensive
ground water contamination and the
serious concerns the firefighters have."
If the county Inter-Governmental
Council approves the ordinance in Feb
ruary, the issue goes to the individual
Santa Clara Countv cities, which have
the final OK.
Area industries have formed their
own coalition to deal with the problem

of waste dispoal in general and the re
cent leaks in particular. The Industrial
Environmental Coordinating Commit
tee (IECC) was formed to help individ
ual companies work together to prevent
future leaks, said Larry Borgman, cor
porate manager of facilities planning at
Intel and a spokesman for the group.
The lECC participated in the plan
ning of the ordinance in an effort to me
diate community needs with those of in
dustry.
"The main emphasis of the ordinance
is on prevention, keeping there from
being a problem in the first place,"
Borgman said. "Whoever has a hazard
ous material must be responsible for
what happens: clean-up etc."

"As a practical matter the problems
of leaks (are) dealt with on a case-by
case basis," he said. "As soon as We had
a leak on our property we cleaned up."
But some South San Jose residents
say they haven't found all companies so
accomodating.
Lorraine Ross lives across the street
from the Fairchild Camera and Instru
ment Co. in San Jose. She said she
found out that her water had been con
taminated bv reading a newspaper arti
cle.
"We hadn't been officially notified.
We received written notice about eight
weeks later," Ross told the Daily.
"Fairchild would have us believe that
the leak occurred on December 7 and

that's the day the well was turned off.
"Whether it was in our water for one
day or six years, it shouldn't have been
there at all," she said.
Fairchild spokesman John Salizar
said the company discovered the prob
lem on December 4, 1981. "The well
was closed on December 7 when we got
test results back showing a concentra
tion of TCA."
Salizar said Fairchild notified gov
ernmental authorities, who determined
it was not necessary to notify the public.
Fairchild was readying a press release
when a resident "leaked the story" to
the San Jose Mercury and "that's how

the public found out, unfortunately,"
Salizar said.
Fairchild is now facing several law
suits from South San Jose residents.
Though industry takes "a pretty
tough line in terms of what makes sense
and we play a pretty tough game in
terms of the community and environ
mental needs," Burnes said his regu
latory agency is working with the af
fected companies. "We are outside the
realm of antagonism. We're cooperat
ing as a team," he said.
