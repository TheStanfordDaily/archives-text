# Family claims waste dumping harm

The chemical smell was nothing new to Lorraine Ross, but
she had no idea that the Fairchild Camera and Instrument
Co. was using toxic chemicals across the street from her
South San Jose home.
A vear-and-a-half ago Ross gave birth to a daughter who
suffers from multiple heart defects. About six months later, a
leak from Fairchild was found to have contaminated the wa
ter supply of the Ross' South San Jose neighborhood.
The leak was discovered last December, but Ross said she
believes that the water may have been contaminated for a
longer period of time.
"1 thought there were too many problems with children on
my street who had birth defects," Ross said. She wrote a let
ter to the San Jose Mercury linking what she thought were
not coincidental cases of,adult health problems, miscar
riages and birth defects to the contamination of Well 13 of
the Great Oaks Water Company in December of last year.
Ross' letter was one step in the long process of investigation
which began for South San Jose residents last winter.
The leaky well has been closed and Ross has moved, but in
response to her letter, state officials will conduct a health
survey to determine if the health problems are indeed linked
to the Fairchild leak.
Ross supports a model ordinance submitted to the Santa
Clara Inter-Governmental Council by the Fire Fighters As
sociation.
"Fairchild was not regulated by any of the agencies that
should have been regulating them," she said. "If there had
been tighter controls on the handling of disposing of the

chemicals none of this would have come about."
John Saiizar, spokesman for Fairchild, denied that any
regulations were violated. "There was no violation of any
regulations because there were no regulations perse that reg
ulated underground storage."
Saiizar said his company supports the ordinance and bet
ter regulation, but "there is no question that the ordinance
will affect our organization and company. The more difficult
and more costlv retro-fitting of tanks is the biggest expense."
One of the main problems Ross and other citizens encoun
tered was in acquiring accurate information. "We don't
think any of the public agencies have any moral conscience.
Our information hasn't come from them. It's come from
news tips and our own digging," Ross said.
"At the beginning we were too trusting. We tried to be
lieve as we had been taught that the government agencies
would work for us. We felt that they were working against
the community and working with Fairchild. After all they
don't want to get caught with their pants down," she said.
Ross said it the companies responsible for leaks didn't re
spond quickly enough. "During the first three weeks ev
eryone hoped that it would just blow over. Then they all ad
mitted to their leaks so thev wouldn't get caught. So many
were then reported that it became 'leak of the week,' " Ross
said.
Saiizar said that as soon as his company was aware of the
San Jose leak the well was closed down.
Fairchild now faces litigation suits from a number of San
Jose residents.
