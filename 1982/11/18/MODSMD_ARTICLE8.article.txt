## U.S. links pipeline sanction lift to allied agreement U.S. calls agreement unanimous despite 'non' from French officials

President Reagan's lifting of sanctions against the Soviet pipeline
project stirred almost as much controversy as its initial levying:
French officials voiced disapproval of the action while foreign policy
experts described the move as conciliatory toward a new Soviet re
gime.
Both Reagan and administration officials insist, however, that the
sanctions were lifted because the United States and its key allies had
reached "substantial agreement" on an overall economic strategy
toward the Soviet bloc.
Within hours of Reagan's statements made during his weekly Satur
day radio address, France dissociated itself from the policy agreement
by saying in a Paris communique that France was "not a party to the
agreement announced this afternoon in Washington." President
Francois Mitterand of France repeated Monday the French conten
tion that Reagan's announcement of an agreement was premature and
that negotiations were continuing.
Questions remain about why Reagan would announce an agree
ment before every word had been completed. A State Department of
ficial said Saturday it was done because the administration wanted to
remove the sanctions matter as an issue before Chancellor Helmut
Kohl of Germany arrived in Washington Tuesday. On Tuesday a
White House official said that all the parties were in agreement on the
substance of the document and that the haggling was only in regard to
how the accord would be made public. The French, the official said,
wanted the president to announce the East-West policy statement and
then announce the lifting of pipeline sanctions a few days later without
referring to the policy accord. Mitterand has declared the American
sanction illegal and wanted to avoid the appearance of having made
concessions to get the sanctions against French and other companies
lifted.
Other European allies, however, have not raised objections to the
Reagan administration announcement. And in a joint statement with
Reagan issued in Washington Tuesday Chancellor Kohl supported
the American contention that an accord had been achieved. The two
leaders "greeted with satisfaction the recent agreement on measures
leading to a broader consensus on East-West economic relations."
However, State Department officials admitted that the accord has not
been signed by any government.
Because of the death of Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev, there was
also some speculation that the sanctions were being lifted as a gesture
to the new Soviet leadership. Senior officials at the White House re
futed the "olive branch" view and said the announcement would
probably have been made on Thursday or Friday of last week if not for
the events in the Kremlin. Reagan added that it was not linked to the
release of Solidarity union leader Lech Walesa. The statement seemed
a bit of a flip-flop from original goals to apply pressure on Moscow
which in turn would presumably influence Warsaw to moderate its ac
tions against the Solidarity movement.
Reagan imposed the sanctions against U.S. companies involved in
building the Soviet natural gas pipeline after imposition of martial law
in Poland last December. They were extended to foreign companies
using U.S. technology in June after the collapse of efforts to reach a
limited agreement on East-West trade at an economic summit in Ver
sailles, France.
Within days of presumed accord at Versailles, Paris and Washing
ton exchanged bitter recriminations in an atmosphere that spread to

other European countries after the sanctions were extended.
Under the sanctions, selected U.S.-made or U.S.-licensed oil
gas equipment was embargoed to companies that shipped items for
the Soviet natural gas pipeline that is to extend to Western Europe.
U.S. companies or their subsidiaries lost an estimated $2.2 billion in
existing contracts because of the sanctions. Violators of the sanctions
were subject to total cutoff of further U.S. pipeline parts and technolo
gy for any use, not simply to fill order for the Soviet Union.
At least 20 European firms, mainly West German, have contracts to
provide equipment for the pipeline, using U.S. technology under
license. The contracts are worth a reported $ll billion, the largest
East-West trade deal ever, and mean jobs for the depressed Western
European economies.
Firms in Britain, France, West Germany, Italy and Japan were
affected by the sanctions. Japan was planning an offshore oil drilling
venture with the Soviets. As of early November, six European com
panies had been blacklisted by the Commerce Deparment for vio
lating Reagan's sanctions. The blacklisting drew widespread protest
from the British, French and West German governments.
The United States has opposed the pipeline on grounds that it
would supply much-needed hard currency to the Soviets and would
make Western Europe dependent upon Soviet energy.
Europeans countered that the sanctions only served to hurt their al
ready depressed economies without having any major impact on the
3500-mile pipeline, which to the Europeans represents much needed
jobs and the prospect of lessening dependence on energy supplies from
the unpredictable Persian Gulf region.
The agreement announcement came following weeks of intensive
negotiations between the United States and its major European allies
to agree on a face-saving alternative for the Europeans and the
gan administration. In his radio broadcast Reagan said the United
States and leading allies Britain, Canada, France, Italy, Japan and
West Germany have agreed on the following:
•Not to engage in trade agreements that "contribute to the military
or strategic advantage of the U.5.5.R.," with special emphasis on
trade in high technology;
•Not to give preferential aid to the "heavily militarized Soviet econ
omy";
•Not to sign any new natural gas contracts with the Soviet Union,
pending a new alliance study on energy alternatives;
•To strengthen exisitng controls on transfer of strategic items to the
Soviets;
•To establish procedures for monitoring financial relations with the
Soviet Union, with the goal of harmonizing the alliance's "export
credit policies."
In his broadcast Reagan said the U.S.-imposed sanctions were no
longer necessary because of the agreement but added that "the
of restoring a proper balance in relations with the Soviet Union is
ended. It will take time to make up for the losses incurred in past
years."

other European countries after the sanctions were extended.
Under the sanctions, selected U.S.-made or U.S.-licensed oil
gas equipment was embargoed to companies that shipped items for
the Soviet natural gas pipeline that is to extend to Western Europe.
U.S. companies or their subsidiaries lost an estimated $2.2 billion in
existing contracts because of the sanctions. Violators of the sanctions
were subject to total cutoff of further U.S. pipeline parts and technolo
gy for any use, not simply to fill order for the Soviet Union.
At least 20 European firms, mainly West German, have contracts to
provide equipment for the pipeline, using U.S. technology under
license. The contracts are worth a reported $ll billion, the largest
East-West trade deal ever, and mean jobs for the depressed Western
European economies.
Firms in Britain, France, West Germany, Italy and Japan were
affected by the sanctions. Japan was planning an offshore oil drilling
venture with the Soviets. As of early November, six European com
panies had been blacklisted by the Commerce Deparment for vio
lating Reagan's sanctions. The blacklisting drew widespread protest
from the British, French and West German governments.
The United States has opposed the pipeline on grounds that it
would supply much-needed hard currency to the Soviets and would
make Western Europe dependent upon Soviet energy.
Europeans countered that the sanctions only served to hurt their al
ready depressed economies without having any major impact on the
3500-mile pipeline, which to the Europeans represents much needed
jobs and the prospect of lessening dependence on energy supplies from
the unpredictable Persian Gulf region.
The agreement announcement came following weeks of intensive
negotiations between the United States and its major European allies
to agree on a face-saving alternative for the Europeans and the
gan administration. In his radio broadcast Reagan said the United
States and leading allies Britain, Canada, France, Italy, Japan and
West Germany have agreed on the following:
•Not to engage in trade agreements that "contribute to the military
or strategic advantage of the U.5.5.R.," with special emphasis on
trade in high technology;
•Not to give preferential aid to the "heavily militarized Soviet econ
omy";
•Not to sign any new natural gas contracts with the Soviet Union,
pending a new alliance study on energy alternatives;
•To strengthen exisitng controls on transfer of strategic items to the
Soviets;
•To establish procedures for monitoring financial relations with the
Soviet Union, with the goal of harmonizing the alliance's "export
credit policies."
In his broadcast Reagan said the U.S.-imposed sanctions were no
longer necessary because of the agreement but added that "the
of restoring a proper balance in relations with the Soviet Union is
ended. It will take time to make up for the losses incurred in past
years."

he was lifting controversial U.S. sanctions
against the pipeline.
Compiled from news reports and wire services

President Reagan's lifting of sanctions against the Soviet pipeline
project stirred almost as much controversy as its initial levying:
French officials voiced disapproval of the action while foreign policy
experts described the move as conciliatory toward a new Soviet re
gime.
Both Reagan and administration officials insist, however, that the
sanctions were lifted because the United States and its key allies had
reached "substantial agreement" on an overall economic strategy
toward the Soviet bloc.
Within hours of Reagan's statements made during his weekly Satur
day radio address, France dissociated itself from the policy agreement
by saying in a Paris communique that France was "not a party to the
agreement announced this afternoon in Washington." President
Francois Mitterand of France repeated Monday the French conten
tion that Reagan's announcement of an agreement was premature and
that negotiations were continuing.
Questions remain about why Reagan would announce an agree
ment before every word had been completed. A State Department of
ficial said Saturday it was done because the administration wanted to
remove the sanctions matter as an issue before Chancellor Helmut
Kohl of Germany arrived in Washington Tuesday. On Tuesday a
White House official said that all the parties were in agreement on the
substance of the document and that the haggling was only in regard to
how the accord would be made public. The French, the official said,
wanted the president to announce the East-West policy statement and
then announce the lifting of pipeline sanctions a few days later without
referring to the policy accord. Mitterand has declared the American
sanction illegal and wanted to avoid the appearance of having made
concessions to get the sanctions against French and other companies
lifted.
Other European allies, however, have not raised objections to the
Reagan administration announcement. And in a joint statement with
Reagan issued in Washington Tuesday Chancellor Kohl supported
the American contention that an accord had been achieved. The two
leaders "greeted with satisfaction the recent agreement on measures
leading to a broader consensus on East-West economic relations."
However, State Department officials admitted that the accord has not
been signed by any government.
Because of the death of Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev, there was
also some speculation that the sanctions were being lifted as a gesture
to the new Soviet leadership. Senior officials at the White House re
futed the "olive branch" view and said the announcement would
probably have been made on Thursday or Friday of last week if not for
the events in the Kremlin. Reagan added that it was not linked to the
release of Solidarity union leader Lech Walesa. The statement seemed
a bit of a flip-flop from original goals to apply pressure on Moscow
which in turn would presumably influence Warsaw to moderate its ac
tions against the Solidarity movement.
Reagan imposed the sanctions against U.S. companies involved in
building the Soviet natural gas pipeline after imposition of martial law
in Poland last December. They were extended to foreign companies
using U.S. technology in June after the collapse of efforts to reach a
limited agreement on East-West trade at an economic summit in Ver
sailles, France.
