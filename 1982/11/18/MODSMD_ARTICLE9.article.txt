European government leaders and officials of
companies affected bv the Soviet pipeline-trade
embargo have expressed approval of President
Reagan's decision to lift the sanctions.
"I am delighted with President Reagan's an
nouncement," said British Foreign Minister
Francis Pym through a spokesman. Pym termed
it "good news for the West."
A spokesman for the West German govern
ment in Bonn said, "The government sees this as
a signal to the Soviet Union for constructive de
velopments in East-West relations."
In London, a spokesman for Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher said, "If it is a clear lifting of
sanctions against British conmanies, the prime
minister will be pleased."
Meanwhile, Jack Gatzemeyer, general man
ager of General Electric's international gas tur
bine department, said the company was
"pleased that an accommodation has been
reached."
"We feel the president's action' is a very
positive development," said Gatzemeyer.
European officials have opposed the sanc
tions from the start aS "unilateral and un
justified." But they have for some time also
sought to reach an agreement on trade with So
viet Bloc countries. One outcome of that was the
Versailles communique released last summer af
ter the economic stimmit at Versailles.

In that communique, the Atlantic allies and
Japan undertook to "handle cautiously financial
relations with the U.S.S.R. and other Eastern
European countries" and to show "commercial
prudence" in the granting of export credits.
There is general agreement that the accommoda
tion of which Reagan spoke in making his an
nouncement did not go beyond the proposals
made at Versailles, except to get the Europeans
to agree not to sign any new natural gas con
tracts with the Soviet Union until a new study of
energy alternatives is completed. However, that
is a moot point since no new contracts were fore
seen in the near future.
On Tuesday, a group of American busi
nessmen meeting in Moscow for the first time in
four years were told by senior Soviet trade of
ficials that Washington will have to renounce
trade sanctions if trade is to be revived.
The Soviet Minister for Foreign Trade,
Nikolai Patolichev, told the meeting of the U.S.-
U.S.S.R. Trade and Economic Council that
without the confidence that agreements will not
be broken, "no businessman will sign an agree
ment."
William Verity, chairman of Armco, an Amer
ican company, told the council that he thinks the
lifting of the pipeline sanctions should make
trade easier and that trade could now grow from
the $3.4 billion registered this year.
