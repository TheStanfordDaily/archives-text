# Tradition calls for intense Big Game rivalry
## 
### LISA STERN 
Big Game. Just the fact that
the letters are capitalized alerts
even the most naive freshman to
the fact that this weekend's
matchup is special. The Big
Game symbolizes all the rivalry
that college football can muster:
competition on the field, com
petition bv the bands at rallies,
even the traditional competition
between alumni groups to see
who can set up the best pre-game
tailgater.
And when all the fighting is
over, one school becomes
number one in the Bay Area â€” at
least for this year. And their
prize? The beloved Axe, of
course, which is presented an
nually to the winning school.
History reveals that the first
axe was displayed at a baseball
game in 1879. The Berkelev ban
dits stole the trophy that very
April day and kept it locked away
on the Berkeley campus for some
30 years. In 1933, however, the
schools agreed to share the Axe
by giving it to the winner of the
Big Game each year.
The Big Game itself has usual
ly lived up to the fans' expecta
tions, and the contests have tradi
tionally been settled in the fourth
quarter. Almost half of the 84
games have been decided by a
one-touchdown margin or less.
Stanford currently leads the
series 40-34 with 10 games ending
in deadlock. Total scoring for the
two teams in the series is sepa
rated by only 31 points to the
Cardinal's advantage.
Many sports historians believe
that the first Big Game, though
not a contest between two pow
erhouse football squads, was,
nonetheless, the most memorable
for its sheer value in ironic hu
mor. On that fall day in 1892, the
game got off to a slow start when
Stanford manager Herbert Hoo

ver (ves, that's President Herbert
Hoover) forgot to bring a foot
ball to the stadium. That incident
proved to be a positive omen for
Stanford, which went on to upset
Cal.
Five of the 10 ties between the
teams in the series occurred in

games played from 1 892-1 923.
During this period each team
compiled 12 victories.
The 1924 Big Game set a prece
dent for those contests to follow.
Played in the brand new Califor
nia Memorial Stadium in front of
a crowd of 77,000, some on
lookers payed more than $ 100 for
tickets to see the two undefeated
squads battle. Cal led 20-6 with

just two minutes to go in the
fourth quarter when Stanford
stormed back to score two touch
downs under the direction of sig
nal caller Edgar Walker. Thus,
the contest was again deadlocked
at the final gun, 20-20.
In the vears to follow, both

teams stood true to this tradition
of close contests, and both teams
became known for attempting to
pull out the show-stopping-we
almost-beat-vou-but-we-missed
big plays. One memorable flea
flicker attempt was that engi
neered bv All-America tight end
Bill McColl. who just missed hit

ting receiver Bob Bryan on a 61-
vard bomb in the 1950 Big Game.
In recent years, the match-up
has resulted in some thrilling mo
ments. Here is a brief sample.
In 1972 Stanford led 21-18
with only 1:18 left in the fourth
quarter of plav. However, a se-

quence of events beginning with a
19-vard punt return and ending
with two pass interference calls
left Cal with the ball on the Stan
ford eight yard line with only
three seconds showing on the
game clock. Cal ignored the pos
sibility of a tie and pulled off the
victory when Bear quarterback, a

freshman by the name of Vince
Ferragamo, tossed the hall to
tight end Steve Sweeney in the
end zone on the last play.
The 1974 contest was no less
exciting than that plaved two
years before. Stanford came back
from a 10-3 deficit to lead the
game 19-10 with 7:36 left on the
clock. Cal fought right back, nar
rowing the margin with a field
goal, and then scoring what ap
peared to be the winning touch
down with only 26 seconds to go.
Undaunted, the Cardinal, led by
quarterback Guy Benjamin,
completed two quick passes and
then called on kicker Mike
Langford, who calmly ran on the
field and booted a 50 yard field
goal to give Stanford the victory.
In 1976 the Cardinal was
motivated to win the Big Game
for their coach. Jack Christian
son, who was fired the day before
the contest. Although the Bears
led 24-19 with onlv 2:20 remain
ing in the game, Cal's Marky
Crane fumbled the ball on his
team's two vard line. Duncan
McColl recovered for Stanford,
and two plays later Ron Inge
sewed up the victory for the
Cardinal bv plunging in the end
zone for the winning score.
The 1979 Big Game also came
down to the wire as Stanford
mounted a lust minute drive to
try to close the Bear's 21-14 lead.
With only 40 seconds to go, the
Cardinal had fourth and goal to
go on the one yard line, but quar
terback Turk Schonert's roll out
pass fell incomplete in the end
zone, and Cal preserved its vic
tory.
On this, the 90th anniversary
of the first Big Game, fans can ex
pect this year's contest will be just
as healed as those preceding it.
