# Kapp inspires Cal wins with motivation drills
## 
### MARK ZEIGLER 
It's hard to distinguish be
tween Joe Kapp the football
player and Joe Kapp the football
coach.
His official title is Cal's head
football coach, but his words and
his experience leads one to be
lieve that there is more than a lit
tle quarterback still left in him.
Before this fall, Kapp had not
coached a down of football at
any level in any capacitv.
Consequently, words upon
words have been written about
Kapp, trying to decide whether
or not he can coach a football
game. Cal is 6-4 heading into Sat
urday's Big Game, while their
cross-Bay rivals are 5-5.
But what Kapp exactly does
remains a mystery. Sure, he'll
have transformed a 2-9 Bear
squad into one with a winning
record, but if that is the result of
Kapp remains debateable.
"I don't know what he does, to
be honest with you," Stanford
head coach Paul Wiggin said last
week of Kapp. "I'm sure he's had
an impact on them from the
standpoint of selling Cal foot
ball."
"There's a Jot of screaming
and singing in the streets," he
added,
Indeed, Kapp is a fine market
ing tool. To Cal football fans, Joe
Kapp means more marks in the
win column than the loss column,
a problem in Berkeley as of late.
Besides directing the Bears to
their last Rose Bowl appearance,

he ranks second in school history
in passing and total offensive
yardage.
In eight years in the Canadian
Football League (CFL), Kapp
became the league's second best
passer in history, leading the Brit
ish Columbia Lions to two Grey
Cup appearances in the 1960'5.
In 1970, Kapp became the only
player in history to ever quarter
back teams in the Rose Bowl,
Grey Cup and Super Bowl by
taking the Minnesota Vikings to
Super Bowl.
Besides the thousands of pages
of statistics on Kapp as an athe
lete, there is another dimension
to the man.
"I know Joe Kapp will get
them (Cal) ready for the Big
Game," said Cardinal halfback
Mike Dotterer. "He's a great
motivator."
As a football and basketball
player at Cal in the late 1950'5,
Kapp played with intensity
equalled bv few, according to his
coaches. If a ball was loose, he
was the first to dive on it. That
fiestv collegiate spirit has stayed
with Kapp all his life.
Just try interviewing him. The
most difficult task, even on a one
to-one basis, is elicting a descrip
tion of just what he does at Cal.
He answers onlv as much of a
question as he has to. He speaks
in a low voice that features fre
quent interruptions, a
touch of dramatics to what he
savs.

"Mv job. my profession is a
football coach," Kapp said
Wednesday afternoon over the
phone. "I try to do what I under
stand what a football coach is
supposed to do."
What does a football coach
do?
"My job is to run the ship,
that's how I see it,"he answered.
"My job is to make sure mv team
is prepared to play on Saturday
and ready to compete in the
toughest (college) football con
ference in the nation."
Joe Kapp may not be very
articulate. His mind is a Barlett's
of athletic cliches that are de
rivatives of "winning one for the
Clipper." He doesn't shv away
from drawing from this well,
either.
But when he answers a ques
tion with a cliche, he does so sin
cerely. Kapp savs what he means
and means what he savs.
"To me, this (the Big Game)
has all the makings of a bowl
game," he says. "So emotion has
a factor in the game." A pause.
"It's what football is all about."
The cliches don't stop there.
"In the end (of the Big Game),
may the best team win," he will
tell vou. Another pause and a
more serious voice. "I want the
best team to win."
So who is the best team? No
pause this time. "That's why
we're plaving Saturday."
Cliches can become tiresome,
however, especially for those

covering Cal football week in and
week out. In fact, many media
personalities have expressed their
disgust with the manner in which
Kapp treats them. As he admits,
"I've been accused as not having
much tact bv the media."
There was the shouting ex
change on a local radio talk

show. There was the incident
where Kapp told off an angrv
alumnist. But with Kapp, like a
Billy Martin or a John McEnroe,
you get the entire package, take it
or leave it. Vou get the double
steals and the topspin lobs, and
you also get the shouting matches
with umpires and linesmen.
Kapp is a competitor. He is
also a cheerleader. Nevertheless,
his "go team, go" spirit is con
tagious. When asked if in his pre-
Big (iame talk he would tell his
players to win or to just "do their
hest," Kapp was at his best.
