# Hooper looks toward med school after game
## 
### BETH KLEID 
After playing as a fullback for
his fourth straight year, Greg
Hooper has finally accepted the
fact that he is a fullback — and he
takes pride in his position.
"I was recruited as a half
back," said Hooper. "One day
during my freshman year 1 was
told 'Oh Greg, by the way you're
a fullback now.' It was quite a
shock! It was like a slap in the
face, and 1 was a little depressed
at first. During my first three
years at Stanford 1 always felt
like a fullback in a halfback's
body, but now I've realized that
I'm a fullback. I've assumed the
fullback mentality."
Although Hooper's feelings
about being a fullback were un
certain, it was clear to Cardinal
fans that he was a fullback — and
a good one at that. In 1979
Hooper gained 238 yards and
ranked third on the team. Also in

his freshman year he grabbed 12
passes for 48 yards, and he made
a 54 yard run which was the long
est of the season.
Hooper has good memories of
the 1979 season and the last half
of his freshman year. "The first
game I ever started as a freshman
was the Arizona game, and I
scored a touchdown. It was
great! I was on TV and ev
erything," said Hooper.
How did the halfback turned
inexperienced fullback get to
start in his freshman year? It was
a matter of getting a lucky break,
and having confidence. "It really
was a transition for me to come
here. I was a glory athlete in high
school, so at first Stanford foot
ball was an ego-blow. Then peo
ple started getting hurt and I got
the chance to start. When I got
my self-confidence back I was
able to shine a little bit," noted
Hooper.

Hooper describes himself as a
consistent player. "In my posi
tion as fullback you are really not
too inclined to shine that much,"
he said. "I take pride in doing
what 1 do. and doing it well. At
Stanford the fullback does get to
run the ball. I've had some really
good runs that have reminded me
of my high school days."
Hooper attended Fremont
High School in nearby Sun
nyvale. He was named to the All-
Central-Coast Section Team,
and was named the league's run
ning back of the year. He also
played shortstop on his high
school's baseball team, and ran
track. The all-around-athlete
played tennis, too. At one time he
was ranked No. 9 in Northern
California junior tennis.
Tennis players are not uncom
mon in the Hooper family.
Hooper's brother Chip is ranked

number 25 on the world pro
fessional tennis circuit. "When
we were little I realized that 1
didn't like to practice tennis so I
hung up my racket, but Chip
stuck with it," Hooper said.
There was never any real com
petition between us; we are both
proud of each other and respect
each other's sports."
Hooper's interests go beyond
sports. He enjoys nature and
likes to backpack. He loves music
and has played the jazz guitar for
the past five years. Hooper com
bines his musical talent with foot
ball. "Some guys on the team and
I write fun songs for the team,"
he said. "Sometimes they are
about the team we will be playing
in the upcoming game. It's lots of
fun and helps loosen us up."
Hooper is a human biology
major and he plans to go to medi
cal school. "I would like to be
come an orthopedic surgeon
partly because I have been so ex
posed to the field since I've been
involved in football," said
Hooper.
Playing professional football is
not among Hooper's top
priorities. "Right now playing
pro football is not on my mind; it
conflicts with my plans for the
future. If there was financial in
centive I might reconsider, but no

serious offers have been made as
of yet," added Hooper.
Hooper has never had any real
difficulties combining academics
with athletics. Suprisingly, he
feels that he does a little better ac
ademically during football sea
son. "During the season you are
forced to regiment your time, and
include time for schoolwork,"
said Hooper.
Hooper is thankful for his four
fantastic years as a part of the
Stanford football program. "I re
ally love it here, and I've had four
fun years. It's too bad that this
year we didn't get the winning
season we had hoped for."
Unfortunately, this season
Hooper injured his neck during
the USC game. He missed a few
contests because with continued
play he possibly could have lost
dexterity in his fingers. Hooper
found it frustrating to sit on the
sidelines, but he agrees that it was
best for him not to play. "I hate
to play half-speed," remarked
Hooper. "I like to go out there
full-go!"
For Hooper, the Cal game is
his final chance to shine this sea
son, and it is his final game as a
college football player. "It will be
the biggest of all Big Games for
me," said Hooper with a note of
optimism.

pro football is not on my mind; it
conflicts with my plans for the
future. If there was financial in
centive I might reconsider, but no

serious offers have been made as
of yet," added Hooper.
Hooper has never had any real
difficulties combining academics
with athletics. Suprisingly, he
feels that he does a little better ac
ademically during football sea
son. "During the season you are
forced to regiment your time, and
include time for schoolwork,"
said Hooper.
Hooper is thankful for his four
fantastic years as a part of the
Stanford football program. "I re
ally love it here, and I've had four
fun years. It's too bad that this
year we didn't get the winning
season we had hoped for."
Unfortunately, this season
Hooper injured his neck during
the USC game. He missed a few
contests because with continued
play he possibly could have lost
dexterity in his fingers. Hooper
found it frustrating to sit on the
sidelines, but he agrees that it was
best for him not to play. "I hate
to play half-speed," remarked
Hooper. "I like to go out there
full-go!"
For Hooper, the Cal game is
his final chance to shine this sea
son, and it is his final game as a
college football player. "It will be
the biggest of all Big Games for
me," said Hooper with a note of
optimism.

DIFFERENT STROKES: Brother of tennis star Chip Hooper, Stanford fullback Greg Hooper blocks
an opposing player in the Oregon State game tnis season. While he was hurt later in the season
against USC, he should be ready for the Big Game.
After playing as a fullback for
his fourth straight year, Greg
Hooper has finally accepted the
fact that he is a fullback — and he
takes pride in his position.
"I was recruited as a half
back," said Hooper. "One day
during my freshman year 1 was
told 'Oh Greg, by the way you're
a fullback now.' It was quite a
shock! It was like a slap in the
face, and 1 was a little depressed
at first. During my first three
years at Stanford 1 always felt
like a fullback in a halfback's
body, but now I've realized that
I'm a fullback. I've assumed the
fullback mentality."
Although Hooper's feelings
about being a fullback were un
certain, it was clear to Cardinal
fans that he was a fullback — and
a good one at that. In 1979
Hooper gained 238 yards and
ranked third on the team. Also in

his freshman year he grabbed 12
passes for 48 yards, and he made
a 54 yard run which was the long
est of the season.
Hooper has good memories of
the 1979 season and the last half
of his freshman year. "The first
game I ever started as a freshman
was the Arizona game, and I
scored a touchdown. It was
great! I was on TV and ev
erything," said Hooper.
How did the halfback turned
inexperienced fullback get to
start in his freshman year? It was
a matter of getting a lucky break,
and having confidence. "It really
was a transition for me to come
here. I was a glory athlete in high
school, so at first Stanford foot
ball was an ego-blow. Then peo
ple started getting hurt and I got
the chance to start. When I got
my self-confidence back I was
able to shine a little bit," noted
Hooper.

Hooper describes himself as a
consistent player. "In my posi
tion as fullback you are really not
too inclined to shine that much,"
he said. "I take pride in doing
what 1 do. and doing it well. At
Stanford the fullback does get to
run the ball. I've had some really
good runs that have reminded me
of my high school days."
Hooper attended Fremont
High School in nearby Sun
nyvale. He was named to the All-
Central-Coast Section Team,
and was named the league's run
ning back of the year. He also
played shortstop on his high
school's baseball team, and ran
track. The all-around-athlete
played tennis, too. At one time he
was ranked No. 9 in Northern
California junior tennis.
Tennis players are not uncom
mon in the Hooper family.
Hooper's brother Chip is ranked

number 25 on the world pro
fessional tennis circuit. "When
we were little I realized that 1
didn't like to practice tennis so I
hung up my racket, but Chip
stuck with it," Hooper said.
There was never any real com
petition between us; we are both
proud of each other and respect
each other's sports."
Hooper's interests go beyond
sports. He enjoys nature and
likes to backpack. He loves music
and has played the jazz guitar for
the past five years. Hooper com
bines his musical talent with foot
ball. "Some guys on the team and
I write fun songs for the team,"
he said. "Sometimes they are
about the team we will be playing
in the upcoming game. It's lots of
fun and helps loosen us up."
Hooper is a human biology
major and he plans to go to medi
cal school. "I would like to be
come an orthopedic surgeon
partly because I have been so ex
posed to the field since I've been
involved in football," said
Hooper.
Playing professional football is
not among Hooper's top
priorities. "Right now playing
pro football is not on my mind; it
conflicts with my plans for the
future. If there was financial in
centive I might reconsider, but no

serious offers have been made as
of yet," added Hooper.
