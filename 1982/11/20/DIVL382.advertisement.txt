The Dirty Golden Bear is losing
all his hair,
His teeth are out, he's got the
gout,
He don't know what it's all
about,
His eyes are made of glass,
He's losing all of his class,
So take the Dirty Golden Bear
and shove him up your a—!
The Dirty Golden Bear has dirty
p— hair,
His eyes are red, his d— is
dead,
He can not get it up in bed.
He tried to use his hand,
But could not find his gland,
So you can find him j off
the UC-Berkeley Band.
