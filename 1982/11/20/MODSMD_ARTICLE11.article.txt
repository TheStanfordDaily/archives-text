# Campaign to rebuild squad begins after season finale
## 
### DAVE DUTCHER 
Stanford football fans, know
ing that Saturday's Big Game
clash with California is the final
game of the 1982 season, are un
doubtedly looking toward next
year.
They are not alone in their
foresight. The Cardinal coaching
staff knows that to maintain a
competitive team it is necessary
to recruit top players to go along
with the returners.
The obvious spot to fill is at
quarterback, and while it is pleas
ant to marvel at senior John
Elway's accomplishments during
his time on the Farm, the Stan
ford offense will need a re
placement at this key position for
the 1983 campaign.
The returners competing for
the signal caller's spot are junior
Steve Cottrell and sophomores
Greg Topp and Fred Buckley.
Before the 38-35 loss to UCLA
Saturday, Cardinal head coach
Paul Wiggin said, "If we had to
go to war tomorrow the heir ap
parent at quarterback would be
Cottrell."
But Wiggin, in an interview

last week, emphasized that the
new quarterback will emerge af
ter next spring's practice drills
and that Cottrell, Topp and
Buckley will not be the only can
didates for the job.
"We're still going to recruit for
quarterbacks it's a priority.
We'll never pass up a chance to
get a great quarterback. We're
trying to continue to keep up the
level of quarterback greats at
Stanford."
Aside from the position of
quarterback, the offense as a
whole will suffer large losses.
Seven of the Cardinal offensive
players which started Saturday
against UCLA will graduate. The
only returners are sophomore
split end Emile Harry, flanker
Mike Tolliver (returning for a
fifth year), junior tackle Jeff De
aton and junior guard Matt
Moran.
Wiggin is confident the
vacated positions will be filled
well by the returners and new re
cruits, but because there will be
new names and faces at most of
the offensive positions, the of
fense's look will also be slightly

different.
"We're going to be a new team
in a lot of ways but we'll be doing
the same thing. We'll be less re
liant on what has been our key
position before: quarterback."
When Stanford recruits new
players, Wiggin pointed out, it is
just like any other university.
"Our recruiting budget is as
high as any other Division One
school," Wiggin said. "We focus
on great athletes from out of state
a player has to be a guaranteed
good player on the national level
before we'll go for him."
The Cardinal team usually re
cruits approximately two Cali
fornia players for every athlete
from out of the state, and while
this ratio has remained constant,
At is not intended to be that way.
"We're on almost a 2-1 basis,"
Wiggin said. "It's not something
we try for, but that's the way it
comes out."
Wiggin reported that Stanford
generally recruits well west of the
Rocky Mountains and added
that the national* television ex
posure the Cardinal received this
season will aid the recruiting
cause.
"It (the national television ap
pearances) will help because you
saw a system and a great player in
that system," Wiggin said, refer
ring to Elway. "It leaves a mark.
We'll run into players that will
say, T saw you guys on TV.' "
When Stanford looks to re
plenish its ranks with new players
it looks primarily for freshmen
who will be on the scene for four
years, as opposed to some
schools who look for junior col
lege players.
"We generally don't deal with
JCs," Wiggin said. "We'll try to
get some JCs because we can ill
afford to let anybody good get
by.

"We have a sophisticated pro
gram," the Cardinal boss con
tinued. "We would rather build
with freshmen."
At the outset of a year's re
cruiting effort, the Stanford
coaching staff prepares a priority
list consisting of exactly what
type of players are needed to fill
certain positions. Wiggin noted
that the Cardinal tries for an
abundance of tight
end/linebacker types of players
because the players at those posi
tions are generally versatile.
Linemen, Wiggin added, are
"always a premium need."
On the defensive side of the
football, Stanford will lose only

two starters. Graduating are line
backer and defensive captain
Kevin Bates, and linebacker
Gary Wimmer. The entire de
fensive line will return intact
along with all of the defensive
backfield. Senior cornerback
Kevin Baird has a year of
eligibility left and will return next
year.
"We're going to have a good
defense next year," Wiggin
stated. "The defense is going to
have to help the offensive get
back on its feet.
"And the offense will get back
on its feet," Wiggin emphasized.
"We'll bounce back well."

While preparing for Big Game, Wiggin and his coaching staff also
have to keep tabs on the high school players they are trying to
recruit. Heading Stanford's list is Menlo quarterback John Paye.

game of the 1982 season, are un
doubtedly looking toward next
year.
They are not alone in their
foresight. The Cardinal coaching
staff knows that to maintain a
competitive team it is necessary
to recruit top players to go along
with the returners.
The obvious spot to fill is at
quarterback, and while it is pleas
ant to marvel at senior John
Elway's accomplishments during
his time on the Farm, the Stan
ford offense will need a re
placement at this key position for
the 1983 campaign.
The returners competing for
the signal caller's spot are junior
Steve Cottrell and sophomores
Greg Topp and Fred Buckley.
Before the 38-35 loss to UCLA
Saturday, Cardinal head coach
Paul Wiggin said, "If we had to
go to war tomorrow the heir ap
parent at quarterback would be
Cottrell."
But Wiggin, in an interview

last week, emphasized that the
new quarterback will emerge af
ter next spring's practice drills
and that Cottrell, Topp and
Buckley will not be the only can
didates for the job.
"We're still going to recruit for
quarterbacks it's a priority.
We'll never pass up a chance to
get a great quarterback. We're
trying to continue to keep up the
level of quarterback greats at
Stanford."
Aside from the position of
quarterback, the offense as a
whole will suffer large losses.
Seven of the Cardinal offensive
players which started Saturday
against UCLA will graduate. The
only returners are sophomore
split end Emile Harry, flanker
Mike Tolliver (returning for a
fifth year), junior tackle Jeff De
aton and junior guard Matt
Moran.
Wiggin is confident the
vacated positions will be filled
well by the returners and new re
cruits, but because there will be
new names and faces at most of
the offensive positions, the of
fense's look will also be slightly

different.
"We're going to be a new team
in a lot of ways but we'll be doing
the same thing. We'll be less re
liant on what has been our key
position before: quarterback."
When Stanford recruits new
players, Wiggin pointed out, it is
just like any other university.
"Our recruiting budget is as
high as any other Division One
school," Wiggin said. "We focus
on great athletes from out of state
a player has to be a guaranteed
good player on the national level
before we'll go for him."
The Cardinal team usually re
cruits approximately two Cali
fornia players for every athlete
from out of the state, and while
this ratio has remained constant,
At is not intended to be that way.
"We're on almost a 2-1 basis,"
Wiggin said. "It's not something
we try for, but that's the way it
comes out."
Wiggin reported that Stanford
generally recruits well west of the
Rocky Mountains and added
that the national* television ex
posure the Cardinal received this
season will aid the recruiting
cause.
"It (the national television ap
pearances) will help because you
saw a system and a great player in
that system," Wiggin said, refer
ring to Elway. "It leaves a mark.
We'll run into players that will
say, T saw you guys on TV.' "
When Stanford looks to re
plenish its ranks with new players
it looks primarily for freshmen
who will be on the scene for four
years, as opposed to some
schools who look for junior col
lege players.
"We generally don't deal with
JCs," Wiggin said. "We'll try to
get some JCs because we can ill
afford to let anybody good get
by.

"We have a sophisticated pro
gram," the Cardinal boss con
tinued. "We would rather build
with freshmen."
At the outset of a year's re
cruiting effort, the Stanford
coaching staff prepares a priority
list consisting of exactly what
type of players are needed to fill
certain positions. Wiggin noted
that the Cardinal tries for an
abundance of tight
end/linebacker types of players
because the players at those posi
tions are generally versatile.
Linemen, Wiggin added, are
"always a premium need."
On the defensive side of the
football, Stanford will lose only

two starters. Graduating are line
backer and defensive captain
Kevin Bates, and linebacker
Gary Wimmer. The entire de
fensive line will return intact
along with all of the defensive
backfield. Senior cornerback
Kevin Baird has a year of
eligibility left and will return next
year.
"We're going to have a good
defense next year," Wiggin
stated. "The defense is going to
have to help the offensive get
back on its feet.
"And the offense will get back
on its feet," Wiggin emphasized.
"We'll bounce back well."

INTO THE FUTURE: The world of a football coach is never dull.
While preparing for Big Game, Wiggin and his coaching staff also
have to keep tabs on the high school players they are trying to
recruit. Heading Stanford's list is Menlo quarterback John Paye.
