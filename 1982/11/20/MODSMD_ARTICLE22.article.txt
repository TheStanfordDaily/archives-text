# Guest Greeks: Fruit vendor versus Berkeley streetperson
## 
### 
Guest Greek is a weekly feature
of the Cardinal Today in which
prominent members of the Stan
ford community make predictions
about the Stanford and Cal games.
Because this is the Big Game and
the two schools are playing each
other, Cardinal Today asked
members of both the Berkeley and
Stanford communities to make
predictions about the game.
This week's tandem of Guest
Greeks are Thomas Dallas, Stan
ford's famous fruit vendor, and
Moon Man, a certified Berkeley
street person.
Dallas, who has closely fol
lowed the Stanford team for
many years, predicts a Stanford
victory, although he refuses to
pick a score. "I don't want to
pick a score," he said, "but Stan
ford will win."
Asked why the Cardinal would
be victorious, Dallas is quick to
offer his reasons.
"Because I think they are a bet
ter team," he said. "Berkeley
plays like a bunch of potatoes."
Full of opinions, Dallas also
offers an assessment of Stan
ford's season.
"They should have won a lot of
other games," he said. "Like last
week, they were down by three
points and could not win. They

really make me mad."
Across the Bay, Cardinal To
day used one of its many foreign
contacts to interview a Berkeley
streetperson.
The Cardinal Today stringer,
noted for his catlike appearance,
walked up to the first street
person he met, a tall dark man
with an unshaven face and a
worn out jacket which was three
sizes too big. Asking the bum
who he thought would win the
Big Game, this out-of-touch indi
vidual replied, "Hey man, big
game, I don't know. I've never
been to Africa."
Realizing he had to pick his
streetpeople more carefully, our
reporter walked up to one of the
more flambouyant types. Calling
himself Moon Man, he was
dressed in some 20 odd pieces of
clothing with a styrofoam flota
tion device on his head. Wearing
a grey beard, this man claimed to
be a former Berkeley computer
science person.
"Let's see, Elway is hitting well
and White has a good field goal
percentage," the streetperson
told our reporter. "But (Gale)
Gilbert has a good on base aver
age and Lewis is good from the
line. But most importantly, (Joe)
Kapp is cuter than (Paul) Wig
gin. I think Cal will win 28-1."
