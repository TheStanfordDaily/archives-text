# Card bowl bid prize for a Big Game win
## 
### ADAM BERNS 
Conventional wisdom says
that records do not matter when
the Big Game roles around. Any
thing can happen. This year
should be no different, except
that Stanford took the advice a
bit early.
In a season which has included
upsets over then No. 2 Washing
ton and No. 11 Ohio State and
has also included losses to un
ranked San Jose State and Arizo
na, the Cardinal (5-5) will try to
salvage a winning record and a
bowl appearance with a win over
California.
The Bears, who own a surpris
ing 6-4 record, have won all the
games they should have won but
have not beaten a top 20 team.
Both Stanford and Cal are tied
with a 3-4 Pac-10 record.
While the statistics might point
to Stanford and its highly potent
offense, the Cardinal defense has
gone into hiding the last couple
of weeks. Stanford fans might
also remember two years ago en
tering the game singing "Reach
for the Peach." Heavy favorites,
they left the game with fruit in
their face and a humiliating loss.
Cardinal coach Paul Wiggin,
who played in the game himself
as a Stanford player, admits that
emotion has a lot to do with the
game.
"It's an emotional game," he
said. "There's a special feeling in
the air when its 'Cal time.' It's
one of the most competitive
challenges in sport that I've been
associated with.
"From the standpoint of peo
ple in th> game, it's the biggest
game of Lie year. Two great uni
versities have a lot to do with it.
It's a vital part of Bay Area ath
letics."
Cal running back John Tuggle

is even more concise. "The best
way that I can describe it is that it
is almost like the Bay Area Rose
Bowl," he said.
Before last week's contest with
UCLA, Wiggin predicted that it
would be a high scoring game,
but he offered no such wisdom
for today's game with the Bear.
"This is a different kind of
game," Wiggin said at a press
luncheon this week. "This is
more difficult to read. They've
had a fine year and their defense
has been the major part of their
success."
The game which matches
strength against strength, pits the
high-scoring Stanford offense
against the stingy Cal defense.
The Cardinal is third national
ly in passing offense with 298.1 *
yards a game. Stanford quarter
back John Elway is third in pass
ing efficiency and fourth in total
offense, and running back Vin
cent White leads the nation in
pass receptions with a 6.6 average
per game.
The Bears, who returned all of
their defensive starters from last
year, have been a good club de
fensively. Although they have
been trounced in a couple of
games, much of it was due to mis
takes by the offense.
"I think if you look at the Cal
team a year ago, it was a pretty
good defense," Wiggin said.
"The run and shoot kept the de
fense on the field for a long time.
"It's our long suit versus their
long suit," Wiggin succinctly
added. "As good as their defense
is, I feel that we can move the
football."
Defensively, Cal is led by line
backers Rich Dixon and Ron
Rivera.
"Ron Rivera is a prominent
player being pushed for All-

America," Wiggin said. Their de
fense can certainly apply a great
deal of pressure on any offense."
The big surprise on the Stan
ford offense has been their recent
success on the ground. Only
averaging 114.8 yards on the
ground for the season, the
Cardinal has ground out an aver
age of 179.3 yards in the last four
games.
The halfback tandem of sen
iors Vincent White and Mike
Dotterer will be playing the final
regular season collegiate game.
Dotterer has rushed for 503 yards
this season with a 4.9 average per
carry, while White has 439 yards
and has an impressive 5.4 aver
age.
The core of the Stanford of
fense, however, rests on the
shoulders of Elway. Last week in
a losing effort, Elway completed
29 of 39 passes for 352 yards and
two touchdowns in the fifth time
this season that he has thrown for
more than 300 yards. He admits,
however, that the inability of the
defense to stop people did put on
added pressure.
While Elway makes all the
headlines, a major reason for the
success of the offense has been
tight end Chris Dressel. He has
caught 42 passes for 548 yards
and two touchdowns and is a def
inite candidate for All-Con
ference honors.
While the Bear offense has not
exactly been a dominant force,
quarterback Gale Gilbert is tal
ented and Cal has a decent
ground game.
"I think you have a team that
does a good job of both running
and throwing," Wiggin said.
"Gilbert does a fine job of throw
ing the ball. They have very
simple basic reads."
Gilbert has thrown for 1507

yards and 10 touchdowns and
second string quarterback J.
Torchio, who has filled in for Gil
bert when he's been hurt, has 730
yards. Junior tight end David
Lewis has 50 receptions for 637
yards and leads the Bears in that
category.
Wiggin added that Stanford's

lack of success against the run
might also influence the Bears.
Running back Tuggle leads the
Cal ground assault with 441
yards and six touchdowns.

cern for Wiggin, but Wiggin
added that finding a problem and
coming up with a solution are
two different things.
"I think you deal with the
problem the best you can," Wig
gin said. "You try not to get them
to dwell on it. I think we need a
game of extreme emotion."
Last week UCLA had more
than 600 yards in total offense
and Wiggin wants to prevent a
similar feat against Cal.
"Somehow our defense is
going to have to re-establish the
confidence and belief it had in
itself during the earlier stages of
the season," Wiggin said. "Need
less to say, we had problems
against the Bruins, first in the
area of tackling, and second in
the area of containing the quar

terback (Tom Ramsey). We very
well could have the same type of
containment problem this Satur
day with (Gale) Gilbert, so we'll
be re-emphasizing that area as
the week progresses."
Injuries to cornerbacks Eric
Price and his backup Rodney
Gilmore have hurt the Cardinal
and backup safety Darrell
Grissum was forced to take over
at the corner. Price, however,
may be ready for the game.
"We feel that there is a good
possibility that he (Price) will be
ready," Wiggin said. "We do
have a depth problem there with
the injuries to Price."
Big Game Notes
Playing what could be his last
collegiate game, Elway desper
ately would like to play in a bowl
this year and a victory over Cal

would pretty much guarantee an
appearrance in the Hall of Fame
Bowl.
While Stanford running backs
White and.Dotterer have quietly
waited in the shadow of Cardinal
rushing great Darrin Nelson,
they have inched up on some
Stanford records. The two backs
rank third and fourth on the all
time touchdown list with 29 and
23 respectively, and have com
bined for 52 touchdowns be
tween them. White also ranks
third on the career rushing charts
with 1614 yards.

Big Game Notes
Playing what could be his last
collegiate game, Elway desper
ately would like to play in a bowl
this year and a victory over Cal

would pretty much guarantee an
appearrance in the Hall of Fame
Bowl.
While Stanford running backs
White and.Dotterer have quietly
waited in the shadow of Cardinal
rushing great Darrin Nelson,
they have inched up on some
Stanford records. The two backs
rank third and fourth on the all
time touchdown list with 29 and
23 respectively, and have com
bined for 52 touchdowns be
tween them. White also ranks
third on the career rushing charts
with 1614 yards.
Conventional wisdom says
that records do not matter when
the Big Game roles around. Any
thing can happen. This year
should be no different, except
that Stanford took the advice a
bit early.
In a season which has included
upsets over then No. 2 Washing
ton and No. 11 Ohio State and
has also included losses to un
ranked San Jose State and Arizo
na, the Cardinal (5-5) will try to
salvage a winning record and a
bowl appearance with a win over
California.
The Bears, who own a surpris
ing 6-4 record, have won all the
games they should have won but
have not beaten a top 20 team.
Both Stanford and Cal are tied
with a 3-4 Pac-10 record.
While the statistics might point
to Stanford and its highly potent
offense, the Cardinal defense has
gone into hiding the last couple
of weeks. Stanford fans might
also remember two years ago en
tering the game singing "Reach
for the Peach." Heavy favorites,
they left the game with fruit in
their face and a humiliating loss.
Cardinal coach Paul Wiggin,
who played in the game himself
as a Stanford player, admits that
emotion has a lot to do with the
game.
"It's an emotional game," he
said. "There's a special feeling in
the air when its 'Cal time.' It's
one of the most competitive
challenges in sport that I've been
associated with.
"From the standpoint of peo
ple in th> game, it's the biggest
game of Lie year. Two great uni
versities have a lot to do with it.
It's a vital part of Bay Area ath
letics."
Cal running back John Tuggle

is even more concise. "The best
way that I can describe it is that it
is almost like the Bay Area Rose
Bowl," he said.
Before last week's contest with
UCLA, Wiggin predicted that it
would be a high scoring game,
but he offered no such wisdom
for today's game with the Bear.
"This is a different kind of
game," Wiggin said at a press
luncheon this week. "This is
more difficult to read. They've
had a fine year and their defense
has been the major part of their
success."
The game which matches
strength against strength, pits the
high-scoring Stanford offense
against the stingy Cal defense.
The Cardinal is third national
ly in passing offense with 298.1 *
yards a game. Stanford quarter
back John Elway is third in pass
ing efficiency and fourth in total
offense, and running back Vin
cent White leads the nation in
pass receptions with a 6.6 average
per game.
The Bears, who returned all of
their defensive starters from last
year, have been a good club de
fensively. Although they have
been trounced in a couple of
games, much of it was due to mis
takes by the offense.
"I think if you look at the Cal
team a year ago, it was a pretty
good defense," Wiggin said.
"The run and shoot kept the de
fense on the field for a long time.
"It's our long suit versus their
long suit," Wiggin succinctly
added. "As good as their defense
is, I feel that we can move the
football."
Defensively, Cal is led by line
backers Rich Dixon and Ron
Rivera.
"Ron Rivera is a prominent
player being pushed for All-

America," Wiggin said. Their de
fense can certainly apply a great
deal of pressure on any offense."
The big surprise on the Stan
ford offense has been their recent
success on the ground. Only
averaging 114.8 yards on the
ground for the season, the
Cardinal has ground out an aver
age of 179.3 yards in the last four
games.
The halfback tandem of sen
iors Vincent White and Mike
Dotterer will be playing the final
regular season collegiate game.
Dotterer has rushed for 503 yards
this season with a 4.9 average per
carry, while White has 439 yards
and has an impressive 5.4 aver
age.
The core of the Stanford of
fense, however, rests on the
shoulders of Elway. Last week in
a losing effort, Elway completed
29 of 39 passes for 352 yards and
two touchdowns in the fifth time
this season that he has thrown for
more than 300 yards. He admits,
however, that the inability of the
defense to stop people did put on
added pressure.
While Elway makes all the
headlines, a major reason for the
success of the offense has been
tight end Chris Dressel. He has
caught 42 passes for 548 yards
and two touchdowns and is a def
inite candidate for All-Con
ference honors.
While the Bear offense has not
exactly been a dominant force,
quarterback Gale Gilbert is tal
ented and Cal has a decent
ground game.
"I think you have a team that
does a good job of both running
and throwing," Wiggin said.
"Gilbert does a fine job of throw
ing the ball. They have very
simple basic reads."
Gilbert has thrown for 1507

yards and 10 touchdowns and
second string quarterback J.
Torchio, who has filled in for Gil
bert when he's been hurt, has 730
yards. Junior tight end David
Lewis has 50 receptions for 637
yards and leads the Bears in that
category.
Wiggin added that Stanford's

lack of success against the run
might also influence the Bears.
Running back Tuggle leads the
Cal ground assault with 441
yards and six touchdowns.

cern for Wiggin, but Wiggin
added that finding a problem and
coming up with a solution are
two different things.
"I think you deal with the
problem the best you can," Wig
gin said. "You try not to get them
to dwell on it. I think we need a
game of extreme emotion."
Last week UCLA had more
than 600 yards in total offense
and Wiggin wants to prevent a
similar feat against Cal.
"Somehow our defense is
going to have to re-establish the
confidence and belief it had in
itself during the earlier stages of
the season," Wiggin said. "Need
less to say, we had problems
against the Bruins, first in the
area of tackling, and second in
the area of containing the quar

terback (Tom Ramsey). We very
well could have the same type of
containment problem this Satur
day with (Gale) Gilbert, so we'll
be re-emphasizing that area as

"I think you deal with the
problem the best you can," Wig
gin said. "You try not to get them
to dwell on it. I think we need a
game of extreme emotion."
Last week UCLA had more
than 600 yards in total offense
and Wiggin wants to prevent a
similar feat against Cal.
"Somehow our defense is
going to have to re-establish the
confidence and belief it had in
itself during the earlier stages of
the season," Wiggin said. "Need
less to say, we had problems
against the Bruins, first in the
area of tackling, and second in
the area of containing the quar

terback (Tom Ramsey). We very
well could have the same type of
containment problem this Satur
day with (Gale) Gilbert, so we'll
be re-emphasizing that area as
the week progresses."
Injuries to cornerbacks Eric
Price and his backup Rodney
Gilmore have hurt the Cardinal
and backup safety Darrell
Grissum was forced to take over
at the corner. Price, however,
may be ready for the game.
"We feel that there is a good
possibility that he (Price) will be
ready," Wiggin said. "We do
have a depth problem there with
the injuries to Price."
Big Game Notes
Playing what could be his last
collegiate game, Elway desper
ately would like to play in a bowl
this year and a victory over Cal

would pretty much guarantee an
appearrance in the Hall of Fame
Bowl.
While Stanford running backs
White and.Dotterer have quietly
waited in the shadow of Cardinal
rushing great Darrin Nelson,
they have inched up on some
Stanford records. The two backs
rank third and fourth on the all
time touchdown list with 29 and
23 respectively, and have com
bined for 52 touchdowns be
tween them. White also ranks
third on the career rushing charts
with 1614 yards.
Conventional wisdom says
that records do not matter when
the Big Game roles around. Any
thing can happen. This year
should be no different, except
that Stanford took the advice a
bit early.
In a season which has included
upsets over then No. 2 Washing
ton and No. 11 Ohio State and
has also included losses to un
ranked San Jose State and Arizo
na, the Cardinal (5-5) will try to
salvage a winning record and a
bowl appearance with a win over
California.
The Bears, who own a surpris
ing 6-4 record, have won all the
games they should have won but
have not beaten a top 20 team.
Both Stanford and Cal are tied
with a 3-4 Pac-10 record.
While the statistics might point
to Stanford and its highly potent
offense, the Cardinal defense has
gone into hiding the last couple
of weeks. Stanford fans might
also remember two years ago en
tering the game singing "Reach
for the Peach." Heavy favorites,
they left the game with fruit in
their face and a humiliating loss.
Cardinal coach Paul Wiggin,
who played in the game himself
as a Stanford player, admits that
emotion has a lot to do with the
game.
"It's an emotional game," he
said. "There's a special feeling in
the air when its 'Cal time.' It's
one of the most competitive
challenges in sport that I've been
associated with.
"From the standpoint of peo
ple in th> game, it's the biggest
game of Lie year. Two great uni
versities have a lot to do with it.
It's a vital part of Bay Area ath
letics."
Cal running back John Tuggle

is even more concise. "The best
way that I can describe it is that it
is almost like the Bay Area Rose
Bowl," he said.
Before last week's contest with
UCLA, Wiggin predicted that it
would be a high scoring game,
but he offered no such wisdom
for today's game with the Bear.
"This is a different kind of
game," Wiggin said at a press
luncheon this week. "This is
more difficult to read. They've
had a fine year and their defense
has been the major part of their
success."
The game which matches
strength against strength, pits the
high-scoring Stanford offense
against the stingy Cal defense.
The Cardinal is third national
ly in passing offense with 298.1 *
yards a game. Stanford quarter
back John Elway is third in pass
ing efficiency and fourth in total
offense, and running back Vin
cent White leads the nation in
pass receptions with a 6.6 average
per game.
The Bears, who returned all of
their defensive starters from last
year, have been a good club de
fensively. Although they have
been trounced in a couple of
games, much of it was due to mis
takes by the offense.
"I think if you look at the Cal
team a year ago, it was a pretty
good defense," Wiggin said.
"The run and shoot kept the de
fense on the field for a long time.
"It's our long suit versus their
long suit," Wiggin succinctly
added. "As good as their defense
is, I feel that we can move the
football."
Defensively, Cal is led by line
backers Rich Dixon and Ron
Rivera.
"Ron Rivera is a prominent
player being pushed for All-

America," Wiggin said. Their de
fense can certainly apply a great
deal of pressure on any offense."
The big surprise on the Stan
ford offense has been their recent
success on the ground. Only
averaging 114.8 yards on the
ground for the season, the
Cardinal has ground out an aver
age of 179.3 yards in the last four
games.
The halfback tandem of sen
iors Vincent White and Mike
Dotterer will be playing the final
regular season collegiate game.
Dotterer has rushed for 503 yards
this season with a 4.9 average per
carry, while White has 439 yards
and has an impressive 5.4 aver
age.
The core of the Stanford of
fense, however, rests on the
shoulders of Elway. Last week in
a losing effort, Elway completed
29 of 39 passes for 352 yards and
two touchdowns in the fifth time
this season that he has thrown for
more than 300 yards. He admits,
however, that the inability of the
defense to stop people did put on
added pressure.
While Elway makes all the
headlines, a major reason for the
success of the offense has been
tight end Chris Dressel. He has
caught 42 passes for 548 yards
and two touchdowns and is a def
inite candidate for All-Con
ference honors.
While the Bear offense has not
exactly been a dominant force,
quarterback Gale Gilbert is tal
ented and Cal has a decent
ground game.
"I think you have a team that
does a good job of both running
and throwing," Wiggin said.
"Gilbert does a fine job of throw
ing the ball. They have very
simple basic reads."
Gilbert has thrown for 1507

yards and 10 touchdowns and
second string quarterback J.
Torchio, who has filled in for Gil
bert when he's been hurt, has 730
yards. Junior tight end David
Lewis has 50 receptions for 637
yards and leads the Bears in that
category.
Wiggin added that Stanford's

lack of success against the run
might also influence the Bears.
Running back Tuggle leads the
Cal ground assault with 441
yards and six touchdowns.
Stanford's faltering defense
has been a source of great con-
