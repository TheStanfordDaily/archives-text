# Bowl picture remains hazy for weekend games
## 
### DAVE DUTCHER 
The post-season bowl situ
ation, with its usual widespread
speculation beforehand, depends
largely on the outcome of several
key games Saturday.
The 5-5 Stanford Cardinal,
with a Big Game win over
archrival California Saturday,
will likely receive and accept a
bid from the Hall of Fame Bowl
committee for a meeting with
Vanderbilt, currently 6-3, De
cember 31. Like the Cardinal,
many other teams nationwide are
in must-win situations Saturday
to insure a bowl appearance.
For starters, the Grandaddy of
the bowls, the Rose Bowl, has
Michigan assured as one team.
But the Wolverines' opponent,
the Pac-10 conference champion,
has not vet been determined.
Michigan, which won the Big-10
title, will face Washington in
Pasadena Jan. 1 if the two-time
defending Pac-10 champion
Huskies defeat rival Washington
State Saturday.
But that is only the beginning

of the possibilities, or "ifs."
If Washington (9-1) loses to
Washington State (2-7-1), Arizo
na State (9-1) would take the
Pac-10 title with a win over Ari
zona on Nov. 27.
The nation's No. 1 ranked
team, Georgia (10-0), wrapped
up the Southeastern Conference
title with a tough 19-14 win over
Auburn Saturday and thus as
sured itself of a spot in the Sugar
Bowl. The Bulldogs' opponent
will most likely be Penn State,
which opposes Pittsburgh on
Nov. 26.
It is Pittsburgh that could be in
any one of four major bowl
games. The Panthers, 8-1, may
draw bids from the Orange, Cot
ton, Fiesta and Sugar Bowls,
with the last being the least likely
of possibilities.
The Orange Bowl will have the
Big Eight champion as one team.
That title will also be settled Nov.
26 when Oklahoma and Nebras
ka collide. The Big Eight win
ner's opponent will either be
Florida State or, if the Seminoles

beat Louisiana State this Satur
day, Pittsburgh or Notre Dame.
In the Cotton Bowl, which
traditionally features the
Southwest Conference cham
pion, the matchup will be either
Southern Methodist University
(10-0, 7-0) or Arkansas (8-1,5-1)
against Pittsburgh or the Okla
homa-Nebraska loser. SMU and
Arkansas will meet to decide the
SWC title Saturday.
Tempe, Arizona's Fiesta Bowl
could feature the team that plays
its home games there Arizona
State. Should Washington beat
Washington State Saturday, the
Sun Devils would stay home in
Tempe and face either the SMU-
Arkansas loser or, once again,
Pittsburgh.
There are many fine teams,
with records to match, compet
ing for berths in bowls other than
Jan. l's five major contests.
The Sun Bowl, in El Paso, Tex
as, could be featuring one of the
state's own, the University of
Texas. The Longhorns, 6-2 over
all, would likely face 8-2 inde

pendent West Virginia.
UCLA, which defeated the
Stanford 38-35 in the Rose Bowl
Saturday, will receive, at least, an
invitation to play in the Aloha
Bowl in Hawaii. The Bruins,
8-1-1 overall, feature an exciting
offense. A win over cross-city ri
val USC, whom they oppose Sat
urday, would do much to boost
the Bruin's pre-bowl confidence.
UCLA's opponent looks to be
Maryland (7-3) if the Terapins
defeat Virginia tomorrow.
Notre Dame, which is being
considered with the Oklahoma-
Nebraska winner, Pittsburgh,
and Florida State for the Orange
Bowl, could also go to the Gator
Bowl, where it could be matched
up with the Oklahoma-Nebraska
loser.
The Liberty Bowl looks to fea
ture two exciting teams that were
supposed to contend for league
titles but wound up playing sup
porting roles in their respective
conference races. A good possi
bility here is Illinois, fourth place
in the Big-10, meeting Alabama,

currently holding the fourth posi
tion in the SEC. The Illini is 7-4
and the Crimson Tide 7-3.
For the Tangerine Bowl,
Auburn is a favorite and could
face Boston College, or Florida
State.. Clemson was in con
sideration until it was announced
that NCAA sanctions prohibit
them from playing in a bowl this
year.
The Peach Bowl will probably
feature Kelvin Bryant and North
Carolina's strong running game
and the passing attack of Florida.
In San Diego's Floliday Bowl,
five-time defending Western Ath
letic Conference champion
Brigham Young will make its
sixth straight appearance, bar
ring a loss to Utah Saturday.
BYU's opponent will be either
Arizona, with a 5-3-1 record, or
Tennessee, also 5-3-1.
Houston's Bluebonnet Bowl
will likely showcase the South
eastern Conference's Louisiana
State University Tigers against
Ohio State, 7-3 overall and run-
