The end always arrives unex
pectedly, no matter how well you
anticipate it. You're there sud
denly, and it's all behind you.
Nostalgia sets in. Reminiscing.
Wistfulness. Unforgettable mo
ments, and one's easily forgotten,
(irandma thrives on it.
Outside linebacker Kevin
Bates, a fifth-year Senior, has
had his fill of fond memories here
at the Harm, and for him the 1982
football campaign will provide
many more glorious recollec
tions.
Bates has also suffered
through some "easily forgotten"
hardship during his Stanford ca
reer. He's been hampered by
more than his share of physical
inflictions, notablv a severe lower
back injury received at Boston
College early in 1980. The re
cuperation process extended into
last fall, forcing him to fill a re
serve role, despite which he still
managed 31 tackles. As he tells it,
"It was incredibly frustrating.
Aside from the physical prob

lems, I think it's harder to deal
with the mental part. I was
watching practice all the time
from the sideline, which was real
ly hard to adjust too."
Sometimes good comes from
bad, and there were one or two
positive notes for Bates in the
midst of a dire circumstance.
Kevin points out that "getting
hurt did one thing for me. It
made me damn glad that I came
here. I realized how valuable the
other half of Stanford is. For a
while there, we weren't sure if I
was going to plav again. If I'd
been at Alabama or some other
school, I could have been in big
trouble."
An unforeseen benefit derived
from the lost playing time is the
chance it gave him to play with
this year's team, a development
he greatly appreciates judging by
the enthusiasm with which he at
taches a string of superlatives to
any discussion of his teammates.
"I'm doing prettv well this year,
personally," he observed, "but
the most important thing is the

opportunity I had to come back.
In my five years, this is the
closest-knit team, without a
doubt. Winning's great, but we
could go 0-1 I, and it would still
be worthwhile."
"Intangibles" are the favorite
rationalization of every sucker
with a football pool and limited
understanding of the game, but
they are a very apparent element
of Stanford's team, and they are
very real to Kevin Bates.
"The team's verv close, and
has a lot of'character,"' he said.
"It's something vou have to be
around to understand. The Ohio
State game was a perfect exam
ple. Our attitude was stick it out,
slick it out, and good things will
happen."
Bates points to the coaches as
being integral to that closeness.
Head Coach Paul Wiggin is not
in the aloof-figurehead, Bear
Bryant mold, according to
Kevin. "Everyone on the team
feels comfortable around Coach
Wiggin. We feel like we can talk
to the entire coaching staff. They

are good friends, and we have a
lot of respect for them. It's not a
respect out of fear, like Bryant,
but a respect out of love."
Will the intangibles work for
the Cardinal this weekend?
"Emotion is always a big part of
Big Game," Bates said. "This
team's unique. If you visited
Michigan or Notre Dame, you'd
be able to walk up and tell he's a
starter, he's a starter, and he's
fifth string. Here you can't tell
them apart. It's helped us a lot
and pulled us through some

tough times. And it'll mean
something this weekend."
Beyond the usual intensity as
sociated with Saturday's brag
ging rights battle, there will be
two other emotional factors at
work for Stanford this weekend.
First, the defense feels "inside,
that we have something to
prove," Bates said. "The offense
has been playing well, and after
UCLA it felt like half an effort.
Cal talks a lot, and when some
one challenges your pride, and
toughness. . ."
