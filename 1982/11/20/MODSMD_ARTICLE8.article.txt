# Who will be next in line to replace...
## 
### MARK ZEIGLER 
It's easy to overlook Steve Cot
trell.
Standing just 5-foot-IO and
weighing in at 185 pounds, "Cot"
does not fit the build of your typi
cal Stanford quarterback. He
wasn't even recruited as a quar
terback; in fact, he wasn't even
recruited for football at all, but
came to the Farm on a baseball
scholarship.
In all probability, however,
Cardinal fans will have to lower
their binoculars an inch or two
next season, as Cottrell is the next
in line to sit on the throne oc
cupied by Stanford quarter
backs.
But Cottrell won't just inherit
the job. He comes complete with
a resume, though it is not long. A
graduate of Notre Dame High in
Northridge, Calif., he has never
started a football game on the
Farm. Nonetheless, he has
played the role of John Elway's
understudy brilliantly.
Last year, he replaced a lame
Elwav in the second quarter
against Arizona State and passed
for 311 yards while completing 21
of 34 attempts. On the year,
"Cot" was 26 of 42 (61.9*) for
390 yards, two touchdowns and

just one interception. He played
in four games, logging 48
minutes.
In 1982, Cottrell has hit on a
third of his nine passes for 25
yards, including a 12 yard TD
toss. Last week in a losing effort
against UCLA, he filled in on
short notice for Elwav in fourth
quarter with the ball sitting on
the Bruins' 1 I yard-line and the
Card losing 31 -20. Two plays lat
er, Stanford was in the end zone
and trailing UCLA bv only four
points.
No one probably has more
confidence in "Cot" than Jim
Fassel, the Card's offensive coor
dinator and quarterback coach.
When asked who would replace
Elwav, he replied without a mo
ment's hesitation, "Steve Cot
trell.
"I think he has proven himself
in game situations," Fassel said.
"He can read defenses and react
quickly enough that it (his
height) isn't inuch of a factor."
Incumbent QB Elway also
confides in Cottrell. "As of now,
I think it (mv replacement) will
be Steve Cottrell," he said. "He's
a good athlete, has a good arm
and knows the offense well."
Though Cottrell definitely has

the skills to perform on the foot
ball field, he also has skills ap
plicable to the baseball diamond.
In 1981, the right-handed pitcher
had a 7-3 record and a 4.39
earned run average in 108 innings
pictched. Last season, he was 2-1
with a 5.50 ERA on a Cardinal
team that reached the NCAA
College World Series.
Fassel noted that Cottrell
would probably have to choose

between baseball and football
during spring football practice.
"He's a pitcher," Fassel said.
"How that affects his arm, I
don't know. He's not like John
Elwav, an outfielder, who could
go out and hit and shag a few
balls.
"At the conclusion of the
(football) season, we will sit
down and fit the pieces of the
puzzle together," he continued,

reiterating that Cottrell's atten
dance at spring practice is man
datory if he intends to have the
starting job in 1983.
Waiting in the wings should he
chose otherwise are sophomores
Greg Topp, Fred Buckley and
junior Ed St. Geme, ranked in
that order on the depth charts be
hind Cottrell and Elway.

NEXT IN LINE: Junior quarterback Steve Cottrell, shown throwing an important fourth quarter
touchdown pass against USC, will probably be John Elway's replacement next year. Sophomore
Greg Topp, who played a series against Oregon State, may also challenge for the job.
Though rumors have
circulated that Buckley, the No. I

prep OB in the nation two years
ago, would usurp Cottrell and
Topp in spring ball andstart next
fall, they are unfounded, accord

ing to Fassel.
"Right now, I don't see him as
the heir apparent. Technically,
he's a year behind," Fassel said,
refering to Buckley's bout with
mononucleosis that sidelined
him in 1981. As a result, the 6-2,
190 pounder has three years of
elgibilitv remaining on the Farm
after this campaign.
Looking even further into the
future, head coach Paul Wiggin
and his staff are "heavily" re
cruiting local prep star John
Pave, who is thought to have the
abilitv of a John Elwav.

Incumbent QB Elway also
confides in Cottrell. "As of now,
I think it (mv replacement) will
be Steve Cottrell," he said. "He's
a good athlete, has a good arm
and knows the offense well."
Though Cottrell definitely has

the skills to perform on the foot
ball field, he also has skills ap
plicable to the baseball diamond.
In 1981, the right-handed pitcher
had a 7-3 record and a 4.39
earned run average in 108 innings
pictched. Last season, he was 2-1
with a 5.50 ERA on a Cardinal
team that reached the NCAA
College World Series.
Fassel noted that Cottrell
would probably have to choose

between baseball and football
during spring football practice.
"He's a pitcher," Fassel said.
"How that affects his arm, I
don't know. He's not like John
Elwav, an outfielder, who could
go out and hit and shag a few
balls.
"At the conclusion of the
(football) season, we will sit
down and fit the pieces of the
puzzle together," he continued,

reiterating that Cottrell's atten
dance at spring practice is man
datory if he intends to have the
starting job in 1983.
Waiting in the wings should he
chose otherwise are sophomores
Greg Topp, Fred Buckley and
junior Ed St. Geme, ranked in
that order on the depth charts be
hind Cottrell and Elway.

NEXT IN LINE: Junior quarterback Steve Cottrell, shown throwing an important fourth quarter
touchdown pass against USC, will probably be John Elway's replacement next year. Sophomore
Greg Topp, who played a series against Oregon State, may also challenge for the job.
Though rumors have
circulated that Buckley, the No. I

prep OB in the nation two years
ago, would usurp Cottrell and
Topp in spring ball andstart next
fall, they are unfounded, accord

ing to Fassel.
"Right now, I don't see him as
the heir apparent. Technically,
he's a year behind," Fassel said,
refering to Buckley's bout with
mononucleosis that sidelined
him in 1981. As a result, the 6-2,
190 pounder has three years of
elgibilitv remaining on the Farm
after this campaign.
Looking even further into the
future, head coach Paul Wiggin
and his staff are "heavily" re
cruiting local prep star John
Pave, who is thought to have the
abilitv of a John Elwav.
It's easy to overlook Steve Cot
trell.
Standing just 5-foot-IO and
weighing in at 185 pounds, "Cot"
does not fit the build of your typi
cal Stanford quarterback. He
wasn't even recruited as a quar
terback; in fact, he wasn't even
recruited for football at all, but
came to the Farm on a baseball
scholarship.
In all probability, however,
Cardinal fans will have to lower
their binoculars an inch or two
next season, as Cottrell is the next
in line to sit on the throne oc
cupied by Stanford quarter
backs.
But Cottrell won't just inherit
the job. He comes complete with
a resume, though it is not long. A
graduate of Notre Dame High in
Northridge, Calif., he has never
started a football game on the
Farm. Nonetheless, he has
played the role of John Elway's
understudy brilliantly.
Last year, he replaced a lame
Elwav in the second quarter
against Arizona State and passed
for 311 yards while completing 21
of 34 attempts. On the year,
"Cot" was 26 of 42 (61.9*) for
390 yards, two touchdowns and

just one interception. He played
in four games, logging 48
minutes.
In 1982, Cottrell has hit on a
third of his nine passes for 25
yards, including a 12 yard TD
toss. Last week in a losing effort
against UCLA, he filled in on
short notice for Elwav in fourth
quarter with the ball sitting on
the Bruins' 1 I yard-line and the
Card losing 31 -20. Two plays lat
er, Stanford was in the end zone
and trailing UCLA bv only four
points.
No one probably has more
confidence in "Cot" than Jim
Fassel, the Card's offensive coor
dinator and quarterback coach.
When asked who would replace
Elwav, he replied without a mo
ment's hesitation, "Steve Cot
trell.
"I think he has proven himself
in game situations," Fassel said.
"He can read defenses and react
quickly enough that it (his
height) isn't inuch of a factor."
