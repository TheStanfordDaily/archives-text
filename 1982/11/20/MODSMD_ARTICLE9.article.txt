# ... the man who holds all the records?

### STEPHEN STRENG 
The headline in the February
22, 1979 edition of the Stanford
Daily read "Cards sign nation's
No. 1 high school quarterback,"
thus beginning the Elway Era in
Stanford football. This weekend
in the most important, emotional
game of the season, appropriate
ly enough, the era of John Elway
will come to a close.
The era of John Elway saw the
Stanford quarterback become
one of the finest, most prolific
quarterbacks in college football
history. The NCAA, Pac-10 and
Stanford record books are filled
with the name of John Elway.
Elwav holds NCAA career rec
ords for most passes completed,
most seasons gaining 2500 yards
or more total offense, and most
games passing 200 yards or more.
Also, Elwav holds Pac-10 career
records in most plays total of
fense, most yards total offense,
most touchdowns responsible for
passing and rushing, most touch
downs responsible for passing,
most passes attempted, most
passes completed, most yards
gained and lowest percentage of
passes intercepted. Ancf, barring
a total disaster Saturday, Elway
will rank first or second (mostly
first) in every Stanford passing
statistic ever kept.
The superlatives from the ex
perts and his peers have been fall
ing at Elwav's feet since he was
named to every high school All-
America team his senior year at
Granada Hills High School in
Los Angeles. Stanford head
coach Paul Wiggin recalls having
heard about Elwav while he was
still coaching in the professional
ranks. Wiggin remembers that at
the Pro Bowl in Hawaii "ev
eryone had talked about his
arm."
Elwav has been termed either
the "best quarterback ever" or
"the premier college passer ever"
by none other than Darryl Rog
ers, ASU head coach, Joe
Avezzano, Oregon State head
coach, John Robinson, USC

head coach, Frank Broyles,
ABC-TV commentator and
former Arkansas head coach,
and Bill Walsh, head coach of the
World Champion San Fransisco
49ers. Just a few weeks ago Gil
Brandt, vice president of the Dal
las Cowboys, said: "If we already
had Danny White, Dan Fouts
and Joe Montana, and we had
the first pick in the draft, I'd still
take John Elway."
Elwav's main spokesman con
tinues to be Wiggen, though.
"It's been a real treat," said Wig
gen on having Elway the last
three years, "mostly because of
the person that he is. He's been a
tremendous, positive influence."
Wiggin commented that when
he first arrived at Stanford, "my
first surprise was his ability to
run. I pictured him more as a
pure drop-back passer."
Wiggin probably illustrated
how far Elwav is above everyone
else when he said: "We wonder
what's wrong with John when he
only throws for 250 yards, when
any quarterback in America
would love that kind of day."
Some of the days that Elway
has had previously existed only in
voung quarterback's dreams,
such as the time during the 1980
USC game when he was forced to
run out of the pocket and threw a
75 yard touchdown pass
diagonally across the field to
wide receiver Kenny Margerum
while falling under pressure from
the Trojan defense.
In addition, there is every
coach's example of a perfect
heads-up play when Elwav
"fumbled" the ball out of bounds
for a first down against Washing
ton last year.
After several uniquely amaz
ing performances, Elway was
named The Associated Press
Back of the Week twice, the
Sports Illustrated Offensive
Player of the Week twice, the
ABC player of the game four
times, the C BS player of the game
twice, and the Pac-10 player of
the week seven times. Elway was

also named the Pac-10 player of
the year in 1980 and in the same
year was named a first team All-
America bv the Sporting News.
This year Elwav should be named
to almost every All-America
team even though his chances for
the Heisman have been hurt by
the Cardinal's 5-5 record.
For all the amazing talent,
though, there is still the college
kid out to have a good time and
trying to put off his entrance into
the real world.
"I'd like to remain a kid as
long as 1 can," said Elway at a
pre-Big Game press luncheon," 1
enjoy being a college student. 1
want to relax and have fun.
"I'm still in college so I still
consider myself a kid," Elway
continued, "In college you can
get awav with a lot that you oth
erwise couldn't."
When the season is over Elway
said that he would "like coming
home from my 11 o'clock class
and watch All My Children and
not have to be anyplace later on."
Elwav also said that his major
worry after the season would be
the "beermeister up at the
house." (He is a member of the
Delta fraternity.)
Elwav said that he has enjoved
his time at Stanford. "There are a
lot of pleasant memories at Stan
ford," Elway said. "Anytime you
come to Stanford you're a win
ner. Stanford is going to help me
become a complete person.
"If 1 had it all to do over again,
I'd come here," said Elway ex
pressing no regret on his decision
to attend Stanford. "1 could've
gone to USC and pitched to
Charles White and Marcus Al
len, and worn my rings (from the
Rose Bowl), but it wouldn't have
been any fun. I enjoy passing the
football."
Elway expressed confidence
about Big Game. "There's no
doubt in my mind we'll come out
110 percent ready to play,"
Elway said. He also looked for
ward to accomplishing one of his
football goals. "I've always

wanted to pass over 3000 yards
(he presently has 2912), and it
looks that with a half-way decent
day I might be able to go over
that barrier."
The next barrier that Elway
has is graduation, but he said that
he would definitely graduate this
spring with a degree in econom
ics.
But with the exception of a
bowl game, the upcoming Cal
game will be the last time that

Elway will wear a Cardinal uni
form. And, if Elway decides to
choose the pinstripes of the Yan
kees over the jersey of whichever
NFL team drafts him in the first
round, this may be the last time
anybody gets to witness the
prowess of Elway passing the
football. But one thing is for sure,
the Era of Elway will come to an
end at the Farm, but it will be
fondly remembered by all who
were there.

END OF AN ERA: The John Elway chapter closes tomorrow

the game.

only throws for 250 yards, when
any quarterback in America
would love that kind of day."
Some of the days that Elway
has had previously existed only in
voung quarterback's dreams,
such as the time during the 1980
USC game when he was forced to
run out of the pocket and threw a
75 yard touchdown pass
diagonally across the field to
wide receiver Kenny Margerum
while falling under pressure from
the Trojan defense.
In addition, there is every
coach's example of a perfect
heads-up play when Elwav
"fumbled" the ball out of bounds
for a first down against Washing
ton last year.
After several uniquely amaz
ing performances, Elway was
named The Associated Press
Back of the Week twice, the
Sports Illustrated Offensive
Player of the Week twice, the
ABC player of the game four
times, the C BS player of the game
twice, and the Pac-10 player of
the week seven times. Elway was

also named the Pac-10 player of
the year in 1980 and in the same
year was named a first team All-
America bv the Sporting News.
This year Elwav should be named
to almost every All-America
team even though his chances for
the Heisman have been hurt by
the Cardinal's 5-5 record.
For all the amazing talent,
though, there is still the college
kid out to have a good time and
trying to put off his entrance into
the real world.
"I'd like to remain a kid as
long as 1 can," said Elway at a
pre-Big Game press luncheon," 1
enjoy being a college student. 1
want to relax and have fun.
"I'm still in college so I still
consider myself a kid," Elway
continued, "In college you can
get awav with a lot that you oth
erwise couldn't."
When the season is over Elway
said that he would "like coming
home from my 11 o'clock class
and watch All My Children and
not have to be anyplace later on."
Elwav also said that his major
worry after the season would be
the "beermeister up at the
house." (He is a member of the
Delta fraternity.)
Elwav said that he has enjoved
his time at Stanford. "There are a
lot of pleasant memories at Stan
ford," Elway said. "Anytime you
come to Stanford you're a win
ner. Stanford is going to help me
become a complete person.
"If 1 had it all to do over again,
I'd come here," said Elway ex
pressing no regret on his decision
to attend Stanford. "1 could've
gone to USC and pitched to
Charles White and Marcus Al
len, and worn my rings (from the
Rose Bowl), but it wouldn't have
been any fun. I enjoy passing the
football."
Elway expressed confidence
about Big Game. "There's no
doubt in my mind we'll come out
110 percent ready to play,"
Elway said. He also looked for
ward to accomplishing one of his
football goals. "I've always

wanted to pass over 3000 yards
(he presently has 2912), and it
looks that with a half-way decent
day I might be able to go over
that barrier."
The next barrier that Elway
has is graduation, but he said that
he would definitely graduate this
spring with a degree in econom
ics.
But with the exception of a
bowl game, the upcoming Cal
game will be the last time that

Elway will wear a Cardinal uni
form. And, if Elway decides to
choose the pinstripes of the Yan
kees over the jersey of whichever
NFL team drafts him in the first
round, this may be the last time
anybody gets to witness the
prowess of Elway passing the
football. But one thing is for sure,
the Era of Elway will come to an
end at the Farm, but it will be
fondly remembered by all who
were there.

END OF AN ERA: The John Elway chapter closes tomorrow
and with it virtually every Stanford passing record. In a school
noted for its fine quarterbacks, Elway may be the best to ever play
the game.
The headline in the February
22, 1979 edition of the Stanford
Daily read "Cards sign nation's
No. 1 high school quarterback,"
thus beginning the Elway Era in
Stanford football. This weekend
in the most important, emotional
game of the season, appropriate
ly enough, the era of John Elway
will come to a close.
The era of John Elway saw the
Stanford quarterback become
one of the finest, most prolific
quarterbacks in college football
history. The NCAA, Pac-10 and
Stanford record books are filled
with the name of John Elway.
Elwav holds NCAA career rec
ords for most passes completed,
most seasons gaining 2500 yards
or more total offense, and most
games passing 200 yards or more.
Also, Elwav holds Pac-10 career
records in most plays total of
fense, most yards total offense,
most touchdowns responsible for
passing and rushing, most touch
downs responsible for passing,
most passes attempted, most
passes completed, most yards
gained and lowest percentage of
passes intercepted. Ancf, barring
a total disaster Saturday, Elway
will rank first or second (mostly
first) in every Stanford passing
statistic ever kept.
The superlatives from the ex
perts and his peers have been fall
ing at Elwav's feet since he was
named to every high school All-
America team his senior year at
Granada Hills High School in
Los Angeles. Stanford head
coach Paul Wiggin recalls having
heard about Elwav while he was
still coaching in the professional
ranks. Wiggin remembers that at
the Pro Bowl in Hawaii "ev
eryone had talked about his
arm."
Elwav has been termed either
the "best quarterback ever" or
"the premier college passer ever"
by none other than Darryl Rog
ers, ASU head coach, Joe
Avezzano, Oregon State head
coach, John Robinson, USC

head coach, Frank Broyles,
ABC-TV commentator and
former Arkansas head coach,
and Bill Walsh, head coach of the
World Champion San Fransisco
49ers. Just a few weeks ago Gil
Brandt, vice president of the Dal
las Cowboys, said: "If we already
had Danny White, Dan Fouts
and Joe Montana, and we had
the first pick in the draft, I'd still
take John Elway."
Elwav's main spokesman con
tinues to be Wiggen, though.
"It's been a real treat," said Wig
gen on having Elway the last
three years, "mostly because of
the person that he is. He's been a
tremendous, positive influence."
Wiggin commented that when
he first arrived at Stanford, "my
first surprise was his ability to
run. I pictured him more as a
pure drop-back passer."
Wiggin probably illustrated
how far Elwav is above everyone
else when he said: "We wonder
what's wrong with John when he
only throws for 250 yards, when
any quarterback in America
would love that kind of day."

doubt in my mind we'll come out
110 percent ready to play,"
Elway said. He also looked for
ward to accomplishing one of his
football goals. "I've always

wanted to pass over 3000 yards
(he presently has 2912), and it
looks that with a half-way decent
day I might be able to go over
that barrier."
The next barrier that Elway
has is graduation, but he said that
he would definitely graduate this
spring with a degree in econom
ics.
But with the exception of a
bowl game, the upcoming Cal
game will be the last time that

Elway will wear a Cardinal uni
form. And, if Elway decides to
choose the pinstripes of the Yan
kees over the jersey of whichever
NFL team drafts him in the first
round, this may be the last time
anybody gets to witness the
prowess of Elway passing the
football. But one thing is for sure,
the Era of Elway will come to an
end at the Farm, but it will be
fondly remembered by all who
were there.

END OF AN ERA: The John Elway chapter closes tomorrow
and with it virtually every Stanford passing record. In a school
noted for its fine quarterbacks, Elway may be the best to ever play
the game.
