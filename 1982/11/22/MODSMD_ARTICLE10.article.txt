## Profile: Prof. Hubert Marshall, the reigning king of Poli Sci 1 
### BOB COHN 
A student once called him the
"Johnny Carson of Political Sci
ence" because of his smooth, en
gaging lecturing stvle and ability
to captivate his audience.
Yet Hubert Marshall looks
more like a staid librarian than a
late night television star. Dressed
in neatlv-creased, cuffed baggy
pants, a dull-colored tie and a
green tweed sportcoat, Marshall
appears unassuming in his role
teaching one of Stanford's most
popular courses.
Marshall has been teaching
Political Science I for almost 30
years, and vet he claims he never

'Stanford students
mainly don't argue
back'

Rets bored. "I've had colleagues
who say they would never teach a
course more than three times be
cause they find it boring, but I
just think that cheats students be
cause you have to teach a course
three times before you really get
on top of it. The first time
through you're always making
mistakes."
Students, too, rarely find the
course boring. "He's entertain
ing," one said. "He keeps the
class moving at a fast pace and he
throws in some humor to provide
a good contrast."
Justin Halpern, administrative
assistant for the class and a
former teaching assistant for the
course, said, "I think part of it

(the success of the class) is Pro
fessor Marshall's lecturing style
and delivery. He is the best lec
turer that I have ever worked
with."
The course addresses the
theme of power, competition and
poverty in America. Marshall's
intense and real interest in these
issues makes it clear that he is a
man who is deeply concerned
about the American society and
the young people who will soon
lead it.
"What makes the course so
good is Marshall's obvious love
for it," said one student. "He
cares about the issues and the stu
dents."
Leaning back in his chair, his
arms folded and relaxed behind
his head, Marshall answers ques
tions and organizes his thoughts
in much the same manner as he
lectures. While he does not fill up
two chalkboards with a detailed
outline, as he does before each
class, he itemizes his points and
chooses his words deliberately,
indicating that he knows exactly
what he wahts to say and how to
say it. Marshall knows the score
on a lot of things, and he is not
afraid to voice his opinion.
Characterizing himself as left
leaning on the political spectrum,
Marshall is outspoken on many
issues. "On domestic policy, I'm
a mild liberal — more conserva
tive that I was 10 vears ago," he
said. On foreign policy questions,
"I'm more nearly a liberal -f —
more a critic of the government."

Over a decade ago he spoke out
against the draft, against the
Vietnam War and in favor of im
peaching former President Rich
ard Nixon.
Today he is a proponent of
equal rights and a nuclear arms
freeze. He has written articles dis
couraging off-campus housing
discrimination, led a rally dem
onstration against President
Johnson's involvement in South
east Asia, and protested military
recruitment on campus.
All this from a man who seems
so shv and softspoken that it's
hard to believe he would partici
pate in a political demonstration,
much less lead one. "You look at
his ties," one student said, "and
that sums up what his personality
should be. He dresses like a
staunch conservative — it's hard
to believe he's a liberal."
And yet Marshall maintains,
"I'm not a big time activist by
any manner of means."
He does, however, have what
he terms "good citizenship." "If
students want to hear what I've
got to say, it seems to me I've got
a citizen's obligation to tell them.
According to friends his interest
in young people and his willing
ness to speak out make him a
logical choice to lead to lead
dorm discussion groups. During
the recent Fate of the Earth
Week, Marshall spoke on nucle
ar issues at three different dorms,
and his pro-choice abortion
views have yet to be publicly
aired.

would win (a new
election, but)...

Marshall's wife Rachelle and
son Jonathan also have their own
political leanings, even more so
than Marshall himself. Rachelle
is a frequent contributor to the
opinions page of the Daily and
other local newspapers and is
currently immersed iri the Mid
east crisis. Jonathan is a declared
Libertarian who works as an edi
torial writer for the San Jose
Mercury.

zines, they feed me information.

and I make up mv own mind. All
of this doesn't affect me except
that it's an enormous help," he
said.
While Marshall definitely has
his own political views, he tries to
stifle, or at least tame these per
sonal opinions when teaching.
He insists, however, that it is im
possible to teach a social science
course without some bias, and he
admits that the bias in his class is
"slightly liberal."
"I think his political bias
helps," said one sophomore po
litical science student. "It gives
you the perspective of someone
who knows. He doesn't come
right out and say what's right or
wrong, but you can at least com
pare your views to his."
Halpern added that "although
he (Marshall), makes no secret of
his views, the wav he treats the is
sues and chooses the readings"
serves to counteract any lecturing
bias.
With his parted, puffy, salt
and-pepper hair, his horn
rimmed glasses and his tattered
appointment book peeking out
of his outside breast pocket, ac
cording to one student, "ties that
come in two colors — blah brown
and olive dr ib," Marshall hardly
seems capable of causing erup
tions of laughter among a class of
sleepy students.
'You don't expect it from him
— he looks like a dry person and
vet he's not," one student com
mented.
In a recent class in which the
professor was discussing the
growing rate of teenage pregnan
cies, Marshall noted: "About 25
percent of all girls under 19 get
pregnant. I look out on a class
like this and think vou are falling
behind."
Another time Marshall got his
laugh at the expense of Nixon, a
frequent butt ofjokesin theclass.
He related a time when Nixon
had a disagreement with one of
his aides over a court suit. Said
Marshall: "He (Nixon) ends up
shouting into the phone and
either they call off the ITT suit or
he 'wanted McLaren's (the aide)
ass out of there in 30 minutes.'
And then he went on to say 'I
don't like the son of a bitch any
- Murshiill hesitates
chuckling out loud, "Arid air of

the time the damn fool is taping
himself."
Students claim to be relieved
bv Marshall's dashes of wit and
Irequent anecdotes. "His humor
breaks up the monotonv of the
generic boredom of lectures in
general," one said. Furthermore,

If students want to
hear what I've got to
say, it seems to me
I've got a citizen's
obligation to tell
them.'

his use of examples to clarify po
litical points are, according to
students, one of the best things
about the class.
"He constantly brings out ex
amples to make his point — it
sort of ties in something in the
real world with something that's
more abstract in the classroom,"
said one junior. "This obviously
makes it easier to understand."
A biology major at Antioch
College with an interest in forest
ry, Marshall returned from four
years of World War II service
and found he had a "consuming
interest in politics ... I couldn't
keep my mind, in a professional
sense, on research and biology."
He completed his undergraduate
work in biology and went on to
study political science at the Uni
versity of North Carolina, where
he graduated with a Ph.D. in
1950.
After a teaching stint in Flori
da and some policy work for the
government in Washington,
Marshall came to Stanford in
1953 at the age of 33. He has been
at the Farm since then, and fore
sees no future career moves. "I'm
not going to leave (Stanford)," he
said.
Marshall's most passionate
outside interest is gardening, al
though he claims to enjoy it
"only up to a point." Others,
however, insist that he takes
great care and pride in his gar
dening, as shown by the carefully
maintained flowers, bushes and
lawn surrounding his Stanford
home.
Marshall walks or bikes to
clime.Tevorv diiv. He unci his wite
ard also fond of hiking and they

recentlv spent part of a summer
biking through Holland. Most of
his summers, however, are spent
reading about public policv and
working on Political Science I or
one of his seminar classes.
Relaxing comfortablv behind
his large wooden desk, stacked
high but neatlv with various
books and papers, he talks frank
ly about Stanford students. They
possess, he savs, "a sort of Cali
fornia, middle-class, bland, non
argumentative uniformity." He
chooses each adjective verv
carefully, and it takes him almost
30 seconds to complete the sen
tence. "Stanford students mainlv
don't argue back," he adds.
Marshall charcterizes the stu
dent body as liberal Republican,
especially noting the support that
1980 presidential candidate John
Anderson received here. "I'd sav
this is not a conservative campus,
particularly on social issues,"
like busing, abortion and prayer
in public schools, he said. In
these respects, he considers Stan
ford "a liberal, liberal campus."
He claims that students here
are "much more fun to have in
class (than students at state uni
versities) because principally
they're interested in a liberal
education." And students work
hard here — "conceivably harder
than the Ivy League schools."
Marshall, likewise, is a hard
working teacher. Jule Kringel,
graduate assistant in the Political
Science department and a close
friend of the Marshall family,
said that Marshall's classes "are
a success because he really cares
about undergraduates and he's
vitally interested in the material

'I'm not a big time
activist by any
manner of means'

he's teaching. I would character
ize him as an excellent teacher
who has a lot of time for students
— he's very supportive."
Marshall admits that, like ev
ery popular professor, he likes to
talk with, work with and other
wise help students. He takes a
special interest in extraordinarily
gifted Stanfordites and has a
strong record for helping poten
tial Truman and Rhodes scholars
reach their goals. He is currently
the faculty representative for the
Truman Scholarship Program.

"1 like students, I've got tenure
and I do what I want to do," he
said. "I've derived a lot of satis
faction out of getting to know
some of the verv best students. I
enjoy it and I learn an awful lot
from them."
C onsidered to one of Stan
lord's leading experts on the
problems of government and
public policy, Marshall's opin
ions are frequently solicited by
others. He is often quoted in the
Daily and other campus news
papers and magazines regarding
political issues. Kringel admits a
reliance on Marshall's knowl
edge. "I trust his judgment. If I
don't know how to vote on some
of these elections, I ask Hugh."

'On domestic policy
Vm a mild liberal—
more conservative
than I was ten years
ago'

Although Marshall is out
spoken on many issues, he is
often hesitant to offer hi' opinion
on particular topics. He dislikes,
and indeed seems incapable of
forcing his opinion on others.
"It's good that he's not intimidat
ing." said one student. "That
makes him easier to approach
and thus more accessible to stu
dents."
Marshall did, however, offer
some speculation on American
politics todav. "The Democrats
are about as lacking in creditable
leadership as anv party I've ever
known . . . thev are about as
short of new ideas as a political
party can be," he said. "There
lore, if the 1984 election were
held tomorrow, I think Ronald
Reagan would win. Not because
the American people have a high
opinion of Reagan, but only be
cause thev have a lower opinion
of the democrats."
"Professor Marshall reminds
me of mv father," one female stu
dent said. Like anv good father,
he has some advice: "Decide
what it is you want to do, then
throw al! your energy into it, be
good at it, and vou'll end up on
the whole earning a good living.
Now, if you're wild about

and I make up mv own mind. All
of this doesn't affect me except
that it's an enormous help," he
said.
While Marshall definitely has
his own political views, he tries to
stifle, or at least tame these per
sonal opinions when teaching.
He insists, however, that it is im
possible to teach a social science
course without some bias, and he
admits that the bias in his class is
"slightly liberal."
"I think his political bias
helps," said one sophomore po
litical science student. "It gives
you the perspective of someone
who knows. He doesn't come
right out and say what's right or
wrong, but you can at least com
pare your views to his."
Halpern added that "although
he (Marshall), makes no secret of
his views, the wav he treats the is
sues and chooses the readings"
serves to counteract any lecturing
bias.
With his parted, puffy, salt
and-pepper hair, his horn
rimmed glasses and his tattered
appointment book peeking out
of his outside breast pocket, ac
cording to one student, "ties that
come in two colors — blah brown
and olive dr ib," Marshall hardly
seems capable of causing erup
tions of laughter among a class of
sleepy students.
'You don't expect it from him
— he looks like a dry person and
vet he's not," one student com
mented.
In a recent class in which the
professor was discussing the
growing rate of teenage pregnan
cies, Marshall noted: "About 25
percent of all girls under 19 get
pregnant. I look out on a class
like this and think vou are falling
behind."
Another time Marshall got his
laugh at the expense of Nixon, a
frequent butt ofjokesin theclass.
He related a time when Nixon
had a disagreement with one of
his aides over a court suit. Said
Marshall: "He (Nixon) ends up
shouting into the phone and
either they call off the ITT suit or
he 'wanted McLaren's (the aide)
ass out of there in 30 minutes.'
And then he went on to say 'I
don't like the son of a bitch any
- Murshiill hesitates
chuckling out loud, "Arid air of

the time the damn fool is taping
himself."
Students claim to be relieved
bv Marshall's dashes of wit and
Irequent anecdotes. "His humor
breaks up the monotonv of the
generic boredom of lectures in
general," one said. Furthermore,

If students want to
hear what I've got to
say, it seems to me
I've got a citizen's
obligation to tell
them.'

his use of examples to clarify po
litical points are, according to
students, one of the best things
about the class.
"He constantly brings out ex
amples to make his point — it
sort of ties in something in the
real world with something that's
more abstract in the classroom,"
said one junior. "This obviously
makes it easier to understand."
A biology major at Antioch
College with an interest in forest
ry, Marshall returned from four
years of World War II service
and found he had a "consuming
interest in politics ... I couldn't
keep my mind, in a professional
sense, on research and biology."
He completed his undergraduate
work in biology and went on to
study political science at the Uni
versity of North Carolina, where
he graduated with a Ph.D. in
1950.
After a teaching stint in Flori
da and some policy work for the
government in Washington,
Marshall came to Stanford in
1953 at the age of 33. He has been
at the Farm since then, and fore
sees no future career moves. "I'm
not going to leave (Stanford)," he
said.
Marshall's most passionate
outside interest is gardening, al
though he claims to enjoy it
"only up to a point." Others,
however, insist that he takes
great care and pride in his gar
dening, as shown by the carefully
maintained flowers, bushes and
lawn surrounding his Stanford
home.
Marshall walks or bikes to
clime.Tevorv diiv. He unci his wite
ard also fond of hiking and they

recentlv spent part of a summer
biking through Holland. Most of
his summers, however, are spent
reading about public policv and
working on Political Science I or
one of his seminar classes.
Relaxing comfortablv behind
his large wooden desk, stacked
high but neatlv with various
books and papers, he talks frank
ly about Stanford students. They
possess, he savs, "a sort of Cali
fornia, middle-class, bland, non
argumentative uniformity." He
chooses each adjective verv
carefully, and it takes him almost
30 seconds to complete the sen
tence. "Stanford students mainlv
don't argue back," he adds.
Marshall charcterizes the stu
dent body as liberal Republican,
especially noting the support that
1980 presidential candidate John
Anderson received here. "I'd sav
this is not a conservative campus,
particularly on social issues,"
like busing, abortion and prayer
in public schools, he said. In
these respects, he considers Stan
ford "a liberal, liberal campus."
He claims that students here
are "much more fun to have in
class (than students at state uni
versities) because principally
they're interested in a liberal
education." And students work
hard here — "conceivably harder
than the Ivy League schools."
Marshall, likewise, is a hard
working teacher. Jule Kringel,
graduate assistant in the Political
Science department and a close
friend of the Marshall family,
said that Marshall's classes "are
a success because he really cares
about undergraduates and he's
vitally interested in the material

'I'm not a big time
activist by any
manner of means'

he's teaching. I would character
ize him as an excellent teacher
who has a lot of time for students
— he's very supportive."
Marshall admits that, like ev
ery popular professor, he likes to
talk with, work with and other
wise help students. He takes a
special interest in extraordinarily
gifted Stanfordites and has a
strong record for helping poten
tial Truman and Rhodes scholars
reach their goals. He is currently
the faculty representative for the
Truman Scholarship Program.

"1 like students, I've got tenure
and I do what I want to do," he
said. "I've derived a lot of satis
faction out of getting to know
some of the verv best students. I
enjoy it and I learn an awful lot
from them."
C onsidered to one of Stan
lord's leading experts on the
problems of government and
public policy, Marshall's opin
ions are frequently solicited by
others. He is often quoted in the
Daily and other campus news
papers and magazines regarding
political issues. Kringel admits a
reliance on Marshall's knowl
edge. "I trust his judgment. If I
don't know how to vote on some
of these elections, I ask Hugh."

'On domestic policy
Vm a mild liberal—
more conservative
than I was ten years
ago'

Although Marshall is out
spoken on many issues, he is
often hesitant to offer hi' opinion
on particular topics. He dislikes,
and indeed seems incapable of
forcing his opinion on others.
"It's good that he's not intimidat
ing." said one student. "That
makes him easier to approach
and thus more accessible to stu
dents."
Marshall did, however, offer
some speculation on American
politics todav. "The Democrats
are about as lacking in creditable
leadership as anv party I've ever
known . . . thev are about as
short of new ideas as a political
party can be," he said. "There
lore, if the 1984 election were
held tomorrow, I think Ronald
Reagan would win. Not because
the American people have a high
opinion of Reagan, but only be
cause thev have a lower opinion
of the democrats."
"Professor Marshall reminds
me of mv father," one female stu
dent said. Like anv good father,
he has some advice: "Decide
what it is you want to do, then
throw al! your energy into it, be
good at it, and vou'll end up on
the whole earning a good living.

Hubert Marshall
A student once called him the
"Johnny Carson of Political Sci
ence" because of his smooth, en
gaging lecturing stvle and ability
to captivate his audience.
Yet Hubert Marshall looks
more like a staid librarian than a
late night television star. Dressed
in neatlv-creased, cuffed baggy
pants, a dull-colored tie and a
green tweed sportcoat, Marshall
appears unassuming in his role
teaching one of Stanford's most
popular courses.
Marshall has been teaching
Political Science I for almost 30
years, and vet he claims he never

'Stanford students
mainly don't argue
back'

Rets bored. "I've had colleagues
who say they would never teach a
course more than three times be
cause they find it boring, but I
just think that cheats students be
cause you have to teach a course
three times before you really get
on top of it. The first time
through you're always making
mistakes."
Students, too, rarely find the
course boring. "He's entertain
ing," one said. "He keeps the
class moving at a fast pace and he
throws in some humor to provide
a good contrast."
Justin Halpern, administrative
assistant for the class and a
former teaching assistant for the
course, said, "I think part of it

(the success of the class) is Pro
fessor Marshall's lecturing style
and delivery. He is the best lec
turer that I have ever worked
with."
The course addresses the
theme of power, competition and
poverty in America. Marshall's
intense and real interest in these
issues makes it clear that he is a
man who is deeply concerned
about the American society and
the young people who will soon
lead it.
"What makes the course so
good is Marshall's obvious love
for it," said one student. "He
cares about the issues and the stu
dents."
Leaning back in his chair, his
arms folded and relaxed behind
his head, Marshall answers ques
tions and organizes his thoughts
in much the same manner as he
lectures. While he does not fill up
two chalkboards with a detailed
outline, as he does before each
class, he itemizes his points and
chooses his words deliberately,
indicating that he knows exactly
what he wahts to say and how to
say it. Marshall knows the score
on a lot of things, and he is not
afraid to voice his opinion.
Characterizing himself as left
leaning on the political spectrum,
Marshall is outspoken on many
issues. "On domestic policy, I'm
a mild liberal — more conserva
tive that I was 10 vears ago," he
said. On foreign policy questions,
"I'm more nearly a liberal -f —
more a critic of the government."

Over a decade ago he spoke out
against the draft, against the
Vietnam War and in favor of im
peaching former President Rich
ard Nixon.
Today he is a proponent of
equal rights and a nuclear arms
freeze. He has written articles dis
couraging off-campus housing
discrimination, led a rally dem
onstration against President
Johnson's involvement in South
east Asia, and protested military
recruitment on campus.
All this from a man who seems
so shv and softspoken that it's
hard to believe he would partici
pate in a political demonstration,
much less lead one. "You look at
his ties," one student said, "and
that sums up what his personality
should be. He dresses like a
staunch conservative — it's hard
to believe he's a liberal."
And yet Marshall maintains,
"I'm not a big time activist by
any manner of means."
He does, however, have what
he terms "good citizenship." "If
students want to hear what I've
got to say, it seems to me I've got
a citizen's obligation to tell them.
According to friends his interest
in young people and his willing
ness to speak out make him a
logical choice to lead to lead
dorm discussion groups. During
the recent Fate of the Earth
Week, Marshall spoke on nucle
ar issues at three different dorms,
and his pro-choice abortion
views have yet to be publicly
aired.

Marshall's wife Rachelle and
son Jonathan also have their own
political leanings, even more so
than Marshall himself. Rachelle
is a frequent contributor to the
opinions page of the Daily and
other local newspapers and is
currently immersed iri the Mid
east crisis. Jonathan is a declared
Libertarian who works as an edi

argumentative uniformity." He
chooses each adjective verv
carefully, and it takes him almost
30 seconds to complete the sen
tence. "Stanford students mainlv
don't argue back," he adds.
Marshall charcterizes the stu
dent body as liberal Republican,
especially noting the support that
1980 presidential candidate John
Anderson received here. "I'd sav
this is not a conservative campus,
particularly on social issues,"
like busing, abortion and prayer
in public schools, he said. In
these respects, he considers Stan
ford "a liberal, liberal campus."
He claims that students here
are "much more fun to have in
class (than students at state uni
versities) because principally
they're interested in a liberal
education." And students work
hard here — "conceivably harder
than the Ivy League schools."
Marshall, likewise, is a hard
working teacher. Jule Kringel,
graduate assistant in the Political
Science department and a close
friend of the Marshall family,
said that Marshall's classes "are
a success because he really cares
about undergraduates and he's
vitally interested in the material

'I'm not a big time
activist by any
manner of means'

he's teaching. I would character
ize him as an excellent teacher
who has a lot of time for students
— he's very supportive."
Marshall admits that, like ev
ery popular professor, he likes to
talk with, work with and other
wise help students. He takes a
special interest in extraordinarily
gifted Stanfordites and has a
strong record for helping poten
tial Truman and Rhodes scholars
reach their goals. He is currently
the faculty representative for the
Truman Scholarship Program.

"1 like students, I've got tenure
and I do what I want to do," he
said. "I've derived a lot of satis
faction out of getting to know
some of the verv best students. I
enjoy it and I learn an awful lot
from them."
C onsidered to one of Stan
lord's leading experts on the
problems of government and
public policy, Marshall's opin
ions are frequently solicited by
others. He is often quoted in the
Daily and other campus news
papers and magazines regarding
political issues. Kringel admits a
reliance on Marshall's knowl
edge. "I trust his judgment. If I
don't know how to vote on some
of these elections, I ask Hugh."

'On domestic policy
Vm a mild liberal—
more conservative
than I was ten years
ago'

Although Marshall is out
spoken on many issues, he is
often hesitant to offer hi' opinion
on particular topics. He dislikes,
and indeed seems incapable of
forcing his opinion on others.
"It's good that he's not intimidat
ing." said one student. "That
makes him easier to approach
and thus more accessible to stu
dents."
Marshall did, however, offer
some speculation on American
politics todav. "The Democrats
are about as lacking in creditable
leadership as anv party I've ever
known . . . thev are about as
short of new ideas as a political
party can be," he said. "There
lore, if the 1984 election were
held tomorrow, I think Ronald
Reagan would win. Not because
the American people have a high
opinion of Reagan, but only be
cause thev have a lower opinion
of the democrats."
"Professor Marshall reminds
me of mv father," one female stu
dent said. Like anv good father,
he has some advice: "Decide
what it is you want to do, then
throw al! your energy into it, be
good at it, and vou'll end up on

Hubert Marshall
A student once called him the
"Johnny Carson of Political Sci
ence" because of his smooth, en
gaging lecturing stvle and ability
to captivate his audience.
Yet Hubert Marshall looks
more like a staid librarian than a
late night television star. Dressed
in neatlv-creased, cuffed baggy
pants, a dull-colored tie and a
green tweed sportcoat, Marshall
appears unassuming in his role
teaching one of Stanford's most
popular courses.
Marshall has been teaching
Political Science I for almost 30
years, and vet he claims he never

'Stanford students
mainly don't argue
back'

Rets bored. "I've had colleagues
who say they would never teach a
course more than three times be
cause they find it boring, but I
just think that cheats students be
cause you have to teach a course
three times before you really get
on top of it. The first time
through you're always making
mistakes."
Students, too, rarely find the
course boring. "He's entertain
ing," one said. "He keeps the
class moving at a fast pace and he
throws in some humor to provide
a good contrast."
Justin Halpern, administrative
assistant for the class and a
former teaching assistant for the
course, said, "I think part of it

(the success of the class) is Pro
fessor Marshall's lecturing style
and delivery. He is the best lec
turer that I have ever worked
with."
The course addresses the
theme of power, competition and
poverty in America. Marshall's
intense and real interest in these
issues makes it clear that he is a
man who is deeply concerned
about the American society and
the young people who will soon
lead it.
"What makes the course so
good is Marshall's obvious love
for it," said one student. "He
cares about the issues and the stu
dents."
Leaning back in his chair, his
arms folded and relaxed behind
his head, Marshall answers ques
tions and organizes his thoughts
in much the same manner as he
lectures. While he does not fill up
two chalkboards with a detailed
outline, as he does before each
class, he itemizes his points and
chooses his words deliberately,
indicating that he knows exactly
what he wahts to say and how to
say it. Marshall knows the score
on a lot of things, and he is not
afraid to voice his opinion.
Characterizing himself as left
leaning on the political spectrum,
Marshall is outspoken on many
issues. "On domestic policy, I'm
a mild liberal — more conserva
tive that I was 10 vears ago," he
said. On foreign policy questions,
"I'm more nearly a liberal -f —
more a critic of the government."

Over a decade ago he spoke out
against the draft, against the
Vietnam War and in favor of im
peaching former President Rich
ard Nixon.
Today he is a proponent of
equal rights and a nuclear arms
freeze. He has written articles dis
couraging off-campus housing
discrimination, led a rally dem
onstration against President
Johnson's involvement in South
east Asia, and protested military
recruitment on campus.
All this from a man who seems
so shv and softspoken that it's
hard to believe he would partici
pate in a political demonstration,
much less lead one. "You look at
his ties," one student said, "and
that sums up what his personality
should be. He dresses like a
staunch conservative — it's hard
to believe he's a liberal."
And yet Marshall maintains,
"I'm not a big time activist by
any manner of means."
He does, however, have what
he terms "good citizenship." "If
students want to hear what I've
got to say, it seems to me I've got
a citizen's obligation to tell them.
According to friends his interest
in young people and his willing
ness to speak out make him a
logical choice to lead to lead
dorm discussion groups. During
the recent Fate of the Earth
Week, Marshall spoke on nucle
ar issues at three different dorms,
and his pro-choice abortion
views have yet to be publicly
aired.

7 think Reagan
would win (a new
election, but)...

American people

Marshall's wife Rachelle and
son Jonathan also have their own
political leanings, even more so
than Marshall himself. Rachelle
is a frequent contributor to the
opinions page of the Daily and
other local newspapers and is
currently immersed iri the Mid
east crisis. Jonathan is a declared
Libertarian who works as an edi
torial writer for the San Jose
Mercury.

zines, they feed me information.

and I make up mv own mind. All
of this doesn't affect me except
that it's an enormous help," he
said.
While Marshall definitely has
his own political views, he tries to
stifle, or at least tame these per
sonal opinions when teaching.
He insists, however, that it is im
possible to teach a social science
course without some bias, and he
admits that the bias in his class is
"slightly liberal."
"I think his political bias
helps," said one sophomore po
litical science student. "It gives
you the perspective of someone
who knows. He doesn't come
right out and say what's right or
wrong, but you can at least com
pare your views to his."
Halpern added that "although
he (Marshall), makes no secret of
his views, the wav he treats the is
sues and chooses the readings"
serves to counteract any lecturing
bias.
With his parted, puffy, salt
and-pepper hair, his horn
rimmed glasses and his tattered
appointment book peeking out
of his outside breast pocket, ac
cording to one student, "ties that
come in two colors — blah brown
and olive dr ib," Marshall hardly
seems capable of causing erup
tions of laughter among a class of
sleepy students.
'You don't expect it from him
— he looks like a dry person and
vet he's not," one student com
mented.
In a recent class in which the
professor was discussing the
growing rate of teenage pregnan
cies, Marshall noted: "About 25
percent of all girls under 19 get
pregnant. I look out on a class
like this and think vou are falling
behind."
Another time Marshall got his
laugh at the expense of Nixon, a
frequent butt ofjokesin theclass.
He related a time when Nixon
had a disagreement with one of
his aides over a court suit. Said
Marshall: "He (Nixon) ends up
shouting into the phone and
either they call off the ITT suit or
he 'wanted McLaren's (the aide)
ass out of there in 30 minutes.'
And then he went on to say 'I
don't like the son of a bitch any
- Murshiill hesitates
chuckling out loud, "Arid air of

the time the damn fool is taping
himself."
Students claim to be relieved
bv Marshall's dashes of wit and
Irequent anecdotes. "His humor
breaks up the monotonv of the
generic boredom of lectures in
general," one said. Furthermore,

If students want to
hear what I've got to
say, it seems to me
I've got a citizen's
obligation to tell
them.'

his use of examples to clarify po
litical points are, according to
students, one of the best things
about the class.
"He constantly brings out ex
amples to make his point — it
sort of ties in something in the
real world with something that's
more abstract in the classroom,"
said one junior. "This obviously
makes it easier to understand."
A biology major at Antioch
College with an interest in forest
ry, Marshall returned from four
years of World War II service
and found he had a "consuming
interest in politics ... I couldn't
keep my mind, in a professional
sense, on research and biology."
He completed his undergraduate
work in biology and went on to
study political science at the Uni
versity of North Carolina, where
he graduated with a Ph.D. in
1950.
After a teaching stint in Flori
da and some policy work for the
government in Washington,
Marshall came to Stanford in
1953 at the age of 33. He has been
at the Farm since then, and fore
sees no future career moves. "I'm
not going to leave (Stanford)," he
said.
Marshall's most passionate
outside interest is gardening, al
though he claims to enjoy it
"only up to a point." Others,
however, insist that he takes
great care and pride in his gar
dening, as shown by the carefully
maintained flowers, bushes and
lawn surrounding his Stanford
home.
Marshall walks or bikes to
clime.Tevorv diiv. He unci his wite
ard also fond of hiking and they

recentlv spent part of a summer
biking through Holland. Most of
his summers, however, are spent
reading about public policv and
working on Political Science I or
one of his seminar classes.
Relaxing comfortablv behind
his large wooden desk, stacked
high but neatlv with various
books and papers, he talks frank
ly about Stanford students. They
possess, he savs, "a sort of Cali
fornia, middle-class, bland, non
argumentative uniformity." He
chooses each adjective verv
carefully, and it takes him almost
30 seconds to complete the sen
tence. "Stanford students mainlv

on top of it. The first time
through you're always making
mistakes."
Students, too, rarely find the
course boring. "He's entertain
ing," one said. "He keeps the
class moving at a fast pace and he
throws in some humor to provide
a good contrast."
Justin Halpern, administrative
assistant for the class and a
former teaching assistant for the
course, said, "I think part of it

(the success of the class) is Pro
fessor Marshall's lecturing style
and delivery. He is the best lec
turer that I have ever worked
with."
The course addresses the
theme of power, competition and
poverty in America. Marshall's
intense and real interest in these
issues makes it clear that he is a
man who is deeply concerned
about the American society and
the young people who will soon
lead it.
"What makes the course so
good is Marshall's obvious love
for it," said one student. "He
cares about the issues and the stu
dents."
Leaning back in his chair, his
arms folded and relaxed behind
his head, Marshall answers ques
tions and organizes his thoughts
in much the same manner as he
lectures. While he does not fill up
two chalkboards with a detailed
outline, as he does before each
class, he itemizes his points and
chooses his words deliberately,
indicating that he knows exactly
what he wahts to say and how to
say it. Marshall knows the score
on a lot of things, and he is not
afraid to voice his opinion.
Characterizing himself as left
leaning on the political spectrum,
Marshall is outspoken on many
issues. "On domestic policy, I'm
a mild liberal — more conserva
tive that I was 10 vears ago," he
said. On foreign policy questions,
"I'm more nearly a liberal -f —
more a critic of the government."

Over a decade ago he spoke out
against the draft, against the
Vietnam War and in favor of im
peaching former President Rich
ard Nixon.
Today he is a proponent of
equal rights and a nuclear arms
freeze. He has written articles dis
couraging off-campus housing
discrimination, led a rally dem
onstration against President
Johnson's involvement in South
east Asia, and protested military
recruitment on campus.
All this from a man who seems
so shv and softspoken that it's
hard to believe he would partici
pate in a political demonstration,
much less lead one. "You look at
his ties," one student said, "and
that sums up what his personality
should be. He dresses like a
staunch conservative — it's hard
to believe he's a liberal."
And yet Marshall maintains,
"I'm not a big time activist by
any manner of means."
He does, however, have what
he terms "good citizenship." "If
students want to hear what I've
got to say, it seems to me I've got
a citizen's obligation to tell them.
According to friends his interest
in young people and his willing
ness to speak out make him a
logical choice to lead to lead
dorm discussion groups. During
the recent Fate of the Earth
Week, Marshall spoke on nucle
ar issues at three different dorms,
and his pro-choice abortion
views have yet to be publicly
aired.

Marshall's wife Rachelle and
son Jonathan also have their own
political leanings, even more so
than Marshall himself. Rachelle
is a frequent contributor to the
opinions page of the Daily and
other local newspapers and is
currently immersed iri the Mid
east crisis. Jonathan is a declared
Libertarian who works as an edi
torial writer for the San Jose
Mercury.

zines, they feed me information.

and I make up mv own mind. All
of this doesn't affect me except
that it's an enormous help," he
said.
While Marshall definitely has
his own political views, he tries to
stifle, or at least tame these per
sonal opinions when teaching.
He insists, however, that it is im
possible to teach a social science
course without some bias, and he
admits that the bias in his class is
"slightly liberal."
"I think his political bias
helps," said one sophomore po
litical science student. "It gives
you the perspective of someone
who knows. He doesn't come
right out and say what's right or
wrong, but you can at least com
pare your views to his."
Halpern added that "although
he (Marshall), makes no secret of
his views, the wav he treats the is
sues and chooses the readings"
serves to counteract any lecturing
bias.
With his parted, puffy, salt
and-pepper hair, his horn
rimmed glasses and his tattered
appointment book peeking out
of his outside breast pocket, ac
cording to one student, "ties that
come in two colors — blah brown
and olive dr ib," Marshall hardly
seems capable of causing erup
tions of laughter among a class of
sleepy students.
'You don't expect it from him
— he looks like a dry person and
vet he's not," one student com
mented.
In a recent class in which the
professor was discussing the
growing rate of teenage pregnan
cies, Marshall noted: "About 25
percent of all girls under 19 get
pregnant. I look out on a class
like this and think vou are falling
behind."
Another time Marshall got his
laugh at the expense of Nixon, a
frequent butt ofjokesin theclass.
He related a time when Nixon
had a disagreement with one of
his aides over a court suit. Said
Marshall: "He (Nixon) ends up
shouting into the phone and
either they call off the ITT suit or
he 'wanted McLaren's (the aide)
ass out of there in 30 minutes.'
And then he went on to say 'I
don't like the son of a bitch any
- Murshiill hesitates
chuckling out loud, "Arid air of

the time the damn fool is taping
himself."
Students claim to be relieved
bv Marshall's dashes of wit and
Irequent anecdotes. "His humor
breaks up the monotonv of the
generic boredom of lectures in
general," one said. Furthermore,

If students want to
hear what I've got to
say, it seems to me
I've got a citizen's
obligation to tell
them.'

his use of examples to clarify po
litical points are, according to
students, one of the best things
about the class.
"He constantly brings out ex
amples to make his point — it
sort of ties in something in the
real world with something that's
more abstract in the classroom,"
said one junior. "This obviously
makes it easier to understand."
A biology major at Antioch
College with an interest in forest
ry, Marshall returned from four
years of World War II service
and found he had a "consuming
interest in politics ... I couldn't
keep my mind, in a professional
sense, on research and biology."
He completed his undergraduate
work in biology and went on to
study political science at the Uni
versity of North Carolina, where
he graduated with a Ph.D. in
1950.
After a teaching stint in Flori
da and some policy work for the
government in Washington,
Marshall came to Stanford in
1953 at the age of 33. He has been
at the Farm since then, and fore
sees no future career moves. "I'm
not going to leave (Stanford)," he
said.
Marshall's most passionate
outside interest is gardening, al
though he claims to enjoy it
"only up to a point." Others,
however, insist that he takes
great care and pride in his gar
dening, as shown by the carefully
maintained flowers, bushes and
lawn surrounding his Stanford
home.
Marshall walks or bikes to
clime.Tevorv diiv. He unci his wite
ard also fond of hiking and they

recentlv spent part of a summer
biking through Holland. Most of
his summers, however, are spent
reading about public policv and
working on Political Science I or
one of his seminar classes.
Relaxing comfortablv behind
his large wooden desk, stacked
high but neatlv with various
books and papers, he talks frank
ly about Stanford students. They
possess, he savs, "a sort of Cali
fornia, middle-class, bland, non
argumentative uniformity." He
chooses each adjective verv
carefully, and it takes him almost
30 seconds to complete the sen
tence. "Stanford students mainlv
don't argue back," he adds.
Marshall charcterizes the stu
dent body as liberal Republican,
especially noting the support that
1980 presidential candidate John
Anderson received here. "I'd sav
this is not a conservative campus,
particularly on social issues,"
like busing, abortion and prayer
in public schools, he said. In
these respects, he considers Stan
ford "a liberal, liberal campus."
He claims that students here
are "much more fun to have in
class (than students at state uni
versities) because principally
they're interested in a liberal
education." And students work
hard here — "conceivably harder
than the Ivy League schools."
Marshall, likewise, is a hard
working teacher. Jule Kringel,
graduate assistant in the Political
Science department and a close
friend of the Marshall family,
said that Marshall's classes "are
a success because he really cares
about undergraduates and he's
vitally interested in the material

'I'm not a big time
activist by any
manner of means'

he's teaching. I would character
ize him as an excellent teacher
who has a lot of time for students
— he's very supportive."
Marshall admits that, like ev
ery popular professor, he likes to
talk with, work with and other
wise help students. He takes a
special interest in extraordinarily
gifted Stanfordites and has a
strong record for helping poten
tial Truman and Rhodes scholars
reach their goals. He is currently
the faculty representative for the
Truman Scholarship Program.

"1 like students, I've got tenure
and I do what I want to do," he
said. "I've derived a lot of satis
faction out of getting to know
some of the verv best students. I
enjoy it and I learn an awful lot
from them."
C onsidered to one of Stan
lord's leading experts on the
problems of government and
public policy, Marshall's opin
ions are frequently solicited by
others. He is often quoted in the
Daily and other campus news
papers and magazines regarding
political issues. Kringel admits a
reliance on Marshall's knowl
edge. "I trust his judgment. If I
don't know how to vote on some
of these elections, I ask Hugh."

'On domestic policy
Vm a mild liberal—
more conservative
than I was ten years
ago'

Although Marshall is out
spoken on many issues, he is
often hesitant to offer hi' opinion
on particular topics. He dislikes,
and indeed seems incapable of
forcing his opinion on others.
"It's good that he's not intimidat
ing." said one student. "That
makes him easier to approach
and thus more accessible to stu
dents."
Marshall did, however, offer
some speculation on American
politics todav. "The Democrats
are about as lacking in creditable
leadership as anv party I've ever
known . . . thev are about as
short of new ideas as a political
party can be," he said. "There
lore, if the 1984 election were
held tomorrow, I think Ronald
Reagan would win. Not because
the American people have a high
opinion of Reagan, but only be
cause thev have a lower opinion
of the democrats."
"Professor Marshall reminds
me of mv father," one female stu
dent said. Like anv good father,
he has some advice: "Decide
what it is you want to do, then
throw al! your energy into it, be
good at it, and vou'll end up on
the whole earning a good living.
Now, if you're wild about

Hubert Marshall
A student once called him the
"Johnny Carson of Political Sci
ence" because of his smooth, en
gaging lecturing stvle and ability
to captivate his audience.
Yet Hubert Marshall looks
more like a staid librarian than a
late night television star. Dressed
in neatlv-creased, cuffed baggy
pants, a dull-colored tie and a
green tweed sportcoat, Marshall
appears unassuming in his role
teaching one of Stanford's most
popular courses.
