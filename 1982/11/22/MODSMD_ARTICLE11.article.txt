### 
There's a glass case over at Tresidder Union, and
it looks kinda — well, empty. You know, a little for
lorn, like something should be there but just isn't.
Some of the old folks 'round these parts say we used
to have an axe in that case, or at least as much of an
axe that would fit in there. Now that it's empty, we
think that there should still be something in the
glass case, something that would fit better. Maybe
another tool or piece of hardware. A large screw,
perhaps.
You all know what happened; you were either
there, or you were told the whole tale enough times

to act like you were. And it's re
ally difficult to avoid feeling
upset (no pun intended). After
this season (remember San Jose
State, Arizona State and Arizo
na?), after the first Cal touch
down (remember that
too?),and especially after that
damn cannon went off after the
game (it did seem like it was
pointed at the Stanford student

section, didn't it?), one felt like scrambling to the
nearest mountaintop and shouting "What do we
have to do to win a ballgame?"
Well, mountaintops can wait — if you really feel
the urge, we suggest the mountains around Tahoe,
where you can at least do something worthwhile in
addition to shouting. Yeah, the officiating was bad
— we think so, all the commentators who are paid
to think about such things think so, and you can bet
that the entire East Bay would think so if the final
four seconds bore any similarity to reality. But they
didn't, and there's not a heck of a lot that we can do
about it.
The first Cal touchdown may well have been
purely hypothetical, but the sting of that judgment

call was erased bv the birth of a new student rooting
section tradition: signaling a touchdown on any
nonproductive play for the opposing team. And
who at the stadium seriously thought that those
points would be important later? Bad calls have
happened before; the only strategy for dealing with
them is acceptance.
More galling to most Cardinal fans was The
Amazing Rugbv-stvie Runback. As far as we're
concerned, no one can be blamed for stepping onto
the field when an official signals the play dead (and
he did, though he was overruled later) — not the
players on the bench, not the band, and especially
not Cal, even though the term "weenies" carries
more bitterness with it these days. If you can re
sponsibly say that you would have stayed off the
field if you had a trombone in your hand and
thought the game was over, then you need to have
your pulse checked.
It would be nice if there was some way to appeal
to a higher authority — Cal athletic director Dave
Maggard, the Pac-10 conference, the NCAA, the
Better Business Bureau, the President, someone —
in order to ease the hearts and minds of those who
feel we won this game. But that's somewhat useless.
The most that can happen in the college football in
frastructure already has: at least one referee has ad
mitted to shortcomings in officiating and con
firmed that the score will remain the same regard
less.
Later, there will be the usual arguments for using
instant replays to aid officials and adding to the
number of zebra shirts on the field. But the glass
case in Tresidder remains empty; for the next year,
Cal has the axe and all we car. do is tell them where
to put it. Maybe by next November, we can teach
the band how to tackle.
