## Fast to save someone else's life 
### 
All Stanford students believe, more or less, that our time
and our money is ours by an inalienable right, and that we
alone are authorized to do with them as we please as long as
we don't "cause anv harm to others." Above all, we have the
right to be left alone when those who did not win the "fair"
race, (the race of life), fall into dire straits and need our
help. Like Shen Te, in Bertold Brecht's "The Good Soul of
Szechuan," we complain that there are too many poor peo
ple and that we cannot possibly help all of them. Since we
must be impartial and not pick favorites (another noble prin
ciple that is also quite convenient) the obvious answer is that
we will help no one. Like the three gods in Brecht's play we
ascend toward heaven wishing good luck to those left be
hind, assuring them of our sympathy while we move farther
and farther away from them until they are out of our sight
forever. We didn't really have much in common with them
anvwav.
It is no secret that there are hundreds of millions of people
struggling to survive in ways which would apall us if we ever
bothered to look. In many countries 20 to 30 percent of chil
dren bom die before they reach the age of five, the victims of
disease and malnutrition that could have been avoided with,
a better diet and better medical care. The cost of preventing
this would not be great. The World Bank estimates that it
costs less than $5 to immunize a child against all common
childhood diseases {World Bank Development Report, 1980).
Millions of deaths could be avoided, but we are annoyed be
cause $5 could buy an inexpensive dinner. Our sacred right
to be left alone, after we have "won the race" and secured for
ourselves all that we "rightfully deserve," is a right that is
literally fatal for millions. Yet these people are so far away
from us, both in distance and in out thoughts, that they nev
er really were alive as far as we're concerned. It is all some of
kind of nightmare that is too horrible to be believed.
Even in the United States poverty is still a serious national
issue, especially with unemployment more than 10 percent
and still growing. In some inner city ghettos, infant mortality
levels are similar to those found in underdeveloped countries
and it has been estimated that in Chicago 500,000 people go
to bed hungry on any given night. But these cities are
thousands of miles away from Stanford and East Palo Alto,
a near-ghetto, is just as far away in our minds.
All of what has just been discussed v/culd simply be anoth
er waste of our precious time if the only thing we could do
was abandon Stanford and unconditionally commit

ourselves to the task of eliminating hunger and poverty.
None of us would do it, no matter how much genuine con
cern we have; for us, the winners, the cost is just too great.
But we can do something less dramatic, and perhaps by
doing so we can gradually reorient our daily lives towards
more humanitarian principles if we really take them serious
ly. That something is to participate in the Fast Day activities

Millions of deaths could be avoided,
but we are annoyed because 55 could
buy an inexpensive dinner. Our sacred
right to be left alone, after we have
'won the race 9 and secured for
ourselves all that we'rightfully
deserve, * is a right that is literally
fatalfor millions.

today and tomorrow. Bv giving up some of our food or mon
ey, we can directly alleviate the suffering of those who
stumbled in the race that we won. Bv giving up some of our
time we can educate ourselves on the problem of hunger at
home and abroad and learn how our donations can be used
most effectively. In doing so we may find that we will change,
that our concepts of what's important and what's not will
not be the same.
Several vears from now, after we have entered the real
world and been declared winners, we may remember the
football game we saw or the tests and papers we studied for
in our various classes. We may completely forget that we
gave money or fasted one day because our consciences were
pricked or because we didn't want someone to think ill of us.
Yet the dav we gave $5 mav mark the time when someone
thousands of miles awav was given a chance to live a full life
span by being immunized as a young child. The problem is
large, but it can onlv be reduced one person at a time. We will
never know how manv lives we saved by our efforts, but the
people we saved will know we saved them.

and our money is ours by an inalienable right, and that we
alone are authorized to do with them as we please as long as
we don't "cause anv harm to others." Above all, we have the
right to be left alone when those who did not win the "fair"
race, (the race of life), fall into dire straits and need our
help. Like Shen Te, in Bertold Brecht's "The Good Soul of
Szechuan," we complain that there are too many poor peo
ple and that we cannot possibly help all of them. Since we
must be impartial and not pick favorites (another noble prin
ciple that is also quite convenient) the obvious answer is that
we will help no one. Like the three gods in Brecht's play we
ascend toward heaven wishing good luck to those left be
hind, assuring them of our sympathy while we move farther
and farther away from them until they are out of our sight
forever. We didn't really have much in common with them
anvwav.
It is no secret that there are hundreds of millions of people
struggling to survive in ways which would apall us if we ever
bothered to look. In many countries 20 to 30 percent of chil
dren bom die before they reach the age of five, the victims of
disease and malnutrition that could have been avoided with,
a better diet and better medical care. The cost of preventing
this would not be great. The World Bank estimates that it
costs less than $5 to immunize a child against all common
childhood diseases {World Bank Development Report, 1980).
Millions of deaths could be avoided, but we are annoyed be
cause $5 could buy an inexpensive dinner. Our sacred right
to be left alone, after we have "won the race" and secured for
ourselves all that we "rightfully deserve," is a right that is
literally fatal for millions. Yet these people are so far away
from us, both in distance and in out thoughts, that they nev
er really were alive as far as we're concerned. It is all some of
kind of nightmare that is too horrible to be believed.
Even in the United States poverty is still a serious national
issue, especially with unemployment more than 10 percent
and still growing. In some inner city ghettos, infant mortality
levels are similar to those found in underdeveloped countries
and it has been estimated that in Chicago 500,000 people go
to bed hungry on any given night. But these cities are
thousands of miles away from Stanford and East Palo Alto,
a near-ghetto, is just as far away in our minds.
All of what has just been discussed v/culd simply be anoth
er waste of our precious time if the only thing we could do
was abandon Stanford and unconditionally commit

ourselves to the task of eliminating hunger and poverty.
None of us would do it, no matter how much genuine con
cern we have; for us, the winners, the cost is just too great.
But we can do something less dramatic, and perhaps by
doing so we can gradually reorient our daily lives towards
more humanitarian principles if we really take them serious
ly. That something is to participate in the Fast Day activities

today and tomorrow. Bv giving up some of our food or mon
ey, we can directly alleviate the suffering of those who
stumbled in the race that we won. Bv giving up some of our
time we can educate ourselves on the problem of hunger at
home and abroad and learn how our donations can be used
most effectively. In doing so we may find that we will change,
that our concepts of what's important and what's not will
not be the same.
Several vears from now, after we have entered the real
world and been declared winners, we may remember the
football game we saw or the tests and papers we studied for

pricked or because we didn't want someone to think ill of us.

thousands of miles awav was given a chance to live a full life

large, but it can onlv be reduced one person at a time. We will
never know how manv lives we saved by our efforts, but the
people we saved will know we saved them.
