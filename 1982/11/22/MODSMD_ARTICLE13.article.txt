## Harwood column obscures social causes of rape 
### 
Ted Harwood's opinion piece 112 Daily,
Nov. 15) displays all the smugness and
casual superficiality we have come to
expect from columns originating from
the Hoovrr Institution. His patronizing
and fundamentally misdirected
criticisms against "middle-class
guiliism" obscure the basic causes of
social problems like rape and racism
and oversimplify the emotional and in
tellectual difficulties in formulating a
personal response to them.
Without undertaking a point-by
point criticism of Harwood's faulty
arguments, biased assumptions and in
sensitive accusations. I want to identify
three particularly horrendous con
clusions he would apparently have his
readers accept.
first, and most subtly, he implies
that the "consistent and balanced ap
plication of political principles" is a su
perior approach to the identification
and resolution of social issues. This ra
tionalistic attitude is not wrong, but in
complete: it neglects the role that emo
tions like anger, resentment, frustration
and rage plav in the actuul motivation
of effective action towards social
change. It is true that excessive guilt is
often a wav of avoiding an active re
sponse. But if Harwood means only to
revive nld cliches about "liberal guilt"
he certainly isn't adding much to the

scope of political discourse. A more im
portant question is how and when bad
conscience can he a progressive and lib
erating sentiment. Bv contrasting the
emotional pitch of "militants" with his
own cool aloofness, Harwood trivi
ali/ies the verv basis of political cons
cience, which is the passionate aware
ness of human suffering.
Second. Harwood ignores the entire
question of privilege; the privilege of
money, of race, of gender, of nationali
ty. It is fitting, perhaps, that the intellec
tuals of the Hoover Institution should
be actively rationalizing such privileges,
since their own professional existence
so obviously depends on them. But to
the degree that the rest of us do not ac
cept such privileges unconsciously, we
should adopt an attitude not too unlike
that of the "guiltists": we must see the
connection between our own privileges
and the deprivation of privileges for
others. The easy presumption of privi
lege is another wav of abrogatinu re
sponsibilitv, and a certain degree of
critical distance from the system that
maintains social privilege is morally ob
ligatory.
Third, and perhaps most pernicious,
is Harwood's analysis of rape. Bv im
plicitly linking rape to "lower income
people and minorities" and by regard
ing it simplv as a legal problem with ap

propriate legal solutions (bust "em and
jail 'cm). Harwood misses the basic
point that previous articles on the sub
ject have emphasized. Rape is not only
the felonv as defined hv law; it is, unlike
any other crime, a continuum of ac
tions, some of which are condoneu bv
law (for example, in many states it is
considered impossible for a husband to
"rape" his wife). Defining "rape" in
narrowly legal terms, one might sup
pose that it /'.v a special problem of "low
er income" and minority" people, since
ihev are the ones most often arrested
and convicted for it. Bui I earnestly
hope that most people reading this arti
cle realize that such cases are the tip of
an iceberg of assaults and rapes, most of
which are never reported because the
people involved are just like you and
me: good decent people who "don't do
(hat sort of thing." Because the line be
tween "legitimate" or "normal" sex
uality and that which is coercive — in
whatever form coercion takes — is so
slim, a healthv attitude of scrutiny and
self-critWsm is surelv called for, and if
this produces some feelings of guilt (I
speak especially toother men here), it is
because we have memories to feel guilty
about.
