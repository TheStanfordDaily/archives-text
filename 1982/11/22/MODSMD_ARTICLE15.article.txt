## A 						University's racial problem 
### 
Race relations here are prettv lousy.
Maybe that's not the most pleasant way
to put it, but it's a reality which we can't
ignore. Although tensions and resent
ment rarelv rise overtly to the surface, it
is not because they don't exist. Beneath
a relatively smooth veneer, the general
level of" communication, respect and
mutual understanding among the vari
ous racial and ethnic groups here leaves
much to be desired. It's time to stop ig
noring the situation and instead work
to change it.
We want to point out at the outset
that there are of course individual excep
tions to what we have to say. However,
in general, we challenge others to dis
agree with out assessment and we en
courage them to write in with their reel
ings. It's a topic that deserves tar more
thoughtful discussion anci debate here
— and we mean that for students, facul
ty, staff and all levels of the adminis
tration, particularly the top rungs.
Statistics on the percentage of minor
ity students, faculty and administrators
reveal a great deal about some of the
roots of this problem. In 1981, the total
non-Asian minority and Third World
population (black, Hispanic and Native
American) represented 13.2 percent
of all undergraduates here. 6.1 percent
were Hispanic (largely Chicano) and
0.5 percent where Native Americans.
These figures, which have not im
proved significantly in more than five
years, lie far below the state and na
tional percentages for these minority
groups. (For example, an estimated 30
percent of all Californians are
Chicanos.) The last truly significant
gains in minority enrollment and af
firmative action here occurred from
1967-72, a time when campus (and na
tional) awareness and activism were at a
peak. Maybe we can all learn a lesson
from that.
Recent figures for minority graduate
students are equally alarming. Black
students make up a grand total of 3 per
cent of the entire graduate population,
Chicano and other Hispanic students
total about the same (3.5 percent and
Native Americans comprise well below
I percent. Significantly, over half of all
black and Chicano graduates are in the
Law, Medical and Business schools,
which undertake special recruitment ef
forts. The performance in graduate
Ph.l) programs in the humanities and
sciences is, in a word, pitiful. For exam
ple, less than I percent of all engineering
graduate students are black and the
same is true of Chicanos. Other depart
ments fare only slightly better and the
minority enrollment trend has been
downward since 1972. It does not re
quire a great deal of insight to see the
implications of such figures in broader
societal terms. Though Stanford is
clearly not the only source of these
problems and though other schools fare
equally poorlv, these glaring disparities
require immediate attention and im
provement.
Kacultv and staff statistics are simi
larly disheartening. Less than 6 percent
of all tenured professorships here are
held bv minorities (black and Hispanic)
with onlv a fractional increase achieved
over the past five years. Further, only
6.5 percent of all "tenure-line" pro
fessorships are held bv minorities; this
does not hold much promise for future
increases.
Kacultv members represent very im
portant role models for the student
population. Just as important, how
ever. minority faculty members have a
Special abilitv to provide all of us with
new insights into different attitudes and
cultural perspectives.
Stanford's administration is not ex
actly loaded with minorities in high
places, either. In fact, not a single mi
noritv administrator with rank over C-8
(Stanford's method for ranking staff
personnel goes as high as C-12 or
C-l3)comes to mind. This provides lit
tle encouragement to young minority
administrators, considering potential
long-term commitments to the Univer
sity.
But. these figures, stark as they are,
only tell part of the storv here at Stan
lord. There are other more subtle fac
tors which bear equal consideration in
understanding the general lack of inter
racial communication and awareness.
Tor the average white student here,
race relations and attitudes seem to be a
non-issue. That's something we all need
to take responsibility for changing,
since minority persons are constantly
asked to adapt to a Stanford culture

and environment which is clearly
"white" in nature.
White racism at Stanford seems
basically of the "ignorance" variety. It
is rarely malicious or ugly, with a few
notable exceptions. It stems instead
from our failure to fully respect the cul
tural and social differences between
ourselves and the minority com
munities or to appreciate the adjust
ments which they are forced to make to
live in our "society." Most whites rec
ognize the racial separation and isola
tion in dining halls and residents, but
either accept it or blame it on the minor
ities themselves. Most whites here (and
certainly most Californians or sub
urban dwellers) grew up in com
munities which are fairly isolated racial
ly. Such isolation quite naturally leads
to lack of awareness about racial issues
and the constant adaptations which mi
norities must make in white society; and

'Once here, there's an awful lot ofpeer pressure
from other minorities, who themselves are going
through a similar cultural and racial identification
process for the first time, to separate offfrom the
white community.'

that lack of concern spawns misun
derstanding and mistrust on both sides.
Third World and minority students
here at Stanford do tend to cluster into
racially separate enclaves. Why? First,
there is the aforementioned insensitivi
tv of whites to what it means to be a mi
nority in a white environment. Second,
Stanford enrolls a vastly dispropor
tionate number of middle and upper
class minority students. This is a vital
point, but we prefer to let a black friend
explain it in her terms:
"Minoritv students from relatively
privileged economic backgrounds often
grow up immersed in 'white' society,
being one of the few minorities in their
neighborhood or school. Thus, they
may have never fully identified with
their own racial or ethnic background
until they reach Stanford. Once here,
there's an awful lot of peer pressure
from other minorities, who themselves
are going through a similar cultural and
racial identification process for the first
time, to separate off from the white
community around them. This is far
less true for people who grew up in the
ghetto because they come here already
secure in their particular racial identity.
As such, thev usually don't feel the
same pressures to prove that identity to
themselves and their friends.
"The implications of Stanford's fail
ures to adequately recruit low-income
minorities are prettv major. Individual
minority students are under a lot of
pressure to choose between one world

or the other, and for the most part, the
choice is prettv natural. No matter
which vvav she or he chooses, the indi
vidual risks alienating friends of one
color or the other. It's not a very nice
situation but it's the truth. Just ask any
of your black orChicano friends. There
is a lot of anger, resentment and frustra
tion out there if people are only willing
to look more closely."
Obviously, this is a large and multi
faceted problem. How to start changing
it? Hirst of all, recognize its existence
and start openlv discussing it. Politely
ignoring it or comforting ourselves with
the rationalization that we have some
black or Chicano "friends" builds no
new understanding or awareness.
(ireater efforts on interpersonal
lev els don't tust mean having a friend or
two. How manv whites at Stanford ever
go to black dance, theater, or musical

events? How manv ever try to learn
about the roots and history of Chicano
culture? How manv of us demonstrate
awareness and activism towards politi
cal issues which concern minority com
munities? How many even know what
those issues are? Remember, blacks,
Chicanos and other Third World peo
ple must live in our white world every
day. How much of an effort do we
whites make to learn about their
turc, history and daily reality?
Individual student efforts are ob
viously onlv part of the solution. The
University as a whole, and particularly
the top administration, bears much of
the responsibility for addressing
problem head on. Occasionally, Presi
dent Kennedy mentions it in a speech,
or there's a Campus Report article, but
there are no signs of any real improve
ment. Where are the active recruitment
drives in low-income communities?
Where are the black and Chicano pro
fessors? Where are the top minority ad
ministrators?
All of us here need to recognize that
race relations are an issue that affects
each of our lives, not simply the minor
ity community's. We all bear responsi
bility for breaking down the barriers of
mistrust, miscommunication and mis
understanding that currently exist. If
we do not, we all come out losers in the
educational process.

notable exceptions. It stems instead
from our failure to fully respect the cul
tural and social differences between
ourselves and the minority com
munities or to appreciate the adjust
ments which they are forced to make to
live in our "society." Most whites rec
ognize the racial separation and isola
tion in dining halls and residents, but
either accept it or blame it on the minor
ities themselves. Most whites here (and
certainly most Californians or sub
urban dwellers) grew up in com
munities which are fairly isolated racial

to lack of awareness about racial issues
and the constant adaptations which mi

process for the first time, to separate offfrom the

that lack of concern spawns misun
derstanding and mistrust on both sides.
Third World and minority students
here at Stanford do tend to cluster into
racially separate enclaves. Why? First,
there is the aforementioned insensitivi
tv of whites to what it means to be a mi
nority in a white environment. Second,
Stanford enrolls a vastly dispropor
tionate number of middle and upper
class minority students. This is a vital
point, but we prefer to let a black friend
explain it in her terms:
"Minoritv students from relatively
privileged economic backgrounds often
grow up immersed in 'white' society,
being one of the few minorities in their
neighborhood or school. Thus, they
may have never fully identified with
their own racial or ethnic background
until they reach Stanford. Once here,
there's an awful lot of peer pressure
from other minorities, who themselves
are going through a similar cultural and
racial identification process for the first
time, to separate off from the white
community around them. This is far
less true for people who grew up in the
ghetto because they come here already
secure in their particular racial identity.
As such, thev usually don't feel the
same pressures to prove that identity to
themselves and their friends.
"The implications of Stanford's fail
ures to adequately recruit low-income
minorities are prettv major. Individual
minority students are under a lot of
pressure to choose between one world

or the other, and for the most part, the
choice is prettv natural. No matter
which vvav she or he chooses, the indi
vidual risks alienating friends of one
color or the other. It's not a very nice
situation but it's the truth. Just ask any
of your black orChicano friends. There
is a lot of anger, resentment and frustra
tion out there if people are only willing
to look more closely."
Obviously, this is a large and multi
faceted problem. How to start changing
it? Hirst of all, recognize its existence
and start openlv discussing it. Politely
ignoring it or comforting ourselves with
the rationalization that we have some
black or Chicano "friends" builds no
new understanding or awareness.
(ireater efforts on interpersonal
lev els don't tust mean having a friend or
two. How manv whites at Stanford ever
go to black dance, theater, or musical

events? How manv ever try to learn
about the roots and history of Chicano
culture? How manv of us demonstrate
awareness and activism towards politi
cal issues which concern minority com
munities? How many even know what
those issues are? Remember, blacks,
Chicanos and other Third World peo
ple must live in our white world every
day. How much of an effort do we
whites make to learn about their
turc, history and daily reality?
Individual student efforts are ob
viously onlv part of the solution. The
University as a whole, and particularly
the top administration, bears much of
the responsibility for addressing
problem head on. Occasionally, Presi
dent Kennedy mentions it in a speech,
or there's a Campus Report article, but
there are no signs of any real improve
ment. Where are the active recruitment
drives in low-income communities?
Where are the black and Chicano pro
fessors? Where are the top minority ad
ministrators?
All of us here need to recognize that
race relations are an issue that affects
each of our lives, not simply the minor
ity community's. We all bear responsi
bility for breaking down the barriers of
mistrust, miscommunication and mis
understanding that currently exist. If
we do not, we all come out losers in the
educational process.
(Jim Sleyer and Mike Calabrese and

Race relations here are prettv lousy.
Maybe that's not the most pleasant way
to put it, but it's a reality which we can't
ignore. Although tensions and resent
ment rarelv rise overtly to the surface, it
is not because they don't exist. Beneath
a relatively smooth veneer, the general
level of" communication, respect and
mutual understanding among the vari
ous racial and ethnic groups here leaves
much to be desired. It's time to stop ig
noring the situation and instead work
to change it.
We want to point out at the outset
that there are of course individual excep
tions to what we have to say. However,
in general, we challenge others to dis
agree with out assessment and we en
courage them to write in with their reel
ings. It's a topic that deserves tar more
thoughtful discussion anci debate here
— and we mean that for students, facul
ty, staff and all levels of the adminis
tration, particularly the top rungs.
Statistics on the percentage of minor
ity students, faculty and administrators
reveal a great deal about some of the
roots of this problem. In 1981, the total
non-Asian minority and Third World
population (black, Hispanic and Native
American) represented 13.2 percent
of all undergraduates here. 6.1 percent
were Hispanic (largely Chicano) and
0.5 percent where Native Americans.
These figures, which have not im
proved significantly in more than five
years, lie far below the state and na
tional percentages for these minority
groups. (For example, an estimated 30
percent of all Californians are
Chicanos.) The last truly significant
gains in minority enrollment and af
firmative action here occurred from
1967-72, a time when campus (and na
tional) awareness and activism were at a
peak. Maybe we can all learn a lesson
from that.
Recent figures for minority graduate
students are equally alarming. Black
students make up a grand total of 3 per
cent of the entire graduate population,
Chicano and other Hispanic students
total about the same (3.5 percent and
Native Americans comprise well below
I percent. Significantly, over half of all
black and Chicano graduates are in the
Law, Medical and Business schools,
which undertake special recruitment ef
forts. The performance in graduate
Ph.l) programs in the humanities and
sciences is, in a word, pitiful. For exam
ple, less than I percent of all engineering
graduate students are black and the
same is true of Chicanos. Other depart
ments fare only slightly better and the
minority enrollment trend has been
downward since 1972. It does not re
quire a great deal of insight to see the
implications of such figures in broader
societal terms. Though Stanford is
clearly not the only source of these
problems and though other schools fare
equally poorlv, these glaring disparities
require immediate attention and im
provement.
Kacultv and staff statistics are simi
larly disheartening. Less than 6 percent
of all tenured professorships here are
held bv minorities (black and Hispanic)
with onlv a fractional increase achieved
over the past five years. Further, only
6.5 percent of all "tenure-line" pro
fessorships are held bv minorities; this
does not hold much promise for future
increases.
Kacultv members represent very im
portant role models for the student
population. Just as important, how
ever. minority faculty members have a
Special abilitv to provide all of us with

Stanford's administration is not ex
actly loaded with minorities in high
places, either. In fact, not a single mi
noritv administrator with rank over C-8
(Stanford's method for ranking staff
personnel goes as high as C-12 or
C-l3)comes to mind. This provides lit
tle encouragement to young minority
administrators, considering potential
long-term commitments to the Univer
sity.
But. these figures, stark as they are,
only tell part of the storv here at Stan
lord. There are other more subtle fac
tors which bear equal consideration in
understanding the general lack of inter
racial communication and awareness.
Tor the average white student here,
race relations and attitudes seem to be a
non-issue. That's something we all need
to take responsibility for changing,
since minority persons are constantly
asked to adapt to a Stanford culture

and environment which is clearly
"white" in nature.
White racism at Stanford seems
basically of the "ignorance" variety. It
is rarely malicious or ugly, with a few
notable exceptions. It stems instead

Race relations here are prettv lousy.
Maybe that's not the most pleasant way
to put it, but it's a reality which we can't
ignore. Although tensions and resent
ment rarelv rise overtly to the surface, it
is not because they don't exist. Beneath
a relatively smooth veneer, the general
level of" communication, respect and
mutual understanding among the vari
ous racial and ethnic groups here leaves
much to be desired. It's time to stop ig
noring the situation and instead work
to change it.
We want to point out at the outset
that there are of course individual excep
tions to what we have to say. However,
in general, we challenge others to dis
agree with out assessment and we en
courage them to write in with their reel
ings. It's a topic that deserves tar more
thoughtful discussion anci debate here
— and we mean that for students, facul
ty, staff and all levels of the adminis
tration, particularly the top rungs.
Statistics on the percentage of minor
ity students, faculty and administrators
reveal a great deal about some of the
roots of this problem. In 1981, the total
non-Asian minority and Third World
population (black, Hispanic and Native
American) represented 13.2 percent
of all undergraduates here. 6.1 percent
were Hispanic (largely Chicano) and
0.5 percent where Native Americans.
These figures, which have not im
proved significantly in more than five
years, lie far below the state and na
tional percentages for these minority
groups. (For example, an estimated 30
percent of all Californians are
Chicanos.) The last truly significant
gains in minority enrollment and af
firmative action here occurred from
1967-72, a time when campus (and na
tional) awareness and activism were at a
peak. Maybe we can all learn a lesson
from that.
Recent figures for minority graduate
students are equally alarming. Black
students make up a grand total of 3 per
cent of the entire graduate population,
Chicano and other Hispanic students
total about the same (3.5 percent and
Native Americans comprise well below
I percent. Significantly, over half of all
black and Chicano graduates are in the
Law, Medical and Business schools,
which undertake special recruitment ef
forts. The performance in graduate
Ph.l) programs in the humanities and
sciences is, in a word, pitiful. For exam
ple, less than I percent of all engineering
graduate students are black and the
same is true of Chicanos. Other depart
ments fare only slightly better and the
minority enrollment trend has been
downward since 1972. It does not re
quire a great deal of insight to see the
implications of such figures in broader
societal terms. Though Stanford is
clearly not the only source of these
problems and though other schools fare
equally poorlv, these glaring disparities
require immediate attention and im
provement.
Kacultv and staff statistics are simi
larly disheartening. Less than 6 percent
of all tenured professorships here are
held bv minorities (black and Hispanic)
with onlv a fractional increase achieved
over the past five years. Further, only
6.5 percent of all "tenure-line" pro
fessorships are held bv minorities; this
does not hold much promise for future
increases.
Kacultv members represent very im
portant role models for the student
population. Just as important, how
ever. minority faculty members have a
Special abilitv to provide all of us with
new insights into different attitudes and
cultural perspectives.
Stanford's administration is not ex
actly loaded with minorities in high
places, either. In fact, not a single mi
noritv administrator with rank over C-8
(Stanford's method for ranking staff
personnel goes as high as C-12 or
C-l3)comes to mind. This provides lit
tle encouragement to young minority
administrators, considering potential
long-term commitments to the Univer
sity.
But. these figures, stark as they are,
only tell part of the storv here at Stan
lord. There are other more subtle fac
tors which bear equal consideration in
understanding the general lack of inter
racial communication and awareness.
Tor the average white student here,
race relations and attitudes seem to be a
non-issue. That's something we all need
to take responsibility for changing,
since minority persons are constantly
asked to adapt to a Stanford culture

and environment which is clearly
"white" in nature.
White racism at Stanford seems
basically of the "ignorance" variety. It
is rarely malicious or ugly, with a few
notable exceptions. It stems instead
from our failure to fully respect the cul
tural and social differences between
ourselves and the minority com
munities or to appreciate the adjust
ments which they are forced to make to
live in our "society." Most whites rec
ognize the racial separation and isola
tion in dining halls and residents, but
either accept it or blame it on the minor
ities themselves. Most whites here (and
certainly most Californians or sub
urban dwellers) grew up in com
munities which are fairly isolated racial
ly. Such isolation quite naturally leads
to lack of awareness about racial issues
and the constant adaptations which mi
norities must make in white society; and

'Once here, there's an awful lot ofpeer pressure
from other minorities, who themselves are going
through a similar cultural and racial identification
process for the first time, to separate offfrom the
white community.'

that lack of concern spawns misun
derstanding and mistrust on both sides.
Third World and minority students
here at Stanford do tend to cluster into
racially separate enclaves. Why? First,
there is the aforementioned insensitivi
tv of whites to what it means to be a mi
nority in a white environment. Second,
Stanford enrolls a vastly dispropor
tionate number of middle and upper
class minority students. This is a vital
point, but we prefer to let a black friend
explain it in her terms:
"Minoritv students from relatively
privileged economic backgrounds often
grow up immersed in 'white' society,
being one of the few minorities in their
neighborhood or school. Thus, they
may have never fully identified with
their own racial or ethnic background
until they reach Stanford. Once here,
there's an awful lot of peer pressure
from other minorities, who themselves
are going through a similar cultural and
racial identification process for the first
time, to separate off from the white
community around them. This is far
less true for people who grew up in the
ghetto because they come here already
secure in their particular racial identity.
As such, thev usually don't feel the
same pressures to prove that identity to
themselves and their friends.
"The implications of Stanford's fail
ures to adequately recruit low-income
minorities are prettv major. Individual
minority students are under a lot of
pressure to choose between one world

or the other, and for the most part, the
choice is prettv natural. No matter
which vvav she or he chooses, the indi
vidual risks alienating friends of one
color or the other. It's not a very nice
situation but it's the truth. Just ask any
of your black orChicano friends. There
is a lot of anger, resentment and frustra
tion out there if people are only willing
to look more closely."
Obviously, this is a large and multi
faceted problem. How to start changing
it? Hirst of all, recognize its existence
and start openlv discussing it. Politely
ignoring it or comforting ourselves with
the rationalization that we have some
black or Chicano "friends" builds no
new understanding or awareness.
(ireater efforts on interpersonal
lev els don't tust mean having a friend or
two. How manv whites at Stanford ever
go to black dance, theater, or musical

events? How manv ever try to learn
about the roots and history of Chicano
culture? How manv of us demonstrate
awareness and activism towards politi
cal issues which concern minority com
munities? How many even know what
those issues are? Remember, blacks,
Chicanos and other Third World peo
ple must live in our white world every
day. How much of an effort do we
whites make to learn about their
turc, history and daily reality?
Individual student efforts are ob
viously onlv part of the solution. The
University as a whole, and particularly
the top administration, bears much of
the responsibility for addressing
problem head on. Occasionally, Presi
dent Kennedy mentions it in a speech,
or there's a Campus Report article, but
there are no signs of any real improve
ment. Where are the active recruitment
drives in low-income communities?
Where are the black and Chicano pro
fessors? Where are the top minority ad
ministrators?
All of us here need to recognize that
race relations are an issue that affects
each of our lives, not simply the minor
ity community's. We all bear responsi
bility for breaking down the barriers of
mistrust, miscommunication and mis
understanding that currently exist. If
we do not, we all come out losers in the
educational process.
