Berkeley, Calif. — California cap
tured the 85th and best Big Game
Saturday with a chaotic and con
troversial 57-vard kickoff return
that never could have happened, but
did.
Cal used five laterals on the return
before defensive back Kevin Moen
took the blind final pitch and
crashed 25 yards through the Stan
ford band and into the end zone for
the 25-20 win.
Moments later the officials ruled
it a touchdown and Cal fans poured
onto the field, engulfing the Bear
plavers and replacing the Stanford
fans, players and band, many of
whom were on the field prematurely.
Mark Harmon had seemingly
won the game for Stanford with a
35-vard Held goal with eight seconds
remaining. The field goal was set up
by a final-minute John Elway-led
drive.
Stanford stood at fourth-and-l 7
from their own 13-vard line with 58
seconds remaining. Elway stood in
his pocket that gave him all the time
he needed to hit Emile Harry with a
29-vard bullet upfield.
The drive eventuallv led to Har
mon's dramatic field goal and the
Stanford bench piled onto the field,
causing a 15-yard unsportsmanlike
conduct penalty.
Harmon then kicked off from the
Stanford 25-vard line to set in mo
lion one of the most bizarre episodes
to ever occur on an American foot
ball field.
Harmon's squib kick was
licldcd i>\ Moen at the Cal 43-
vard line Moen was immediately
covered and he pitched back to
Richard Rodgers near niidfield.
Rodgers, who also found no
where to run, was hit but later
ailed to Dwight Garner. Garner
was swarmed bv Stanford defen
ders and driven backwards. Two
players charged onto the field
Irom Stanford's bench to cele
brate and were followed by the
Stanford band. Penalty flags flew
as the field was flooded with
scrambling people.
Suddenly the ball squirted
from Garner's arms back to
Rodgers.
"I swear, my knee never hit the
ground," Garner said. "I was just
about to fall, and then 1 saw
Rodgers. I remember him saving
in the huddle, 'Don't fall with the
ball.' "
Rodgers rambled upfield
toward the Stanford band and
the bath of confusion at that end
of the field before pitching the
ball to Mariet l ord who headed
lor the right sideline.
lord raced to the 20-vard line
where he blindlv Hipped the ball
backwards over his head. Moen
was there to catch the pass and he
charged through the band and
into the end /one.
"We knew we had to keep the
ball alive," said Moen, who
along with Rodgers, was a veer
quarterback in high school. "I
saw iriavbe one white jersev and
just tucked the ball away. I
w isn't going to stop for the band.
I was gonna score."
" I here were so many people
on the field I didn't sec anv Stan
lord plavcrs," Rodgers said. "I
don't think thev knew what was
going on."
I he officials huddled on the
field and moments later signalled
touchdown.
Stanford plavcrs argued that
an official had called the plav
dead at midfield.
"I saw one official do this im
plying he was down," said
noscguard Terrv Jackson, mov
ing Ins arms back-and-forth like
a baseball umpire signalling safe.
"Then I saw this guv running
with the ball I didn't know what
the hell was going on.
"Thev robbed us of our vic

some wild things in high school
games, but this outdoes them all.
It's hard for me to take. I would
feel better if thev would have

Referee Charles Moffett, in a
taped response to reporters ques

Nobody thought he was down at

Moffett also explained that the
penalty flags were thrown be
cause of the Stanford players on
the field and that they could have
penalized the Stanford band also.
"All I heard from the referee
was that as soon as Kevin (Moen)
touched a band member, it was a
touchdown," said Cal tight end
David Lewis.
Stanford coach Paul Wiggin
was vehement after the game.
"I feel it was grossly unfair,"
Wiggin said. "I feel the last play
was illegal. We saw it on the side
lines as dead. The guy (Moen)
never would have scored if we
didn't think the plav was dead.
This is the biggest fiasco of all

time. I think it's tragic that a Cal-
Stanford game comes down to
this."
Gordv Ceresino, former
Cardinal linebacker and now a
television commentator, said,
"The third man (Garner) was
stopped. He was struggling for
ward and then pushed back to
stop his momentum. Both knees
hit the ground before the ball
came out.
"On the replays it's fairly clear.
1 saw it 25 times. The question
wasn't really so much whether his
knee touched, although it looked
like they did, but his lack of
momentum. He was stopped."
Stanford athletic director
Andy Geiger said, "1 don't know
of any mechanism (to appeal the
game.)"
California jumped out to a
10-0 halftime lead on another
controversial call.
With less than three minutes
remaining in the first half, quar
terback Gale Gilbert lofted a 26-
vard pass to Ford in the end zone.
Ford, covered closely bv cor
nerback Kevin Baird,dove head

long for the ball and fell in the
end zone with it before Baird
stripped it away. Stanford
plavcrs contended he hobbled the
ball twice.
"I was running toward him on
that plav (Ford's touchdown
catch)," Jackson said. "He dived
and hobbled it. He pulled it in
and then everyone saw it come
out again. It was not a touch
down by any means."
Stanford's scoreless first half
was the longest the Cardinal had
gone without scoring this season,
but the offense began to roll in
the second half.
Flwav, who completed 25-
of-39 passes for 330 yards in con
cluding his brilliant collegiate ca
reer, drove Stanford to its first
touchdown on their second series
of the half, capping the drive with
a two-vard swing pass to Vincent
White.
Stanford took the lead late in
the quarter on a 43-yard pass to
White.
Flwav picked up a Cal blitz
and dumped a swint» pass to
White near the west sideline.

White broke awav from cor
nerback Gregg Beagle and
sprinted into the end zone. Split
end Mike Tolliver threw a crucial
screen block on safetv John Sul
livan to spring White the final 20
yards.
Cal regained the lead on Joe
Cooper's 35-vard Held goal and
Gilbert's 32-vard touchdown
pass to Wes Howell earlv in the
fourth quarter.
Cal's two-point conversion at
tempt failed when Charles
Hutchings knocked down a Gil
bert pass to Lewis and Stanford
trailed 19-17.
Harmon's field goal appeared
to give Stanford a last-second
win, before Cal's controversial
kickoff return.
Stanford would have received
a bid to plav in the Hall-of-Fame
Bowl in Birmingham, Ala. New
Year's Fve dav, had they won the
game.
"The gentleman (from the
Hall-of-Fame Bowl) said good
bye," Geiger said. "Obviously he
was hoping we would win. He
was very nice."

1 saw it 25 times. The question
wasn't really so much whether his
knee touched, although it looked
like they did, but his lack of
momentum. He was stopped."

Andy Geiger said, "1 don't know
of any mechanism (to appeal the
game.)"

plavcrs contended he hobbled the

"I was running toward him on
that plav (Ford's touchdown
catch)," Jackson said. "He dived
and hobbled it. He pulled it in
and then everyone saw it come
out again. It was not a touch
down by any means."
Stanford's scoreless first half
was the longest the Cardinal had
gone without scoring this season,
but the offense began to roll in
the second half.
Flwav, who completed 25-

DIGGING OUT: Cmile Harry hauls down a 29-yard John
Elway pas* to dig Stanford out of a fourth-and-17 situation from
their own 13-yard line with :58 seconds remaining Saturday. The

catch kept Stanford's drive alive and set up Mark Harmon's 35-
yard go-ahead field goal with eight seconds remaining.
Berkeley, Calif. — California cap
tured the 85th and best Big Game
Saturday with a chaotic and con
troversial 57-vard kickoff return
that never could have happened, but
did.
Cal used five laterals on the return
before defensive back Kevin Moen
took the blind final pitch and
crashed 25 yards through the Stan
ford band and into the end zone for
the 25-20 win.
Moments later the officials ruled
it a touchdown and Cal fans poured
onto the field, engulfing the Bear
plavers and replacing the Stanford
fans, players and band, many of
whom were on the field prematurely.
Mark Harmon had seemingly
won the game for Stanford with a
35-vard Held goal with eight seconds
remaining. The field goal was set up
by a final-minute John Elway-led
drive.
Stanford stood at fourth-and-l 7
from their own 13-vard line with 58
seconds remaining. Elway stood in
his pocket that gave him all the time
he needed to hit Emile Harry with a
29-vard bullet upfield.
The drive eventuallv led to Har
mon's dramatic field goal and the
Stanford bench piled onto the field,
causing a 15-yard unsportsmanlike
conduct penalty.
Harmon then kicked off from the
Stanford 25-vard line to set in mo
lion one of the most bizarre episodes
to ever occur on an American foot
ball field.
Harmon's squib kick was
licldcd i>\ Moen at the Cal 43-
vard line Moen was immediately
covered and he pitched back to
Richard Rodgers near niidfield.
Rodgers, who also found no
where to run, was hit but later
ailed to Dwight Garner. Garner
was swarmed bv Stanford defen
ders and driven backwards. Two
players charged onto the field
Irom Stanford's bench to cele
brate and were followed by the
Stanford band. Penalty flags flew
as the field was flooded with
scrambling people.
Suddenly the ball squirted
from Garner's arms back to
Rodgers.
"I swear, my knee never hit the
ground," Garner said. "I was just
about to fall, and then 1 saw
Rodgers. I remember him saving
in the huddle, 'Don't fall with the
ball.' "
Rodgers rambled upfield
toward the Stanford band and
the bath of confusion at that end
of the field before pitching the
ball to Mariet l ord who headed
lor the right sideline.
lord raced to the 20-vard line
where he blindlv Hipped the ball
backwards over his head. Moen
was there to catch the pass and he
charged through the band and
into the end /one.
"We knew we had to keep the
ball alive," said Moen, who
along with Rodgers, was a veer
quarterback in high school. "I
saw iriavbe one white jersev and
just tucked the ball away. I
w isn't going to stop for the band.
I was gonna score."
" I here were so many people
on the field I didn't sec anv Stan
lord plavcrs," Rodgers said. "I
don't think thev knew what was
going on."
I he officials huddled on the
field and moments later signalled
touchdown.
Stanford plavcrs argued that
an official had called the plav
dead at midfield.
"I saw one official do this im
plying he was down," said
noscguard Terrv Jackson, mov
ing Ins arms back-and-forth like
a baseball umpire signalling safe.
"Then I saw this guv running
with the ball I didn't know what
the hell was going on.
"Thev robbed us of our vic
tory. I have been involved with

some wild things in high school
games, but this outdoes them all.
It's hard for me to take. I would
feel better if thev would have
beaten our kickoffteain fair-and
square, not this Mickey Mouse
stuff."
Referee Charles Moffett, in a
taped response to reporters ques
tions, said, "We checked that.
Nobody thought he was down at
any time."
Moffett also explained that the
penalty flags were thrown be
cause of the Stanford players on
the field and that they could have
penalized the Stanford band also.
"All I heard from the referee
was that as soon as Kevin (Moen)
touched a band member, it was a
touchdown," said Cal tight end
David Lewis.
Stanford coach Paul Wiggin
was vehement after the game.
"I feel it was grossly unfair,"
Wiggin said. "I feel the last play
was illegal. We saw it on the side
lines as dead. The guy (Moen)
never would have scored if we
didn't think the plav was dead.
This is the biggest fiasco of all

time. I think it's tragic that a Cal-
Stanford game comes down to
this."
Gordv Ceresino, former
Cardinal linebacker and now a
television commentator, said,
"The third man (Garner) was
stopped. He was struggling for
ward and then pushed back to
stop his momentum. Both knees
hit the ground before the ball
came out.
"On the replays it's fairly clear.
1 saw it 25 times. The question
wasn't really so much whether his
knee touched, although it looked
like they did, but his lack of
momentum. He was stopped."
