### SID SPAETH 
Berkeley, Calif. â€” California cap
tured the 85th and best Big Game
Saturday with a chaotic and con
troversial 57-vard kickoff return
that never could have happened, but
did.
Cal used five laterals on the return
before defensive back Kevin Moen
took the blind final pitch and
crashed 25 yards through the Stan
ford band and into the end zone for
the 25-20 win.
Moments later the officials ruled
it a touchdown and Cal fans poured
onto the field, engulfing the Bear
plavers and replacing the Stanford
fans, players and band, many of
whom were on the field prematurely.
Mark Harmon had seemingly
won the game for Stanford with a
35-vard Held goal with eight seconds
remaining. The field goal was set up
by a final-minute John Elway-led
drive.
Stanford stood at fourth-and-l 7
from their own 13-vard line with 58
seconds remaining. Elway stood in
his pocket that gave him all the time
he needed to hit Emile Harry with a
29-vard bullet upfield.
The drive eventuallv led to Har
mon's dramatic field goal and the
Stanford bench piled onto the field,
causing a 15-yard unsportsmanlike
conduct penalty.
Harmon then kicked off from the
Stanford 25-vard line to set in mo
lion one of the most bizarre episodes
to ever occur on an American foot
ball field.
