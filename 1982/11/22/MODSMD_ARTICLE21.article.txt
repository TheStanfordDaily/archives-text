# Jerusha Stewart—following a
## dream and designing her future 
### LESLIE WEEDEN 
Jeri Stewart's business card
reads "JERUSHA" in bold
black letters above the legend "a
designing woman" in smaller
italics, accentuated by a metallic
silver background. I.ike the
clothes she designs, the card is
eye-catching and sophisticated.
The name is unusual and the
phrase is ambiguous as if it could
be taken more than literally. The
card represents Stewart well be
cause the wav she looks at ev
erything in life is through the eves
of a designer: one who creates
new patterns from old ones by
the guide of certain rules. She is
currently a third-year law student
at Stanford. She is running her
own design business in between
attending classes.
Since the age of five, when she
began designing one-piece slip
on Barbie doll clothes, Stewart
has wanted to be both a lawyer
and a clothes designer. As an un
dergraduate at Stanford, plan
ning to attend law school, she
tried several majors before settl
ing on international relations and
Afro-American studies.
Dm ing those vears, she helped
pav her *va\ through school bv
designing clothes for friends and
other customers, building a

strong clientele. In addition, she
worked with the Black Per
forming Arts group at Stanford
as a costume designer, making
costumes for such performers as
the African Kuumba Ensemble.
Often Stewart would be in
spired to create something for
herself to capture the essence of a
mood she wanted to portray. She
spent a quarter studying at
Cliveden, where inside the large
stone mansion a dramatic walnut
staircase descends into the main
hall. Jeri wanted to design some
thing would capture the way
she felt while gliding down that
staircase. One night she wore it: a
long scarlet caftan with billowing
sleeves and gold tassels. "Ev
eryone Hipped out," she said,
"and thev all wanted one."
She designed a few more for
specific individuals incorporat
ing their personality traits so that
"no one could wear anyone else's
caftan." She said that one stu
dent who wanted her to make a
fencing shirt, "the kind that Errol
Flynn wears in the pirate mov
ies," got her great tickets to plays
in London so she could sit close
enough to see exactly how the
shirts were made.
That story reveals a great deal
about how Stewart designs

clothes: her ideology is verv re-
Ireshing. She believes that people
should ihink more about the
clothes thev wear because the
wa\ a person dresses is essentially
a statement of their individuality.
She feels that "vou lose a part of
yourself when you let other peo
ple dress vou." Therefore clothes
should be one of a kind, tailored
to lit one's personality. She said,
"I really look at what I am doing
as art; if someone is going to pay
S5OO I think thev should have one
of a kind."
She feels that attention to the
construction of clothing is very
important in order to achieve a
specific look. She has often done
research on the way certain
clothes are made before attempt
ing a certain stvle herself. The
clothing of other countries and
other times are important
sources of inspiration for her.
Stewart has a verv theatrical
mind. Asked about her design
process, she replied, "I think like
I'm costuming a play." Whileshe
said that she vows never to do
costuming for another produc
tion because each actor thinks
that he is the star, she always ends
up doing one more because
"there's something about seeing
the clothes move on stage that's

exhilarating."
Part of her goal in designing is
to create a flow of cloth in move
ment. I he way the fabric drapes
and the way that the angles of the
garment catch the light are part
ol the aesthetic. She aims to
create clothes that are "sea
sonless, timeless and classic,"
but. above all, comfortable and
flexible.

I Icr creations attract attention
because thev are daring; the col
ors are hold and the shapes are
unusual, whether caftans, "bub
bles," tunics, or balloon pants.
She prefers separates which can
be worn in "50 million different
ways" in order to varv the look.
Her fashions are original and
eclectic: The sweaters are a
patchwork of different colors

and textures embodying a rich
tactile quality. She said that she
tries to find fabrics that people
will want to touch. Other
garments mesh together elements
Irom different sources in a
unique way. Stewart is most in
fluenced bv African, Asian and
Polynesian designs — she is from
Hawaii — but she is also very
conscious of current and past

fashion trends.
She would love to go to Africa
to work for inspiration. She pre
fers " Third World people's con
cepts of clothing because it is so
utilitarian: they're taking moreof
comfort." She added, "I've
always thought that the clothes
here are so boring."
Stewart started on the fashion
show circuit last year when a
