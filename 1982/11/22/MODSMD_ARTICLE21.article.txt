# Jerusha Stewart—following a
## dream and designing her future 
### LESLIE WEEDEN 
Jeri Stewart's business card
reads "JERUSHA" in bold
black letters above the legend "a
designing woman" in smaller
italics, accentuated by a metallic
silver background. I.ike the
clothes she designs, the card is
eye-catching and sophisticated.
The name is unusual and the
phrase is ambiguous as if it could
be taken more than literally. The
card represents Stewart well be
cause the wav she looks at ev
erything in life is through the eves
of a designer: one who creates
new patterns from old ones by
the guide of certain rules. She is
currently a third-year law student
at Stanford. She is running her
own design business in between
attending classes.
Since the age of five, when she
began designing one-piece slip
on Barbie doll clothes, Stewart
has wanted to be both a lawyer
and a clothes designer. As an un
dergraduate at Stanford, plan
ning to attend law school, she
tried several majors before settl
ing on international relations and
Afro-American studies.
Dm ing those vears, she helped
pav her *va\ through school bv
designing clothes for friends and
other customers, building a

strong clientele. In addition, she
worked with the Black Per
forming Arts group at Stanford
as a costume designer, making
costumes for such performers as
the African Kuumba Ensemble.
Often Stewart would be in
spired to create something for
herself to capture the essence of a
mood she wanted to portray. She
spent a quarter studying at
Cliveden, where inside the large
stone mansion a dramatic walnut
staircase descends into the main
hall. Jeri wanted to design some
thing would capture the way
she felt while gliding down that
staircase. One night she wore it: a
long scarlet caftan with billowing
sleeves and gold tassels. "Ev
eryone Hipped out," she said,
"and thev all wanted one."
She designed a few more for
specific individuals incorporat
ing their personality traits so that
"no one could wear anyone else's
caftan." She said that one stu
dent who wanted her to make a
fencing shirt, "the kind that Errol
Flynn wears in the pirate mov
ies," got her great tickets to plays
in London so she could sit close
enough to see exactly how the
shirts were made.
That story reveals a great deal
about how Stewart designs

clothes: her ideology is verv re-
Ireshing. She believes that people
should ihink more about the
clothes thev wear because the
wa\ a person dresses is essentially
a statement of their individuality.
She feels that "vou lose a part of
yourself when you let other peo
ple dress vou." Therefore clothes
should be one of a kind, tailored
to lit one's personality. She said,
"I really look at what I am doing
as art; if someone is going to pay
S5OO I think thev should have one
of a kind."
She feels that attention to the
construction of clothing is very
important in order to achieve a
specific look. She has often done
research on the way certain
clothes are made before attempt
ing a certain stvle herself. The
clothing of other countries and
other times are important
sources of inspiration for her.
Stewart has a verv theatrical
mind. Asked about her design
process, she replied, "I think like
I'm costuming a play." Whileshe
said that she vows never to do
costuming for another produc
tion because each actor thinks
that he is the star, she always ends
up doing one more because
"there's something about seeing
the clothes move on stage that's

exhilarating."
Part of her goal in designing is
to create a flow of cloth in move
ment. I he way the fabric drapes
and the way that the angles of the
garment catch the light are part
ol the aesthetic. She aims to
create clothes that are "sea
sonless, timeless and classic,"
but. above all, comfortable and
flexible.

I Icr creations attract attention
because thev are daring; the col
ors are hold and the shapes are
unusual, whether caftans, "bub
bles," tunics, or balloon pants.
She prefers separates which can
be worn in "50 million different
ways" in order to varv the look.
Her fashions are original and
eclectic: The sweaters are a
patchwork of different colors

and textures embodying a rich
tactile quality. She said that she
tries to find fabrics that people
will want to touch. Other
garments mesh together elements
Irom different sources in a
unique way. Stewart is most in
fluenced bv African, Asian and
Polynesian designs — she is from
Hawaii — but she is also very
conscious of current and past

fashion trends.
She would love to go to Africa
to work for inspiration. She pre
fers " Third World people's con
cepts of clothing because it is so
utilitarian: they're taking moreof
comfort." She added, "I've
always thought that the clothes
here are so boring."
Stewart started on the fashion
show circuit last year when a

friend asked her to contribute to
a show that she was putting to
gether in San Jose. Store buyers
who showed interest in her de
signs offered her contacts. Since
then *he has continued doing
fashion shows at discos, restau
rants and hotels in San Jose and
San Francisco. Last May she had
a show at the Coffee House at
Stanford which she described as a

"marvelous success." In general,
she feels that her work has gotten
successively better and has been
very pleased with the response
that it has elicited, being "the
show stealer" in most of the
shows that she has participated
in.
Stewart works with four
models, as well as modeling
herself on occasion, although she

usually does the commentating at
her shows. Her models were
chosen for their un-model-like
characteristics, their presence
and stvle. She also works with a
business manager, Jacqueline
Howard, a Ph.l) candidate in po
litical science at Stanford.
Stewart has learned to work
quickly. She recounted a story in
volving her friend and model,

Cecilia Mowatt, who graduated
last year from Stanford. Cecilia
had asked Stewart a week in ad
vance to make a dress for her for
a special function in San Francis
co. The night it was supposed to
he ready, she called early in the
evening. Stewart had totally for
gotten, hut not wanting to disap
point her friend, she said, "Oh
... it just needs a few alterations.

I'll bring it over in an hour." In
that hour, Stewart whipped up a
beautiful white silk dress with a
dramatic white plunging
neckline, pleats and puffed
sleeves. Laughing, she adds, "1
usuallv do everything for a fash
ion show the night before. I get
real intense and stav up all
night." This is a technique Stew
art might well have developed
from being at Stanford for so
long.
Upcoming plans include a
show in San Francisco over
Thanks giving and an eight-day
fashion show tour in Barbados
over the Christmas holidays. She
plans to have a big show on cam
pus in February during Black
Liberation month and is also
considering doing shows in
dorms and benefits for campus
organizations.
Currently, she has no contracts
with clothing shops, although she
is helping to design sweaters for a
company in San Francisco. She is
at a point of deciding in which
direction she wants her design
work to move. Manufacturing
firms with which she is nego
tiating in New York, advise her
that she is working with too

many styles at oncc. Consequent
ly, she is trving to decide what she
thinks is her forte in order to
make up a portfolio.
Given her idealistic notions
about how individualized
clothing should be, she has a dif
ficult lime digesting the mass
market approach. She never
wants her sweater to be machine
knit or allows more than a few
identical garments to be made,
except perhaps distributed on a
regional basis. Manufacturing
firms want her to learn to sketch
better. Thev feel that it would
take too long for her to make a
sample of everv design and send
it. But for Stewart, communing
with the fabric is an essential
component of the design process.
"It's a sensorv tvpe thing," she
insisited. Basicallv, she is afraid
of losina control "I'm worried
ibout creating art while they're
worried about profits."
Alter graduating from law
school this spring. Stewart plans
to stav in the area and hopefully
support herself designing clothes.
However, she also has ideas
about starting a law firm for part
time lawyers. She sees law as
closely related to design in the

sense that they arc both problem
solving situations. She feels
strongly that lawyers should be
more creative in approaching
cases and is seriously considering
writing a book on this topic.
Stewart does not envision
herself following a single career,
but rather moving from one oc
cupation to another for five-year
periods, vet always revolving
around the problem-solving
mode. She hopeseventuallv to in
volve herself in u career with an
international scope, possibly
diplomacy, which would bring
her "lull-circle" back to her un
dergraduate studies.
At Stanford, Stewart is a mem
ber of the Trustee Committee on
Academic Affairs and the Uni
versity Committee on Overseas
Studies. Kxplaining how she pos
sibly has lime to do everything
she does she said, "I have a lot of
energy. I use all my time." She
even keeps a sketch pad by her
bed at night in case any great
ideas emerge at night. Reflecting
on how many years she has been
at Stanford, she laughed and said
cynically, "I owe everything I am
to Stanford."

clothes thev wear because the
wa\ a person dresses is essentially
a statement of their individuality.
She feels that "vou lose a part of
yourself when you let other peo
ple dress vou." Therefore clothes
should be one of a kind, tailored
to lit one's personality. She said,
"I really look at what I am doing
as art; if someone is going to pay
S5OO I think thev should have one
of a kind."
She feels that attention to the
construction of clothing is very
important in order to achieve a
specific look. She has often done
research on the way certain
clothes are made before attempt
ing a certain stvle herself. The
clothing of other countries and
other times are important
sources of inspiration for her.
Stewart has a verv theatrical
mind. Asked about her design
process, she replied, "I think like
I'm costuming a play." Whileshe
said that she vows never to do
costuming for another produc
tion because each actor thinks
that he is the star, she always ends
up doing one more because
"there's something about seeing
the clothes move on stage that's

exhilarating."
Part of her goal in designing is
to create a flow of cloth in move
ment. I he way the fabric drapes
and the way that the angles of the
garment catch the light are part
ol the aesthetic. She aims to
create clothes that are "sea
sonless, timeless and classic,"
but. above all, comfortable and
flexible.

I Icr creations attract attention
because thev are daring; the col
ors are hold and the shapes are
unusual, whether caftans, "bub
bles," tunics, or balloon pants.
She prefers separates which can
be worn in "50 million different
ways" in order to varv the look.
Her fashions are original and
eclectic: The sweaters are a
patchwork of different colors

and textures embodying a rich
tactile quality. She said that she
tries to find fabrics that people
will want to touch. Other
garments mesh together elements
Irom different sources in a
unique way. Stewart is most in
fluenced bv African, Asian and
Polynesian designs — she is from
Hawaii — but she is also very
conscious of current and past

fashion trends.
She would love to go to Africa
to work for inspiration. She pre
fers " Third World people's con
cepts of clothing because it is so
utilitarian: they're taking moreof
comfort." She added, "I've
always thought that the clothes
here are so boring."
Stewart started on the fashion
show circuit last year when a

friend asked her to contribute to
a show that she was putting to
gether in San Jose. Store buyers
who showed interest in her de
signs offered her contacts. Since
then *he has continued doing
fashion shows at discos, restau
rants and hotels in San Jose and
San Francisco. Last May she had
a show at the Coffee House at
Stanford which she described as a

"marvelous success." In general,
she feels that her work has gotten
successively better and has been
very pleased with the response
that it has elicited, being "the
show stealer" in most of the
shows that she has participated
in.
Stewart works with four
models, as well as modeling
herself on occasion, although she

usually does the commentating at
her shows. Her models were
chosen for their un-model-like
characteristics, their presence
and stvle. She also works with a
business manager, Jacqueline
Howard, a Ph.l) candidate in po
litical science at Stanford.
Stewart has learned to work
quickly. She recounted a story in
volving her friend and model,

Cecilia Mowatt, who graduated
last year from Stanford. Cecilia
had asked Stewart a week in ad
vance to make a dress for her for
a special function in San Francis
co. The night it was supposed to
he ready, she called early in the
evening. Stewart had totally for
gotten, hut not wanting to disap
point her friend, she said, "Oh
... it just needs a few alterations.

I'll bring it over in an hour." In
that hour, Stewart whipped up a
beautiful white silk dress with a
dramatic white plunging
neckline, pleats and puffed
sleeves. Laughing, she adds, "1
usuallv do everything for a fash
ion show the night before. I get
real intense and stav up all
night." This is a technique Stew
art might well have developed
from being at Stanford for so
long.
Upcoming plans include a
show in San Francisco over
Thanks giving and an eight-day
fashion show tour in Barbados
over the Christmas holidays. She
plans to have a big show on cam
pus in February during Black
Liberation month and is also
considering doing shows in
dorms and benefits for campus
organizations.
Currently, she has no contracts
with clothing shops, although she
is helping to design sweaters for a
company in San Francisco. She is
at a point of deciding in which
direction she wants her design
work to move. Manufacturing
firms with which she is nego
tiating in New York, advise her
that she is working with too

many styles at oncc. Consequent
ly, she is trving to decide what she
thinks is her forte in order to
make up a portfolio.
Given her idealistic notions
about how individualized
clothing should be, she has a dif
ficult lime digesting the mass
market approach. She never
wants her sweater to be machine
knit or allows more than a few
identical garments to be made,
except perhaps distributed on a
regional basis. Manufacturing
firms want her to learn to sketch
better. Thev feel that it would
take too long for her to make a
sample of everv design and send
it. But for Stewart, communing
with the fabric is an essential
component of the design process.
"It's a sensorv tvpe thing," she
insisited. Basicallv, she is afraid
of losina control "I'm worried
ibout creating art while they're
worried about profits."
Alter graduating from law
school this spring. Stewart plans
to stav in the area and hopefully
support herself designing clothes.
However, she also has ideas
about starting a law firm for part
time lawyers. She sees law as
closely related to design in the

sense that they arc both problem
solving situations. She feels
strongly that lawyers should be
more creative in approaching
cases and is seriously considering
writing a book on this topic.
Stewart does not envision
herself following a single career,
but rather moving from one oc
cupation to another for five-year
periods, vet always revolving
around the problem-solving
mode. She hopeseventuallv to in
volve herself in u career with an
international scope, possibly
diplomacy, which would bring
her "lull-circle" back to her un
dergraduate studies.
At Stanford, Stewart is a mem
ber of the Trustee Committee on
Academic Affairs and the Uni
versity Committee on Overseas
Studies. Kxplaining how she pos
sibly has lime to do everything
she does she said, "I have a lot of
energy. I use all my time." She
even keeps a sketch pad by her
bed at night in case any great
ideas emerge at night. Reflecting
on how many years she has been
at Stanford, she laughed and said
cynically, "I owe everything I am
to Stanford."

Jeri Stewart's business card
reads "JERUSHA" in bold
black letters above the legend "a
designing woman" in smaller
italics, accentuated by a metallic
silver background. I.ike the
clothes she designs, the card is
eye-catching and sophisticated.
The name is unusual and the
phrase is ambiguous as if it could
be taken more than literally. The
card represents Stewart well be
cause the wav she looks at ev
erything in life is through the eves
of a designer: one who creates
new patterns from old ones by
the guide of certain rules. She is
currently a third-year law student
at Stanford. She is running her
own design business in between
attending classes.
Since the age of five, when she
began designing one-piece slip
on Barbie doll clothes, Stewart
has wanted to be both a lawyer
and a clothes designer. As an un
dergraduate at Stanford, plan
ning to attend law school, she
tried several majors before settl
ing on international relations and
Afro-American studies.
Dm ing those vears, she helped
pav her *va\ through school bv
designing clothes for friends and
other customers, building a

strong clientele. In addition, she
worked with the Black Per
forming Arts group at Stanford
as a costume designer, making
costumes for such performers as
the African Kuumba Ensemble.
Often Stewart would be in
spired to create something for
herself to capture the essence of a
mood she wanted to portray. She
spent a quarter studying at
Cliveden, where inside the large
stone mansion a dramatic walnut
staircase descends into the main
hall. Jeri wanted to design some
thing would capture the way
she felt while gliding down that
staircase. One night she wore it: a
long scarlet caftan with billowing
sleeves and gold tassels. "Ev
eryone Hipped out," she said,
"and thev all wanted one."
She designed a few more for
specific individuals incorporat
ing their personality traits so that
"no one could wear anyone else's
caftan." She said that one stu
dent who wanted her to make a
fencing shirt, "the kind that Errol
Flynn wears in the pirate mov
ies," got her great tickets to plays
in London so she could sit close
enough to see exactly how the
shirts were made.
That story reveals a great deal
about how Stewart designs

clothes: her ideology is verv re-
Ireshing. She believes that people
should ihink more about the
clothes thev wear because the
wa\ a person dresses is essentially
a statement of their individuality.

always thought that the clothes
here are so boring."
Stewart started on the fashion
show circuit last year when a

friend asked her to contribute to
a show that she was putting to
gether in San Jose. Store buyers
who showed interest in her de
signs offered her contacts. Since
then *he has continued doing
fashion shows at discos, restau
rants and hotels in San Jose and
San Francisco. Last May she had
a show at the Coffee House at
Stanford which she described as a

"marvelous success." In general,
she feels that her work has gotten
successively better and has been
very pleased with the response
that it has elicited, being "the
show stealer" in most of the
shows that she has participated
in.
Stewart works with four
models, as well as modeling
herself on occasion, although she

usually does the commentating at
her shows. Her models were
chosen for their un-model-like
characteristics, their presence
and stvle. She also works with a
business manager, Jacqueline
Howard, a Ph.l) candidate in po
litical science at Stanford.
Stewart has learned to work
quickly. She recounted a story in
volving her friend and model,

Cecilia Mowatt, who graduated
last year from Stanford. Cecilia
had asked Stewart a week in ad
vance to make a dress for her for
a special function in San Francis
co. The night it was supposed to
he ready, she called early in the
evening. Stewart had totally for
gotten, hut not wanting to disap
point her friend, she said, "Oh
... it just needs a few alterations.

I'll bring it over in an hour." In
that hour, Stewart whipped up a
beautiful white silk dress with a
dramatic white plunging
neckline, pleats and puffed
sleeves. Laughing, she adds, "1
usuallv do everything for a fash
ion show the night before. I get
real intense and stav up all
night." This is a technique Stew
art might well have developed
from being at Stanford for so
long.
Upcoming plans include a
show in San Francisco over
Thanks giving and an eight-day
fashion show tour in Barbados
over the Christmas holidays. She
plans to have a big show on cam
pus in February during Black
Liberation month and is also
considering doing shows in
dorms and benefits for campus
organizations.
Currently, she has no contracts
with clothing shops, although she
is helping to design sweaters for a
company in San Francisco. She is
at a point of deciding in which
direction she wants her design
work to move. Manufacturing
firms with which she is nego
tiating in New York, advise her
that she is working with too

many styles at oncc. Consequent
ly, she is trving to decide what she
thinks is her forte in order to
make up a portfolio.
Given her idealistic notions
about how individualized
clothing should be, she has a dif
ficult lime digesting the mass
market approach. She never
wants her sweater to be machine
knit or allows more than a few
identical garments to be made,
except perhaps distributed on a
regional basis. Manufacturing
firms want her to learn to sketch
better. Thev feel that it would
take too long for her to make a
sample of everv design and send
it. But for Stewart, communing
with the fabric is an essential
component of the design process.
"It's a sensorv tvpe thing," she
insisited. Basicallv, she is afraid
of losina control "I'm worried
ibout creating art while they're
worried about profits."
Alter graduating from law
school this spring. Stewart plans
to stav in the area and hopefully
support herself designing clothes.
However, she also has ideas
about starting a law firm for part
time lawyers. She sees law as
closely related to design in the

sense that they arc both problem
solving situations. She feels
strongly that lawyers should be
more creative in approaching
cases and is seriously considering
writing a book on this topic.
Stewart does not envision
herself following a single career,
but rather moving from one oc
cupation to another for five-year
periods, vet always revolving
around the problem-solving
mode. She hopeseventuallv to in
volve herself in u career with an
international scope, possibly
diplomacy, which would bring
her "lull-circle" back to her un
dergraduate studies.
At Stanford, Stewart is a mem
ber of the Trustee Committee on
Academic Affairs and the Uni
versity Committee on Overseas
Studies. Kxplaining how she pos
sibly has lime to do everything
she does she said, "I have a lot of
energy. I use all my time." She
even keeps a sketch pad by her
bed at night in case any great
ideas emerge at night. Reflecting
on how many years she has been
at Stanford, she laughed and said
cynically, "I owe everything I am
to Stanford."

Jeri Stewart's business card
reads "JERUSHA" in bold
black letters above the legend "a
designing woman" in smaller
italics, accentuated by a metallic
silver background. I.ike the
clothes she designs, the card is
eye-catching and sophisticated.
The name is unusual and the
phrase is ambiguous as if it could
be taken more than literally. The
card represents Stewart well be
cause the wav she looks at ev
erything in life is through the eves
of a designer: one who creates
new patterns from old ones by
the guide of certain rules. She is
currently a third-year law student
at Stanford. She is running her
own design business in between
attending classes.
Since the age of five, when she
began designing one-piece slip
on Barbie doll clothes, Stewart
has wanted to be both a lawyer
and a clothes designer. As an un
dergraduate at Stanford, plan
ning to attend law school, she
tried several majors before settl
ing on international relations and
Afro-American studies.
Dm ing those vears, she helped
pav her *va\ through school bv
designing clothes for friends and
other customers, building a

strong clientele. In addition, she
worked with the Black Per
forming Arts group at Stanford
as a costume designer, making
costumes for such performers as
the African Kuumba Ensemble.
Often Stewart would be in
spired to create something for
herself to capture the essence of a
mood she wanted to portray. She
spent a quarter studying at
Cliveden, where inside the large
stone mansion a dramatic walnut
staircase descends into the main
hall. Jeri wanted to design some
thing would capture the way
she felt while gliding down that
staircase. One night she wore it: a
long scarlet caftan with billowing
sleeves and gold tassels. "Ev
eryone Hipped out," she said,
"and thev all wanted one."
She designed a few more for
specific individuals incorporat
ing their personality traits so that
"no one could wear anyone else's
caftan." She said that one stu
dent who wanted her to make a
fencing shirt, "the kind that Errol
Flynn wears in the pirate mov
ies," got her great tickets to plays
in London so she could sit close
enough to see exactly how the
shirts were made.
That story reveals a great deal
about how Stewart designs

clothes: her ideology is verv re-
Ireshing. She believes that people
should ihink more about the
clothes thev wear because the
wa\ a person dresses is essentially
a statement of their individuality.
She feels that "vou lose a part of
yourself when you let other peo
ple dress vou." Therefore clothes
should be one of a kind, tailored
to lit one's personality. She said,
"I really look at what I am doing
as art; if someone is going to pay
S5OO I think thev should have one
of a kind."
She feels that attention to the
construction of clothing is very
important in order to achieve a
specific look. She has often done
research on the way certain
clothes are made before attempt
ing a certain stvle herself. The
clothing of other countries and
other times are important
sources of inspiration for her.
Stewart has a verv theatrical
mind. Asked about her design
process, she replied, "I think like
I'm costuming a play." Whileshe
said that she vows never to do
costuming for another produc
tion because each actor thinks
that he is the star, she always ends
up doing one more because
"there's something about seeing
the clothes move on stage that's

exhilarating."
Part of her goal in designing is
to create a flow of cloth in move
ment. I he way the fabric drapes
and the way that the angles of the
garment catch the light are part
ol the aesthetic. She aims to
create clothes that are "sea
sonless, timeless and classic,"
but. above all, comfortable and
flexible.

I Icr creations attract attention
because thev are daring; the col
ors are hold and the shapes are
unusual, whether caftans, "bub
bles," tunics, or balloon pants.
She prefers separates which can
be worn in "50 million different
ways" in order to varv the look.
Her fashions are original and
eclectic: The sweaters are a
patchwork of different colors

and textures embodying a rich
tactile quality. She said that she
tries to find fabrics that people
will want to touch. Other
garments mesh together elements
Irom different sources in a
unique way. Stewart is most in
fluenced bv African, Asian and
Polynesian designs — she is from
Hawaii — but she is also very
conscious of current and past

fashion trends.
She would love to go to Africa
to work for inspiration. She pre
fers " Third World people's con
cepts of clothing because it is so
utilitarian: they're taking moreof
comfort." She added, "I've
always thought that the clothes
here are so boring."
