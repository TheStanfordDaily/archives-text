### 


CUTTING THROUGH THE CROWD: Stanford running
back Vincent White slices through a crowd for some of his 75
yards rushing. White also caught 9 passes for 77 yards and
scored two touchdowns. White scored eight Big Game touch
downs in his career at Stanford.

FORGOTTEN HERO: Stanford placekicker Mark Harmon
unleashes his 35-yard field goal with eight seconds remaining in
Saturday's 25-20 loss to California. The field goal gave Stanford
a one point lead with four seconds to play.


???: Stanford assistant coach Larry Mac Duff points to a penalty flag and asks
the official what it is for after the Bears had completed a bizarre 57-yard kickoff
return to win the game. Head coach Paul Wiggin and his players look on in dls-

belief as the penalty goes against Stanford and the officials allow the Cal touch
down to stand giving the Bears a 25-20 win in the wildest Big Game of til-time.
