## The 						nightmare play 
### 
Berkeley, Calif. — The
nightmare unfolded with un
merciful slowness. Each later
al was a blurred vision, each
step toward the goal line an
echoing scream.
There was no sound, no
awareness by the mad throng
witnessing the plav. All senses
were dulled as if anesthetized,
but when California's Kevin
Moen crossed the goal line
and sent a Stanford band
member flying, the needle was
ripped out with a sudden jerk.
Suddenly, there was noise,
and light, and activity.

The Odes Factor

Stanford coaches Paul Wig
gin and Chuck Detwiler tore
through the crowd, the looks
on their faces filled with dis
belief after Cal had dramati
cally pulled off a 57-yard kick
off return with four seconds
left. Wiggin and Detwiler
bounded up the steps of the
TV trailer and watched the
nightmare unravel again.
"He was down, down!"
yelled Detwiler from the
truck. Just as quickly as the
two had entered, the two left
and stormed to the officials'
locker room.
They were intercepted by
athletic director Andy Geiger,
and the trio fought their way
through the crowd. Thev
weaved through the pitch
black tunnel tothe field. Light
crept in from the end and
outlined three Stanford sen
iors, sitting on the ground,
heads in their hands.
Wiggin and Geiger were let
in the officials'# dressing
room and spent five minutes
behind closed doors. "Thev
had no comment," said
(ieiger.
An explanation was de
manded of the nightmare, of
the third lateral when it ap
peared that Dwight Garner's
knees touched the ground, or
at least his forward progress
impeded. "We checked that,"
came the answer on a taped
statement from referee

Charles Moffett. "Nobody
thought he was down at any
time."
Neither side could believe
it. Stanford was dumb
founded, Cal amazed.
"The guy just kept run
ning," said Stanford senior
Jon Carroll, on the field dur
ing the nightmare.
"I swore the man was down
and the game was over," he
continued. "We let up for a
second, then starting chasing,
but everybody was in the way.
"The guy just kept run
ning."
Cardinal linebacker Garin
Veris summed up the general
feeling of the team. "It's going
to go down in history as a Cal
victory, but in our hearts, we
know we won."
Senior halfback Vincent
White echoed his teammate.
"We don't feel like we really
lost that game," said White.
"They didn't beat us. Their
band was out there, too. Peo
ple were all over the field. One
of the officials said that he had
called it down. When he does
that the ball is dead."
Gordv Ceresino, a former
Stanford football player and
television commentator, said
he watched the replay 10or 12
times. "There's no question
that he was down," he said.
"Five guvs had him pushing
him backwards I'm sure I saw
the official do this (cross his
arms signaling the play was
over) out there."
Wiggin was livid.
"I think this is the biggest
fiasco of all time," he said. "I
think it's tragic that a Cal-
Stanford game comes down to
this."
I left with four seconds left.
I came home and went to bed
with a smile on my face,
knowing ihe Axe was still
Stanford property. The rest
was a sick fantasy. A sadistic
joke. A nightmare.
But I never woke up to have
my fears alleviated. Cal had
won. The nightmare was reali
ty.

An explanation was de
manded of the nightmare, of
the third lateral when it ap
peared that Dwight Garner's
knees touched the ground, or
at least his forward progress
impeded. "We checked that,"
came the answer on a taped
statement from referee

Charles Moffett. "Nobody
thought he was down at any
time."
Neither side could believe
it. Stanford was dumb
founded, Cal amazed.
"The guy just kept run
ning," said Stanford senior
Jon Carroll, on the field dur
ing the nightmare.
"I swore the man was down
and the game was over," he
continued. "We let up for a
second, then starting chasing,
but everybody was in the way.
"The guy just kept run
ning."
Cardinal linebacker Garin
Veris summed up the general
feeling of the team. "It's going
to go down in history as a Cal
victory, but in our hearts, we
know we won."
Senior halfback Vincent
White echoed his teammate.
"We don't feel like we really
lost that game," said White.
"They didn't beat us. Their
band was out there, too. Peo
ple were all over the field. One
of the officials said that he had
called it down. When he does
that the ball is dead."
Gordv Ceresino, a former
Stanford football player and
television commentator, said
he watched the replay 10or 12
times. "There's no question
that he was down," he said.
"Five guvs had him pushing
him backwards I'm sure I saw
the official do this (cross his
arms signaling the play was
over) out there."
Wiggin was livid.
"I think this is the biggest
fiasco of all time," he said. "I
think it's tragic that a Cal-
Stanford game comes down to
this."
I left with four seconds left.
I came home and went to bed
with a smile on my face,
knowing ihe Axe was still
Stanford property. The rest
was a sick fantasy. A sadistic
joke. A nightmare.
But I never woke up to have
my fears alleviated. Cal had
won. The nightmare was reali
ty.
