# The 						greatest ends in the pits

### ADAM BERNS 
Berkeley, Calif. — This is the
way the world ends. Not with a
bang, but a whimper. — T.S. Eliot
And so ends the career of Stan
ford quarterback John Elway.
The greatest quarterback in col
legiate football history would
never play in a bowl, having it
taken away from him in the final
four seconds.
As a group of reporters quietly
waited outside the locker room,
no one knew what to expect from
Elway. Would it be dejection?
Would it be like the Arizona, Ari
zona State and UCLA games?
Would Elwav be devastated?
It was none of these.
Elway came out of the locker
room some 20 minutes or more
after the game. He said he needed
time to think.
But his emotion was unques
tionable. Behind the calm, poised
quarterback accustomed to talk
ing to the press, Elwav was angry.
The anger of someone who had
just had something taken away.
It was the anger of someone
knowing that something of his
• had been unrightfully stolen.

"This game was a farce,"
Elwav said. "It's an insult to col
lege football. It's just a farce.
"I don't believe that thev (the
officials) can take something
away like that. I've seen the tape
three times and there is no doubt
that the guv was down.
"They (the officials) took the
game away from us. It's un
believable."
Unbelievable was the right
word. But Elwav's anger ran
deeper than that. Something was
definitelv wrong here Elway
clearlv saw a referee call the plav
dead, yet it seemed he was in
timidated bv the California fans
who had alreadv stormed the
field.
"Something has to be done
about the referees," Elwav flatlv
stated. "But what really burns me
up is that all thev have to do is
stand up and admit that thev
uere wrong. On the TV thing, the
referee clearly waved his hands.
All the guv has to sav is ves, I
called it wrong."
But it was not just one call that
made Elwav mad. Elwav said the
officiation was poor all dav.
"He (Ford) did not have con
trol," Elwav said, referring to the

first touchdown catch bv Mariet
Ford. "Mariet Ford picked the
hall off the ground."
The game left Elwav emo
tionally stunned. !t was not like
losing, certainlv not like winning,
but also distinctly different from
a tie.
"I don't feel like a winner, and
I don't feel like a loser," Elwav
said. "We still are in limbo as to
whether we won or lost."
Athletic director Andv Geiger
later admitted that he knows of
no recourse to appeal the game,
but like any good quarterback —
make that great quarterback —
the game is not over till the gun
sounds, and in Elwav's mind, it
had not sounded.
"We are going to fight this ev
ery way we can," Elwav said.
Elwav learned a hard lesson
Saturday. Life is not always fair.
Somehow his 330 vards of pass
ing did not seem to make much
difference.
"I did not want to end it this
wav," Elwav said, letting sadness
for a few quick seconds drown his
anger. "This is my last game, the
one I'll alwavs remember."


GOING OUT IN STYLE: John Elway fires one of his 39 passes over the outstretched arms of
blitzing cornerback Gregg Beagle. Elway completed 25 passes for 330 yards including a dramatic
29-yard completion to Emile Harry on fourth-and-17 from his own 13-yard line to sustain the
drive that ended in Mark Harmon's go-ahead field goal with eight seconds remaining.

quarterback accustomed to talk
ing to the press, Elwav was angry.
The anger of someone who had
just had something taken away.
It was the anger of someone
knowing that something of his
• had been unrightfully stolen.

"This game was a farce,"
Elwav said. "It's an insult to col
lege football. It's just a farce.
"I don't believe that thev (the
officials) can take something
away like that. I've seen the tape
three times and there is no doubt
that the guv was down.
"They (the officials) took the
game away from us. It's un
believable."
Unbelievable was the right
word. But Elwav's anger ran
deeper than that. Something was
definitelv wrong here Elway
clearlv saw a referee call the plav
dead, yet it seemed he was in
timidated bv the California fans
who had alreadv stormed the
field.
"Something has to be done
about the referees," Elwav flatlv
stated. "But what really burns me
up is that all thev have to do is
stand up and admit that thev
uere wrong. On the TV thing, the
referee clearly waved his hands.
All the guv has to sav is ves, I
called it wrong."
But it was not just one call that
made Elwav mad. Elwav said the
officiation was poor all dav.
"He (Ford) did not have con
trol," Elwav said, referring to the

first touchdown catch bv Mariet
Ford. "Mariet Ford picked the
hall off the ground."
The game left Elwav emo
tionally stunned. !t was not like
losing, certainlv not like winning,
but also distinctly different from
a tie.
"I don't feel like a winner, and
I don't feel like a loser," Elwav
said. "We still are in limbo as to
whether we won or lost."
Athletic director Andv Geiger
later admitted that he knows of
no recourse to appeal the game,
but like any good quarterback —
make that great quarterback —
the game is not over till the gun
sounds, and in Elwav's mind, it
had not sounded.
"We are going to fight this ev
ery way we can," Elwav said.
Elwav learned a hard lesson
Saturday. Life is not always fair.
Somehow his 330 vards of pass
ing did not seem to make much
difference.
"I did not want to end it this
wav," Elwav said, letting sadness
for a few quick seconds drown his
anger. "This is my last game, the
one I'll alwavs remember."


GOING OUT IN STYLE: John Elway fires one of his 39 passes over the outstretched arms of
blitzing cornerback Gregg Beagle. Elway completed 25 passes for 330 yards including a dramatic
29-yard completion to Emile Harry on fourth-and-17 from his own 13-yard line to sustain the
drive that ended in Mark Harmon's go-ahead field goal with eight seconds remaining.
