## Stanford celebration early; Cal's was fake 
### 
Berkeley, Calif. — That anything can
and will happen in a Big Game was proven
again the other day at Memorial Stadium
when Stanford's players and band failed
to win the game and celebrate in the nor
mal chronological order.
Cal won the 85th Big Game classic
25-20 on a five-pitch, controversial and
bizarre kickoff return with time elapsed.
Berkeley's Kevin Moen guaranteed
himself trivia-question status for eternity
when he charged through the final 25
yards of the chaos on the field and scored
the winning touchdown.

The Sporting Muse

Stanford's Mark Harmon was a hero
for the four previous seconds after kicking
a 35-vard field goal with that much time
remaining.
Freeze the moment. Harmon stands
two steps away from his holder Steve Cot
trell who is kneeling seven yards behind
his snapper Mike Teeuws. Cottrell looks
back at Harmon. "Ready?" Harmon
glances one final time over his left shoul
der at the posts and then back at his tee.
The snap is perfect, the hold is perfect and
so is the kick.
Bedlam.
Harmon now kicks off from his own 25-
vard line because Stanford was penalized
for having players on the field celebrating.
He does what he has been told and boots a
low, chopping squib kick that is going to
be hard to handle.
Moen picks it up with orders not to go
down with the football. As he is about to
be tackled he laterals to Richard Rodgers.
Rodgers gets nowhere and laterals back to
freshman Dwight Garner. Time is now
elapsed.
Garner is swarmed on near midfield and
begins to fall backwards.
The Stanford band roars onto the field
and so do two players from the Cardinal

bench. Stanford defenders said they saw
an official call Garner down and they relax
their pursuit. Penalty flags fly everywhere,
hut Garner flips the ball out to Rodgers,
who heads upfield directly into the chaotic
mass of the Stanford band. Rodgers
crosses midfield and, at the 46-vard line,
loops the ball back to Mariet Ford before
being tackled. Ford races to the 20 where
he blindly flips the ball backwards over his
head. Moen catches the ball and crashes
the final 25 yards through the LSJUMB
and into the end zone, capping his jaunt by
trampling Stanford trombone plaverGary
Tvrell. An official signals touchdown.
Bedlam.
Cal fans pour onto the field and Stan
ford fans will not leave. Cardinal players
stare aghast at the Cal celebration.
Freeze the moment. Stanford' coach
Paul Wiggin storms through the tunnel to
the outside walkway where he is pushing
himself through the dazed, euphoric
crowd. Wiggin and some of his assistant
coaches charge into a television trailer to
see the replay.
Defensive back coach Chuck Detwiler
responds first, slamming his fists into a
table.
"He's down! Down! Bastards!"
The coaches trample out of the trailer
and back through the Berkeley crowd.
Wiggin weaves back through the tunnel to
the field picking his way over some of his
players who are sitting in the pitch black
tunnel, head in hands, crying.
Thev were emotionally empty.
Cal players had left the field and re
turned with The Axe.
"We got The Axe! We got the Axe!"
Something was wrong in the Cal locker
room. Players celebrated like they are sup
posed to, said things they are supposed to,
but not what they felt.
They were emotionally empty.
"All I heard from the referee was that as

soon as Kevin (Moen) touched a band
member it was a touchdown," said tight
end David Lewis.
Then, thanks to the band, an idiot asked
him.
"No, thanks to our team for not giving
up."
The sound was not mixing with the vis
ual.
Joe Kapp was talking like a coach. One
of the most flambovant plavers in history
was now a coach and he was talking like
one. His lips were moving, but he wasn't
saying anything. He had witnessed the
most incredible Big Game ever, and he
was talking like it was routine.
"It's just a great moment for these
men," Kapp said. "Our goal all season
was to play 60 minutes of football. It's a
tribute to the effort all season long and we
earned everv single thing."
But Joe, is that it? Wasn't that the
greatest game vou've ever seen, the idiot
asked.
"I didn't say that," Kapp said and re
moved his press face and walked back to
his players who were uneasily celebrating.
Freeze the moment.
Kapp hugs Rodgers and says in his ear,
"Why can't vou guvs do it in 60 minutes?"
After 30 minutes, someone remembers
to roll out the champagne. Moen stops in
mid-sentence as he remembers to pull out
a victory cigar from his locker.
Kapp steps out onto the balcony and
looks down at the thousands of fans as
they stream home. They look at him like
he is bigger than life.
You can almost hear them think, "Tell
us it's real, Joe."
Kapp starts to lead a cheer and it makes
them happv because now they know it's
real. It can't be taken back.
Thev weren't sure before.

Berkeley's Kevin Moen guaranteed
himself trivia-question status for eternity
when he charged through the final 25
yards of the chaos on the field and scored
the winning touchdown.

The Sporting Muse

Stanford's Mark Harmon was a hero
for the four previous seconds after kicking
a 35-vard field goal with that much time
remaining.
Freeze the moment. Harmon stands
two steps away from his holder Steve Cot
trell who is kneeling seven yards behind
his snapper Mike Teeuws. Cottrell looks
back at Harmon. "Ready?" Harmon
glances one final time over his left shoul
der at the posts and then back at his tee.
The snap is perfect, the hold is perfect and
so is the kick.
Bedlam.
Harmon now kicks off from his own 25-
vard line because Stanford was penalized
for having players on the field celebrating.
He does what he has been told and boots a
low, chopping squib kick that is going to
be hard to handle.
Moen picks it up with orders not to go
down with the football. As he is about to
be tackled he laterals to Richard Rodgers.
Rodgers gets nowhere and laterals back to
freshman Dwight Garner. Time is now
elapsed.
Garner is swarmed on near midfield and
begins to fall backwards.
The Stanford band roars onto the field
and so do two players from the Cardinal

bench. Stanford defenders said they saw
an official call Garner down and they relax
their pursuit. Penalty flags fly everywhere,
hut Garner flips the ball out to Rodgers,
who heads upfield directly into the chaotic
mass of the Stanford band. Rodgers
crosses midfield and, at the 46-vard line,
loops the ball back to Mariet Ford before
being tackled. Ford races to the 20 where
he blindly flips the ball backwards over his
head. Moen catches the ball and crashes
the final 25 yards through the LSJUMB
and into the end zone, capping his jaunt by
trampling Stanford trombone plaverGary
Tvrell. An official signals touchdown.
Bedlam.
Cal fans pour onto the field and Stan
ford fans will not leave. Cardinal players
stare aghast at the Cal celebration.
Freeze the moment. Stanford' coach
Paul Wiggin storms through the tunnel to
the outside walkway where he is pushing
himself through the dazed, euphoric
crowd. Wiggin and some of his assistant
coaches charge into a television trailer to
see the replay.
Defensive back coach Chuck Detwiler
responds first, slamming his fists into a
table.
"He's down! Down! Bastards!"
The coaches trample out of the trailer
and back through the Berkeley crowd.
Wiggin weaves back through the tunnel to
the field picking his way over some of his
players who are sitting in the pitch black
tunnel, head in hands, crying.
Thev were emotionally empty.
Cal players had left the field and re
turned with The Axe.
"We got The Axe! We got the Axe!"
Something was wrong in the Cal locker
room. Players celebrated like they are sup
posed to, said things they are supposed to,
but not what they felt.
They were emotionally empty.
"All I heard from the referee was that as

soon as Kevin (Moen) touched a band
member it was a touchdown," said tight
end David Lewis.
Then, thanks to the band, an idiot asked
him.
"No, thanks to our team for not giving
up."
The sound was not mixing with the vis
ual.
Joe Kapp was talking like a coach. One
of the most flambovant plavers in history
was now a coach and he was talking like
one. His lips were moving, but he wasn't
saying anything. He had witnessed the
most incredible Big Game ever, and he
was talking like it was routine.
"It's just a great moment for these
men," Kapp said. "Our goal all season
was to play 60 minutes of football. It's a
tribute to the effort all season long and we
earned everv single thing."
But Joe, is that it? Wasn't that the
greatest game vou've ever seen, the idiot
asked.
"I didn't say that," Kapp said and re
moved his press face and walked back to
his players who were uneasily celebrating.
Freeze the moment.
Kapp hugs Rodgers and says in his ear,
"Why can't vou guvs do it in 60 minutes?"
After 30 minutes, someone remembers
to roll out the champagne. Moen stops in
mid-sentence as he remembers to pull out
a victory cigar from his locker.
Kapp steps out onto the balcony and
looks down at the thousands of fans as
they stream home. They look at him like
he is bigger than life.
You can almost hear them think, "Tell
us it's real, Joe."
Kapp starts to lead a cheer and it makes
them happv because now they know it's
real. It can't be taken back.
Thev weren't sure before.
Berkeley, Calif. — That anything can
and will happen in a Big Game was proven
again the other day at Memorial Stadium
when Stanford's players and band failed
to win the game and celebrate in the nor
mal chronological order.
Cal won the 85th Big Game classic
25-20 on a five-pitch, controversial and
bizarre kickoff return with time elapsed.
