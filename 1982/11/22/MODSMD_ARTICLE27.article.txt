### STEPHEN STRENG 
The nationally No. 3 ranked
Stanford women's volleyball
team eame within one game of
tying for the Western Collegiate
Athletic Association cham
pionship, but faltered, losing
their last conference game to No.
6 Southern California Friday
night in Los Angeles.
The Cardinal and USC are
now tied for second place with
identical 11-3 conference records
behind league champion, No. 2
San Diego State who finished at
12-2. Stanford is now 2H-9 over
all.
The Cardinal unsuccesfully
played catch-up in the fourth
game as the Trojans avenged an
earlier loss to Stanford, winning
the match-deciding game 15-12.
The Trojans jumped all over
the shocked Cardinal in the first

game taking it easily 15-5. USC
was paced by last weeks WCAA
athlete of the week, freshman
outside hitter Tracv Clark, who
leads the league in hitting per
centage with .411.
Stanford regrouped in the sec
ond game and defeated USC
15-7, and appeared to be in con
trol of the match. But, in the
crucial third game, the Cardinal
took a 12-10 lead only to lose it
when their serving fell apart. The
Trojans took advantage of the
Stanford lapse and went on to
win the game 15-12.
On Thursday night at Long
Beach the Cardinal defeated
league cellar dweller Long Beach
State, who hasn't won a con
ference game all season, 15-6,
15-10, and 15-11,
"It was their night," said assis

tant coach Don Shaw. "It just
wasn't ours. We made a lot of
mistakes. We couldn't pass the
ball. We didn't block very well. It
was a gift"
The Cardinal will meet No. I
ranked University of Hawaii in
Hawaii on 28th and 29th â€”
the same time that the NCAA
playoff selections will be an
nounced.
Kven with Friday's loss to the

Trojans, Stanford is still in the
running for a first round bve, one
of which has already been given
to SDSU. If the Cardinal does
not receive one, it will have to
play a first round match, proba
bly at Maples Pavilion.
If Stanford does receive a bve.
they will automatically move to
one of the four Regional Tour
naments, cither at Purdue or the
University of Houston.
