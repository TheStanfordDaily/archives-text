# Poloists whip Cat in Big Splash to close regular season
## 
### CHRIS ADDINGTON 
"Saturday was a great morning
for water polo. The air was crisp,
clean and filled with a nippv No
vember breeze. It was an even
greater morning for Stanford wa
ter polo as the Cardinal soundly
defeated the University of Cali
fornia at Berkeley by a score of
11-7 before a "hanging from the
rafters" crowd at Cal's new
Spiker Aquatics Complex.
"I'm reallv happy right now,"
commented Stanford's high
scorer Cireg Lambert. "We really
settled down and didn't let the
crowd influence our play.
Settling down was a mild way
to put it for Stanford started out
almost too slow to come back.
Cal ran up the early score to
3-0 on goals bv John Clifford and
Alan (iresham and by Brian
But/alaki on a two-man advan
tage situation.
Then Stanford started "settl
ing down." Lambert scored the
first of his three goals on a Cal
ejection. Two more by Lambert
on the Cardinal fast break added
to one bv senior James Bergeson
and Stanford was in,the driver's
seat 4-3.
That still wasn't good enough
for the Stanford squad which
sports a 26-4 overall record and is

heading for a No. 2 seed in the
NCAA national tournament.
Cardinal Jeff Stiling found the
ihe net on two more man-advan
tage situatfons and at the half
Stanford led bv a score of 6-3.
Another goal bv Bergeson
seemed to put Stanford out of
reach, but this California team
refused to roll over in its home
pool.
Cal's (iresham connected once
and then on two 4-meter penalty
shots, one of them charged to
Stanford's Stiling for brutality,
and Berkeley was right back in
the contest trailing bv one.
Stanford counterattacked and
put the game out of reach.
"Our counter reallv won the
game." said Stanford coach
Dante Dettamanti. "Cal was ex
hausted and too tired to run an
offense."
The counter was good for two
more quick goals coming off
shots bv seniors Kirk Jensen and
John Tanner. Tanner scored
once again on a man-advantage,
and coupled with a Cal score bv
Peter Cutino and a 20-meter skip
shot at the buzzer bv Stanford's
Tom Lampert, concluded the
scoring.

"We were reallv readv to
play," said Dettamanti. "I cer
tainly felt relived when 1 saw the
new pool," he added in reference
to the old Harmon Pool and its
poor design for the sport of water
polo.
With this victory Stanford fin
ishes regular season and Pac-10
conference plav. The Cardinal is
the outright Pac-10 winner with a
6-0 record. Berkeley finished in a
tie for second with UCLA at 3-3
and IJSC rounds out the division
at 0-6.
Stanford travels to Long
Beach this weekend for the
NCAA nationals. Final invita
tions to the tournev are sent out
today but the Held will probably
be seeded with UC-lrvine No. I,
Stanford No. 2, UCLA No. 3,
and Cal No. 4. The last four slots
will be up for grabs among such
teams as USC, UC-Santa
Barbara, University of the Pacif
ic, Long Beach State, Loyola of
Chicago, Brown, University of
Kentucky, Navy and Bucknell.
Quarter and semi-final games
will be held this Saturday in the
indoor pool at the Belmont Plaza
Natatorium in Long Beach with
the finals on Sunday night.

DROWNING CAL: Tom Lampert swims up the pool in Satur

"Saturday was a great morning
for water polo. The air was crisp,
clean and filled with a nippv No
vember breeze. It was an even
greater morning for Stanford wa
ter polo as the Cardinal soundly
defeated the University of Cali
fornia at Berkeley by a score of
11-7 before a "hanging from the
rafters" crowd at Cal's new
Spiker Aquatics Complex.
"I'm reallv happy right now,"
commented Stanford's high
scorer Cireg Lambert. "We really
settled down and didn't let the
crowd influence our play.
Settling down was a mild way
to put it for Stanford started out
almost too slow to come back.
Cal ran up the early score to
3-0 on goals bv John Clifford and
Alan (iresham and by Brian
But/alaki on a two-man advan
tage situation.
Then Stanford started "settl
ing down." Lambert scored the
first of his three goals on a Cal
ejection. Two more by Lambert
on the Cardinal fast break added
to one bv senior James Bergeson
and Stanford was in,the driver's
seat 4-3.
That still wasn't good enough
for the Stanford squad which
sports a 26-4 overall record and is

heading for a No. 2 seed in the
NCAA national tournament.
Cardinal Jeff Stiling found the
ihe net on two more man-advan
tage situatfons and at the half
Stanford led bv a score of 6-3.
Another goal bv Bergeson
seemed to put Stanford out of
reach, but this California team
refused to roll over in its home
pool.
Cal's (iresham connected once
and then on two 4-meter penalty
shots, one of them charged to
Stanford's Stiling for brutality,
and Berkeley was right back in
the contest trailing bv one.
Stanford counterattacked and
put the game out of reach.
"Our counter reallv won the
game." said Stanford coach
Dante Dettamanti. "Cal was ex
hausted and too tired to run an
offense."
The counter was good for two
more quick goals coming off
shots bv seniors Kirk Jensen and
John Tanner. Tanner scored
once again on a man-advantage,
and coupled with a Cal score bv
Peter Cutino and a 20-meter skip
shot at the buzzer bv Stanford's
Tom Lampert, concluded the
scoring.

"We were reallv readv to
play," said Dettamanti. "I cer
tainly felt relived when 1 saw the
new pool," he added in reference
to the old Harmon Pool and its
poor design for the sport of water
polo.
With this victory Stanford fin
ishes regular season and Pac-10
conference plav. The Cardinal is
the outright Pac-10 winner with a
6-0 record. Berkeley finished in a
tie for second with UCLA at 3-3
and IJSC rounds out the division
at 0-6.
Stanford travels to Long
Beach this weekend for the
NCAA nationals. Final invita
tions to the tournev are sent out
today but the Held will probably
be seeded with UC-lrvine No. I,
Stanford No. 2, UCLA No. 3,
and Cal No. 4. The last four slots
will be up for grabs among such
teams as USC, UC-Santa
Barbara, University of the Pacif
ic, Long Beach State, Loyola of
Chicago, Brown, University of
Kentucky, Navy and Bucknell.
Quarter and semi-final games
will be held this Saturday in the
