# Cardinal demolishes Alberta in Davis debut at Maples
## 
### STEVE ODELL 
The Stanford basketball team
pummeled the University of Ed
monton-Alberta 107-53 last
night, initiating both the 1982-83
season and the Tom Davis era in
an exhibition game at Maples Pa
vilion.
The home opener brought out
more than 4500 fans who were
anxious to see what changes
Davis had instituted.
What they saw was an ag
gressive full-court zone trapping
defense, two unheard-of

freshmen and one walk-on in the
starting line-up, and the most
points scored in Maples since a
108-98 win over Alaska in
1977-78.
Center John Revelli picked up
where he left off last season, scor
ing easily inside, leading the
Cardinal with 20 points and 10
rebounds in just 19 minutes of
work.
In the backcourt, Steve Brown
played hounding defense and
contributed 18 points, and Keith
Jones, back from a one-year aca

demic probation, came off the
bench to score 19 points on pene
trating moves to the basket.
Davis acknowledged the game
for what it was — a blow-out
over a undermanned and in
timid;-»ed Alberta team of low
caliber. "This was purely a dress
rehearsal," the new Cardinal
coach said. "It was good to get
the kinks out.
"Our defense was decent. The
opponent was not as strong as we
had hoped. We obviously still

have a lot of work to do. We can't
put too much stock in the game
tonight."
Stanford had things wrapped
up by halftime, leading 51-26 due
to 60 percent shooting from the
floor, mostlv lav-ups. Alberta
meanwhile was connecting on
just 20 percent of its field goal at
tempts, mostly from long range.
The Card did not give up a sin
gle point for a span of nearly six
minutes, shutting out Alberta for
the last 1:53 of the first half and
the opening 3:56 of the second.
When Mike Kornak hit his
second free throw attempt with
16:04 remaining, Stanford had
rattled off 20 straight points and
led 65-26.
The Cardinal beat the lazv Al
berta zone defense with crisp
passing, compiling 17 assists.
Stanford outrebounded the
Golden Bears 48-35. "I was very
pleased with the rebounding,"
said Davis. "We haven't been re
bounding well in practice, so it
was good to see that. We still
need to rebound better from the
guard position, however."
The starting line-up included
Andv Fisher, a walk-on who did
not even make the game pro
gram. Fisher nailed seven-of
nine field goal attempts and fin
ished with 15 points.

"We saw him in pre-season
and asked him to plav with us,"
Davis said of Fisher in a relaxed
locker room. "Me started out on
the grev team, moved up to the
red team, and b\ the end of this
week, he had worked his wav up
to the starting five."
The other two unfamiliar
names in the starting five were
freshmen Earl Koberlein and
Keith Ramee. Koberlein played
strong underneath and pulled
down eight rebounds, five of
them offensive, while Ramee
dished out eight assists.
"That's just how it evolved,"
Davis said in regard to the no
name starters. "The starting line
up has changed all pre-season.
These five guvs were onlv in it as
of this week. We feel that they
work together well. Our defense
was pretty good, thev rebounded
and handled the ball, too. They
might not be our five strongest
players, but thev have what we
were looking for."
Stanford got all the warm-up
they needed in pre-game, break
ing an S-S tie with nine straight
points to lead 17-9. Another
eight-point burst later on gave
Stanford a 45-25 advantage, and
the Cardinal left the floor at half
time with insurmountable 25-
point lead.
Stanford plays UC-Riverside
in its first regular season contest
Saturday at 3 p.m. "They're a
very nice ball club," Davis said.
