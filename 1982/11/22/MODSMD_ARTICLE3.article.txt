# Big Game 1982: a disastrous weekend

More than six students were injured
during the annual Big Game rally in
San Krancisco Friday night, including
at least five who were hit bv a sports car
which plowed through the crowd near
the end of the march,
The driver of a small green Fiat ac
celerated through part of the 5000-per
son crowd on Larkin St. near Aquatic
Park and injured junior Jill Scoby,
sophomore Craig Miott, exchange stu
dent Cheryl Anderson, freshman Patri
cia Lambie and junior Thomas "Blair"
Matheson.
The latter four students, and
sophomore Margot Wright, who was
knocked over by an individual in a sep

treated and released at Mitmion Emer

tal Friday night, according to Dean of
Student Affairs Jim Lyons. Scoby did
not register at the hospital but went to
Cowell for treatment late Friday night.
Other students are believed to have
suffered minor injuries in the incident
but did not report to the hospital in San
Francisco.
The driver of the sports car was at
tempting to leave a Larkin St. garage
and apparently panicked after entering
the crowd-filled street. Police arrested
the driver, Farshad Shawhla, 21, at his
San Francisco home six blocks from the
incident and charged him with felony
hit-and-run, driving without a license
and possessing an open container of al
coholic beverages, according to Inspec
tor Henry Hunter of San Francisco Po
lice.
Shawla reportedlv told police that he
accelerated only after students taunted
him, reached into his car to pull his hair

and pounded on his car. However, sev
eral witnesses said that crowd members
struck the car only after it had already
begun to plow through the rally.
Mission Emergency treated the vic
tims, brought by ambulances and squad
cars from North Point, Larkin and
Aquatic Park, at about 11:30 p.m. I ri
dav. Lambie, the most seriously in
jured, was released at 4 a.m. Saturday.
Senior Yolanda Townsend, a resi
dent assistant at Mirlo who accom
panied Lambie and Matheson said,
"She (Lambie) is going to be fine."
According to witnesses, Lambie fell
in front of the car and it ran over her
Matheson, who already had a cast
on, will have to wear the cast longer as a
result of the accident, Townsend said.

Simeral was only bruised. "They're

"You get that many people together,
it's hard to keep control. There's a lot of
enthusiasm," Robinson said.
"If there needs to be more security, it
should be done through student or
ganizations. . .The responsibility
shouldn't all be on the band.
The person instead of stopping was
driving through. . I can't say that this
person was totally at fault. Our students
were being obnoxious," Robinson said.
"They started kicking his car. I guess he
just panicked."
University President Donald Ken

was negligent about that except the


ACCIDENT SCENE: A frenzied driver hit at least five
students Friday night at the Big Game rally. Stanford
freshman Patricia Lambie, above, was taken to Mission

Emergency for first-aid and was later released. The spir
it of the rally was dampened, but the band continued on
to Aquatic Park to finish the evening on a lively note.

driver."
San Francisco Police Sergeant Den
nis Schardt said, "You call it a rally —
we call it total chaos. . .The overall dis
ruption to the city is quite significant."
"Why do they come to San Francisco
to celebrate the Big Game?" Schardt
asked. "Why do they need to come to
San Francisco and just basically go
crazy?"
He said he thought the rally should
be held in Palo Alto or Berkeley instead
of San Francisco.
Schardt said funding for the police
used to monitor the crowds "comes
right out of the regular police budget,
the taxpayers of San Francisco."
For the past two years, according to
former Band Manager John Howard,
the band has been required to post a
$2500 bond to cover any damages done
to the Aquatic Park. However, the
bond does not cover damages incurred
outside the park.
Howard said the band had never had
any money assessed against it until last
year. "There was usually no dam
age. . .(and) none of the damage was
caused by the Stanford Band," Howard
said.
According to Robert Beth, director
of risk management here, "It's not been
paid for by the University in the past.
They (the band) have to post a bond for

the permit to hold the parade. . .The
University really doesn't sponsor the :
parade." ;
In 1978 students damaged the park
extensively but the band never received
a bill, Howard said. He was not sure '•
who picked up the tab.
"There have been incidents in the :
past and bills have been forwarded to *
the band," Lyons said. "Often they're ;
just clean-up charges."
The Office of Student Affairs will •
hold an informational meeting tomor- J
row for all injured students, Lyons said.
The meeting, which will probably in
clude a University counsel, should
educate students on how to recover
costs from, for example, broken instru
ments and eyeglasses, Lyons said. "Pre
sumably they'll try to get the insurance
company of the driver of the car (to
pay)," Lyons said. Those students wish
ing to participate should call his office.
In a less serious accident involving
the band Saturday, saxophonist Scott
Debarger and trombonist Gary Tyrrell
were knocked down on the field in the
final plav of the Big Game by UC-
Berkeley football player Kevin Moen.
But Band Manager Gary Robinson
said neither band member was injured.
Debarger said, "The guy who scored
the winning touchdown hit both of us.
About all that happened was that we
were surprised but other than that we
were all fine," he said.
Tyrrell was in the end zone. "He just
got trashed," Robinson said.
