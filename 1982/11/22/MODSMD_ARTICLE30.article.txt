jumped the curb and plowed into the
corner of Frailer 37W in Manzanita
Park about 2:1 5 a.in. Friday morning.
Junior Larrv Wilken was arrested for
driving under the influence of alcohol.
Wilken was taken to the hospital for mi
nor abrasions, but neither Wilken'stwo
passengers nor the residents of the
trailer were injured, according to trailer
occupant Jeff McNallv.
The car damaged the pvlons which
support the trailer causing the structure
to sink about two feet over the course of
the night, McNallv said. The accident
caused $6000 worth of damage and re
pairs of the structure supports, plumb
ing and electrical lines will probably not
be completed for 10 days, according to
the contractor repairing the damage,
Dwayne Titus.
McNallv said he had just come home

Friday morning when he heard a
screech coming from the Branner park
ing lot, located behind the trailer park.
When the car hit the building, McNally
said, dishes and glasses "came flying
out of the cupboards" in the kitchen
and the television and lamps in the liv
ing room were knocked over.
All four trailer residents were evac
uated that night. Originally they were
told that they could not return to the
trailer for 10 davs, McNally said, but
they were recently notified that they can
move back in tomorrow.
The trailer residents have been incon
venienced bv the incident, McNally
said.
"It's kind of a hassle right now," he
added.
The residents did not know Wilken
well or know the reason for his sudden
departure from the Branner parking
lot, McNallv said.
