# Amos arraignment postponed
## 
### 
Donald Amos, charged with murder
ing Stanford student Angela Arvidson
last month, appeared in Santa Clara
County Municipal Court Friday only
to have his arraignment postponed to
Friday, Dec. 17.
Judge Edward Scoyen granted the
postponement, which the Public De
fender's Office had requested in order
to allow it more time to prepare Amos'
defense.
The 29-year-old San Jose de
liveryman is accused of stabbing
Arvidson to death Oct. 22 at the cam
pus Frenchman's Hill home of
Laurence Kedes, associate professor at
the Stanford Medical Center. Arvidson
was a part-time house cleaner at the
home.

Following the murder, police found
that Amos, his wife and their three chil- :
dren had left their home. Officials' :
three-week search ended Nov. 14 when *
Amos turned himself in at a San Jose •
jail.
While Amos was missing, police ;
searched his home and found a bloody •
pair of Levi jeans there.
Last week Deputy District Attorney
George Kennedy, said that the blood :
found on the jeans matched Arvidson's :
blood type.
Amos was first arraigned Nov. 15,
when he asked for court-appointed le
gal counsel.
The Dec. 17 hearing is set for 1:30
p.m. in San Jose.
