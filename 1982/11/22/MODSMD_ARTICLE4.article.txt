# Hospital modernization plan
## Health-care legislation may cause delays 
### 
Editor's note In the midst of attempts to
modernize and solve conflicts with com
munity physicians, the Stanford Univer
sity Hospital is faced with new legislation
concerning Medi-Cal and the functioning
of private insurance companies. This is
the first in a three-part series that will
discuss the potential problems the hospi
tal laces in obtaining its goals. Today's
installment deals with the Hospital Mod
ernization Project.

It seems incongruous that the only
hospital where heart-lung transplants
have been successfully performed needs
to modernize its facilities to comply
with state and federal safety codes. But
the current Stanford University Hospi

tal was built more than 20 years ago —
without intensive care units or sophisti
cated operating rooms — so mod
ernization is a necessity.
"Our physical plan is really well be
hind the times," said Lawrence
Crowley, University vice-president for
medical affairs. He compared a hospital
to a steel plant: "It has to keep mod
ernizing its facilities or else you're going
to find yourself out of business."
The hospital was cited for code vio
lations several times bv state ac
creditors who inspected the facilities
and then required that the hospital sub
mit a plan to correct the problems, ac
cording to Crowley.
The plan, called the "Hospital Mod
ernization Project," was approved by

the hoard of trustees in June, with the
added requirement that less costly alter
natives he developed to address any
problems which mav arise in financing
the current $123.5 million plan.
The project, presently divided into
three phases, will add 585,(MX) square
feet to the complex through construc
tion. Some remodeling of existing
buildings is also included in the present
project.
112 inancing for the entire project will
come from a tax-exempt bond, hospital
reserves and a fund-raising drive, ac
cording to (rowlev.
The violations the hospital has been
cited lor concern things such as the si/e
of operating rooms, the effectiveness of
monitoring equipment and the amount

of space provided for each patient, ac
cording to ( rowlev. "They're basically
prettv sound safetv-tvpe codes, they're
not just bizarre things, thev're real
things, thev're things we'd correct any
how," he said.
Another set of codes — this one re
garding earthquake safety — prevents
the hospital from simply updating the
existing facilities. "The way this partic
ular building was constructed, it's im
possible to renovate them because von
can't tamper with any of these sheer
weight bearing walls," Crowley said.
"So we have tried to make do, we
have verv carefullv developed some in
tensive care units, which get by, but
they're not code-compliant and they're
very inefficient," he said.
The plan for modernization is cur
rently being reviewed and revised, ac
cording to Elvia Garwood, the Hospital
Modernization Project director. A
modified version will probably be
adopted, she said, "primarily because
of the uncertainty of the funding."
However, Garwood added that the
overall cost will probably remain un
changed, but modernization will be car
ried out during a longer time period.
"Basically the funding difficulties are
coming from a reduction in Medi-Cal
resources and also an anticipated re
duction in Medicare," said Crowley.
Legislation, signed by Gov. Brown in
June and effective Jan. 1, mandates hos
pitals to contract with Medi-Cal if they
want to accept Medi-Cal patients in
non-emergency situations. A team of
negotiators from Stanford has been in
volved in discussions with Medi-Cal of
ficials. Last week the negotiators sub

mitted a contract bid to the state.
The hospital is submitting a bid, ac
cording to Crowlev, "to continue to
take care of Medi-Cal patients at a com
pensation level that will be reasonable
for Stanford Hospital."
However, obtaining a satisfactory
contract may not be easy, due to a new
approach taken by Medi-Cal officials
and new laws concerning private insur
ance companies.
Currently, the hospital cost-sub
sidizes Medi-Cal patients by charging
other patients higher prices. After Jan.
I, however, insurance companies will
be able to apply with hospitals for "pre
ferred provider status," allowing them
to negotiate yearly rates for patient
care. This system will give insurance
companies a more active role in de
termining rates, which are presently set
bv the hospitals.
The hospital, according to Crowley,
will look into obtaining preferred pro
vider status from the companies that
approach them. The hospital's ability
to function under the new system will
depend on whether the insurance com
pany decides to have one rate encom

passing all patients or different rates for
different procedures, he said.
In a policy change, "Medi-Cal wants
to do it one rate for everything,"
Crowley said, "and we think that's kind
of unfair because it's very hard to be
absolutely sure what the mix of patients
is."
If the hospital is forced to stop in
creasing rates to patients covered by
private insurance companies, as it ap
pears it will be, "that would mean then
we'd have to either lower quality of ser
vice or go into debt," Crowley said. "So
we're trying to negotiate with Medi-Cal
for a realistic price."
Summing up the financing changes,
he said, "I think what we're moving
towards is more prospective rate set
tings." Many people are worried about
this change, but Crowley said he is "not
quite as worried about it because it's
been present in .. . seven or eight states
already with a fair amount of ex
perience and some very good hospitals
have managed to develop a sound rate
and have done pretty well with it."
Although financial difficulties may

become more severe after Jan. | when
the new laws become effective, the hos
pital has already had to shutdown one
unit and is considering closing another,
according to Sheldon King, executive
director of the hospital.
Unit N2A — a 663-bed sports medi
cine unit located at Hoover Pavilion —
was closed because of a decline in pa
tient census. King said that recent dif
ficulties in admitting and keeping pa
tients have resulted from a change in at
titudes toward health care, generated
bv the recession and the anticipated de
cline in Medicare and Medi-Cal funds.
Many people who have lost their jobs
have also lost their health care benefits
and people who are still employed are
tending to go to the hospital only in
emergency situations, according to
King.
He said he is concerned about the
consequences of people continuing "to
postpone care until it becomes an emer
gency" because hospitals will then have
more patients admitted for critical care.
Tomorrow: The access issue.

depend on whether the insurance com
pany decides to have one rate encom

passing all patients or different rates for
different procedures, he said.
In a policy change, "Medi-Cal wants
to do it one rate for everything,"
Crowley said, "and we think that's kind
of unfair because it's very hard to be
absolutely sure what the mix of patients
is."
If the hospital is forced to stop in
creasing rates to patients covered by
private insurance companies, as it ap
pears it will be, "that would mean then
we'd have to either lower quality of ser
vice or go into debt," Crowley said. "So
we're trying to negotiate with Medi-Cal
for a realistic price."
Summing up the financing changes,
he said, "I think what we're moving
towards is more prospective rate set
tings." Many people are worried about
this change, but Crowley said he is "not
quite as worried about it because it's
been present in .. . seven or eight states
already with a fair amount of ex
perience and some very good hospitals
have managed to develop a sound rate
and have done pretty well with it."
Although financial difficulties may

become more severe after Jan. | when
the new laws become effective, the hos
pital has already had to shutdown one
unit and is considering closing another,
according to Sheldon King, executive
director of the hospital.
Unit N2A — a 663-bed sports medi
cine unit located at Hoover Pavilion —
was closed because of a decline in pa
tient census. King said that recent dif
ficulties in admitting and keeping pa
tients have resulted from a change in at
titudes toward health care, generated
bv the recession and the anticipated de
cline in Medicare and Medi-Cal funds.
Many people who have lost their jobs
have also lost their health care benefits
and people who are still employed are
tending to go to the hospital only in
emergency situations, according to
King.
He said he is concerned about the
consequences of people continuing "to
postpone care until it becomes an emer
gency" because hospitals will then have
more patients admitted for critical care.

Editor's note In the midst of attempts to
modernize and solve conflicts with com

concerning Medi-Cal and the functioning
of private insurance companies. This is

discuss the potential problems the hospi

installment deals with the Hospital Mod

By KRISTF.N CHRISTOPHER

It seems incongruous that the only
hospital where heart-lung transplants
have been successfully performed needs
to modernize its facilities to comply
with state and federal safety codes. But
the current Stanford University Hospi

tal was built more than 20 years ago —
without intensive care units or sophisti
cated operating rooms — so mod
ernization is a necessity.
"Our physical plan is really well be
hind the times," said Lawrence
Crowley, University vice-president for
medical affairs. He compared a hospital
to a steel plant: "It has to keep mod
ernizing its facilities or else you're going
to find yourself out of business."
The hospital was cited for code vio
lations several times bv state ac
creditors who inspected the facilities
and then required that the hospital sub
mit a plan to correct the problems, ac
cording to Crowley.
The plan, called the "Hospital Mod
ernization Project," was approved by

the hoard of trustees in June, with the
added requirement that less costly alter
natives he developed to address any
problems which mav arise in financing
the current $123.5 million plan.
The project, presently divided into
three phases, will add 585,(MX) square
feet to the complex through construc
tion. Some remodeling of existing
buildings is also included in the present
project.
112 inancing for the entire project will
come from a tax-exempt bond, hospital
reserves and a fund-raising drive, ac
cording to (rowlev.
The violations the hospital has been
cited lor concern things such as the si/e
of operating rooms, the effectiveness of
monitoring equipment and the amount

of space provided for each patient, ac
cording to ( rowlev. "They're basically
prettv sound safetv-tvpe codes, they're
not just bizarre things, thev're real
things, thev're things we'd correct any
how," he said.
Another set of codes — this one re
garding earthquake safety — prevents
the hospital from simply updating the
existing facilities. "The way this partic
ular building was constructed, it's im
possible to renovate them because von
can't tamper with any of these sheer
weight bearing walls," Crowley said.
"So we have tried to make do, we
have verv carefullv developed some in
tensive care units, which get by, but
they're not code-compliant and they're
very inefficient," he said.
The plan for modernization is cur
rently being reviewed and revised, ac
cording to Elvia Garwood, the Hospital
Modernization Project director. A
modified version will probably be
adopted, she said, "primarily because
of the uncertainty of the funding."
However, Garwood added that the
overall cost will probably remain un
changed, but modernization will be car
ried out during a longer time period.
"Basically the funding difficulties are
coming from a reduction in Medi-Cal
resources and also an anticipated re
duction in Medicare," said Crowley.
Legislation, signed by Gov. Brown in
June and effective Jan. 1, mandates hos
pitals to contract with Medi-Cal if they
want to accept Medi-Cal patients in
non-emergency situations. A team of
negotiators from Stanford has been in
volved in discussions with Medi-Cal of
ficials. Last week the negotiators sub

mitted a contract bid to the state.
The hospital is submitting a bid, ac
cording to Crowlev, "to continue to
take care of Medi-Cal patients at a com
pensation level that will be reasonable
for Stanford Hospital."
However, obtaining a satisfactory
contract may not be easy, due to a new
approach taken by Medi-Cal officials
and new laws concerning private insur
ance companies.
Currently, the hospital cost-sub
sidizes Medi-Cal patients by charging
other patients higher prices. After Jan.
I, however, insurance companies will
be able to apply with hospitals for "pre
ferred provider status," allowing them
to negotiate yearly rates for patient
care. This system will give insurance
companies a more active role in de
termining rates, which are presently set
bv the hospitals.
The hospital, according to Crowley,
will look into obtaining preferred pro
vider status from the companies that
approach them. The hospital's ability
to function under the new system will
depend on whether the insurance com
pany decides to have one rate encom

passing all patients or different rates for
