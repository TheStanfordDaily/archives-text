# Hospital modernization plan
## Health-care legislation may cause delays 
### 
Editor's note In the midst of attempts to
modernize and solve conflicts with com
munity physicians, the Stanford Univer
sity Hospital is faced with new legislation
concerning Medi-Cal and the functioning
of private insurance companies. This is
the first in a three-part series that will
discuss the potential problems the hospi
tal laces in obtaining its goals. Today's
installment deals with the Hospital Mod
ernization Project.

It seems incongruous that the only
hospital where heart-lung transplants
have been successfully performed needs
to modernize its facilities to comply
with state and federal safety codes. But
the current Stanford University Hospi

tal was built more than 20 years ago —
without intensive care units or sophisti
cated operating rooms — so mod
ernization is a necessity.
"Our physical plan is really well be
hind the times," said Lawrence
Crowley, University vice-president for
medical affairs. He compared a hospital
to a steel plant: "It has to keep mod
ernizing its facilities or else you're going
to find yourself out of business."
The hospital was cited for code vio
lations several times bv state ac
creditors who inspected the facilities
and then required that the hospital sub
mit a plan to correct the problems, ac
cording to Crowley.
The plan, called the "Hospital Mod
ernization Project," was approved by

the hoard of trustees in June, with the
added requirement that less costly alter
natives he developed to address any
problems which mav arise in financing
the current $123.5 million plan.
The project, presently divided into
three phases, will add 585,(MX) square
feet to the complex through construc
tion. Some remodeling of existing
buildings is also included in the present
project.
112 inancing for the entire project will
come from a tax-exempt bond, hospital
reserves and a fund-raising drive, ac
cording to (rowlev.
The violations the hospital has been
cited lor concern things such as the si/e
of operating rooms, the effectiveness of
monitoring equipment and the amount

of space provided for each patient, ac
cording to ( rowlev. "They're basically
prettv sound safetv-tvpe codes, they're
not just bizarre things, thev're real
things, thev're things we'd correct any
how," he said.
Another set of codes — this one re
garding earthquake safety — prevents
the hospital from simply updating the
existing facilities. "The way this partic
ular building was constructed, it's im
possible to renovate them because von
can't tamper with any of these sheer
weight bearing walls," Crowley said.
"So we have tried to make do, we
have verv carefullv developed some in
tensive care units, which get by, but
they're not code-compliant and they're
