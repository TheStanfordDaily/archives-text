Tax cut prospects dim
Washington — Robert Dole. (R-Kan.) Senate finance committee chair
man and Martin Feldstein, the president's chief economic adviser, said yes
terday that any attempt to accelerate the 1983 income tax cut to stimulate the
economy would not address the economy's real problems and would proba
bly be rejected by Congress.
President Reagan is considering asking Congress to advance the effective
date of the tax reduction from July 1 to Jan. I in an effort to put more cash
into consumers' hands.
But Dole, echoing doubts expressed earlier by other key congressional Re
publicans. said he could not detect "any enthusiasm" for the idea, which he
said would only increase the federal budget deficit.
Despite the lack of enthusiasm that has greeted the accelerated tax cut pro
posal since it was floated by the White House, Reagan reportedly has not
civen un on the idea
He is said to be considering a plan in which the
tax-cut acceleration would be coupled with a gaso
line tax increase to fund a highway-repair program
that would create jobs.
Feldstein, chairman of the president's Council
of Economic Advisers, said that the economy is at
the brink of a "moderate recovery" and that the
important task facing Congress and the adminis
tration is not further tinkering with tax laws but ac
tion to reduce domestic spending and cut budget
deficits.
The deficit for the 1984 fiscal year is likely be
$ 150 billion to $200 billion without "significant ac
tions" to reduce federal spending, Feldstein said.
The latter figure is $15 billion higher than that
projected last week at a Cabinet meeting by David
Stockman, Office of Management and Budget di
rector.
Moslems protest Gemayal gov't
Beirut — Hundreds of armed Moslem Shiite
demonstrators stormed the city hall of Baalbek in
Lebanon's eastern Bekaa valley yesterday and vir
tually took over the entire town for the day.
Radio reports and eyewitness accounts said 500
members of the Lebanese Shiite organization
known as Amal occupied the municipality building
at 6:30 a.m. and proceeded to take down Lebanese
flags and other bunting put up for today's celebra
tions marking the 39th anniversary of Lebanon's
independence from France.
The demonstrators armed with automatic rifles
and rocket-propelled grenade launchers painted
slogans denouncing Lebanese President Amin
Gemayel and Israel and hailing Iran's revolu
tionary leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the
reports said.
No injuries were reported in the takeover in
Baalbek, a city of about 25,000 people, mainly
Shiite Moslems. Also in the city is a contingent of
about 300 Revolutionary Guards from Iran's
Shiite-dominated government, who came this sum
mer to help the Palestinians fight the invading Is
raeli Army. There was no indication that the Iran
ians were involved in yesterday's seige.
However, the Shiites belonging to Amal in
Baalbek are staunch supporters of the Iranian rev
olution. Their leader is Hussein Mousavi, who
heads a breakaway faction of the national Amal
organization under Nabih Berri.
The .takeover on the eve of independence-day
celebrations appeared to be aimed at discrediting
Gemayel's government, which already is having se
rious difficulties containing the escalating sec
tarian strife between Moslem Druze and Chris
tians in the Chouf Mountains southeast of the cap
ital.
Massacre testimony continues
Jerusalem — Special U.S. envoy Morris Draper,
in unusually strong language, accused Israel of re
sponsibility for the "terrible" and "obscene"
massacres in two Palestinian refugee camps in
Beirut in September within minutes of learning of
the high death toll there, an Israeli official testified
here yesterday.
Bruce Kashdan, the Israeli Foreign Ministry's
representative in Beirut, said Draper telephoned
him the morning of Saturday, Sept. 18, to insist
that Israel "stop the massacres" by Lebanese
Christian forces. The night before, Kashdan said,
Draper had called to warn Israel against allowing
the Christian militia into the camps.
The Israeli board of inquiry that is investigating
the massacre of more than 300 Palestinians also
heard testimony yesterday by Prime Minister Men

achcm Begin's military aide, Lt. Col. Azriel Nevo,
denying that he received any reports regarding the
two refugee camps on Sept. 17, the second day of
the massacre. This contradicted testimony earlier
by an Israeli official who said he had relayed re
ports of "alleged irregularities" to Nevo that day.
Kashdan's testimony provided the first public
details of official U.S. reaction at the time of the
massacre and of American attempts to halt it. Lat
er that same day, President Reagan expressed his
"outrage and revulsion" and accused Israel of in
direct responsibility because of its actions in allow
ing the Phalangist militia into the virtually un
defended camps.
Kashdan said that between 7 o'clock and 8:30 on
the night of Friday, Sept. 17, Draper called him
with a report that unidentified soldiers had entered
Akka Hospital and that Phalangist militia units
were in Shatila refugee camp.
Kashdan also described Draper's reaction on
Saturday, Sept. 18, when the extent of the massacre
began to be known, saying the American diplomat
told him he had "a message for Mr. Sharon," a ref
erence to Defense Minister Ariel Sharon.
Israelis term blast an accident
Jersualem — Israeli investigators have formally
concluded that the explosion that destroyed an Is
raeli military headquarters in southern Lebanon
was an accident and not the result of hostile action,
the Cabinet was told yesterday.
"The commission did not encounter one fact
which could point to the explosion having been
caused by terrorist activity," the report of the panel
headed by reserve Maj. Gen. Meir Zorea said.
The Nov. 11 blast reduced to rubble the eight
story building in the port city of Tyre that housed
the Israeli military government. The explosion re
sulted in the death of 89 people, 75 Israeli soldiers
and security personnel and 14 Arabs who were
being held in the building for interrogation.
Original reports, which put the number of Arab
dead at 15, blamed the explosion on a car bomb,
raising the possibility that Israeli forces might re
taliate against Palestine Liberation Organization
positions in the Bekaa Valley or near the northern
port city of Tripoli.
But the commission concluded that the blast was
caused by leaking cooking gas. The report said the
building was improperly constructed and further
weakened by Israeli shelling early in the Lebanon
war. The building once housed a PLO office
The report recommended a new investigation to
determine who had stored gas canisters inside the
building in violation of safety regulations requiring
the containers to be kept in the open until they are
ready for use.
Soviets to name new president
Moscow — The new Soviet leadership, acting
swiftly after the death of Leonid Brezhnev, is ex
pected in the next few days to name a new presi
dent, fill vacancies in the ruling Communist Party
Politburo and set out the plan for next year's econ
omy.
Yuri Andropov, 68, already named to succeed
Brezhnev as the party's general secretary, is widely
believed poised to assume the largely ceremonial
presidency, consolidating his hold on power.
Other leading candidates for the job of head of
state are thought to be Soviet Foreign Minister An
drei Gromyko, 73, and Brezhnev protege Konstan
tin Chernenko, 71.
Brezhnev took control of the party immediately
after ousting Nikita Khrushchev in 1964, but he
did not become president until 1977 when he took
that job from Nikolai Podgomy.

Tomorrow, the party's Central Committee is ex
pected to hold its second meeting in 10 days to fill
up to three positions in the ruling Politburo, to sign
off on reports about last year's agricultural and ec
onomic output and to endorse the plans in those
sectors for next year.
Economic picture depressing
Washington — Under the gloomiest economic
conditions since the end of World War 11, cabinet
ministers from 88 nations will meet over
Thanksgiving weekend in Geneva, Switzerland to
confront a growing crisis in the world's trade sys
tem. The officials will find little to be thankful for.
A severe global recession has halted the steady
expansion of trade that has produced 25 years of
prosperity. Instead of fueling prosperity, recent de
velopments in world trade now threaten to destroy
it: Shrinking exports have helped to drive un
employment in the industrial countries to levels
unmatched since the Great Depression, feeding
sentiment for protectionist policies that could ac
celerate the downward spiral of trade and re
cession.
"The danger of a chain reaction of beggar-thy
neighbor policies with potentially disastrous con
sequences is now greater than at any time since the
Second World War," Emile van Lennep, secretary
general of the 24-nation Organization for Econom
ic Cooperation and Development, warned on the
eve of the Geneva session, which is the first high
level meeting called by the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade, known in economic circles as
GATT, since 1973.
And U.S. special trade representative William
Brock conceded last week that a "climate of
pessimism" would surround the meeting.
While hardly a household term, GATT has sym
bolized the slow and sometimes painful effort to
lower worldwide trade barriers, enlarge export
markets and prevent a repetition of the trade wars
that strangled world commerce in the 19305.
Social Security plan questioned
Washington — The rescue plan advanced by lib
eral Democrats on the Social Security reform panel
includes the notion that eventually benefits would
no longer be tax-free, the plan's architect says.
Robert Ball, a former commissioner of Social
Security, emphasized in an interview with The As
sociated Press on Friday that a tax on Social Secur
ity benefits would have to be phased in over several
decades and would not be levied on people now re
tired or about to retire.
But Ball said that if workers are allowed a new
income tax deduction or credit for the amount they
pay to Social Security, "the other side of that is
when you retire, for people who had that favorable
treatment, you would begin to tax the benefits."
Several groups have proposed in recent years
that retirees pay income tax on the half of their
benefits that stemmed from employers' payroll
taxes. Employers and employees each pay a tax of
6.7 percent.
Ball was a member of the 1979 Advisory Council
on Social Security that made such a recommenda
tion, but the House promptly repudiated it in a
396-0 vote. Politicians in both parties have often
promised that they would never vote for a tax on
benefits and President Reagan has said he opposes
the notion.
