# Work-study students favored in department hiring
## 
### KEVIN GROSS Staff writer 
Because of their reliance on federally-funded
work-studv monies to fund research assistant posi
tions. some departments here are making it more
difficult for students who do not qualify for the pro
gram to obtain these jobs.
Most of these departments use the federal money
in an effort to lessen the pressures on their own
budgets,
According to Arlee Kllis, an administrative assis
tant for the political science department, each facul
ty member in that department is allowed to make his
own approach in selecting research assistants. She
added, "It is vcr\ possible that a professor might
say. "It's too bad. I could use vou. but you're not on
work-studv."
At the Hoover Institution, permanent research

fellows look for their own research assistants, ac
cording to Dorothy Sharp, an administrative assis
tant at the institution.
"Thev look for their own research assistants, and
if thev can get work-studv students, then thev will.
Otherwise, it comes out of the department budget,"
Sharp said.
Visiting fellows, such as the national and peace
fellows, do not have any money for hiring student
research assistants and use almost all work-study
students, she said.
Another Hoover employee, who declined to be
identified, said "I think it's a rule They have to be
yyork-studv."
In some departments, like history and economics,
professors prefer to use graduate students as re
search assistants Others may utili/e undergraduates

thev deem outstanding, whom thev have found in
their classes.
According to HI lis, professors who have a re
search grant from a government or a private founda
tion can hire students. Otherwise, she said, they
would gel a work-studv student.
According to Marv Roberts, assistant director of
financial aids, "Some departments do not have
enough in work-studv funds toemplov students."
I he S2M),(HX) provided bv the federal government
in work-studv funds allows different departments
here to finance a number of student positions, in
cluding research assistant positions.
In order to qualifv for work-studv, a student's pa
rent's adjusted gross income must be below S2S.(KX)

A quick look at the job listings avail
able to students qualified for work
studvemployment shows many unfilled
positions, whereas the binder with job
listings for a "University guaranteed
job" are much slimmer.
Almost all departments use students
to help ease the office workload. Evon
Motiska, office manager for the eco
nomics department, said, "We feel an
obligation to hire both work-study and
department-funded students. . .The
University has made a commitment to
these students."
Tim Warner, assistant provost at the
Office of Management and Budget, said

that each school and department must
decide how much funding they will al
locate for department-funded student
positions. He said budgeting for stu
dent employment is "a local decision,"
which might be "one of the items they
would look at (for cutbacks)."
Warner also said,"we would en
courage people to hire students." How
ever, he also noted that, "I think the in
centive is. clear that thev would want to
hire work-study students."
