# Work-study students favored in department hiring

### KEVIN GROSS Staff writer 
Because of their reliance on federally-funded
work-studv monies to fund research assistant posi
tions. some departments here are making it more
difficult for students who do not qualify for the pro
gram to obtain these jobs.
Most of these departments use the federal money
in an effort to lessen the pressures on their own
budgets,
According to Arlee Kllis, an administrative assis
tant for the political science department, each facul
ty member in that department is allowed to make his
own approach in selecting research assistants. She
added, "It is vcr\ possible that a professor might
say. "It's too bad. I could use vou. but you're not on
work-studv."
At the Hoover Institution, permanent research

fellows look for their own research assistants, ac
cording to Dorothy Sharp, an administrative assis
tant at the institution.
"Thev look for their own research assistants, and
if thev can get work-studv students, then thev will.
Otherwise, it comes out of the department budget,"
Sharp said.
Visiting fellows, such as the national and peace
fellows, do not have any money for hiring student
research assistants and use almost all work-study
students, she said.
Another Hoover employee, who declined to be
identified, said "I think it's a rule They have to be
yyork-studv."
In some departments, like history and economics,
professors prefer to use graduate students as re
search assistants Others may utili/e undergraduates

thev deem outstanding, whom thev have found in
their classes.
According to HI lis, professors who have a re
search grant from a government or a private founda
tion can hire students. Otherwise, she said, they
would gel a work-studv student.
According to Marv Roberts, assistant director of
financial aids, "Some departments do not have
enough in work-studv funds toemplov students."
I he S2M),(HX) provided bv the federal government
in work-studv funds allows different departments
here to finance a number of student positions, in
cluding research assistant positions.
In order to qualifv for work-studv, a student's pa
rent's adjusted gross income must be below S2S.(KX)
