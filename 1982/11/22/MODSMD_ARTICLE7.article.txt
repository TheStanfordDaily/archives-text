## World views: steps forward, backward in rights struggle Lech Walesa freed Labor chief walks political tightrope 
### 
C Dmpiled from news reports and wire services
Polish Solidarity leader Lech Walesa is walk
ing the political tightrope.
In the days since the martial-law government
announced that it had ordered the release of
Walesa because he "no longer noses a threat to
the internal security of the state," the interna
tionally-known labor leader has repeatedly re
fused to comment on the military regime led by
Cien. Wojciech Jaruzelski.
Though the former electrician gave no details
during his first press conference last Monday,
he indicated he had been warned that, under
martial-law regulations, he would face arrest if
he attempted to conduct union activity.
Security forces seized Walesa Dec. 13 when

Jaruzelski decreed marital law after 16 months
of strikes and union challenges to Communist
authority. Walesa returned home Nov. 14 from
a government lodge in southeast Poland, where
he spent the last six of his 11 months in intern
ment.
Walesa first learned of his pending release on
Nov. 10 just one dav after he had gotten a three
hour lecture from officials at the prosecutor
general's office in Warsaw.
The labor leader appeared to have changed
little as a result of his months in detention.
While his replies to question on sensitive mat
ters such as Solidarity's future were vague, ob
servers took it to mean Walesa is well aware of
the risks and uncertainties he faces. During the
interview Walesa said he felt like a "man let out
on a tightrope below which is the exercise yard
of a prison â€” and the tightrope is greased." He
added: "I don't intend to fall off."
It is expected that Walesa's public statements
will be carefully monitored not only in Warsaw
but also in Moscow and other Soviet bloc capi
tals. Jaruzelski has stated that authorities in
tend to keep a tight reign on Walesa saying,
"Walesa's future role in Polish affairs will de
pend on the discipline he displays and by his
public utterances and declarations, especially to
the Western press, as well as his future activity."
The dilemma facing Walesa is that over
cautious public statements could lose support
for the movement among a population that has
been more radical during the 11 months of
martial law. Walesa stepped lightly when asked
about Solidarity underground, which includes
many former colleauges and said only that the
leaders of the outlawed union were "following

the dictate of their conscience" and it was not
his place to judge. The 39-vear-old Walesa
promised to work for the release of those de
tained hut did not indicate how he hoped to aid
his colleagues and still avoid government re
prisal.
Walesa then requested a month's time to re
flect on the Polish situation. During his deten
tion Walesa spent much time thinking about
peaceful methods for reaching a "national
agreement" in Poland. "1 worked my methods
out theoretically in mv mind and now I must
test them in practice," he said.
On Saturday Walesa met with Archbishop
Jo/.ef Cilemp for more than two hours. Looking
drawn and tired, Walesa flashed victory signs to
well-wishers, but the Solidarity leaders declined
comment on what was discussed. The first
known meeting with a top church or state leader
since Walesa's release, the conference seemed
aimed at showing church support for the inde
pendent union chief.
Anxious for news from Walesa, crowds
gathered outside St. Brigyda's in Gdansk yes
terday where the freed Solidarity chief was
scheduled to attend morning services. But
Walesa chose instead to attend a small chapel
near his home instead.
There was no explanation for his decision but
there was speculation Walesa decided the ap
pearance might anger Poland's communist au
thorities. Still, others predicted that, like many
Poles, Walesa is biding his time, awaiting the
outcome of an officially announced Parliament
session Dec. 13-14, which has some believing
the government will vote to lift or suspend mili
tary rule.
