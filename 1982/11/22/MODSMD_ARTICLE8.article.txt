# Caricom meets; trade conference turns political
## 
### 
Compiled from news reports and wire services
Meeting for the first time since 1975, the Carib
bean Community conducted a four-day summit in
Jamaica last week which bepan as talks on coordi
nating trade but ended up as an extremely political
conference.
The organization, known as Caricom, is com
posed of twelve nations in the Caribbean
archipelago, including Jamaica, Grenada,
Barbados and Trinidad.
Bypassing talks on the coordination of Carib
bean trade, a regional airline and common invest
ment guidelines, the discussion focused on the state
of human rights and the lack of free elections in so
cialist Grenada.
The tone of the meetings was set when Trinidad
Prime Minister George Chambers, whose oil-rich
nation Rives aid to many Caricom members, began
a dialogue with Grenada's Prime Minister Maurice
Bishop over exactly what Bishop proposed to do
about elections and human rights.
Since the Grenadian revolution three years ago,
there has been no dialogue on that issue, and
Bishop's fellow chiefs are troubled that he holds po
litical prisoners and has close ties to Cuba and the
Soviet Union.
After three days of private meetings, the heads of
government in the English-speaking Caribbean is
sued a general statement — opposed by Grenada —
that supports U.N. human rights standards, which
include free elections "or their equivalent."
Barbados Prime Minister J.M.G. Adams initially
sought to amend the charter of their treaty or
ganization to permit the expulsion of a member-na
tion for violations of human rights or the lack of
free elections.
Bishop replied to these questions by launching a
spirited defense of his revolution, saying that hu
man rights to a job, education, health care and food

are more important and basic than elections and
habeas corpus.
His nation, he said, will never return under his
government to Westminster-style democ-acy. But
he said that his countrymen participate regularly in
government affairs through parish-council meet
ings at which they are consulted in what he said are
meaningful ways on government decisions.
One prime minister expressed concern that lef
tists from their island-nations are passing through
Grenada for training in Libya, East Germany and
Cuba. According to another leading minister,
Bishop denied knowledge of such activities, and of
fered to let representatives of each Caricom govern
ment into Grenada to identify suspected terrorists.
Bishop also assured his colleagues that the large
airport he is now building with Cuban assistance
will not become a Soviet or Cuban base, nor will a
deep-water port that the Soviets have agreed to help
Grenada build.
The island-nations, though facing declining val
ues in their principle exports, nevertheless offer a
strategic location. They are situated in the midst of
shipping lanes, on the edge of the Western world.
When the British-backed parliamentary govern
ment was overthrown in Grenada in 1979, Soviet
and Cuban aid and equipment quickly replaced
Western assistance. Similarly, Jamaica has shifted
from a socialist government where industries were
nationalized to Prime Minsiter Edward Seaga's
capitalistic leadership, where private investment
has returned to the island.
Seaga sent a message to Washington to indicate
that most of the Caricom leaders, with the excep
tion of Grenada, would appreciate U.S. help in pre
venting the eventual collapse of the Caribbean
countries, given their narrow range of resources, ex
ports and capital.
