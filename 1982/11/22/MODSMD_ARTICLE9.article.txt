# Human rights in Iran still not established
## 
### 
In a country which has not
been known for its attention paid
to human rights, the situation in
Iran is less than free.
Streets are steadily patrolled
bv the Revolutionary Guard.
Passersby are often subject to a
rigorous body search upon enter
ing public buildings such as
museums,
The airport departure for
malities require no less than 11
separate checks, and people who
meet incoming passengers are re
quired to wait outside the in
ternational terminal, regardless
of weather conditions.
Conformity is the prevailing
force, and that manifests in anti-
American sentiments. Political
indoctrination begins at age five,
and by early youth children al
ready claim to "hate the United
States."
Indeed, there is a conscious re
jection of all Western practices,
including daily dress. The stan
dard fashion in Iran is a beard,
army fatigue-wear and wind
breakers; ties are scorned as a
symbol of Western values.
People are expected to be seri
ous, and smiles and jokes with
customers in shops are frowned
upon. Music and television are
largely banned and according to

several of the populace, even
stray comments about meat
prices or pop music are con
sidered to carry political under
tones.
Women, relegated now to a
substantially lower social level,
are also bitterly resentful.
Thousands of female employees
were dismissed from government
jobs with the installation of
mullah rule, and any woman with
a divorce or political activities in
her history will not be hired
again, even after dozens of ex
aminations and queries.
Avatollah Khomeini once
said, in accordance with tradi
tional Shiite conviction, that "it
is the martyr who is the essence of
history." On the streets, in shops
and homes hang pictures of Kho
meini as well as of thousands of
men who were martyred in the
revolution or in the 25-month
war with Iraq.
On the whole, there is a per
vasive sense of being closed in
and not permitted to veer from a
certain set of social rules. There
may be enough food, with the ex
ception of some rationing, and
no bloodshed on the streets, but
societal rumblings indicate the
people are far from content.
