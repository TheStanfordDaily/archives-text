# Univ. Hospital access controversy continues
## 
### Second in a series By KRISTEN CHRISTOPHER Senior staff writer 
Sometimes drastic actions force the
settlement of a dispute. In a conflict be
tween the Stanford University Hospital
and community physicians, actions for
mally taken by state and local govern
ments last summer have made a quick
resolution to an old problem im
perative.
The dispute, which has gone on for
several years, concerns how much ac
cess doctors in the Stanford area should
have to the hospital's facilities.
A new Medi-Cal bill, signed by Gov.
Brown in June and effective Jan. 1, con
tained an open-access provision apply
ing to hospitals that contract with
Medi-Cal. Less than two months later,
the Palo Alto City Council linked its en
dorsement of the Certificate of Need for
the Hospital Modernization Project to
progress toward settling the access is
sue.
An amendment to the original Medi-
Cal bill provides for limited access to
the departments of radiology,
anesthesiology and pathology.
The hospital was "one of the leaders"
in getting the legislation amended, said
Lawrence Crowley, University vice
president for medical affairs, and would
like to see the legislation amended
further, to exempt teaching hospitals
from the open-access provision.
A local resolution of the problem
would enhance the University's ability
to change the legislation. An agreement
would also secure the City Council's en
dorsement of the modernization plan.
Nearly everyone involved believes
that substantial progress toward settl
ing the conflict has been made in the last
few months, but some problems remain
in hospital-based clinics and labora
tories, primarily radiology,
anesthesiology and pathology.
Currently, about 45 area physicians
have access to hospital-based services.
A larger number can admit patients to
the hospital, said Crowley.
Most university hospitals are "gener
ally fairly closed" to doctors from the
surrounding community, according to

Hewlett Lee, executive director of the
Palo Alto Medical Foundation, but
"this hospital had kind of a different
background."
Originally, the hospital was jointly
owned by the University and Palo Alto.
However, Stanford officials decided
that setup was not satisfactory, accord
ing to City Councilman Larry Klein,
and in 1967, bought out the city's half.
A contract between Palo Alto and the
University contained some provisions
regarding community physicians, but
the terms for access to the hospital were
not specific enough, Klein said.
"This has been a continuing issue but
it has been particularly aggravated in
the last three or four years," he said,
due to the hospital's efforts to "limit, if
not eliminate access."
In Aug. 1978, the hospital board of
directors issued a memorandum stating
that no further access to hospital-based
services would be granted to communi
ty physicians.
Since then, negotiations between the
hospital and the community have been
ongoing. A nine-member group com
prised of hospital board members, com
munity members and faculty physicians
called the "access committee" is cur
rently the main source of interaction.
The access committee has "made a
lot of progress in the last few months,"
according to Lee, a member of the com
mittee. However, "there are still some
significant differences in philosophy or
ideology."
According to Crowley, the Palo Alto
Clinic played a significant role in
pushing the original provision through,
"however, the amendment to it and the
position we took was a position which
was strongly taken by every single ma
jor teaching hospital in the state â€” it
wasn't just a Stanford inside argument
with the Palo Alto Clinic.
"They have indicated since this all
happened that they basically support us
on the limited-access policy and they
would be willing to support us in getting
the legislation changed, so I have to
take them on their word."
Members of the medical community
differ in their past and present support
of the provision. The Palo Alto Medical
Foundation, supported the open-access
provision, Lee said, but "we don't plan
on wide-open access to anything."
Jay Thorwaldson, the foundation's
director of public relations, said mem
bers of the clinic are "dealing very close
ly" with University President Donald
Kennedy, Robert Rosenzweig, vice
president for Public Affairs, and
Crowley. After a "limited-controlled
access" settlement is reached on the lo

cal level, they will support a change in
the legislation, he said.
Burt McDowell, a Menlo Medical
Clinic doctor and former head of Com
munity Physicians for Patient Care,
said the group "would support amend
ing the legislation if the current access
committee can come up with an ade
quate agreement."
However, that group, which was
formed after the Aug. 1976 memo and is
comprised mainly of physicians from
the Palo Alto and Menlo clinics, never
supported the provision, according to
McDowell.
There are doctors at the Palo Alto
Clinic who currently not allowed to use
facilities at the hospital but would like

to be able to do so. Jane Marmor, a ra
diation therapist, said there is "ev
eryday equipment" necessary for her
work that "the clinic has always wanted
to be able to use." But she said. "I
doubt very much that unless Stanford is
pushed very hard that we will be able to
use the facilities."
Palo Alto Clinic radiation therapists
have presented their position to hospi
tal officials, according to Victor Fish, a
member of that group, "but we have
not heard from them." He said he un
derstands the hospital's position, but
added, "I think I do know what is best
for the patients, but our goals are not
the same."
It appears the clinic has been more

successful in negotiating for access to
the cardiac catheterization laboratory.
Joel Friedman, a Palo Alto
cardiologist, said that an agreement
should be announced shortly and"it
will probably be a positive result."
Although Palo Alto Clinic
anesthesiologists use the hospital fre
quently, Kevin Wheaton, head of that
department, said, "We are restricted in
our access in that we can't add new peo
ple to the department." They are also
involved in negotiations with Stanford,
he said.
If community physicians are not suf
ficiently pleased by the outcome of
these specific negotiations there may be
some danger that the City Council will

withdraw its endorsement of the
Certificate of Need for the Hospital
Modernization Project. Klein said that
a resolution passed by the council dur
ing the summer approved the
certificate, but also gave the council
leverage to withdraw the endorsement
if community doctors are dissatisfied
with the access situation.
Originally, the council was going to
reconsider the endorsement after a 90-
day period, but since the hospital has
decided to delay its application for the
certificate because of potential financial
problems, that time period has been ex
tended, according to McDowell.
