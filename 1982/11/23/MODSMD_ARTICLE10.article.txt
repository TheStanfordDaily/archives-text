# Fasting... beyond today
## 
### 
Those of us who are fortunate enough to live in a
developed nation where food is plentiful are asked
to fast today and give the money saved on food to
organizations dedicated to alleviating world and lo
cal hunger. Here, dormitory residents taking part in
the fast are turning in meal cards, and food service
is contributing 53.40 for each participant to the
Stanford Committee on Hunger, which then
donates the money to relief organizations.
Although if enough people participate in the fast
the total amount being donated might add up to a
respectable sum, the money is secondary to the goal
of increased community awareness of world hun
ger. To meet this goal organizers of the fast have
planned a number of lectures and discussions on
the underlying, structural causes of hunger in the
world and in the United States.
Fast Day provides an excellent starting point for
people to begin thinking about the causes and pos
sible solutions to the problem of world hunger. Al
though the excercise of going a day without food
can in no way simulate the extreme poverty, hunger
and malnutrition that is a way of life — and death
— for millions of people throughout the world, it
can at least allow us to realize how much we take for
granted our own good fortune. The distant, some
times vague notion of world hunger can be ap-

preciated more fully through the symbolic act of
fasting for a day.
A physical awareness, even if only partial, of the
acute hunger problem facing many of the world's
inhabitants will perhaps stimulate discussion and
increased awareness of the complex reasons why
hunger and starvation continue to be a reality for
many people in the world. An understanding of the
basic underpinnings of world poverty is important
when deciding what individual actions a person
should take or which government policies one
should work for or against to help reduce world
hunger.
Although stopgap measures such as emergency
food aid are often necessary to prevent massive
starvation in critical situations, long-term pro
grams attacking the structural causes of hunger
provide the only effective solutions to the problem.
Although our isolated and prosperous environ
ment insulates us from the realities of world hun
ger, participation in today's activities may bring us
closer to an understanding of the problem and a re
alistic assessment of what we can hope to do to help
solve it. Although there is a particular reason to
focus on the problem today we shouid by no means
confine our actions and thoughts concerning world
hunger to today alone.
