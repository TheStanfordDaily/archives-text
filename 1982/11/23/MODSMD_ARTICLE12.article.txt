## Alchohol, dorm funds don't mix 
### 
California law states that it is illegal
for people under the age of 21 to con
sume alcoholic beverages. California
law does not make special exceptions
for college dorms. Nevertheless, dorms
often make it a policy to purchase alco
hol for their underage residents.
Prohibition of alcohol didn't work.
Prohibition probably won't ever work,
not even when it is limited to a specific
age group. But the problem becomes
quite different when residences use
house dues, thus taking money from
non-drinkers as well as drinkers, to buy
alcohol for students who are often still
in their late teens.
When students bring alcoholic
beverages to a party they are doing so
on their own initiative and they are sole
ly responsible. When University con
trolled housing does so, it is indicating
that it condones the breaking of a law.
Using alcohol is an individual
judgment. Can the University justify
buying it because a large percentage —
possibly the majority — of Stanford
students consume it?
It is illegal for anyone to use mari
juana. Can residences choose to buy
marijuana for "pot-parties?" Or what
about a "white Christmas" — with co
caine? After all, for many students here,
alcohol is still a controlled substance.
Maybe the most ridiculous aspect to
this situation is the so-called non-alco
holic alternative beverage policy. This
rule dictates that a non-alcoholic
beverage be served wherever alcoholic
beverages are formally made available.
The "alternative," generally being less
expensive (and less consumed), en
courages and reinforces the perception
that the University is accepting respon
sibility for such an option — and that
it's not only fair, but legal.

Many people misinterpret the law in
California and say that it only concerns
the purchase of alcohol by those under
21 — but, in fact, the consumption itself
is legally outlawed. So, in effect, there is
little difference between serving alcohol
in a residence cafeteria and in a house
social event.
Let me emphasize that if residences,
as a unit, discontinued the purchase of
alcohol, it would in no way necessarily
lead to a decrease in the consumption of
alcoholic beverages. The question isn't

whether the University/residences
should intervene in the affairs of stu
dents who choose to consume alcohol;
but rather, the decision is a question of
whether or not to propagate alcohol il
legally. N
Indeed, the separation of alcohol
from organized residential events will
be a happv hour for all of us.
