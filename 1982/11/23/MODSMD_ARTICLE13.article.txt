## Following the elections, Fred Utopia is suffering from withdrawal 
### 
"Doctor, you've got to help me!"
said Mr. Fred Utopia, pacing the floor.
"I can't stand the agony much longer!"
"Now, now," said the doctor, "why
don't you lie down and tell Dr. Luno all
about it."
"Well, it all started when the NFL
players went out on strike. All of a sud
den I had all this free time on Sundays,
Mondays and Thursdays, hut now the
strike is settled."
"So what's the problem?"
"I'm addicted to politics!"
"Oh no!" said Doctor Luno.
"I'm afraid it's true, Doc," Fred re
plied. "It started so innocently, too,
when I signed a petition for the bottle
bill and dropped off a neighbor at a
Sierra Club meeting."
"Then what happened?"

"Well, nothing, for a while. But soon,
I was getting all this campaign literature
in the mail, and after a while, I even
started reading it. The turning point,
though, came when I actually paid at
tention to a Jerry Brown commercial."
"You should have come to me a lot
sooner," said the doctor.
"I know, I know, but they were so ap
pealing: all those friendly looking celeb
rities and then the big H-bomb. Any
way, soon I was following Pete Wilson's
rebuttals, and then I got into the
gubernatorial race, and that was it: I
spent all my waking hours switching
channels on the TV, stopping only
when 1 found a campaign ad. I must
have seen Tom Lantos burp a thousand
times!"
"Please, Mr. Utopia, take it easy on

that pillow!"
"Oh, sorry. Anyway, pretty soon I
started getting interested in the races
across the country. I spent lots of time
worrying if Charles Thone was going to
be re-elected governor of Nebraska,
whether Mark White could overcome
the incumbent governor's well-financed
campaign in Texasand whether Big Jim
Thompson could negate high un
employment and Stevenson's name rec
ognition in Illinois."
"Hmmm, you do sound like an ad
dict."
"You're telling me! The biggest high
of all came on election night. I invited
some Army buddies over, brought out
the beer and popcorn, made some last
minute bets with my bookie and settled
in for a long evening of professional

politics! Sure, it started out slow, but
once ABC announced Frank Lauten
berg won in New Jersey the evening was
off and running. I savored the instant
replay of George Wallace drooling in
Alabama and loved every minute of the
in-depth interview with Bob Dole. Then
came the California contests and noth
ing could beat those pollsters blowing
the call on the senate and gubernatorial
races. I was in ecstacy! It was the
greatest night of my life!"
"So what's wrong now?" asked the
doctor.
"What's wrong?!" screamed Fred.
"It's all over, that's what's wrong! I just
spent half a year living with big-league
American politics and now I've got to
quit cold turkey! Not even Art
Buchwald is talking about the elections

any longer. Even worse, now we've got
to put up with these bozos as elected of
ficials!"
Fred collapsed to the floor in tears,
muttering: "Twomore years, two more
years!"

"Nurse," said Dr. Luno into his in
tercom, "cancel the rest of my appoint
ments. This one is going to take a
while."

mathematics.)

to put up with these bozos as elected of
ficials!"
Fred collapsed to the floor in tears,
muttering: "Twomore years, two more
years!"

ments. This one is going to take a
while."
