## Overpopulation is not the only cause of starvation and suffering 
### 
I'lease consider todav that people
starving and suffering from malnutri
tion are doing so not simply due to ov
erpopulation. Keep in mind that there
rcallv are no shortages of resources in
most places. Also, people in desper
ation arc not too lazy to work, unless
malnutrition itself has sapped their
energies.
What then is the cause of the suffer
ing? We tend to think that the problem
of children withering in the Horn of
Africa due to famine has a different
cause than the problems in this nation
in communities such as East Palo Alto,
where families are evicted from their
apartments when Social Security
checks do not arrive on time. In reality,
the causes of the proh'em here and
abroad are essentially the same.
Basicallv the problem consists of a
lack of access to the resources needed
for survival due to political and eco
nomic inequalities. In developing na
tions chronic hunger and malnutrition
occur often among the landless, but

there is no shortage of farmland in most
countries where this type of suffering
takes place. In Brazil, for example,
more cultivated acreage exists per per
son than in the United States, yet
malnutrition has increased during the
last few years. People do not have ac
cess to this land to grow on it what they
need, nor is what thev need cultivated
by those who do control the land.
Where necessary foods are produced,
fe*v can generate the income to
purchase what is needed.
In Bangladesh, a verv densly popu
lated nation, there is enough wheat for
each person to consume 2500 calories
per day, but the average consumption is
1500 per day. Most of the wheat is dis
tributed in urban areas, where about 15
percent of the population lives, while
many in the countryside, especially the
landless, starve. Again, there is simply
no access to what is needed.
Consider, too, the case of famine in
contrast to long-term, chronic
malnutrition. Surelv famine is a situ

ation where quite clearly there is not
enough food to go around. The truth,
though, is much more complex. During
the Ethiopian drought of 1973-1975, in
which at least 100,000 people starved,
the Selassie regime had in storage at
least one-half the grain needed to keep
these people alive. The decision-makers
most likely had their eyes on the in
ternational grain markets. In the case of
the 1977 drought in Ghana, the United
States abandoned efforts to give grain
to people suffering because most of the
food never reached the people who
needed it. All of the blame should not
be put on those of Ghana who made the
task difficult — if we in the United Staes
had really cared, we could have seen to
it that the grain arrived.
In the United States, even as near to
us as East Palo Alto, people do not have
access to the jobs that they need. Ob
viously members of the Stanford com
munity cannot procure employment for
the unemploved in the area, but we can
struggle to bring about just investments

of governments and even private funds
so that jobs are developed. In the mean
time, we can help out by better using the
10 percent of the food that is discarded
daily bv the Stanford Food Service. Just
as in the case of Ethiopia, we, the people
nearby, have something that we are not
using, and due to their lack of what we
have (what we throw out), others suffer.
Why don't those who are suffering
have access to what they need — land,
food, jobs — in order to survive. Surely
the problem is a political one, since un
equal access to life-sustaining resources
almost always coincides with an un
equal access to power; those with power
decide how resources shall be used,
whether they be scarce or not. The
problem is also a spiritual one, since our
poverty of care and compassion is what
leads to inequitable distributions in the
first place.

I'lease consider todav that people
starving and suffering from malnutri
tion are doing so not simply due to ov
erpopulation. Keep in mind that there
rcallv are no shortages of resources in
most places. Also, people in desper
ation arc not too lazy to work, unless
malnutrition itself has sapped their
energies.
What then is the cause of the suffer
ing? We tend to think that the problem
of children withering in the Horn of
Africa due to famine has a different
cause than the problems in this nation
in communities such as East Palo Alto,
where families are evicted from their
apartments when Social Security
checks do not arrive on time. In reality,
the causes of the proh'em here and
abroad are essentially the same.
Basicallv the problem consists of a
lack of access to the resources needed
for survival due to political and eco
nomic inequalities. In developing na
tions chronic hunger and malnutrition
occur often among the landless, but

there is no shortage of farmland in most
countries where this type of suffering
takes place. In Brazil, for example,
more cultivated acreage exists per per
son than in the United States, yet
malnutrition has increased during the
last few years. People do not have ac
cess to this land to grow on it what they
need, nor is what thev need cultivated
by those who do control the land.
Where necessary foods are produced,
fe*v can generate the income to
purchase what is needed.
In Bangladesh, a verv densly popu
lated nation, there is enough wheat for
each person to consume 2500 calories
per day, but the average consumption is
1500 per day. Most of the wheat is dis
tributed in urban areas, where about 15
percent of the population lives, while
many in the countryside, especially the
landless, starve. Again, there is simply
no access to what is needed.
Consider, too, the case of famine in
contrast to long-term, chronic
malnutrition. Surelv famine is a situ

ation where quite clearly there is not
enough food to go around. The truth,
though, is much more complex. During
the Ethiopian drought of 1973-1975, in
which at least 100,000 people starved,
the Selassie regime had in storage at
least one-half the grain needed to keep
these people alive. The decision-makers
most likely had their eyes on the in
ternational grain markets. In the case of
the 1977 drought in Ghana, the United
States abandoned efforts to give grain
to people suffering because most of the
food never reached the people who
needed it. All of the blame should not
be put on those of Ghana who made the
task difficult — if we in the United Staes
had really cared, we could have seen to
it that the grain arrived.
In the United States, even as near to
us as East Palo Alto, people do not have
access to the jobs that they need. Ob
viously members of the Stanford com
munity cannot procure employment for
the unemploved in the area, but we can
struggle to bring about just investments

of governments and even private funds
so that jobs are developed. In the mean
time, we can help out by better using the
10 percent of the food that is discarded
daily bv the Stanford Food Service. Just
as in the case of Ethiopia, we, the people
nearby, have something that we are not
using, and due to their lack of what we
have (what we throw out), others suffer.
Why don't those who are suffering
have access to what they need — land,
food, jobs — in order to survive. Surely
the problem is a political one, since un
equal access to life-sustaining resources
almost always coincides with an un
equal access to power; those with power
decide how resources shall be used,
whether they be scarce or not. The
problem is also a spiritual one, since our
poverty of care and compassion is what
leads to inequitable distributions in the
first place.
