# Stanford in 1890

### EMMA MITCHELL 
Imagine a Stanford without distribution requirements or
grades. Envision spending only $20 a month on room and
board. Now really let your imagination soar and believe that
there is no tuition.
This is the way it was for the 185 students who comprised
Stanford's first complete graduating class. Had you been one of
these "pioneers," as the members of the class of'9s were called,
your experiences at college would have been quite different
from those of students almost a century later.
Life as a Stanford student in the '90s was the topic of a talk
last week by historian George Nash at Branner Hall. Nash, who
spoke in particular of Herbert Hoover, is writing a multi-vol
ume biography of Hoover, which he expects will take 12 years to
complete.
The work, commissioned by the Herbert Hoover Presidential
Library Association in lowa, Hoover's birthplace, has taken
Nash around the world in search of information. Research has
brought him to the Hoover Institution several times since he
began writing in 1975.
The first volume of the biography, entitled Life of Herbert
Hoover: The Engineer, 1874-1914, will be published this winter.
It contains two chapter concerning Hoover's years at Stanford.
As well as being an active trustee for half a century, Hoover was
instrumental in founding the Business School, the Hoover Li
brary and the Food Research Institute, projects which prompt
Nash to call him "Stanford's greatest benefactor."
Students were particularly entertained by examples of life
here in the '90s. Those "pioneers" arrived in the fall of'9l and
got off the train at Menlo Park because Palo Alto did not exist
yet. The dorms weren't quite finished so they didn't have hot
water or electricity for a couple of months.
There were confrontations between fraternity members and
"barbarians" — "barbs" for short — who, like Hoover, didn't
pledge. The co-eds were nicknamed "Angels."
A poem dedicated to them in the first Quad assured all who
were worried that Stanford men didn't really consider them,
"creature of brain entirely," who had "fled the world and its
masculine charms," to earn A.B. They gallantly dismissed the
lines, "People say she's wondrous bright/But her figure's an aw
ful sight," and instead wrote, "The co-ed is a thing of
grace/With dainty figure and winsome face." For her "each
month is a round of joy," and "A.B. means nothing if not 'A
Boy.' "
