# Debt from new housing a factor
## Slight student room rate increase expected 
### KAREN SPRINGEN 
A Residential Education task group charged with
setting the rates foron-campus housing for 1983-84
will likely recommend only slight rent increases for
undergraduate and graduate housing next year, ac
cording to Ed Scoles, director of housing man
agement.
"Next fall we will see some modest changes ... I
think it's going to be close to the end of winter quar
ter before a final set of rates is determined," Scoles
said.
In addition to increases resulting froiti inflation
and shifts in the payment structure, in
crease because of University mortgage payments,
known as debt service. Debt service will increase be
cause of the new Governor's Corner housing, ac
cording to committee member Eric Berg, a graduate
student.
The annual debt from Governor's Corner (Ster

ling, the four Independent Houses, the suites and the
eating clubs) will represent an enormous fraction of
the total annual debt payment for student housing
as a whole, which Berg predicted will increase $2
million for 1983-84. Governor's Corner was built
when interest rates and construction payments were
high, he said.
Res Ed is committed to offering similar room
rates to all students in the housing system. As a re
sult, the costs of the 800-unit housing complex will
be borne by all studtents here, Berg said. If this were
not the* case, students in new housing.would byive
rents "twice as high as everyone else's," he said.
Students often complain that suite residents
should pay substantially higher rates than residents
of older dorms such as Stem, Wilbur or Manzanita
Park. But Financial Analyist Linda Mclntyre said,
"There's a general philosophy . . . that you don't set

price differences for amenities."
"All rates will be higher than they would have
been had that new housing not been built . . . My
guess is that everyone's rents will go up this year,"
Berg said.
Because of the new housing, the existing price
structure, developed five years ago, is obsolete. The
new task force recommendations should better re
flect the relative levels and costs of service now pro
vided to residents of the different housing areas, ac
cording to Scoles.
But Berg said many graduate students don't see
why it makes sense for their rents to go up to pay for
a new undergraduate housing complex.
Committee member Eric Pearson said, "The basic
undergraduate housing rate came out to be about
the same." Suites, self-ops, eating clubs and three-

bedroom apartments in Escondido will
probably have slightly higher rates, he
said.
"On top of the shifts there arc some
inflationary changes," Pearson said.
Recommendations are made on an
analysis of this year's budget, Pearson
said. "If our policy were in effect this
year, this is what people would have
paid. Some people's rates will go up
more than others because of the change
in the base," he added.
Student committee member Dave
Daleke said, "We're just using this
year's budget to try to determine a rate
structure . . . (with) that structure you
can just plug in any figures."
Escondido Village room rents will
probably represent the largest increase,
Daleke said. The committee considers
equity and asks "do all the figures look
right?" he said. "The biggest differences
were in Escondido."
The task force works for long-term
equitable distribution of new housing
costs, Scoles said. Rates will not in
crease dramatically in one year, he said.
"1 had some ideas as to what the ad
ministrators were expecting the results
would be ... What they expected was
that more of the debt services cost
would be shifted to graduate housing,"
Pearson said.
For the first time, the study com
bined undergraduate and graduate
housing. In past studies, Escondido Vil
lage and Mirrielees were considered
separately.
The task force is "essentially break
ing costs down on a per person month
basis," Pearson said. Escondido Village
is unique in that residents are billed per
month rather than by academic quar
ter.
This year American Studies, the Ital
ian House, Haus Mittleuropa, the
French House and East House with
$687 room rates are the most expensive,
according to Scoles.
Co-ops and self-ops now pay lower
rates because they do without Univer
sity custodial service. But Berg ques
tioned the validity of this reasoning.
"Even though they do their own
custodial care, the University spends a
lot to clean up at the end of the year,"
Berg said.
Rates will be recommended for the
following categories of housing: stan
dard undergraduate residences with
custodial service provided; standard
graduate residences with custodial ser
vice provided; Manzanita Park; Mir
rielees; cooperative and self-ops with
custodial and food service provided by
residences; partial service houses with
custodial service provided by the Uni
versity but food service arranged by res
idents; suites; singles in Escondido Vil
lage; and family apartments.
