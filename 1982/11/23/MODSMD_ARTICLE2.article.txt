# Debt from new housing a factor
## Slight student room rate increase expected 
### KAREN SPRINGEN 
A Residential Education task group charged with
setting the rates foron-campus housing for 1983-84
will likely recommend only slight rent increases for
undergraduate and graduate housing next year, ac
cording to Ed Scoles, director of housing man
agement.
"Next fall we will see some modest changes ... I
think it's going to be close to the end of winter quar
ter before a final set of rates is determined," Scoles
said.
In addition to increases resulting froiti inflation
and shifts in the payment structure, in
crease because of University mortgage payments,
known as debt service. Debt service will increase be
cause of the new Governor's Corner housing, ac
cording to committee member Eric Berg, a graduate
student.
The annual debt from Governor's Corner (Ster

ling, the four Independent Houses, the suites and the
eating clubs) will represent an enormous fraction of
the total annual debt payment for student housing
as a whole, which Berg predicted will increase $2
million for 1983-84. Governor's Corner was built
when interest rates and construction payments were
high, he said.
Res Ed is committed to offering similar room
rates to all students in the housing system. As a re
sult, the costs of the 800-unit housing complex will
be borne by all studtents here, Berg said. If this were
not the* case, students in new housing.would byive
rents "twice as high as everyone else's," he said.
Students often complain that suite residents
should pay substantially higher rates than residents
of older dorms such as Stem, Wilbur or Manzanita
Park. But Financial Analyist Linda Mclntyre said,
"There's a general philosophy . . . that you don't set

price differences for amenities."
"All rates will be higher than they would have
been had that new housing not been built . . . My
guess is that everyone's rents will go up this year,"
Berg said.
Because of the new housing, the existing price
structure, developed five years ago, is obsolete. The
new task force recommendations should better re
flect the relative levels and costs of service now pro
vided to residents of the different housing areas, ac
cording to Scoles.
But Berg said many graduate students don't see
why it makes sense for their rents to go up to pay for
a new undergraduate housing complex.
Committee member Eric Pearson said, "The basic
undergraduate housing rate came out to be about
the same." Suites, self-ops, eating clubs and three-

complex near Lake Lagunita, like the one pictured above, are newer and
more luxurious than others, there wikl be no price differences among Univer
