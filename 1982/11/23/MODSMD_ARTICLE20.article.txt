## ACT's 'The Chalk Garden': clever writing, unresolved metaphor 
### MARC FAJER 
Enid Bagnold's The Chalk
Garden is an interesting combina
tion of British drawing room
farce and tightly knit mystery. It
sports a slightly dotty old wom
an, her equally crazy grand
daughter (apart from certain fix
ations connected with fire, she is
a charming, intelligent girl), a
judge, a mysterious governess
and a butler-in-training who is an
ex-convict. The show also in
cludes some very fine language,
although the attempts at symbol
ism are a bit overdone. The
American Conservatory Theatre
production, directed by Dakin
Matthews, displays the language
and most of the characters to
their best advantage and pro
vides an entertaining evening of
theater.
Matthews' direction is the best
of the ACT season so far. There is
some sloppiness in the early
going, as some of the lines in the
first act are delivered poorly, but
the second act is tight and tense.
The judge's visit to lunch in that
act is perfectly paced; the slow ex

position of a long past murder
trial is neatly punctuated with
laugh lines and leaves audience
members on the edge of their
seats.
Barbara Dirickson as Miss
Madrigal, the mysterious gover
ness, gives an intriguing per
formance which reveals a com
plex woman trying to deal with
her past and the potential dan
gerous situation she is in. The
transition from tight-lipped ap
plicant for the governess job to
"the boss," (as she becomes
known) is well-handled and ex
cept for a few overplayed at
tempts to burst into tears, she is
always fascinating and believ
able. Dirickson is at her best in a
fit of righteousness in the second
act, when she informs the grand
mother (Marrian Walters) that
she must choose between Miss
Madrigal and her former butler,
Prinkbell, who is attempting to
run the household and the garden
from his deathbed. "Must I be
dumb when you and I approach
together the time of year when all
next summer must stand or fall

bv us! Have you time — before
death — to throw away season
after season?" The terrified old
woman gives in, of course.
Annette Bening, playing the
granddaughter, captures the
craziness and the adolescence of
the character very nicely. The
best sequence in the show is a
guessing game called "The Sky's
the Limit" which she plays with
Madrigal. The two seek to un
cover as much as they can about
the other, while revealing as little
as possible about themselves.
This fencing match is both well
directed and acted and is a pleas
ure to watch. Ray Reinhardt
turns in a very funny per
formance as the not-quite-com
petent not-quite-butler, trying
desperately to fill the shoes of the
dying Pinkbell. Sydney Walker is
also fine as the slightly cynical ag
ing judge, especially in his con
frontation with Madrigal in the
third act.
ACT veteran Marrian Walters
as Mrs. St. Maugham, the grand
mother, gives the most un
satisfactory performance.. She

never seems flighty or eccentric
enough — certainly not the sort
of woman who acts bizarre just to
be noticed. The down-to-earth
quality Walters brings to the
stage seems out of place among
the strange characters that peo
ple her house, and when we are
informed by Madrigal at play's
end that she never really loved
her granddaughter, it is a sur
prise; their relationship seemed
genuine enough earlier.
The largest problem with this
production, however, is that it
fails to reconcile the largest prob
lem in the play itself. The per
sistent allusions to flowers in a
garden as a metaphor for grow
ing children never quite resolve
themselves. It is not entirely clear
what exactly a "chalk garden"
does to people to stunt their
growth. Despite this, the produc
tion is worth seeing. It plays at
the Geary Theatre in San Fran
cisco in repertory through Janu
ary 22. Overall, the clever writing
and interesting performances ov
ercome the flaws of the play.
