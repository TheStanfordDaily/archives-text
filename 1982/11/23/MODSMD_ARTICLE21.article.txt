# Ivan Moravec: lots of notes, very loud, and lots and lots of drama
## 
### MARC VINCENTI 
The Bay Area has lately been moving through a pian
istic meteor-shower; good classical pianists have rained
down upon us thick and fast. The most recent shooting
star to hit town was Ivan Moravec, who gave a recital at
the Masonic Auditorium in San Francisco on Saturday
night.
Before the recital I knew nothing about Moravec, but I
remedied this by forming some preconceptions about
him, based on his announced program. When I see
Beethoven's "Appassionata" sonata on the same bill
with reams of Debussy, with nocturnes and the B-minor
scherzo by Chopin, and with something by Janacek
called "In the Mist" — then I say to myself "Here comes
one of those pianists who likes to play lots of notes, very
loudly." I assume that the Beethoven sonata will be
played first, as a sort of mandatory bow to the classical
era before getting on to "more important things," and
that it was chosen more for its romantic tempestuousness
than its classical proportions. I assume, too, that it will
drown in the same acoustical blur that Debussy tends to
induce — not to mention heaven-knows-what foggy
sonorities may belong to something called "In the Mist."
All this, coupled with Chopin's nocturnes, sounded to me
like a lot of heavy pedalling, heavy breathing and at
mospherics.
It was not to be. Ivan Moravec is no dreamer with his
head in the clouds; he is a meticulous craftsman, with feet
planted firmly on the earth, who treats a single note with
the loving care and scrupulous exactness that one things
of as necessary to Haydn or Mazart. His performance
could hardly be labelled facile, decorative, or noisy; rath
er, it showed him grappling with deep feelings. He
searched these pieces for their stark dramatic power, not
for their flashy effects. Indeed, though there was much
sensitivity in his performance, there was little that could
be called tranquil or happy. He was immersed in a world
that was turbulent and gripping.
Even the Chopin nocturnes, which so often are played
for their moods, their loveliness, were played by Moravec
as brief tragic dramas — as struggles played out through
the clash of quiet and stormy passages, and in the con

frontation between major and minor keys. Even in the
selection <}112 the four nocturnes, Moravec revealed himself
to be particularly conscientious with regard to key rela
tionships. Each successive nocturne was in the key of the
dominant of the preceding nocturne.
For example, Moravec began with Opus 32, No. 1 in B
major, and followed it with Opus 15, No. 2 in F-sharp
major. He then "modulated" to the two nocturnes, Opus
27, which share the same key (C-sharp and D-flat), but in
its major and minor modes. Thus, the architecture of key
changes between these pieces created an underlying sense
of instability and irresolution, further heightening the
dramatic tension.
If anything, Moravec's program was so full of dramat
ic tension that, by the end, it was too much to absorb. He
played for a solid two hours — no mean feat with this
kind of music — and toward the end he was mopping his
brow. Contrary to my expectations, the program ended
with the "Appassionata" sonata — an indication that
Morovec viewed it with full seriousness, not as a mere
nod to the classical style. But, unfortunately, the restless
key-changes of Beethoven's opening movement tend to
lose their impact if you have just finished playing
Chopin's B-minor scherzo. Chopin's piece is so passion
ately restless that anything coming after it called "Ap
passionata" can't help but seem too much of a good
thing. Taken together, these two pieces are about as fran
tic as you can get at the piano, short of banging your head
on the keys and chewing on the fallboard.
The stress of Moravec's performing was mirrored in
his face. He is, on the whole, a plain-looking man — bald,
a bit jowly — who takes his bows in a neat, clipped fash
ion, moving with the deftness of a conductor's baton. But
when Moravec starts to play, his face springs into action:
his eyes blink, his brow twitches, his mouth purses and
unpurses. At the end of Debussy's "Feux d'artifice"
("Fireworks"), right before he set off the final pianist'r
skyrocket — a two-handed flissando that shoots through
five octaves — Moravec gasped for breath with such
force that he looked like a firefighter in need of an oxygen
mask.
As far as technique is concerned, Moravec is striking in

several respects. His fingers are strong; he can ripple off,
with clarity and definition, the long skein of 32nd-notes
that concludes Debussy's "Pagodes" and the shimmering
64th-notes in "Feux d'artifice." The "Presto con fuoco"
of Chopin's scherzo was astonishingly fast and agile,
though played more for its overall surge than for its indi
vidual sparks. In Debussy's "Jardins sous la plui"
("Gardens in the rain") all the water-beads were strung
evenly, right in place.
Moravec's feet work almost as hard as his hands. He
uses the soft pedal in generous helpings, and his right foot
works with such energy and precision on the damper
pedal, that it is apt to fly a full three inches off the pedal
when briskly releasing. Also, in Debussy's "La
Cathedrale engloutie," Moravec's special variation on
legato pedalling stood in high relief. In moving from
chord to chord, he sometimes releases the pedal not si
multaneously with the striking of the new chord, but a
moment after, so that the new chord overlaps the old one
for a split second. This worked well for Debussy, but was
inappropriate at times in Chopin.
Moravec has a strong rhythmic sense. He is not afraid
that a strict tempo will seem dull, and he's equally un
afriad that a big ritardando will seem to drag. He showed
that Debussy can thrive upon a regular pulse just as much
as Beethoven can. In Chopin, his rhythms have a tensile
. strength, like a tightly-coiled spring. His rubato (Italian
for "robbed") does riot dawdle, but is as deft as any pick
pocket.
Above all, Moravec has the ability to communicate
agitated feelings while yet playing smoothly — without
lurching from soft to loud. He achieves tension by sharp
contrasts between passages rather than by turbid playing
within passages. At the end of the Chopin scherzo, the
eight-measure octave run — though Moravec played it
with only slight accents and crescendo — had the swift,
even impetus of an arrow heading for its mark.
In particular in Debussy, Moravec showed that he had
taken to heart the composer's frequent instruction to play
"sane nuances" or "presque sans nuances." In music that
, might sometimes seem to contain nothing but nuance,

Moravec showed the benefits to be gained from playing
sometimes with unshaded dynamics and steady rhythm;
he showed the expressive possibilities to be found in inex
pressiveness. "La Cathedrale engloutie" became "pro
fondement calme" in the deepest sense, because Moravec
measured its vaults in stately, hymn-like strides.
On the other hand, it was surprising how much rubato
filled swooning went on in "Soiree dans Grenade," in the
loud passage marked "tres rythme." The same was true in
the major-key appearance of the theme in the first move
ment of the "Appassionata." Confoundingly, Beethoven
says that this tune should be played "softly, tranquilly,
with much expression but without affectation." Thus of
fered a choice of two directions in which to err, Moravec
chose to be overly soulful. This was surprising in a rendi
tion of the sonata that was otherwise incisive and brisk.
Lastly, to touch on a couple of points I've missed:
Janacek's "In the Mist" turned out to be not at all foggy.
In four short movements, the work contrasts simple,
haunting melodies with stretches of stormy commotion.
Light and shadow play over this melancholy work; pen
siveness alternates with gloom, and Janacek's alpine
weather is cloudy at the end.
The Chopin scherzo was solidly furious. Even the slow
interlude offered little reprieve from the passion: its tune
was played assertively, out of keeping with the "sotto
iyoce" marking. At the scherzo's end, Moravec achieved
that resolute, bitter, teeming anger with which Chopin
sometimes closed his nocturnes, ballades and scherzos.
As encores Moravec performed the Chopin mazurka,
Opus 17, No. 4, and the Brahms capriccio, Opus 76, No.
2. The latter was prickly, atwitter — one of the evening's
rare instances of outright cheerfulness.
Moravec's recital was a draining experience that never
let up, either in its technical or its dramatic demands. By
the time the "Appassionata" was over I felt as if an in
visible hand were gripping my throat. Does Moravec
even unwind with, say, a nice little waltz by Glazunov? I
hope so. It would come as a well-deserved rest for this
diligent, masterful musician.
The Bay Area has lately been moving through a pian
istic meteor-shower; good classical pianists have rained

Moravec's feet work almost as hard as his hands. He
uses the soft pedal in generous helpings, and his right foot
works with such energy and precision on the damper
pedal, that it is apt to fly a full three inches off the pedal
when briskly releasing. Also, in Debussy's "La
Cathedrale engloutie," Moravec's special variation on
legato pedalling stood in high relief. In moving from
chord to chord, he sometimes releases the pedal not si
multaneously with the striking of the new chord, but a
moment after, so that the new chord overlaps the old one
for a split second. This worked well for Debussy, but was
inappropriate at times in Chopin.
Moravec has a strong rhythmic sense. He is not afraid
that a strict tempo will seem dull, and he's equally un
afriad that a big ritardando will seem to drag. He showed
that Debussy can thrive upon a regular pulse just as much
as Beethoven can. In Chopin, his rhythms have a tensile
. strength, like a tightly-coiled spring. His rubato (Italian
for "robbed") does riot dawdle, but is as deft as any pick
pocket.
Above all, Moravec has the ability to communicate
agitated feelings while yet playing smoothly — without
lurching from soft to loud. He achieves tension by sharp
contrasts between passages rather than by turbid playing
within passages. At the end of the Chopin scherzo, the
eight-measure octave run — though Moravec played it
with only slight accents and crescendo — had the swift,
even impetus of an arrow heading for its mark.
In particular in Debussy, Moravec showed that he had
taken to heart the composer's frequent instruction to play
"sane nuances" or "presque sans nuances." In music that
, might sometimes seem to contain nothing but nuance,

Moravec showed the benefits to be gained from playing
sometimes with unshaded dynamics and steady rhythm;
he showed the expressive possibilities to be found in inex
pressiveness. "La Cathedrale engloutie" became "pro
fondement calme" in the deepest sense, because Moravec
measured its vaults in stately, hymn-like strides.
On the other hand, it was surprising how much rubato
filled swooning went on in "Soiree dans Grenade," in the
loud passage marked "tres rythme." The same was true in
the major-key appearance of the theme in the first move
ment of the "Appassionata." Confoundingly, Beethoven
says that this tune should be played "softly, tranquilly,
with much expression but without affectation." Thus of
fered a choice of two directions in which to err, Moravec
chose to be overly soulful. This was surprising in a rendi
tion of the sonata that was otherwise incisive and brisk.
Lastly, to touch on a couple of points I've missed:
Janacek's "In the Mist" turned out to be not at all foggy.
In four short movements, the work contrasts simple,
haunting melodies with stretches of stormy commotion.
Light and shadow play over this melancholy work; pen
siveness alternates with gloom, and Janacek's alpine
weather is cloudy at the end.
The Chopin scherzo was solidly furious. Even the slow
interlude offered little reprieve from the passion: its tune
was played assertively, out of keeping with the "sotto
iyoce" marking. At the scherzo's end, Moravec achieved
that resolute, bitter, teeming anger with which Chopin
sometimes closed his nocturnes, ballades and scherzos.
As encores Moravec performed the Chopin mazurka,
Opus 17, No. 4, and the Brahms capriccio, Opus 76, No.
2. The latter was prickly, atwitter — one of the evening's
rare instances of outright cheerfulness.
Moravec's recital was a draining experience that never
let up, either in its technical or its dramatic demands. By
the time the "Appassionata" was over I felt as if an in
visible hand were gripping my throat. Does Moravec
even unwind with, say, a nice little waltz by Glazunov? I
hope so. It would come as a well-deserved rest for this
diligent, masterful musician.
The Bay Area has lately been moving through a pian
istic meteor-shower; good classical pianists have rained
down upon us thick and fast. The most recent shooting
star to hit town was Ivan Moravec, who gave a recital at
the Masonic Auditorium in San Francisco on Saturday
night.
Before the recital I knew nothing about Moravec, but I
remedied this by forming some preconceptions about
him, based on his announced program. When I see
Beethoven's "Appassionata" sonata on the same bill
with reams of Debussy, with nocturnes and the B-minor
scherzo by Chopin, and with something by Janacek
called "In the Mist" — then I say to myself "Here comes
one of those pianists who likes to play lots of notes, very
loudly." I assume that the Beethoven sonata will be
played first, as a sort of mandatory bow to the classical
era before getting on to "more important things," and
that it was chosen more for its romantic tempestuousness
than its classical proportions. I assume, too, that it will
drown in the same acoustical blur that Debussy tends to
induce — not to mention heaven-knows-what foggy
sonorities may belong to something called "In the Mist."
All this, coupled with Chopin's nocturnes, sounded to me
like a lot of heavy pedalling, heavy breathing and at
mospherics.
It was not to be. Ivan Moravec is no dreamer with his
head in the clouds; he is a meticulous craftsman, with feet
planted firmly on the earth, who treats a single note with
the loving care and scrupulous exactness that one things
of as necessary to Haydn or Mazart. His performance
could hardly be labelled facile, decorative, or noisy; rath
er, it showed him grappling with deep feelings. He
searched these pieces for their stark dramatic power, not
for their flashy effects. Indeed, though there was much
sensitivity in his performance, there was little that could
be called tranquil or happy. He was immersed in a world
that was turbulent and gripping.
Even the Chopin nocturnes, which so often are played
for their moods, their loveliness, were played by Moravec
as brief tragic dramas — as struggles played out through
the clash of quiet and stormy passages, and in the con

frontation between major and minor keys. Even in the
selection <}112 the four nocturnes, Moravec revealed himself
to be particularly conscientious with regard to key rela
tionships. Each successive nocturne was in the key of the
dominant of the preceding nocturne.
For example, Moravec began with Opus 32, No. 1 in B
major, and followed it with Opus 15, No. 2 in F-sharp
major. He then "modulated" to the two nocturnes, Opus
27, which share the same key (C-sharp and D-flat), but in
its major and minor modes. Thus, the architecture of key
changes between these pieces created an underlying sense
of instability and irresolution, further heightening the
dramatic tension.
If anything, Moravec's program was so full of dramat
ic tension that, by the end, it was too much to absorb. He
played for a solid two hours — no mean feat with this
kind of music — and toward the end he was mopping his
brow. Contrary to my expectations, the program ended
with the "Appassionata" sonata — an indication that
Morovec viewed it with full seriousness, not as a mere
nod to the classical style. But, unfortunately, the restless
key-changes of Beethoven's opening movement tend to
lose their impact if you have just finished playing
Chopin's B-minor scherzo. Chopin's piece is so passion
ately restless that anything coming after it called "Ap
passionata" can't help but seem too much of a good
thing. Taken together, these two pieces are about as fran
tic as you can get at the piano, short of banging your head
on the keys and chewing on the fallboard.
The stress of Moravec's performing was mirrored in
his face. He is, on the whole, a plain-looking man — bald,
a bit jowly — who takes his bows in a neat, clipped fash
ion, moving with the deftness of a conductor's baton. But
when Moravec starts to play, his face springs into action:
his eyes blink, his brow twitches, his mouth purses and
unpurses. At the end of Debussy's "Feux d'artifice"
("Fireworks"), right before he set off the final pianist'r
skyrocket — a two-handed flissando that shoots through
five octaves — Moravec gasped for breath with such
force that he looked like a firefighter in need of an oxygen
mask.
As far as technique is concerned, Moravec is striking in

several respects. His fingers are strong; he can ripple off,
with clarity and definition, the long skein of 32nd-notes
that concludes Debussy's "Pagodes" and the shimmering
64th-notes in "Feux d'artifice." The "Presto con fuoco"
of Chopin's scherzo was astonishingly fast and agile,
though played more for its overall surge than for its indi
vidual sparks. In Debussy's "Jardins sous la plui"
("Gardens in the rain") all the water-beads were strung
evenly, right in place.
Moravec's feet work almost as hard as his hands. He
uses the soft pedal in generous helpings, and his right foot
works with such energy and precision on the damper
pedal, that it is apt to fly a full three inches off the pedal
when briskly releasing. Also, in Debussy's "La
Cathedrale engloutie," Moravec's special variation on

All this, coupled with Chopin's nocturnes, sounded to me
like a lot of heavy pedalling, heavy breathing and at
mospherics.
It was not to be. Ivan Moravec is no dreamer with his
head in the clouds; he is a meticulous craftsman, with feet
planted firmly on the earth, who treats a single note with
the loving care and scrupulous exactness that one things
of as necessary to Haydn or Mazart. His performance
could hardly be labelled facile, decorative, or noisy; rath
er, it showed him grappling with deep feelings. He
searched these pieces for their stark dramatic power, not
for their flashy effects. Indeed, though there was much
sensitivity in his performance, there was little that could
be called tranquil or happy. He was immersed in a world
that was turbulent and gripping.
Even the Chopin nocturnes, which so often are played
for their moods, their loveliness, were played by Moravec
as brief tragic dramas — as struggles played out through
the clash of quiet and stormy passages, and in the con

frontation between major and minor keys. Even in the
selection <}112 the four nocturnes, Moravec revealed himself
to be particularly conscientious with regard to key rela
tionships. Each successive nocturne was in the key of the
dominant of the preceding nocturne.
For example, Moravec began with Opus 32, No. 1 in B
major, and followed it with Opus 15, No. 2 in F-sharp
major. He then "modulated" to the two nocturnes, Opus
27, which share the same key (C-sharp and D-flat), but in
its major and minor modes. Thus, the architecture of key
changes between these pieces created an underlying sense
of instability and irresolution, further heightening the
dramatic tension.
If anything, Moravec's program was so full of dramat
ic tension that, by the end, it was too much to absorb. He
played for a solid two hours — no mean feat with this
kind of music — and toward the end he was mopping his
brow. Contrary to my expectations, the program ended
with the "Appassionata" sonata — an indication that
Morovec viewed it with full seriousness, not as a mere
nod to the classical style. But, unfortunately, the restless
key-changes of Beethoven's opening movement tend to
lose their impact if you have just finished playing
Chopin's B-minor scherzo. Chopin's piece is so passion
ately restless that anything coming after it called "Ap
passionata" can't help but seem too much of a good
thing. Taken together, these two pieces are about as fran
tic as you can get at the piano, short of banging your head
on the keys and chewing on the fallboard.
The stress of Moravec's performing was mirrored in
his face. He is, on the whole, a plain-looking man — bald,
a bit jowly — who takes his bows in a neat, clipped fash
ion, moving with the deftness of a conductor's baton. But
when Moravec starts to play, his face springs into action:
his eyes blink, his brow twitches, his mouth purses and
unpurses. At the end of Debussy's "Feux d'artifice"
("Fireworks"), right before he set off the final pianist'r
skyrocket — a two-handed flissando that shoots through
five octaves — Moravec gasped for breath with such
force that he looked like a firefighter in need of an oxygen
mask.
As far as technique is concerned, Moravec is striking in

several respects. His fingers are strong; he can ripple off,
with clarity and definition, the long skein of 32nd-notes
that concludes Debussy's "Pagodes" and the shimmering
64th-notes in "Feux d'artifice." The "Presto con fuoco"
of Chopin's scherzo was astonishingly fast and agile,
though played more for its overall surge than for its indi
vidual sparks. In Debussy's "Jardins sous la plui"
("Gardens in the rain") all the water-beads were strung
evenly, right in place.
Moravec's feet work almost as hard as his hands. He
uses the soft pedal in generous helpings, and his right foot
works with such energy and precision on the damper
pedal, that it is apt to fly a full three inches off the pedal
when briskly releasing. Also, in Debussy's "La
Cathedrale engloutie," Moravec's special variation on
legato pedalling stood in high relief. In moving from
chord to chord, he sometimes releases the pedal not si
multaneously with the striking of the new chord, but a
moment after, so that the new chord overlaps the old one
for a split second. This worked well for Debussy, but was
inappropriate at times in Chopin.
Moravec has a strong rhythmic sense. He is not afraid
that a strict tempo will seem dull, and he's equally un
afriad that a big ritardando will seem to drag. He showed
that Debussy can thrive upon a regular pulse just as much
as Beethoven can. In Chopin, his rhythms have a tensile
. strength, like a tightly-coiled spring. His rubato (Italian
for "robbed") does riot dawdle, but is as deft as any pick
pocket.
Above all, Moravec has the ability to communicate
agitated feelings while yet playing smoothly — without
lurching from soft to loud. He achieves tension by sharp
contrasts between passages rather than by turbid playing
within passages. At the end of the Chopin scherzo, the
eight-measure octave run — though Moravec played it
with only slight accents and crescendo — had the swift,
even impetus of an arrow heading for its mark.
In particular in Debussy, Moravec showed that he had
taken to heart the composer's frequent instruction to play
"sane nuances" or "presque sans nuances." In music that
, might sometimes seem to contain nothing but nuance,

Moravec showed the benefits to be gained from playing
sometimes with unshaded dynamics and steady rhythm;
he showed the expressive possibilities to be found in inex
pressiveness. "La Cathedrale engloutie" became "pro
fondement calme" in the deepest sense, because Moravec
measured its vaults in stately, hymn-like strides.
On the other hand, it was surprising how much rubato
filled swooning went on in "Soiree dans Grenade," in the
loud passage marked "tres rythme." The same was true in
the major-key appearance of the theme in the first move
ment of the "Appassionata." Confoundingly, Beethoven
says that this tune should be played "softly, tranquilly,
with much expression but without affectation." Thus of
fered a choice of two directions in which to err, Moravec
chose to be overly soulful. This was surprising in a rendi
tion of the sonata that was otherwise incisive and brisk.
Lastly, to touch on a couple of points I've missed:
Janacek's "In the Mist" turned out to be not at all foggy.
In four short movements, the work contrasts simple,
haunting melodies with stretches of stormy commotion.
Light and shadow play over this melancholy work; pen
siveness alternates with gloom, and Janacek's alpine
weather is cloudy at the end.
The Chopin scherzo was solidly furious. Even the slow
interlude offered little reprieve from the passion: its tune
was played assertively, out of keeping with the "sotto
iyoce" marking. At the scherzo's end, Moravec achieved
that resolute, bitter, teeming anger with which Chopin
sometimes closed his nocturnes, ballades and scherzos.
As encores Moravec performed the Chopin mazurka,
Opus 17, No. 4, and the Brahms capriccio, Opus 76, No.
2. The latter was prickly, atwitter — one of the evening's
rare instances of outright cheerfulness.
Moravec's recital was a draining experience that never
let up, either in its technical or its dramatic demands. By
the time the "Appassionata" was over I felt as if an in
visible hand were gripping my throat. Does Moravec
even unwind with, say, a nice little waltz by Glazunov? I
hope so. It would come as a well-deserved rest for this
diligent, masterful musician.
The Bay Area has lately been moving through a pian
istic meteor-shower; good classical pianists have rained
down upon us thick and fast. The most recent shooting
star to hit town was Ivan Moravec, who gave a recital at
the Masonic Auditorium in San Francisco on Saturday
night.
Before the recital I knew nothing about Moravec, but I
remedied this by forming some preconceptions about
him, based on his announced program. When I see
Beethoven's "Appassionata" sonata on the same bill
with reams of Debussy, with nocturnes and the B-minor
scherzo by Chopin, and with something by Janacek
called "In the Mist" — then I say to myself "Here comes
one of those pianists who likes to play lots of notes, very
loudly." I assume that the Beethoven sonata will be
played first, as a sort of mandatory bow to the classical
era before getting on to "more important things," and
that it was chosen more for its romantic tempestuousness
than its classical proportions. I assume, too, that it will
drown in the same acoustical blur that Debussy tends to
induce — not to mention heaven-knows-what foggy
sonorities may belong to something called "In the Mist."
All this, coupled with Chopin's nocturnes, sounded to me
like a lot of heavy pedalling, heavy breathing and at
mospherics.
