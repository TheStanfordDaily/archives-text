# Gaieties 1982: the wait is over
## 
### TONY KELLY 
Watching Waiting for Big
Came, Ram's Head's latest in
carnation of Big Game Gaieties,
you can't help but notice how
much of an icon the traditional
extravaganza has become. Even
during the longer stretches of
dialogue, for example, all the
main characters faced the au
dience and not each other — a de
vice usually reserved for things
like Gilbert and Sullivan operet
tas.
The implication of this kind of
staging, and of the entire show, is
that Gaieties is not exactly a play,
but a performance or series of
performances. This difference
was especially noticeable in Wait
ing For Big Game, with its fre
quent and clearly stated breaks
between plot elements and musi
cal numbers. Gaieties is not a
haven for subtle staging; its free
wheeling style and exuberance
are its selling points, and the
main factors in its role as a pre-
Big Game rally.
And it's that same recognition
o! its own role that made Waiting
for Big Game a successful rally,
and perhaps more important,
the most entertaining edition of
Gaieties in recent years. Wherein
some previous attempts Ram's
Head has tended to forge uneasy
alliances between plot and enter
tainment in itsshows, Waiting for
Big Game has emerged in a state
of peaceful coexistence — a form
of dramatic detente. What results
is no Vcss .vruVic'uvl, hut certainly
less stagey, which leads to a purer
enjoyment of Gaieties as an en
tertainment that is supposed to
last after the final cannon shot off
Tightwad Hill.
I he driving force behind this
year's (iaieties is its script, which
is certainly the funniest I've
heard and the one least con

cerned with propelling a storyline
(a wise choice, given the Ram's
Head productions of student
written plays over the last three
years). Indeed, the opening se
quence of Waiting for Big Game
is a series of abortive outlines for
Gaieties, devised by a fictional
(and borderline stereotypical)
group of writers. If these folks are
supposed to be roman a clef
caricatures, then the real writers
should be put under glass and
donated to science. Nonetheless,
the device inspires some good
moments of parody, and the little

The parodic approach
to Gaieties in the
opening scene is a fail
safe way to begin
Gaieties 1982. With
absolutely no
storytelling baggage
to carry, the audience
gets a few laughs and
settles down before
the real show begins.

we hear from the writers is ap
propriately off-the-wall. And I'll
bet the threat of "Wait till the
Men's Center hears about this!"
will hang around for more than a
few quarters around campus.
Moreover, the parodic ap
proach to Gaieties in the opening
scenes is almost a fail-safe way to
begin Gaieties 1982. With
absolutely no storytelling bag
gage to carry, the audience gets a
few laughs and settles down
before the real show begins, by
which time the sketches start to
show some signs of strain any

wav.
It's in the final suggested story
(suggested by a neophyte writer
played amiably by Nick Rowen)
that Waiting for Big Game finally
gets underway, but even then the
thinly disguised artistic devices
keep coming thick and fast.
There's a certain randomness to
the writing; it seemed like there
were a lot of moments that said
"OK, now let's dance" or "Sing,
pledges." But this division, inten
tional or not, kept the show light,
if not quite on balance.
This same element is true of the
best sequences in the show. "Do
You Have What It Takes?," de
tailing initiation at the I Phelta
Thi fraternity (the name is one of
the few really insipid jokes in the
script) and a scene about "Meyer
Girls" (using the music of guess
who), both are expected potshots
at pretty easy targets. Yet the
very vaudevillian nature of
Gaieties dictates that such sub
jects can't be left alone. Conse
quently, the saving grace of this
year's Frat and Sorority Rags is
that not once do you see the
slightest hint of malice or ig
norance. The two scenes were not
exactly deft in their satires, but
the (one hopes) deliberate artifice
of the numbers was more than
enough to keep the entertain
ment harmless and still not of
fensively innocuous.
Director Eric Abrams keeps
things moving at a fairly rapid
clip, keeping the opportunities
for onstage mugging to a min
imum (an admirable feat, con
sidering the circumstances) and
not letting the event or the story
get in the way of the humor. I
hope that it was his intention to
have the actors face the audience
instead of each other; if not, he
may have stumbled onto a way
around the common pitfall of ov
eracting in Gaieties. Abrams also
succeeds in the absence of specta
cle in Waiting for Big Game; the
scene changes are quick and
simple, and he makes sure not to
get in the way of the terrific script
(unlike last spring's Ram's Head
production of Cabaret).
I wish I could say the same
about the choreography, the one

weak point in the show. The
dancing was just fine, a little off
rhvthm in spots but certainly in
dicative of talent. But the ersatz
Bob Fosse choreography (by
Susan Jean KeefeandCindi Flip
po) not only seemed a little too
similar to Cabaret, it just doesn't
match up to the lack of pretense
of the rest of the show. Simulated
sex plav may (or may not) work
onstage when you're represent
ing a '30s Germany red-light dis
trict, but trying to throw it into a
scene of midnight at the Quad is
definitely fitting a square peg into
a round hole.
At any rate, the show re
covered immediately afterward
with its finale, featuring a sur
prise appearance by University
President Donald Kennedy after
the expected "surprise" ap
pearance of Dean of Admissions
Fred Hargadon. Whether Don
upstaged Fred is open to ques
tion; the former certainly needs a
bit of coaching on his acting. But
his presence served to add a little
spontaneity and fun to another
traditional part of Big Game
Gaieties; and that added humor
kept the show fresh for another
year, breathing a good dose of
life into the old icon of a show.

Watching Waiting for Big
Came, Ram's Head's latest in
carnation of Big Game Gaieties,
you can't help but notice how
much of an icon the traditional
extravaganza has become. Even
during the longer stretches of
dialogue, for example, all the
main characters faced the au
dience and not each other — a de
vice usually reserved for things
like Gilbert and Sullivan operet
tas.
The implication of this kind of
staging, and of the entire show, is
that Gaieties is not exactly a play,
but a performance or series of
performances. This difference
was especially noticeable in Wait
ing For Big Game, with its fre
quent and clearly stated breaks
between plot elements and musi
cal numbers. Gaieties is not a
haven for subtle staging; its free
wheeling style and exuberance
are its selling points, and the
main factors in its role as a pre-
Big Game rally.
And it's that same recognition
o! its own role that made Waiting
for Big Game a successful rally,
and perhaps more important,
the most entertaining edition of
Gaieties in recent years. Wherein
some previous attempts Ram's
Head has tended to forge uneasy
alliances between plot and enter
tainment in itsshows, Waiting for
Big Game has emerged in a state
of peaceful coexistence — a form
of dramatic detente. What results
is no Vcss .vruVic'uvl, hut certainly
less stagey, which leads to a purer
enjoyment of Gaieties as an en
tertainment that is supposed to
last after the final cannon shot off
Tightwad Hill.
I he driving force behind this
year's (iaieties is its script, which
is certainly the funniest I've
heard and the one least con

cerned with propelling a storyline
(a wise choice, given the Ram's
Head productions of student
written plays over the last three
years). Indeed, the opening se
quence of Waiting for Big Game
is a series of abortive outlines for
Gaieties, devised by a fictional
(and borderline stereotypical)
group of writers. If these folks are
supposed to be roman a clef
caricatures, then the real writers
should be put under glass and
donated to science. Nonetheless,
the device inspires some good
moments of parody, and the little

The parodic approach

propriately off-the-wall. And I'll

will hang around for more than a
few quarters around campus.

proach to Gaieties in the opening
scenes is almost a fail-safe way to

which time the sketches start to

It's in the final suggested story
(suggested by a neophyte writer
played amiably by Nick Rowen)
that Waiting for Big Game finally
gets underway, but even then the
thinly disguised artistic devices
keep coming thick and fast.
There's a certain randomness to
the writing; it seemed like there
were a lot of moments that said
"OK, now let's dance" or "Sing,
pledges." But this division, inten
tional or not, kept the show light,
if not quite on balance.
This same element is true of the
best sequences in the show. "Do
You Have What It Takes?," de
tailing initiation at the I Phelta
Thi fraternity (the name is one of
the few really insipid jokes in the
script) and a scene about "Meyer
Girls" (using the music of guess
who), both are expected potshots
at pretty easy targets. Yet the
very vaudevillian nature of
Gaieties dictates that such sub
jects can't be left alone. Conse
quently, the saving grace of this
year's Frat and Sorority Rags is
that not once do you see the
slightest hint of malice or ig
norance. The two scenes were not
exactly deft in their satires, but
the (one hopes) deliberate artifice
of the numbers was more than
enough to keep the entertain
ment harmless and still not of
fensively innocuous.
Director Eric Abrams keeps
things moving at a fairly rapid
clip, keeping the opportunities
for onstage mugging to a min
imum (an admirable feat, con
sidering the circumstances) and
not letting the event or the story
get in the way of the humor. I
hope that it was his intention to
have the actors face the audience
instead of each other; if not, he
may have stumbled onto a way
around the common pitfall of ov
eracting in Gaieties. Abrams also
succeeds in the absence of specta
cle in Waiting for Big Game; the
scene changes are quick and
simple, and he makes sure not to
get in the way of the terrific script
(unlike last spring's Ram's Head
production of Cabaret).
