# Matt Dillon: a born movie star in an adolescent movie
## 'Tex' 
### STEVE VINEBERG 
Due to a felicitous combina
tion — an extraordinarily tal
ented generation and a raft of
good roles — many of the most
impressive performances in mov
ies over the past couple of years
have been given by actors in their
late teens and early 20s: Jodie
Foster, Kristy McNichol, Mariel
Hemingway, Dana Hill (in Shoot
the Moon), Tim Hutton, Michael
O'Keefe, Sean Penn, Richard
Romanus (both in Fast Times at
Ridgemont High) and Matt
Dillon. Dillon may not be the
most prodigious of that group
but more than any of the others
he's a born movie star: I suspect
his unhurried style would seem a
little slow on a stage, but it's per
fectly timed for the screen; at 18,
he is already such a commanding
presence — a James Dean,
though far more relaxed and with
a completely different range —
that few seasoned actors would
stand a chance of stealing a scene
from him. Fortunately, modesty
is part of Dillon's charm. In the
1980 Little Darlings, he had an
important supporting role as the
townie who rid Kristy McNichol
of her virginity, and in the memo
rable post-coital scene he man
aged to reveal a confusion of
emotions without undermining
McNichol, whose character was
intended to draw the focus of the
dramatic situation. (These two
performances gave audiences a
reason to watch an otherwise
paltry film.) He's almost never
off the screen in Tex, his fourth
movie, in which he plays a 15-
vear-old struggling to deal with a
load of emotional problems (a
dead mother, an absent father,
incipient sexual feelings, a mix
ture of love and resentment
toward an older brother who has
been cast in the role of surrogate
parent), but though the material
has a firm basis in adolescent
soap opera, he doesn't sentimen
talize a single moment. He man
ages to depict a complex charac
ter bv the simplest and most eco
nomical means. When you try to
remember afterwards how he
dealt with Tex's injured response
when a classmate insults his
father, or with the scene in which
Tex, having disarmed a paranoid
druggie who has wounded him,
comes close to shooting his as
sailant — a horrifying moment
that shows us the potential for vi
olence in a sweet-natured, gener
ous kid — you may become frus
trated, because Dillon doesn't
have a bag of tricks, like most ac
tors do. What he has is instinct.
Dillon may not even think about
how he's going to play these
scenes beforehand, but he's as
unswervingly authentic as if he
had written Tex himself.
Tex, the first of three new mov
ies based on S.E. Hinton's popu
lar teenage fiction (the others,

The Outsiders and Rumble Fish,
will both be directed by Francis
Ford Coppola and Dillon will
star in both), is a pleasing vehicle
for Dillon. Both Tim Hunter, the
director, and Charlie Haas, who
collaborated with him on the
script, have a feeling for the easy
rapport teenagers have with each
other, for the differences in the
ways they relate to other kids and
to adults, and — along with the
photographer, Ric Waite — for
the intimacy of small south
western towns. (Tex takes place
outside Tulsa, Oklahoma.)
Hunter obviously likes actors
and knows what to do with them:
Jim Metzler, impenetrable in last
year's Four Friends as the young
man who brings a wife back from
Vietnam, gives a very intelligent

performance as Tex's brother
Mason, and Meg Tilly, as Tex's
girl, Jamie, has a few lovely, un
affected scenes with Dillon.
Jamie is darkly beautiful, and her
sexuality seems almost un
conscious, as it is in many 14- and
15-vear-olds; she's also witty and
grounded in common sense.
When she tells Tex she's confused
about her feelings for him, and
seconds later laughs with worldly
cynicism at the improbability of a
marriage between them lasting
longer than a year, you can be
lieve both the childish and
grown-up parts of this girl.
Tex and Mason's dad is a
rodeo cowboy, on the road for
four or five months at a time,
who has polarized the two boys
to a large extent. Tex is still
young enough to idolize him, but
Mason, who has been forced to
take on his responsibilities, has
so much resultant anger and frus
tration that he has developed an
ulcer. The casting of Bill McKin
ney, who has been seen mostly in
Clint Eastwood pictures (and as
the sodomizing hillbilly in De
liverance), in the role of the rest
less father is practically a stroke
of genius. Red-haired and soft
eved, McKinney looks un
mistakably Irish, and so when he
appears we identify him with the
tradition of amiable Irish ne'er
do-wells in movies and fiction

(like Johnny Nolan in A Tree
Grows in Brooklyn); furthermore,
he is good-looking and slick
enough to justify Tex's feelings
for him and drab and second-rate
enough to allow us to appreciate
the way the rest of the world sees
him. Pop McCormick is really a
cliche — the lousy father who
shows up once in a blue moon to
glad-hand his sons, the man who,
never having grown up himself,
takes a juvenile delight in his
kid's prankishness — but
McKinney, with Hunter's help,
transcends it by suggesting that
McCormick is deeply flawed but
decent.
' On the whole, however,
though Tex is virtually bereft of
villains, it could not be called a
transcendent movie. Haas and
Hunter bring conviction to S.E.
Hinton's material, but convic
tion within limits; Tex may grap
ple with his virginity, and there
may be a drug dealer among the
characters (Mason's friend Lem,
played by Phil Brook), but the re
alism isn't quite gritty enough —
you're conscious that this is a
Walt Disney production. Few
teenagers I've met use such re
strained language, and though
it's not overt, one can detect a
moralizing tone in several of the
scenes (especially the ones involv
ing Lem) that was clearly over
laid by an adult. (Fast Times at
Ridgemont High, a less ambitious
movie, has a less judgmental ap
proach to its adolescent charac
ters.) The problem with Tex isn't
its few disastrous episodes — like
one involving a hitchhiking es
caped con, played bv Zeljko
Ivanek with an actorish intensity
completely off base in a movie
like this — or the derivative na
ture of much of the plot (there are
steals from Rebel Without a
Cause, F. Scott Fitzgerald's
"Babylon Revisited" and oth
ers), but that in striving to repro
duce adolescent experience with
authenticity, it doesn't go far
enough. Hunter's work with his
actors is commendable, and he
has the sensitivity to keep the pic
ture low-key and on the far side
of melodrama, but if Tex were
braver — more disturbing — it
would break new ground for
more than just the Disney Studi
os.

scenes beforehand, but he's as
unswervingly authentic as if he
had written Tex himself.
Tex, the first of three new mov
ies based on S.E. Hinton's popu
lar teenage fiction (the others,

The Outsiders and Rumble Fish,
will both be directed by Francis
Ford Coppola and Dillon will
star in both), is a pleasing vehicle
for Dillon. Both Tim Hunter, the
director, and Charlie Haas, who
collaborated with him on the
script, have a feeling for the easy
rapport teenagers have with each
other, for the differences in the
ways they relate to other kids and
to adults, and — along with the
photographer, Ric Waite — for
the intimacy of small south
western towns. (Tex takes place
outside Tulsa, Oklahoma.)
Hunter obviously likes actors
and knows what to do with them:
Jim Metzler, impenetrable in last
year's Four Friends as the young
man who brings a wife back from
Vietnam, gives a very intelligent

performance as Tex's brother
Mason, and Meg Tilly, as Tex's
girl, Jamie, has a few lovely, un
affected scenes with Dillon.
Jamie is darkly beautiful, and her
sexuality seems almost un
conscious, as it is in many 14- and
15-vear-olds; she's also witty and
grounded in common sense.
When she tells Tex she's confused
about her feelings for him, and
seconds later laughs with worldly
cynicism at the improbability of a
marriage between them lasting
longer than a year, you can be
lieve both the childish and
grown-up parts of this girl.
Tex and Mason's dad is a
rodeo cowboy, on the road for
four or five months at a time,
who has polarized the two boys
to a large extent. Tex is still
young enough to idolize him, but
Mason, who has been forced to
take on his responsibilities, has
so much resultant anger and frus
tration that he has developed an
ulcer. The casting of Bill McKin
ney, who has been seen mostly in
Clint Eastwood pictures (and as
the sodomizing hillbilly in De
liverance), in the role of the rest
less father is practically a stroke
of genius. Red-haired and soft
eved, McKinney looks un
mistakably Irish, and so when he
appears we identify him with the
tradition of amiable Irish ne'er
do-wells in movies and fiction

(like Johnny Nolan in A Tree
Grows in Brooklyn); furthermore,
he is good-looking and slick
enough to justify Tex's feelings
for him and drab and second-rate
enough to allow us to appreciate
the way the rest of the world sees
him. Pop McCormick is really a
cliche — the lousy father who
shows up once in a blue moon to
glad-hand his sons, the man who,
never having grown up himself,
takes a juvenile delight in his
kid's prankishness — but
McKinney, with Hunter's help,
transcends it by suggesting that
McCormick is deeply flawed but
decent.
' On the whole, however,
though Tex is virtually bereft of
villains, it could not be called a
transcendent movie. Haas and
Hunter bring conviction to S.E.
Hinton's material, but convic
tion within limits; Tex may grap
ple with his virginity, and there
may be a drug dealer among the
characters (Mason's friend Lem,
played by Phil Brook), but the re
alism isn't quite gritty enough —
you're conscious that this is a
Walt Disney production. Few
teenagers I've met use such re
strained language, and though
it's not overt, one can detect a
moralizing tone in several of the
scenes (especially the ones involv
ing Lem) that was clearly over
laid by an adult. (Fast Times at
Ridgemont High, a less ambitious
movie, has a less judgmental ap
proach to its adolescent charac
ters.) The problem with Tex isn't
its few disastrous episodes — like
one involving a hitchhiking es
caped con, played bv Zeljko
Ivanek with an actorish intensity
completely off base in a movie
like this — or the derivative na
ture of much of the plot (there are
steals from Rebel Without a
Cause, F. Scott Fitzgerald's
"Babylon Revisited" and oth
ers), but that in striving to repro
duce adolescent experience with
authenticity, it doesn't go far
enough. Hunter's work with his
actors is commendable, and he
has the sensitivity to keep the pic
ture low-key and on the far side
of melodrama, but if Tex were
braver — more disturbing — it
would break new ground for
more than just the Disney Studi
os.

Due to a felicitous combina
tion — an extraordinarily tal
ented generation and a raft of
good roles — many of the most
impressive performances in mov
ies over the past couple of years
have been given by actors in their
late teens and early 20s: Jodie
Foster, Kristy McNichol, Mariel
Hemingway, Dana Hill (in Shoot
the Moon), Tim Hutton, Michael
O'Keefe, Sean Penn, Richard
Romanus (both in Fast Times at
Ridgemont High) and Matt
Dillon. Dillon may not be the
most prodigious of that group
but more than any of the others
he's a born movie star: I suspect
his unhurried style would seem a
little slow on a stage, but it's per
fectly timed for the screen; at 18,
he is already such a commanding
presence — a James Dean,
though far more relaxed and with
a completely different range —
that few seasoned actors would
stand a chance of stealing a scene
from him. Fortunately, modesty
is part of Dillon's charm. In the
1980 Little Darlings, he had an
important supporting role as the
townie who rid Kristy McNichol
of her virginity, and in the memo
rable post-coital scene he man
aged to reveal a confusion of
emotions without undermining
McNichol, whose character was
intended to draw the focus of the
dramatic situation. (These two
performances gave audiences a
reason to watch an otherwise
paltry film.) He's almost never
off the screen in Tex, his fourth
movie, in which he plays a 15-
vear-old struggling to deal with a
load of emotional problems (a
dead mother, an absent father,
incipient sexual feelings, a mix
ture of love and resentment
toward an older brother who has
been cast in the role of surrogate
parent), but though the material
has a firm basis in adolescent
soap opera, he doesn't sentimen
talize a single moment. He man
ages to depict a complex charac
ter bv the simplest and most eco
nomical means. When you try to
remember afterwards how he
dealt with Tex's injured response
when a classmate insults his
father, or with the scene in which
Tex, having disarmed a paranoid
druggie who has wounded him,
comes close to shooting his as
sailant — a horrifying moment
that shows us the potential for vi
olence in a sweet-natured, gener
ous kid — you may become frus
trated, because Dillon doesn't
have a bag of tricks, like most ac
tors do. What he has is instinct.

shows up once in a blue moon to
glad-hand his sons, the man who,
never having grown up himself,
takes a juvenile delight in his
kid's prankishness — but
McKinney, with Hunter's help,
transcends it by suggesting that
McCormick is deeply flawed but
decent.
' On the whole, however,
though Tex is virtually bereft of
villains, it could not be called a
transcendent movie. Haas and
Hunter bring conviction to S.E.
Hinton's material, but convic
tion within limits; Tex may grap
ple with his virginity, and there
may be a drug dealer among the
characters (Mason's friend Lem,
played by Phil Brook), but the re
alism isn't quite gritty enough —
you're conscious that this is a
Walt Disney production. Few
teenagers I've met use such re
strained language, and though
it's not overt, one can detect a
moralizing tone in several of the
scenes (especially the ones involv
ing Lem) that was clearly over
laid by an adult. (Fast Times at
Ridgemont High, a less ambitious
movie, has a less judgmental ap
proach to its adolescent charac
ters.) The problem with Tex isn't
its few disastrous episodes — like
one involving a hitchhiking es
caped con, played bv Zeljko
Ivanek with an actorish intensity
completely off base in a movie
like this — or the derivative na
ture of much of the plot (there are
steals from Rebel Without a
Cause, F. Scott Fitzgerald's
"Babylon Revisited" and oth
ers), but that in striving to repro
duce adolescent experience with
authenticity, it doesn't go far
enough. Hunter's work with his
actors is commendable, and he
has the sensitivity to keep the pic
ture low-key and on the far side
of melodrama, but if Tex were
braver — more disturbing — it
would break new ground for
more than just the Disney Studi
os.
