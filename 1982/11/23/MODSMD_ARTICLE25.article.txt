# 'First Blood'
## 
### 
There's a distinct possibility
that if Sylvester Stallone ever
breaks away from the Rocky
series, he will turn into a real ac
tor. Under Ted Kotcheff s direc
tin, he gives a performance in
First Blood that is refreshingly
free, particularly in the early
scenes, of the ersatz Brandoish
ness that usually plagues his act
ing; his portrayal of John Ram
bo, a former Green Beret on the
edge of collapse, is rooted in re
ality. The script by Stallone,
Michael Kozoll and William

Sackheim (out of a novel by
David Marrell) winds Rambo up
tight in the first half hour, when
he learns that his last surviving
buddv has succumbed to cancer
as a result of exposure to Agent
Orange, and is then picked up in
a small town for vagrancv and
beaten by cops — and then lets
him explode for the rest of the
movie. But Stallone shows sur
prising restraint, and his final
breakdown monologue is a
touchinglv honest failure; it in
dicates that someday he mav be
able to carry off such treacherous
material. I've never before felt so
much confidence in Sylvester
Stallone.
First Blood is imitative of so
many other movies that even the
craftsmanship seems a cheat, be
cause Kotcheff and his gifted
photographer, Andrew Laszlo,
are essentially refinishing The
Most Dangerous Game and all the
small-town-bigoted-cop movies
that In the Heat of the Night
should have killed off for good
and all the Vietnam vet dramas of
the late '70s, and pretending that
their product is brand-new. This
picture glistens with misapplied
talent. Its most obvious and
closest source is Southern Com
fort, which Laszlo shot for
Walter Hill last year. In Hill's ter
rific but largely unnoticed film,
an ill-assorted collection of Na
tional Guardsmen trapped in the
Bayou are picked off bv Cajuns
as secure in their jungle territory
as Viet Cong; in First Blood,
Rambo escapes into the hills of
northern Oregon (or southern
Washington; I couldn't tell
which) and fends off dozens of
cops and National Guardsmen,
employing the strategies he
learned as a Green Beret. With
irony as his chief instrument, Hill
made both the comedy and the
terror work in Southern Comfort,
butwhen Kotchefl tries to r?work
them in a parallel narrative, we're
aware that his movie is just a
scam. Kotcheffs precise shaping
of the action sequences, however,
does distract you from the fairly
inept plotting: policemen you feel
sure Rambo has killed keep re
surfacing like comic characters
trounced by their enemies, and
the geography of the final
shootout defies logic. The sup
porting cast, headed by a flat,
pompous Riv>Ward Crenna
(whose make-up is so atrocious
that his face seems to be melting),
lacks distinction.
