# 'The Missionary' 'Brimstone and Treacle'
## 
### 
By a coincidence, two films by
the British director Richard Lon
craine, whose work has been
heretofore unseen in this coun
try, have opened here at the same
time: The Missionary and
Brimstone and Treacle. Neither
excited my curiositv about the
Loncraine pictures we haven't
ceived, although they both begin
with uncommonly clever credits
sequences — perhaps that will be
Loncraine's contribution to the
contemporary English cinema,
such as it is. Of the two, I much
prefer The Missionary, an odd
ball comedy-drama set in Lon
don in the earlv years of this cen
tury. Michael Palin (also the au
thor of the screenplay) plays
Charles Fortescue, a young min
ister recalled from Africa to open
a mission in the slums for reform

ing prostitutes. Though it wavers
uneasily between farce and in
trigue and finally gets swallowed
up by its own plot machinery, the
film features a quartet of wonder
ful actors in supporting roles —
Maggie Smith, Denholm Elliott,
Michael Hordem and Trevor
Howard — who save large quan
tities of it. Unfortunately, when
you watch Maggie Smith seduc
ing Michael Palin as though she
were playing Wycherley or Sher
idan, you wonder how Palin, a
very small-scale comedian, can
have the temerity to share a scene
with her. And Michael Hordern's
befuddlement when he waltzes a
roast into Fortescue's bedroom
by accident (he plays a butler
who has permanently lost his
bearings) is so subtle that it
makes Palin's familiar eye-pop
ping look embarrassingly
amateur.
Brimstone and Treacle, from
the pen yf Dennis Potter (Pennies
from Heaven), is a Gothic com
edy in the style of The Ruling
Class — it's the kind of film, in

short, that some of us had hoped
English filmmakers had lost in
terest in doing. Sting, of the rock
group The Police, plays a nasty
young man who gains access to
the home of Denholm Elliott
(again) and Joan Plowright by
posing as an old school chum of
their daughter; she was left para
lyzed and incommunicable by a
car accident some months ago.
Elliott acquits himself with re
markable aplomb, as usual (he
must be the most reliable charac
ter actor in England), but
Plowright reprises her per
formance as the religious mother
in Equus, and Sting, in a role tai
lored for the young Malcolm
McDowell, illustrates no talent
whatever. It's a particularly dis
maying film because of the quali
ty of Potter's script for Pennies
for Heaven: here Potter exposes
his characters with the same
satirical incisiveness, but the dif
ference is in his new lack of com
passion for them. The unpleasant
odor the movie gives off is the
souring of wit.
