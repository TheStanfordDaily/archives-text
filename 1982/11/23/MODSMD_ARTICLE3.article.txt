# Departments contemplating cuts to make up $3 million deficit
## 
### DAVID SANCHEZ Staff writer 
The University will know the nature and extent of pro
posed departmental budget cuts by March, when budget rec
ommendations are reported to the board of trustees, accord
ing to Wayne Price, associate provost for Management and
Budget.
The budgeting process is still in the forecasting stage, ac
cording to Price. And responses from various schools and
departments indicate that it is too early to make any predic
tions as to what specific cuts will be made.
In its plan to make up a projected $3 million operating
budget deficit, the University has asked the various deans
and directors to contemplate what measures they would take
in order to reduce their budgets by 5 percent over the next
two years.
According to Price, this budget reduction would be the se
verest departmental belt-tightening since the Budget
Equilibrium Program (BEP) and the Budget Adjustment

Program (BAP) of the early and mid-'7os. BEP and BAPcut
about 8 percent from the budget.
Provost Albert Hastorf explained that the current budget
cutting proposal is not as severe as the '70s programs. "I
think that one of the reasons this is going to hurt a little more
than it might normally is having been through those" past
budget reductions, he added.
Last year all University departments took a ! percent
budget cut. According to History Prof. James Sheehan, a I
percent cut is not very drastic. Most departments could easi
ly shave 1 to 2 percent off of their budgets, he said.
Tim Warner, assistant provost for Management and
Budget, said the budget cuts are anticipated to make up
about one-third of the projected budget deficit, although the
5 percent budget cut goal may change as estimates firm up.
The School of Humanaties and Sciences (H & S) should
have a pretty good idea of where the budget cuts will occur
bv the end of January, according to Dean Norman Wessells.
The budget-cut deliberations are an "amorphous and slip

pery process," Wessells said.
"We consult among ourselves, knowing the history of de
partments and extra-departmental programs, and all the rest
of the school ... seeking ideas about ways to go on the
budget — where one can possibly identify places where you
might be able to cut," he said.
Hastorf said the administration must set priorities. "What
we want to try and do is to make an estimate of where the
consequences are going to be so severe we just don't want to
(make cuts), and where, although they're going to hurt, they
are tolerable."
But the cuts will not be equally distributed. "That would
be easy. I could just write everybody a letter and say 'I am
multiplying .05 times your budget, and please make up a
budget for this,' " he said.
"I don't believe in that for a number of reasons. It forgets
the fact that some departments are increasing in popularity
with undergraduates and need faculty to satisfy that, while
others are decreasing," he said.

Hastorf said he looked at the overall budget cut as "slow
ing down the pace." "I don't look at us as tearing anything
asunder."
"There may be a sort of a law of institutional life," he con
tinued, "that, . . . after a period of balanced budget, sort of
inexorable forces lead to doing more things: starting up
Western Culture, building up human biology."
Kenneth Down, the School of Engineering's associate
dean for business affairs, and Alan Cummings, the associate
director of finance for the Athletic Department, both said
that it was too early to make any predictions about specific
budget cuts. However, Cummings said that "a 5 percent cut
back would definitely have an effect on the programs that we
(the Athletic Department) support."
The budget cuts, are part of what the University's pre
liminary financial report calls "permanent gap closers" be
cause they will have a permanent effect on the budget base
(the operating budget), according to Warner.

pery process," Wessells said.
"We consult among ourselves, knowing the history of de
partments and extra-departmental programs, and all the rest
of the school ... seeking ideas about ways to go on the
budget — where one can possibly identify places where you
might be able to cut," he said.
Hastorf said the administration must set priorities. "What
we want to try and do is to make an estimate of where the
consequences are going to be so severe we just don't want to
(make cuts), and where, although they're going to hurt, they
are tolerable."
But the cuts will not be equally distributed. "That would
be easy. I could just write everybody a letter and say 'I am
multiplying .05 times your budget, and please make up a
budget for this,' " he said.
"I don't believe in that for a number of reasons. It forgets
the fact that some departments are increasing in popularity
with undergraduates and need faculty to satisfy that, while
others are decreasing," he said.

Hastorf said he looked at the overall budget cut as "slow
ing down the pace." "I don't look at us as tearing anything
asunder."
"There may be a sort of a law of institutional life," he con
tinued, "that, . . . after a period of balanced budget, sort of
inexorable forces lead to doing more things: starting up
Western Culture, building up human biology."
Kenneth Down, the School of Engineering's associate
dean for business affairs, and Alan Cummings, the associate
director of finance for the Athletic Department, both said
that it was too early to make any predictions about specific
budget cuts. However, Cummings said that "a 5 percent cut
back would definitely have an effect on the programs that we
(the Athletic Department) support."
The budget cuts, are part of what the University's pre
liminary financial report calls "permanent gap closers" be
cause they will have a permanent effect on the budget base
(the operating budget), according to Warner.
