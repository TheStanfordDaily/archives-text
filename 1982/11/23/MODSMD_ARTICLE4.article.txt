Reagan pursues MX deployment

Washington — Wielding both stick and carrot, President Reagan pro
posed yesterday to deploy the huge MX missile in a string of Wyoming silos,
then invited the Soviet Union to take several joint steps to abate fears of an
accidental nuclear war.
"It still takes weapons to prevent war," Reagan said of his option for the
so-called dense-pack deployment of the MX, a missile he rechristened "the
Peacekeeper." But he declared "The United States wants deep cuts in the
world's arsenal of weapons."
The president proposed that the superpowers begin that process with a
concerted attempt to preclude the possibility of accidental conflict. On that
score, he proposed they tell each other in advance of plans to test intercon
tinental missiles or launch major military exercises, and suggested "a broad
ranging exchange of basic data about our nuclear forces."
In his nationally televised speech, Reagan said he hoped to "remove sur
prise and uncertainty at the sudden appearance of such missiles on the warn
ing screens of the two countries."
And in support of his proposal to exchange information about nuclear
forces, Reagan said, "The more one side knows about what the other side is
doing, the less room there is for surprise and miscalculation."
"We would prefer that the Soviets dismantle SS-18s (their intercontinental
ballistic missiles) rather than we build more holes," Reagan said in a written
statement about his MX decision. "But we can accommodate either and
maintain stability."
The long-awaited MX decision, which faces a doubtful future in Congress,
would have the United States deploy its first new intercontinental missile in
20 years.
But in his arms control speech last night, Reagan signaled the Kremlin
leadership that America would prefer reduction of nuclear arsenals to partic
ipation in a dangerous and expensive arms race.
"The United States wants deep cuts in the world's arsenal of weapons,"
Reagan said, but he insisted the Soviet Union won't bargain seriously unless
its leaders are convinced the U.S. is determined to modernize its nuclear
force.
Andropov declares no concessions
Moscow — Communist Party chief Yuri Andropov said yes
terday the future belongs to detente, hut declared that the
Kremlin will make no "preliminary concessions" toward im
proving relations with the United States.
In his first address to the party leadership since being named
general secretary Nov. 12 to replace the late Leonid Brezhnev,
Andropov stressed the continuation of Brezhnev's foreign poli
cies, including Kremlin overtures to China.
On domestic matters, he announced the promotion of a
former regional deputy director of the KGB to Politburo voting
status, and praised the work of Andrei Kirilenko, whose retire
ment from the Politburo was officially announced Monday after
several months of rumors that the 76-year-old, No. 3 Kremlin
man was out.
"We are deeply convinced that the seventies, characterized by
detente were not — as is asserted today by certain imperialist
leaders — a chance episode in the difficult history of mankind,"
he said in a 40-minute speech to the party Central Committee.
"No, the policy of detente is by no means a past stage. The future
belongs to this policy."
The speech was carried by the English language service of the
official news agency Tass and read in its entirety on evening tele
vision news.
In an apparent reference to Reagan administration statements
that the new Soviet leadership should send a signal such as pull
ing its troops out of Afghanistan, Andropov said:
"We shall not agree to this ... we have nothing to cancel," he
said, noting the Reagan administration sanctions after martial
law in Poland, against the Soviet natural gas pipeline, and rejec
tion of the 1979 strategic arms limitation treaty.
He said the escalating arms race must not be allowed to get out
of control.
Soviet leadership decisions pending
Moscow — The Communist Party Central Committee was ex
pected to fill vacancies in the ruling Politburo yesterday in the
last major leadership change likely before a new president is
named.
Appointment of a successor to President Leonid Brezhnev was
believed to be just a few days away. Brezhnev died Nov. 10.
Yuri Andropov, Brezhnev's successor as the party's general
secretary, is widely believed poised to assume the largely ceremo
nial presidency and consolidate his grip on power.
But the names of Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko, 73, and
Brezhnev protege Konstantin Chernenko, 71, also are men
tioned as candidates for the job as head of state.
The Central Committee is thought to decide the presidency,
even though the task lies constitutionally with the Supreme Sovi
et, or national Parliament, which opens its session today.
Brezhnev's death stripped the Politburo of its third top mem
ber since the January death of Kremlin ideologist Mikhail Sus
lov, who was No. 2 man behind the president.
The longtime No. 3 man, Andrei Kirilenko, reportedly retired
or was ousted late last month.
Soviet sources said it was unclear if the Central Committee
would numerically fill all three positions or just two of them
when it meets today for the second time in 10 days.
Vladimir Dolgikh, 57, and Boris Ponomarev, 77, were con
sidered the top contenders for the Politburo vacancies.
Andropov is said to be grooming Dolgikh, who has a suc
cessful background in heavy industry, to replace Premier Nikolai
Tikhonov, 77, and a Brezhnev protege.
Dolgikh is a non-voting Politburo member, a member of its
Secretariat and chief of the Central Committee's heavy industry
department.
Ponomarev is expected to be moved from candidate to full
Politburo membership to assume the Politburo ideology
portfolio, which Andropov had been handling before he was
named general secretary. Suslov had it before him. >
Congress pushes to up gas tax
Washington — The two top leaders in Congress agreed yester
day to push for swift passage of a highway construction jobs
measure in the lame-duck session of Congress that begins next
week. The plan would include an increase in the federal gasoline
tax.
"I think we can work something out and I think the odds are
good the president will support something we can work out,"
Senate Republican Leader Howard Baker (R-Tenn.) told re
-1 porters after a private meeting with House Speaker Tip O'Neill
(D-Mass.).
At the same time, Baker indicated there is virtually no chance
the post-election session will approve speeding up the personal
income tax cut scheduled for next July, even if Reagan asks for it.
"I think we've already had that debate," as far as the post-elec
tion session of the House and Senate is concerned, he said.

As for the jobs measure. Baker signalled he intends to push for
its passage even if Reagan doesn't approve. Should Reagan op
pose such a proposal, the Senate GOP leader said. "I would
argue with him."
Reagan has not yet asked Congress to approve such a plan,
although Transportation Secretary Drew Lewis has presented
him with a proposal for a five cent a gallon increase in the gaso
line tax to create an estimated 320,000 jobs in highway and mass
transit improvement.
The agreement by Baker and O'Neill's to push such a program
greatly increases its chance for passage in the post-election ses
sion, which will convene on Nov. 29 with unemployment at a his
torically high level of 10.4 percent of the work force. The session
is expected to last no longer than three weeks.
Baker said he and O'Neill had assigned aides to begin work on
a bill that can win swift bipartisan approval, but said no de
cisions had yet been made on the size of the gasoline tax increase
to be proposed. The current tax is four cents a gallon.
Poles hijack Soviet airliner
Berlin — Five Poles asked to stay in the West yesterday after
one of them hijacked a Polish airliner to West Berlin.
Four passengers aboard the plane, who had nothing to do with
hijacking, asked to remain in the West, as did the hijacker, a
militiaman assigned to a security job on the plane, West Berlin
police said.
The airliner, a Soviet-built "Antonov 24," had been on a
domestic flight with 29 passengers, a crew of four and three se
curity officers.
The hijacker, armed with two guns and two grenades, forced
the pilot to land the plane at the U.S. military airport at Tem
pelhof here. The aircraft had been on a flight from Wroclaw to
Gdansk.
Upon arrival here, the hijacker leapt from the plane, injuring
his right foot slightly, and fired six shot into the air to celebrate
his success.
The passengers, crew and security officials were taken by bus
to the terminal building and given a meal ov veal, ham and green
beans.
This was the ninth hijacking of a Polish airplane to West Berlin
since 1969.
All Polish requests for extradition of hijackers to date have
been turned down, but the hijackers usually have been sentenced
to prison.
Interest rates drop
Washington — Major U.S. banks lowered their prime lending
rates yesterday to 11.5 percent from 12 percent in the wake of the
half-point cut Friday in the Federal Reserve Board's discount
rate, but these latest interest-rate declines were not enough to
boost the stock market, which closed sharply down.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished down 21.25 points
at an even 1000. The list of blue-chip stocks on the New York
Stock Exchange has lost 65 points since reaching a record high
on Nov. 3, the day after Election Day.
Chase Manhattan, the nation's third-largest bank, led the
prime-rate move yesterday. It was quickly followed by Chemical
Bank, which had raised its prime to 12 percent only last week,
after several weeks as the only major bank charging 11.5 percent.
The last time the prime was generally as low as 11.5 percent was
in September 1980.
Banks can afford to lower their prime because the cost of mon
ey that they borrow in the money markets has declined. Yester
day the federal funds rate — charged on overnight money that
the banks borrow from each other — was below 9 percent.
Although economists believe that lower interest rates should
eventually help the nation pull out of recession, the Federal Re
serve's discount-rate move had been widely anticipated and so
was "a bit of a non-event" as far as the stock market was con
cerned, Elliot Piatt of Aubrey Lanston said yesterday.
The cut made it clear, however, that the Fed has moved away
"at least temporarily" from strict control of the money supply,
Piatt said. The central bank has encouraged interest rates to fall
even though monetary growth has exceeded the Fed's targets.
The bank is widely thought to have eased credit conditions at
least partly because of the prolonged and deep recession.
Last week it said its discount rate cut had come against a back
ground of "continued sluggishness in business activity" and
progress against inflation.
Cranston to bid for presidency
New York — Sen. Alan Cranston said yesterday he was certain
he could raise $30 miiiion to campaign for and win the Demo
cratic nomination for president in 1984.
The California senator made the prediction after paying a
courtesy call on Mayor Edward Koch at City Hall while testing
the political waters here.
"I am in New York in part exploring the presidential waters,"

he told reporters. "I will probably be a candidate for the Demo
cratic nomination in 1984."
Cranston. 68, said he has received indications of support from
key party leaders throughout the nation and feels the race is
"wide open."
Asked about financial support, he said, "You have to raise
about $30 million between now and the primary to have the
wherewithal to do what needs to be done and I have no doubt I
can raise this sum or close to it."
Cranston said he raised $3 million for his own recent campaign
and S3 1 ': million for Senate colleagues in the past two years.
"I know where the money is. I know how to get it and I don't
mind asking for it,"he said.
The senator said he has not actually gone into fund-raising yet
because he could not get matching funds from Washington until
after January.
Cranston said he expected to have the backing of his home
state of California and therefore would start out with a base of
about 20 percent of the delegates to the Democratic National
Convention.
Thompson wins Illinois governorship
Chicago — Republican Gov. James Thompson was officially
declared winner of the Nov. 2 Illinois gubernatorial election yes
terday, defeating Democratic challenger Adlai Stevenson by
5074 votes out of 3.62 million. But the closest election in the
state's history is not yet over.
Stevenson immediately announced that he would seek a re
count, saying he was "confident as ever" that he eventually
would be declared the winner. In Springfield, Thompson told re
porters that he was certain a recount would verify his victory.
There is no Illinois precedent for a total recount in a state-wide
race but the law governing a retabulation allows six months for
one to be completed.
Initially Stevenson will ask for a "discovery" recount to de
termine if there is either fraud or tabulating errors. He may re
quest a discovery recount in up to 25 percent of the 11,600 pre
cincts spread throughout the state's 111 election jurisdictions.
John Schmidt, Stevenson's legal advisor, said the former U.S.
senator and Illinois state treasurer request a preliminary recount
on at least 58 of the state's 102 counties.
"Given the closeness of the margin I think we should be able to
persuade the (judges)," Schmidt said.
Thompson too may ask for a similar discovery recount. Either
candidate has until Dec. 7 to ask the state's Supreme Court for a
full recount.
Thompson estimates that if a recount is granted it would cost
each candidate about $1 million, primarily for legal expenses.
Another estimated $5 million to $7 million in costs would come
from the state funds.
David Gilbert, spokesman for the governor, said Thompson's
campaign has raised "several hundred thousand dollars" for a
recount and is working on raising the rest. Thompson has no
campaign debts.
Stevenson, however, is several hundred thousand dollars in
debt and has raised about $70,000 for a recount, said Schmidt,
his legal advisor. Schmidt said the Stevenson campaign would
begin running newspaper ads this week seeking to raise addi
tional funds.
Jury indicts state candidate
San Francisco — The Republican candidate for state treasurer
in the November general election was indicted by a federal grand
jury Monday for allegedly submitting false and forged docu
ments in applying for government mortgage insurance.
Donald French, 35, of Westlake Village, was charged with 18
counts of making false statements and passing forged documents
to the U.S.Department of Housing and Urban Development in
four applications for HUD mortgage insurance.
French, who was defeated in the election, was charged also
with two counts of mail fraud in a fifth real estate transaction.
He is to appear before a U.S. Magistrate Dec. 17.
Stock market takes plunge
The stock market took its sharpest drop in four weeks yester
day, showing no enthusiasm for reductions in the Federal Re
serve's discount rate and the bank prime lending rate.
Multi-point losses were common in brokerage house stocks
and a wide range of blue-chip and glamor issues.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials tumbled 21.25 to ex
actly 1000, for its largest loss since it dropped a near-record 36.33
points on Oct. 25.
