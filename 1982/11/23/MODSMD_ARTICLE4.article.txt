Reagan pursues MX deployment

Washington â€” Wielding both stick and carrot, President Reagan pro
posed yesterday to deploy the huge MX missile in a string of Wyoming silos,
then invited the Soviet Union to take several joint steps to abate fears of an
accidental nuclear war.
"It still takes weapons to prevent war," Reagan said of his option for the
so-called dense-pack deployment of the MX, a missile he rechristened "the
Peacekeeper." But he declared "The United States wants deep cuts in the
world's arsenal of weapons."
The president proposed that the superpowers begin that process with a
concerted attempt to preclude the possibility of accidental conflict. On that
score, he proposed they tell each other in advance of plans to test intercon
tinental missiles or launch major military exercises, and suggested "a broad
ranging exchange of basic data about our nuclear forces."
In his nationally televised speech, Reagan said he hoped to "remove sur
prise and uncertainty at the sudden appearance of such missiles on the warn
ing screens of the two countries."
And in support of his proposal to exchange information about nuclear
forces, Reagan said, "The more one side knows about what the other side is
doing, the less room there is for surprise and miscalculation."
"We would prefer that the Soviets dismantle SS-18s (their intercontinental
ballistic missiles) rather than we build more holes," Reagan said in a written
statement about his MX decision. "But we can accommodate either and
maintain stability."
The long-awaited MX decision, which faces a doubtful future in Congress,
would have the United States deploy its first new intercontinental missile in
20 years.
But in his arms control speech last night, Reagan signaled the Kremlin
leadership that America would prefer reduction of nuclear arsenals to partic
ipation in a dangerous and expensive arms race.
"The United States wants deep cuts in the world's arsenal of weapons,"
Reagan said, but he insisted the Soviet Union won't bargain seriously unless
its leaders are convinced the U.S. is determined to modernize its nuclear
force.
