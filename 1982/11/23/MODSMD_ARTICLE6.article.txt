# Trailers to house grads
## 
### FELICIA LEE 
Many Manzanita Park trailers will be
housing three, rather than the usual
four, students next quarter, according
to residence director Carol Muller.
The trailer park will lose nearly half
of its 554 undergraduate residents to the.
Governor's Corner suites, which open
in January. For the first time, Man
zanita will admit graduate as well as un
dergraduate students, but Muller said
the park will still probably not fill.
The presence of graduate students in
the trailers will make Manzanita Park
only the second campus residence hous
ing both graduate and undergraduate
students. Currently, Mirrielees is the
onlv such University residence.
Muller said that she is looking for
ward to the change, and that it will be
good for graduate and undergraduate
students to live and interact together.
But Manzanita R.A. Katv Dore said
some residents have mixed feelings.
While some students look forward to
knowing graduate students as friends
and informal advisors, others fear that
the presence of graduate students, who
arc tvpicallv perceived as more serious
than undergraduates, would hurt the
communitv activities of Manzanita
Park.
Dore added, however, that graduate
students who do request housing in
Manzanita will be those who desire in
teraction with undergraduates.
Social activities in Manzanita, Dore
said, will be planned to take into ac

count the tastes and lifestyles of gradu
ate students. While such typical dorm
activities as going to football games and
tailgaters would probably appeal more
to undergraduates, other activities,
such as concerts and social events with
-faculty and students, would appeal to
all students.
The completion of the suites and
three new independent houses has
created a surplus of housing space for
undergraduates, Muller said, although
a serious shortage of graduate housing
still exists.
Although several graduate students
have expressed interest in living in
Manzanita, Muller said she suspects
that most of the trailers will continue to
be filled bv undergraduates this year.
The three-bedroom trailers will prob
ably not be used past 1990, but Muller
said much work has been done within
the past vear-and-a-half to upgrade
their condition, including the re
placement of the skirts at the bottom of
trailers and the repair of leaks — a
notorious problem in Manzanita.
Even though thev have their faults
and arc not a permanent solution to the
University's housing problem, Muller
said that she feels that the trailers are
"serving a good purpose right now."
Many students arc "pleasantly sur
prised" by life in Manzanita and "a lot
of people ... wouldn't live anywhere
else."
