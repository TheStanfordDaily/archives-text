## Bay Area Air Quality: New attainment date set for 1987 
### MATT PETITT 
After failing to meet the 1982 deadline for at
taining federal air pollutant standards, the Bay
Area is faced with the legal obligation of revis
ing local regulations to ensure attainment by
1987. The task is complex, though, and local
participants in the planning process are only
slightly optimistic about attainment by the new
deadline.
"The air quality planning process is a politi
cal process," explains Ron Wada of the As
sociation of Bay Area Governments (ABAG),
the lead coordinating agency in the planning
process. Scientific data from monitoring and
computer modeling provide information about
what is necessary to achieve appropriate pollut
ant reductions. But, suggests Wada, regulations
"were designed so that most companies could
comply without much trouble." With regard to
automobiles and trucks, which represent about
half the total contribution to air pollution in the
Bay Area, Wada says that government agencies
are reluctant to tell the electorate how to use its
automobiles.
Ann Garrity of the state Air Resources Board
(ARB) cited a general dependence on automo
biles as a reason for noncompliance. According
to Garrity, the emphasis has been on control de
vices, and little attention has been paid to pat
terns of usage. For example, with the new pollu
tion control devices on California cars, "the
cold start of a seven-mile trip produces half the
total emissions of the trip." Automobile
emissions can be dramatically reduced by not
using automobiles for short trips.
On the whole, the Bay Area has made large
improvements in air quality during the last dec
ade. In 1969 — the worst year on record in the
Bay Area — the number of days which exceeded
the ozone standard reached 65. In 1982, there
have only been five so far, according to Teresa
Lee of the Bay Area Air Quality Management
District (BAAQMD). In addition, the Bay Area
is the cleanest metropolitan area in the state.
Among primary pollutants identified in the
Clean Air Act, only ozone and carbon monox
ide present problems for attainment in the Bay
Area. Ozone is produced primarily in
photochemical "smog" reactions in the at
mosphere that require hydrocarbons and ni
trogen oxides emitted from a variety of sources.
Automobile and truck emissions account for
about 39 percent of hydrocarbons and 45 per

cent of nitrogen oxides in the Bay Area, as well
as most of the carbon monoxide.
The regulation of most mobile sources has
only recently been made possible by the passage
of the biennial vehicle inspection and main
tenance bill (5833) by the California Legisla
ture. Clean Air Act requirements force those
states with nonattainment areas to adopt a plan
for the annual emission inspection of motor ve
hicles. California had not adopted such a plan
by the 1979 federal deadline and was therefore
subject to a construction ban on nonattainment
areas within the state imposed by the Environ
mental Protection Agency (EPA). Despite the
negative sanction, though, the state Legislature
defeated some 15 to 20 inspection/maintenance
bills before passing 5833 last August, according
to Lee.
John Holtzclau of the Sierra Club mentioned
opposition to inspection/maintenance plans by
the California Chamber of Commerce and the
American Automobile Association as factors
contributing to the delay. In addition, however,
EPA sanctions against California in the absence
of an inspection/maintenance plan turned out
to have little impact, according to Wada. The
EPA-imposed construction ban applied to any
new plant classified as a "major stationary
source." EPA originally interpreted "major" as
100 tons of pollutant emitted per year before
application of control technology, but court de
cisions changed the interpretation to mean "af
ter" the application of control technology.
Thus, explains Wada, "everything isexempi ex
cept for really huge power plants, so the con
struction ban is a paper thing." Now that a bill
has been passed, EPA has lifted the ban.
When 5833 takes effect in 1984, cars and
trucks in designated areas (generally nonattain
ment areas) will be required to have air pollu
tion control devices checked and exhaust
emissions analyzed by a state inspection station
or state-approved inspector every two years.
For vehicles needing maintenance to meet the
inspection requirements, there is a $50 ceiling
on costs where control devices have not been re
moved. Holtzclau estimates that in 75 percent
to 95 percent of such cases, a tune-up is all that
will be needed. He emphasizes that the main
tenance requirement will generally improve gas
mileage. Second inspections are free.
Estimates of the impact of the inspect
Uon/maintenance bill on automobile and truck

emissions vary according to the strictness of en
forcement expected. "If toughness prevails,"
speculates Wada, the reductions in carbon
monoxide and hydrocarbon emissions could
reach 25 percent. A strictly enforced annual in
spection/maintenance bill could produce 40-50
percent reductions, claims Holtzclau. "As it is,
biennial, corrupt," Wada said, the reductions
will probably reach 10 to 15 percent.
Significant amounts of hydrocarbons, ni
trogen oxides and several other pollutants are
emitted bv industrial plants, although the vast
majority of Bay Area industries are in substan
tial compliance with emission standards. Ac
cording to 1979 annual averages published by
the BAAQMD, Kaiser Cement and Gypsum
Corporation of Cupertino is the single largest
emitter of nitrogen oxides in the South Bay,
emitting an average of 16 tons of nitrogen ox
ides per day.
Other notable point sources in the Bay Area
exist primarily in Contra Costa County, where
there is a concentration of petro-chemical
plants. Chevron USA, Inc. of Richmond is the
single largest polluter in the Bay Area on the
basis of tons emitted per day. The Richmond
plant's 1979 daily averages for organic com
pounds, nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide
emissions were 31 tons, 22 tons and 8.2 tons, re
spectively.
Direct authority for regulating and policing
stationary sources in California rests with iocal
air pollution control districts. The BAAQMD
is the authority for the Bay Area, having juris
diction over seven entire counties plus portions
of two others. Primary authority for regulation
of mobile emissions rests with the state Air Re
sources Board, which is the state agency re
ponsible for overall air quality planning in Cali
fornia. Whereas the inspection/maintenance
program will produce most of the reductions in
mobile source emissions, the BAAQMD plans
to implement more regulations on stationary
sources to achieve reductions there.
The National Ambient Air Quality Stan
dards, which define permissible levels of air pol
lutants for the entire nation, are adopted ac
cording to recommendations by a panel of fed

it is difficult to compensate for the reduced sup
ply of oxygen. One survey showed that more
deaths occured from heart disease in Los Angel
es during periods of relatively high carbon
monoxide concentration than during periods of
relatively low carbon monoxide concentra
tions. Other studies link exposure to carbon
monoxide to more rapid development of coro
nary artery disease, according to the American
Lung Association.
Chronic respiratory disease, such as chronic
bronchitis and emphysema, is related to levels
of sulfur oxide/particulate complex found in
smog. Particulate matter is generally swept out
of the respiratory tract by natural defense
mechanisms, but some of it inevitably becomes
lodged in the respiratory tissue. Sulfur dioxide
and sulfuric acid frequently adhere to the parti
cles. Other health effects of air pollution include
decreased lung function, increased susceptibili
ty to respiratory infections, and a possible role
in producting lung cancer.
Of concern to many Bay Area officials and
observers is the fact that some dangerous com
ponents of emissions are not yet regulated. Tox
ic emissions are not covered by the Clean Air
Act, and future regulation may have to await
the outcome of further federal research. The
state "seems interested" in toxics, according to
Lee, "but whether it will follow through or not
is uncertain. It seems unlikely with the new ad
ministration." Others stress the need to include
monitoring and controls of acid rain, in addi
tion to toxics, before the Clean Air Act is broad
enough in scope.
Recently the electronics industry in the South
Bay was identified as a major polluter, con
tributing an estimated eight tons of
hydrocarbons per day to Bay Area air, accord
ing to Lee. They are "probably the largest sta
tionary source in that area." The BAAQMD is
currently in the process of establishing rules for
the regulation of electronics industry emissions.
Efforts to change the Clean Air Act over the
last few years have largely failed. After a series
of amendments was adopted in 1977 that
broadened the scope of the act, the largest single
change has been the relaxation of the standard
for ozone from .08 parts per million (ppm) to
,12 ppm. The ozone standard used to apply to
all oxidants — chiefly products of

photochemical reactions — but has been
restircted to ozone, the most abundant of the
oxidents.
Many of the recent failed amendments were
supported by industry. According to Jack
Schwegmann of Kaiser Aluminum and
Chemical Corporation of Oakland, "The
changes that were sought by industry would not
have weakened the act." He mentioned the need
to streamline portions of the act that were pro
cedural rules leading to a waste of large
amounts of time and money without yielding
any practical benefit in the form of cleaner air.
Ultimately, he pointed out, the excess costs are
passed on at the marketplace.
As an example, Schwegmann cited the proc
ess of obtaining a PSD (Prevention of Signifi
cant Deterioration) permit. The PSD permit
system is designed to maintain high air quality
in those areas that haven't been severly affected
by pollution. Under PSD rules, a company is re
quired to collect data on ambient air quality for
one year in the area of proposed construction
before submitting a permit application. With
the time involved in setting up the equipment to
monitor air quality, the time lag between sub
mission of an application and its final approval,
and the time needed to build a plant, the com
pany has to know its buildings plans for five
years in advance of the need, according to
Schwegmann. "We can't know that," he said.
Schwegmann believes the agency doesn't even
use the monitoring information to make permit
decisions.
Chuck Auerbach of Chevron USA, Inc. in
Richmond emphasized the overall positive ef
fect of the environmental trend. "The fact that
we have general awareness is good, not bad."
Like Schwegmann, though, he stressed that
costs of regulation are eventually passed on to
the product. He also explained that it can be dif
ficult to modernize a plant so that it has less to
tal impact on the environment simply because
of the regulatory obstacles presented by en
vironmental agencies.
The immediate future of the Clean Air Act is
probably secure. "Public support is just so over
whelming to keep the Clean Air Act intact," ex
plained Karen Lang of the ARB.
As for attainment of standards by 1987,
Wada seems to express the prevailing attitude:
"I've got my fingers crossed."
