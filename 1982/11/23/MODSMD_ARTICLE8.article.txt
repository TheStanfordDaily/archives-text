# Acid rain: causes unknown but effects documented
## 
### PETER FROST 
The rainfall in Wheeling, Wejt
Virginia seemed normal to area
residents. It did not have a pecul
iar color, smell or texture; it
seemed like the same wet, grey
stuff that had been falling since
anyone could remember.
But scientists at a regional
weather station monitoring the
rain witnessed a frightening read
ing â€” the precipitation in Wheel
ing measured below 2 pH on the
acid/alkaline scale, the lowest
recording in U.S. history. Wheel
ing's rain was nearly 10,000 times
more acidic than normal rainfall,

Industry groups contend the lack of definitive,
cause-and-effect evidence makes it impossible
to direct federal regulations to the source of
the problem with any certainty.

placing it between battery acid
and lemon juice on the pH scale.
If the highly acidic rain in
Wheeling had been an isolated
incident, it may not have been
cause for alarm. But scientists are
documenting significant damage
in the Northeastern United
States, Canada and Scandinavia
from acid precipitation. The dep
osition of acidic water and solid
particles is colloquially lumped
together as "acid rain." Al
though scientists and politicians
have not reached a consensus on
the cause of the problem and its
feasible solutions, the damage to
the world's ecosystem is evident.
The first evidence of low pH
rainfall was noted by Scandina
vian scientists in the mid-19505.
Today, literally tens of thousands
of lakes affected by acids have
been confirmed as biologically
dead. They are not in isolated
pockets of the globe, but rather
stretch across large areas of
North America and the northern
regions of Europe. These lakes
generally have two things in com
mon: they are downwind from
major sources of sulfur dioxide
(SO2) and nitric oxide (NOX)
emissions and the soil around
their water does not contain the
minerals necessary to provide a
"buffering capacity" to neutral
ize the acid in low pH rainfall. As
a result, the pH balance of the
lake decreases and its capacity to
support life is reduced.
Studies in Germany, Canada,
Sweden and the United States re

veal acid rain has a dramatic ef
fect on the flora and fauna that
inhabit lakes. An increase in tox
ic metals is found where zinc,
manganese, iron and aluminim
are "leached" by acid rain from
surrounding soils and enter the
water. These metals directly af
fect fish populations, killing ex
isting species and either killing
frvs (recently hatched fish) or
creating severe deformities in
those that survive. Canadian sci
entist Dr. Harold Harvey reports
"the whole water system
changes" with low pH levels. The
increased acidity lightens the col

or of the lake's "humic staining
materials," allowing sunlight to
penetrate deeper into the water,
threatening the basic founda
tions of lake life, algae and
plankton.
Ironically, as a lake acidifies it
becomes more attractive. When
life dies off beneath the surface,
the lake water clears and be
comes brigher blue. This paradox
that makes it difficult to arouse
public attention to the real dam
age that occurs. In addition, stud
ies on the effects of acid rain on
tree reproduction, soil composi
tion and human health are now in
early stages, but the documented
damage is not very salient to the
general public.
The controversy of acid rain
stems, in part, from the inability
of scientists to document precise
ly the cause of acid rain and how
its sources can be controlled. It is
clear SO2 and NOX emissions are
the bases of the problem, but how
these emissions transform
chemically into sulfuric and
nitric acids while aloft in the at
mosphere is not understood.
Many scientists contend factors
such as sunlight, water vapor,
time aloft in the atmosphere and
local emission sources may have
a dramatic effect on the chance
that SO2 and NOX will fall to the
earth is acid rain.
Industry groups are hedging
on these uncertainties in their
fight against strict limits on the
major sources of SO2 and NOX
emissions: coal-fired power

plants, industrial smelters and
automobiles. They contend the
lack of definitive, cause-and-ef
fect evidence makes it impossible
to direct federal regulations to
the source of the problem with
any certainty. American in
dustries have a sympathetic ear in
Washington, as Reagan adminis
tration officials have gone as far
as denying the problem exists.
Anne Gorusch, Environmental
Protection Agency director, who
oversees all federal regulations
relating to air pollution, is con
vinced "there is no evidence SO2
reductions will save a single
fish."
But environmental officials in
Canada are warning the United
States that Gorusch and other
Reagan administration deputies
must soon recognize and limit the
"ecological holocaust" caused by
acid rain. Canada is bearing
down on the United States to
curb SO2 and NOX emissions
that cross the border in prevail
ing northerly winds. The United
States leads the world in dump
ing 28.5 million tons of SO2 and
24.4 millions tons of NOX into
the atmosphere each year.
Canadian officials do not be
lieve the cause of acid rain is as
uncertain as American regu
lator inaction would indicate. In

Wheeling's rain was nearly 10,000 times more
acidic than normal rainfall, placing it between
battery acid and lemon juice on the pH scale.

fact, John Roberts, Canadian
minister of the environment, has
called acid rain the "single most
important issue" in Canadian-
American relations. Botanists
project fully 48,000 lakes in Que
bec alone are in danger of
biological death.
Outside of Canada, damage in
the Northeastern United States
has reached "critical" levels, ac
cording to the National
Academy of Sciences. The low
buffering capacity of the region's
soil makes the area particularly
susceptible to emissions blowing
into New England from the Ohio
River Valley. While the foundry
belt states of Illinois, Indiana,
Ohio, Pennsylvania and West
Virginia generate much of their
electricity through the burning of
high sultuv coal, the resulting SO2
in the crouds is very important.
According to Tonnessen, vari
ables other than SO2 and NOX

emissions pour into northerly
winds that carry into New Eng
land. The nearly 1000-mile at
mospheric trek of these emissions
generates rain in New England
that averages between 4.1 and 4.4
pH.
According to the National
Clean Air Coalition, the Adiron
dack forests of New York "have
already lost 212 lakes and many
more ate threatened." Low pH
recordings have also been made
in remote areas of the Rockies, in
the normally pristine Pacific
Northwest and in the fog of San
Francisco and Los Angeles. Acid
rain is not a problem limited to
isolated regions of the country.
To many Americans, precisely
what goes on in the clouds to
transform these emissions into
toxic acids is unimportant. If SO2
and NOX emissions are going up
and sulfuric and nitric acids are
coming down is it not reasonable
to assume a synergistic effect and
limit those emissions?
However, Kathv Tonnesson, a
research assistant with the energy
and resources group at UC-
Berkelev, believes a "prepon
derance of evidence" supports
the link between SO2 and NOX
and acid rain, but cautions that
the lack of understanding about
what transformations take place

that may affect the probability of
acid rainfall cannot be dismissed;
limits on known sources may not
yield proportionately reduced
levels of acid rain. Nonetheless,
Tonnessen is adamant about the
value of controlling SO2 and
NOX emissions.
"The public tends to ignore the
very damaging effects of SO2 and
NOX emissions on their own, re
gardless of their role in acid
rain," Tonnessen said. "It may
be easier for Americans to be
come aroused over the prospect
of acid precipitation, but outside
of that area, SO2 is very damaging
to forests and vegetation and
NOX is highly injurious to hu
man health."
Although the causes are not
certain, ecological damage has
occured as a result of acid rain,
and the integrity of thousands of
waterways and a host of other
natural and human resources
may be in jeopardy.
