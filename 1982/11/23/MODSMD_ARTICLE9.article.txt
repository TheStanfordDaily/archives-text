## The
						Stanford Daily Weekend's biggest loss 
### 
It was bound to happen. When you get 5000 Stan
ford students, most high on Big Game spirits of one
sort or another, all together at an annual rally
where it has become a tradition for students to be as
obnoxious as possible by screaming, banging on car
windows and rolling on hoods — and then you lead
them running down a random parade route
through the streets of a city in which most people
couldn't care less about the football game and just
wish all the crazy, cocky, crocked people would
shut up and go home or, at the very least, get the
hell out of their way — an accident seems in
evitable.
The one that did finally come Friday night was
almost predictable. One of many San Francisco
drivers found himself amid a screaming mob.
Someone kicked his car, an eyewitness said. Others
pounded his hood. The driver told police that stu
dents taunted him and reached into his car to pull
his hair. It probably happened to other motorists.
But this driver panicked. He accelerated into the
crowd, plowing through students. At least six were
injured; four were taken to a San Francisco hospi
tal.
Our sympathies and condolences, of course, go to
the victims; we're glad that none was seriously hurt.
And we don't absolve the driver of responsi
bilitv:no matter how panicked one is, there can be
no excuse for aiming into a crowd, crashing into
students, and then driving away. That's called felo
ny hit-and-run — no trivial offense. The fact that
the driver allegedly carried an open alcoholic
beverage but no license makes us even less sympa
thetic.
Still, we can almost empathize with him. For him
to sit patiently would have been far better, but hard
ly to be expected; and to get out of his car would
have been nearly suicidal. In fact, although we're

glad police caught up with him at his house, we're
also a little relieved — on a personal level — that he
didn't stop, as the law required, at the scene of the
crime. Those who jumped out of his way chased
after him; others threw bottles. A windshield
was broken along the way. Had he gotten out of his
car, he never would have gotten up.
The fault for the accident lies as much with the
crowd as with the driver; the mood of the evening
— among students on buses driving to the City, rac
ing down the streets or partying with the band at
Aquatic Center, where yet another student was in
jured — was simply out of control. Said a San Fran
cisco policeman. "You call it a rally — we call it to
tal chaos ..." We tend to agree.
How can the rally be calmed down? San Francis
cans say they'd rather see it take place "in Palo Alto
or Berkeley." "Really, they don't care where it is, as
long as it's out of the City.
We hope it doesn't have to come to that. The Big
Game rally is a tradition we'd hate to see go the way
of the Bonfire. But clearly, the tradition won't sur
vive much longer if something isn't done to make
the rally a little more sane, a little more safe. The
obvious solution seems to be more planning and
more security: the parade route should be an
nounced in advance and streets should be cleared of
traffic. If San Francisco police are hestitant about
providing the necessary security — as well they
might be, given that ralliers aren't SF taxpayers —
the band or the University should pick up the tab.
A Big Game loss is — for some — tragic. The fact
that students were hurt in this year's rally is even
worse news. What scares us is that, if nothing is
changed, next year's post-rally headlines could very
well report the same sort of news as this year's — or,
quite possibly, far worse.
