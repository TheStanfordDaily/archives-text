# Three days later, it's 20-19
## NCAA awards Big Game to Stanford 
### BILL KUNS STAFF WRITER 
The National Collegiate Athlet
ic Association (NCAA) has
awarded last Saturday's Big Game
to Stanford, the Daily Californian
was told late last night.
The 85th Big Game, originally a
25-20 Cal win, thus will go down in
NCAA record books as a 20-19
victory for Stanford, who, like Cal,
will now finish their season at 6-5.
In an unprecedented and sure
to-be-controversial decision, a spe
cial NCAA panel, invoking a rare
ly used amendment to its bylaws,
ruled yesterday that Dwight
Garner, a Golden Bear freshman
involved in the unbelievable five
lateral kickoff return at the end of
regulation play at Memorial Stadi
um, was in fact downed by Stan
ford defenders at their 45-yard line
as the clock ran out.
The commission also found
many other irregularities in the
play, paralleling those announced
by the Pacific-10 Conference yes
terday. Although the Pac-10 stated
that the final score of the game
would not be changed, the NCAA
overruled the statement, handing
the victory to Stanford.
With four seconds left in the
game, Stanford place-kicker Mark
Harmon booted a 35-yard field
goal to give the Cardinal a one
point edge, culminating a Cardinal
comeback that saw it trailing 10-0
at the half.

And so, three days after the
Bears' epic plav thrilled its fans
and startled a watching nation, a
committee sitting in New York has
ruled the touchdown invalid and
awarded the win to Stanford,
20-19.
"Damn it," said Richard
Dwvers, the NCAA's chief operat
ing officer, "I've watched that re
play a thousand times and if that
guv wasn't downed my first name
isn't Richard. I put our appeals
panel on the case early Sunday

morning at the request of Stanford
officials, who sent a telegram to my
home in New York about 8 o'clock
(EST) Saturday night.
"When the committee reported
back to me yesterday (Tuesday)
that to a man (There are five athlet
ic directors on call for just such an
occasion, although this is the first
time they've ever been called) they
felt that Head Referee Charles
Moffett and his crew had blown
the call badly, I set the machinery
in motion to award the game to
Stanford."
Berkeley Athletic Director Dave
Maggard obviously was displeased


It was this picture, taken by photographer Art Ray, that persuaded the
NCAA to reverse the outcome of last Saturday's Big Game against Stanford.
In it, a referee partially obscured by Cal and Stanford players is
signaling the play dead (I) while Kevin Moen of the Golden Bears runs

with the ball toward the Stanford end zone (2). Moen received a final
block (3) as Stanford band members tried to avoid the play (4). The
NCAA determined that the play was blown dead before this point and
awarded the game to Stanford by the score of 20-19.
