# Bears shocked, appalled
## 
### ANDY ALLMAN STAFF WRITER 
Officials and players reacted to
last nights decision by the NCAA
with a mixture of shock and anger.

California Athletic Director
Dave Maggard was probably the
most poignant.
"Frankly I'm shocked and dis
mayed," he said late last night. "I
know this has got to be a terrible
blow both to the team and the fans
who have supported the squad all
season."

Maggard went on to say that he
will fight the decision tooth and
nail although he was not exactly
sure what recourse was open to ap
peal the decision.
"This ruling has no precedent,"
Maggard said. "Right now I'm not
exactly sure what options we have
open to us."
California players contacted last
night thought the ruling was unfair
with one player exclaiming: "This
can't really be happening."
Although the Bears did not re
ceive a bowl bid, the loss drops
their record to 6-5 and certainly
puts a damper on one of its most
exciting seasons.
Cal receiver Mariet Ford, who
made an outstanding (and con
troversial) catch in the end zone for
the Bear's first score and played
well all game long, was disap
pointed and angry at the decision.
"They can't take something like
this away from us," he said.
"When a game is over, it's over.
That's all there is to it.
"What really burns me up is that
that a group of people back in New
York who weren't even there, have
the authority to call this game. It
just isn't fair."
Other players were even more to
the point. Kevin Moen, who
scored the final touchdown called
yesterday's decision "a sad mo
ment in college athletics.
"We know we won the game,"
he said. "There's no way they
(Stanford) are going to take the
game from us. We won it fair and

square.""
After the game, Moen was ques
tioned about the touchdown and
he said he didn't even know he
scored. Last night, however, Moen
said that there was no question
that the run was fair.
"I've looked at the replays now,
I don't know how many times,"
Moen said. "There's no question
that I was in."
The decision by the NCAA
claimed that running back Dwight
Garner's forward motion was
stopped. When contacted by the
Californian last night, Garner de
nied that his knee hit the ground or
that his motion was in any way
stopped.
Many of the Cal players will not
hear about the decision till this
morning and one player, quarter
back Gale Gilbert, wishes he had
been one of them.
"At least I'd be able to sleep to
night," he said when told about the
decision. "I can't describe how I
feel right now. Lousy just doesn't
quite make it."
Even players who did not see ac
tion in the game felt the hurt just as
much. Reserve quarterback Mike
O'Donnel, a walk-on out of
Bellarmine Prep in San Jose, said
that this was the worst moment in
his football career. "Even when I
lost in the playoffs in high school
(my junior year), it didn't feel this
bad.
"I really feel bad for the seniors.
This was their last Big Game.
What a horrible way to lose."
