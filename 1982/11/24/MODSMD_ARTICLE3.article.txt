# Decision stuns Joe Kapp

### DREW DICBY STAFF WRITER 
The phone rang a dozen
times before a weary Joe Kapp
answered it.

"Hello," he said, still ob
viously in the throes of sleep.
Byt what might have been a
sweet dream before quickly be
came a nightmare as Kapp
heard for the first time of the
NCAA's decision to reverse the
outcome of Saturday's Big
Game.
All the shocked Kapp could
muster was a slow, shocked
"Oh my God, oh my God."
One could almost see the tears
brimming in his eyes on the
phone.
Then there was silence. A
long silence, lasting upwards of

two minutes.
Joe Kapp, the grown man,
the head football coach at Cal,
and the leader of young men,
was crying.
Between the sobs, Kapp
began to form words that
amounted to more than the two
previous "Oh my Gods."
"This has to be the worst mo
ment in my life," he said in a
soft, hushed voice. "Why now,
why me, why Cal, why Big
Game, why in front of 77,666
fans in Memorial Stadium,. . .
why did it have to happen to my
boys? It's just not fair."
The weeping continued,
though Kapp was gradually
collecting himself now. The
statements became louder, the

"I've said this all season long
to you folks (the press), there's
only one way to play the game
you play to win," he went on.
"We played to win on Satur
day, we did win Saturday. Now
they take it away from us.
"I ... I just don't get it.
That's not what college athlet
ics are all about."
"Life's not fair I swear to
God, it isn't."
Kapp's voice faded with
these last words and began to
sob again. After two attempts
at speech, he found it too dif
ficult.

"We won that game fair and
square. They said it was ours
ours to keep and cherish,"
Kapp said. "But now, to go
back on what they told us, it's
like, . . . like grand theft."
Kapp proceeded to recount
the famous and now infamous
kick-off return the way he saw it
or, in other words, the way the
NCAA ruling body didn't see
it.

There's no way. I saw it. I was

The California scoreboard lit up after the game to show the final
score as 25-20. Yesterday's ruling reversed the final Cal touchtown
and put that score in serious jeopardy.
