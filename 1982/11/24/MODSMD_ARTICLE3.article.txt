The phone rang a dozen
times before a weary Joe Kapp
answered it.

"Hello," he said, still ob
viously in the throes of sleep.
Byt what might have been a
sweet dream before quickly be
came a nightmare as Kapp
heard for the first time of the
NCAA's decision to reverse the
outcome of Saturday's Big
Game.
All the shocked Kapp could
muster was a slow, shocked
"Oh my God, oh my God."
One could almost see the tears
brimming in his eyes on the
phone.
Then there was silence. A
long silence, lasting upwards of

two minutes.
Joe Kapp, the grown man,
the head football coach at Cal,
and the leader of young men,
was crying.
Between the sobs, Kapp
began to form words that
amounted to more than the two
previous "Oh my Gods."
"This has to be the worst mo
ment in my life," he said in a
soft, hushed voice. "Why now,
why me, why Cal, why Big
Game, why in front of 77,666
fans in Memorial Stadium,. . .
why did it have to happen to my
boys? It's just not fair."
The weeping continued,
though Kapp was gradually
collecting himself now. The
statements became louder, the


Joe Kapp: "Life isn't fair
I swear to God it isn't."
