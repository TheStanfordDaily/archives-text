MX plan outlined
WASHINGTON President
Reagan called on Congress to ap
prove a controversial $26 billion plan
to deploy the MX missile in a "dense
pack" configuration at Warren Air
Korce Base near Cheyenne, Wyo.
At the same time, the president ap
pealed to the Soviet Union to take
several steps with the United States
designed to ease fears of an accidental
nuclear war. Among other things, he
proposed "a broad-ranging exchange
of basic data about our nuclear
forces."

Fven before the president officially
announced his support of the MX
basing plan in a letter to Congress, his
critics on Capitol Hill said they
would press for a different deploy
ment system or try to kill the missile
program outright.
Reagan said his plan was needed to
assure preservation of a retaliatory
nuclear force in the event of a Soviet
first strike. "It still takes weapons to
prevent war," he said.
The president told a national tele
vision audience that while he will seek
peace through arms reductions as
well as deterrence, he had concluded
"it is absolutely essential that we pro

ceed to produce the missile" and that
the MX be deployed in a series of
closely based silos near the air base.
Former Presidents Nixon, Ford
and Carter all supported develop
ment of the MX (for experimental
missile) as a means of increasing the
United States' power of deterrence.
The "dense pack" system settled on
bv Reagan is one of more than 30 bas
ing plans studied since the MX pro
gram was originated in 1973.
The first deployment decision was
made by Carter, who wanted to place
200 missiles in rail-connected under
ground shelters in Utah and Nevada.
Both states opposed that plan and
Reagan scrapped it.
In his television address, Reagan
said that after taking office he felt
"the (Carter) proposal on where and
how to base the missile simply cost
too much in terms of money, and the
impact on our citizens' lives."
The plan he endorsed, the presi
dent said, "requires only half as many
missiles as the early plan and will fit
in an areaofonly 20 square miles. It is
the product of around-the-clock re
search that has been under way since
1 directed a search for a better,
cheaper way. I urge the members of
Congress who must pass this plan to

listen and examine the facts, before
they come to their own conclusion."
Defense hurts Reagan
WASHINGTON Public sup
port has seriously eroded for Presi
dent Reagan's efforts to build up the
nation's defenses with costly weap
ons systems while cutting back on so
cial programs, the Los Angeles Times
Poll has found.
Reagan clearly did not receive the
mandate to "stay the course" with his
policies that he asked American vot
ers for this fall. Seven-of-10 persons
interviewed last week during a na
tionwide survey said they regard the
Nov. 2 elections as neither an en
dorsement nor a repudiation of the
president, but a more neutral posi
tion somewhere in between.

As Reagan proceeds with his $25
billion program of development and
deployment of 100 MX missiles a
project he says is needed to help close
the nation's "window of vulner
ability" to nuclear attack public
support is significantly waning for
the concept of U.S. military superior
ity.
And as the president's own econo
mists and advisers increasingly warn
of a potential budget deficit ap
proaching $2OO billion for fiscal year
1984 red-ink spending that could
send interest rates soaring again
the public has decided that the presi
dent already has cut too deeply into
domestic programs and now should

replenish them with more money, the
telephone survey showed.
Reagan currently is preparing a
fiscal 1984 federal budget to submit
to the next Congress on Jan. 17. De
spite stiffening congressional opposi
tion, the president has made it plain
that he intends to press for even
deeper cuts in domestic programs in
order to reduce the deficit, while
pushing forward with a $1.6 trillion,
five-vear defense buildup that entails
7 percent annual growth in military
expenditures.
Oil drilling broadened
SAN FRANCISCO Oil com
pany executives and officials of the
Interior Department announced yes
terday plans to broaden the leasing of
offshore oil plots to include zones
formerly withheld off the Northern
California coast.
Following the oil finds near Santa
Barbara that energy corporation
spokesmen have termed the largest
since thePrudhoe Bay discoveries off
the Alaskan coast, the expansion of
oil leasing sparked immediate debate
between environmental groups and
experts who termed recent explora
tion finds "most promising."
The disputed exploratory drilling
has led Interior Dept. officials to
open bidding for drilling in zones
284, 266 and 243 or roughly the re
gion starting two miles east of San
Francisco and extending 24 miles
toward the northwest. Previously dis

counted bv oil experts and others as
not worth exploration, the region is
now regarded as a prime area for rich
crude, used widely as a high sulphur
fuel and as a lubricant.
The agreement, tentatively
targeted by California officials as a
boon to devastated education fund
ing, came amidst high-level meetings
here between federal, recently elected
state and corporate officials. Like In
terior Secretary James Watt's pre
viously ill-fated attempts to expand
oil leasing, this agreement has drawn
the wrath of local and national en
vironmental groups.
NASA to expand
WASHINGTON —The National
Aeronautics and Space Adminis
tration signed an SI 1.6 million con
tract with a 22-member Arab or
ganization Monday to launch a com
munications satellite from the space
shuttle in 1984.
Both Libya and the Palestine Lib
eration Organization are members of
the "Arabsat" consortium.

The original proposal to build the
satellite caused an uproar on Capitol
Hill until the administration was able
to persuade senators that the deal did
not involve military technology or
imply recognition of the PLO.
The Arabsat consortium belongs
to the 22-member Arab League and
its center of operations is to be in
Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.

Defense hurts Reagan
WASHINGTON Public sup
port has seriously eroded for Presi
dent Reagan's efforts to build up the
nation's defenses with costly weap
ons systems while cutting back on so
cial programs, the Los Angeles Times
Poll has found.
Reagan clearly did not receive the
mandate to "stay the course" with his
policies that he asked American vot
ers for this fall. Seven-of-10 persons
interviewed last week during a na
tionwide survey said they regard the
Nov. 2 elections as neither an en
dorsement nor a repudiation of the
president, but a more neutral posi
tion somewhere in between.

As Reagan proceeds with his $25
billion program of development and
deployment of 100 MX missiles a
project he says is needed to help close
the nation's "window of vulner
ability" to nuclear attack public
support is significantly waning for
the concept of U.S. military superior
ity.
And as the president's own econo
mists and advisers increasingly warn
of a potential budget deficit ap
proaching $2OO billion for fiscal year
1984 red-ink spending that could
send interest rates soaring again
the public has decided that the presi
dent already has cut too deeply into
domestic programs and now should

replenish them with more money, the
telephone survey showed.
Reagan currently is preparing a
fiscal 1984 federal budget to submit
to the next Congress on Jan. 17. De
spite stiffening congressional opposi
tion, the president has made it plain
that he intends to press for even
deeper cuts in domestic programs in
order to reduce the deficit, while
pushing forward with a $1.6 trillion,
five-vear defense buildup that entails
7 percent annual growth in military
expenditures.
Oil drilling broadened
SAN FRANCISCO Oil com
pany executives and officials of the
Interior Department announced yes
terday plans to broaden the leasing of
offshore oil plots to include zones
formerly withheld off the Northern
California coast.
Following the oil finds near Santa
Barbara that energy corporation
spokesmen have termed the largest
since thePrudhoe Bay discoveries off
the Alaskan coast, the expansion of
oil leasing sparked immediate debate
between environmental groups and
experts who termed recent explora
tion finds "most promising."
The disputed exploratory drilling
has led Interior Dept. officials to
open bidding for drilling in zones
284, 266 and 243 or roughly the re
gion starting two miles east of San
Francisco and extending 24 miles
toward the northwest. Previously dis

counted bv oil experts and others as
not worth exploration, the region is
now regarded as a prime area for rich
crude, used widely as a high sulphur
fuel and as a lubricant.
The agreement, tentatively
targeted by California officials as a
boon to devastated education fund
ing, came amidst high-level meetings
here between federal, recently elected
state and corporate officials. Like In
terior Secretary James Watt's pre
viously ill-fated attempts to expand
oil leasing, this agreement has drawn
the wrath of local and national en
vironmental groups.
NASA to expand
WASHINGTON —The National
Aeronautics and Space Adminis
tration signed an SI 1.6 million con
tract with a 22-member Arab or
ganization Monday to launch a com
munications satellite from the space
shuttle in 1984.
Both Libya and the Palestine Lib
eration Organization are members of
the "Arabsat" consortium.

The original proposal to build the
satellite caused an uproar on Capitol
Hill until the administration was able
to persuade senators that the deal did
not involve military technology or
imply recognition of the PLO.
The Arabsat consortium belongs
to the 22-member Arab League and
its center of operations is to be in
Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.
MX plan outlined
WASHINGTON President
Reagan called on Congress to ap
prove a controversial $26 billion plan
to deploy the MX missile in a "dense
pack" configuration at Warren Air
Korce Base near Cheyenne, Wyo.
At the same time, the president ap
pealed to the Soviet Union to take
several steps with the United States
designed to ease fears of an accidental
nuclear war. Among other things, he
proposed "a broad-ranging exchange
of basic data about our nuclear
forces."

Fven before the president officially
announced his support of the MX
basing plan in a letter to Congress, his
critics on Capitol Hill said they
would press for a different deploy
ment system or try to kill the missile
program outright.
Reagan said his plan was needed to
assure preservation of a retaliatory
nuclear force in the event of a Soviet
first strike. "It still takes weapons to
prevent war," he said.
The president told a national tele
vision audience that while he will seek
peace through arms reductions as
well as deterrence, he had concluded
"it is absolutely essential that we pro

ceed to produce the missile" and that
the MX be deployed in a series of
closely based silos near the air base.
Former Presidents Nixon, Ford
and Carter all supported develop
ment of the MX (for experimental
missile) as a means of increasing the
