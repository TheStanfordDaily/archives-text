The events of the last 24
hours have once more demon
strated that the NCAA is an
archaic blight upon college ath
letics. We were robbed, pure
and simple, and we shouldn't
feel sorry about saying so. Sour
grapes or no, this is not fair.
While we recognize the need
for some form of organization
control the ever-growing list
of intercollegiate sports, we
also recognize that the NCAA
is enforcing outdated rules and
slapping stiff penalties on
schools that break them.
At this point, it isn't even
worth detailing the events of
last Saturday's Big Game. Not
only do all of us know it, but
the game had settled back into
history just as surely as if it had
been engraved on stone.
Some people say that the of
ficials made some bad calls.
Bad calls have happened before
over the years, both for and
the Golden Bears and
Stanford. It is not ignorant or
cruel to say "that's the breaks;"
the only strategy to deal with
such occurrences is acceptance.
Somehow, the adminis
trators at Stanford (and at the
NCAA) ran around the things
all other teams have to deal
with. The Cardinal felt they
were victims of a bad call, or
that's what they say. Whereas

before the most that could hap
pen in the event of short
comings in officiating is an ad
mission of guilt without affect
ing the score, now the NCAA
and Stanford have made it an
acceptable practice to change
the scores of games long since
past.
Part of the old cliche about a
team coming to play "for the
full 60 minutes" is that once
those 60 minutes are past, the
game is over. The NCAA is set
ting a dangerous precedent
here; who knows what game
they'll seek to reverse next?
Football is meant to be played

on the field, however sloppily
or badly; it has no business
being decided in a courtroom.
The NCAA was founded to
help college athletes. But it cer
tainly hasn't helped 60 Califor
nia Golden Bear football
players by penalizing them for
the alleged misdeeds of a few.
These fine young men have
put hours, and in some cases a
lifetime, of work into bringing
the Golden Bear athletic pro
gram back from the depths of
its own follies.
And now this.
The NCAA would have you
believe that their decision is in

the interest of fair play and jus
tice. Simply put, that is wrong.
Is it right to take away from the
efforts of 60 Cal football
players? Is it right to deny
30,000 Cal students the hard
earned privilege of winning
back the Axe? Is it right to tell
77,666 fans in Memorial Stadi
um that they were wrong when
they saw Kevin Moen cross the
goal line and when they heard
the cannon on Tightwad Hill
go off?
Forget it. It can't be done.
We know what we saw and
heard. We know how hard the
team worked all through the
game. We know the roller

coaster of emotions that we
had to ride on to get to where
we were at the end of the game
Saturday. In our hearts and in
our minds, we feel we won this
Big Game, and no one will ever
take that away from us.
But don't expect this to be
come a puTely symbolic effort
vet. If this game is going to be
decided in the courtrooms,
then so be it. We're prepared to
fight this decision by the
NCAA as long as it takes. If
Stanford wants to steal a vic
tory, they'll have to work hard
for it harder than they've
worked in any game this sea
son.

with. The Cardinal felt they
were victims of a bad call, or
that's what they say. Whereas

before the most that could hap
pen in the event of short
comings in officiating is an ad
mission of guilt without affect
ing the score, now the NCAA
and Stanford have made it an
acceptable practice to change
the scores of games long since
past.
Part of the old cliche about a
team coming to play "for the
full 60 minutes" is that once
those 60 minutes are past, the
game is over. The NCAA is set
ting a dangerous precedent
here; who knows what game
they'll seek to reverse next?
Football is meant to be played

on the field, however sloppily
or badly; it has no business
being decided in a courtroom.
The NCAA was founded to
help college athletes. But it cer
tainly hasn't helped 60 Califor
nia Golden Bear football
players by penalizing them for
the alleged misdeeds of a few.
These fine young men have
put hours, and in some cases a
lifetime, of work into bringing
the Golden Bear athletic pro
gram back from the depths of
its own follies.
And now this.
The NCAA would have you
believe that their decision is in

the interest of fair play and jus
tice. Simply put, that is wrong.
Is it right to take away from the
efforts of 60 Cal football
players? Is it right to deny
30,000 Cal students the hard
earned privilege of winning
back the Axe? Is it right to tell
77,666 fans in Memorial Stadi
um that they were wrong when
they saw Kevin Moen cross the
goal line and when they heard
the cannon on Tightwad Hill
go off?
Forget it. It can't be done.
We know what we saw and
heard. We know how hard the
team worked all through the
game. We know the roller

coaster of emotions that we
had to ride on to get to where
we were at the end of the game
Saturday. In our hearts and in
our minds, we feel we won this
Big Game, and no one will ever
take that away from us.
But don't expect this to be
come a puTely symbolic effort
vet. If this game is going to be
decided in the courtrooms,
then so be it. We're prepared to
fight this decision by the
NCAA as long as it takes. If
Stanford wants to steal a vic
tory, they'll have to work hard
for it harder than they've
worked in any game this sea
son.
