Ideals sacrificed for
immediate student gain
Editor:
This letter is in response to a column which
appeared in the Daily Californian(Nov. 14)
discussing the pressures placed upon under
graduates to find employment upon gradu
ation.
When I went to UC, in the not so very far
-off days of a decade ago, I and my colleagues
were concerned with more than the immediate
pecuniary benefit of the moral abdication
portrayed as the attractive engineering or
medical position. Berkeley in those days had a
reputation as more than the hothouse for
grinding, self-absorbed nerds that it so widely
holds at the moment. The very word
"Berkeley" captured all the indignation, out
rage and involvement of a wronged gener
ation, and the current students would do well
to at least acknowledge the impressive
heritage they all bear.
I admit that classes for themselves, then as
now, were slighted, but UC has never been
known as a bastion of intellectualism. Instead,
we captured the attention of a nation looking
Pfor the color, indignation and media sense
that only we could provide. We fulfilled a
purpose, and I am proud to have been part of
that glory of the time.
What Cal student can claim that now? The
glorv portrayed in the recent article is one of
thousands of drooling students, squirreled
awav in libraries, studying furiously to master
the facts and formulas their betters could
learn in an average hour in the sun. And to
what end? The latest statistics show the aver
age grad aspires and achieves little more than
a middle level management position if in busi
ness, moderate success in medicine and the

golden ring only in serving the death mongers
through,a local high tech or engineering firm.
Ah, California, how far you have sunk from
the halycon days of banners and thrown bot
tles, when no one told us "no" including an
administration pushed up against the wall and
an Establishment your recent article so
ardently espoused.

Now, as then, the way to right the problems
facing such a great university is not through
students cowering in their diapers, as this pa
per's editorials show to be the case, but
through an indignation that results in de
mands. Where, after all, are the minority pro
fessors, the special education programs and
the Third World curriculums that we of the
'6os argued so forcefully for? We were prom
ised, and the students of the current gener
ation cannot let the rhetoric of budget crises
or the myth of the job market disssuade them
from their mandate. I call on the students of
Berkeley today to crawl out of their library
carrels and to stand up for a moment: don't
take no for an answer.

Faculty salaries are
part of a tight budget
Editor:
I read the article regarding faculty salaries
in the Daily Californian of November 18, and
quite frankly I don't feel that the increasing of
faculty salaries is a top priority.
Like the Chrysler automobile company,
California is finding that budget tightening is
a necessary evil in keeping a balanced and re
sponsible budget. At this point in time, an in
crease in faculty salaries would only ex
asperate the financial problems facing the

University of California system.
One of the great things about the University
of California system is that it is the best tuition
free education in the United States. Already
under severe financial stress, the system has
actually thought about raising the UC fees
and has even considered tuition.
I think tuition would be one of the greatest
crimes that the UC system could commit.
Founded in the name of providing tuition-free
education so that qualified students of all
races and income level could attend college,
Berkeley, unlike the snob school across the
Bay, is a school where students all have equal
opportunity to attend.
Another important point regarding faculty
salaries is the cost of living. In many areas, the
cost of living is much higher than it is in the
Berkeley area.
I do favor small increases in salaries, at least
to keep up with inflation, only for the truly
outstanding faculty members so that we do
not lose them. We must keep our Nobel Prize
winners. However, the rest of them are going
to have to tighten their belts like everybody
else.
Like any businessman will tell you, you
can't give out more than you take in or you
will run a deficit. The government is learning
that lesson right now. Let's hope the UC sys
tem does not make the same mistake.

Cloyne Court a
disgrace if standing
Editor:
I can't believe that the university has named

Clovne Court a city landmark. The old house
is a pit and should be torn down.
For those people unfamiliar with the house,
it's a 78-vear-old cooperative house which
Landmark Preservation Commissioner Sara
Knight termed "historical for architectural
reasons." Never has a statement been further
from the truth.
To put it nicely, the house is full of rats,
mice, insects, termites and every other pest
that one can think of. It is not only unsanitary,
it's a disgrace to the Berkeley community to
keep it standing.
In an era whÂ»re student housing has not
only become expensive, but also unavailabe, it
seems a great injustice to keep this house
standing as a city landmark. The university
always complains about a lack of land when
ASUC committees address the housing prob
lem. Well what about this piece of land?
There's simply no excuse for keeping this old
dump.
Maybe little old ladies will enjoy walking
around in this place, at least that is the excuse
that Knight gives, but I doubt it. Ask yourself
this question. Would you like to walk around
in a old wooden house because it has architec
tural significance?
In this case, never has this statement been
more true. Students want better housing.
They demand better housing. The Landmark
Preservation Committee should consider this
before deciding to keep this building.
