# The 						fate of the Axe is still in doubt
## 
### KATE CALLAGHEN STAFF WRITER 
In the wake of the NCAA con
troversal ruling, officials at both
California) and Stanford are still in
limbo about what to do with the
Axe.
Although technically the Axe
(and the plaque to which it is at
tached) goes to the school that
wins the Big Game, this year's

game certainly has extenuating cir
cumstances and there is some ques
tion as to whether California will
willingly give the axe back.
A member of the California rally
committee who did not want to be
identified said that he did not feel
the Axe should be given back, but
it remains to be seen what top ad
ministrators will have to say.
Cal took the Axe following the

game, but apparently it did not get
it willingly. While members of the
Stanford rally committee paraded
with the Axe following the con
fusion at the end of the game, Cali
fornia students took the Axe from
the rally committee of the red and
white.
Max Scheder, a Stanford stu
dent and member of the rally com
mittee, was reached by the Califor
nian last night.
"If what you say is true," the
Axe belongs back here on the farm,
he said. "I thought we won the
game as it was, but it's nice to here (
that the NCAA let justice prevail.
\lf Cal doesn't return the thing (the
Axe) somebody here is bound to go
over (to Berkeley) and steal it."
If Cal does not return the Axe,
security will be especially tight.
The last three attempts to steal the
Axe (two of which were successful)
involved Stanford students posing
as photographers with phony
credentials, and it does not seem
likely that Berkeley security will be
fooled by that scheme again. (
What to do about the Axe will
certainly be an emotional issue on
both campuses this year with both
sides sure to feel that they deserve
it.
McCasey said that California
will probably wait until the whole
game question is settled before any
decision on the Axe is made.
"We're just going to have to wait
until all of this blows over," he
said.
