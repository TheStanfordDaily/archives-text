# No decision precedent
## 
### KATE CALLAGHEN STAFF WRITER 
No collegiate game has ever
been overturned and yesterday's
decision may be a precedent-set
ting one for the National Col
legiate Athletic Association.
Using Rule 65, Section C of the
amended bylaws, the NCAA ex
ecutive committee cited a clear
case of officials missing a call as the
reason for its decision to award
Stanford the victory in last Satur
day's Big Game.
The fact that the controversial
call was on the final play of the
game was also an important factor.
If the play had been blown dead
like NCAA officials felt it should
have been, the Golden Bears
would not have had the opportuni
ty to score.
Many sources in Berkeley feel
that it was Stanford Athletic Di
rector Andy Geiger's contacts in
the NCAA that made the protest

possible. Geiger is on several
NCAA committees, including the
NIT tournament committee. Well
respected around the nation,
Geiger's influence played a major
role in getting the NCAA to con
sider the protest.
After Saturday's game, a protest
seemed unlikely. Although a
steaming Stanford coach Paul
Wiggin and Geiger stormed into
the officials dressing room and ex
changed obscenities, Geiger told
the press moments later that noth
ing could be done about the game.
"Right now, there is nothing
that I know of that we can do," he
said outside the Stanford locker
room.
Geiger was either biding his time
and knew all along that he was
going to launch a protest, or he se
riously had not yet found the rule.
