# Stanford officials surprised only by timing of controversial decision
## 
### ANDY ALLMAN STAFF WRITER 
Those who came out on the fa
vorable end of the NCAA's de
cision to reverse the Big Game out
come were not ready to "rub in"
what they felt was obvious
Both Stanford head coach Paul
Wiggin and Athletic Director
Andy Geiger were reluctant to
make any snide remarks concern
ing the 85th Big Game.
"I don't know how the appeals
process works," Wiggin said. "All
I know is that the score is now
20-19 and Stanford has the 20. We
won. It's over now and I'm going
to take a long vacation and enjoy
what should have been ours from
the start."
Geiger said that although he ex
pected the ruling in Stanford's fa
vor, he was surprised a decision
was not announced earlier. "I
thought they would make an an
nouncement (concerning the ap

peal) as early as late Saturday night
or at the latest Sunday afternoon,"
he said in a midnight phone in
terview.
"I'm tired. I've been on the
phone cross-country all weekend
and for the first two days of this
week," Geiger continued. "I really
started to get nervous about the
whole thing Sunday night and
since then I've been making all
kinds of calls trying to find out
what the hell was going on."
Geiger added that although
Stanford will now finish the season
at 6-5, it will not play in the Hall of
Fame Bowl in Birmingham, Ala
bama, as expected with a Big
Game victory. Air Force was in
vited Sunday to play Vanderbilt in
the Dec. 31 game.
"The reason the Hall of Fame
people held off so long in giving
out their other bid (to Air Force)
was to await the NCAA's decision
concerning the Big Game," he

said. "If they (the NCAA) had
made their decision and an
nounced it Sunday morning, we
would have still received the invita
tion to the (Hall of Fame) bowl."
As it resulted, according to
Geiger, the Hall of Fame Bowl
committee felt pressured to find
another team by midday Sunday
and couldn't wait any longer for
the NCAA.
"All that talk about Cal being a
candidate for the Hall of Fame
Bowl was just a ploy on the Hall of
Fame committee's part to buy
some time and wait to see if they
could take us," Geiger noted.
Wiggin said he would hold a
10:00 a.m. meeting today with his
players to "debrief them on the sit
uation."
Cardinal quarterback John
Elwav was reached over the phone
late last night and, although sur
prised by the NCAA's decision,
would make no comment

Although the flag was against Stanford for too many men on the field,
coach Paul Wiggin thought he saw many things wrong on the play. Late
last night, the NCAA agreed with him.
