# History professor flooded by press for views on post-Brezhnev U.S.S.R.

### BRUCE FINLEY 
The past two weeks have been busy for
Alexander Dallin, a history and political sci
ence professor here who is one the nation's
foremost experts on Soviet-American rela
tions. Since the death of Soviet general party
chairman Leonid Brezhnev's death he has
faced an onslaught of media representatives
curious about the implications of Yuri An
dropov's succession.
Although he said he is frequently mis
quoted by the press, Dallin remains positive
about its role. "Sooner or later something
gets through that you think is worth saying. 1
think it is a matter of public responsibility. If
you're willing to say these things in class
privately, then 'you ought to be willing to say
these things publicly too," he said in a Daily
interview.
"It's been busy," Dallin said of the recent
weeks, "because all of a sudden people have
discovered that there are some things about
the Soviet Union that are interesting and that
we don't know." Regarding Andropov's suc
cession, Dallin insisted that "we know as little
about that as anybody else." But he said that
his insights into the Reagan administration's
attitude toward Soviet relations suggest that
the United States could be better prepared to
deal with its greatest rival.
"I think we have fewer people in the admin
istration in Washington who know anything
about the Soviet Union than in any other ad
ministration I can think of since 1945,"
Dallin explained. One reason is that "the peo
ple in the administration think they have all
the answers and that thev don't need any spe
cialists." He added, "Many of the specialists
disagree with what the administration stands
for in terms of relations with the Soviet
Union."
Nevertheless, he sees a danger when aca
demics suddenly assume a broader public

role. "All ofa sudden you begin to pontificate
and think of yourself as having answers to
complicated questions," he said. According
to Dallin, "the practical work in government
requires a kind of mind, a kind of approach,
that many academics lack. For one thing,
most of us have never had to deal with real
power, with how you get things done." He
said there is a need for government to listen
more to what experts have to say, rather than
to "buy their advice" on how to solve the
problem.
A senior research fellow at the Hoover In
stitution from 1971 -1978, and also the former
director of the Russian Institute at Columbia
University, Dallin remarked that student
.apathy regarding politics may be decreasing.
"I was interested in seeing some of the ban
ners about the nuclear freeze hanging from
some of the fraternities. That doesn't quite fit
the image of apathy." But on the whole,
Dallin pointed out, during the activism of 10
to 15 years ago "there was much more of a
discussion of issues, much more of a sense of
concern than one sees right now."
Students may be exposed to misleading in
terpretations of Soviet political temperament
from Soviet lecturers exiled for political rea
sons. Dallin suggested that dissidents have a
natural tendency "to press their own case in
rather extreme terms." Dallin himself played
down the role of historical forces in Soviet
ideology, agreeing that Soviet policy is de
termined more by self-interest. Although he
acknowledged elements of coercive ideology
often repeated, he said he doesn't "see any ev
idence that the people of the Soviet Union are
eager to fight for anything. There's no partic
ular reason why they should want to sacrifice
themselves."
A rivalry between the Soviet Union and the
United States to demonstrate who can pro
vide the best quality of life for the population

would be healthy, according to Dallin. He
said such rivalry would spur necessary
changes in the United States, But, he said,
"the arms race is a very dangerous thing, and
it's also terribly wasteful of resources that are
needed for other things. I think unilateral
freeze is not the answer. It should be
bilateral," he said.
Dallin criticized past U.S. efforts towards
such a bilateral freeze. He cited the failure of
SA LT 11 as an American blunder. "In the last
analysis, we're the ones that didn't ratify it.
We could have gone on from there to other
arms agreements that might have been more
meaningful, that might have established ceil
ings or reductions in weapons, either produc
tion or deployment." He added that he isn't
sure "that everybody involved in it is com
mitted clearly to reaching the maximum
agreement as soon as possible."
Overall, Dallin said he sees great danger
that such a high level of tension may cause the
two "military machines" to unwillingly
"stumble" into war.
