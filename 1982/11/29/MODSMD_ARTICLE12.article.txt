## The 						Stanford Daily KAs and uniform enforcement 
### 
As it is with presidential administrations so it is
with smaller groups such as clubs and fraternities:
all tend to blame, often without cause, their present
financial woes on the groups that went before. But
in the case of the current membership of the Kappa
Alpha fraternity, present fiscal woes do arise from
the mistakes of previous officers .. . and perhaps
the acquiesence of the system.
Two years ago, KA members realized the house's
debt to the University had risen to a significant level
â€” unofficially estimated between $15,000 and
$25,000 and unofficially handed down to the pres
ent members by fraternity brothers who had gradu
ated in previous years. Though kitchen mismanage
ment and damage charges caused the major portion
of the group's deficit, the default of house mem
bers who graduated with bills outstanding com
prise an estimated 25 percent of the fraternity's
debts.
The University confronted house officers with
the debt last year, and, according to the terms of a
mutually stipulated agreement, has given the
fraternity until the end of this academic year to pay
off the debt. The house's commissary credit has
been cut off until the money is paid back.
A couple of institutional safeguards were im
plemented by the University once the financial
problem came to light. The commissary credit was
discontinued as a "routine warning." Active
fraternity members were required to inform last
year's pledges of the group's indebtedness before
the pledges accepted their bids. Both of these ac
tions exhibit good faith and a desire to help the
fraternity find its way out of the fiscal labyrinth that
has been created. But it is possible that the residen
tial administration, by making its position more
clear, could have done more to help the KAs avert
their current crisis.

It seems the University has failed to make clear
the penalties for the default of independent houses.
If the K A house fails to pay off its debt, will the resi
dents be kicked off campus? Will the University
take over the administration of the house? It isn't
clear, but it should be.
The University has in the past tended to leave the
bounds of collective responsibility in hazy territory.
When two Zeta Psi members threw a Mills College
girl into a pond last year, the entire fraternity was
thrown off campus. Yet large quantities of stolen
furniture was found in the Delta Upsilon fraternity
house, members were assured the group would not
be held responsible for the incident; the investiga
tion, which was later halted for lack of evidence,
was focused solely on individuals. Although the
Zete infraction was more serious and one of many
incidents, an inconsistency seems to exist in the
handling of the two problems. In the case of the
KAs, the entire fraternity is being held responsible
for the acts of members who have graduated.
Should the bounds of collective responsibility ex
tend beyond graduation? The University has left its
standards conveniently undefined.
This is not to say that the KA house should be re
lieved of its responsibility to pay its bills, but per
haps a system should be created to avert the reoc
currence of a similiar problem. Mind you, we're not
calling for anything as drastic as a balanced budget
bill. Yet it might be a good idea to put some
leverage on seniors in independent houses to pay
off their debts before graduation. Although these
students do live with a group independent of the
University, the debts they incur ultimately are owed
to the University. If diplomas are withheld because
of unreturned library books and unpaid dorm rent,
why shouldn't they be withheld for default on car
rots bought on credit at the commissary?
