### 
No matter where you stand politi
cally, it seems pretty clear that eco
nomic times are bad and may be get
ting worse. Rising unemployment, de
clining productivity, growing govern
ment deficits, stubbornly high interest
rates and failing sales point to eco
nomic stagnation. The strength of the
stock market does little to counter the
bleakness of the situation. How did we
get hereT More importantly, how do

we achieve recovery ?
Your opinion, "stay the course" or
otherwise, deserves to be heard. The
Daily is planning a "forum page*' on
the subject of the state and national
economies. Contriputions should be
typed double-spaced on a 5 7-charac
ter line. Send them to: The Stanford
Daily, Storke Publications Center,
Stanford, California 94305, or bring
them by the opinions office.
