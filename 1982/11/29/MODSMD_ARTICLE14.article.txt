## Wiggin, with time-out, could have prevented Big Game play 
### 
I am sorry I have to write this letter.
The Stanford football team's coaching
staff is supposedly a bunch of nice guys.
It's tough to deliver blows to nice guys.
But, there have been at least a half
dozen games over the last two years that
have made me want to write a letter in
dicting these nice guys.
Somehow, however, there was
always next week or next year to look
forward to. Unfortunately, I am a sen
ior now and there are no more next
weeks or next years in terms of watch
ing my classmates win football games.
An optimistic freshman who entered
expecting Rose Bowls has been con
verted to a cynical realist who expects
losses.
Indeed, the perfect motto for this
year's season would be that "there's
always a way to lose." By the end of the
season, I would just sit in the stands
waiting for our coaching staff to con
coct some way to lose the ball game. Re
member Arizona State and the prevent
defense that prevented victory? Or how
about USC and the last two minutes of
the first half when indecisiveness
(should we run the clock out or try to
score? — no, let's do neither) turned the
momentum and the game to USC. Per
haps the best (aside from the "Big
Farce") was the Arizona game — let's
let our great offense and St. John get us
ahead and then quit using them in the
third quarter.
Then, of course, there was the Big
Game, and the most costly error. How
can one blame the loss to Cal on the
coaches, many might ask? Why not
blame the refs, the band or God? What
everyone forgets is that the last play of
the game never should have taken
place. If we had waited six more sec
onds to call time out before Harmon's
field goal attempt, the clock would have
run out and there never would have
been the kickoff return controversy.
With the Stanford coaching staff, how
ever, "there's always a way to lose,"
and so time out was called with eight
seconds left rather than with two. The
only possible justification for calling
time out with eight seconds left is that if
the kick were blocked, another play
could be run; due to the fact that it was
our last time out, however, there is no
possibility that another play could have
been run.
Thus, what we have is a case of a

coach who panicked and in so doing
cost his team and his university the
game. Remember, too, that this was'not
just any game; aside from the fact that it
was the Big Game, and all kinds of
pride was on the line, the Cardinal was
also playing for a bowl bid which would
mean hundreds of thousands of dollars
to the University. Indeed, one can say
that this coaching blunder was literally
a very costly one. Six more ticks of the
clock before calling time out and Stan
ford would have had a winning season
and been headed to the Hall of Fame
Bowl, thus gaining further positive na
tional experience and boosting future
recruiting possibilities. Instead, time
out was called with eight seconds left,
and Stanford football became a na
tional joke.

Appeal last play
Prior to coming to Stanford 14 years
ago I taught for 10 years at the Univer
sity of Michigan whose rivalry with
Ohio State is well-known. Incidents like
the one at Berkeley last Saturday were
handled in a simple, routine way. When
band members, fans etc. from both
sides enter the field while the game is
still going on, the play if nullified, the
field cleared and the play run over
again.
Athletic Director Andrew Geiger is
quoted as saying that we cannot appeal
the game. I can see that we cannot ap
peal the judgments of the officials even
though these were clearly outrageous.
But why can we not appeal to the
Pac-10, eliminate the results of the last
play, since the procedure outlined
above — and followed routinely in oth
er conferences — was not followed by
the officials?

Poor John El way
Poor John Elway. Those awful refer
ees forgot that they weren't supposed to
ruin his last game. Of course, to keep
him happy would have meant ruining
the last game for UC Berkeley's sen
iors, but then they're less important
4

than Big John. After all, for one thing
they go to a public school, right? And
Big John is such a star! 1 saw the replays
too, as did all the spartswriters I read on
Sunday, but 1 guess we're all wrong in
thinking The Play was illegal.
Instead of criticizing the refs for fail
ing to control the Stanford Band, Elway
should be grateful that the Band was
there to obscure the really relevant fact:
hfe teammates on the Stanford defense
had already been beaten, badly, by the
time the last Cal runner headed for the
end zone and into the crowd of red
jackets. Without the latter three, the
play would simply have been a glaring
embarrassment to the Stanford
coaching staff and kickoff team.
Having read the remarks by our sore
losers, I'm more relieved than ever that
we will not go to the Hall of Shame
Bowl. It was embarassing enough to be
subjected to Bowl Fever while watching
this team struggle for a non-losing rec
ord. No team with any self-respect
would accept such a post-season honor,
after having waited until its final game
to establish whether it would finish up
with such a record. Hearing Elway,
White et al. whining, I realize that self
respect would not have been much of a
hindrance to a bowl acceptance had
Stanford indeed won.
Let's admit that the Cal players who
pulled off The Play deserved the result
at least as much as the Stanford players
who pulled off their own improbable
series only a minute earlier. And let's
thank the Band for adding a colorful
twist to the proceedings.

Harwood response
As women of the Stanford communi
ty we are amazed by Ted Harwood's
presumption (Daily, Nov. 15) in defin
ing what constitutes the problem of
rape ("lower-income people and minor
ities are disproportionately more apt to
be involved") and the oppression of
women (not even old-fashioned male
chivalry could be more oppressive than
weak judges, parole board members
and others who share the collective guilt
about felons).
When conservative F B I. statistics
report that one out of every six women

will be raped, it becomes difficult for
students here to shrug their shoulders
and say that the problem does not relate
to them. This issue becomes more
salient still when we are confronted
with the fact that sexual violation of
women is equally common across race
and class lines (although as might be ex
pected, low-income white men and men
of color are most likely to be prosecuted
and incarcerated). Finally, since most
sexual assaults of women are per
petrated by men they know, and most
rapes are committed by men of the same
race as their victim, we must conclude
that "middle class" people have a
stronger connection to rape than un
founded feelings of guilt.
Although nothing provides an ins
tant "remedy" for the problem of rape,
we feel that the suggestions proposed by
the so-called "guiltists" are far from
"frivolous." Perhaps not all women
agree that they are hurt by rape jokes or
that it matters how men move around
the campus at night. Maybe not all
women believe that the world would be
a better place if men changed their fun
damental attitudes toward women.
These are, however, hardly frivolous
concerns to us and the hundreds of
women who have spoken of similar
concerns in dorm-based discussions of
'he videotape Working Against Rape.
Finally, we must address Hoover Fel
low Harwood's claim that aggressive,
militant terrorists, with "an emotional
stranglehold on the campus communi
ty" are operating at Stanford. Quite
simply, we find it baffling that a mild
and positive newspaper opinion piece
such as Jim Steyer and Mike
Calabrese's (Daily, Nov. 8) and a few
dorm discussions should elicit such fear
and anger.
Guilt isn't productive, but the "mili
tant," "terrorist" consciousness-raisers
don't want or encourage anyone's guilt.
Rather, they call only for self-examina
tion and constructive action toward so
cial change.

I am sorry I have to write this letter.
The Stanford football team's coaching
staff is supposedly a bunch of nice guys.
It's tough to deliver blows to nice guys.
But, there have been at least a half
dozen games over the last two years that
have made me want to write a letter in
dicting these nice guys.
Somehow, however, there was
always next week or next year to look
forward to. Unfortunately, I am a sen
ior now and there are no more next
weeks or next years in terms of watch
ing my classmates win football games.
An optimistic freshman who entered
expecting Rose Bowls has been con
verted to a cynical realist who expects
losses.
Indeed, the perfect motto for this
year's season would be that "there's
always a way to lose." By the end of the
season, I would just sit in the stands
waiting for our coaching staff to con
coct some way to lose the ball game. Re
member Arizona State and the prevent
defense that prevented victory? Or how
about USC and the last two minutes of
the first half when indecisiveness
(should we run the clock out or try to
score? — no, let's do neither) turned the
momentum and the game to USC. Per
haps the best (aside from the "Big
Farce") was the Arizona game — let's
let our great offense and St. John get us
ahead and then quit using them in the
third quarter.
Then, of course, there was the Big
Game, and the most costly error. How
can one blame the loss to Cal on the
coaches, many might ask? Why not
blame the refs, the band or God? What
everyone forgets is that the last play of
the game never should have taken
place. If we had waited six more sec
onds to call time out before Harmon's
field goal attempt, the clock would have
run out and there never would have
been the kickoff return controversy.
With the Stanford coaching staff, how
ever, "there's always a way to lose,"
and so time out was called with eight
seconds left rather than with two. The
only possible justification for calling
time out with eight seconds left is that if
the kick were blocked, another play
could be run; due to the fact that it was
our last time out, however, there is no
possibility that another play could have
been run.
Thus, what we have is a case of a

coach who panicked and in so doing
cost his team and his university the
game. Remember, too, that this was'not
just any game; aside from the fact that it
was the Big Game, and all kinds of
pride was on the line, the Cardinal was
also playing for a bowl bid which would
mean hundreds of thousands of dollars
to the University. Indeed, one can say
that this coaching blunder was literally
a very costly one. Six more ticks of the
clock before calling time out and Stan
ford would have had a winning season
and been headed to the Hall of Fame
Bowl, thus gaining further positive na
tional experience and boosting future
recruiting possibilities. Instead, time
out was called with eight seconds left,
and Stanford football became a na

Appeal last play
Prior to coming to Stanford 14 years
ago I taught for 10 years at the Univer
sity of Michigan whose rivalry with
Ohio State is well-known. Incidents like
the one at Berkeley last Saturday were
handled in a simple, routine way. When
band members, fans etc. from both
sides enter the field while the game is
still going on, the play if nullified, the
field cleared and the play run over
again.
Athletic Director Andrew Geiger is
quoted as saying that we cannot appeal
the game. I can see that we cannot ap
peal the judgments of the officials even
though these were clearly outrageous.
But why can we not appeal to the
Pac-10, eliminate the results of the last
play, since the procedure outlined
above — and followed routinely in oth
er conferences — was not followed by
the officials?

Poor John El way
Poor John Elway. Those awful refer

ruin his last game. Of course, to keep
him happy would have meant ruining
the last game for UC Berkeley's sen

4

than Big John. After all, for one thing
they go to a public school, right? And
Big John is such a star! 1 saw the replays
too, as did all the spartswriters I read on
Sunday, but 1 guess we're all wrong in
thinking The Play was illegal.
Instead of criticizing the refs for fail
ing to control the Stanford Band, Elway
should be grateful that the Band was
there to obscure the really relevant fact:
hfe teammates on the Stanford defense
had already been beaten, badly, by the
time the last Cal runner headed for the
end zone and into the crowd of red
jackets. Without the latter three, the
play would simply have been a glaring
embarrassment to the Stanford
coaching staff and kickoff team.
Having read the remarks by our sore
losers, I'm more relieved than ever that
we will not go to the Hall of Shame
Bowl. It was embarassing enough to be
subjected to Bowl Fever while watching
this team struggle for a non-losing rec
ord. No team with any self-respect
would accept such a post-season honor,
after having waited until its final game
to establish whether it would finish up
with such a record. Hearing Elway,
White et al. whining, I realize that self
respect would not have been much of a
hindrance to a bowl acceptance had
Stanford indeed won.
Let's admit that the Cal players who
pulled off The Play deserved the result
at least as much as the Stanford players
who pulled off their own improbable
series only a minute earlier. And let's
thank the Band for adding a colorful
twist to the proceedings.

Harwood response
As women of the Stanford communi

presumption (Daily, Nov. 15) in defin
ing what constitutes the problem of
rape ("lower-income people and minor

be involved") and the oppression of
women (not even old-fashioned male
chivalry could be more oppressive than
weak judges, parole board members
and others who share the collective guilt
about felons).

Big John is such a star! 1 saw the replays
too, as did all the spartswriters I read on
Sunday, but 1 guess we're all wrong in
thinking The Play was illegal.
Instead of criticizing the refs for fail
ing to control the Stanford Band, Elway
should be grateful that the Band was
there to obscure the really relevant fact:
hfe teammates on the Stanford defense
had already been beaten, badly, by the
time the last Cal runner headed for the
end zone and into the crowd of red
jackets. Without the latter three, the
play would simply have been a glaring
embarrassment to the Stanford
coaching staff and kickoff team.
Having read the remarks by our sore
losers, I'm more relieved than ever that
we will not go to the Hall of Shame
Bowl. It was embarassing enough to be
subjected to Bowl Fever while watching
this team struggle for a non-losing rec
ord. No team with any self-respect
would accept such a post-season honor,
after having waited until its final game
to establish whether it would finish up
with such a record. Hearing Elway,
White et al. whining, I realize that self
respect would not have been much of a
hindrance to a bowl acceptance had
Stanford indeed won.
Let's admit that the Cal players who
pulled off The Play deserved the result
at least as much as the Stanford players
who pulled off their own improbable
series only a minute earlier. And let's
thank the Band for adding a colorful
twist to the proceedings.

Harwood response
As women of the Stanford communi
ty we are amazed by Ted Harwood's
presumption (Daily, Nov. 15) in defin
ing what constitutes the problem of
rape ("lower-income people and minor
ities are disproportionately more apt to
be involved") and the oppression of
women (not even old-fashioned male
chivalry could be more oppressive than
weak judges, parole board members
and others who share the collective guilt
about felons).
When conservative F B I. statistics
report that one out of every six women

will be raped, it becomes difficult for
students here to shrug their shoulders
and say that the problem does not relate
to them. This issue becomes more
salient still when we are confronted
with the fact that sexual violation of
women is equally common across race
and class lines (although as might be ex
pected, low-income white men and men
of color are most likely to be prosecuted
and incarcerated). Finally, since most
sexual assaults of women are per
petrated by men they know, and most
rapes are committed by men of the same
race as their victim, we must conclude
that "middle class" people have a
stronger connection to rape than un
founded feelings of guilt.
Although nothing provides an ins
tant "remedy" for the problem of rape,
we feel that the suggestions proposed by
the so-called "guiltists" are far from
"frivolous." Perhaps not all women
agree that they are hurt by rape jokes or
that it matters how men move around
the campus at night. Maybe not all
women believe that the world would be
a better place if men changed their fun
damental attitudes toward women.
These are, however, hardly frivolous
concerns to us and the hundreds of
women who have spoken of similar
concerns in dorm-based discussions of
'he videotape Working Against Rape.
Finally, we must address Hoover Fel
low Harwood's claim that aggressive,
militant terrorists, with "an emotional
stranglehold on the campus communi
ty" are operating at Stanford. Quite
simply, we find it baffling that a mild
and positive newspaper opinion piece
such as Jim Steyer and Mike
Calabrese's (Daily, Nov. 8) and a few
dorm discussions should elicit such fear
and anger.
Guilt isn't productive, but the "mili
tant," "terrorist" consciousness-raisers
don't want or encourage anyone's guilt.
Rather, they call only for self-examina
tion and constructive action toward so
cial change.

I am sorry I have to write this letter.
The Stanford football team's coaching
staff is supposedly a bunch of nice guys.
It's tough to deliver blows to nice guys.
But, there have been at least a half
dozen games over the last two years that
have made me want to write a letter in
dicting these nice guys.
Somehow, however, there was
always next week or next year to look
forward to. Unfortunately, I am a sen
ior now and there are no more next
weeks or next years in terms of watch
ing my classmates win football games.
An optimistic freshman who entered
expecting Rose Bowls has been con
verted to a cynical realist who expects
losses.
Indeed, the perfect motto for this
year's season would be that "there's
always a way to lose." By the end of the
season, I would just sit in the stands
waiting for our coaching staff to con
coct some way to lose the ball game. Re
member Arizona State and the prevent
defense that prevented victory? Or how
about USC and the last two minutes of
the first half when indecisiveness
(should we run the clock out or try to
score? — no, let's do neither) turned the
momentum and the game to USC. Per
haps the best (aside from the "Big
Farce") was the Arizona game — let's
let our great offense and St. John get us
ahead and then quit using them in the
third quarter.
Then, of course, there was the Big
Game, and the most costly error. How
can one blame the loss to Cal on the
coaches, many might ask? Why not
blame the refs, the band or God? What
everyone forgets is that the last play of
the game never should have taken
place. If we had waited six more sec
onds to call time out before Harmon's
field goal attempt, the clock would have
run out and there never would have
been the kickoff return controversy.
With the Stanford coaching staff, how
ever, "there's always a way to lose,"
and so time out was called with eight
seconds left rather than with two. The
only possible justification for calling
time out with eight seconds left is that if
the kick were blocked, another play
could be run; due to the fact that it was
our last time out, however, there is no
possibility that another play could have
been run.
Thus, what we have is a case of a

coach who panicked and in so doing
cost his team and his university the
game. Remember, too, that this was'not
just any game; aside from the fact that it
was the Big Game, and all kinds of
pride was on the line, the Cardinal was
also playing for a bowl bid which would
mean hundreds of thousands of dollars
to the University. Indeed, one can say
that this coaching blunder was literally
a very costly one. Six more ticks of the
clock before calling time out and Stan
ford would have had a winning season
and been headed to the Hall of Fame
Bowl, thus gaining further positive na
tional experience and boosting future
recruiting possibilities. Instead, time
out was called with eight seconds left,
and Stanford football became a na
tional joke.

Appeal last play
Prior to coming to Stanford 14 years
ago I taught for 10 years at the Univer
sity of Michigan whose rivalry with
Ohio State is well-known. Incidents like
the one at Berkeley last Saturday were
handled in a simple, routine way. When
band members, fans etc. from both
sides enter the field while the game is
still going on, the play if nullified, the
field cleared and the play run over
again.
Athletic Director Andrew Geiger is
quoted as saying that we cannot appeal
the game. I can see that we cannot ap
peal the judgments of the officials even
though these were clearly outrageous.
But why can we not appeal to the
Pac-10, eliminate the results of the last
play, since the procedure outlined
above — and followed routinely in oth
er conferences — was not followed by
the officials?

Poor John El way
Poor John Elway. Those awful refer
ees forgot that they weren't supposed to
ruin his last game. Of course, to keep
him happy would have meant ruining
the last game for UC Berkeley's sen
iors, but then they're less important

than Big John. After all, for one thing
they go to a public school, right? And
Big John is such a star! 1 saw the replays
