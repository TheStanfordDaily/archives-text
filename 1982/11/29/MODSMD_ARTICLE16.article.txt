## 'Meâ€™ generation and predecessors 
### 
The news media and the scholarly
community, as keepers of American
history, mark every generation of youth
with a catch-phrase intended to sum up
the formative influences of each partic
ular era: the "wartime" generation
(19405), the "silent" generation (19505)
and the "Vietnam" generation (19605).
While the dividing lines are not
always clear-cut, we can safely say that
the '60s methods had faded out by the
early 1970s with the de-escalation of the
war in Vietnam, the first oil crisis and
the Watergate scandal.
Those of us entering adolescence af
ter these events moved into a new
epoch: the early 1970s to the present.
This period, which is now coming to
a close, is our generation.
Because of popular phraseology, our
young lives seem destined to bear the
name: the "me" generation, inspired by
a series of books appearing during our
time on self-help and "looking out for
number one." In the press, we have
been characterized as conservative,
apathetic, self-centered and even mon
ey-grubbing.
In this an accurate portrayal of our
generation? Obviously, like other gen
erational caricatures, it is both too con
venient and too simple. Older gener
ations are often quick to condemn us,
yet pitifully slow to understand us. Not
enough attention has been devoted to

the world images that shaped our lives
and from which we drew our own val
ues and conclusions.
When we began to look at the "out
side world," the Kennedys and Martin
Luther King were already dead, flower
children were going to work and we sat
in a gas line with one of our parents
before school. The role model of the
president was in shambles, the Beatles
had broken up, and inflation meant
that we probably weren't going to see
another man (much less a woman) on
the moon.
All the drugs had been tested, all sex
ual persuasions and position tried and
all philosophies discredited. Perhaps we
had good reason to believe Don
McLean when he sang: "Bye, bye, Miss
American Pie/ Drove my Chevy to the
levee/ but the levee was dry."
Our first-elected president was Jim
my Carter, who tried hard to restore
our faith in government and the cause
of right. But his religion couldn't solve
stagflation and we could only enjoy
with sour American pride the grain em
bargo and the solidarity which we felt
for our hostages in Iran. While Ameri
cans had performed successfully in Ger
many in 1936, we weren't allowed to go
to Moscow for the Olympics. Had the
invasion of Afghanistan caused our
country to lose faith in itself?
But, there was some fun. There was
the beat of disco music (and"I hate dis
co" buttons), toga parties and the in
spiring Rocky movies. We had a grain
surplus and there was always food in
the supermakets, the draft was over and
we could looking forward to voting at
18. At the same time, major social issues
had already been raised and either set
tled successfully or dropped because
people were tired of instability and
change. We never took to the streets to
gether.
The economy continued to moan. In
1980, we listened to an old man's song
and dance: American pride, a bigger
military and balanced budget. Actually,
our parents mostly listened as they
thought about how to get us through
college in the face of yet another re
cession. We watched in amazement as
Nancy Reagan's decorators and the

others of the New Right "blessed,"
Rev. Falwell and Saint Phyllis Schlafly
(may the ERA R.1.P.), moved into the
White House.
Some of us took heart in the excite
ment and searching lyrics of new wave
music. Others watched the Royal Wed
ding and sought solace in different
hopes and dreams.
Perhaps it was because we were
raised to view our leaders cynically, or
perhaps it was because we never had
faith in the economy. Whatever the rea
son, the lessons of our youth have
enabled us now in 1982 to deal with the
failure of the Reagan plan and the
highest unemployment rate since the
Great Depression.
The political disillusionments of the
1970s and the fact that we are the first
generation to suffer the energy crisis
and a solid decade of economic woes
have taught us to look inward. Perhaps
we are studying more. Perhaps our po
litical actions are less well-advertised.
But, the problems we face are different
from those of our "60s predecessors, so
we have had to adopt different means.
We are not without our causes: the
anti-nuclear arms movement, gun con
trol and opposition to Interior Secre
tary James Watt's moves on our en
vironment. Instead of mass demonstra
tion, however, we have acted primarily
in the ballot booth: we vote overwhelm
ingly in favor of California's
progressive propositions. Thus, al
though our style is perhaps conserva
tive, its end point is not. We have
learned something from the past.
If we are to be known as the "me"
generation, those social and economic
forces of the '70s and early '80s that
brought us to that label must be
reckoned with. Youth can only react to
the conditions it faces and we are no ex
ception.
We have not chosen our place in
time. Rather, like other generations, we
have tried to adapt to and improve that
which we inherited. If our philosophies
and methods are different from past
generations, so be it.
