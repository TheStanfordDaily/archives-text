# The 						best of college humor — with a Stanford accent
## 
### KAREN SPRINGEN 
Contrary to the looks of The
New York Times Bestseller List,
Garfield books do not hold a
monopoly on the humor market.
But who compiles these other hu
mor books . . . Stanford grads?
Sometimes. Former Chaparral
editor Bruce Handy, a member of
the class of '81, is a contributing
editor of Hellbent on Insanity, a
compilation, published last
month, of college humor of the
'70s and '80s.
Hellbent on Insanity, subtitled
"A Rollercoaster Ride with the
Best College Humor of the 1970s
(and a Smattering from the 1980s
While Your Back Was Turned),"
shows students jamming into a
telephone booth on the cover.

*College humor has
never been anything
but disrespect for
authority 9

The book is dedicated "To
mom and dad" — the first and
last all-American statement it
makes. Chapter titles range from
"Sex, Drugs and Bowling" to
"The Florence Henderson Gen
eration" to "Fun with
Carcinogens."
Handy said "a big-time New
York publisher" — Holt,
Rhineholt and Winston — took a
chance on the newcomers, editor
Joey Green, Alan Corcoran and
himself.
The publishing company, re
cently well-known for The G-
Spot, printed a first press run of
about 30,000, Handy said.
The two other editors are Cor
nell grads. Handy said that as a
result, the book concentrates
heavily on Stanford Chaparral
and Cornell Lunatic humor.
Sources of humor magazine ex
cerpts include the Pennsylvania
Punchbowl, the MIT Voodoo, the
Princeton Tiger, the NYU Plague
and Berkeley's Californian
Pelican.
Chris Walters, the current edi

tor of the Chaparral, said Stan
ford material comprises about 25
percent of the book. "None of it
is Harvard Lampoon," he added.
One page is a Cornell Lunatic
take-off on Highlights, "the
monthly book for dentists' of
fices with the same cover every
month . . . fun if you can't read."

Chapter titles range
from "Sex, Drugs and
Bowling**to "The
Florence Henderson
Generation"to "Fun
with Carcinogens."

A Chaparral entry, "How to
Definitely Pick up Women," ad
vises dating women under 10 and
over 90 rather than pretty girls
who are "trouble." When dating
a girl under 10, "insist on her call
ing you 'Uncle' in public." And
remember, "the key to having
fun with a 'sexy senior citizen' is
optimism.''''
Another 1980 Chaparral entry,
"Borealis, A Men's Newspaper
for the Stanford Community,"
spoofs the feminist newspaper
Aurora. The parody includes an
article, "Baldness: the male
burden" and a reference to
"crimes against men."

The book is dedicated
"to mom and dad"—
'the first and last
all-American
statement it makes.

According to the introduction,
"college humor has never been
anything but a disrespect for au
thority, a love for the outlandish
and a preoccupation with sex." It
referred to the ChaparraFs spring
1981 cover story, "Who Shot
RR?" which went on sale one
hour before the assassination at
tempt on the president.
But enough about the book —
what about Handy? "About the
authors" described him as fol
lows: "Artist Bruce Handy was
born in Palo Alto, California,

and could have become a Rhodes
Scholar had he not been editor of
the Stanford Chaparral. He grad
uated in 1981 arid now lives in
New York, where he works at
Vogue magazine opening the
mail and appropriating all the
free passes to movie screenings."
Handy, who really does work
full-time for Vogue in New York
(on the section "People are talk
ing about. . . ) drew several of the
cartoons in the book.
He said plans may include
writing a children's book.

But he cited drawbacks: "Pub
lishing is doing so poorly right
now ... I think they (publishing
employees) even have to buy
their own pencils." He said, how
ever, "A lot of people are getting
breaks."
The softcover book retails for
$9.95.

New York Times Bestseller List,
Garfield books do not hold a
monopoly on the humor market.
But who compiles these other hu
mor books . . . Stanford grads?
Sometimes. Former Chaparral
editor Bruce Handy, a member of
the class of '81, is a contributing
editor of Hellbent on Insanity, a
compilation, published last
month, of college humor of the
'70s and '80s.
Hellbent on Insanity, subtitled
"A Rollercoaster Ride with the
Best College Humor of the 1970s
(and a Smattering from the 1980s
While Your Back Was Turned),"
shows students jamming into a
telephone booth on the cover.

*College humor has
never been anything
but disrespect for
authority 9

The book is dedicated "To
mom and dad" — the first and
last all-American statement it
makes. Chapter titles range from
"Sex, Drugs and Bowling" to
"The Florence Henderson Gen
eration" to "Fun with
Carcinogens."
Handy said "a big-time New
York publisher" — Holt,
Rhineholt and Winston — took a
chance on the newcomers, editor
Joey Green, Alan Corcoran and
himself.
The publishing company, re
cently well-known for The G-
Spot, printed a first press run of
about 30,000, Handy said.
The two other editors are Cor
nell grads. Handy said that as a
result, the book concentrates
heavily on Stanford Chaparral
and Cornell Lunatic humor.
Sources of humor magazine ex
cerpts include the Pennsylvania
Punchbowl, the MIT Voodoo, the
Princeton Tiger, the NYU Plague
and Berkeley's Californian
Pelican.
Chris Walters, the current edi

tor of the Chaparral, said Stan
ford material comprises about 25
percent of the book. "None of it
is Harvard Lampoon," he added.
One page is a Cornell Lunatic
take-off on Highlights, "the
monthly book for dentists' of
fices with the same cover every
month . . . fun if you can't read."

Chapter titles range
from "Sex, Drugs and
Bowling**to "The
Florence Henderson
Generation"to "Fun
with Carcinogens."

A Chaparral entry, "How to
Definitely Pick up Women," ad
vises dating women under 10 and
over 90 rather than pretty girls
who are "trouble." When dating
a girl under 10, "insist on her call
ing you 'Uncle' in public." And
remember, "the key to having
fun with a 'sexy senior citizen' is
optimism.''''
Another 1980 Chaparral entry,
"Borealis, A Men's Newspaper
for the Stanford Community,"
spoofs the feminist newspaper
Aurora. The parody includes an
article, "Baldness: the male
burden" and a reference to
"crimes against men."

The book is dedicated
"to mom and dad"—
'the first and last
all-American
statement it makes.

According to the introduction,
"college humor has never been
anything but a disrespect for au
thority, a love for the outlandish
and a preoccupation with sex." It
referred to the ChaparraFs spring
1981 cover story, "Who Shot
RR?" which went on sale one
hour before the assassination at
tempt on the president.
But enough about the book —
what about Handy? "About the
authors" described him as fol
lows: "Artist Bruce Handy was
born in Palo Alto, California,

and could have become a Rhodes
Scholar had he not been editor of
the Stanford Chaparral. He grad
uated in 1981 arid now lives in
New York, where he works at
Vogue magazine opening the
mail and appropriating all the
free passes to movie screenings."
Handy, who really does work
full-time for Vogue in New York
(on the section "People are talk
ing about. . . ) drew several of the
cartoons in the book.
He said plans may include
writing a children's book.

But he cited drawbacks: "Pub
lishing is doing so poorly right
now ... I think they (publishing
employees) even have to buy
their own pencils." He said, how
ever, "A lot of people are getting
breaks."
The softcover book retails for
$9.95.
