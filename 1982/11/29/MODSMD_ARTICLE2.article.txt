# More ASSU budget woes
## $15,000 boathouse deficit seen 
### DAVID SANCHEZ Staff writer 
The ASSU and the Dean of Student Affairs Office
(DOSA) have projected a tentative worst-case deficit of
$15,000 to SIB,OOO for the ASSU services provided at the
Lake Lagunita boathouse, according to Margaret Fidler, as
sistant administrative dean for student affairs.
Fidler said that this shortfall was anticipated, because the
ASSU did not place the boathouse on the fee assessment
ballot last spring, and because the University did not include
the boathouse in its budget. The DOSA and the ASSU will
now have to search for funds to cover the deficit, according
to Fidler.
To help cover the projected deficit, the ASSU may have to
tap a special $15,000 reserve which is earmarked for "un
usual" ASSU budget problems, said Fidler. She noted, how
ever, that the fund may also be needed to cover the ASSIJ's
expected $11,000 shortfall which includes neither the
boathouse deficit nor the predicted ASSU Recycling lossses
of about $ 16,000. Council of Presidents (COP) member Cyn
thia Mathewson said the reserve fund would not be enough
to cover the boathouse deficit and the ASSU operating
budget shortfall.
In order to generate other sources of funding, Fidler said
that the DOSA would have to see what it "could come up
with," and that beyond that, it would "ask the president's
and provost's office to help."
Tentative budgets for the boathouse have been established
for this and the next few years. In the current budget the
ASSU and the DOSA have reached tentative agreements
about what percentage of the deficit will be covered by the
University and what percentage will be covered by the
ASSU, according to Fidler.
"It's still tentative," Fidler said, and there's still a little bit

more work that needs to be done, particularly in the area of
just being sure we've got the right level of lifeguarding."
"The University has always contributed some to this (the
boathouse) through the ASSU," Fidler said. "What (the
University) contributed was generally enough to cover a
lower level of lifeguarding at that time than what is felt now
to be a good idea."
A few years ago, according to Fidler, the ASSU wanted
to expand the level of programming and lifeguard services
provided at the boathouse. To achieve this goal, fee
assessments were placed on the ballot for several years, while
the University's contribution to the facility did not signifi
cantly increase. Recently the ASSU has asked that the Uni
versity fund a larger portion of the boathouse budget.
Fidler said that the boathouse will again be included in the
University budget next year.
The University did not include the boathouse in this year's
budget because the ASSU task force formed to determine
what the Lake Lagunita annual safety budget should be had
not reached any conclusions in time for the Universiy's
budgeting process, according to Fidler. Since the University
did not budget for the boathouse, the DOSA, which still had
to fulfill its part of the deficit, knew that it "would have to be
scrambling for some funds this year."
Fidler explained that the worst-case deficit assumes that a
maximum amount of staffing and lifeguarding will be
needed at Lake Lagunita, and that a $7000 boathouse bill
recently received from the University is immediately due and
payable. The ASSU is currently investigating this bill, ac
cording to Fidler.
Fidler noted that in addition to lifeguarding, which is the
largest item on the boathouse budget, other boathouse costs
include operating costs such as utilities, phone service and

vices such as lifeguarding may have to be reduced, and
badly needed repairs may be postponed. New sources of
revenue must be found, because tne ASSU budget is al
ready projected to be $11,000 in the red.
