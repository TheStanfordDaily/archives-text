## Poloists come up one game short in bid for national title 
### CHRIS ADDINGTON 
The NCAA water polo seeding
committee did a perfect job in
pre-tourney selection as No. 2-
ranked Stanford finished in sec
ond place behind No. 1-ranked
UC-lrvine at the national cham
pionships last night in Long
Beach.
Irvine, which had not won the
tournament since 1970, handily
defeated the Cardinal by a score
of 7-4 before a capacity crowd at
the Belmont Plaza Natatorium.
"We had real problems getting
the ball in the goal," said Stan
ford assistant coach Jody
Campbell. "UCI certainly de
served to win."
Stanford reached the cham
pionship match by slipping by
Loyola-Chicago in the opening
round 13-10, and UCLA in the
semi-final match 11-9. The Ant
eaters cruised by Brown 14-2 and
UC-Berkeley 8-5 to reach the
final game.
Both teams started off the
match rather tentatively, trading
goals until the score stood at 3-3
late in the second period. From
that time on UCI, which had
beaten Stanford three times in
regular season play, never looked
back.
Quick goals by John Vargas
and Diggy Reily on a man-ad
vantage situation put the Ant
eaters up by two at halftime. Rei
ly scored again early in the third
quarter on a Kirk Jensen ejection

and the Anteaters led by three.
Stanford's James Bergeson
tried to fuel up a Cardinal come
back scoring off a drive to bring
Stanford within two, and with 26
seconds to play in the period and
a UCI player ejected it looked
like the Cardinal was back in the
game.
Stanford, however, failed to
convert its man-up situation and
Irvine responded early in the
fourth quarter with a Jeff
Campbell tally which proved to
be the game's final goal.
"I really felt we could have
turned the game around in the
third quarter," said three time
All-America Bergeson. "Irvine
certainly played good defense."
That defense held off five
minutes of fourth quarter Stan
ford desperation to clinch the ti
tle. The Cardinal had two more
man-up situations and fired a to
tal of seven shots in the fourth
quarter to no avail. The clock
ticked away and the Irvine de
fense held until the final gun.
"They were really physical and
took us to the hilt," said Cardinal
Curtis Hanst after the game.
However described, UCI fin
ished the season with a perfect
30-0 record becoming only the
third team in NCAA water polo
history to finish a season un
defeated. Stanford was the sec
ond team to do it last year.
Perhaps a real key to the
game's final outcome was the
play of each team during man-

advantage situations. Stanford
had the opportunity three times
but was thwarted on every one by
UCI goalkeeper John O'Brien or
its own inaccurate shooting.
Irvine found the net on all three
of its opportunities giving them
the three-goal margin of victory.
Rounding out the scoring for
the Cardinal was Bergeson with
two and John Tanner with two.
Reily led the Anteaters connect
ing on three shots, while team
mates Jeff Campbell had two,
Trevor Dodson one, and John
Vargas one.
Stanford's semi-final game
against UCLA was equally excit
ing as sophomore Tom Lampert
scored five times and the Card
defense held off a late fourth
quarter Bruin surge to preserve
the victory. UCLA found its way
into the semi-finals by defeating
UC-Santa Barbara 8-6 in the
opening round.
In a game that almost paral
leled the final through the first
half, UCLA and Stanford fought
to a 3-3 tie in the second period.
The Cardinal blazed ahead on
two goals by Jeff Stiling and one
by Lampert.
A dominating third quarter by
Stanford with goals coming from
Jensen, Lampert and Bergeson
gave the Cardinal a 10-5 lead at
the end of three periods of play.
The Bruins scored three un
answered goals in the fourth peri
od before Lampert found the
mark for his fifth goal to halt the

UCLA advance and secure the
victory.
"We were ready for an emo
tional game," said Card coach
Campbell. "We wanted to play
good defense and stick them ear
ly in the game."
UCLA went on to clinch third
place in a come-from-behind vic
tory over Berkeley. The winning
goal came in the last eight sec
onds of play to give the Bruins a
10-9 win.
Perhaps Stanford's defeat sig
nals the end of a water polo
dynasty. Since 1976, after being
cellar dwellers in NCAA water
polo action, the Cardinal has
captured four national titles ('76,
'78, '80, '81) and two third place
finishes ('77, '79).
Stanford head coach Dante
Dettamanti has recruited and
coached such greats as John
Gansel, Vince Vanelli, Chris
Kelsey, Alan Mouchawar,
Campbell and Bergeson.
The Cardinal will lose five
starting seniors to graduation
next year, certainly hurting its
chances for a repeat appearance
in the NCAA finals.
However, these predictions
have been made before. Last
year's squad had five starters
leave and this year's team was
never a pre-season favorite for
the NCAAs.
In the words of Hanst, who will
be one of the Cardinal players re
turning, "I thought it was a good
season."

FALLING JUST SHORT: Stanford's Kirk Jensen, shown here in the Cardinal's opening round
13-10 win over Loyola of Chicago, and his teammates fell to No. 1-ranked UC-Irvine last night
in Long Beach by a score of 7-4 in the NCAA championship match. It marked the seventh straight
year that Stanford has finished among the top three teams in the nation.
