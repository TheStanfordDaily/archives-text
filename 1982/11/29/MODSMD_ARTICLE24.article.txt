# Ramee ties assist record as Card opens season with win
## 
### SID SPAETH 
Freshman guard Keith Ramee
handed out a record-tying 10 as
sists off penetrating drives to the
basket and center John Revelli
scored 20 points Saturday to lead
Stanford to a 84-71 opening
game win over UC-Riverside.
The game, marking the debut
of coach Tom Davis, was close
until forward Hans Wichary led a
Stanford surge midway through

the second-half and the Cardinal
pulled away for the win.
"I was never confident (that we
had won)," Davis said. "I knew it
was up for grabs. Our inex
perience was evident against
them and they exploited us every
time we showed a weakness."
Stanford trailed 48-46 at half
time, but began trading leads ear-
Iv in the second half of the sloppi

lv-plaved contest in which Stan
ford out-erred Riverside 25-24 in
turnovers.
The Cardinal grabbed the lead
for good with 12 minutes remain
ing.
Ramee started another pierc
ing drive that collapsed four Riv
erside players inside. Instead of
passing the ball sideways in the
congestion, he neatly slipped it
back to Wichary who netted a
soft jumper from just inside the
free-throw line for a 59-58 lead.
Two drives later Stanford had
five more unanswered points.
Guard Keith Jones drove the
middle and sank a lay-up as he
was fouled by Dave Freeman.
Jones converted the three-point
plav and moments fater Wichary
was flying through the lane
again, converting the drive, but
fouling after the shot.
The sudden six-point lead was
all Stanford needed as Davis's
merry-go-round substituting
paid off. .
"We did what we're going to
have to do," said Ramee, who
tied Mike Bratz's and Paul
Giovacchini's Stanford record
for 10 assists in one game. "We
have to keep wearing them down
with fresh substitutions. We're
not going to run out ahead of
anyone by 20 points so we're
going to have to stay fresh with

coach Davis's substitutions sys
tem."
Revelli's 20 points led all
scorers. Stanford hit 70 percent
of their shots in the second half
and 63 percent for the game, but
defensively, Davis saw some
weaknesses.
"We just have to be happy with
every win," Davis said. "We
don't want to get down on our
players. We have to look at it
from the standpoint that we are
only going to get better. Every
game we get under our belts, I
think you are going to see
progress."
Wicharv, who is still recover
ing from a foot injury and did not
play organized basketball all
summer, scored eight of his 10
points in the second half.
Jones scored 14 points and
freshmen Ramee and Andy Fis
cher had 11 each.
Riverside was led by Uiki
Niko's 14 points. Niko sank his
first four long jumpers as Riv
erside jumped out to a 8-6 lead
barely three and one-half
minutes into the game, but put up
only two more shots in the half as
Stanford's aggressive defense
began to harass Riverside's long
shooters outside.
Sixty-five foul shots were
taken in the the whistle-plagued
game. Stanford scored 32 points

from the foul line, but only Stan
ford's Fischer and Riverside's
James Fontenette and Niko
fouled out in the free-substituting
game. ...
"Both he (Fischer) and Kobine
(freshman forward Earl
Koberlein) showed signs of being
freshmen," Davis said. "We have
some growing pains to overcome,
but 1 was happy with a lot of
things they did.
"We're very happy with
Ramee. When we review the
films I'm sure we'll see that he
made some mistakes, but he's a
very intelligent player and will
get more intelligent as the year
goes along."
Ramee tributed his assist rec
ord to Davis and the Stanford of
fense. He played a similar role on
a talented, free-wheeling St.
Bernard High School team in
Playa del Rev.
"That (the record) is a tribute
to coach Davis and his pick-up
style of play," Ramee said. "It's a
tribute to the whole team because
those are the guys who have to
score when I get them the ball.
This is a really great team. There
is no real star, except John Revel
li, and we're going to win with
eight guvs."
Stanford hosts Sonoma State
tomorrow night at 8 p.m. in
Maples Pavilion.

handed out a record-tying 10 as
sists off penetrating drives to the
basket and center John Revelli
scored 20 points Saturday to lead
Stanford to a 84-71 opening
game win over UC-Riverside.
The game, marking the debut
of coach Tom Davis, was close
until forward Hans Wichary led a
Stanford surge midway through

the second-half and the Cardinal
pulled away for the win.
"I was never confident (that we
had won)," Davis said. "I knew it
was up for grabs. Our inex
perience was evident against
them and they exploited us every
time we showed a weakness."
Stanford trailed 48-46 at half
time, but began trading leads ear-
Iv in the second half of the sloppi

lv-plaved contest in which Stan
ford out-erred Riverside 25-24 in
turnovers.
The Cardinal grabbed the lead
for good with 12 minutes remain
ing.
Ramee started another pierc
ing drive that collapsed four Riv
erside players inside. Instead of
passing the ball sideways in the
congestion, he neatly slipped it
back to Wichary who netted a
soft jumper from just inside the
free-throw line for a 59-58 lead.
Two drives later Stanford had
five more unanswered points.
Guard Keith Jones drove the
middle and sank a lay-up as he
was fouled by Dave Freeman.
Jones converted the three-point
plav and moments fater Wichary
was flying through the lane
again, converting the drive, but
fouling after the shot.
The sudden six-point lead was
all Stanford needed as Davis's
merry-go-round substituting
paid off. .
"We did what we're going to
have to do," said Ramee, who
tied Mike Bratz's and Paul
Giovacchini's Stanford record
for 10 assists in one game. "We
have to keep wearing them down
with fresh substitutions. We're
not going to run out ahead of
anyone by 20 points so we're
going to have to stay fresh with

coach Davis's substitutions sys
tem."
Revelli's 20 points led all
scorers. Stanford hit 70 percent
of their shots in the second half
and 63 percent for the game, but
defensively, Davis saw some
weaknesses.
"We just have to be happy with
every win," Davis said. "We
don't want to get down on our
players. We have to look at it
from the standpoint that we are
only going to get better. Every
game we get under our belts, I
think you are going to see
progress."
Wicharv, who is still recover
ing from a foot injury and did not
play organized basketball all
summer, scored eight of his 10
points in the second half.
Jones scored 14 points and
freshmen Ramee and Andy Fis
cher had 11 each.
Riverside was led by Uiki
Niko's 14 points. Niko sank his
first four long jumpers as Riv
erside jumped out to a 8-6 lead
barely three and one-half
minutes into the game, but put up
only two more shots in the half as
Stanford's aggressive defense
began to harass Riverside's long
shooters outside.
Sixty-five foul shots were
taken in the the whistle-plagued
game. Stanford scored 32 points

from the foul line, but only Stan
ford's Fischer and Riverside's
James Fontenette and Niko
fouled out in the free-substituting
game. ...
"Both he (Fischer) and Kobine
(freshman forward Earl
Koberlein) showed signs of being
freshmen," Davis said. "We have
some growing pains to overcome,
but 1 was happy with a lot of
things they did.
"We're very happy with
Ramee. When we review the
films I'm sure we'll see that he
made some mistakes, but he's a
very intelligent player and will
get more intelligent as the year
goes along."
Ramee tributed his assist rec
ord to Davis and the Stanford of
fense. He played a similar role on
a talented, free-wheeling St.
Bernard High School team in
Playa del Rev.
"That (the record) is a tribute
to coach Davis and his pick-up
style of play," Ramee said. "It's a
tribute to the whole team because
those are the guys who have to
score when I get them the ball.
This is a really great team. There
is no real star, except John Revel
li, and we're going to win with
eight guvs."
Stanford hosts Sonoma State
tomorrow night at 8 p.m. in
Maples Pavilion.
