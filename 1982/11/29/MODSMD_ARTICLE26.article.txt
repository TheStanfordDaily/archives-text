### LIBBY LEONARD 
The Stanford women's basketball team picked up its third win yes
terday, beating Northwestern 76-63 in a sharp-shooting contest at
Maples Pavilion.
It was a battle of hot hands as both teams consistently connected on
their field goal attempts. The Card shot a blistering 61 percent from
the field, while Riverside hit on 56 percent of its shots.
The game remained close throughout the first half. Freshman Vir
ginia Sourlis dazzled the crowd when she sunk a midcourt shot at the
buzzer to give Stanford a 40-37 halftime lead.
The Cardinal took charge in the second half, tightened up its zone
defense, and built a 14-point lead. Senior Jeanne Hoff felt the team's
combined defensive effort in the second half was the key in giving the
Cardinal an edge. "In the first half, we weren't communicating in our
zone," said Hoff. "We would switch defenses, and we didn't know
what each of us was doing."
Stanford started talking and kept on shooting in the second half,
although a lull in the Cardinal's concentration allowed Northwestern
to creep back into the game.
Down the stretch, the Card managed to stifle Northwestern's surge.
Senior Angie Paccione found her outside touch in the final period to
help Stanford hold on for the win.
Stanford suffered a heart-breaking 87-85 overtime loss to it Califor
nia Friday night in Berkeley.
The Card got off to a slow start, falling behind by 14 early in the first
half, but clawed its way back into the game. A game of catch-up
turned into a lead for Stanford as it gained a six-point advantage after
intermission.
That lead diminished as the taller Berkeley squad outmuscled and
outrebounded Stanford. The Card had a chance to win in regulation
play, when with one second remaining and the score tied, Paccione
had a one-ane-one opportunity at the foul line. Paccione's first at
tempt missed forcing the game into overtime.
Stanford will now prepare for a special two-day tournament in San
Jose which begins Thursday. In its opening round, the Cardinal will
face a tough Texas Tech team.
