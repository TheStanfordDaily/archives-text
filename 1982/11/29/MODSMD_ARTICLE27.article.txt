fall with 30 seconds remaining

"We've come a long way
since Portland State beat us
badly two years ago," said
coach Chris Horpel. "We
need to work on a few things
and get some of our injured
people back in the lineup, but
overall, I'm pleased by the
performance.
"I don't think Portland
State knew how much we had
improved."
Two freshmen cruised to
easy wins for Stanford.
