# Doctors make difficult choices
## Hundreds wait for heart- lung transplants 
### LISA LYNCH 
The Stanford Medical Center is one
of only two placet-the nation that
performs heart-lung transplants, and as
such, it is faced with the task of choos
ing its patients from among the hun
dreds of people who apply for the oper
ation each year.
The selection process is difficult for
the staff and traumatic for potential pa

tients, whose only chance for survival is
the operation. , , ;
"We have between four and five huh- '
dred referrals," explained Joan Miller,,
a research nurse who coordinated the
transplant program. "These are either
names sent to us by doctors or people
who have read about Stanford's pro
gram." According to Miller, the refer
rals are sent a brochure listing quali

fications for potential patients and an
evaluation worksheet.
'* "Tatients are chosen for the program
on the basis of phys/cal and psy
chological characteristics listed in the
brochure. "Above all, they must be free
of any medical problems aside from
their heart-lung condition," Miller ex
plained.
The Med Center is only able to han
dle patients with primary and secon
dary congenital heart disease and the
accompanying lung problems. "In the
future, we may handle patients with dis
eases such as emphysema and cystic
fibrosis, but right now we aren't ready,"
Miller said.
The patients must also be between
the ages of 12 and 40. "In rare cases, we
might stretch the age limitations,"
Miller explained, "but we feel their
problems (those of patients over 40)
have usually deteriorated too much for
the operation to be a success, and pa
tients who are under 12 cannot really
understand the nature of the pro
cedure."
"We really need a lot of cooperation
from the patient post-surgery," Miller
said. "If they don't understand what
we're doing, they won't cooperate, and
we won't have helped them at all."
Once a doctor has certified a patient
medically qualified for the operation, a
social worker must make a psy
chological evaluation. "The patient
must have a reasonably stable family
environment," Miller said, "and a good
work history. Anyone with a criminal
history or a history of drug abuse might
be discouraged; basically, we're looking
for people who give you the impression
that given several more years, they'll do
something with it," she said.
The decision to accept or reject a pa
tient is made at the Med Center by a
team consisting of social worker Mary
Burge, cardiologist Stuart Jamieson, re
search nurses Miller and Pat Gamberg
and a doctor of pulmonary medicine.
"Sometimes, researchers working on
animal transplants will come," said
Miller.
The team meets whenever patient
space becomes available. "From the
worksheets, we select about 30 or 40 ac
tive files," Miles said, "and of these,
about 10 or 15 are good candidates."
The remainder are placed in a 'rejected
pile, and are notified that they cannot
be accepted into the program.
"We get a lot of emotional pressure
from patients we can't transplant,"
Miller said. The team usually gets three
types of phone calls; pleas from the fam
ilies of patients, from the patients them
selves and from their doctors.
"Often, we get calls from parents,"
Miller said. "Sometimes, a mother will
call and say 'You're telling me my
daughter is going to die?'."
Patients also appeal their rejection,
even though thev might have physical
limitations that disqualify them from
the operation. "We can only take pa
tients that fit our physical require

ments; I don't think it does anyone any
Rood if they call and say 'I'm dying, let
me be your guinea pig,' and you allow
the operation. There are a /ot of people
better qualified for the program."
Doctors outside the hospital some
times fail to understand the nature of a
heart-lung transplant. According to
Miller, "If a patient is accepted into the
program, their doctor often doesn't un
derstand why they can't be operated on
immediately. They forget that we're to
tally dependent on donors, and they'll
call and try to schedule the transplant."
The wait-list candidates often try to
speed up the decision. "We get phone
calls, visits from people who ask 'When
will I know?' Usually, they come to un
derstand what's involved." Some wait
list patients even move into the area,
even though the Med Center advises
against it.
During the summer, an unemployed
factory worker moved into the area to
plead for an operation for his daughter
Rhonna. "I'm not quite sure whether
Rhonna was even considered for the
program," Miller said. "But they did
get a lot of attention by doing that."
The accepted candidates have a dif
ferent, and almost as trying a situation
to cope with â€” the wait period before
the operation. Patients are warned that
there will be a wait of approximately six
to 12 months before the operation.
"We only notify five or six patients
that they are on the immediate wait list
and ask them to come into the area,"
said Miller. The other candidates are
notified when operations are com
pleted, or if patients die waiting for the
operation.
During the waiting period patients
are required to be accessible 24 hours a
day, and within about a one-hour drive
from the hospital. For patients who live
in the area, this is not much of a change
in lifestyle. But many patients come
from other parts of the country to wait
for the operation.
"Frankly, I don't know how they
hold body and soul together," said
Miller. She explained that patients must
have someone waiting with them during
the wait period, "or some kind of
nearby support system."
Patients are assigned a social worker
to help them cope with emotional dif
ficulties of the wait, but the financial
problems connected with waiting in the
Palo Alto area are left entirely to the pa
tient.
One of the most difficult parts of the
heart-lung transplant is finding a suit
able donor. It is this difficulty in finding
donors that separates heart-lung
surgery from heart transplant surgery.
"(Heart-lung) donors have to have
the same approximate body size as a pa
tient," Miller explained, "and cannot
be on a respirator more than two days
prior to their death. Also, thev cannot
have been killed in any sort of accident
that might have involved chest trauma
because then the lungs would be dam

aged.'.'
In contrast, heart donors can be in
volved in chest-trauma accidents and
can spend time on a respirator before
death. In addition, Miller said the fami-

Iv of a potential donor is more likely to
allow the heart to be removed then to
give up the entire cadaver, which is nec
essary for a heart-lung transplant.
"We return the body after the opera
tion," Miller explained, "but when a
family is grieving the death of a donor,
they often don't want to delay a funer
al."

worksheets, we select about 30 or 40 ac
tive files," Miles said, "and of these,
about 10 or 15 are good candidates."
The remainder are placed in a 'rejected
pile, and are notified that they cannot
be accepted into the program.
"We get a lot of emotional pressure
from patients we can't transplant,"
Miller said. The team usually gets three
types of phone calls; pleas from the fam
ilies of patients, from the patients them
selves and from their doctors.
"Often, we get calls from parents,"
Miller said. "Sometimes, a mother will
call and say 'You're telling me my
daughter is going to die?'."
Patients also appeal their rejection,
even though thev might have physical
limitations that disqualify them from
the operation. "We can only take pa
tients that fit our physical require

ments; I don't think it does anyone any
Rood if they call and say 'I'm dying, let
me be your guinea pig,' and you allow
the operation. There are a /ot of people
better qualified for the program."
Doctors outside the hospital some
times fail to understand the nature of a
heart-lung transplant. According to
Miller, "If a patient is accepted into the
program, their doctor often doesn't un
derstand why they can't be operated on
immediately. They forget that we're to
tally dependent on donors, and they'll
call and try to schedule the transplant."
The wait-list candidates often try to
speed up the decision. "We get phone
calls, visits from people who ask 'When
will I know?' Usually, they come to un
derstand what's involved." Some wait
list patients even move into the area,
even though the Med Center advises
against it.
During the summer, an unemployed
factory worker moved into the area to
plead for an operation for his daughter
Rhonna. "I'm not quite sure whether
Rhonna was even considered for the
program," Miller said. "But they did
get a lot of attention by doing that."
The accepted candidates have a dif
ferent, and almost as trying a situation
to cope with â€” the wait period before
the operation. Patients are warned that
there will be a wait of approximately six
to 12 months before the operation.
"We only notify five or six patients
that they are on the immediate wait list
and ask them to come into the area,"
said Miller. The other candidates are
notified when operations are com
pleted, or if patients die waiting for the
operation.
During the waiting period patients
are required to be accessible 24 hours a
day, and within about a one-hour drive
from the hospital. For patients who live
in the area, this is not much of a change
in lifestyle. But many patients come
from other parts of the country to wait
for the operation.
"Frankly, I don't know how they
hold body and soul together," said
Miller. She explained that patients must
have someone waiting with them during
the wait period, "or some kind of
nearby support system."
Patients are assigned a social worker
to help them cope with emotional dif
ficulties of the wait, but the financial
problems connected with waiting in the
Palo Alto area are left entirely to the pa
tient.
One of the most difficult parts of the
heart-lung transplant is finding a suit
able donor. It is this difficulty in finding
donors that separates heart-lung
surgery from heart transplant surgery.
"(Heart-lung) donors have to have
the same approximate body size as a pa
tient," Miller explained, "and cannot
be on a respirator more than two days
prior to their death. Also, thev cannot
have been killed in any sort of accident
that might have involved chest trauma
because then the lungs would be dam

a few are selected due to the shortage of donors.
aged.'.'
In contrast, heart donors can be in
volved in chest-trauma accidents and
can spend time on a respirator before
death. In addition, Miller said the fami-

Iv of a potential donor is more likely to
allow the heart to be removed then to
give up the entire cadaver, which is nec
essary for a heart-lung transplant.
"We return the body after the opera
tion," Miller explained, "but when a
family is grieving the death of a donor,
they often don't want to delay a funer
al."
The Stanford Medical Center is one
of only two placet-the nation that
performs heart-lung transplants, and as
such, it is faced with the task of choos
ing its patients from among the hun
dreds of people who apply for the oper
ation each year.
The selection process is difficult for
the staff and traumatic for potential pa

tients, whose only chance for survival is
the operation. , , ;
"We have between four and five huh- '
dred referrals," explained Joan Miller,,
a research nurse who coordinated the
transplant program. "These are either
names sent to us by doctors or people
who have read about Stanford's pro
gram." According to Miller, the refer
rals are sent a brochure listing quali

fications for potential patients and an
evaluation worksheet.
'* "Tatients are chosen for the program
on the basis of phys/cal and psy
chological characteristics listed in the
brochure. "Above all, they must be free
of any medical problems aside from
their heart-lung condition," Miller ex
plained.
The Med Center is only able to han
dle patients with primary and secon
dary congenital heart disease and the
accompanying lung problems. "In the
future, we may handle patients with dis
eases such as emphysema and cystic
fibrosis, but right now we aren't ready,"
Miller said.
The patients must also be between
the ages of 12 and 40. "In rare cases, we
might stretch the age limitations,"
Miller explained, "but we feel their
problems (those of patients over 40)
have usually deteriorated too much for
the operation to be a success, and pa
tients who are under 12 cannot really
understand the nature of the pro
cedure."
"We really need a lot of cooperation
from the patient post-surgery," Miller
said. "If they don't understand what
we're doing, they won't cooperate, and
we won't have helped them at all."
Once a doctor has certified a patient
medically qualified for the operation, a
social worker must make a psy
chological evaluation. "The patient
must have a reasonably stable family
environment," Miller said, "and a good
work history. Anyone with a criminal
history or a history of drug abuse might
be discouraged; basically, we're looking
for people who give you the impression
that given several more years, they'll do
something with it," she said.
The decision to accept or reject a pa
tient is made at the Med Center by a
team consisting of social worker Mary
Burge, cardiologist Stuart Jamieson, re
search nurses Miller and Pat Gamberg
and a doctor of pulmonary medicine.
"Sometimes, researchers working on
animal transplants will come," said
Miller.
