## Davis’s squad nixes tradition 
### 
A bunch of ringers slipped
into Stanford uniforms the
other day and betrayed 3272
fans who watched the basket
ball opener in Maples Pavil
ion.
Stanford beat UC-Riv
erside 84-71, but that does not
tell the story of what hap
pened in the second half.
Diabolical Dr. Davis and an
uncontrollable group of

The Sporting Muse

freshmen and brainwashed
upper-classmen slipped the
image of what Stanford
basketball teams are about
UC-Riverside was sup
posed to lose to Stanford, but
led at halftime 48-46. The situ
ation was ripe and Stanford
fans were ready to see their
team panic, lose control of the
game, get upset and go home.
That is what always happens
and they are accustomed to it.
But Davis and his troops
didn't let up. In fact, they
made 70 percent of their shots
from the field in the second
half, outscoring Riverside
38-23, much to the chagrine of
the Maples fans who had to
face the fact that there may be
more surprises in store.
It would be easy to blame it
on the three freshmen who
started for Stanford — maybe
they don't know better. But
the fact is every Stanford
player — from the always
consistent John Revelli to
freshman walk-on Andy Fis
cher — played better in the
second half than in the first
half.
It was a conspiracy.
Tom Davis is a winner and
he is coaching a group of
players who are catching on to
the attitude. Davis admits he
has a long way to go, but said

he is in no hurry as long as
they improve with each game.
"Every game we get under
our belt, I think you are going
to see progress," Davis said.
"That's the difficult part with
the first year. You are
teaching everything for the
first time. Once we get the first
year done with we will get
some continuity."
With three freshmen in his
starling line-up, Davis has a
lot of teaching to do.
The prize pupil has been 6-5
forward walk-on Andy Fis
cher.
Fischer is as wide-eyed and
babv-faced as you'd expect a
freshman walk-on to be. He is
also the best hustler on the
court and the first one on top
of every loose ball.
He played three years of
varsity basketball for New
Trier High School just outside
of Chicago and was not re
cruited by any colleges to play
basketball.
"I think maybe when we re
cruit we should look more for
those intangibles instead
height and speed," Davis said.
"But it's hard to figure out
which kid has that extra some
thing that Andy has."
Fischer tried out for the
Stanford team in mid-Sep
tember after not playing com
petitive basketball during the
summer because of a knee
condition.
"I always thought during
the summer that I would try
out," Fischer said. "At prac
tice Dr. Davis said there
would be 10, 11 or 12 players
suiting up and he promised
that one of those would be a
walk-on. That is what I was
shooting for.
"My goal was the No. 1
walk-on spot so I could get to
dress and travel. I thought

that would be enough as a
freshman and then I wanted
to play a little during my jun
ior and senior years. The thing
just continued on."
Fischer made the gray
team, or junior varsity, before
moving up to the red team and
into the starting line-up so
suddenly that his name or face
does not appear in the game
programs.
Fischer is not smooth, he is
realistic. He is not flam
boyant, he is humble. He
knows his role and plans to fill
it the best he can.
"I knew my height and
quickness would be a prob
lem," Fischer said. "I know
the only way I can play is to
hustle. I have to make up for
things.
"There is not much dif
ference between a guy who is
quick and a guy who is diving
for the ball. I think the guy
who is diving will come up
with it." '
Davis knows that Fischer
has some "growing pains" to
overcome. His aggressiveness
may get out of hand. He
fouled out while scoring 11
points and had several shots
blocked when he crawled too
deep into the Valley of the
Giants, but he's on the start
ing squad because "that little
something extra."
"This is going pretty fast,"
Fischer said. "I hope I don't
wake up from this dream."
It is still early, but Stanford
fans must face the predica
ment that there is a winning
attitude on this team — all the
way from Davis to the gray
team.
Fans are going to have to
forget the Stanford tradition
of collapse and realize this
Stanford team may be out
manned, but not out-gutted.

38-23, much to the chagrine of
the Maples fans who had to
face the fact that there may be
more surprises in store.
It would be easy to blame it
on the three freshmen who
started for Stanford — maybe
they don't know better. But
the fact is every Stanford
player — from the always
consistent John Revelli to
freshman walk-on Andy Fis
cher — played better in the
second half than in the first
half.
It was a conspiracy.
Tom Davis is a winner and
he is coaching a group of
players who are catching on to
the attitude. Davis admits he
has a long way to go, but said

he is in no hurry as long as
they improve with each game.
"Every game we get under
our belt, I think you are going
to see progress," Davis said.
"That's the difficult part with
the first year. You are
teaching everything for the
first time. Once we get the first
year done with we will get
some continuity."
With three freshmen in his
starling line-up, Davis has a
lot of teaching to do.
The prize pupil has been 6-5
forward walk-on Andy Fis
cher.
Fischer is as wide-eyed and
babv-faced as you'd expect a
freshman walk-on to be. He is
also the best hustler on the
court and the first one on top
of every loose ball.
He played three years of
varsity basketball for New
Trier High School just outside
of Chicago and was not re
cruited by any colleges to play
basketball.
"I think maybe when we re
cruit we should look more for
those intangibles instead
height and speed," Davis said.
"But it's hard to figure out
which kid has that extra some
thing that Andy has."
Fischer tried out for the
Stanford team in mid-Sep
tember after not playing com
petitive basketball during the
summer because of a knee
condition.
"I always thought during
the summer that I would try
out," Fischer said. "At prac
tice Dr. Davis said there
would be 10, 11 or 12 players
suiting up and he promised
that one of those would be a
walk-on. That is what I was
shooting for.
"My goal was the No. 1
walk-on spot so I could get to
dress and travel. I thought

that would be enough as a
freshman and then I wanted
to play a little during my jun
ior and senior years. The thing
just continued on."
Fischer made the gray
team, or junior varsity, before
moving up to the red team and
into the starting line-up so
suddenly that his name or face
does not appear in the game
programs.
Fischer is not smooth, he is
realistic. He is not flam
boyant, he is humble. He
knows his role and plans to fill
it the best he can.
"I knew my height and
quickness would be a prob
lem," Fischer said. "I know
the only way I can play is to
hustle. I have to make up for
things.
"There is not much dif
ference between a guy who is
quick and a guy who is diving
for the ball. I think the guy
who is diving will come up
with it." '
Davis knows that Fischer
has some "growing pains" to
overcome. His aggressiveness
may get out of hand. He
fouled out while scoring 11
points and had several shots
blocked when he crawled too
deep into the Valley of the
Giants, but he's on the start
ing squad because "that little
something extra."
"This is going pretty fast,"
Fischer said. "I hope I don't
wake up from this dream."
It is still early, but Stanford
fans must face the predica
ment that there is a winning
attitude on this team — all the
way from Davis to the gray
team.
Fans are going to have to
forget the Stanford tradition
of collapse and realize this
Stanford team may be out
manned, but not out-gutted.
A bunch of ringers slipped
into Stanford uniforms the

ion.
Stanford beat UC-Riv
erside 84-71, but that does not
tell the story of what hap
pened in the second half.

basketball teams are about
UC-Riverside was sup
posed to lose to Stanford, but
led at halftime 48-46. The situ
ation was ripe and Stanford
fans were ready to see their
team panic, lose control of the
game, get upset and go home.
That is what always happens
and they are accustomed to it.
But Davis and his troops
didn't let up. In fact, they
made 70 percent of their shots
from the field in the second
half, outscoring Riverside
38-23, much to the chagrine of
the Maples fans who had to
