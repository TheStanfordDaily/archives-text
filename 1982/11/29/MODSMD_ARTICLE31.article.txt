### Associated Press 
Los Angeles â€” The UCLA
Bruins have accomplished a task
that appeared to be out of their
reach three weeks ago.
By virtue of Arizona's 28-18
victory over Arizona State in
Tucson, Ariz., Saturday night,
the Bruins are the Pacific-10
Conference football champions
and will represent the league in
the Rose Bowl against Big Ten
Conference champion Michigan
in nearby Pasadena, Calif., on
New Year's Day.
The eighth-ranked Bruins,
5-1-1 in Pac-10 play and 9-1-1 ov
erall, and the 20th-ranked
Wolverines, 8-3 on the season,
will be playing for the third time
in a year and a day.
Michigan romped past UCLA
33-14 in the Bluebonnet Bowl last
New Year's Eve. In September of
this season at Ann Arbor, Mich.,
the Bruins spotted the
Wolverines a 21-0 lead before
rallying for a 31-27 triumph.
