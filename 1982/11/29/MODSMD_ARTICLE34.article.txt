# Cal students fooled
## 
### 
Poor, befuddled Berkeley.
As thousands of UC-Berkeley stu
dents rambled onto the Cal campus on
their way to morning classes last
Wednesday, many picked up a four
page "extra" edition of The Daily Cali
forntan headlined "NCAA awards Big
Game to Stanford."
And many believed it. "We don't re
ally have to give them the axe, do we?" a
defiant Cal student asked her compa
nion.
"I'm afraid so. That's how it works."
For nearly three hours, the 7000
copies of the mock Daily Californian
written and distributed by staff mem
bers of The Stanford Daily were the only
papers on the Berkeley campus. The
gods who dictated the bizarreend to the
Big Game reversed the wheel of fortune
with production delays that caused the
true Daily Californian to appear on
campus just before 11 a.m., nearly five
hours later than usual.
Stanford Daily staffers came up with
the idea on Monday afternoon, wrote
the stories early Tuesday morning and
pasted up the fake paper Tuesday after
noon. Staffers picked up the 10,000
copies of the mock issue at the San Jose
printer at 6 a.m. before distributing the
issues throughout the Berkeley campus.
Student reactions on the Cal campus
were mixed. Some students immediate
ly dismissed the issue as an obvious
hoax. Others, however, were not so
sure. Among the latter group were sev
eral Cal football players, including star
wide receiver Mariet Ford.
Many students plunged into heated
discussions before being referred to the
disclaimer on page 2. The Berkeley stu
dent association received many calls
and visits from confused readers, as did

The Daily Californian — including
some from advertisers and the Athletic
Department.
A local reporter confirmed some stu
dent estimates that the student reaction
was fairly evenly split between those
who initially believed the issue and
those who did not.
One student who was initially angry
about the issue was the Daily Californi
an's business manager. By the after
noon, however, he was agreeing with
many Berkeley and Stanford observers
when he told reporters that the issue
was "an excellent, excellent v job."
Local media treated the bogus issue
with the same hype that had accom
panied much of the other Big Game
coverage. Local papers — including the
San Francisco Chronicle, which rqn a
front page story on it, the San Jose
Mercury, the Peninsula Times Tribune
and the Oakland Tribune — treated the
prank as Stanford's last laugh in the en
tire Big Game episode. A local tele
vision reporter deemed the fake paper a
collector's item, and radio stations in
terviewed Stanford Daily staff mem
bers.
The story of the issue was picked up
bv The Associated Press and sent across
news wires throughout the state. Papers
from San Diego to Sacramento to Los
Angeles ran stories about the efforts of
the Daily staff members and the subse
quent reaction.
Stanford's last laugh also prompted a
passing snicker from the national me
dia. CBS Sport's Brent Musberger dis
cussed the issue at halftime during a na
tionally televised football game, and
USA Today, a national daily, ran a
short piece about the issue.
