Congress faces huge backlog in lame-duck session
Washingon — The lame-duck 97th Congress, jarred by mixed reviews
from voters,' limps back on stage today for a legislative curtain call that is not
exactly what President Reagan had in mind when he forced the post-election
session on reluctant congressional leaders two months ago.
Many of the issues — including taxes, spending, deficits and defense — ire
the same as they were before Congress left town in early October. But the
Nov. 2 elections shook Reagan's grip on Congress, and the main thrust of his
economic program of spending and tax cuts has been blunted by its failure to
produce recovery.
The session is expected to last no more than three weeks, and 84 of its
members will not return in January because of defeat, redistricting or volun
tary retirement.
So no great legislative breakthroughs are anticipated, aside from a pro
gram supported by both Democrats and Republicans to rebuild highways,
bridges and transit systems financed by an increase in the federal gasoline
tax.
But the session, even without infusion of new blood from the elections,
could be signficant in indicating whether, as many members have suggested,
priorities are shifting toward stimulating the economy and away from
squeezing social welfare programs.
When Reagan demanded the session as a way of reminding voters of Con
gress' tardiness in completing its budget work, he talked about wrapping up
overdue appropriations bills and polishing off a few of his pet projects, such
as a constitutional amendment to require balanced budgets.
But the strong Democratic showing in the elections, coupled with jolt after
[jolt of bad economic news, has so dramatically refocused Congress' atten
\ tion that its most likely lame-duck accomplishment may be the nickel-a-
I gallon gasoline tax increase to finance as much as SS.S billion a year in job
[creating highway, bridge and transit work.
