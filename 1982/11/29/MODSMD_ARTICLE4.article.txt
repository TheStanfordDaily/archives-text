Congress faces huge backlog in lame-duck session
Washingon — The lame-duck 97th Congress, jarred by mixed reviews
from voters,' limps back on stage today for a legislative curtain call that is not
exactly what President Reagan had in mind when he forced the post-election
session on reluctant congressional leaders two months ago.
Many of the issues — including taxes, spending, deficits and defense — ire
the same as they were before Congress left town in early October. But the
Nov. 2 elections shook Reagan's grip on Congress, and the main thrust of his
economic program of spending and tax cuts has been blunted by its failure to
produce recovery.
The session is expected to last no more than three weeks, and 84 of its
members will not return in January because of defeat, redistricting or volun
tary retirement.
So no great legislative breakthroughs are anticipated, aside from a pro
gram supported by both Democrats and Republicans to rebuild highways,
bridges and transit systems financed by an increase in the federal gasoline
tax.
But the session, even without infusion of new blood from the elections,
could be signficant in indicating whether, as many members have suggested,
priorities are shifting toward stimulating the economy and away from
squeezing social welfare programs.
When Reagan demanded the session as a way of reminding voters of Con
gress' tardiness in completing its budget work, he talked about wrapping up
overdue appropriations bills and polishing off a few of his pet projects, such
as a constitutional amendment to require balanced budgets.
But the strong Democratic showing in the elections, coupled with jolt after
[jolt of bad economic news, has so dramatically refocused Congress' atten
\ tion that its most likely lame-duck accomplishment may be the nickel-a-
I gallon gasoline tax increase to finance as much as SS.S billion a year in job
[creating highway, bridge and transit work.
Moreover, the elections churned up anxiety
about Reagan's costly defense buildup effort, and
that will lead to a renewed assault on military
spending increases, especially start-up production
funds for the MX missile and the controversial
"Dense Pack" deployment system sought for it by
the administration.
The outcome of the defense fight is unclear, but
congressional leaders anticipate passage of the
highway-jobs plan and have expressed doubt
whether there will be much zeal for continued
domestic spending cuts.
In this context, there is serious doubt among
them as to how many of the past-due appropria
tions bills, including Reagan's high-priority de
fense spending bill, can be approved and sent to the
White House before the 97th Congress finally.quits
shortly before Christmas.
If the defense money bill becomes mired in a
fight about MX and other big-ticket weapons
items, it may simply be wrapped, along with some
big domestic appropriations measures, into anoth
er omnibus "continuing resolution" to fund the
government until sometime early next year.
Reagan aides have signaled displeasure with
spending levels proposed for some of the individ
ual domestic appropriations bills, raising the possi
bility of vetoes and perhaps a confrontation over
the continuing resolution if its priorities are out of
kilter with those of the White House.
Such a standoff forced a one-day government
shutdown at this time last year until Reagan and
the Congress finally worked out a compromise.
Israel drops condition for talks
Jerusalem — The Israeli Cabinet yesterday
dropped its demand for Cabinet-level talks with
Lebanon over the withdrawal of foreign forces, but
it held firm to its insistence that the negotiations be
conducted bv senior civilian officials and that the
talks must take place "in Beirut and Jerusalem."
At its regular weekly meeting, the Cabinet
adopted a resolution reaffirming an earlier de
cision that the talks must be "of a political and se
curity nature that will include arrangements to pre
vent any possibility of aggressive acts from Leba
non on Israel and its inhabitants."
U.S. special envoy Philip Habib is known to
have urged Israel to officially drop its prior call for
Cabinet-level talks.
Israel wants to conduct the negotiations at a
high political level in the capitals of the two coun
tries to demonstrate de facto diplomatic relations.
Lebanon, concerned with maintaining its links
with the Arab world, has called for talks between
military officers conducted at the border.
The question of the site for the talks is expected
to be more troublesome than the issue of who will
head the delegations.
Israel considers Jerusalem — including pre
dominantly Arab East Jerusalem, which it cap
tured during the Six-Day War of 1967 — to be its
capital. But most nations — including the United
States and all Arab countries — refuse to recognize
the annexation of East Jerusalem.
One of the issues contributing to the deadlock in
the Israeli-Egypt-U.S. negotiations over Palesti
nian autonomy is Egypt's refusal to hold any of the
talks in Jerusalem and Israel's refusal to talk any
where at all if Jerusalem is not included.
An Israeli Cabinet source said Israel would not
allow Lebanon to "boycott Jerusalem."
Habib had suggested that the two countries fi
nesse the issue by meeting at sites near Beirut and
Jerusalem but not within the city limits of either, a
proposal that Israel specifically rejected yesterday.
It was understood that Lebanon was prepared to
accept that part of Habib's suggestion.
But even if the two countries manage to break
the impasse over procedural matters, a number of
difficult substantive issues will remain.
Israel is demanding that all remaining Palestine
Liberation Organization fighters leave Lebanon in
the first phase of any withdrawal. At that point, Is
rael savs, it is prepared to withdraw its own forces
simultaneously with the evaucation of Syrian
troops. However, Syrian President Hafez Assad
has said that no Syrian soldiers would be sent home
until all Israeli forces were out of Lebanon.
Israel is prepared to negotiate only with the Leb
anese government on the issue. No talks are con
templated between Israel and either the Syrians or
thePLO.
Baker: money policy too tight
Washington — President Reagan's economic
program is "still a gamble" but it will begin paying
off if the Federal Reserve Board moves to drive in
terest rates down' further, Senate Majority Leader
Howard Baker (R-Tenn.) said yesterday.
"We've gone a long way toward conquering in
flation, we've gone a long way toward putting in
place those things that will rejuvenate the economy
and get the country moving," Baker said.
But, he said, the Federal Reserve's tight-money
policies have kept interest rates abnormally high
and thus have had a "dampening effect" on the

economy.
"For the last two years, really, the economic des
tiny of this country has been as much in the hands
of the Federal Reserve as it has in the White House
and Congress," Baker said in an interview on CBS
TV's "Face the Nation."
The Republican leader also said that the federal
government would be "locked into unacceptably
high deficits" during the next three to five years un
less the economy gets moving again.
"I don't see large reductions in social or
domestic programs" or any major cutback in de
fense spending in the offing to help reduce the defi
cit, he said, adding that red-ink spending could
reach as much as $200 billion in the next fiscal year.
Recalling his characterization of Reagan's eco
nomic recovery program as a "riverboat gamble,"
Baker said, "it's still a gamble, but I think it's
going to work. But it'll work a lot better if you
don't have 21.5 percent prime."
The prime interest rate to which Baker referred,
the benchmark lending rate banks charge their
most creditworthy corporate customers, is now ac
tually 11.5 percent at most major banks, largely be
cause of an easing in the Federal Reserve's mone
tary policies since the onset of the recession last
year.
But Baker contended that the Federal Reserve,
the nation's central bank, could permit interest
rates to fall even lower than they are now without •
rekindling inflationary expectations — a viewpoint
opposed by Federal Reserve Chairman Paul
Volcker only last Wednesday at a congressional
hearing.
Hussein and Arafat meet
• Amman, Jordan — King Hussein and Palestine
Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat
embraced in a show of unity yesterday after resum
ing their new dialogue in search of a joint strategy
to free the West Bank and the Gaza Strip from Is
raeli occupation.
The two Arab leaders resumed the talks that
they began with great fanfare in August but which
have yielded few results. Their meeting followed
talks this weekend here between the Jordanian
king and U.S. special envoy Philip Habib.
The PLO Central Council heavily criticized the
Reagan plan at its meeting in Damascus, Syria,
Thursday but stopped short of formally rejecting
it. Israel opposes the return to Arab rule of the ter
ritories, captured in the 1967 war, and rejected the
Reagan plan.
Despite these responses, Habib, as Reagan's
representative in the area, is seeking to convince
Hussein and other Arab leaders, and through
them, Arafat and the PLO, that only the Reagan
plan offers a hope to gain an Israeli withdrawal
from the West Bank and Gaza. The U.S. initiative
calls for self-government in the occupied territories
in some sort of federation with Jordan and a freeze
on Jewish settlements. But it does not allow for an
independent Palestinian state and calls for Jordan
to represent the Palestinians in the occupied terri
tories in the talks.
Hussein, who has said he cannot negotiate for
the Palestinians without a mandate from the PLO,
and Arafat, who insists that to give up the PLO's
claim to be the legitimate representative of the
Palestinian people would destroy his organization,
began meeting in October to explore possibilities
of another common approach to the problem.
Those discussions, which resulted only in a gen
eral agreement about a hypothetical link between
Jordan and any future Palestinian state on the
West Bank and Gaza, were renewed Saturday
night in a meeting between Hussein and Arafat.
Poll on Mideast criticized
• Washington — President Reagan's primary poll
ing company, Richard Wirthlin's Decision Mak
ing Information, has completed a survey for an
Arab-American organization that showed Ameri
cans more in agreement with Arab positions on
Middle East issues than ever.
The nonprofit Institute for Arab Studies in Bel
mont, Mass., which paid an undisclosed amount
for the poll, has declared that it shows American
views "changing dramatically" toward support for
"a much more even-handed policy" than that of
Wirthlin's No. 1, Reagan.
But several independent pollsters and the Amer
ican Jewish Committee have called some of the
questions "leading" or "biased," designed to elicit
certain answers. An administration poll analyst,
who did not want to be identified, agreed there was
"some bias" in the questions but added, "I've seen
worse."
He said the findings, allowing for this bias, were
"not necessarily a dramatic shift."
Wirthlin does a $1 million annual business poll
ing for the White House and the Republican Na
tional Committee. His office said Wirthlin had no
personal involvement in the survey commissioned
by the institute.
An institute board member, Fouad Moughrabi,
professor of political science at the University of

Tennessee, said he and a colleague helped write the
questions, but denied thev were biased.
David Leach, project director for the Wirthlin
firm, confirmed that some controversial "facts" in
the questions were supplied bv the Arab-American
clients.
"We didn't check them," Leach said. "It was not
our role to."
Leach and other polling experts said it is normal
procedure for clients to help draw up the questions.
The poll, a 67-question telephone survey of 1020
adults nationwide, was done Oct. 6-11 to find out
"how would people react if given factual informa
tion," said Moughrabi, a Palestinian American
born in Jerusalem. "We worked on the assumption
that people are not that well-informed."
Milton Himmelfarb, director of research and in
formation services for the American Jewish Com
mittee, said the issue "was presented in such a way
as to elicit a response desired by the sponsors." He
added that he could easily devise a question that
would get a different answer.
According to the poll findings, 76 percent of
those questioned support the formation of an inde
pendent Palestinian state. The question was: "In
1947, the United States supported a United Na
tions proposal for both a Palestinian and an Israeli
state. Do you feel the Palestinians should have the
right to establish this state?"
The 24 percent who answered "no" or had no
opinion were then told that "half of the 4.5 million
Palestinians in the world are stateless refugees and
the majority of the remaining half live under Israeli
occupation in the West Bank and Gaza/' When the
question was repeated, 69 percent of those who had
said no the first time decided to agree.
Brazil policy: shift in focus
Brasilia, Brazil — President Reagan is scheduled
to arrive here tomorrow on a five-day Latin Ameri
can visit that officials here said they perceive as a
sign that regional relations with the United States
have been jolted into a new and different direction.
Brazil and many other South American coun
tries reached a high point in tensions with the Unit
ed States this year because of Washington's sup
port for Britain against Argentina in the Falkland
Islands conflict and what were regarded here as
punishing U.S. economic policies.
But with Reagan's visit to Brazil and three other
Latin American countries, officials here say they
perceive a U.S. willingness to shift focus.
"There is a show of good will," said one Brazil
ian government official here. "It is a broader ap
proach, more sensitive to Third World interests."
Once perceived here as insensitive to Brazil's
mounting trade problems and $80 billion foreign
debt, U.S. officials have now indicated that they
will support Brazilian efforts to raise new funds
and perhaps plug gaps with direct treasury loans.
In Brazil, where economic themes have recently
grown to be a crucial factor in foreign relations, the
prospective U.S. stress on economic assistance is
regarded as a timely — and essential — shift from
policies that have distanced the two countries since
the late 19705.
But despite the optimism surrounding Reagan's
arrival, most officials and analysts believe that
Brazil's military government will most likely stick
to long-term policies that have distanced them
from direct alignment with the United States.
Tariff compromise reached
Geneva, Switzerland — An 88-nation world
trade conference agreed early on a new set of
guidelines for encouraging free trade and halting a
rising tide of global protectionism.
The meeting of nations subscribing to the Gen
eral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade — GATT —
had been scheduled to end Saturday.
Multilateral trading concerns became side
tracked by bilateral disputes that threatened to de
stroy the conference but compromise was reached
through an emergency working group of countries,
including the United States.
Chief among the issues that caused the deadlock
was that of Common Market agricultural export
subsidies, which the United States wants halted.
Other issues covered in the final document in
cluded settlement of trade disputes, implementa
tion of measures to protect threatened industries
from foreign exports and the extension of GATT
trading rules to non-merchandise world trade,
such as banking and insurance.

The outcome of the defense fight is unclear, but
congressional leaders anticipate passage of the
highway-jobs plan and have expressed doubt
whether there will be much zeal for continued
domestic spending cuts.
In this context, there is serious doubt among
them as to how many of the past-due appropria
tions bills, including Reagan's high-priority de
fense spending bill, can be approved and sent to the
White House before the 97th Congress finally.quits
shortly before Christmas.
If the defense money bill becomes mired in a
fight about MX and other big-ticket weapons
items, it may simply be wrapped, along with some
big domestic appropriations measures, into anoth
er omnibus "continuing resolution" to fund the
government until sometime early next year.
Reagan aides have signaled displeasure with
spending levels proposed for some of the individ
ual domestic appropriations bills, raising the possi
bility of vetoes and perhaps a confrontation over
the continuing resolution if its priorities are out of
kilter with those of the White House.
Such a standoff forced a one-day government
shutdown at this time last year until Reagan and
the Congress finally worked out a compromise.
Israel drops condition for talks
Jerusalem — The Israeli Cabinet yesterday
dropped its demand for Cabinet-level talks with
Lebanon over the withdrawal of foreign forces, but
it held firm to its insistence that the negotiations be
conducted bv senior civilian officials and that the
talks must take place "in Beirut and Jerusalem."
At its regular weekly meeting, the Cabinet
adopted a resolution reaffirming an earlier de
cision that the talks must be "of a political and se
curity nature that will include arrangements to pre
vent any possibility of aggressive acts from Leba
non on Israel and its inhabitants."
U.S. special envoy Philip Habib is known to
have urged Israel to officially drop its prior call for
Cabinet-level talks.
Israel wants to conduct the negotiations at a
high political level in the capitals of the two coun
tries to demonstrate de facto diplomatic relations.
Lebanon, concerned with maintaining its links
with the Arab world, has called for talks between
military officers conducted at the border.
The question of the site for the talks is expected
to be more troublesome than the issue of who will
head the delegations.
Israel considers Jerusalem — including pre
dominantly Arab East Jerusalem, which it cap
tured during the Six-Day War of 1967 — to be its
capital. But most nations — including the United
States and all Arab countries — refuse to recognize
the annexation of East Jerusalem.
One of the issues contributing to the deadlock in
the Israeli-Egypt-U.S. negotiations over Palesti
nian autonomy is Egypt's refusal to hold any of the
talks in Jerusalem and Israel's refusal to talk any
where at all if Jerusalem is not included.
An Israeli Cabinet source said Israel would not
allow Lebanon to "boycott Jerusalem."
Habib had suggested that the two countries fi
nesse the issue by meeting at sites near Beirut and
Jerusalem but not within the city limits of either, a
proposal that Israel specifically rejected yesterday.
It was understood that Lebanon was prepared to
accept that part of Habib's suggestion.
But even if the two countries manage to break
the impasse over procedural matters, a number of
difficult substantive issues will remain.
Israel is demanding that all remaining Palestine
Liberation Organization fighters leave Lebanon in
the first phase of any withdrawal. At that point, Is
rael savs, it is prepared to withdraw its own forces
simultaneously with the evaucation of Syrian
troops. However, Syrian President Hafez Assad
has said that no Syrian soldiers would be sent home
until all Israeli forces were out of Lebanon.
Israel is prepared to negotiate only with the Leb
anese government on the issue. No talks are con
templated between Israel and either the Syrians or
thePLO.
Baker: money policy too tight
Washington — President Reagan's economic
program is "still a gamble" but it will begin paying
off if the Federal Reserve Board moves to drive in
terest rates down' further, Senate Majority Leader
Howard Baker (R-Tenn.) said yesterday.
"We've gone a long way toward conquering in
flation, we've gone a long way toward putting in
place those things that will rejuvenate the economy
and get the country moving," Baker said.
But, he said, the Federal Reserve's tight-money
policies have kept interest rates abnormally high
and thus have had a "dampening effect" on the

economy.
"For the last two years, really, the economic des
tiny of this country has been as much in the hands
of the Federal Reserve as it has in the White House
and Congress," Baker said in an interview on CBS
TV's "Face the Nation."
The Republican leader also said that the federal
government would be "locked into unacceptably
high deficits" during the next three to five years un
less the economy gets moving again.
"I don't see large reductions in social or
domestic programs" or any major cutback in de
fense spending in the offing to help reduce the defi
cit, he said, adding that red-ink spending could
reach as much as $200 billion in the next fiscal year.
Recalling his characterization of Reagan's eco
nomic recovery program as a "riverboat gamble,"
Baker said, "it's still a gamble, but I think it's
going to work. But it'll work a lot better if you
don't have 21.5 percent prime."
The prime interest rate to which Baker referred,
the benchmark lending rate banks charge their
most creditworthy corporate customers, is now ac
tually 11.5 percent at most major banks, largely be
cause of an easing in the Federal Reserve's mone
tary policies since the onset of the recession last
year.
But Baker contended that the Federal Reserve,
the nation's central bank, could permit interest
rates to fall even lower than they are now without •
rekindling inflationary expectations — a viewpoint
opposed by Federal Reserve Chairman Paul
Volcker only last Wednesday at a congressional
hearing.
Hussein and Arafat meet
• Amman, Jordan — King Hussein and Palestine
Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat
embraced in a show of unity yesterday after resum
ing their new dialogue in search of a joint strategy
to free the West Bank and the Gaza Strip from Is
raeli occupation.
The two Arab leaders resumed the talks that
they began with great fanfare in August but which
have yielded few results. Their meeting followed
talks this weekend here between the Jordanian
king and U.S. special envoy Philip Habib.
The PLO Central Council heavily criticized the
Reagan plan at its meeting in Damascus, Syria,
Thursday but stopped short of formally rejecting
it. Israel opposes the return to Arab rule of the ter
ritories, captured in the 1967 war, and rejected the
Reagan plan.
Despite these responses, Habib, as Reagan's
representative in the area, is seeking to convince
Hussein and other Arab leaders, and through
them, Arafat and the PLO, that only the Reagan
plan offers a hope to gain an Israeli withdrawal
from the West Bank and Gaza. The U.S. initiative
calls for self-government in the occupied territories
in some sort of federation with Jordan and a freeze
on Jewish settlements. But it does not allow for an
independent Palestinian state and calls for Jordan
to represent the Palestinians in the occupied terri
tories in the talks.
Hussein, who has said he cannot negotiate for
the Palestinians without a mandate from the PLO,
and Arafat, who insists that to give up the PLO's
claim to be the legitimate representative of the
Palestinian people would destroy his organization,
began meeting in October to explore possibilities
of another common approach to the problem.
Those discussions, which resulted only in a gen
eral agreement about a hypothetical link between
Jordan and any future Palestinian state on the
West Bank and Gaza, were renewed Saturday
night in a meeting between Hussein and Arafat.
Poll on Mideast criticized
• Washington — President Reagan's primary poll
ing company, Richard Wirthlin's Decision Mak
ing Information, has completed a survey for an
Arab-American organization that showed Ameri
cans more in agreement with Arab positions on
Middle East issues than ever.
The nonprofit Institute for Arab Studies in Bel
mont, Mass., which paid an undisclosed amount
for the poll, has declared that it shows American
views "changing dramatically" toward support for
"a much more even-handed policy" than that of
Wirthlin's No. 1, Reagan.
But several independent pollsters and the Amer
ican Jewish Committee have called some of the
questions "leading" or "biased," designed to elicit
certain answers. An administration poll analyst,
who did not want to be identified, agreed there was
"some bias" in the questions but added, "I've seen
worse."
He said the findings, allowing for this bias, were
"not necessarily a dramatic shift."
Wirthlin does a $1 million annual business poll
ing for the White House and the Republican Na
tional Committee. His office said Wirthlin had no
personal involvement in the survey commissioned
by the institute.
An institute board member, Fouad Moughrabi,
professor of political science at the University of

Tennessee, said he and a colleague helped write the
questions, but denied thev were biased.
David Leach, project director for the Wirthlin
firm, confirmed that some controversial "facts" in
the questions were supplied bv the Arab-American
clients.
"We didn't check them," Leach said. "It was not
our role to."
Leach and other polling experts said it is normal
procedure for clients to help draw up the questions.
The poll, a 67-question telephone survey of 1020
adults nationwide, was done Oct. 6-11 to find out
"how would people react if given factual informa
tion," said Moughrabi, a Palestinian American
born in Jerusalem. "We worked on the assumption
that people are not that well-informed."
Milton Himmelfarb, director of research and in
formation services for the American Jewish Com
mittee, said the issue "was presented in such a way
as to elicit a response desired by the sponsors." He
added that he could easily devise a question that
would get a different answer.
According to the poll findings, 76 percent of
those questioned support the formation of an inde
pendent Palestinian state. The question was: "In
1947, the United States supported a United Na
tions proposal for both a Palestinian and an Israeli
state. Do you feel the Palestinians should have the
right to establish this state?"
The 24 percent who answered "no" or had no
opinion were then told that "half of the 4.5 million
Palestinians in the world are stateless refugees and
the majority of the remaining half live under Israeli
occupation in the West Bank and Gaza/' When the
question was repeated, 69 percent of those who had
said no the first time decided to agree.
Brazil policy: shift in focus
Brasilia, Brazil — President Reagan is scheduled
to arrive here tomorrow on a five-day Latin Ameri
can visit that officials here said they perceive as a
sign that regional relations with the United States
have been jolted into a new and different direction.
Brazil and many other South American coun
tries reached a high point in tensions with the Unit
ed States this year because of Washington's sup
port for Britain against Argentina in the Falkland
Islands conflict and what were regarded here as
punishing U.S. economic policies.
But with Reagan's visit to Brazil and three other
Latin American countries, officials here say they
perceive a U.S. willingness to shift focus.
"There is a show of good will," said one Brazil
ian government official here. "It is a broader ap
proach, more sensitive to Third World interests."
Once perceived here as insensitive to Brazil's
mounting trade problems and $80 billion foreign
debt, U.S. officials have now indicated that they
will support Brazilian efforts to raise new funds
and perhaps plug gaps with direct treasury loans.
In Brazil, where economic themes have recently
grown to be a crucial factor in foreign relations, the
prospective U.S. stress on economic assistance is
regarded as a timely — and essential — shift from
policies that have distanced the two countries since
the late 19705.
But despite the optimism surrounding Reagan's
arrival, most officials and analysts believe that
Brazil's military government will most likely stick
to long-term policies that have distanced them
from direct alignment with the United States.
Tariff compromise reached
Geneva, Switzerland — An 88-nation world
trade conference agreed early on a new set of
guidelines for encouraging free trade and halting a
rising tide of global protectionism.
The meeting of nations subscribing to the Gen
eral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade — GATT —
had been scheduled to end Saturday.
Multilateral trading concerns became side
tracked by bilateral disputes that threatened to de
stroy the conference but compromise was reached
through an emergency working group of countries,
including the United States.
Chief among the issues that caused the deadlock
was that of Common Market agricultural export
subsidies, which the United States wants halted.
Other issues covered in the final document in
cluded settlement of trade disputes, implementa
tion of measures to protect threatened industries
from foreign exports and the extension of GATT
trading rules to non-merchandise world trade,
such as banking and insurance.

Congress faces huge backlog in lame-duck session
Washingon — The lame-duck 97th Congress, jarred by mixed reviews
from voters,' limps back on stage today for a legislative curtain call that is not
exactly what President Reagan had in mind when he forced the post-election
session on reluctant congressional leaders two months ago.
Many of the issues — including taxes, spending, deficits and defense — ire
the same as they were before Congress left town in early October. But the
Nov. 2 elections shook Reagan's grip on Congress, and the main thrust of his
economic program of spending and tax cuts has been blunted by its failure to
produce recovery.
The session is expected to last no more than three weeks, and 84 of its
members will not return in January because of defeat, redistricting or volun
tary retirement.
So no great legislative breakthroughs are anticipated, aside from a pro
gram supported by both Democrats and Republicans to rebuild highways,
bridges and transit systems financed by an increase in the federal gasoline
tax.
But the session, even without infusion of new blood from the elections,
could be signficant in indicating whether, as many members have suggested,
priorities are shifting toward stimulating the economy and away from
squeezing social welfare programs.
When Reagan demanded the session as a way of reminding voters of Con
gress' tardiness in completing its budget work, he talked about wrapping up
overdue appropriations bills and polishing off a few of his pet projects, such
as a constitutional amendment to require balanced budgets.
But the strong Democratic showing in the elections, coupled with jolt after
[jolt of bad economic news, has so dramatically refocused Congress' atten
\ tion that its most likely lame-duck accomplishment may be the nickel-a-
I gallon gasoline tax increase to finance as much as SS.S billion a year in job
[creating highway, bridge and transit work.
Moreover, the elections churned up anxiety
about Reagan's costly defense buildup effort, and
that will lead to a renewed assault on military
spending increases, especially start-up production
funds for the MX missile and the controversial
"Dense Pack" deployment system sought for it by
the administration.
The outcome of the defense fight is unclear, but
congressional leaders anticipate passage of the
highway-jobs plan and have expressed doubt
whether there will be much zeal for continued
domestic spending cuts.

to be more troublesome than the issue of who will
head the delegations.
Israel considers Jerusalem — including pre
dominantly Arab East Jerusalem, which it cap
tured during the Six-Day War of 1967 — to be its
capital. But most nations — including the United
States and all Arab countries — refuse to recognize
the annexation of East Jerusalem.
One of the issues contributing to the deadlock in
the Israeli-Egypt-U.S. negotiations over Palesti
nian autonomy is Egypt's refusal to hold any of the
talks in Jerusalem and Israel's refusal to talk any
where at all if Jerusalem is not included.
An Israeli Cabinet source said Israel would not
allow Lebanon to "boycott Jerusalem."
Habib had suggested that the two countries fi
nesse the issue by meeting at sites near Beirut and
Jerusalem but not within the city limits of either, a
proposal that Israel specifically rejected yesterday.
It was understood that Lebanon was prepared to
accept that part of Habib's suggestion.
But even if the two countries manage to break
the impasse over procedural matters, a number of
difficult substantive issues will remain.
Israel is demanding that all remaining Palestine
Liberation Organization fighters leave Lebanon in
the first phase of any withdrawal. At that point, Is
rael savs, it is prepared to withdraw its own forces
simultaneously with the evaucation of Syrian
troops. However, Syrian President Hafez Assad
has said that no Syrian soldiers would be sent home
until all Israeli forces were out of Lebanon.
Israel is prepared to negotiate only with the Leb
anese government on the issue. No talks are con
templated between Israel and either the Syrians or
thePLO.
Baker: money policy too tight
Washington — President Reagan's economic
program is "still a gamble" but it will begin paying
off if the Federal Reserve Board moves to drive in
terest rates down' further, Senate Majority Leader
Howard Baker (R-Tenn.) said yesterday.
"We've gone a long way toward conquering in
flation, we've gone a long way toward putting in
place those things that will rejuvenate the economy
and get the country moving," Baker said.
But, he said, the Federal Reserve's tight-money
policies have kept interest rates abnormally high
and thus have had a "dampening effect" on the

economy.
"For the last two years, really, the economic des
tiny of this country has been as much in the hands
of the Federal Reserve as it has in the White House
and Congress," Baker said in an interview on CBS
TV's "Face the Nation."
The Republican leader also said that the federal
government would be "locked into unacceptably
high deficits" during the next three to five years un
less the economy gets moving again.
"I don't see large reductions in social or
domestic programs" or any major cutback in de
fense spending in the offing to help reduce the defi
cit, he said, adding that red-ink spending could
reach as much as $200 billion in the next fiscal year.
Recalling his characterization of Reagan's eco
nomic recovery program as a "riverboat gamble,"
Baker said, "it's still a gamble, but I think it's
going to work. But it'll work a lot better if you
don't have 21.5 percent prime."
The prime interest rate to which Baker referred,
the benchmark lending rate banks charge their
most creditworthy corporate customers, is now ac
tually 11.5 percent at most major banks, largely be
cause of an easing in the Federal Reserve's mone
tary policies since the onset of the recession last
year.
But Baker contended that the Federal Reserve,
the nation's central bank, could permit interest
rates to fall even lower than they are now without •
rekindling inflationary expectations — a viewpoint
opposed by Federal Reserve Chairman Paul
Volcker only last Wednesday at a congressional
hearing.
Hussein and Arafat meet
• Amman, Jordan — King Hussein and Palestine
Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat
embraced in a show of unity yesterday after resum
ing their new dialogue in search of a joint strategy
to free the West Bank and the Gaza Strip from Is
raeli occupation.
The two Arab leaders resumed the talks that
they began with great fanfare in August but which
have yielded few results. Their meeting followed
talks this weekend here between the Jordanian
king and U.S. special envoy Philip Habib.
The PLO Central Council heavily criticized the
Reagan plan at its meeting in Damascus, Syria,
Thursday but stopped short of formally rejecting
it. Israel opposes the return to Arab rule of the ter
ritories, captured in the 1967 war, and rejected the
Reagan plan.
Despite these responses, Habib, as Reagan's
representative in the area, is seeking to convince
Hussein and other Arab leaders, and through
them, Arafat and the PLO, that only the Reagan
plan offers a hope to gain an Israeli withdrawal
from the West Bank and Gaza. The U.S. initiative
calls for self-government in the occupied territories
in some sort of federation with Jordan and a freeze
on Jewish settlements. But it does not allow for an
independent Palestinian state and calls for Jordan
to represent the Palestinians in the occupied terri
tories in the talks.
Hussein, who has said he cannot negotiate for
the Palestinians without a mandate from the PLO,
and Arafat, who insists that to give up the PLO's
claim to be the legitimate representative of the
Palestinian people would destroy his organization,
began meeting in October to explore possibilities
of another common approach to the problem.
Those discussions, which resulted only in a gen
eral agreement about a hypothetical link between
Jordan and any future Palestinian state on the
West Bank and Gaza, were renewed Saturday
night in a meeting between Hussein and Arafat.
Poll on Mideast criticized
• Washington — President Reagan's primary poll
ing company, Richard Wirthlin's Decision Mak
ing Information, has completed a survey for an
Arab-American organization that showed Ameri
cans more in agreement with Arab positions on
Middle East issues than ever.
The nonprofit Institute for Arab Studies in Bel
mont, Mass., which paid an undisclosed amount
for the poll, has declared that it shows American
views "changing dramatically" toward support for
"a much more even-handed policy" than that of
Wirthlin's No. 1, Reagan.
But several independent pollsters and the Amer
ican Jewish Committee have called some of the
questions "leading" or "biased," designed to elicit
certain answers. An administration poll analyst,
who did not want to be identified, agreed there was
"some bias" in the questions but added, "I've seen
worse."
He said the findings, allowing for this bias, were
"not necessarily a dramatic shift."
Wirthlin does a $1 million annual business poll
ing for the White House and the Republican Na
tional Committee. His office said Wirthlin had no
personal involvement in the survey commissioned
by the institute.
An institute board member, Fouad Moughrabi,
professor of political science at the University of

Tennessee, said he and a colleague helped write the
questions, but denied thev were biased.
David Leach, project director for the Wirthlin
firm, confirmed that some controversial "facts" in
the questions were supplied bv the Arab-American
clients.
"We didn't check them," Leach said. "It was not
our role to."
Leach and other polling experts said it is normal
procedure for clients to help draw up the questions.
The poll, a 67-question telephone survey of 1020
adults nationwide, was done Oct. 6-11 to find out
"how would people react if given factual informa
tion," said Moughrabi, a Palestinian American
born in Jerusalem. "We worked on the assumption
that people are not that well-informed."
Milton Himmelfarb, director of research and in
formation services for the American Jewish Com
mittee, said the issue "was presented in such a way
as to elicit a response desired by the sponsors." He
added that he could easily devise a question that
would get a different answer.
According to the poll findings, 76 percent of
those questioned support the formation of an inde
pendent Palestinian state. The question was: "In
1947, the United States supported a United Na
tions proposal for both a Palestinian and an Israeli
state. Do you feel the Palestinians should have the
right to establish this state?"
The 24 percent who answered "no" or had no
opinion were then told that "half of the 4.5 million
Palestinians in the world are stateless refugees and
the majority of the remaining half live under Israeli
occupation in the West Bank and Gaza/' When the
question was repeated, 69 percent of those who had
said no the first time decided to agree.
Brazil policy: shift in focus
Brasilia, Brazil — President Reagan is scheduled
to arrive here tomorrow on a five-day Latin Ameri
can visit that officials here said they perceive as a
sign that regional relations with the United States
have been jolted into a new and different direction.
Brazil and many other South American coun
tries reached a high point in tensions with the Unit
ed States this year because of Washington's sup
port for Britain against Argentina in the Falkland
Islands conflict and what were regarded here as
punishing U.S. economic policies.
But with Reagan's visit to Brazil and three other
Latin American countries, officials here say they
perceive a U.S. willingness to shift focus.
"There is a show of good will," said one Brazil
ian government official here. "It is a broader ap
proach, more sensitive to Third World interests."
Once perceived here as insensitive to Brazil's
mounting trade problems and $80 billion foreign
debt, U.S. officials have now indicated that they
will support Brazilian efforts to raise new funds
and perhaps plug gaps with direct treasury loans.
In Brazil, where economic themes have recently
grown to be a crucial factor in foreign relations, the
prospective U.S. stress on economic assistance is
regarded as a timely — and essential — shift from
policies that have distanced the two countries since
the late 19705.
But despite the optimism surrounding Reagan's
arrival, most officials and analysts believe that
Brazil's military government will most likely stick
to long-term policies that have distanced them
from direct alignment with the United States.
Tariff compromise reached
Geneva, Switzerland — An 88-nation world
trade conference agreed early on a new set of
guidelines for encouraging free trade and halting a
rising tide of global protectionism.
The meeting of nations subscribing to the Gen
eral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade — GATT —
had been scheduled to end Saturday.
Multilateral trading concerns became side
tracked by bilateral disputes that threatened to de
stroy the conference but compromise was reached
through an emergency working group of countries,
including the United States.
Chief among the issues that caused the deadlock
was that of Common Market agricultural export
subsidies, which the United States wants halted.
Other issues covered in the final document in
cluded settlement of trade disputes, implementa
tion of measures to protect threatened industries
from foreign exports and the extension of GATT
trading rules to non-merchandise world trade,
such as banking and insurance.

Congress faces huge backlog in lame-duck session
Washingon — The lame-duck 97th Congress, jarred by mixed reviews
from voters,' limps back on stage today for a legislative curtain call that is not
exactly what President Reagan had in mind when he forced the post-election
session on reluctant congressional leaders two months ago.
Many of the issues — including taxes, spending, deficits and defense — ire
the same as they were before Congress left town in early October. But the
Nov. 2 elections shook Reagan's grip on Congress, and the main thrust of his
economic program of spending and tax cuts has been blunted by its failure to
produce recovery.
The session is expected to last no more than three weeks, and 84 of its
members will not return in January because of defeat, redistricting or volun
tary retirement.
So no great legislative breakthroughs are anticipated, aside from a pro
gram supported by both Democrats and Republicans to rebuild highways,
bridges and transit systems financed by an increase in the federal gasoline
tax.
But the session, even without infusion of new blood from the elections,
could be signficant in indicating whether, as many members have suggested,
priorities are shifting toward stimulating the economy and away from
squeezing social welfare programs.
When Reagan demanded the session as a way of reminding voters of Con
gress' tardiness in completing its budget work, he talked about wrapping up
overdue appropriations bills and polishing off a few of his pet projects, such
as a constitutional amendment to require balanced budgets.
But the strong Democratic showing in the elections, coupled with jolt after
[jolt of bad economic news, has so dramatically refocused Congress' atten
\ tion that its most likely lame-duck accomplishment may be the nickel-a-
I gallon gasoline tax increase to finance as much as SS.S billion a year in job
[creating highway, bridge and transit work.
Moreover, the elections churned up anxiety
about Reagan's costly defense buildup effort, and
that will lead to a renewed assault on military
spending increases, especially start-up production
funds for the MX missile and the controversial
"Dense Pack" deployment system sought for it by
the administration.
The outcome of the defense fight is unclear, but
congressional leaders anticipate passage of the
highway-jobs plan and have expressed doubt
whether there will be much zeal for continued
domestic spending cuts.
In this context, there is serious doubt among
them as to how many of the past-due appropria
tions bills, including Reagan's high-priority de
fense spending bill, can be approved and sent to the
White House before the 97th Congress finally.quits
shortly before Christmas.
If the defense money bill becomes mired in a
fight about MX and other big-ticket weapons
items, it may simply be wrapped, along with some
big domestic appropriations measures, into anoth
er omnibus "continuing resolution" to fund the
government until sometime early next year.
Reagan aides have signaled displeasure with
spending levels proposed for some of the individ
ual domestic appropriations bills, raising the possi
bility of vetoes and perhaps a confrontation over
the continuing resolution if its priorities are out of
kilter with those of the White House.
Such a standoff forced a one-day government
shutdown at this time last year until Reagan and
the Congress finally worked out a compromise.
Israel drops condition for talks
Jerusalem — The Israeli Cabinet yesterday
dropped its demand for Cabinet-level talks with
Lebanon over the withdrawal of foreign forces, but
it held firm to its insistence that the negotiations be
conducted bv senior civilian officials and that the
talks must take place "in Beirut and Jerusalem."
At its regular weekly meeting, the Cabinet
adopted a resolution reaffirming an earlier de
cision that the talks must be "of a political and se
curity nature that will include arrangements to pre
vent any possibility of aggressive acts from Leba
non on Israel and its inhabitants."
U.S. special envoy Philip Habib is known to
have urged Israel to officially drop its prior call for
Cabinet-level talks.
Israel wants to conduct the negotiations at a
high political level in the capitals of the two coun
tries to demonstrate de facto diplomatic relations.
Lebanon, concerned with maintaining its links
with the Arab world, has called for talks between
military officers conducted at the border.
The question of the site for the talks is expected
to be more troublesome than the issue of who will
head the delegations.
Israel considers Jerusalem — including pre

But, he said, the Federal Reserve's tight-money
policies have kept interest rates abnormally high
and thus have had a "dampening effect" on the

economy.
"For the last two years, really, the economic des
tiny of this country has been as much in the hands
of the Federal Reserve as it has in the White House
and Congress," Baker said in an interview on CBS
TV's "Face the Nation."
The Republican leader also said that the federal
government would be "locked into unacceptably
high deficits" during the next three to five years un
less the economy gets moving again.
"I don't see large reductions in social or
domestic programs" or any major cutback in de
fense spending in the offing to help reduce the defi
cit, he said, adding that red-ink spending could
reach as much as $200 billion in the next fiscal year.
Recalling his characterization of Reagan's eco
nomic recovery program as a "riverboat gamble,"
Baker said, "it's still a gamble, but I think it's
going to work. But it'll work a lot better if you
don't have 21.5 percent prime."
The prime interest rate to which Baker referred,
the benchmark lending rate banks charge their
most creditworthy corporate customers, is now ac
tually 11.5 percent at most major banks, largely be
cause of an easing in the Federal Reserve's mone
tary policies since the onset of the recession last
year.
But Baker contended that the Federal Reserve,
the nation's central bank, could permit interest
rates to fall even lower than they are now without •
rekindling inflationary expectations — a viewpoint
opposed by Federal Reserve Chairman Paul
Volcker only last Wednesday at a congressional
hearing.
Hussein and Arafat meet
• Amman, Jordan — King Hussein and Palestine
Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat
embraced in a show of unity yesterday after resum
ing their new dialogue in search of a joint strategy
to free the West Bank and the Gaza Strip from Is
raeli occupation.
The two Arab leaders resumed the talks that
they began with great fanfare in August but which
have yielded few results. Their meeting followed
talks this weekend here between the Jordanian
king and U.S. special envoy Philip Habib.
The PLO Central Council heavily criticized the
Reagan plan at its meeting in Damascus, Syria,
Thursday but stopped short of formally rejecting
it. Israel opposes the return to Arab rule of the ter
ritories, captured in the 1967 war, and rejected the
Reagan plan.
Despite these responses, Habib, as Reagan's
representative in the area, is seeking to convince
Hussein and other Arab leaders, and through
them, Arafat and the PLO, that only the Reagan
plan offers a hope to gain an Israeli withdrawal
from the West Bank and Gaza. The U.S. initiative
calls for self-government in the occupied territories
in some sort of federation with Jordan and a freeze
on Jewish settlements. But it does not allow for an
independent Palestinian state and calls for Jordan
to represent the Palestinians in the occupied terri
tories in the talks.
Hussein, who has said he cannot negotiate for
the Palestinians without a mandate from the PLO,
and Arafat, who insists that to give up the PLO's
claim to be the legitimate representative of the
Palestinian people would destroy his organization,
began meeting in October to explore possibilities
of another common approach to the problem.
Those discussions, which resulted only in a gen
eral agreement about a hypothetical link between
Jordan and any future Palestinian state on the
West Bank and Gaza, were renewed Saturday
night in a meeting between Hussein and Arafat.
Poll on Mideast criticized
• Washington — President Reagan's primary poll
ing company, Richard Wirthlin's Decision Mak
ing Information, has completed a survey for an
Arab-American organization that showed Ameri
cans more in agreement with Arab positions on
Middle East issues than ever.
The nonprofit Institute for Arab Studies in Bel
mont, Mass., which paid an undisclosed amount
for the poll, has declared that it shows American
views "changing dramatically" toward support for
"a much more even-handed policy" than that of
Wirthlin's No. 1, Reagan.
But several independent pollsters and the Amer
ican Jewish Committee have called some of the
questions "leading" or "biased," designed to elicit
certain answers. An administration poll analyst,
who did not want to be identified, agreed there was
"some bias" in the questions but added, "I've seen
worse."
He said the findings, allowing for this bias, were
"not necessarily a dramatic shift."
Wirthlin does a $1 million annual business poll
ing for the White House and the Republican Na
tional Committee. His office said Wirthlin had no
personal involvement in the survey commissioned
by the institute.
An institute board member, Fouad Moughrabi,
professor of political science at the University of

Tennessee, said he and a colleague helped write the
questions, but denied thev were biased.
David Leach, project director for the Wirthlin
firm, confirmed that some controversial "facts" in
the questions were supplied bv the Arab-American
clients.
"We didn't check them," Leach said. "It was not
our role to."
Leach and other polling experts said it is normal
procedure for clients to help draw up the questions.
The poll, a 67-question telephone survey of 1020
adults nationwide, was done Oct. 6-11 to find out
"how would people react if given factual informa
tion," said Moughrabi, a Palestinian American
born in Jerusalem. "We worked on the assumption
that people are not that well-informed."
Milton Himmelfarb, director of research and in
formation services for the American Jewish Com
mittee, said the issue "was presented in such a way
as to elicit a response desired by the sponsors." He
added that he could easily devise a question that
would get a different answer.
According to the poll findings, 76 percent of
those questioned support the formation of an inde
pendent Palestinian state. The question was: "In
1947, the United States supported a United Na
tions proposal for both a Palestinian and an Israeli
state. Do you feel the Palestinians should have the
right to establish this state?"
The 24 percent who answered "no" or had no
opinion were then told that "half of the 4.5 million
Palestinians in the world are stateless refugees and
the majority of the remaining half live under Israeli
occupation in the West Bank and Gaza/' When the
question was repeated, 69 percent of those who had
said no the first time decided to agree.
Brazil policy: shift in focus
Brasilia, Brazil — President Reagan is scheduled
to arrive here tomorrow on a five-day Latin Ameri
can visit that officials here said they perceive as a
sign that regional relations with the United States
have been jolted into a new and different direction.
Brazil and many other South American coun
tries reached a high point in tensions with the Unit
ed States this year because of Washington's sup
port for Britain against Argentina in the Falkland
Islands conflict and what were regarded here as
punishing U.S. economic policies.
But with Reagan's visit to Brazil and three other
Latin American countries, officials here say they
perceive a U.S. willingness to shift focus.
"There is a show of good will," said one Brazil
ian government official here. "It is a broader ap
proach, more sensitive to Third World interests."
Once perceived here as insensitive to Brazil's
mounting trade problems and $80 billion foreign
debt, U.S. officials have now indicated that they
will support Brazilian efforts to raise new funds
and perhaps plug gaps with direct treasury loans.
In Brazil, where economic themes have recently
grown to be a crucial factor in foreign relations, the
prospective U.S. stress on economic assistance is
regarded as a timely — and essential — shift from
policies that have distanced the two countries since
the late 19705.
But despite the optimism surrounding Reagan's
arrival, most officials and analysts believe that
Brazil's military government will most likely stick
to long-term policies that have distanced them
from direct alignment with the United States.
Tariff compromise reached
Geneva, Switzerland — An 88-nation world
trade conference agreed early on a new set of
guidelines for encouraging free trade and halting a
rising tide of global protectionism.
The meeting of nations subscribing to the Gen
eral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade — GATT —
had been scheduled to end Saturday.
Multilateral trading concerns became side
tracked by bilateral disputes that threatened to de
stroy the conference but compromise was reached
through an emergency working group of countries,
including the United States.
Chief among the issues that caused the deadlock
was that of Common Market agricultural export
subsidies, which the United States wants halted.
Other issues covered in the final document in
cluded settlement of trade disputes, implementa
tion of measures to protect threatened industries
from foreign exports and the extension of GATT
trading rules to non-merchandise world trade,
such as banking and insurance.

Congress faces huge backlog in lame-duck session
Washingon — The lame-duck 97th Congress, jarred by mixed reviews
from voters,' limps back on stage today for a legislative curtain call that is not
exactly what President Reagan had in mind when he forced the post-election
session on reluctant congressional leaders two months ago.
Many of the issues — including taxes, spending, deficits and defense — ire
the same as they were before Congress left town in early October. But the
Nov. 2 elections shook Reagan's grip on Congress, and the main thrust of his
economic program of spending and tax cuts has been blunted by its failure to
produce recovery.
The session is expected to last no more than three weeks, and 84 of its
members will not return in January because of defeat, redistricting or volun
tary retirement.
So no great legislative breakthroughs are anticipated, aside from a pro
gram supported by both Democrats and Republicans to rebuild highways,
bridges and transit systems financed by an increase in the federal gasoline
tax.
But the session, even without infusion of new blood from the elections,
could be signficant in indicating whether, as many members have suggested,
priorities are shifting toward stimulating the economy and away from
squeezing social welfare programs.
When Reagan demanded the session as a way of reminding voters of Con
gress' tardiness in completing its budget work, he talked about wrapping up
overdue appropriations bills and polishing off a few of his pet projects, such
as a constitutional amendment to require balanced budgets.
But the strong Democratic showing in the elections, coupled with jolt after
[jolt of bad economic news, has so dramatically refocused Congress' atten
\ tion that its most likely lame-duck accomplishment may be the nickel-a-
I gallon gasoline tax increase to finance as much as SS.S billion a year in job
[creating highway, bridge and transit work.
Moreover, the elections churned up anxiety
about Reagan's costly defense buildup effort, and
that will lead to a renewed assault on military
spending increases, especially start-up production
funds for the MX missile and the controversial
"Dense Pack" deployment system sought for it by
the administration.
The outcome of the defense fight is unclear, but
congressional leaders anticipate passage of the
highway-jobs plan and have expressed doubt
whether there will be much zeal for continued
domestic spending cuts.
In this context, there is serious doubt among
them as to how many of the past-due appropria
tions bills, including Reagan's high-priority de
fense spending bill, can be approved and sent to the
White House before the 97th Congress finally.quits
shortly before Christmas.
If the defense money bill becomes mired in a
fight about MX and other big-ticket weapons
items, it may simply be wrapped, along with some
big domestic appropriations measures, into anoth
er omnibus "continuing resolution" to fund the
government until sometime early next year.
Reagan aides have signaled displeasure with
spending levels proposed for some of the individ
ual domestic appropriations bills, raising the possi
bility of vetoes and perhaps a confrontation over
the continuing resolution if its priorities are out of
kilter with those of the White House.
Such a standoff forced a one-day government
shutdown at this time last year until Reagan and
the Congress finally worked out a compromise.
Israel drops condition for talks
Jerusalem — The Israeli Cabinet yesterday
dropped its demand for Cabinet-level talks with
Lebanon over the withdrawal of foreign forces, but
it held firm to its insistence that the negotiations be
conducted bv senior civilian officials and that the
talks must take place "in Beirut and Jerusalem."
At its regular weekly meeting, the Cabinet
adopted a resolution reaffirming an earlier de
cision that the talks must be "of a political and se
curity nature that will include arrangements to pre
vent any possibility of aggressive acts from Leba
non on Israel and its inhabitants."
U.S. special envoy Philip Habib is known to
have urged Israel to officially drop its prior call for
Cabinet-level talks.
Israel wants to conduct the negotiations at a
high political level in the capitals of the two coun
tries to demonstrate de facto diplomatic relations.
Lebanon, concerned with maintaining its links
with the Arab world, has called for talks between
military officers conducted at the border.
The question of the site for the talks is expected
to be more troublesome than the issue of who will
head the delegations.
Israel considers Jerusalem — including pre
dominantly Arab East Jerusalem, which it cap
tured during the Six-Day War of 1967 — to be its
capital. But most nations — including the United
States and all Arab countries — refuse to recognize
the annexation of East Jerusalem.
One of the issues contributing to the deadlock in
the Israeli-Egypt-U.S. negotiations over Palesti
nian autonomy is Egypt's refusal to hold any of the
talks in Jerusalem and Israel's refusal to talk any
where at all if Jerusalem is not included.
An Israeli Cabinet source said Israel would not
allow Lebanon to "boycott Jerusalem."
Habib had suggested that the two countries fi
nesse the issue by meeting at sites near Beirut and
Jerusalem but not within the city limits of either, a
proposal that Israel specifically rejected yesterday.
It was understood that Lebanon was prepared to
accept that part of Habib's suggestion.
But even if the two countries manage to break
the impasse over procedural matters, a number of
difficult substantive issues will remain.
Israel is demanding that all remaining Palestine
Liberation Organization fighters leave Lebanon in
the first phase of any withdrawal. At that point, Is
rael savs, it is prepared to withdraw its own forces
simultaneously with the evaucation of Syrian
troops. However, Syrian President Hafez Assad
has said that no Syrian soldiers would be sent home
until all Israeli forces were out of Lebanon.
Israel is prepared to negotiate only with the Leb
anese government on the issue. No talks are con
templated between Israel and either the Syrians or
thePLO.
Baker: money policy too tight
Washington — President Reagan's economic
program is "still a gamble" but it will begin paying
off if the Federal Reserve Board moves to drive in
terest rates down' further, Senate Majority Leader
Howard Baker (R-Tenn.) said yesterday.
"We've gone a long way toward conquering in
flation, we've gone a long way toward putting in
place those things that will rejuvenate the economy
and get the country moving," Baker said.

have yielded few results. Their meeting followed
talks this weekend here between the Jordanian
king and U.S. special envoy Philip Habib.
The PLO Central Council heavily criticized the
Reagan plan at its meeting in Damascus, Syria,
Thursday but stopped short of formally rejecting
it. Israel opposes the return to Arab rule of the ter
ritories, captured in the 1967 war, and rejected the
Reagan plan.
Despite these responses, Habib, as Reagan's
representative in the area, is seeking to convince
Hussein and other Arab leaders, and through
them, Arafat and the PLO, that only the Reagan
plan offers a hope to gain an Israeli withdrawal
from the West Bank and Gaza. The U.S. initiative
calls for self-government in the occupied territories
in some sort of federation with Jordan and a freeze
on Jewish settlements. But it does not allow for an
independent Palestinian state and calls for Jordan
to represent the Palestinians in the occupied terri
tories in the talks.
Hussein, who has said he cannot negotiate for
the Palestinians without a mandate from the PLO,
and Arafat, who insists that to give up the PLO's
claim to be the legitimate representative of the
Palestinian people would destroy his organization,
began meeting in October to explore possibilities
of another common approach to the problem.
Those discussions, which resulted only in a gen
eral agreement about a hypothetical link between
Jordan and any future Palestinian state on the
West Bank and Gaza, were renewed Saturday
night in a meeting between Hussein and Arafat.
Poll on Mideast criticized
• Washington — President Reagan's primary poll
ing company, Richard Wirthlin's Decision Mak
ing Information, has completed a survey for an
Arab-American organization that showed Ameri
cans more in agreement with Arab positions on
Middle East issues than ever.
The nonprofit Institute for Arab Studies in Bel
mont, Mass., which paid an undisclosed amount
for the poll, has declared that it shows American
views "changing dramatically" toward support for
"a much more even-handed policy" than that of
Wirthlin's No. 1, Reagan.
But several independent pollsters and the Amer
ican Jewish Committee have called some of the
questions "leading" or "biased," designed to elicit
certain answers. An administration poll analyst,
who did not want to be identified, agreed there was
"some bias" in the questions but added, "I've seen
worse."
He said the findings, allowing for this bias, were
"not necessarily a dramatic shift."
Wirthlin does a $1 million annual business poll
ing for the White House and the Republican Na
tional Committee. His office said Wirthlin had no
personal involvement in the survey commissioned
by the institute.
An institute board member, Fouad Moughrabi,
professor of political science at the University of

Tennessee, said he and a colleague helped write the
questions, but denied thev were biased.
David Leach, project director for the Wirthlin
firm, confirmed that some controversial "facts" in
the questions were supplied bv the Arab-American
clients.
"We didn't check them," Leach said. "It was not
our role to."
Leach and other polling experts said it is normal
procedure for clients to help draw up the questions.
The poll, a 67-question telephone survey of 1020
adults nationwide, was done Oct. 6-11 to find out
"how would people react if given factual informa
tion," said Moughrabi, a Palestinian American
born in Jerusalem. "We worked on the assumption
that people are not that well-informed."
Milton Himmelfarb, director of research and in
formation services for the American Jewish Com
mittee, said the issue "was presented in such a way
as to elicit a response desired by the sponsors." He
added that he could easily devise a question that
would get a different answer.
According to the poll findings, 76 percent of
those questioned support the formation of an inde
pendent Palestinian state. The question was: "In
1947, the United States supported a United Na
tions proposal for both a Palestinian and an Israeli
state. Do you feel the Palestinians should have the
right to establish this state?"
The 24 percent who answered "no" or had no
opinion were then told that "half of the 4.5 million
Palestinians in the world are stateless refugees and
the majority of the remaining half live under Israeli
occupation in the West Bank and Gaza/' When the
question was repeated, 69 percent of those who had
said no the first time decided to agree.
Brazil policy: shift in focus
Brasilia, Brazil — President Reagan is scheduled
to arrive here tomorrow on a five-day Latin Ameri
can visit that officials here said they perceive as a
sign that regional relations with the United States
have been jolted into a new and different direction.
Brazil and many other South American coun
tries reached a high point in tensions with the Unit
ed States this year because of Washington's sup
port for Britain against Argentina in the Falkland
Islands conflict and what were regarded here as
punishing U.S. economic policies.
But with Reagan's visit to Brazil and three other
Latin American countries, officials here say they
perceive a U.S. willingness to shift focus.
"There is a show of good will," said one Brazil
ian government official here. "It is a broader ap
proach, more sensitive to Third World interests."
Once perceived here as insensitive to Brazil's
mounting trade problems and $80 billion foreign
debt, U.S. officials have now indicated that they
will support Brazilian efforts to raise new funds
and perhaps plug gaps with direct treasury loans.
In Brazil, where economic themes have recently
grown to be a crucial factor in foreign relations, the
prospective U.S. stress on economic assistance is
regarded as a timely — and essential — shift from
policies that have distanced the two countries since
the late 19705.
But despite the optimism surrounding Reagan's
arrival, most officials and analysts believe that
Brazil's military government will most likely stick
to long-term policies that have distanced them
from direct alignment with the United States.
Tariff compromise reached
Geneva, Switzerland — An 88-nation world
trade conference agreed early on a new set of
guidelines for encouraging free trade and halting a
rising tide of global protectionism.
The meeting of nations subscribing to the Gen
eral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade — GATT —
had been scheduled to end Saturday.
Multilateral trading concerns became side
tracked by bilateral disputes that threatened to de
stroy the conference but compromise was reached
through an emergency working group of countries,
including the United States.
Chief among the issues that caused the deadlock
was that of Common Market agricultural export
subsidies, which the United States wants halted.
Other issues covered in the final document in
cluded settlement of trade disputes, implementa
tion of measures to protect threatened industries
from foreign exports and the extension of GATT
trading rules to non-merchandise world trade,
such as banking and insurance.
Today's weather
Cloudy skies and occasional rain through
tomorrow. Highs today in the upper 50s, colder
tomorrow.
