# Chaparral staff artist replaces 'sexist' picture
## 
### KAREN SPRINGEN 
A C haparral artist, who felt the
cover photograph on the latest issue
of the humor magazine was sexist,
decided to take matters into his own
hands last Tuesday when he went to
the magazine's printer and replaced
the photograph with his own draw
ing.
Chappie staff members refused to
disclose the name of the artist.
The Chaparral photographer who
took the picture, sophomore
Warren Habib,said, "He(the artist)
accused us of putting some weird
sexist image in the picture ... He
went to the printer the night after the
issue went down and replaced it."
Chaparral financial manager Vin
tiie Kreda said, "We have subliminal
stuff in there (thecover photograph)
. . . like the shapes of people. He
(Habib) just developed some shad
ows more than others."
Freda added, "The subliminal
stuff we put in is sexual, it's not sex
ist."
Habib said that after the printer
notified them of the switch, the
Chaparral reinserted a similar re
touched photograph, so that when
the magazine comes out this week
the cover will appear as originally
planned.
The artist tried to talk Chappie
editors out o f using the doctored

photograph, Freda said. "He just
felt we were playing an inside joke
on Stanford," he said.
The staff member is new, and did
not understand that the Chaparral
historically plays pranks, according
to Freda.
Chaparral editor Chris Walters
said, "I don't think it's sexist . . .
Anvthing's subjective."
Most staff members knew the
print for the cover photograph was
being retouched to include sub
liminal images, Freda said.
But at least one staff member,
Mike Collins, was unaware that the
slide prints were to be retouched. "It
(the photograph) has a guy — a bum
— trying to be like a preppy. There's
three preppies in masks shying away
from him."
Walters said that after the printer
notified the editors of the change, he
put a hold on the printing of the is
sue. "Our printer (Hatcher Trade
Press) was pretty good about this,"
he said. The change in covers should
not delay the issue, which will go on
sale this week as planned, he said.
Habib declined to reveal the na
ture of the photograph but said the
layout is similar to that of the
ChaparraPs "Despair" cover. But he
said, "I don't think there's anything
straightforwardly sexist about it."
