# Hit-and-run suspect jailed earlier on similar charges
## 
### 
The San Francisco man who drove
through a group of students at the an
nual Big Game rally Nov. 19 had spent
50 days in jail last year for a "similar in
cident," according to police.
Farshad Shawhla, 21, is now charged
with five counts of felony hit-and-run
driving, five counts of assault with a
deadly weapon and One count of driv
ing with a suspended license, according
to San Francisco Police Inspector John
Fowllie. Fowllie is investigating the
case in which more than five Stanford
students were injured.
According to Fowllie, Shawhla was
jailed last vear after being arrested for
an altercation following an auto acci
dent. Shawhla's license was suspended
because he had previously been con
victed of being a negligent operator sev
eral times in the last few years, Fowllie
said.
howllie said police have dismissed an
earlier charge of possession of an open
container of alcohol because the con
tainer "was probablv thrown in by a
Stanford person."
Fowllie said that Shawhla is a citizen
of the United Kingdom and an Iranian
national here on a student visa.

Shawhla told police he was a student at
the University of San Ffancisco,
Fowllie said.
Tomorrow Fowllie will be coming to
Stanford to talk with Stanford police
and victims and witnesses of the acci
dent. Fowllie said he would like to talk
with people who saw the car when it
first entered Larkin Street from a park
ing garage.
Even though police have found addi
tional students who received minor in
juries in the incident, no more counts
will be filed against Shawhla. "There's
no point in adding a dozen more,"
Fowllie explained.
The Nov. 19 incident occurred near
the end of the annual march from San
Francisco's Nob Hill to Aquatic Park
across from Ghiradelli Square. A green
sports car driven by Shawhla ' ac
celerated through part of the 5000-per
son crowd on Larkin Street.
Police later arrested Shawhla at his
home six blocks away. He reportedly
told police that he only accelerated into
the crowd after students taunted him.
However, several witnesses said crowd
members struck the car only after it had
begun to plow through the rally.
