## The 						nuclear issue: opposition from Congress and church MX proposal sparks policy debate

President Reagan's proposal last Monday
night to base the MX missile in closely spaced
silos has been called everything from "essen
tial" to modernizing the armed forces to a
"nice idea" that makes no sense. The debate
focuses on whether or not the MX is needed
at all and whether or not it will do what it is
designed to do.
The proposal is to base the first 100 MX
(for "missile experimental") missiles in a
"dense pack". The missiles would be spaced
in hardened silos 1800 feet apart in a narrow
strip 14 miles long and I'/: miles wide situated
at Warren Air Force Base in Wyoming. The
program is expected to cost as much as 526
billion for the initial deployment, and possi
bly S4O billion with additions over the next 10
years.
The plan must still be approved by Con
gress, which is showing signs that it has yet to
be convinced.
Reagan made the proposal after a lengthy
Pentagon stvdy came to the conclusion that
the "dense pack" plan is the most effective
one possible. The rationale for the plan rests
on the theory of "fratricide."
The theory holds that incoming Soviet mis
siles would destroy each other, allowing the
underground missiles to survive and be
launched in a retaliatory attack. The MX mis
siles will be based in silos built to withstand
pressure of more than 100,000 pounds per
square inch. Because of this, and the theo
retical impossibility of the Soviets' timing
missile strikes precisely enough to overcome
the "fratricide" effect, American defense
strategists contend that at least 50 percent of
the MX missiles would survive.
American defense planners hope that the
plan, although impossible to test and prove,
will cause enough uncertainty in the minds of

Soviet planners that it would deter a Soviet
nuclear strike.
But critics say that Soviet planners could
"pin down" the MX missiles by targeting one
missile after another on the "dense pack,"
rendering the missiles useless. Thev also claim
that the Soviets could use a strategy called a
"walk," where thev could target every other
MX missile silo in a north-south barrage, so
that missiles coming in from the north would
not have to pass through clouds of debris and
radiation.
Another object of criticism is the presi
dent's claim that the MX is needed to offset a
United States military disadvantage. Reagan
claims that the Soviets have achieved a
margin of superiority which endangers Amer
ican land-based missile systems. Reagan also
hopes to be able to use the MX as a "bargain
ing chip" in arms control talks. Without it,
according to Reagan, the Soviets would have
no incentive to negotiate seriously.
"If we had not begun to modernize," Rea
gan said, "the Soviet negotiators would know
we had nothing to bargain with except talk."
But critics of the administration's 51.6
trillion military buildup say that although
U.S. nuclear forces are inferior in certain
areas, they are superior to Soviet forces in
quality and flexibility. They also point out
that U.S. superiority lies in its submarines
and other sea-based nuclear forces, and that
NATO forces make up for any discrepancy
between U.S. and Soviet nuclear forces.
At Stanford, Prof. Sidney Drell, assistant
director of SLAC, said of the proposed plan,
"If this system is being viewed as essential to
our security, it violates common sense and in
tuition to place it all together in one little
area."
Asst. Political Science Prof. Condoleeza
Rice said that "given the fact that it is unclear

as to whether it violates the SALT il treaty, it
sends an unfortunate signal to the Soviets."
Although the SALT II treaty was never rat
ified bv the U.S. Senate, both the United
States and the Soviet Union are still abiding
it. Some critics have charged that the MX
would violate the treaty on the grounds that
the treaty prohibits building "additional fix
ed ICBM launchers." Administration of
ficials, however, contend that the MX missile
silos would not be "launchers" because the
missiles would be contained in mobile
canisters.
They also say that "if the Soviets find it to
their advantage to break SALT 11, they'll do
so â€” almost no matter what we do," in the
words of Fred Ikle, undersecretary of de
fense.
Some critics also say that the MX repre
sents an effort to provide the United States
with a first-strike capability rather than to de
ter a Soviet strike. The Soviet government
itself has leveled this charge. Ikle responded
to these claims bv pointing out that "if we
were really interested in a first-strike capabili
ty, we wouldn't go to the trouble of making
the MX basing mode survivable. We'd just
buy more missiles with that money."
Others assert that as long as both the Unit
ed States and the Soviet Union have bombers
and submarines capable of delivering nuclear
warheads, the concept of a "first strike" is ir
relevant.
Another major question is whether the MX
will actually help spur arms reduction talks as
Reagan claims or whether the program will
have the opposite effect. The Air Force has
admitted that by the 1990s the Soviets will
have developed countermeasures that will
threaten the MX system and require its ex
pansion or improvement. But military ana
lysts say that such improvements will be able
to be made relatively cheaply.
