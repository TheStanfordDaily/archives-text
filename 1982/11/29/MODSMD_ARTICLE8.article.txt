# Bishops challenge nuclear strategy

Compiled from news reports and wire ser

While discussions in Congress
continued the National Con
ference of Catholic Bishops met
last week in Washington, D.C. to
debate the morality of nuclear
strategy.
Specifically, the 276 bishops of
the U.S. Roman Catholic
Church were concerned with the
draft of a pastoral statement ad
dressed to 51 million American
Catholics.
This was also a time for the
bishops to re-examine the
church's pacifist theology Hi reJa-

tion to present circumstances,
and to reflect on whether their
ideas are right for the church and
for the nation. Instead of phras
ing its document in traditional
terms of dogma, the bishops

asked Catholics to evaluate and
consider the conclusions.
In September, a Vatican panel
endorsed bv Pope John Paul II
had declared that the prevention
of nuclear war is "the greatest
moral issue humanity has ever
faced and there is no time to
lose."
Coinciding with a Soviet
change of leadership, the passage
of various nuclear referendums
at this month's elections and im
portant discussions on U.S. de
fense spending, the conference
sought to challenge the assump
tions and strategies underlying
the" nuclear age — namely the
doctrine of nuclear deterrence.
The conference acknowledged
that the U .S. threat to use nuclear
weapons is a response to the So
viet buildup and possibility of as
sault, but labeled deterrence an
| unsatisfactory policy because it is
based on a balance of terror, all
too easily leading to a holocaust.
A key factor for successful de
terrence is to threaten and mean
it; there must be creditable intent.
This, however, creates a paradox
for the church, because tradi
tionally, it is as wrong to intend
to commit an evil act as it is to ac
tually commit it.
Moreover, say the bishops, the
funding required to maintain this
balance takes away money which

supports social programs for the
poor. In this sense, they argued
against the new MX missiles,
saying it could only quicken the
arms race.
At this point, the United States
retains the option of the first use
of nuclear weapons in order to
deter the Soviets from using su
perior conventional arms against
Western Europe. Believing that
no nuclear warcan be limited, the
bishops urged a nuclear freeze,
coupled with an active and con
certed effort toward a disarma
ment agreement with Moscow.
Five bis hops, with views rang
ing from hawkish to openly
pacifist, drafted the pastoral let
ter; the committee is headed by
Most Rev. Joseph Bernardin, 54,
Archbishop of Chicago.
One of the problems thev face
is how to present the issues to the
nation's Cathoiics — whether to
raise the questions and allow in
dividual conscience to choose, or
to make a statement binding
Catholics to the teaching author
ity of the church, as expressed
through its bishops.
Another question is whether
the National Conference should

go further and be more specific
than the Pope.
This is not the first time that
such topics have been broached
and acted upon; in recent years
the United States has seen an
enormous increase in the range
and volume of pronouncements
by the U.S. bishops on social is
sues. »
At least 200 statements
have been issued since 1966, and
there are now two bodies within
the hierarchy. The National Con
ference of Catholic Bishops is a
strictly ecclesiastical body, while
the U.S. Catholij: Conference
acts as the civic ancf service or
ganization of the bishops.
Although the final debate of
this year's conference failed to re
solve or determine the church's
stand on the nuclear issue, the
Bemardin committee plans to
hold a special conference in Chi
cago on May 2 and 3 to decide
and issue a clear policy
statement.
Meanwhile, responses and
written comments will be solic
ited from around the world, espe
cially from Western Europe's
bishops, who perceive a leftward
drift in the American clergy.
