## Time capsule contents reflect individual class personalities 
### KATHRYN MATTHEWS 
Senior t-shirts. Quads, Big Game and Gaieties
tickets, Casino Night chips, Daily articles detail
ing major news events of the year, housing draw
numbers and unpaid parking tickets are com
mon contents in time capsules buried in the In
ner Quad in recent years.
Beginning with the Class of 1892, capsules
containing memorabilia of each graduating class
have been placed in the Inner Quad. The exact
contents of most of the capsules are unknown.
According to Roxanne Nilan, University
Archivist, there is no formal mechanism to rec
ord what is placed under each plate. "The class
plates," she explained, "are a tradition, and it
wouldn't be too easy to ask the senior class to
conform to the bureaucracy of submitting a
list."
The Daily began recording the items buried in
the capsules in its first commencement issue in
1976, but the contents of the capsules buried
before that year remain a mystery.
The memorabilia selected by each class mir
rors its character. For example, the members of
the class of 1977 decided to include objects they
felt r.ight be obsolete in the future: a vial of wa
ter, saccharine, fossil fuel and the birth control
pill. _
Comparative tuition checks from 1973 and
1977 reflected the economic woes of the period,
according to Jamie Grodsky, 1977 senior class
co-president, while black armbands and United
Farm Workers Union emblems symbolized stu
dent activism.
Last year's class included such memorabilia as
a Harvard Law School application, a rape whis
tle, a loan application labeled "endangered spec
ies" and cocaine paraphernalia.
The items in the capsules are selected by the
senior class officers from suggestions gathered
throughout the year. Kevin O'Beirne, a current
senior class officer, said that contents of the '83
capsule will be decided late in spring quarter.
According to O'Beirne, the items chosen will be
those common to senior life.
The contents of the capsules before 1976 re
main shrouded in tradition and dim memories.
Don Carlson, a member of the Class of 1947,
said, "Frankly, I don't remember what went in
ours. I was in Europe at the time. I think usually
a Daily and a Quad, the class will, and some
memorabilia peculiar to the class. We probably
put something GI in ours."
Ros Bacon, a 1930 Stanford graduate, guessed
that a class history, poem and roster are buried
in the 1930 capsule.
Nilan said it would be interesting to discover
upon opening the capsules what each class
thought about itself. The element of surprise
which stems from the lack of an official written
list could be valuable, she added.
To date, none of the capsules have been
opened. Renovation of Memorial Church in
l 4 >h i necessitated the removal of several of the
plates, but v according to Nilan, the sealed
capsules were left intact. The 1892 capsule, how
ever, was not sealed and was opened for preser
vation work. It consisted solely of a scroll signed
bv 28 members of the class.
Nilan hypothesized that the centennial of the
University in 1992 will probably provide the first
opportunity to open the capsules.

The notion of opening the capsules during
50th year class reunions has also been suggested,
especially by recent graduating classes. Margo
Nelson of the Bowman Alumni Association
agreed that the 50th reunion might be an ap
propriate time to open the capsules because it is
the last official reunion as a class. After the 50th
reunion, all classes meet as one.
Fred Glover, a 1933 graduate who is actively
planning his class's 50th reunion, finds the idea
of opening the capsule "very appealing," but
said the idea hasn't been seriously considered.
Though the Class of 1892 later added class
plates retroactively, the tradition of the time
capsules was actually started by the Class of
1896. Their idea was not original: Jane Stanford
was fond of putting significant items such as
news clippings, Bibles and important papers in
the cornerstones of campus buildings.
"This idea," Nilan said, "was very up-to-date
at the time and the practice is still common to
day. The concept of a time capsule is very old."
The Class of 1896 placed its plate directly in
front of the then-unfinished Memorial Church.
Nilan termed this area in the Inner Quad, "the
heart of the University." The trail of bronze and
antimony plates has since advanced to the Amer
ican Studies building and in 1989 will turns its
first corner. In the year 2492, according to calcu
lations made by University President Donald
Kennedy, the plates will completely encircle the
Inner Quad.

reunion, all classes meet as one.
Fred Glover, a 1933 graduate who is actively
planning his class's 50th reunion, finds the idea
of opening the capsule "very appealing," but
said the idea hasn't been seriously considered.
Though the Class of 1892 later added class
plates retroactively, the tradition of the time
capsules was actually started by the Class of
1896. Their idea was not original: Jane Stanford
was fond of putting significant items such as
news clippings, Bibles and important papers in
the cornerstones of campus buildings.
"This idea," Nilan said, "was very up-to-date
at the time and the practice is still common to
day. The concept of a time capsule is very old."
The Class of 1896 placed its plate directly in
front of the then-unfinished Memorial Church.
Nilan termed this area in the Inner Quad, "the
heart of the University." The trail of bronze and
antimony plates has since advanced to the Amer
ican Studies building and in 1989 will turns its
first corner. In the year 2492, according to calcu
lations made by University President Donald
Kennedy, the plates will completely encircle the
Inner Quad.

Senior t-shirts. Quads, Big Game and Gaieties
tickets, Casino Night chips, Daily articles detail
ing major news events of the year, housing draw
numbers and unpaid parking tickets are com
mon contents in time capsules buried in the In
ner Quad in recent years.
Beginning with the Class of 1892, capsules
containing memorabilia of each graduating class
have been placed in the Inner Quad. The exact
contents of most of the capsules are unknown.
According to Roxanne Nilan, University
Archivist, there is no formal mechanism to rec
ord what is placed under each plate. "The class
plates," she explained, "are a tradition, and it
wouldn't be too easy to ask the senior class to
conform to the bureaucracy of submitting a
list."
The Daily began recording the items buried in
the capsules in its first commencement issue in
1976, but the contents of the capsules buried
before that year remain a mystery.
The memorabilia selected by each class mir
rors its character. For example, the members of
the class of 1977 decided to include objects they
felt r.ight be obsolete in the future: a vial of wa
ter, saccharine, fossil fuel and the birth control
pill. _
Comparative tuition checks from 1973 and
1977 reflected the economic woes of the period,
according to Jamie Grodsky, 1977 senior class
co-president, while black armbands and United
Farm Workers Union emblems symbolized stu
dent activism.
Last year's class included such memorabilia as
a Harvard Law School application, a rape whis
tle, a loan application labeled "endangered spec
ies" and cocaine paraphernalia.
The items in the capsules are selected by the
senior class officers from suggestions gathered
throughout the year. Kevin O'Beirne, a current
senior class officer, said that contents of the '83
capsule will be decided late in spring quarter.
According to O'Beirne, the items chosen will be
those common to senior life.
The contents of the capsules before 1976 re
main shrouded in tradition and dim memories.
Don Carlson, a member of the Class of 1947,
said, "Frankly, I don't remember what went in
ours. I was in Europe at the time. I think usually
a Daily and a Quad, the class will, and some
memorabilia peculiar to the class. We probably
put something GI in ours."
Ros Bacon, a 1930 Stanford graduate, guessed
that a class history, poem and roster are buried
in the 1930 capsule.
Nilan said it would be interesting to discover
upon opening the capsules what each class
thought about itself. The element of surprise
which stems from the lack of an official written
list could be valuable, she added.
To date, none of the capsules have been
opened. Renovation of Memorial Church in
l 4 >h i necessitated the removal of several of the
plates, but v according to Nilan, the sealed
capsules were left intact. The 1892 capsule, how
ever, was not sealed and was opened for preser
vation work. It consisted solely of a scroll signed
bv 28 members of the class.
Nilan hypothesized that the centennial of the
University in 1992 will probably provide the first
opportunity to open the capsules.

The notion of opening the capsules during
50th year class reunions has also been suggested,
especially by recent graduating classes. Margo
Nelson of the Bowman Alumni Association
agreed that the 50th reunion might be an ap
propriate time to open the capsules because it is
the last official reunion as a class. After the 50th
reunion, all classes meet as one.
