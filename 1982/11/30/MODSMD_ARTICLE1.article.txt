# Storm rips into campus
## 
### 
The storm that blew through campus
last night took several trees and part of
the Braun Music Center construction
masonry with it.
Students Mark Sherman and Paul
Dedominico were walking through
Lathrop parking lot on their way home
from the library about midnight when
they heard a noise over the roar of the
wind and looked around to see a wall
from the Braun Music Center, now un
der construction slowly crash to the
ground. Dedominico estimated that
the wall, composed of heavy concrete
blocks, was about 16 feet high by 7 feet
wide. Neither student was hurt.
The witnesses did not investigate
further. "The situation seemed danger
ous," said Sherman. "There was all
kinds of stuff blowing off the roof."
Later that night, however, the situation
seemed to have stabilized. Only the
Center's retaining cyclone fence ap
peared to have sustained damage.
Also, a large tree fell into a residence
at S9l Salvatierra on campus, accord
ing to Stanford Police. Police said trees
were felled across campus and Palo
Alto.
