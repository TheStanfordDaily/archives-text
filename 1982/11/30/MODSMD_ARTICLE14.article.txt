## The
						Stanford Daily Band jokes disconcerting 
### 
Hey (yuk, yuk), did you hear the one about the
band?
"How many Stanford students does tt take to screw
in a light bulb?"
"Twelve — one to screw it in and eleven to keep the
band away."
Haw, haw, haw. Regardless of all the complaints
about last week's controversial (as in ridiculous)
Big Game finale, one has to admit that the spectacle
of Kevin Moen rushing through a mass of red
coated musicians and flattening a trombone player
in the end zone was pretty darn funny. (Not funny
for the trombone player, perhaps, but for ev
erybody else.) Not to bruise anyone's sense of jus
tice too severely, but when all the television stations
and networks were (and still are) replaying that
kickoff return, it isn't to show the captive, snigger
ing audiences how Stanford got screwed over by the
dirty Golden Bears, the officials, Paul Wiggin, Joe
"Life Isn't Fair" Kapp, the Hall of Fame Bowl
Committee, the administration's economic poli
cies, Halley's Comet, or whatever. It's to show the
esteemed Mr. Moen running off tuba to a touch
down at the expense of the good ol' LSJUMB —
and trashing a trombone player to boot. It's a funny
play, and if you're not laughing about it yet, then
you'll never understand the joke.
" Will Paul Wiggin prepare a better game plan for
the band next year?"
"And will he recruit for a tuba player who can
tackle?"
But there is a disconcerting edge to the giggles —
one that outside observers have been interpreting a

little too seriously. To them, the band really did\ost
the game for Stanford; their presence on the field
was not a gesture of slightly premature celebration,
but another in a series of inconsiderate acts that
take away from the atmosphere of healthy competi
tion desired at a prestigious West Coast university
and instead inspire Weenies to call us Snots. "The
band ran onto the field before the game was over?"
they ask incredulously. "How rude
For such scapegoat-hunters, a number of short,
choppy responses come to mind. Perhaps the most
effective (and most appropriate, though not neces
sarily the most cathartic) would be to put oneself
into the Band's well-worn shoes. Not meaning to
rub anyone's nose in the issue, we feel that what we
said at the beginning of last week still holds true: "If
you can responsibly say that you would have stayed
off the field if you had a trombone in your hand and
thought the game was over, then you need to have
your pulse checked." In other words, the LSJUMB
is not to blame, OK?
Of course, we followed that statement up with a
plea for teaching the band how to tackle by next
November. We're as susceptible to a good joke (or
a bad one) as anyone, and any opportunity for hu
mor in a fiasco like this year's Big Game should be
used. But after a week and a half of jokes, some of
the barbs begin to take hold, and some even take
the jests seriously. And that's too bad — for the
band, for the football team, for the fans who really
don't want to dwell on painful memories for too
long and for a University that has far better things
to do than point fingers.
