## Men and domination impulses 
### 
Men rape women. No qualifications such as abnormal, in
sane, underpriviledged, uneducated or non-white need be
added because the basic truth is that men rape and women
are their victims. When considering how rape effects us and
what we can do to change the situation, we should keep that
bare fact in mind.
But there are other points that are persistent: rape is übi
quitous — the FBI estimates that one out of six women in the
United States will be raped in her lifetime. Rape is normal —
studies have shown that the personality traits of convicted
rapists did not differ from those of a more "representative"
sample of men — namely, college freshmen. Women from
nine months to 90 years of age are raped and their assailants
include white men, black men, rich men, poor men, young
men and old men — strangers, friends or lovers. In short,
rape does not disappear just because it doesn't make the
front page of the paper.
Rape is rooted in the power and control that men have in
our society. Men dominate women and rape is one of the vi
olent methods used to maintain this domination. This male
monopoly of power creates and maintains certain privileges
for men that women don't enjoy: freedom of mobility (espe
cially after dark) and freedom from the ever-present threat
of physical violation. The hue and cry that arose from men
concerning the suggestion that we be required to find escorts
to accompany us on trips around campus after dark merely
shows how central these privileges are to men's lives and how
unwilling we are to share them.
Men are taught to rape at an early age and the lesson is
reinforced throughout their lives. Pornography surrounds
them, wherever they are the message is that women are ob
jects — the "other," they exist to serve our needs, providing
the substance to fill our spiritual and emotional emptiness.
Yet, in return for their support, often given with immense
love, men fear them, hate them, beat, rape and kill them, in
order to make sure they keep supplying them with the sus
tenance we need.
Although hardly comparable, the costs to men for our mi
sogyny are varied and profound. We fail to develop the spiri
tuality and emotionality that constitute a complete human
being, relying instead upon the energy of the women around
us. We are alienated from ourselves, our connections with
our brothers are distorted and our connections with the uni
verse are usually non-existent. Gentleness is missing in our
system of values, and as a result, war, pollution, hunger and
the omnipresent possibility of the instantaneous annihila
tion of our world characterize the world men ha"« created.
We should seek to emulate, rather than to deny and destroy
the beauty and the strength that women possess.

The suggestions that Jim Steyer and Mike Calabrese pro
posed (Daily, Nov. 8) as methods for men to deal with rape
are useful as an initial step. Efforts to implement them, how
ever, should not obscure the basic fact that rape won't stop
until men stop raping; rape won't stop until we stop men
from raping. To do so, we have to change ourselves and
change the conditions in our world that give men the power
to dominate women.

Men dominate women and rape is one
of the violent methods used to
maintain this domination. This male
monopoly of power creates and
maintains certain privileges for men
that women don *t etyoy: freedom of
mobility (especially after dark) and
freedom from the ever-present threat
of physical violation.

Some basic questions to ask yourself are: how is my sex
uality based on control and domination? How is the society
of which I am a part based on male domination and violence
against women? For too long, men have had a monopoly on
talking about rape, generally only perverting or obscuring
the issue. It's time we listened to what women have to say, to
really think hard about their words and to take them to
heart. Pick up some writings by Audre Lourde, Robin
Morgan, Adrienne Rich, Cherrie Moraga or a host of others
and read them carefully, thinking about what their words
mean for your life. Then start thinking about how to change
our misogyny.
The means may not be clear, but the goals are un
mistakable: we must stop beating and raping women; we
have to abolish the privileges we have as men that we refuse
to share with women. We men have to struggle to become
complete human beings; we have to learn to love ourselves
and the women and the men around us. If we don't, we'll
only end up destroying ourselves.
