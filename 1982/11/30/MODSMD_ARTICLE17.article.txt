## SCPA's pro-MX missile leaflet reminiscent of the days of war ' 
### 
A leaflet circulated last week by the
Stanford Conservative Political Al
liance asked us to support President
Ronald Reagan's plans for the new MX
missile ("the Peacekeeper"). "We must
trust our President," the leaflet said.
"Now is not the time to question." It
gave me a twinge of nostalgia. When
United States troops first went to the
jungles of Vietnam we were asked to
"trust the president." Presumably our
leaders knew what they were doing. Ten
years later we knew that they had spent
$75 billion destroying three small coun
tries in a totally futile exercise.
Now our president is proposing to
build a $26.4bi11i0n nuclear missile sys
tem that would accelerate the arms
race, undermine arms control efforts

and add huge new potential to an
arsenal that can already blow up the
planet. Our nation would devote vast
resources to burying a "negotiating
card" in concrete while thousands of
Americans literally have nowhere to
sleep and tens of thousands line up ev
ery day for bread and soup.
Nuclear scientists and other experts
have called the MX plan wasteful non
sense. We should weigh their words and
trust our own critical faculties before
we put blind trust in a president who
has repeatedly lied about employment
figures, about the economy, about
agreements with our allies, about El
Salvador and about our comparative
military strength. To trust him in a plan
that defies all logic would be to join in

his madness.

Leave him alone
I'd like to express my opinion con
cerning the Daily's choice of supposed
"front-page quality" news and how un
fair it is to the subject. I am referring to
the picture of John Elway on the front
page (Daily, Nov. 23). I don't know
Elwav and I can't speak for him, but is it
news when he attends a basketball
game? Leave him alone! He has enough
pressure frbm the national and local
media. He does not need his fellow stu
dents hawking him day and night. We

all know that he is the best college quar
terback ever. Let's also realize that he is
one of our fellow students and deserves
to be treated like one, rather than as an
object. I doubt very much that he, or
anyone else, came to Stanford to have
his picture taken while attending a
basketball game.
Why doesn't the Daily send its top re
porters and photographers up to the
Delt House for a day to follow him
around? What Stanford student
wouldn't want to know what brand of
toothpaste our Heisman Trophy can
didate uses? For his own sake, leave him
alone so he can be what he wants to be,
a regular Stanford senior!
