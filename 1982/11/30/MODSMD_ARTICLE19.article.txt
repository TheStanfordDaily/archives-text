# Good corned beef...in L.A.?
## 
### 
We belong to a generation that en
joys an unprecedented luxury — the op
portunity to choose where we would
like to settle down and make a living —
but many of us make this crucial de
cision haphazardly. Prospective law
yers, doctors, engineers and busi
nessmen will tell you that they're in
terviewing for jobs primarily in New
York or Los Angeles, but also in San
Francisco or Chicago, Dallas or Atlan
ta, Washington, D,.C. or the Silicon
Valley. The only certainty on the dim
horizon after graduation seems to be
that they will find themselves in the 50
percent tax bracket.
This was not always the case. Were it
not for the intervention of a few
cataclysmic events, such as the Russian
Revolution and Hitler's rise to power,
my grandfather's progeny would now
be sipping borscht for breakfast and
contemplating the crossword puzzle in
the morning edition of Pravda. In the
days before commercial air travel, fami
lies stayed put in their ancestral homes
unless evicted by fire, famine or foreign
matters. Only a handful of intrepid in
dividuals ventured to receive a pro
fessional education at distant univer
sities.
My grandfather and his peers would
not understand the pervasive transience
that characterizes our upwardly-mobile
generation. We matriculate at the best
college we get in to — be it Stanford,
Yale or M.I.T. Geography remains just
one factor in the midst. Once at school,
as if mom and dad didn't warn us, we
are apt to meet and fall in love with
members of the opposite sex who come
from opposite ends of the nation, if not
the world. Finally, we enter careers that
enable us to secure gainful employment
in any one of 500-odd "urban environ
ments." Rarely does one know where
he comes from and plans to go back
there.
The rest of us begin to discuss the
charms and faults of cities on an amaz
ingly simplified scale. The classic com
parison — between New York and Los
Angeles — boils down to the following
collections of cliches: "L.A. has smog,
beaches and expensive real estate." By
contrast, "New York has crime, traffic
and culture." It boggles the mind to
hear intelligent people talking this way.
Dramatically different conclusions
would be reached after a short visit to
the Norton Simon Museum (in
Pasadena) or after spending a summer
weekend on the Long Island shore.
Still, the notion persists that Southern
Californians spend most of their wak
ing hours jogging or applying sun tan
lotion; and New Yorkers habitually at
tend Broadway shows whenever they're
not walking their Doberman pinschers
amid the muggers in Central Park.
These truisms deserve to be fully ex
ploded. Vice President George Bush
should be summoned from Siberia to
produce a multi-volume report that

adequately describes and contrasts our
major metropolitan centers. In the
meantime, we band of nomadic pre
professionals must shun generalities,
trite observations and over-sim
plifications that conform to pre-con
ceived images of particular places. It is,

after all, possible to find a good corned
beef sandwich just about anywhere.
Even in Los Angeles.
