Walk down memory lane
Under the feet of the thousands who traverse the inner Quad each day
lies a collection of University history. The brass plaques In front of Me
morial Church conceal a time capsule from each graduating class.
Class plaques allegedly hold a dollv boot, water from Lake Lag and a
hamburger from the Oasis. By 2492 the plaques will encircle the Quad.
