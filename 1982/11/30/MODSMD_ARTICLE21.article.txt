## Petty's battle against redundancy continues' Long After Dark' 
### DANNY PEARL Tom Petty Long After Dark Backstreet Records 
People often accuse Tom Petty
of one thing: all his songs sound
the same. And sometimes it really
does seem like he has made a ca
reer out of one basic formula —
songs of romantic disillusion
ment backed by a comfortable,
driving beat and sung in an in
gratiating voice that's halfway
between a nasal sob and a snivel.
But Petty's formula has a lot of
appeal, and it has allowed him
enough freedom to produce
albums with distinct character.
His first album succeeded by
developing two conflicting per
sonas — the bright-eyed all-
American and the sullen, mys
terious renegade. On You're Gon
na Get It, arguably Petty's best
album, the dark, moody tone
pulled him through. On Damn

the Torpedoes, he was saved by
the commercial appeal of the
songs. And on Hard Promises,
the varied subject matter gave the
LP its strength.
Hard Promises was an artistic
breakthrough of sorts for Petty
(as well as a legal breakthrough,
because he won his court battle to
hold down the album's retail
price). It had songs about shady
criminals and stoic security
guards, Old World bazaars and
New World hotel rooms. Plus
two of Petty's most wrenching
breakup songs, two of his best ra
dio hits — "The Waiting" and
"A Thing About You" — and a
stunningly beautiful duet with
Stevie Nicks on "Insider." Petty
was exploring new ideas, and
while the sound was staying the
same, at least it looked like he
was moving in the right direction.
Which brings us to Long After
Dark, Petty's latest effort. The

album is a slight disappointment.
Petty, instead of developing the
lush sound that complements his
Florida swamp-boy voice so well,
reverts to a traditional hard rock
attack. There is more crunching
lead guitar work on this album,
and there's a lot of rtionochord
piano banging. Somehow the
sound doesn't fit; the best songs
on Long After Dark are those
where Benmont Tench's key
boards and Mike Campbell's
guitars are left in the background
for texture.
But what's really wrong with
the album is that Petty's lyrics are
much less engaging than usual.
On past albums he has shown an
uncanny ability to get to the heart
of any powerful emotion with a
few simple words. A lot of his ap
peal is that anyone who's fallen in
or out of love can hear a song like
"Here Comes My Girl" or

"You're Gonna Get It"and hear
their own feelings being de
scribed in all tljeir intensity. But
in Long After .Dark, the words
lack their usual bite; Petty seems
less sure of what he's trying to
say.
Side One is actually quite
good, though, "A One Story
Town" is a fast-paced, confident
romp in the traditional Petty
style: "I'm lost in a one story
town/ where everything's close
to the ground/ yeah the same shit
goes down/ nothing turns
around/ it's a one story town."
(Makes me think of Palo Alto.)
The song is the best one on the
album, and it would have been a
much better choice for single re
lease than "You Got Lucky."
"You Got Lucky" has been
getting a lot of airplay recently.
Personally, I find its soppy syn
thesizers, wobbling guitar and
sobbing vocals a little annoying.

It is the exception to an album
which is otherwise hard
knuckled.
"Deliver "Change of
Heart" are two agreeable enough
tunes which have all of Petty's
simplicity and not enough of his
intensity. They end up sounding
just a little bare, and the uncon
vincing, routine lyrics don't
make things any better.
"Finding Out," which closes
out the side, is one of Petty's
strongest songs ever. Over a hard
adrenalin-laced beat, Petty
launches into an examination of
his past mistakes and present
feelings, using his new lover as a
mirror. "I'm finding out, baby
I'm finding out/ Yeah it took a
little time to get what love was
about." "Finding Out" could be
an anthem for an album in which
Petty seems less certain of what
love is about and more intent on
understanding its uncertainties.
"We Stand a Chance" and
"Straight Into Darkness" are
two songs which sound more like
typical FM hard rock fare than
like Petty compositions. They
have the same well-presented
theme — lovers hurtling them
selves in and out of relationships
without knowing what's ahead.
Neither of them is particularly
thrilling on the musical level,
though.
"The Same Old You" is awful;
it sounds like something a rock
critic could have written (and
that's bad). I'm sure Petty could
have found something better for

an album filler. Or he could have
made the- record three minutes
shorter. . .
"Between* Two Worlds",
sounds-a little tike "The Same
Old You" in a minor key, but it
comes off better. Petty's delivery
makes believable the pain of
fighting sexual attraction. "I
know a- woman's body is only
flesh and bone/ how come 1 can't
let go?'' £o what if half the songs
on the radio are about the same
thing?
"A Wasted Life," the final cut ?
is bound to nauseate some people
with its simplistic refrain ("Don't
have a wasted life/ I love you too
much'"). But I like the song; it's a
fairly pleasant slow tune which
shows Petty in the role of a
wound healer (a nice comple
ment to the wound opener in
"You Got Lucky").
What saves the album is not
the individual songs but the over
all sense of a man caught in un
certainty and confusion.
"There's something wrong/ I
can't put my finger on it/ I must
be looking over something," Pet
ty sings in "Finding Out." In
"Between Two Worlds," Petty is
torn by the conflict between what
he feels and what he wants to feel.
In "Deliver Me," he speaks of
"The times when the heart just
can't understand, the times when
you never can tell." In "We
Stand a Chance," Petty is so
frightened by this uncertainty
i.hat he warns, "Stand back from
me honey/ because I don't know

what 1 might do."
Through most of the album,
Petty presents himself a$ a mian
who is so caught up in the ten
sions between conflicting possi
bilities and feelings that he is will
ing to do anything to break fqee,
even take to the road or willingly
resign himself to his destiny.
The most interesting thing
about Long After Dark is that
Petty is finally struggling ;to
break his fascination wjth ro
mantic pain. Like Elvis Costello,
Petty has been obsessed with
seeing love as revenge and -in
justice, but unlike Costello, Petty
has dwelt on the theme instead of
using it to spark other ideas. The
result is often redundancy. '
But on Long After Dark, Petty
is starting to reject this mdld.
"I've had enough of all this hard
core loneliness/ I don't thjnk
pain is so romantic." Indeed,
there is really only one self-pity
ing song — "You Got Lucky" —
on the album. Of course, poor
Tom doesn't exactly know what
else to sing or think about yet,
which is why there is so much ten
sion and uncertainty on Long Af
ter Dark:
Long After Dark is the work of
a man in transition. The album
itself leaves much to be desired; it
is musically spotty and lyrically
unsatisfying. But it does hold two
of Tom Petty's best songs, and it
has a a disturbed feeling that is
different from anything else he's
ever done. These two things
almost make it worth buying.
