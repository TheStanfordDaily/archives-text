### JEFF SANTOSUOSSO Led Zeppelin Coda Swan Song Records 
It's Christmastime, and Led
Zeppelin, a band defunct for
more than two years, is putting
out a new album. We have been
told that Led Zeppelin would
never record another album.
John Bonham is dead, and Rob
ert Plant has embarked upon a
solo career. So, why did Led Zep
pelin (actually Jimmy Page, the
album's producer) release this
record now? Some say that Page
has wanted to release a previous
ly unreleased "Greatest Hits"
record for some time how. Others
think that he needs to keep busy
(citing his soundtrack for the
world's greatest movie, Death
Wish 11, as evidence). Maybe.
Both of these explanations
carry some weight. Certainly, the
record is a nifty collection of
work that spans Led Zeppelin's
career, a brand-new historical
portrayal of the band, if you will.
All of the songs sound a lot like
the albums with which they were
recorded. So, Coda is a nice little
piece of perspective on one vinyl
slab, but that is the album's big
gest weakness and that's what
makes me so suspicious about it.
There is nothing here that will
make you think of the band in a
new way. Nothing hits you in the
face like Led Zeppelin ll's
"Whole Lotta Love" or "No
body's Fault But Mine," from
Presence.

Nevertheless, the per
formances are strong on all sides.
Plant delivers outstanding vocal
interpretations throughout; ag
gressive on "We're Gonna
Groove," crafty and evocative on
"Poor Tom," and tight and in
command on the live "I Can't
Quit You Baby." His work on
the early chorus repetition of
"Darlene" is so classic a Plant
performance that it's almost
comical.
Jimmy Page is his usually
eclectically dazzling self on near
ly every cut. "We're Gonna
Groove" is dotted with guitar
pieces similar to those found in
Led Zeppelin, Led Zeppelin //,
House of the Holy, and Presence.
His acoustic work on "Poor
Tom" lends the song a
Dickensian imagery that comple
ments Plant's folk balladeering
nicely, and of course, "I Can't
Quit You Baby" delivers that
mandatory Page power-blues.
His production is sharp through
out.
But Page's most intriguing
work is his "electronic treat
ment" of Bonham's drum solo,
"Bonzo's Montreaux." Now,
I'm not one to listen to four
minutes of drumming, but
Bonham and Page do some really
remarkable work here. Bonham
is steady throughout the album
(and brilliant on "Poor Tom"),
as is bassist John Paul Jones, but
with Page's amusement park
treatments, this song is actually
quite interesting.

But the point that there is noth
ing really new on Coda has to be
kept in mind. The album con
cludes with its most boring cut.
"Wearing and Tearing" begins
with some riffs that are borrowed
from "Train Kept A-Rolling"
and continues with some power
chords that surround the vocals
in a way not unlike AC/DC's
"Highway to Hell." And we
know how trite that is. Plant's
frantic vocal work just doesn't
save the song. It is simply a face
less, wasted effort that leaves a
bad final impression.
It seems though, that the ma
jority of the songs are meaningful
and entertaining. "Poo? Tom" is
a very good song. But if "Poor
Tom" is the best song on the rec
ord, it is also all too similar to the
material on Led Zeppelin 111, the
album to which it could have
belonged. I like this song, and
some others, very much. So
what's my gripe? It's not so much
the songs, but rather the whole
idea of the album itself. Undoub
tedly, some people will revel in a
"fresh" taste of Led Zeppelin.
But is more of the same thing nec
essarily better?
None of these songs departs
very much from its associated
album, which left me with a kind
of "So what?" attitude about
Coda. Sure, the songs sound
good, but they don't contribute
to or change my appreciation of
Led Zeppelin. You may feel the
same way. Have your parents
buy you Coda for Christmas.
