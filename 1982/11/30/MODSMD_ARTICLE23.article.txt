# Vickery's Hamlet energetic: BSF's 'Hamlet' impotent

I When we anticipate a Hamlet,
we really anticipate a Hamlet. In
1897, Max Beerbohm said the
part was "a hoop through which
our eminent actors must all
jump." Things have hardly
changed since then. Every Eng
lish speaking actor worth his salt
— whether suited for the part or
not — has had a stab at the part,
as it were. In England, the ten
dency is for every rising repertory
star to essay the role. The results
range from the indelibly classic
(John Gielgud, Laurence Olivier)
to the embarrassing (Derek
Jacobi on BBC-TV). In America,
we tend to put actors who are
either coming from or going to
Hollywood in the role. William
Hurt, Sam Waterston, Stacy
Keach and Christopher Walken
have all attempted the part in re
cent years, with varying degrees
of success. The possibilities are
limitless: Joseph Papp, who once
promised us Robin Williams in
the role, is presenting a female
Hamlet (following in the tradi
tion of Sarah Bernhardt) in New
York this week. As Edwin Booth
remarked, not every actor can
"hit the proper keynote."
How exciting, therefore, to see
an actor who can — an American
" one at that. When John Vickery
~ played Prince Hal in the New
* York Shakespeare Festival's pro
duction of Henry IV, Part One
two summers ago, the New York
* critics praised him as that rare
- find: a fine young actor who was
- at home with classical roles. In
deed, his Prince Hal was direct,
clear, masculine and very excit
ing — a far cry from the per-

Vickery made Hamlet his own with a keen
sense of irony and humor that was personal,
heartfelt and illuminating. Too often, as
with JacobVs Hamlet, the actor latches onto
a series of neuroses which make the part
inactive and unactable. Vickery neatly
vaults over such gimmicky psychological
obstacles.

formances usually found at the
Shakespeare Festival. Vickery
then played four successive lead
ing roles on and off Broadway in
vehicles that were short-lived
through no fault of his own. It is a
treat that he has returned to the
Berkeley Shakespeare Festival to
do his first Hamlet. I had been
waiting for two years to see this
performance. I was not disap
pointed.
The strength of his Hamlet
rested on two main qualities:
clarity and energy. The verse was
spoken sensitively and in
telligently, keeping the com
plicated train of Hamlet's
thought clearly visible. Vickery is
possessed with a panther-like
ferocity and a febrile strength
that always makes him fascinat
ing to watch. He made Hamlet
his own with a keen sense of irony
and humor that was personal,
heart-felt and illuminating. Too
often, as with Jacobi's Hamlet,
the actor latches on to a series of
neuroses which make the part in
active and unactable. Vickery
neatly vaults over such gimmicky

psychological obstacles.
Yet one thing that his per
formance reinforces is that, for
all our interest in the main char
acter, Hamlet is by no means a
one-man play. It becomes in
creasingly apparent throughout
the evening that Vickery has been
set adrift by the director and by
his supporting cast. The director,
Richard White, has done an in
teresting job of setting the stage
in an arena style. The square-on
edge set is surrounded by four
scaffolding pillars, each
crammed with trash bags, vari
ous stage props, curtains and cos
tumes. This half-baked concept
of Hamlet as an improvised play
within-a-play is carelessly but
mercifully abandoned after the
first 10 minutes. What also be
comes apparent after 10 minutes
is that Vickery isn't going to get a
good fight from anybody.
It would be presumptuous to
explain what Hamlet is about,
but it is possible to say what
Hamlet needs. Hamlet, faced
with the grief of his father's death
and his mother's remarriage, is
brought face-to-face with a larger
problem — an exhortation from
his father's ghost to revenge his
murder. Can Hamlet believe the

ghost? Can he accomplish the re
venge physically and morally?
While Hamlet is battling his soul,
another battle is going on. The
state — Claudius, Gertrude,
Polonious — is fortifying itself
against Hamlet, first by inquiring
into his madness by using his
loved ones as spies, and then, ul
timately, by ordering his execu
tion. These are dangerous,
capable people. This sense of po
litical conspiracy and duplicity
makes Hamlet very modern. (I
thought that the first scene, with
the soldiers in Khaki trench coats
and berets might be the begin
ning of an attempt to emphasize
this. It was not).
Here, the balance between the
internal and external obstacles is
hopelessly out of whack.
Claudius and Gertrude are but
ciphers in this production, prov
ing that, respectively, standing
straight and crying are not ex
cuses for acting. The Polonius
was given the worst possible
course of all: instead of behaving
like a prime minister, he behaves
like a candy store owner — he
cannot be taken seriously for a
moment. The director seems to
have given up altogether on
Ophelia. She is costumed to look
like a piece of Tupperware and
her mad scene gave me the worst
case of giggles I can ever re
member having. Only Gail
Ghugg as the ghost and Michael
McShane as the gravedigger rise
above the rest of the cast. They
give Vickery the few moments of
interaction in the play he so badly
needs. It is not surprising that
these are two of his best scenes.
The long stretch in the fourth
act where Hamlet is off to Eng
land was grim indeed, and when
Vickery returned for the fifth act,
there was an audible sigh of re
lief. This act contained many of
his best moments. He achieves a
resolute calm that makes the
"readiness is all" speech very
moving. Yet, even here he is the
victim of some bad cutting,
which may be the production's
second major liability. Hamlet is
robbed of many of his more
philosophical moments (such as

the "dram of evil" speech) in the
first two acts, which not only
takes an important dimension
out of his character, but also
makes the more philosophical
speeches in the last part of the
play downright incongruous.
Still, the play finishes with a
cracking good swordfight, which
is not only intricate and original,
but more illuminating than many
of the performances.
It is said of the part of King

Lear that an actor must do it
twice — the first time as a sort of
dry-run. Laurence Olivier will
soon be doing his second Lear —
the first being over 30 years ago
— on television. Many Hamlets
— Gislgud's, Olivier's, Bar

rymorc's — have been done on
several occasions. I have no
doubt that John Vickery will be
one of our greatest American ac
tors. His dress rehearsal of
Hamlet is playing at Berkeley un
til December 19. If you want to
say you saw him "when," by all
means go. He will play Hamlet
again, perhaps in a production
that will utilize more of his con
siderable skills by giving him
more to work off.
