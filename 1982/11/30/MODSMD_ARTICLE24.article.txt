# George Harrison isn't that bad, he's just forgetful (and forgettable)
## 
### STEFAN MALMOLI 
I do recall a time in musical
history when there was a highly
praised guitarist in an even more
highly praised band. I remember
that guitarist's direct imitation of
Chuck Berry and Carl Perkins. I
remember that guitarist thor
oughly giving his whole body and
mind to strum out a few beau
tifully crisp guitar solos. No long
played-out jams, of course; just
perfectly placed guitar breaks.
Yet, immediately after that
band's demise (and after only one
truly classic solo album), that
guitarist slowly transformed
himself into a musician who had
forgotten his roots. Seemingly,
he had forgotten what uplifting,
moving rock music was all about,
besides a few intriguing songs,
the guitarist's output over the last
10 years has been a drastic rebut
tal of all that he had ac
complished in the past.
The answer to this musical
"What's My Line?" is George
Harrison, who for those who
have forgotten, used to be lead
guitarist for the Beatles (Oh, now
you remember!). Yes, George
Harrison, a once - inspiring
guitarist and songwriter, has had
a somewhat uninspiring solo ca
reer. Sure, his guitar playing on
his solo albums has been impec
cable and flawless, but it is not
musically stimulating or interest
ing. It is perfectly played, but it
has no lasting force or life. In ad
dition, Harrison developed a fine
songwriting ability in the later
Beatles years ("While My Guitar
Gently Weeps"; "Here Comes
The Sun"), and even on All

Things Must Pass (that first clas
sic solo album previously alluded
to), his songwriting was still
peaking. However, since that re
lease (in late 1970), Harrison
completely lost touch with his
musical roots and with his con
temporary musical influences
(i.e. Eric Clapton and Keith
Richards). Instead, he opted out
for Krishna and spiritual themes
to replace his writing and playing
abilities. Although God may be
more moving than the soul for
some, He doesn't fare too well on
albums in comparison to a good
song.
In the face of all these facts,
George Harrison has just re
leased a new solo album, which is
humorously entitled Gone Trop
po. To add to this amusing at
mosphere, is the album's inner
sleeve that has directions on how
to make cement, along with pro
claiming sarcastically "This
album has been a cement mix!".
It seems that Harrison through
his long association (both per
sonally and financially) with the
Monty Python Troupe, has final
ly allowed his droll, eccentric
English humor to permeate the
album (as opposed to his Indian
spiritual dogma). The results mu
sically, therefore, are far more
appealing and acceptable al
though there is still much lacking
overall.
On the positive side, Harrison
allows humor and an airy light
headedness to infuse his songs.
The title track is a silly but laugh
able tune that includes some cute
puns ("Brown skin and very a
peeling") in its slight spoof of

Sure, his guitar playing on his solo
albums has been impeccable and
flawless, but it is not musically
stimulating or interesting. It is
perfectly played, but it has no
lasting force or life.

reggae. Equally amusing is the
theme from the Monty Python
film, "Time Bandits," which was
financed by Harrison. On this
one, "Dream Away," Harrison
has written a song that you can
actually sing along with and
bounde a foot to (It's been so long
since he's written such a catchy
pop tune that this seems like a
revolutionary musical venture!).
Elsewhere on the album, Har
rison recalls a few pointers he
learned when he was truly a musi
cal force. On "Wake Up My
Love," which is the opening up
beat tune, Harrison adds some
bite and real emotion to the vo
cal. On previous albums, Har
rison let his already limited voice
sound weak, bored and insincere.
However, here he lets his voice
reach the shouting level, especial
ly in his expressing a very person
al viewpoint of his life in general
— "My life's been so many ways;
Too much darkness gets me

crazed; All around us people
fight; Christ, I'm looking for
some light!". In addition to this
improvement with his vocals,
Harrison also shows some emo
tional life in his guitar playing.
On "Circles," Harrison adds a
haunting slide guitar effect that is
reminiscent of his better days.
However, although Harrison
does make these attempts to im
prove his musical direction and
quality, he inevitably fails on
many occasions. His musical in
stincts are extremely deficient in
his choice of covering an oldie.
Instead of returning to his Chuck
Berry roots, he digs up a
wretched remake of a 1961 do
wop hit, "I Really Love You."
Above all though, the main prob
lem is still in his lackluster guitar
playing. Besides "Circles," the
majority of the album consists of
the low-key, un-eventful playing
that has weighted down his solo
albums. For he whose whose tal
ent was enormous, this is a great
misfortune.
Overall, at least the album
shows Harrison is trying. He just
forgets at times where he is com
ing from and where he is going to.
However, even though I criticize
this album, one cannot fully dis
miss George Harrison. His past
accomplishments still warranf in
terest in his present-day material.
He gave so much at one time that
one cannot ask for much more
from him. As he self-consciously
states, "They say I'm not what I
used to be; All the same, I'm hap
pier than a willow." Now who
can criticize that?

reggae. Equally amusing is the
theme from the Monty Python
film, "Time Bandits," which was
financed by Harrison. On this
one, "Dream Away," Harrison
has written a song that you can
actually sing along with and
bounde a foot to (It's been so long
since he's written such a catchy
pop tune that this seems like a
revolutionary musical venture!).
Elsewhere on the album, Har
rison recalls a few pointers he
learned when he was truly a musi
cal force. On "Wake Up My
Love," which is the opening up
beat tune, Harrison adds some
bite and real emotion to the vo
cal. On previous albums, Har
rison let his already limited voice
sound weak, bored and insincere.
However, here he lets his voice
reach the shouting level, especial
ly in his expressing a very person
al viewpoint of his life in general
— "My life's been so many ways;
Too much darkness gets me

crazed; All around us people
fight; Christ, I'm looking for
some light!". In addition to this
improvement with his vocals,
Harrison also shows some emo
tional life in his guitar playing.
On "Circles," Harrison adds a
haunting slide guitar effect that is
reminiscent of his better days.
However, although Harrison
does make these attempts to im
prove his musical direction and
quality, he inevitably fails on
many occasions. His musical in
stincts are extremely deficient in
his choice of covering an oldie.
Instead of returning to his Chuck
Berry roots, he digs up a
wretched remake of a 1961 do
wop hit, "I Really Love You."
Above all though, the main prob
lem is still in his lackluster guitar
playing. Besides "Circles," the
majority of the album consists of
the low-key, un-eventful playing
that has weighted down his solo
albums. For he whose whose tal
ent was enormous, this is a great
misfortune.
Overall, at least the album
shows Harrison is trying. He just
forgets at times where he is com
ing from and where he is going to.
However, even though I criticize
this album, one cannot fully dis
miss George Harrison. His past
accomplishments still warranf in
terest in his present-day material.
He gave so much at one time that
one cannot ask for much more
from him. As he self-consciously
states, "They say I'm not what I
used to be; All the same, I'm hap
pier than a willow." Now who
can criticize that?


I do recall a time in musical
history when there was a highly
praised guitarist in an even more
highly praised band. I remember
that guitarist's direct imitation of
Chuck Berry and Carl Perkins. I
remember that guitarist thor
oughly giving his whole body and
mind to strum out a few beau
tifully crisp guitar solos. No long
played-out jams, of course; just
perfectly placed guitar breaks.
Yet, immediately after that
band's demise (and after only one
truly classic solo album), that
guitarist slowly transformed
himself into a musician who had
forgotten his roots. Seemingly,
he had forgotten what uplifting,
moving rock music was all about,
besides a few intriguing songs,
the guitarist's output over the last
10 years has been a drastic rebut
tal of all that he had ac
complished in the past.
The answer to this musical
"What's My Line?" is George
Harrison, who for those who
have forgotten, used to be lead
guitarist for the Beatles (Oh, now
you remember!). Yes, George
Harrison, a once - inspiring
guitarist and songwriter, has had
a somewhat uninspiring solo ca
reer. Sure, his guitar playing on
his solo albums has been impec
cable and flawless, but it is not
musically stimulating or interest
ing. It is perfectly played, but it
has no lasting force or life. In ad
dition, Harrison developed a fine
songwriting ability in the later
Beatles years ("While My Guitar
Gently Weeps"; "Here Comes
The Sun"), and even on All

Things Must Pass (that first clas
sic solo album previously alluded
to), his songwriting was still
peaking. However, since that re
lease (in late 1970), Harrison
completely lost touch with his
musical roots and with his con
temporary musical influences
(i.e. Eric Clapton and Keith
Richards). Instead, he opted out
for Krishna and spiritual themes
to replace his writing and playing
abilities. Although God may be
more moving than the soul for
some, He doesn't fare too well on
albums in comparison to a good
song.
In the face of all these facts,
George Harrison has just re
leased a new solo album, which is
humorously entitled Gone Trop
po. To add to this amusing at
mosphere, is the album's inner
sleeve that has directions on how
to make cement, along with pro
claiming sarcastically "This
album has been a cement mix!".
It seems that Harrison through
his long association (both per
sonally and financially) with the
Monty Python Troupe, has final
ly allowed his droll, eccentric
English humor to permeate the
album (as opposed to his Indian
spiritual dogma). The results mu
sically, therefore, are far more
appealing and acceptable al
though there is still much lacking
overall.
On the positive side, Harrison
allows humor and an airy light
headedness to infuse his songs.
The title track is a silly but laugh
able tune that includes some cute
puns ("Brown skin and very a
