# Key vacancy in Office of Development
## University must fill three posts 
### first In a series By DAVID AZRIN Senior staff writer 
When three out of its 10 top officers resign in a matter of
months, any administration would enter a state of flux. With
two vice-presidents and the dean of a major school gone or
due to leave early next year, this is just the situation the Uni
versity is now trying to resolve.
Early last June, Joel Smith, vice-president for Develop
ment, resigned his post after a long medical absence. Later in
the month, Rene McPherson, dean of the School of Busi
ness, also submitted a letter, of resignation due to medical
reasons. More recently. Bob Rosenzweig, vice-president for
Public Affairs, announced his intention leave the University
to take the job of president of the American Association of
Universities.
Suddenly, the administration had three positions to fill.
One of the most important of these posts is that of the vice
president for Development.
University fundraising is handled solely by the Office of
Development and provides a major source of University rev
enue. The Development Office collected $77 million in gifts
last year, down from a record $79 million the previous year,
and hopes to collect $80-81 million this year, according to
John Hays, director of the Annual Fund and Major Gifts.
"There is no question that the success of this office reflects
the strengths and the skill of the vice president," Hays said.
The Office of Development has been in a particularly un
stable position because the previous top administrator,
Smith, was unable to remain at the job until a new vice presi

dent could be chosen. Smith resigned the post in early June
due to a diagnosed "clinical depression." Soon after, Bruce
Hinchliffe, former head of the corporate relations division of
the office, was appointed acting vice-president.
Some staff members said the lack of a permanent vice
president has caused a sense of instability within the office.
"We would really like to have somebody make a decision
so everything wouldn't be so up in the air," one employee
said. "It is sort of an unstable feeling," she said.
"It'll be good to get a permanent V.P. appointed," said
Hinchliffe. "It will provide a greater sense of stability."
A seven-member search aommitus appointed by Univer
sity President Donald Kennedy has narrowed its list of can
didates for the post to about 100 names and the committee
hopes make a final decision by early winter quarter, accord
ing to committee Vice-chair Raymond Bachetti.
"What Stanford usually does when there is a postion of
this importance in the University is to canvass the country to
make sure we get the candidate with the best of a broad range
of abilities," Bacchetti said.
The committee has finished the first phase of the search,
which consists of collecting a list of all possible candidates
from nominations and applications, according to staff com
mitte member John Hughes.
"The second phase is narrowing that pool and that's what
we've just started doing," Hughes said.
The present list of candidates includes development pro
fessionals, academic affairs officers and alumni and Stan
ford volunteers, according to an internal memo.
