Gemayel asks for more peacekeepers
Beirut — President Amin Gemayel, meeting with representatives of the
United States, France and Italy, yesterday formally requested the expansion
of the multinational force that is helping to restore order in his country.
In August, the multinational force assisted in the evacuation of the
Palestine Liberation Organization guerrillas trapped here by the Israelis.
The force returned in September, after Israel had invaded West Beirut and
Christian militiamen had slaughtered hundreds of Palestinian refugees.
The state-run Voice of Lebanon radio station said yesterday afternoon
that Gemayel made the request at a meeting with the French and Italian am
bassadors and U.S. diplomat Christopher Ross. Ross is the assistant to U.S.
special envoy Morris Draper.
The size of the force Gemayel is seeking was not specified, although
Gemayel has said that he needs as many as 30,000 troops to restore order in
the country. There are now about 4000 American, French and Italian troops
in Lebanon.
"We're certainly studying it, but we have not made a response yet," Ross
said of the request.
"The president (of Lebanon) asked that more troops be sent in to help the
Lebanese army spread its authority and end the turmoil in the mountains
and other parts of Lebanon," the broadcast said.
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Chafik Wazzan, after a Cabinet meeting yes
terday, said that Lebanon would not be subjected to "blackmail" as at
tempts continued to begin negotiations about the withdrawal of foreign
troops from his country.
Despite the efforts of Draper and U.S. envoy Philip Habib, Israel and
Lebanon have been virtually deadlocked on the nature of the negotiations.
Evidence of Soviet gas attacks
Washington — The administration said yesterday it has physical evidence,
including a gas mask pulled from the head of a dead Soviet soldier, that the
Soviet Union has used chemical weapons against guerrillas in Afghanistan
since 1980.
A panel of U.S. government experts headed by Robert Dean, deputy di
rector of the State Department's politico-military affairs bureau, said that
two Soviet-made gas masks obtained in Afghanistan were contaminated
with man-made toxins, including one derived from man-made fungus
growths similar to the lethal "yellow rain" previously reported to have been
used in Southeast Asia;
Gary Crocker of the State Department said the second mask, which was
displayed at a news briefing, was obtained in "a special operation" in Kabul.
He declined to say how either mask came into U.S. hands.
The department asserted, too, that Moscow is continuing to supply
chemical and toxin weapons for use by its Vietnamese and Laotian allies in
Cambodia and Laos, with even a few attacks in Thailand.
Also displayed at the briefing were photographs of a Laotian H'Mong boy
who suffered severe bums and blistering following a "yellow rain" attack in
late March or early April. The boy, who survived following treatment, was
photographed by a U.S. official at a refugee camp in northeast Thailand.
The total killed in chemical and toxin attacks is
more than 6000 in Laos, 3000 in Afghanistan and
1000 in Cambodia, officials said.
Dean said the Soviets deny using the weapons.
"We have raised this repeatedly with the Soviets,
and their response is to deny it,"he said.
B-52 explodes on runway
Merced, Calif. — An Air Force B-52 exploded at
the end of a runway at Castle Air Force Base Mon
day, creating a flash that was visible for up to 20
miles, authorities reported.
The nine-member crew was safely evacuated
prior to the 5:22 p.m. PST explosion, according to
Capt. Ava House, who said she was not cleared to
provide further information immediately.
Maj. Leo Vrana said the Stratofortress bomber
was burning at the end of the runway and that fire
crews from the base, located about 90 miles south
east of San Francisco, were battling the flames.
"The crew was evacuated prior to the explosion
and they are safe. Other details are not known at
this time," said House. "A board of Air Force of
ficers will investigate the accident, and details will
be provided as soon as they become available."
House said she could not say whether the plane
was carrying nuclear warheads.
The plane reportedly was at the end of a training
mission and was on the ground when the explosion
occurred. The bombers routinely fly out of the base
on training missions.
USSR attacks deployment
Moscow — The Soviet news agency Novosti said
last night that the deployment of new medium
range American nuclear missiles in Western Eu
rope would force the Soviet Union to switch to an
"instantaneous" retaliatory posture. The so-called
"launch on warning" would prompt a Soviet coun
terstrike if monitoring equipment signals a U.S. at
tack.
The agency said the deployment of 572 Pershing
II and cruise missiles in Western Europe scheduled
to begin at the end of 1983 would create a new
strategic situation. Their proximity to Soviet
borders "rules out the possibility of preventing a
conflict, should one be started, by nonmilitary
means."
Although it did not use the term "launch on
warning," the Novosti article clearly referred to
the concept that is used by the / mericans.
Yesterday's article went further in specifying
Moscow's response than any previous Soviet pro
nouncement on the subject. Western diplomats
noted, however, that it coincided with the sched
uled NATO defense ministers' meeting in Brussels
this week and that it may be designed to scare West
European and American public opinion.
Stockman foresees record deficit
Washington — Budget Director David Stock

man's latest estimate shows a budget deficit for the
current fiscal year of between $180 and $190
billion, higher than any previous administration
forecast, government sources said Monday.
Sources said Stockman's estimate, already pre
sented to President Reagan and his closest White
House aides, assumes an economy expanding at
the rate of about 3 percent next year. Without the
recovery, the deficit presumably could balloon
even higher.
These sources, who asked not to be identified by
name, also said Stockman's estimates show deficits
rising to between $ 185 and $ 190 billion for the next
fiscal year, and over $200 billion in 1985.
' For the years beyond, deficits of $250 billion or
more are likely, sources familiar with Stockman's
estimates said.
Conference disappoints U.S.
Geneva, Switzerland — An 88-nation trade con
ference yesterday dashed U.S. hopes of phasing
out Common Market farm subsidies and winning
Third World concessions on trade barriers, ap
proving a final declaration that skirted both issues.
"Overall, the results might get a grade of C,"
said U.S. trade representative William Brock. "I
don't think Congress will be happy."
After five days of grueling and at times bitter ne
gotiations, delegates from nations subscribing to
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
(GATT) voted early Monday for a 3,000-word
document that endorses GATT principles of free
and open trade.
The vote came in a plenary session that ori
ginally was scheduled for Saturday, but was re
peatedly delayed to avoid having the conference
end without making any kind of joint declaration.
The compromise document, watered down in
marathon bargaining over the weekend, com
mitted GATT members to "resist" protectionist
trade barriers erected to protect weak domestic in
dustries.
But, under objections from the Common Mar
ket and elsewhere, it dropped a previous draft's
pledge to "refrain" from protectionism, as well as a
U.S.-backed text that would have called for "dis
mantling" existing protectionist measures.
Court says no to Nixon
Washington — The Supreme Court rejected yes
terday the attempt by Richard Nixon to block pub
lic access to his White House tapes, meaning Amer
icans will be able to listen in, as early as 1984, to
most of the recorded conversations through 216
years of his presidency.
The decision applies to thousands of hours of
Oval Office talks not related to the Watergate scan
dal that drove Nixon from office eight years ago.
As plans now stand, the tapes may be played for
the public at eleven listening centers across the na
tion.
Nick Ruwe, a spokesman for Nixon in New

York, said the former president had no comment
on the decision.
Steel output slumps
Now York — Steel production plunged to its
lowest level in at least 20 years last week, with plant
use in the beleaguered industry at a 50-year low,
the American Iron and Steel Institute reported yes
terday.

duced 915,000 tons in the week ended Nov. 27, a
13.3 percent decrease from the previous week's
1.055 million tons.

group began keeping such records in 1962, drop
ping below the previous weekly low 0f947,000 tons
in the week ended Aug. 7,1971.
Stocks post moderate decline
New York — Stock prices gave ground Monday,
set back by rising open-market interest rates.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up
more than 16 points in the two previous sessions,
dropped 4.51 to 1,002.85, and most other in
dicators showed similar moderate declines.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange to
taled 61.08 million shares, up from 38.81 in Fri
day's post-holiday session.
