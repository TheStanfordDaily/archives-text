Gemayel asks for more peacekeepers
Beirut — President Amin Gemayel, meeting with representatives of the
United States, France and Italy, yesterday formally requested the expansion
of the multinational force that is helping to restore order in his country.
In August, the multinational force assisted in the evacuation of the
Palestine Liberation Organization guerrillas trapped here by the Israelis.
The force returned in September, after Israel had invaded West Beirut and
Christian militiamen had slaughtered hundreds of Palestinian refugees.
The state-run Voice of Lebanon radio station said yesterday afternoon
that Gemayel made the request at a meeting with the French and Italian am
bassadors and U.S. diplomat Christopher Ross. Ross is the assistant to U.S.
special envoy Morris Draper.
The size of the force Gemayel is seeking was not specified, although
Gemayel has said that he needs as many as 30,000 troops to restore order in
the country. There are now about 4000 American, French and Italian troops
in Lebanon.
"We're certainly studying it, but we have not made a response yet," Ross
said of the request.
"The president (of Lebanon) asked that more troops be sent in to help the
Lebanese army spread its authority and end the turmoil in the mountains
and other parts of Lebanon," the broadcast said.
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Chafik Wazzan, after a Cabinet meeting yes
terday, said that Lebanon would not be subjected to "blackmail" as at
tempts continued to begin negotiations about the withdrawal of foreign
troops from his country.
Despite the efforts of Draper and U.S. envoy Philip Habib, Israel and
Lebanon have been virtually deadlocked on the nature of the negotiations.
Evidence of Soviet gas attacks
Washington — The administration said yesterday it has physical evidence,
including a gas mask pulled from the head of a dead Soviet soldier, that the
Soviet Union has used chemical weapons against guerrillas in Afghanistan
since 1980.
A panel of U.S. government experts headed by Robert Dean, deputy di
rector of the State Department's politico-military affairs bureau, said that
two Soviet-made gas masks obtained in Afghanistan were contaminated
with man-made toxins, including one derived from man-made fungus
growths similar to the lethal "yellow rain" previously reported to have been
used in Southeast Asia;
Gary Crocker of the State Department said the second mask, which was
displayed at a news briefing, was obtained in "a special operation" in Kabul.
He declined to say how either mask came into U.S. hands.
The department asserted, too, that Moscow is continuing to supply
chemical and toxin weapons for use by its Vietnamese and Laotian allies in
Cambodia and Laos, with even a few attacks in Thailand.
Also displayed at the briefing were photographs of a Laotian H'Mong boy
who suffered severe bums and blistering following a "yellow rain" attack in
late March or early April. The boy, who survived following treatment, was
photographed by a U.S. official at a refugee camp in northeast Thailand.
