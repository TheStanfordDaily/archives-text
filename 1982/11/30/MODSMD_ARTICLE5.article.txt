# Foreign student population rises

Fifteen percent of all students here
are foreign this year, a rise of 4 percent
over last year, according to Lee Zeigler,
director of the Bechtel International
Center.
Members of the administration cite
everything from the University's in
ternational reputation to the rising cost
for Americans of an education here in
explaining this situation.
Asians accounted for nearly all of the
increase, composing 791 of the 2052
foreign students. Zeigler said there was
also a "significant increase" in the
number of foreign female students, who
now comprise 20 percent of the foreign
enrollment.
Nearly one-fourth of the University's
graduate students are foreign, as is
more than one-third of the postdoctoral
population. Among undergraduates,
only 4 percent are foreign.
The School of Engineering has the
greatest number, 771, and the greatest
percentage, 29, of foreign students
among schools here. Within the school,
the greatest percentage of any depart
ment is in the Department of Engineer
ing- Economic Systems, which has 41.5

percent foreign students. Materials Sci
ence follows closely behind with 40.2
percent.
The School of Humanities and Sci
ences has the next greatest number of
foreign students, with 500. The Food
Research Institute contains the greatest
percentage of foreign students in a ma
jor program, with 50.1 percent.
Canada sends the most students here
(171), followed by Taiwan (152), Japan
(148) and Mexico (122).
Foreign student enrollment is up 6
percent nationally, which indicates that
the trend is a national one, according to
the Institute of International Educa
tion. It said that this is the eighth
straight year that foreign student en
rollment increased in the United States.
By 1990 the number of students from
countries other than the United States
is expected to reach 500,000, or roughly
5 percent of all college students.
Perry McCarty, chairman of the Civil
Engineering Department, said foreign
students generally have more funds
available than Americans, and thus are
more inclined to choose to go to a
school as expensive as the University is.
He said that if you're American,"lf you
don't have the money to go to a private

school, you can go to a public one,"
whereas "the foreign students having
their own money have a bigger selec
tion."
Niloo Farhad, an Iranian masters
student in Chemical Engineering, said
she chose to come here because it, "is
more well-known" and that "there are
only 10 universities approved by the
Iranian government, and one is Stan
ford." She also said that the number of
Iranians already living in California at
tracts Iranian students here. Farhad is
funded by her family.
Kee Sok, a Korean doctoral can
didate in Computer Science, said he
' heard about the University from other
Koreans who had studied here. John
Kim, also from Korea and a doctoral
candidate in Materials Science, said
that in Korea one "has a list of schools
he can go to and then he chooses ran
domly." Kim is also funded by his fami
ly, and said that he plans on returning
to his country after he graduates "to ad
vance the technology in Korea."
McCarty said that civil engineering
attracts many foreign students because,
"In countries that are developing, there
has always been a need for civil engi
neers. In the U.S. the demand for civil
engineers is relatively constant." He
said that in the United States civil engi
neers are mainly concerned with main
tenance, whereas in many nations they

concentrate on building new structures.
Zeigler said the great gap in per
centages between foreign graduate ver
sus undergraduate students occurs be
cause, "at the undergraduate level stu
dents are competing with American stu
dents and so they have to have had Eng
lish and have to have records of
achievement which make them eligible
to apply."
