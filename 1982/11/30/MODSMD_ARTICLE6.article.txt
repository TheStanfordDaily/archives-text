# New policy may increase graduate tuition
## 
### KATHERINE HUTT Staff writer 
A proposal to change the current system of regis
tration for graduate students holding teaching and
research assistantships that may raise fees is under
consideration by the Committee on Graduate Stud
ies (C-GS), and is expected to be approved by the
committee on Dec. 15.
Under two present registration programs, Ad
vanced Graduate Registration (AGR) and Terminal
Graduate Registration (TGR), a doctoral candidate
who has been a full-time student for three years is
eligible to register at a reduced cost.
The old policy, in effect for students who began
graduate study before 1977, allowed students who
had completed the residence requirement of three
years of study and who had fulfilled all course re
quirements for the degree to register TGR for only
$100 per quarter.
The policy that will replace it requires students
who have fulfilled the residence requirement but not
yet completed all of the course requirements for a

degree to register for three quarters of half-tuition,
known as AGR, before becoming eligible to register
TGR.
The problem with the new policy, according to C
GS member and fifth-year economics doctoral can
didate Eric Berg, is that greater cost is born by stu
dents who have paid their tuition by working as
teaching assistants (TAs) or research assistants
(RAs) and avoided by those who have received fel
lowship support.
Students who hold regular assistantship appoint
ments as TAs or RAs register for nine units of credit
per quarter, instead of the usual IS, and thus barely
meet the residence requirement at the end of four
years. In their fifth year they are then faced with
three quarters of half-tuition, and are no longer
eligible to receive support as an RA or a TA.
According to descriptions by doctoral candidates
from different departments, the current policy has a
greater effect on some departments than others.
Martin Berg, a second year Mechanical Engineering

Ph.D. candidate, said he has been told that he will be
supported for the four years that it will take him to
complete his degree program by working as an RA.
According to Dennis Florig, a fifth-year political
science Ph.D. candidate, the average length of time
to complete a Ph.D. in his department is 6years, and
financial support is usually guaranteed for four
years of this.
"The expectation is that you will have advanced
far enough in the profession by the time you have
finished four years of the program that you will be
able to find alternate sources of funding," whether
your own research, grant, your advisor's grant or
through teaching, said Florig.
Members of the CS-G refused to comment on the
nature of the proposed changes in the graduate reg
istration system.
"We're at the very early stage of looking at a pre
liminary document," according to Chair of C-GS
Paul Robinson.
