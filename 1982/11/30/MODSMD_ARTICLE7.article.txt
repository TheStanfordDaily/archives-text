# Initial reaction to ODUS reorganization optimistic
## 
### KAREN SPRINGEN 
Administrators are mostly pleased
with the results so far of the con
troversial dissolution of the Office of
the Dean of Undergraduate Studies an
nounced last spring.
Last May the University split the re
sponsibilities of the Office of the Dean
of Undergraduate Studies (ODUS) in
an effort to ease the tension between the
office's conflicting managerial and ad
vocacy demands.
As a result, ODUS' duties are divided
between an associate dean for under
graduate programs in Humanities and
Sciences, Carolyn Lougee, who handles
most of ODUS' managerial and day-to
day functions, and a vice-provost for
undergraduate education, Herant
Katchadourian, responsible for ad
vocating undergraduate interests.
And how does the change seem to be
working? ,
Norman Wessells, dean of Human
ities and Sciences, said he is "very

pleased" with the redistribution of
duties.
And Katchadourian, former head of
ODUS, said, "I think the reorganiza
tion has worked out quite well ... In
retrospect it was a wise move."
Katchadourian formerly served as
dean and vice-provost. But when he re
turns from sabbatical winter quarter,
the vice-provost position will be his
only administrative responsibility.
"The important difference is that I
am going to be a half-time adminis
trator," he said. The remainder of the
time Katchadourian will teach under
graduate courses, including Human
Sexuality.
This year the associate dean of Hu
manities and Sciences manages extra
departmental programs such as
SCIRE, SWOPSI, Individually De
signed Majors and Undergraduate Spe
cials.
But Wessells said, "No, I don't feel
it's put too much of a burden on u»." He

attributed this to Lougee. "In three
months she's performing like a very ex
perienced dean." Wessells said. "There
are some wonderful people running
those organizations," he added.
Directors of the programs formerly
administrated by ODUS, such as the
Academic Information Center (AIC),
the Learning Assistance Center (LAC),
SWOPSI, SCIRE and Undergraduate
Specials, feared the reorganization
might result in budget cutbacks. But
Wessells said these programs would be
cut back "no more than anything else
... The whole question is how the Uni
versity is going to come up with a reduc
tion in its base budget."
Andre Burnett, co-director of
SWOPSI, said, "We've been assured
that the financial situation is not getting
rid of programs."
Elaine Holliman, co-director of
SWOPSI, said, "There hasn't been
much definitive action taken."
She said the University's statements

arc sometimes contradictory: "They do
not want to cut back on programs, but
they want to cut back on labor and
staff."
Judy Adams, co-director of SCIRE,
said, "There are lots of unknowns at
this time." Bui she said, "H & S has
tried to see that they could help us."
The reorganization has the potential
to result in for SCIRE "a closer associa
tion with faculty," Adams said. For ex
ample, SCIRE could connect with fac
ulty for its internship program. But she
said, "We can't offer any incentive
(salary)."
Adams cited the importance ofextra
departmental programs as
"birthplaces" for currently well-estab
lished programs that did not fit under a
specific department. As the University
becomes more austere, she said, extra
departmental programs may become a
better testing ground.
Laura Selznick, director of Under
graduate Specials, said, for example,
that Katchadourian developed Human
Sexuality as a SWOPSI course.
Selznick said Wessells supports
"some high-risk, high-gain programs."
The University decided at the begin
ning of the month to end the position of
assistant dean, held by Beverly Scott.
Her position will end in June. "It's stan
dard," she said of her dismissal. "I
don't know what they plan to do."

Barbara Hook, student assistant at
the LAC, said a review committee ha 4 s
been formed to determine the future of
the assistance center.
Last spring an ad-hoc committee in
cluding Provost and Vice President A 1
Hastorf, Katchadourian, Gerald
Lieberman, dean of graduate studies
and research, Wessells and six other i«-
sued a new report. "The notion of one
dean ... remains very attractive in the
abstract... (But) the tasks of (ODUS)
are so many and so diverse as to be in
tcmally inconsistent," the report said, i

assistant dean, held by Beverly Scott.
Her position will end in June. "It's stan
dard," she said of her dismissal. "I
don't know what they plan to do."

Barbara Hook, student assistant at
the LAC, said a review committee ha 4 s
been formed to determine the future of
the assistance center.
Last spring an ad-hoc committee in
cluding Provost and Vice President A 1
Hastorf, Katchadourian, Gerald
Lieberman, dean of graduate studies
and research, Wessells and six other i«-
sued a new report. "The notion of one
dean ... remains very attractive in the
abstract... (But) the tasks of (ODUS)
are so many and so diverse as to be in
tcmally inconsistent," the report said, i
Administrators are mostly pleased
with the results so far of the con
troversial dissolution of the Office of
the Dean of Undergraduate Studies an
nounced last spring.
Last May the University split the re
sponsibilities of the Office of the Dean
of Undergraduate Studies (ODUS) in
an effort to ease the tension between the
office's conflicting managerial and ad
vocacy demands.
As a result, ODUS' duties are divided
between an associate dean for under
graduate programs in Humanities and
Sciences, Carolyn Lougee, who handles
most of ODUS' managerial and day-to
day functions, and a vice-provost for
undergraduate education, Herant
Katchadourian, responsible for ad
vocating undergraduate interests.
And how does the change seem to be
working? ,
Norman Wessells, dean of Human
ities and Sciences, said he is "very

pleased" with the redistribution of
duties.
And Katchadourian, former head of
ODUS, said, "I think the reorganiza
tion has worked out quite well ... In
retrospect it was a wise move."
Katchadourian formerly served as
dean and vice-provost. But when he re
turns from sabbatical winter quarter,
the vice-provost position will be his
only administrative responsibility.
"The important difference is that I
am going to be a half-time adminis
trator," he said. The remainder of the
time Katchadourian will teach under
graduate courses, including Human
Sexuality.
This year the associate dean of Hu
manities and Sciences manages extra
departmental programs such as
SCIRE, SWOPSI, Individually De
signed Majors and Undergraduate Spe
cials.
But Wessells said, "No, I don't feel
it's put too much of a burden on u»." He

attributed this to Lougee. "In three
months she's performing like a very ex
perienced dean." Wessells said. "There
are some wonderful people running
those organizations," he added.
Directors of the programs formerly
administrated by ODUS, such as the
Academic Information Center (AIC),
the Learning Assistance Center (LAC),
SWOPSI, SCIRE and Undergraduate
Specials, feared the reorganization
might result in budget cutbacks. But
Wessells said these programs would be
cut back "no more than anything else
... The whole question is how the Uni
versity is going to come up with a reduc
tion in its base budget."
Andre Burnett, co-director of
SWOPSI, said, "We've been assured
that the financial situation is not getting
rid of programs."
Elaine Holliman, co-director of
SWOPSI, said, "There hasn't been
much definitive action taken."
She said the University's statements

arc sometimes contradictory: "They do
not want to cut back on programs, but
they want to cut back on labor and
staff."
Judy Adams, co-director of SCIRE,
said, "There are lots of unknowns at
this time." Bui she said, "H & S has
tried to see that they could help us."
The reorganization has the potential
to result in for SCIRE "a closer associa
tion with faculty," Adams said. For ex
ample, SCIRE could connect with fac
ulty for its internship program. But she
said, "We can't offer any incentive
(salary)."
Adams cited the importance ofextra
departmental programs as
"birthplaces" for currently well-estab
lished programs that did not fit under a
specific department. As the University
becomes more austere, she said, extra
departmental programs may become a
better testing ground.
Laura Selznick, director of Under
graduate Specials, said, for example,
that Katchadourian developed Human
Sexuality as a SWOPSI course.
Selznick said Wessells supports
"some high-risk, high-gain programs."
The University decided at the begin
ning of the month to end the position of
assistant dean, held by Beverly Scott.
Her position will end in June. "It's stan
dard," she said of her dismissal. "I
don't know what they plan to do."
