## Escondido school crosses cultural, lingual barriers 
### STEPHANIE SANDBERG 
The knee-high children who fill the Escondido
Village School with the bubbling din of multi
lingual confusion each weekday prove the cos
mopolitan tone of the school's title: "An Interna
tional Cooperative Preschool."
They each have parents who are studying or
teaching at Stanford, but there the similarities end.
The "homeland" countries of the students are as di
verse as Iceland, Switzerland, Korea, France, Brazil
and Venezuela. At the nursery school, however, the
young students never allow such obstacles as cul
tural differences to interfere with their "achieving

friends" that is the aim of the school's creators.
It's 2 p.m. on a Friday afternoon at Escondido
Nursery School. Four-year-old Karlos chatters in
Portuguese to his lighthaired Lincoln Logs cohort
from France. French and Portuguese dialogue are
somehow reconciled over the plastic red roof, and
the building arises with little controversy.
"These afternoon sessions are for the four and
five-year olds," explained school director Patsy
Williams while reaching for an appropriate length
of log for the Lincoln House. "The two-and-a-half
to three-year-olds come for the morning sessions."
She turns to Karlos suddenly with the right Lincoln
Log in her triumphant fist. "Here's one!"
The Escondido Nursery School is situated in the
Escondido Village Center at Stanford. Originally
planned as a cooperative effort among only those
parents who were residents of Escondido Village,
the school has since enlarged its operations to in
clude those Stanford-affiliated parents in the com
munity who would like to take part, with their chil
dren, in the program. "We got too popular," Wil
liams said.
Attending Escondido Nursery School and Stan
ford University isn't as dissimilar as it may sound.
The Nursery School operates on the Stanford calen
dar. The parents pay tuition ($lOO-260 per quarter,
depending on the number of morning or afternoon
I
session a child attends each week), enabling their
children can have the opportunity to meet students
from a variety of backgrounds. The students meet

in a classroom environment which is designed to
promote individual growth and group cooperation.
Of course, there are characteristics which dist
inguish the Nursery School from the Stanford Uni
versity experience. One of those is "planned
snacks."
"We're making tapioca pudding today," said one
of the aides, "Now Tammy, you're spilling over the
edge of vour bowl there. Beating eggs takes a lot of
concentration." But Tammy is too busy grinning at
these unexpected visitors to her school/playground
domain to notice untidy raw eggs.
Tammy is one of 60 youngsters who takes advan
tage of Escondido Nursery School's opportunities
each quarter. One of the most distinguishing fea
tures of the school is the parental participation in
volved in the Nursery School. Consequently, ac
cording to Williams, parents can share directly in
their child's school experience as well as meet other
parents of diverse cultures.
Such a parental education doesn't come without
duties, however. At the Nursery School, a parent is
expected to participate in the classroom approx
imately three to eight times per term, depending on
the number of days a child is enrolled, attend one
work day per term (Saturday morning or Sunday
afternoon), serve on a committee, and attend one
general business meeting per term.
At one end of the room, a Swiss mother is helping
two kerchiefed boys past black chimneys to
crooked, brown houses. At another table, a trio of

girls concentrate on rubber-band design, ignoring
suggestions of the Brazilian aide. Over by the Lin
coln Logs, two boys protest vocally at the skill of
Oriane, a French-speaking blond bombshell who
deciphers the puzzle design before they do.
To all comments, her solemn "Yeth" successfully
has been her tune far into her Nursery School ca
reer. She allows no linguistic or cultural barriers be
tween her and finding her piece in the puzzle.
