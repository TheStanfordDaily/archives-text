# Bob and Bob's no 'K-Mart' of Jewish stores
## 
### JANELLE LONDON 
Bob and Bob's Jewish Gifts in Palo Alto
"is not the K-Mart of Jewish stores," ac
cording to its founders, the mother
daughter team of Shirley and Ellen Bob.
Located on 151 Forest Avenue in Palo
Alto, the store deals mostly in fine quality
Jewish gifts, crafts and books.
The Bobs opened the store November
10, only ten days after Merkaz, formerly
the only Jewish store in Palo Alto, went
out of business. The Bobs both believe
with the growing Jewish community in the
area there is a need for a quality Jewish
store somewhere between Los Angeles
and San Francisco. Bob and Bob's is a
showcase for more than 100 local Jewish
artists as well.
For Ellen Bob, opening the store was
the climax of a lengthy series of Jewish ac
tivities. While getting a degree from Bran
deis University in Judaic Studies, she
spent a year studying in Israel, served on
the National Boards of Habonim and the
North American Jewish Students
Network, and was the Editor of the Jour
nal of the North Shore Jewish Community
for three years.
After graduating she edited the Palo
Alto Co-op paper for two years, and cur
rently sits on the Board of Governors of
the Jewish Student Press Service.
As her resume indicates, Ellen Bob en
joys being in charge. "I'm my own best
boss," she says. Bob wanted a store she
could shape to fit her tastes, the kind of
place where she herself would enjoy shop
ping.
Above and beyond a mere business en
terprise, Bob and Bob's Jewish Gifts is the
icing on the cake for Ellen Bob, the fulfill

ment of her dreams of living a perfect life
as a woman of the '80s. She plans to get
married in a few months (her fiancee is the
Executive Director of the Bav Area Coun
cil on Soviet Jewry), raise children and still
run her business with her mother. "That's
every woman's dream," she says.

Ellen Bob enjoys being in
charge. "I'm my own best

Bob and Bob's is operated on a very per
sonal level, and Ellen Bob wants it to stay
that way. She enjoys establishing friendly
relationships with customers, and she is
always prepared to answer questions
about the shop. Ellen claims her partici
pation in the business has enabled her to
meet both Jewish and non-Jewish mem
bers of the community.
Ellen's enthusiastic personality is not
the only part of her reflected in the store.
Her interests, too, expose themselves more
subtly in the merchandise. Her concern for
Jewish education and her desire to keep
people informed about Judaism is evi
denced by the large number of books in
the store. Information galore is at the fin
gertips on Jewish poetry, travel, humor,
philosophy, mysticism, history, fiction,
life, cooking as well as dictionaries, Bibles,

magazines and the Jerusalem Post on
weekends.
Ellen Bob's feminism, too, is evident in
the wide selection of books on women and
Judaism. A bulletin board on one wall
keeps her customers up to date about Jew
ish announcements and events in the area.
Shirley Bob, Ellen's mother, is the other
half of the founding duo. Before embark
ing on her new venture with Ellen Bob, she
served on the Board of Directors of Con
gregation Kol Emeth, Hadassah, ORT,
Brandeis National Women's Committee
and the Women's Division of the Jewish
Welfare Federation.
But after being a volunteer at the Jewish
Community Center in Los Altos for 10
years, Shirley Bob was "ready for a
change." So she and Ellen Bob used their
savings to lease the space on the corner of
Forest and High in Palo Alto. Her hus
band Bob, the treasurer of Bob and Bob's,
is very supportive of his wife and daughter
but leaves the operation of the business
completely up to them.
Having visited Israel several times, both
Ellen and Shirley Bob want their store to
include something of an Israeli flavor.
Many of their gift items such as hand
braided candles, handmade Challah cov
ers, Hebrew novels, handpainted glass
vases, mezzuzahs, and handthrown
porcelain are imported from Israel.
But they agree that Israel isn't the only
place in the world to get fine quality Jew
ish items. Kiddish cups from India, greet
ing cards designed by artists in New York,
Boston and Alabama and candles hand
braided in Chicago can be found in the
store. Local artists display their work
throughout Bob and Bob's, too.

braided candles, handmade Challah cov
ers, Hebrew novels, handpainted glass
vases, mezzuzahs, and handthrown
porcelain are imported from Israel.
But they agree that Israel isn't the only
place in the world to get fine quality Jew
ish items. Kiddish cups from India, greet
ing cards designed by artists in New York,
Boston and Alabama and candles hand
braided in Chicago can be found in the
store. Local artists display their work
throughout Bob and Bob's, too.
Bob and Bob's Jewish Gifts in Palo Alto
"is not the K-Mart of Jewish stores," ac
cording to its founders, the mother
daughter team of Shirley and Ellen Bob.
Located on 151 Forest Avenue in Palo
Alto, the store deals mostly in fine quality
Jewish gifts, crafts and books.
The Bobs opened the store November
10, only ten days after Merkaz, formerly
the only Jewish store in Palo Alto, went
out of business. The Bobs both believe
with the growing Jewish community in the
area there is a need for a quality Jewish
store somewhere between Los Angeles
and San Francisco. Bob and Bob's is a
showcase for more than 100 local Jewish
artists as well.
For Ellen Bob, opening the store was
the climax of a lengthy series of Jewish ac
tivities. While getting a degree from Bran
deis University in Judaic Studies, she
spent a year studying in Israel, served on
the National Boards of Habonim and the
North American Jewish Students
Network, and was the Editor of the Jour
nal of the North Shore Jewish Community
for three years.
After graduating she edited the Palo
Alto Co-op paper for two years, and cur
rently sits on the Board of Governors of
the Jewish Student Press Service.
As her resume indicates, Ellen Bob en
joys being in charge. "I'm my own best
boss," she says. Bob wanted a store she
could shape to fit her tastes, the kind of
place where she herself would enjoy shop
ping.
Above and beyond a mere business en
terprise, Bob and Bob's Jewish Gifts is the
icing on the cake for Ellen Bob, the fulfill

ment of her dreams of living a perfect life
as a woman of the '80s. She plans to get
married in a few months (her fiancee is the
Executive Director of the Bav Area Coun
cil on Soviet Jewry), raise children and still
run her business with her mother. "That's
every woman's dream," she says.

Bob and Bob's is operated on a very per
sonal level, and Ellen Bob wants it to stay
that way. She enjoys establishing friendly
relationships with customers, and she is
always prepared to answer questions
about the shop. Ellen claims her partici
pation in the business has enabled her to
meet both Jewish and non-Jewish mem
bers of the community.
Ellen's enthusiastic personality is not
the only part of her reflected in the store.
Her interests, too, expose themselves more
subtly in the merchandise. Her concern for
Jewish education and her desire to keep
people informed about Judaism is evi
denced by the large number of books in
the store. Information galore is at the fin
gertips on Jewish poetry, travel, humor,
philosophy, mysticism, history, fiction,
life, cooking as well as dictionaries, Bibles,

magazines and the Jerusalem Post on
weekends.
Ellen Bob's feminism, too, is evident in
the wide selection of books on women and
Judaism. A bulletin board on one wall
keeps her customers up to date about Jew
ish announcements and events in the area.
Shirley Bob, Ellen's mother, is the other
half of the founding duo. Before embark
ing on her new venture with Ellen Bob, she
served on the Board of Directors of Con
gregation Kol Emeth, Hadassah, ORT,
Brandeis National Women's Committee
and the Women's Division of the Jewish
Welfare Federation.
But after being a volunteer at the Jewish
Community Center in Los Altos for 10
years, Shirley Bob was "ready for a
change." So she and Ellen Bob used their
savings to lease the space on the corner of
Forest and High in Palo Alto. Her hus
band Bob, the treasurer of Bob and Bob's,
is very supportive of his wife and daughter
but leaves the operation of the business
completely up to them.
Having visited Israel several times, both
Ellen and Shirley Bob want their store to
include something of an Israeli flavor.
Many of their gift items such as hand
braided candles, handmade Challah cov
ers, Hebrew novels, handpainted glass
vases, mezzuzahs, and handthrown
porcelain are imported from Israel.
