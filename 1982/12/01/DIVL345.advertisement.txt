If you're a senior and have the promise of a $10,000 career-oriented job, do you know
what's stopping you from getting the American Express* Card?
You guessed it.
Nothing.
Because American Express believes in your future. But more than that. We believe
in you now. And we're proving it.
A $10,000 job promise. That's it. No strings. No gimmicks. And this offer is
even good for 12 months after you graduate.
But why should you get the American Express Card now?
Because the Card is great for shopping.
Whether it's a new suit for the job or a new stereo for home, the American
Express Card is welcomed at the finest stores all over the country. And even if you
need furniture for your place, you can do it with the Card.
Of course, it's also great for restaurants, hotels, and travel. It also begins to
establish your credit history-for any really big things you might need.
So fill in the coupon below and American Express will send you a Special
Student Application right away, along with a free handbook that has everything you
need to know about credit. Or just look for an application at your college bookstore
or on campus bulletin boards.
