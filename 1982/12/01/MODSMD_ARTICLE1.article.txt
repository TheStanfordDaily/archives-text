The storm that whipped through
Northern California Monday night
caused power failures, structural
damage and road blockages on cam
pus, resulting in an estimated cost of
$20,000 to the University.
Although most student residences
escaped damage, the faculty-staff
housing area took the worst beating.
Some residents there will have to pay
for damage caused by trees that fell
on their homes, and may be without
their PG & E-provided power until
Thursday.
"The clean-up crew worked 12 to
14 hours straight," said James
Horgan, University manager of op
erations and maintenance. The situ
ation was one of "controlled chaos"
he said, meaning that although the
damage was not very severe, the in
convenience and overtime hours
were substantial.
About 30 trees on campus were
knocked down by the strong winds,
according to Horgan. "Some of
these are very important trees," he
said, referring to three that blocked
roads. Campus Drive West, May-
Held Drive and Campus Lane, which
leads into the Children's Center,
were blocked from sometime during
the night until 10:30yesterday morn
ing.
The Work Information Center,
where all University storm calls were
directed, received between 200 and

night's storm and high winds blew down a number of
trees all over the campus and Palo Alto and caused an
estimated $20,000 damage to the University.

CLOSE CALL AT LATHROP: An uprooted tree narrowly missed tak
ing a section of Lathrop House with it in its final descent around midnight
Monday night. Other windfalls blocked Campus Drive and Mayfield.

Operations iind Maintenance the lights

rang.
Power was out there, along with
Stores, Commissary and the Children's
Center until 11 a.m. yesterday.
Other power outages occurred only
in the "fringe areas" of campus, accord
ing to Jeff Sultan, University electrical
distribution systems manager. "Most
of these were caused by tree damage,*'
he said. Areas hit included Pine Hafl,
the Research Libraries Group,
Alvarado Row and the faculty-staff
housing area.
"The University has some lines out to
old frat houses on Alvarado Row," Sul
tan said, and the power was back on in
those houses by 3:45 p.m. yesterday.
However, other houses on that street,
and those in the faculty-staff area are
still without power because they are ser
viced by PG & E.
PG & E is busy repairing lines
throughout the Buy Area, so there are
delays in fixing those on campus. "They
might not even make 't tomorrow*''
Sultan said, based on information he re
ceived from a PG & E spokesman.
Stanford repairmen are not allowed
to perform actual repairs on the
PG & E lines, but they did aid in secur
ing downed lines that were posing safe
ty hazards.
In the faculty-staff housing area,
Salvatierra Street homes suffered the
most from storm-downed trees. At 591
Salvatierra, a tree smashed into the attic
and another tore down lines so that the
entire street was still without power last
night. Homeowner History Prof. Van
Slvke believed his house was the most
seriously damaged on the street.
"The tree came down about 12:30
while we were asleep," he explained.
According to Van Slyke, the University
had called in local service to help re
move the trees. "University main
tenance people aren't equipped to han
dle this," he said.
