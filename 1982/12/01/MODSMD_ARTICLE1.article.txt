The storm that whipped through
Northern California Monday night
caused power failures, structural
damage and road blockages on cam
pus, resulting in an estimated cost of
$20,000 to the University.
Although most student residences
escaped damage, the faculty-staff
housing area took the worst beating.
Some residents there will have to pay
for damage caused by trees that fell
on their homes, and may be without
their PG & E-provided power until
Thursday.
"The clean-up crew worked 12 to
14 hours straight," said James
Horgan, University manager of op
erations and maintenance. The situ
ation was one of "controlled chaos"
he said, meaning that although the
damage was not very severe, the in
convenience and overtime hours
were substantial.
About 30 trees on campus were
knocked down by the strong winds,
according to Horgan. "Some of
these are very important trees," he
said, referring to three that blocked
roads. Campus Drive West, May-
Held Drive and Campus Lane, which
leads into the Children's Center,
were blocked from sometime during
the night until 10:30yesterday morn
ing.
