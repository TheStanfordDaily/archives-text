# Stanford grads make good with prank, party business
## 
### ALLIE GILES 
Fred Hargadon's usual talk on the hows and
whys of being Stanford's Dean of Admissions
took an unexpected turn when he spoke at
Madera.
[During his talk, an oversized box was special
ly delivered to "Fred Haagan-Dazs." Out of it
sprang a tuxedoed MC who proceeded to host a
mock Jeopardy game show. Despite the fact the
theme of the show was Fred's life, Dean Fred
still managed to come in last, failing to supply
the "correct" questions to answers such as the
one person Fred regrets admitting and the real
reason he took a sabbatical.

A mazing Events 9 most
successful idea from a fiscal
standpoint was a big picnic and
field day put on at San Jose
ranch featuring country music,
horseback riding, games and a
huge barbequefor upwards of
1500 people.

This study break was just one of many enter
taining ideas offered by Amazing Events Un
limited, a company started in 1981 by three Stan
ford graduates that specializes "in corporate en
tertainment and creative events." For people
who think singing telegrams are passe and are
stuck for new ideas, Amazing Events are the
people to call; even their telephone number —
DARE-2-DO — encourages the customer to try
something new.
From start to finish, from creating a new con
cept to preparing its details, Amazing Events
will make any event — welcomes, farewells,
open houses, Halloween parties — something to
be remembered.
The three Stanford students who began the
company — Mark Breier, Eddie Poplauski and
T.J. Hevman — originally did so as pre-business

school experience. Breier is the only one current
ly working full time. He has put off business
school for at least another year because Amaz
ing Events has encountered an unexpected
degree of success. He noted that more than 20 of
the Bay Area's biggest firms have been cus
tomers of Amazing Events, less than two years
old.
"The original concept," says Breier, "was to
target the wealthy suburbs and do smaller
private functions." While these still provide the
opportunity for some of the more ingenious
events, the more profitable ones are those for
larger companies.
Amazing Events' most successful idea from a

sic, horseback riding, games and a huge
barbeque for upwards of 1500 people.
But it is some of their smaller functions that
are the most creative. On an "ultimate date," a
couple will find themselves having an evening on
the town including pre-paid dinners and shows,
unexpected rides and sidewalk surprises such as
a vendor who happens to be selling posters of the
couple.
Or someone might find his last day on the
job made particularly unforgettable with a series
of pranks and mishaps. Amazing Events claims
it can supply "a bumbling waiter to turn a posh
dinner party into an evening of hilarity, a team
of golfers to golf through your living room or
cocktail party, a stripping gorilla to upstage any
gathering or just about any creative event to fit
your entertaining needs."
While some occasions require professionals,
like mimes, jugglers or stiltwalkers, Amazing
Events also "semi-recruits Stanford students
who have a flair for the unusual and like to do
acting," according to Brier.
Breier said the people within the company are
constantly coming up with new ideas to supple
ment their already successful repetoire of events,
usually at their brainstorming session over
margaritas during La Cumbre's Happy Hour.
