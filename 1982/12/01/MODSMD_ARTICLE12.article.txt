## The
						Stanford Daily 100 white elephants in a pack 
### 
Given the highest unemployment and lowest steel
production rates since the Depression, estimates of
annual federal budget deficits hop, skipping and
jumping their way toward the 5200 billion mark
and an election repudiation of current defense
spending, what did the administration do? Propose
a 526.4 billion white elephant, of course.
One hundred white elephants, to be precise,
herded together in the plains of Wyoming awaiting
their charge up Capitol Hill under the euphemistic
banner of "Peacemaker". Conceived to meet a
dubious need, executed in a plan densely packed
with flaws and coinciding with the most unstable
time in recent Soviet history, the MX missile is one
bad idea deserving to be mounted on House Speak
er Tip O'Neill's big game trophy wall.
Designed to close (rather than shade or break)
the "window of vulnerability" seen by only the
most observant Pentagon voyeurs, the missiles'
protection, accuracy and range would supposedly
make up for the deficiencies of the aging Minute
man 111. But not only is this window not seen by
many other druids who sling incantations like
AIRS, CSB and SLBM to ward off evil, even those
peering through the looking glass admit the U.S.
cruise missiles, bombers and submarins constitute a
damn worthy deterrent force.
And this deterrent force is the point of the entire
sordid business. The theory runs that U.S. will and
means to retaliate against a Soviet first strike dis
suades any attack — and that the Soviets, as ration
al humans, don't want to provoke nuclear annihila
tion either. This deterrent seems to exist — with
cruise missiles and a 3:1 advantage in submarine
launched warheads and wihout any new land-based
missile, like the MX, whose backers show a redun
dant and mystical preoccupation with the triad.
Even if a land-based missile were needed, the
'dense-pack' MX basing mode prompts tears of

pain. The $26.4 billion pot (without the de rigeur
support systems and cost overruns) rests on the
arcane theory of fratricide — the idea that Soviet
warheads aimed at the closely packed MXs will de
stroy their kin. Even ignoring the objections that
any radiation haze thick enough to destroy incom
ing Soviet missiles would do the same thing to out
going U.S. missiles or that the Soviets could target
their missiles in a northward pattern to avoid the
entire problem, the obvious question of what an
American president would do with only Soviet
cities to strike hardlv strenthens our deterrent
threat.
Even if the untested theories are right, the entire
plan may not work. Sen. Henry Jackson (D-
Wash.), hardly a defense novice or fellow-traveler,
savs the dense pack scheme would be invulnerable
for only four years. A Congressionalßudget Office
report concludes that even if all worked as prom
ised, the program's contribution to the nation's de
fense would be minimal.
The MX's first victim would be arms control.
President Reagan has pitifully few successful cases
to support his 'bargaining chip' theory of arms ne
gotiation, and the deployment mode would violate
provisions of the SALT II accord — unsigned but
still followed. Even more disturbing is the Maine
and Vermont syndrome of how acceptance of the
MX would almost certainly lead to deployment of
an anti-ballistic missile (ABM) system to protect it.
The ABMs come close to chucking the entire idea
of deterrence by providing protection for broad
areas, and their use would mean abandoning the
ABM Treaty, one of the only successful arms con
trol treaties in world history.
We hope that Jackson is right when he says the
MX is in deep trouble in Congress. It is an idea
whose time never was, whose cost we cannot bear
and whose demise would be a service to us all.
