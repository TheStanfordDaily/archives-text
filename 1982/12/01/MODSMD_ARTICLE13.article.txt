## Overcoming naivete in the ghetto 
### 
My new home is in a black ghetto. I
live in a tall and narrow townhouse that
mv landlords, Bob and Nancy Mcln
tyre, have renovated. Most of the other
townhouses in the neighborhood,
which stand side-bv-side virtually on
top of the sidewalk, are rundown. A few
are boarded up.
In my new neighborhood, the kids
plav on the cracked brick sidewalks,
which are littered with beer bottles,
brown paper bags, and food containers.
Trees are scarce, and manicured lawns
are absent.
When I survey this scene, I remember
the neighborhood I grew up in, the 1500
block on Waverley St. in Palo Alto. The
only things on the sidewalk were leaves
from the many trees that lined the
street. 1 joined my friends every evening
to play games in our parents" large and
clean yards. The only people on the
street corner were elderly people wait
ing for the bus.
My parents' only restriction when I
was young was that I be in by 10 p.m.
Here, the Mclntyres are afraid to let
there two-year-oid daughter, Molly,
play outside. Their biggest fear is not
that their daughter will cut herself on a
broken bottle, or get hurb by the other
kids, but that she will get pricked by
junkies' discarded hypodermic needle.
Just before 1 arrived, Nancy was
pricked by a needle while gardening in
the front yard. Used needles litter the al
ley behind our house.
With few white people living in the
neighborhood, most of the whites the
pushers see are there to buy drugs. Con
sequently, I attract a lot of attention
when I arrive home at Eleventh and O
Streets in Washington, D.C.
Before I get to the corner, they yell to

get my attention. Then they converge
on me, calling out "Bam and D" and
"works."
"Bam" is the street name for Pre
ludin, a diet pill that acts as an upper.
"D" is Dilaudid, a painkiller pill that is
a downer. Each drug is mixed with wa
ter and then injected. "Works" are
hypodermic needles.
112 especially draw a crowd at night
when I come home in a friend's car or a
cab. The drug dealers crowd around the
car and practically open mv door expec
ting a sale. They are surprised that I de
cline.
The drug pushers don't hassle me
when I say no. "O.K. man, that's cool,"
is a common response. At first this sur
prised me, but now I realize they don't
want trouble, which would interfere
with their business.
The drug dealing seemingly operates
24-hours-a-day, seven days a week.
They bring unbrellas to conduct busi
ness when it rains. Not surprisingly,
they seem to do a brisk business.
With the drugs inevitably comes vi
olent crime. The danger of being
mugged is constant. While I worry
about being mugged, Bob and Nancy
say their biggest fear is being caught in
the crossfire of a shooting. They esti
mate that during the five years they
have lived here, 25 people have been
murdered, almost all because of fights
over drugs.
One evening, soon after I arrived,
Bob was telling me about a murder that
occurred right behind their house when
we heard some loud pops outside. I
tensed. Then I remembered it was a
couple of days before the fourth of July.
1 was — and still am — naive to a way
of life common to urban dwellers. This

ignorance led me to decide to live on the
corner of Eleventh and O Streets,
among the drug dealers, muggers and
prostitutes.
During spring quarter on the Farm,
on another one of those beautiful Cali
fornia days, when no one ever gets any
schoolwork done, I realized I needed a
change of environment. £1 no longer
wanted the isolated country club ex
istence of Stanford or the idyllic sub
urban experience of Palo Alto. I have to
see another part of the country and re
side in a different kind of neighbor
hood.
Five months after having arrived
here, I call this neighborhood my home.
I no longer sit on the edge of my seat
fidgeting when I'm the only white per
son riding the bus, for example. Nor do
I walk down the street like a soldier in
Vietnam who may be ambushed at any
moment when I walk two blocks to the
grocery storey at night anymore. I was
the only one concerned about the color
of my skin.
Even the drug dealers seem to be get
ting used to me. They often ignore me
now when I reach Eleventh and O. Last
weekend, as I was walking home from a
softball game carrying my mitt, two
pushers asked me, "Did you win?"
Still, when I look out my window
here and watch a drug deal occurring, I
can't help but think how far away I am
from Palo Alto. I remember that only
five months ago, at Stanford, when I
looked out my window at Lambda Nu,
I saw people sunbathing, sailing and
swimming in Lake Lagunita.

are boarded up.
In my new neighborhood, the kids
plav on the cracked brick sidewalks,
which are littered with beer bottles,
brown paper bags, and food containers.
Trees are scarce, and manicured lawns
are absent.
When I survey this scene, I remember
the neighborhood I grew up in, the 1500
block on Waverley St. in Palo Alto. The
only things on the sidewalk were leaves
from the many trees that lined the
street. 1 joined my friends every evening
to play games in our parents" large and
clean yards. The only people on the
street corner were elderly people wait
ing for the bus.
My parents' only restriction when I
was young was that I be in by 10 p.m.
Here, the Mclntyres are afraid to let
there two-year-oid daughter, Molly,
play outside. Their biggest fear is not
that their daughter will cut herself on a
broken bottle, or get hurb by the other
kids, but that she will get pricked by
junkies' discarded hypodermic needle.
Just before 1 arrived, Nancy was
pricked by a needle while gardening in
the front yard. Used needles litter the al
ley behind our house.
With few white people living in the
neighborhood, most of the whites the
pushers see are there to buy drugs. Con
sequently, I attract a lot of attention
when I arrive home at Eleventh and O
Streets in Washington, D.C.
Before I get to the corner, they yell to

get my attention. Then they converge
on me, calling out "Bam and D" and
"works."
"Bam" is the street name for Pre
ludin, a diet pill that acts as an upper.
"D" is Dilaudid, a painkiller pill that is
a downer. Each drug is mixed with wa
ter and then injected. "Works" are
hypodermic needles.
112 especially draw a crowd at night
when I come home in a friend's car or a
cab. The drug dealers crowd around the
car and practically open mv door expec
ting a sale. They are surprised that I de
cline.
The drug pushers don't hassle me
when I say no. "O.K. man, that's cool,"
is a common response. At first this sur
prised me, but now I realize they don't
want trouble, which would interfere
with their business.
The drug dealing seemingly operates
24-hours-a-day, seven days a week.
They bring unbrellas to conduct busi
ness when it rains. Not surprisingly,
they seem to do a brisk business.
With the drugs inevitably comes vi
olent crime. The danger of being
mugged is constant. While I worry
about being mugged, Bob and Nancy
say their biggest fear is being caught in
the crossfire of a shooting. They esti
mate that during the five years they
have lived here, 25 people have been
murdered, almost all because of fights
over drugs.
One evening, soon after I arrived,
Bob was telling me about a murder that
occurred right behind their house when
we heard some loud pops outside. I
tensed. Then I remembered it was a
couple of days before the fourth of July.
1 was — and still am — naive to a way
of life common to urban dwellers. This

ignorance led me to decide to live on the
corner of Eleventh and O Streets,
among the drug dealers, muggers and
prostitutes.
During spring quarter on the Farm,
on another one of those beautiful Cali
fornia days, when no one ever gets any
schoolwork done, I realized I needed a
change of environment. £1 no longer
wanted the isolated country club ex
istence of Stanford or the idyllic sub
urban experience of Palo Alto. I have to
see another part of the country and re
side in a different kind of neighbor
hood.
Five months after having arrived
here, I call this neighborhood my home.
I no longer sit on the edge of my seat
fidgeting when I'm the only white per
son riding the bus, for example. Nor do
I walk down the street like a soldier in
Vietnam who may be ambushed at any
moment when I walk two blocks to the
grocery storey at night anymore. I was
the only one concerned about the color
of my skin.
Even the drug dealers seem to be get
ting used to me. They often ignore me
now when I reach Eleventh and O. Last
weekend, as I was walking home from a
softball game carrying my mitt, two
pushers asked me, "Did you win?"
Still, when I look out my window
here and watch a drug deal occurring, I
can't help but think how far away I am
from Palo Alto. I remember that only
five months ago, at Stanford, when I
looked out my window at Lambda Nu,
I saw people sunbathing, sailing and
swimming in Lake Lagunita.

My new home is in a black ghetto. I
live in a tall and narrow townhouse that
mv landlords, Bob and Nancy Mcln
tyre, have renovated. Most of the other
townhouses in the neighborhood,
which stand side-bv-side virtually on
