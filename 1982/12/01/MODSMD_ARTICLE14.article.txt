## Food service skimped on Fast Day donations 
### 
I agree with vour recent editorial
i Daily, Nov. 23); if people did do not
become more aware of world hunger
during Fast Day and Thanksgiving
Week, then turning in meal cards was
practically meaningless.
I was shocked to find out that only
53.40 per person (on Food Service) fast
ing is donated to relief organizations.
We pay $8.32 a day for the A plan, $7.81
for the B plan, $10.13 for C plan and
57.56 for P plan.
What docs food service do with the
rest of the money? Why doesn't it scale
the donations according to meal plans
instead of giving just a flat rate? I was
led to believe all the money I paid for
one day's meals Would be donated.

Dorm funds, drinks
I would like to thank Mark Soble for
his column (Daily, Nov. 23) on alcohol
and dorm funds. It is reassuring to
know that there are freshmen who are
willing to stand up to peer pressure. He

may have many negative comments
directed at his column, but I hope he
doesn't back down.
The point Soble so correctly raises
takes me back to my freshman days. It
is unfair for non-drinkers to be assessed
house dues to subsidize beer parties;
this is a sort of taxation without repre
sentation. It is distasteful for University
residences to flout California law re
garding drinking age. Finally, it is im
moral for the University to show such
great disregard for the founders' wishes
with respect to alcohol. Stanford and
the lands around it were to be "dry" ac
cording to the Stanfords. This may be a
silly, fuddy-duddy restriction, one to be
tacitly ignored and disregarded, but it
should not necessarily be one which is
trampled in the mud at Stanford resi
dences and with Stanford funds.

Send band to Cal
Dear Joe Kapp: The Stanford band,
which years ago lost its dignity and the
respect of most alumni, now has per
formed the incredible feat of losing the
Big Game and depriving the Cardinal
of a bowl bid. So. may I make a sugges

tion?
Why don't you see if you can get a big
block "C" for every member of the
band; they richly deserve it. And then, if
your team should happen to get a
belated invitation to a post-season
bowl, why don't you take the Stanford
band along to block for you again?
When you've finished with them,
please keep them — if you can stand
having them around. Meantime, maybe
somebody will get a real Stanford band
together, which will be motivated by
something else than a constant desire to
show off.

Lost opportunity
It was shocking to this 1933 Fifty
Year Reunion grad to see the TV replay
with members of the band scattering. I
repeat, scattering before the Cal bar
rier. Not a tackle, a block, a trip —
nothing. Shame on you ladies and gen
tlemen. gals and guys, coeds and
roughs. What a lost opportunity!

MX and the SCPA
As a Director of the Stanford Con
servative Political Alliance (SCPA), I
was interested, and more than a little
surprised, to find a leaflet in the name of
the group distributed across campus
just before Thanksgiving break. This
leaflet, which urged support for the
president's MX proposal, was of such a
slipshod, unimaginative variety that we
felt confident that the Stanford com
munity would recognize it for what it
was — 2 half-assed attempt to discredit
the SCPA. Apparently, however, as
Rachelle Marshall's letter (Daily, Nov.
30) indicates, people here were duped
into believing that the leaflets were of
SCPA origin. To clear the issue:
1. The SCPA was in no way respon
sible for the leaflet.
2. The SCPA has no formal position
on the president's MX proposal.
3. Our initials are SCPA, despite the
attempt by the document's ori
ginators) to portray us as the Society
ofur the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals.
Thank you for allowing us to correct
this issue.
