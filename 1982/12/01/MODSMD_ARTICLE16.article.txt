## NATO nuclear umbrella leaks 
### 
The last few years have been years of
crisis for the Atlantic Alliance, years
when major rifts appeared in alliance
solidarity. Although it has received less
attention than the more publicized dis
putes over economic trade and energy
policy, the debate over theater nuclear
weapons is by far the most profound,
both in its difficulty and in its implica
tions to the future of life on the planet.
Missiles cause deep-felt fears, pipelines
do not. It is the fear of nuclear radi
ations, not natural gas, which has
brought millions to the streets in pro
test.
It has now been three years since the
December 1979 NATO 'two-track de
cision' to deploy 108 Pershing II mis
siles and 464 Ground Launched Cruise
Missiles (GLCMs), while simultane
ously pursuing arms control to limit
such weapons. And it has been one year
since President Reagan gave his famous
'zero option' speech to the largest live
audience ever to watch an American
President. Reagan's speech was quite
successful in quieting the din of protest
to the Intermediate-range Nuclear
Force (INF) modernization, but both
sides of the Atlantic knew then and now
that the so-called 'zero option' was
more a way of placating public opinion
than a serious negotiating posture.
Before jumping to blame Reagan,
however, we must remember that it was
the Europeans, or more specifically the
Germans and the British, who initiated
the proposed modernization as early as
1977. It did not begin with Jimmy
Carter and certainly was not Reagan's
doing.
It also must not be forgotten that it
was the prospect that Europe would be
come a nuclear battleground which was
the reason for the INF decision in the
first place. Subsequent protests in Eu
rope against INF modernization repre
sent real but previously misguided
fears. They have been protesting
against the very weapons which will
save them from the destruction they
dread so much.
There were 120 Soviet SS-22s
deployed when Soviet Foreign Minister
Andrei Gromyko said in November
1979 that a European military balance
already existed and that any change in
the equation would "undermine the
prospects of negotiations" and would
have "new and adverse effects on de
tente." Gromyko has condemned only
himself, however, for since the time of
that statement, the Soviets have more
than doubled the size of their own thea
ter nuclear force.
Before one can process realistic solu
tions which will deter war and reduce
the burden of defense, whether finan
cial or psychological, one must bear in
mind three changed world realities: the

Soviet attainment of strategic parity,
the Soviet achievement of theater nucle
ar superiority in Europe and the
change in the Western European politi
cal climate.
When the Soviets achieved strategic
parity the American nuclear "um
brella" over Europe became less
credible. A perceived American
hesitancy to initiate a strategic retalita
tion in response to a Soviet conven
tional aggression under minded the se
curity of NATO. It was the European
desire to "recouple" American strategic
systems to European defense which led
to the decision to give the American
president the option of attacking the
USSR from European bases. Only in
this way would war be deterred and
would it be possible to avoid a scenario
in which the superpowers devastate Eu
rope through the exchange of
thousands of battlefield nuclear weap-

A realistic proposal must insist upon some
deployment of Pershing lis and cruise missiles
since they are necessary to "recouple " the US
strategic systems to the defense of NATO and
hence to avoid a tactical nuclear war limited to
Europe. Consequently, the ceiling for SS-20s could
be raised a comparable amount.

ons while the U.S. and the Soviet Union
remain sanctuaries.
Complicating the reality of strategic
parity has been the unparalleled, "one
missile-a-week" Soviet build-up of the
ater nuclear weapons. The Soviet
deployment of SS-20s represented an
escalation of the arms race which went
on without protest in the West. These
new weapons gave the Soviets the
capabiity of striking targets anywhere
in Europe from inside the Soviet
borders. NATO presently has no
capability to respond in kind.
The widespread protests against the
Pershing lis and Cruise missiles il
lustrate a widening breach benveen
American and European perceptions oi
security and deterrence. The European
climate has indeed changed, but it has
not been a wave of pacifism or neutral
ism which has spread across the conti
nent, it has rather been a broadly based
antipathy to any increases in the NAT O
nuclear arsenal regardless of the needs
of deterrence. It is a "war-fighting
strategy," conventional or nuclear,
which the Europeans will not tolerate.

Any U.S. proposals must reflect and
address these convictions.
Broad-sweeping yet realistic pro
posals must be made at the Geneva ne
gotiations if an agreement which is ac
ceptable both to public opinion and to
NATO's security interests is to be
reached. Before any major U.S. policy
proposals, a concession should be made
to the U.S.S.R. setting a low ceiling, yet
one above zero, which will allow them
to counter the 18 theater nuclear mis
siles of the independent French "force
de frappe."

Beyond that, because of the political
climate in Europe, reductions in the nu
clear stockpile must be made if an ac
ceptable situation from a security
standpoint is to develop. The dubious
reliability of the Warsaw Pact armies
and the known Western European an
tipathy to war-fighting strategies make
possible and desirable a drastic, unilat
eral reduction in the NATO stockpile of
6000 warheads. The size of this stock
pile resembles a war-fighting capability
far too much, and its reduction would
deeply undercut the anti-nuclear op
position to the INF modernization. Ex
perts have suggested that it could be
parred down to as few as two- to four
hundred warheads.
An ability to strike first and quickly
at the Soviet Union with nuclear weap
ons in response to aggression is vital to
deterring that aggression. At the same
time, courageous proposals must be
made toward reducing the nuclcar
stockpile.

The last few years have been years of
crisis for the Atlantic Alliance, years
when major rifts appeared in alliance
solidarity. Although it has received less
attention than the more publicized dis
putes over economic trade and energy
policy, the debate over theater nuclear
weapons is by far the most profound,
both in its difficulty and in its implica
tions to the future of life on the planet.
Missiles cause deep-felt fears, pipelines
do not. It is the fear of nuclear radi
ations, not natural gas, which has
brought millions to the streets in pro
test.
It has now been three years since the
December 1979 NATO 'two-track de
cision' to deploy 108 Pershing II mis
siles and 464 Ground Launched Cruise
Missiles (GLCMs), while simultane
ously pursuing arms control to limit
such weapons. And it has been one year
since President Reagan gave his famous
'zero option' speech to the largest live
audience ever to watch an American
President. Reagan's speech was quite
successful in quieting the din of protest
to the Intermediate-range Nuclear
Force (INF) modernization, but both
sides of the Atlantic knew then and now
that the so-called 'zero option' was
more a way of placating public opinion
than a serious negotiating posture.
Before jumping to blame Reagan,
however, we must remember that it was
the Europeans, or more specifically the
Germans and the British, who initiated
the proposed modernization as early as
1977. It did not begin with Jimmy
Carter and certainly was not Reagan's
doing.
It also must not be forgotten that it
was the prospect that Europe would be
come a nuclear battleground which was
the reason for the INF decision in the
first place. Subsequent protests in Eu
rope against INF modernization repre
sent real but previously misguided
fears. They have been protesting
against the very weapons which will
save them from the destruction they
dread so much.
There were 120 Soviet SS-22s
deployed when Soviet Foreign Minister
Andrei Gromyko said in November
1979 that a European military balance
already existed and that any change in
the equation would "undermine the
prospects of negotiations" and would
have "new and adverse effects on de
tente." Gromyko has condemned only
himself, however, for since the time of
that statement, the Soviets have more
than doubled the size of their own thea
ter nuclear force.
Before one can process realistic solu
tions which will deter war and reduce
the burden of defense, whether finan
cial or psychological, one must bear in
mind three changed world realities: the

Soviet attainment of strategic parity,
the Soviet achievement of theater nucle
ar superiority in Europe and the
change in the Western European politi
cal climate.
When the Soviets achieved strategic
parity the American nuclear "um
brella" over Europe became less
credible. A perceived American
hesitancy to initiate a strategic retalita
tion in response to a Soviet conven
tional aggression under minded the se
curity of NATO. It was the European
desire to "recouple" American strategic
systems to European defense which led
to the decision to give the American
president the option of attacking the
USSR from European bases. Only in
this way would war be deterred and
would it be possible to avoid a scenario
in which the superpowers devastate Eu
rope through the exchange of
thousands of battlefield nuclear weap-

A realistic proposal must insist upon some
deployment of Pershing lis and cruise missiles
since they are necessary to "recouple " the US
strategic systems to the defense of NATO and
hence to avoid a tactical nuclear war limited to
Europe. Consequently, the ceiling for SS-20s could
be raised a comparable amount.

ons while the U.S. and the Soviet Union
remain sanctuaries.
Complicating the reality of strategic
parity has been the unparalleled, "one
missile-a-week" Soviet build-up of the
ater nuclear weapons. The Soviet
deployment of SS-20s represented an
escalation of the arms race which went
on without protest in the West. These
new weapons gave the Soviets the
capabiity of striking targets anywhere
in Europe from inside the Soviet
borders. NATO presently has no
capability to respond in kind.
The widespread protests against the
Pershing lis and Cruise missiles il
lustrate a widening breach benveen
American and European perceptions oi
security and deterrence. The European
climate has indeed changed, but it has
not been a wave of pacifism or neutral
ism which has spread across the conti
nent, it has rather been a broadly based
antipathy to any increases in the NAT O
nuclear arsenal regardless of the needs
of deterrence. It is a "war-fighting
strategy," conventional or nuclear,
which the Europeans will not tolerate.

Any U.S. proposals must reflect and
address these convictions.
Broad-sweeping yet realistic pro
posals must be made at the Geneva ne
gotiations if an agreement which is ac
ceptable both to public opinion and to
NATO's security interests is to be
reached. Before any major U.S. policy
proposals, a concession should be made
to the U.S.S.R. setting a low ceiling, yet
one above zero, which will allow them
to counter the 18 theater nuclear mis
siles of the independent French "force
de frappe."
