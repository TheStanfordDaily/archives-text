Ramey chosen for award
The American Institute of Mining,
Metallurgical and Petroleum Engineers
(AIME) has awarded the 1982 Anthony F.
Lucas Gold Medal to Henry Ramey.
Ramey, who is the chairman of the petro
leum engineering department here, was
selected because of his numerous contribu
tions including work with thermal recovery
of oil, geothermal steam production and
well pressure behavior interpretation.
His work in thermal recovery has involved
burning air or gas in a well in order to facil
itate the removal of oil from the well by heat
ing the oil so that it moves more easily.
Ramev's work in geothermal steam pro
duction has involves taking steam out of the
earth and converting it into energy.
Well pressure behavior interpretation is
used by petroleum companies in order to de
termine the state of an oil well. Ramey takes

the readings from gauges on the rig and is
then able to determine what is going on in
the well. He can then tell the companies

whether it would be better to wait and drill
later or not.
AIME gives the award for "distinguished
achievement in improving the technique and
practice of finding and producing petrole
um." The award is given in memory of the
man who is considered to be the "father" of
petroleum engineering.
Ramey, who holds the endowed pro
fessorship of Kelleen and Carlton Beal, has
been at the University since 1965. He has
also taught at Texas A & M University and
worked with both Mobil Oil Corporation
and Chinese Petroleum Corporation.
An active member of the Society of Petro
leum Engineers (SPE), Ramey is currently a
SPE Distinguished Author. He has also been
a Distinguished Lecturer.
The recipient of other awards from SPE,
Ramev has a bachelor of science degree and
doctoral degree in chemical engineering
from Purdue University.
The award will be presented at AIME's
annual banquet on March 9, 1983.
Engineering depts. ranked
A survey of the quality of engineering fac
ulty at colleges nationwide has ranked the
University's mechanical engineering pro
gram second and electrical engineering tied
for second.
The survey, conducted by the Conference
Board of Associated Research Councils,
also ranked the University fifth in chemical
engineering and sixth in civil engineering.
Among other schools, UC-Berkeley's fac
ulty ranked first in civil engineering, second
in electrical engineering, third in mechanical
engineering, and fourth in chemical engi
neering. The Massachusetts Institute of
Technology (MlT)was rated first in both
electrical and mechanical engineering, sec
ond in civil engineering and seventh in
chemical engineering.
When the last comparable survey was
conducted in 1969, the University was
ranked second in both electrical and me
chanical engineering and tied for fourth in
both civil and chemical engineering.
"We had hoped to be number one," said
Robert White, chairman of the electrical en
gineering department. He emphasized that
the University has arrived at this position af
ter being virtually "nowhere" before World
War 11. He postulated that the University
was hurt in the ratings because, "both MIT
and Cal have combined computer science
and electrical engineering departments and
are twice as big when lumped together."

White said that he felt the electrical engi
neering department had to "do some work"
in the computer systems area of the depart
ment. Although he said that he would like to
see that aspect strengthened, he said that the
faculty is "right up there."
The survev was based on a nationwide
survey at 822 engineering faculties and was
funded by a 5500,000 grant from the Mellon,
Ford, and Sloan Foundations, the National
Institutes of Health, the National Science
Foundation and the National Academy of
Sciences.
Arms and The Man to open
The Drama Department's production of
Arms and The Man opens tonight at 8
o'clock in the Nitery. Written by George
Bernard Shaw, the play is directed by Ste
phen Weeks, a second-year doctoral stu
dent.
The play involves a conflict between the
ideals of a young couple and the reality that
they must face. Raina and Sergius, the leads
who are played by Christine ROum and
Scott Leland, have to make difficult de
cisions when war breaks out in their home
land, Bulgaria, in the late nineteenth cen
tury.
The play, which was written in 1894 and
was Shaw's first success, was subtitled both a
"romantic comedy" and an "anti-romantic
comedy" by Shaw. However, the author said
when the play was first produced that he
wanted the play to be appreciated not only
for the humor in it, but also for the message
that he was trying to get across.
Wind ensemble to play
A centennial salute to Percy Grainger will
be given by the Wind Ensemble at 8 p.m. on
Saturday, Dec. 4 at Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
Under the direction of Arthur Barnes, the
ensemble practices three times a week.
Members of the group include under
graduates, graduate students and other
Stanford community members. The group
usually presents theme concerts. Last
spring's concert featured selections by John
Philip Sousa.
Born an Australian in 1882, Grainger died
an American at age 79. He used English folk
songs and dance tunes as a basis for some of
his compostions for band, chorus and or
chestra.
The concert will include Grainger's Han
del in the Strand, The Immovable Do, Molly
on the Shore, The Power of Rome and the
Christian Heart, Country Gardens and Lads

of Wamphray.
Paule Reale's Concerto for Piano Trio and
Wind Ensemble which was written this year
will also be in the concert. The concerto,
which was written for the Mirecourt Trio, a
group from Grinnell College in lowa, was
funded bv a grant from the Jerome Founda
tion of Minnesota.
The trio is going to perform the Reale
piece on their way to Los Angeles where they
will make a recording of the concerto. The
trio includes Kenneth Goldsmith, who re
ceived his master's degree in music from the
University in 1968 and plays the violin,
Terry King, cello, and John Jensen, piano.
Van Siclen to speak
Charles Van Siclen will give a lecture on
the origin of pieces in the Stanford
Museum's Egyptian collection tonight at
7:30 in Terman Auditorium.
A graduate of the University in 1967, Van
Siclen is a fellow of the American Research
Center in Egypt, Inc. and a director of the
Babastis Research project.
Interested in the collection during his un
dergraduate years, Van Siclen is presently
cataloging the collection. He will choose a
few of the more interesting pieces for his talk
and will trace them back to their origins.
Van Siclen, who has done work in Egypt
since 1971, has been a lecturer for five Stan
ford Alumni Association Travel/Study Col
leges on the Nile.

Ramey chosen for award
The American Institute of Mining,
Metallurgical and Petroleum Engineers
(AIME) has awarded the 1982 Anthony F.
Lucas Gold Medal to Henry Ramey.
Ramey, who is the chairman of the petro
leum engineering department here, was
selected because of his numerous contribu
tions including work with thermal recovery
of oil, geothermal steam production and
well pressure behavior interpretation.
His work in thermal recovery has involved
burning air or gas in a well in order to facil
itate the removal of oil from the well by heat
ing the oil so that it moves more easily.
Ramev's work in geothermal steam pro
duction has involves taking steam out of the
earth and converting it into energy.
Well pressure behavior interpretation is
used by petroleum companies in order to de
termine the state of an oil well. Ramey takes

the readings from gauges on the rig and is
then able to determine what is going on in
the well. He can then tell the companies

whether it would be better to wait and drill
later or not.
AIME gives the award for "distinguished
achievement in improving the technique and
practice of finding and producing petrole
um." The award is given in memory of the
man who is considered to be the "father" of
petroleum engineering.
Ramey, who holds the endowed pro
fessorship of Kelleen and Carlton Beal, has
been at the University since 1965. He has
also taught at Texas A & M University and
worked with both Mobil Oil Corporation
and Chinese Petroleum Corporation.
An active member of the Society of Petro

SPE Distinguished Author. He has also been
a Distinguished Lecturer.
The recipient of other awards from SPE,
Ramev has a bachelor of science degree and
doctoral degree in chemical engineering

chemical engineering.
When the last comparable survey was
conducted in 1969, the University was
ranked second in both electrical and me
chanical engineering and tied for fourth in
both civil and chemical engineering.
"We had hoped to be number one," said
Robert White, chairman of the electrical en

the University has arrived at this position af
ter being virtually "nowhere" before World
War 11. He postulated that the University

who are played by Christine ROum and
Scott Leland, have to make difficult de
cisions when war breaks out in their home
land, Bulgaria, in the late nineteenth cen

The play, which was written in 1894 and
was Shaw's first success, was subtitled both a
"romantic comedy" and an "anti-romantic
comedy" by Shaw. However, the author said
when the play was first produced that he
wanted the play to be appreciated not only

The play, which was written in 1894 and
was Shaw's first success, was subtitled both a
"romantic comedy" and an "anti-romantic
comedy" by Shaw. However, the author said
when the play was first produced that he
wanted the play to be appreciated not only
for the humor in it, but also for the message
that he was trying to get across.
Wind ensemble to play
A centennial salute to Percy Grainger will
be given by the Wind Ensemble at 8 p.m. on
Saturday, Dec. 4 at Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
Under the direction of Arthur Barnes, the
ensemble practices three times a week.
Members of the group include under
graduates, graduate students and other
Stanford community members. The group
usually presents theme concerts. Last
spring's concert featured selections by John
Philip Sousa.
Born an Australian in 1882, Grainger died
an American at age 79. He used English folk
songs and dance tunes as a basis for some of
his compostions for band, chorus and or
chestra.
The concert will include Grainger's Han
del in the Strand, The Immovable Do, Molly
on the Shore, The Power of Rome and the
Christian Heart, Country Gardens and Lads

of Wamphray.
Paule Reale's Concerto for Piano Trio and
Wind Ensemble which was written this year
will also be in the concert. The concerto,
which was written for the Mirecourt Trio, a
group from Grinnell College in lowa, was
funded bv a grant from the Jerome Founda
tion of Minnesota.
The trio is going to perform the Reale
piece on their way to Los Angeles where they
will make a recording of the concerto. The
trio includes Kenneth Goldsmith, who re
ceived his master's degree in music from the
University in 1968 and plays the violin,
Terry King, cello, and John Jensen, piano.
Van Siclen to speak
Charles Van Siclen will give a lecture on
the origin of pieces in the Stanford
Museum's Egyptian collection tonight at
7:30 in Terman Auditorium.
A graduate of the University in 1967, Van
Siclen is a fellow of the American Research
Center in Egypt, Inc. and a director of the
Babastis Research project.
Interested in the collection during his un
dergraduate years, Van Siclen is presently
cataloging the collection. He will choose a
few of the more interesting pieces for his talk
and will trace them back to their origins.
Van Siclen, who has done work in Egypt
since 1971, has been a lecturer for five Stan
ford Alumni Association Travel/Study Col
leges on the Nile.
"Morocco" film to be shown

palace in Rabat, the Kairouine Mosque
which has the world's oldest university,
Casablanca, Tangier and the Moslem shrine
of Moulav Idriss.
The film, however, is not limited to the
country's major sites as photographers trav
elled by camel caravan in order to reach
Zagora, the date capital which is located on
the edge of the Sahara.

Ramey chosen for award
The American Institute of Mining,
Metallurgical and Petroleum Engineers
(AIME) has awarded the 1982 Anthony F.
Lucas Gold Medal to Henry Ramey.
Ramey, who is the chairman of the petro
leum engineering department here, was
selected because of his numerous contribu
tions including work with thermal recovery
of oil, geothermal steam production and
well pressure behavior interpretation.
His work in thermal recovery has involved
burning air or gas in a well in order to facil
itate the removal of oil from the well by heat
ing the oil so that it moves more easily.
Ramev's work in geothermal steam pro
duction has involves taking steam out of the
earth and converting it into energy.
Well pressure behavior interpretation is
used by petroleum companies in order to de
termine the state of an oil well. Ramey takes

the readings from gauges on the rig and is
then able to determine what is going on in
the well. He can then tell the companies

whether it would be better to wait and drill
later or not.
AIME gives the award for "distinguished
achievement in improving the technique and
practice of finding and producing petrole
um." The award is given in memory of the
man who is considered to be the "father" of
petroleum engineering.
Ramey, who holds the endowed pro
fessorship of Kelleen and Carlton Beal, has
been at the University since 1965. He has
also taught at Texas A & M University and
worked with both Mobil Oil Corporation
and Chinese Petroleum Corporation.
An active member of the Society of Petro
leum Engineers (SPE), Ramey is currently a
SPE Distinguished Author. He has also been
a Distinguished Lecturer.
The recipient of other awards from SPE,
Ramev has a bachelor of science degree and
doctoral degree in chemical engineering
from Purdue University.
The award will be presented at AIME's
annual banquet on March 9, 1983.
Engineering depts. ranked
A survey of the quality of engineering fac
ulty at colleges nationwide has ranked the
University's mechanical engineering pro
gram second and electrical engineering tied
for second.
The survey, conducted by the Conference
Board of Associated Research Councils,
also ranked the University fifth in chemical
engineering and sixth in civil engineering.
Among other schools, UC-Berkeley's fac
ulty ranked first in civil engineering, second
in electrical engineering, third in mechanical
engineering, and fourth in chemical engi
neering. The Massachusetts Institute of
Technology (MlT)was rated first in both
electrical and mechanical engineering, sec
ond in civil engineering and seventh in
chemical engineering.
When the last comparable survey was
conducted in 1969, the University was
ranked second in both electrical and me
chanical engineering and tied for fourth in
both civil and chemical engineering.
"We had hoped to be number one," said
Robert White, chairman of the electrical en
gineering department. He emphasized that
the University has arrived at this position af
ter being virtually "nowhere" before World
War 11. He postulated that the University
was hurt in the ratings because, "both MIT
and Cal have combined computer science
and electrical engineering departments and
are twice as big when lumped together."

White said that he felt the electrical engi
neering department had to "do some work"
in the computer systems area of the depart
ment. Although he said that he would like to
see that aspect strengthened, he said that the
faculty is "right up there."
The survev was based on a nationwide
survey at 822 engineering faculties and was
funded by a 5500,000 grant from the Mellon,
Ford, and Sloan Foundations, the National
Institutes of Health, the National Science
Foundation and the National Academy of
Sciences.
Arms and The Man to open
The Drama Department's production of
Arms and The Man opens tonight at 8
o'clock in the Nitery. Written by George
Bernard Shaw, the play is directed by Ste
phen Weeks, a second-year doctoral stu
dent.
The play involves a conflict between the
ideals of a young couple and the reality that
they must face. Raina and Sergius, the leads
who are played by Christine ROum and
Scott Leland, have to make difficult de
cisions when war breaks out in their home
land, Bulgaria, in the late nineteenth cen
tury.
The play, which was written in 1894 and
was Shaw's first success, was subtitled both a
"romantic comedy" and an "anti-romantic
comedy" by Shaw. However, the author said
when the play was first produced that he
wanted the play to be appreciated not only
for the humor in it, but also for the message
that he was trying to get across.
