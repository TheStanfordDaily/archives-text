Reagan concentrates on tax legislation
Washington — In a concession to the political realities on Capitol Hill,
President Reagan scrapped the idea yesterday of asking Congress to speed
imposition of the 10 percent tax cut scheduled for July 1.
Reagan told reporters after a 40-minute strategy session with Republican
congressional leaders that they had agreed that the current special session
should put top priority on two administration programs: raising the federal
motor fuel tax from 4 cents to 9 cents per gallon to yield $5.5 billion yearly
for transportation maintenance, and enactment of tax concessions to foster
"enterprise zones" designed to revitalize blighted inner cities.
Meanwhile, there was criticism of the gasoline tax plan at a Senate Fi
nance Committee hearing and by local officials in interviews. They expressed
concern that the administration plan would allocate a third of the levy's pro
ceeds to construction of new highways, rather than to the repair of old roads,
bridges and transit systems.
The senators and local officials questioned the states' ability to raise
matching funds required for them to use revenue from the new 5 cent tax to
build and repair highways, bridges and transit systems. For example, Sen.
Bill Bradley (D-N.J.) said the measure's proposed elimination of mass tran
sit operating subsidies would "send shivers through New Jersey s transit
officials.
Reagan's decision not to seek the accelerated tax cut, which some of his
aides advocated as a stimulus to the flagging U.S. economy, followed several
warnings by GOP congressional leaders that it could not be passed at the
special session. Reagan skirted this question during a short appearance in
the White House briefing room shortly before he left on his Latin American
trip.
"While there continues to be interest in the possibility of accelerating the
economic stimulus provided by our tax program, we agreed that our most
important objective for this final session is to protect the cuts that are already
in place." Reagan said.
Asked if he was going to prod Congress on the tax cut, the president re
plied, "we're not going to make a push for that.
Some Democrats have said they will try to kill the final stage of the presi
dent's three-phase 25 percent tax cut before the final phase alO percent
reduction — goes into effect July 1. But Reagan said he left his meeting witfi
the GOP leaders persuaded that "the cut can be saved."
Reagan travels to Brazil
Brasilia, Brazil — President Reagan began a five-day, four-nation trip to
Latin America last night, preaching democracy and vowing to defend and
strengthen it throughout the hemisphere.
At an airport arrival ceremony where he was greeted by President Joao
Baptista Figueiredo, Reagan also praised Figueiredo's efforts to improve
Brazil's troubled economy, a frugal, no-frills policy Reagan finds especially
appealing.
