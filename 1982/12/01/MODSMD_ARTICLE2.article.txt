Reagan concentrates on tax legislation
Washington — In a concession to the political realities on Capitol Hill,
President Reagan scrapped the idea yesterday of asking Congress to speed
imposition of the 10 percent tax cut scheduled for July 1.
Reagan told reporters after a 40-minute strategy session with Republican
congressional leaders that they had agreed that the current special session
should put top priority on two administration programs: raising the federal
motor fuel tax from 4 cents to 9 cents per gallon to yield $5.5 billion yearly
for transportation maintenance, and enactment of tax concessions to foster
"enterprise zones" designed to revitalize blighted inner cities.
Meanwhile, there was criticism of the gasoline tax plan at a Senate Fi
nance Committee hearing and by local officials in interviews. They expressed
concern that the administration plan would allocate a third of the levy's pro
ceeds to construction of new highways, rather than to the repair of old roads,
bridges and transit systems.
The senators and local officials questioned the states' ability to raise
matching funds required for them to use revenue from the new 5 cent tax to
build and repair highways, bridges and transit systems. For example, Sen.
Bill Bradley (D-N.J.) said the measure's proposed elimination of mass tran
sit operating subsidies would "send shivers through New Jersey s transit
officials.
Reagan's decision not to seek the accelerated tax cut, which some of his
aides advocated as a stimulus to the flagging U.S. economy, followed several
warnings by GOP congressional leaders that it could not be passed at the
special session. Reagan skirted this question during a short appearance in
the White House briefing room shortly before he left on his Latin American
trip.
"While there continues to be interest in the possibility of accelerating the
economic stimulus provided by our tax program, we agreed that our most
important objective for this final session is to protect the cuts that are already
in place." Reagan said.
Asked if he was going to prod Congress on the tax cut, the president re
plied, "we're not going to make a push for that.
Some Democrats have said they will try to kill the final stage of the presi
dent's three-phase 25 percent tax cut before the final phase alO percent
reduction — goes into effect July 1. But Reagan said he left his meeting witfi
the GOP leaders persuaded that "the cut can be saved."
Reagan travels to Brazil
Brasilia, Brazil — President Reagan began a five-day, four-nation trip to
Latin America last night, preaching democracy and vowing to defend and
strengthen it throughout the hemisphere.
At an airport arrival ceremony where he was greeted by President Joao
Baptista Figueiredo, Reagan also praised Figueiredo's efforts to improve
Brazil's troubled economy, a frugal, no-frills policy Reagan finds especially
appealing.
Reagan spent most of yesterday in the air, flying 4400 miles in
8 Vi hours from Washington to Brazil's futuristic, 22-year-old na
tional capital.
The 71 -year-old president also will visit Colombia, Costa Rica
and Honduras before returning to Washington late Saturday
night. On the latter stops, he will also meet with Presidents
Alvara Magana of El Salvador and Efrain Rios Montt of
Guatemala.
Reagan expressed his own views on the trip during formal de
parture and arrival statements and in a lengthy written interview
with Latin American journalists. In conciliatory, diplomatic
words, the president indicated that the principal aims of the trip
are to emphasize U. S. support for the region's struggling demo
cratic institutions, the need for economic cooperation and the
threat of Communist-inspired insurgencies.
In an unorthodox interview, in which Reagan replied in writ
ing to questions submitted to him in advance, the president noted
that the administration is working with Latin American nations
"to help the actual and potential victims of Soviet-abetted,
Cuban-inspired attacks in the region" and declared: "We hold
the Soviet Union ultimately responsible for much of its (Cuban)
client's behavior."
Before departing the White House lawn by helicopter, Reagan
read a prepared statement proclaiming this "a journey for the
cause of democracy and peace."
"The four countries I am visiting have all had elections in the
past year," he said. "There is a strong democratic tide running in
the Americas, one of the most encouraging trends we have wit
nessed in a long time."
Stockman recommends budget cuts
Washington — Budget director David Stockman has ordered
deep cuts in federal health agencies for next fiscal year, including
20 percent personnel reductions for both the Food and Drug Ad
ministration and the Centers for Disease Control, it was learned
yesterday.
Those are two of the main federal agencies involved in protec
tion of the public health.
The CDC cut would occur in one year, the FDA cut over three
years.
The orders are contained in a budget document sent by Stock
man's Office of Management and Budget to the Department of
Health and Human Services on Nov. 23. A copy was obtained by
The Washington Post yesterday.
Similar documents have been sent to other departments for the
fiscal 1984 budget that President Reagan will send to Congress
early next year. The White House has already indicated that
budget will involve deep»further cuts in domestic spending pro
grams, on top of those cuts Reagan pushed through Congress in
each of the last two years.
Reagan has said he does not want either to increase taxes or to
moderate his defense buildup, which means that almost all the
burden of holding down the deficit will fall on the domestic side
of the ledger.
Indications from both parties are that Congress will resist
large further cuts, however, and the OMB orders can also still be
appealed to the president by HHS Secretary Richard Schweiker.
Schweiker successfully appealed some cuts last year; aides would
not say what he might do now.
Supreme Court considers abortion issue
Washington — A Reagan administration official urged the Su
preme Court yesterday to stop deciding so many abortion cases
and to give state legislatures much more freedom to regulate
abortion.
But when pressed during a Supreme Court hearing, U.S. Solic
itor General Rex Lee said the administration is not now asking
the justices to overturn Roe vs. Wade, the 1973 ruling that in ef
fect legalized abortion in this country.
"If that is an issue, it is an issue for another day," Lee told Jus
tice Harry Blackmun, the court's most fervent advocate of the
right to abortion and author of the 1973 ruling.
The solicitor general — the Department of Justice official who
represents the executive branch before the Supreme Court —
argued that legislatures are better than courts at resolving public
policy decisions and at balancing different interests or consti
tuencies.
That claim was disputed by Frank Susman, a St. Louis at-'
torney representing the Planned Parenthood Association, who
also argued before the court yesterday.
If the Supreme Court should let state legislatures make abor

tion decisions on their own, Susman maintained, then "constitu
tional rights would be bargained away by lobbying interests in
the state legislature ... (The administration's position) basically
would eliminate, in my opinion, the concept of fundamental con
stitutional rights."
Lee's and Susman's arguments provided the most dramatic
moments during three hours of hearings at the court on the valid
ity of laws passed in Virginia, Missouri and Akron, Ohio, to reg
ulate abortion. The justices are expected to rule on these laws by
mid-1983.
The abortion cases are the first ones the court has reviewed
since Justice Sandra Day O'Connor took her seat on the bench
last year. Justice O'Connor remained quiet during most of yes
terday's arguments, asking very few questions and giving no
clues as to how she may vote.
Kennedy not to run in '84 presidential race
Washington — Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.) was reported
yesterday night to have reached a decision on his 1984 political
plans, and widespread but unconfirmed reports were that he will
take himself out of the presidential race today.
Kennedy was not available for comment last night, and staff
members who were reachable said they could say nothing about
the subject until today. Junior staff members said Kennedy was
meeting late yesterday with his top aides. Dr. Lawrence Horwitz,
Carey Parker and Robert Shrum, presumably to prepare the an
nouncement.
But reports swept Capitol Hill and Democratic Party circles
that Kennedy, after a Thanksgiving weekend family gathering
on Cape Cod, had decided to yield to his children's pleas that he
not run in 1984.
The reports came from a variety of sources involved with Ken
nedy's recent re-election campaign and earlier Kennedy races,
and from friends of the senator and his family. None could be
confirmed, however.
Kennedy, who failed in his challenge to President Jimmy
Carter's re-nomination in 1980, has been leading in early polls of
Democrats' preference for the 1984 prize.
But most political observers think he faced a serious battle
from a field that is expected to include former Vice President
Walter Mondale, Sens. John Glenn of Ohio, Gary Hart of Colo
rado, Ernest Hollings of South Carolina and Alan Cranston of
California, former Florida Gov. Reubin Askew and perhaps
others.
NATO may install missiles in Europe
Brussels, Belgium — NATO defense ministers here yesterday
reaffirmed the Atlantic alliance's plans to install a new gener
ation of medium-range missiles in Europe if Soviet-American
disarmament talks fail to yield a satisfactory outcome.
The ministers stated their position in a communique prepared
for release last night by the NATO nuclear planning group as
part of the organization's winter meeting.
After hearing a report by Caspar Weinberger, U.S. Secretary
of Defense, on the status of the Geneva talks on limiting medi
um-range weapons, the ministers also reiterated their support for
the "zero option," the American proposal for the complete
elimination of medium-range missiles in Europe.
In a resolution adopted in December 1979, NATO decided to
start deployment in Europe of new medium-range cruise and
Pershing 2 missiles in the autumn of 1983, barring an agreement
at Geneva on limiting missile levels.
Following yesterday's discussion and re-endorsement of the
measure, Manfred Woerner, West German Defense Minister,
said that the NATO plans enjoyed the support of all alliance
members, including those countries where the missiles will not be
deployed. The missiles are scheduled to be stationed in Great
Britain, West Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Belgium
Under the zero option, the West would withdraw its plans for
the stationing of 108 Pershing 2 and 464 Cruise missiles in ex
change for the removal of 340 Soviet SS-20 missiles.
Arafat concludes Jordanian visit
Amman, Jordan — Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)
Chairman Yasser Arafat wound up a three day visit here yester
day with the creation of a joint PLO-Jordanian commission that
is to work up a compromise formula for peace negotiations for
King Hussein to take to President Reagan next month.
The 14-member joint commission is to try to find a way to
open negotiations with Israel for a return of the occupied West

Bank of the Jordan River and the Gaza Strip without the PLO
having to renounce its demands for an independent Palestinian
state and its insistence that it is the only legitimate representative
of the Palestinian people.
The Reagan peace plan, which was strongly criticized by the
PLCVs Central Council meeting in Damascus last week.excludes
any role by the PLO in negotiations for the West Bank and Gaza
and specifically precludes the establishment of an independent
state, preferring instead a West Bank and Gaza entity associated
with King Hussein's Jordan.
California storm wreaks havoc
The worst Pacific storm of the season crashed into California
with 70-mph winds and driving rains yesterday, triggering
mudslides, felling trees, sinking boats and cutting the power to a
half-million people.
At least five people died as the storm pounded the coast from
San Francisco to San Diego.
Snow falling in the mountains of California was expected to
build to 3 feet deep in places and a number of highways were
closed. Winter storm warnings calling for heavy snow also were
posted in the Lake Tahoe basin of Nevada and the northern half
of Arizona.
A blizzard on 14,162-foot Mount Shasta trapped six skiers for
10 hours before they were rescued, officials said.
In Hawaii, meanwhile, estimates of the damage from Hur
ricane Iwa had reached $181.5 million, with 480 dwellings de
stroyed and hundreds of others damaged. The Red Cross was
still feeding about 5000 people.
Forecasters in Honolulu, who had worried earlier in the day
about a new storm near Midway Island, said the threat of that
disturbance had diminished.
But the storm on the mainland hit full steam.
A Los Angeles utility worker was killed when a 110-ton crane
toppled in the high winds. A Napa man died when he fell into
storm-tossed Bodega Bay. A motorist in Camarillo was killed
when his car struck a bridge abutment and he was thrown
through the windshield into a swollen creek.
Two men died in traffic accidents in northern San Diego
County on Monday night and yesterday.
Economic indicator shows improvement
Washington — The government's main economic forecasting
gauge rose in October for the sixth time in seven months, but
neither government nor private economists read it as signaling a
major recovery from the 16-month-old recession.
Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige said that although
monthly gains are piling up for his department's forecasting
gauge, the Index of Leading Economic Indicators, the increases
have been smaller than those preceding previous recoveries.
The increases, for example, exceeded 2 percent for three con
secutive months at the end of the 1980 downturn. By com
parison, the Commerce Department said yesterday the rise in
October was just 0.6 percent.
The trend of modest increases in the index could mean that
Baldrige and most private analysts are right in saying that any
economic recovery is likely to be quite weak, at least at the begin
ning.
Baldrige also noted that a separate Commerce Department in
dex which measures current business activity was still heading
downward, and reached its lowest point of the recession in Octo
ber.
Dow Jones jumps more than 36 points
The stock market's best-known indicator surged yesterday in
one of if s best days fever, riding a wave of buying by institutional
investors that helped raise the market value of stock holdings by
$38 billion.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks rocketed 36.43
points, its fourth largest daily gain, to close at 1039.28.
