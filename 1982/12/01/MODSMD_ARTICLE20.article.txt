## Stanford rolls over Sonoma State with second half effort 
### STEVE ODELL 
Stanford blew open a close,
sloppilv-plaved contest, outscor
ing Sonoma State 32-7 in the final
12 minutes en route to a 73-42
nonconference victory last night
at Maples Pavilion.
The Cardinal, now 2-0, led by
only 29-25 at half, but took con
trol with 10:58 remaining, scor
ing II unanswered points to take
a 17-point advantage at 54-37.
There were 67 turnovers in the
game.
Sonoma committed 35 of the
turnovers, most of them coming
on Cardinal steals resulting from
an intense fullcourt press. Stan
ford had 32 of its own, 18 of them
in the first half when it tried to
jam the ball inside unsuccessfully
against a tightly-packed Sonoma
2-3 zone.
"I like to consider them as
growing pains," said Stanford
head coach Tom Davis of the
turnovers. "They're just things
we'll have to live with. We won't
really improve without going
through that.
"But 1 can't fault our guys for
their effort," Davis continued.
"The cohesion is there. We've
still got a long way to go, but I'm
very pleased with our progress."
Stanford guard Keith Jones
came off the bench to lead all
scorers with 24 points, pene

trating into the kev time and time
again for short jump shots. "I
thought Keith played real well,"
Davis said. "He gives us a dif
ferent dimension. We need him in
there."
Center John Revelli added 17
points and pulled down 10 re
bounds. Forward walk-on Andy
Fisher hauled in eight rebounds,
and guard Steve Brown had four
assists and four steals.
Ken Cooney, who led Sonoma
with 18 points before fouling out
with 4:47 remaining, stole a Jones
pass and scored on a solo lay-in
to bring Sonoma to within six at
43-37.
Moments later, Revelli con
verted on a three-point play,
powering inside to score while
being fouled by John Radford.
Jones made two foul shots after
being fouled inside following a
nifty pass inside from Keith
Ramee, and then Ramee stole a
pass and scored on a breakaway
lav-in to put Stanford ahead
50-37.
Another steal and basket by
Brown off a give-and-go pass
from Jones gave Stanford an 11-
point advantage, and Revelli
scored off an inbounds play un
der the Cardinal's own basket to
complete the streak.
Stanford kept up the on
slaught, pummeling Sonoma

over the final four and one-half
minutes by a 14-1 margin.
Davis had praise for the
Division 111 opponent, now O-l.
"I thought Sonoma State played
real well," he said. "They gave us
everything we could have wanted
in a game. They were com
petitive, they came after us, and
this is the kind of win that can
help our young ball club, as well
as theirs."
Sonoma could have well been
ahead at halftime, but its five
for-12 shooting at the foul line re
sulting from 15 Cardinal fouls
left the visitors four behind. Four
of the misses were on the front
ends of one-and-one op
portunities.
The Cardinal kept the pressure
on in the second half, and started

taking advantage of the numer
ous Sonoma errors to turn the
tight game into a rout. "I wasn't
pleased with the first half," said
Davis. "But that was with the ex
ecution, not the effort. I tried to
encourage them to keep scrap
ping (at halftime). I don't know
how many times we had two guys
ripping down the same rebound.
That was good to see.
"We just need to be a little
sharper and smoother. We wan
na be a scrappy ball club that
plays a little better. We've got a
long way to go, there's no ques
tion about that."
