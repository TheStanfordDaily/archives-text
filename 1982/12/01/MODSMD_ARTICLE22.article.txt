# Card receives bye in NCA A Tourney
## 
### STEPHEN STRENG 
The Stanford women's vol
leyball team's Thanksgiving
vacation was almost washed out
bv the remnants of Hurricane Ida
and two losses to No. l-ranked
University of Hawaii, but a ravof
sunshine peeked through the
storm when the Cardinal re
ceived a the No. 4 seed and a first
round bve in the NCAA playoffs.
The NCAA tournament seed
ings came out Monday while the
Cardinal was losing the second
match of a two-match series
against the Wahine. Stanford is
seeded in the South Regional at
the University of Houston, and
will play the winner of the
Southwest Missouri and Texas.
"We just need a break," said
head coach Fred Sturm, "we've
been on the road the last three,
four weeks. This break is a bless
ing. They need time to rest and
study and get ready for finals."
"We're planning on playing
Texas," said Shaw speculatingon
who the Cardinal's opponent
would be. Texas was ranked fifth
in the nation in the NCAA pre
season poll but faltered when one
of their key middle blockers was
injured early in the season.

"They're an interesting team,"
said Shaw. "We have to make
sure that our plavers don't over
look them."
If the Cardinal does win, thev
will probably plav either UOP or
Arizona. Stanford has split two
games with both teams during
the regular season.
In last year's tournament, the
Cardinal advanced to the quar
terfinals before bowing out to
eventual runner-up UCLA.
Hawaii is seeded No. I in the
Northwest Regional at Cal Polv
San Luis Obisbo.
The Cardinal lost the second
match to Hawaii in the fifth
game. Stanford lost the first
game 15-9 but bounced back to
take the next two 15-9 and 15-11.
The Cardinal was unable to
withstand a furious Hawaii
comeback, however, and lost the
final two games 15-5 and 15-11.
Stanford lost the first match in
straight games — 15-12, 15-9,
and 16-14. Stanford led 10-7 in
the first game and 14-7 in the sec
ond game before losing them
both.
Stanford has now lost to Ha
waii three times in the regular
season, but each time the Wahine
was aided bv Cardinal errors.
