Tom Ramsey of UCLA and
John Elway of Stanford, two of
college football's leading passers,
were named Co-Players of the
Year in the Pacific-10 and shared
the first-team quarterback desig
nation on the all-conference team
announced Monday.
The Cardinal also placed three
other players on the first team;
Chris Dressel (tight end), Vincent
White (running back), and
Vaughn Williams (defensive
back). Offensive lineman Chris
Rose was selected to the second
team.
Joe Kapp, the former Califor
nia quarterback who returned to
Berkeley this year and guided the
Golden Bears to a 7-4 record, was
named Coach of the Year. The
Bears were 2-9 last year.
The Rose Bowl-bound UCLA
Bruins landed only three players
on the 28-man All-Pac-10 team.
Wide receiver Cormac Carney
and defensive lineman Karl
Morgan joined Ramsev on the
squad. All three are seniors.
Pac-10 head coaches selected
the all-conference team, and the
first-place tie in Player of the
Year voting was only the second
in history. Quarterbacks Guy
Benjamin of Stanford and
Warren Moon of Washington
tied in 1977.
Ramsey, ranked No. 1 na
tionally in passing efficiency,

passed for 2824 vards and 21
touchdowns while allowing only
10 interceptions for the Bruins,
9-1-1. Elwav became the first
player in conference history to
pass for 3000 yards in one season,
totaling 3242, and finished his
college career with several Pac-10
and national records.
The Southern California Tro
jans had the most All-Pac-10 first
team selections, six including
nose guard George Achica who
made it a third time.
Washington's Jacque Rob
inson, leading rusher in the con
ference, was one of three
sophomores on the first team.
Oregon placed two players on
the team, senior defensive end
Mike Walter from Eugene, Ore.,
and kick returner Steve Brown
from Sacramento.
In the Coach of the Year vot
ing, also done by head coaches,
rookie coach Kapp edged Terry
Donahue of UCLA, Larry Smith
of Arizona, and Darrvl Rogers of
Arizona State in a close race.
