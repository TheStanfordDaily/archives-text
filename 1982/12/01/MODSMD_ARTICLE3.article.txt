The University has moved one step closer to filling three
key administrative vacancies, by the in-house appointment
of Robert Jaedicke, a professor of accounting, as the Stan
ford Graduate School of Business' new dean.
The appointment, announced early yesterday and effec
tive Jan. 1, leaves the University with only more two impor
tant positions to fill: the vice-president for public affairs and
the vice president of development.
While this is the first time in more than 20 years that the
University has selected a dean from its own faculty, students,
faculty and alumni have cited the 53-year-old dean's ex
perience and familiarity with the program as particularly
valuable. The last three deans were all prominent corporate
executives.
"He has been with the school a long time. He's ex
perienced. He knows the school. He's highly thought of by
the faculty and he's highly thought of in the business com
munity as well," said Stanford Business School alumnus and
Ed Littlefield, executive secretary of Utah International.
Jaedicke served as acting dean in 1979-80 and as associate
dean for academic affairs from 1969 to 1981. He currently
teaches a first-year accounting course and is nationally rec
ognized in the field of accounting.
Jaedicke will replace Rene McPherson who announced
his intention to resign in June, citing health and personal rea
sons.
The Graduate School of Business (GSB) was ranked first
in the nation by faculty peers and other business school
deans while Jaedicke was associate dean for academic af
fairs. It has attracted a large number of prominent faculty
and is currently touted the most selective of the nation's ma
jor business schools.
According to Hal Leavitt, a professor in the Business
School and head of the search committee, "He has a tremen
dous amount of integrity. He is trusted by everyone and he's
an excellent organizer, planner and designer."
Jaedicke's appointment marks the end of a four month na
tion-wide search conducted by a twelve-member search
committee. On the committee were faculty, student and
business representatives.
"We looked at a very large number of candidates. And
almost from the beginning Jaedicke served as a standard be
cause we all knew him and we found ourselves comparing
everybody we talked to with him, even though we had two or
. other serious candidates," Leavitt said.
"It was a serious search. It wasn't like we knew he was
; going to be dean all along," Leavitt said.
Shortly after the announcement yesterday morning,
Jaedicke said he was "overwhelmed" by his selection.
The new dean revealed a rough blueprint of his future
plans for the GSB:
"I would like to see the teaching and course development
strengthened, I would also like to see the research division
increased in the long run because the lifeblood of the
teaching process depends on the quality of the research," he
said.
Other changes Jaedicke said he foresees include a greater
emphasis on international business issues, environmental is
sues and programs to "help teachers do better in the
classroom."
During Jaedicke's tenure as associate dean for academic
affairs his most important achievements were "helping to
build the faculty and maintaining a balance in the cur
riculum and research," according to Leavitt.
"He has a strong sense of the balance that is needed be
tween theory and practice, teaching and research," Leavitt
said.

The dean of the business school also plays an important
role in soliciting funds. Some faculty members said they were
concerned that Jaedicke lacks the business "connections"
that a corporate executive might bring to the position.
"We worried about that," said Leavitt. "The question was
that if we had a person who was not a full-fledged member of
the business community that fund-raising might suffer, but
the overriding consensus from business people we talked
with was 'no.'"
"It isn't as if he is a virgin with regard to the business com
munity," Leavitt said. "But he'll have to work at it."
"I suppose he may not know as many chief executive of
ficers," said Noel Fenton, a search committe member and
Accurex chief executive, "but the important thing is that
Jaedicke is willing and able to go out there and make those
connections."
According to Nancy Barrow, search committee member
and co-president of theGSB Student Association, "The peo-

pie in the development office are going to be more of door
openers than they have been."
Student reaction to the appointment was generally
positive, although some students said they wee dissapointed
by the appointment of an insider.
"We were all a little surprised that they didn't go outside,
" 'said one second-year student. "1 thought that a dean
needed to be more in the eyes of the external environment
and industry."
Jaedicke is generally well-liked in the classroom, accord
ing to many students.
"I think he's awesome. He's very thorough. And he's
always really helpful and he'll always set time to talk with
you," a first-year student said.
Jaedicke is nationally recognized in his field and he has
won several awards for outstanding research articles, includ
ing two in a row from the National Association of Accoun
tants in 1961 and 1962 on use of quantitative methods in
planning and control within an organization.
Jaedicke holds bachelors and masters degrees in business
administration from the University of Washington, where
he graduated cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa. He received
his Ph.D. from the University of Minnesota in 1957.
Jaedicke has been a member of the Stanford faculty since
1961 when he left an assistant professorship in business ad
ministration at Harvard.
