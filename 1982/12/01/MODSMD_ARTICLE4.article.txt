The University, through the Office of
Student Activities, has decided to ap
propriate $ 10,000 for this year to ASSU
recycling, but has, according to Dean of
Student Affairs James Lyons, decided
not to fund recycling on a long-term
basis.
Because of this subsidy the ASSU fi
nance committee last night decided to
extend the deadline for closing recycl
ing, if no sources of long-term funding
had been found, from Dec. 10 to Apr.
15, 1983, at which time a decision will
be made by the senate as to whether to
close the project or not.
"We've said the University can help
out to the extent of $10,000, the intent
of which is to see if the recycling pro
gram can make a go of it," said Lyons.
He said that recycling must prove itself

economically feasible in order for it to
remain operational.
Lyons said that recycling was not
funded on a long-term basis because de
spite ASSU contentions to the con
trary, recycling does not save the Uni
versity any money. "Present capacity of
University trash hauling could absorb
that (garbage that recycling now col
lects) without additional cost,"he said.
However, Council of Presidents
member Mark Epstein disputed this.
"Jason (Mavis, director of facilities and
services) had very little documenta
tion" proving the University's point, he
said.
He did call the University's action "a
significant gesture" because all Univer
sity administrators, he said, face tight
budgets and thus giving money to
ASSU means that they would have to
cut money from other programs.

Even so, he cautioned the finance
committee members that the ASSU
might "find out that the University will
not give us more than $10,000." In fact,
he told the committee that Mavis had
said that he would recommend to the
University that no money would go to
recycling.
Finance committee member Sharon
Over asked Epstein why fee
assessments were not being considered
in funding recycling. Epstein said that
fee assessments were "inappropriate
sources of funding" because fee
assessments might fail and do not con
sider the long term aspects of funding
the project. However, he suggested that
fee assessments could be use to build up
a reserve for recycling.
Lyons suggested that this funding for
recycling indicated a new era in Univer

sitv-ASSU relations. "The hope that
the ASSU could become financially in
dependent through project revenues
just never materialized," he said. "It's
clear the University support of the
ASSU will have to be increased."
Epstein also reported to the commit
tee that negotiations between the Uni
versity and the ASSU were continuing
over what ASSU costs the University
would fund. He said that the ASSU had
suggested that the University fund all
costs associated with the ASSU that it
had to bear because of the Association
constitution.
The finance committee also passed
on to the senate more 1982-83 budget
cuts which trimmed funds for facilities
improvement from $3200 to $2200, and
which reduced a budget reserve account
from $2674 to $1500.
