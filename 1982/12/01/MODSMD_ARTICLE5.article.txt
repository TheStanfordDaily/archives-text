# Pre-trial hearing starts off O'Connor court action
## 
### KRISTEN CHRISTOPHER Senior staff writer 
Several victims of recent burglaries
which plundered more than $2 million
from their Peninsula homes took the
witness stflnd at a preliminary hearing
for suspects Robert and Maureen
O'Connor yesterday. The hearing, held
in San Jose Municipal Court, will de
termine whether the couple will be
questioned in Santa Clara County Su
perior Court.
On Monday, Lorraine O'Keefe, the
district attornev in the case, said the
prosecution has a very good chance of
winning. But Craig Collins, Maureen
O'Connor's attorney, said that no evi
dence connecting the O'Connors to the
burglaries was presented yesterday.
The two O'Connors have different

attorneys because Maureen O'Connor
is suing for divorce. They were arrested
on Nov. 11, after their children tipped
off police by telling them a cat, which
police think, was stolen by their parents,
had been taken to a house in Montara.
Robert O'Connor was found there,
while his wife was caught at their La
Honda residence. Both were charged on
eight counts, six of burglary, auto-theft
and possession of stolen property.
The most damaging evidence pre
sented against Robert O'Connor was a
letter he wrote to his children, accord
ing to Collins. When asked if O'Connor
admitted to committing the burglaries
in the letter, Collins said he would not
comment because he does not want to
incriminate Robert O'Connor, due to
the situation with his wife.
Collins is working to have Maureen

O'Connor separated from her husband
in the case. "Mv hope is that after
tomorrow the six counts of burglary
against Maureen will be dropped," he
said.
If those charges are dropped, she will
probably be taken out of custody "be
cause the likelihood of her going to
state prison is nil," according to Col
lins. The worst sentence Maureen
O'Connor would face if the charges
were dropped would be one year in the
county jail, he said.
It is not verv likelv that the other two
charges will be dropped, according to
Collins, because Maureen O'Connor
was found at the house with the car and
other stolen goods Being in possession
of stolen goods is enough evidence to
require a suspect to appear in Superior

Court, but for Mrs. O'Connor to be
convicted, it must be proved that she
knew the items were stolen.
A former wife of O'Connor's was
contacted bv Collins; "She testified that
at least in the last vear there was no in
dication that Maureen knew anything
about property being stolen," he said.
The hearing lasted until 5 p.m. yester
day and will be resumed at 9 a.m. today.
Evidence that the stolen property was
found in the La Honda home and vans
owned by the O'Connors will be pre
sented, Collins said. The hearing will
probably be completed by noon, he
added.
Arraignment in Superior Court will
take place 15 davs after the preliminary
hearing ends and the trial must begin
within 60 days after the arraignment.
