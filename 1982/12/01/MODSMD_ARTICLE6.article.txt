## Vietnam vets seeking support for rehabilitation efforts 
### MARY CATHERINE FISH 
"Would you like to help the
Vietnam veterans todav?" You
may remember being asked this if
you sauntered through White
Plaza during the first week of No
vember. The men stationed out
side the Bookstore were trying to
raise money for their choral
group, which was invited to per
form in Washington, D.C., as
part of Veteran's Day ob
servances there.
The choral group was formed
as part of a unique program at
the Menlo Park Veterans Admin
istration Medical Center. There,
about 60 combat veterans are en
rolled in a rehabilitation pro
gram for the treatment of stress
and readjustment problems. The
extremely successful in-patient
program was started in 1978, and
has since gained national recog
nition for its pioneering methods
and effectiveness.
The Young Vietnam Veterans
Program in Menlo Park is special
because, unlike its predecessors,
its approach is centered around
treating the deep-rooted problem

of post-traumatic stress, which
often encompasses the other
more specific and apparent prob
lems.
Statistics abound indicating
the quantity and complexity of

problems suffered bv veterans.
Of the 1.5 million who saw com
bat action in Vietnam, a quarter
of them were arrested within two
years of their return and 200,000
became drug addicts. The
divorce rate of veterans is twice
that of the general population

while the suicide rate is 23 per
cent higher.
During a Daily interview, Fred
(iusman, clinical director of the
program, talked about the nature
of stress and trauma experienced
by the Vietnam veterans and how
the center treats it. According to
(iusman, there are factors which
make the situation of the Viet
nam veteran unique.
He pointed out problems
rooted not onlv in the trauma of
combat experience, but also in
social and philosophical ele
ments whose psvchological ef
fects are not well understood and
are often neglected in formal
treatment.
Gusman says it is vital to ac
knowledge the significance ofele
ments such as the overturning of
norms and values. "When you
see corruption . . . and abuse and
mutilation ... all of a suddden
the reason for your existence goes
up in the air," he said. "Then vou
start to get bitter and become
paranoid."
He pointed to the fact that
many who went to Vietnam saw

the image of America as they per
ceived it crumble, "unlike in
World War I and World War II
where the whole country was be
hind the war and the social norms
and values were the things that
weren't touched."
When those who fought in
Vietnam returned, thev were ex
pected to carry on with their
lives, a severe readjustment. As
Ciusman put it, "In some sense
we sent children to be warriors
and what we got back were war
riors who were old men in some
respects and verv naive in oth
ers."
Since their lives were disrupted
at a crucial time of growth many
returned "still naive in a sense of

However, it became
increasingly apparent
that many veterans
were plagued by
severe disorders
symptomized by rage,
guilt, flashbacks,
nightmares, panic and
depression.

relationships .. . and responsi
bility and the ability to give and
take," Gusman continued.
Gusman went on to illustrate
the confusion a Vietnam veteran
had to deal with when he tried to
pick up the pieces of his life. "It's
like taking somebodv who has a
certain belief system that ev
erything is yellow and red and
you put them in a situation where
all they see is green," he ex
plained.
"You bring them back to
where they learned everything is
yellow and red and everybody
there is saying, 'Yes, it's still yel
low and red to a certain extent
but we're now also dealing with
purple.' Meanwhile you still
don't understand about this
green color you were exposed
to."
The program in Menlo Park
was one of the first to try to deal
with these aspects of the veteran's
problems. The study of post
traumatic stress is new; it was
made an official diagnosis of the
American PSvfchiatric Associa
tion in 1980.

In the past problems were put
into other general psychiatric
categories, or people were treated
for things like substance abuse
which were in reality outgrowths
of deeper suffering.
In the early 1970s the Veteran's
Administration was acting on the
conclusions of later refuted stud
ies claiming 80 percent success
rates for veteran transition back
to civilian life.
However, it became increas
ingly apparent that many veter
ans were plagued bv severe dis
orders svmptomized by rage,
guilt, flashbacks, nightmares,
panic and depression.
More recent studies began to
show that exposure to combat
was a key link to problems of vet
erans, over and above other fac
tors such as previous instability.
In 1981, a study done by the Cen
ter for Policy Research in New
York City concluded that more
than a third of those who saw
combat in Vietnam suffer from
"post-traumatic stress."
Much of the new research
about post-traumatic stress was
started dunng the early 1970s by
ydifcrans went back to school
'and entere'cf professions. There

wasn't much treatment available
during the late 1960s and early
19705. The matter was com
plicated because many veterans
were not willing to go to govern
ment institutions toward which

" When Ifirst came
home I talked about
being a vet... not too
popular a statement
to make," Pruitt said.
"Now I do want to
share what happened
to me through the
program with other
vets so they can get
their act together."

they had developed feelings of
anger, bitterness and distrust.
Some grass roots groups
sprung up which centered around
peer interaction, but they tended
to lack professional knowledge
and organization. In 1979 Con
gress appropriated $20 million to
establish 91 storefront courisd

ing centers in major cities
throughout the U.S. It appears,
however, that their funding will
be cut before the end of 1983.
It is likely that more programs
similar to the one at the Menlo
Park hospital will be set up in
other parts of the nation. Two
new ones patterned after the
Young Vets program have al
ready been started — one in Flor
ida and one in Chicago.
The Young Vietnam Veterans
program is predicated in self
help. People who enter the pro
gram, usually about five months
in length, often have reached a]
critical stage — a suicide attempt,
personal crisis such as divorce, or
other major obstacle to getting
their lives together.
The program is staffed with
professionals, some of whom are
veterans. Each individual is cqn
sidered with respect to his unique
personal experiences, and there
also is major emphasis on sharing
common experiences and form>-
ing peer group bonds.
