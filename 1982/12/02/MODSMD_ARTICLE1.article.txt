# Public Affairs searches for new vice president
## 
### Last in a three-part series. By DAVID AZRIN Senior staff writer 
University President Donald Ken
nedy has said that he will probably ap
point a Stanford insider to head the Of
fice of Public Affairs, and many Uni
versity administrators are quietly won
dering whose name will end up on the
-candidate list.
"There are good internal candidates
and we're likely to go in that direction,"
Kennedy said recently.
Robert Rosenzweig, the current vice
president for Public Affairs, will leave
the post in early 1983 to become presi
dent of the Association of American
Universities, a lobbying association
based in Washington, D.C..
Rosenzweig has been vice president
for Public Affairs since the office was

created in 1974. Members of the staff
said that Rosenzweig's performance
will prove a hard act to follow.
"If you go out and try to replace Bob
Roscnzwcig, you'll fall flat pp. your
face. You can't replace Bob Rosen
zweig because he has a unique set of
qualities," said Larry Horton, director
of Government Relations.
"You need somebody to do the same
things but in their own way," Horton
said.
Kennedy has asked Gerald
Lieberman. vice provost and dean of
graduate studies and research, to head a
six-member search committee to find
Rosenzweig's replacement, although
members of the committee have not yet
been selected.

Rosenzweig's move has created the
third crucial administrative vacancy in
the past year. A search committee is
currently attempting to fill the vice pres
ident for Development's position
vacated last June by Joel Smith; just
two days ago, Robert Jaedicke, a pro
fessor of accounting at the Graduate
School of Business, was named that
school's new dean.
According to Robert Freelen; as
sociate vice president for Public Affairs,
the new vice president for Public Affairs
will probably be chosen from within the
Office of Public Affairs, the Stanford
Law School or one of the public policy
institutes affiliated with University.
Freelen, himself, has been called a
prime candidate by some insiders. He
will become the acting vice president for
Public Affairs if the committe does not
find a replacement before Rosenzweig
resigns.
The Office of Public Affairs oversees
the offices of Events and Services, News
and Publications, Government Rela
tions, Community Relations and Uni
versity Relations. But one of its most
important functions has been lobbying
legislators in Washington, D.C. and
Sacramento on bills that affect the Uni
versity.
"Government relations are critical
for a University such as Stanford that
does a large amount of research,"
Freelen said.
"It's fairly evident that the part of the
University that faces outward has be
come more important in recent years,"
Rosenzweig said. "The University's re
lation with the government has become
more critical to its well-being."
According to Rosenzweig, the new
vice-president will have "a set of quali
ties and abilities that will be quite dif
ferent. And that will add a sense of vital
ity and charge which I think is good."
Rosenzweig has been outspoken on a
wide variety of issues which affect the
University. He has sharply criticized
legislation that would link financial aid
to draft registration and he has sup
ported imposing realistic tuition levels
in California's public colleges and Uni
versities. Rofenzweig has also lobbied
heavily against federal attempts to re
strict the free-flow of scientific informa
tion.
Rosenzweig recently co-authored an
AAU study entitled Research Univer
sities and Their Patrons. Freelen said


Robert Rosenzweig
the publication will probably have an
important effect on university research
policies nationwide.
According to John Vaughn, ex
ecutive assistant to the Washington
based AAU president and staff member
on the search committee that selected
Rosenzweig, "The two criteria that
we were looking for, and we found in
Bob, were a good knowledge of the run
ning of a research University and of
government relations."
"He was very talented, very knowl
edgeable and a very effective spokes

man on educational issues, particularly
the issues which the AAU works most
closely with: graduate and academic re
search."
Colleagues said that Rosenzweig's
best qualities include his good
judgment, easy-going manner and
knowledge of the University.
"His strongest point is good
judgment. He's an articulate spokes
man for research universities on a
broad range of policy issues," Horton
said.
Another office staff member com
mented that "in a very high pressure sit
uation he dosn't tend to get flustered.
The mild-mannered way he operates is
going to be missed."

Staff members said that Rosen
zweig's successor will have to bring the
same knowledge of government rela
tions and University operations to the
post.
"He needs a thorough understanding
of the University, what it stands for and
how it operates," Horton said. "He also
must be someone who has the con
fidence of the president."
According to Rosenzweig, the new
vice-president must have "experience
and knowledge of political processes"
and a "sensitivity to the nature of the
University and the processes through
which it does its business."
"And he has to be a nice guy like
me," Rosenzweig added.

Rosenzweig has been vice president
for Public Affairs since the office was

created in 1974. Members of the staff
said that Rosenzweig's performance
will prove a hard act to follow.
"If you go out and try to replace Bob
Roscnzwcig, you'll fall flat pp. your
face. You can't replace Bob Rosen
zweig because he has a unique set of
qualities," said Larry Horton, director
of Government Relations.
"You need somebody to do the same
things but in their own way," Horton
said.
Kennedy has asked Gerald
Lieberman. vice provost and dean of
graduate studies and research, to head a
six-member search committee to find
Rosenzweig's replacement, although
members of the committee have not yet
been selected.

Rosenzweig's move has created the
third crucial administrative vacancy in
the past year. A search committee is
currently attempting to fill the vice pres
ident for Development's position
vacated last June by Joel Smith; just
two days ago, Robert Jaedicke, a pro
fessor of accounting at the Graduate
School of Business, was named that
school's new dean.
According to Robert Freelen; as
sociate vice president for Public Affairs,
the new vice president for Public Affairs
will probably be chosen from within the
Office of Public Affairs, the Stanford
Law School or one of the public policy
institutes affiliated with University.
Freelen, himself, has been called a
prime candidate by some insiders. He
will become the acting vice president for
Public Affairs if the committe does not
find a replacement before Rosenzweig
resigns.
The Office of Public Affairs oversees
the offices of Events and Services, News
and Publications, Government Rela
tions, Community Relations and Uni
versity Relations. But one of its most
important functions has been lobbying
legislators in Washington, D.C. and
Sacramento on bills that affect the Uni
versity.
"Government relations are critical
for a University such as Stanford that
does a large amount of research,"
Freelen said.
"It's fairly evident that the part of the
University that faces outward has be
come more important in recent years,"
Rosenzweig said. "The University's re
lation with the government has become
more critical to its well-being."
According to Rosenzweig, the new
vice-president will have "a set of quali
ties and abilities that will be quite dif
ferent. And that will add a sense of vital
ity and charge which I think is good."
Rosenzweig has been outspoken on a
wide variety of issues which affect the
University. He has sharply criticized
legislation that would link financial aid
to draft registration and he has sup
ported imposing realistic tuition levels
in California's public colleges and Uni
versities. Rofenzweig has also lobbied
heavily against federal attempts to re
strict the free-flow of scientific informa
tion.
Rosenzweig recently co-authored an
AAU study entitled Research Univer
sities and Their Patrons. Freelen said


Robert Rosenzweig
the publication will probably have an
important effect on university research
policies nationwide.
According to John Vaughn, ex
ecutive assistant to the Washington
based AAU president and staff member
on the search committee that selected
Rosenzweig, "The two criteria that
we were looking for, and we found in
Bob, were a good knowledge of the run
ning of a research University and of
government relations."
"He was very talented, very knowl
edgeable and a very effective spokes

man on educational issues, particularly
the issues which the AAU works most
closely with: graduate and academic re
search."
Colleagues said that Rosenzweig's
best qualities include his good
judgment, easy-going manner and
knowledge of the University.
"His strongest point is good
judgment. He's an articulate spokes
man for research universities on a
broad range of policy issues," Horton
said.
Another office staff member com
mented that "in a very high pressure sit
uation he dosn't tend to get flustered.
The mild-mannered way he operates is
going to be missed."

Staff members said that Rosen
zweig's successor will have to bring the
same knowledge of government rela
tions and University operations to the
post.
"He needs a thorough understanding
of the University, what it stands for and
how it operates," Horton said. "He also
must be someone who has the con
fidence of the president."
According to Rosenzweig, the new
vice-president must have "experience
and knowledge of political processes"
and a "sensitivity to the nature of the
University and the processes through
which it does its business."
"And he has to be a nice guy like
me," Rosenzweig added.
University President Donald Ken
nedy has said that he will probably ap
point a Stanford insider to head the Of
fice of Public Affairs, and many Uni
versity administrators are quietly won
dering whose name will end up on the
-candidate list.
"There are good internal candidates
and we're likely to go in that direction,"
Kennedy said recently.
Robert Rosenzweig, the current vice
president for Public Affairs, will leave
the post in early 1983 to become presi
