## The 						Stanford Daily Taxing the jobless? No thanks. 
### 
The Thanksgiving Day announcement made by
the Reagan administration that it was considering
proposals to tax unemployment benefits provoked
such nation-wide outrage that the administration
was forced to abandon even considering the plan.
It is unknown whether the announcement was
leaked to be used as part of negotiating strategy for
the inevitable battles that President Reagan will
fight with a strengthened Democratic majority in
the House in the upcoming Congress, or if it was
merely a ma jor blunder on the part of White House
officials.
We find it ironic that the announcement came at
a time when millions of unemployed Americans
had little to be thankful for. But regardless of the
design behind the timing of the announcement, the
proposal seems K) be yet another indication of how
out of touch the present administration is with re
ality. In addition to exhibiting a callous disregard
for the needs of the unemployed, this idea repre
sents a seriously mistaken analysis about the rea
sons why the numbers of the jobless have greatly in
creased in the past few months.
The idea of taxing unemployment benefits as
sumes that an important reason why the ranks of
the unemployed are at record levels for the post-
World War II era is that unemployment pay is so
attractive that it induces people either to give up.
their job or not to search for work when laid oft.

Besides neglecting the psychological costs of idle
ness and uselessness that many of the unemployed
feel, this view ignores the amount of unemployment
benefits available.
The belief that people will voluntarily leave the
work force or hesitate to join it so they can collect
the $86 to $211 available per week in unemploy
ment benefits in the various states is a ludicrous
one. People are not living in luxury on salaries like
that, especially those who have to support an entire
household. And, of the 11 million jobless Ameri
cans, six million have already used up their un
employment benefits, and thus would be unaffected
by the tax.
As the Reagan administration scrambles to dis
tance itself from the proposal, which officials said
was only one of a number being studied at lower
"levels of the White House, one can only wonder
what motivated it to announce it at all. If it does
plan on using the proposal as a bargaining chip
which it will later agree to abandon for concessions
in other areas, the administration is playing a harm
ful and cyncial game with the lives of the un
employed. On the other hand, if it was seriously
considering the proposal as a means of reducing the
numbers of the jobless, it is showing complete ig
norance of the causes of unemployment which can
only hinder its efforts to bring the nation out of the
current recession.
