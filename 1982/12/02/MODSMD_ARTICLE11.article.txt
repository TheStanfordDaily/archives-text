# The
						Sound and the Fury
## We must limit first strike ability 
### 
The current widespread interest in
arms control and disarmament, like so
many social and political movements
that rapidly become the focus of public
attention, appears at times to lack a
firm historical and analytical founda
tion. The prominence of discussions of
the horrible effects of nuclear weapons
and of the excessively high numbers of
nuclear weapons that give both the
United States and the Soviet Union an
entirely unnecessary overkill capacity
are symptomatic of the misdirected an
alytical focus of some sectors of the dis
armament movement.

First in a Series

Nuclear weapons do have incom
prehensibly devastating effects and
both the United States and the Soviet
Union do have more than enough of
them to satisfy the need for deterring
nuclear war, but these facts have held
for some 20 years now and they are not
central to the very real and increasing
threat of nuclear war that we face. An
analysis of the development of nuclear
weapons and of the strategic doctrines
that accompany them indicates that we
do indeed stand at a historic crossroads,
with a choice between one path leading
through an accelerating and destabiliz
ing arms race to an eventual nuclear
holocaust and another which leads to
peace and stability through qualitative
limitations of nuclear arms.
When the United States emerged
from World War II as the sole possessor
of nuclear weapons, it envisioned its nu
clear weapons as an inexpensive de
terrent to contain Soviet conventional
weapon superiority in Europe. The
strategic doctrine of the United States
at that time was known as "massive re
taliation," which was an assertion by
the United States that it would respond
to any aggression with the means and
the location of its choice. This strategy
has also been labeled as a "war-fight
ing" strategy, because it envisioned the
possible use of nuclear weapons to fight
and win a war rather than simply de
terring others from using nuclear or
conventional weapons.
As the Soviet Union acquired weap
ons and Inter-Continental Ballistic
Missiles (ICBMs) in the mid- to
late-19505, the U.S. strategy of massive
retaliation became obsolete. U.S. nu
clear weapons became viewed as a de
terrent to Soviet nuclear weapons under
a strategic doctrine known as Mutually
Assured Destruction (MAD). The logic
of MAD had two requirements which
were fulfilled by the nuclear capabilities
of the United States and the Soviet
Union: both sides had to have nuclear
weapons that could survive a first strike
by the other and then inflict unaccep
table damage on any country making a
first strike. Stated conversely, both
countries had to be incapable of de
stroying each other's nuclear forces by a
first strike and both had to be vulner
able to unacceptable damage inflicted
by a second strike. As long as these two
conditions of survivability and vulner
ability existed, both countries would be
deterred from making a first nuclear
strike by the prospect of incurring unac
ceptable damage.
The strategy of MAD has never been
unequivocally accepted in either the
United States or the Soviet Union for a
variety of reasons. One of the most ob
vious of these is that MAD calls for
targeting the civilian population of the
adversary, known as countervaluc
targeting, rather than aiming missiles at
the other country's weapons, known as
counterforce targeting. While this satis
fies the requirements of MAD by mak
ing second strike forces survivable and
making both sides vulnerable to unac
ceptable damage, it seems ethically

counterintuitive.
A second reason is that the military
establishments of both the United
States and the Soviet Union are ori
ented toward war-fighting strategies
such as that of massive retaliation. The
very idea of a war without winners is al
ien to organizations designed to plan
and win wars and the results have been
that the military planners of both sides
have preferred to prepare for pro
tracted nuclear wars, such as that fore
seen in a recent defense study overseen
by U.S. Secretary of Defense Caspar
Weinberger, rather than accept the idea
that a nuclear conflict involves im
mediate and unacceptable destruction.
As a result of these objections to the
MAD strategy, both the United States
and the Soviet Union have pursued ac
tions that have served to undermine the
requirements of a stable deterrent bal
ance even though they seem reasonable
in themselves. One course of action that
both have pursued from time to time is
that of "damage-limiting," or attempt
ing to limit the destruction that would
be incurred in a nuclear war. While en
gaging in civil defense as a form of dam
age-limiting might appear reasonable,
it detracts from the strength of the de
terrents to nuclear war in that it de
creases the vulnerability of one side to
the second strike forces of the other. If
either side were ever able to reach the
goal of perfectly guarding itself against
nuclear attack so that it would suffer no
damage at all, then only moral force
and not reasoned self-interest would
prevent it from threatening or
launching a nuclear attack. Seen in this
light, "defensive" systems such as Anti-
Ballistic Missiles (ABMs, or missiles
designed to destroy incoming missiles)
are paradoxically destabilizing if they
are designed to protect cities since this
would undermine vulnerability, while
they promote survivability and stability
if they are designed to protect missiles.

The second course of action that has
been pursued by bo'h the United States
and the the Soviet Union has been a
war-fighting strategy, and the develop
ments in this direction brought about
by both sides have created the current
crisis of nuclear strategy that has left us
on the brink of disaster. As nuclear
weapons developed, it appeared to be
logical and natural to improve their
capabilities. Both sides accordingly de
veloped Multiple Independently
Targetable Reentry Vehicles (MIRVs)
â€” multiple warheads that could be
launched from a single missile. A
critical hiatus was reached when
MIRVs became accurate enough to de
stroy even hardened military targets
such as missile silos. As this develop
ment occurred in the 19705, defense
strategists such as then-Secretary of De
fense James Schlesinger argued that the
United States should use a counterforce
strategy and target Soviet missiles in ad
dition to targeting Soviet cities. A
MIRV missile with 10 warheads
could then destroy 10 missiles and 100
MIRV warheads.
The obvious problem with such a
strategy is that it rejects the deterrent
theory of M A D in favor of a war-fight
ing strategy. Just as a perfect defense

against nuclear missiles would under
mine deterrence by eliminating vulner
ability as a disincentive to nuclear war,
so, too. would a perfect offensive
capability which allowed either side to
destroy all or virtually all of the other's
missiles by a first strike undermine de
terrence by eliminating the requirement
of a survivable second strike force.
Even more probable, and therefore
more dangerous, is the possibility that
both sides might develop nuclear
capabilities that would allow one side to
destroy some but not all of the other's
nuclear forces, which would not totally
weaken deterrence but would nonethe
less give strong incentives to strike first
in a crisis situation in order to inflict
more damage than would be incurred
by the retaliatory second strike of the
enemy's damaged forces.
The more insidious implication of the
recent re-emergence of war-fighting
strategies is that, given the current
structure of nuclear forces, the line be
tween deterrent second strike
capabilities and offensive first strike
capabilities has become blurred. This
consequence is evident in the highly
publicized "window of vulnerability"
scenario in which one side could launch
a first strike using only some of its mis
siles to destroy the enemy's missiles,
while retaining the remainder of its mis
siles to deter a second strike response
from its adversary. In order to address
this possibility, both sides have engaged
in a new type of damage-limiting war
fighting strategy which requires missiles
which are both survivable and capable
of destroying the enemy's missiles, pre
sumably in order to destroy any reserve
missiles a first striking attacker might
hold. The problem with this develop
ment is that these are exactly the type of
weapons that would be used in a first
strike designed to destroy the ad
versary's missiles. It is thus not clear
whether deployment of such missiles is

intended as a defensive measure to
guard against a window of vulnerability
or as an aggressive preparation for a
first strike. Even more dangerous is the
fact that, regardless of the original in
tentions behind the deployment of
weapons capable of a first strike, the
capability for a first strike is developed
and might be used in a crisis situation.
This is in fact the crux of the current
nuclear dilemma. The danger of nuclear
war lies not in the fact that we have
many more missiles than are required
for deterrence, but in the fact that the
missiles that we are or soon will be ac
quiring are missiles of a first strike na
ture. Similarly, the danger is not that
nuclear war would be devastating, for
this deters us from war, but that the
shift to war-fighting strategies and
weapons makes nuclear war more prob
able. Any arms limitations that we
pursue should thus concentrate on
qualitative limitations of destabilizing
first strike weapons rather than focus
ing on secondary issues such as the
quantitative numbers of missiles and
warheads.
