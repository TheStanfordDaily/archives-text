## Waiting will not avert the crisis

"Then / said. How long, O Lord? And
he said: Until cities lie waste without in
habitant, and houses without men, and
the land is utterly desolate, and the Lord
removes men far away, and the forsaken
places are many in the midst of the land,
and though a tenth remain in it, it will be
burned again, like a terbinth or an oak.
whose stump remains standing when it is
felled. The holy seed is its stump."
Isaiah 6: 11-13
I thought of this passage when I read
Gary June and Michael Olvera's opin
ion piece (Daily, Nov. 10). The writers
of that column criticized those of us
who see Reaganornics and the interna
tional policies of the Reagan adminis
tration as fundamentally flawed. Their
final line is "It is simply too soon to
judge the outcome of Reagan's poli
cies." I believe that it is not too soon.
The outcome is all too plain to see.
What is at question is how long it will
take us, as a people, to respond to the
economic and social realities of our so
ciety in an interdependent world, or if
we can at all. 1f we believe the words de
livered to Isaiah, it will be a long and
bitter process, but one which leads to
hope.
Isaiah did not have to worry about
nuclear weapons. A new concern, an
nihilation for all, may mean that there is
no stump left at the end of the bitter
process. Even were June and Olvera to
be understood as counseling patience
and a dependence on God's ability to
do justice and to redeem the crisis, an
other way of telling prophets to be less
trite, myopic and loose with their
criticisms, annihilation presents an ur
gency. Letting human folly run its
course it not an ethical option in today's
world.
Criticism of President Reagan does
not depend on idealistic opinions about
the Carter years, or even nostalgia for
Presidents John Kennedy, Dwight Ei
senhower, Franklin Roosevelt or even
Abraham Lincoln. Nor arc these new
and untested ideas which, having theo
retical plausability, deserve a social test.
Trickle-down is as old as the radical dis
parity between wealth and power. Arms
races have led to countless wars and
have rarely, if ever, led to sound
diplomacy and peace. Deterrence is a
radically modern policy of desperation.
It is a departure from traditional moral
ity as expressed in war policies and un
derstandings of just wars, and it is de
fended as the only thing we can do. In
the words of Bob Dylan, "You don't
need a weatherman to know which way
the wind blows."
June and Olvera are not content with
criticizing those whose rhetorical ex
cesses or political interests have led to
debatable statements. Instead, they of
fer the same loose reasoning and
rhetorical overkill they criticize. Is it
obvious, as they claim, that "as na
tional income improves, the entire
country will benefit"? This is what was
claimed by Reaganornics and some
thing which David Stockman revealed
to be a political snowjob. I would refer
June and Olvera to Political Science
Prof. John Manley to learn the social
costs of inequality in a system where the
rich get richer and the poor poorer. But
I would also refer them to the real world
in which the unemployed and the vul
nerable are asked to bear the vast
weight of the costs of this plan for eco
nomic recovery. Trickle-down is the ec
onomics of oligarchy and always has
been. It has never met any ethical test
respecting the worth of individual life.
The classic expression of this ethic by
John Rawls, for example, holds that un
less the poorest person is absolutely
benefited , economic inequality is un
ethical. That test, and it is a conserva
tive one, is not being met today in this
country.
Olvera and June declare that the Rea
gan administration has a "definite
awareness of resource self-sufficiency"
while passing off James Watt as merely
"overzealous." I have yet to see the sup
port for mass transit and alternate
energy sources which would back up
this statement. I have seen a desire to
exploit the resources of public lands,
but not to see our resources as finite.
Where for example, is soil conservation
and alternatives to capital and resource
intensive agricultural production? Alt
Reagan has promised is an ever-expan
ding industrial consumption of re-

sources. That, and an end to regulations
which control pollution or were im
posed because of awareness that the
finiteness of natural resources
makes their wise and stewardship essen
tial for the future.
How many people have died in the
Cold War? Olvera and June seem to
think that none or few have, but the
facts are otherwise. The Cold War has
taken lives directly. Afghanistan and El
Salvador are the current expressions of
Cold War killing. Lebanon, Southern
Africa and Southeast Asia have also ex
perienced devastations which have been
caused or greatly exacerbated by the
Cold War. The Cold War made it im
possible to find domestic solutions to
conflicts in which America or the Soviet
Union find geopolitical significance.
And, of course, the tremendous waste
of resources, skills and creativity repre
sented by the nuclear weapons crisis has
meant, among other things, increased
death and suffering. How many people
has the Cold War killed? Think about
it. This is not peace.

Trickle-down is the economics of oligarchy and
always has been. It has never met any ethical test
respecting the worth of individual life.

And, do we really want to compare
the griminess of the pot and the kettle?
Olvera and June do not explain why El
Salvador is riot to be compared with Af
ghanistan and Poland. I am firmly op
posed to Soviet repression in Poland
and to the violence and death it is afflic
ting in Afghanistan. The latter seems to
compare to the level of murder we are
supporting in El Salvador, although I
would argue that Poland's affliction is
less murderous. I assume that June and
Olvera are claiming that Soviet repres
sion is much worse than American re
pression, but they don't say why.
Were we to press the comparison, I
believe we would find that Soviet re
pression is based on political interests at
least as plausible to their national secur
ity as we claim for our repressions. Af
ghanistan is located on the border of the
Soviet Union, and the Soviet Union has
good reasons to fear the revolt of non-
Western peoples within their empire.
The strategic importance of Poland to
them need not be debated. I believe the
best way we can support the reduction
of repression in these lands by the Sovi
et Union, is to reduce the level of threat
which makes them important for Soviet
security. The only way we can press a
moral argument would be to have a
moral base. Reagan chooses to do

neither.
My opposition to Reaganomics and
Cold War terrorists predate this admin-!
istration. I was raised in the belief that
America was a light of freedom in this
world. I was taught that trade and in
vestment in the world would lead to a
better life for the people of the world. I
have learned to my chagrin that we have
not supported freedom and have
created poverty through complicity
with tyrants to further our own in
terests. History Prof. David Potter
taught me that our nation was inspired
by the twin values of freedom and
equality. I have seen freedom for the
rich and economic coercion for the
poor. I have heard almost nothing of
human equality, even at the level of
rights from this administration, and
their economic policies reject equality
as a social value.
How long should we be silent in the
face of all this? To what hope from this
administration should I be looking?
Where is there any sanity in building
nuclear arms for peace in a world

burdened with genocide? Wher; is
there any hope for the aspiring peoples
of the world in an unleashed CIA anid
an aggressive geopoliticization of the
Cold War? Where indeed are the signs
of economic recovery, much less the vi
sion of economic justice in the nonsense
of Reaganomics?
Beyond Reagan, where is our
tional recognition that development
has not worked internationally and that
the realities of interdependence and the
finite nature of resources require more
than nostalgic myths. The answer is
that it will take time and suffering. We
will not let go of our myths until we see
that they don't work. In the vision giveo
Isaiah, the process has just begun. Rea*-
gan's role is to teach us the folly of oiy
ways.
But is is a dangerous process, and we
dare not wait until it is finished to speak
up for justice, to protest the despoil
ation of the earth or to expose the na
kedness of the emperor. I would hope
that critics and prophets could speak
with brilliant analyses to reveal the
truth. But I would rather have passion
than silence. As Olvera and June dem
onstrated, the critics can hardly dp
worse than the defenders.

conflicts in which America or the Soviet
Union find geopolitical significance.
And, of course, the tremendous waste
of resources, skills and creativity repre
sented by the nuclear weapons crisis has
meant, among other things, increased
death and suffering. How many people
has the Cold War killed? Think about
it. This is not peace.

Trickle-down is the economics of oligarchy and
always has been. It has never met any ethical test
respecting the worth of individual life.

And, do we really want to compare
the griminess of the pot and the kettle?
Olvera and June do not explain why El
Salvador is riot to be compared with Af
ghanistan and Poland. I am firmly op
posed to Soviet repression in Poland
and to the violence and death it is afflic
ting in Afghanistan. The latter seems to
compare to the level of murder we are
supporting in El Salvador, although I
would argue that Poland's affliction is
less murderous. I assume that June and
Olvera are claiming that Soviet repres
sion is much worse than American re
pression, but they don't say why.
Were we to press the comparison, I
believe we would find that Soviet re
pression is based on political interests at
least as plausible to their national secur
ity as we claim for our repressions. Af
ghanistan is located on the border of the
Soviet Union, and the Soviet Union has
good reasons to fear the revolt of non-
Western peoples within their empire.
The strategic importance of Poland to
them need not be debated. I believe the
best way we can support the reduction
of repression in these lands by the Sovi
et Union, is to reduce the level of threat
which makes them important for Soviet
security. The only way we can press a
moral argument would be to have a
moral base. Reagan chooses to do

neither.
My opposition to Reaganomics and
Cold War terrorists predate this admin-!
istration. I was raised in the belief that
America was a light of freedom in this
world. I was taught that trade and in
vestment in the world would lead to a
better life for the people of the world. I
have learned to my chagrin that we have
not supported freedom and have
created poverty through complicity
with tyrants to further our own in
terests. History Prof. David Potter
taught me that our nation was inspired
by the twin values of freedom and
equality. I have seen freedom for the
rich and economic coercion for the
poor. I have heard almost nothing of
human equality, even at the level of
rights from this administration, and
their economic policies reject equality
as a social value.
How long should we be silent in the
face of all this? To what hope from this
administration should I be looking?
Where is there any sanity in building
nuclear arms for peace in a world

burdened with genocide? Wher; is
there any hope for the aspiring peoples
of the world in an unleashed CIA anid
an aggressive geopoliticization of the
Cold War? Where indeed are the signs
of economic recovery, much less the vi
sion of economic justice in the nonsense
of Reaganomics?
Beyond Reagan, where is our
tional recognition that development
has not worked internationally and that
the realities of interdependence and the
finite nature of resources require more
than nostalgic myths. The answer is
that it will take time and suffering. We
will not let go of our myths until we see
that they don't work. In the vision giveo
Isaiah, the process has just begun. Rea*-
gan's role is to teach us the folly of oiy
ways.
But is is a dangerous process, and we
dare not wait until it is finished to speak
up for justice, to protest the despoil
ation of the earth or to expose the na
kedness of the emperor. I would hope
that critics and prophets could speak
with brilliant analyses to reveal the
truth. But I would rather have passion
than silence. As Olvera and June dem
onstrated, the critics can hardly dp
worse than the defenders.

whose stump remains standing when it is

Isaiah 6: 11-13
I thought of this passage when I read
Gary June and Michael Olvera's opin
ion piece (Daily, Nov. 10). The writers
of that column criticized those of us
who see Reaganornics and the interna
tional policies of the Reagan adminis
tration as fundamentally flawed. Their
final line is "It is simply too soon to
judge the outcome of Reagan's poli
cies." I believe that it is not too soon.
The outcome is all too plain to see.
What is at question is how long it will
take us, as a people, to respond to the
economic and social realities of our so
ciety in an interdependent world, or if
we can at all. 1f we believe the words de
livered to Isaiah, it will be a long and
bitter process, but one which leads to
hope.
Isaiah did not have to worry about
nuclear weapons. A new concern, an
nihilation for all, may mean that there is
no stump left at the end of the bitter
process. Even were June and Olvera to
be understood as counseling patience
and a dependence on God's ability to
do justice and to redeem the crisis, an
other way of telling prophets to be less
trite, myopic and loose with their
criticisms, annihilation presents an ur
gency. Letting human folly run its
course it not an ethical option in today's
world.
Criticism of President Reagan does
not depend on idealistic opinions about
the Carter years, or even nostalgia for
Presidents John Kennedy, Dwight Ei
senhower, Franklin Roosevelt or even
Abraham Lincoln. Nor arc these new
and untested ideas which, having theo
retical plausability, deserve a social test.
Trickle-down is as old as the radical dis
parity between wealth and power. Arms
races have led to countless wars and
have rarely, if ever, led to sound
diplomacy and peace. Deterrence is a
radically modern policy of desperation.
It is a departure from traditional moral
ity as expressed in war policies and un
derstandings of just wars, and it is de
fended as the only thing we can do. In
the words of Bob Dylan, "You don't
need a weatherman to know which way
the wind blows."
June and Olvera are not content with
criticizing those whose rhetorical ex
cesses or political interests have led to
debatable statements. Instead, they of
fer the same loose reasoning and
rhetorical overkill they criticize. Is it
obvious, as they claim, that "as na
tional income improves, the entire
country will benefit"? This is what was
claimed by Reaganornics and some
thing which David Stockman revealed
to be a political snowjob. I would refer
June and Olvera to Political Science
Prof. John Manley to learn the social
costs of inequality in a system where the
rich get richer and the poor poorer. But
I would also refer them to the real world
in which the unemployed and the vul
nerable are asked to bear the vast
weight of the costs of this plan for eco
nomic recovery. Trickle-down is the ec
onomics of oligarchy and always has
been. It has never met any ethical test
respecting the worth of individual life.
The classic expression of this ethic by
John Rawls, for example, holds that un
less the poorest person is absolutely
benefited , economic inequality is un
ethical. That test, and it is a conserva
tive one, is not being met today in this
country.
Olvera and June declare that the Rea
gan administration has a "definite
awareness of resource self-sufficiency"
while passing off James Watt as merely
"overzealous." I have yet to see the sup
port for mass transit and alternate
energy sources which would back up
this statement. I have seen a desire to
exploit the resources of public lands,
but not to see our resources as finite.
Where for example, is soil conservation
and alternatives to capital and resource
intensive agricultural production? Alt
Reagan has promised is an ever-expan
ding industrial consumption of re-

sources. That, and an end to regulations
which control pollution or were im
posed because of awareness that the
finiteness of natural resources
makes their wise and stewardship essen
tial for the future.
How many people have died in the
Cold War? Olvera and June seem to
think that none or few have, but the
facts are otherwise. The Cold War has
taken lives directly. Afghanistan and El
Salvador are the current expressions of
Cold War killing. Lebanon, Southern
Africa and Southeast Asia have also ex
perienced devastations which have been
caused or greatly exacerbated by the
Cold War. The Cold War made it im
possible to find domestic solutions to
conflicts in which America or the Soviet
Union find geopolitical significance.
And, of course, the tremendous waste
of resources, skills and creativity repre
sented by the nuclear weapons crisis has

take us, as a people, to respond to the
economic and social realities of our so
ciety in an interdependent world, or if
we can at all. 1f we believe the words de
livered to Isaiah, it will be a long and
bitter process, but one which leads to
hope.
Isaiah did not have to worry about
nuclear weapons. A new concern, an
nihilation for all, may mean that there is
no stump left at the end of the bitter
process. Even were June and Olvera to
be understood as counseling patience
and a dependence on God's ability to
do justice and to redeem the crisis, an
other way of telling prophets to be less
trite, myopic and loose with their
criticisms, annihilation presents an ur
gency. Letting human folly run its
course it not an ethical option in today's
world.
Criticism of President Reagan does
not depend on idealistic opinions about
the Carter years, or even nostalgia for
Presidents John Kennedy, Dwight Ei
senhower, Franklin Roosevelt or even
Abraham Lincoln. Nor arc these new
and untested ideas which, having theo
retical plausability, deserve a social test.
Trickle-down is as old as the radical dis
parity between wealth and power. Arms
races have led to countless wars and
have rarely, if ever, led to sound
diplomacy and peace. Deterrence is a
radically modern policy of desperation.
It is a departure from traditional moral
ity as expressed in war policies and un
derstandings of just wars, and it is de
fended as the only thing we can do. In
the words of Bob Dylan, "You don't
need a weatherman to know which way
the wind blows."
June and Olvera are not content with
criticizing those whose rhetorical ex
cesses or political interests have led to
debatable statements. Instead, they of
fer the same loose reasoning and
rhetorical overkill they criticize. Is it
obvious, as they claim, that "as na
tional income improves, the entire
country will benefit"? This is what was
claimed by Reaganornics and some
thing which David Stockman revealed
to be a political snowjob. I would refer
June and Olvera to Political Science
Prof. John Manley to learn the social
costs of inequality in a system where the
rich get richer and the poor poorer. But
I would also refer them to the real world
in which the unemployed and the vul
nerable are asked to bear the vast
weight of the costs of this plan for eco
nomic recovery. Trickle-down is the ec
onomics of oligarchy and always has
been. It has never met any ethical test
respecting the worth of individual life.
The classic expression of this ethic by
John Rawls, for example, holds that un
less the poorest person is absolutely
benefited , economic inequality is un
ethical. That test, and it is a conserva
tive one, is not being met today in this
country.
Olvera and June declare that the Rea
gan administration has a "definite
awareness of resource self-sufficiency"
while passing off James Watt as merely
"overzealous." I have yet to see the sup
port for mass transit and alternate
energy sources which would back up
this statement. I have seen a desire to
exploit the resources of public lands,
but not to see our resources as finite.
Where for example, is soil conservation
and alternatives to capital and resource
intensive agricultural production? Alt
Reagan has promised is an ever-expan
ding industrial consumption of re-

sources. That, and an end to regulations
which control pollution or were im
posed because of awareness that the
finiteness of natural resources
makes their wise and stewardship essen
tial for the future.
How many people have died in the
Cold War? Olvera and June seem to
think that none or few have, but the
facts are otherwise. The Cold War has
taken lives directly. Afghanistan and El
Salvador are the current expressions of
Cold War killing. Lebanon, Southern
Africa and Southeast Asia have also ex
perienced devastations which have been
caused or greatly exacerbated by the
Cold War. The Cold War made it im
possible to find domestic solutions to
conflicts in which America or the Soviet
Union find geopolitical significance.
And, of course, the tremendous waste
of resources, skills and creativity repre
sented by the nuclear weapons crisis has
meant, among other things, increased
death and suffering. How many people
has the Cold War killed? Think about
it. This is not peace.

Trickle-down is the economics of oligarchy and
always has been. It has never met any ethical test
respecting the worth of individual life.

And, do we really want to compare
the griminess of the pot and the kettle?
Olvera and June do not explain why El
Salvador is riot to be compared with Af
ghanistan and Poland. I am firmly op
posed to Soviet repression in Poland
and to the violence and death it is afflic
ting in Afghanistan. The latter seems to
compare to the level of murder we are
supporting in El Salvador, although I
would argue that Poland's affliction is
less murderous. I assume that June and
Olvera are claiming that Soviet repres
sion is much worse than American re
pression, but they don't say why.
Were we to press the comparison, I
believe we would find that Soviet re
pression is based on political interests at
least as plausible to their national secur
ity as we claim for our repressions. Af
ghanistan is located on the border of the
Soviet Union, and the Soviet Union has
good reasons to fear the revolt of non-
Western peoples within their empire.
The strategic importance of Poland to
them need not be debated. I believe the
best way we can support the reduction
of repression in these lands by the Sovi
et Union, is to reduce the level of threat
which makes them important for Soviet
security. The only way we can press a
moral argument would be to have a
moral base. Reagan chooses to do

neither.
My opposition to Reaganomics and
Cold War terrorists predate this admin-!
istration. I was raised in the belief that
America was a light of freedom in this
world. I was taught that trade and in
vestment in the world would lead to a
better life for the people of the world. I
have learned to my chagrin that we have
not supported freedom and have
created poverty through complicity
with tyrants to further our own in
terests. History Prof. David Potter
taught me that our nation was inspired
by the twin values of freedom and
equality. I have seen freedom for the
rich and economic coercion for the
poor. I have heard almost nothing of
human equality, even at the level of
rights from this administration, and
their economic policies reject equality
as a social value.
How long should we be silent in the
face of all this? To what hope from this
administration should I be looking?
Where is there any sanity in building
nuclear arms for peace in a world

burdened with genocide? Wher; is
there any hope for the aspiring peoples
of the world in an unleashed CIA anid
an aggressive geopoliticization of the
Cold War? Where indeed are the signs
of economic recovery, much less the vi
sion of economic justice in the nonsense
of Reaganomics?
Beyond Reagan, where is our
tional recognition that development
has not worked internationally and that
the realities of interdependence and the
finite nature of resources require more
than nostalgic myths. The answer is
that it will take time and suffering. We
will not let go of our myths until we see
that they don't work. In the vision giveo
Isaiah, the process has just begun. Rea*-
gan's role is to teach us the folly of oiy
ways.
But is is a dangerous process, and we
dare not wait until it is finished to speak
up for justice, to protest the despoil
ation of the earth or to expose the na
kedness of the emperor. I would hope
that critics and prophets could speak
with brilliant analyses to reveal the
truth. But I would rather have passion
than silence. As Olvera and June dem
onstrated, the critics can hardly dp
worse than the defenders.

"Then / said. How long, O Lord? And
he said: Until cities lie waste without in
habitant, and houses without men, and
the land is utterly desolate, and the Lord
removes men far away, and the forsaken
places are many in the midst of the land,
and though a tenth remain in it, it will be
burned again, like a terbinth or an oak.
whose stump remains standing when it is
felled. The holy seed is its stump."
Isaiah 6: 11-13
I thought of this passage when I read
Gary June and Michael Olvera's opin
ion piece (Daily, Nov. 10). The writers
of that column criticized those of us
who see Reaganornics and the interna
tional policies of the Reagan adminis
tration as fundamentally flawed. Their
final line is "It is simply too soon to
judge the outcome of Reagan's poli
cies." I believe that it is not too soon.
The outcome is all too plain to see.
What is at question is how long it will
take us, as a people, to respond to the
economic and social realities of our so
ciety in an interdependent world, or if
