Kennedy withdraws from 1984 race
Washington — Sen. Edward Kennedy said yesterday he won't seek or ac
cept the 1984 Democratic presidential nomination even though he believes it
was his to claim. With his children alongside, he cited "overriding" obliga
tions to them for the decision to dismantle a budding campaign.
"1 don't think there's any mystery I would like to be president," he said.
"Were the decision to be made solely on political grounds, I would have
made a different announcement today."
The withdrawal of the Massachusetts senator came 451 days before the
first presidential primary, in March 1984.
Kennedy, whose brothers John, then the president, and Robert, who tried
to be. were both assassinated, failed in a bid to wrest the Democratic nomi
nation from incumbent Jimmy Carter two years ago. But he was out front in
the early polls forthe 1984 contest. In stepping aside, he endorsed no other
contender, but held open that possibility.
The decision left former Vice President Walter Mondale as the frontrun
ner in an already crowded field of unannounced Democratic candidates.
Other liberals, including Rep. Morris Udall of Arizona, may now be en
couraged to step in in a bid for the Kennedy constituency. •
Kennedy's announcement was a political bombshell in Washington, even
though it was known his family was leaning hard against a 1984 campaign.
Kennedy met with the clan over Thanksgiving, and "they all support my de
cision. 1 think."
Kennedy had geared up to run, spending 000 on television com
mercials in Massachusetts even though his Senate re-election was assured,
beefing up his political and fundraising staff and authorizing aides to solicit
advice from campaign veterans about setting up another bid for the White
House.
In addition, two aides disclosed, Kennedy had commissioned polls in New
Hampshire as well as lowa and Illinois. They said he made his decision not to
run without knowing the results of the midwestern polls.
Mexican inaugural address somber
Mexico Cily — In one of the most somber inaugural addresses ever de
livered by a Mexican president, Miguel de la Madrid declared yesterday that
Mexico finds itself in a grave crisis that will demand austerity and "great
sacrifices."
"I cannot offer, in the immediate future, any substantial or rapid improve
ment in our situation," De la Madrid said during a 70-minute speech dealing
with the themes of economic recovery and public corruption.
Moments after donning the tricolor sash of office, the silver-haired De la
Madrid warned his countrymen that neither help from abroad nor magic
solutions could overcome the problems Mexico faces.
"I am aware that I assume office in difficult hours," De la Madrid an
nounced.
"Recovery will take time," he insisted, "at least two years. The first
months of the government will be arduous and difficult. The situation de
mands it. Austerity is mandatory."
A crowd of some 2500 legislators, federal officials, foreign diplomats, and
invited guests sat in attentive silence throughout the entire speech in Mexi
co's new congressional building.
