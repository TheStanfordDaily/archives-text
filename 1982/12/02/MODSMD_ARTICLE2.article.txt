Kennedy withdraws from 1984 race
Washington — Sen. Edward Kennedy said yesterday he won't seek or ac
cept the 1984 Democratic presidential nomination even though he believes it
was his to claim. With his children alongside, he cited "overriding" obliga
tions to them for the decision to dismantle a budding campaign.
"1 don't think there's any mystery I would like to be president," he said.
"Were the decision to be made solely on political grounds, I would have
made a different announcement today."
The withdrawal of the Massachusetts senator came 451 days before the
first presidential primary, in March 1984.
Kennedy, whose brothers John, then the president, and Robert, who tried
to be. were both assassinated, failed in a bid to wrest the Democratic nomi
nation from incumbent Jimmy Carter two years ago. But he was out front in
the early polls forthe 1984 contest. In stepping aside, he endorsed no other
contender, but held open that possibility.
The decision left former Vice President Walter Mondale as the frontrun
ner in an already crowded field of unannounced Democratic candidates.
Other liberals, including Rep. Morris Udall of Arizona, may now be en
couraged to step in in a bid for the Kennedy constituency. •
Kennedy's announcement was a political bombshell in Washington, even
though it was known his family was leaning hard against a 1984 campaign.
Kennedy met with the clan over Thanksgiving, and "they all support my de
cision. 1 think."
Kennedy had geared up to run, spending 000 on television com
mercials in Massachusetts even though his Senate re-election was assured,
beefing up his political and fundraising staff and authorizing aides to solicit
advice from campaign veterans about setting up another bid for the White
House.
In addition, two aides disclosed, Kennedy had commissioned polls in New
Hampshire as well as lowa and Illinois. They said he made his decision not to
run without knowing the results of the midwestern polls.
Mexican inaugural address somber
Mexico Cily — In one of the most somber inaugural addresses ever de
livered by a Mexican president, Miguel de la Madrid declared yesterday that
Mexico finds itself in a grave crisis that will demand austerity and "great
sacrifices."
"I cannot offer, in the immediate future, any substantial or rapid improve
ment in our situation," De la Madrid said during a 70-minute speech dealing
with the themes of economic recovery and public corruption.
Moments after donning the tricolor sash of office, the silver-haired De la
Madrid warned his countrymen that neither help from abroad nor magic
solutions could overcome the problems Mexico faces.
"I am aware that I assume office in difficult hours," De la Madrid an
nounced.
"Recovery will take time," he insisted, "at least two years. The first
months of the government will be arduous and difficult. The situation de
mands it. Austerity is mandatory."
A crowd of some 2500 legislators, federal officials, foreign diplomats, and
invited guests sat in attentive silence throughout the entire speech in Mexi
co's new congressional building.
Leaflets placed on each seat asked the audience to
withhold their applause until the end in deference to a re
quest by De la Madrid.
At one point, there was scattered applause when De la
Madrid devoted 11 lines of his 24-page speech to the ac
complishments of his predecessor, Jose Lopez Portillo.
But then the new president launched into a grim eco
nomic and social situation that he has inherited. He
portrayed Mexico as practically bankrupt, burdened by
government corruption and marred by social inequality.
Reagan lobbies for MX
Washington — The Reagan administration launched
an intensive intercontinental lobbying effort this week to
prevent the MX missile from being blown up on the pad
by the House Appropriations Committee Thursday in an
important test of President Reagan's defense buildup.
Reagan telephoned from Brazil on his tour of Latin
America to urge several committee members to vote
against an amendment sponsored by Rep. Joseph Ad
dabbo (D-N.Y.) to stop the MX from going into produc
tion.
Vice President Bush made similar calls here, while De
fense Secretary Caspar Weinberger phoned from Brus
sels, where he is attending a NATO alliance defense min
isters meeting, to argue that losing the MX vote would be
sending the wrong signal to the new leadership in the
Kremlin.
Pentagon research director Richard DeLauer and Air
Force generals at the Strategic Air Command in Omaha,
Neb., also were enlisted in the campaign to save the presi
dent's plan to put 100 MX intercontinental missiles, each
carrying 10 nuclear warheads, in a closely spaced "Dense
Pack" formation in Wyoming.
Addabbo said last night that the Reagan adminis
tration's lobbying effort had become so intense that he no
longer felt confident he would prevail in cutting $988 mil
lion for production of MX from the fiscal 1983 defense
appropriations bill now before the committee. He said
that the odds had shifted, declaring that he was going into
the committee session with 24 votes against 27 for Rea
gan, with the rest undecided.
Car bomb injures Lebanese leader
Beirut — Druze leader Walid Jumblatt, whose
militiamen have been fighting Christian troops in the
Shouf Mountains for the past month, was injured yester
day by a car bomb in West Beirut.
Six passersby were killed and 37 wounded in the ex
plosion, Beirut Radio said.
Jumblatt and his wife, who was also slightly injured,
were driving along Rue Hamra, Beirut's main business
thoroughfare, when the bomb was detonated.
The Druze leader, treated for minor facial cuts injuries
at nearby American University Hospital, issued a
statement declaring that "such acts do not serve the drive
for peace in Lebanon."
"I have expected such terrorist actions," he said.
"What is important is that we all overcome the crisis."
No one claimed responsibility for the blast, but there
seemed little no doubt that the bomb was directed at
Jumblatt, who took over a leftist coalition known as the
National Movement after his father, Kamal, was as
sassinated in 1978.
Since the Israelis invaded Lebanon in June, Jumblatt
'has remained an outspoken critic of any kind of alliance
with Israel.
Yesterday morning, Jumblatt met with Lebanese Pres
ident Amin Gemayel and former President Camille Cha
moun, both Christians, in an attempt to end the Druze-
Christian tensions in the Shouf mountains east of Beirut.
The Druze belong are an offshoot sect of Islam.
Jumblatt said that the talks had been successful.
Jumblatt had met on the same problem Monday with
U.S. special envoy Morris Draper. Draper, along with
U.S. envoy Philip Habib, are trying to formulate a plan
for the withdrawal of Israeli, Syrian and Palestine Liber
ation Organization forces from Lebanon, a task com
plicated by the continued fighting between the Druze and
the Christians.
U.S. to strengthen Brazilian ties
Brasilia, Brazil — The Reagan administration sought
yesterday to dramatically improve U.S. relations with

Brazil through a series of initiatives that includes a 51.23
billion loan to ease the serious financial difficulties of
Latin America's largest nation.
The 90-day loan, which Treasury Secretary Donald
Regan said would cushion Brazil pending the arrange
ment of long term financing from the International Mon
etary Fund, was the most important of several steps taken
yesterday to strengthen U.S.-Brazilian ties.
Other initiatives included a modest relaxation of sugar
import restrictions and the formation of four bi-national
working groups, one the first ever between the two coun
tries on science and technology and another that could
lead to restoration of military ties ended by Brazil in 1977
over dissatisfaction with the Carter administration.
Brazilian officials also took moves designed to increase
economic cooperation.
Before the U.S. delegation departs, Brazil is expected
to announce its agreement to a two year phase-out of a
series of export subsidies long opposed by the United
States. Brazilian officials pointed out that their country
supported key U.S. trade initiatives proposed at the meet
ing of Western trade ministers in Geneva last week.
Brazilian leaders and journals of opinion responded
positively to the U.S. initiatives and praised President
Reagan for his efforts to improve relations between the
two nations. However, Brazilian President Joao
Figueiredo also emphasized that his appreciaiton for
U.S. economic cooperation would not alter Brazil's de
termination to pursue an independent foreign policy ori
ented toward Africa and underdeveloped nations.
U.S. sees Japan as prime competitor
Tokyo — Undersecretary of Commerce Lionel Olmer
said.here yesterday that the Reagan administration will
soon issue a report that describes Japan as the No. 1 com
petitor of the United States in high technology and de
clares that U.S. industries vital to America's economy
and national defense "have their futures in some
jeopardy."
Olmer, who is here visting Japanese high-technology
businesses, said the report was in the final drafting stage
and would be issued "within a month or so."
He said the report will bring "sharply into focus...that
Japan is the No. 1 competitor of the United States in high
technology." The second salient conclusion, he said, is
that trade statistics indicate that U.S. high-technology in
dustries "have been in a state of declining competitive
ness."
According to Olmer, the report concludes that "in
dustries important to the United States for both econom
ic reasons as well as national security reasons have their
futures in some jeopardy."
After the report is issued, Olmer said the government
will follow it up by forming "specific domestic policies
tailored to specific domestic industries" to remove what
he called disincentives and impediments to the develop
ment of high technology. Policies involving taxes, anti
trust regulations, patents and technology transfers would
be reviewed, he said.
Olmer said the report covers such industries as tele
communications equipment, computers, semi
conductors, machine tools, robots, biotechnology, aero
space and pharmaceuticals.
He said the report also focuses on "foreign industrial
marketing practices" — or, in Japan's case, the practice
of the government's Ministry of International Trade and
Industry identifying growth industries and providing
them with incentives and subsidies for research and de
velopment.
Mayors discuss city economic woes
Los Angeles — The annual meeting of the National
League of Cities drew to a close yesterday with the same
somber tone that has persisted throughout the five-day
gathering of the country's largest municipal organiza
tion.
The 4000 mayors, council members and other local of
ficials who had arrived last weekend for what was billed
as the "Congress of Cities" departed from the Los Angel
es Convention Center with mixed feelings and little guar
antee that help is on its way to their financially
beleagured communities.
"The patient, if we might be considered the patient,
needs a transfusion during the operation or we're all

going to die on the table," said Mayor John Fedo of
Duluth, Minn.
"It is time for strong action and not words," added
Youngstown, Ohio, Councilman Herman Starks, whose
city's unemployment rate of nearly 19 percent is one of
the highest in the country.
Both men, along with representatives of eight other
cities, called a news conference yesterday to stress the
plight of their jobless workers and the burden of what
Fedo called the "worst domestic hardships since the
Great Depression."
Earlier in the day. Rep. Morris Udall (D-Ariz.) a critic
of the Reagan administration, was given a standing ova
tion by delegates after telling them they were the victims
of "a triple whammy" of less federal aid, tax cuts and the
higher cost of borrowing money for their municipalities.
The theme of cities in crisis was heard almost daily.
On Tuesday, Utah Gov. Scott Matheson, the chairman
of the National Governors Association, told the conven
tion that local governments, as well as state governments,
are in a state of financial siege.
Spacewalk rescheduled for Feb.
Washington — Two tiny plastic inserts worth less than
a nickel apiece and a magnetic sensor no bigger than the
head of a pin failed in the $2 million spacesuits worn by
two astronauts in flight last month, forcing cancellation
of their planned spacewalk the day before they returned
to Earth on the latest mission of the space shuttle Colum
bia.
So minuscule were the causes of the double-suit failure
that the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
said yesterday it will reschedule the canceled spacewalk
for the next flight, which is due to take place the first week
of February. Planned for just three days, the next flight
will be extended to five days to accommodate the space
walk.
The walk in space will be made by astronauts Story
Musgrave and Donald Peterson, who together with com
mander Paul Weitz and pilot Karol Bobko will make up
the four-man crew aboard the space shuttle Challenger,
which will be flying into space for the first time. Previous
flights have been made with the first shuttle, Columbia.
The spacewalk will be the first American spacewalk in
nine years.
Inspection by technicians at Houston's Johnson Space
Center showed that the device that was supposed to regu
late the oxygen pressure inside astronaut William
Lenoir's spacesuit was missing two tiny plastic inserts
that help to hold a pair of screws against a metal plate.
Documents showed the inserts were made last spring,
removed during a test last August and never re-inserted
to reseat the screws.
Further inspection of the spacesuit worn by astronaut
Joseph Allen revealed that one of two tiny magnetic sen
sors that run a fan feeding oxygen into the suit apparently
failed just after Allen put on the suit. No bigger than a
pinhead, this sensor may have been damaged prior to
flight.
Study attacks starch-blockers
The claim that dieters can painlessly cut calories by
taking starch-blockers with their meals has been as
saulted in a Baylor University study, reported in Thurs
day's New England Journal of Medicine.
High doses of the controversial diet pills, which were
recently forced off the market by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration, failed to cut absorption of calories in
volunteers given high-starch, spaghetti dinners.
While the results do not rule out the possibility that the
popular pills may have a long-term effect on weight loss,
they do contradict the primary claim of starch-blocker
advocates that the substance works by preventing the
breakdown of starches in the gut.
The obvious appeal of a pill that would allow dieters to
lose weight without cutting calories had made the starch
blockers a success in health-food stores throughout the
country.
In July, however, the FDA ordered manufacturers to
stop distributing the products, after reports that 32 pa
tients had been hospitalized with an assortment of com
plaints after taking the pills.
The FDA argued that the starch-blockers, made of
proteins extracted from kidney beans, were drugs and
could not be marketed without extensive testing to prove

to the agency's satisfaction that they were both safe and
effective.
In October, a federal district court judge upheld the
FDA and ordered seven manufacturers and distributors
to destroy supplies of the material. That judgment is now
under appeal.
Whether or not the starch-blockers actually blocked
the digestion of starch was "legally irrelevant," according
to FDA spokesman, Bruce Brown.
Marin to start low-interest mortgages
San Francisco — Marin County, the fifth wealthiest
county in the nation, is about to launch its own version of
a "trickle down" economic theory — but things won't
have very far to trickle.
Under a plan approved by the county Board of Super
visors and most of the county's incorporated cities, first
time Marin homebuyers earning up to 558,000 a year will
become eligible next year for government-backed, low
interest mortgages on homes costing up to 5160,000.
It's a step that seems bound to become politically con
troversial as the rest of the country continues to struggle
with problems of a depressed economy, unemployment
and the growing number of homeless. Put in affluent
Marin, just across the Golden Gate Bridge from San
Francisco, the move has caused barely a ripple.
"It hasn't engendered a lot of reaction," said County
Administrator John Barrows. "There were some ques
tions about how it would work procedurally when it
passed the supervisors. But there was no negative reac
tion, no opposition."
Tylenol suspect waives extradition
Los Angeles — Kevin John Masterson, sought for
questioning in the Tylenol poisoning case, was ordered to
return to Illinois on yesterday after he waived extradi
tion.
Masterson, 35, appeared in a Los Angeles courtroom
after spending the night in a padded cell, the result of a
violent incident in which he became enraged, scuffled
with jailers and smashed the toilet in his jail cell.
But appearing before Municipal Court Judge Michael
Tynan, the sandy-haired mechanic was calm and spoke
softly as he acknowledged that he had been apprised of
his right to fight extradition.
"1 think I understand it, yes," Masterson said as the
judge allowed him to read through the formal waiver he
had just signed.
Masterson, who was arrested Tuesday on an Illinois
charge of marijuana possession, was not formally ar
raigned on that charge yesterday. The only matter ad
dressed at his hearing was extradition.
The judge turned him over to two Illinois investigators
in the courtroom and told Masterson, "Good luck to
you, sir."
Market turns in mixed showing
The stock market turned in a mixed performance in
turbulent trading yesterday, failing to follow through on
Tuesday's broad advance.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks was buf
feted throughout the day, and closed down 8.19 points at
1031.09 after surging 36.43 points Tuesday.
During the course of the volatile session, the blue-chip
average was off more than 5 points at the end of the first
hour, up more than 10 points after three hours and vir
tually unchanged as the final hour of trading began.
Big-name issues that retreated from Tuesday's sharp
gains included General Motors, down IV* at 58'/fe; Procter
& Gamble, down 2Vs at 116 Vi; and Eastman Kodak,
down 2'/fo at 92V»..
Despite the retreat in the stock market's best-known
indicator, three stocks rose in price for every two that fell
on the New York Stock Exchange.
Today's weather
A few patches of morning fog today, otherwise fair and
a little warmer. Highs 55 to 60. Light winds. Areas of fog
tonight, otherwise fair. Lows in the upper 30s and 40s.
