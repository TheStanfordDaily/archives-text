## the 						evolution of DEVO 
### 
By LUKE COLE
Yes, the spuds are at it again. After a brief
one-year respite from their plastic pomp and
pompadours of New Traditionalists, our five fa
vorite suburban robots are back in action with
oh, no! it's devo!
Devo has been an intriguing anomaly in the
music world since they first emerged from
Akron. Ohio, in 1976. Dressed in yellow rubber
jumpsuits and 3-D glasses, they burst onto the
scene with Q. Are we not men? A. We are Devo!
and an appearance on Saturday Night Live, ex
posing America to their own brand of what was
then known as "New Wave." The strange new
sound of songs like "Mongoloid" and "Jocko
Homo" were the forum for expression of
Devo's theory of de-evolution, which holds that
we are slowly de-evolving back into apes —
"the fittest shall survive yet the unfit may live.
Biology is destiny."
Duty Now for the Future furthered these ideas
(ideals?), and showed that Devo was not just a
flash in the pan. A commercial if not critical
success, it furthered Devo's reputation as a
unique and innovative band — some people
loved them, some people hated them but almost
everyone had a reaction to them. Their concert
tour that summer was well received, with many
rubber-suited fans hopping and bopping in the
audience and eating up de-evolution as ex
pounded in Devo's fantastic pioneering video
performances (traditionally shown as part of
their concerts).
Slick promotion made them a household
word, and this was soon parlayed into a
merchandiser's dream with the advent of Club
Devo, which offered a full line of Devo leisure
wear and accessories ("If the spud fits, wear
it"). When Freedom of Choice appeared in early
1980 with a full catalog of garments and ac
coutrements guaranteed to make one the swing
ingest spudboy on the block, critics screamed
"commercialism, commercialism!" and let that
initial impression mar their views of the album
itself, which was their best yet. Still maintaining
their bizarre image, this time appearing in red
"energy domes" (which looked like inverted
flower pots), Devo burst into the top 10 with the
hit single "Whipit." They came out of the closet
and into the political arena with songs such as
"Freedom of Choice" and "Planet Earth" —
preaching the gospel according to Devo was
nothing new, but the mixture of social commen
tary along with the familiar twisted love songs
and ballads of suburban anxiety was an interest
ing twist. The album also showed that they were
not afraid of journeying from their already es
tablished style of techno-rock into still more in
novative areas, blending synthesizers and elec
tronic percussion to form a more harmonious
sound.

In 1981, an ill-fated live album came and
went with little media fanfare and less fan atten
tion. That fall, though, Devo redeemed them
selves with New Traditionalists, a powerful, bit
ing album that further revealed their political
tendencies — songs such as "Beautiful World"
and "We're Through Being Cool" highlighted a
subtly cynical lineup of techno-pop. Sporting
polyethylene pompadours, the group hit the
TV. concert and talk-show circuit, not as a
brilliant new musical force but as an eccentric
old one that refused to go away. No longer an
avant garde fringe group, it was in the main
stream of the rock world, in reputation and
album sales if not in sound and image. "Work
ing in a Coal Mine," their sexually suggestive
single that was sold with the album, was used in
the movie Heavy Metal, further solidifying
Devo's place in the "established" music world.
They were "big name" stars.
What is one to expect from a deviant "big
name" band after five years of evolution (or
possibly, de-evolution)? Will they forsake their
energy domes for the long hair and spandex
pants of other "supergroups" of the '80s? The
answer is no, or rather, oh, no! it's devo!
Their latest album is pure Devo — upbeat
and innovative, yet still possessing Devo's
unique style and sound, honed and polished
over the course of six albums. The cover photo
montage. surely one of the most imaginative in
recent years, shows that band with human
heads and potatoes as bodies, as if to prove their
de-evolution has occurred, oh, no! it's devo! is a
technically tight, mature album; not unflawed,
but certainly equal to or better than their pre
vious albums (if one can compare apples and
oranges — Devo's style has changed and
mutated to the point that their early stuff
sounds a great deal different from the more so
phisticated sound of oh, no! it's devo!). The

message (be it political or social commentary,
or basic spud wisdom) of the songs is not lost in
the music, and the lyrics are as off the wall and
intriguing as ever.
"time out for fun" is the introductory song,
and sets the tone for the whole album: slightly
cynical and slightly mocking, but lively and fun
nonetheless. The underlying motif of a majority
of the songs seems to be contradiction and jux
taposition, with our fearless spud leaders en
lightening us as to the evils of the real world.
so your life has just begun
somebody else is saying that it's done
nurses whisper others grin
somethings funny at your expense again
"peek-a-boo!" is prime Devo commentary
("If you cannot see it you think its not there/it
doesn't work that way"), and an enjoyable if
somewhat simple song. The mocking tone of
the album is nowhere more prevalent than here,
where the background chortles of "ha ha ha ha"
seem less a part of the lyrics than a jab at the
listener, "she's out of sync" is an energetic
ballad with slightly unfathomable lyrics, about
a girl who's "out of luck, her body split from her
mind" and who is a destructive force to be
avoided. This is a song that even I can't read
anything into, but it is good listening.
"explosions" I can take or leave, though the
powerful, driving song (possibly anti-nuke?
sarcastic at least) has excellent video possi
bilities, especially with the devious minds of
Devo working on it. Drummer Alan Myers gets
a chance to show off his electronic percussion
techniques, and Mark Mothersbaugh's vocals
are emotional and perfectly timed, but syn
copated explosions take a lot away from the
musical quality of the song.
My favorite song on the album is the last song

on side one, "that's good." The song is getting
the most airplay (not saying very much) and is
fantastic — a forceful rythmn and beat are
maintained by drummer Myers, and Bob
Casale's synthesizer riffs are great. It's a song
with a message, too, much like "Beautiful
World" of New Traditionalists, a classic Devo^

statement:
now let's have a great big hand
for everybody who can understand
life's a bee without a buzz
it's going great till you get stung
and let us not forget to toast
everyone who might have missed the boat

The first song on the second
side showcases Mark Mother
sbaugh's impressive voice —
plaintive and pleading, he injects
"patterns" with emotion and
character. The best keyboards on
the album (synthetic, of course)
are to be found on the get-up
and-go song "big mess," with
synthesizers and reminiscent of
"Snoball" or "Ton o' Luv" off
Freedom of Choice.

These first songs off side two are good solid
music, but the next four are less strong, falling
off in comparison to a great side one. "speed
racer" is an amusing tune, but is the least musi
cally pleasing piece on the album. It's primitive,
crude and reminds me of the song "Can U Take
It" off the bootleg album of the same name —
the latter came out in 1979 and I thought Devo
had outgrown this type of experimentation.
"what i must do" is also the type of song
Devo does not seem to be able to escape (maybe
they don't want to, but I wish they would); very
matter of fact, almost sermonizing lyrics set to a
syncopated and often cacophonous beat — in
short, boring. It provides pleasant background
music but does not stand well on its own. "i de
sire" also falls into this trap. Slower than the
rest of the album, it is a love song in Devo
mode. an ode to a woman that turns sour in the
last verse: "i pledge allegiance to the fact/that
you're wise to walk away/for nothing is more
dangerous/than desire when it's wrong."
"deep sleep" winds up the album, which ov
erall I think is fantastic. The first side and sever
al of the songs on side two show that Devo has
not lost their innovative and imaginative touch,
but the album also shows that they are still car
rying around some of their past mistakes. I am
still confused, however, as to why they adopted
the ee cummings' idiosyncracy of not using cap
ital letters — but that's Devo. Look for them,
this winter in the Bay Area. . .

oranges — Devo's style has changed and
mutated to the point that their early stuff
sounds a great deal different from the more so
phisticated sound of oh, no! it's devo!). The

message (be it political or social commentary,
or basic spud wisdom) of the songs is not lost in
the music, and the lyrics are as off the wall and
intriguing as ever.
"time out for fun" is the introductory song,
and sets the tone for the whole album: slightly
cynical and slightly mocking, but lively and fun
nonetheless. The underlying motif of a majority
of the songs seems to be contradiction and jux
taposition, with our fearless spud leaders en
lightening us as to the evils of the real world.
so your life has just begun
somebody else is saying that it's done
nurses whisper others grin
somethings funny at your expense again
"peek-a-boo!" is prime Devo commentary
("If you cannot see it you think its not there/it
doesn't work that way"), and an enjoyable if
somewhat simple song. The mocking tone of
the album is nowhere more prevalent than here,
where the background chortles of "ha ha ha ha"
seem less a part of the lyrics than a jab at the
listener, "she's out of sync" is an energetic
ballad with slightly unfathomable lyrics, about
a girl who's "out of luck, her body split from her
mind" and who is a destructive force to be
avoided. This is a song that even I can't read
anything into, but it is good listening.
"explosions" I can take or leave, though the
powerful, driving song (possibly anti-nuke?
sarcastic at least) has excellent video possi
bilities, especially with the devious minds of
Devo working on it. Drummer Alan Myers gets
a chance to show off his electronic percussion
techniques, and Mark Mothersbaugh's vocals
are emotional and perfectly timed, but syn
copated explosions take a lot away from the
musical quality of the song.
My favorite song on the album is the last song

on side one, "that's good." The song is getting
the most airplay (not saying very much) and is
fantastic — a forceful rythmn and beat are
maintained by drummer Myers, and Bob
Casale's synthesizer riffs are great. It's a song
with a message, too, much like "Beautiful
World" of New Traditionalists, a classic Devo^

statement:
now let's have a great big hand
for everybody who can understand
life's a bee without a buzz
it's going great till you get stung
and let us not forget to toast
everyone who might have missed the boat

The first song on the second
side showcases Mark Mother
sbaugh's impressive voice —
plaintive and pleading, he injects
"patterns" with emotion and
character. The best keyboards on
the album (synthetic, of course)
are to be found on the get-up
and-go song "big mess," with
synthesizers and reminiscent of
"Snoball" or "Ton o' Luv" off
Freedom of Choice.

These first songs off side two are good solid
music, but the next four are less strong, falling
off in comparison to a great side one. "speed
racer" is an amusing tune, but is the least musi
cally pleasing piece on the album. It's primitive,
crude and reminds me of the song "Can U Take
It" off the bootleg album of the same name —
the latter came out in 1979 and I thought Devo
had outgrown this type of experimentation.
"what i must do" is also the type of song
Devo does not seem to be able to escape (maybe
they don't want to, but I wish they would); very
matter of fact, almost sermonizing lyrics set to a
syncopated and often cacophonous beat — in
short, boring. It provides pleasant background
music but does not stand well on its own. "i de
sire" also falls into this trap. Slower than the
rest of the album, it is a love song in Devo
mode. an ode to a woman that turns sour in the
last verse: "i pledge allegiance to the fact/that
you're wise to walk away/for nothing is more
dangerous/than desire when it's wrong."
"deep sleep" winds up the album, which ov
erall I think is fantastic. The first side and sever
al of the songs on side two show that Devo has
not lost their innovative and imaginative touch,
but the album also shows that they are still car
rying around some of their past mistakes. I am
still confused, however, as to why they adopted
the ee cummings' idiosyncracy of not using cap
ital letters — but that's Devo. Look for them,
this winter in the Bay Area. . .


By LUKE COLE
Yes, the spuds are at it again. After a brief
one-year respite from their plastic pomp and
pompadours of New Traditionalists, our five fa
vorite suburban robots are back in action with
oh, no! it's devo!
Devo has been an intriguing anomaly in the
music world since they first emerged from
Akron. Ohio, in 1976. Dressed in yellow rubber
jumpsuits and 3-D glasses, they burst onto the
scene with Q. Are we not men? A. We are Devo!
and an appearance on Saturday Night Live, ex
posing America to their own brand of what was
then known as "New Wave." The strange new
sound of songs like "Mongoloid" and "Jocko
Homo" were the forum for expression of
Devo's theory of de-evolution, which holds that
we are slowly de-evolving back into apes —
"the fittest shall survive yet the unfit may live.
Biology is destiny."
Duty Now for the Future furthered these ideas
(ideals?), and showed that Devo was not just a
flash in the pan. A commercial if not critical
success, it furthered Devo's reputation as a
unique and innovative band — some people
loved them, some people hated them but almost
everyone had a reaction to them. Their concert
tour that summer was well received, with many
rubber-suited fans hopping and bopping in the
audience and eating up de-evolution as ex
pounded in Devo's fantastic pioneering video
performances (traditionally shown as part of
their concerts).
Slick promotion made them a household
word, and this was soon parlayed into a
merchandiser's dream with the advent of Club
Devo, which offered a full line of Devo leisure
wear and accessories ("If the spud fits, wear
it"). When Freedom of Choice appeared in early
1980 with a full catalog of garments and ac
coutrements guaranteed to make one the swing
ingest spudboy on the block, critics screamed
"commercialism, commercialism!" and let that
initial impression mar their views of the album
itself, which was their best yet. Still maintaining
their bizarre image, this time appearing in red
"energy domes" (which looked like inverted
flower pots), Devo burst into the top 10 with the
hit single "Whipit." They came out of the closet
and into the political arena with songs such as
"Freedom of Choice" and "Planet Earth" —
preaching the gospel according to Devo was
nothing new, but the mixture of social commen
tary along with the familiar twisted love songs
and ballads of suburban anxiety was an interest
ing twist. The album also showed that they were
not afraid of journeying from their already es
tablished style of techno-rock into still more in
novative areas, blending synthesizers and elec
tronic percussion to form a more harmonious
sound.

In 1981, an ill-fated live album came and
went with little media fanfare and less fan atten
tion. That fall, though, Devo redeemed them
selves with New Traditionalists, a powerful, bit
ing album that further revealed their political
tendencies — songs such as "Beautiful World"
and "We're Through Being Cool" highlighted a
subtly cynical lineup of techno-pop. Sporting
polyethylene pompadours, the group hit the
TV. concert and talk-show circuit, not as a
brilliant new musical force but as an eccentric
old one that refused to go away. No longer an
avant garde fringe group, it was in the main
stream of the rock world, in reputation and
album sales if not in sound and image. "Work
ing in a Coal Mine," their sexually suggestive
single that was sold with the album, was used in
the movie Heavy Metal, further solidifying
Devo's place in the "established" music world.
They were "big name" stars.
What is one to expect from a deviant "big
name" band after five years of evolution (or
possibly, de-evolution)? Will they forsake their
energy domes for the long hair and spandex
pants of other "supergroups" of the '80s? The
answer is no, or rather, oh, no! it's devo!
Their latest album is pure Devo — upbeat
and innovative, yet still possessing Devo's
unique style and sound, honed and polished
over the course of six albums. The cover photo
montage. surely one of the most imaginative in
recent years, shows that band with human
heads and potatoes as bodies, as if to prove their
de-evolution has occurred, oh, no! it's devo! is a
technically tight, mature album; not unflawed,
but certainly equal to or better than their pre
vious albums (if one can compare apples and
oranges — Devo's style has changed and
mutated to the point that their early stuff
sounds a great deal different from the more so
phisticated sound of oh, no! it's devo!). The

By LUKE COLE
Yes, the spuds are at it again. After a brief
one-year respite from their plastic pomp and
pompadours of New Traditionalists, our five fa
vorite suburban robots are back in action with
oh, no! it's devo!
Devo has been an intriguing anomaly in the
music world since they first emerged from
Akron. Ohio, in 1976. Dressed in yellow rubber
jumpsuits and 3-D glasses, they burst onto the
scene with Q. Are we not men? A. We are Devo!
and an appearance on Saturday Night Live, ex
posing America to their own brand of what was
then known as "New Wave." The strange new
sound of songs like "Mongoloid" and "Jocko
Homo" were the forum for expression of
Devo's theory of de-evolution, which holds that
we are slowly de-evolving back into apes —
"the fittest shall survive yet the unfit may live.
Biology is destiny."
Duty Now for the Future furthered these ideas
(ideals?), and showed that Devo was not just a
flash in the pan. A commercial if not critical
success, it furthered Devo's reputation as a
unique and innovative band — some people
loved them, some people hated them but almost
everyone had a reaction to them. Their concert
tour that summer was well received, with many
rubber-suited fans hopping and bopping in the
audience and eating up de-evolution as ex
pounded in Devo's fantastic pioneering video
performances (traditionally shown as part of
their concerts).
Slick promotion made them a household
word, and this was soon parlayed into a
merchandiser's dream with the advent of Club
Devo, which offered a full line of Devo leisure
wear and accessories ("If the spud fits, wear
it"). When Freedom of Choice appeared in early
1980 with a full catalog of garments and ac
coutrements guaranteed to make one the swing
ingest spudboy on the block, critics screamed
"commercialism, commercialism!" and let that
initial impression mar their views of the album
itself, which was their best yet. Still maintaining
their bizarre image, this time appearing in red
"energy domes" (which looked like inverted
flower pots), Devo burst into the top 10 with the
hit single "Whipit." They came out of the closet
and into the political arena with songs such as
"Freedom of Choice" and "Planet Earth" —
preaching the gospel according to Devo was
nothing new, but the mixture of social commen
tary along with the familiar twisted love songs
and ballads of suburban anxiety was an interest
ing twist. The album also showed that they were
not afraid of journeying from their already es
tablished style of techno-rock into still more in
novative areas, blending synthesizers and elec
tronic percussion to form a more harmonious
sound.

In 1981, an ill-fated live album came and
went with little media fanfare and less fan atten
tion. That fall, though, Devo redeemed them
selves with New Traditionalists, a powerful, bit
ing album that further revealed their political
tendencies — songs such as "Beautiful World"
and "We're Through Being Cool" highlighted a
subtly cynical lineup of techno-pop. Sporting
polyethylene pompadours, the group hit the
TV. concert and talk-show circuit, not as a
brilliant new musical force but as an eccentric
old one that refused to go away. No longer an
avant garde fringe group, it was in the main
stream of the rock world, in reputation and
album sales if not in sound and image. "Work
ing in a Coal Mine," their sexually suggestive
single that was sold with the album, was used in
the movie Heavy Metal, further solidifying
Devo's place in the "established" music world.
They were "big name" stars.
What is one to expect from a deviant "big
name" band after five years of evolution (or
possibly, de-evolution)? Will they forsake their
energy domes for the long hair and spandex
pants of other "supergroups" of the '80s? The
answer is no, or rather, oh, no! it's devo!
Their latest album is pure Devo — upbeat
and innovative, yet still possessing Devo's
unique style and sound, honed and polished
over the course of six albums. The cover photo
montage. surely one of the most imaginative in
recent years, shows that band with human
heads and potatoes as bodies, as if to prove their
de-evolution has occurred, oh, no! it's devo! is a
technically tight, mature album; not unflawed,
but certainly equal to or better than their pre
vious albums (if one can compare apples and
oranges — Devo's style has changed and
mutated to the point that their early stuff
sounds a great deal different from the more so
phisticated sound of oh, no! it's devo!). The

message (be it political or social commentary,
or basic spud wisdom) of the songs is not lost in
the music, and the lyrics are as off the wall and
intriguing as ever.
"time out for fun" is the introductory song,
and sets the tone for the whole album: slightly
cynical and slightly mocking, but lively and fun
nonetheless. The underlying motif of a majority
of the songs seems to be contradiction and jux
taposition, with our fearless spud leaders en
lightening us as to the evils of the real world.
so your life has just begun
somebody else is saying that it's done
nurses whisper others grin
somethings funny at your expense again
"peek-a-boo!" is prime Devo commentary
("If you cannot see it you think its not there/it
doesn't work that way"), and an enjoyable if
somewhat simple song. The mocking tone of
the album is nowhere more prevalent than here,
where the background chortles of "ha ha ha ha"
seem less a part of the lyrics than a jab at the
listener, "she's out of sync" is an energetic
ballad with slightly unfathomable lyrics, about
a girl who's "out of luck, her body split from her
mind" and who is a destructive force to be
avoided. This is a song that even I can't read
anything into, but it is good listening.
"explosions" I can take or leave, though the
powerful, driving song (possibly anti-nuke?
sarcastic at least) has excellent video possi
bilities, especially with the devious minds of
Devo working on it. Drummer Alan Myers gets
a chance to show off his electronic percussion
techniques, and Mark Mothersbaugh's vocals
are emotional and perfectly timed, but syn
copated explosions take a lot away from the
musical quality of the song.
My favorite song on the album is the last song

on side one, "that's good." The song is getting
the most airplay (not saying very much) and is
fantastic — a forceful rythmn and beat are
maintained by drummer Myers, and Bob
Casale's synthesizer riffs are great. It's a song
with a message, too, much like "Beautiful
World" of New Traditionalists, a classic Devo^

statement:
now let's have a great big hand
for everybody who can understand
life's a bee without a buzz
it's going great till you get stung
and let us not forget to toast
everyone who might have missed the boat

The first song on the second
side showcases Mark Mother
sbaugh's impressive voice —
plaintive and pleading, he injects
"patterns" with emotion and
character. The best keyboards on
the album (synthetic, of course)
are to be found on the get-up
and-go song "big mess," with
synthesizers and reminiscent of
"Snoball" or "Ton o' Luv" off
Freedom of Choice.

These first songs off side two are good solid
music, but the next four are less strong, falling
off in comparison to a great side one. "speed
racer" is an amusing tune, but is the least musi
cally pleasing piece on the album. It's primitive,
crude and reminds me of the song "Can U Take
It" off the bootleg album of the same name —
the latter came out in 1979 and I thought Devo
had outgrown this type of experimentation.
"what i must do" is also the type of song
Devo does not seem to be able to escape (maybe
they don't want to, but I wish they would); very
matter of fact, almost sermonizing lyrics set to a
syncopated and often cacophonous beat — in
short, boring. It provides pleasant background
music but does not stand well on its own. "i de
sire" also falls into this trap. Slower than the
rest of the album, it is a love song in Devo
mode. an ode to a woman that turns sour in the
last verse: "i pledge allegiance to the fact/that
you're wise to walk away/for nothing is more
dangerous/than desire when it's wrong."
"deep sleep" winds up the album, which ov
erall I think is fantastic. The first side and sever
al of the songs on side two show that Devo has
not lost their innovative and imaginative touch,
but the album also shows that they are still car
rying around some of their past mistakes. I am
still confused, however, as to why they adopted
the ee cummings' idiosyncracy of not using cap
ital letters — but that's Devo. Look for them,
this winter in the Bay Area. . .
