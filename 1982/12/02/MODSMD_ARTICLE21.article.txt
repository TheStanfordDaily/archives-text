# Bucking the trend: 10 good 'bad' movies
## 
### STEVE VINEBERG 
One of the heroes of David
Lodge's novel Changing Places,
an English professor, invents a
game called Humiliation in
which each player thinks of a fa
mous literary work he has never
read and garners points for each
of the other players who has read
it. (You have to humiliate your
self in order to score or prevent
someone else from scoring.) An
alternative pastime for movie
buffs might be a game in which
each participant admits to liking
an unpopular movie and gets
points for everyone in the room
who hated it. Undeniably, a
bandwagon syndrome operates
in movies: with a blockbuster like
Ordinary People or Raiders of the
Lost Ark or Chariots of Fire,
word of mouth is so overwhelm
ingly positive (or, to put it anoth
er way, the ad campaign is so tri
umphantly aggressive) that dis
liking it is tantamount to brand
ing yourself a renegade, even
though you may recognize how
shamelessly the filmmakers are
manipulating you or how tacky
the craftsmanship is or how
many older movies have been
pilfered in the process of arriving
at a finished product. Similarly,
bad press attaches itself to certain
films, or even certain directors,
like a stench. People who have
never seen a picture by Sam
Peckinpah will tell you how re
pulsively violent his work is, and
Brian De Palma's reputation for
misogyny and plagiarism,
though based on preposterous
misreadings of his movies, pre
cedes him wherever one opens. (
Blow Out, one of the best Ameri
can films of the last few years,
was defeated almost before any
one had seen it. Not only did
some misguided feminists try to
use it, like his Dressed to Kill, to
justify their disgust with movies

depicting violence against wom
en — as if De Palma's pictures
championed psychopaths! — but
astute historians like New West's
Stephen Farber were careful to
point out that parts of it were
"stolen" from Antonioni's Blow-
Up. Presumably De Palma was
careless enough to steal the title
from Antonioni, too.)

Many worthy films disappear
because of incompetent ad cam
paigns (All Night Long) or be
cause audiences (and many
critics) are bewildered by their
unusual tone (Southern Comfort)
or style (Pennies from Heaven);
months later, when one surfaces
by chance at a local rep house
and you recommend it to a
friend, you're likely to receive a
skeptical, perhaps amused re
sponse, as if you were being de
liberately eccentric. But surely, in
a high-stakes business like that of
making and packaging movies,
where distributors and ad
vertisers play us for fools every
week, the mere fact that a movie
has caught fire with the popular
audience isn't a guarantee of
quality — any more than it is an
assurance that the filmmakers
had only the basest commercial
motives. (The Empire Strikes
Back, Superman II and E. T. all
succeeded at the box office, but
to dismiss them out of hand for
that reason would be to fall into
what Stanley Kaufmann once
termed "a trap for snobs.") Simi
larly, the fact that a movie has
sunk without a trace, as All Night
Long did, is an unfair criterion
for determining how good or bad
it is.
When I submitted a positive
review of Fast Times at Ridge
mont High a couple of weeks ago,
even some of my colleagues at the
Daily were appalled. Although
few of them had actually seen the
film, they were convinced that it
must be awful: a teen exploita
tion picture with ads that sug
gested it should be double-billed
with Zapped! or National Lam
poon's Class Reunion. With their
incredulity, and that of other
friends, as an impetus, 1 compiled
the following list of movies re
leased in the last five or six years
that I believe have been unjustly

maligned — fully conscious as I
did so that confessing my fond
ness for these films is more likely
to place my sanity as a critic in
doubt than to redress the wrongs
perpetrated on a handful of tal
ented writers and directors. Here,
then, is my strategy for a winning
game of Movie Buffs' Humil
iation.

Caveman
Caveman (1981): Carl Got
tlieb's comedy (his first) has the
consistent inventiveness of the
best sketches from Saturday
Night Live or, in an earlier dec
ade, Your Show of Shows, and it is
ineffably sweet-natured. The
jokes derive from the humor in
herent in discovery: Ringo Starr
and his companions keep stumbl
ing across terrific new ideas like
music or walking erect. Starr's
performance is so canny and
cleverly timed that, in comic
terms, his status as chief in
novator seems totally believable
because he's obviously smarter
than anyone else around. He and
Dtjnnis Quaid (a neglected actor
who has been excellent in a varie
ty of roles — in Breaking Away,
The Long Riders, All Night Long.
The Night the Lights Went Out in
Georgia) are a Stone Age Laurel
and Hardy, slightly redefined: in
this case the Laurel figure
(Quaid) is a dumb sensualist and
the Hardy character is an un
conscious intellectual. These two
share the screen with a deft sup
porting cast: Shelley Long,
Barbara Bach, John Matuszak,
the gifted Jack Gilford as a
blissed-out nitwit and a quartet
of enchanting prehistoric
monsters who perform loony,
poetic dances when they are hun
gry or lonely.

Eyes of Laura Mars
Eyes of Laura Mars (1978):
The discrepancy between Irvin
Kershner's talent and his status
in Hollywood is remarkable. He
has been making good movies for
two decades and several of them
(like Loving and The Return of a
Man Called Horse) have been ex
traordinary, but even after the
commercial success of The Em
pire Strikes Back, people don't
recognize his name. (Most mov
iegoers think that George Lucas,
the producer, was responsible for
Kershner's work on it.)
Kershner's low profile may de
rive in part from his refusal to
work in a recognizable style: an
American Louis Malle, he moves
easily from one project to anoth
er, seeking a new approach to
each one and thus frustrating
auteur hunters. Eyes of Laura
Mars, made two years before
l Empire, disturbed audiences be
cause of its offbeat combination
of a glitzy milieu (the world of
fashion photography) and a re
markably unpleasant dramatis
personae (every one of the char
acters is forbidding in some way)
— and because it is such a hyp
notic piece of filmmaking. Faye
Dunaway (in a rare good per
formance) plays a photographer
whose violent, sexy work arouses
the ire of a psychopath, and
Kershner surrounds her with fine

actors — Tommy Lee Jones,
Rene Auberjonois, Brad Dourif.

Flash Gordon
Flash Gordon (1980): As vil
lainous Emperor Ming, Max
Von Sydow sports a long,
double-pointed Vandyke, Gothic
spire eyebrows and a Fu Manchu
moustache that could bore twin
holes in an enemy's back; this ex
travagantly silly, imaginatively
kitschy comic strip fantasy liber
ates a rich parodistic wit he's nev
er displayed before. The director,
Mike Hodges, dresses his actors
(Sam Jones and Melody An
derson as Flash and Dale Arden,
and a talented supporting cast —
Topol, Peter Wyngarde, Brian
Blessed, Mariangela Melato, Or
nella Muti) in outer costumes
and places them against
elaborate sets to get a cardboard
cut-out effect. The movie looks
like a nursery full of toys blown
up to absurd proportions. It's a
delirious, infectious comedy with
a screamingly funny script by
Lorenzo Semple (who used to
write Batman for TV).

The Fury
The Fury (1978): With the sin
gle exception of Obsession, a too
fancy, self-conscious hommage to
Hitchcock's Vertigo, Brian De

Palma hasn't made any bad mov
ies since he moved into the Holly
wood mainstream, but this fiend
ishly witty thriller is considered
his most disreputable. It was his
first film after Carrie, and he was
working with even more ridicu
lous material — John Ferris'
script, from his novel, deals with
a pair of telekinetic heroes (An
drew Stevens and Amy Irving) —
which he took even farther. The
Fury is a great example of trash
transformed: the garish night
mare sequences, unsurpassed in
extravagance and audacity, make
us respond in ways we couldn't
have anticipated — you find
yourself laughing and applaud
ing scenes that in the hands of an
other director would be merely
repellent. The spirit of the film is
Jacobean. Kirk Douglas, Carrie
Snodgress, John Cassavetes,
Charles Durning and Fiona Lew
is co-star; Richard Kline did the
breathtaking hallucinatory pho
tography.

History of the
World, Parti
History of the World, Part I
(1981): Uneven as it is, this
almost universally detested an
thology comedy from Mel
Brooks has more laughs in it than
any of his movies except for

Young Frankenstein and con
siderably more verve than, say,
Silent Movie or High Anxiety.
The large cast — Brooks, Dom
De Luise, Madeline Kahn,
Harvey Korman, Cloris
Leachman, Ron Carey, Gregory
Hines etc. — performs in a low
down burlesque style. Of the
three main segments — "The Ro
man Empire," "The Spanish In
quisition," and"The French
Revolution" — the second is def
initely the funniest, although
Brooks was severely criticized for
turning the Inquisition torture
chambers into a setting for musi
cal comedy. (Perhaps Brooks'
critics forgot that the "Spring
time for Hitler" number in The
Producers had made him famous
— or that self-deprecation has
always been an indispensable ele
ment in Jewish humor.)

Invasion of the Body
Snatchers
Invasion of the Body Snatchers
(1978): The first film version of
Jack Finney's novel, released in
1956 was a tawdry, scary little
picture about alien take-over that
fed both the popular fear of
Communist infiltration and the
fear of liberals that America, hav
ing allowed itself to succumb to
xenophobic hysteria, had be

come faceless. The film is now a
cult classic; therefore, when Phil
ip Kaufman remade it four years
ago, fans of the earlier movie at
tacked it automatically and with
such vehemence that they neg
lected to notice how wittily the
screenwriter. W.D, Richter, had
transformed the original into a
parody of contemporary West
Coast sensibilities. The Kauf
man-Richter version, set in San
Francisco, provides a quintet of
protagonists who represent the
liberal-radical stratum: two
young inspectors from the De
partment of Health (Donald
Sutherland and Brooke Adams),
a poet (Jeff Goldblum) and his
wife (Veronica Cartwright), who
run mud baths, and a hip thera
pist (Leonard Nimoy). The joke
in this movie is that among the
very cool and the very mellow,
body snatching could have oc
curred years ago and no one
would have known it. Kaufman's
Body Snatchers is the best acted
science-fiction thriller I've ever
seen, and a bravura piece of film
making — glittering, self-as
sured, with night sequences (shot
by Michael Chapman) remi
niscent of De Chirico's paintings.

King Kong
King Kong (1976): The in
dignation aroused by the release
of this picture (directed by John
Guillermin, from a Lorenzo
Semple script) might have made
more sense if the original King
Kong, made 43 years earlier,
hadn't been held up as some sort
of artistic exemplar. Surely no
one can seriously consider the
first King Kong a good movie, en
joyable as it is. I found the re
make more outrageous and more
imaginative, with funnier
dialogue and an infinitely more
skillful cast — Jeff Bridges, with
long dirty blond hair and a
mariner's beard, Charles Grodin
in a cagey, grandstanding per
formance, and that hip, sexy co
medienne Jessica Lange. This
version is full of hilariously over
prepared big entrances (Bridges
and Lange each have one, but
Kong's, of course, is the most
preposterous), and though it falls
apart in the New York se
quences, which are as witless and
impersonal as huge set pieces in a
disaster epic, the first two-thirds
of the picture contains some in
genious pop imagery. (The scenes
between Kong and Jessica Lange
are a weird blend of erotic com
edy and mythic romance.)

1941
1941 (1979): When a young
filmmaker releases two
phenomenally lucrative pictures
and then spends a fortune on a
third, he's bound to suffer the pe
culiar backlash reserved for the
very successful. This is what hap
