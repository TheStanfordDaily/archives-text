What an impression
Students print homemade Christmas cards by carving shapes into
cross-sections of potatoes, dipping them in ink and then pressing them
onto pieces of paper. This intaglio project was featured at the Synergy
table, one of many exhibits at the New Ways Holiday Fair which was
held yesterday in White Plaza.
