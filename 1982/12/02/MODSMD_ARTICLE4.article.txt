# University plans new toxic waste disposal

### SANDRA BODOVITZ Staff writer 
Aging toxic waste disposal facilities
throughout campus have prompted the
University to give top priority to build
ing a new, possibly multi-million dollar
center to handle all of the processes as
sociated with the waste disposal.
The new Environmental Center, cur
rently in the planning stages, would
streamline the storage, incineration and
management of the toxic waste materi
als produced at various campus loca
tions. The center would incorporate the
current hospital and animal care in
cineration facilities and the facilities
presently used to handle and dispose of
radioactive substances.
The high cost and pressing need of
the waste disposal site will put addi
tional pressures upon the University's
hard-pressed budget and is expected to
delay other needed construction.
The need to replace aging incinera
tion facilities has become critical, ac
cording to Alain Decleve, University
director of Health Safety. "The hospital
and the animal care facilities have in
cinerators that are very old. We need
new incinerators for the hospital pa
tient care and animal care areas," he
said.
The project is expected to be com
pleted within the next two years,
Decleve said.
Part of the new center will include
storage facilities for the packaging and
handling of toxic and radioactive mate
rials sent off-campus for disposal, ac
cording to Decleve. Other space in the
center will be allocated for the storage
of decaying radioactive materials.
The incineration facilities will replace
aging facilities at the hospital which are
used to dispose of biological, infectious
or pathological materials classified as
potentially hazardous.

Roland Finston, University director
of Health Physics, said he hopes the
new facilities will also include office
space for the Health Physics and Health
Safety staffs.
New incineration facilities were in
the plans for the hospital expansion.
However, Decleve and other hospital
officials believe it would be more effi
cient to have the hospital facilities in
cluded in a centralized waste disposal
area. "If we have a centralized facility
we can put more money into planning
and meeting environmental controls,"
Decleve said. "The preparations facil
ities should be the same for all waste
products tven though the final disposal
process is very different," Decleve
added.
The site of the facility and its size
have not been determined yet. "The size
of the facility will depend on the
amount of segregation between dif
ferent types of chemicals needed. This
requires a study by architects, engineers
and planners," Decleve said, due to the
special requirements of the facility.
"If we have the facility the way we
want it with segregation the risk would
be almost zero ... it would be infinitely
better in an earthquake than what we
have now," he added.
A group of five administrative of
ficials - including Vice Provost for
Management Ray Bacchetti, Associate
Vice President Kent Peterson and
Gerald Lieberman, vice provost and
dean of graduate studies and research
â€” have examined alternatives for the
facility that are now being reviewed by
Decleve and others. A faculty group,
which will also review the proposals,
has also been formed.
The projected cost of the facility is
between one and three million dollars,
but this estimate is a rough one that
does not include the cost of the in
cineration facilities, according to
Decleve.
The various groups considering the
new facility are focusing on safety, se
curity and environmental concerns.
Other important issues include meeting
current and upcoming EPA regulations
and trying to create a centralized facil
ity close to the sources of the wastes, ac
cording to Decleve.
Ideally this would involve placing the
site on campus, according to Mary
Krawec, associate director of the Stan
ford Hospital.
