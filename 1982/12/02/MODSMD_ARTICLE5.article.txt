# Burglary suspects
## O'Connors likely to appear for case trial 
### KRISTEN CHRISTOPHER Senior staff writer 
After the second full day of a preliminary hearing
for Maureen and Robert O'Connor, it seems both
members of the burglary suspect-couple will be
forced to appear at the official case trial to be held
within the next 100 days.
The O'Connors face eight burglary-related
charges stemming from their suspected involvement
in the theft of more than $2 million worth of proper
ty stolen from Peninsula homes, including several
on-campus residences.
According to Craig Collins, Maureen O'Connor's
attorney, the prosecution's case against Robert
O'Connor looks strong and attempts by Collins to
have the charges against Maureen O'Connor re
duced seem likely to fail.
The purpose of the San Jose Municipal Court
hearing is to determine whether the couple will be
"held to answer" in Santa Clara County Superior
Court. "Held to answer" is the legal term for a man
datory court appearance.
The couple was arrested on Nov. 11 and charged
with six counts of burglary, one count of auto theft

and one count of possession of stolen property.
Although there are 37 burglaries with which Rob
ert O'Connor may be connected, "the police and the
prosecution made the decision several weeks ago to
charge only six counts," Collins said. "If the case
falls through, which it seems like it won't, they may
make more charges."
"There's nothing stopping the D.A. from charg
ing these cases," he added, but there would be no
difference in any maximum sentence if more charges
were added.
Collins has been trying to get the six burglary
charges against his client, Maureen O'Connor,
dropped, but he said, "They're treating her like
they're treating him . . . I'm disappointed."
Yesterday the judge denied a request to release
her on her own recognizance and to reduce her bail,
according to Collins. However, he said those denials
will not be made permanent until the ruling on
whether she will be held to answer is made.
Maureen O'Connor is suing her husband for
divorce and is acting separately from him in the case;
he has his own lawyer.

During the court proceedings yesterday and Tues
day. t he prosecution called the victims of six charged
burglaries to testify and presented some of their sto
len property, which was retrieved from the vans and
a La Honda home owned by the O'Connors.
"Less than 10 pieces of evidence have been pre
sented." said Collins. One or two items from each
household, such as cameras and tennis rackets, have
been displayed, he added.
Capt. Raoul Niemeyer and other officers from the
Stanford Police Department have testified about
their role in the case, according to Stanford Police
Chief Marvin Herrington. Stanford police officers
participated in theinvestigation which led to the
O'Connors' arrest.
Referring to the fact that the preliminary hearing
has continued for two days, Herrington said, "It's a
little unusual, but because of the magnitude and the
kind of case, it doesn't surprise me."
However, Collins said. "They're going to wrap it
up tomorrow morning."
Arraignment will be held 15 days after the hearing
is completed and the Superior Court trial will follow
within 90 days.
