# ASSU anticipates funding for boathouse
## 
### DAVID SANCHEZ Staff Writer 
The ASSU is "very positive" about
the Lake Lagunita boathouse budget
negotiations with the Dean's Office of
Student Affairs (DOSA), according to
Council of Presidents (COP) member
Mark Epstein.
The ASSU has recently asked the
University to assume the full cost of the
lifeguarding program and to pay for
two thirds of the boathouse main
tenance budget. According to Epstein,
the University has "pretty much
agreed" to provide this level of funding,
although exact figures are not yet avail
able.
"The figures have pretty much been
agreed upon between the ASSU and the
Dean of Student Affairs," Epstein said.
Epstein said that the ASSU is willing
to fund a third of the costs of main
taining the boathouse building "be
cause it is a resource that we (the ASSU)
use for variouse purposes," such as
parties and. in the future, fund-raising
concessions. "Mostly it's just that we
feel we have a traditional responsibility
on the lake." he added.
The ASSU feels that the boathouse is
part of the University plant, and that it
should be paid for as any other part of
the plant, according to Epstein.
"We feel that the University should
be providing the basic costs of life
guarding and the basic costs of building

maintenance."
Epstein explained that safety on Lake
Lagunita takes two forms. First, safety
for those who recreate at the lake must
be provided and second, the safety of
those who live at the boathouse must be
also be assured.
Margaret Ann Fidler said that
DOSA feels obliged to provide safety
provisions at the lake: "The only ques
tion is at what level," she said, adding
that she has not yet been able to con
sider this question, and predicted that
the level oflifeguardingthat will be pro
vided this spring will be known by
"sometime in January."
The problem of determining an ap
propriate level ot lifeguarding is com
plicated by the fact that neither the Uni
versity nor the ASSU had provided for
boathouse funding in their budgets this
year.
The boathouse was not placed on the
fee assessment ballot last spring, as it
has been in the past. ASSU financial
manager Bob Brody said that this was
so because the ASSU did not feel that
students should bear the costs of l ake
Lagunita safety.
The University did not provide for
the boathouse in this year's budget be
cause estimates of the necessary level of
lifeguarding were not completed in time
for the University budget process, ac
cording to Fidler.
Fidler estimated that in order to pro

vide the necessary services at the lake,
the University and the ASSU will have
to come up with $15,000 to $18,000.
Epstein explained that this is not real
ly a money deficit, however. He said
that "it is a deficit of services, not of
money."
"We'll do whatever the University is
willing to pay for." Epstein said.
DOSA is holding a $15,000 fund
which is earmarked for "unusual"
ASSU problems such as the current
nudget woes, according to Fidler. But
Epstein noted that the ASSU is reluc
tant to tap this fund to provide for
boathouse costs.
"We quite honestly aren't too sure
why we have the responsibility for this
facility." said Epstein. "And so we're
reluctant to spend money which we feel
should be saved for crises in . .. our
governmental function, or in something
which we feel is in our responsibility."
He added. "Even something like (the
Recycling Center) falls a little bit more
under the rubric of a service that we in
itiated. that we would like to continue.
It isn't a University obligation per se,
whereas the boathouse is."
Fpstein explained that the "service
deficit" is only a "one-time problem."
However Epstein said that, in the
long run, the ASSU is very positive
about its negotiations with the Univer
sity "because this is the first time in 12

years that we (the ASSU) have had a
handle on the boathousc funding."
He noted that "the safety of the lake
is no longer contingent on an election.
"It's something which the University
has put into its own system of
priorities."
According to Epstein, the University
recently presented the ASSU with an
unexplained $2782 boathouse bill
which is currently being investigated by
the COP. Epstein said he suspected that
the bill is from work done in 1975, but
that unless the University could present
the ASSU with the origin of the debt,
the ASSU has "no intention of paying
it." If the University does explain the
bill, Epstein said that the ASSU would
huve to "figure some way of financing it
that would be equitable."
"We have about 53000 in the
boathouse account right now," ex
plained Epstein, "but we had planned
to spend that on some structural im
provements that are safety-related."
Epstein and head lifeguard John
Nurre made extensive improvements
on the boathouse structure this sum
mer. according to Epstein, He said
"We've got it now so that I think the
County would approve it as a safe struc
ture. But it's definitely one of those
things that is constantly on the
border, because it is constantly rot
ting."
