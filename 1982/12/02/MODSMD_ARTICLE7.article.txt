## Unemployment: lame-duck Congress looks for way out Democrats to push jobs program 
### 
Compiled from news reports and wire services
Congress started its "lame duck" special
session on Monday with unemployment rem
edies high on the list of priorities.
President Reagan called the special session
to deal with 10 spending bills that need to be
approved by Congress. But most considera
tion is expected to be paid to passing some
sort of bill to create jobs.
The administration has endorsed a plan by
Senate majority leader Howard Baker (R-
Tenn.) and House Speaker Thomas "Tip"
O'Neill (D-Mass.) for a program to repair the
nation's highways and create jobs, to be fi
nanced by a (our-cent-a-gallon gasoline tax.
But House Democrats are also considering
a companion bill they are calling "Baker-
O'Neill 2" which would be an expanded pub
lic works jobs bill, and O'Neill cautioned that
Reagan will "be in for a lot of changes down
the line."
The Democrats' $5 billion proposal would
include money for parks, public housing, hos
pitals and Amtrak. Democrats predict that
their proposal would create 250,000 to
300,000 jobs, in addition to the $5.5 billion
bipartison proposal endorsed by Reagan.
O'Neill claimed that the public was deman
ding emergency action on the problem of un
employment, which is now up to 10.4 percent.
"What's more important," O'Neill said, "the
deficit that's out there or people starving and
without a roof over their heads."
There is talk among the Democrats of at
taching the legislation to other bills that must
pass to keep the government operating. But

Senate Republicans say the bill has little
chance of passage. Baker said Reagan would
not hesitate to veto such a bill, because it
would increase the deficit. He said that it is
unlikely that the Senate would have time dur
ing the three-week session to take action on
anything but the highways measure.
House Democrats also plan to move ahead
with a housing reauthorization bill that
would include a mortgage subsidy for pros
pective homebuyers. The bill would cost
about $10 billion, but may not be passed be
cause of opposition from the home-building
industry.
The president backed down in recent days
from two proposals he was said to be con
sidering for submission to Congress.
Before departing on a five-day trip to Latin
America, Reagan announced that he would
not seek to speed up the tax cut scheduled for
July. Reagan said he would try instead to
keep Congressional opponents trom repeal
ing or scaling down the cuts.
On Saturday, Reagan laid to rest rumors
that he was considering an administration
study proposal to tax unemployment bene
fits. Those rumors had provoked a national
outcry, with Democratic leaders accusing the
administration of having a "callous" attitude
toward the jobless.
Other items slated for discussion during the
short session include a "domestic content"
bill that would require foreign-made cars sold
in America to contain a certain number of
American-made parts. The legislation is
being promoted by the United Auto Work

ers. Some legislators feel the bill is typical of
the kind of protectionism they say may be be- :
coming popular. Although it is not expected
to pass, some express the hope that it will send
a message to the Japanese to restrain their ex- ;
port efforts here.
Congress will also debate the ceiling on
Congressional salaries. The current ceiling of
560.662.50 is due to expire on December 17. I
A foreign aid bill is not expected to be con
sidered, because of resentment against in- ,
creasing foreign aid when domestic spending ;
is being cut, and because such a bill could get j
bogged down in a debate over the Israeli in- ■
vasion of Lebanon and Israel's role in the j
massacre of Lebanese in Beirut by Christian j
Phalangist soldiers.
Other bills Congress may consider during !
the special session involve nuclear waste dis- j
posai, housing, immigration, regulatory re- ;
form, bankruptcy laws, aid to the Caribbean !
and the powers of the Federal Trade Com- ;
mission.
Budget Director David Stockman, mean- j
while, predicted that this year's budget deficit j
would be somewhere between $180 billion
and $190 billion. Stockman's estimates as- '
sumed economic expansion of about three
percent next year. If an economic recovery
does not happen, the deficit could go even
higher. Stockman also predicted increasing
deficits over the next several years, with a pos
sible deficit of $250 billion in 1987 and
beyond. Reagan is expected to ask for Con
gressional spending cuts to try to bring the
deficits down.

sumed economic expansion of about three
percent next year. If an economic recovery
does not happen, the deficit could go even
higher. Stockman also predicted increasing
deficits over the next several years, with a pos
sible deficit of $250 billion in 1987 and
beyond. Reagan is expected to ask for Con
gressional spending cuts to try to bring the
deficits down.

Congress started its "lame duck" special
session on Monday with unemployment rem
edies high on the list of priorities.
President Reagan called the special session
to deal with 10 spending bills that need to be
approved by Congress. But most considera
tion is expected to be paid to passing some
sort of bill to create jobs.
The administration has endorsed a plan by
Senate majority leader Howard Baker (R-
Tenn.) and House Speaker Thomas "Tip"
O'Neill (D-Mass.) for a program to repair the
nation's highways and create jobs, to be fi
nanced by a (our-cent-a-gallon gasoline tax.
But House Democrats are also considering
a companion bill they are calling "Baker-
O'Neill 2" which would be an expanded pub
lic works jobs bill, and O'Neill cautioned that
Reagan will "be in for a lot of changes down
the line."
The Democrats' $5 billion proposal would
include money for parks, public housing, hos
pitals and Amtrak. Democrats predict that
their proposal would create 250,000 to
300,000 jobs, in addition to the $5.5 billion
bipartison proposal endorsed by Reagan.
O'Neill claimed that the public was deman
ding emergency action on the problem of un
employment, which is now up to 10.4 percent.
"What's more important," O'Neill said, "the
deficit that's out there or people starving and
without a roof over their heads."
There is talk among the Democrats of at
taching the legislation to other bills that must
pass to keep the government operating. But

Senate Republicans say the bill has little
chance of passage. Baker said Reagan would
not hesitate to veto such a bill, because it
would increase the deficit. He said that it is
unlikely that the Senate would have time dur
ing the three-week session to take action on
anything but the highways measure.
House Democrats also plan to move ahead
with a housing reauthorization bill that
would include a mortgage subsidy for pros
pective homebuyers. The bill would cost
about $10 billion, but may not be passed be
cause of opposition from the home-building
industry.
The president backed down in recent days
from two proposals he was said to be con
sidering for submission to Congress.
Before departing on a five-day trip to Latin
America, Reagan announced that he would
not seek to speed up the tax cut scheduled for
July. Reagan said he would try instead to
keep Congressional opponents trom repeal
ing or scaling down the cuts.
On Saturday, Reagan laid to rest rumors
that he was considering an administration
study proposal to tax unemployment bene
fits. Those rumors had provoked a national
outcry, with Democratic leaders accusing the
administration of having a "callous" attitude
toward the jobless.
Other items slated for discussion during the
short session include a "domestic content"
bill that would require foreign-made cars sold
in America to contain a certain number of
American-made parts. The legislation is
being promoted by the United Auto Work

ers. Some legislators feel the bill is typical of
the kind of protectionism they say may be be- :
coming popular. Although it is not expected
to pass, some express the hope that it will send
a message to the Japanese to restrain their ex- ;
port efforts here.
Congress will also debate the ceiling on
Congressional salaries. The current ceiling of
560.662.50 is due to expire on December 17. I
A foreign aid bill is not expected to be con
sidered, because of resentment against in- ,
creasing foreign aid when domestic spending ;
is being cut, and because such a bill could get j
bogged down in a debate over the Israeli in- ■
vasion of Lebanon and Israel's role in the j
massacre of Lebanese in Beirut by Christian j
Phalangist soldiers.
Other bills Congress may consider during !
the special session involve nuclear waste dis- j
posai, housing, immigration, regulatory re- ;
form, bankruptcy laws, aid to the Caribbean !
and the powers of the Federal Trade Com- ;
mission.
Budget Director David Stockman, mean- j
while, predicted that this year's budget deficit j
would be somewhere between $180 billion
and $190 billion. Stockman's estimates as- '
sumed economic expansion of about three
percent next year. If an economic recovery
does not happen, the deficit could go even
