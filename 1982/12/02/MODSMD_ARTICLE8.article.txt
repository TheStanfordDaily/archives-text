# Gas tax wins favor, could spur job growth

Capitol Hill experts are predicting smooth
passage for the 4-cent gasoline tax proposal
to finance repair of the nation's highways,
bridges and urban mass-transit systems and
which promises to create jobs for 320,000
Americans.
Bowing to congressional pressure for leg
islative measures aimed at easing unemploy
ment, President Reagan endorsed the ad
ministration proposal late last week. At a
news conference Sept. 28, Reagan had said it
would take a "paiace coup" to get him to
raise taxes, specifically gasoline taxes.
The switch is viewed as an administration
effort to become more practical and prag
matic in developing its economic recovery
program and dealing with Congress, where
the Democrats will control 26 additional
seats in the House next year.
The measure followed some political
backtreading as Reagan insisted the pro
posal is not really a tax but a "user's fee."
The president also maintained that the bill
/lis notajobs bill. We'd be doing this if there

were no recession at all," Reagan told re
porters last week.
However, Senate majority leader Howard
Baker (R-Tenn.) called the proposal a
"highway jobs program." Both Baker and
House Speaker Tip O'Neill (D-Mass.) flatly
called it a "gasoline tax."
Because the act enjoys widespread
bipartisan support, Reagan aides should
have little trouble assuring passage of the 4-
cent tax. The product of a 22-month cam
paign by Secretary of Transportation Drew
Lewis to persuade the president to levy a tax
that would raise funds for repairing the na
tion's deteriorating transportation system,
the gas tax is expected to generate jobs.
The plan before Congress proposes a 4-
cent levy on refiners to be passed through to
motorists at the pump that would increase
the total federal gas tax to 9-cents per gallon
and cost the average driver an additional 530
a year.
Of the $27.5 billion the tax is expected to
generate over the next five years, 20 percent
will be given out in discretionary block

grants to states and cities to update and re
pair urban mass-transit systems. The re
maining 80 percent is earmarked for high
ways and would be parceled out to gov
ernors based on state population and miles
of interstate highway. As it stands, the pro
gram calls on states to match 10 percent of
the Federal Government'smass-transit
grant and 20 percent of its highway con
tribution.
But Democratic leader O'Neill hopes to
expand job opportunities still further with a
broader job-creating package that would in
clude constructing more public housing and
plumping up public repair and maintenance
jobs. According to O'Neill the "first priority
in the current session is to create jobs."
The $5 billion price tag for O'Neill's jobs
bill would probably be financed by more
government borrowing and by larger defi
cits. Details are sketchy, but Democrats say
it would involve accelerated spending for the
maintenance and repairs of existing govern
ment facilities, not new construction.
While Republican leader Baker agreed,

saying "Jobs is the No. 1 issue in this coun
try," he noted time would be an inhibiting
factor for the lame-duck congress.
Another stumbling block for O'Neill's
jobs package is the likelihood of a presiden
tial veto. Given the president's de
termination to steer clear of conventional
remedies for unemployment, even O'Neill's
aides refer to the bills as "veto bait."
Neither Reagan's "user's fee" nor
O'Neill's big-spending plan is likely to do
much, however, to curb the current 10.4 per
cent jobless rate. Supporters of the job legis
lation have cautioned that at best the pro
posals are only a modest answer
to a more basic problem in the country's ail
ing economy.
But at a press briefing Monday, O'Neill said,
"The most important thing is to stimulate
the confidence of the American people, and
we can do that if we put 35,000 Americans to
work."
