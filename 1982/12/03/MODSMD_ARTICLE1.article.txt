Accidents will happen...
The Portland doctor piloting this Seneca II two-propeller plane found himself and his passengers in quite a wet
and muddy situation last night at the Palo Alto Airport. It seems that the cargo door of the plane came open on
take-off and the pilot was unable to abort it in time. The plane rolled over a levee and into the pond at the end of
the runway. No one was injured and the Federal Aviation Administration is investigating the incident, Palo
Alto police said.

.. .but two in the same night?
This Stanford University Medical Center truck just didn't seem to have luck on its side last night. The truck's
driver, who was shaken up in the incident but not injured, apparently turned a little too quickly on this loading
ramp at the Stanford Hospital. The main problem police at the scene faced was locating a tow truck large
enough to right the 35-foot, 11,300 lb. truck.
