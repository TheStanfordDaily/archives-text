## Arms proposals neglect central issues 
### 
The tragic shortcoming of most current arms control pro
posals — and let us hope that it does not become the final
tragedy of civilization — is that they do not really address
the central issues of the current nuclear crisis. The nuclear
freeze, the "zero option" for reductions of Soviet missiles in
Europe in return for non-deployment of U.S. missiles in Eu
rope and the recent American and Soviet proposals for force
reductions all share a critical fault: they do not directly or
comprehensively address the recent development of first
strike weapons and strategies that lies at the heart of the
present arms race. We are being led toward a nuclear dead
end. It is essential that the arms control process be redirected
and centered on this problem in such a way that prevention
of first use of strategic nuclear weapons becomes the or
ganizing principle of future arms control discussions.

In order to decrease the possibility of
accidental nuclear war, the United
States and the Soviet Union should
immediately begin working to update
and extend the 1963 "Hotline"
agreement and the 1971 U.S.-Soviet
agreement on accidental nuclear war
to ensure instant and continuous
communications between the
superpowers in crisis situations.

The first and easiest step in this process should be the ex
tension of present provisions dealing with the possibility of
accidental nuclear war. The most immediate danger from re
cent developments of quick, powerful and accurate first
strike weapons such as the Pershing 11, which would take
only five to seven minutes to reach Russia from the Europe
an sites where the United States plans to deploy it, is that
they will compel the adoption of launch-on-warning
strategies that would put both sides within a hair-trigger
alert of accidental nuclear war. The importance of this prob
lem can hardly be overstated — during one 18-month peri
od, the North American Air Defense Command (NORAD)
had I SI false alarms, one of which lasted a full six minutes,
or about the time it would take a Pershing II to strike its
target. Soviet command, control and communications com
puters are in all probability even less trustworthy. In order to
decrease the possibility of accidental nuclear war, the United
States and the Soviet Union should immediately begin work
ing to update and extend the 1963 "Hotline" agreement and
the 1971 U.S.-Soviet agreement on accidental nuclear war to
ensure instant and continuous communications between the
superpowers in crisis situations. Two further provisions that
should be given serious consideration are the establishment
of a jointly staffed crisis-control facility to monitor nuclear
weapons and the institution of continuous on-site inspection
of missile silos. This would allow both sides to be instan
taneously informed of any nuclear launched long before mis
siles started to appear on fallible radar screens.
The second necessary step toward meaningful and stabi
lizing arms control would be much more difficult and in
volve sacrifices on both sides. This step would be a commit
ment of both the United States and the Soviet Union to agree
both in word and in deed not to be the first to use strategic
nuclear weapons, or weapons designed to strike directly at
the territory of the adversary. Ideally, such an agreement
would demonstrate a real commitment by both sides to
structure their nuclear forces in accordance with a strategy
of Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD), which seeks to de
ter nuclear war by assuring that both sides have nuclear
weapons which could survive a first strike and then inflict
unacceptable damage on the first-striking aggressor. In oth
er words, both sides would renounce war-fighting strategies
which seek to make their adversary's forces vulnerable and
damage-limiting strategies which seek to make their own
countries invulnerable to second strikes. The Soviets have al
ready publicly renounced any intention of ever being the first
to use nuclear weapons, but it would be an entirely different
matter to get them to follow this up with actions such as end
ing research and development of first-strike weapons and
curbing their civil defense efforts (efforts which are probably
only psychologically effective anyway given the destructive
power of nuclear weapons). The United States would have
an even more difficult task in making a real commitment to a
no-first-strike treaty since it is the avowed strategy of the
United States that it would answer a Soviet conventional at
tack on Europe with a nuclear attack on the Soviet Union.

The best way to deal with this problem, as arms , Soviet and
defense experts Robert McNamara, George Kennan and
McGeorge Bundv argued in last spring's Foreign Affairs,
would be for the United States to upgrade its conventional
forces in Europe so it will not feel compelled to rely on its
nuclear forces. The United States could also retain the pre
rogative of using tactical nuclear weapons, or weapons de
signed for use on the battlefield, in case of a Soviet attack on
Europe. It could attempt to negotiate mutual reductions of
conventional forces in Europe with the Soviets. Whichever
option is chosen, the United States would obviously have to
pursue it in close consultation with its European allies. In
any case, a rethinking of U.S. deterrent strategy in Europe
and a restructuring of the balance of European conventional
forces, with Soviet cooperation or at least with Soviet under
standing, would be a significant move toward enabling the
United States to enter a no-first-strike agreement in good
faith.
There is unanimous agreement that a first-strike treaty
would not in itself do much to prevent a nuclear war — no
country would allow a treaty to stand in its way if it ever de
cided that its national interests required an action as drastic
as launching a nuclear strike. A real commitment to a no
first-strike treaty and the no-first-strike strategy of de
terrence that it entails, however, would dictate several ob
vious follow-up actions that would reduce the threat of nu
clear war in a very real and significant way. The first of these
follow-up steps would be an agreement to limit research and
development of the first-strike weapons and anti-satellite
and anti-submarine weapons that undermine deterrence by
threatening the survivability of both nations' nuclear forces.
The second component of this approach would be a nego
tiated reduction of existing and planned potential first-strike
weapons. Such weapons are highly accurate, powerful and
fast missiles with multiple warheads, capacities that make
them suitable for rapid first strikes on hardened military
targets like missile silos. Missiles such as the submarine
launched Trident C-4, by contrast, are ill-suited to first
strikes because they are not accurate enough to destroy re
liably hardened targets. Similarly, the cruise missile is not a
first-strike weapon becaue it requires several hours to reach
its target. One possible negotiating strategy that the United
States would pursue to reduce first-strike missiles would be
to offer not to deploy potential first-strike weapons such as
the Pershing 11, the MX and the Trident II (D-5) (a fast and
accurate submarine-launched missile) in return for Soviet
withdrawal of its first-strike weapons such as the multiple
warhead version of the SS-18.

This approach, or any similar process which focused on
establishing a stable deterrent structure of nuclear forces by
limiting and eventually eliminating first-strike weapons and
the temptations to use them in crisis situations, would cor
rectly address the crux of the present nuclear crisis. Once the
threat of a first strike is greatly reduced through this process,
the United States and the Soviet Union can turn to secon
dary issues such as the quantitative problem presented by the
unnecessarily high numbers of weapons of a second-strike
nature. Until the critical problem of placing qualitative limi
tations on first-strike missiles is adequately and com
prehensively resolved, however, discussions of number of
warheads, throw-weights and numbers of missiles which
purport to show an "advantage" in the nuclear balance in
one direction or another merely obscure the real issues in
volved and spur an alrady destabilizing arms race. Our only
hope is that the leaders of both the United States and the So
viet Union have the wisdom to realise that our mutual in
terest in peace requires that we reject such an arms race in
favor of mutual reductions aimed at preserving a deterrent
balance. Otherwise, the next generation may not be around
to lament our lack of foresight.
