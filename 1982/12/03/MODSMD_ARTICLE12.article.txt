## Mideast solution proves elusive 
### 
President Reagan's Mideast peace plan has been rejected
by the Israeli government and the Palestinian Liberation Or
ganization's Central Council.
The American plan represented the sole constructive pro
posal for a peaceful solution to the more than three-decade
old conflict since the 1978 Camp David Accords. Never
theless, it took the Begin cabinet only one day from the
plan's Sept. I release to reject it flatly. The PLO did not reach
a similar decision until Nov. 26.
The Reagan proposal was the result of extensive, though
confidential, consultations among administration officials,
government and private policy experts and congressional
leaders. It represents one of the rare examples in which the
United States chose to elevate itself to the position of a true
international leader devoid of any ideological (i.e. anti-com
munist) or economic motivations.
President Reagan, with Secretary of State George Shultz,
decided that the moment had come for the United States to
transcend its role as a mediator in the Mideast and become,
with all the risks involved, the main actor in the quest for
achieving a lasting peace.

Jewish fear stemming from
centuries of persecution which
culminated in the tragedy of the
Holocaust has been transformed into
an ardent commitment to the security
and prosperity of the state of Israel.

But then, why was the plan rejected? If anything, these re
jections suggest that the broad and far-sighted character
istics and goals of the plan were beyond the often narrow
pursuits of both Israelis and Palestinians.
The Reagan plan would have called for negotiations and
compromises by all parties involved in the dispute over the
occupied terrorists in the West Bank and Gaza and over the
establishment of a Palestinian homeland. The crucial points
of the plan are: first, that no nation should accept Israeli an
nexation of the West Bank and Gaza; second, that there be
an immediate halt to further Jewish settlement in these areas;
third, that negotiations on the future of the occupied territo
ries take place between Israel and Jordan; and fourth, that
the peace process must address the issue of Israel's recogni
tion as well as security.
The Israeli government rejected the plan saying that it
"could create a serious danger" to Israel's security and reaf
firmed that the settlements represent "a Jewish inalienable
right and an integral part of our national security." Nearly
two months later the official communique of the PLO based
its rejecton of the American plan on the fact that it fails to
recognize the PLO as the sole representative of the Palesti
nian people and that it does not "satisfy the inalienable natu
ral rights of our people."
Why should this plan suffer such immediate defeat? Is
there any hope of finding a long-range solution to the Mid
east dispute? To answer these questions we must analyze and
attempt to understand the underlying motives of the actors
involved, namely the Jewish and Palestinian-Arab people.
Ever since 1948, the year of the founding of the State of
Israel, most political and social relations between the Jews
and the Palestinians have been dominated by very strong
feelings of mutual fear and hatred. Jewish fear and insecurity
stemming from centuries of persecution which culminated in
the tragedy of the Holocaust has been transformed into an

ardent commitment to the security and prosperity of the
State of Israel.
On the other hand, Palestinian-Arab hatred is generated
bv the frustration of not having a national identity and by
being forced to live as second-class citizens in all parts of the
Mideast.
Jewish fear is further reflected in Israel's obsession to se
cure its borders and protect the country from any possible
Arab threat. This has taken the form of military expeditions
in neighboring countries, the destruction of the nuclear reac
tor in Iraq and the attempt to block the American sale of
AWACS planes to Saudi Arabia.
The Palestinian-Arab feeling of hatred has manifested
itself through such acts as terrorist attacks, efforts to expel
Israel from the United Nations and attempts to isolate
Egypt from the rest of the Arab worlds
At the root of this conflict are these two strong sentiments
— fear and hatred — that make the acceptance of a rational
peace proposal a more difficult task. In fact, it prevents Is
raelis and Palestinian-Arabs from even attempting to estab
lish the common ground necessary for the negotiating proc
ess.
In taking the peace process one step further than the ad
ministration, the first and single most important step man
dates that Israel and the PLO recognize one another. My ref
erence to the PLO as the representatives of the Palestinian
people is not based on political grounds but rather on similar
acceptances by all Arab nations, many European and
African countries, the United Nations and countless others.
There is no other group or organization which could right
fully claim the leadership of the Palestinian people.
The PLO must accept the existence of Israel as a sovereign
nation with the right to a safe existence. This explicitly im
plies refraining from all future acts of war of subversion i
directed at the inhabitants of Israel. Israel must stop dismiss- 1
ing the PLO as a terrorist organization and prepare to nego-|l
tiate with their leaders. It must accept the fact that its
borders will never be mathematically secure. Very few coun
tries outside of the Western world could make such a claim.
No peace will ever be possible unless the Palestinians and
Israelis are willing to establish a dialogue. All other actors,
from the United States to Saudi Arabia, Egypt or Jordan,
can only create conditions favorable for the peace process.
It is highly unlikely that such a dialogue will develop. Both
members and leaders of the Palestinian and Jewish com
munities around the world are prisoners of their fear and ha
tred. They do not have the courage to compromise emotion
and political power, to shed sad memories and past ex
periences in order to pursue the difficult task of achieving the
higher goal of peace.
It is crucial that younger generations of Jews and Arabs
accept the challenge to bring life to the peace process. This is
accomplished by stimulating debate and encouraging the ex
change of ideas. The Nov. 28 gathering in New York City of
a group of renowned Jewish and Palestinian writers is one
example. During the meeting, they read excerpts from their
works dealing with the long conflict and as a result de
veloped become more understanding of their respective posi
tions and feelings.
We have the opportunity to pursue similar efforts at Stan
ford. There are undoubtedly many people and groups in our
community that feel strongly about this issue. We must
make an effort to seek and understand the opposing position
and not limit ourselves to the acceptance of commonly trans
mitted beliefs. This is an opportunity we cannot afford to ig
nore.
