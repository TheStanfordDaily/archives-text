Rape isn't normal
Paul Helliker (Daily, Nov. 30) has
concluded that "rape must be normal"
if a psychological test can't predict
rapists and he has built a whole essay on
this premise. But psychological tests,
whether multiple choice or ink blot,
also fail to predict Nazi war criminals,
problem drinkers or people who like
blue, facts which might allow some con
clusions about ink blots, but none
about human nature. Helliker advances
from the meaningful argument that we
all share responsibility for rape preven
tion (like poverty and political op
pression), to proclaim that all individ
uals share the same likelihood of
bloody, violent behavior. To argue this
is to pursue a gross error and produce a
particularly unbelievable and
malevolent form of psychological de
terminism.
