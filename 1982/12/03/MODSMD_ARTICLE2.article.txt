Committee allocates $988 million for MX
Washington — In a narrow, hard-fought White House victory for the MX
missile, the House Appropriations Committee voted yesterday to include
$988 million for MX procurement in its 1983 defense spending bill.
The crucial vote was by the narrowest possible margin — a 26-26 tie that
defeated the effort by Rep. Joseph Addabbo (D-N. Y.) to delete procurement
funds for the controversial weapon.
Addabbo also lost, by voice vote, an effort to cut out $ 1.45 billion for MX
research and development and, by a 34-18 vote, an attempt to delete $4
billion for the B-1B bomber. His amendment to slash $3.5 billion for nuclear
aircraft carrier also went down to defeat, 29-17.
President Reagan, who had lobbied personally for the MX funds, hailed
the vote yesterday as "a vote for a stronger, more secure America."
But, speaking to reporters in Sao Paulo, Brazil, during his Latin America
tour, he acknowledged that the MX battle is not over in Congress.
"We're not jumping up and down and claiming the victory, because we
know it's going to be a very tough battle on the floor," Reagan said of the
expected full House and Senate votes next week.
"I think the floor vote will be just as tough as this," agreed Rep. Jack Ed
wards (R-Ala.) the House Appropriations Committee member who led the
administration's pro-MX effort. "We're not out of the woods yet."
The committee also approved the entire $231.6 billion 1983 defense spend
ing bill by voice vote yesterday, despite Addabbo's complaint that the meas
ure would fund more, in inflation-adjusted dollars, than was spent at the
peak of the Vietnam War.
"I support a strong national defense like everyone else in this room, but I
don't think we have to fund every expensive toy the admirals, generals and
contractors think we should have," Addabbo said.
First mechanical heart works
Salt Lake City — Barney Clark, the recipient of the lirst permanent me
chanical heart, regained consciousness yesterday, nodded his head, recog
nized his wife and indicated to doctors that he wasn't in pain.
"I think it's a success," said a tired but smiling Dr. William DeVries in a
briefing after the seven-hour emergency transplant operation ended at dawn
yesterday.
Describing the implantation of the plastic, cloth and metal heart as
"almost a spiritual experience," DeVries said, "it isn't over yet, it's just a
beginning." Clark, a retired dentist who was too old to be a candidate for a
scarce human heart, was in critical condition yesterday in the University of
Utah Medical Center intensive care unit. But his vital signs were stable after
being so near death Wednesday night that his operation was con
ducted nine hours earlier than planned.
Clark will spend the rest of his life connected by 6-foot hoses to
375 pounds of equipment mounted on a wheeled cart and
plugged into an electrical outlet with a backup power source.
The 61-year-old patient was selected for the mechanical heart
because his condition was otherwise inoperable, and he had a
"stable home situation" with a "reliable spouse" as well as
"stable psychological mechanisms," the hospital said. He was
suffering from cardiomyopathy, a deterioration of the heart that
kills about 10,000 Americans a year.
The operation by the 38-year-old surgeon, the only physician
authorized to conduct the procedure by the Food and Drug Ad
ministration, was the culmination of 25 years of research into an
artificial heart.
Reagan invites Brazilian astronauts
Sao Paulo, Brazil — President Reagan preached the virtues of
free enterprise, unrestricted world trade and individual liberty to
Brazilian industrialists yesterday and declared that the United
States and Brazil should jointly explore the frontiers of space.
"Today, I would like to propose ... to have a Brazilian
astronaut train with ours so that Brazil and the United States can
one day participate in a shuttle launch together as partners in
space," Reagan said to a group of U.S. and Brazilian busi
nessmen assembled in the governor's palace here.
Reagan's celebration of U.S.-Brazilian cooperation won en
thusiastic applause from his audience. Afterward, Joseph
Sanchez, president of General Motors Brazil, said that Reagan
had accomplished more in one or two days to improve relations
between the two countries than had been accomplished in 20
years.
But not all Brazilians were as ecstatic about Reagan's goodwill
efforts. The influential Journal do Brasil yesterday quoted a Bra
zilian official as saying that Reagan's speech in Brasilia Wednes
day had "a touch of Banana Republic to it" despite the U.S. pres
ident's evident sincerity.
While stressing that Reagan had initiated a welcome new
climate in U.S.-Brazilian relations, Brazilian officials in the capi
tal yesterday told Washington Post correspondent Jackson
Diehl that the closer ties sought by the United States remained
more a matter of potential than reality.
Although praising Reagan's personal style, they said that U.S.
handling of its new initiatives with Brazil had at times appeared
heavy handed, and that U.S. expectations of a "special rela
tionship" with Brazil in the future were overdrawn and un
realistic.
"If anyone is thinking in terms of a special relationship," said
a senior Brazilian Foreign Ministry official, using the phrase for
close U.S.-Brazil ties developed by Henry Kissinger during the
Ford administration, "forget it, it's not going to happen."
Watt blocked from granting drilling rights
Washington — The House Appropriations Committee ap
proved legislation yesterday prohibiting Interior Secretary
James Watt from granting oil drilling rights off most of the Cali
fornia coast and in federal wilderness areas.
The committee on voice vote approved a $7.38 billion ap
propriations bill for the department that include the prohibi
tions.
The bill now goes to the House floor, where a vote is tentative
ly scheduled today.
The California provision stops Watt from approving oil and
gas leases on the outer continental shelf off the northern two
thirds of the coastline, roughly from Pismo Beach to the Oregon
border.
It does not include recent finds by Phillips Petroleum and
Chevron in the Santa Maria Basin.
Watt had planned to sell drilling rights to the area next Sep
tember. But the committee, in its report on the bill, said that drill
ing along the coast offers little potential for major discoveries
and great risk to the environment.
The wilderness provision continues a current ban on leases in
designated wilderness areas and on national forest land being
studied for wilderness protection.
The current ban expires on Dec. 17, while the new one would
extend through next September if enacted.
Brown nominates Grodin
Sacramento — Appeals Court Justice Joseph Grodin, a former
labor mediator with a liberal reputation, was nominated yester
day by Gov. Brown as his seventh and final scheduled appointee
to the state Supreme Court.
Grodin, 52, was an original Brown appointee to the state farm
labor board in 1975. He would succeed Justice Frank Newman,
who is retiring Dec. 12.
"I'm excited, pleased and quite humbled," said Grodin, a la

bor lawyer and protege of the late Supreme Court Justice
Mathew Tobriner.
Asked about his views, Grodin said, "I believe my commit
ment reflects a strong view of free speech and civil liberties and
that mv views are moderate as to criminal proceedings. But I
don't think much of labels."
He also said the state Supreme Court, a frequent target of
criticism from political conservatives, "is the pinnacle of the ju
diciary, except for the U.S. Supreme Court."
Brown nominated his former legal affairs secretary, J. An
thony Kline, to succeed Grodin as presiding justice of Division 2
of the Ist District Court of Appeal in San Francisco. Kline was
appointed to the Superior Court by Brown in 1980 and had been
considered a candidate for the Supreme Court.
The Democratic governor, moving quickly to fill 18 newly
created appeals court positions, made three more appointments
in San hrancisco, all of them Superior Court judges who are
being nominated to the higher court.
Economic woes may halt arms race
Washington — Vice President George Bush said yesterday that
both the United States and the Soviet Union face "enormous"
economic problems that could affect military spending and has
ten an agreement to limit the nuclear arms race.
But Bush also told reporters over lunch at the vice president's
mansion that the United States still can better afford to build up
its defenses. And he expressed concern that congressional at
tempts to scale down President Reagan's ambitious rearmament
program would "send a signal" to the Soviets "fhat we're not
going to be able to follow through."
Bush, who talked with new Soviet leader Yuri Andropov in
Moscow last month after attending the funeral of Leonid
Brezhnev, was questioned about whether the change in leader
ship in Moscow can be expected to change Soviet-American rela
tions.
"An ingredient that's different looked at over the immediate
future is there are some economic problems that haven't always
been present on either side," Bush said. "One of the things that's
different is the enormous economic overload, not just on the So
viet Union alone, or on the United States alone, but on the bloc
countries. . .."
There is a "new economic dynamic" that could restrain the So
viet military expansion, Bush said. He expressed doubts that the
Soviet Union is prepared to devote to defense an unlimited share
of its resources, regardless of the costs to its domestic economy.
"I'm not sure that shouldn't be challenged," Bush said. "I'm
saying there is a new economic dynamic and I hope that will be
among other things that push to a reduction, verifiable and
equitable, in nuclear weapons. That's the point I'm making."
Agencies protest budget cuts
Washington — Two Reagan administration agency heads who
are known for their loyalty to the president are nevertheless
sharply challenging budget cuts and program rearrangements
ordered bv the Office of Management and Budget at the presi
dent's behest.
They are Health and Human Services Secretary Richard
Schweiker and Environmental Protection Agency Adminis
trator Anne Gorsuch.
Their appeals are symptomatic of problems President Reagan
is likely to face in his Cabinet as well as on Capitol Hill as he
presses for cuts in domestic spending on top of the large ones al
ready made in the past two years.
Reagan, seeking to protect both his proposed military buildup
and the third year of his tax cut, has said he will rely on cuts in
domestic programs to hold down the looming federal deficit.
OMB Director David Stockman, in a first round of decisions
on the fiscal 1984 budget that will go to Congress early next year,
has ordered program cuts consistent with a $25 billion to $30
billion eventual decrease in domestic spending. Agency heads
can appeal these decisions, to Stockman, then to Reagan.
Schweiker, in a confidential letter of protest to Stockman
dated Nov. 29, objected to "drastic" reductions in personnel for
the Social Security Administration, which would lose 5000 peo
ple and be limited to 79,500, and the Health Care Financing Ad
ministration, which would be allowed only 3800 people instead
of Schweiker's proposed 4483.
Gorsuch reportedly plans to appeal almost all elements of the
OMB's II percent cut in the agency's $974 million operating
budget request, in large part because she feels reallocations of
money and personnel within the agency trespass on her pre
rogatives as administrator.
Packard ousted from chairmanship
Washington — Sen. Bob Packwood (R-Ore.) who had charged
that President Reagan was driving blacks, Latinos, women and
Jews away from the Republican Party, was ousted yesterday as
chairman of the Senate Republican Campaign Committee.
Pack wood's GOP colleagues, meeting in a closed session,
voted 29-25 to replace him with Sen. Richard Lugar (R-Ind.) Sig

nificantlv, Lugar's chief backer for the key leadership post was
Reagan's closest friend in the Senate, Sen. Paul Laxalt (R-Nev.)
Reagan had made no secret of his antipathy for the outspoken
Packwood but there was no visible evidence that the president
played a direct role in the move to dump him. Nevertheless, Sen.
Warren Rudman (R-N.H.) a Packwood supporter, protested
that "there has been some White House meddling," apparently
by Reagan aides working behind the scenes for Lugar.
Several senators said privately they voted for Lugar because of
the need to ease severe strains between the White House and the
campaign committee, which has the critical task in 1984 of help
ing the GOP retain control of the Senate. Nineteen Republican
senators are up for re-election then.
Soviets restock Syrian arms
Damascus, Syria — The Soviet Union, according to the best
intelligence estimates here, has already replaced Syria's losses in
jet fighters and modern battle tanks from the summer fighting
with Israel and may have upgraded this country's anti-aircraft
missile systems.
But intelligence estimates in a closed society such as President
Hafez Assad's Syria are based largely on sketchy, often im
pressionistic, information and as a result, the conclusions are
considered tentative at best.
At a time when Syrian businessmen are bitterly complaining
that the rigidity of government import controls has dried up the
flow of commerce from abroad, the figures for the third quarter
indicated that the two Mediterranean ports were as busy as they
were a year ago when trade was not being pinched.
Instead of handling normal commodity imports, it turned out,
the two Syrian ports have been kept busy with the flow of new
arms from the Soviet Union to replace the heavy losses from
their clash with Israel in Lebanon last summer.
The figures give only tonnages, not types of goods. But for
eigners traveling around the country in recent months have had
little difficulty establishing that the Soviet Union has made up
Syria's summer losses — and then some.
In recent months, travelers have spotted columns of new Sovi
et T-62 and T-72 tanks on transporters moving on the highway
south of Horns, apparently on their way to supply depots north
of Damascus from where they are to be distributed to the re
constituted army units as replacements for the 300 or so tanks
and armored personnel carriers that were lost when Israel
punched north through Lebanon last June.
Wall Street teeters
New York — Stock prices finished mixed for the second
straight day yesterday in what one analyst characterized as a tug
of war on Wall Street.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 8.19 points in
volatile trading Wednesday, rose 2.02 to close at 1033.11. At one
point during the session, the blue-chip average was up more than
10 points.
Today's weather
More variable clouds and light winds expected today. After
noon highs in the 60s and overnight lows in the 40s.

Clark will spend the rest of his life connected by 6-foot hoses to

The 61-year-old patient was selected for the mechanical heart
because his condition was otherwise inoperable, and he had a

"stable psychological mechanisms," the hospital said. He was
suffering from cardiomyopathy, a deterioration of the heart that
kills about 10,000 Americans a year.
The operation by the 38-year-old surgeon, the only physician
authorized to conduct the procedure by the Food and Drug Ad

Reagan invites Brazilian astronauts
Sao Paulo, Brazil — President Reagan preached the virtues of
free enterprise, unrestricted world trade and individual liberty to
Brazilian industrialists yesterday and declared that the United
States and Brazil should jointly explore the frontiers of space.
"Today, I would like to propose ... to have a Brazilian
astronaut train with ours so that Brazil and the United States can
one day participate in a shuttle launch together as partners in
space," Reagan said to a group of U.S. and Brazilian busi
nessmen assembled in the governor's palace here.
Reagan's celebration of U.S.-Brazilian cooperation won en
thusiastic applause from his audience. Afterward, Joseph
Sanchez, president of General Motors Brazil, said that Reagan
had accomplished more in one or two days to improve relations
between the two countries than had been accomplished in 20
years.
But not all Brazilians were as ecstatic about Reagan's goodwill
efforts. The influential Journal do Brasil yesterday quoted a Bra
zilian official as saying that Reagan's speech in Brasilia Wednes
day had "a touch of Banana Republic to it" despite the U.S. pres
ident's evident sincerity.
While stressing that Reagan had initiated a welcome new
climate in U.S.-Brazilian relations, Brazilian officials in the capi
tal yesterday told Washington Post correspondent Jackson
Diehl that the closer ties sought by the United States remained
more a matter of potential than reality.
Although praising Reagan's personal style, they said that U.S.
handling of its new initiatives with Brazil had at times appeared
heavy handed, and that U.S. expectations of a "special rela
tionship" with Brazil in the future were overdrawn and un
realistic.
"If anyone is thinking in terms of a special relationship," said
a senior Brazilian Foreign Ministry official, using the phrase for
close U.S.-Brazil ties developed by Henry Kissinger during the
Ford administration, "forget it, it's not going to happen."
Watt blocked from granting drilling rights
Washington — The House Appropriations Committee ap
proved legislation yesterday prohibiting Interior Secretary
James Watt from granting oil drilling rights off most of the Cali
fornia coast and in federal wilderness areas.
The committee on voice vote approved a $7.38 billion ap
propriations bill for the department that include the prohibi
tions.
The bill now goes to the House floor, where a vote is tentative
ly scheduled today.
The California provision stops Watt from approving oil and
gas leases on the outer continental shelf off the northern two
thirds of the coastline, roughly from Pismo Beach to the Oregon
border.
It does not include recent finds by Phillips Petroleum and
Chevron in the Santa Maria Basin.
Watt had planned to sell drilling rights to the area next Sep
tember. But the committee, in its report on the bill, said that drill
ing along the coast offers little potential for major discoveries
and great risk to the environment.
The wilderness provision continues a current ban on leases in
designated wilderness areas and on national forest land being
studied for wilderness protection.
The current ban expires on Dec. 17, while the new one would
extend through next September if enacted.
Brown nominates Grodin
Sacramento — Appeals Court Justice Joseph Grodin, a former
labor mediator with a liberal reputation, was nominated yester
day by Gov. Brown as his seventh and final scheduled appointee
to the state Supreme Court.
Grodin, 52, was an original Brown appointee to the state farm
labor board in 1975. He would succeed Justice Frank Newman,
who is retiring Dec. 12.
"I'm excited, pleased and quite humbled," said Grodin, a la

bor lawyer and protege of the late Supreme Court Justice
Mathew Tobriner.
Asked about his views, Grodin said, "I believe my commit
ment reflects a strong view of free speech and civil liberties and
that mv views are moderate as to criminal proceedings. But I
don't think much of labels."
He also said the state Supreme Court, a frequent target of
criticism from political conservatives, "is the pinnacle of the ju
diciary, except for the U.S. Supreme Court."
Brown nominated his former legal affairs secretary, J. An
thony Kline, to succeed Grodin as presiding justice of Division 2
of the Ist District Court of Appeal in San Francisco. Kline was
appointed to the Superior Court by Brown in 1980 and had been
considered a candidate for the Supreme Court.
The Democratic governor, moving quickly to fill 18 newly
created appeals court positions, made three more appointments
in San hrancisco, all of them Superior Court judges who are
being nominated to the higher court.
Economic woes may halt arms race
Washington — Vice President George Bush said yesterday that
both the United States and the Soviet Union face "enormous"
economic problems that could affect military spending and has
ten an agreement to limit the nuclear arms race.
But Bush also told reporters over lunch at the vice president's
mansion that the United States still can better afford to build up
its defenses. And he expressed concern that congressional at
tempts to scale down President Reagan's ambitious rearmament
program would "send a signal" to the Soviets "fhat we're not
going to be able to follow through."
Bush, who talked with new Soviet leader Yuri Andropov in
Moscow last month after attending the funeral of Leonid
Brezhnev, was questioned about whether the change in leader
ship in Moscow can be expected to change Soviet-American rela
tions.
"An ingredient that's different looked at over the immediate
future is there are some economic problems that haven't always
been present on either side," Bush said. "One of the things that's
different is the enormous economic overload, not just on the So
viet Union alone, or on the United States alone, but on the bloc
countries. . .."
There is a "new economic dynamic" that could restrain the So
viet military expansion, Bush said. He expressed doubts that the
Soviet Union is prepared to devote to defense an unlimited share
of its resources, regardless of the costs to its domestic economy.
"I'm not sure that shouldn't be challenged," Bush said. "I'm
saying there is a new economic dynamic and I hope that will be
among other things that push to a reduction, verifiable and
equitable, in nuclear weapons. That's the point I'm making."
Agencies protest budget cuts
Washington — Two Reagan administration agency heads who
are known for their loyalty to the president are nevertheless
sharply challenging budget cuts and program rearrangements
ordered bv the Office of Management and Budget at the presi
dent's behest.
They are Health and Human Services Secretary Richard
Schweiker and Environmental Protection Agency Adminis
trator Anne Gorsuch.
Their appeals are symptomatic of problems President Reagan
is likely to face in his Cabinet as well as on Capitol Hill as he
presses for cuts in domestic spending on top of the large ones al
ready made in the past two years.
Reagan, seeking to protect both his proposed military buildup
and the third year of his tax cut, has said he will rely on cuts in
domestic programs to hold down the looming federal deficit.
OMB Director David Stockman, in a first round of decisions
on the fiscal 1984 budget that will go to Congress early next year,
has ordered program cuts consistent with a $25 billion to $30
billion eventual decrease in domestic spending. Agency heads
can appeal these decisions, to Stockman, then to Reagan.
Schweiker, in a confidential letter of protest to Stockman
dated Nov. 29, objected to "drastic" reductions in personnel for
the Social Security Administration, which would lose 5000 peo
ple and be limited to 79,500, and the Health Care Financing Ad
ministration, which would be allowed only 3800 people instead
of Schweiker's proposed 4483.
Gorsuch reportedly plans to appeal almost all elements of the
OMB's II percent cut in the agency's $974 million operating
budget request, in large part because she feels reallocations of
money and personnel within the agency trespass on her pre
rogatives as administrator.
Packard ousted from chairmanship
Washington — Sen. Bob Packwood (R-Ore.) who had charged
that President Reagan was driving blacks, Latinos, women and
Jews away from the Republican Party, was ousted yesterday as
chairman of the Senate Republican Campaign Committee.
Pack wood's GOP colleagues, meeting in a closed session,
voted 29-25 to replace him with Sen. Richard Lugar (R-Ind.) Sig

nificantlv, Lugar's chief backer for the key leadership post was
Reagan's closest friend in the Senate, Sen. Paul Laxalt (R-Nev.)
Reagan had made no secret of his antipathy for the outspoken
Packwood but there was no visible evidence that the president
played a direct role in the move to dump him. Nevertheless, Sen.
Warren Rudman (R-N.H.) a Packwood supporter, protested
that "there has been some White House meddling," apparently
by Reagan aides working behind the scenes for Lugar.
Several senators said privately they voted for Lugar because of
the need to ease severe strains between the White House and the
campaign committee, which has the critical task in 1984 of help
ing the GOP retain control of the Senate. Nineteen Republican
senators are up for re-election then.
Soviets restock Syrian arms
Damascus, Syria — The Soviet Union, according to the best
intelligence estimates here, has already replaced Syria's losses in
jet fighters and modern battle tanks from the summer fighting
with Israel and may have upgraded this country's anti-aircraft
missile systems.
But intelligence estimates in a closed society such as President
Hafez Assad's Syria are based largely on sketchy, often im
pressionistic, information and as a result, the conclusions are
considered tentative at best.
At a time when Syrian businessmen are bitterly complaining
that the rigidity of government import controls has dried up the
flow of commerce from abroad, the figures for the third quarter
indicated that the two Mediterranean ports were as busy as they
were a year ago when trade was not being pinched.
Instead of handling normal commodity imports, it turned out,
the two Syrian ports have been kept busy with the flow of new
arms from the Soviet Union to replace the heavy losses from
their clash with Israel in Lebanon last summer.
The figures give only tonnages, not types of goods. But for
eigners traveling around the country in recent months have had
little difficulty establishing that the Soviet Union has made up
Syria's summer losses — and then some.
In recent months, travelers have spotted columns of new Sovi
et T-62 and T-72 tanks on transporters moving on the highway
south of Horns, apparently on their way to supply depots north
of Damascus from where they are to be distributed to the re
constituted army units as replacements for the 300 or so tanks
and armored personnel carriers that were lost when Israel
punched north through Lebanon last June.
Wall Street teeters
New York — Stock prices finished mixed for the second
straight day yesterday in what one analyst characterized as a tug
of war on Wall Street.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 8.19 points in
volatile trading Wednesday, rose 2.02 to close at 1033.11. At one
point during the session, the blue-chip average was up more than
10 points.

Committee allocates $988 million for MX
Washington — In a narrow, hard-fought White House victory for the MX
missile, the House Appropriations Committee voted yesterday to include
$988 million for MX procurement in its 1983 defense spending bill.
The crucial vote was by the narrowest possible margin — a 26-26 tie that
defeated the effort by Rep. Joseph Addabbo (D-N. Y.) to delete procurement
funds for the controversial weapon.
Addabbo also lost, by voice vote, an effort to cut out $ 1.45 billion for MX
research and development and, by a 34-18 vote, an attempt to delete $4
billion for the B-1B bomber. His amendment to slash $3.5 billion for nuclear
aircraft carrier also went down to defeat, 29-17.
President Reagan, who had lobbied personally for the MX funds, hailed
the vote yesterday as "a vote for a stronger, more secure America."
But, speaking to reporters in Sao Paulo, Brazil, during his Latin America
tour, he acknowledged that the MX battle is not over in Congress.
"We're not jumping up and down and claiming the victory, because we
know it's going to be a very tough battle on the floor," Reagan said of the
expected full House and Senate votes next week.
"I think the floor vote will be just as tough as this," agreed Rep. Jack Ed
wards (R-Ala.) the House Appropriations Committee member who led the
administration's pro-MX effort. "We're not out of the woods yet."
The committee also approved the entire $231.6 billion 1983 defense spend
ing bill by voice vote yesterday, despite Addabbo's complaint that the meas
ure would fund more, in inflation-adjusted dollars, than was spent at the
peak of the Vietnam War.
"I support a strong national defense like everyone else in this room, but I
don't think we have to fund every expensive toy the admirals, generals and
contractors think we should have," Addabbo said.
First mechanical heart works
Salt Lake City — Barney Clark, the recipient of the lirst permanent me
chanical heart, regained consciousness yesterday, nodded his head, recog
nized his wife and indicated to doctors that he wasn't in pain.
"I think it's a success," said a tired but smiling Dr. William DeVries in a
briefing after the seven-hour emergency transplant operation ended at dawn
yesterday.
Describing the implantation of the plastic, cloth and metal heart as
"almost a spiritual experience," DeVries said, "it isn't over yet, it's just a
beginning." Clark, a retired dentist who was too old to be a candidate for a
scarce human heart, was in critical condition yesterday in the University of
Utah Medical Center intensive care unit. But his vital signs were stable after
being so near death Wednesday night that his operation was con
ducted nine hours earlier than planned.
Clark will spend the rest of his life connected by 6-foot hoses to
375 pounds of equipment mounted on a wheeled cart and
plugged into an electrical outlet with a backup power source.
The 61-year-old patient was selected for the mechanical heart
because his condition was otherwise inoperable, and he had a
"stable home situation" with a "reliable spouse" as well as
"stable psychological mechanisms," the hospital said. He was
suffering from cardiomyopathy, a deterioration of the heart that
kills about 10,000 Americans a year.
The operation by the 38-year-old surgeon, the only physician
authorized to conduct the procedure by the Food and Drug Ad

Brown nominates Grodin
Sacramento — Appeals Court Justice Joseph Grodin, a former
labor mediator with a liberal reputation, was nominated yester
day by Gov. Brown as his seventh and final scheduled appointee
to the state Supreme Court.
Grodin, 52, was an original Brown appointee to the state farm
labor board in 1975. He would succeed Justice Frank Newman,
who is retiring Dec. 12.
"I'm excited, pleased and quite humbled," said Grodin, a la

bor lawyer and protege of the late Supreme Court Justice
Mathew Tobriner.
Asked about his views, Grodin said, "I believe my commit
ment reflects a strong view of free speech and civil liberties and
that mv views are moderate as to criminal proceedings. But I
don't think much of labels."
He also said the state Supreme Court, a frequent target of
criticism from political conservatives, "is the pinnacle of the ju
diciary, except for the U.S. Supreme Court."
Brown nominated his former legal affairs secretary, J. An
thony Kline, to succeed Grodin as presiding justice of Division 2
of the Ist District Court of Appeal in San Francisco. Kline was
appointed to the Superior Court by Brown in 1980 and had been
considered a candidate for the Supreme Court.
The Democratic governor, moving quickly to fill 18 newly
created appeals court positions, made three more appointments
in San hrancisco, all of them Superior Court judges who are
being nominated to the higher court.
Economic woes may halt arms race
Washington — Vice President George Bush said yesterday that
both the United States and the Soviet Union face "enormous"
economic problems that could affect military spending and has
ten an agreement to limit the nuclear arms race.
But Bush also told reporters over lunch at the vice president's
mansion that the United States still can better afford to build up
its defenses. And he expressed concern that congressional at
tempts to scale down President Reagan's ambitious rearmament
program would "send a signal" to the Soviets "fhat we're not
going to be able to follow through."
Bush, who talked with new Soviet leader Yuri Andropov in
Moscow last month after attending the funeral of Leonid
Brezhnev, was questioned about whether the change in leader
ship in Moscow can be expected to change Soviet-American rela
tions.
"An ingredient that's different looked at over the immediate
future is there are some economic problems that haven't always
been present on either side," Bush said. "One of the things that's
different is the enormous economic overload, not just on the So
viet Union alone, or on the United States alone, but on the bloc
countries. . .."
There is a "new economic dynamic" that could restrain the So
viet military expansion, Bush said. He expressed doubts that the
Soviet Union is prepared to devote to defense an unlimited share
of its resources, regardless of the costs to its domestic economy.
"I'm not sure that shouldn't be challenged," Bush said. "I'm
saying there is a new economic dynamic and I hope that will be
among other things that push to a reduction, verifiable and
equitable, in nuclear weapons. That's the point I'm making."
Agencies protest budget cuts
Washington — Two Reagan administration agency heads who
are known for their loyalty to the president are nevertheless
sharply challenging budget cuts and program rearrangements
ordered bv the Office of Management and Budget at the presi
dent's behest.
They are Health and Human Services Secretary Richard
Schweiker and Environmental Protection Agency Adminis
trator Anne Gorsuch.
Their appeals are symptomatic of problems President Reagan
is likely to face in his Cabinet as well as on Capitol Hill as he
presses for cuts in domestic spending on top of the large ones al
ready made in the past two years.
Reagan, seeking to protect both his proposed military buildup
and the third year of his tax cut, has said he will rely on cuts in
domestic programs to hold down the looming federal deficit.
OMB Director David Stockman, in a first round of decisions
on the fiscal 1984 budget that will go to Congress early next year,
has ordered program cuts consistent with a $25 billion to $30
billion eventual decrease in domestic spending. Agency heads
can appeal these decisions, to Stockman, then to Reagan.
Schweiker, in a confidential letter of protest to Stockman
dated Nov. 29, objected to "drastic" reductions in personnel for
the Social Security Administration, which would lose 5000 peo
ple and be limited to 79,500, and the Health Care Financing Ad
ministration, which would be allowed only 3800 people instead
of Schweiker's proposed 4483.
Gorsuch reportedly plans to appeal almost all elements of the
OMB's II percent cut in the agency's $974 million operating
budget request, in large part because she feels reallocations of
money and personnel within the agency trespass on her pre
rogatives as administrator.
Packard ousted from chairmanship
Washington — Sen. Bob Packwood (R-Ore.) who had charged
that President Reagan was driving blacks, Latinos, women and
Jews away from the Republican Party, was ousted yesterday as
chairman of the Senate Republican Campaign Committee.
Pack wood's GOP colleagues, meeting in a closed session,
voted 29-25 to replace him with Sen. Richard Lugar (R-Ind.) Sig

nificantlv, Lugar's chief backer for the key leadership post was
Reagan's closest friend in the Senate, Sen. Paul Laxalt (R-Nev.)
Reagan had made no secret of his antipathy for the outspoken
Packwood but there was no visible evidence that the president
played a direct role in the move to dump him. Nevertheless, Sen.
Warren Rudman (R-N.H.) a Packwood supporter, protested
that "there has been some White House meddling," apparently
by Reagan aides working behind the scenes for Lugar.
Several senators said privately they voted for Lugar because of
the need to ease severe strains between the White House and the
campaign committee, which has the critical task in 1984 of help
ing the GOP retain control of the Senate. Nineteen Republican
senators are up for re-election then.
Soviets restock Syrian arms
Damascus, Syria — The Soviet Union, according to the best
intelligence estimates here, has already replaced Syria's losses in
jet fighters and modern battle tanks from the summer fighting
with Israel and may have upgraded this country's anti-aircraft
missile systems.
But intelligence estimates in a closed society such as President
Hafez Assad's Syria are based largely on sketchy, often im
pressionistic, information and as a result, the conclusions are
considered tentative at best.
At a time when Syrian businessmen are bitterly complaining
that the rigidity of government import controls has dried up the
flow of commerce from abroad, the figures for the third quarter
indicated that the two Mediterranean ports were as busy as they
were a year ago when trade was not being pinched.
Instead of handling normal commodity imports, it turned out,
the two Syrian ports have been kept busy with the flow of new
arms from the Soviet Union to replace the heavy losses from
their clash with Israel in Lebanon last summer.
The figures give only tonnages, not types of goods. But for
eigners traveling around the country in recent months have had
little difficulty establishing that the Soviet Union has made up
Syria's summer losses — and then some.
In recent months, travelers have spotted columns of new Sovi
et T-62 and T-72 tanks on transporters moving on the highway
south of Horns, apparently on their way to supply depots north
of Damascus from where they are to be distributed to the re
constituted army units as replacements for the 300 or so tanks
and armored personnel carriers that were lost when Israel
punched north through Lebanon last June.
Wall Street teeters
New York — Stock prices finished mixed for the second
straight day yesterday in what one analyst characterized as a tug
of war on Wall Street.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 8.19 points in
volatile trading Wednesday, rose 2.02 to close at 1033.11. At one
point during the session, the blue-chip average was up more than
10 points.

Committee allocates $988 million for MX
Washington — In a narrow, hard-fought White House victory for the MX
missile, the House Appropriations Committee voted yesterday to include
$988 million for MX procurement in its 1983 defense spending bill.
The crucial vote was by the narrowest possible margin — a 26-26 tie that
defeated the effort by Rep. Joseph Addabbo (D-N. Y.) to delete procurement
funds for the controversial weapon.
Addabbo also lost, by voice vote, an effort to cut out $ 1.45 billion for MX
research and development and, by a 34-18 vote, an attempt to delete $4
billion for the B-1B bomber. His amendment to slash $3.5 billion for nuclear
aircraft carrier also went down to defeat, 29-17.
President Reagan, who had lobbied personally for the MX funds, hailed
the vote yesterday as "a vote for a stronger, more secure America."
But, speaking to reporters in Sao Paulo, Brazil, during his Latin America
tour, he acknowledged that the MX battle is not over in Congress.
"We're not jumping up and down and claiming the victory, because we
know it's going to be a very tough battle on the floor," Reagan said of the
expected full House and Senate votes next week.
"I think the floor vote will be just as tough as this," agreed Rep. Jack Ed
wards (R-Ala.) the House Appropriations Committee member who led the
administration's pro-MX effort. "We're not out of the woods yet."
The committee also approved the entire $231.6 billion 1983 defense spend
ing bill by voice vote yesterday, despite Addabbo's complaint that the meas
ure would fund more, in inflation-adjusted dollars, than was spent at the
peak of the Vietnam War.
"I support a strong national defense like everyone else in this room, but I
don't think we have to fund every expensive toy the admirals, generals and
contractors think we should have," Addabbo said.
First mechanical heart works
Salt Lake City — Barney Clark, the recipient of the lirst permanent me
chanical heart, regained consciousness yesterday, nodded his head, recog
nized his wife and indicated to doctors that he wasn't in pain.
"I think it's a success," said a tired but smiling Dr. William DeVries in a
briefing after the seven-hour emergency transplant operation ended at dawn
yesterday.
Describing the implantation of the plastic, cloth and metal heart as
"almost a spiritual experience," DeVries said, "it isn't over yet, it's just a
beginning." Clark, a retired dentist who was too old to be a candidate for a
scarce human heart, was in critical condition yesterday in the University of
Utah Medical Center intensive care unit. But his vital signs were stable after
being so near death Wednesday night that his operation was con
ducted nine hours earlier than planned.
Clark will spend the rest of his life connected by 6-foot hoses to
375 pounds of equipment mounted on a wheeled cart and
plugged into an electrical outlet with a backup power source.
The 61-year-old patient was selected for the mechanical heart
because his condition was otherwise inoperable, and he had a
"stable home situation" with a "reliable spouse" as well as
"stable psychological mechanisms," the hospital said. He was
suffering from cardiomyopathy, a deterioration of the heart that
kills about 10,000 Americans a year.
The operation by the 38-year-old surgeon, the only physician
authorized to conduct the procedure by the Food and Drug Ad
ministration, was the culmination of 25 years of research into an
artificial heart.
Reagan invites Brazilian astronauts
Sao Paulo, Brazil — President Reagan preached the virtues of
free enterprise, unrestricted world trade and individual liberty to
Brazilian industrialists yesterday and declared that the United
States and Brazil should jointly explore the frontiers of space.
"Today, I would like to propose ... to have a Brazilian
astronaut train with ours so that Brazil and the United States can
one day participate in a shuttle launch together as partners in
space," Reagan said to a group of U.S. and Brazilian busi
nessmen assembled in the governor's palace here.
Reagan's celebration of U.S.-Brazilian cooperation won en
thusiastic applause from his audience. Afterward, Joseph
Sanchez, president of General Motors Brazil, said that Reagan
had accomplished more in one or two days to improve relations
between the two countries than had been accomplished in 20
years.
But not all Brazilians were as ecstatic about Reagan's goodwill
efforts. The influential Journal do Brasil yesterday quoted a Bra
zilian official as saying that Reagan's speech in Brasilia Wednes
day had "a touch of Banana Republic to it" despite the U.S. pres
ident's evident sincerity.
While stressing that Reagan had initiated a welcome new
climate in U.S.-Brazilian relations, Brazilian officials in the capi
tal yesterday told Washington Post correspondent Jackson
Diehl that the closer ties sought by the United States remained
more a matter of potential than reality.
Although praising Reagan's personal style, they said that U.S.
handling of its new initiatives with Brazil had at times appeared
heavy handed, and that U.S. expectations of a "special rela
tionship" with Brazil in the future were overdrawn and un
realistic.
"If anyone is thinking in terms of a special relationship," said
a senior Brazilian Foreign Ministry official, using the phrase for
close U.S.-Brazil ties developed by Henry Kissinger during the
Ford administration, "forget it, it's not going to happen."
Watt blocked from granting drilling rights
Washington — The House Appropriations Committee ap
proved legislation yesterday prohibiting Interior Secretary
James Watt from granting oil drilling rights off most of the Cali
fornia coast and in federal wilderness areas.
The committee on voice vote approved a $7.38 billion ap
propriations bill for the department that include the prohibi
tions.
The bill now goes to the House floor, where a vote is tentative
ly scheduled today.
The California provision stops Watt from approving oil and
gas leases on the outer continental shelf off the northern two
thirds of the coastline, roughly from Pismo Beach to the Oregon
border.
It does not include recent finds by Phillips Petroleum and
Chevron in the Santa Maria Basin.
Watt had planned to sell drilling rights to the area next Sep
tember. But the committee, in its report on the bill, said that drill
ing along the coast offers little potential for major discoveries
and great risk to the environment.
The wilderness provision continues a current ban on leases in
designated wilderness areas and on national forest land being
studied for wilderness protection.
The current ban expires on Dec. 17, while the new one would
extend through next September if enacted.

dent's behest.
They are Health and Human Services Secretary Richard
Schweiker and Environmental Protection Agency Adminis
trator Anne Gorsuch.
Their appeals are symptomatic of problems President Reagan
is likely to face in his Cabinet as well as on Capitol Hill as he
presses for cuts in domestic spending on top of the large ones al
ready made in the past two years.
Reagan, seeking to protect both his proposed military buildup
and the third year of his tax cut, has said he will rely on cuts in
domestic programs to hold down the looming federal deficit.
OMB Director David Stockman, in a first round of decisions
on the fiscal 1984 budget that will go to Congress early next year,
has ordered program cuts consistent with a $25 billion to $30
billion eventual decrease in domestic spending. Agency heads
can appeal these decisions, to Stockman, then to Reagan.
Schweiker, in a confidential letter of protest to Stockman
dated Nov. 29, objected to "drastic" reductions in personnel for
the Social Security Administration, which would lose 5000 peo
ple and be limited to 79,500, and the Health Care Financing Ad
ministration, which would be allowed only 3800 people instead
of Schweiker's proposed 4483.
Gorsuch reportedly plans to appeal almost all elements of the
OMB's II percent cut in the agency's $974 million operating
budget request, in large part because she feels reallocations of
money and personnel within the agency trespass on her pre
rogatives as administrator.
Packard ousted from chairmanship
Washington — Sen. Bob Packwood (R-Ore.) who had charged
that President Reagan was driving blacks, Latinos, women and
Jews away from the Republican Party, was ousted yesterday as
chairman of the Senate Republican Campaign Committee.
Pack wood's GOP colleagues, meeting in a closed session,
voted 29-25 to replace him with Sen. Richard Lugar (R-Ind.) Sig

nificantlv, Lugar's chief backer for the key leadership post was
Reagan's closest friend in the Senate, Sen. Paul Laxalt (R-Nev.)
Reagan had made no secret of his antipathy for the outspoken
Packwood but there was no visible evidence that the president
played a direct role in the move to dump him. Nevertheless, Sen.
Warren Rudman (R-N.H.) a Packwood supporter, protested
that "there has been some White House meddling," apparently
by Reagan aides working behind the scenes for Lugar.
Several senators said privately they voted for Lugar because of
the need to ease severe strains between the White House and the
campaign committee, which has the critical task in 1984 of help
ing the GOP retain control of the Senate. Nineteen Republican
senators are up for re-election then.
Soviets restock Syrian arms
Damascus, Syria — The Soviet Union, according to the best
intelligence estimates here, has already replaced Syria's losses in
jet fighters and modern battle tanks from the summer fighting
with Israel and may have upgraded this country's anti-aircraft
missile systems.
But intelligence estimates in a closed society such as President
Hafez Assad's Syria are based largely on sketchy, often im
pressionistic, information and as a result, the conclusions are
considered tentative at best.
At a time when Syrian businessmen are bitterly complaining
that the rigidity of government import controls has dried up the
flow of commerce from abroad, the figures for the third quarter
indicated that the two Mediterranean ports were as busy as they
were a year ago when trade was not being pinched.
Instead of handling normal commodity imports, it turned out,
the two Syrian ports have been kept busy with the flow of new
arms from the Soviet Union to replace the heavy losses from
their clash with Israel in Lebanon last summer.
The figures give only tonnages, not types of goods. But for
eigners traveling around the country in recent months have had
little difficulty establishing that the Soviet Union has made up
Syria's summer losses — and then some.
In recent months, travelers have spotted columns of new Sovi
et T-62 and T-72 tanks on transporters moving on the highway
south of Horns, apparently on their way to supply depots north
of Damascus from where they are to be distributed to the re
constituted army units as replacements for the 300 or so tanks
and armored personnel carriers that were lost when Israel
punched north through Lebanon last June.
Wall Street teeters
New York — Stock prices finished mixed for the second
straight day yesterday in what one analyst characterized as a tug
of war on Wall Street.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 8.19 points in
volatile trading Wednesday, rose 2.02 to close at 1033.11. At one
point during the session, the blue-chip average was up more than
10 points.

Committee allocates $988 million for MX
Washington — In a narrow, hard-fought White House victory for the MX
missile, the House Appropriations Committee voted yesterday to include
$988 million for MX procurement in its 1983 defense spending bill.
The crucial vote was by the narrowest possible margin — a 26-26 tie that
defeated the effort by Rep. Joseph Addabbo (D-N. Y.) to delete procurement
funds for the controversial weapon.
Addabbo also lost, by voice vote, an effort to cut out $ 1.45 billion for MX
research and development and, by a 34-18 vote, an attempt to delete $4
billion for the B-1B bomber. His amendment to slash $3.5 billion for nuclear
aircraft carrier also went down to defeat, 29-17.
President Reagan, who had lobbied personally for the MX funds, hailed
the vote yesterday as "a vote for a stronger, more secure America."
But, speaking to reporters in Sao Paulo, Brazil, during his Latin America
tour, he acknowledged that the MX battle is not over in Congress.
"We're not jumping up and down and claiming the victory, because we
know it's going to be a very tough battle on the floor," Reagan said of the
expected full House and Senate votes next week.
"I think the floor vote will be just as tough as this," agreed Rep. Jack Ed
wards (R-Ala.) the House Appropriations Committee member who led the
administration's pro-MX effort. "We're not out of the woods yet."
The committee also approved the entire $231.6 billion 1983 defense spend
ing bill by voice vote yesterday, despite Addabbo's complaint that the meas
ure would fund more, in inflation-adjusted dollars, than was spent at the
peak of the Vietnam War.
"I support a strong national defense like everyone else in this room, but I
don't think we have to fund every expensive toy the admirals, generals and
contractors think we should have," Addabbo said.
First mechanical heart works
Salt Lake City — Barney Clark, the recipient of the lirst permanent me
chanical heart, regained consciousness yesterday, nodded his head, recog
nized his wife and indicated to doctors that he wasn't in pain.
"I think it's a success," said a tired but smiling Dr. William DeVries in a
briefing after the seven-hour emergency transplant operation ended at dawn
yesterday.
Describing the implantation of the plastic, cloth and metal heart as
"almost a spiritual experience," DeVries said, "it isn't over yet, it's just a
beginning." Clark, a retired dentist who was too old to be a candidate for a
scarce human heart, was in critical condition yesterday in the University of
Utah Medical Center intensive care unit. But his vital signs were stable after
being so near death Wednesday night that his operation was con
ducted nine hours earlier than planned.
Clark will spend the rest of his life connected by 6-foot hoses to
375 pounds of equipment mounted on a wheeled cart and
plugged into an electrical outlet with a backup power source.
The 61-year-old patient was selected for the mechanical heart
because his condition was otherwise inoperable, and he had a
"stable home situation" with a "reliable spouse" as well as
"stable psychological mechanisms," the hospital said. He was
suffering from cardiomyopathy, a deterioration of the heart that
kills about 10,000 Americans a year.
The operation by the 38-year-old surgeon, the only physician
authorized to conduct the procedure by the Food and Drug Ad
ministration, was the culmination of 25 years of research into an
artificial heart.
Reagan invites Brazilian astronauts
Sao Paulo, Brazil — President Reagan preached the virtues of
free enterprise, unrestricted world trade and individual liberty to
Brazilian industrialists yesterday and declared that the United
States and Brazil should jointly explore the frontiers of space.
"Today, I would like to propose ... to have a Brazilian
astronaut train with ours so that Brazil and the United States can
one day participate in a shuttle launch together as partners in
space," Reagan said to a group of U.S. and Brazilian busi
nessmen assembled in the governor's palace here.
Reagan's celebration of U.S.-Brazilian cooperation won en
thusiastic applause from his audience. Afterward, Joseph
Sanchez, president of General Motors Brazil, said that Reagan
had accomplished more in one or two days to improve relations
between the two countries than had been accomplished in 20
years.
But not all Brazilians were as ecstatic about Reagan's goodwill
efforts. The influential Journal do Brasil yesterday quoted a Bra
zilian official as saying that Reagan's speech in Brasilia Wednes
day had "a touch of Banana Republic to it" despite the U.S. pres
ident's evident sincerity.
While stressing that Reagan had initiated a welcome new
climate in U.S.-Brazilian relations, Brazilian officials in the capi
tal yesterday told Washington Post correspondent Jackson
Diehl that the closer ties sought by the United States remained
more a matter of potential than reality.
Although praising Reagan's personal style, they said that U.S.
handling of its new initiatives with Brazil had at times appeared
heavy handed, and that U.S. expectations of a "special rela
tionship" with Brazil in the future were overdrawn and un
realistic.
"If anyone is thinking in terms of a special relationship," said
a senior Brazilian Foreign Ministry official, using the phrase for
close U.S.-Brazil ties developed by Henry Kissinger during the
Ford administration, "forget it, it's not going to happen."
Watt blocked from granting drilling rights
Washington — The House Appropriations Committee ap
proved legislation yesterday prohibiting Interior Secretary
James Watt from granting oil drilling rights off most of the Cali
fornia coast and in federal wilderness areas.
The committee on voice vote approved a $7.38 billion ap
propriations bill for the department that include the prohibi
tions.
The bill now goes to the House floor, where a vote is tentative
ly scheduled today.
The California provision stops Watt from approving oil and
gas leases on the outer continental shelf off the northern two
thirds of the coastline, roughly from Pismo Beach to the Oregon
border.
It does not include recent finds by Phillips Petroleum and
Chevron in the Santa Maria Basin.
Watt had planned to sell drilling rights to the area next Sep
tember. But the committee, in its report on the bill, said that drill
ing along the coast offers little potential for major discoveries
and great risk to the environment.
The wilderness provision continues a current ban on leases in
designated wilderness areas and on national forest land being
studied for wilderness protection.
The current ban expires on Dec. 17, while the new one would
extend through next September if enacted.
Brown nominates Grodin
Sacramento — Appeals Court Justice Joseph Grodin, a former
labor mediator with a liberal reputation, was nominated yester
day by Gov. Brown as his seventh and final scheduled appointee
to the state Supreme Court.
Grodin, 52, was an original Brown appointee to the state farm
labor board in 1975. He would succeed Justice Frank Newman,
who is retiring Dec. 12.
"I'm excited, pleased and quite humbled," said Grodin, a la

bor lawyer and protege of the late Supreme Court Justice
Mathew Tobriner.
Asked about his views, Grodin said, "I believe my commit
ment reflects a strong view of free speech and civil liberties and
that mv views are moderate as to criminal proceedings. But I
don't think much of labels."
He also said the state Supreme Court, a frequent target of
criticism from political conservatives, "is the pinnacle of the ju
diciary, except for the U.S. Supreme Court."
Brown nominated his former legal affairs secretary, J. An
thony Kline, to succeed Grodin as presiding justice of Division 2
of the Ist District Court of Appeal in San Francisco. Kline was
appointed to the Superior Court by Brown in 1980 and had been
considered a candidate for the Supreme Court.
The Democratic governor, moving quickly to fill 18 newly
created appeals court positions, made three more appointments
in San hrancisco, all of them Superior Court judges who are
being nominated to the higher court.
Economic woes may halt arms race
Washington — Vice President George Bush said yesterday that
both the United States and the Soviet Union face "enormous"
economic problems that could affect military spending and has
ten an agreement to limit the nuclear arms race.
But Bush also told reporters over lunch at the vice president's
mansion that the United States still can better afford to build up
its defenses. And he expressed concern that congressional at
tempts to scale down President Reagan's ambitious rearmament
program would "send a signal" to the Soviets "fhat we're not
going to be able to follow through."
Bush, who talked with new Soviet leader Yuri Andropov in
Moscow last month after attending the funeral of Leonid
Brezhnev, was questioned about whether the change in leader
ship in Moscow can be expected to change Soviet-American rela
tions.
"An ingredient that's different looked at over the immediate
future is there are some economic problems that haven't always
been present on either side," Bush said. "One of the things that's
different is the enormous economic overload, not just on the So
viet Union alone, or on the United States alone, but on the bloc
countries. . .."
There is a "new economic dynamic" that could restrain the So
viet military expansion, Bush said. He expressed doubts that the
Soviet Union is prepared to devote to defense an unlimited share
of its resources, regardless of the costs to its domestic economy.
"I'm not sure that shouldn't be challenged," Bush said. "I'm
saying there is a new economic dynamic and I hope that will be
among other things that push to a reduction, verifiable and
equitable, in nuclear weapons. That's the point I'm making."
Agencies protest budget cuts

indicated that the two Mediterranean ports were as busy as they
were a year ago when trade was not being pinched.
Instead of handling normal commodity imports, it turned out,
the two Syrian ports have been kept busy with the flow of new
arms from the Soviet Union to replace the heavy losses from
their clash with Israel in Lebanon last summer.
The figures give only tonnages, not types of goods. But for
eigners traveling around the country in recent months have had
little difficulty establishing that the Soviet Union has made up
Syria's summer losses — and then some.
In recent months, travelers have spotted columns of new Sovi
et T-62 and T-72 tanks on transporters moving on the highway
south of Horns, apparently on their way to supply depots north
of Damascus from where they are to be distributed to the re
constituted army units as replacements for the 300 or so tanks
and armored personnel carriers that were lost when Israel
punched north through Lebanon last June.
