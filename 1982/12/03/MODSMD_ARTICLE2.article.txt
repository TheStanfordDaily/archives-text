Committee allocates $988 million for MX
Washington — In a narrow, hard-fought White House victory for the MX
missile, the House Appropriations Committee voted yesterday to include
$988 million for MX procurement in its 1983 defense spending bill.
The crucial vote was by the narrowest possible margin — a 26-26 tie that
defeated the effort by Rep. Joseph Addabbo (D-N. Y.) to delete procurement
funds for the controversial weapon.
Addabbo also lost, by voice vote, an effort to cut out $ 1.45 billion for MX
research and development and, by a 34-18 vote, an attempt to delete $4
billion for the B-1B bomber. His amendment to slash $3.5 billion for nuclear
aircraft carrier also went down to defeat, 29-17.
President Reagan, who had lobbied personally for the MX funds, hailed
the vote yesterday as "a vote for a stronger, more secure America."
But, speaking to reporters in Sao Paulo, Brazil, during his Latin America
tour, he acknowledged that the MX battle is not over in Congress.
"We're not jumping up and down and claiming the victory, because we
know it's going to be a very tough battle on the floor," Reagan said of the
expected full House and Senate votes next week.
"I think the floor vote will be just as tough as this," agreed Rep. Jack Ed
wards (R-Ala.) the House Appropriations Committee member who led the
administration's pro-MX effort. "We're not out of the woods yet."
The committee also approved the entire $231.6 billion 1983 defense spend
ing bill by voice vote yesterday, despite Addabbo's complaint that the meas
ure would fund more, in inflation-adjusted dollars, than was spent at the
peak of the Vietnam War.
"I support a strong national defense like everyone else in this room, but I
don't think we have to fund every expensive toy the admirals, generals and
contractors think we should have," Addabbo said.
First mechanical heart works
Salt Lake City — Barney Clark, the recipient of the lirst permanent me
chanical heart, regained consciousness yesterday, nodded his head, recog
nized his wife and indicated to doctors that he wasn't in pain.
"I think it's a success," said a tired but smiling Dr. William DeVries in a
briefing after the seven-hour emergency transplant operation ended at dawn
yesterday.
Describing the implantation of the plastic, cloth and metal heart as
"almost a spiritual experience," DeVries said, "it isn't over yet, it's just a
beginning." Clark, a retired dentist who was too old to be a candidate for a
scarce human heart, was in critical condition yesterday in the University of
Utah Medical Center intensive care unit. But his vital signs were stable after
