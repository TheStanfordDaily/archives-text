## Card hosts eastern schools in tourney 
### STEVE ODELL 
J The second annual Stanford
basketball Invitational Tour
nament will be, more than any
thing else, a meeting of the
' minds.
The four-team tournament,
'.opening tonight with the host
-Cardinal taking on Lafayette at 7
p.m. at Maples Pavilion, features
four of the biggest coaching
names to come out of the East.
Temple plays the University of
*Rhode Island at 9 p.m. in the
with the semi-finals
'and finals scheduled for 7 and 9
' p.m. tomorrow.
*. First-year Stanford coach
.Tom Davis now resides in the
West, but for the past five years
; Davis spent his weekends in New
-England, coaching Boston Col
lege to a 100-47 record and to one
'Rational Invitational Tour
nament and two NCAA Tour
nament berths.
' "All of the coaches know each
,'pther and have great admiration
. ifor each other," said Rhode Is
;4and coach Claude English at a
\ press luncheon yesterday."I

think it adds a special flavor to
the tournament."
"I thought we were getting rid
of Dr. Davis," English quipped.
"When he left after last season,
all us coaches got together and
had a party."
English, a former basketball
player for URI, was an original
Portland Trailblazer of the NBA
before returning to Rhode Island
as an assistant. When Jack Kraft
became ill at the beginning of the
1980-81 season, English took
over on an interim basis and
guided the Rams to a 21-8 sea
son, the Eastern 8 regular season
championship, and an NIT berth
for which he was named con
ference co-coach of the year.
Temple coach John Chaney is
in his first year, but he earned a
name for himself at Cheyney
State College, where he compiled
a nine-year record of 228-59 and
won the NCAA Division II na
tional championship in 1978.
Completing the quartet is La
fayette coach Will Rackley, now
in his third season. Rackley, the
brother of NBA player Luther

Rackley, has led the Leopards to
a 27-28 mark since assuming the
head post, including an East
Coast Conference-West section
title in 1980-81.
Davis spoke with respect for
his opponents. "In Lafayette,
Rhode Island and Temple, you
have three teams that have been
dominant on the East Coast over
the past decade," he said. "Tem
ple is coming off one of its
strongest seasons, while both
Lafvette and URI feel they have
improved and are looking for
ward to very good seasons. I'm
excited about the tournament, es
pecially since it will give the fans
on the West Coast an opportuni
ty to see just how far Eastern
teams have come over the course
of the past half dozen years."
Stanford is coming off of a
73-42 nonconference victory over
Sonoma State, a victory which
raised its record to 2-0. The
Cardinal had 32 turnovers in the
game, of which Davis referred to
as "growing pains."
"I'm really looking forward to
seeing how we do myself," Davis
said. "We've been real erratic up
to this point, but I've been
pleased with the effort from the
players.
"We have six guys who were
not in this program a year ago
and we were 7-20 last season, so
it's obvious we're going to have
some problems. These are only
compounded when you try to
run."
Leading the Cardinal's efforts
has been John Revelli, who
former Stanford All-America
and coach Howie Dallmar called
"the best power forward to ever
play at Stanford University."
"He's been tremendous," said
Davis of Revelli, who is averag
ing 18.5 points and 7.5 rebounds
a game. "He's a proven com
petitor, I don't think there's any
question about that." /
Guard Keith Jones has played
his sixth-man role to the hilt,
coming off the bench to lead the
Card in scoring average with 19.0
points per game. Freshman
Keith Ramee has directed the
Stanford offensive attack, pick
ing up six steals and 13 assists in
the first two games.
The Cardinal's first-round op
ponent, Lafayette, opened its
season with wins over Moravian
and Drew. The Leopards's lead
ing scorer is guard Stan Morse,
who is scoring at a 19.5 clip. After

him comes forward Chet Bright
ful, averaging 12.5 points per
game.
"We're a young team, starting
two juniors and three
sophomores," said Rackley.
"And I'm not really sure how
good we're going to be, but we're
going to be a competitive team
starting Friday night."
Temple is led by si\-foot-eight
junior forward Granger Hall, an
honorable mention All-America
who was also the Big Five's Most
Improved Player and the ECC
co-Player-of-the-Year. Hall
scored 21 points and grabbed six
rebounds in the Owls's 68-67 sea
son opening win over George
Washington.
"He's an All-America player
in every sense of the word for us,"
said Chanev.
Hall is joined by 6-5 swingman
Terence Stansbury, who aver
aged 12.8 points pejr game and led
the Owls in steals a year ago with
37. Temple will be playing
without two of its starters, 6-5
Charles Rayne and guard Ed
Coe.
"We envisioned starting out as
a running and gunning team,"
said Chaney. "But with these in
juries, it'll probably be more like
laying and praying."
A member of the newly
formed Atlantic-10 Conference
along with Temple is Rhode Is
land, a team who slumped to
10-17 a year ago. The Rams like
to play fast-break basketball, as
exemplified by their season open
er, a 108-94 win over Stonehill.
URI also put 139 points on the
board in an exhibition victory
over the Jingsu Club Team from
Peking, China.
"We're not in an easy situ
ation," said English. "We're
coming off a 10-17 record, we
have only two seniors and five
new faces, we're turning the ball
over regularly, and we're giving
up 94 points a game. There's ob
viously a lot we need to work
on."
The Rams's top two offensive
weapons are 6-6 forward Marc
Upshaw, who averaged 16.9
points and 8.7 rebounds last sea
son, and 6-4 guard Horace "Pap
py" Owens, who averaged 15.4
points and added 80 assists in
1981-82.
The Cardinal was runncr-up in
the first-ever Stanford Invita
tional last season, losing to Penn
sylvania 71-63 in the finals.

guided the Rams to a 21-8 sea
son, the Eastern 8 regular season
championship, and an NIT berth
for which he was named con
ference co-coach of the year.
Temple coach John Chaney is
in his first year, but he earned a
name for himself at Cheyney
State College, where he compiled
a nine-year record of 228-59 and
won the NCAA Division II na
tional championship in 1978.
Completing the quartet is La
fayette coach Will Rackley, now
in his third season. Rackley, the
brother of NBA player Luther

Rackley, has led the Leopards to
a 27-28 mark since assuming the
head post, including an East
Coast Conference-West section
title in 1980-81.
Davis spoke with respect for
his opponents. "In Lafayette,
Rhode Island and Temple, you
have three teams that have been
dominant on the East Coast over
the past decade," he said. "Tem
ple is coming off one of its
strongest seasons, while both
Lafvette and URI feel they have
improved and are looking for
ward to very good seasons. I'm
excited about the tournament, es
pecially since it will give the fans
on the West Coast an opportuni
ty to see just how far Eastern
teams have come over the course
of the past half dozen years."
Stanford is coming off of a
73-42 nonconference victory over
Sonoma State, a victory which
raised its record to 2-0. The
Cardinal had 32 turnovers in the
game, of which Davis referred to
as "growing pains."
"I'm really looking forward to
seeing how we do myself," Davis
said. "We've been real erratic up
to this point, but I've been
pleased with the effort from the
players.
"We have six guys who were
not in this program a year ago
and we were 7-20 last season, so
it's obvious we're going to have
some problems. These are only
compounded when you try to
run."
Leading the Cardinal's efforts
has been John Revelli, who
former Stanford All-America
and coach Howie Dallmar called
"the best power forward to ever
play at Stanford University."
"He's been tremendous," said
Davis of Revelli, who is averag
ing 18.5 points and 7.5 rebounds
a game. "He's a proven com
petitor, I don't think there's any
question about that." /
Guard Keith Jones has played
his sixth-man role to the hilt,
coming off the bench to lead the
Card in scoring average with 19.0
points per game. Freshman
Keith Ramee has directed the
Stanford offensive attack, pick
ing up six steals and 13 assists in
the first two games.
The Cardinal's first-round op
ponent, Lafayette, opened its
season with wins over Moravian
and Drew. The Leopards's lead
ing scorer is guard Stan Morse,
who is scoring at a 19.5 clip. After

him comes forward Chet Bright
ful, averaging 12.5 points per
game.
"We're a young team, starting
two juniors and three
sophomores," said Rackley.
"And I'm not really sure how
good we're going to be, but we're
going to be a competitive team
starting Friday night."
Temple is led by si\-foot-eight
junior forward Granger Hall, an
honorable mention All-America
who was also the Big Five's Most
Improved Player and the ECC
co-Player-of-the-Year. Hall
scored 21 points and grabbed six
rebounds in the Owls's 68-67 sea
son opening win over George
Washington.
"He's an All-America player
in every sense of the word for us,"
said Chanev.
Hall is joined by 6-5 swingman
Terence Stansbury, who aver
aged 12.8 points pejr game and led
the Owls in steals a year ago with
37. Temple will be playing
without two of its starters, 6-5
Charles Rayne and guard Ed
Coe.
"We envisioned starting out as
a running and gunning team,"
said Chaney. "But with these in
juries, it'll probably be more like
laying and praying."
A member of the newly
formed Atlantic-10 Conference
along with Temple is Rhode Is
land, a team who slumped to
10-17 a year ago. The Rams like
to play fast-break basketball, as
exemplified by their season open
er, a 108-94 win over Stonehill.
URI also put 139 points on the
board in an exhibition victory
over the Jingsu Club Team from
Peking, China.
"We're not in an easy situ
ation," said English. "We're
coming off a 10-17 record, we
have only two seniors and five
new faces, we're turning the ball
over regularly, and we're giving
up 94 points a game. There's ob
viously a lot we need to work
on."
The Rams's top two offensive
weapons are 6-6 forward Marc
Upshaw, who averaged 16.9
points and 8.7 rebounds last sea
son, and 6-4 guard Horace "Pap
py" Owens, who averaged 15.4
points and added 80 assists in
1981-82.
The Cardinal was runncr-up in
the first-ever Stanford Invita
tional last season, losing to Penn
sylvania 71-63 in the finals.

Cardinal had 32 turnovers in the
game, of which Davis referred to
as "growing pains."
"I'm really looking forward to
seeing how we do myself," Davis
said. "We've been real erratic up
to this point, but I've been
pleased with the effort from the
players.
"We have six guys who were
not in this program a year ago
and we were 7-20 last season, so
it's obvious we're going to have
some problems. These are only
compounded when you try to
run."
Leading the Cardinal's efforts
has been John Revelli, who
former Stanford All-America
and coach Howie Dallmar called
"the best power forward to ever
play at Stanford University."
"He's been tremendous," said
Davis of Revelli, who is averag
ing 18.5 points and 7.5 rebounds
a game. "He's a proven com
petitor, I don't think there's any
question about that." /
Guard Keith Jones has played
his sixth-man role to the hilt,
coming off the bench to lead the
Card in scoring average with 19.0
points per game. Freshman
Keith Ramee has directed the
Stanford offensive attack, pick
ing up six steals and 13 assists in
the first two games.
The Cardinal's first-round op
ponent, Lafayette, opened its
season with wins over Moravian
and Drew. The Leopards's lead
ing scorer is guard Stan Morse,
who is scoring at a 19.5 clip. After

him comes forward Chet Bright
ful, averaging 12.5 points per
game.
"We're a young team, starting
two juniors and three
sophomores," said Rackley.
"And I'm not really sure how
good we're going to be, but we're
going to be a competitive team
starting Friday night."
Temple is led by si\-foot-eight
junior forward Granger Hall, an
honorable mention All-America
who was also the Big Five's Most
Improved Player and the ECC
co-Player-of-the-Year. Hall
scored 21 points and grabbed six
rebounds in the Owls's 68-67 sea
son opening win over George
Washington.
"He's an All-America player
in every sense of the word for us,"
said Chanev.
Hall is joined by 6-5 swingman
Terence Stansbury, who aver
aged 12.8 points pejr game and led
the Owls in steals a year ago with
37. Temple will be playing
without two of its starters, 6-5
Charles Rayne and guard Ed
Coe.
"We envisioned starting out as
a running and gunning team,"
said Chaney. "But with these in
juries, it'll probably be more like
laying and praying."
A member of the newly
formed Atlantic-10 Conference
along with Temple is Rhode Is
land, a team who slumped to
10-17 a year ago. The Rams like
to play fast-break basketball, as
exemplified by their season open
er, a 108-94 win over Stonehill.
URI also put 139 points on the
board in an exhibition victory
over the Jingsu Club Team from
Peking, China.
"We're not in an easy situ
ation," said English. "We're
coming off a 10-17 record, we
have only two seniors and five
new faces, we're turning the ball
over regularly, and we're giving
up 94 points a game. There's ob
viously a lot we need to work
on."
The Rams's top two offensive
weapons are 6-6 forward Marc
Upshaw, who averaged 16.9
points and 8.7 rebounds last sea
son, and 6-4 guard Horace "Pap
py" Owens, who averaged 15.4
points and added 80 assists in
1981-82.
The Cardinal was runncr-up in
the first-ever Stanford Invita
tional last season, losing to Penn
sylvania 71-63 in the finals.
