# Oregon slips by wrestlers

### MARK MARTEL 
Defending Pacific-10 champion Oregon nar
rowly slipped past upset-minded Stanford 27-21
in a conference wrestling match at Maples Pavil
ion last night.
Both teams won five matches, but Oregon
claimed the win with two falls and several
lopsided decisions.
Stanford was within reach of an upset going
into the final match, but Oregon's 300-pound
heavyweight Dan Cook sealed the win for the
Ducks with a 18-9 decision over Ed Katz.
"We scared the hell out of them," said Stan
ford head coach Chris Horpel. "We went head
to head with the conference champions and
came within one match of beating them."
The Ducks came out firing with big wins in the
118 and 126 pound weight classes. Oregon's
I4th-ranked Mike Erb pinned Bert Fukunaga at
the 4:54 mark and IBth-ranked Miles Hancock
decisioned Bill George 16-4.
The Cardinal came roaring back at 134
pounds as freshman Jeff Bradley dominated
Travis Hancock in a 13-0 shutout.
Freshman Scott Wiggen followed with a 14-7
win over Lorenzo West and Stanford took a
14-11 lead when freshman Pete Rogers pinned

Randy Barkhurst just 43 seconds into the match.
Oregon's Rick O'Shea responded by pinning
Jeff Hazard at the 6:33 mark to regain the lead.
Stanford's Tom Mullen tied it 17-17 with a thrill
ing 10-7 victory over Charles Nutter.
Mullen confirmed his reputation as the
"Cardiac Kid" of Stanford wrestling by scoring
a two-point reversal and a two-point near-fall
with just five seconds remaining to pull out the
victory.
Freshman Scott DuFault was pinned at the
1:54 mark by Keith Miller, but when Stanford's
Doug Perkins snuffed out Scott Ames 9-0, the
Cardinal trailed by only two points.
But Oregon's eighth-ranked Cook decisioned
Katz 10-7 after Katz had nearly pinned Cook
earlier in the match.
"I'm very proud of how this team performed
tonight," Horpel said. "Every guy wrestled with
a lot of heart. That is what is most important to
me, win or lose.
"I think we showed considerable improve
ment since out victory over Portland State last
Sunday. If we keep it up, we'll have an excellent
season. And with seven of our 10 starters being
freshmen, the future of the team is very bright."
