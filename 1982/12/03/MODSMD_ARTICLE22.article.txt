## Horsing around ruins Heisman race 
### 
Hello ladies and gentlemen
and welcome to Heisman Hills,
home of the famous Heisman
Trot race. My name is Howie
Bigmouth with Dandy Dum
here to bring you the grand
daddy of horse races.

Berns Aside

As the announcer's voice
blared over the public address
system, I turned to my friend
to ask him a couple of ques
tions about the race. I had
never been to this event, and
quite frankly did not under
stand what all the fuss was
about.
They're lining up at the
starting gate. It's Elway,
Walker, Dickerson, Marino.
Eason, Blackledge. and
Ramsey. And there they go.
It's Elway. followed by Walk
er, Dickerson and then
Marino. It looks like Marino
and Walker had a tough time
getting out of the blocks and
have a lot of ground to make
up.
As the announcer voice
blared over the intercom, the
first thing I thought I'd do was

ask my friend about the race.
"So how do they determine
the winner," I naively asked?
"Is it the horse with the fastest
time?"
What seemed logical to me
made my friend laugh at my
ignorance. "The fastest time
winning the race," he said.
"You have to be kidding.
"There are many variables
in winning the race. First of all
you have to have a good
team."
"What do you mean by a
good team," I asked?
"Well you see, it isn't just
the Heisman horses's times
which matter," my friend told
me. "The horses run in teams
and the judges adcf up the
scores of all the different
horses on a particular team."
"That doesn't make any
sense," I said. "What if one
Heisman horse has a better
team than another Heisman
horse? That isn't fair."
Our voices were soon muf
fled by the announcer's
hoarse voice.
And here they come around
the first stretch. Oh! It looks
like Elway has been bit by the
Trojan horse. After a slow

start. Walker is gaining some
steam, but Marino hasn't got
ten out of the gate.
As the announcers voice
died'out. I thought I had final
ly figured out how the race
worked. I he judges added the
scores of all the horses on a
team and the Heisman horse
with the best total score would
win. That's why all those Tro
jan horses did so well.
When I explained my
simple theory to my friend, he
again explained that I had it
all wrong.
"It isn't just the team that
matters," he explained.
"There are all of those people
up in that box over there."
"What do people sitting up
in some box have to do with
the Heisman race," I in
quired?
"It's the press box, dum
my," my friend said. ''It's the
eastern bias, media blitz, pub
lic relations game."
Now I was totally confused
but I let my friend go on.
"You see, the sports in
formation directors for each
of these horses sends out clip
pings, media tapes, and pic
tures of the each horse to the

people in that press box. The
people up in the box then get
to vote on the winner.
"The ones from the East
Coast vote for the eastern
horses, the Midwest writers
vote for the Midwestern
horSes, and the West Coast
writers vote strictly West
Coast."
Maybe that's how that
Griffin horse won it a couple
years back, I thought. He sure
wasn't the fastest. And all
those other memorable names
over the past few years. I
couldn't even think of any
names besides that Allen
horse.
As they come down the final
stretch, it's Elway and Walker,
neck and neck. While Elway's
been passing everybody up,
Walker has held his ground. A t
the finish, it's. . .
Somehow as the announc
er's voice died down for the
last time, I had lost interest in
the whole thing. I had come to
see a nice simple horse race,
but the rules of this thing
seemed too confusing. Some
how, who won, just didn't
seem to matter.

first thing I thought I'd do was

ask my friend about the race.
"So how do they determine
the winner," I naively asked?
"Is it the horse with the fastest
time?"
What seemed logical to me
made my friend laugh at my
ignorance. "The fastest time
winning the race," he said.
"You have to be kidding.
"There are many variables
in winning the race. First of all
you have to have a good
team."
"What do you mean by a
good team," I asked?
"Well you see, it isn't just
the Heisman horses's times
which matter," my friend told
me. "The horses run in teams
and the judges adcf up the
scores of all the different
horses on a particular team."
"That doesn't make any
sense," I said. "What if one
Heisman horse has a better
team than another Heisman
horse? That isn't fair."
Our voices were soon muf
fled by the announcer's
hoarse voice.
And here they come around
the first stretch. Oh! It looks
like Elway has been bit by the
Trojan horse. After a slow

start. Walker is gaining some
steam, but Marino hasn't got
ten out of the gate.
As the announcers voice
died'out. I thought I had final
ly figured out how the race
worked. I he judges added the
scores of all the horses on a
team and the Heisman horse
with the best total score would
win. That's why all those Tro
jan horses did so well.
When I explained my
simple theory to my friend, he
again explained that I had it
all wrong.
"It isn't just the team that
matters," he explained.
"There are all of those people
up in that box over there."
"What do people sitting up
in some box have to do with
the Heisman race," I in
quired?
"It's the press box, dum
my," my friend said. ''It's the
eastern bias, media blitz, pub
lic relations game."
Now I was totally confused
but I let my friend go on.
"You see, the sports in
formation directors for each
of these horses sends out clip
pings, media tapes, and pic
tures of the each horse to the

people in that press box. The
people up in the box then get
to vote on the winner.
"The ones from the East
Coast vote for the eastern
horses, the Midwest writers
vote for the Midwestern
horSes, and the West Coast
writers vote strictly West
Coast."
Maybe that's how that
Griffin horse won it a couple
years back, I thought. He sure
wasn't the fastest. And all
those other memorable names
over the past few years. I
couldn't even think of any
names besides that Allen
horse.
As they come down the final
stretch, it's Elway and Walker,
neck and neck. While Elway's
been passing everybody up,
Walker has held his ground. A t
the finish, it's. . .
Somehow as the announc
er's voice died down for the
last time, I had lost interest in
the whole thing. I had come to
see a nice simple horse race,
but the rules of this thing
seemed too confusing. Some
how, who won, just didn't
seem to matter.
Hello ladies and gentlemen
and welcome to Heisman Hills,
home of the famous Heisman
Trot race. My name is Howie
Bigmouth with Dandy Dum
here to bring you the grand
daddy of horse races.

Berns Aside

As the announcer's voice
blared over the public address
system, I turned to my friend
to ask him a couple of ques
tions about the race. I had
never been to this event, and
quite frankly did not under
stand what all the fuss was
about.
They're lining up at the
starting gate. It's Elway,
Walker, Dickerson, Marino.
Eason, Blackledge. and
Ramsey. And there they go.
It's Elway. followed by Walk
er, Dickerson and then
Marino. It looks like Marino
and Walker had a tough time
getting out of the blocks and
have a lot of ground to make
up.
