Stanford's men's and women's
fencing teams go up against arch
rival San Jose State tomorrow in
a match-up that could earn the
Cardinal a national rating. "San
Jose's men and women are rated
in the Pre-season Top Ten'
poll," said head coach Buzz
Hurst, "and a victory over them
would probably break us into
that circle.
"Stanford is fielding two of the
strongest teams it has had in
years," Hurst said. "The men's
team is made up of returning let
termen or top freshmen recruits.

The only exceptions are junior
Jon Meyer and sophomore Chris
McConnell, and they have both
performed excellently so far."
The men are 2-0 on the season,
having defeated the University of
San Francisco 16-2 and San
Francisco State 22-5.
"The women rolled over San
Francisco State 16-0 in their
opener." said Hurst, "even
though both Cathy and Alison
were injured and couldn't fence.
Nevertheless, the San Jose State
women haven't lost a dual meet
since 1975 so we're facing a con

siderable psychological barrier.
Either way, I look for it to be a
real dogfight."
"The women's team is easily
the strongest I've coached,"
Hurst said. "We have a combina
tion of depth and experience
which is unusual for us." The
squad is composed of three letter
winners from last year, Pam
Henck, Cathy Correa, and
Alison Reid, plus freshman
standout Jennifer Yu.
The match starts at 1 p.m. in
Roble Gym; admission is free.
