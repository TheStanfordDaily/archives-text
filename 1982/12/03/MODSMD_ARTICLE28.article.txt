# No hoax! Official caught waving play dead
## 
### 
Stanford graduate student Chuck Machlin took this photo
graph of the stunning final play of this year's Big Game. One
official (circled right) is apparently calling the play dead as
Kevin Moen (circle left) takes off on his final jaunt through
the band and into the end zone. The photograph shows that
both Stanford and California benches have players on the
field, but there is no evidence that the Cal band is on the
field. Machlin told the Daily he did not realize he had this
photograph until his film was developed Wednesday. The
circled official was on the far sideline where Dwight Garner

was allegedly tackled near midfield. Stanford Sports In
formation Director Steve Raczynski said Paul Wiggin and
the athletic department will "probably discuss it (the photo
graph) over the weekend. We may want to get an explana
tion from the official for what appears to be a definitive ac
tion on his part." While there remains no appeal for the
game, Raczynski said the photo "certainly adds more fuel
to the fire and the Big Game (controversy) will go on a little
longer."
