# Cosell demands strict pro boxing standards
## 
### Associated Press 
Los Angeles â€” Howard Cosell,
who has informed ABC-TV that
he will no longer cover pro
fessional boxing, said yesterday a
choice should be made between
improving protection for the
fighters or abolishing the sport.
"I realize the sport is one man
seeking to knock the brains out
of another, but it still has been a
very important part of mv life,"
Cosell said. "I think anyone over
2 years old who has seen what's
going on should know that some
thing needs to be done.
"I have seen a lot in boxing,"
said Cosell who has described
and commented on major fights
for ABC, "and I have done my
best over the past two vears to
change things. I have testified
before the government.

"But mv fighting for new stan
dards was denounced bv the print
media," said Cosell, who was in
southern California for the tele
east of Thursday night's Na
tional League f'ootball game be
tween the Los Angeles Rams and
San Lrancisco 49ers in Anaheim
Stadium. "They said keep the
federal government out of it ...
But something's wrong when a
fighter can get knocked out in
New Jersey then fight in Las
Vegas a week later."
Cosell worked last week's
World Boxing Council heavy
weight title light in which cham
pion Larrv Holmes pummeled
challenger Randv "Tex" Cobb
for 15 rounds. Cosell repeatedly
wondered aloud why the fight
wasn't being stopped and, at var
ious times, called it "brutal ...
savagery ... outrageous."
