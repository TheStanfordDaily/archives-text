# Adviser/student policy imposed to forestall conflicts of interest
## 
### KATHY CHRISTIE Staff writer 
Faculty advisers are banned from hiring their student ad
visees for outside work without prior approval as a result of
a policy change made yesterday.
The Faculty Consulting Policy, as amended by the Facul
ty Senate in a divided vote, now requires students doing out
side work for their advisers or members of their dissertation
committees to get approval from the department chairman.
If the involved faculty member is the department chairman,
approval must come from the dean.
The Committee on Research proposed the addition to the
current consulting policy because "questions were raised
about the ability of faculty members in such situations to
separate their University teaching obligations to their stu
dents from the priorities and obligations of their outside
consulting activities."
In supporting the modification. Vice Provost Gerald
Lieberman said, "The thing that swayed me is that students
are very vulnerable. If they're unhappy, they really have very
little recourse." Lieberman is also dean of graduate studies
and research.
William Smith, representing the Graduate Student As
sociation (GSA), told the senate that some GSA members
feared they would lose their jobs with professors if the mod
ification were passed.

"We know of only one solid case where students have had
problems," Smith said, questioning whether enough a prob
lem existed to merit the modifications.
However, Smith said GSA does support the new mod
ifications. "We think that the policy is needed," he said last
night. "People need to look into it a bit more." Smith also
said that he believes the faculty senate should consider the
major problem, which he described as observing faculty con
sulting.
Mathematics and Mechanical Engineering Prof. Joseph
Keller, chairman of the Committee on Research, said that
the evidence of problems is "not so strong," and mainly con
sisted of secondhand evidence from the Ombudsman and
students on the committee. He also said that with the "es
cape clause," the proposal ought to be acceptable to Ihe
GSA.
"I know of several cases in this University which are really
a problem and this would help," said Mechanical Engineer
ing Prof. Bernard Roth. He also said that many faculty
members do not know the guidelines, and that he wondered
that even if the modification passed "how the deans would
handle it."
"I think that every consulting job I've done this year I've
done in violation of University regulations," Roth added.
The effectiveness of the modification was questioned by
