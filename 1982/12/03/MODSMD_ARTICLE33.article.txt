Trying to find a parking space
at the Stanford Shopping Center
the day after Thanksgiving, dur
ing the first day of Christmas
shopping, takes a lot of patience
and endurance. Once you do find
a parking space, you know that
you can work off all those
calories that you had consumed
at dinner just by walking back to
the car.
We dined at Gaylord India
Restaurant at the Stanford Shop
ping Center. Other Gaylords are
located in New Delhi, Bombay,
London and San Francisco, in
Ghirardelli Square. Gaylord's
specialty is tandoor cookery, a

Gay lord's specialty is tandoor cookery, a
centuries-old north Indian technique using
deep clay ovens. Meats, poultry and
seafood are marinated for hours in special
spices, then cooked quickly over white hot
charcoal. The result is a dish of marvelous
flavor and succulence.

As you enter Gaylord india
Restaurant, you are pleasantly
greeted with soft Indian music
and potted palms located in the
entrance hall. Hung on the wall
are painted Indian procession
scenes on material. The floor has
plush carpeting; the lighting is
soft but bright enough to allow
patrons to take in the flavor of
the room. One of the walls is cov
ered from ceiling to the top of the
bench with a mirror so that those
seated facing the wall can watch
the activity in the room.
jL We had made reservations for
16 p.m. and found that there were
I only two other couples in the First
; dining room and a group of peo
ple in the other dining room. In
the second dining room there is a

window from which you watch
them cook the food in the clay
ovens.
As the evening progressed,
more people arrived and we
found that the restaurant started
to fill around 7 p.m. (Reserva
tions are recommended.) Once
we were seated, we found that the
atmosphere was one of simple
elegance. The music was loud
enough to enjoy but quiet enough
to have private conversa
tions without having to raise
your voice to be heard. The table
setting was simple stemware and
silverware; candles located on all
the tables gave Gaylord a nice
warm atmosphere. The service
was attentive, efficient and
courteous.
After studying the menu
carefully, my dinner partner
Olivia decided on the Majarani
Special (S18) and I decided on the

Maharaja Special ($2O). These
two specials gave us a variety of
dishes to sample. With the din
ners we ordered a glass of the
house wine ($2.50 a glass) which
was the Stoney Brook Chablis.
This wine is light and comple
ments the spiciness of the dif
ferent dishes without overpower
ing the flavors.
The Maharani Special con
sisted of: Chicken Korma, Lamb
Sagwala, Navrattan Vegetables,
Kashmiri Pillau Rice and Onion
Kulcha. The Maharaja Special
included: Seekh Kabob, Chicken
Tekka Kabob, Nan, Matter Pan
eer, Kashmiri Pillau Rice, Tan
doori Chicken and Booti Kabob.
Both came with a choice of soup
and dessert, and tea or coffee.
I chose the Dal soup which is a
spicy lentil soup garnished with
peas, potatoes and green beans
cut into small pieces. The taste if
very faint but if you squeeze some

of the lemon that they serve with
the soup, you'll find that the
flavor is brought out. (So, if you
want a stronger flavor, you just
add more lemon.)
Olivia had the Mulligatawny
soup which is a delicately spiced
lentil soup in a cream base with

rice and chicken. Again if you
want a strong flavor you would
add the lemon that is served with
it.
Because the names of the dish
es probably don't mean much to
you, I'll try to explain what each
course consisted of. The Seekh

Kabob is minced with onions,
herbs and spices.then roasted in
skewers in the clay pit. This dish
is very spicy, as a hot curry is
used. Boneless chicken pieces
marinated and roasted on
skewers in the clay pit make up
the Chicken Tekka Kabob. This
has a nice roasted flavor with just

a hint of curry and is delicious.
Nan is a leaven bread that is
freshly oven baked and has the
texture of a flour tortilla but at
the same time the taste of bread.
The Onion Kulcha is Nan but is
is stuffed with onions. For all you
onion lovers out there this is a
pure delight.

This is the same Gaylord known to world
travelers in New Dehli, Bombay, London,
and other great cities, where the Gaylord
name is synonymous with the finest in
Indian cuisine, served with true Indian
hospitality.
Gaylord's

Cubes of Indian farmers'
cheese and green peas cooked in a
spiced gravy make up the Matter
Paneer. The cheese is very mild
and this gives the gravy a chance
to make itself known. Kashmiri
Pillau Rice is a saffron rice
cooked with fresh vegetables,
peas and nuts (cashews). The rice
is very lightly seasoned and gives
you a change of taste from the
spices and curry seasonings. Tan
doori Chicken is marinated in
yogurt then roasted on skewers in
the clay pit. It tends to be spicy
and moist. Booti Kabob is cubed
leg of lamb roasted on skewers
and mildly spiced. This lamb dish
is very mild compared to the
Seekh Kabob but its mild season-

You are invited to partake of a memorable
dining or lunchtime experience at San
Franciso's (and now Stanford's) newest and
most authentic Indian restaurant —
Gay lord oflndia.
Gaylord's

ings give it a flavor different from
the other highly spiced lamb dish.
The servings are hearty and if you
have a lighter appetite, you can
select from the a la carte menu.
For dessert we chose two items
from a car they wheeled to our
table. Olivia chose the Kulfi
Faluda which is an Indian ice
cream with fiisttfchios and
almonds. Her second choice was
a fried cheese ball. I chose the
Rasmalai which is a creamy Indi
an delight and my second choice

was a different type of fried
cheese ball.
We had expected the Kulfi
Faluds to be like regular ice
cream, cold and frosty. Instead, it
was made of milk, sugar,
pistachios and almonds which
was mixed together and then
poured into a pan to harden. It is

cut into small squares before
being served. The Rasmalai,
made of milk, sugar and coconut,
was served the same way.
The fried cheese balls are made
of two different types of cheeses
which are surrounded in dough
then fried. They have a cake-type
quality and are very light tasting
but do not have that greasy taste
associated with fried foods. To
complement the desserts, Olivia
had the Indian coffee Mosios. It
i$ a flavorful full-bodied coffee
but is not strong or overpower
ing. Since I am not a coffee
drinker, I chose the darjeeling
tea. The tea was steeped to the
right strength and tasted good
with the desserts.

The average price at Gaylord
India is between $15 and $18.
Our total bill, including tax and
tip, came out to be $52.23 for the
two of us. It is in the expensive
range but if you want to explore
the wonders of Indian food and
also want to splurge on yourself,
we highly recommend Gaylord
India' Restaurant.
