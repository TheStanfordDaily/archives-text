As someone whose tastes run
the gamut from pizza to
cheeseburgers, and whose idea of
coherent food criticism is "Ma,
there are lumps in the mashed
potatoes!" it was not without a
few qualms that I accepted the as
signment to review the Nataraja,
a local Indian food restaurant.
The Nataraja is located right
off University Avenue, on the left
just after you come through the
underpass, and is connected to
Rudyard's pub, which fronts
University. We arrived five
minutes early for our reservation,
and we were promptly seated —
near the door, unfortunately.
However, we were moved
without fuss to better seats.
The interior of the restaurant is
starkly white, the whitewashed
walls covered in places with Indi
an artworks. There was back
ground music from hidden
speakers, playing traditional — if
unfamilar, to Westerners — Indi
an music. The lighting was pro

vided bv hanging lanterns, which
gave most of their illumination
indirectly. As a result, it was fair
ly dim inside, and a bit of a
challenge to read the menu.
We decided to order the
Chicken Masala dinner ($10.75)

From snatches of
conversation we
overheard it seemed
as if it were some
kind of macho
challenge to order hot
curry, along the lines
of' Simon Says' or
'Follow the Leader.'

and the Korma Rampuri, a lamb
dish ($8.75). While we were wait
ing for our entrees, we were
brought some Poori ($2.25),
which is deep-fried unleavened
bread. Crisp and tastv, it had a
sweet, almost buttery taste which
proved to be a fine appetizer.

The Mulligatawny soup
($2.05, included with dinner) ar
rived next, billed in the menu as a
"zappv" soup. It was good, but
I'd prefer to reserve "zappy" for
other things. The soup came in a
wide, shallow bowl with a chunk
of lemon drifting in the center of
the bowl. The soup was pungent
without being overpowering, and
the lemon added a nice overtone
to the soup.
We shared the soup, as we did
the Pakora ($3.25), which arrived
next. Sliced vegetables, dipped in
batter and fried in vegetable oil, it
came piping hot to the table and
accompanied by three types of
chutney; a sweet raisin chutney, a
medium greens and a hot garlic.
Aside note is in order here. Al
though the restaurant was nearly
empty when we arrived, by this
time it had become almost entire
ly full. From snatches of con
versation we overheard it seemed
as if it were some kind of macho
challenge to order hot curry,
along the lines of "Simon Says"
or "Follow the Leader." For my
part I was glad that I had had the
