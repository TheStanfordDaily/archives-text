As someone whose tastes run
the gamut from pizza to
cheeseburgers, and whose idea of
coherent food criticism is "Ma,
there are lumps in the mashed
potatoes!" it was not without a
few qualms that I accepted the as
signment to review the Nataraja,
a local Indian food restaurant.
The Nataraja is located right
off University Avenue, on the left
just after you come through the
underpass, and is connected to
Rudyard's pub, which fronts
University. We arrived five
minutes early for our reservation,
and we were promptly seated —
near the door, unfortunately.
However, we were moved
without fuss to better seats.
The interior of the restaurant is
starkly white, the whitewashed
walls covered in places with Indi
an artworks. There was back
ground music from hidden
speakers, playing traditional — if
unfamilar, to Westerners — Indi
an music. The lighting was pro

vided bv hanging lanterns, which
gave most of their illumination
indirectly. As a result, it was fair
ly dim inside, and a bit of a
challenge to read the menu.
We decided to order the
Chicken Masala dinner ($10.75)

conversation we
overheard it seemed
as if it were some

'Follow the Leader.'

and the Korma Rampuri, a lamb
dish ($8.75). While we were wait
ing for our entrees, we were
brought some Poori ($2.25),
which is deep-fried unleavened
bread. Crisp and tastv, it had a
sweet, almost buttery taste which
proved to be a fine appetizer.

The Mulligatawny soup
($2.05, included with dinner) ar
rived next, billed in the menu as a
"zappv" soup. It was good, but
I'd prefer to reserve "zappy" for
other things. The soup came in a
wide, shallow bowl with a chunk
of lemon drifting in the center of
the bowl. The soup was pungent
without being overpowering, and
the lemon added a nice overtone
to the soup.
We shared the soup, as we did
the Pakora ($3.25), which arrived
next. Sliced vegetables, dipped in
batter and fried in vegetable oil, it
came piping hot to the table and
accompanied by three types of
chutney; a sweet raisin chutney, a
medium greens and a hot garlic.
Aside note is in order here. Al
though the restaurant was nearly
empty when we arrived, by this
time it had become almost entire
ly full. From snatches of con
versation we overheard it seemed
as if it were some kind of macho
challenge to order hot curry,
along the lines of "Simon Says"
or "Follow the Leader." For my
part I was glad that I had had the

intestinal fortitude to order my
curry at least medium-spiced.
For the chutneys, suffice to say
for the garlic that it was indeed
hot, and the raisin was sweet, but
the greens came off the best, cool
but still tasty. The Pakora, in its
crisp, flaky crust, came in egg
plant, potato and a mixed variety
with bell peppers and spinach
predominant. My companion
found the eggplant most to her
liking, and I swore bv the potato,
sad to say. As they cooled, how
ever, they both seemed a little
greasy, and it was the mixed vari
ety that came off the best.
We then ordered some tea, to
rest our palates after the vari
egated tastes that had swept over
them. Their tea ($.70), a private
Darjeeling blend, came in a
plastic mug and smelled strongly
of cinnamon. It seemed a little
bland after the chutneys, but was
quite well-recieved.
Our entrees came soon after —
the service was quite good, even
after the restaurant had filled to

capacity, and it was surprising to
realize that only two waiters were
working the floor. The chicken
Masala, which came adrift in
curry and atop Chapati bread,
was very tender, almost to the
point of falling apart. The curry
and the chicken complemented
each other very well, and the me
dium currv, I am pleased to say,

achieved the outer limits of my
taste, but never went past those
boundries.
My companion found the
Korma Rampuri a little too
sweet, the sauce overpowering
the lamb, raisins and cashews in
the dish. We both had plenty to

eat, our portions being more than
sufficient, and there was also a
bowl of lentil soup, a delicate
flavor accentuated with a touch
of cream.
The tea, which I reluctantly al
lowed myself to sweeten, was
almost a relief for the strong taste
of the Masala, sort of an antidote
to the dinner allowing me to keep

the dinner in bounds.
At the end of our meal we were
brought a cube of Kaju Halawa
($1.75, included with dinner), a
sweet block of raisins and
cashews. This ethnic Snickers bar
made us feel a little pandered to,
after we had stoutly pressed forth

in our best proto-lndian fashion,
but it was a nice snack.
When we got our bill, we were
presented with a plate half of sug
ar and half of licorice seeds, and
instructed to grab a pinch of each
and chew. It was tasty, but once
again I couldn't help but think of
Good 'n Plenties.
Mavbe that's the best way to
deal with a meal like that, after
all. Trv to open yourself to some
new dishes and drop some of
your prejudices, give everything a
chance, and remember, if some
thing goes wrong, that there are
things in your own cooking that
you might not be too fond of.
(Hev, want some country fried
steak'/)
The Nataraja, then, is a fine
place to start. The prices are
slightly better than reasonable,
the service is prompt and the
food is attractive. It may not be
Ramona's, and it definitely isn't
Jack in the Box, but if you'll put
some prejudices aside for a night,
it's a very good place to have din
ner.
