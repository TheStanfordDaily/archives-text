The 39 Steps (1935) ★
Festival, Palo Alto
Alfred Hitchcock filmed the
John Buchan novel (as adapted
bv Charles Bennett and Alma Re
ville) in the mid-'3os, and though
there have been two versions
since, no one has taken much no
tice of them. Robert Donat, the
most debonair and best spoken
hero of Hitchcock's British peri
od, plays the innocent who gets
involved in a spy plot — and is
handcuffed to gorgeous, blonde
Madeleine Carroll. This movie
contains one of the few poignant
scenes in any Hitchcock picture: a
brief study of an unhappy mar
riage. (Peggy Ashcroft and John
Laurie play the couple.) With
Godfrey Tearle, Wylie Watson,
Helen Have and Frank Collier.
The 39 Steps contains the blue
prints of many of the thrillers
Hitchcock was to make over the
next 25 years (notably Foreign
Correspondent and North by
Northwest).
Plays through Wednesday with
The Lady Vanishes.
My Favorite Year ★
Park,Menlo Park
Peter O'Toole's portrayal of
Alan Swann, an Errol Flynn type
notorious for his drunken and
amorous hijinks, begins with the
longest, thinnest wheeze you've
ever heard and expands from
there. His brilliant performance is
one-half John Barrvmore and
one-half Noel Coward — a full
length theatrical send-up, the best
moments of which occur when
he's standing perfectly still. He
provides the ideal contrast to all
the uproarious nervous activity in
this picture, which is set in the
days of live TV comedy. Norman
Steinberg and Dennis Palumbo
wrote the script, which at its best
suggests the Comden and Green
of Singin' in the Rain, and Rich
ard Benjamin, on his first time
out, directed in a wacky, hyper
bolic style. It's an immensely
likable movie, with estimable
contributions from Joseph
Bologna, Bill Macy, Lainie
Kazan, Cameron Mitchell, Selma
Diamond and, as the junior com
edy writer who worships Swann
and is assigned to keep him out of
trouble, Mark Linn-Baker, a tal
ented young comic with a rubbery
baby face.
An Officer and a Gentleman
Fine Arts, Palo Alto
Douglas Day Stewart's
screenplay treats the
metamorphosis of a selfish loner,
Zack Mavo (Richard Gere), in
the course of a naval officer train
ing program in Seattle. It's lucky
for the movie that Debra Winger
plays Zack's girl friend, David
Keith his best buddy, and Lou
Gossett the drill instructor, be
cause they all work hard to per
suade audiences that what they're
seeing is fresh. It isn't; what lies
beneath the film's warm, lively
surface is nothing but old movies.
Worth seeing chiefly for Debra
Winger's authentic performance,
which furnishes a striking con
trast to Richard Gere's slick ac
torishness.

The Lady Vanishes (1938) ★
Festival, Palo Alto
The funniest of Alfred
Hitchcock's British movies:
Dame May Whitty chats to
Margaret Lockwood in the dining
car of a train, then disappears;
Lockwood seeks assistance in fin
ding her lost friend, but no one be
lieves in Whittv's existence — ex
cept for the dashing hero,
Michael Redgrave. The spy story
has dash, too. Sidney Gilliat and
Frank Launder adapted a novel
by Ethel Lina White, and Paul
Lukas, Basil Radford, Naunton
Wayne, Googie Withes and oth
ers turn up on the train in sup
porting roles. A delight.
Plays through Wednesday with
The 39 Steps.
Smash Palace ★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
In this first-rate New Zealand
film, scripted and directed by
Roger Donaldson, two decent
married people (Bruno Lawrence
and Anna Jemison) split up after
nearly a decade. She is better
educated and finds their
backwater existence stifling; his
response to the sour notes in their
marriage is to plunge himself into
his work and to allow himself to
drift toward virtual inertia in his
relationship with her. When we
see them in bed together, their
love play has a desperate ferocity,
a violence that is simultaneously
exciting and frightening. Bruno
Lawrence demonstrates the kind
of intensity we might expect from
Al Pacino or Dustin Hoffman or
Sean Connery, and his scenes
with Greer Robson, as his seven
year-old daughter, somehow
combine great sweetness and ter
ror.
Plays Tuesdav and Wednesday
with Picnic at Hanging Rock.

Robert Towne, who wrote,
directed and produced this film
about the coming of age of a ris
ing pentathlete, has conceived it
entirely in terms of body lan
guage. Dialogue is only impor
tant for narrative purposes and in
order to complement the action;
Towne is not interested in what
the characters say to each other,
but in what their legs and shoul
ders and torsos say, and — partic
ularly since he is dealing with ath
letes — we are continually
astonished at how eloquent the
bodies are. Personal Best deals
with the expenditure of physical
and emotional energy, and the
search for a delicate balance be
tween friendship and competitive
drive. Mariel Hemingway and
Scott Glenn, who are professional
actors, and Patrice Donnelly and
Kenny Moore, who are pro
fessional athletes, give absolutely
consistent, naturalistic per
formances, and all the physical
connections between them, in
cluding the sexual ones, are
gloriously free of self-conscious
ness.

The 39 Steps (1935) ★
Festival, Palo Alto
Alfred Hitchcock filmed the
John Buchan novel (as adapted
bv Charles Bennett and Alma Re
ville) in the mid-'3os, and though
there have been two versions
since, no one has taken much no
tice of them. Robert Donat, the
most debonair and best spoken
hero of Hitchcock's British peri
od, plays the innocent who gets
involved in a spy plot — and is
handcuffed to gorgeous, blonde
Madeleine Carroll. This movie
contains one of the few poignant
scenes in any Hitchcock picture: a
brief study of an unhappy mar
riage. (Peggy Ashcroft and John
Laurie play the couple.) With
Godfrey Tearle, Wylie Watson,
Helen Have and Frank Collier.
The 39 Steps contains the blue
prints of many of the thrillers
Hitchcock was to make over the
next 25 years (notably Foreign
Correspondent and North by
Northwest).
Plays through Wednesday with
The Lady Vanishes.

Peter O'Toole's portrayal of
Alan Swann, an Errol Flynn type
notorious for his drunken and
amorous hijinks, begins with the
longest, thinnest wheeze you've
ever heard and expands from
there. His brilliant performance is
one-half John Barrvmore and
one-half Noel Coward — a full
length theatrical send-up, the best
moments of which occur when
he's standing perfectly still. He
provides the ideal contrast to all
the uproarious nervous activity in
this picture, which is set in the
days of live TV comedy. Norman
Steinberg and Dennis Palumbo
wrote the script, which at its best
suggests the Comden and Green
of Singin' in the Rain, and Rich
ard Benjamin, on his first time
out, directed in a wacky, hyper
bolic style. It's an immensely
likable movie, with estimable
contributions from Joseph
Bologna, Bill Macy, Lainie
Kazan, Cameron Mitchell, Selma
Diamond and, as the junior com
edy writer who worships Swann
and is assigned to keep him out of
trouble, Mark Linn-Baker, a tal
ented young comic with a rubbery
baby face.

Fine Arts, Palo Alto
Douglas Day Stewart's
screenplay treats the
metamorphosis of a selfish loner,
Zack Mavo (Richard Gere), in
the course of a naval officer train
ing program in Seattle. It's lucky
for the movie that Debra Winger
plays Zack's girl friend, David
Keith his best buddy, and Lou
Gossett the drill instructor, be
cause they all work hard to per
suade audiences that what they're
seeing is fresh. It isn't; what lies
beneath the film's warm, lively
surface is nothing but old movies.
Worth seeing chiefly for Debra
Winger's authentic performance,
which furnishes a striking con
trast to Richard Gere's slick ac
torishness.

The Lady Vanishes (1938) ★
Festival, Palo Alto
The funniest of Alfred
Hitchcock's British movies:
Dame May Whitty chats to
Margaret Lockwood in the dining
car of a train, then disappears;
Lockwood seeks assistance in fin
ding her lost friend, but no one be
lieves in Whittv's existence — ex
cept for the dashing hero,
Michael Redgrave. The spy story
has dash, too. Sidney Gilliat and
Frank Launder adapted a novel
by Ethel Lina White, and Paul
Lukas, Basil Radford, Naunton
Wayne, Googie Withes and oth
ers turn up on the train in sup
porting roles. A delight.
Plays through Wednesday with

Smash Palace ★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
In this first-rate New Zealand
film, scripted and directed by
Roger Donaldson, two decent
married people (Bruno Lawrence
and Anna Jemison) split up after
nearly a decade. She is better
educated and finds their
backwater existence stifling; his
response to the sour notes in their
marriage is to plunge himself into
his work and to allow himself to
drift toward virtual inertia in his
relationship with her. When we
see them in bed together, their
love play has a desperate ferocity,
a violence that is simultaneously
exciting and frightening. Bruno
Lawrence demonstrates the kind
of intensity we might expect from
Al Pacino or Dustin Hoffman or
Sean Connery, and his scenes
with Greer Robson, as his seven
year-old daughter, somehow
combine great sweetness and ter
ror.
Plays Tuesdav and Wednesday

Robert Towne, who wrote,
directed and produced this film
about the coming of age of a ris

entirely in terms of body lan

order to complement the action;
Towne is not interested in what
the characters say to each other,

with the expenditure of physical

The 39 Steps (1935) ★
Festival, Palo Alto
Alfred Hitchcock filmed the
John Buchan novel (as adapted
bv Charles Bennett and Alma Re
ville) in the mid-'3os, and though
there have been two versions
since, no one has taken much no
tice of them. Robert Donat, the
most debonair and best spoken
hero of Hitchcock's British peri
od, plays the innocent who gets
involved in a spy plot — and is
handcuffed to gorgeous, blonde
Madeleine Carroll. This movie
contains one of the few poignant
scenes in any Hitchcock picture: a
brief study of an unhappy mar
riage. (Peggy Ashcroft and John
Laurie play the couple.) With
Godfrey Tearle, Wylie Watson,
Helen Have and Frank Collier.
The 39 Steps contains the blue
prints of many of the thrillers
Hitchcock was to make over the
next 25 years (notably Foreign
Correspondent and North by
Northwest).
Plays through Wednesday with
The Lady Vanishes.

Peter O'Toole's portrayal of
Alan Swann, an Errol Flynn type
notorious for his drunken and
amorous hijinks, begins with the
longest, thinnest wheeze you've
ever heard and expands from
there. His brilliant performance is
one-half John Barrvmore and
one-half Noel Coward — a full
length theatrical send-up, the best
moments of which occur when
he's standing perfectly still. He
provides the ideal contrast to all
the uproarious nervous activity in
this picture, which is set in the
days of live TV comedy. Norman
Steinberg and Dennis Palumbo
wrote the script, which at its best
suggests the Comden and Green
of Singin' in the Rain, and Rich
ard Benjamin, on his first time
out, directed in a wacky, hyper
bolic style. It's an immensely
likable movie, with estimable
contributions from Joseph
Bologna, Bill Macy, Lainie
Kazan, Cameron Mitchell, Selma
Diamond and, as the junior com
edy writer who worships Swann
and is assigned to keep him out of
trouble, Mark Linn-Baker, a tal
ented young comic with a rubbery
baby face.

Fine Arts, Palo Alto
Douglas Day Stewart's
screenplay treats the
metamorphosis of a selfish loner,
Zack Mavo (Richard Gere), in
the course of a naval officer train
ing program in Seattle. It's lucky
for the movie that Debra Winger
plays Zack's girl friend, David
Keith his best buddy, and Lou
Gossett the drill instructor, be
cause they all work hard to per
suade audiences that what they're
seeing is fresh. It isn't; what lies
beneath the film's warm, lively
surface is nothing but old movies.
Worth seeing chiefly for Debra
Winger's authentic performance,
which furnishes a striking con
trast to Richard Gere's slick ac
torishness.

The Lady Vanishes (1938) ★
Festival, Palo Alto
The funniest of Alfred
Hitchcock's British movies:
Dame May Whitty chats to
Margaret Lockwood in the dining
car of a train, then disappears;
Lockwood seeks assistance in fin
ding her lost friend, but no one be
lieves in Whittv's existence — ex
cept for the dashing hero,
Michael Redgrave. The spy story
has dash, too. Sidney Gilliat and
Frank Launder adapted a novel
by Ethel Lina White, and Paul
Lukas, Basil Radford, Naunton
Wayne, Googie Withes and oth
ers turn up on the train in sup
porting roles. A delight.

Smash Palace ★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
In this first-rate New Zealand
film, scripted and directed by
Roger Donaldson, two decent
married people (Bruno Lawrence
and Anna Jemison) split up after
nearly a decade. She is better
educated and finds their
backwater existence stifling; his
response to the sour notes in their
marriage is to plunge himself into
his work and to allow himself to
drift toward virtual inertia in his
relationship with her. When we
see them in bed together, their
love play has a desperate ferocity,
a violence that is simultaneously
exciting and frightening. Bruno
Lawrence demonstrates the kind
of intensity we might expect from
Al Pacino or Dustin Hoffman or
Sean Connery, and his scenes
with Greer Robson, as his seven
year-old daughter, somehow
combine great sweetness and ter
ror.
Plays Tuesdav and Wednesday

Robert Towne, who wrote,

about the coming of age of a ris

entirely in terms of body lan

Towne is not interested in what
the characters say to each other,

with the expenditure of physical
