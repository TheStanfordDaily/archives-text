Happy hour
As the quarter's end draws near, so do those wicked finals we
fear. So come to the Daily about five, to learn just how to survive.
Our own special treat, it's all quite complete, and there's even
more than plain beer.
Banquet
King Richard is inviting all staffers — that includes old and
new — to the Chart House Restaurant in Montara, that's M-O-
N-T-A-R-A ... for a certain editor's information. It's set for
Thurs. Dec. 9 — a special banquet happy hour starts at 5 p.m.
and a bus will take all from the offices. Don't miss it;
spaces are running out. Sign up on the editor's door today. Even
two particularly picky Daily food connoisseurs gave this place a
•good review. (Yes, that's C-O-N-N-O-I-S-S-E-U-R-S!)
Dead Week
Paste-up for Dead Week issue will be on Mon. Dec. 6. Edi
tors will find pages in their boxes.
Election
Editorial candidates are Bill Ainsworth, Mike Hale, Douglas
Jehl and Karen Springen. Election on Jan. 6 following a grill ses
sion. Run-off if necessary will be Jan. 10.
