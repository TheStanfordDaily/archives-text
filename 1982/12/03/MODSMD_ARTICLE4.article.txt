# Police crack down on parking tickets
## 
### ELISE CHAPIN 
The Santa Clara County Sheriffs Of
fice will begin serving arrest warrants
Jan. I on drivers with more than
five unpaid parking tickets.
The action may affect as many as 40
Stanford drivers who owe more than
$1000 in parking fines, including one
offender who owes the county $5200.
Concerned about the loss of revenue
to the county, the crackdown will be
aimed at "habitual offenders," said
Rich Atkinson, county director of rev
enue. "It is disgusting to take a look and
see how blatant people are in their park
ing attitudes," Atkinson said.
The county will not begin the
qrackdown on driver* v*iVtX..«T»Qre than
$1000 in unpaid citations until January
because of a legal complication that
prohibits arrest warrants when drivers'
auto registrations are "on hold."
Presently, a registration is put on

hold if the car has received five tickets in
the past year. The owner is not allowed
to reregister the car until the outstand
ing fines have been paid. Although ori
ginal parking tickets cost $7, owners
must pay $30 for each fine after their
registrations have been put on hold.
Of the 300,000 parking tickets issued
each year in the county, University em
ployees and students account for more
than 50,000 citations.
The Santa Clara Sheriffs Office
tickets Stanford drivers because it is re
sponsible for all of the unincorporated
areas of the county.
Because each incorpoated city can
form its own policy, the new sheriffs
policy applies only to county areas.
Jill Nickson, the California regional
manager for DATACOM Systems,
Inc., which serves as the Department of
Parking Violations, said that the system
of putting registrations on hold at the

Division of Motor Vehicles in Sacra
mento has become more efficient re
cently. Because DATACOM is con
nected to a national network, the de
partment now is able to trace out-of
state drivers as well as Californians, she
said.
Most people would rather pay the
fines than have their registration put on
hold, Nickson said. However, an of
fender who has "a beat-up old Honda"
may decide that the cost of the ac
cumulated fines is not worth the cost of
the car, and will not renew the regis
tration, she said. But these drivers face a
different fine for non-registration.
She said about 50 percent of offen
ders pay their Tines within 30 days. An
other 25 percent pay when they are
mailed a reminder. Most of the remain
ing violators pay when they find that
they cannot reregister their cars until
they do so.
