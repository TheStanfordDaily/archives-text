A new study and internship program at the University's
Berlin campus is offering a reduced language requirement to
make it easier for science and engineering students to spend

This quarter, the 13 engineering students now in Berlin are
studying German language, politics, history and culture.
Next quarter, they will stop out of school and go to work for
private West German firms in Cologne, Stuttgart, Ham
