# Language requirement revised
## Berlin offers internships for engineers 
### JULIE KAUFMANN Staff writer 
A new study and internship program at the University's
Berlin campus is offering a reduced language requirement to
make it easier for science and engineering students to spend
two quarters overseas.
This quarter, the 13 engineering students now in Berlin are
studying German language, politics, history and culture.
Next quarter, they will stop out of school and go to work for
private West German firms in Cologne, Stuttgart, Ham
burg, Munich and other cities, according to Beth Soltis of
the Overseas Studies Office.
The three-month internships are open to engineering,
math and science students and provide a monthly salary.

The German Academic Exchange Service helps interns ar
range work permits and visas.
The program requires at least one quarter of German lan
guage study prior to departure. Once in Berlin, students take
an intensive German course worth 10 units.
A pamphlet published by Overseas Studies cautions that
students with more German may receive priority in in
ternship assignments. One quarter of German class, "is a
minimum requirement. It is preferred that students have
more," Soltis said.
Because of their heavy load of required courses, engineer
ing students have traditionally had difficulty finding time to
take the two quarters of language study
necessary for admission to the Univer
sity's other overseas centers. The two
quarter requirement applies to students
at the Berlin center who are not in the
internship program.
Soltis said her office has received
"numerous inquiries and extremely fa
vorable response" about the program,
which will continue to run fall and win
ter quarters next year.
The internships are arranged by the
Stanford Alumni Club in Germany and
the Krupp Foundation. The founda
tion contributed 200,000 deutchmarks,
about $90,000, to cover the program's
administrative costs this year, Soltis
said.
Overseas Studies is now exploring the
future possiblity ofoffering non-techni
cal internships in Berlin, Soltis said, but
intern programs at other overseas cen
ters are not currently feasible. "Germa
ny seems to be the only country that's
interested. German industry is very
concerned about their image abroad."
Participating companies see the in
ternships as good public relations, she
said. "They want good links with up
and-coming U.S. leaders."
The Alumni Club in Germany has
been raising money for the Berlin center
since 1980, when "t6 keep the center
going we had to go to fundraising,"
Soltis said.
