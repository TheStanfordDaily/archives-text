# Burglary victims begin to identify property, but retrieval may take more than one year
## 
### KAREN SPRINGEN 
Police have recovered more than 700
calls from professed victims seeking to
recover an estimated $2 million in prop
erty stolen in the last four years. But
suspect Robert O'Connor, 39, com
mitted no more than 300 burglaries, ac
cording to Stanford Police Capt. Raoul
Niemever.

"I was like a kid in a toy shop," said
burglary victim Juthica Stangl, describ
ing her two visits last week to police sta
tion trailers filled with recovered goods
such as fur coats, seashells, shoes,
canned green beans, guns, cameras,
toys, china and jewelry.
"It looks like the San Jose flea mar
ket," she said.

Stangl, who!«. home on 1028 Vernier
Place was burglarized Oct. 8, said she
found almost 75 percent of her family's
stolen property in the two 50-foot
trailers. "I found some things that I
didn't even know were stolen," she said.
She identified goods, such as saris, an
antique silver sword and an antique
chest, which police officers then tagged
without questioning her, Stangl said. "I
guess they took our word for it," she
said.
Other victims were less fortunate in
finding their stolen property. Stangl
said she "almost felt guilty" because a
neighbor, who was also robbed, found
only two items.
Victims will be unable to claim their
goods — recovered by police from the
residence of Robert and Maureen
O'Connor in La Honda, a friend's
house in Montara and rented storage
rooms in Foster City — until the judge
releases the property, according to
Stanford Police Chief Marvin Her
rington. As a result, recovering the
goods may take six months to a year.
In attempt to keep the identification
process organized, police are requiring
victims to call for a police-supervised
appointment to view the recovered
goods. Stangl called seven times before
receiving an appointment, she said.
Appointments are a maximum oftwo
hours although "it would take two
days" to go through all the goods,
Stanglsaid.
She plans to make a third appoint

ment for next week after the collection
has thinned out, she said.
Victims must bring a copy of the po
lice report filed at the time of their prop
erty loss.
Stangl speculated that the burglar,
who apparently kept most of the goods,
was not as interested in the money as in
the idea of stealing
"He was doing it for the money plus
the feeling . . . just the idea that no one
could catch him," Stangl said.
"The burglar had a bit of a junk
fetish," said Detective Lee Lera of the
Los Altos Police Department.
"We were laughing at the things he
took," Stangl said. For example, the
collection of stolen goods included junk
and even socks. "How do you know
some of that stuff doesn't really belong
to him (the burglar)?" she joked.
"I don't think he had any idea what
he was stealing . . . There is some really
valuable stuff and then there is some
real junk," Stangl said. From her house
the burglar took polyester rather than
silk scarves, a old, chipped teapot and
an old slip. "I wouldn't even use that
(the slip) to mop my floor," she said.
"All the jewelry was kind of thrown
together . . . the police officers are not
jewelers," Stangl said. A piece of junk
jewelry was in the same pile as her $600
pearl necklace, she said.
"I tell you it was an incredible ex
perience to walk through the trailers
and see all my saris stacked up," she
said.

could catch him," Stangl said.
"The burglar had a bit of a junk
fetish," said Detective Lee Lera of the
Los Altos Police Department.
"We were laughing at the things he
took," Stangl said. For example, the
collection of stolen goods included junk
and even socks. "How do you know
some of that stuff doesn't really belong
to him (the burglar)?" she joked.
"I don't think he had any idea what
he was stealing . . . There is some really
valuable stuff and then there is some
real junk," Stangl said. From her house
the burglar took polyester rather than
silk scarves, a old, chipped teapot and
an old slip. "I wouldn't even use that
(the slip) to mop my floor," she said.
"All the jewelry was kind of thrown
together . . . the police officers are not
jewelers," Stangl said. A piece of junk
jewelry was in the same pile as her $600
pearl necklace, she said.
"I tell you it was an incredible ex
perience to walk through the trailers
and see all my saris stacked up," she
said.

LOTS OF LOOT: Stanford Police have received more than 700 calls from
people interested in claiming their stolen goods in the two 50-foot trailers
parked behind the police station. The guarded trailers house more than $2
million in goods police believe to have been stolen in 300 Mid-Peninsula bur
glaries during the past two years. Tours for burglary victims are arranged
by appointment only. Police expect the entire matching process to take
about six weeks.
Police have recovered more than 700
calls from professed victims seeking to
recover an estimated $2 million in prop
erty stolen in the last four years. But
suspect Robert O'Connor, 39, com
mitted no more than 300 burglaries, ac
cording to Stanford Police Capt. Raoul
Niemever.

"I was like a kid in a toy shop," said
burglary victim Juthica Stangl, describ
ing her two visits last week to police sta
tion trailers filled with recovered goods
such as fur coats, seashells, shoes,
canned green beans, guns, cameras,
toys, china and jewelry.
"It looks like the San Jose flea mar
ket," she said.

Stangl, who!«. home on 1028 Vernier
Place was burglarized Oct. 8, said she
found almost 75 percent of her family's
stolen property in the two 50-foot
trailers. "I found some things that I
didn't even know were stolen," she said.
She identified goods, such as saris, an
antique silver sword and an antique
chest, which police officers then tagged
without questioning her, Stangl said. "I
guess they took our word for it," she
said.
Other victims were less fortunate in
finding their stolen property. Stangl
said she "almost felt guilty" because a
neighbor, who was also robbed, found
only two items.
Victims will be unable to claim their
goods — recovered by police from the
residence of Robert and Maureen
O'Connor in La Honda, a friend's
house in Montara and rented storage
rooms in Foster City — until the judge
releases the property, according to
Stanford Police Chief Marvin Her
rington. As a result, recovering the
goods may take six months to a year.
In attempt to keep the identification
process organized, police are requiring
victims to call for a police-supervised
appointment to view the recovered
goods. Stangl called seven times before
receiving an appointment, she said.
Appointments are a maximum oftwo
hours although "it would take two
days" to go through all the goods,
Stanglsaid.
She plans to make a third appoint

ment for next week after the collection
has thinned out, she said.
Victims must bring a copy of the po
lice report filed at the time of their prop
erty loss.
Stangl speculated that the burglar,
who apparently kept most of the goods,
was not as interested in the money as in
the idea of stealing
"He was doing it for the money plus
the feeling . . . just the idea that no one
could catch him," Stangl said.
"The burglar had a bit of a junk
fetish," said Detective Lee Lera of the
Los Altos Police Department.
"We were laughing at the things he
took," Stangl said. For example, the
collection of stolen goods included junk
and even socks. "How do you know
some of that stuff doesn't really belong
to him (the burglar)?" she joked.
