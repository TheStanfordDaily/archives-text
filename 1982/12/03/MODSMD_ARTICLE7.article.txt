## New Ways Energy Fair 
### MIKA HOLGERSON Staff writer 
Stanford's Christmas may not be a white one
and Jack Frost may not be nipping at your nose,
but that doesn't stop the Christmas festivity
from brightening the lives of students worried by
finals. On Wednesday, the New Ways Holiday
Fair helped bring back the nostalgia of Christ
mases of the good old days. From 10 a.m. to 4
p.m.. White Plaza was full of the fair's booths
designed to show students different and creative
ways to de-commercialize Christmas.
The sixth annual News Ways Holiday Fair,
sponsored by the Housing Energy Conservation
Center, encouraged students to explore alter
natives to Christmas' mad shopping rush and re
duce the cost and energy waste promoted by
gimmick gifts. At various booths sponsored by
student groups and off-campus organizations,
Stanford students could try their hand at candle
making, silk-screening, bread-dough art.anden
jov freshlv-roasted chestnuts and foot massages.
The fair's goal of making Christmas more per
sonal was not only a spark for the imaginative
mind, it was also a relief for the pocketbook.
Admid the craft booths were other booths of
fering information on "environmentally-sane
celebration, employment, and living." By en

couraging environmental awareness now, the
Housing Energy Conservation Center hopes to
make conservation a part of daily life rather than
just a seasonal fad.
A small group of students in Lagunita started
the Housing Energy Conservation Center about
five years ago, according to John Eaton, the di
rector of the center. These students' efforts to
make Lagunitans aware of energy usage suc
ceeeded in reducing the energv usage there by 20
percent. Since then, energv representatives and
their omnipresent energy charts have become an
integral part of campus life here.
The Housing Energy Conservation Center has
also sponsored other programs. These include
the student-designed and student-installed solar
system in Roth House, insulation in most dorms
and row houses and renovation of the heating
systems. The organization is University-fi
nanced and student-run.
In addition to making the campus aware of
energy consumption, Dave Swan of Kairos
House (which set up one of the candle-making
booths) said the people who sponsored the fair
also hoped to give students ideas for hand-made
Christmas presents so that they wouldn't have to
resort to the usual store-bought gifts.
