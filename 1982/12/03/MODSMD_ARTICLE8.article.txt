# Chuck Painter: photojournalist, recorder of University's history

You might have seen him at White Plaza.
You might have seen him at Terman. Or the
Quad. Or Maples. With a rust-colored tote
bag on one shoulder, a Nikon Camera on the
other and another Nikon in his right hand, he
is as permanent a fixture at Stanford as the
red-tiled roofs and the towering palm trees.
He came to Stanford the year that most of
this year's junior class was born. In Septem
ber of 1962, Charles "Chuck" Painter started
work for the University News and Publica
tions as a news photographer and has been
recording Stanford historyever since.

In the middle of World War II
he was drafted and served as
an MP in Germany. There he
acquired a few Leicas and
lenses on the black market to
take back home and sell. 'Up
to that time I'd never used a
camera, never held one in my
hand. But I bought a couple of
rolls of film, started shooting
and got hooked.'

"l wrote to Stanford and told them I
wanted a job here," Painter said. "I had an in
terview, brought my portfolio and they hired
me."
This was not Painter's first job as a photog
rapher. He was born in Frankfurt, Indiana in
1927, the eldest of II children. In order to
help support his large family, Painter
dropped out of school at the age of 15 to work
as a postman. In the middle of World War II
he was drafted and served as an MP in Ger
many. There he acquired a few Leicas and
lenses on the black market to take back home
and sell. "Up to that time I'd never used a
camera, never held on in my hand. But I
bought a couple of rolls of film, started shoot
ing and got hooked."
Nine months after he got back to the states
he was a press photographer at The Watson
ville Register Pajarotiian in Watsonvilie, Cali
fornia. Painter was the only photographer on
the paper, and shot everything. "I was good
at it, I found myself. I could hold a camera
and that was it. . . that was just it."
After spending four years at the Pajaro
nian, Painter moved to The Redding Record
Searchlight where he photographed for four
and-a-half years. In 1956 he took a job at

Washington State University as a news pho
tographer. But five years of "snow and
wheatfields" in Pullman drove Painter and
his family back to sunny California. He in
quired at the University of California at San
ta Cruz but ended up at Stanford. "One of the
reasons that I went from newspaper photog
raphy to universities is because I have a fami
ly and a wife," Painter said. "I really should
have gone to some place like Life magazine in
those days and lived out of a suitcase. . . but I
didn't because of my large family."
Indeed Painter's work attests to the fact
that he could be working for Life. He has cov
ered every on-campus subject imaginable
over the last 20 years, and is finding that even
more exist." He has probably seen more Stan
ford history through the camera lens than
anyone else," said Bob Beyers, director of
News and Publications. Painter has traveled
to the overseas campuses twice, photo
graphed Stanford's two successful Rose Bowl
visits in 1971 and 1972, framed all of Stan
ford's Nobel prize winners in his viewfinder
and recorded 20 years of graduating seniors.
But it is not just Painter's tenure at Stan
ford that makes his photographs speak. His
creative vision is always at work. He makes a
careful distinction between the photographer
and the photojournalist who thinks out the
picture and makes it real. "Only 20 percent of
actual practicing professional photographers
are creative and I'm in that 20 percent.
There's a lot of hacks out there who are not
creative," he lamented.

'He is very dedicated to his
career and strives for the best
possible product at all times
.... He is very much a
professional; he concentrates
very hard on doing .
professional work and
wouldn't accept less than
that. *

Painter's care for the created image per
meates his entire photographic process. "I've
developed every negative I've ever made in
my life (and) I wish I could print all my own
negatives, but that's impossible; there is more
of a demand for me to shoot than print." And

for Painter, the shooting is the important
thing. "Whosever eye is behind the camera
when the trigger is punched, that's all that
counts."
Painter learned when and how to punch the
trigger on his own. He is completely self-

taught, reading and practicing, experiment
ing and shooting, with one possible excep
tion. "I might have learned something from
Wynn Bullock," he conceded. "One of the
great photographers of our time, much above
Ansel Adams." He met Bullock in Watson
ville, when Painter was the president of the
Camera Club. Painter also admires the work
of Eugene Smith who, "uses his camera to
record history ... he shows it like it is."
Chances are if Painter had received the
same critical public attention that Bullock
and Smith have, by going to Life or National
Geographic, he would be considered one of
the greats. His colleagues agree. "He is a real
professional," said Ed Souza, News and
Pubs' junior photographer. "He is very dedi
cated to his career and strives for the best pos
sible product at all times," added Stanford
Observer Editor Harry Press. "He is very
much a professional, he concentrate very
hard on doing professional work and
wouldn't accept less than that."
Amid all the requests for the use of his
creative eye, and the hundreds of publications
that bear his byline every year, Painter re
mains reserved and modest. As he ran a pic
ture for the next day's Campus Report
through the chemicals and got the exposure
right the first time he said wistfully, "Stan
ford is there, and there's some nice people in
it. I get to do some good photographic work, I
enjoy it. . . but I work hard too."
