## The 						Stanford Daily Week of the living dead 
### 
Dead Week is back to haunt us again. It wouldn't
bother us so much if it really were "dead." But it
isn't. It is instead a living dead week — filled with
classes, assignments and, for some, finals. That's
bad news, of course, for those procrastinaters who
tend to put off everything from papers and problem
sets, always telling themselves that they'll catch up
during Dead Week.
But the living Dead Week is bad news for ev
eryone else too, because all could truly benefit from
the week of reduced activity that it is meant to be. A
real Dead Week at the end of every quarter — a
week during which a student can take a break from
the frenetic pace of the quarter system and collect
thoughts about courses and review and mull over
information and issues with which he has been pre
sented — is drastically needed.
But, despite the lip-service that administrators
give to the idea, it's hardly that. All too often it ends
up being a time for professors to throw more mate
rial at already satiated students. Some schedule ex
tra lectures; many more pack already-scheduled
ones with so much information that they are barely
comprehensible. Others assign extra reading or
problem sets. All this adds up to a week that for
many is even busier than most.
We look with envy upon other schools'
equivalents of Dead Week, especially the idea of a
week-long — or even two-week — reading period in
which all activity, including classes, is curtailed. It
would be nice to have that time to digest what we
had been force-fed during the quarter, so that what

we write on finals represents the more original
thought the period would bring. But a reading peri
od would be impractical in the quarter system with
which we are now saddled.
It is the hypocricy of the situation that is most
bothersome. Dead Week has a nice ring to it and
more than a few reasons it should be followed, but
it only truly exists in a limbo of lip-service, college
brochures and pleasant abstraction. The week
should be put to rest — a true Dead Week — or rec
ognized for having the classes and obligations it
does have.
All we really ask for is that the policy statement
for Dead Week (you can find it on page 4 of your
time schedule) is closely followed not only in letter
but in spirit. That would mean that "instructors
should neither make extraordianary assignments
nor announce additional course meetings in order
to 'catch up'. . ." It would also mean that Dead
Week finals, which are often offered as a conve
nience to students, would be "strongly dis
couraged" because they "not only reduce the in
struction time available for that particular course
but also substantially diminish students' op
portunities for extensive review and synthesis of
their courses." What they do is encourage cram
ming, which may sometimes be necessary but is
hardly desirable.
It would be a welcome change if at this time next
quarter we could be confident of facing a quiet
week conducive to studying instead of one which is
"dead" in name alone.
