How Much
Should A Pair Of
Contact Lenses
Cost?
How much Is professionalism
worth?
If you look around hard enough,
you can find just about anything at
a lower price. Somewhere.
But if you're considering contact
lenses, should the lowest price be
your first concern?
We at TOTAL CONTACT say "NO."
Your first concern should be -
where can you get the best quality,
the best fit, end the best follow-up
service. At a reasonable price, of
course.
At TOTAL CONTACT, we don't just
promise all of the above. They're
guaranteed.
What if I don't like them?
When we say "Satisfaction
Guaranteed" we mean it. At TOTAL
CONTACT, you have as long as
30 days from your first fitting to wear
and decide. If you don't love your
contact lenses, return them and
get a full refund of the cost of the
lenses. (Cost of eye examination is
not included.) That's the TOTAL
CONTACT guarantee.
Do I need an examination?
For a perfect fit and good sight
correction, you need a good
prescription. A complete eye
examination by our doctor costs
$25. Or you may bring in your own
doctor's prescription.
Whaf kind of lenses?
At TOTAL CONTACT we offer only
the highest quality lenses. That's our
policy. And that's why we feature
BAUSCH & LOMB soft lenses.
We offer all kinds, including
conventional soft, semi-soft,
extended-wear soft, astigmatism

new bifocal soft lenses, and hard

Total Contact's prices and why.
Over the years, people have
learned to trust our professionalism
and high quality standards. And
we're not about to jeopardize this
hard-earned trust by cutting comers
and running sales all the time. We're
totally committed to the very best
in contact lenses... always at

mean we're never ever going to
offer a sale.
