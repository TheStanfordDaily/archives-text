The Tfexas Instruments
Home Computer.
It's a whole £
new way I p,|f
to learn.
Having your own computer can open a whole new
world for you. Whatever your chosen field, you'll
find the Texas Instruments Home Computer a
powerful tool for analysis, problem solving, record
keeping, decision making, research, and more. And
the power it places in your hands can be put to work
quickly and easily.
Broad choice of software
Pre-programmed Solid State Software™ Com
mand Modules based on the same concept proven
in Tl's programmable calculators and containing up
to 30k bytes of read-only memory simply snap
into place and you're ready to go. There are more
than 40 of them. And over 400 more programs are
available in cassette and diskette formats. There's a
broad and fast-growing choice in the areas of engi
neering, science, business, art, self-improvement
... and entertainment.
Powerful programming capability
For your own programming, you'll find TI BASIC
is a rich and versatile language. It's powerful, yet
easy to learn and use. What's more, it's built right
into the Texas Instruments Home Computer.
Random-access memory supplied is 16k bytes (ex
pandable to 48k bytes). There's an excellent, type
writer-style, full-travel keyboard with overlays for
second functions. Sixteen colors are available and
sound through five octaves 110 Hz to beyond
40,000 Hz with capability for three simultaneous
tones. At the heart of it all: a 9900-family, 16-bit
microprocessor.
Optional accessories including speech!
With the Solid State Speech™ Synthesizer ac
cessory, you can add electronic speech more than
370 English words. Use it with the Terminal
Emulator II Command Module and Tl's phoneme
stringing technique delivers a virtually unlimited
vocabulary. Other optional accessories include
Memory Expansion (32K bytes of RAM), Disk
Memory Drive and Controller, Telephone Coupler
(MODEM), Solid State Printer, R5232 Interface,
Wired Remote Controllers, 10-inch Color Monitor,
and a Video Modulator.
Compare and you'll find the TI-99/4A Home Com
puter gives you more for your money,
"feature for feature. And, if you have a I jur--i
television receiver, you can get CP \
started for less than $600! See your
dealer today for a demonstration. \j
Texas Instruments invented the integrated circuit, microprocessor and microcomputer. Being first is our tradition.
