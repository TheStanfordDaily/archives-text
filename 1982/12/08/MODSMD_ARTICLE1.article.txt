# Pranksters steal flick from ASSU
## 
### KAREN SPRINGEN 
Somebody on campus is having a
good laugh. But ASSU Flicks managers
)are not amused by the prankster or
pranksters who "kidnapped" the con
clusion of Personal Best for a few hours
last Sunday.
"Someone clearly stole the second
half of the film," said Scott Culley, di
rector of ASSU Sunday Flicks. A
canister containing the final three of
seven film reels, altogether worth
$BOOO, was taken by an as-yet-uniden
tified pranksters.
After receiving several clues, Flicks
staffers recovered the missing reels by 8
p.m., so that the entire film was shown
at both 7 and 9:30 p.m.
But the pranksters' ransom demand
that the audience see the 7 p.m. movie
} for free likely caused the ASSU to lose
about $l5OO in box office sales.
At about 5:45 p.m. the flicks
projectionist told box office manager
Katie Vogel that a canister containing
three film reels was missing from Me
morial Auditorium. Vogel called Cul
lev, who alerted the police.
At about 6:30 p.m. a male ransomer
called Memorial Auditorium. He said
that if staff members wanted the reels
returned, they had to have KZSU play
AC/DC's single, "I've Got Big Balls."
Flicks staffers called the campus radio
station, which played the song.
About 10 minutes after the song
aired, staff members received a second
call. A male voice said, "Let everyone in
free to the first show and there will be a
( paper airplane thrown onto the stage
which will tell where the last three reels
are."
Flicks staffers followed these instruc
tions, allowing about 1100 students free
admission to the 7 p.m. showing of Per
sonal Best , Culley said. Culley an
nounced the Flicks could not guarantee
that the audience would see the film in
its entirety.
"The audience didn't react that poor
ly because they got in free," Culley said.
"The second show was complete and
everyone paid as normal."
Before the movie started, Culley
found the proper airplane, one of four
that reached the stage, but hand-written
instructions inside provided a false clue.
Vogel said she, Culley and two police
officers went to a dorm room as
directed but the reels were not there.
Vogel would not disclose the name of
the dorm.
Staffers then received another phone
call which directed them to go behind
Memorial Auditorium to the Graduate
School of Business parking lot, where
the canister was found near some
shrubbery.
But whodunnit?
"There aren't a lot of leads at this
point," said Stanford Police Capt.
Marvin Moore. The officers on duty
Sunday night will not return to work
until Thursday and could not be
reached for comment.
Police are checking the canister and
the hand-written airplane note for fin
gerprints, Culley said.
The staff of the Chaparral has a his
tory of similar pranks, but Culley said
he did not think the humor magazine
was behind this stunt. Culley rooms
with the magazine's business manager,
Vinnie Freda.
"We're positive it wasn't the Chappie
," Culley said. Although ASSU Flicks'
contract on Star Trek prevented the
campus humor magazine from showing
that film last Saturday night, Chappie
staffers said they did not take the reels.
In the past, the Chappie has planned
pranks to publicize new issues of the
magazine, but staffers said they did not
stage any publicity stunts for the
Chaparral which went on sale yester
day. And the infamous Hammer and
Coffin Society initiation stunts will not
take place until spring quarter.
Chris Walters, editor of the Chapar
ral, said the magazine was not involved.
"I'm clueless. I don't know what you're
talking about," he told the Daily Sun
day night.
Freda, business manager of the
Chaparral, said, "Usually we take cred
it for the stuff we do ... We would nev

er force a group to lose money." He
added, "It would have to have been a
tight group because the secret was kept
so well."
A fraternity or a dorm group could
have pulled the prank, but because in
side information about Flicks pro
cedures was needed to execute the heist,
Culley said he doubted that an outside
group, such as Berkeley students, was
involved.
"We can put this on the category of
premeditated ... It had to be timed per
fectly," Culley said.
"It's probably more than one person
.. . unless they ran out of the
auditorium (to make the phone call),"
Culley said.
Vogel said more people than usual at
tended the 7 p.m. show, leading to
speculation that the pranksters told
their friends that admission, usually
$1.50, would be free.
