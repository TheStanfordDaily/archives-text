## More versatile than artificial heart Heart device being developed at Hospital 
### KRISTEN CHRISTOPHER Senior staff writer 
Although there are no plans at Stanford Univer
sity Hospital to give artificial hearts to people whose
own organ is failing, researchers here are working
on developing a device which would perform the
. same function as an artificial heart but have greater
' versatility.
The first permanent mechanical heart was suc
cessfully implanted in a 61-year-old man last Thurs
day at the University of Utah Medical Center.
According to Mike Goodkind, of the Stanford
Medical Center News Bureau, "The philosophy
here is not to get into artificial hearts."
Doctors here would like to do only transplants,
but if someone cannot qualify for a transplant or a
donor is not available for someone who is critically
in need of a new heart, they may turn to a new de
vice.
I At Stanford, patients over 55-years-old cannot
qualify for a transplant due to both their physical
condition and the difficulty in finding donors.
When asked if Stanford's new device would also
have an age requirement, Philip Oyer, assistant pro
fessor of cardiovascular surgery and head of re-

search on it, said, "Not necessarily, that all has to be
defined . . . after using it in patients."
After the object, known as the left ventricular as
sist device, is implanted in the heart, it essentially
takes over the function of the left ventricle, which
pumps blood out to the body. A weak heart may
create a subnormal systemic pressure the pressure
needed to send the blood throughout the body. To
remedy this problem, the device takes blood from
the heart and boosts the pressure to normal systemic
blood pressure.
"We've been working on it for more than 10
years," said Oyer.
The device has been tested on calves, and clinical
trials on humans may begin within the next year, ac
cording to Oyer.
Although the assist device, like the artificial heart,
will require an external source of power, it will pro
vide the patient with more mobility than the
artificial heart. While Barney Clark, the artificial
heart recipient, must be connected to 375 pounds of
equipment by 6-foot hoses, an assist device recipient
may be able to wear a small battery in a backpack or
around his waist, according to Oyer.
According to Oyer, the assist device is also prefer
able to the full artificial heart because the patient is

not fully dependent on it since his heart is still there.
Therefore, if for some reason the device stops work
ing, the patient can continue to live.
Oyer pointed out that the device would also be
"useful in other situations where the patient's own
heart might recover."
"We sort of think the assist device will be more
flexible in its use," he said.
Another advantage of the assist device is that the
chance of infection from it will be less than that from
the artificial heart, according to Oyer.
The artificial heart is powered by a mechanical
pump which pushes pressurized air into the heart
through the connecting tubes that pass through the
patient's side. The power for the assist device will be
beamed through the entire skin, because a wire coil
will be planted inside the patient. Since no wires will
pass through the skin, which is particularly suscep
tible to infection, the chance of infection will be low
er with the assist device.
At 550 grams, the device is considerably heavier
than the artificial heart which weighs 280 grams.
"That's because the assist device contains not only
the pump but the power supply as well. .. the elec
trical motor is all in the body," Oyer said.
