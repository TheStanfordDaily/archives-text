# 10th heart-lung patient stable after transplant
## 
### 
A San Rafael man who received a
new heart and lungs at Stanford
Hospital Monday appears to be
making a quick recovery, the hospi
tal announced yesterday.
The heart-lung transplant per
formed on Frank LaForge, 27, was
the third such operation done here
since Nov. 10 and the 10th since the
transplant program began on March
9, 1981.
LaForge was reported in critical
but stable condition yesterday. All
heart-lung recipients are so listed for
at least a week after the operation,
but LaForge was taken off the respi
rator early Tuesday morning.
Like the two most recent heart
lung patients, LaForge was born
with a hole between the right and left
chambers of the heart, a defect
which is now usually corrected at
birth.
This problem, called ventricular
septal defect, causes an overcircula

tion of blood in the lungs. The over
circulation subsequently causes in
creased pressure in the pulmonary
arteries the vessels that carry
blood from the heart to the lungs
and deterioration of the heart and
lungs.
LaForge should be able to return
to his work as an accountant, but
like all double-tra-nsplant patients,
he will remain on medication for the
rest of his life to prevent rejection of
his new organs.
LaForge had been waiting for a
heart and lungs since October, said
Joan Miller, a research nurse who
coordinates the transplant program.
He called into the hospital Nov.
23 because doctors thought a donor
had been found. But the lungs were
too damaged for the operation, so
the heart was used for a single trans
plant, said Mike Goodkind of the
Medical Center News Bureau.
