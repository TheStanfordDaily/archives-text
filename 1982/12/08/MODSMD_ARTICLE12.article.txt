## 
### SANDRA BODOVITZ Staff writer 
The offices of student affairs and resi
dential education will be without their
top officials for seven months begin
ning next Feb. 1, but staff members ex
pect no major changes to occur beyond
the shuffling of responsibilities.
Dean of Student Affairs James Lyons

will be on sabbatical from Feb. 1 to
Sept. 1, 1983. Lyons' current responsi
bilities include coordinating and direct
ing student services, serving as a mem
ber of the Administrative Cabinet, the
Deans' Council and the Undergraduate
Cabinet, and responding to student
emergencies.
Norm Robinson, associate dean for

residential education, will become the
acting dean of student affairs. Rob
inson, who will continue to administer
the residential education program, will
assume only some of Lyons' responsi
bilities.The rest will be divided between
assistant deans in the student affairs of
fice.
Robinson was the only person con
sidered for the position. "Norm Rob
inson has been my associate dean and
deputy, so it is a natural role'for him,"
Lyons said.
Assistant Deans Margaret Fidler and
Carole Price will be assuming some of
the budgetary responsibilities for stu
dent services. Ron Hudson and Sylvia
Castillo,also assistant deans of student
affairs, will largely be handling the indi
vidual emergency cases, while Rob
inson will assume the administrative
roles, according to Lyons.
The responsibilities Hudson will as
sume are probably the most important
in terms of student needs. Lyons said,
"If students have personal emergencies
have to go home etc. I would get
involved personally. When students
were injured at the Big Game rally in
San Francisco I was one of the first peo

pie notified by students and others," he
said. Hudson said that he is "looking
towards assuming more responsibilities
in crises and emergency management in
the residential system" in conjunction
with Robinson who will be involved in
both residential and student affairs.
"We will be busier. Fewer people will
be doing the same amount of work,"
said Diana Conklin, assistant dean and
director of the row and fraternities.
"Responsibilities will be shared but as
far as the specific details go, we haven't
gotten that far in terms of planning
yet," she said. "We'll miss Dean Lyons
but we'll be in good hands with Dean
Robinson."
Roger Whitney, assistant dean of res
idential education and director of hous
ing, shared Conklin's view that despite
more work no major changes would oc
cur in the Office of Residential Educa
tion.
He will also work on a course he
teaches at the School of Education, en
titled "Student Affairs Adminis
tration / Practices and Issues," as well as
lecturing at Michigan State University
on current issues in student affairs ad
ministration.
