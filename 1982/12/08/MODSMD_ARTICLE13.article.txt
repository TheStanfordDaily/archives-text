# Phones to allow quick calls within U.S. for 50 cents

Thirty-second express telephones are
coming to Stanford.
Bv Dec. 15, the Stanford community
will be finding special green telephones
at selected locations on campus. The
phones will allow callers to make tele
phone calls to any location in the con
tinental United States for 50 cents.
These calls, however, will be limited
to a maximum of 30 seconds in length.
According to Pacific Telephone spokes
man Jim Monroe, "Between 20 and 25
seconds you will get a warning tone
(that your time is almost up.) After an
other five to eight seconds, an auto
matic timing device on the phone will
cut you off."
Four special green telephones will be

installed on campus. Two will be lo
cated at Tresidder Union, one at the
Graduate School of Business and one at
the Law School.
Stanford was selected as one of the
test sites because "historically, these lo
cations have had a fair number of long
distance calls placed, of short dura
tion," said Monroe.
He said he felt that many students
were presently using regular pay tele
phones to make short telephone calls to
home from these locations. "We think
that they could be calling home to say,
'l'm catching this flight, number so and
so, which will arrive at (such and such) a
time," he said.
Monroe speculated that "students
might use the new telephones to call
their parents for 50 cents, to ask for
money, or to say, 'Call me back,' so the

parents would know they're (the stu
dent) was home." He added that, "a lot
of people are probably calling home.
Maybe their airplane flight is delayed,
or they missed the flight, and they're
calling to let their parents know."
The current minimum daytime rate
for a call from San Francisco to New
York on a coin-operated telephone is
$2.35 for three minutes. While the per
minute rate is more expensive on the
"express telephones," Monroe noted
that many current pay phone callers
would save money because they do not
make use of the full three-minute allot
ment.
The telephone company is still trying
to determine whether 30-seconds is the
optimal length for an express telephone
call. "One of the questions we will be

asking will be, 'ls thirty seconds enough
time to get a very specific message
across?' " according to Monroe.
Monroe noted that Stanford is not
the only place the experimental tele
phones will be tested. Other sites in
clude San Francisco International Air
port, the University of California at San
Diego, the Camp Pendelton Marine
base in San Diego, and an Oceanside
Greyhound bus depot (near the marine
camp).
The phone company will also be
measuring the number, length and dis
tance of calls made from the green
phones, and surveys will be handed out
by the telephone company next year to
help evaluate customer response to the
project. "It's an experiment," Monroe
said.
