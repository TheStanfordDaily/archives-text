## THE 						STANFORD DAILY A 						wide-open Democratic field 
### 
We must commend Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-
Mass.) for making his recent decision to withdraw
from the field of contenders who will seek the Dem
ocratic presidential nomination in 1984. In that
Kennedy suffered from any doubts about this race,
it certainly was his responsibility both to his party
and his nation, to resolve them before the dawn of
the new year.
Now that the senior U.S. senator from Massa
chusetts has decided not to compete in the great
Oval Office sweepstakes, the race will not be
clouded by the "Teddy factor."
Even while deprived of the haunting shadow of
the Kennedy legacy, a legend built on the twin
pillars of glamour and blood, Camelot and human
sacrifice, Democratic voters will still be provided
with numerous choices for the party's presidential
standard-bearer, an individual who will be selected
from a full spectrum of different personalities and
divergent ideological positions.
For those who favor standard A.D.A. liberals,
there are the choices of Walter Mondale,
Humphrey's protege and Carter's Vice-President,
California's Alan Cranston, and probably Arizona
Rep. Morris Udall. Stepping beyond the for
midable memories of his famous former mentors,
Mondale has recently struck a protectionist note
against Japanese imports, thus incurring former
President Carter's wrath over this blatant bid to
win an endorsement from the AFL-CIO before the
end of 1983. Mondale's campaign may be hurt by
charges of blandness, lack of charismatic leader
ship qualities, and by his association with Carter's
"born again" White House. Cranston, the Senate's
minority whip, will play the role of reassuring "al
ternative grandfather figure" to President Reagan.
Udall, the 1976 also-ran who finished second

in umpteen primaries, may prove to be a dynamic
underdog who upsets the field with his biting wit
and rugged Western warmth.
Located closer to the center are Ohio Sen. John
Glenn, South Carolina Sen. Ernest Hollings, and
former Florida Gov. Reuben Askew. Glenn, an
authentic American hero, will attempt to project
the image of a wise "Democratic Eisenhower."
Considered to be most effective in small groups,
Glenn may produce surprise victories in early rural
state contests such as lowa and New Hampshire.
Colorful shoot-from-the-hip Hollings and the re
spectably solid Askew will try to build upon their
Southern power bases, and one of them may net a
vice-presidential nomination for their efforts.
The strongest newcomer to the field may be Sen.
Gary Hart of Colorado. Hart simultaneously of
fers a contrast and a challenge to Reagan: the con
trast is his glowing vibrant youth and the challenge
is his equivalent ability to communicate over the
television airwaves. An "Atari Democrat," a neo
liberal, Hart believes in high technology solutions
to America's economic problems, with an emphasis
on limited economic planning for target high
growth industries. Even though he managed
George McGovern's presidential campaign in
1972, Hart is hardly a far-left partisan; rather, oper
ating in an entirely different mode, he serves as a
Naval Reserve Officer and sits on the Senate
Armed Services Committee where he has ad
vocated a beefing-up of the nation's conventional
forces. Former Sen. Edmund Muskie recently of
fered the following complimentary evaluation of
Hart: "He's an intellectual. He has ideas.. . he's of
fered more than any of the other candidates at this
point."
