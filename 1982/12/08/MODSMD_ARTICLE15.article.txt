Recently, a flyer that urged support for the ad
ministration's dense-pack basing proposal for the
MX missile in the name of the Stanford Conserva
tive Political Alliance (SCPA), was distributed
across campus. The flyer, which simplistically
argues that "now is not the time to question" and
that "we must trust our president," is disturbing, to
say the ieast. What is even more disturbing, how
ever, is the fact that the SCPA had absoulutely
nothing to do with the production and distribution
of the flyer; it has not even taken a formal position
on the MX proposal.
No individual or group has stepped forward to
claim responsibility for this malicious effort to slur
the name of a campus political orgainization and it
is not likely that the identity of the originator(s) will
ever be made known. Regardless of its source, the
flyer has done its damage and much of that will be
irreversible. Many of those who read it will never

know that the views represented were not those of
the SCPA.
Political controversy is nothing new for this cam
pus. And many of the SCPA's views have certainly
been controversial so much so that we must ad
mit that we were at first fooled by the fake flyer.
But those who oppose the stated beliefs of the
SCPA or any other any student political group are
free to do so in the context of a debate or in a cam
pus-wide dialogue. It is disheartening to discover
that student critics found it more convenient to
sidestep legitimate forms of opposition and resort
to "dirty tricks." It seems to us that the most suit
able political climate for this university is one in
which differing groups can confront each other
openly and honestly so that students might be ex
posed to the broadest possible range of political
thought and ideology.
