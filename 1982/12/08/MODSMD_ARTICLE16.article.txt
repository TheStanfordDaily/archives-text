# New overseas opportunity
## 
### 
The Stanford Overseas Study Program tends to
maintain a certain parochialism, a peculiar tenden
cy among those who decide curriculums at overseas
campuses to eschew scientific courses. This prob
lem, exacerbated by the University's penchant for
assigning only three or four units of credit to de
manding engineering, science and math courses,
which puts unusual time constraints on students in
these fields, means that only a handful of science
students end up going overseas.
With the assistance of the Stanford Alumni Club
in Germany and the Krupp Foundation, which are
helping fund internships for engineering, science
and math students at the Berlin campus, however, it
seems that more students in the technical fields will
be able to venture abroad.
We applaud this effort. While we see irony in the

fact that science students who participate in the
program are promised three-month internships
with German companies while none are promised
for non-technical students, encouraging science
students to expand their otherwise-narrow cur
riculum is a step in the right direction. Students in
the program are required to have taken at least a
quarter of German and must, while in Berlin, take
an intensive German language, politics, history and
culture course.
The opportunity to work for a foreign company
is a unique and challenging one. But the real ex
perience is living in another country and learning
from another culture. We're glad that the op
portunity is now available for students majoring in
subjects outside the humanities and social sciences.
