# From a Northern friend

Merry ho ho, etc. Look, I realize that I'm sup
posed to be jolly and happy and all that, but, frank
ly, I'm too busy this time of year to do much giggl
ing. Between Dasher's little problem, sugar prices,
the lack of trained air controllers, and all that
damned useless mail, would I be one to laugh?
Besides, I happen to have the best PR front in the
world.
I have, however, given my friends at the news
paper a bit of my precious time for a preview of
what's going to appear in the stockings of several
good and bad boys and girls. Here's a hint of what's
to come:
• For University President Donald Kennedy,
there's a cute and much publicized little solu
tion to business-academic conflicts, and some
blister relief.
• For the Stanford police, some more intelligent
cats to help them solve all their pressing cases.
• For the ASSU Senate and COP, there's going to
be a not so subtle reminder to reread their cam
paign pledges (and, if they improve, a super-ac
counting election-running-and-districting pizzeria
in the boathouse).
• For the editors of Stanford Interview , a sub
scription to The National Enquirer for their reading
pleasure.
• For SPA, a framed photo of SCPA and 30 more
ideological issues to wrangle over.
• For Michael Baratz, there's going to be a plan
to get lots of coverage, make lots of speeches, lead

lots of workers on strike for weeks and finally
win, somewhere else.
• For the band, pads.
• For the Women's Center, away to make the
consensus process work.
• For George Shultz, the opportunity to move up
in the world with a full professorship.
• For the last humartities students, strong com
mitment to untaxed unemployment benefits.
• For Stern and Wilbur residents, insurance and
cast-iron stomachs.
• For the board of trustees, the ability to under
stand fully what they're voting on.
• For Priscilla Wheeler, a copy of How to be Your
Own Best Friend.
• For the football team, trombones.
• For SCPA, a framed photo of SPA and a
coupon for a free rabies shot.
• For Robert Rosenzweig, there's going to be a
legion of sympathetic legislators.
• For Stanford students, the ability not to worry
about their exam results.
• And to all, a good night. (Corny tradition, but
I'm stuck with it.)
I've loved talking to you, but I have to fly, so to
speak. Rudolph really shows his years these days. I
also am going to have a hell of a time thinking of
anything to give to Walter Mondale. Personality of
a chipmunk. By the way, let me know if you have
anything to keep me up and going for an all-nighter
I have to pull in not so long. Ho.
