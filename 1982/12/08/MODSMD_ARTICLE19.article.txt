## Video games prove productive 
### 
There are many serious problems fac
ing individuals today: crime, declining
morals, poverty, inflation, unemploy
ment, the threat of a world-ending nu
clear holocaust... Big Game. With all
of these to worry about, it is a wonder to
us that people have devoted so much
time toward condemning the video
game.
In the Phillipines, video games have

been banned. In Oakland, they are re
stricted during school hours. Many pa
rents look down upon their children us
ing such machines, calling them a
"waste of time and money."
People don't ban video games out of
malice or fear. They have their own
"logical" reasons. They contend that:
• Video games are a waste of time.
They provide no constructive outlet for
a person's energy. They take kids out of
school, hypnotizing them, and turning
them into mindless zombies.
• Video games are a waste of money.
They eat up quarters like they were
Lay's potato chips, and they don't give
you anything in return.
• Video games are a threat to the
health of our nation's children. Pro
longed video gaming can harm the de
veloping eyes of a child. Crouching over
a machine is bad for one's posture, and
does not provide good exercise.
• Video games stifle mental develop
ment. They keep children away from
school. They eliminate creative
thought, keeping children's minds on
pushing buttons, rather than opening
books.
Poppycock! These rash general
izations, these one-sided arguments are
an embarrassment to a nation built
upon the virtues of justice, truth and
freedom of expression. This unjustified
discrimination must be stopped.
The above arguments are shallow at
best. Video games make many positive
contributions to society. These favor-

able points have gone unnoticed for too
long.
Video games are definitely not a
waste of time. They may not leave you
with anything tangible for your quarter,
but there are incredible psychic benefits
involved.
You've just failed a mid-term. You
haven't gotten any mail for eight weeks.
Your No. 1-one ranked IM team just

lost in the first round of playoffs. Your
bike is broken. Dinner tonight is egg
plant stackups. So what?
You walk into Tresidder Recreation
Center and there she is, waiting for you.
Her features are smooth and clean. She
hums quietly as you approach. You get
to her, and hold her firmly by the hand,
staring intensely into her glowing face.
You take a deep breath, and drop your
quarter into the slot.
For a few minutes, you forget your
problems. Electronic games are an ex
cellent form of escapism. Where else

can one become a race car driver,
starship pilot, or sports hero all within a
few minutes, except within the confines
of a modern, glittering video game pal
ace?
Rather than stifle creativity, video
games inspire it. They encourage us to
create scenarios which place the ab
stract images on the screen into a mate
rial setting. Little shapeless blips be
come ugly alient monsters, enemy tanks
or enormous asteroids, only with some
mind power.
They provide a healthy outlet for

frustration. It is far better for society to
have its members kill aliens, blow up
tanks or munch monsters in an im
aginary setting, than to rape, kill and
rob their fellow humans.
With all of these favorable aspects it
is ridiculous to call them a waste of
money. What's a quarter, compared to
the benefits involved? What else can
you buy with a quarter? A few drops of
gas, a few sticks of gum, six minutes at a
Motel 6, one bite of a Big Mac? Equate
any of these with the pleasures of a
simple computer game, and the choice
should be obvious.
They are helpful to the economy. The
software industry is rapidly expanding,
aided bv them. The most profitable sec
tion of the Tresidder Memorial Union
is the game room. Christmas is ap
proaching, and ads for video game sys
tems are everywhere. They are easily the
hottest-selling toys on the market to
day.
They are also not as detrimental to
our health as we have been led to be
lieve. They are, in fact, marvelous for
developing the eye-hand coordination
used in any other athletic activity. Wrist
strength and grip improve significantly.
Finally, machine literacy is of vital
importance in this, an ever more tech
nological age. Machines will continue
to be a greater force in our lives, and
video games make us familiar with,
rather than intimidated by them.
It seems a shame that in spite of all

the positive aspects of video games,
harsh criticism and even legal restric
tions continue, especially since upon
closer examination all the indictments
are groundless. It is too bad that enter
ing a video game parlor is likened to en
tering an opium den. For others it is just
another sign of our deteriorating socie
ty. Pity.
Well, excuse us. We're going to the
Rec Center, and we're not ashamed.
Not one bit.

They encourage us to create scenarios which place
the abstract images on the screen into a material
setting. Little shapeless blips become ugly alien
monsters, enemy tanks or enormous asteroids,
