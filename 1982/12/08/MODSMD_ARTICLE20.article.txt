## Growing intolerance 
### 
I am frightened by an apparent grow
ing intolerance towards different points
of view in America and on campus.
Many people consider Jerry Falwell's
Moral Majority as a closed-minded
group trying to impose its views on oth
ers, but I do not feel threatened by the
Moral Majority hecause its influence is
limited. Much more threatening is the
insidious intolerance of differing opin
ions that I have encountered here on
campus.
It disturbs me to see during dis
cussions groups of fairly uniformly
thinking people who belieye that their
opinions are somehow more
"progressive" and "enlightened" than
alternative opinions. Consequently
they can sincerely label any opposing
viewpoints as "backward" and "ig
norant." This intolerant thinking in
college-educated people is much more
likely than the Moral Majority to limit
harmless diversity in opinions and life
styles.
I have a nightmare of "enlightened"
people closing their minds to alter
native opinions and inflicting their
views on others. But I also have a
dream. I wish my friends would tell me
that I am a very enigmatic person, that
some of my opinions agree with their
opinions, and that some do not.
I would hope that my friends would
agree that everyone has the right to live
and think however they want as long as
they harm no one.
