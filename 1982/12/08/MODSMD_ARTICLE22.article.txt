# Paddling upstream
## "Gay couple" unsuitable for CIA 
### 
A year ago, law students at UC-Berkeley solicited
Stanford law student support for a picket protesting
CIA recruiting at the two schools. While the
Berkeley protest forced the CIA to conduct its in
terviews under federal protective custody in Oak
land, we Stanfordites chose a different method. We
figured that an effective way to register our distaste
for CIA practices and to expose their unstated poli
cy of refusing to hire homosexual citizens was to in
terview with them ourselves posing as a gay cou
ple seeking undercover assignments.
After securing the last available interview slots,
we asked the interviewer, the chief of the ClA's liti
gation department (we'll just call him the Shadow),
if we could interview together since we had mutual
questions and concerns. He agreed, reluctantly, and
ushered us in.
"What Agency legal work interests you?" the
Shadow asked.
"Well, we are only interested in covert operations
if we handled Freedom of Information requests
we'd be blacklisted from undercover work and we
want to be spies."
"What kind of covert work?" he inquired.
"Domestic intelligence," we enthused. "We'd be
very good at infiltrating leftist political groups and
disrupting them from the inside.
The Shadow cleared his throat. "You know, our
charter no longer permits us to conduct domestic
intelligence operations, so uhh . . . that might not be
possible."
"We know you say that publicly,'''' we said with a
wink, "but that will change soon." The Shadow
smiled and indicated he shared our optimism that
President Reagan will succeed in his attempt to
once again open the domestic market to the cloak
and dagger crowd.
The Shadow slowly scrutinized our resumes.
"You two have worked for a number of liberal polit
ical groups."
"Oh, yes sir," we said. "For years we have been
infiltrating various left-wing, subversive organiza
tions from the NAACP Legal Defense Fund to
Ralph Nader's organizations and other groups
which threaten national security."
The Shadow now appeared puzzled. "You mean
you didn't believe in what these people were doing?
Why did you do it?"
"You can't just walk into one of those kooky
anti-nuke groups and expect them to trust you.
Most of your agents probably were presidents of
Young Republicans for Nixon in college, a worthy
cause, but we've been planning ahead."
At this point we worried that our patriotism
sounded a bit intense even for a Company man. But
we had to be enthusiastic recruits because our "dir
ty little secret" would soon be revealed.
"The Agency often makes use of well-placed in
ternational lawyers and professors. You two could
get well-established and contact us later," The
Shadow advised.
"I think on the international front we are more
l K j j ji-, par a na i lit ary activites than paralegal
aonEttoqrm .wsiYni* •!
"What did you have in mind?" The Shadow
asked.

"You know, the usual things you guys do
counter-insurgency, destabilizing leftist govern
ments . .. we'd be great."
"I'm sure we do very little of that," The Shadow
insisted instead urging that we might find the Agen
cy's legal work intriguing. Undeterred, we asked
him if the legal staff ever set up fictional companies
to function as covers for agents overseas.
"Well, yes," he replied reluctantly, "lawyers have
to set those up." But a business that didn't exist
could not have a CIA lawyer sign its legal docu
ments, we observed. "Wouldn't you need a fictional
law firm?" He nodded, so we pushed our line of
questioning a step further.
"Let me get you straight. We'd be working for a
law firm that didn't exist, filing fictional legal docu
ments for a corporation that didn't exist. Do your
attorneys ever suffer a certain identify crisis?" The
Shadow barely smiled now.
Earlier in the interview, we had casually dropped
the possibility that we could pose as gay-rights ac
tivists to gather information about left-wing politi
cal activity in San Francisco. That bait made the
Shadow suspicious, and he followed it up.
"Mike, your resume says you grew up in the
Midwest and went to college back East. Why did
you come out to San Francisco for law school?"
The Shadow inquired.
"Well, my friend and I were tempted to go to
Yale, but you know, people out East are just so up
tight. "
Our "little secret" slowly dawned on him as he
compared the address and phone number on our re
sumes. (Since we were housemates, they were the
same.)
"You two live together?" The Shadow said with
unconceded disdain, actually backing his chair up a
few feet. By now we were both bursting with
laughter inside, but we kept on our serious in
terview masks.
"I think you'll find it nearly impossible to gain
employment with the Agency given those, uh, that
lifestyle," the Shadow told us quite seriously.
"Why would the government purposely dis
criminate against gays?" we asked, incredulous.
"Don't get me wrong. We don't discriminate
against homosexuals, we just don't hire them. They
are a security risk. Homosexuals could easily be
compromised or blackmailed to reveal secrets."
"But wait, what if we are totally out of the closet
and not even our mothers care," we indignantly
countered.
The Shadow became very flustered and soon
brought what had become a 40-minute interview to
an end. Although we were unaware of it at the time,
the CIA is currently defending against federal liti
gation challenging the Agency's refusal to hire gays.
And believe it or not, the ClA's key defense is that
gays present a "security risk."
As we left, we weren't exactly anxious to receive
the prize that every law student hopes for an all
expense paid fly-back for more interviews. We were
afraid our fly-back to Langley, Virginia might turn
out to be a one-way trip.

Why did you do it?"
"You can't just walk into one of those kooky
anti-nuke groups and expect them to trust you.
Most of your agents probably were presidents of
Young Republicans for Nixon in college, a worthy
cause, but we've been planning ahead."
At this point we worried that our patriotism
sounded a bit intense even for a Company man. But
we had to be enthusiastic recruits because our "dir
ty little secret" would soon be revealed.
"The Agency often makes use of well-placed in
ternational lawyers and professors. You two could
get well-established and contact us later," The
Shadow advised.
"I think on the international front we are more
l K j j ji-, par a na i lit ary activites than paralegal

"What did you have in mind?" The Shadow
asked.

"You know, the usual things you guys do
counter-insurgency, destabilizing leftist govern
ments . .. we'd be great."
"I'm sure we do very little of that," The Shadow
insisted instead urging that we might find the Agen
cy's legal work intriguing. Undeterred, we asked
him if the legal staff ever set up fictional companies
to function as covers for agents overseas.
"Well, yes," he replied reluctantly, "lawyers have
to set those up." But a business that didn't exist
could not have a CIA lawyer sign its legal docu
ments, we observed. "Wouldn't you need a fictional
law firm?" He nodded, so we pushed our line of
questioning a step further.
"Let me get you straight. We'd be working for a
law firm that didn't exist, filing fictional legal docu
ments for a corporation that didn't exist. Do your
attorneys ever suffer a certain identify crisis?" The
Shadow barely smiled now.
Earlier in the interview, we had casually dropped
the possibility that we could pose as gay-rights ac
tivists to gather information about left-wing politi
cal activity in San Francisco. That bait made the
Shadow suspicious, and he followed it up.
"Mike, your resume says you grew up in the
Midwest and went to college back East. Why did
you come out to San Francisco for law school?"
The Shadow inquired.
"Well, my friend and I were tempted to go to
Yale, but you know, people out East are just so up
tight. "
Our "little secret" slowly dawned on him as he
compared the address and phone number on our re
sumes. (Since we were housemates, they were the
same.)
"You two live together?" The Shadow said with
unconceded disdain, actually backing his chair up a
few feet. By now we were both bursting with
laughter inside, but we kept on our serious in
terview masks.
"I think you'll find it nearly impossible to gain
employment with the Agency given those, uh, that
lifestyle," the Shadow told us quite seriously.
"Why would the government purposely dis
criminate against gays?" we asked, incredulous.
"Don't get me wrong. We don't discriminate
against homosexuals, we just don't hire them. They
are a security risk. Homosexuals could easily be
compromised or blackmailed to reveal secrets."
"But wait, what if we are totally out of the closet
and not even our mothers care," we indignantly
countered.
The Shadow became very flustered and soon
brought what had become a 40-minute interview to
an end. Although we were unaware of it at the time,
the CIA is currently defending against federal liti
gation challenging the Agency's refusal to hire gays.
And believe it or not, the ClA's key defense is that
gays present a "security risk."
As we left, we weren't exactly anxious to receive
the prize that every law student hopes for an all
expense paid fly-back for more interviews. We were
afraid our fly-back to Langley, Virginia might turn
out to be a one-way trip.

A year ago, law students at UC-Berkeley solicited
Stanford law student support for a picket protesting
CIA recruiting at the two schools. While the
Berkeley protest forced the CIA to conduct its in
terviews under federal protective custody in Oak
land, we Stanfordites chose a different method. We
figured that an effective way to register our distaste
for CIA practices and to expose their unstated poli
cy of refusing to hire homosexual citizens was to in
terview with them ourselves posing as a gay cou
ple seeking undercover assignments.
After securing the last available interview slots,
we asked the interviewer, the chief of the ClA's liti
gation department (we'll just call him the Shadow),
if we could interview together since we had mutual
questions and concerns. He agreed, reluctantly, and
ushered us in.
"What Agency legal work interests you?" the
Shadow asked.
"Well, we are only interested in covert operations
if we handled Freedom of Information requests
we'd be blacklisted from undercover work and we
want to be spies."
"What kind of covert work?" he inquired.
"Domestic intelligence," we enthused. "We'd be
very good at infiltrating leftist political groups and
disrupting them from the inside.
The Shadow cleared his throat. "You know, our
charter no longer permits us to conduct domestic
intelligence operations, so uhh . . . that might not be
possible."
"We know you say that publicly,'''' we said with a
wink, "but that will change soon." The Shadow
smiled and indicated he shared our optimism that
President Reagan will succeed in his attempt to
once again open the domestic market to the cloak
and dagger crowd.
The Shadow slowly scrutinized our resumes.
"You two have worked for a number of liberal polit
ical groups."
"Oh, yes sir," we said. "For years we have been
infiltrating various left-wing, subversive organiza
tions from the NAACP Legal Defense Fund to
Ralph Nader's organizations and other groups
which threaten national security."
The Shadow now appeared puzzled. "You mean
you didn't believe in what these people were doing?
Why did you do it?"
"You can't just walk into one of those kooky
anti-nuke groups and expect them to trust you.
