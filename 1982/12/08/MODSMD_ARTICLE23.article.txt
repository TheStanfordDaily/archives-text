## Selfish society needs new vision 
### 
In my last column I suggested that there are two
states a society can land in. One state manifests a
moral culture of selfishness, the other a moral cul
ture of cooperation. The basic idea is that coopera
tion is a raised state of society. As such it can de
generate, taking us to a ground state of non-cooper
ation, or selfishness.
If cooperation were facilitated by trust then sensi
bilities of fairness would be a natural development
under cooperation. This notion of fairness would
correspond to those ways of treating and regarding
each other that can stand up under the scrutiny of
friendship.
These ideas connect up with the notion of leader
ship in a very powerful way, that will allow me to
give hell to all the political groups I don't like. Ob
serve.
Max Weber's belief that charismatic leadership is
the source of institutions makes perfect sense in
terms of selfishness and fairness. Consider a theatre
where everyone is standing in order to see. All
would be better off if all would sit down, but none
individually wants to sit down. A central focus,
where cooperation can be organized, is needed if co
operation is to be attained. Leadership provides a
focus for the step to cooperation.
Further, Weber observed that the charismatic so
ciety was fluid and alive, melting all institutions that
would channel behavior. When charisma died the
fluidity went out of relations, and a "recrystalliza
tion" of institutions ensued.
These observations of Weber's also make sense in
terms of selfishness and fairness. Charismatic lead
ership enables cooperation, which establishes the
moral culture of fairness. Under fairness there is no
need for rules to mediate behavior since it is the na
ture of fairness that it can stand up under the
scrutiny of friendship. Recourse to levers of power
(institutions) is necessary only if one wants to vio
late fairness. On the other hand, when charisma col
lapses, taking cooperation and fairness with it (per
haps not immediately), a selfish scramble for the
levers of power results. The outcome is some
recrvstallization of institutions.
Cooperation and vision is replaced by the blind
processes of selfishness, securing one's small terri
tory and exerting dominance.
Occasionally throughout history, individuals
who found themselves in the right place, or who
learned to stroke some yearning cooperative sensi
bility, have been able to make themselves a focus for
cooperation. They have become charismatic lead
ers.
The reason the history of charismatic leadership
has often been ugly is that charisma has often been
based on evocative gestures that move people
(shortcuts) rather than on substantive under
standing. Consider some examples.
The most obvious shortcut is militarism, which
paints a sweep of history and warns of enemies to
our precious goal, all keying into our natural desire
to be a part of a vigorous society that has a sense of
itself and is going somewhere.
Another shortcut is religion, keying into our de

sire for emotional depth by viewing every pretty
thing as dashed with god's love. Or keying into our
desire for communication and oneness with others
bv imagining a God the father who will hear what
ever fills our heart in prayer. Or, less attractively,
keying into our desire for conformity by bran
dishing good and evil.
The emotional appeal of "shortcuts" is not to be
denigrated. It comes from us, and even from our
better side, however perversely it can be twisted.
The hope is that we can get away from dema
goguerv and its absolutism by demanding sub
stance rather than show. The classical liberal posi
tion has been to eschew individual leadership entire
ly and invest leadership in competing views of the
substantive requirements of society. Thus early
U.S. presidents considered themselves executors of
a political platform, and declined any charismatic
role, except under extreme condition.
The degeneration of the party system reflects our
fall from grace, replacing vision (the vision that we
are a republic struggling for vision) with the narrow
competing interests of selfishness (a recrystalliza
tion of selfish process).
To fill this gap, the modern era has accepted the
idea of a charismatic president. This is not necessar
ily illiberal, as long as the leader conveys an under
standing, and his following is an affirmation of that
understanding. Look what we've got though: Presi
dent Reagan.
Reagan is all evocative gestures and no sub
stance. He literally understands nothing. Even his
economic program can only be sensibly interpreted
in terms of a "great American spirit" that govern
ment must be quashing, since we don't see it ev
erywhere. Government is tagged the villain, imped
ing our vigorous forward marching society.
It is quite an irony; to think that the answer to our
petty selfish condition (our failure of spirit) is to em
brace our collapse into selfishness, as the right does
with its championing of social Darwinism.
The Democrats, however inept and inadequate,
at least have been sincere in undertaking a serious
search for the requirements of society.
The most illuminating comparison is between lib
ertarianism and anarchism. Both reject governmen
tal coercion, but for opposite reasons. Liber
tarianism rejects government within a context of
selfishness, championing social Darwinism. Anar
chism rejects government within a context of coop
eration. It basically says: "None of us are jerks. We
don't need force to keep us from acting in ways that
â€”-ild not stand the scrutiny of friendship."
The anarchist position might be easy enough to
swallow when applied to friends, but it gets difficult
when we move to society at large. But this is only
because we live in a selfish society. A moral culture
of cooperation would replace the blindness of self
ishness with a vision of society. How we contribute
to the efforts of society as a whole becomes impor
tant to us, and we are deprived of including
ourselves in that vision when we place selfishness
above fairness.

tion of selfish process).
To fill this gap, the modern era has accepted the
idea of a charismatic president. This is not necessar
ily illiberal, as long as the leader conveys an under
standing, and his following is an affirmation of that
understanding. Look what we've got though: Presi
dent Reagan.
Reagan is all evocative gestures and no sub
stance. He literally understands nothing. Even his
economic program can only be sensibly interpreted
in terms of a "great American spirit" that govern
ment must be quashing, since we don't see it ev
erywhere. Government is tagged the villain, imped
ing our vigorous forward marching society.
It is quite an irony; to think that the answer to our
petty selfish condition (our failure of spirit) is to em
brace our collapse into selfishness, as the right does
with its championing of social Darwinism.
The Democrats, however inept and inadequate,
at least have been sincere in undertaking a serious
search for the requirements of society.
The most illuminating comparison is between lib
ertarianism and anarchism. Both reject governmen
tal coercion, but for opposite reasons. Liber
tarianism rejects government within a context of
selfishness, championing social Darwinism. Anar
chism rejects government within a context of coop
eration. It basically says: "None of us are jerks. We
don't need force to keep us from acting in ways that
â€”-ild not stand the scrutiny of friendship."
The anarchist position might be easy enough to
swallow when applied to friends, but it gets difficult
when we move to society at large. But this is only
because we live in a selfish society. A moral culture
of cooperation would replace the blindness of self
ishness with a vision of society. How we contribute
to the efforts of society as a whole becomes impor
tant to us, and we are deprived of including
ourselves in that vision when we place selfishness
above fairness.

In my last column I suggested that there are two
states a society can land in. One state manifests a
moral culture of selfishness, the other a moral cul
ture of cooperation. The basic idea is that coopera
tion is a raised state of society. As such it can de
generate, taking us to a ground state of non-cooper
ation, or selfishness.
If cooperation were facilitated by trust then sensi
bilities of fairness would be a natural development
under cooperation. This notion of fairness would
correspond to those ways of treating and regarding
each other that can stand up under the scrutiny of
friendship.
These ideas connect up with the notion of leader
ship in a very powerful way, that will allow me to
give hell to all the political groups I don't like. Ob
serve.
Max Weber's belief that charismatic leadership is
the source of institutions makes perfect sense in
terms of selfishness and fairness. Consider a theatre
where everyone is standing in order to see. All
would be better off if all would sit down, but none
individually wants to sit down. A central focus,
where cooperation can be organized, is needed if co
operation is to be attained. Leadership provides a
focus for the step to cooperation.
Further, Weber observed that the charismatic so
ciety was fluid and alive, melting all institutions that
would channel behavior. When charisma died the
fluidity went out of relations, and a "recrystalliza
tion" of institutions ensued.
These observations of Weber's also make sense in
terms of selfishness and fairness. Charismatic lead
ership enables cooperation, which establishes the
moral culture of fairness. Under fairness there is no
need for rules to mediate behavior since it is the na
ture of fairness that it can stand up under the
scrutiny of friendship. Recourse to levers of power
(institutions) is necessary only if one wants to vio
late fairness. On the other hand, when charisma col
lapses, taking cooperation and fairness with it (per
haps not immediately), a selfish scramble for the
levers of power results. The outcome is some
recrvstallization of institutions.
Cooperation and vision is replaced by the blind
processes of selfishness, securing one's small terri
tory and exerting dominance.
Occasionally throughout history, individuals
who found themselves in the right place, or who
learned to stroke some yearning cooperative sensi
bility, have been able to make themselves a focus for
cooperation. They have become charismatic lead
ers.
The reason the history of charismatic leadership
has often been ugly is that charisma has often been
based on evocative gestures that move people
(shortcuts) rather than on substantive under
standing. Consider some examples.
The most obvious shortcut is militarism, which
paints a sweep of history and warns of enemies to
our precious goal, all keying into our natural desire
to be a part of a vigorous society that has a sense of
itself and is going somewhere.
Another shortcut is religion, keying into our de

sire for emotional depth by viewing every pretty
thing as dashed with god's love. Or keying into our
desire for communication and oneness with others
bv imagining a God the father who will hear what
ever fills our heart in prayer. Or, less attractively,
keying into our desire for conformity by bran
dishing good and evil.
The emotional appeal of "shortcuts" is not to be
denigrated. It comes from us, and even from our
better side, however perversely it can be twisted.
The hope is that we can get away from dema
goguerv and its absolutism by demanding sub
stance rather than show. The classical liberal posi
tion has been to eschew individual leadership entire
ly and invest leadership in competing views of the
substantive requirements of society. Thus early
U.S. presidents considered themselves executors of
a political platform, and declined any charismatic
role, except under extreme condition.
The degeneration of the party system reflects our
fall from grace, replacing vision (the vision that we
are a republic struggling for vision) with the narrow
competing interests of selfishness (a recrystalliza
tion of selfish process).
