# Humanities Center program provides research opportunities
## 
### KATHERINE HUTT Staff writer 
Stanford's new Humanities Center, now in its
first year, does not want the ivory tower image trad
itionally associated with such organizations.
The Center "was not meant to be an isolated re
search center for scholars," according to Associate
Director Mort Sosna, but rather to "have a connec
tion with the larger life of the University."
One of the ways in which the Center hopes to ac
complish this is through its fellowship program,
which offers scholars from inside and outside the
University a year to do research, and also requires
that they spend a sixth of their time contributing to
the intellectual life of the Stanford community.
This provision is unique among humanities cen
ters in the United States, said Sosna, who came to
his position here after nine years as a program of
ficer at the National Endowment for the Human
ities in Washington, D.C.
Each of this year's three fellows from outside the
University is currently teaching a class for under
graduates. In addition, "They are being encouraged
to teach in some innovative or new way," according
to Center Director lan Watt.
For example, he cited Gwendolyn Wright's mul
ti-disciplinary course called "Architecture, Plan
ning and Politics in the 19th and 20th Centuries."
Another unusual aspect about Stanford's Hu
manities Center, said Sosna, is that it has graduate
students as regular fellows. Of the 14 fellows this
year, five are graduate students here in the human
ities. While faculty members hold the fellowships
for only one year, the students have the option of
being a fellow for two years.
The University's new Center is the result of what
Watt describes as "a long record of earlier efforts"
to strengthen the humanities at Stanford. It was
first conceived in the winter of 1980 by a small
group of professors here who "felt that the human
ities did not get their share both the teaching and
the research," according to Watt.
One of these professors spoke to then-Provost
Donald Kennedy, who suggested that they form a
committee. They did, and when soon afterward
Kennedy became president of the University he de
cided to act upon their recommendations to form
the Center.
Kennedy also pledged to strengthen the human
ities in his inauguration speech. "He has made the
humanities at Stanford a priority in this decade,"
said Sosna, when "there is a general tendency
throughout American higher education for more
professionally oriented education."
The general aim of the Humanities Center, as
stated in its brochure, is "to promote humanistic
studies and interests" at the University. It proposes
to do this in three ways: through the fellowship pro
gram, by strengthening humanistic teaching here,
and by conducting studies of problems in the area of

the humanities.
According to Sosna, the primary emphasis this
first year is on the fellowship program, and the Cen
ter hasn't had much time to devote to sponsoring
programs or conducting studies.
Before the Center can do anything else, however,
it must get more money, according to Watt. It is
mostly supported by external funds gifts and
grants that the Center and the University working
together have raised. Kennedy and Watt have
played a major part in the fund-raising effort.
"Though we've been at it two years, we've only
begun our basic fundraising drive," Watt said. He
added, however, that whereas a year ago the Center
had no money, it now has $1.5 million. He predicted
that they will raise another $250,000 this year.
Another important step for the Center is its re
location next spring in permanent quarters in Rog
ers and Mariposa Houses. It currently operates out
of Watts' office in the Quad.
Asked to comment on the low rankings of the
University's humanities departments in a recent
survey, Watt said that he wasn't surprised. He ex
plained that the rankings are based on what the pro
fessors who did them know of the other universities,
and this usually comes from the books and articles
put out by its faculty.
"Stanford, by its emphasis on teaching, may be
preventing its younger faculty from becoming fa
mous by writing books," he added.
Watt said that the Humanities Center could not
singlehandedly change the ratings of the depart
ments, but that improvements must be made in oth
er areas such as salaries, sabbaticals and teaching
loads.
"If it's going to have any effect, it will be to allow
people to do their own research," he said. He
added, "In five years, a good many of the human
ities faculty will know members of other humanities
departments."
