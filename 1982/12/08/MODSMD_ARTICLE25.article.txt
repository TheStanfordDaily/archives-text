# Ham radio: not just for nerds anymore
## 
### JEFF CAIN 
Ham radio is "a hobby you
can get totally engulfed in,"
according to Stuart Neu
barth, president of the Stan
ford Amateur Radio Club.
And if the term "radio club"
evokes images of 1950s high
school students with glasses,
think again there are over
420,000 hams in the United
States today, using the most
sophisticated equipment
available.

Open to all Stanford stu
dents, faculty, staff and alum
ni, the club here requires an
amateur radio license for
membership, but holds classes
nearly every quarter to help
people get their licenses. Dues
of $5 per month entitle the 50
members to use the club's two
short-wave radios and its sat
ellite hookup.

Rather than being a rem
nant from the 'sos, the radio
club is on the leading edge of
communications technology.
The members recently in
stalled a new radio and anten
na which allow them to reach
the satellites sent up by in
ternational ham radio or
ganizations. Although these
first satellites only enable the
club to reach locations in the
United States, they are far
more efficient than the older
method of short wave, which
bounces signals off the
ionosphere and around the

world. Next year a new satel
lite will establish contact with
the entire Northern Hemi
sphere, and within a few years
hams will easily be able to talk
to anywhere in the world. Ac
cording to Neubarth, "satel
lites are the future of amateur
radio."
The club receives most of its
equipment through donations
from corporations. Harry
Mackler, a visiting scholar
from the University of Toron
to, who does much of the or
ganization for the club, calls
or writes the presidents of
companies and asks them to
send hardware. The club is
fortunate in this respect to
have as its trustee Electrical
Engineering Prof. Mike Vil
lard. Because he invented
many of the circuits used in
today's radios, Villard's name
carries considerable prestige,
Neubarth said. I
Although the majors of the '
members who use all this
equipment vary, about half of
the students are in electrical
engineering. However, ac
cording to Neubarth, "we're
not all nerds." Neubarth is an
electrical engineering major,
but he only entered the field
because he was a ham. Most
people pick up the hobby be
cause they enjoy "being able
to pick up the radio and talk
to someone from New Zea
land," Neubarth said. Club
members have contacted
places as far away as Argen
tina, Japan and the Soviet
Union.
Currently, the club mem
bers are working on two ma
jor projects: attempting to
persuade a company to give
them a computer, and or
ganizing the club's alumni
members. A computer would
enable the club to predict the
positions of satellites and to
log contacts made in "contest
ing" (one of the main ac
tivities of hams is to have con
tests to see who can contact
the most people in a 48-hour
period). Moreover, recent law
changes have made it legal to

transmit data on the amateur
bands, so the club could use
its computer to send elec
tronic mail or to receive news.
The organization of alumni
members is a potentially prof
itable project for the club. Be
cause many companies recruit
the engineering students from
the radio club, many ex-mem
bers are now in large com
puter firms, perhaps the most
prominent of these being Bob
Hewlett. According to Neu
barth, "we have a gold mine
here in Silicon Valley." The
club has been in existence for
50 years, and Neubarth is cer
tain that some of the former
members will be able to help
the club now.
One reason for the popu
larity of ham radio is that all
types of people can get in
volved; it's not only for those
who are technically inclined.
A ham from Palo Alto can
meet one who is a farmer in
the Midwest. Even in the
Stanford club alone, Neu
barth said he is "amazed at
the diversity of the member

ship."
The non-technical mem
bers of the club organize con
tests and events while the oth
ers build antennas. And the
others do build. "A large facet
of the hobby is construction,"
Neubarth said. He built a de
vice which relays the club tele
phone to the walkie-talkie he
carries around. As prices for
high quality radios go down,
however, the trend is away
from constructing one's own
equipment.
The club does more than
simply provide the members
with a radio, though. It holds
weekly meetings on the air, as
most members own a radio or
walkie-talkie. The club also
has regular meetings once a
month, at which time the
members discuss business
such as needed additions to
the station and upcoming
contests. Members also occa
sionally hold parties at the
station or Villard's house, and
often have "work parties" to
induce the members to work
on the equipment..

students from the

most members own a radio or
walkie-talkie. The club also
has regular meetings once a
month, at which time the
members discuss business
such as needed additions to
the station and upcoming
contests. Members also occa
sionally hold parties at the
station or Villard's house, and
often have "work parties" to
induce the members to work
on the equipment..

Because many
companies recruit
the engineering
students from the
radio club, many
ex-members are
now in large
computerfirms,
perhaps the most
prominent of these
being Bob Hewlett.

Ham radio is "a hobby you
can get totally engulfed in,"
according to Stuart Neu
barth, president of the Stan
ford Amateur Radio Club.
And if the term "radio club"
evokes images of 1950s high
school students with glasses,
think again there are over
420,000 hams in the United
States today, using the most
sophisticated equipment
available.

Open to all Stanford stu
dents, faculty, staff and alum
ni, the club here requires an
amateur radio license for
membership, but holds classes
nearly every quarter to help
people get their licenses. Dues
of $5 per month entitle the 50
members to use the club's two
short-wave radios and its sat
ellite hookup.

Rather than being a rem
nant from the 'sos, the radio
club is on the leading edge of
communications technology.
The members recently in
stalled a new radio and anten
na which allow them to reach
the satellites sent up by in
ternational ham radio or
ganizations. Although these
first satellites only enable the
club to reach locations in the
United States, they are far
more efficient than the older
method of short wave, which
bounces signals off the
ionosphere and around the

world. Next year a new satel
lite will establish contact with
the entire Northern Hemi
sphere, and within a few years
hams will easily be able to talk
to anywhere in the world. Ac
cording to Neubarth, "satel
lites are the future of amateur
radio."
The club receives most of its
equipment through donations
from corporations. Harry
Mackler, a visiting scholar
from the University of Toron
to, who does much of the or
ganization for the club, calls
or writes the presidents of
companies and asks them to
send hardware. The club is
fortunate in this respect to
have as its trustee Electrical
Engineering Prof. Mike Vil
lard. Because he invented
many of the circuits used in
today's radios, Villard's name
carries considerable prestige,
Neubarth said. I
Although the majors of the '
members who use all this
equipment vary, about half of
the students are in electrical
engineering. However, ac
cording to Neubarth, "we're
not all nerds." Neubarth is an
electrical engineering major,
but he only entered the field
because he was a ham. Most
people pick up the hobby be
cause they enjoy "being able
to pick up the radio and talk
to someone from New Zea
land," Neubarth said. Club
members have contacted
places as far away as Argen
tina, Japan and the Soviet
Union.
Currently, the club mem
bers are working on two ma
jor projects: attempting to
persuade a company to give
them a computer, and or
ganizing the club's alumni
members. A computer would
enable the club to predict the
positions of satellites and to
log contacts made in "contest
ing" (one of the main ac
tivities of hams is to have con
tests to see who can contact
the most people in a 48-hour
period). Moreover, recent law
changes have made it legal to

transmit data on the amateur
bands, so the club could use
its computer to send elec
tronic mail or to receive news.
The organization of alumni
members is a potentially prof
itable project for the club. Be
cause many companies recruit
the engineering students from
the radio club, many ex-mem
bers are now in large com
puter firms, perhaps the most
prominent of these being Bob
Hewlett. According to Neu
barth, "we have a gold mine
here in Silicon Valley." The
club has been in existence for
50 years, and Neubarth is cer
tain that some of the former
members will be able to help
the club now.
One reason for the popu
larity of ham radio is that all
types of people can get in
volved; it's not only for those
who are technically inclined.
A ham from Palo Alto can
meet one who is a farmer in
the Midwest. Even in the
Stanford club alone, Neu
barth said he is "amazed at
the diversity of the member

ship."
The non-technical mem
bers of the club organize con
tests and events while the oth
ers build antennas. And the
others do build. "A large facet
of the hobby is construction,"
Neubarth said. He built a de
vice which relays the club tele
phone to the walkie-talkie he
carries around. As prices for
high quality radios go down,
however, the trend is away
from constructing one's own
equipment.
The club does more than
simply provide the members
with a radio, though. It holds

walkie-talkie. The club also
