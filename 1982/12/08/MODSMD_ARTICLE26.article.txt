# Barrio Assistance program links Stanford with underprivileged
## 
### STEVE KAUFMAN Staff writer 
To the casual passerby, the
candles lining the entrance to
Hammarskjold House last Fri
day night may have seemed like a
belated Halloween celebration.
However, for the 30 or so chil
dren inside, the celebration was
probably the most celebrating
they will experience this holiday
season.
The luminarias, or special
Mexican candles, were part of a
special customary celebration by
Mexican people called Las
Posadas, which commemorates
the journey of Joseph and Mary

into Bethlehem. Although the
celebration is in and of itself
beautiful, the atmosphere in
Hammarskjold was especially
warm and inviting.
The children attending the par
ty were participants in Barrio As
sistance, a program at Stanford
designed to aid the under
privileged children in the poor
areas of East Palo Alto and
Menlo Park.
"Kids are the hope of the
future," said sophomore Bonni
Waller, one of the coordinators
for the party. "The beauty of this
program is that we give them a
chance to see an alternate side of
life which they otherwise may

never have the opportunity to
see."
The Barrio Assistance pro
gram at Stanford has been help
ing underprivileged children with
education and food for the last
eleven years. Student volunteers
give two hours each Saturday
morning to tutor one student in
English, math and other subjects,
as well as help raise funds to buy
food for poor families near the
Stanford community. Special
events, like Las Posadas, are also
part of the program's activities.
"I like the cake the best,"
commented Rafaela Gonzalez,

The shy 11-year-old held the col
oring book which she received as
a present that evening, and said
that she was having a good time.
Her companion Elvia
Gonzalez, also 11, tended to
agree that one of the high points
of the party was the special cake.
She also received a gift from the
program, her own copy of The
Little Prince, and commented
that she liked her tutor, Deanna
Flores. "She is a very good teach
er," she said.
Flores, a sophomore, felt that
Barrio Assistance helps to break
the barriers which prevent many
of the voung children from reach

ing their full potential. "Often
times, it is just a case of not being
able to speak English as well as
their fellow students," she said.
"The real tragedy is that people
then label such children as under
achieves, and they never are giv
en the chance to overcome their
handicap." She added that the
program at Stanford, through
the one-on-one tutor system, al
lows the children to catch up on
their English more quickly than if
they were in a classroom situ
ation.
Instruction is held at El Centro
Chicano, the Chicano center lo
cated in Old Union. Each Satur
day morning students and teach
ers assemble for two hours of
learning. The first hour is nor
mally devoted to English, match
and reading, with each student
working individually with a
tutor. In the second hour, the
group assembles together for
some type of group activity. The
group currently gives assistance
to 28 children.
The program also sponsors
outside events, including camp
ing, roller skating, pumpkin
hunting in Palo Alto and trips to
the movies. "We are a growing
program," said senior Debora
Ortega, a three-year volunteer in
Barrio Assistance. Ortega said
that one of the more successful
events this year was the
Thanksgiving food drive, where
the group collects funds, buys
food and distributes it randomly
to needy families.
Volunteers in the program en
joy the personl contact which
comes with tutoring the students.
"It's the little things that make it
all worthwhile," commented
freshmam Kim Card. "When
you teach one of your students a
word, and he comes to the next
section and uses it correctly, it re
ally makes you feel good."
"We are trying to build self
esteem and self-confidence in the
kids," said Phil Baca, a 1982
Stanford graduate who remains
involved in the program. "By
helping the children to believe in
themselves, we can help them to
achieve more than they otherwise
may not be able to. After all,
that's where it all starts."

Little Prince, and commented
that she liked her tutor, Deanna
Flores. "She is a very good teach
er," she said.
Flores, a sophomore, felt that
Barrio Assistance helps to break
the barriers which prevent many
of the voung children from reach

ing their full potential. "Often
times, it is just a case of not being
able to speak English as well as
their fellow students," she said.
"The real tragedy is that people
then label such children as under
achieves, and they never are giv
en the chance to overcome their
handicap." She added that the
program at Stanford, through
the one-on-one tutor system, al
lows the children to catch up on
their English more quickly than if
they were in a classroom situ
ation.
Instruction is held at El Centro
Chicano, the Chicano center lo
cated in Old Union. Each Satur
day morning students and teach
ers assemble for two hours of
learning. The first hour is nor
mally devoted to English, match
and reading, with each student
working individually with a
tutor. In the second hour, the
group assembles together for
some type of group activity. The
group currently gives assistance
to 28 children.
The program also sponsors
outside events, including camp
ing, roller skating, pumpkin
hunting in Palo Alto and trips to
the movies. "We are a growing
program," said senior Debora
Ortega, a three-year volunteer in
Barrio Assistance. Ortega said
that one of the more successful
events this year was the
Thanksgiving food drive, where
the group collects funds, buys
food and distributes it randomly
to needy families.
Volunteers in the program en
joy the personl contact which
comes with tutoring the students.
"It's the little things that make it
all worthwhile," commented
freshmam Kim Card. "When
you teach one of your students a
word, and he comes to the next
section and uses it correctly, it re
ally makes you feel good."
"We are trying to build self
esteem and self-confidence in the
kids," said Phil Baca, a 1982
Stanford graduate who remains
involved in the program. "By
helping the children to believe in
themselves, we can help them to
achieve more than they otherwise
may not be able to. After all,
that's where it all starts."

To the casual passerby, the
candles lining the entrance to
Hammarskjold House last Fri
day night may have seemed like a
belated Halloween celebration.
However, for the 30 or so chil
dren inside, the celebration was
probably the most celebrating
they will experience this holiday
season.
The luminarias, or special
Mexican candles, were part of a
special customary celebration by
Mexican people called Las
Posadas, which commemorates
the journey of Joseph and Mary

into Bethlehem. Although the
celebration is in and of itself
beautiful, the atmosphere in
Hammarskjold was especially
warm and inviting.
The children attending the par
ty were participants in Barrio As
sistance, a program at Stanford
designed to aid the under
privileged children in the poor
areas of East Palo Alto and
Menlo Park.
"Kids are the hope of the
future," said sophomore Bonni
Waller, one of the coordinators
for the party. "The beauty of this
program is that we give them a
chance to see an alternate side of
life which they otherwise may

never have the opportunity to
see."
The Barrio Assistance pro
gram at Stanford has been help
ing underprivileged children with
education and food for the last
eleven years. Student volunteers
give two hours each Saturday
morning to tutor one student in
English, math and other subjects,
as well as help raise funds to buy
food for poor families near the
Stanford community. Special
events, like Las Posadas, are also
part of the program's activities.
"I like the cake the best,"
commented Rafaela Gonzalez,

The shy 11-year-old held the col
oring book which she received as
a present that evening, and said
that she was having a good time.
Her companion Elvia
Gonzalez, also 11, tended to
agree that one of the high points
of the party was the special cake.
She also received a gift from the
program, her own copy of The
Little Prince, and commented
that she liked her tutor, Deanna
Flores. "She is a very good teach
er," she said.
