# Tresidder's video game giveaway
## 
### CHRIS BUTCHKO 
Capping off two weeks of
suspense, Tresidder Union
Recreation Center held the
drawing for its Asteroids
video game giveaway last
Wednesday.

Manager Cheryl St. Clair
mixed up the contents of the
cardboard box holding a little
more than 1000 entries prior
to the drawing. Next, pinset
ter mechanic Gordon Baker,
who didn't enter the contest
himself but admitted that his
girlfriend had an entry he
wouldn't have been sorry to
pull out, reached his hand in
and closed it on one lucky per
son's ticket.
Of all the entries, Baker
pulled out Joan MacKenzie's.
St. Clair saw justice in this.
"At least she's a bowler a
regular customer." In a draw
ing open to the whole com
munity, there had to be some
kind of solace in the notion
that the winner actually hung
around the center for a while
before taking the game home.
What about the game? For
those unfamiliar with video
games. Asteroids is one of the
first and most successful
games ever; it depicts the bat
tle of a small wedge-shaped
ship against the rest of the uni
verse. The ship blasts rocks

floating by into smaller and
eventually non-existent
pieces, and is occasionally
menaced by two varieties of
enemy ships that sprint across
the screen.
Real life is not so simply
motivated. What, after all, led
the Rec Center to give away
the machine in a free contest?

It's been done before, asserted
St. Clair, but not for two
years, and this was the first
video game that has been giv
en away. Pinball machines
were the prizes of an earlier
era.
"The company that owns
the machines gives them to us
to give away," St. Clair said.

She added that Automatic
Merchandising of San Jose
might be using the contest as a
tax write-off, or might just be
trying to get some publicity
for the operators.
"They offered us the choice
of giving away a Tempest ma
chine or the Asteroids.
They're just trying to keep up
with the machines that are
coming out. We're the first
ones to get the new ma
chines," St. Clair said.
"I want to stress the fact
that the drawing was open to
the whole community," she
said. She added they kept the
drawing "as legitimate as pos
sible I don't think anyone
stuffed the box. We kept pret
ty close tabs on it."
Despite the loss of the
Asteroids game, Tresidder is
not selling out to close up. The
Tresidder employees are going
to put in a 36-foot wall
through the center of the
game room, and the wall will
be lined with about 12 new
machines.


AND THE WINNER IS: Cheryl St. Clair
holds up the box of entries to Tresidder
Union's Asteroids giveaway. The drawing

Was field to give away a stand-up Asteroids
video game to one lucky person. Fifty people
a day entered the drawing.


THE TENSION MOUNTS: As the time
drew nearer to the drawing, the crowd, estimated
by some to number as many as 10,
held its breath in anticipation. Disappointment

Robert Woolsey/Daily
reigned later, as the winner was not
present, and had indeed put down the wrong
phone number.
