# I-Center Holiday House a home-away-from-home
## 
### MARK ZEIGLER 
Going home for Christmas
and other holidays during
winter break is a routine affair
for most Stanford students.
But for others, especially for
eign graduate students, home
may be on the other side of the
globe.
In an effort to provide a
"home-away-from-home,"
the Bechtel International
Center hosts and sponsors a
slew of events during winter
break called Holiday House.
The two-week program's
calendar of events ranges
from an intimate evening with
chamber music and tea to a
full-fledged New Year's Eve
party, to a trip to Half Moon
Bay. Holiday House is in its
fourth year, according to I-
Center Program Coordinator
Penny Thorp.

"Many graduate students
stay here (over the break),"
Thorp said, "especially for
eign graduate students." Al
though Holiday House was
designed with the needs of
these students in mind, it is
not only for them.
"It (Holiday House) was
originated as a home-away
from-home or just a bright
spot on the campus," she said,
pointing out that many uni
versity offices and services are
closed during the two-week
quarter break.

Thorp, who aids Holiday
House Coordinator Chitra
Subramanian in scheduling
the activities, said that 1982 is
the first year that the program
has operated without the co
sponsorship of Tresidder.
"But we are receiving
suuport from Graduate Stud
ies and Residential Educa
tion," she added.
The total of 21 events kicks
off on Dec. 18 with Family
Festival Day from 2 to 5 p.m.,
which involves tree trimming
and crafts, and ends on Jan. 2
with a Sunday Supper.
Besides the usual line-up of
parties, dinners and trips,
Holiday House features a few
new events this year. Among
those is an International
Bazaar on Dec. 22, and a day
trip to Half Moon Bay a week
later. Holiday House will also
co-sponsor Christmas carol
ing with Escondido Village
two days before Christmas.
Other events include folk
dancing, silent movies, a
walking tour ofSan Francisco
and a trip to the Monterey-
Carmel area. Although most
of the events are free, a few of
the trips and dinners cost
money.
Attendance at Holiday
House events varies according
to the activity, Thorp said.

tracts between 150 and 200
people, while 50 attended the
Chamber Music last year, ac

Besides the Holiday House
events, Thorp noted that the
l-Center would be open daily
during the break, and that the
center's television, lounge,
ping-pong and pool table
would be available.
