# Election reform delayed; graduate senator resigns
## 
### STEVE TROUSDALE Staff writer 
A major ASSU bill on election re
form, up for senate consideration last
night, suffered a major reversal when it
was recommitted to the ASSU rules
committee.
Recommission of a bill involves sub
mitting it for reconsideration to the
committee which originally forwarded
it to the senate.
Senator James McGrath, one of the
three authors of the bill and the person
who moved to send it back to commit
tee, commented that "it was getting to
the point where people were trying to
rewrite the bill on the floor."
"I was sort of upset that the rules
committee's work (on the bill) wasn't
used," he said.
In another move, one that surprised
senate chair Raga Elim, senator Larry
Ausubel resigned from the senate.
In a prepared speech he read in the
open forum that takes place before ev
ery senate meeting, Ausubel attacked
the senate for being "totally unwilling
to explore any innovative ideas which
might benefit students," and "hard
pressed to cite a single meaningful ac
tion it has undertaken in the past half
year" but tempered his remarks by ac
knowledging that there were several
senators "who honestly do care."
Elim countered that he felt that there
was some good done by the senate, and
commented that he believed people
should try to change problems instead
of "copping out" on them.

Debate on the election reform bill
centered on three issues. One was a sur
charge that was to be levied on student
groups seeking a special fee assessment.
The surcharge, which in the bill was 3.5
percent of the amount authorized for
collection by the ASSU, was criticized
for asking groups seeking fee
assessments to pay the bulk of the costs
associated with an election that also in
volves the senate and the council of
presidents. Under this proposed system
the ASSU would pay 20 percent of the
costs of an election, while this surcharge
would provide 80 percent of this mon
ey.
McGrath said that such an im
balance was justified because greater
election costs were associated with fee
assessment groups. Senator Mike
Reeds, another author of the bill, added
that "the surcharge will save the ASSU
money."
Eric Berg, treasurer of the Graduate
Student Association, commented that
this imbalance would impose a dis
proportionate amount of the costs of an
election on those groups seeking fee
assessments, because they would not
represent 80 percent of the issues in an
election. He based this assumption on
the number and types of issues in last
spring's election.
However, a move by senator Anjur
Krishnakumar to reduce this surcharge
from 3.5 percent to 2 percent failed.
The second major issue of contention
involved the ordering of candidates on
election materials. Senator Andy Mess
ing said that he disagreed with the way
in which the bill did this alphabetically,
and suggested that a random order be
used. Senator Joseph Hughes, one of
the sponsors of the bill, defended the or
iginal bill's idea because alphabetiza
tion, he said, allows voters to find
names on the ballot.
Messing pointed out that several of
the ten top vote-getting senators had
names that began with the letters A-D.
(In fact, of the ten top-ranked senators,
six had last names beginning with the
letters A-D).
The senate eventually voted to have
the elections commission randomly
select a letter of the alphabet and then
begin the names of the senators
alphabetically beginning with this let

ter. This applies only to the ballots; all
election materials would alphabetize
the names starting with "A."
The third issue, which eventually led
to the bill being recommitted, involved
write-in candidates. Although an
amendment to the bill would have al
lowed write-in candidates, they would
have only been able to run if they had
informed the elections commission of
their intent to do so before the opening
of the polls.
Graduate senator Marian Smith said
she felt that this would unfairly hurt
graduate representation in the senate,
citing the fact that she and several other
current graduate senators had been
write-in candidates.
After senators passed an amendment
by Smith, which allowed write-in can
didates to declare their candidacy after
they were elected, McGrath moved to
have the entire bill recommitted to the
senate rules committee. This motion
also passed.

assessment groups. Senator Mike
Reeds, another author of the bill, added
that "the surcharge will save the ASSU
money."
Eric Berg, treasurer of the Graduate
Student Association, commented that
this imbalance would impose a dis
proportionate amount of the costs of an
election on those groups seeking fee
assessments, because they would not
represent 80 percent of the issues in an
election. He based this assumption on
the number and types of issues in last
spring's election.
However, a move by senator Anjur
Krishnakumar to reduce this surcharge
from 3.5 percent to 2 percent failed.
The second major issue of contention
involved the ordering of candidates on
election materials. Senator Andy Mess
ing said that he disagreed with the way
in which the bill did this alphabetically,
and suggested that a random order be
used. Senator Joseph Hughes, one of
the sponsors of the bill, defended the or
iginal bill's idea because alphabetiza
tion, he said, allows voters to find
names on the ballot.
Messing pointed out that several of
the ten top vote-getting senators had
names that began with the letters A-D.
(In fact, of the ten top-ranked senators,
six had last names beginning with the
letters A-D).
The senate eventually voted to have
the elections commission randomly
select a letter of the alphabet and then
begin the names of the senators
alphabetically beginning with this let

ter. This applies only to the ballots; all
election materials would alphabetize
the names starting with "A."
The third issue, which eventually led
to the bill being recommitted, involved
write-in candidates. Although an
amendment to the bill would have al
lowed write-in candidates, they would
have only been able to run if they had
informed the elections commission of
their intent to do so before the opening
of the polls.
Graduate senator Marian Smith said
she felt that this would unfairly hurt
graduate representation in the senate,
citing the fact that she and several other
current graduate senators had been
write-in candidates.
After senators passed an amendment
by Smith, which allowed write-in can
didates to declare their candidacy after
they were elected, McGrath moved to
have the entire bill recommitted to the
senate rules committee. This motion
also passed.
A major ASSU bill on election re
form, up for senate consideration last
night, suffered a major reversal when it
was recommitted to the ASSU rules
committee.
Recommission of a bill involves sub
mitting it for reconsideration to the
committee which originally forwarded
it to the senate.
Senator James McGrath, one of the
three authors of the bill and the person
who moved to send it back to commit
tee, commented that "it was getting to
the point where people were trying to
rewrite the bill on the floor."
"I was sort of upset that the rules
committee's work (on the bill) wasn't
used," he said.
In another move, one that surprised
senate chair Raga Elim, senator Larry
Ausubel resigned from the senate.
In a prepared speech he read in the
open forum that takes place before ev
ery senate meeting, Ausubel attacked
the senate for being "totally unwilling
to explore any innovative ideas which
might benefit students," and "hard
pressed to cite a single meaningful ac
tion it has undertaken in the past half
year" but tempered his remarks by ac
knowledging that there were several
senators "who honestly do care."
Elim countered that he felt that there
was some good done by the senate, and
commented that he believed people
should try to change problems instead
of "copping out" on them.

Debate on the election reform bill
centered on three issues. One was a sur
charge that was to be levied on student
groups seeking a special fee assessment.
The surcharge, which in the bill was 3.5
percent of the amount authorized for
collection by the ASSU, was criticized
for asking groups seeking fee
assessments to pay the bulk of the costs
associated with an election that also in
volves the senate and the council of
presidents. Under this proposed system
the ASSU would pay 20 percent of the
costs of an election, while this surcharge
would provide 80 percent of this mon
ey.
McGrath said that such an im
balance was justified because greater
election costs were associated with fee
assessment groups. Senator Mike
Reeds, another author of the bill, added
that "the surcharge will save the ASSU
money."
Eric Berg, treasurer of the Graduate
Student Association, commented that
