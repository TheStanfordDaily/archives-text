# Maderathon race dubbed a success

The inhabitants of Madera House saw
the culmination of weeks of preparation
Sunday morning with the successful pres
entation of the Second Annual
Maderathon, a 10-kilometer run which
benefited the Peninsula Children's Center
(PCC).
"We try in Madera House to do some
thing unusual that gives the students the
opportunity to get involved with the com
munity a chance for giving," said
Kathleen Namphy, Madera's resident fel
low.
The Madera residents pooled their
physical and creative capacities in solic
iting sponsors for the race, publicizing the
event and learning about the PCC.
The last week's activities included a 6
a.m. run to the Dish with University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy to publicize the up
coming race a venture that 40 students
got up for, but that only a few were able to
finish. Madera residents also carried their
publicity message to other residences here
and solicited support from local stores.

Madera held meetings about the techni
calities of the race itself, including learning
the course.
"It really helped pull the dorm togeth
er," said Madera Resident Assistant Eric
Wendlandt, "especially this last week."
But the central idea of giving to the PCC
was never lost on these workers.
"We researched places to which we
could donate our proceeds," Wendlandt
said. "PCC was ideal because it's some
thing we can follow through on."
In fact, through such exposure to the
PCC and the volunteer opportunites avail
able to students there, some Madera resi
dents are already planning for active in
volvement with the center next year.
Volunteer involvement is crucial to the
survival of organizations like the PCC.
The center provides mental health and
special education services to a multi
ethnic population composed of 22 school
districts. It was formed in 1960 as an alter
native to the common practice of institu
tionalizing several emotionaly disturbed
children. PCC provides care and treat

ment while allowing the children to re
main with their families. PCC's program
has more than 40 children ranging in age
from three-years-old to teenagers.
Children are referred to PCC because,
according to Director of Fund Develop
ment Bob Harrison, "there are no
apropriate programs for them in the pub
lic school system." But the center works
with the school system to help the child
until he or she is ready to be placed into
public school again, he added.
The race itself went smoothly, with
Madera workers at every intersection and
mile mark shouting times and encourage
ment.
Runners were organized according ac
cording to their speed and stood under a
sign with their expected mile time. The
signs ranged from 5-minute mile to 10-
minute-and-over mile.
"I can finish just like they can," said a
woman in her 60s walking toward the 10-
minute-plus sign. The race's winner came
in at just over 30 minutes, proving this race
was not just an amateur's jog.
