# Bookstore backpack check-in to become a permanent fixture
## 
### BRUCE FINLEY Staff writer 
The Stanford Bookstore
backpack check-in desk should
now be a permanent fixture, ac
cording to bookstore security
personnel. In response to a rash
of backpack thefts, the bookstore
has discontinued the previous
policy of allowing backpacks to
be left on the floor in the front of
the store, and has implemented
the check-in system full-time.
Previously, the bookstore used
the check-in method only during
registration, when it is most
crowded. "Usually we only do it
during rush," said a bookstore
security guard who asked to re
main unidentified.
"Around the tenth of October
people's backpacks began to get
stolen," he explained.
Though only one or two
backpacks had been stolen over
the past two years, 15 more were
stolen between October 10 and
early November of this year, ac
cording to the security guard. A
suspect believed to be responsible
for many of the thefts has been
arrested, he said.
Costs increased for the book
store which, although not legally
responsible, had been "morally
obligated" to refund victims for
stolen articles. The thefts led to a
meeting where staff and security
personnel "bounced ideas
around," the security guard said,
and "the end decision was that
we should start the check-in
again."
Students, for the most part, re
acted negatively to the check-in
policy. While one student reluc
tantly conceded that "it's all right
if it solves their problem," most
students seem to resent the incon
venience of waiting in line and
taking a number.
One man called it "unneces
sary bureaucracy" and many stu
dents expressed anger and impa
tience.

"It's ridiculous! "junior Dave
Pagel said. "These people are get
ting paid to check packs, and
that's making my books more ex
pensive." He added that the
check-in policy is an example of
an inconvenience that touches
"all our daily lives," and that it is
"a waste of time."
Security guards explained that
the backpack check-in "is solely
for the benefit of the students."
The staff is aware that students
don't like the wait, even though it
is rarely more than five minutes
long.
The security guard interviewed
pointed out the effectiveness of
the prohibition of backpacks in
the bookstore. "Before they had
security here, the theft was
enormous," he said.
In addition to the backpack
regulation staff, the store em
ploys a staff of 14 undercover se
curity officers, with three to five

patroling the floor at any given
time.
Before the implementation of
security measures, according to a
security staff member, theft re
sulted in losses of $300,000 a year
for the bookstore. The current se
curity policy has cut losses to
around $ 130,000 a year.
One result of the check-in ser
vice is that the bookstore is noli
longer obligated to reimburse
customers for stolen backpacks,
unless they are checked in. The
policy will continue, according to
the security guard, "unless stu
dents decide to assume the risk
themselves."
"People who have time to
leave suggestions have been very
positive (about the backpack j
checking), particularly those who j
have had their packs stolen," he ;
added. But most people just j
"grumble and walk away," he J
said.


CHECK-IN: Students will now be required to check their
backpacks at this table before entering the Stanford Bookstore
due to a recent rash of backpack thefts, according to Bookstore
security personnel.
