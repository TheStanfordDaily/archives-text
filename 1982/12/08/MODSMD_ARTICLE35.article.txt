# Naming hows and whys, or: why is it the Sterling Quad?

The names Branner, Crothers, Stern and Tres
idder, along with many others, are familiar to
almost all Stanford students. Yet these familiar
names are more frequently associated with
buildings on campus than with the people whose
names they carry people who played impor
tant roles on the history of the University.
Choices for names of University buildings in
the past have frequently included names of past
University presidents. Jordan Hall, a building in
the Quad, was named after David Starr Jordan,
Stanford's first president; Branner Hall was
named for Stanford's second president, John
Casper Branner; and Wilbur Hall, Tresidder
Union, and the recently dedicated Sterling
Quadrangle were likewise named after former
presidents.
Yet the process of choosing names for Univer
sity buildings has not always been a simple one.
In contrast to the early days of Stanford's his
tory, when then-President David Starr Jordan
himself personally selected the names for the
streets running through the University, the
choice of building names in recent history has
been determined by a variety of individuals and
groups, including the board of trustees, which
must approve all choices, the Office of the Dean
of Student Affairs, and the Stanford Historical
Society, which recently complied a "suggestion
list" of possible names to be used in the future.
There has never been a permanent committee
to decide upon building names, and until recent
ly, there have been no formal guidelines for
choosing names although in general, names
selected were those of distinguished alumni or of
1 faculty members who gave at least 15 years of
outstanding service to the University.
Another source of names for buildings has ob
viously been that of donors who made the ex
istence of certain buildings possible. Although
most of these donors, such as Cecil Green, who
provided the primary funding for the new wing
of Green Library, and Thomas Storke, who pro
vided funding for the student publications build
ing, were either alumni or close associates of
Stanford, some buildings, such as the Nathan
Cummings Art building, were named for philan
thropists who had no formal connection with the
University.

Naming a building after its donor, however,
has not always been a simple matter. Certain
donors in the past have refused, or only reluc
tantly allowed, their names to be used on the
buildings they funded. The Education Building,
for example, was funded by former Dean El
lwood Cubberly of the School of Education,
who had originally refused to allow his name to
be used on the building.
He later agreed, however, to allow his name to
be used on the library in the School of Educa
tion, though the building itself does not officially
carry his name. A donor responsible for a build
ing in the Law School also refused to allow his
name to be used, but agreed to allow the Univer
sity to use his initials, F.1.R., on the building.
Other donors, too, have made donations only
under certain conditions which had to be fol
lowed by the University. Florence Moore's leg
endary stipulation that ice cream be served every
night in Florence Moore Hall is an example of
this. George Crothers, upset about the fact that
Stern Hall had been built without a tile roof like
the other Stanford buildings, likewise insisted
that Crothers Hall be built with a tile roof. Ac
cording to Peter Allen, former University editor,
however, such stipulations are not often made or
followed.
Donors' donations, however, are often more
than monetary. Lucie Stern, whose estate pro
vided funding for the construction of Stern Hall
and the Faculty Club, was well known during
her life as a moral as well as financial supporter
of Stanford. She befriended many students (who
called her "Aunt Lucie") and often invited them
to her Palo Alto home.

It is this kind of service and dedication to the
Stanford community that the University often
looks for when choosing names. In the selection
of names for the new student residences, for ex
ample, a newly drawn-up set of guidelines was
used. According to Dean of Student Affairs
James Lyons, the individuals considered for the
honor were judged by their "presence" and rep
utation while working at Stanford, their con
tribution in their respective fields of study (if fac
ulty members), and their service and dedication
to undergraduates.
