If you've sampled even a
couple of the multitude of
Chinese restaurants in the
area (and there are many), it's
easy to become immune to the
subtle differences that do exist
between the various local
purveyors of Oriental cuisine.
And when your taste buds
have sighed indifferently at
their umpteenth serving of
slightly bland Chicken Chow
Mein, it comes as a very pleas
ant surprise to find an array of
Chinese food that surpasses
the ordinary. It's exactly that
extraordinary Chinese
food (and a lot more) â€”that
we recently discovered at
Grand China in Los Altos.
Manager Jocelyn Liu oper
ates what can be described, in

most respects, as a "family
style" restaurant. I hesitate to
use that term, because it's so
often a label reserved for pizza
parlors and steak houses;
however, in this case it does fit
the bill rather well.

For one, the entire restau
rant is essentially one large
room (as a friend commented,
similar to "a converted
basketball court"). Provided
you can put up with the lack
of intimacy, the fact that ev
eryone is in plain view of each
other presents no major prob
lems. On this particular eve
ning, the crowd was domi
nated bv groups of three and
four. The dress was decidedly
casual: clothes ran the gamut
from the fellow next to us,
who seemed headed for soft
ball practice, to the occasional
sportcoat elsewhere. Any
thing more formal than the
latter would definitely be out
of place.
This casual theme extends
to a variety of interior
furnishings. A wide range of
ornaments includes elegant
hanging lamps and Chinese
tapestries, down to bamboo
motif wallpaper and a
strangelv-luminous rendition
of a waterfall behind us. Over
all, the atmosphere can best
be referred to as "relaxed,"
and whatever criticisms we
had of this were made largely
irrelevant when the food ar
rived.
Grand China specializes in
Szechuan cuisine, dishes typi
fied by their hot and spicy
sauces. For those less than

thrilled with the likes of chili
sauce and hot pepper, they
also offer the more traditional
(and milder) Mandarin
cuisine, as well as other alter
natives including Peking,
Hunan and Canton. What
ever you opt for, be prepared
to sift through a grand total of
115 dishes on a truly en
cyclopedic menu.

We chose to start the eve
ning with an old favorite, Pot
Stickers ($2.75), a rather un
flattering name for pieces of
savory sausage enveloped in
dough and then sauteed. They
were served with a choice of
white wine vinegar or hot oil,
either of which is recom
mended because without
them, Pot Stickers are none
too exciting. However, judg
ing from the speed with which
they disappeared, my compa
nions thought them exciting
enough.

Shortly thereafter arrived
our entrees (if indeed Chinese
dishes can be so described),
and it was the least I could do
first to make room on the
table for what were quite size
able portions of each, and sec
ondly to keep them there long
enough in order to gauge
some token reaction from the
ravenous crowd around me,
who were performing amaz
ing gastronomic feats with
their chopsticks.
Probably our favorite of the
four dishes we selected was
the Sweet and Sour Pork
($4.75). Originally, I had mis
givings about succumbing to
natural instincts and ordering
such a terribly conventional
dish, but this version far ex
ceeded normal expectations.
The deep-fried batter was
crisp, not soggy, and the sauce
blended exceptionally well
with large pieces of pineapple,
onions and green peppers.
(These over-sized vegetables
are a common facet of the
dishes at Grand China not

only do they add to the flavor,
but they're a good deal easier
to handle if, like myself,
you're not too deft with the
chopsticks.)

Our token venture into the
restaurant's Szechuan catego
ry was Hot Spiced Shredded
Beef ($4.95). This was a little
disappointing only in that it
wasn't nearly as hot as we had
expected, but as the manager
later explained, most of her
customers seem to prefer it
that way. If we had taken the
time to read the fine print at
the bottom of the menu, we
might have taken advantage
of the fact that they can "alter
the spices to suit your taste. "4

From a dozen vegetable
dishes we chose the Black
Mushrooms and Snow Peas
($6.95), a very palatable com
bination sauteed with a liberal
dash of sov sauce. The peas
were crisp, and the
mushrooms, though they as
always looked appalling,
rounded out the flavor well.
The Diced Chicken with
Cashew Nuts ($4.75) included
an abundance of whole
cashews, along with water
chestnuts and green peppers.
It didn't last long. And neither
did the Deluxe Fried Rice
($3.25), which we intended as
merely a change of pace, and
instead turned out to be a de
licious meal in itself high
lighted by a combination of
chicken, pork, shrimp, peas
and egg that wound its way
throughout. Whereas most
rice of this sort is prepared in
soy sauce, Liu said she prefers
hers otherwise, because white
rice "looks fresher." Who's to

argue with fresh-looking rice?
As a final note, there's an
other facet to Grand China
that makes it a "family" res
taurant: Liu's father is the
chef, and her sister and
brother were among those at
tending to tables during the
evening. It may well be a sense
of family pride that makes
Grand China such an excep
tional place amid the myriad
of local Chinese restaurants.
As they say: "If you're visiting
Stanford, don't miss us."
Right again. Personally, I find
superb food at very reason
able prices more exciting than
Hoover Tower anyway.
Grand China closes up
shop on Tuesdays, but serves
lunch from 11:30-2 the rest of
the week and dinner from
5:30-9:30 except on Fridays
and Saturdays when they stay
open until 10. Call ahead for
reservations.

Whatever you opt
for, be prepared to
sift through a grand
total of 115 dishes
on a truly
encyclopedic menu.

And when your
taste buds have
sighed indifferently
at their umpteenth
serving of slightly
bland Chicken
Chow Mein, it
comes as a very
pleasant surprise to
find an array of
Chinese food that
surpasses the
ordinary.

It may well be a sense
of family pride that
makes Grand China
such an exceptional
place amid the
myriad of local
Chinese restaurants.
