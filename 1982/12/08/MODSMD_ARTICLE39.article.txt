We walked into the restaurant
and were greeted by a large bul
letin board with snapshots of the
Chef Chu "family" and "guests,"
and because it was similar to a
dormitory collage, we im
mediately felt comfortable and
among friends.'
After being seated, we found
Chef Chu's menu to be creative
and extensive, featuring spicy
Szechaun and Mandarin
cuisines. It would be best to eat
here only if you like to indulge
rather heavily, if you live in the
trailers and need leftovers from
the monstrous entrees, or if you
have a large group to feed. This
way, you could avoid the great
debate over what to choose from
the menu that is inevitable if you
come with just one friend.
Taste excitement is perhaps the
best description to offer. We
began with an appetizer com
bination plate called Mandarin
Tidbits which included BBQ
spareribs, large egg rolls, fried
prawns and rumakis chicken
livers, water chestnuts and bacon
- a new taste experience for us
but not really worth the price of
$4.75.

The next course is recom
mended only for the adventurous
with cast-iron stomachs. The Hot
and Sour soup was fiery at the
first bite and continued esca
lating into a numbing sensation
that was anesthetic enough for a
root canal, yet fantastically pleas
ing at the same time. The soup
was stocked with delicately

shredded pork, bamboo shoots,
shrimp, bean cake, mushrooms,
and catch this tiger lilly
buds! White pepper makes it hot
and Chinese vinegar provides the
kick that is unique from any spice
sensation. A family-sized bowl
was only $3.50, and it provided
two or three servings for the two
of us.
Continuing on our
gastronomic voyage, we finally
made it to the main dishes. The
first of which was Mu Shu Pork.
Chef Chu was under some stiff
competition when we tasted this
dish since it is our particular fa-

vorite and we have ordered it at
particularly every opportunity.
Chef Chu passed with flying col
ors. Mu Shu Pork is a dish with
strips of pork sauteed in fluffed
eggs and mixed with cabbage and
other Chinese renditions of "rab
bit food." This is served with Pe
king sauce and slivers of green
onion, all to be wrapped in a thin
pancake. A serving for four was
$5.25.
We were tempted to purchase a
Chef Chu's cookbook to try this
one at home, especially since the
last attempt at home-cooked
Chinese food resulted in the
chopping block being swallowed
by expanding black fungus and
lilly pads, quite reminiscent of
the "pudding" scene in Woody
Allen's Sleeper.
The second entree was served a
little after the first, which we pre
ferred to the usual Chinese ava
lanche of dishes. This was
Chicken with Chinese peas,
chosen mainly because we
couldn't decide between a vegeta
ble or a meat dish. It proved to be
a wise choice. The dish was

perfect in timing, the diced white
chicken was tender and juicy
while the snow peas and water
chestnuts were crisp and light, a
super combination with a deli
cate sauce at only $5.50.
The food was excellent and
further complemented by an ar
tistic presentation. The service
itself was attentive, but there
were so many different people
waiting on us that it was quite a

game trying to determine who
would come next; where it ex
celled in efficiency, it lacked in
character. Perhaps the speedy
service was purposeful, to pre
vent that full feeling from wear
ing off so guests will not ask for
dessert one request that Chef
Chu's would be unable to fulfill
since they offer no dessert selec
tion other than the usual com
plimentary fortune cookies.
One thing that should be men

tioned is that there is a very lim
ited choice of combination
plates, which just means, again,
come with a group as one, big
happy family or after a long fast.
The atmosphere is casual, not
overwhelmingly clear, but still
tasteful. We would be a bit sus
picious of anything fancier it
seems as though the more Ameri
canized Chinese establishments
in the area sport pagodas, tri

level shaped trees, and black stat
uettes, all of which we didn't miss
in the familv-styled atmosphere
of Chef ChuV The waiting area
is a bit dark and crowded (at
6:15 on a weeknight when we left,
the place was packed), so we
would recommend reservations.
However, there is a full bar to
pass the time while waiting for
your table. An additional sugges
tion may be to charge your din
ner on the plastic card since all

checks must be approved by the
management ahead of time.
It would be easy to become a
committed fan:* at Chef Chu's
since it would take many visits
and take-outs (sorry, no de
liveries) to feel as though you
have truly experienced all the cul
inary delights and surprises they
have to offer. I
