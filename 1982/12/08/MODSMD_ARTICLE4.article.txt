Congress votes to cancel MX missile funding

Washington In a historic and resounding defeat for the Reagan admin
istration, the House voted overwhelmingly yesterday to cancel funds for the
MX missile.
The 245-176 vote was the first in time the memory of longtime con
gressional observers that a presidential request for a major weapons system
was denied by Congress.
The lopsided vote also marked the first time that a significant number of
Republicans broke with the administration to vote against a program that
represents the core of the president's own personal and political agenda.
Fifty Republicans joined an overwhelming Democratic majority in ap
proving the measure, an amendment to the 1983 Defense Appropriations bill
that deleted $9BB million for procurement of the first five MX missiles. The
amendment was sponsored by the House's chief MX critic, Rep. Joseph Ad
dabbo (D-N.Y.)
In a statement issued late yesterday, President Reagan called the vote "a
grave mistake," and said those who had voted to kill funds for the MX were
"sleep-walking into the future."
The defeat yesterday of the MX, although only one of a series of legislative
steps that could lead to cancellation of the entire $26 billion program, could
have repercussions among the North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies.
The administration has argued that a demonstration of U.S. unwillingness
to put land-based missiles on its own territory might undermine the 1979
NATO decision to accept U.S. nuclear missiles on European soil.
Danes suspend missile funds

Washington Denmark became the first
NATO member to break with alliance plans to
modernize its nuclear arsenal yesterday when the
Danish parliament voted to suspend payments for
deployment of 572 Pershing II and cruise missiles
in Western Europe late next year.
The decision, bitterly opposed by the country's
minority center-right government, was seen as a
victory for anti-nuclear groups in Europe who
have vowed to block installation of the new mis
siles. A similar proposal was narrowly defeated in
Norway's parliament last month.
Although Denmark pays only a small propor
tion of the deployment scheme and will not receive
any missiles since it bans nuclear weapons on its
soil, the parliament vote is likely to have important
repercussions in other NATO countries where the
missile plan has exacerbated anti-nuclear protests.
Secretary of State George Shultz, who arrived in
Bonn yesterday at the start of a 13-day trip through
seven allied European countries, said that while
there has been no substantive shift in positions at
Geneva, there has been a greater tendency recently
by both sides to "emphasize that we would like to
see these negotiations succeed," a Washington
Post staff writer reported from Bonn.
Shultz said these increased signs of a mutual de
sire for agreement had emerged "most noticeably
in recent weeks," meaning after the death of
former Soviet president Leonid Brezhnev and the
rise to power of Yuri Andropov.
Shultz plans to leave Bonn today for the semi
annual meeting of NATO foreign ministers in
Brussels, where the Geneva arms talks and the re
percussions of the Danish vote are likely to be ma
jor topics on the agenda.

State budget developing a deficit

Sacramento The state could be $1.3 billion to
$2.4 billion in the red this year and up to $4.5
billion behind next year, state lawmakers learned
yesterday.
The Legislature must do something by Feb. 22,
when a $2OO million bank note is due and the state
will have to borrow again, said Mary Ann Graves,
the finance director for outgoing Democratic Gov.
Brown.
"We have to have a solution in place ... or the
(banking ) market will impose a premium, a pro
hibitive interest rate," she told lawmakers.
Treasurer Jesse Unruh said he will not sell any
bonds, for state programs like veterans' home
loans and prison construction, "until our fiscal
house is put in order."
The state's fiscal officers made their pessimistic
reports at a joint meeting of the Senate Finance
and Assembly Ways and Means committees.
The state Legislature convened Monday for its
two-year session and Brown called lawmakers into
special session, partially to deal with the fiscal
crisis.
However, it is uncertain whether lawmakers will
approve some combination of spending cuts or tax
increases before the Democratic governor leaves
office and Republican Gov.-elect George Deu
kmejian takes office Jan. 3.
Deukmejian's designated finance director,
Michael Franchetti, was invited to yesterday's
hearing, but Deukmejian said that would not be
appropriate, said Ways and Means Chairman
John Vasconcellos (D-San Jose).
The Legislature last June passed a $25.2 billion
budget for the 1982-83 fiscal year that was delicate
ly balanced with a $464 million surplus. It was
based on tax revenues and expenses estimated in
June.

But since then, "the economy is simply not re
covering," said Graves.

Guerrillas claim bombing credit

Ballykelly, Northern Ireland Guerrillas of the
Irish National Liberation Army claimed responsi
bility yesterday for planting the bomb that sent an
avalanche of concrete onto a crowd of British sol
diers and civilians at a disco-bar, killing 16 people
and wounding 66.
In London, an outraged Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher called the bombing "one of the
most horrific crimes in Ulster's tragic history," and
said the British government "won't rest until these
merciless killers are brought to justice."
Police and army spokesmen said the dead in
cluded 11 British soldiers and five civilians, four of
them women. Some of the victims of Monday
night's attack lost arms and legs in the crushing
debris, and at least 40 of the injured were admitted
to hospitals.
It was the worst terrorist attack in Northern Ire
land since August 1979, when 18 British soldiers
were killed in a double-bombing at Warrenpoint
near the border with the Irish Republic.
Northern Ireland Secretary James Prior, who
visited victims of the latest blast at a hospital and
toured the Droppin Well pub where the blast oc
curred, told reporters: "It was a massacre without
mercy."
The Irish National Liberation Army, a Marxist
offshoot of the outlawed Irish Republican Army,
claimed responsibility for the blast in a call to a
Belfast television station. The caller, who used an
acknowledged code word, issued no other
statement. . ."

Seizures threaten heart patient

Salt Lake City Artificial-heart recipient
Barney Clark suffered a series of seizures yesterday
"which could have ominous significance,"
prompting doctors to put him back on a respirator
and downgrade his condition to critical.
Doctors said they hoped the seizures stemmed
from a correctable chemical imbalance, and not
from either of two other possibilities a hemor
rhage or blood clot in the brain. The artificial heart
was functioning normally and the pump itself
probably was unrelated to the seizures, doctors'
said.
The seizures early on the sixth day of Clark's life
with the permanent plastic device lasted from one
to two hours Jpefore they were controlled by
sedatives, said Dr. Chase Peterson, vice president
for health services at the University of Utah.
"We are concerned that Dr. Clark has had a
complication, the significance of which could be
ominous, but is not yet clear," Peterson told a news
conference five hours after the early-morning
seizures.
Peterson said the complications could range in
seriousness "from serious brain damage to a total
ly reversible chemical imbalance."
Peterson said Clark, a 61-year-old retired Seat
tle-area dentist, had spent a restful night following
his second day Monday performing brief and mild
exercises. He had been listed in serious condition
since Saturday.
Dr. William DeVries, the surgeon who im
planted Clark's Jarvik-7 heart last Thursday, had
been pleased with Clark's recovery and was talking
with his patient early yesterday.

Gasoline tax bill sent to Senate

Washington Majority Leader Howard Baker
(R-Tenn.) yesterday predicted that the Senate will
follow the House and approve a 5-cent-a-gajlon in
crease in the federal gasoline tax despite Re
publican filibuster threats and Democratic plans to

push instead for higher income taxes on the
wealthy.
The gas tax increase, which would raise the pres
ent 4-cent levy to 9 cents on April 1, was passed ear
ly yesterday by the House, 262 to 143, as part of
highway authorization legislation that includes
$5.5 biliion a year for job-creating road, bridge and
mass transit repair work.
The House vote was a joint triumph for Presi
dent Reagan and Speaker Tip O'Neill (D-Mass.)
who worked in unusual concert against an equally
curious array of foes ranging from both man
agement and labor in the trucking industry, which
objected to higher levies on heavy trucks, to en
vironmentalists, who feared the impact of new in
terstate highway construction.
A similar array of opponents, led by the
truckers, faces the measure in the Senate, along
with some other complications that Baker said
could delay, although probably not jeopardize,
passage.
Committee action on the bill started yesterday,
and Senate floor action is scheduled to begin
tomorrow.

Andropov appoints ministers

Moscow Yuri Andropov, the new Soviet lead
er, has carried out a major reshuffle within the
Central Committee by appointing a 49-year-old
party official and former journalist as chief of its
propaganda department, or, in effect, the party's
propaganda minister.
The appointment of Boris Stukalin, who once
served as deputy editor of the Communist Party
newspaper Pravda, was disclosed by Moscow tele
vision last evening.
The shuffle suggested that Andropov intends to
bring in younger people to senior positions and
foreshadows major changes in the upper and
middle ranks of the Kremlin hierarchy.
In a front-page editorial Monday, Pravda called
for a purge of inefficient and corrupt party officials
who have been tolerated in the past and who have
been "moved from one chair to another" despite
their inadequacies.
Stukalin replaces Yevgeny Tyazhelnikov, 54, a
protege of the late chief party ideologist Mikhail
Suslov. There was no official word as to what hap
pened to Tyazhelnikov, but Soviet sources said he
had been appointed ambassador to Romania, a
clear demotion.
The move came after Andropov appointed
Viktor Mishin, 39, as the new head of the Com
munist youth organization Komsomol.

Stocks up amid heavy trading

New York Stock prices edged upward yester
day in a busy day of wide swings on Wall Street.
Analysts said talk of lower interest rates kept the
market moving ahead, although it ran up against
increased resistance from sellers when the Dow
Jones industrial average made a run at a new rec
ord high.
The venerable average of 30 blue chips, down 5
in early trading and up 10 at midday, closed with a
1.29 gain at 1,056.94. The average reached its all
time closing peak at 1,065.49 on Nov. 3.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange to
taled 111.62 million shares, up from 83.88 million
Monday and the heaviest total since a 113.24 mil
lion-share day on Nov. 10.

Today's weather

Sunny today with highs in the upper 50s to mid 60s.
Northerly winds 15 to 25 mph. Fair tonight and
tomorrow with lows in the mid 30s to low 40s and

Congress votes to cancel MX missile funding

Washington In a historic and resounding defeat for the Reagan admin
istration, the House voted overwhelmingly yesterday to cancel funds for the
MX missile.
The 245-176 vote was the first in time the memory of longtime con
gressional observers that a presidential request for a major weapons system
was denied by Congress.
The lopsided vote also marked the first time that a significant number of
Republicans broke with the administration to vote against a program that
represents the core of the president's own personal and political agenda.
Fifty Republicans joined an overwhelming Democratic majority in ap
proving the measure, an amendment to the 1983 Defense Appropriations bill
that deleted $9BB million for procurement of the first five MX missiles. The
amendment was sponsored by the House's chief MX critic, Rep. Joseph Ad
dabbo (D-N.Y.)
In a statement issued late yesterday, President Reagan called the vote "a
grave mistake," and said those who had voted to kill funds for the MX were
"sleep-walking into the future."
The defeat yesterday of the MX, although only one of a series of legislative
steps that could lead to cancellation of the entire $26 billion program, could
have repercussions among the North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies.
The administration has argued that a demonstration of U.S. unwillingness
to put land-based missiles on its own territory might undermine the 1979
NATO decision to accept U.S. nuclear missiles on European soil.
Danes suspend missile funds

Washington Denmark became the first
NATO member to break with alliance plans to
modernize its nuclear arsenal yesterday when the
Danish parliament voted to suspend payments for
deployment of 572 Pershing II and cruise missiles
in Western Europe late next year.
The decision, bitterly opposed by the country's
minority center-right government, was seen as a
victory for anti-nuclear groups in Europe who
have vowed to block installation of the new mis
siles. A similar proposal was narrowly defeated in
Norway's parliament last month.
Although Denmark pays only a small propor
tion of the deployment scheme and will not receive
any missiles since it bans nuclear weapons on its
soil, the parliament vote is likely to have important
repercussions in other NATO countries where the
missile plan has exacerbated anti-nuclear protests.
Secretary of State George Shultz, who arrived in
Bonn yesterday at the start of a 13-day trip through
seven allied European countries, said that while
there has been no substantive shift in positions at
Geneva, there has been a greater tendency recently
by both sides to "emphasize that we would like to
see these negotiations succeed," a Washington
Post staff writer reported from Bonn.
Shultz said these increased signs of a mutual de
sire for agreement had emerged "most noticeably
in recent weeks," meaning after the death of
former Soviet president Leonid Brezhnev and the
rise to power of Yuri Andropov.
Shultz plans to leave Bonn today for the semi
annual meeting of NATO foreign ministers in
Brussels, where the Geneva arms talks and the re
percussions of the Danish vote are likely to be ma
jor topics on the agenda.

State budget developing a deficit

Sacramento The state could be $1.3 billion to
$2.4 billion in the red this year and up to $4.5
billion behind next year, state lawmakers learned
yesterday.
The Legislature must do something by Feb. 22,
when a $2OO million bank note is due and the state
will have to borrow again, said Mary Ann Graves,
the finance director for outgoing Democratic Gov.
Brown.
"We have to have a solution in place ... or the
(banking ) market will impose a premium, a pro
hibitive interest rate," she told lawmakers.
Treasurer Jesse Unruh said he will not sell any
bonds, for state programs like veterans' home
loans and prison construction, "until our fiscal
house is put in order."
The state's fiscal officers made their pessimistic
reports at a joint meeting of the Senate Finance
and Assembly Ways and Means committees.
The state Legislature convened Monday for its
two-year session and Brown called lawmakers into
special session, partially to deal with the fiscal
crisis.
However, it is uncertain whether lawmakers will
approve some combination of spending cuts or tax
increases before the Democratic governor leaves
office and Republican Gov.-elect George Deu
kmejian takes office Jan. 3.
Deukmejian's designated finance director,
Michael Franchetti, was invited to yesterday's
hearing, but Deukmejian said that would not be
appropriate, said Ways and Means Chairman
John Vasconcellos (D-San Jose).
The Legislature last June passed a $25.2 billion
budget for the 1982-83 fiscal year that was delicate
ly balanced with a $464 million surplus. It was
based on tax revenues and expenses estimated in
June.

But since then, "the economy is simply not re
covering," said Graves.

Guerrillas claim bombing credit

Ballykelly, Northern Ireland Guerrillas of the
Irish National Liberation Army claimed responsi
bility yesterday for planting the bomb that sent an
avalanche of concrete onto a crowd of British sol
diers and civilians at a disco-bar, killing 16 people
and wounding 66.
In London, an outraged Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher called the bombing "one of the
most horrific crimes in Ulster's tragic history," and
said the British government "won't rest until these
merciless killers are brought to justice."
Police and army spokesmen said the dead in
cluded 11 British soldiers and five civilians, four of
them women. Some of the victims of Monday
night's attack lost arms and legs in the crushing
debris, and at least 40 of the injured were admitted
to hospitals.
It was the worst terrorist attack in Northern Ire
land since August 1979, when 18 British soldiers
were killed in a double-bombing at Warrenpoint
near the border with the Irish Republic.
Northern Ireland Secretary James Prior, who
visited victims of the latest blast at a hospital and
toured the Droppin Well pub where the blast oc
curred, told reporters: "It was a massacre without
mercy."
The Irish National Liberation Army, a Marxist
offshoot of the outlawed Irish Republican Army,
claimed responsibility for the blast in a call to a
Belfast television station. The caller, who used an
acknowledged code word, issued no other
statement. . ."

Seizures threaten heart patient

Salt Lake City Artificial-heart recipient
Barney Clark suffered a series of seizures yesterday
"which could have ominous significance,"
prompting doctors to put him back on a respirator
and downgrade his condition to critical.
Doctors said they hoped the seizures stemmed
from a correctable chemical imbalance, and not
from either of two other possibilities a hemor
rhage or blood clot in the brain. The artificial heart
was functioning normally and the pump itself
probably was unrelated to the seizures, doctors'
said.
The seizures early on the sixth day of Clark's life
with the permanent plastic device lasted from one
to two hours Jpefore they were controlled by
sedatives, said Dr. Chase Peterson, vice president
for health services at the University of Utah.
"We are concerned that Dr. Clark has had a
complication, the significance of which could be
ominous, but is not yet clear," Peterson told a news
conference five hours after the early-morning
seizures.
Peterson said the complications could range in
seriousness "from serious brain damage to a total
ly reversible chemical imbalance."
Peterson said Clark, a 61-year-old retired Seat
tle-area dentist, had spent a restful night following
his second day Monday performing brief and mild
exercises. He had been listed in serious condition
since Saturday.
Dr. William DeVries, the surgeon who im
planted Clark's Jarvik-7 heart last Thursday, had
been pleased with Clark's recovery and was talking
with his patient early yesterday.

Gasoline tax bill sent to Senate

Washington Majority Leader Howard Baker
(R-Tenn.) yesterday predicted that the Senate will
follow the House and approve a 5-cent-a-gajlon in
crease in the federal gasoline tax despite Re
publican filibuster threats and Democratic plans to

push instead for higher income taxes on the
wealthy.
The gas tax increase, which would raise the pres
ent 4-cent levy to 9 cents on April 1, was passed ear
ly yesterday by the House, 262 to 143, as part of
highway authorization legislation that includes
$5.5 biliion a year for job-creating road, bridge and
mass transit repair work.
The House vote was a joint triumph for Presi
dent Reagan and Speaker Tip O'Neill (D-Mass.)
who worked in unusual concert against an equally
curious array of foes ranging from both man
agement and labor in the trucking industry, which
objected to higher levies on heavy trucks, to en
vironmentalists, who feared the impact of new in
terstate highway construction.
A similar array of opponents, led by the
truckers, faces the measure in the Senate, along
with some other complications that Baker said
could delay, although probably not jeopardize,
passage.
Committee action on the bill started yesterday,
and Senate floor action is scheduled to begin
tomorrow.

Andropov appoints ministers

Moscow Yuri Andropov, the new Soviet lead
er, has carried out a major reshuffle within the
Central Committee by appointing a 49-year-old
party official and former journalist as chief of its
propaganda department, or, in effect, the party's
propaganda minister.
The appointment of Boris Stukalin, who once
served as deputy editor of the Communist Party
newspaper Pravda, was disclosed by Moscow tele
vision last evening.
The shuffle suggested that Andropov intends to
bring in younger people to senior positions and
foreshadows major changes in the upper and
middle ranks of the Kremlin hierarchy.
In a front-page editorial Monday, Pravda called
for a purge of inefficient and corrupt party officials
who have been tolerated in the past and who have
been "moved from one chair to another" despite
their inadequacies.

crease in the federal gasoline tax despite Re
publican filibuster threats and Democratic plans to

push instead for higher income taxes on the
wealthy.
The gas tax increase, which would raise the pres
ent 4-cent levy to 9 cents on April 1, was passed ear
ly yesterday by the House, 262 to 143, as part of
highway authorization legislation that includes
$5.5 biliion a year for job-creating road, bridge and
mass transit repair work.
The House vote was a joint triumph for Presi
dent Reagan and Speaker Tip O'Neill (D-Mass.)
who worked in unusual concert against an equally
curious array of foes ranging from both man
agement and labor in the trucking industry, which
objected to higher levies on heavy trucks, to en
vironmentalists, who feared the impact of new in
terstate highway construction.
A similar array of opponents, led by the
truckers, faces the measure in the Senate, along
with some other complications that Baker said
could delay, although probably not jeopardize,
passage.
Committee action on the bill started yesterday,
and Senate floor action is scheduled to begin
tomorrow.

Andropov appoints ministers

Moscow Yuri Andropov, the new Soviet lead
er, has carried out a major reshuffle within the
Central Committee by appointing a 49-year-old
party official and former journalist as chief of its
propaganda department, or, in effect, the party's
propaganda minister.
The appointment of Boris Stukalin, who once
served as deputy editor of the Communist Party
newspaper Pravda, was disclosed by Moscow tele
vision last evening.
The shuffle suggested that Andropov intends to
bring in younger people to senior positions and
foreshadows major changes in the upper and
middle ranks of the Kremlin hierarchy.
In a front-page editorial Monday, Pravda called
for a purge of inefficient and corrupt party officials
who have been tolerated in the past and who have
been "moved from one chair to another" despite
their inadequacies.
Stukalin replaces Yevgeny Tyazhelnikov, 54, a
protege of the late chief party ideologist Mikhail
Suslov. There was no official word as to what hap
pened to Tyazhelnikov, but Soviet sources said he
had been appointed ambassador to Romania, a
clear demotion.
The move came after Andropov appointed
Viktor Mishin, 39, as the new head of the Com
munist youth organization Komsomol.

New York Stock prices edged upward yester
day in a busy day of wide swings on Wall Street.
Analysts said talk of lower interest rates kept the

Congress votes to cancel MX missile funding

Washington In a historic and resounding defeat for the Reagan admin
istration, the House voted overwhelmingly yesterday to cancel funds for the
MX missile.
The 245-176 vote was the first in time the memory of longtime con
gressional observers that a presidential request for a major weapons system
was denied by Congress.
The lopsided vote also marked the first time that a significant number of
Republicans broke with the administration to vote against a program that
represents the core of the president's own personal and political agenda.
Fifty Republicans joined an overwhelming Democratic majority in ap
proving the measure, an amendment to the 1983 Defense Appropriations bill
that deleted $9BB million for procurement of the first five MX missiles. The
amendment was sponsored by the House's chief MX critic, Rep. Joseph Ad
dabbo (D-N.Y.)
In a statement issued late yesterday, President Reagan called the vote "a
grave mistake," and said those who had voted to kill funds for the MX were
"sleep-walking into the future."
The defeat yesterday of the MX, although only one of a series of legislative
steps that could lead to cancellation of the entire $26 billion program, could
have repercussions among the North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies.
The administration has argued that a demonstration of U.S. unwillingness
to put land-based missiles on its own territory might undermine the 1979
NATO decision to accept U.S. nuclear missiles on European soil.
Danes suspend missile funds

Washington Denmark became the first
NATO member to break with alliance plans to
modernize its nuclear arsenal yesterday when the
Danish parliament voted to suspend payments for
deployment of 572 Pershing II and cruise missiles
in Western Europe late next year.
The decision, bitterly opposed by the country's
minority center-right government, was seen as a
victory for anti-nuclear groups in Europe who
have vowed to block installation of the new mis
siles. A similar proposal was narrowly defeated in
Norway's parliament last month.
Although Denmark pays only a small propor
tion of the deployment scheme and will not receive
any missiles since it bans nuclear weapons on its
soil, the parliament vote is likely to have important
repercussions in other NATO countries where the
missile plan has exacerbated anti-nuclear protests.
Secretary of State George Shultz, who arrived in
Bonn yesterday at the start of a 13-day trip through
seven allied European countries, said that while
there has been no substantive shift in positions at
Geneva, there has been a greater tendency recently
by both sides to "emphasize that we would like to
see these negotiations succeed," a Washington
Post staff writer reported from Bonn.
Shultz said these increased signs of a mutual de
sire for agreement had emerged "most noticeably
in recent weeks," meaning after the death of
former Soviet president Leonid Brezhnev and the
rise to power of Yuri Andropov.
Shultz plans to leave Bonn today for the semi
annual meeting of NATO foreign ministers in
Brussels, where the Geneva arms talks and the re
percussions of the Danish vote are likely to be ma
jor topics on the agenda.

State budget developing a deficit

Sacramento The state could be $1.3 billion to
$2.4 billion in the red this year and up to $4.5
billion behind next year, state lawmakers learned
yesterday.
The Legislature must do something by Feb. 22,
when a $2OO million bank note is due and the state
will have to borrow again, said Mary Ann Graves,
the finance director for outgoing Democratic Gov.
Brown.
"We have to have a solution in place ... or the
(banking ) market will impose a premium, a pro
hibitive interest rate," she told lawmakers.
Treasurer Jesse Unruh said he will not sell any
bonds, for state programs like veterans' home
loans and prison construction, "until our fiscal
house is put in order."
The state's fiscal officers made their pessimistic
reports at a joint meeting of the Senate Finance
and Assembly Ways and Means committees.
The state Legislature convened Monday for its
two-year session and Brown called lawmakers into
special session, partially to deal with the fiscal
crisis.
However, it is uncertain whether lawmakers will
approve some combination of spending cuts or tax
increases before the Democratic governor leaves
office and Republican Gov.-elect George Deu
kmejian takes office Jan. 3.
Deukmejian's designated finance director,
Michael Franchetti, was invited to yesterday's
hearing, but Deukmejian said that would not be
appropriate, said Ways and Means Chairman
John Vasconcellos (D-San Jose).
The Legislature last June passed a $25.2 billion
budget for the 1982-83 fiscal year that was delicate
ly balanced with a $464 million surplus. It was
based on tax revenues and expenses estimated in
June.

But since then, "the economy is simply not re
covering," said Graves.

Guerrillas claim bombing credit

Ballykelly, Northern Ireland Guerrillas of the
Irish National Liberation Army claimed responsi
bility yesterday for planting the bomb that sent an
avalanche of concrete onto a crowd of British sol
diers and civilians at a disco-bar, killing 16 people
and wounding 66.
In London, an outraged Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher called the bombing "one of the
most horrific crimes in Ulster's tragic history," and
said the British government "won't rest until these
merciless killers are brought to justice."
Police and army spokesmen said the dead in
cluded 11 British soldiers and five civilians, four of
them women. Some of the victims of Monday
night's attack lost arms and legs in the crushing
debris, and at least 40 of the injured were admitted
to hospitals.
It was the worst terrorist attack in Northern Ire
land since August 1979, when 18 British soldiers
were killed in a double-bombing at Warrenpoint
near the border with the Irish Republic.
Northern Ireland Secretary James Prior, who
visited victims of the latest blast at a hospital and
toured the Droppin Well pub where the blast oc
curred, told reporters: "It was a massacre without
mercy."
The Irish National Liberation Army, a Marxist
offshoot of the outlawed Irish Republican Army,
claimed responsibility for the blast in a call to a
Belfast television station. The caller, who used an
acknowledged code word, issued no other
statement. . ."

Seizures threaten heart patient

Salt Lake City Artificial-heart recipient
Barney Clark suffered a series of seizures yesterday
"which could have ominous significance,"
prompting doctors to put him back on a respirator
and downgrade his condition to critical.
Doctors said they hoped the seizures stemmed
from a correctable chemical imbalance, and not
from either of two other possibilities a hemor
rhage or blood clot in the brain. The artificial heart
was functioning normally and the pump itself
probably was unrelated to the seizures, doctors'
said.
The seizures early on the sixth day of Clark's life
with the permanent plastic device lasted from one
to two hours Jpefore they were controlled by
sedatives, said Dr. Chase Peterson, vice president
for health services at the University of Utah.
"We are concerned that Dr. Clark has had a
complication, the significance of which could be
ominous, but is not yet clear," Peterson told a news
conference five hours after the early-morning
seizures.
Peterson said the complications could range in
seriousness "from serious brain damage to a total
ly reversible chemical imbalance."
Peterson said Clark, a 61-year-old retired Seat
tle-area dentist, had spent a restful night following
his second day Monday performing brief and mild
exercises. He had been listed in serious condition
since Saturday.
Dr. William DeVries, the surgeon who im
planted Clark's Jarvik-7 heart last Thursday, had
been pleased with Clark's recovery and was talking
with his patient early yesterday.

Gasoline tax bill sent to Senate

Seizures threaten heart patient

Salt Lake City Artificial-heart recipient
Barney Clark suffered a series of seizures yesterday
"which could have ominous significance,"
prompting doctors to put him back on a respirator
and downgrade his condition to critical.
Doctors said they hoped the seizures stemmed
from a correctable chemical imbalance, and not
from either of two other possibilities a hemor
rhage or blood clot in the brain. The artificial heart
was functioning normally and the pump itself
probably was unrelated to the seizures, doctors'
said.
The seizures early on the sixth day of Clark's life
with the permanent plastic device lasted from one
to two hours Jpefore they were controlled by
sedatives, said Dr. Chase Peterson, vice president
for health services at the University of Utah.
"We are concerned that Dr. Clark has had a
complication, the significance of which could be
ominous, but is not yet clear," Peterson told a news
conference five hours after the early-morning
seizures.
Peterson said the complications could range in
seriousness "from serious brain damage to a total
ly reversible chemical imbalance."
Peterson said Clark, a 61-year-old retired Seat
tle-area dentist, had spent a restful night following
his second day Monday performing brief and mild
exercises. He had been listed in serious condition
since Saturday.
Dr. William DeVries, the surgeon who im
planted Clark's Jarvik-7 heart last Thursday, had
been pleased with Clark's recovery and was talking
with his patient early yesterday.

Gasoline tax bill sent to Senate

Washington Majority Leader Howard Baker
(R-Tenn.) yesterday predicted that the Senate will
follow the House and approve a 5-cent-a-gajlon in
crease in the federal gasoline tax despite Re
publican filibuster threats and Democratic plans to

push instead for higher income taxes on the
wealthy.
The gas tax increase, which would raise the pres
ent 4-cent levy to 9 cents on April 1, was passed ear
ly yesterday by the House, 262 to 143, as part of
highway authorization legislation that includes
$5.5 biliion a year for job-creating road, bridge and
mass transit repair work.
The House vote was a joint triumph for Presi
dent Reagan and Speaker Tip O'Neill (D-Mass.)
who worked in unusual concert against an equally
curious array of foes ranging from both man
agement and labor in the trucking industry, which
objected to higher levies on heavy trucks, to en
vironmentalists, who feared the impact of new in
terstate highway construction.
A similar array of opponents, led by the
truckers, faces the measure in the Senate, along
with some other complications that Baker said
could delay, although probably not jeopardize,
passage.
Committee action on the bill started yesterday,
and Senate floor action is scheduled to begin
tomorrow.

Andropov appoints ministers

Moscow Yuri Andropov, the new Soviet lead
er, has carried out a major reshuffle within the
Central Committee by appointing a 49-year-old
party official and former journalist as chief of its
propaganda department, or, in effect, the party's
propaganda minister.
The appointment of Boris Stukalin, who once
served as deputy editor of the Communist Party
newspaper Pravda, was disclosed by Moscow tele
vision last evening.
The shuffle suggested that Andropov intends to
bring in younger people to senior positions and
foreshadows major changes in the upper and
middle ranks of the Kremlin hierarchy.
In a front-page editorial Monday, Pravda called
for a purge of inefficient and corrupt party officials
who have been tolerated in the past and who have
been "moved from one chair to another" despite
their inadequacies.
Stukalin replaces Yevgeny Tyazhelnikov, 54, a
protege of the late chief party ideologist Mikhail
Suslov. There was no official word as to what hap
pened to Tyazhelnikov, but Soviet sources said he
had been appointed ambassador to Romania, a
clear demotion.
The move came after Andropov appointed
Viktor Mishin, 39, as the new head of the Com
munist youth organization Komsomol.
