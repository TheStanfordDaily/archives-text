Congress votes to cancel MX missile funding

Washington In a historic and resounding defeat for the Reagan admin
istration, the House voted overwhelmingly yesterday to cancel funds for the
MX missile.
The 245-176 vote was the first in time the memory of longtime con
gressional observers that a presidential request for a major weapons system
was denied by Congress.
The lopsided vote also marked the first time that a significant number of
Republicans broke with the administration to vote against a program that
represents the core of the president's own personal and political agenda.
Fifty Republicans joined an overwhelming Democratic majority in ap
proving the measure, an amendment to the 1983 Defense Appropriations bill
that deleted $9BB million for procurement of the first five MX missiles. The
amendment was sponsored by the House's chief MX critic, Rep. Joseph Ad
dabbo (D-N.Y.)
In a statement issued late yesterday, President Reagan called the vote "a
grave mistake," and said those who had voted to kill funds for the MX were
"sleep-walking into the future."
The defeat yesterday of the MX, although only one of a series of legislative
steps that could lead to cancellation of the entire $26 billion program, could
have repercussions among the North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies.
The administration has argued that a demonstration of U.S. unwillingness
to put land-based missiles on its own territory might undermine the 1979
NATO decision to accept U.S. nuclear missiles on European soil.
