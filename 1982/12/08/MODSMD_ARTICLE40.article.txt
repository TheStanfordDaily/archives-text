# Try some Cantonese specialties for a change of pace

### KAREN SPRINGEN 
THE CHINESE INN
1352 EI Camino Real
Menlo Park
323-6134

The area boasts a plethora of Chinese restaurants
but what distinguishes one such as the Chinese Inn
from another?
First, Cantonese eateries, unfortunately, are far less
common than Mandarin restaurants. Second, many
are unauthentic and overpriced. Third, menus are
often standard, relying on the strength of ever-popu
lar wonton soup and egg rolls to compensate for a lack
of unique, unusual menu selections.
None of the above criticisms pertain to the Chinese
Inn.
Physically, the Chinese Inn is fairly run-of-the-mill.
The spacious interior of the restaurant is clean, wood
paneled and comfortable. Special extras include a
Lazy Susan which keeps the many entrees convenient
ly revolving from person-to-person throughout the
meal. All in all, the setting (or maybe it's the lack of a
dinner crowd!) contributes to a leisurely meal.
But there's more to a restaurant than meets the eye.
The Cantonese Inn boasts an extensive array of
Cantonese specialties. According to owner Gail
Cheung, the restaurant boasts an award-winning
even "famous" chef from Hong Kong. As a result,
the more unusual dishes, such as lobster with black
bean sauce and baked crab with ginger and green on
ion, can be prepared with ease.

Cheung immigrated to the United States 16 years
ago. She bought the Chinese Inn four months ago and
changed the entire menu. "We try to make more
authentic Cantonese food. Not many restaurants have
this menu," she said.

This claim seemed justified: sea cucumbers and
shredded pork with preserved turnip are scarcely Chi
nese restaurant standbys.
We visited the Chinese Inn twice, but received the
same fine quality of service and food on both visits;
three of our party returned for yet a third dinner.
The vast menu begins by listing combination plates
($4.75-9.50 per person). It follows with a listing of 148
selections (not including fortune cookies!) ranging
from appetizers to seafood to chow mein to wonton to
rice.

Reading the menu, in addition to sampling sizable
portions of it, exhausted us. The portions are large
and delivered without interruption. Fortunately, tea
and water are served immediately and the cups are re
filled promptly, so that we were able to clear our
palates.
Because the large size of the menu was slightly over
whelming, we resorted to asking for advice on both
visits. First, we chose hot and sour soup ($3.50), egg
flower soup ($2.95) the vegetarian alternative
and . . .okay, it's unoriginal. . . wonton soup ($2.50).
All were thick with vegetables and other "filling," a
welcome change from the broth which many restau
rants call soup. The egg flower soup was filled with
large chunks of carrots, fresh peas and egg.
Next we sampled the traditional egg roll, also quite
good but a bit greasy. Fried rice, mixed with small
peas and pieces of pork, was also tasty. (Unfortunate
ly, as non-pork-eaters, we had to carefully remove the
meat. We advise warning the waiter of any picky eat
ing habits beforehand.)
We skipped the "mein" courses but sampled just
about everything else. Remember, however, that our
samplings include two visits, one with a large groups,
so our choices aren't quite as gluttonous as they may
appear.
Crispy chicken ($7) and roast duck ($4.50) were de
clared delicious. Chicken with black beans ($7) was
the favorite of the meateaters and described simply as

"yummy."
Shrimp-fried rice, the favorite of the non-meateater
(me), was slightly greasy but otherwise delectable. It
was truly shrimp-fried rice rather than rice with a few
shrimp tossed in. Cashew shrimp ($5.50), a tasty dish
of jumbo shrimp, nuts and Chinese vegetables, was
devoured promptly as well.
We ended our multi-course meal with my favorite
of Chinese dining the inevitably favorable Chinese
fortune cookie! It's always reassuring to read that
happiness, peace, love and good fortune are around
the corner!
Despite the wide variety of entrees and appetizers
on the menu, favorites remain standard chicken salad
($4.25), wonton soup ($2.50) and barbecue spare ribs
($4.50), according to Cheung.
The selections each contained different flavorings,
unlike those of many restaurants in which spices are
suspiciously similar. An added note on spices: The res
taurant owner thoughtfully placed an asterisk on the
menu next to hot and spicy dishes.

Another advantage of the Chinese Inn is its loca
tion. Because it is in Menlo Park, it is less expensive
and less crowded than restaurants near campus.
Tables were surprisingly unfilled, even considering
that we were visiting the Chinese Inn right after
Thanksgiving when many people are not yet ready to
indulge in another feast.
With some help, this little-known eatery could be
come an "inn" restaurant in more than one sense of
the word. So next time you head to the nearest Chinese
restaurant, drive just a little farther down El Camino.
