I feel compelled to begin this week's review with an apology. Two
months ago, I invited you to join me in an exploration of exciting
eateries througout the Bay Area. Then, after only two reviews, my
name disappeared from the Daily. I apologize for my absence; un
fortunately, I stuck my face in front of someone's foot during a soccer
game against Fresno State, and the results were four fractures in my
face and a swollen eye. However, my mouth and taste buds have now
| recovered, and I am anxious to embark upon a new culinary journey.
This one, I hope, will last longer than the last one!
Last Friday night, I jumped into my high-powered, front-wheel
drive rickshaw and raced over to Feng Yuan. During the breezy jour
tfey down Middlefield road, I thought about how many good meals I
had eaten at this restaurant, and I hoped that this one would be a re
peat of past performances.
The atmosphere at Feng Yuan is not exactly conducive to intimate,
romantic dining. There are two wide-open dining rooms that are
brightly lit and are filled with formica tables. However, the
mosphere really isn't important here, for it is the quality of tlie rood
that makes most people return to Feng Yuan again and again. As at
most Chinese restaurants, the menu is quite extensive, but unlike most
} other places, virtually anything you order at Feng Yuan will be good.
We began our meal with two fairly common appetizers egg rolls
and barbecued spare ribs. Both of these dishes were, however, far from
being ordinary. The egg rolls (three for $2.50) were prepared just the
way I like them a flavorful blend of who-knows-what stuffed inside
a crunchy shell and served with a tasty sweet and sour sauce. The
barbecued spare ribs (half-order for $2.50) were also a delight five
baby ribs dipped in a wonderful sweet sauce and cooked to perfection.
I also tried the Hot and Sour Soup, which was recommended to me by

our waiter. I would like to tell you what was in it, but I really don't
know. It was a fascinating concoction of just about everything you can
imagine, cooked into a broth and then highly seasoned truly de
licious! The Won-Ton Soup is also very good, if you do not feel like
being adventurous.
I have tried 12 different entrees at Feng Yuan, and I have enjoyed
them all, though some are better than others. I especially recommend
the Hunan Beef ($4.75) slices of beef smothered in a tangy, garlic
sauce and garnished with crisp, steamed broccoli, and Twice Cooked
Pork ($4.50) which is served with several exotic oriental vegetables.
Prawns with Lobster Sauce, House Special Chicken and Mongolian
Beef are also very good. If you happen to go to Feng Yuan in a group,
be sure to take advantage of their special Mandarin or Cantonese Din
ners, because they allow you to try many different dishes.
All good Chinese restaurants serve high-quality appetizers and en
trees, but the really good ones make sure that everything from the wa
ter to the soy sauce is something special. In addition to their marvelous
appetizers and main dishes, Feng Yuan offers a wonderful oolong tea
which complements the meal perfectly, and the house wine (the
burgundy at least) is quite drinkable.
Feng Yuan also has very special service. Ido not know if this restau
rant is operated by just one family, but it is certainly run like a family
business. The man who usually seats the patrons is warm and friendly,
and the waiters are all courteous and efficient. They will go out of their
way to please you. At the end of the evening, the kitchen crew emerges,
and all of the employees sit down together for dinner. This kind of
family gathering isn't seen in restaurants very often any more. It's spe
cial —just like the restaurant. Feng Yuan is a wonderful, little Chinese
restaurant which serves very tasty, high-quality food at a reasonable
price. So, if you have just Finished your final in Comparative Chinese
Relations, or if you simply have a craving for good Chinese food, give
Feng Yuan a try.

I feel compelled to begin this week's review with an apology. Two
months ago, I invited you to join me in an exploration of exciting
eateries througout the Bay Area. Then, after only two reviews, my
name disappeared from the Daily. I apologize for my absence; un
fortunately, I stuck my face in front of someone's foot during a soccer
game against Fresno State, and the results were four fractures in my
face and a swollen eye. However, my mouth and taste buds have now
| recovered, and I am anxious to embark upon a new culinary journey.
This one, I hope, will last longer than the last one!
Last Friday night, I jumped into my high-powered, front-wheel
drive rickshaw and raced over to Feng Yuan. During the breezy jour
tfey down Middlefield road, I thought about how many good meals I
had eaten at this restaurant, and I hoped that this one would be a re
peat of past performances.
The atmosphere at Feng Yuan is not exactly conducive to intimate,
romantic dining. There are two wide-open dining rooms that are
brightly lit and are filled with formica tables. However, the
mosphere really isn't important here, for it is the quality of tlie rood
that makes most people return to Feng Yuan again and again. As at
most Chinese restaurants, the menu is quite extensive, but unlike most
} other places, virtually anything you order at Feng Yuan will be good.
We began our meal with two fairly common appetizers egg rolls
and barbecued spare ribs. Both of these dishes were, however, far from
being ordinary. The egg rolls (three for $2.50) were prepared just the
way I like them a flavorful blend of who-knows-what stuffed inside
a crunchy shell and served with a tasty sweet and sour sauce. The
barbecued spare ribs (half-order for $2.50) were also a delight five
baby ribs dipped in a wonderful sweet sauce and cooked to perfection.
I also tried the Hot and Sour Soup, which was recommended to me by

our waiter. I would like to tell you what was in it, but I really don't
know. It was a fascinating concoction of just about everything you can
imagine, cooked into a broth and then highly seasoned truly de
licious! The Won-Ton Soup is also very good, if you do not feel like
being adventurous.
I have tried 12 different entrees at Feng Yuan, and I have enjoyed
them all, though some are better than others. I especially recommend
the Hunan Beef ($4.75) slices of beef smothered in a tangy, garlic
sauce and garnished with crisp, steamed broccoli, and Twice Cooked
Pork ($4.50) which is served with several exotic oriental vegetables.
Prawns with Lobster Sauce, House Special Chicken and Mongolian
Beef are also very good. If you happen to go to Feng Yuan in a group,
be sure to take advantage of their special Mandarin or Cantonese Din
ners, because they allow you to try many different dishes.
All good Chinese restaurants serve high-quality appetizers and en
trees, but the really good ones make sure that everything from the wa
ter to the soy sauce is something special. In addition to their marvelous
appetizers and main dishes, Feng Yuan offers a wonderful oolong tea
which complements the meal perfectly, and the house wine (the
burgundy at least) is quite drinkable.
Feng Yuan also has very special service. Ido not know if this restau
rant is operated by just one family, but it is certainly run like a family
business. The man who usually seats the patrons is warm and friendly,
and the waiters are all courteous and efficient. They will go out of their
way to please you. At the end of the evening, the kitchen crew emerges,
and all of the employees sit down together for dinner. This kind of
family gathering isn't seen in restaurants very often any more. It's spe
cial —just like the restaurant. Feng Yuan is a wonderful, little Chinese
restaurant which serves very tasty, high-quality food at a reasonable
price. So, if you have just Finished your final in Comparative Chinese
Relations, or if you simply have a craving for good Chinese food, give
Feng Yuan a try.
