# Burglary-suspect couple must appear at court trial
## 
### KRISTEN CHRISTOPHER Senior staff writer 
One of the eight burglary-related
charges against suspect Maureen
O'Connor was dropped as a result of a
preliminary hearing, but both she and
her husband, Robert O'Connor, will
have to appear at the official court trial,
according to a deputy district attorney.
The O'Connors are suspected to have
been involved in the theft of property
from Peninsula homes in the last year.
The purpose of the hearing, held in
San Jose Municipal Court, was to de
termine whether the couple would have
to make the later appearance at the trial
in Santa Clara County Superior Court.
Evidence presented at the hearing, in
cluding a letter written by Robert
O'Connor to his son, led Loraine
O'Keefe, a Santa Clara County deputy
district attorney, to call it "a good case
for the prosecution."
The couple's suspected involvement
in burglaries of property worth more
than $2 million from area homes, in
cluding several on-campus residences,
led to their arrest on Nov. 11. They were
both charged with eight burglary-re
lated counts, but the charge of auto
theft against Maureen O'Connor was
officially dropped on Friday morning
when the four-day hearing ended.
That charge was dropped because
there was no evidence that Maureen
O'Connor ever drove the stolen Volks

wagen van, O'Keefe said, but "there
was circumstantial evidence of the oth
er crimes."
Included among the evidence is a bag
containing "traditional burglar items,"
such as a ski mask, bolt cutters and
gloves, according to O'Keefe. The fact
that stolen goods were found in a
bedroom where Maureen O'Connor's
checkbook and a magazine addressed
to her were located also implicates her
in the crimes, she added.
Craig Collins, Maureen O'Connor's
attorney, said that he does not think
there is evidence that his client partici
pated in any of the crimes, but "If I were
the judge and I were going to hold her
on anything, it would be the auto
charge."
Since the van was sitting in front of
the house, Maureen O'Connor at least
knew of its presence, but since the other
stolen goods were found under mat
tresses and in other hidden places there
is no evidence she knew they existed,
Collins said. "The whole thing is hard
to understand," he said.
A bail-reduction hearing for
Maureen O'Connor will be held on
Dec. 13 as part of the arraignment hear
ing, according to Collins. Evidence to
support her being released on her own
recognizance will also be sent to court
before that date, he said.
The date for the trial will be de
termined at the arraignment hearing.
