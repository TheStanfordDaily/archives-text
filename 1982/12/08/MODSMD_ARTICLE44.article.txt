### STEVE ODELL 
Stanford won its first tour
nament in 11 years by crowning
Temple 77-70 in the cham
pionship game of the Stanford
Invitational Basketball Tour
nament Saturday night at Maples
Pavilion.
Cardinal center John Revelli
was named the most valuable
player of the tournament, com
piling 31 points and 16 rebounds
in the two-day, four-team tour
ney.
Stanford, now 4-0 and off to its
best start since 1964, defeated La
fayette 80-54 Friday evening to
reach the finals, while Temple
trounced Rhode Island 92-56.
"This is a great win for us,"
said Stanford coach Tom Davis,
"because we kept our poise and
composure down the stretch.
Temple's a tremendous ball club.
We handled the pressure well,
and made adjustments on the
floor when they switched de
fenses on us."
The Cardinal led 63-52 when
the Owls staged one last come
back bid with 7:06 remaining.
All-America Granger Hall hit
two foul shots, Terrence
Stansbury scored from the top of
the key, and Jim McLoughlin
bombed one home from 22 feet,
and suddenly Temple was within
six.
But the Card answered with a
seven-point run of its own. Steve
Brown made two free throws and
all-tournament player Keith
Jones scored two of his team
high 19 points by taking a long
pass from Keith Ramee for a fast
break lay-in. Revelli hit one foul
shot before Andy Fischer com
pleted the streak with a short
bank shot off an offensive re
bound to give Stanford a 70-58
lead with 3:56 left.
The Cardinal then went into a
spread-out, delay offense called
"The Roll," working time off the
clock until either Jones or Ramee
could break free for an uncon
tested backdoor lay-up.
Stansbury, who led all scorers in
the championship game with 25
points, fired in several more long
range jump shots, but it was not
enough.
The game was interrupted
shortly into the second half when
the Owls's B.J. Jones intentional

lv hit Fischer in the back of the
head with a forearm, putting the
Cardinal freshman flat on his
back. An angered Davis stormed
onto the court and was con
fronted halfway to his player by
Temple coach John Cheyney.
The two coaches tussled and
exchanged words before assistant
coaches, players, and referees
stepped in. Jones was ejected im
mediately. "I really was upset
with that," said Davis. "It was
obviously a cheap shot. The
game had gotten a little out-of
control. When you see one of
your kids lying on the floor,
you're not going to react in the
most rational manner.
"There are no hard feelings on
my behalf," he continued. "I'm
sure John has similar strong feel
ings with the way he interpreted
what happened. I was more con
cerned with Andy than anything
else."

Fischer eventually returned to
the game, and finished with five
points while continuing his
steady play and crisp passing in
side.
After the scuffle the officials
called a tight game in an attempt
to tame the action under the
boards. As a result, they whistled
28 fouls in the second half.
The Owls took full advantage,
connecting on 18-of-21 foul
shots, with Hall going 11-for-l 1.
Stanford was not so productive,
hitting only 21-of-36 free throws,
including some key misses down
the stretch.
"The bigger the stakes, the
lower the percentages are going
to be," said Davis of the misses.
"I don't want to dwell on the
negative. It's just something that
we've got to accept right now.
We'll get better."
