# Card riding hot streak Stanford wins in San Jose
## 
### LIBBY LEONARD 
Although the weather has
turned cold, the women's basket
ball team is on a hot streak, win
ning its last three contests with a
fiery touch.
Head coach Dotty McCrea is
impressed with her team's recent
progress.
"I really felt a lot of things
I came together last weekend,"
: McCrea said. "We're playing
much better as a team."
The team effort is what helped
the Cardinal claim first place in
the Third Annual Anheiser
Busch Classic last weekend in
San Jose.
Stanford upset Texas Tech in
the first round 77-70 and then
romped San Jose State 84-66 in
: the final.
Stanford trailed Texas Tech by
Atwo at the half, but McCrea
the Cardinal to a zone
defense and the Red Raiders
. couldn't adjust.
Senior Kim Kupferer came off
the bench to score 13 points and
help orchestrate an offensive
surge for the Card.
Freshman Virginia Sourlis
scored 18 points while seniors
Meg Metzger and Jeanne Hoff
combined for 28 points and 12 re
bounds to round up the Cardinal
scoring.
A In a fast-breaking game Fri-
the Card ousted the small
and quick Spartans, while the
San Jose free-lance, hurried style
of play could not overrun the
Card's disciplined offense.
"Once we started controlling
the defensive boards, that's when
the game turned around,"
McCrea said.
The Card came out agressively
in the second half, built a quick
10-point lead and dictated the
game's tempo the rest of the way.
"We didn't let up at all,"
WMcCrea said. "Which is some
thing we haven't done in the

past."
Veteran post players Metzger
and Hoff scored 22 and 19 points,
respectively. Metzger sunk 9-
of-12 shots, including many from
long range.
Hoff connected on 7-of-12
shots and pulled down seven re
bounds. Against San Jose,
McCrea cleared her bench and
nine players contributed to the
scoring.
Stanford sported the fourth
best free throw percentage in the
nation last season and main
tained its record, netting 86 per
cent of their shots from the line in
the championship.
Metzger, Hoff and Sourlis
earned All-Tournament honors.
Although Sourlis received over
200 scholarship offers last year,
she chose to become a Cardinal
"because of Dotty McCrea and
Stanford's academics."
The rookie point guard has
quickly found her niche in
McCrea's structured system as
the assist artist.
Besides a goal of scoring in
double figures each game, Sourlis

sees her job as directing traffic on
the court and running the of
fense.
"It's going to take another
four or five games to get full con
trol of the players on the floor,"
Sourlis said.
Stanford hosts San Jose State
again tonight in what McCrea
hopes will be a rerun of last
week's game.
The Card faces Utah Friday in
the first round of the Santa Clara
Invitational and then will work
on their transition game at prac
tice over the holidays.
"I think we can run the ball
even better than we have been,"
McCrea said. "We will score on
the break if we run using good
judgements."
Stanford also faces four com
petitive teams in Maples Pavilion
over the Christmas break includ
ing San Francisco, Pepperdine,
Las Vegas and UCLA.
"We need to win these games,"
McCrea said. "We have to start
to believe that we are one of the
best teams in the West."
