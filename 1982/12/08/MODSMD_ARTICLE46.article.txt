Stanford's men's and wom
en's swimming coaches used
the Stanford Invitational last
weekend to gauge the training
performance of their squads
and both were pleased.
"We wanted to find out
where we were in training,"
said men's coach Skip Ken

ney. "We swam competitively
for where we are right now."
The women's team also
swam well and met many of
the minimum time standards
that must be broken in order
to qualify for the NCAA
Championships.
Among those who broke
the time standards were Mar
vbeth Linzmeier, Kim

Carlisle, Kathy Smith and
Patti Gavin.
"We swam well," women's
coach George Haines said.
"Right now, we are about 300
percent ahead of where we
were last year at this time."
Stanford divers Kim Jones,
Tracev Stewart, Jeanne
Meyer and Tori Pulskamp
swept the top four spots in

both women's events.
In the men's events, Tom
Rothenbucher led the field
followed closely by Mike
Leahev, Thor Johnson and
Chris Graviss.
"I'm pleased with our
progress," said diving coach
Rick Schavone, "but we have
some more work to do."
