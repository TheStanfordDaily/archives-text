# Stanford ruggers place fifth
## Veteran clubs dominate tourney 
### RUDI SEESALL 
I he Stanford-Steinlager 10-A-
Side Rugby Tournament again
saw the dominance of the older
and more experienced club teams
Saturday, with the Old Blues de
feating the San Jose Seahawks
14-10 in the overtime final match.
The Stanford men's first team
came away with a fifth-place fin
ish, beating UC-Davis 12-6 and
trouncing Santa Rosa 20-4.
l-irst-round matches were un
derway by 8:30 a.m. and were
marked by the advances of the
Old Blues, the Seahawks, the
BATS and the Palo Alto XOs.
Stanford, meanwhile, was busy
posting a come-from-behind vic
tory over UC-Davis.
Davis scored in the first half on
a long break from a line-out.
Loose play by the forwards was
rough and a bit disorganized for
Stanford in the early going and
the backs never really got open
with the ball. Stanford's pros

pects seemed to falter more when
Captain Dave Andrews was side
lined with an injury in the early
going.
Stanford burst out in the sec
ond half and the pace of the game
quickly turned to Stanford's ad
vantage. Four minutes into the
half Tom "Sparkplug" Dickson
raced 30 yards with the ball after
a well-executed second phase in
itiated by good rucking by the
forwards. Three minutes later
Morgan Morgan burst through
Davis' backline and ran in for the
try untouched, to put Stanford
ahead for good.
In the second round Stanford
met the XOs and Stanford's rela
tive inexperience showed as the
XO's shut them out 8-0. The
older players were able to ruck
better on the wet field and pre
vent Stanford from mounting an
effective attack. Stanford's de
fense, led by the tenacious tackl
ing of Victor "Scars" Sanvito,

fared better in holding the XO's
to eight points.
Stanford defeated Santa Rosa
in its third game in a physical
match highlighted by Dickson's
inspired kicking game. Dogged
pressure Stanford for
wards continually gave the
Cardinal breaks, leading to tries
bv Morgan, Sam Aronson and
two by Dickson.
The other three Stanford
teams demonstrated intense play
although higher-place finishes
were prevented by early round
losses. After an initial defeat, the
second team posted three straight
victories to win the consolation
title.
The tournament was run by
the club's officers and netted sig
nificant revenue towards the
club's Australian Tour in June.
Regular season play begins Janu
ary 8 at Santa Clara.
