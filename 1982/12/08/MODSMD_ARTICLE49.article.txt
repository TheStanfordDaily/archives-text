# Hoyas drop a spot in AP hoops poll
## 
### Associated Press 
Two more decisive victories
over out-manned opponents last
week kept unbeaten Virginia on
top of The Associated Press col
lege basketball poll announced
Monday.
The Cavaliers, who battered
James Madison 51-34 and Vir
ginia Military 86-41 last week, re
ceived 49 first place ballots and
totaled 1149 points in the na
tionwide poll of sports writers
and broadcasters.
That gave Virginia a com
fortable 80-point lead over Ken
tucky, which moved up a notch
to No. 2 on the strength of vic
tories over Notre Dame, 58-45,
and Villanova, 93-79. The Wild
cats totaled 1069 points and had
six first place votes.
Kentucky's advance to No. 2

dropped Georgetown back to
third place this week and upset a
long-anticipated confrontation
between Virginia and the Hoyas
next Saturday night. Had
Georgetown maintained its posi
tion, that contest would have
matched the nation's top two
teams. Now it will be No. 1
against No. 3.
