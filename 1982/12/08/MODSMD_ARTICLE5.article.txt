# New fraternity gets official recognition
## 
### SID ATKINS Staff writer 
The University officially recognized
the Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity on
Monday, after it settled the remaining
problems with the organization's na
tional branch, according to Diana Con
klin, director of the Row.
The agreement ended a year-and-a
half long discussion between fraternity
members and the Row Office about the
various statutes in the group's constitu
tion.
"University recognition means that
they can be called the Stanford Univer
sity Chapter of their fraternity," said
Conklin."They can use University facil
ities, and hold rush on campus."
Derrick Strahorn, a member of the
fraternity, said that Kappa Alpha Psi is
one of three predominantly black
fraternities that exist on campus and the
first one to be officially recognized by
the University. The two unrecognized
black fraternities are Omega Psi Phi
and Alpha Phi Alpha.
According to both Conklin and
Strahorn, the basic problem keeping
the group from being recognized was
that the University wanted it to secure a
certain amount of autonomy from the
national organization.
"This is the major question when any
group seeks University recognition,"
Conklin said. "It is embedded in the
philosopy of the University and the way
we treat students that we hold them re
sponsible for their own actions." Con
klin said that Stanford is unique in this
respect.
Recently, the University received a
letter from the fraternity's national or
ganization stating that the University

has priority whenever there is a conflict
between the University's rules and the
national organization's constitution.
This blanket statement cleared the way
for the fraternity's acceptance.
Conklin said that there is no possi
bility of the fraternity receiving a house
in the near future. "We're not even ac
cepting petitions for housing right now,
and there are three groups who were
recognized in front of them who would
have priority," she said.
Strahorn said that while his fraterni
ty, which has only 11 members, was
basically the same as others on campus,
there are some differences. "We are a
little less socially oriented than other
fraternities," he said."We don't con
sider ourselves as a social group as
much as an organization to help its
members achieve. Our organization
also attempts to build character and
leadership qualities in its members."
Strahorn said there is a definite need
for a black fraternity on campus, citing
the current lack of an organization
where black male students can get to
know and become close to each other.
Kappa Alpha Psi was founded at In
diana University in 1911 to support
black males at predominantly white
schools. Since then non-black people
have joined the fraternity. Said
Strahorn:"Presently, the Stanford
chapter has all black members, but we
do not discriminate against whites,
Chicanos, Asians or anybody else who
wants to join."
Though Kappa Alpha Psi plans to
hold rush this spring, Strahorn said that
this is also done in a different manner.
"We don't give bids or have rush parties
the way other fraternities do," Strahorn
said.
Conklin said that the University re
quires all fraternities to clearly demon
strate that they are open to all members
of the community, and that Kappa
Alpha Psi is no exception. "They say
they will exhibit this in printed matter
this spring," she said.
"If someone came to us and said that
they were denied admission to a
fraternity or sorority because of their
race, we'd look into it," Conklin said.

She added that this has never happened
while she has been at Stanford.
The Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity is the
second group to receive University rec
ognition this year. The Sigma Tau Del
ta Sorority was recognized this Octo
ber. Since 1977, there have only been a
total of four fraternities and sororities
recognized by the University. None of
these groups presently have houses.
Strahorn said that fraternity mem
bers have been so wrapped up in the
process of getting recognized that they
have not had much time to plan any ac
tivities. "I definitely think we'll be hav
ing some sort of celebration in the next
few days, though," he said.

strate that they are open to all members
of the community, and that Kappa
Alpha Psi is no exception. "They say
they will exhibit this in printed matter
this spring," she said.
"If someone came to us and said that
they were denied admission to a
fraternity or sorority because of their
race, we'd look into it," Conklin said.

She added that this has never happened
while she has been at Stanford.
The Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity is the
second group to receive University rec
ognition this year. The Sigma Tau Del
ta Sorority was recognized this Octo
ber. Since 1977, there have only been a
total of four fraternities and sororities
recognized by the University. None of
these groups presently have houses.
Strahorn said that fraternity mem
bers have been so wrapped up in the
process of getting recognized that they
have not had much time to plan any ac
tivities. "I definitely think we'll be hav
ing some sort of celebration in the next
few days, though," he said.
The University officially recognized
the Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity on
Monday, after it settled the remaining
problems with the organization's na
tional branch, according to Diana Con
klin, director of the Row.
The agreement ended a year-and-a
half long discussion between fraternity
members and the Row Office about the
various statutes in the group's constitu
tion.
"University recognition means that
they can be called the Stanford Univer
sity Chapter of their fraternity," said
Conklin."They can use University facil
ities, and hold rush on campus."
Derrick Strahorn, a member of the
fraternity, said that Kappa Alpha Psi is
one of three predominantly black
fraternities that exist on campus and the
first one to be officially recognized by
the University. The two unrecognized
black fraternities are Omega Psi Phi
and Alpha Phi Alpha.
According to both Conklin and
Strahorn, the basic problem keeping
the group from being recognized was
that the University wanted it to secure a
certain amount of autonomy from the
national organization.
"This is the major question when any
group seeks University recognition,"
Conklin said. "It is embedded in the
philosopy of the University and the way
we treat students that we hold them re
sponsible for their own actions." Con
klin said that Stanford is unique in this
respect.
Recently, the University received a
letter from the fraternity's national or
ganization stating that the University

has priority whenever there is a conflict
between the University's rules and the
national organization's constitution.
This blanket statement cleared the way
for the fraternity's acceptance.
Conklin said that there is no possi
bility of the fraternity receiving a house
in the near future. "We're not even ac
cepting petitions for housing right now,
and there are three groups who were
recognized in front of them who would
have priority," she said.
Strahorn said that while his fraterni
ty, which has only 11 members, was
basically the same as others on campus,
there are some differences. "We are a
little less socially oriented than other
fraternities," he said."We don't con
sider ourselves as a social group as
much as an organization to help its
members achieve. Our organization
also attempts to build character and
leadership qualities in its members."
Strahorn said there is a definite need
for a black fraternity on campus, citing
the current lack of an organization
where black male students can get to
know and become close to each other.
Kappa Alpha Psi was founded at In
diana University in 1911 to support
black males at predominantly white
schools. Since then non-black people
have joined the fraternity. Said
Strahorn:"Presently, the Stanford
chapter has all black members, but we
do not discriminate against whites,
Chicanos, Asians or anybody else who
wants to join."
Though Kappa Alpha Psi plans to
hold rush this spring, Strahorn said that
this is also done in a different manner.
"We don't give bids or have rush parties
the way other fraternities do," Strahorn
said.
Conklin said that the University re
quires all fraternities to clearly demon
strate that they are open to all members
of the community, and that Kappa
Alpha Psi is no exception. "They say
they will exhibit this in printed matter
this spring," she said.
"If someone came to us and said that
they were denied admission to a
fraternity or sorority because of their
race, we'd look into it," Conklin said.

She added that this has never happened
while she has been at Stanford.
