# Union votes on agreement today
## 
### Associated Press 
Washington Ed Garvey, the
chief negotiator for the National
Football League Players Union,
said the full membership of the
union will likely ratify a five
year, $1.6 billion collective
bargaining agreement today.
Players representatives voted
19-9 Monday to recommend that
the 1500 players who struck for
57 days approve the agreement
negotiated by the union and the
owners' Management Council.
It was the second vote by the
representatives to send the agree
ment to the union's rank and file,
and the first in which they recom
mended, by a two-thirds vote, its
ratification. On Nov. 16, when
the agreement was announced,
they voted 19-6 with three
abstentions to send the agree
ment to the players, but that vote
carried with it no recommenda
tion.
A number of changes were
agreed to by both sides in a series
of subsequent meetings between

union and management leaders.
Union chief Ed Garvey said
the document had been "sub
stantially improved."
"Negotiations over the past
three weeks have improved the
agreement to the point where
two-thirds of the reps and (union
president) Gene Upshaw now
recommend ratification," Gar
vey said. "Had we formally voted
at our rep meeting two weeks
ago, a clear majority would not
have recommended ratification."
The union's 1500 members will
be given the choice of voting to
accept the contract, reject it or,
abstain. If the vote is "over
whelming one way or another,"
the results will be announced to
night.
Among the contract changes
made since Nov. 16 were:
• Pay protection for players
should the NFL expand the cur
rent 16-game schedule. Union of
ficials had charged the league
with trying to lengthen the regu
lar season to 18 games in 1983

while continuing to base wages
on a 16-game schedule. Man
agement officials deny any plans
to expand the regular season.
• The 1983 draft must be
held in May. The league, which
had sought to move the draft up
to February, did win the right to
do so after 1984, to within six
days of the Pro Bowl or, if the Pro
Bowl is not played, within 10
days of the Super Bowl.
• An impartial arbitrator
can postpone a players' club-or
dered suspension, for the first
time, until he renders a decision.
• Career-ending injury pro
tection increased to $65,000. Un
der the contract which expired in
July, the maximum pay for a ca
reer ending injury was $37,500.
In the agreement of Nov. 16 it
was $50,000. Management of
ficials say increasing the injury
protection was the idea of Pit
tsburgh Steelers president Dan
Rooney, who used it in exchange
for Garvev and Upshaw's prom
ise to recommend ratification.
