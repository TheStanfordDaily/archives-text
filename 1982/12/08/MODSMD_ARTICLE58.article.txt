## Clarence Clemons and crony crank at Keystone 
### JEFF SANTOSUOSSO 
Tremendous. That's the word
for Clarence Clemons and the
Red Bank Rockers' concert last
Friday at the Keystone Palo
Alto. Tremendous. Everything
about it was tremendous.
Clarence and his band, playing
their brand of "rock and roll for
your soul,"' had the crowd hoot
ing and hollering and singing and
dancing throughout the show.
When the Boss (yes, Spring
steen !) joined the band for its sec
ond encore, the obligatory frenzy
ensued. But more on that later. >
Springsteen may have been the
event, but Clarence most certain
ly was the concert. I wish that I
could provide an emphatic ex
pletive to say just how tremen
dous the band was, but I can't.
So, I'll just say that they were
tremendous.
Clad in a purple dress shirt and
matching funky purple satin tie,
Panama hat, blue blazer and
wedding ring, Clarence saun
tered onstage, beaming im
periously, and possessed the few
hundred on hand. Without a
word, he lit into the instrumental
"Small Things." This upbeat
number sparked the mood of en
joyment that endured the length
of the performance.
On the next song, "Working
Man," Clarence actually belted
out the vocals himself, and with
real verve! The effort got him
sweating, so he took off his jacket
with real panache. Always pan
ache and verve. It also got him
talking. So despite taking over on
vocals, Clarence built up an
honest, emotional rapport with
the crowd. He dedicated "Wom
en Got Power" to his new wife,
saying that his life was "getting
better and better and ..."
"What Kind of Fool" marked
a turning point in the concert, as
raspy guitar work and angst-rid

den vocals gave the band a
chance to demonstrate the in
tensity with which it could per
form. Clarence's solo work was
its most tremendous. The "Big
Man" poured his whole body
into his tenor sax; and the au
dience could feel it. It was not the
time for stylishly dipping the sax.
It was the time for playing,
playing tremendously.
In the next number, "I've Been
Loving You," Clarence said
what was already quite apparent,
"I've got a kind of love in me
comin' from inside." He didn't
need to say it. It was obvious that
the man loves what he's doing.
But he didn't get overly sen
timental. "Water Runnin' " fea
tured a melodic solo that saw
Clarence dancing around the
stage. Now was the time for style.
Then, he introduced the
night's best set, beginning with
"Try a Little Tenderness."
Buoyed by soap-operatic organ
fills, the song began like a lullaby,
with Clarence holding his hat
over his heart and gazing somber
ly at some distant banner or old
flame. The nearly a cappella vo
cals were then joined by some re
ally ballsy backup work, which
incited everyone offstage and on
into a foot-stomping euphoria.
"Soul Serenade" was dedi
cated to Isaac Curtis, "the
greatest saxophoneplayer that
ever lived." It was a simple, quiet
number and a nice contrast from
the rollicking number that pre
ceded it. And it also afforded
Clarence an opportunity to re
sume command. He stood in the
spotlight, the sweat of intensity
dripping off his body, as the mo
ment protracted itself in one of
those indelible images that lasts
forever. Finally, he ripped the
solo open. It was all sax as the
drenched Clarence displayed the
tremendous capacity of his lungs.

Immediately though, at the
height of the solo, he stopped
short. As the band went into a
near little rhythm, he introduced
them, the most unlikely looking
rock group I've ever seen. (But
they could play.)
His rapport was excellent as he
teased his band until he brought
the crowd "back to our regularly
scheduled program." In "Para
dise by the Sea," another foot
stomper, he stood between the
two guitarists, seemingly bereft
of all control, as the two dueled
guitar solos. Quite corny, but full
of style.
The crowd let out a tremen
dous roar of approval before all
the Red Bankers could leave the
stage. They returned within five
minutes, as Clarence led the vo
cals on "the story of my life,"
"Rockin' Around the World."
"A Certain Girl" ended the en
core with everyone in the au
dience singing. They left once
more as Clarence happily said,
"God loves you. We'll see you
next time."
Everyone was hysterical.
Clarence had been tremendous.

That man of such tremendous
size with those tremendous lungs
and a tremendous love of life
gave a tremendous performance.
And then it happened. A stage
hand brought another guitar on
stage. Everyone screamed and
squeezed themselves to the stage
because those in front had seen
the Boss earlier and passed the
news back to those who were
seated at the tables. Springsteen
walked on stage with the band for
their second encore. Springsteen.
They played two numbers, in
cluding the Little Richard classic,
"Lucille," that had everyone
screaming in ecstasy. Springsteen
didn't talk or even establish eye
contact with those in the front
row, but the ovation was gigan
tic. Even he was laughing in dis

belief! f guess the Beatles taught
us something about this kind of
reaction when they appeared on
the Ed Sullivan Show. Still, if
Springsteen received a huge ova
tion merely because he stood on
stage, Clarence and the Red
Bank Rockers garnered a tre
mendous one because of their
performance.
Sprinsteen gave us the Elvis
spaghetti-legs and the Chuck

Berrv phallic guitar solo. He and
Clarence danced back and forth
across the stage in sync, remind
ing us of their antics when Sprins
teen is the headliner.
But he wasn't, Clarence was.
And he gave a headline per
formance. Springsteen is a show
man nonpareil when he has time
to develop his rapport, but this
performance consisted of only
two songs played in unbroken
succession. It seemed that al
though he wanted to have some
fun with Clarence and the band,
he didn't want to steal their thun
der. And that was fair because
Clarence and the Red Bank
Rockers gave a performance that
paralyzed in its charisma and in
tensity from the beginning. It was
tremendous.
