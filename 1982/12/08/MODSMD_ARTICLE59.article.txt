# Far from the summertime blues

Just as Laurie Anderson can be
said to be the future of pop mu
sic, Marshall Crenshaw's debut
album for Warner Brothers,
Marshall Crenshaw, draws splen
didly from its past. Crenshaw's
music is delightfully reminiscent
of Buddy Holly, Elvis Presley
and even Diana Ross and the Su
preme*. It's an album so full of
fun and vigor, an album that
sounds so right, it drives away all
bad thoughts. Crenshaw makes it
sound so easy and effortless, you
wonder why other pop stars like
Hall and Oates and The Pointer

Sisters have had only sporadic
success at it. This album provides
the biggest pop delights of the
year.
One listens to this album's
smooth vocals, lazy beat and
sparkling licks is guaranteed to
bring a smile to one's face. It's the
ultimate in summer albums
good times, fun and romance,
and none of it takes itselftoo seri
ously. Romances may soon
break up, or may have already,
but the promise of another one
lying just ahead still remains. In
"There She Goes Again,"
Cranshaw's old lover dates guy
after guy, when all the while, ev
eryone knows she should be dat
ing him. "Brand New Lover" is
the other side of this. Rather than
wait for the old girlfriend to re

alize what a fool she's been, he s
got to find a new one. No prob
lem. Then there's "Someday,
Somewhere" which goes back to
the premise of "There She Goes
Again." Romance is wonderful
in these songs no matter what
stage it's in, whether it s antici
patory, in full bloom or almost
over.
The album's best song, also its
most optimistic and romantic, is
ironically called "Cynical Girl.
It's warm, lovely and a delight.
Lvrics like "I'm goin out, I m
goin' out lookin' for a cynical
girl./ We'll have no use for the
real world," and "I'll know right
awav bv the look in her eyes," let
us know that this is no cynic. He's
just as romantic as the rest of us,
searching for the right kind of

lover.
Crenshaw's vocals and jangly
guitar are wonderfully backed by
his brother Robert's drums and
thbass of Chris Denato. It's a
combination that works on all of
the songs. Crenshaw got his start
playing John Lennon in the road
show of Beatlemania, but it's a
connection that goes farther that.
Crenshaw's music owes much to
the early Beatles and late Lennon
like "Starting Over."
Marshall Crenshaw is simply a
wonderful album. Crenshaw has
no rival when it comes to great
summer and goodtimes music,
except for perhaps the Go-Go's.
It's an album sure to cure any de
pression, an album that you have
to smile at, and that's sure to
leave you feeling good.
