## 
### JULIE RYAN Staff writer 
Despite tight schedules and some bad
weather, the Governor's Corner suites
are expected to be completed by Dec. 21
so that 260 students can move in next
quarter as planned.
Students living in Manzanita Park
will begin moving their belongings to
storage centers today in preparation for
the opening, according to Governor's
Corner Director Janet Van Houten.
Van Houten said that both the suites
and the eating clubs will be completed
on time, but there is not much margin

for error.
"Construction crews are working
like crazy," she said, "but there are
always gliches."
One of these may be the late arrival of
the panel for some of the eating clubs,
she said. Most of the carpet in the suites
has been laid and the furniture is being
held in storage, she added.
The recent storm caused some dam
age and concern about the final stages
of construction, but Tom Mills, con
struction superintendent, said the
storm caused only minor delays.
Mills said he anticipates about 10

days of nice weather,"so we can finish
the asphalt paving." If the weather re
mains clear some landscaping will be
done over winter break. Otherwise,
Mills said it will be completed in Janu
ary or February.
Students in Manzanita are supposed
to be completely moved out of their
trailer by Dec. 18, but according to Van
Houten, special arrangements may be
made if for some reason students are
unable to do this. Trucks are running
between Manzanita and the storage
center to make this move as easy as pos
sible.

have the housing ready for the 260 students who will
move in next quarter.
