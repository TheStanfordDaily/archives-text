# Sounds from the past and future of pop
## An artist's avant Americana 
### JOE MADER Laurie Anderson 
Big Science
Warner Brothers

One of the best new pop music
artists isn't from the Los Angeles
club scene, nor the New York
club scene, nor any city's club
scene. All the usual rock and pop
conventions simply don't apply
when one is speaking of Laurie
Anderson, who received her start
with an M.F.A. degree in
sculpture from Columbia Uni
versity, and has had several
works of sculpture exhibited at
New York's Museum of Modern
Art. What's surprising is that

even with these impressive
credentials, Anderson is delving
into pop music, and with the re
lease of her first album for
Warner Brothers, Big Science,
one can only be glad she did. Big
Science is one of the most in
novative, provocative and im
portant albums of the year. An
derson's wit and intelligence pro
vide us with a chillingly accurate
portrait of our society and its pe
culiarities, and ranks with X's
Under The Big Black Sun as one

of the best albums of the year.
Anderson's songs aren't songs
in the usual sense of the word;
they're more like scenes, spoken
phrases that are immediately fa
miliar, backed by a single
rhythmic chord or note that
keeps repeating itself. "Please ex
tinguish all cigarettes./ Place
your trays in their upright,
locked position," we hear in
"From the Air." "Hi, I'm not
home right now. But if you want
to leave a message, just start talk
ing at the sound of the tone," she
sings in "O Superman." These
phrases evoke images of a society

in which the inhabitants have
various ways and sayings which
keep them from communicating
freely, face to face. One of the
most apparent examples is, not
ironically, at the beginning of
"Example No. 22." In it a tele
phone rings so clearly and dis
tinctly that the first few times I
heard it, I got up to answer my
own telephone. Anderson knows
that these sounds and phrases
evoke Pavlovian responses from
us, and her music is full of these

signals that require an automatic,
unthinking response.
Her song "Let X-X/It Tango"
tells of the saciness that these con
ditions bring. The protaganist of
this song receives a postcard, pre
sumably from her lover, who is so
trapped in the cliches and trivi
alities of his life and relationship
that he can't communicate and
wishes to escape from the rela
tionship. However, he can't even
communicate that effectively.
"Dear Amigo Dear Partner,"
he writes, "Listen, uh I just
want to say thanks. So
thanks./ Thanks for all the pres
ents./ Thanks for introducing me
to the Chief./ Thanks for putting
on the feedbag." But Anderson
also feels compassion towards
this struggling lover. In the post
script of his note he realizes his
inadequacy, and to what it has
brought him. "Oh, yeah, P.S./ I
I feel feel like I am in a
burning building and I gotta
go."
The second part of this song,
"It Tango," shows the woman at
tempting to communicate with
the man. She too is reduced to
trivialities and by-the-way ob
servations which skirt the issue,
even though she makes a real at
tempt to overcome this. "It's just
kind of hard to say," she realizes.
For her efforts she receives the re
ply "Isn't it. Isn't it just. Isn't it
just like a woman?" Her lover re
duces her experiences and strug
gles to a hackneyed platitude,
and she realizes that she is talking
to "no one." She questions
whether it is worth her efforts to
communicate with him. "Your
eyes. It's a day's work to look
into them."
All of the people in Anderson's
songs are in some way trapped by
their inadequate vocabulary,

both verbal and social. In
"Sweaters" the woman can only
express her dissatisfaction and
disillusionment with her lover by
commenting how she no longer
loves 'your mouth,.. . your eyes,
.. . your sweaters, .. . the way
you hold your pens and pencils."
People fail to connect because of
these inadequacies. "I wanted
you. And I was looking for you.
But I couldn't find you," says the
character in "Walking and Fall
ing." "I'm not home right now,"
savs the telephone answering ma
chine in "O, Superman."
Anderson also addresses the
peculiar human tendency to leave
to a "higher" authority impor
tant aspects of our own life. In
"O Superman" we are told
" 'Cause when love is gone
there's always justice./ And
when justice is gone, there's
always force./ And when force is
gone, there's always Mom. Hi
Mom!" We find out that "Mom"
is the seeming answer to all our
problems a government in
which we can place all our cares
and problems. We fail to address
our own problems and to attempt
to solve them, all too happy to let
someone else straighten out the
messes we have left behind.
Anderson's album is a master
piece of Americana. Big Science
is American society, with its cute
phrases, automation, and gradu
al erosion of the values of com
munication. Anderson writes
with wit, compassion and an ac
curacy that raises this album to
the category of masterpiece. Her
album is so unique and in
novative that it can perhaps be
best described as the future of
pop music. For this is pop music
at its best witty, incisive, and a
gentle critique of society's con
ventions.

"It Tango," shows the woman at
tempting to communicate with
the man. She too is reduced to
trivialities and by-the-way ob
servations which skirt the issue,
even though she makes a real at
tempt to overcome this. "It's just
kind of hard to say," she realizes.
For her efforts she receives the re
ply "Isn't it. Isn't it just. Isn't it
just like a woman?" Her lover re
duces her experiences and strug
gles to a hackneyed platitude,
and she realizes that she is talking
to "no one." She questions
whether it is worth her efforts to
communicate with him. "Your
eyes. It's a day's work to look
into them."
All of the people in Anderson's
songs are in some way trapped by
their inadequate vocabulary,

both verbal and social. In
"Sweaters" the woman can only
express her dissatisfaction and
disillusionment with her lover by
commenting how she no longer
loves 'your mouth,.. . your eyes,
.. . your sweaters, .. . the way
you hold your pens and pencils."
People fail to connect because of
these inadequacies. "I wanted
you. And I was looking for you.
But I couldn't find you," says the
character in "Walking and Fall
ing." "I'm not home right now,"
savs the telephone answering ma
chine in "O, Superman."
Anderson also addresses the
peculiar human tendency to leave
to a "higher" authority impor
tant aspects of our own life. In
"O Superman" we are told
" 'Cause when love is gone
there's always justice./ And
when justice is gone, there's
always force./ And when force is
gone, there's always Mom. Hi
Mom!" We find out that "Mom"
is the seeming answer to all our
problems a government in
which we can place all our cares
and problems. We fail to address
our own problems and to attempt
to solve them, all too happy to let
someone else straighten out the
messes we have left behind.
Anderson's album is a master
piece of Americana. Big Science
is American society, with its cute
phrases, automation, and gradu
al erosion of the values of com
munication. Anderson writes
with wit, compassion and an ac
curacy that raises this album to
the category of masterpiece. Her
album is so unique and in
novative that it can perhaps be
best described as the future of
pop music. For this is pop music
at its best witty, incisive, and a
gentle critique of society's con
ventions.


Big Science
Warner Brothers

One of the best new pop music
artists isn't from the Los Angeles
club scene, nor the New York
club scene, nor any city's club
scene. All the usual rock and pop
conventions simply don't apply
when one is speaking of Laurie
Anderson, who received her start
with an M.F.A. degree in
sculpture from Columbia Uni
versity, and has had several
works of sculpture exhibited at
New York's Museum of Modern
Art. What's surprising is that

even with these impressive
credentials, Anderson is delving
into pop music, and with the re
lease of her first album for
Warner Brothers, Big Science,
one can only be glad she did. Big
Science is one of the most in
novative, provocative and im
portant albums of the year. An
derson's wit and intelligence pro
vide us with a chillingly accurate
portrait of our society and its pe
culiarities, and ranks with X's
Under The Big Black Sun as one

of the best albums of the year.
Anderson's songs aren't songs
in the usual sense of the word;
they're more like scenes, spoken
phrases that are immediately fa
miliar, backed by a single
rhythmic chord or note that
keeps repeating itself. "Please ex
tinguish all cigarettes./ Place
your trays in their upright,
locked position," we hear in
"From the Air." "Hi, I'm not
home right now. But if you want
to leave a message, just start talk
ing at the sound of the tone," she
sings in "O Superman." These
phrases evoke images of a society

in which the inhabitants have
various ways and sayings which
keep them from communicating
freely, face to face. One of the
most apparent examples is, not
ironically, at the beginning of
"Example No. 22." In it a tele
phone rings so clearly and dis
tinctly that the first few times I
heard it, I got up to answer my
own telephone. Anderson knows
that these sounds and phrases
evoke Pavlovian responses from
us, and her music is full of these

signals that require an automatic,
unthinking response.
Her song "Let X-X/It Tango"
tells of the saciness that these con
ditions bring. The protaganist of
this song receives a postcard, pre
sumably from her lover, who is so
trapped in the cliches and trivi
alities of his life and relationship
that he can't communicate and
wishes to escape from the rela
tionship. However, he can't even
communicate that effectively.
"Dear Amigo Dear Partner,"
he writes, "Listen, uh I just
want to say thanks. So
thanks./ Thanks for all the pres
ents./ Thanks for introducing me
to the Chief./ Thanks for putting
on the feedbag." But Anderson
also feels compassion towards
this struggling lover. In the post
script of his note he realizes his
inadequacy, and to what it has
brought him. "Oh, yeah, P.S./ I
I feel feel like I am in a
burning building and I gotta
go."
The second part of this song,
"It Tango," shows the woman at
tempting to communicate with
the man. She too is reduced to
trivialities and by-the-way ob
servations which skirt the issue,
even though she makes a real at
tempt to overcome this. "It's just
kind of hard to say," she realizes.
