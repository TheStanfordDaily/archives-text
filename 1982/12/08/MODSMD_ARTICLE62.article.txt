### MIKE HALE 
: George Bernard Shaw's Arms
Qnd the Man is subtitled "Ari
finti-Romantic Comedy." Many
professional actors aren't
lapable of the ironic-comic pos
ture Shaw's plays demand, which
Shakes Christine Roum's and
Graham Winton's performances
In last week's Drama Depart
ment production of Arms and the
I lan all the more surprising.
Whenever either one was onstage
ie otherwise rather erratic pro
uction began to breathe and
ike on a life it lacked in their
bsence.
Arms and the Man satirizes cer
ain "romantic" notions: 19th
entury ideals of heroism, the
rivileges and functions of an
ristocratic elite and the cultural
spirations of those aristocrats.
.44 is set in Bulgaria in 1885, where
! the Bulgarians, backed by their
betters, are at war with

the Serbs. As the Serbs scatter in
defeat after a climactic battle,
Captain Bluntschli, a Swiss
mercernary in the Serbian army,
breaks into the bedroom of
Raina Petkoff, daughter of the
Bulgarian commander and
fiancee of Sergius, the "heroic"
Bulgarian officer who led a va
inglorius cavalry charge against
the Serbs (it succeeded only be
cause the Serbs had no bullets for
their machine guns). Raina saves
Bluntschli's life, and three acts
later she is betrothed to the sen
sible Swiss freeman while Sergius
prepares to marry the Petkoffs
maid.
The sat i re i n Arms and the Man
revolves around Sergius, the
loudly heroic, quick-to-take-cf
fense cavalry officer. Shaw has
given him moments of self-re
alization that indicate a second
side to his character: he questions
his romantic ideals at the same

time as they bind him. For the
play's message to come across,
both sides of Sergius have to
come out on stage. Unfortunate
ly, Scott Leland's Sergius never
broke through the bluster and ro
mantic poses to the contradic
tions beneath. Leland's per
formance, while competent, was
completely one-dimensional it
exhausted itself after five
minutes.
Sergius' problems may have
been as much, or more, the fault
of director Stephen Weeks as
they were Leland's. The produc
tion as a whole exhibited a con
centration on surface texture and
a corresponding negligence of, or
perhaps confusion regarding, the
play's ideas. Nothing much was
done to emphasize one of the
play's major themes, the absurdi
ty of the Bulgarian family's pre
tensions to European culture
(beyond some business involving

drying clothes, already in the
script). The Petkoffs library is a
recurring joke in the second act
and is then the scene of the third,
but nothing was done here to ex
ploit the library's symbolic
potential the characters
seemed completely oblivious to
their surroundings, as if the ac
tion were taking place in a cave.
Other aspects of the production
the heavy-handed choreo
graphing of some of the stage
movements, the strange, rather
forced tone many scenes took on
when there weren't any jokes in
sight demonstrated the urge
on someone's part to turn the
play into just another loud and
frantic social comedy, ignoring
the ironic implications of the ac
tion.
Lucky it is, then, that most of
the stage time is devoted to the
simpler characters Raina and
Bluntschli. Christine Roum gave

a marvelously adroit per
formance as Raina. Roum has an
uncanny ability to portray inno
cents on stage in this per
formance. and as Shelly in
Michael Weller's Moonchildren
last spring, she has managed to
embody a certain sort of realistic
innocence without going over the
edge into ethereality or parody.
Roum had no trouble moving
into the more aware character
Raina has become by play's.end,
although it should be noted that
Raina's moments of introspec
tion come much later, and on a
much smaller scale, than
Sergius'.
Winton's Bluntschli was the
glue holding this production to
gether. Bluntschli as written is a
frustratingly ordinary, not very
complex Swiss bourgeois. (Most
of Shaw's anti-heroic, "modern"
heroes are like this they come
off as mystery men simply be

cause Shaw, not wanting us to see
how boring they really are, gives
us information about them in
dribs and drabs.) Winton used
perfect timing and a real flair for
physical comedy to make
Bluntschli the attractive charac
ter Shaw obviously intended him
to be, then underplayed so well
that everyone else on stage
looked better than they deserved
to.
Among the rest of the cast,
Martin Robinson stood out for
his hilarious, highly polished
portrayal of the pompous Major
Petkoff. Even here, though, there
were problems: Robinson occa
sionally showed the strain of
being forced to hold the same
loud note throughout.
Scenic designer Laurence
Maslon seems to have been an
other victim of limited, or mixed,
ambitions. The production's
three sets all achieved a pale.

threadbare realism that did no
more than circumscribe the ac
tion. It could be argued that this
is how a rich family in Shaw's
Bulgaria would live; it seems
more likely, though, that the
Petkoffs visions of the good life
would be a great deal gaudier
than this. Behind all three sets
hung a strange, distracting back
drop painted with slightly ex
pressionistic mountains that
could easily have been dispensed
with.
Despite its flaws. Weeks' pro
duction was consistently en
joyable, and the show's overall
feeling was a quite good-natured

pretension on the part of all in

Bluntschli's life, and three acts
later she is betrothed to the sen
sible Swiss freeman while Sergius
prepares to marry the Petkoffs
maid.
The sat i re i n Arms and the Man
revolves around Sergius, the
loudly heroic, quick-to-take-cf
fense cavalry officer. Shaw has
given him moments of self-re
alization that indicate a second
side to his character: he questions
his romantic ideals at the same

time as they bind him. For the
play's message to come across,
both sides of Sergius have to
come out on stage. Unfortunate
ly, Scott Leland's Sergius never
broke through the bluster and ro
mantic poses to the contradic
tions beneath. Leland's per
formance, while competent, was
completely one-dimensional it
exhausted itself after five
minutes.
Sergius' problems may have
been as much, or more, the fault
of director Stephen Weeks as
they were Leland's. The produc
tion as a whole exhibited a con
centration on surface texture and
a corresponding negligence of, or
perhaps confusion regarding, the
play's ideas. Nothing much was
done to emphasize one of the
play's major themes, the absurdi
ty of the Bulgarian family's pre
tensions to European culture
(beyond some business involving

drying clothes, already in the
script). The Petkoffs library is a
recurring joke in the second act
and is then the scene of the third,
but nothing was done here to ex
ploit the library's symbolic
potential the characters
seemed completely oblivious to
their surroundings, as if the ac
tion were taking place in a cave.
Other aspects of the production
the heavy-handed choreo
graphing of some of the stage
movements, the strange, rather
forced tone many scenes took on
when there weren't any jokes in
sight demonstrated the urge
on someone's part to turn the
play into just another loud and
frantic social comedy, ignoring
the ironic implications of the ac
tion.
Lucky it is, then, that most of
the stage time is devoted to the
simpler characters Raina and
Bluntschli. Christine Roum gave

a marvelously adroit per
formance as Raina. Roum has an
uncanny ability to portray inno
cents on stage in this per
formance. and as Shelly in
Michael Weller's Moonchildren
last spring, she has managed to
embody a certain sort of realistic
innocence without going over the
edge into ethereality or parody.
Roum had no trouble moving
into the more aware character
Raina has become by play's.end,
although it should be noted that
Raina's moments of introspec
tion come much later, and on a
much smaller scale, than
Sergius'.
Winton's Bluntschli was the
glue holding this production to
gether. Bluntschli as written is a
frustratingly ordinary, not very
complex Swiss bourgeois. (Most
of Shaw's anti-heroic, "modern"
heroes are like this they come

perfect timing and a real flair for
physical comedy to make
Bluntschli the attractive charac
ter Shaw obviously intended him
to be, then underplayed so well
that everyone else on stage
looked better than they deserved
to.
Among the rest of the cast,
Martin Robinson stood out for
his hilarious, highly polished
portrayal of the pompous Major
Petkoff. Even here, though, there
were problems: Robinson occa
sionally showed the strain of
