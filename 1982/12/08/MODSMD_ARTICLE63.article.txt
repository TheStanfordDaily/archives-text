# Gould's Goldberg Variations: the art of counterpoint

### LEE COSART Glenn Gould 
J. S. Bach: Goldberg Variations
CBS Records

The music world was
stunned when one of the Finest
pianists of this century, Glenn
Gould, died last month at the
age of 50. Of the wide range of
the literature Gould recorded,
his most brilliant interpreta
tions were of the keyboard
works of Johann Sebastian
Bach; he brought to Bach a
clarity and excitement not at
tained by other pianists. Just
months before he died, Gould
recorded Bach's Goldberg
Variations for CBS records
his last recording. Interesting
ly, his first recording for CBS

records (then Columbia rec
ords) was also the Goldberg
Variations, recorded in 1955
when Gould was 22 years old.
The 1955 recording of the
Goldberg Variations brought
Gould immediate popular
and critical acclaim. A Time
magazine reviewer was
prompted to write: "His
Goldberg Variations are Bach
as the old master himself must
have played with delight in
speedling like the wind and
jov in squeezing beauty out of
every phrase." In the 1982 rec
ording, Gould reduces the
tempo but gives more careful
attention to the ingeniously
interweaving counterpoint.

Bach composed the
Goldberg Variations, one of
his last keyboard works, in
1742. Written for his pupil
Johann Theophilus Goldberg
to plav for his patron, the
Goldberg Variations pro
vided Bach with the largest
commission the composer
ever received. The theme on
which the Variations is based
was written many years pre
viously for Bach's second
wife, Anna Magdalena. The
diversity and richness of the
30 variations of this simple
theme reflect the vast and
creative genius of Bach. Ap
propriately, the recording ca
reer of that master of Bach,
Gould, began and ended with
this brilliant composition.
Why did Gould re-record
the Golberg Variations, his
recording debut that moved
one critic to write: "Few pian
ists plav the instrument so
beautifully, so lovingly"?
Gould explained that new
technology plus his own de
sire to re-examine the work in
terms of its "arithmetic cor
respondence between theme
and variation" led him back
into the studio. The most con
spicuous result of Gould's re
examination is the differing
choice of tempos between the
recordings. With few excep

tions, the 30 Goldberg Vari
ations on the earlier rec
ordings are played more
rapidly than one the more re
cent recordings; the duration
of the First Goldberg Vari
ations is about 37 minutes
while the more recent is
stretched out to 51 minutes. In
addition, Gould pays particu
lar attention to giving each
melody its own character.
Consequently, the contrapun
tal lines are more distinct in
the 1982 recording. Even the
listener already familiar with
the Goldberg Variations
makes new discoveries.
While the two recordings of
the Goldberg Variations dif
fer in certain respects, their
similarity lies in the
iconoclastic Gould style. As
he did in all of his Bach rec
ordings, Gould emphasized
the linear (melodic) structure
of the music as opposed to the
vertical (chordal) structure.
Gould developed his individ
ualistic style while going into
almost complete isolation at
his parents' cottage at the age
of 20 with only a piano and a
tape recorder. His purpose, he
explained, "was to rethink the
way in which the piano ought
to be played." There he de
veloped his low performance
posture his head inches

above the keyboard which
as he explained enabled him
to treat music in a linear fash
ion, rather than as a series of
vertically struck tones strung
together. In so doing, he re
jected the melting legato fa
vored by most pianists and
chose instead singing lines in
which every note is clearly
articulated. The result is a ren
dering of the complex music
of Bach that perfectly bal
ances the relationship be
tween the lines with the inde

pendence of the lines; all of
the melodies are performed
on the same instrument by the
same performer yet each has a
striking independence. In the
art of counterpoint, Gould
was without peer.
An important influence on
his recordings was Gould's
philosophy which held that
"the concert is dead" and that
recording represented the mu
sical future. Retiring from the
concert stage in 1964, he said
he considered the concert

form an "immensely dis
tasteful" musical compromise
that leads to "tremendous
conservatism" in musical in
terpretation. He asserted that
for music to retain its force
and integrity, it is best played
and heard in solitude. Choos
ing the recording studio over
the concert stage, Gould left
us an assemblage of definitive
Bach recordings, beginning
and ending with what may be
his summit, the Goldberg
Variations.
