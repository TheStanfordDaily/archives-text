# MIGHTIER THAN THE PEN.

### 
This is a typewriter, a writing machine
consisting of a keyboard controlling the
selection of characters for sequential
impression onto a flat surface. The typist is in
command of 55 keys, arranged on a console in
a special order known only by other typists. The
keys are linked by steel rods to 46 metal plates
that are hurled onto the writing surface at great
force. Over 100 individual printing options are
available with this device; as many as 1000
collisions between steel and paper in a single
minute have been recorded.
There is tremendous power in this machine.
And tremendous responsibility.
Both can be yours. By writing forTHE
STANFORD DAILY.
If you think you're up to the challenge, call
497-4632. Or visit the Storke Student
Publications Building (across from Terman)
and ask for Richard, Doug or Karen. They'll
know why you're there.
