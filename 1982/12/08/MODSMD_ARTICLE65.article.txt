"Think as I think or be

David Wark Griffith

Highly recommended

The Magic Flute (1975) ★
Fox, Redwood City
Sometimes Ingmar Bergman's
movie of Mozart's last opera
evokes Dickens, sometimes
Shakespeare; sometimes it
parodies operetta conventions,
like Peter Brook's Beggar's Op
era. The Three Spirits are Christ
mas choirboy children who de
scend in a balloon and pelt
Papageno (Hakan Hagegard,
dressed in green, with a pageboy
haircut, so that he looks like one
of Robin Hood's men) with snow
balls to avert him from suicide.
When Tamino (Josef Kostlinger)
plavs his flute, he attracts an au
dience of charmingly stylized
creatures a wide-eyed bear, a
mournful lion, a walrus lying on
his back, a trio of possums hang
ing upside down from the flies.
Birgit Mordin plays that im
perious manipulator, the Queen
of the Night, and Ulrik Cold is a
truly humanistic Sarastro.
Bergman gets amazingly natural
performances from his cast, and
the movie, set in the Drottn
ingholm Court Theatre in Stock
holm, has so much heart that
coming after his dreary psy
chodrama Scenes from a Mar
riage it was practically a re
birth. (It is also, by the way, one
of the few great children's mov
ies.) Sven Nvkvist shot it in 16mm
for Swedish television and it was
blown up to 35mm for theatrical
release, but when you see the
quality of the photography you
won't believe it.
Plavs next Thursday only with
Wild Strawberries.
Smiles of a Summer Night
(1955) ★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Ingmar Bergman has never
made a better picture than this
complex sexual farce, which sug
gests a Viennese operetta as
Shakespeare might have written
it. The players are a middle-aged
lawyer (Gunnar Bjornstrand); his
wife (Ulla Jacobsson), still a vir
gin; his one-time mistress, an ac
tress (Eva Dahlbeck); her ego
centric lover (Karl Julie); his
proud, melancholy wife (Margit
Carlquist); the carnal, ebullient
maid (Harriet Andersson) and,
in the background, the actress' ag
ing mother (Naima Wifstrand).
This movie inspired the
marvellous Stephen Sondheim
musical A Little Night Music, but
there's nothing like the original.
Plays next Thursday only with
The Magician.

Through a Glass Darkly (1961)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Ingmar Bergman tackles the
themes of the artist in isolation
and the existence of God in this
movie, which is so austere and
self-serious that critics have been
mistaking its banalities for pro
fundities for two decades. (It's not
even original: quite a few of the
ideas and even details of character
derive from Chekhov's The Sea
Gull.) Bergman is a great artist,
but he can be infuriating: when
Harriet Andersson, as the mad
heroine, Karin, tells her family
(Gunnar Bjornstrand, Max Von
Svdow and Lars Passgard) that
God appeared to her out of the
wallpaper in the form of a spider,
you may want to scream or gig
gle. The picture is extremely well
acted, of course, and beautifully
shot bv Sven Nykvist.
Plays tomorrow only with The
Virgin Spring.

Modern Times (1936) ★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
By 1936, no Hollywood studio
had made a silent picture in eight
years, but Charles Chaplin had
still not released a talkie when he
wrote, directed and starred in this
proletarian comedy, though he
did add a musical soundtrack,
composed by Chaplin, of course,
and featuring the sentimental
popular ballad "Smile (Though
Your Heart Is Breaking)." (His
first talkie. The Great Dictator,
didn't come out until 1940.) This
obstinacy may seem perverse
until you see the movie. Chaplin
was clearly inspired by Rene
Clair's 1931 A Nous la Liberie

The Man Who Fell to Earth
(1976)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Paul Maverling's screenplay,
derived from Walter Tevis' novel,
inverts the old story of the visit of
the alien who alters the lives of the
human beings he encounters:
Tommy Newton (David Bowie,
whose androgynous purity his
vulnerability somehow gives
him an erotic charge here) leaves
his wife and children behind on
their home planet, which is suffer
ing from a murderous drought,
flies to earth in an effort to secure
water, and ends up corrupted and
finally destroyed by earth men.
This is material for an ironiccom
edv, but the director, Nicolas
Roeg, treats it without humor.
However, the dissociated world
he and his photographer, An
thony Richmond, create of weird,
vast landscapes and magnificent,
scary skyscrapers is different
from anything else you've seen in
a movie. Emotionally distanced
as it is, the film is seductive, and
there is one great scene in which
Newton sells his ring to a desic
cated old lady in a wondrous, glit
tering second-hand shop where
an ancient recording of Louis
Armstrong singing "Blueberry
Hill" is being played. With Candy
Clark, Buck Henry and Rip Torn.
Plays next Tuesday and
Wednesday, in the uncut version,
with The Last Wave.

(particularly in the factory se
quence). Paulette Goddard, one
of his few decent leading ladies
and one of his several wives, plays
the Gamine, and the fair-sized
supporting cast includes Chester
Conklin and Henry Bergman.
Plays Monday only with City
Lights and The Gold Rush.

To Have and Have Not (1944)
Festival, Palo Alto ★
Warner Brothers bought the ti
tle of an Ernest Hemingway nov
ella, but the crackling Jules
F'urthman-William Faulkner
script has virtually nothing to do
with the book. In this first of four
movies Humphrey Bogart and
Lauren Bacall made together, she
teaches him how to whistle and
seems far too sexy to turn into the
dried-up, strident trouper she
would become after his death.
-They plav together marvellously
in this immensely enjoyable ro
mantic adventure melodrama, su
perbly crafted by Howard Hawks
and co-starring Walter Brennan,
Hoagv Carmichael, Sheldon
Leonard, Dolores Moran, Dan
Seymour and even Marcel Dalio
(of Renoir's Grand Illusion and
Rules of the Game).
Plavs through next Wednesday
with Casablanca.
Editor's note: this double-bill
will not be the Festival Cinema's
last. The Festival, which has been
showing old, mostly good movies in
its tiny space on Hamilton Avenue
for as long as we can remember,
had announced earlier this year
that its projector would go off for
good Dec. 16; new management
has taken over, however, and the
Festival will live on into the new
year.

Demon Pond (1980) ★
Bijou, Palo Alto
Masahiro Shinoda made this
beautiful, offbeat movie with
Japan's leading Kabuki actor,
Tamasbuto Bando, in the two
pivotal (female) roles. The film is
double-layered: the main plot
concerns a young schoolteacher
whose search for his best friend
leads him to the home of a young
woman whose love holds the lost
friend captive, and the secondary
plot is the legend of Demon Pond,
which runs bv the woman's home
in the hills. Shinoda didn't work

Intolerance (1916) ★
Fox, Redwood City
When the NAACP picketed
screenings of The Birth of a Na
tion and D.W. Griffith was ac
cused of racism, he sank all his
money (and Birth of a Nation had
earned him a bundle) into this
plea for universal tolerance in an
attempt to clear himself of the
charge. But the movie was made
with more than a moral convic
tion: split into four intercutting
narratives, it was a daring experi
ment that expanded the vocab
ulary of film, though it proved to
be too much for contemporary
audiences to handle and bombed
at the box office. The modern
story, with Mae Marsh and Rob
ert Harron, and the Babylon
episode, with Constance
Talmadge and Elmo Lincoln, are
the most successful (because they
are the most fully developed).
Bessie Love stars in the Biblical
storv and Margery Wilson in the
Huguenots' tale, both of which
have probably been truncated in
the years since the picture's ori
ginal release; Lillian Gish tends
the "endlessly rocking" cradle in
the connective sequence. (The
quotation is from Walt Whitman,
Griffith's hero.) Griffith is still
the greatest director in the history
of movies.
Plays today only.

Images of "Intolerance"

Scenes from D.W. Griffith's Intolerance (clockwise from top): Christ saves the wom
an taken in adultery, from the Biblical sequence; in the modern sequence, the Governor's
pardon saves the Boy from hanging; Lillian Gish as The One Who (endlessly) Rocks the
Cradle, in the connecting scenes; and the mile-long set for Belshazzar's Banquet Hall in
the Babylonia sequence, built along Sunset Boulevard and eventually demolished despite
a movement to preserve it as a monument to the early days of Hollywood.

out a successful technique for
merging the styles of the two
stories, but the power of his im
agery fires across the narrative
and characterological confusion,
even if Bando's peculiar styliza
tion and the weird, highly charged
material take some getting used
to. (When you do get used to him,
Bando is extraordinary.) One
might best describe Demon Pond
as a Hans Christian Andersen tale
told by a Japanese artist who is a
combination of Gustave Dore
and Salvador Dali.

My Fair Lady (1964)
Memorial Auditorium
During the credits, the screen
fills with flowers, so carefully ar
ranged and unimaginatively
photographed that they already
look dead; thus we are quickly
clued into George Cukor's three
hour film, more a pressing of the
great Lerner-Loewe musical than
anything else, with every line and
every song preserved rather than
performed. Almost nothing, from
the Cecil Beaton sets and cos
tumes to the Hermes Pan choreo
graphy, seems fresh, and Rex
Harrison's Professor Henry Hig
gins seems to be suffering from
iron-poor blood. (For a hint of
what a vivid Higgins must be like,
listen to lan Richardson on the
20th-anniversary revival rec
ording.) Stanley Holloway has
some lively moments as Alfred
Dolittle, but ironically, Audrey
Hepburn who received severe
criticism from purists for "steal
ing" the role of Eliza away from
Julie Andrews is far and away
the best thing in the picture,
though her Cockney accent in the
first half is unconvincing. (When
she appears at the Embassy Ball
in Beaton's prize creation, a shim
mering white gown, the movie
soars for a brief moment.)
Plays Sunday evening.
