# Dead Week policies generate talk, worries

### LISA LYNCH Staff writer 
Ihe ASSU Council of Presidents re
ported violations of Dead Week policy
in a meeting yesterday afternoon with
Dean of Students Jim Lyons, according
to COP member Mark Epstein. At the
meeting, Epstein reported that seven
classes had final exams scheduled this
week instead of during finals week.
Epstein said one of the courses that
scheduled a final during Dead Week,
was Biology 110, taught by Dean of Hu
manities and Sciences Norman
Wessells. Epstein said Wessells is "one
of the people who should be informing
professors" about the policy.
According to COP members, other
classes that scheduled finals during
Dead Week include Economics 1,
taught bv professor Victor Fuchs, Engi
neering Economic Systems 221, taught
by professor Ronald Howard, Political
Science 113A taught by professor Rob
ert Packenham and an undergraduate

special course on the stock market.
According to Epstein, the COP is
compiling a list of classes with Dead
Week violations, and is encouraging
students to contact them at the ASSU.
He said the list would be sent to the pro
fessors who violate the code, the Dean
of the professor's school and the Prov
ost's Office.
The violations were discovered
through conversations with students on
campus, according to Epstein. "At this
point all we have the power to do is to
document the failure of professors to
understand," he said.
Lyons said, "Some faculty may sim
ply not know about the Dead Week pol
icy."
He explained that though the exams
were technically illegal, they probably
would not be rescheduled this year.
Epstein agreed that the violations
came about through ignorance of the
Dead Week policy. "It's a failure of the
professors and their immediate superi

ors,"he said.
According to a Dead Week Policy
Statement adopted by the Academic
Council in 1978, Dead Week is "a peri
od of reduced social and extracurricular
activity." Graded homework assign
ments and quizzes are discouraged, un
less those assignments are part of the
routine learning process. Student
groups and athletic teams are dis
couraged from meeting and practicing
and the Daily comes out only once.
According to the bulletin, classes
may still be regularly scheduled, but in
structors are strongly discouraged from
scheduling final exams during Dead
Week, except in courses worth less than
three units of credit.-
At other schools, the pre-exam peri
od is treated in several different ways.
Among quarter-system schools, such as
the California Institution of Technolo
gy, UC-Berkeley, USC and UCLA, the
most popular practice is to give the stu
dents no specific time to prepare for ex

ams.
"Our classes end on a Friday, and
our exams begin that Saturday," said
Lyman Bonner, registrar at Cal Tech.
"There aren't any restrictions placed on
the week before exams; it's never really
been a student concern."
At UCLA and Cal, students had the
weekend before exams to prepare. "It
(the week before finals) was just like any
other week," said a Cal freshman. "But
classes here are always optional, so you
don't really feel pressure to go to classes
instead of study."
Schools on the semester system often
have "reading periods," of about 12-14
days before exams, during which no
classes are held or work assigned. At
Harvard, students have a 13-day read
ing period just after Christmas break.
"The students are required to be on
campus preparing for exams," said
Carol Bundv, of the Harvard Office of
Undergraduate Records. "Most ex-
tracurricular activities cease, but the
student newspaper is published."
At Princeton, students have 10 days
without classes, but they have a full
schedule of extracurricular activities,
and long-term papers can be due during
the reading period.
There are some schools which have a
semester system and yet only allow a
day for students to prepare. Columbia
and USC have mid-week stop days
without classes. Exams begin the next

day.
Here Dead Week falls between the
two extremes; students are given some
chance to prepare for exams, but still
must attend all classes except those de
clared optional.
University Provost A1 Hastorf ex
pressed dissatisfaction with the system
here. "It just plain isn't a reading peri
od; it clearly must have been some at
tempt to relate to exams, but it isn't
anything like what they have in the
East."
Hastorf called Dead Week "a
mongrel at best because it isn't really
dead and students are still pressured."
