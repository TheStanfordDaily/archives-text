is stressed, for the role of the
United States in Latin America.
Reagan repeatedly told the
Latin leaders, however, he was
not there to make demands or
bargains, but merely to listen and
ask how the U.S. could help, The
working trip was mainly to gen
erate a friendly forum for dis
cussion.
In a region where the less de
veloped countries are determined
to maintain views independent of
the U.S., yet require some eco
nomic support, Reagan's tour
represented a test of the Adminis
tration's capacity to understand
and cope with the region's com
plexity.
The first stop was Brazil, the
largest and wealthiest country in
Latin America. U.S. criticism of
its human rights repression had
made dialogue tense between the
two nations. With the freeing of
political prisoners and the first
free elections in 17 years last
months, however, this most re
cent visit was congenial.
Far from any grand pronoun
cements, Reagan nevertheless
announced that the U.S. will loan
Brazil $1.23 billion in a short
term credit to "bridge" its eco
nomic crunch until next year's
IMF funding comes through.
Other agreements with Brazil
included a relaxation of U.S. re
strictions on sugar imports for in-

In his first trip to the potential
ly volatile Third World, Presi
dent Ronald Reagan's Latin
American tour was meant to bear
good will rather than make dra
matic diplomatic breakthroughs.
Despite the mixed responses
from the four nations visited,
Reagan accomplished the sym
bolic reassurance of U.S. support
in that region.
Most of the issues brought up
bv both the U.S. and Latin Amer
ican sides dealt with economic
aid during a time of extreme re
cession. The countries in the re
gion have been hard hit by high
interest rates and the drop in ex
port prices for sugar, coffee and
other commodities. Brazil, for
example, has a debt of nearly $9O
billion in foreign lOUs.
The gist of Reagan's
statements in Latin America cen
tered on the encouragement of
democracy, vigilance, free-trade
and free-market philosophies.
He called for a cooperative effort
to combat protectionism and re
cession, which have in the past
created barriers between the U.S.
and Latin American nations.
Events of the Falklands crisis
had also strained relations, when
most of South America reacted
unhappily to the Adminis
tration's decision to back Britain.
Concern was expressed, and still

dustrial uses and a waiver of the
demand that Brazil end its export
subsidies.
Sidestepping the request for
direct U.S. aid by Brazilian presi
dent Joao Figueiredo, Reagan in
vited Brazil to send a prospective
astronaut to the U.S. to be
trained and later to fly on a space
shuttle mission.
Additionally, the two govern
ments pledged to form five
groups" to discuss eco
nomics, nuclear power, science
and technology, and military re
lations over a period of six
months.
Things did not go so smoothly
in Colombia, however, and Rea
gan's visit was greeted by anti-
American student demonstrators
shouting "Go away, Reagan"
and throwing rocks.
Over luncheon toasts, Reagan
and President Belisario Betancur
traded differences on Central
American insurgencies, aid,
trade and narcotics. On the plane
to Bogota, Reagan and his aides
had revised the text of his
message after receiving word
from Colombia that Betancur's
comments would be highly
critical.
Betancur took office last Au
gust, and has yanked foreign pol
icy away from loyalty to Wash
ington, most notably by propo
sing that Colombia join the Non
aligned Movement, largely a
Third World group.
He berated the U.S. for its de
nial of full access to Colombian
products, its failure to pressure
the IM F to grant aid to countries

like his, and its general reluctance
as an industrialized nation to
help developing countries.
In a calm and
tone, Reagan suggested that it
was the Colombian govern
ment's responsibility to crack
down on the powerful cocaine ex
porters. An estimated 70 percent
of the marijuana and 80 percent
of the cocaine used in the United
States comes from Colombia.
He carefully omitted referring
to Cuba, Nicaragua and the Sovi
et Union, but reminded Betancur
of Colombia's agreement to urge
solidarity by democratic nations
in the region against foreign in
tervention a pledge given at a
conference in Costa Rica in Oc
tober. _jm
On Saturday Reagan flew t?
San Jose, Costa Rica where he
met with President Luis Alberto
Monge. The two signed an ex
tradition treaty and Reagan de
livered a speech to 500 Costa Ri
can officials and business leaders.
From San Jose, Reagan flew to
San Pedro Sula, Honduras buttle
never made it past the airport. He
and President Roberto Suzo Cor
dova spoke together in a con
ference room and walked to a
hangar where the two read from
prepared texts.
Honduras, the site of a U.S.-
backed training ground for anti-
Sandista forces aimed at over
throwing the Nicaraguan SandisU
Government, wants $lOO millioâ„¢
in U.S. aid to retire 75 percent of
the Honduran budget deficit.
Reagan, however, made no pub
lic promises.
