# CIA focus on Latin America
## 
### 
Compiled from news reports and wire services
Programs of economic progress took a back
seat to programs of violence during President
Reagan's recent visit to Honduras where more
than 150 Central Intelligence Agency agents are
stationed.
Although Reagan denied that there has been
an increase in clandestine activity in the region,
there are reports that the United States is behind
a covert effort to topple the leftist government in
neighboring Nicaragua. The activities, which
began a year ago with limited aims, have snow
balled into the most ambitious paramilitary and
political action operation mounted by the CIA
in nearly a decade, according to intelligence of
ficials. In recent years, the CIA had fewer than a
dozen paramilitary and political action special
ists in the region, said intelligence sources.
Neighboring Latin American countries now
host dozens more agents and the CIA has de
voted a large part of its special operations staff
to the Central American effort.
Reports estimate the cost of supporting the ef
fort at $2O million spent on training and military
equipment to paramilitary groups dedicated to
overthrowing the leftist Sandinist government.
Administration officials, however, maintain
that American policy toward Nicaragua has not
changed. Reagan, refusing to substantiate
claims of covert operations, has declared instead
commitment to policies favoring negotiations
with Nicaragua to resolve regional problems.
But the Central American movements have
caused growing concern in Congress, the De
fense Department and the State Department,
where officials fear a successful campaign
against the ruling Sandinista Directorate might
backfire.
The most vocal opponents of the Nicaraguan
regime are former officers of the late dictator
Anastasio Somoza's government. Somoza was
.assassinated in 1979 following the coup, but his
former aides are still known as Somicistas.

Members of the insurgent forces are recruiting
Nicaraguans from the poorest sections of the
northern provinces and armed bands of the
Nicaraguan exiles have moved from camps on
the Honduran side of the border into Nicaragua.
Some of the Somicistas are dedicated com
munists, some are mercenaries and some are ex
iled killers hoping to shoot their way back into
positions of power. Tainted by a past of corrup
tion and killing, the organizations' moves to
spark a popular insurrection have caused a stir
on Capitol Hill.
Concerned that political instability in the re
gion will lead to direct American military in
volvement, members of the Senate Intelligence
Committee and a possible Somicista takeover
have asked to schedule a hearing with top CIA
officials before the end of the month.
At issue are several operations whose target
has been the Nicaraguan government. Original
plans called for financing moderate elements in
Nicaragua and trying to find and support politi
cal leaders who could garner support against the
Sandinists. The plans excluded involving any
former Somoza supporters and did not provide
for any paramilitary operations aimed at toppl
ing the Sandinist government.
On the paramilitary front, the CIA, with Rea
gan's approval, funneled aid through other
Latin American nations to support the for
mation and training of armed units in Hon
duras. The groups call themselves the
Nicaraguan Democratic Front and are an
amalgam of Nicaraguan exile groups organized
in 1980. Their leaders are former officers of
Somoza and have made clear the forces, num
bering 3000 to 5000, are dedicated to overthrow
ing the Sandinist regime.
Meanwhile, U.S. military assistance to Hon
duras, tptalling s3l*3 milliqn in fiscal year 1982,
is being used to indirectly supply
the paramilitary groups.
