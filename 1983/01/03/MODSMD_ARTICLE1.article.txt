# Stanford to host first Bay Area NFL Super Bowl in 1985
## 
### MARK ZEIGLER 
While Stanford students were laboring over final exams
last December, Athletic Director Andy Geiger and two San
Francisco officials were arranging for a final of a different
sort to be held at Stanford: that of the National Football
League (NFL) â€” the Super Bowl.
Planning is already underlay for Super Bowl XIX,
though the game will not be played until Jan. 20, 1985. The
Super Bowl here will mark the first time the game has been
held in the Bay Area and the first time it has been located in a
non-Sun Belt outdoor stadium.
Besides cosmetic changes to Stanford Stadium, the ex
travaganza is expected to bring $80 million to the Bay Area,
according to San Francisco's Convention and Visitors Bu
reau.
"I think the economic infusion it brings to the Bay Area
will be helpful," Geiger said. Stanford's athletic director also
cited the "visibility engendered by hosting a Super Bowl" as
important to the University and its athletic programs.
University President Donald Kennedy said a crucial bene
fit of having the Super Bowl on campus is "continuing the
good relationship the University has with the communities
up and down the Peninsula and with San Francisco." While
the game itself will be played at Stanford, most of the pre

game social events will be in San Francisco.
Although manv of the economic benefits of hosting a Su
per Bowl will be concentrated away from campus, 60-year
old Stanford Stadium will get a much needed face lift from
the deal. "It gives us a chance to accelerate our deferred
maintenance program for the stadium," Geiger said.
Preparing the 84,892 seat stadium, the largest privately
owned college stadium in the United States, for the 1985
event will involve improving the press box, concession
stands, restrooms, directional signs and sound system.
Temporary lighting as well as the construction of com
plete locker rooms inside the stadium also will be necessary
for the N FL championship game. However, Geiger said that
none of the planned renovations would take place until after
the 1983 Stanford football season.
Because San Francisco's Candlestick Park and Oakland's
Coliseum have capacities well under the unwritten NFL Su
per Bowl requirement of 70,000, Stanford Stadium was "the
only place the game could be played in the Bay Area," ac
cording to Geiger. UC Berkeley's Memorial Stadium holds
76,780, but a lack of adequate parking makes it an un
realistic Super Bowl site.
Ouentin Kopp,San Francisco director of the Board of Su
pervisors, and George Kirkland, executive director of the

Lilys Convention and Visitors Bureau, accompanied
(ieiger to Dallas for last month's annual meeting of NFL
owners.
Super Bowl sites for 1985 and 1986 were chosen by elec
tion at the Dec. 14 meeting. Stanford was picked over eight
other proposals, receiving the minimum number of votes
necessarv for approval (21 of 28). Super Bowl XX will be
played in New Orleans' Super Dome, the location of the Su
per Bowl XII in 1978.
Alternate sites that put in bids for Super Bowl XIX in
cluded three Florida cities, Pasadena, Calif., Houston, Seat
tle and Pontiac, Mich., the host of last January's Super
Bowl.
A day after Kopp returned from Dallas with the good
news, he set up a three-man team of top Bay Area fund
raisers to gather the necessary $500,000 for stadium im
provements and additions. While Stanford has offered the
stadium's use rent free, the NFL has agreed to pick up the
other half of the $ I million tab for the preparations.
I he fact that the NFL is willing to invest $500,000 in Stan
ford Stadium indicates the league's interest in including
Stanford in its informal "rotation" of Super Bowl sites, ac
cording to Kopp.
"The league (NFL) is putting up $500,000," Kopp said.

" rhev don't want it to be a one-time expenditure."
Later this month, Super Bowl XVII will be played in
Pasadena's Rose Bowl for the third time since 1977. The
NHL championship game has been waged in Miami's Or
ange Bowl five times.
Cieigersaid he would begin forming committees to oversee
the process of determining the specifics of the stadium im
provements. He did indicate that the in-stadium locker
rooms, an NFL requirement, would replace the "halftime
shacks" at the open end of the stadium.
(ieiger also said the press box improvements will be at the
"broadcast level." Observors have speculated that a fourth
deck will be added to the existing press box to accomodate
the influx of Super Bowl media personnel.
(ieiger noted that the temporary lighting would be
portable and possiblv provided by the same company that lit
Notre Dame's football stadium last fall for a televised game
between Notre Dame and the University of Michigan.
(ieiger stressed the fact that seat backs would not be put
on the wooden benches that presently occupy the stadium,
because they would reduce the capacity. However, Geiger
said that in the future, "it is possible that we may move to
aluminum (bleacher seats)."
