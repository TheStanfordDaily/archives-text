The prospect of continued
peace in the Mideast remains un
certain in 1983 as Israeli and
Palestinian leaders show few
signs of abandoning hard-line
positions that have fueled vears
of Arab-Israeli conflict.
Israeli Prime Minister Men
achem Begin clings resolutely to
his long-standing dream of re
storing Eretz Yisrael, the biblical
land that takes in not only the
present day Jewish state but also
the Israeli-occupied West Bank
of the Jordan River. Likewise Be
gin insists that Jewish troops stay
in Lebanon until Israel's security
is assured.
For the Palestinian Liberation
Organization, Israel's bitter foe,
peace may mean making con
cessions. Said to be in disarray af
ter a crushing defeat in Lebanon,
PLO leaders hint they could ac
cept the existence of a Jewish
state if the future of Palestinians
living under Israeli rule could be
resolved. PLO head Yasser
Arafat's pursuit of more diplo
matic means of establishing an
independent Palestine has met
with opposition. Militant mem
bers want to keep waging a cam
paign of terror against Israel.

Any recognition of the Israeli
state could spur Arab charges of
a sellout.
A big question for the United
States is whether the Reagan ad
ministration can keep Reagan's
September peace initiative alive.
Arab leaders still do not accept
the plan which calls for recogni
tion of the Israeli nation as well
as a Palestinian homeland. But
few reject the plan outright.
The biggest obstacle confront
ing Reagan may be the opposi
tion of Begin.
Though popular at home, Be
gin's rigid stance could prove em
barrassing if an Israeli board of
inquiry finds him or his ministers
at fault in the September
massacre of Palestinian refugees
in Israeli-controlled Beirut. Ori
ginally Begin refused to launch
an official inquiry and instead ac
cused his country's critics abroad
of committing "blood libel." Be
gin later consented to the in
vestigation and said he did not
learn of the Beirut killings until
48 hours later.
Certainly refusal to com
promise on both sides will result
in deepened strains between the
United States, Israel and the
PLO.
