						thaw in U.S.-Soviet relations?

Despite upcoming Geneva talks on intermediate
range nuclear forces, bargaining prospects between
the United States and the Soviet Union over mutual
disarmament look dim.
An effort to warm up future talks became ap
parent during a speech Soviet leader Yuri An
dropov gave before Communist leaders to mark the
60th anniversary of the founding of the Soviet
Union last month. In his address, Andropov in
dicated the Soviet Union would be willing to "re
duce hundreds of missiles" aimed at Western Eu
rope if the NATO alliance reversed its decision to
deploy 572 Pershing II and cruise missiles in five
West European countries starting late next year.
According to Andropov, the Soviets would keep
in Europe "only as many missiles as are kept there
bv Britain and France, and not a single one more."
Although he did not mention figures, arms experts
interpreted the proposal as an offer to dismantle an
estimated 280 SS-4 and SS-5 missiles and reduce the
arsenal of SS-20s in Europe to 162, the number of
ballistic missiles deployed by France and Britain.
The alliance rejected the Andropov offer with
near unanimity, though some members viewed the
speech as a possible signal that Moscow is in

terested in striking a bargain. France and Britain
were irritated by Soviet attempts to include their
nuclear forces in a broader NATO deal while U.S.
State Department spokesman John Hughes said the
proposal would leave the United States without a
way to deter any remaining Soviet missiles targeted
on Western Europe.
Western military analysts pointed out that the
French and British missiles are not the equivalent of
the SS-20, in either accuracy or number of war
heads. Nor did the plan specify whether Moscow in
tended to dismantle and SS-20s or simply move
them out of European Russia.
According to Andropov, the Soviet Union would
cut the number of its intercontinental missile-de
liverv systems by more than 25 percent if the United
States would agree to the same. The Soviet leader
then warned Washington against using the the MX
intercontinental ballistic missile as a bargaining
chip in arms negotiations. Andropov said the Soviet
Union would counter any such challenge by build
ing similar missiles.
The bargaining process faces a stiff challenge, for
while President Reagan fights for the "peace
keeper" MX missile in Congress, Kremlin leader
Andropov continues the buildup of conventional
and nuclear military forces in the Soviet Union.
