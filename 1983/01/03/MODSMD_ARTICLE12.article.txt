## Stanford lures Bowl to Bay Area 
### MARK ZEIGLER 
Although Super Bowl XIX in 1985
will be a first for Stanford Stadium and
the Bay Area, it is not the first time
Stanford has been considered as a host
for the January event.
Stanford was selected as the site for
the National Football League's (NFL)
championship game by the league's 28
franchise owners last month in Dallas.
The Bay Area, which has never hosted
the event, was chosen over eight other
cities that put in bids for Super Bowl
XIX.
One problem in luring the Super
Bowl to the Bay Area has been finding a
suitable stadium. The NFL has an un
written Super Bowl requirement of
70,000, ruling out San Francisco's
Candlestick Park and Oakland's Col
iseum. And lack of adequate parking
nixes UC Berkeley's Memorial Stadi
um, even though it holds 76,780.
That leaves Stanford Stadium, with a
capacity of 84,892 and plenty of park
ing. But with those amenities come a
private institution with "policies" re
stricting the use of its athletic facilities
bv outside groups.
"It (Stanford) was explored at one
time," said Jim Heffernan, the NFL's
director of public relations. "The
league did do some preliminary in
vestigations at Stanford," he con
tinued, although he could not recall
when.
Quentin Kopp, director of San Fran
cisco's Board of Supervisors and an in
strumental force in luring Super Bowl

XIX to Stanford, said he has heard
rumors confirming Heffernan's
statement.
According to Kopp, the rumors
claimed NFL Commissioner Pete
Rozelle originally wanted to have Super
Bowl 111 here in 1969, but that Stanford
officials wouldn't allow it.
Kopp said he first became involved in
efforts to bring the Super Bowl to the
Bay Area three years ago.
"One day on a weekend I got a call
from a San Francisco Examiner re
porter who said, 'Why hasn't San Fran
cisco ever had a Super Bowl?' " Kopp
remembered. "I said, 'I don't know'
and that started it."
After talking to NFL officials, Kopp
said he called Stanford Athletic Direc
tor Andv Cieiger to check on the use of
the Stanford Stadium for a Super Bowl.
"I think we talked originally about
three years ago," Geiger said, "and it
(hosting a Super Bowl) wasn't possible
then."
But, according to Geiger, the San
Francisco 49ers' victorious trip to Su
per Bowl XVI last year in Pontiac,
Mich., "rekindled" Bay Area Super
Bowl chatter.
After returning from Pontiac, Kopp
tried again. "I called Geiger back and,
after a few days, he called back and
said, 'It's a go.' "
Kopp surmised that Stanford's yes
answer the second time around was the
result of a shift in policy brought about
after Donald Kennedy replaced Rich
ard Lyman as University president.

"And with a new president came a
new policy," Kopp proclaimed.
Not so, Geiger told the Daily last
week. "I don't think it was a change in
policy necessarily," Geiger said. "I
think that the University looks at things
on an issue-bv-issue arrangement."
Kennedy echoed Geiger's statement,
but with a different twist. "I think that
you look at each thing as it comes
along," he said. "There certainly was
not a fixed University policy."
However, Kennedy noted that the
University has been reluctant to lend its
facilities for outside use. "In that sense,
you have a policy."
Once Kopp got the go-ahead from
Stanford, he formed a nine-man com
mittee to begin preparing the city's pro
posal to the NFL owners.
The city's Convention and Visitors
Bureau published a booklet, entitled
"Super Bowl by the Bay," outlining the
Bay Area's proposal.
During the NFL players strike,
which delayed last month's owners
meeting in Dallas, Kopp and San Fran
cisco Mayor Diane Feinstein con
ducted a lobbying campaign over the
phone.
At the meeting itself, postcards with
pictures of the city and complimentary
bottles of wine were given to the owners
of the 28 N FL franchises in an effort to
swav their vote.
All in all, Kopp felt the lobbying
proved successful. "I think it was effec
tive," he said. "Everybody I talked to
was congenial."

That leaves Stanford Stadium, with a
capacity of 84,892 and plenty of park
ing. But with those amenities come a
private institution with "policies" re
stricting the use of its athletic facilities
bv outside groups.
"It (Stanford) was explored at one
time," said Jim Heffernan, the NFL's
director of public relations. "The
league did do some preliminary in
vestigations at Stanford," he con
tinued, although he could not recall
when.
Quentin Kopp, director of San Fran
cisco's Board of Supervisors and an in
strumental force in luring Super Bowl

XIX to Stanford, said he has heard
rumors confirming Heffernan's
statement.
According to Kopp, the rumors
claimed NFL Commissioner Pete
Rozelle originally wanted to have Super
Bowl 111 here in 1969, but that Stanford
officials wouldn't allow it.
Kopp said he first became involved in
efforts to bring the Super Bowl to the
Bay Area three years ago.
"One day on a weekend I got a call
from a San Francisco Examiner re
porter who said, 'Why hasn't San Fran
cisco ever had a Super Bowl?' " Kopp
remembered. "I said, 'I don't know'
and that started it."
After talking to NFL officials, Kopp
said he called Stanford Athletic Direc
tor Andv Cieiger to check on the use of
the Stanford Stadium for a Super Bowl.
"I think we talked originally about
three years ago," Geiger said, "and it
(hosting a Super Bowl) wasn't possible
then."
But, according to Geiger, the San
Francisco 49ers' victorious trip to Su
per Bowl XVI last year in Pontiac,
Mich., "rekindled" Bay Area Super
Bowl chatter.
After returning from Pontiac, Kopp
tried again. "I called Geiger back and,
after a few days, he called back and
said, 'It's a go.' "
Kopp surmised that Stanford's yes
answer the second time around was the
result of a shift in policy brought about
after Donald Kennedy replaced Rich
ard Lyman as University president.

"And with a new president came a
new policy," Kopp proclaimed.
Not so, Geiger told the Daily last
week. "I don't think it was a change in
policy necessarily," Geiger said. "I
think that the University looks at things
on an issue-bv-issue arrangement."
Kennedy echoed Geiger's statement,
but with a different twist. "I think that
you look at each thing as it comes
along," he said. "There certainly was
not a fixed University policy."
However, Kennedy noted that the
University has been reluctant to lend its
facilities for outside use. "In that sense,
you have a policy."
Once Kopp got the go-ahead from
Stanford, he formed a nine-man com
mittee to begin preparing the city's pro
posal to the NFL owners.
The city's Convention and Visitors
Bureau published a booklet, entitled
"Super Bowl by the Bay," outlining the
Bay Area's proposal.
During the NFL players strike,
which delayed last month's owners
meeting in Dallas, Kopp and San Fran
cisco Mayor Diane Feinstein con
ducted a lobbying campaign over the
phone.
At the meeting itself, postcards with
pictures of the city and complimentary
bottles of wine were given to the owners
of the 28 N FL franchises in an effort to
swav their vote.
All in all, Kopp felt the lobbying
proved successful. "I think it was effec
tive," he said. "Everybody I talked to
was congenial."
