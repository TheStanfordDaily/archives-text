# Pleads not guilty
## Amos arraigned 
### HEATHER MILLAR 
Donald John Amos, suspect in the
murder of honors student Angela
Arvidson, pleaded not guiltv on
three charges at his arraignment
Dec. 17 in the Santa Clara County
Municipal Courts in Palo Alto
Amos faces charges for the
murder of Arvidson, for being an ox
felon in possession of a concealable
weapon and for the posession of a
stolen .38 caliber revolver and a rifle.
The degree of murder charged has
not yet been specified. If charged
with first degree murder, Amos
could face 25 years to life in prison if
convicted. If he is charged with sec
ond degree murder, the penalty
could be 17 years to life.
A preliminary hearing, in which a
municipal court judge decides
whether or not enough evidence ex
ists for the suspect to be tried, will be
held tomorrow. Sgt. Thomas Beck, a
Santa Clara County Sheriff detec
tive who has worked extensively on
the case, feels confident that the evi
dence is sufficient to warrant a trial.
He said, "otherwise I wouldn't have
filed the claim.'"
Randal Schneider, the public de
fender assigned to the case, was un
available for comment.
If tomorrow's preliminary hear

ing results in a trial, the suspect will
be arraigned in the Santa Clara
County Superior Court, where a
trial date will be set. Goorge Ken
nedy, senior deputy district attorney
for Santa Clara County, said he ex
pects a trial beginning sometime in
March.
Arvidson died of multiple stab
wounds in the Frenchman's Hill
campus home of Prof. Lawrence
KedesOct. 22,1982. A junior major
ing in comparative liter
ature.Arvidson had been cleaning
the Kedes home to help pay the costs
of attending college. She had been
alone in the house less than an hour
when Kedes' son returned home and
found Arvidson's body.
When the Santa Clara County
Sheriff determined that Amos was
believed to have delivered plastic
garbage bags to the Kedes' residence
on the afternoon of the slaying, a
municipal court judge issued a war
rant for his arrest. Almost three
weeks later, Amos ended the nation
wide search mobilized to locate him
when he showed up at the Santa
Clara County Jail Nov. 14 saying, "I
am Don Amos. I understand you
guvs are looking for me."
Amos has been in custody since
then. Bail for Amos has not been set.
