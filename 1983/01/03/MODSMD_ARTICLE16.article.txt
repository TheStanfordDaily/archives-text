## The
						Stanford Daily Random housing has purpose 
### 
They're moving in today, and it makes a lot of
people a little jealous. We're talking about the
lucky 260 students whose home, starting today,
changes from the drabbest and dingiest — Man
zanita Park's trailers — to the newest and nicest —
the suites in Governor's Corner.
A fall quarter in the trailers was a small price to
pay for the luxury they will enjoy now. Groups of
four, six or eight students will live in each lavishly
decorated suite; they will share a common living
room and bathroom, while each will have his own
small but attractive bedroom. They will eat
meals in handsomely paneled eating clubs rather
than in conventional dining rooms. With nearby
Lake Lag well on the way to filling earlier than it
has in years, winter and spring quarters must look
awfully paradisiacal to those reveling in their
brand-new environs.
And so it is no wonder that those back in the
trailers, Wilbur, Stern and elsewhere are grumbl
ing more than a little bit. They envy their friends
who live on the Row or in Governor's Corner or
the Cowell Ouster; dreaming of having a single or
a two-room double — or at least a view of some
thing besides a parking lot — they shake their
heads and wonder why they didn't get so lucky.
That's an easy one to answer, they know: it was the
draw, it was that stupid little card with a number in
the 4000s they pulled out of the trunk in Tresidder.
But there are more difficult questions, ones a lot
of us have been asking lately when we walk by the
lavish new dorms, the gorgeously decorated Storey
House and other such residences on the way to
less-pleasing surroundings, and then hear that the
costs for the new construction will be borne by all
on-campus residents here, all of whom pay similar
room rates. Why, some of us are wondering, do we
have to pay for their luxury?
Those who've had to bear Stern's leaky roofs,
Wilbur's warping walls and the trailers' ant
infested kitchens are hardly likely to be im

mediately sympathetic to th* answer. But it's a
good one: the University doesn't charge different
rates for different amenities in order to avoid the
danger of economic segregation.
Not a good reason, you say? Think about it. If
room rates were set as user fees, those in the suites
would likely pay twice as much as those in, say,
Stern. What that would mean is that those struggl
ing their way through Stanford by relying on loans,
grants and jobs would choose economy over their
yearning for a brand-new single with a window
facing the lake and eating-club privileges and in
stead go back to that dreary one-room double on a
single-sex floor overlooking dining rooms where
they serve green roast beef. Those whose bills are
paid by a trust fund established before they were a
twinkle in Mom's eye would be only too happy to
park their BMWs in the lot by the lake and enjoy
luxurious surroundings that seem almost like the
country club at home.
We'd hate to see that. One of the best equalizing
factors for this economically diverse student body
is that all undergraduates who live on campus have
the same shot at luxury; the luck of the draw, not
the size of the wallet, must continue to determine
where students live. If anything needs to be
reexamined, it is neither the rate structure nor the
draw itself but the draw system as a whole. Our
biggest gripe is with the returning residents' prior
ity, that bugaboo of unlucky freshman that makes
the first draw the most important because it often
determines whether their housing for the next
three years will be a pleasure or a pain.
A change in that system might allow those who
will have to grin and bear it today and for the rest of
u.e year when they hear their friends rave about
their new rooms to be able to gloat next year when
they will have the brand-new singles and their
friends will have the ants.
