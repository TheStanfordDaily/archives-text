## A 						CIA agent here, a CIA agent there 
### 
The problem with having Central Intelligence
Agency agents in Latin America isn't that we
shouldn't have agents there. The problem is that to
put agents there, we're going to have to remove them
from other places. I mean, it's hard enough to go
sneaking around and being covert with 150 agents in
a country, but just try being sneaky without anyone.
Take Southern Cumdumpadump, for example.
Now, we all know that the only reason they can
continue producing lots of bubble-gum is because our
CIA stops all the Northern Cumdumper terrorists
from insurging. So if we take all our agents out of
Southern Cumdumpadump, the Northerners will run
in and make it just another Soviet-financed bubble
gum republic. I can just see Soviet Communist Party

Chairman Yuri Andropov blowing a big old bubble in
President Reagan's face.
So we certainly can't sacrifice the agents in Latin
America. Without them, we'd have to allow the
communists in, which would topple governments and
destabilize regions like El Salvador. And we wouldn't
be able to topple governments and stabilize regions
like Nicaragua.
I was thinking about this problem when the solu
tion hit me like a hundred Russian bombs committing
fratricjdei ovcr tbe.pJaim of Wyoming. We don't have
to take our agents off the bubble-gum patrol. We can
just hire new ones! Isn't there an unemployment
problem? Doesn't Congress want a jobs bill? And
doesn't the administration want to beef up the CIA?

Seems like a perfect compromise to me.
Why, we could have agents running all over the
globe supporting American interests. In no time we
could confuse the Northern Cumdumpers into pro
ducing bubble-gum. We could keep the OPEC coun
tries fighting with each other. We could even put
more agents in Europe and keep any more countries
from going socialist. Maybe we could even get the
French to drink California wines.
Sure it would cost some, but so does the jobs bill.
Besides, hundreds of thousands of Groucho glasses
and spy coats can't cost all that much.
More jobs and more security. The CIA can watch
over everything, even, eventually, you and me.
