## President Reagan's 'bravery' is reminiscent of past mistakes 
### 
President Reagan has told me and
millions of like-minded that we are
misguided. Millions join me in the
conviction that he is the one mis
guided. And because the power of his
position is so great the impact of a
misled mind in the Oval office has
awful consequences.
I heard Hugh Sidey, Time's
Washington contributing editor, say
on PBS-TVs "Agronsky and Com
pany," that "Ronald Reagan is one of
the bravest presidents we have ever
had." The context was how firmly he
was "staying the course" in economic
policy.
The thought struck me that Reagan
being brave in an economic sense was
very like General William Westmore
land "bravely" ordering attacks
against the expert jungle-fighting
Viet Cong.
Vietnam's real costs in human
damage — beyond the 50,000
Americans killed — are beginning to
become apparent now — seven years
after the shameful flight from the
American command compound in
Saigon. Hurts to remember, doesn't
it? Remember the scrambling on the
walls, the reaching and grasping at the
helicopters?
I suggest that Reagan's economic
command decisions — dooming con
fident, talented and heretofore totally
successful and loyal workers to
months of jobless benefits and then
relief — has inflicted psychic and
emotional damage on human souls
that our nation will be reaping in mis
ery costs for years to come.
I believe the kind of emotional and
psychic hurt that Reagan has inflicted
on so many millions in order to be
personally "brave" in pursuing a to
tally misguided economic policy
eventually will be measured as one of
our nation's greatest tragedies.
But Reagan is glib at staying how

"Caring" he is. I perceive him to be a
facade of a man with no capacity for
genuine feeling for the lives he has
blighted.
Years down the road — after
economic recovery has restored some
of the victims to jobs and security —
there will be emotional disturbances
similar to those of Vietnam veterans
now reliving jungle war terror.
Who and whose budget will be re
sponsible for their hospital or
psychiatric care?
I predict that the problem will be
come a significant political issue be
fore 2000. If Reagan survives until
then you know his answer will be: let
the agencics of local governments
provide the services their people
need.
Let it then be remembered that
President Reagan purposefully imba
lanced the allocation of national re
sources in order to afford such pro
jects as the MX missile.
What a cost to pay for deterrent
nuclear weapons that will waste into
obsolescence and eventually be
junked. None has ever been fired.
None will ever be.
Reagan's economic program
clearly is a misguided policy that re
sulted in incredible waste of re
sources, both human and material.

Dead week final
We read with regret the Dec. 8 arti
cle in the Daily, which implied that
the final exam in our course, EES
-221, was in violation of "dead week
policy", "technically illegal", and the
result of "a failure of the professors
and their immediate superiors".
An examination of page 3 of the
Autumn Quarter 1982/83 Time

Schedule shows that Thursday, De
cember 9, 7:00 to 10:00 p.m., is a
permissible alternate time for our fi
nal, a fact confirmed by the registrar.
This alternate time was selected by
class request by an overwhelming
majority vote of the class in the sec
ond week of the quarter.
We, the staff of the course, are dis
mayed by the Daily's aspersions on
actions which were taken in full ag
reement with University policy and at
the request of the students involved.
We cannot but deplore the ignorant
statements of certain people quoted
in the article. But we do urge that the
Daily investigate more deeply before
it prints such irresponsible allega
tions.

Obscenity
I am writing this letter in regards to
the ad which appeared in the Gas
sifieds in the Daily. The one I saw in
the Dec. 3 issue was a personal ad.
However, I understand that the ad
has been running for some time. I
don't know whether or not you know
the meaning of the words in the ad
but, let me take this opportunity to let
you know briefly about them for your
reference. The second Japanese word
spelled-out in romanization starting
with "c" is very, very vulgar slang in
Japanese for a man's sexual organ,
and the fourth one starting with "m"
is even worse slang for a woman's.

It is simply an insult to our com
munity. What is more, it is an obscen
ity in the real meaning of the word. If
the person who is running this type of
ad in a university paper such as the
Daily is serious, he should be a candi
date for psychoanalysis. However, if
the person did it for a laugh, which
most likely is the case, then, I would
say, it is no laughing matter.

Trickle-down
In the Rev. Don Caughey's column
(Dec. 2, Daily) he states: "Trickle
down is the economics of oligarchy
and always has been. It has never met
any ethical test respecting the worth
of individual life." This puts me into a
dilemma.
Last year I worked (for myself)
many long hours. I made enough
extra money that I could afford to
hire a part-time private secretary. I
pay this person an hourly rate equal
to or above the going wage for such
job. No government or public money
was spent to create or sustain this job;
in fact, this job creates extra income
tax monies (as well as a plethora of
governmental red tape and hidden
costs so well known to employers).
This is "trickle-down" in action.
But according to Caughey, lam
unethical and don't respect "the
worth of individual life " So, I guess
to become ethical I should fire the
employee and de-create the job. But
isn't that unethical, too?
If "trickle-down" didn't work, the
Reverend would have to create his
own job rather than rely on the
largesse of a private university.

was spent to create or sustain this job;
in fact, this job creates extra income
tax monies (as well as a plethora of
governmental red tape and hidden
costs so well known to employers).
This is "trickle-down" in action.
But according to Caughey, lam
unethical and don't respect "the
worth of individual life " So, I guess
to become ethical I should fire the
employee and de-create the job. But
isn't that unethical, too?
If "trickle-down" didn't work, the
Reverend would have to create his
own job rather than rely on the
largesse of a private university.

President Reagan has told me and
millions of like-minded that we are
misguided. Millions join me in the
conviction that he is the one mis
guided. And because the power of his
position is so great the impact of a
misled mind in the Oval office has
awful consequences.
I heard Hugh Sidey, Time's
Washington contributing editor, say
on PBS-TVs "Agronsky and Com
pany," that "Ronald Reagan is one of
the bravest presidents we have ever
had." The context was how firmly he
was "staying the course" in economic
policy.
The thought struck me that Reagan
being brave in an economic sense was
very like General William Westmore
land "bravely" ordering attacks
against the expert jungle-fighting
Viet Cong.
Vietnam's real costs in human
damage — beyond the 50,000
Americans killed — are beginning to
become apparent now — seven years
after the shameful flight from the
American command compound in
Saigon. Hurts to remember, doesn't
it? Remember the scrambling on the
walls, the reaching and grasping at the
helicopters?
I suggest that Reagan's economic
command decisions — dooming con
fident, talented and heretofore totally
successful and loyal workers to
months of jobless benefits and then
relief — has inflicted psychic and
emotional damage on human souls
that our nation will be reaping in mis
ery costs for years to come.
I believe the kind of emotional and
psychic hurt that Reagan has inflicted
on so many millions in order to be
personally "brave" in pursuing a to
tally misguided economic policy
eventually will be measured as one of
our nation's greatest tragedies.
But Reagan is glib at staying how

"Caring" he is. I perceive him to be a
facade of a man with no capacity for
genuine feeling for the lives he has
blighted.
Years down the road — after
economic recovery has restored some
of the victims to jobs and security —
there will be emotional disturbances
similar to those of Vietnam veterans
now reliving jungle war terror.
Who and whose budget will be re
sponsible for their hospital or
psychiatric care?
I predict that the problem will be
come a significant political issue be
fore 2000. If Reagan survives until
then you know his answer will be: let
the agencics of local governments
provide the services their people
need.
Let it then be remembered that
President Reagan purposefully imba
lanced the allocation of national re
sources in order to afford such pro
jects as the MX missile.
What a cost to pay for deterrent
nuclear weapons that will waste into
obsolescence and eventually be
junked. None has ever been fired.
None will ever be.
Reagan's economic program
clearly is a misguided policy that re
sulted in incredible waste of re
sources, both human and material.

Dead week final
We read with regret the Dec. 8 arti
cle in the Daily, which implied that
the final exam in our course, EES
-221, was in violation of "dead week
policy", "technically illegal", and the
result of "a failure of the professors
and their immediate superiors".
An examination of page 3 of the
Autumn Quarter 1982/83 Time

Schedule shows that Thursday, De
cember 9, 7:00 to 10:00 p.m., is a
permissible alternate time for our fi
nal, a fact confirmed by the registrar.
This alternate time was selected by
class request by an overwhelming
majority vote of the class in the sec
ond week of the quarter.
We, the staff of the course, are dis
mayed by the Daily's aspersions on
actions which were taken in full ag
reement with University policy and at
the request of the students involved.
We cannot but deplore the ignorant
statements of certain people quoted
in the article. But we do urge that the
Daily investigate more deeply before
it prints such irresponsible allega
tions.

I am writing this letter in regards to
the ad which appeared in the Gas
sifieds in the Daily. The one I saw in
the Dec. 3 issue was a personal ad.
However, I understand that the ad
has been running for some time. I
don't know whether or not you know
the meaning of the words in the ad
but, let me take this opportunity to let
you know briefly about them for your
reference. The second Japanese word
spelled-out in romanization starting
with "c" is very, very vulgar slang in
Japanese for a man's sexual organ,
and the fourth one starting with "m"
is even worse slang for a woman's.

It is simply an insult to our com
munity. What is more, it is an obscen
ity in the real meaning of the word. If
the person who is running this type of
ad in a university paper such as the
Daily is serious, he should be a candi
date for psychoanalysis. However, if
the person did it for a laugh, which
most likely is the case, then, I would
say, it is no laughing matter.

Trickle-down
In the Rev. Don Caughey's column
(Dec. 2, Daily) he states: "Trickle
down is the economics of oligarchy
and always has been. It has never met
any ethical test respecting the worth
of individual life." This puts me into a
dilemma.
Last year I worked (for myself)
many long hours. I made enough
extra money that I could afford to
hire a part-time private secretary. I
pay this person an hourly rate equal
to or above the going wage for such
job. No government or public money
was spent to create or sustain this job;
in fact, this job creates extra income
tax monies (as well as a plethora of
governmental red tape and hidden
costs so well known to employers).
This is "trickle-down" in action.
