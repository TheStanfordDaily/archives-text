### BILL AINSWORTH 
Frederick Terman, the man credited
with building Stanford's School of En
gineering into one of the nation's best
and with helping to create Silicon Val
ley, died of a heart attack at age 82 on
December 19.
Terman served as provost of the Uni
versity from 1955 to 1965 and dean of
the School of Engineering from 1946 to
1955.
Called the "father of the modern
School of Engineering" by the current
dean of the school, William Kays,
Terman first became a professor of elec
trical engineering here in 1927 after
graduating from the University in 1920
with a bachelor's degree in chemical en
gineering. He received his Ph.D. from
M.I.T.
A Memorial Service will be held for
Terman tomorrow in Memorial
Churchat 4 p.m. The eulogies will be
given bv University President Donald
Kennedy, David Packard, chairman of
the board of Hewlett-Packard Co. and
a student of Terman's, and Kays.
About Terman's contribution to en
gineering here, Kays said,"he took a
reasonably good school and turned it
into one of the best in the country."
"After World War II he discovered
that federal money was available for re
search and he took advantage of it —
that was his good insight," Kays said.
Terman has had a lasting influence
on the School of Engineering. "He gave
it the momentum and big things haven't
changed much since his time. A lot of
the policies carried on now started
when he was dean," according to Kays.
One way Terman improved the
School of Engineering was to attract

top people in industry and top people
from other universities to the faculty
here. Terman practiced his theory of
"steeples of excellence" because he be
lieved that outstanding faculty would
attract excellent graduate students, top
notch junior faculty and grant money
for research.
In an interview with the Daily last
year Terman said, "There really wasn't
much to it. I had a technique — you get
the best people, the best people do the
research, and it falls into place."
"Fred knew how to attract people
and he did it largely on a shoestring,"
Kavs explained.
"He was persuasive and he had good
judgment. He'd go after the best people
and get them,"he added.
As a means of attracting engineering
faculty, Terman would often establish
consulting jobs in industry so he could
offer prospective faculty members a
package when they came to Stanford
that in many cases was more money

than thev could receive from industry.
When he became provost, Terman
applied his talents at attracting faculty
to other departments. He lured two
noted History professors here from oth
er universities, for example — Gordon
Craig from Princeton and David Potter
from Yale.
University President Donald Ken
nedy said about Terman, "he really did
have an extraordinary kind of academic
judgment about the future of the Uni
versity."
According to Kennedy, Terman's
"capacity to think constructively about
the future was the most remarkable
thing about him."
"He didn't let the urgent pre-empt
the future," Kennedy said.
Terman was instrumental in helping
several Stanford graduates begin engi
neering firms here in an area that later
grew into Silicon Valley. The original
reason he became interested in estab-"
lishing high technology industry in the
area was to find local employment for
graduates of his program — who at that
time had to go to the East in search of
work.
Two of the students he encouraged to
go into business were University gradu
ates Packard and Bill Hewlett, who in
the '30s began what is now the world re
nowned, multi-billion dollar engineer
ing firm of Hewlett-Packard.
To increase the interaction between
the University and industry, Terman in
1953 started the Honors Cooperative
program. This program allows quali
fied people from industry to be part
time graduate students and either at
tend classes or listen to lectures via a tel
