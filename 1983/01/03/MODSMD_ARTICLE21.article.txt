## Unused missiles work the best 
### 
The most effective nuclear missiles
we build will rust in their silos. They
will only be launched if either super
power miscalculates that a nuclear
exchange is survivable. Deterrence,
after all, rests on the perception of
power, not on the actual hardware
stored in the arsenals of the United
States and the Soviet Union. We
could make effective missiles out of
mud and straw ... so long as the
Soviets thought they were real, de

terrence would be maintained.
In light of this phenomenon, the
Reaganauts have done much to di
minish our defense posture by focus
ing on our weaknesses, particularly
the theoretical vulnerability of our
land-based missile forces — the third
leg of the land-sea-air nuclear triad.
Never mind that our upgraded nuc
lear submarines cruise the oceans
with little fear of detection. Never
mind that American cruise missiles
carried by bombers will soon be able
to penetrate Soviet airspace with de
vastating accuracy. President
Reagan, as a candidate for the presi
dency in 1976 and 1980, and as our
commander-in-chief now has chosen
to dwell on the perceived weakness of
the least important leg of the triad.
In 23 months in the Oval Office,
Reagan has managed to convince his
conservative constituency that the
United States is number two in milit
ary strength and falling fast. While
criticizing nuclear freeze advocates
for their failure to take a tough
minded view of the Soviet war
machine, Reagan has materially
weakened our deterrence posture by
trumpeting his conclusion that
American strategic forces are in
ferior. Back in the 1950s when the
Soviet Union was far behind us in the
arms race, it did everything in its
power to project an image of
strength. For the benefit of Western
observers, Soviet bombers would fly
wide circles over the Moscow parade
route on May Day to make it appear
that many different squadrons actu
ally existed. If America really is vul
nerable now, would it be a wise policy
to advertise this fact to our adver
sary?
Self-deception on this scale has a
precedent in recent American his
tory. When he ran for the presidency
in 1960, John F. Kennedy accused the
Eisenhower administration of allow
ing the Soviets to deploy more
strategic missiles than the United
States. But after the election, the new
defense secretary briefed JFK that a
"Missile Gap" did indeed exist, but
that we had the edge. Perhaps in those
days, before U.S. satellites constantly
scanned Soviet territory, it was easier
for us to fall prey to Soviet prop
aganda about their military prowess.

Today, we can only trace our sense
of insecurity to the way we choose to
analyze the configuration of Soviet
and American forces. Strategists at
the top level of the Reagan Pentagon
assert that the Russians envision a
nuclear exchange in which their
casualties are "held" to an "accepta
ble" total of 20 million. After all, the
argument goes, the Russians sus
tained casualties of that magnitude in
World War 11. In their eagerness to
portray the Russians as monsters,
Reagan's advisers have created a
monstrous model of human behavior.
The Soviet memory of its 20 million
WW II dead logically has led it to
build — perhaps overbuild — its
defenses in Eastern Europe. Only
madmen would suggest that the
Soviets, now secure in their bofders,
are willing to risk another catas
trophic loss of life and the incinera
tion of its major cities in the space of a
few hours.
Yet, the Pentagon quietly con
tinues to run computer programs cal
culating the outcomes of smaller and
larger nuclear exchanges. And, at the
bidding of the government, defense
contractors steadily develop the flex
ible and highly accurate weaponry
needed to fight the "limited" nuclear
wars envisioned in the Pentagon's
war games.
In the end, the Soviets do not
threaten us. The nuclear-tipped roc
kets aging slowly in their silos do not
threaten us. It is our war-fighting
strategy and planning that promises
to extinguish civilization on our fair
blue planet. Prophesies of war tend to
fulfill themselves. In planning and
building for nuclear war we are taking
the first two steps down the path to
armageddon.
But the missiles cannot launch
themselves. Before the war-fighters
gain irreversible momentum, Ameri
can voters will have the opportunity
to remove them from political power
and once again embrace the concept
of deterrence. Nuclear strategy de
termines the pace of the arms race. It
follows that the first step towards
arms control is mind control.
