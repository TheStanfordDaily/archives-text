## Card ups record to 8-2 Stanford wins three of four over vacation 
### MARK ZEIGLER 
The Stanford men's basketball
team upped its record to eight
two by winning three of its final
four pre-season games, eclipsing
last year's total win output of se
ven.
Victories over Cal State
Dominguez Hills (72-54) and
two Ivy league schools — Har
vard(Bl-77) and Brown(88-71)
— gave the Cardinal its best
non-league record in 21 years.
Its one loss came at Rutgers,
70-63.
Coach Howie Dallmar logged
a 9-0 mark against non
league foes during the 1961-62
season, one in which Stanford
finished at 20-5.
"We've got eight wins, "Stan
ford coach Tom Davis said after
last Tuesday's victory against
Brown. "And now we're looking
for number nine."
But win number nine will have
to come in the Pacific-10 Con
ference, a league that features a

level of basketball far above that
of the Sonoma States that the
Card faced in November and
December.
Stanford opens Pac-10 play
this Thursday night in Corvalis,
Ore., against defending league
champ Oregon State. The Car
dinal then travels to Eugene
Saturday to face Oregon.
Davis, in his first season as
Stanford's head coach, was
pleased with his team's perfor
mance over the Christmas break.
His team had weathered final
exams and an East Coast road
trip, the first away games of the
season.
"You always want a little
more," Davis said. "But you've
got to be pleased with the prog
ress of the team."
Juniors John Revelli and
Keith Jones led the charge for
the Cardinal, averaging 20.5 and
18.8 points per game, respec
tively, over the four game
stretch. Revelli also boarded at a

9.5 per game clip in the four con
tests.
Of the four, the Harvard game
was the closest. Stanford had a
chance at upsetting Rutgers
(7-1), but suffered a shooting
drought in the second half. The
Cal State Dominguez Hills and
the Brown games, both played at
home, were only close in the first
half.
Behind Harvard 36-34 at in
termission, Stanford faltered
early in the second period and
watched the Crimson pull to a
48-40 lead. But Jones came off
the bench to help the Card to a
56-54 advantage.
The lead see-sawed back and
forth until Revelli followed up an
offensive rebound to put Stan
ford ahead for good, 76-75, with
1:30 left.
Freshman point guard Keith
Ramee hit three of four free
throws down the stretch to nail
down the 81-77 win for Stan
ford.

Revelli made seven-of-ten
field goals and eight-of-nine free
throw attempts for his game high
23 points to go along with ten
rebounds. Jones added 17 points
before fouling out with 1:43 left,
while Ramee had four assists and
four steals.
Harvard's Clavin Dixon led
the Crimson with 21 points, four
assists and eight steals.
Two days later, before 6974
fans in Rutgers Athletic Center,
Stanford leaped out of the blocks
in the second half and turned a
41-36 deficit into a 46-41 lead
behind 10 straight points. But
after hitting its first six field goal
attempts of the second half, the
Card could connect on only two
of its final 15 shots.
In frustration, Stanford began
to foul, and watched Rutgers can
1 l-of-12 second half free throws
en route to the seven point vic
tory.
Six-foot-nine senior center
Roy Hinson paced the Scarlet at

tack with 21 points and seven
boards. But it was his school re
cord 11 blocked shots that made
the difference. Revelli assumed
high-scoring honors with 22
points, followed by Jones' 18 and
freshman walk-on Andy
Fischer's 12. The Cardinal bench
could muster only seven points.
The Harvard and Rutgers
road games were sandwiched be
tween two home contests, both
of which Stanford won handily.
In its final tune-up before this
Thursday's Pac-10 opener, the
Cardinal downed a young Brown
squad behind 17 second-half
points from Jones before 5515
fans, the largest home crowd of
the season. It was the first meet
ing ever between Stanford and
Brown.
Jones finished with a career
high 27 points in just 29Vi mi
nutes of action, including two
dunks late in the second half.
Revelli powered for 18, while
sophomore guard Steve Brown
scored 15, also a career best.
Revelli scored his 1000 th
career point at the 11:21 mark in
the first half, and is well on his
way to becoming the Farm's
most prolific scorer.
Brown, led by 5-7 guard Alex
Bynum's 16 points and eight as
sists, shot a miserable 38.5 per
cent from the field, hitting on
just 30-of-78 attempts. To com
plicate matters for the visiting
Bruins, Stanford converted all
21 of its second half free throws.
The Bruins were able to keep
close through the first half with a
sagging man-to-man defense
that double-teamed Revelli in
side. Brown led 38-37 with 1:01
left in the first period.
But Jones and Brown erupted
for four points each in the final
minute to give the Card brea
thing room at the intermission.
Brown pulled to within six
with 13 minutes remaining in the
game, but Davis' fast breaking
brand of basketball paved the
way for the Card to rocket to a
68-56 advantage four minutes
later.
Against Cal State Dominguez
Hills on Saturday, Dec. 18, Stan
ford outscored the Toros 22-
seven in the first 12 minutes of
the second half, after only lead
ing 32-31 at the break.
The Cardinal shot 61 percent
from thie field to the Toros' 44

percent and rebounded the vis
itors 41-21. Three Cal State
Dominguez Hills starters fouled
out in the contest, played before
2543 fans in Maples Pavilion.

Revelli paced Stanford with
19 points and 12 rebounds.
Jones and Brown each added 13
and Ramee contributed six as
sists and four steals.
