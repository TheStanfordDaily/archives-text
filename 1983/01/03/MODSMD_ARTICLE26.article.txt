# Johnson named Coach of the Year

### DONALD NAGLE 
Brooks Johnson, director
of track and field at Stanford
since 1979 and the women's
cross-country coach since
1981, was named Coach of
the Year by Runner's World
magazine and is profiled in
the January, 1983 issue of
that publication.
The award is given to one
coach each year, and all run
ning coaches, whether they
are at the collegiate or club
level, are eligible. Three of
the more noted runners-up
include Dick Brown of Athle
tics West, Chuck De√üus of
the Los Angeles Naturites,
and Bill Dellinger of the Uni
versity of Oregon.
Johnson has been on the
coaching staff of the U.S. na
tional team seven times since
1969, and he was the sprint
coach for the U.S. team at the
Montreal Olympics in 1976.
More recently, he was named
head coach for the U.S. team
for the upcoming '84 Olym
pics to be held in Los
Angeles.

Johnson's success at Stan
ford began 14 months ago
when the women's cross
country team took third place
at the nationals. The women's
track team took fifth place at
the NCAA's last spring. Fi
nally, this fall, the women's
team took second at the cross
country nationals.
Johnson cited recruiting as
the key to his success at Stan
ford. "In the last three years,
we've gotten the top three
kids on the continent coming
out of high school (Ellen
Lyons, Ceci Hopp and Alli
son Wiley). If there's any
thing we've been pleased
with, it's that we've been able
to keep our top athletes at
their level and bring the
others along."
Another component
Johnson stresses is hard work,
with an emphasis on speed
workouts. "As long as the
winner is decided on the least
elapsed time from one point
to another, speed will always
be the critical factor," he said.
"A distance runner should
train like a sprinter."
