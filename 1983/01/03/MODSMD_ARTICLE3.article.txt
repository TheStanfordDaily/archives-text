# ACLU appeals Franklin's dismissal
## 
### HEATHER MILLAR 
The case of a former tenured English
professor dismissed bv the University
for allegedly inciting acts of violence
moved up to the next judicial step last
month when the first district of the Cali
fornia Appellate Court agreed to hear
the American Civil Liberty Union's
(ACLU) appeal.
In 1971 the Santa Clara County Su
perior Court upheld Stanford's de
cision to dismiss H. Bruce Franklin.
The case has been wending its way
th rough t he courts since then (please see
box, back page).
A self-proclaimed Marxist-Leninist,

Franklin made a series of speeches pro
testing the Vietnam War and what heal
leged to be Stanford's complicity in that
war. The University later charged that
these speeches incited violence and dis
ruption on campus.
After a prolonged hearing, the Uni
versity Faculty Advisory Board voted
5-2 to dismiss Franklin despite his
tenured status. He was the second
tenured professor to be dismissed from
Stanford. The first — Thorstein Veblen
— was dismissed in 1900.
The Universitv counsel is currently
preparing a replv to the ACLU's brief,
and must file a replv brief by January

10. University Counsel John Schwartz
said he could not discuss the details of
the response.
With the acceptance of this case by
the appellate court, ACLU counsel
Margaret Crosby said, "This is the first
time that the court will consider the
constitutional issues,"
The ACLU claims that Franklin's
speeches were protected by the First
Amendment. "The Superior Court did
consider those (First Amendment) is
sues, but constitutional issues are very
much the province of the appellate
court," Crosby said.
"The reason that this case is so im
portant is that the threat of dismissal,
especially in thiseeonomv, is a very real
one." Crosbv said. "It's much easier to
go home and rave over the dinner table
than to risk vour job to speak out on an
issue about which vou feel deeply."
Franklin said in a recent interview
with the Daily, "This is a constitutional
case. A classic First Amendment case.
The question is: is this or is this not pro
tected speech?"
"It's got absolutely nothing to do
with academic freedom," said
Schwartz. "(The case) has to do with
many issues, but none of them involves
academic freedom." Because he did not
have his files on hand, Schwartz de
clined to elaborate further.
Due to a judicial backlog, Crosby
said she doesn't expect oral arguments
to be heard bv the court for at least two
years. She estimated the whole process
will not be over for six to eight years.
University President Donald Ken
nedy. who chaired the 1971 Advisory
Board and voted against dismissing
franklin, declined to comment on the
latest development in the case, as did
several other other members of that

board.
"Professor Franklin was singled out
not lor what he did but for what he be
lieved. If academic freedom means any
thing, it's that those people should be
protected." said Crosby. Crosby also
emphasized the difference between ad
vocacy and incitement, saying that
Franklin's behavior should be catego
rized as advocacy.
With regard to the length of the liti
gation, Franklin said, "So far things are
following the course we expected. As I
said many times while I was at Stan
ford, Stanford owns the Santa Clara
Court system so we didn't expect to
win."
Asked to comment, Schwartz re
plied, "I wouldn't even grace that with a
response."
Franklin said he is dismayed by the
current tenor of college campuses
which he said he believes was brought
about in part by his case. "My dismissal
gave the green light to the kind of re
pression that was beginning to get un
derway . . . that resulted in a
whitewashing of the campuses." He de
clined to cite any specific example of
this, saying "it's a well known fact of
American educational history."
