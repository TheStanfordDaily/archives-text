# CHRONOLOGY OF FRANKLIN CASE
## 
### 
1971 — Lyman in March charges Franklin with four alleged offenses:
/ Significantly participating in and contributing to disruption that kept Ambassador
Henry Cabot Lodge from delivering a scheduled speech Jan 11.
2. On Feb. 11, urging and inciting students at a White Plaza rally to disrupt University
functions by shutting down the Computation Center which was subsequently
shut down.
J. Following the occupation of the Computation Center, significantly interfering with
the orderly dispersal response to police orders by urging and inciting students
to disobey those orders.
4. During an evening rally in White Plaza, intentionally urging and inciting students to
engage in disruptive conduct which threatened injury to individuals and prop
erty. Lyman claimed that acts of violence followed.
1972 —Aftera hearing which lasted six weeks, the Faculty Advisory Board decides in
January by a vote of 5-2 that Franklin be dismissed from the University,
though the Henry Cabot Lodge charge is found to be false. The board of
trustees dismisses Franklin. In August, the American Civil Liberties Union
(ACLUI files suit in the Santa Clara County Superior Court against the Uni
versity for Franklin's dismissal.
1973 — Stanford makes a motion to dismiss the entire case. That motion is denied by
Superior Court Judge John Flaherty.
1974 — Flaherty confines the trial to the record that had been made before the Ad
visory Board in 1971.
'976 — Both Stanford and the ACL U file motions for a summary judgment without a
trial.
1978 — Jan. ruling by Flaherty denied both motions for rejudgment. Also ruled that
Franklin was guilty of two of the three charges. Flaherty reasoned that Old
Union speech was protected by the First Amendment. The White Plaza and
Computation Center speeches are the only speeches still under consideration
in the case. Flaherty asked Stanford to redetermine the appropriateness of its
penalty. Stanford appeals these losses.
1980 — ACLU asked for an open hearing of the Faculty Advisory Board. This re
quest was denied. Written statements are submitted to the Advisory Board

6-0 vote that dismissal was the appropriate penalty for Franklin. The hoard of
trustees upholds this decision.
