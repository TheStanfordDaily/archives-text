France not to reduce missiles
Paris â€” President Francois Mitterrand said yesterday that France would
not reduce the number of its nuclear missiles and called U.S.-Soviet arms
talks in Geneva "none of our affair."
Responding to questions about Soviet President Yuri Andropov's recent
offer to reduce medium-range Soviet missiles in Europe to the level of those
of France and Britain, Mitterrand said: "We will not reduce a single one of
our missiles . . . There is no point in dreaming.
"There is no direct relation between the situation of the two superpowers a
nd the situation of France," he said in a live television interview.
Mitterrand said he favored a balance of forces in Europe, a balance he said
does not now exist. He said he hoped the arms reduction talks in Geneva
succeed, but ifthevdo not, it would be "normal that the Pershings(the U.S.
missiles planned for deployment in Western Europe) be installed in Eu
rope."
Under policv initiated bv the late President Charles de Gaulle, France
doesn't participate militarily in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization or
allow its territory to be used bv NATO forces.
Mitterrand, asked about a possible French-Soviet summit, replied that a
"certain comportment bv the Soviets made this meeting difficult and less
useful," referring to the situation in Afghanistan and Poland.
"We will certainly discuss it, the sooner the better, but that supposes new
dispositions on certain major points," he said.
