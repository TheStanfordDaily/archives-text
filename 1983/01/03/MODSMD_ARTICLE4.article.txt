France not to reduce missiles
Paris — President Francois Mitterrand said yesterday that France would
not reduce the number of its nuclear missiles and called U.S.-Soviet arms
talks in Geneva "none of our affair."
Responding to questions about Soviet President Yuri Andropov's recent
offer to reduce medium-range Soviet missiles in Europe to the level of those
of France and Britain, Mitterrand said: "We will not reduce a single one of
our missiles . . . There is no point in dreaming.
"There is no direct relation between the situation of the two superpowers a
nd the situation of France," he said in a live television interview.
Mitterrand said he favored a balance of forces in Europe, a balance he said
does not now exist. He said he hoped the arms reduction talks in Geneva
succeed, but ifthevdo not, it would be "normal that the Pershings(the U.S.
missiles planned for deployment in Western Europe) be installed in Eu
rope."
Under policv initiated bv the late President Charles de Gaulle, France
doesn't participate militarily in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization or
allow its territory to be used bv NATO forces.
Mitterrand, asked about a possible French-Soviet summit, replied that a
"certain comportment bv the Soviets made this meeting difficult and less
useful," referring to the situation in Afghanistan and Poland.
"We will certainly discuss it, the sooner the better, but that supposes new
dispositions on certain major points," he said.
Most of the hour-long interview from Mitter
rand's country home in southwest France focused
on domestic economic issues.
Kremlin: U.S. stalling at Geneva
Moscow — The Kremlin is bolstering its posi
tion at the Geneva strategic arms reduction talks
by accusing the Reagan administration of stalling
tactics the Soviets warn will lead to new arms
build-ups.
After two weeks of emphasizing the new Soviet
leadership's latest position on reducing medium
range nuclear arsenals in Europe, Moscow has
turned its attention to the parallel negotiations
with the United States for reducing long-range nu
clear weapons aimed at each other.
The Soviets sav U.S. intransigence has stalled
both talks, set to resume in a month. Western
diplomats here say (he Soviet propaganda is meant
for the American public and the new Congress.
"The Soviets obviously decided that since they
want to link the two talks, they must convince the
U.S. public and its representatives in Congress that
the talks are nearing a deadlock and that it is all the
fault of the United States," said a Western
diplomat here.
The Kremlin spurred peace activists in Western
Europe with warnings that civilians would be en
dangered by nuclear exchanges that might occur
between the Soviets and U.S. missiles scheduled
for deployment in NATO countries.
Yesterday the Communist Party newspaper
Pravda carried a lengthy editorial on the
"START" talks, as President Reagan calls them.
The arms reduction talks are aimed at replacing
the unratified 1979 SALT II treaty. Pravda claimed
new U.S. defense plans will violate that treaty's
protocol calling for each side to abide by the pact's
terms until a new treaty is negotiated.
The editorial accused the United States of "pre
serving an impasse" in the U.S.-Soviet long-range
missile reduction talks until new, medium-range
U.S. missiles are deployed in North Atlantic Trea
ty Organization countries in Europe. Meanwhile,
Pravda charged, Washington is pursuing a costly
weapons-buildup program rife with violations of
the SALT II agreements.
The "U.S. administration, which persists in its
absolutely one-sided approach, is totally respon
sible for the stalemate at the talks," Pravda said.
Flash flood in Brazil kills 40
Belo Horizonte, Brazil — A heavy rain swept
through this mining capital yesterday, causing
flash floods that collapsed buildings and claimed
an estimated 40-50 lives, civil defense Sgt.
Mauricio Vargas reported.
He said that at one location in the downtown
area, raging waters reached the second floor of an
office building and at least two buildings — one
three stories and the other six stories — collapsed.
Buses, cars and pedestrians were carried away
and one bridge was destroyed, Vargas reported.
Col. Barroso of the civil defense force, contacted
by telephone, told The Associated Press that scores
of people were injured and more than 500 were left
homeless.
He said he had reports that "shacks in slum
areas, which we haven't been able to reach, were
destroyed by the floods."
The colonel said the waters were receding and

the Red Cross and other volunteer organizations
were providing temporary shelter for (he victims.
Belo Horizonte. 200 miles north of Rio de
Janiero, has a population of about 400,000.
Israel ties East to Pope plot
Tel Aviv — Israel believes Italy's claims that
there is a Bulgarian connection — and a link to the
Soviet K(iß — in the attempted assassination of
Pope John Paul 11, a high Israeli military source
says.
The official, who spoke to the Associated Press
yesterday under a guarantee of anonymity, added
Israel's voice to the growing international chorus
charging that bast bloc intelligence agencies were
involved in the 1981 attempt bv Turkish terrorist
Mehmel Ali Agca to kill the Polish-born pope.
"Bulgaria does nothing without the approval of
the K( i B," the source said. "All the supply of arms
to the Palestine Liberation Organization in Leba
non was under direct orders from Moscow to Bul
garia.
"So if thev are going to carrv out an operation
like assassinating the Pope, 1 don't believe that
Bulgaria would do it without the permission, or
without getting an order from Russia, from the
headquarters of the KGB."
The source said he was persuaded by evidence
coming out of Italy, and disagrees with intelligence
assessments that doubt Soviet or Bulgarian in
volvement.
"The Germans said they don't believe the Sovi
ets are behind it, not even the Bulgarians. But we
believe the Italians. We don't believe that Italy
would go to charge the Soviet Union or Bulgaria,
which is one of its satellites, with trying to kill the
Pope without any hard proof," he said.
Although Italy has indicted two Bulgarians and
implicated a third for complicity in the May 1981
assassination attempt, Italian prosecutors have not
publicly detailed the allegations.
Italian politicans have mentioned the so-called
"Bulgarian connection," and Defense Minister
Lelio Lagorio, in a speech to Parliament, called
Bulgaria's possible involvement "an act of war in
peacetime."
The case, beginning with the November arrest of
the Rome station chief of the Bulgarian national
airline, has severelv strained Italian-Bulgarian re
lations, with the two countries recalling their am
bassadors.
Appointees cited for cabinet
Palm Springs — Three current appointees of
President .Reagan and a defeated Republican con
gressman have emerged as leading contenders to
replace resigned Secretary of Transportation Drew
Lewis, it was learned Saturday.
Although the search for a replacement is far
from complete, and other names could be added
later, a White House official, speaking on condi
tion that he not be identified, said that these four
individuals now are being seriously considered for
the Cabinet post:
—Elizabeth Dole, the president's assistant for
public liaison and the top woman appointee in his
administration. She is the wife of Senate Finance
Committee Chairman Robert Dole (R-Kan.).
—Reese Tavlor, chairman of the Interstate
Commerce Commission and a former Carson City,
Nev., law partner of Sen. Paul Laxal (R-Nev.),
Reagan's closest friend in Congress.

—Darrell T rent, as deputy secretary of transpor
tation. the number two man in the department. He
came to the Reagan administration from the Hoo
ver Institution at Stanford University.
—Rep. Thomas Evans (R-Del.). who was de
feated for reelection in November after serving
three terms in the House. He was one of the earliest
congressional supporters of Reagan for the presi
dency.
Taylor and Evans — like Lewis — have a back
ground of strong political support for Reagan.
Trent, director of the Emergency Preparedness Of
fice under President Nixon, directed policy coordi
nation for Reagan's pre-inauguration transition
team.
Dole, however, would bring to the Cabinet
something Reagan and his advisers very much
want: her female gender. Reagan, who appointed
the llrst woman in history to the Supreme Court,
has been under pressure to place a woman in his
Cabinet.
But some White House officials, speaking on
condition thev not be identified, questioned wheth
er this was the right Cabinet post for Dole, a con
sumer affairs deputy director and member of the
Federal Trade Commission during previous ad
ministrations.
