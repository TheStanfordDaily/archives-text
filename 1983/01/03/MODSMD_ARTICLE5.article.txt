# History professor plans appeal
## Freedman denied tenure again 
### DOUGLAS JEHL 
A rare reconsideration bv the Com
mittee on Appointments and Promo
tions (CAP) and the deans of human
ities and sciences has produced a reaf
firmation of the controversial decision
of nine months ago: award-winning
Asst. History Prof. Estelle Freedman
has again been denied tenure.
But the Freedman battle does not ap
pear to be over. According to Law
School Prof. Barbara Babcock, chair
man of a newlv-formed Freedman sup
port committee, Freedman plans to ap
peal the decision to Provost Al Hastorf,
and plans to "take every step" to gain
tenure.
The committee is working to gain
support for an organized protest to the
provost and to raise funds for a possible
legal battle, according to Babcock. The
committee is working with the support
and encouragement of Freedman, she
said.
Freedman, currently on sabbatical,
was not available for comment at her
San Francisco home. She has made few
statements to the press during the case.
Support committee chairman Bab
cock outlined three main issues in the
case in an interview with the Daily yes

terdav: the merit of Freedman's
teaching and research, the University's
responsibility to consider affirmative
action and the future of the Feminist
Studies program.
Babcock emphasized that Freed
man's scholarship was excellent, but
said that the deans should have con
sidered the future of the Feminist Stud
ies program and affirmative action ele
ment in making their decision.
"The loss of Freedman would mean
the death of the Feminist Studies Pro
gram," she said.
If a legal challenge is necessary, it
would be made on the grounds of Title
XII of the Civil Rights Act, Babcock
said. Such a challenge would be made if
appeals to Hastorf and University Pres
ident Donald Kennedy were unsuc
cessful.
From 1977 to 1979, Babcock was an
assistant attorney general in the civil
rights division of the Department of
Justice.
Freedman was informed of the de
cision Dec. 8 bv James Sheehan, chair
man of the History Dept.
According to William Chace, as
sociate dean of humanities and sci
ences, he and the other deans unani

mouslv voted to accept the CAP's re
newed recommendationthat Freedman
not be granted tenure because her
teaching and research did not measure
up to University standards.
Chace said the CAP decision was
"clearly and decisively negative." He
would not characterize it as unanimous,
as he has other CAP decisions.
The unusually long tenure battle
began in March, 1982, when Freedman
was informed by then-History Depart
ment Chairman Peter Stansky that the
deans had voted to deny her tenure.
That decision was met with opposition
bv many students and faculty members
here, and led to the History Depart
ment's submitting new evidence sup
porting Freedman to the University.
A special History Department com
mittee, chaired bv Prof. Carl Degler,
was formed last spring. It assembled a
file of material, including letters from
experts outside the University, that
pointed out the quality of Freedman's
scholarship and submitted it to the Uni
versity. However, the CAP refused to
make a recommendation because the
file "had not been properly solicited,"
according to Chace.
A new file was submitted in mid-Oc
tober along with a renewed departmen
tal recommendation that Freedman be
granted tenure. The CAP devoted two
long meetings to the Freedman case, ac
cording to Chace, and then passed
along its negative recommendation to
the deans. Dean of H & S Norman
Wessels, Assoc. Dean Calvin Quate and
Chace took "a good long time to think
about and discuss the case," according
to Quate, before making their decision.

Assoc. Deans David Kennedy and
Carolyn Lougee, both history pro
fessors, did not take part in the de
cision. University policy excludes deans
who are members of a candidate's de
partment from participating in tenure
decisions.
From the start, the protest has spilled
beyond the official challenges. Students
and professors expressed shock and dis
appointment over the original decision;
many submitted letters in support of
Freedman to the special History De
partment committee.
In early June, more than 300 people
joined in a noontime rally supporting
Freedman. That protest culminated in a

march to the H & S Department where
petitions bearing 324 signatures were
presented to Chace.
At that rally, professors and student
speakers expressed anger at the Univer
sity for not recognizing Freedman's
merit, accused the University of dis
criminating on the basis of sex, and
worried that the Feminist Studies Pro
gram, which Freedman co-founded,
could not survive without her.
Freedman was the recipient of the
Lloyd W. Dinkelspiel award for out
standing service to undergraduate
education in June of 1981 and the
Dean's Award for distinguished
teaching in 1978.

That decision was met with opposition
bv many students and faculty members
here, and led to the History Depart
ment's submitting new evidence sup
porting Freedman to the University.
A special History Department com
mittee, chaired bv Prof. Carl Degler,
was formed last spring. It assembled a
file of material, including letters from
experts outside the University, that
pointed out the quality of Freedman's
scholarship and submitted it to the Uni
versity. However, the CAP refused to
make a recommendation because the
file "had not been properly solicited,"
according to Chace.
A new file was submitted in mid-Oc
tober along with a renewed departmen
tal recommendation that Freedman be
granted tenure. The CAP devoted two
long meetings to the Freedman case, ac
cording to Chace, and then passed
along its negative recommendation to
the deans. Dean of H & S Norman
Wessels, Assoc. Dean Calvin Quate and
Chace took "a good long time to think
about and discuss the case," according
to Quate, before making their decision.

Assoc. Deans David Kennedy and
Carolyn Lougee, both history pro
fessors, did not take part in the de
cision. University policy excludes deans
who are members of a candidate's de
partment from participating in tenure
decisions.
From the start, the protest has spilled
beyond the official challenges. Students
and professors expressed shock and dis
appointment over the original decision;
many submitted letters in support of
Freedman to the special History De
partment committee.
In early June, more than 300 people
joined in a noontime rally supporting
Freedman. That protest culminated in a

march to the H & S Department where
petitions bearing 324 signatures were
presented to Chace.
At that rally, professors and student
speakers expressed anger at the Univer
sity for not recognizing Freedman's
merit, accused the University of dis
criminating on the basis of sex, and
worried that the Feminist Studies Pro
gram, which Freedman co-founded,
could not survive without her.
Freedman was the recipient of the
Lloyd W. Dinkelspiel award for out
standing service to undergraduate
education in June of 1981 and the
Dean's Award for distinguished
teaching in 1978.
A rare reconsideration bv the Com
mittee on Appointments and Promo
tions (CAP) and the deans of human
ities and sciences has produced a reaf
firmation of the controversial decision
of nine months ago: award-winning
Asst. History Prof. Estelle Freedman
has again been denied tenure.
But the Freedman battle does not ap
pear to be over. According to Law
School Prof. Barbara Babcock, chair
man of a newlv-formed Freedman sup
port committee, Freedman plans to ap
peal the decision to Provost Al Hastorf,
and plans to "take every step" to gain
tenure.
The committee is working to gain
support for an organized protest to the
provost and to raise funds for a possible
legal battle, according to Babcock. The
committee is working with the support
and encouragement of Freedman, she
said.
Freedman, currently on sabbatical,
was not available for comment at her
San Francisco home. She has made few
statements to the press during the case.
Support committee chairman Bab
cock outlined three main issues in the
case in an interview with the Daily yes

terdav: the merit of Freedman's
teaching and research, the University's
responsibility to consider affirmative
action and the future of the Feminist
Studies program.
Babcock emphasized that Freed
man's scholarship was excellent, but
said that the deans should have con
sidered the future of the Feminist Stud
ies program and affirmative action ele
ment in making their decision.
"The loss of Freedman would mean
the death of the Feminist Studies Pro
gram," she said.
If a legal challenge is necessary, it
would be made on the grounds of Title
XII of the Civil Rights Act, Babcock
said. Such a challenge would be made if
appeals to Hastorf and University Pres
ident Donald Kennedy were unsuc
cessful.
From 1977 to 1979, Babcock was an
assistant attorney general in the civil
rights division of the Department of
Justice.
Freedman was informed of the de
cision Dec. 8 bv James Sheehan, chair
man of the History Dept.
According to William Chace, as
sociate dean of humanities and sci
ences, he and the other deans unani

mouslv voted to accept the CAP's re
newed recommendationthat Freedman
not be granted tenure because her
teaching and research did not measure
up to University standards.
Chace said the CAP decision was
"clearly and decisively negative." He
would not characterize it as unanimous,
as he has other CAP decisions.
The unusually long tenure battle
began in March, 1982, when Freedman
was informed by then-History Depart
ment Chairman Peter Stansky that the
deans had voted to deny her tenure.
That decision was met with opposition
bv many students and faculty members
here, and led to the History Depart
ment's submitting new evidence sup
