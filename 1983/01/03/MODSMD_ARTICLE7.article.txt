The 98th Congress convenes
lodav and with its opening marks
the beginning of a new session of
battle with the Reagan adminis
tration.
Not only have the Democrats
increased their hold over the
House bv 26 seats, but the Sen
ate's Republican majority has in
dicated that it will show more in
dependence from the White
House during the next two years.
Though President Reagan ac
knowledges the opposition, Rea
gan conceded that one of his
prime objectives, a balanced
budget, is currently out of reach,
and he has made it clear he will
not abandon his conservative
principles to achieve what he sees
as "quick fix" solutions. Reagan
remains firms on the course he
has set, holding firm on budget
and tax cuts and resisting pres
sure for a massive economic
stimulus program.
Compromise, however, is a
tactic the Republican adminis
tration may undertake in hopes
of meeting calls for White House
action to spur economic growth.
Administration officials plan to
counter the Democratic offerings
with antirecession programs of
their own.

Another test of the president's
more conciliatory approach will
come when Congress begins de
liberations on the new federal
budget. The White House is ex
pected to ask lawmakers to trim
about 525 billion from non-de
fense programs, including cuts in
medical care for the poor and
elderly, food stamps and welfare.
New economic initiatives will
be announced in Reagan's state
of-the-union address to Congress
laic this month Among the ideas
bciivj considered to stimulate em
ployment are tax credits for em
ployers who hire high school
graduates or dropouts; use of
some unemplovment-compensa
tion funds to train, relocate and
subsidize private-sector jobs for
laid-off workers, and a special ex
emption for employers to hire
youths in the summertime at less
than the current $3.35-an-hour
minimum wage.
Still, Reagan may not be able
to avoid a showdown with
Capitol Hill legislators over jobs
legislation. With unemployment
near 11 percent, Congress is like
ly to reject anv changes in the
minimum wage or the unemploy
ment compensation system. Rea
gan has vowed to veto anv plan to
put jobless workers on the public
payroll.
