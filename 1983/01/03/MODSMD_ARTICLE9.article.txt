# Social Security changes ahead

Compiled from news reports and wire services
Stiffer payroll taxes, slower benefit growth and a
later retirement age are among the changes Social
Security may face in 1983.
The Social Security system, in need of $250
billion over the next seven years, will be saddled
with a 514.2 billion deficit in 1983 alone, officials es
timate. According to President Reagan's National
Commission on Social Security Reform, without
reforms the program won't be able to pay benefits
on time and will face bankruptcy in early 1984.
Though the commission has yet to issue an of
ficial report, leaks to the press have included a
number of proposals in the year-long attempt to
find a remedy for the $216 billion system's financial
ills. When a compromise is finally hammered out it
is likely to include:
•Higher payroll taxes levied on 116 million work
ers.
•A temporary delay in cost-of-living increases
(COLA's) paid to 36 million retirees, survivors and
the disabled.
•A mandatory addition to of federal
vforkers.'"'*» -• * - -
•A gradual increase in the retirement age for re
ceiving full benefits.

Tax increases are currently scheduled for 1984,
1985 and 1986. Accelerating the increase would
raise an extra SI 35 billion dollars in the rest of the
decade, but Reagan opposes the move as to large a
burden on the taxpayer. To cushion the blow, Dem
ocrats on the presidential commission suggest the
tax speedup be offset by a new income-tax credit
that would allow workers to deduct the amount of
any increase.
Both parties support a delay in payment of
COLA's from July until October through 1989.
Savings would be $35 billion. Another option gain
ing in popularity is changing the method of comput
ing COLA's. One plan would pay COLA's of 4 per
cent in 1983 and 1984. Thereafter increases would
equal the annual increase in economic gains, minus
1.5 percent. The system would save $180 billion
through 1989.
Covering federal workers would raise $21 billion
by 1989.
For the long term, a gradual raising of the retire
ment age during the rest of the century enjoys the
support of both parties.
Whatever the changes most prospects stress that
beneficiaries and workers through taxes and slower
benefit growth will be the ones to keep the program
afloat.

World leaders look for
ward to the new year, but
face the reality of linger
ing problems from 1982.
Clockwise: President
Reagan hopes to tame
Congress with com
promise measures, Israeli
Prime Minister Men
achem Begin seeks to
achieve a favorable reso
lution of the Mideast
crisis for his nation, and
Soviet leader Yuri An
dropov maintains careful
watch over U.S. defense
moves while building up
Soviet nuclear weapons.
