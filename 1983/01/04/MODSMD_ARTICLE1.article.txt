# Queen to visit Stanford
## Luncheon planned at Kennedy home 
### KRISTEN CHRISTOPHER Senior staff writer 
Stanford will have the Queen for a
day.
On March 3, President and Mrs.
Donald Kennedy will host a luncheon
for England's Queen Elizabeth II and
her husband, the Duke of Edinburgh, at
the president's residence, Hoover
House.
The Queen wanted to visit the Bay
Area and, in particular, the Hewlett-
Packard plant in Silicon Valley, as part
of a California tour, according to Bob
Hamrdla, assistant to the President.
"That makes Stanford and specifical
ly Hoover House a convenient stop," he
said.
Sandy Burke, Information Officer
for the British Consulate in San Fran
cisco, said the Queen and her party are
coming to Silicon Valley because "it is
an influential area of California ...
they want to see the seat of high tech
nology."
The guest list for the Hoover House
luncheon will be "Stanford-de
termined," according to Jeanne Ken
nedy, and will be composed of the royal
party and members of the Stanford
community.
"Very definitely we want to include
students," she said. "Our thinking is
that we want to have a broad represen
tation of the student body."
Kennedy said she was contacted by
British Consul General John Beaven
before Christmas about hosting the
luncheon.
The plans for the royal tour have
been made by both the White House
and the British Embassy and have been
approved bv Buckingham Palace, ac
cording to Burke. The royal party is
coming to Stanford at the invitation
President Reagan, she explained.
The consulate is coordinating the
plans on the local level, she added.
The number of people who will at
tend the luncheon has not yet been de
termined, although Kennedy said,
"We'll make it as large as we can."
The size of the royal party is also un
certain, according to Burke. "We have
some of the final arrangements to firm
up," she said.
The luncheon will be catered by Vic
toria Emmons, wife of History Prof.
Terence Emmons and a frequent
caterer of Hoover House parties, Mrs.
Kennedy said. Students will most likely
help serve the meal, since Emmons usu
ally hires them, she added.
Following the luncheon and the visit
to Hewlett-Packard, the royal party will
attend a reception and dinner in their
honor, hosted by President and Mrs.
Reagan at the Palace of the Legion of
Honor in San Francisco.
