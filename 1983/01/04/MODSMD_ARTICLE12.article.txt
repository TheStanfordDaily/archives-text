## The 						Stanford Daily Terman legacy lives on 
### 
A Memorial Service will be held today in Memo
rial Church at 4 p.m. so the Stanford community
can pay its last respects to one of the greatest
figures in the University's history. Today the
community mourns the loss of Frederick Terman,
an emeritus provost, and a former dean of the
School of Engineering and engineering professor,
who died last month at age 82.
The title of "father of the modern School of
Engineering" which Terman earned as a result of
his role in expanding and improving the quality of
the School, only indicates one area of Terman's
vast accomplishments. When he became provost,
Terman applied the same skills that were so suc
cessful in engineering to the rest of the University.
During his tenure as provost, Terman is said to
have "taken a good regional institution and built it
into a nationally and internationally famous one."
Terman's achievements were not limited to
academia. He is generally regarded as the
academic architect of the high-technology indust
rial area of Silicon Valley. By encouraging his en
gineering graduates to start engineering businesses
in the area, Terman helped create the industrial
development. Later, when the area was better es
tablished but still growing, Terman designed prog
rams that increased the interaction between indus
try and the University to the benefit of both.
Terman's greatest accomplishments derived
from his ability to plan for the future of education.
University President Donald Kennedy said Ter
man's "capacity to think about the future was the
most remarkable thing about him."
Using the limited resources at his disposal, Ter
man concentrated on developing those key areas
which he believed would be expanding in the fu
ture. Time has proven that Terman's judgment was
outstanding.

When he became dean of the School of En
gineering after World War 11, Terman pioneered
in the use of federal government funds for Univer
sity research contracts. He realized early that gov
ernment contracts would become a large source of
University revenues and he was wise enough to
take advantage of them. It was Teiman's judicious
use of this source of revenue that greatly expanded
the research opportunities and capabilities of the
University in the '50s.
Terman's approach to improving the University
relied heavily on a philosophy which he called
"steeples of excellence." In this philosophy Ter
man identified the areas which he believed were
most important to the University's development
and then attempted to attract the best people in
them to the Stanford faculty. Sometimes he lured
these people away from other universities and
other times he ventured into industry to find out
standing faculty members. Terman found success
in tapping both of these areas.
Terman paid particular attention to building up
the Electrical Engineering Department, and ac
cording to the current Dean of the School, William
Kays, he made his biggest contribution in this de
partment.
Another of Terman's major contributions was
developing the Electronic Research Laboratory,
which helped expand the quality and the reputa
tion of the research done at the School of En
gineering.
Perhaps the most helpful lesson that present
college administrators can learn from Terman is
the importance he placed on taking actions in the
present that would strengthen the depth and qual
ity of education in the future. Because of his em
phasis on the future, Terman's positive impact on
Stanford will last for many years to come.
