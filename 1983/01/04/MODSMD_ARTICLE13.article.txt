## University must act to preserve history 
### 
There is a little house in the back
yard of 624 Mayfield where President
John Kennedy lived more than 40
years ago during his three months as a
struggling Stanford Business School
student . . . but you would never
know it.
The University thinks that there is
still a plaque there marking the spot
unless it has recently been "ripped
off' so that it "now graces some stu
dent's room." However, the current
occupant of the house, a University
coach, claims that he has never seen a
plaque in all the years he has lived
there, though he has heard rumors
that he lives in the Kennedy house.
In a first floor room in Branner
Hall, there is a stand-alone closet
with a superman mural on the side.
As far as I know, it is the only student
mural more than one year old which
still survives in Branner Hall despite
the building's colorful 60-year his
tory.

Martinez shakes his head as he re
members the beautiful murals which
used to grace student rooms but
which, several years later, have been
repainted, often at the whim of a
single student who is assigned the
room and dislikes the mural.
The superman mural has survived,
according to legend relayed by last

year's Brannerites, because the occu
pants of the room have traditionally
turned the closet to the wall at the end
of the year to escape the attention of
workers who clean the room over the
summer.
There is a small tragedy here, a
tragedy of malignant neglect. Much
of Stanford's student history has
slowly been erased.
Few have seen fit to commemorate
the generations of students who have
passed through Stanford's classrooms
with more than a row of shelves filled
with yearbooks and old newspapers,
and a building dedicated to one of the
two presidents who came this way.
Where is the plaque marking the
spot where Dean Ellwood Cubber
ley's house once stood; a spot where
Supreme Court Justices Sandra Day
O'Connor and William Rehnquist
used to play charades? Where is the
track that Bob Mathias ran on?
Where are the expressionist murals
reflecting the turbulent student times
of the 19605?
Admittedly, it may be costly to pro
tect the past. Yet, a first step toward
protecting our vanishing student his
tory would cost very little.
I propose that a joint student/
residential education committee be
formed to select two student murals
every year and declare them histori

cal works; labelling the student wails
as "student art," marking them with a
small plaque and protecting them
from the ravages of fresh paint.
Those who believe themselves de
fenders of individual freedom tell me
that they resent this idea as an imposi
tion upon students who are assigned
the rooms with the protected art.
Having been in several student rooms
in the East with plaques com
memorating famous alumni who had
lived there, I disagree. The protection
of student work shows a far greater
respect for the individual through the
recognition of creativity and
achievement.
Protecting student work would also
be in the interests of education, a pro
cess of confronting people with new
ideas and foreign values. In a similar
vein, the University has already re
served the right to place freshmen
with roommates who may not be
compatible and in rooms which may
have features not to students' likings.
I challenge Stanford to develop
mechanisms for protecting student
history. A good first step would be a
move toward the preservation of stu
dent art and the restoration of the
Kennedy plaque.
