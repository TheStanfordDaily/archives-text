## MX development threatens stability and security 
### 
The MX missile system is unneces
sary and destabilizing. This conclu
sion does not rest upon the vulnera
bility of the proposed dense-pack bas
ing mode alone.
The accuracy and kilotonnage of
the MX warheads make them useful
for a preemptive strike upon the
land-based nuclear forces of the
Soviet Union. This threat to the sur
vivability of the Soviet nuclear deter
rent will inspire the Kremlin to seek
countermeasures. A likely response is
to put Soviet missiles in a launch
on-warning mode. This means that
Soviet missiles would be launched
upon a warning that a nuclear attack
is in progress. The warning would be
provided by computers. Our
NORAD computers are known to
frequently give false warnings. It is
safe to assume that Soviet warning
systems are at least equally fallible.
Thus, the chance of a nuclear war be
ginning by accident is increased
enormously.
Due to the large number of
warheads per missile, the MX is an
attractive target for the Soviets. Un
less it is deployed in a manner which
convinces the Kremlin that it is invul
nerable, the existence of the MX in
creases the incentive for a Soviet first
strike. At least 30 basing schemes
have been examined, and none of the
land-based schemes among them is
widely believed to be invulnerable. It
is ludicrous to allocate money to pro
cure the missile with the thought that

a sensible basing mode will be found.
Let us not delude ourselves; the
onward march of technology is mak
ing the land-based nuclear missile
vulnerable — and there is no accept
able technological fix. Let us not de
spair; our submarine-based nuclear
forces offer sufficient destructive
capacity to deter the Soviets from in
itiating a nuclear conflict. Thus the
MX is unnecessary. Our security
would actually be decreased by its
deployment.
It is argued that our participation in
the Strategic Arms Reductions Talks
will be useless unless the MX goes
ahead. It is fallacious to believe that
we must be in a position of strength to
negotiate. If this is true, then once we
are in a position of strength the
Soviets will not be able to negotiate.

I was offended by the article
"Video Games Prove Productive"
(Daily, Dec. 8). It sets before us four
fairly sensible arguments against
viaeo games and claimed to show that
"upon closer examination all the in
dictments are groundless." Actual
ly, the article simply made three of
the arguments more plausible, while
restating the obvious in regard to the
other.

To parry the statement that "video
games are a waste of time," providing
"no constructive outlet for a person's
energy," the authors gave a stun
ningly erotic (and extremely sexist)
portrayal of the experience of playing
a video game. This was justified, I
take it, by the further comment that
these games give us a chance to vent
our frustration without raping, rob
bing and otherwise abusing other
humans. To a certain extent, the
comment is true: while spiritually
linked to a flashing video screen, no
one is going to talk to another human,
much less hurt him. But the violent,
abusive attitude that we take on while
engaged in battle with video aliens,
gorillas and demons carries over to
real life. While video players are vent
ing frustrations, they are learning that
violence is "OK" on the screen. Even
if they do get it out of their systems
and can hold themselves back from
murdering their calculus professor
after failing a final, they are still being
violent. Wouldn't it be nice if we
applied our technology in such a way
that we wouldn't need to be violent at
all?
Another argument was that "video
games are a threat to our nation's
children," that the games promote
bad posture and hurt developing
eyes. Backs and eyesight are in
danger then, right? So the authors as
sure us that children are also develop
ing their hand-eye coordination,
while simultaneously improving their

grip and the strength wrists.
Video gamers may need bifocals and
back braces, but you can't beat them
in thumb wrestling and ping pong.
Video games also promote creativ
ity, we are led to believe. The electron
beam blips are transformed through
enormous thought into mental beings
that challenge us to defeat them. I
think this is not quite a valid descrip
tion of what goes on in a player's mind
as he punches wildly at the buttons
and skillfully dials his ship around the
"Tempest" screen. 1 would argue that
rather than creating material
scenarios in which to place the
abstract images, video enthusiasts are
simply making the stimulus-response
associations which will help them to
win. This is learning, I admit. But it is
not creative activity.
And now the restatement of the
obvious: kids will spend their money
on something, and video games fill
the order. It is too bad that going to
school is likened to visiting a torture
chamber. For others it is a sign that
our nation's educators have simply
given up on trying to make learning
fun without compromising quality for
gimicks. Pity.
Well, excuse me. I'm going to go
study, and I'm not ashamed. Not one
bit.

Soviet Union. This threat to the sur
vivability of the Soviet nuclear deter
rent will inspire the Kremlin to seek
countermeasures. A likely response is
to put Soviet missiles in a launch
on-warning mode. This means that
Soviet missiles would be launched
upon a warning that a nuclear attack
is in progress. The warning would be
provided by computers. Our
NORAD computers are known to
frequently give false warnings. It is
safe to assume that Soviet warning
systems are at least equally fallible.
Thus, the chance of a nuclear war be
ginning by accident is increased
enormously.
Due to the large number of
warheads per missile, the MX is an
attractive target for the Soviets. Un
less it is deployed in a manner which
convinces the Kremlin that it is invul
nerable, the existence of the MX in
creases the incentive for a Soviet first
strike. At least 30 basing schemes
have been examined, and none of the
land-based schemes among them is
widely believed to be invulnerable. It
is ludicrous to allocate money to pro
cure the missile with the thought that

a sensible basing mode will be found.
Let us not delude ourselves; the
onward march of technology is mak
ing the land-based nuclear missile
vulnerable — and there is no accept
able technological fix. Let us not de
spair; our submarine-based nuclear
forces offer sufficient destructive
capacity to deter the Soviets from in
itiating a nuclear conflict. Thus the
MX is unnecessary. Our security
would actually be decreased by its
deployment.
It is argued that our participation in
the Strategic Arms Reductions Talks
will be useless unless the MX goes
ahead. It is fallacious to believe that
we must be in a position of strength to
negotiate. If this is true, then once we
are in a position of strength the
Soviets will not be able to negotiate.

I was offended by the article
"Video Games Prove Productive"
(Daily, Dec. 8). It sets before us four
fairly sensible arguments against
viaeo games and claimed to show that
"upon closer examination all the in
dictments are groundless." Actual
ly, the article simply made three of
the arguments more plausible, while
restating the obvious in regard to the
other.

To parry the statement that "video
games are a waste of time," providing
"no constructive outlet for a person's
energy," the authors gave a stun
ningly erotic (and extremely sexist)
portrayal of the experience of playing
a video game. This was justified, I
take it, by the further comment that
these games give us a chance to vent
our frustration without raping, rob
bing and otherwise abusing other
humans. To a certain extent, the
comment is true: while spiritually
linked to a flashing video screen, no
one is going to talk to another human,
much less hurt him. But the violent,
abusive attitude that we take on while
engaged in battle with video aliens,
gorillas and demons carries over to
real life. While video players are vent
ing frustrations, they are learning that
violence is "OK" on the screen. Even
if they do get it out of their systems
and can hold themselves back from
murdering their calculus professor
after failing a final, they are still being
violent. Wouldn't it be nice if we
applied our technology in such a way
that we wouldn't need to be violent at
all?
Another argument was that "video
games are a threat to our nation's
children," that the games promote
bad posture and hurt developing
eyes. Backs and eyesight are in
danger then, right? So the authors as
sure us that children are also develop
ing their hand-eye coordination,
while simultaneously improving their

grip and the strength wrists.
Video gamers may need bifocals and
back braces, but you can't beat them
in thumb wrestling and ping pong.
Video games also promote creativ
ity, we are led to believe. The electron
beam blips are transformed through
enormous thought into mental beings
that challenge us to defeat them. I
think this is not quite a valid descrip
tion of what goes on in a player's mind
as he punches wildly at the buttons
and skillfully dials his ship around the
"Tempest" screen. 1 would argue that
rather than creating material
scenarios in which to place the
abstract images, video enthusiasts are
simply making the stimulus-response
associations which will help them to
win. This is learning, I admit. But it is
not creative activity.
And now the restatement of the
obvious: kids will spend their money
on something, and video games fill
the order. It is too bad that going to
school is likened to visiting a torture
chamber. For others it is a sign that
our nation's educators have simply
given up on trying to make learning
fun without compromising quality for
gimicks. Pity.
Well, excuse me. I'm going to go
study, and I'm not ashamed. Not one
bit.

The MX missile system is unneces
sary and destabilizing. This conclu
sion does not rest upon the vulnera
bility of the proposed dense-pack bas
ing mode alone.
The accuracy and kilotonnage of
the MX warheads make them useful
for a preemptive strike upon the
land-based nuclear forces of the
Soviet Union. This threat to the sur
vivability of the Soviet nuclear deter
rent will inspire the Kremlin to seek
countermeasures. A likely response is
