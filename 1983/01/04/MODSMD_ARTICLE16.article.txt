# The 						question Mark â€¢ Mark Soble
## Evaluating governmental performance 
### 
A successful government can be
said to be a powerful government,
and the power of a government is the
sum of its capabilities. Government,
the primary secular authority, is es
sential to the contemporary state.
Many political, social and economic
factors help to determine whether a
government is "successful." By ob
serving the government's ability to
address these factors one can mea
sure the success, or lack of success, of
a given government.
A prosperous government needs to
have sovereignty and jurisdiction. A
government must be able to make
and enforce laws, and it must be the
final arbitrator of all disputes. With
out the ability to make decisions and
stand by them, a government is pow
erless.
Along the same line, a government
must be able to defend its interests
from outside intrusion. Generally, a
combination of means, including a
strong military, is necessary.
For both political and economic
reasons, a strong government needs
to have well-founded foreign rela
tions. An able diplomatic task force
will help achieve such relations.
Productive government must be
capable of turning resources (geog
raphy, raw materials and population)
into instruments of the national in
terest.
A successful government must also

have the talent to govern economi
cally. For example, a positive balance
of payments is essential, and this usu
ally requires a positive balance of
trade. A government must promote
this by using tariffs, subsidies or
other means. Also, there should be a
high employment rate and a fair dis
tribution of wealth.
Successful government does not
ignore human rights and decencies.
Equal opportunity, economic, politi
cal and educational, is vital. Without
equality, it is impossible for a gov
ernment to garner and hold the sup
port of the people.
A government's ability to impres
sively address these factors, and many
related factors, helps constitute its
level of success compared to other
governments and organizations.
Thus, entering 1983, newly elected
officials should be judged on similar
criteria. As both the new and old
lawmakers alike settle into their ac
quired responsibilities, we must at
tempt to ascertain and assess each in
dividual's role in the political process.
For only by constant, careful scrutini
zation of all leadership can we decide
the answer to this question: is
America as successful as one can
realistically expect?
