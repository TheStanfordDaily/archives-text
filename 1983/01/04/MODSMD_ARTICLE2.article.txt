Gov. Deukmejian, McCarthy sworn in
Sacramento — Promising a new era of common sense and bipartisanship
in the state Capitol, Republican George Deukmejian became California's
35th governor yesterday, ending eight colorful and controversial years of
Democrat Jerry Brown.
The former state legislator and attorney general repeated his intention to
cut state spending rather than raise taxes, but he clearly left the door open to
support a temporary tax increase to meet a projected 51.6 billion deficit in
the state budget.
In his first official action following the inaugural ceremonies, Deukmejian
ordered a 2 percent cutback in budgets of every division of state government
except a handful of departments such as prisons, hospitals and revenue-pro
ducing agencies such the Franchise Tax Board.
That executive order also imposed a freeze on employee promotions or
new hirings, contracts, out-of-state travel by state employees and major
equipment purchases. Aides said $70 million could be saved by the cutbacks.
Democrat Leo McCarthy was sworn in yesterday as California's 43rd lieu
tenant governor — the second in this century to serve with a governor from a
different party — and called for bipartisan cooperation to solve the state's
financial problems.
"The voters did not intend to elect a government that leads to stalemate,"
he told a crowd of about 700 people at his inaugural ceremony on the
Capitol's front steps.
The former Assembly speaker said "dogmatic platitudes" might please
political party activists but would not provide solutions to the $1.6 billion
budget deficit and other problems facing California.
"I'm not suggesting a four-year love affair" between Republican Gov.
George Deukmejian and the Democrat-dominated Legislature, he told re
porters after the ceremonv. "I'm suggesting that for 1983 we stop talking in
dogmatic platitudes" and reach a compromise.
The .San Francisco Democrat said Deukmejian "articulated a sharply
conservative philosophy" in his inaugural speech.
McCarthy said he will advise Deukmejian ahead oftime of any actions he
plans to take as acting governor when Deukmejian is out of the state. That
would give Deukmejian an opportunity to return to California to prevent
