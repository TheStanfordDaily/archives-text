Gov. Deukmejian, McCarthy sworn in
Sacramento — Promising a new era of common sense and bipartisanship
in the state Capitol, Republican George Deukmejian became California's
35th governor yesterday, ending eight colorful and controversial years of
Democrat Jerry Brown.
The former state legislator and attorney general repeated his intention to
cut state spending rather than raise taxes, but he clearly left the door open to
support a temporary tax increase to meet a projected 51.6 billion deficit in
the state budget.
In his first official action following the inaugural ceremonies, Deukmejian
ordered a 2 percent cutback in budgets of every division of state government
except a handful of departments such as prisons, hospitals and revenue-pro
ducing agencies such the Franchise Tax Board.
That executive order also imposed a freeze on employee promotions or
new hirings, contracts, out-of-state travel by state employees and major
equipment purchases. Aides said $70 million could be saved by the cutbacks.
Democrat Leo McCarthy was sworn in yesterday as California's 43rd lieu
tenant governor — the second in this century to serve with a governor from a
different party — and called for bipartisan cooperation to solve the state's
financial problems.
"The voters did not intend to elect a government that leads to stalemate,"
he told a crowd of about 700 people at his inaugural ceremony on the
Capitol's front steps.
The former Assembly speaker said "dogmatic platitudes" might please
political party activists but would not provide solutions to the $1.6 billion
budget deficit and other problems facing California.
"I'm not suggesting a four-year love affair" between Republican Gov.
George Deukmejian and the Democrat-dominated Legislature, he told re
porters after the ceremonv. "I'm suggesting that for 1983 we stop talking in
dogmatic platitudes" and reach a compromise.
The .San Francisco Democrat said Deukmejian "articulated a sharply
conservative philosophy" in his inaugural speech.
McCarthy said he will advise Deukmejian ahead oftime of any actions he
plans to take as acting governor when Deukmejian is out of the state. That
would give Deukmejian an opportunity to return to California to prevent

Budget deficit may hit record high
Washington— President Reagan's top economic advisers fear
that the new federal budget now being prepared for submission
to Congress will produce deficits so large that they will blight any
hope for significant economic recovery in 1983, administration
officials say. And thev believe that higher taxes may offer the
only hope of curbing the red ink.
Despite their private misgivings, none of the president's senior
economic advisers thus far has gone to the Oval Office with a
strong plea for a basic change in the administration's blueprint
for taxing and spending, the officials concede.
The budget mav result in a record deficit approaching $200
billion — potentially enough to halt the downward trend in in
terest rates and to abort an economic recovery. And, with Con
gress considered unlikely to approve large new cuts in domestic
programs and President Reagan determined to continue a major
defense build-up, administration economists say they see higher
revenues as the only way to curb the deficit.
But senior officials are reluctant to confront Reagan on the
problem because thev say his strong opposition to higher taxes
would make such an appeal futile.
"They all know the only way out of mammoth deficits is to go
for additional revenue," said one official, who asked not to be
identified. "The question is whether they will have the guts to tell
that to the president and, if they did, whether it would do any
good."
Reagan himself appears to be less worried than his advisers
about the impact of record-high deficits — which stem partly
from the recession and partly from the unprecedented reduction
in tax rates that was a key element of the president's economic
program in 1981.
As a result, he has resisted implied warnings from advisers that
years of large deficits may undercut the growth of 3 percent or
more that the administration hopes to achieve in 1983.
If Reagan's advisers continue to hang back and the budget
planning proceeds along current lines, the outcome is likely to be
aniUher major clash between the president and Congress, pro
ducing months of uncertainty over the government's fiscal plan
as the economy struggles to free itself from the recession in the
early months of next year.
New Congress limits stalling
Washington — Handing a defeat to conservatives, the new
9Sth Congress began work yesterday by strictly limiting mem
bers' ability to tie up legislation and attach social-issue "riders"
to appropriations bills.
House Democratic leaders also agreed last evening to remove
from the Budget Committee renegade Phil Gramm (D-Texas)
who helped President Reagan win approval for his budget cuts in
the last session.
Gramm mav switch to the Republican Party if a majority of
Democrats and the House votes as expected Thursday to follow
the leadership's punishment recommendation.
Lightv new House members, including 57 Democrats, and five
new senators took the oath of office, preparing for a session that
could be locked in partisan feuds over back-to-work programs,
Social Security, immigration law changes, the bankruptcy sys
tem and other issues unresolved by the last Congress.
fhe first bill introduced in the House yesterday was the Equal
Rights Amendment, which died last year when it failed to win the
necessary approval of three-fourths of the states. Beginning the
process all over again, supporters vowed to carry it through both
houses of Congress again and to continue fighting for approval
in the 38 necessary states.
The ERA, which guarantees women equal rights with men un
der the Constitution, won approval in both houses and in 35
states before expiring last June.
House members were sworn in as their small children
squirmed at their sides, admitted to the normally exclusive
House floor for the traditional first-day ceremonies. Freshman
Rep. Mel Levine(D-Calif.) rushed his 18-month-oldson, Adam,
out the door after he spilled a glass of milk during House Speaker
Tip O'Neill's welcoming speech, but seven-day old Alice Dew
ine, daughter of newcomer Rep. Michael Dewine (R-Ohio) slept
peacefully in her older sister's arms.
House and Senate leaders both agreed that the economy
would be the new Congress' first priority. "The first job has to be
to get the economy moving," said Senate Majority Leader How
ard Baker (R-Tenn.) at a press conference.
Warsaw Pact meets in Prague
Prague — Meeting for the first time under the leadership of
Yuri Andropov, the Soviet bloc opens a delayed biennial summit
meeting of the Warsaw Pact in Prague yesterday.
Although the agenda was not made public, there were strong
indications that the other East European leaders would give for
mal approval to the new Soviet Communist Party chiefs pro
posal for a nuclear arms freeze in Europe and would discuss the
bloc's economic problems.
Western diplomats and East European sources said they ex
pected few if anv new initiatives. But they cautioned against dis

counting its importance.
"The leadership change in Moscow came at a time of econom
ic crisis, at a time when a lot of this is coming to a head," said one
Westerner. "These people are bound to be thinking, 'What is my
role? What is inv status?" "
The partv chiefs from the other six countries all had arrived or
were en route last night to join Gustav Husak of Czechoslovakia.
They included Andropov, Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski of Poland,
President Nicolae Ceausescu of Romania, Janos Kadar of Hun
gary, Todor Zhivkov of Bulgaria and Erich Honecker of East
Germany.
Andropov met in Moscow with the others at the funeral of
President Leonid Brezhnev in November and the celebration in
December of the 60th anniversary of the Soviet Union. But this is
his first formal conference with them as the leader of the Soviet
party as well as his first trip abroad since his elevation.
The Slovak vouth newspaper Smena reported the meeting of
the Warsaw Pact Consultative Committee would also focus on
worsening relations with the West, including U.S. restrictions on
trade and technology exports.
Mondale, Askew enter Democratic race
Washington — Former Vice President Walter Mondale, front
runner in the polls for the Democratic presidential nomination in
19X4, and Former Gov. Reubin Askew of Florida became the
second and third candidates yesterday to file officially for the
race.
Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.), notified the Federal Election
Commission last Nov. 19 of his candidacy. In the interim. Sen.
Gary Hart (D-Colo.) informed the commission of fund-raising
activity conducted toward a possible presidential bid but he has
not filed as a candidate.
Registration with the federal agency is required to secure
matching federal funds for those given by contributors.
A letter carried to the commission office by a Mondale cam
paign worker designated the Mondale for President Committee
as his principal campaign agency, with an address in northwest
Washington, D.C.
Maxine Isaacs, Mondale's press spokesman, said campaign
officials will be named later this week. She said Mondale will
make a formal announcement of his candidacy in about two
months.
The former vice president made the rounds on Capitol Hill
yesterday, greeting new and returning lawmakers as the 98th
Congress convened. He spoke briefly at a reception gaiven by
Sen. Frank Lautenberg (D-N.J.) for whom Mondale had made
campaign appearances. Mondale also welcomed a former mem
ber of his vice presidential staff, Rep. Robert Toricelli (D-N.J.)
another congressional newcomer.
Mondale's prospects were enhanced when Sen. Edward Ken
nedy (D-Mass.) withdrew from the Democratic race, because
both men appealed to organized labor and the more liberal vot
ers in their party. Kennedy has given no public indication of his
choice for the nomination.
Israel, PLO bargain for prisoner release
Jerusalem — Foreign Minister Yitzhak Shamir confirmed yes
terday that Israel is engaged in direct negotiations with the
Palestine Liberation Organization in an effort to secure the re
lease of soldiers taken prisoner during the war in Lebanon, Israel
Radio reported.
Shamir spoke to a closed session of Parliament's Defense and
Foreign Affairs Committee. The state-operated radio network
broadcast a leaked version of his comments.
"We see this matter in the light of Jewish tradition," the radio
quoted Shamir as saving. "In Jewish law the redemption of pris
oners from captivity is of the first importance.
"Israel is not choosy regarding measures to ensure this aim
und is taking steps it rejects politically." the foreign minister was
quoted as having said.
Israel has steadfastly refused to engage in any contact with the
PLO, which it considers a terrorist organization determined to
eliminate the Jewish state. At Israeli urging, the United States
also has adopted a policy against direct dealing with the PLO.
However, Abdullah Franji, the PLO representative in Vienna
and Bonn, said last week that the PLO was holding talks on a
prisoner exchange with Arie Eliav, the former secretary-general
of Israel's opposition Labor Party.
Eliav has refused to discuss the matter.
Shamir did not confirm the details of the reported Franji-Eliav
contact. In fact, according to Israel Radio, the foreign minister
said manv reports about the talks had been incorrect. He refused
to supply anv details.
"As long as there are no concrete results, I will not disclose
anything," Shamir was quoted as saying.
EPA to battle charge of contempt
Washington — The Environmental Protection Agency is pre
paring to hire private lawyers at a cost of up to $70,000 to help
defend Administrator Anne Gorsuch against a contempt-of-
Congress charge lodged last month by the House.
FPA officials said yesterday that they need the outside advice
even though the Justice Department, not the EPA, is charged by

law with representing Gorsuch and has assigned a team of law
yers to the historic ease.
" This is not an indication that we have lost confidence in the
Justice Department," said a senior EPA official. "We just very
simply wanted to have available to us a kind of constitutional
expertise that frankly we don't have here on our staff."
The official said the agencv plans to sign a contract soon with
two lawyers from the Boston firm of Ropes and Gray to act as
consultants on constitutional and procedural issues in the case.
The two men will advise EPA's lawyers, who in turn are confer
ring with Justice at each stage of the proceedings.
Justice Department officials declined to comment on their re
action to EPA's move except to say they had nothing to do with
it. Fhev also predicted that the outside advice would have little
influence on their handling of the case.
"It's their (EPA's) money, and their choice in how they spend
it." said a department official. "But I don't think it will have
much effect on us."
The proceedings against Gorsuch mark the first time that the
lull House has charged a Cabinet-level official with contempt of
Congress for refusing to comply with a subpoena.
Gorsuch, acting under orders from President Reagan, refused
to turn over documents on her agency's prosecution of com
panies responsible for the nation's most dangerous hazardous
waste dumps.
ERA introduced as first bill of year
Washington— Backers of the failed Equal Rights Amendment
are starting again from scratch, re-introducing the measure as
the first bill of the 98th Congress.
"We must not permit the fires to cool for despite much
progress on women's issues, women today still suffer from dis
crimination in employment, education, pensions, and many oth
er areas," Rep. Peter Rodino (D-N.J.) said yesterday.
The proposed amendment, which would prohibit discrimina
tion on the basis of sex, was passed by Congress in 1972 with a
seven-year deadline for three-fourths of the state legislatures to
ratify it.
Congress granted a two-year extension in 1978, but only 35
states had ratified when that time ran out last June 30, three
states short of the necessary 38.
Rodino, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, said the
measure has 221 co-sponsors in the House, 190 of them Demo
crats. "It is a priority item of business for the Judiciary Commit
tee and we plan to go full-steam ahead," he said at a news con
ference.
Rep. Patricia Schroeder (D-Colo.) one of the co-sponsors,
said, "Our biggest problem is the Senate — whether we can get
the necessary two-thirds vote there."

fense Secretary Harold Brown; Texas Gov. William Clements, a

forces during its organizational meeting in the Cabinet Room at
the White House.
Brent Scowcroft, former national security affairs adviser to
President Gerald Ford and chairman of the commission, said it
faced a hard task in recommending a basing system for the nucle
ar weapon.
"Whatever we may come up is unlikely to meet with the unani
mous approval of everyone in the country, in the Congress, or
whatever," Scowcroft told reporters in the White House drive
way.
Reagan sa vs he will not be bound by recommendations of the
group, if they are at odds with the views of "our own military
people who are going to have to use these weapons if they're ever
used."

The former state legislator and attorney general repeated his intention to
cut state spending rather than raise taxes, but he clearly left the door open to
support a temporary tax increase to meet a projected 51.6 billion deficit in
the state budget.
In his first official action following the inaugural ceremonies, Deukmejian
ordered a 2 percent cutback in budgets of every division of state government
except a handful of departments such as prisons, hospitals and revenue-pro
ducing agencies such the Franchise Tax Board.
That executive order also imposed a freeze on employee promotions or
new hirings, contracts, out-of-state travel by state employees and major
equipment purchases. Aides said $70 million could be saved by the cutbacks.
Democrat Leo McCarthy was sworn in yesterday as California's 43rd lieu
tenant governor — the second in this century to serve with a governor from a
different party — and called for bipartisan cooperation to solve the state's
financial problems.
"The voters did not intend to elect a government that leads to stalemate,"
he told a crowd of about 700 people at his inaugural ceremony on the
Capitol's front steps.
The former Assembly speaker said "dogmatic platitudes" might please
political party activists but would not provide solutions to the $1.6 billion
budget deficit and other problems facing California.
"I'm not suggesting a four-year love affair" between Republican Gov.
George Deukmejian and the Democrat-dominated Legislature, he told re
porters after the ceremonv. "I'm suggesting that for 1983 we stop talking in
dogmatic platitudes" and reach a compromise.
The .San Francisco Democrat said Deukmejian "articulated a sharply
conservative philosophy" in his inaugural speech.
McCarthy said he will advise Deukmejian ahead oftime of any actions he
plans to take as acting governor when Deukmejian is out of the state. That
would give Deukmejian an opportunity to return to California to prevent

Budget deficit may hit record high
Washington— President Reagan's top economic advisers fear
that the new federal budget now being prepared for submission
to Congress will produce deficits so large that they will blight any
hope for significant economic recovery in 1983, administration
officials say. And thev believe that higher taxes may offer the
only hope of curbing the red ink.
Despite their private misgivings, none of the president's senior
economic advisers thus far has gone to the Oval Office with a
strong plea for a basic change in the administration's blueprint
for taxing and spending, the officials concede.
The budget mav result in a record deficit approaching $200
billion — potentially enough to halt the downward trend in in
terest rates and to abort an economic recovery. And, with Con
gress considered unlikely to approve large new cuts in domestic
programs and President Reagan determined to continue a major
defense build-up, administration economists say they see higher
revenues as the only way to curb the deficit.
But senior officials are reluctant to confront Reagan on the
problem because thev say his strong opposition to higher taxes
would make such an appeal futile.
"They all know the only way out of mammoth deficits is to go
for additional revenue," said one official, who asked not to be
identified. "The question is whether they will have the guts to tell
that to the president and, if they did, whether it would do any
good."
Reagan himself appears to be less worried than his advisers
about the impact of record-high deficits — which stem partly
from the recession and partly from the unprecedented reduction
in tax rates that was a key element of the president's economic
program in 1981.
As a result, he has resisted implied warnings from advisers that
years of large deficits may undercut the growth of 3 percent or
more that the administration hopes to achieve in 1983.
If Reagan's advisers continue to hang back and the budget
planning proceeds along current lines, the outcome is likely to be
aniUher major clash between the president and Congress, pro
ducing months of uncertainty over the government's fiscal plan
as the economy struggles to free itself from the recession in the
early months of next year.
New Congress limits stalling
Washington — Handing a defeat to conservatives, the new
9Sth Congress began work yesterday by strictly limiting mem
bers' ability to tie up legislation and attach social-issue "riders"
to appropriations bills.
House Democratic leaders also agreed last evening to remove
from the Budget Committee renegade Phil Gramm (D-Texas)
who helped President Reagan win approval for his budget cuts in
the last session.
Gramm mav switch to the Republican Party if a majority of
Democrats and the House votes as expected Thursday to follow
the leadership's punishment recommendation.
Lightv new House members, including 57 Democrats, and five
new senators took the oath of office, preparing for a session that
could be locked in partisan feuds over back-to-work programs,
Social Security, immigration law changes, the bankruptcy sys
tem and other issues unresolved by the last Congress.
fhe first bill introduced in the House yesterday was the Equal
Rights Amendment, which died last year when it failed to win the
necessary approval of three-fourths of the states. Beginning the
process all over again, supporters vowed to carry it through both
houses of Congress again and to continue fighting for approval
in the 38 necessary states.
The ERA, which guarantees women equal rights with men un
der the Constitution, won approval in both houses and in 35
states before expiring last June.
House members were sworn in as their small children
squirmed at their sides, admitted to the normally exclusive
House floor for the traditional first-day ceremonies. Freshman
Rep. Mel Levine(D-Calif.) rushed his 18-month-oldson, Adam,
out the door after he spilled a glass of milk during House Speaker
Tip O'Neill's welcoming speech, but seven-day old Alice Dew
ine, daughter of newcomer Rep. Michael Dewine (R-Ohio) slept
peacefully in her older sister's arms.
House and Senate leaders both agreed that the economy
would be the new Congress' first priority. "The first job has to be
to get the economy moving," said Senate Majority Leader How
ard Baker (R-Tenn.) at a press conference.
Warsaw Pact meets in Prague
Prague — Meeting for the first time under the leadership of
Yuri Andropov, the Soviet bloc opens a delayed biennial summit
meeting of the Warsaw Pact in Prague yesterday.
Although the agenda was not made public, there were strong
indications that the other East European leaders would give for
mal approval to the new Soviet Communist Party chiefs pro
posal for a nuclear arms freeze in Europe and would discuss the
bloc's economic problems.
Western diplomats and East European sources said they ex
pected few if anv new initiatives. But they cautioned against dis

counting its importance.
"The leadership change in Moscow came at a time of econom
ic crisis, at a time when a lot of this is coming to a head," said one
Westerner. "These people are bound to be thinking, 'What is my
role? What is inv status?" "
The partv chiefs from the other six countries all had arrived or
were en route last night to join Gustav Husak of Czechoslovakia.
They included Andropov, Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski of Poland,
President Nicolae Ceausescu of Romania, Janos Kadar of Hun
gary, Todor Zhivkov of Bulgaria and Erich Honecker of East
Germany.
Andropov met in Moscow with the others at the funeral of
President Leonid Brezhnev in November and the celebration in
December of the 60th anniversary of the Soviet Union. But this is
his first formal conference with them as the leader of the Soviet
party as well as his first trip abroad since his elevation.
The Slovak vouth newspaper Smena reported the meeting of
the Warsaw Pact Consultative Committee would also focus on
worsening relations with the West, including U.S. restrictions on
trade and technology exports.
Mondale, Askew enter Democratic race
Washington — Former Vice President Walter Mondale, front
runner in the polls for the Democratic presidential nomination in
19X4, and Former Gov. Reubin Askew of Florida became the
second and third candidates yesterday to file officially for the
race.
Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.), notified the Federal Election
Commission last Nov. 19 of his candidacy. In the interim. Sen.
Gary Hart (D-Colo.) informed the commission of fund-raising
activity conducted toward a possible presidential bid but he has
not filed as a candidate.
Registration with the federal agency is required to secure
matching federal funds for those given by contributors.
A letter carried to the commission office by a Mondale cam
paign worker designated the Mondale for President Committee
as his principal campaign agency, with an address in northwest
Washington, D.C.
Maxine Isaacs, Mondale's press spokesman, said campaign
officials will be named later this week. She said Mondale will
make a formal announcement of his candidacy in about two
months.
The former vice president made the rounds on Capitol Hill
yesterday, greeting new and returning lawmakers as the 98th
Congress convened. He spoke briefly at a reception gaiven by
Sen. Frank Lautenberg (D-N.J.) for whom Mondale had made
campaign appearances. Mondale also welcomed a former mem
ber of his vice presidential staff, Rep. Robert Toricelli (D-N.J.)
another congressional newcomer.
Mondale's prospects were enhanced when Sen. Edward Ken
nedy (D-Mass.) withdrew from the Democratic race, because
both men appealed to organized labor and the more liberal vot
ers in their party. Kennedy has given no public indication of his
choice for the nomination.
Israel, PLO bargain for prisoner release
Jerusalem — Foreign Minister Yitzhak Shamir confirmed yes
terday that Israel is engaged in direct negotiations with the
Palestine Liberation Organization in an effort to secure the re
lease of soldiers taken prisoner during the war in Lebanon, Israel
Radio reported.
Shamir spoke to a closed session of Parliament's Defense and
Foreign Affairs Committee. The state-operated radio network
broadcast a leaked version of his comments.
"We see this matter in the light of Jewish tradition," the radio
quoted Shamir as saving. "In Jewish law the redemption of pris
oners from captivity is of the first importance.
"Israel is not choosy regarding measures to ensure this aim
und is taking steps it rejects politically." the foreign minister was
quoted as having said.
Israel has steadfastly refused to engage in any contact with the
PLO, which it considers a terrorist organization determined to
eliminate the Jewish state. At Israeli urging, the United States
also has adopted a policy against direct dealing with the PLO.
However, Abdullah Franji, the PLO representative in Vienna
and Bonn, said last week that the PLO was holding talks on a
prisoner exchange with Arie Eliav, the former secretary-general
of Israel's opposition Labor Party.
Eliav has refused to discuss the matter.
Shamir did not confirm the details of the reported Franji-Eliav
contact. In fact, according to Israel Radio, the foreign minister
said manv reports about the talks had been incorrect. He refused
to supply anv details.
"As long as there are no concrete results, I will not disclose
anything," Shamir was quoted as saying.
EPA to battle charge of contempt
Washington — The Environmental Protection Agency is pre
paring to hire private lawyers at a cost of up to $70,000 to help
defend Administrator Anne Gorsuch against a contempt-of-
Congress charge lodged last month by the House.
FPA officials said yesterday that they need the outside advice
even though the Justice Department, not the EPA, is charged by

law with representing Gorsuch and has assigned a team of law
yers to the historic ease.
" This is not an indication that we have lost confidence in the
Justice Department," said a senior EPA official. "We just very
simply wanted to have available to us a kind of constitutional
expertise that frankly we don't have here on our staff."
The official said the agencv plans to sign a contract soon with
two lawyers from the Boston firm of Ropes and Gray to act as
consultants on constitutional and procedural issues in the case.
The two men will advise EPA's lawyers, who in turn are confer
ring with Justice at each stage of the proceedings.
Justice Department officials declined to comment on their re
action to EPA's move except to say they had nothing to do with
it. Fhev also predicted that the outside advice would have little
influence on their handling of the case.
"It's their (EPA's) money, and their choice in how they spend
it." said a department official. "But I don't think it will have
much effect on us."
The proceedings against Gorsuch mark the first time that the
lull House has charged a Cabinet-level official with contempt of
Congress for refusing to comply with a subpoena.
Gorsuch, acting under orders from President Reagan, refused
to turn over documents on her agency's prosecution of com
panies responsible for the nation's most dangerous hazardous
waste dumps.
ERA introduced as first bill of year
Washington— Backers of the failed Equal Rights Amendment
are starting again from scratch, re-introducing the measure as
the first bill of the 98th Congress.
"We must not permit the fires to cool for despite much
progress on women's issues, women today still suffer from dis
crimination in employment, education, pensions, and many oth
er areas," Rep. Peter Rodino (D-N.J.) said yesterday.
The proposed amendment, which would prohibit discrimina
tion on the basis of sex, was passed by Congress in 1972 with a
seven-year deadline for three-fourths of the state legislatures to
ratify it.
Congress granted a two-year extension in 1978, but only 35
states had ratified when that time ran out last June 30, three
states short of the necessary 38.
Rodino, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, said the
measure has 221 co-sponsors in the House, 190 of them Demo
crats. "It is a priority item of business for the Judiciary Commit
tee and we plan to go full-steam ahead," he said at a news con
ference.
Rep. Patricia Schroeder (D-Colo.) one of the co-sponsors,
said, "Our biggest problem is the Senate — whether we can get
the necessary two-thirds vote there."

forces during its organizational meeting in the Cabinet Room at
the White House.
Brent Scowcroft, former national security affairs adviser to
President Gerald Ford and chairman of the commission, said it
faced a hard task in recommending a basing system for the nucle
ar weapon.
"Whatever we may come up is unlikely to meet with the unani
mous approval of everyone in the country, in the Congress, or
whatever," Scowcroft told reporters in the White House drive
way.
Reagan sa vs he will not be bound by recommendations of the
group, if they are at odds with the views of "our own military
people who are going to have to use these weapons if they're ever
used."

Gov. Deukmejian, McCarthy sworn in
Sacramento — Promising a new era of common sense and bipartisanship

ordered a 2 percent cutback in budgets of every division of state government
except a handful of departments such as prisons, hospitals and revenue-pro
ducing agencies such the Franchise Tax Board.
That executive order also imposed a freeze on employee promotions or
new hirings, contracts, out-of-state travel by state employees and major
equipment purchases. Aides said $70 million could be saved by the cutbacks.
Democrat Leo McCarthy was sworn in yesterday as California's 43rd lieu
tenant governor — the second in this century to serve with a governor from a
different party — and called for bipartisan cooperation to solve the state's
financial problems.
"The voters did not intend to elect a government that leads to stalemate,"
he told a crowd of about 700 people at his inaugural ceremony on the
Capitol's front steps.
The former Assembly speaker said "dogmatic platitudes" might please
political party activists but would not provide solutions to the $1.6 billion
budget deficit and other problems facing California.
"I'm not suggesting a four-year love affair" between Republican Gov.
George Deukmejian and the Democrat-dominated Legislature, he told re
porters after the ceremonv. "I'm suggesting that for 1983 we stop talking in
dogmatic platitudes" and reach a compromise.
The .San Francisco Democrat said Deukmejian "articulated a sharply
conservative philosophy" in his inaugural speech.
McCarthy said he will advise Deukmejian ahead oftime of any actions he
plans to take as acting governor when Deukmejian is out of the state. That
would give Deukmejian an opportunity to return to California to prevent

Budget deficit may hit record high
Washington— President Reagan's top economic advisers fear
that the new federal budget now being prepared for submission
to Congress will produce deficits so large that they will blight any
hope for significant economic recovery in 1983, administration
officials say. And thev believe that higher taxes may offer the
only hope of curbing the red ink.
Despite their private misgivings, none of the president's senior
economic advisers thus far has gone to the Oval Office with a
strong plea for a basic change in the administration's blueprint
for taxing and spending, the officials concede.
The budget mav result in a record deficit approaching $200
billion — potentially enough to halt the downward trend in in
terest rates and to abort an economic recovery. And, with Con
gress considered unlikely to approve large new cuts in domestic
programs and President Reagan determined to continue a major
defense build-up, administration economists say they see higher
revenues as the only way to curb the deficit.
But senior officials are reluctant to confront Reagan on the
problem because thev say his strong opposition to higher taxes
would make such an appeal futile.
"They all know the only way out of mammoth deficits is to go
for additional revenue," said one official, who asked not to be
identified. "The question is whether they will have the guts to tell
that to the president and, if they did, whether it would do any
good."
Reagan himself appears to be less worried than his advisers
about the impact of record-high deficits — which stem partly
from the recession and partly from the unprecedented reduction
in tax rates that was a key element of the president's economic
program in 1981.
As a result, he has resisted implied warnings from advisers that
years of large deficits may undercut the growth of 3 percent or
more that the administration hopes to achieve in 1983.
If Reagan's advisers continue to hang back and the budget
planning proceeds along current lines, the outcome is likely to be
aniUher major clash between the president and Congress, pro
ducing months of uncertainty over the government's fiscal plan
as the economy struggles to free itself from the recession in the
early months of next year.
New Congress limits stalling
Washington — Handing a defeat to conservatives, the new
9Sth Congress began work yesterday by strictly limiting mem
bers' ability to tie up legislation and attach social-issue "riders"
to appropriations bills.
House Democratic leaders also agreed last evening to remove
from the Budget Committee renegade Phil Gramm (D-Texas)
who helped President Reagan win approval for his budget cuts in
the last session.
Gramm mav switch to the Republican Party if a majority of
Democrats and the House votes as expected Thursday to follow
the leadership's punishment recommendation.
Lightv new House members, including 57 Democrats, and five
new senators took the oath of office, preparing for a session that
could be locked in partisan feuds over back-to-work programs,
Social Security, immigration law changes, the bankruptcy sys
tem and other issues unresolved by the last Congress.
fhe first bill introduced in the House yesterday was the Equal
Rights Amendment, which died last year when it failed to win the
necessary approval of three-fourths of the states. Beginning the
process all over again, supporters vowed to carry it through both
houses of Congress again and to continue fighting for approval
in the 38 necessary states.
The ERA, which guarantees women equal rights with men un
der the Constitution, won approval in both houses and in 35
states before expiring last June.
House members were sworn in as their small children
squirmed at their sides, admitted to the normally exclusive
House floor for the traditional first-day ceremonies. Freshman
Rep. Mel Levine(D-Calif.) rushed his 18-month-oldson, Adam,
out the door after he spilled a glass of milk during House Speaker
Tip O'Neill's welcoming speech, but seven-day old Alice Dew
ine, daughter of newcomer Rep. Michael Dewine (R-Ohio) slept
peacefully in her older sister's arms.
House and Senate leaders both agreed that the economy
would be the new Congress' first priority. "The first job has to be
to get the economy moving," said Senate Majority Leader How
ard Baker (R-Tenn.) at a press conference.
Warsaw Pact meets in Prague
Prague — Meeting for the first time under the leadership of
Yuri Andropov, the Soviet bloc opens a delayed biennial summit
meeting of the Warsaw Pact in Prague yesterday.
Although the agenda was not made public, there were strong
indications that the other East European leaders would give for
mal approval to the new Soviet Communist Party chiefs pro
posal for a nuclear arms freeze in Europe and would discuss the
bloc's economic problems.
Western diplomats and East European sources said they ex
pected few if anv new initiatives. But they cautioned against dis

counting its importance.
"The leadership change in Moscow came at a time of econom
ic crisis, at a time when a lot of this is coming to a head," said one
Westerner. "These people are bound to be thinking, 'What is my
role? What is inv status?" "
The partv chiefs from the other six countries all had arrived or
were en route last night to join Gustav Husak of Czechoslovakia.
They included Andropov, Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski of Poland,
President Nicolae Ceausescu of Romania, Janos Kadar of Hun
gary, Todor Zhivkov of Bulgaria and Erich Honecker of East
Germany.
Andropov met in Moscow with the others at the funeral of
President Leonid Brezhnev in November and the celebration in
December of the 60th anniversary of the Soviet Union. But this is
his first formal conference with them as the leader of the Soviet
party as well as his first trip abroad since his elevation.
The Slovak vouth newspaper Smena reported the meeting of
the Warsaw Pact Consultative Committee would also focus on
worsening relations with the West, including U.S. restrictions on
trade and technology exports.
Mondale, Askew enter Democratic race
Washington — Former Vice President Walter Mondale, front
runner in the polls for the Democratic presidential nomination in
19X4, and Former Gov. Reubin Askew of Florida became the
second and third candidates yesterday to file officially for the
race.
Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.), notified the Federal Election
Commission last Nov. 19 of his candidacy. In the interim. Sen.
Gary Hart (D-Colo.) informed the commission of fund-raising
activity conducted toward a possible presidential bid but he has
not filed as a candidate.
Registration with the federal agency is required to secure
matching federal funds for those given by contributors.
A letter carried to the commission office by a Mondale cam
paign worker designated the Mondale for President Committee
as his principal campaign agency, with an address in northwest
Washington, D.C.
Maxine Isaacs, Mondale's press spokesman, said campaign
officials will be named later this week. She said Mondale will
make a formal announcement of his candidacy in about two
months.
The former vice president made the rounds on Capitol Hill
yesterday, greeting new and returning lawmakers as the 98th
Congress convened. He spoke briefly at a reception gaiven by
Sen. Frank Lautenberg (D-N.J.) for whom Mondale had made
campaign appearances. Mondale also welcomed a former mem
ber of his vice presidential staff, Rep. Robert Toricelli (D-N.J.)
another congressional newcomer.
Mondale's prospects were enhanced when Sen. Edward Ken
nedy (D-Mass.) withdrew from the Democratic race, because
both men appealed to organized labor and the more liberal vot
ers in their party. Kennedy has given no public indication of his
choice for the nomination.
Israel, PLO bargain for prisoner release
Jerusalem — Foreign Minister Yitzhak Shamir confirmed yes
terday that Israel is engaged in direct negotiations with the
Palestine Liberation Organization in an effort to secure the re
lease of soldiers taken prisoner during the war in Lebanon, Israel
Radio reported.
Shamir spoke to a closed session of Parliament's Defense and
Foreign Affairs Committee. The state-operated radio network
broadcast a leaked version of his comments.
"We see this matter in the light of Jewish tradition," the radio
quoted Shamir as saving. "In Jewish law the redemption of pris
oners from captivity is of the first importance.
"Israel is not choosy regarding measures to ensure this aim
und is taking steps it rejects politically." the foreign minister was
quoted as having said.
Israel has steadfastly refused to engage in any contact with the
PLO, which it considers a terrorist organization determined to
eliminate the Jewish state. At Israeli urging, the United States
also has adopted a policy against direct dealing with the PLO.
However, Abdullah Franji, the PLO representative in Vienna
and Bonn, said last week that the PLO was holding talks on a
prisoner exchange with Arie Eliav, the former secretary-general
of Israel's opposition Labor Party.
Eliav has refused to discuss the matter.
Shamir did not confirm the details of the reported Franji-Eliav
contact. In fact, according to Israel Radio, the foreign minister
said manv reports about the talks had been incorrect. He refused
to supply anv details.
"As long as there are no concrete results, I will not disclose
anything," Shamir was quoted as saying.
EPA to battle charge of contempt
Washington — The Environmental Protection Agency is pre
paring to hire private lawyers at a cost of up to $70,000 to help
defend Administrator Anne Gorsuch against a contempt-of-
Congress charge lodged last month by the House.
FPA officials said yesterday that they need the outside advice
even though the Justice Department, not the EPA, is charged by

law with representing Gorsuch and has assigned a team of law
yers to the historic ease.
" This is not an indication that we have lost confidence in the
Justice Department," said a senior EPA official. "We just very
simply wanted to have available to us a kind of constitutional
expertise that frankly we don't have here on our staff."
The official said the agencv plans to sign a contract soon with
two lawyers from the Boston firm of Ropes and Gray to act as
consultants on constitutional and procedural issues in the case.
The two men will advise EPA's lawyers, who in turn are confer
ring with Justice at each stage of the proceedings.
Justice Department officials declined to comment on their re
action to EPA's move except to say they had nothing to do with
it. Fhev also predicted that the outside advice would have little
influence on their handling of the case.
"It's their (EPA's) money, and their choice in how they spend
it." said a department official. "But I don't think it will have
much effect on us."
The proceedings against Gorsuch mark the first time that the
lull House has charged a Cabinet-level official with contempt of
Congress for refusing to comply with a subpoena.
Gorsuch, acting under orders from President Reagan, refused
to turn over documents on her agency's prosecution of com
panies responsible for the nation's most dangerous hazardous
waste dumps.
ERA introduced as first bill of year
Washington— Backers of the failed Equal Rights Amendment
are starting again from scratch, re-introducing the measure as
the first bill of the 98th Congress.
"We must not permit the fires to cool for despite much
progress on women's issues, women today still suffer from dis
crimination in employment, education, pensions, and many oth
er areas," Rep. Peter Rodino (D-N.J.) said yesterday.
The proposed amendment, which would prohibit discrimina
tion on the basis of sex, was passed by Congress in 1972 with a
seven-year deadline for three-fourths of the state legislatures to
ratify it.
Congress granted a two-year extension in 1978, but only 35
states had ratified when that time ran out last June 30, three
states short of the necessary 38.
Rodino, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, said the
measure has 221 co-sponsors in the House, 190 of them Demo
crats. "It is a priority item of business for the Judiciary Commit
tee and we plan to go full-steam ahead," he said at a news con
ference.
Rep. Patricia Schroeder (D-Colo.) one of the co-sponsors,
said, "Our biggest problem is the Senate — whether we can get
the necessary two-thirds vote there."
Reagan names MX advisory panel

strategic forces.
The panel includes former Secretary of State Alexander Haig,
a retired four-star general; former Carter administration De
fense Secretary Harold Brown; Texas Gov. William Clements, a

Reagan met with the bipartisan commission on strategic
forces during its organizational meeting in the Cabinet Room at
the White House.
Brent Scowcroft, former national security affairs adviser to
President Gerald Ford and chairman of the commission, said it
faced a hard task in recommending a basing system for the nucle
ar weapon.
"Whatever we may come up is unlikely to meet with the unani
mous approval of everyone in the country, in the Congress, or
whatever," Scowcroft told reporters in the White House drive
way.
Reagan sa vs he will not be bound by recommendations of the
group, if they are at odds with the views of "our own military
people who are going to have to use these weapons if they're ever
used."

Gov. Deukmejian, McCarthy sworn in
Sacramento — Promising a new era of common sense and bipartisanship
in the state Capitol, Republican George Deukmejian became California's
35th governor yesterday, ending eight colorful and controversial years of
Democrat Jerry Brown.
The former state legislator and attorney general repeated his intention to
cut state spending rather than raise taxes, but he clearly left the door open to
support a temporary tax increase to meet a projected 51.6 billion deficit in
the state budget.
In his first official action following the inaugural ceremonies, Deukmejian
ordered a 2 percent cutback in budgets of every division of state government
except a handful of departments such as prisons, hospitals and revenue-pro

equipment purchases. Aides said $70 million could be saved by the cutbacks.
Democrat Leo McCarthy was sworn in yesterday as California's 43rd lieu
tenant governor — the second in this century to serve with a governor from a
different party — and called for bipartisan cooperation to solve the state's
financial problems.
"The voters did not intend to elect a government that leads to stalemate,"
he told a crowd of about 700 people at his inaugural ceremony on the
Capitol's front steps.
The former Assembly speaker said "dogmatic platitudes" might please
political party activists but would not provide solutions to the $1.6 billion
budget deficit and other problems facing California.
"I'm not suggesting a four-year love affair" between Republican Gov.
George Deukmejian and the Democrat-dominated Legislature, he told re
porters after the ceremonv. "I'm suggesting that for 1983 we stop talking in
dogmatic platitudes" and reach a compromise.
The .San Francisco Democrat said Deukmejian "articulated a sharply
conservative philosophy" in his inaugural speech.
McCarthy said he will advise Deukmejian ahead oftime of any actions he
plans to take as acting governor when Deukmejian is out of the state. That
would give Deukmejian an opportunity to return to California to prevent

Budget deficit may hit record high
Washington— President Reagan's top economic advisers fear
that the new federal budget now being prepared for submission
to Congress will produce deficits so large that they will blight any
hope for significant economic recovery in 1983, administration
officials say. And thev believe that higher taxes may offer the
only hope of curbing the red ink.
Despite their private misgivings, none of the president's senior
economic advisers thus far has gone to the Oval Office with a
strong plea for a basic change in the administration's blueprint
for taxing and spending, the officials concede.
The budget mav result in a record deficit approaching $200
billion — potentially enough to halt the downward trend in in
terest rates and to abort an economic recovery. And, with Con
gress considered unlikely to approve large new cuts in domestic
programs and President Reagan determined to continue a major
defense build-up, administration economists say they see higher
revenues as the only way to curb the deficit.
But senior officials are reluctant to confront Reagan on the
problem because thev say his strong opposition to higher taxes
would make such an appeal futile.
"They all know the only way out of mammoth deficits is to go
for additional revenue," said one official, who asked not to be
identified. "The question is whether they will have the guts to tell
that to the president and, if they did, whether it would do any
good."
Reagan himself appears to be less worried than his advisers
about the impact of record-high deficits — which stem partly
from the recession and partly from the unprecedented reduction
in tax rates that was a key element of the president's economic
program in 1981.
As a result, he has resisted implied warnings from advisers that
years of large deficits may undercut the growth of 3 percent or
more that the administration hopes to achieve in 1983.
If Reagan's advisers continue to hang back and the budget
planning proceeds along current lines, the outcome is likely to be
aniUher major clash between the president and Congress, pro
ducing months of uncertainty over the government's fiscal plan
as the economy struggles to free itself from the recession in the
early months of next year.
New Congress limits stalling
Washington — Handing a defeat to conservatives, the new
9Sth Congress began work yesterday by strictly limiting mem
bers' ability to tie up legislation and attach social-issue "riders"
to appropriations bills.
House Democratic leaders also agreed last evening to remove
from the Budget Committee renegade Phil Gramm (D-Texas)
who helped President Reagan win approval for his budget cuts in
the last session.
Gramm mav switch to the Republican Party if a majority of
Democrats and the House votes as expected Thursday to follow
the leadership's punishment recommendation.
Lightv new House members, including 57 Democrats, and five
new senators took the oath of office, preparing for a session that
could be locked in partisan feuds over back-to-work programs,
Social Security, immigration law changes, the bankruptcy sys
tem and other issues unresolved by the last Congress.
fhe first bill introduced in the House yesterday was the Equal
Rights Amendment, which died last year when it failed to win the
necessary approval of three-fourths of the states. Beginning the
process all over again, supporters vowed to carry it through both
houses of Congress again and to continue fighting for approval
in the 38 necessary states.
The ERA, which guarantees women equal rights with men un
der the Constitution, won approval in both houses and in 35
states before expiring last June.
House members were sworn in as their small children
squirmed at their sides, admitted to the normally exclusive
House floor for the traditional first-day ceremonies. Freshman
Rep. Mel Levine(D-Calif.) rushed his 18-month-oldson, Adam,
out the door after he spilled a glass of milk during House Speaker
Tip O'Neill's welcoming speech, but seven-day old Alice Dew
ine, daughter of newcomer Rep. Michael Dewine (R-Ohio) slept
peacefully in her older sister's arms.
House and Senate leaders both agreed that the economy
would be the new Congress' first priority. "The first job has to be
to get the economy moving," said Senate Majority Leader How
ard Baker (R-Tenn.) at a press conference.
Warsaw Pact meets in Prague
Prague — Meeting for the first time under the leadership of
Yuri Andropov, the Soviet bloc opens a delayed biennial summit
meeting of the Warsaw Pact in Prague yesterday.
Although the agenda was not made public, there were strong
indications that the other East European leaders would give for
mal approval to the new Soviet Communist Party chiefs pro
posal for a nuclear arms freeze in Europe and would discuss the
bloc's economic problems.
Western diplomats and East European sources said they ex
pected few if anv new initiatives. But they cautioned against dis

counting its importance.
"The leadership change in Moscow came at a time of econom
ic crisis, at a time when a lot of this is coming to a head," said one
Westerner. "These people are bound to be thinking, 'What is my
role? What is inv status?" "
The partv chiefs from the other six countries all had arrived or
were en route last night to join Gustav Husak of Czechoslovakia.
They included Andropov, Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski of Poland,
President Nicolae Ceausescu of Romania, Janos Kadar of Hun
gary, Todor Zhivkov of Bulgaria and Erich Honecker of East
Germany.
Andropov met in Moscow with the others at the funeral of
President Leonid Brezhnev in November and the celebration in
December of the 60th anniversary of the Soviet Union. But this is
his first formal conference with them as the leader of the Soviet
party as well as his first trip abroad since his elevation.
The Slovak vouth newspaper Smena reported the meeting of
the Warsaw Pact Consultative Committee would also focus on
worsening relations with the West, including U.S. restrictions on
trade and technology exports.
Mondale, Askew enter Democratic race
Washington — Former Vice President Walter Mondale, front
runner in the polls for the Democratic presidential nomination in
19X4, and Former Gov. Reubin Askew of Florida became the
second and third candidates yesterday to file officially for the
race.
Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.), notified the Federal Election
Commission last Nov. 19 of his candidacy. In the interim. Sen.
Gary Hart (D-Colo.) informed the commission of fund-raising
activity conducted toward a possible presidential bid but he has
not filed as a candidate.
Registration with the federal agency is required to secure
matching federal funds for those given by contributors.
A letter carried to the commission office by a Mondale cam
paign worker designated the Mondale for President Committee
as his principal campaign agency, with an address in northwest
Washington, D.C.
Maxine Isaacs, Mondale's press spokesman, said campaign
officials will be named later this week. She said Mondale will
make a formal announcement of his candidacy in about two
months.
The former vice president made the rounds on Capitol Hill
yesterday, greeting new and returning lawmakers as the 98th
Congress convened. He spoke briefly at a reception gaiven by
Sen. Frank Lautenberg (D-N.J.) for whom Mondale had made
campaign appearances. Mondale also welcomed a former mem
ber of his vice presidential staff, Rep. Robert Toricelli (D-N.J.)
another congressional newcomer.
Mondale's prospects were enhanced when Sen. Edward Ken
nedy (D-Mass.) withdrew from the Democratic race, because
both men appealed to organized labor and the more liberal vot
ers in their party. Kennedy has given no public indication of his
choice for the nomination.
Israel, PLO bargain for prisoner release
Jerusalem — Foreign Minister Yitzhak Shamir confirmed yes
terday that Israel is engaged in direct negotiations with the
Palestine Liberation Organization in an effort to secure the re
lease of soldiers taken prisoner during the war in Lebanon, Israel
Radio reported.
Shamir spoke to a closed session of Parliament's Defense and
Foreign Affairs Committee. The state-operated radio network
broadcast a leaked version of his comments.
"We see this matter in the light of Jewish tradition," the radio
quoted Shamir as saving. "In Jewish law the redemption of pris
oners from captivity is of the first importance.
"Israel is not choosy regarding measures to ensure this aim
und is taking steps it rejects politically." the foreign minister was
quoted as having said.
Israel has steadfastly refused to engage in any contact with the
PLO, which it considers a terrorist organization determined to
eliminate the Jewish state. At Israeli urging, the United States
also has adopted a policy against direct dealing with the PLO.
However, Abdullah Franji, the PLO representative in Vienna
and Bonn, said last week that the PLO was holding talks on a
prisoner exchange with Arie Eliav, the former secretary-general
of Israel's opposition Labor Party.
Eliav has refused to discuss the matter.
Shamir did not confirm the details of the reported Franji-Eliav
contact. In fact, according to Israel Radio, the foreign minister
said manv reports about the talks had been incorrect. He refused
to supply anv details.
"As long as there are no concrete results, I will not disclose
anything," Shamir was quoted as saying.
EPA to battle charge of contempt
Washington — The Environmental Protection Agency is pre
paring to hire private lawyers at a cost of up to $70,000 to help
defend Administrator Anne Gorsuch against a contempt-of-
Congress charge lodged last month by the House.
FPA officials said yesterday that they need the outside advice
even though the Justice Department, not the EPA, is charged by

law with representing Gorsuch and has assigned a team of law
yers to the historic ease.
" This is not an indication that we have lost confidence in the
Justice Department," said a senior EPA official. "We just very
simply wanted to have available to us a kind of constitutional
expertise that frankly we don't have here on our staff."
The official said the agencv plans to sign a contract soon with
two lawyers from the Boston firm of Ropes and Gray to act as
consultants on constitutional and procedural issues in the case.
The two men will advise EPA's lawyers, who in turn are confer
ring with Justice at each stage of the proceedings.
Justice Department officials declined to comment on their re
action to EPA's move except to say they had nothing to do with
it. Fhev also predicted that the outside advice would have little
influence on their handling of the case.
"It's their (EPA's) money, and their choice in how they spend
it." said a department official. "But I don't think it will have
much effect on us."
The proceedings against Gorsuch mark the first time that the
lull House has charged a Cabinet-level official with contempt of
Congress for refusing to comply with a subpoena.
Gorsuch, acting under orders from President Reagan, refused
to turn over documents on her agency's prosecution of com
panies responsible for the nation's most dangerous hazardous
waste dumps.
ERA introduced as first bill of year
Washington— Backers of the failed Equal Rights Amendment
are starting again from scratch, re-introducing the measure as
the first bill of the 98th Congress.
"We must not permit the fires to cool for despite much
progress on women's issues, women today still suffer from dis
crimination in employment, education, pensions, and many oth
er areas," Rep. Peter Rodino (D-N.J.) said yesterday.
The proposed amendment, which would prohibit discrimina
tion on the basis of sex, was passed by Congress in 1972 with a
seven-year deadline for three-fourths of the state legislatures to
ratify it.
Congress granted a two-year extension in 1978, but only 35
states had ratified when that time ran out last June 30, three
states short of the necessary 38.
Rodino, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, said the
measure has 221 co-sponsors in the House, 190 of them Demo
crats. "It is a priority item of business for the Judiciary Commit
tee and we plan to go full-steam ahead," he said at a news con
ference.
Rep. Patricia Schroeder (D-Colo.) one of the co-sponsors,
said, "Our biggest problem is the Senate — whether we can get
the necessary two-thirds vote there."
Reagan names MX advisory panel

strategic forces.
The panel includes former Secretary of State Alexander Haig,
a retired four-star general; former Carter administration De
fense Secretary Harold Brown; Texas Gov. William Clements, a

forces during its organizational meeting in the Cabinet Room at
the White House.
Brent Scowcroft, former national security affairs adviser to
President Gerald Ford and chairman of the commission, said it
faced a hard task in recommending a basing system for the nucle
ar weapon.
"Whatever we may come up is unlikely to meet with the unani
mous approval of everyone in the country, in the Congress, or
whatever," Scowcroft told reporters in the White House drive
way.
Reagan sa vs he will not be bound by recommendations of the
group, if they are at odds with the views of "our own military
people who are going to have to use these weapons if they're ever
used."

Gov. Deukmejian, McCarthy sworn in
Sacramento — Promising a new era of common sense and bipartisanship
in the state Capitol, Republican George Deukmejian became California's
35th governor yesterday, ending eight colorful and controversial years of
Democrat Jerry Brown.
The former state legislator and attorney general repeated his intention to
cut state spending rather than raise taxes, but he clearly left the door open to
support a temporary tax increase to meet a projected 51.6 billion deficit in
the state budget.
In his first official action following the inaugural ceremonies, Deukmejian
ordered a 2 percent cutback in budgets of every division of state government
except a handful of departments such as prisons, hospitals and revenue-pro
ducing agencies such the Franchise Tax Board.
That executive order also imposed a freeze on employee promotions or
new hirings, contracts, out-of-state travel by state employees and major
equipment purchases. Aides said $70 million could be saved by the cutbacks.
Democrat Leo McCarthy was sworn in yesterday as California's 43rd lieu
