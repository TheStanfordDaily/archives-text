## Altman comes back with ‘Jimmy Dean’ 
### STEVE VINEBERG 
In the past year, filmmakers
have paid closer attention to act
ing, perhaps, than at any other
time in movie history. Improvi
sation, introduced into film by
the New Wave directors in the
late '50s and early '60s and highly
touted by Bertolucci and Robert
Altman in the early '70s, has at
tained wider employment than it
has ever had: at least eight recent
pictures — Shoot the Moon,
Quest for Fire, Personal Best,
One from the Heart, Diner, E.T.,
Tempest and Altman's new
Come Back to the 5 and Dime,
Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean -
show clear signs of having
worked through an improvisat
ory stage. The purpose of impro
visation is twofold: to find an
emotional center within an actor
that will feed the character he is
playing — flesh it out; and to
reach a level of contact between
actors that will spark meaningful
and imaginative interchange be
tween them. Because this pro
cess has so much in common with
various forms of group therapy,
it tends to liberate actors in per
sonal ways and when they talk
about it afterwards, it may sound
like self-indulgence — particu
larly if we don't feel the same joy
when we watch their perfor
mances. This discrepancy occur

red in some of the movies
Altman made between Nashville
and Jimmy Dean. A Wedding,
for example, may have excited
the actors involved in it, but to
those of us who hadn't spent time
on the set, the acting had a dis
tressingly in-house quality; it
closed us off.
When improvisation goes
sour, the result is usually some
thing like a John Cassavetes
movie; when it triumphs, the re
sult may be Come Back to the 5
and Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimm v
Dean. Good actors will tell you
that they would never think of
approaching Chekhov without
hours and hours of improv, be
cause Chekhov's plays imply
layers of unspoken or barely
spoken emotional turmoil —
what an actor calls "subtext" —
and just reading the lines for
their surface value will not exp
lain how the characters function.
When you see Vanessa Red
grave or Blythe Danner as Nina
in The Sea Gull, half a dozen of
these levels are illuminated at
once and you understand not
only how the characters operate
but also how the play does —
from the interplay between
characters who, because they
shift from one level to another
without warning, are rarely on
the same wavelength. Robert

Altman and the three actresses
who star in Jimmy Dean —
Sandy Dennis. Cher and Karen
Black — prepared for this movie
as though they had signed to film
a production of Chekhov's Three
Sisters, with its time-baked strata
of guilt and rancor, illusion and
unrequited love, its surprise mo
ments of reconciliation and
awful years of broken connec
tions between people. And when
the picture is over you may feel
that under Altman's hand these
women could pull off even Three
Sisters, but that it would hardly
be necessary. Ed Graczyk's play
(which Altman directed in New
York last winter with the same
cast and then filmed in 19
days) is schematic and emblema
tic, full of tiny echoes of Tennes
see Williams' plays and those of
other Southern Gothic writers,
as well as Eugene O'Neill's The
Iceman Cometh, but it's impossi
ble to imagine that it could have
been bettei acted or directed if it
had been Chekhov.
The play is set in a tiny Texas
town in 1955 and 1975, and
there is a single set: a Wool
worth's run by good-natured,
rigidly Fundamentalist Juanita
(Sudie Bond), and in the '50s
scenes, her unseen alcoholic
husband Sidney. In 1975, Juani
ta's two employees, Mona
(Sandy Dennis) and Sissy
(Cher), who began working for
her as high school kids, are de
corating the store for a 20th
anniversary reunion of their
teenage fan club, The Disciples
of James Dean, which broke up
shortly after the announcement
of the movie star's death in 1955.
Three women arrive to partici
pate in the celebration: hefty,
brass-lunged Stella Mae (Kathy
Bates); mousy Edna Louise
(Marta Heflin), pregnant for the
seventh time; and an elegant,
mysterious stranger named
Joanne (Karen Black) who
drives a Porsche and seems eerily
familiar to Mona. Throughout
the film, Altman employs the
full-length wall mirror behind
the shop counter as a flashback
device that transforms the image
of the grown women into their
adolescent counterparts, back in
the days when Sissy was dating
the most popular boy in town,
Lester T. (also unseen), and she
and Mona shared secrets with
Joe (Mark Patton). During the

summer and fall of 1955. all that
is most crucial in the lives of
Mona and Joe occurs: they travel
to Martha, Texas to appear as
extras with James Dean inGianf,
Mona rejects Joe's love in favor
of a fantasy of having slept with
Dean — she claims the child she
bears months later is the result of
a one-night stand with him —
and Joe, long despised by the
town for his effeminacy, is
beaten up and gang-raped. By
the time we have seen several of
the flashback sequences, we
have guessed Joanne's true iden
tity.
If you read a script of Grac
zyk's play, the agoni/ed revelat
ory structure would probably
make you choke with laughter,
and the stilted, purplish dialogue
("I really had to dig among the
piles of destruction to come up
with one that had the slightest
hint of recognition") would
sound like the strivings of a
third-rate playwright to imitate
A Streetcar Named Desire. But
Altman's mirror dcvice, which
lends the movie an odd, indis
tinct status — neither play nor
movie, but somehow a mixture
of the two — works magically,
and when Sandy Dennis reads
Graczyk's lines, they sound like
poetry. Dennis, who made her

film debut in a small role in
Splendor in the Grass in 1961
and won an Acadcmy Award for
her second movie. Who's Afraid
of Virginia Wool/? five years la

ter, is Actors' Studio-trained —
her early successes were on the
New York stage, in A Thousand
Clowns and Any Wednesday —
and so (like Geraldine Page)
when she's bad she's bad in an
inward, neurotic way. Few of her
movie appearances have been
even tolerable because she tends
to rely on a repertoire of tics.
(The last time I liked her was in
the Watergate satire Nasty
Habits in 1977, when she
parodied herself.) At first glance
Mona may seem like the ar
chetypal Sandy Dennis role, but
she gets so far inside it that what
came across in her other films as
annoying mannerisms work for
her here — an irregular stutter,
sudden, inappropriate giggling, a
childish, mocking descent into
basso profundo. Her chin sags so
low that her mouth looks like an
immense open wound, and her
tongue stretches past her upper
lip as if it were trying desperately
to uproot itself. Each piece of
business exposes a corner of
Mona's personality, which is
deeply disturbed, but in a beauti
ful, dreamy, complex way, like
Alma in Tennessee Williams'
Eccentricities of a Nightingale as
Blythe Danner portrayed her on
TV or Piper Laurie's evangelical
mother in Carrie. Dennis plays
Mona as a series of displaced
parts — girlish, pain-wracked,
autocratic, matter-of-fact, in
dignant (in a schoolmarmish
way) — each phase disconnect
ing as she passes on to the next as
if she were playing emotional
hopscotch on the shards of half a
dozen shattered personalities.
It's a great performance, I
think. The cuts between the
teenage Mona and Mona in her
late 30s shock us because in the
young scenes her eyes are the
only part of her face betraying
the cloudy burden of her fan
tasizing, and in the older scenes
her whole face seems to be cav
ing in — and her voice gets
cracked and breathy when Mona
feels exhausted. (I don't know
how she managed to register
decay in her face without the
crutch of make-up; it's an acting
feat, like some of Diane
Keaton's close-ups in Shoot the
Moon.) Graczyk has written the
role as a series of high points, like
Blanche in Streetcar, and Dennis
finds a fresh approach to each
one. When eighteen-year-old

Mona hears that her idol, James
Dean, will be on location in
nearby Martha, she freezes, sit
ting very still except for her head,
which rises and dips as if she had
no control over it. When she
learns of Dean's death, her eyes
retreat (like doped-up Katharine
Hepburn's in the final scene of
Long Day's Journey into Night)
— almost imperceptibly at first,
but we realize that Mona has
placed herself indisputably at a
remove from the rest of the
world. And her recitation, dur
ing the reunion, of the story of
her encounter with Dean has the
quality of ritual — thoroughly
rehearsed but full of the joy of
anticipation. Everyone in the
room has heard it a thousand
times, but they can't help sharing
in her mesmerized delight in re
living it; watching Dennis play
this scene, I kept thinking of the
moment in The Glass Menagerie
when Amanda sails into her girl
hood memories or the south and
Laura whispers to her disgrun
tled brother, "Let her tell it. She
loves to tell it."
Karen Black is another actress
whose performances tend to re
peat, but whenever Robert

Altman directs her (the last time
was in Nashville) he sounds
depths that no other director
seems to suspect. I admired John
Lithgow's depiction of a trans
sexual in The World According
to Garp, but Black's perfor
mance is different — spookier
and informed with almost un
bearable pain, like a Carson
McCullers character. Her voice
floats above her body as if they
didn't belong together, and she
walks with cautious feminine
grace. In her first entrance, her
anguish and disgust at returning
to the scene of so much adoles
cent torment are carefully dusted
with this self-conscious ele
gance; she seems to be tiptoeing
through a nightmare and using
all her energy to insulate herself.
(Altman achieves a miraculous
balance in this scene between
Mona's made-up world and the
real world Joanne drags into the
five and dime, where the horrors
of one's years bear visible fruit.
Mona's changes are all internal,
because she has struggled to deny
the passage of time.) But once
Joanne reveals herself to the
other Disciples, she loses her
