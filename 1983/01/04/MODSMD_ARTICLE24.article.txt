Call it progress.
Since their first U.S. re
leased LP, Light as a Feather,
the Brazilian jazz/fusion trio
called Azymuth has done no
thing but improve. Although
many may find it hard for
them to better Telecommuni
cations, a Top 10 album on
the U.S. jazz charts a year ago
and the No. 1 imported LP in
England for 12 weeks,
Azymuth has done it.
What Azymuth has done is
discover the perfect blend of
their Latin influences and
American fusion. They have
put it together in a solid,
seven-song album called Cas
cades, the group's fourth U.S.
released LP (three others
were released only in Brazil).
It is an album that could be
impossible to top; however,
just equalling it would be suf
ficient.
All seven tracks of Cas
cades are vintage Azymuth
tunes, none of them ever giv
ing the listener second
thoughts about skipping to
the next song, a problem with
past Azymuth LPs. The
group's last three albums
have contained songs to the
liking of the American fusion
listener and tunes that
pleased the Brazilian samba
fan. No longer.
Cascades combines these
two elements in each song,
making the entire album lis
tenable. There is no hit song,
but each tune has its own re
deeming qualities. It's the
type of situation where one
song will be a favorite one
day, and then another the
next.
One noticeable difference
between the latest product
from Azymuth and their past
LPs is a cohesive, more pro
nounced bassline. However,
the backbeat of the trio's
songs still contains the
dynamic qualities of past al
bums. American influence at
the production level seems to
be responsible for this

change.
The most interesting aspect
of Azymuth is their ability to
make their music appear sim
ple at first listening — almost
too simple — and then reveal
each song's inherent com
plexities during additional lis
tenings. As a result, Cascades
has the enticing effect of lur
ing one to spinning it over and
over again. And one can feel
safe playing it continuously,
as one doesn't have to fear
hearing any "bad" songs —
all seven are excellent.
Cascades begins with
"Club Moracco,' a song writ
ten about a Brazilian whore
house the band stumbled into
during a recent tour. Like six
of the seven tracks, "Club
Moracco" is of medium
speed. Only the last
tune, "Indian Pepper," fea
tures the upbeat, funky beat
of a few songs on past LPs.
The band itself has an in
teresting history. Keyboardist
Jose Bertrami started his
career in Sao Paulo, Brazil,
and put in time with Brazilian
stars Flora Purim and Airto.
Bertrami met up with drum
mer Ivan Conti in the early
1970s in Rio de Janeiro after
Flora and Airto took their ta
lents to New York City.
Bertrami and Conti found
the group's bassist, Alex
Malheiros, in a bowling alley.
Malheiros comes from a fam
ily that makes customized
electric basses and accord
ingly plays one.
Azymuth's first album was
recorded in 1973 and was the
soundtrack for a Brazilian
movie. After putting in hours
of session time on samba re
cordings and releasing a few
more albums, the trio played
in the Montreaux Jazz Festi
val in 1977. The next year,
Azymuth backed Flora and
Airto on their tour; it wasn't
until 1979 that they estab
lished their affiliation with
Milestone Records in Ber
keley.
The group appeared in

concert in San Francisco last
fall for the first time and, al
though they weren't accus
tomed to playing before an
American audience, they per
formed well under the condi
tions.
As stated on the album
cover. Cascade "is dedicated
to the Cascade of the Seven
Waterfalls, one of the won
ders of the world which has, in

the name of progress, ceased
to exist." The band is refer
ring to the magnificent water
fall on the Brazil/Paraguay
border which was recently de
stroyed to make room for a
new dam and hydro electric
facility.
Cascade the album, how
ever, is in no way threatened
by outside forces. Although it

may not sell as well as Tele
communications did in the
early months, it will catch on.
Because of the strengths of all
seven songs, the LP will have
problems riding on the popu
larity of one or two hit tunes.
Regardless, the overall excel
lence of the LP eventually
should be reflected in the
sales charts. Just give it time
and let it progress.
