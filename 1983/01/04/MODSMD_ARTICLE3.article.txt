# Suites open; move- in proceeds smoothly
## 
### KAREN SPRINGEN 
There were a few minor problems, but the 260
new residents of the four Governor's Corner suite
houses moved in as scheduled during the past two
days.
According to Jan Van Houten, director of Gov
ernor's Corner, the winter quarter move-in is pro
ceeding smoothly. The four eating clubs and the
four suite houses, including 50 suites, opened as
planned.
Rudolph and Sletten Construction Co., which
also won the contract for the Peter Coutts faculty
housing project, stepped up construction over
vacation to prepare the suites for Jan. 2 occupan
cy. "It was like a beehive of activity out here
Christmas break," Van Houten said.
Elizabeth Kittas, facilities project manager,
said the timing of the move into the three Inde
pendent houses in September "was a lot tighter"
and involved overtime.
Although Governor's Corner received a
certificate of occupancy, not all construction has
been completed, according to Jason Mavis, direc
tor of facilities and services. "There will be things
going on in those buildings for months," he said.
The major construction of the suites, completed
on schedule and under budget, was "extremely
successful ... There have been relatively minor
problems," Mavis said.
Problems are covered under the one-year war
ranty of the contract, Mavis said.
Small problems yesterday included lack of
some shower curtains and room curtains and lack
of heat in the first floor of Anderson house. In ad
dition, a water pipe broke in the Bollard eating
club yesterday, and rented chairs are being used in
the Avanti eating club until the intended chairs ar
rive within a a few weeks.
In addition, landscaping is as yet incomplete,
leading several suite residents to mention the mud
and construction outside their houses. Governor's
Corner landscaping will be completed by August,
Kittas said. Currently, the landscaping is com
plete outside the Independent houses and the pro
gram center. Scarlet oaks have been planted along
Governor's Avenue.
"It's not 100 percent," Van Houten said.
Storage problems were minimal, she said. In

coming residents stored their belongings at the
Governor's Corner program center. The Gov
ernor's Corner office provided students with
trucks and hand-carts to help them move in.
The most common reaction from incoming resi
dents — 250 of whom lived in Manzanita trailer
park fall quarter — was "you've got to be kidding,
this is fantastic," according to Van Houten.
Junior Cathy Conlev said, "They're beautiful.
But then we've been in trailers." The suites, unlike
the trailers, have "no ants, no water spots," she
said.
Sophomore Laura Riggs said, "It's gorgeous."
She added, "The one thing that's sort of hard is
having to come here (to the eating club) for
meals."
Residents received eating club assignments ac
cording to the floor on which they lived. This non
selective system promotes inter-house com
munication, Van Houten said. "There is the
potential for some students to isolate themselves,"
she said.
Van Houten described the suites as being de
signed like apartments. All rooms are carpeted
and all residents have their own bedrooms.
"You need to think of these as self-operated
houses," Van Houten said.
Kittas said, "It (the suite set-up) is an East
Coast model. The idea has not really been used on
the West Coast." Because of the privacy involved,
"it seemed it would be attractive to up
perclassmen," she added.
Similar to members of the Toyon eating clubs
and the residents of the Cowell Cluster, suite in
habitants pick a meal plan and pay board fees to
the club rather than directly to the University.
Students selected the names of the four eating
clubs — Bollard, Middle Earth, Beef-eater and
Avanti. Avanti has a French/Italian interior de
sign theme.
Suites vary by size and color. "We've tried to
give it some variation," Van Houten said. Suites
include four color schemes and occupancy per
suite varies from four to six to eight residents.
Only two suites, however, have eight residents.
Governor's Corner will ultimately consist of
three Independent houses, four suite houses and
Sterling Quad. The three Independent houses,

housing 180 students, opened fall quarter, and
Sterling Quad, housing 360 students, is set to open
this fall.
Sterling Quad will be a Lagunita-style dorm
with a dining lounge designed for performances.
Van Houten said.
Workers broke ground on Governor's Corner

last fall, beginning the five-phase construction
plan for the $36 million project, Mavis said.
The first three phases — the completion of the
Independent houses, the program center and the
suites — are finished. The two remaining phases
are the Sterling Quad and the landscaping.

SUITE DREAMS?: Sophomore Suzy Forman, knee-deep in clothes, looks askance at the
jumble of belongings piled in her new room in the Governor's Corner suites. Forman and 259
others have moved into the luxurious new residences in the past two days.
The program center, a major phase of
Governor's Corner construction, in
cludes four guest rooms, a night-time
coordinator's apartment and a guest
in-residence house. Van Houten said.
According to Bob Nerrie, manager of
University projects, the program centcr
includes two multi-purpose rooms,
storage facilities, a demonstration
kitchen, a photo dark room, music
practice rooms and a snack bar. The
snack bar is designed to be student-run,
he said.
Six dial-in terminals should be in
stalled next week, Van Houten said.
Although most of the 260 suite resi
dents lived in the trailers last quarter,
about ten of them were late assignees,
Van Houten said. New residents spring
quarter will be assigned from the wait
list.
