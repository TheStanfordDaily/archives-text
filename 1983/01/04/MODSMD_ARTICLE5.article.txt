# Freedman backers bitter over tenure denial

### JOAN O'CONNELL 
Supporters of Asst. History Prof.
Estelle Freedman, who has twice been
denied tenure despite a special review
bv the Committee on Appointments
and Promotions (CAP), are bitterly de
nouncing the CAP decision and fore
casting a rough, possibly dead-end road
ahead for the Feminist Studies Program
she helped pioneer.
Law School Prof. Barbara Babcock
is chairing a support committee com
posed of an impressive array of Stan
ford faculty and several graduate stu
dents. Babcock said yesterday that she
plans to support Freedman's internal
grievance appeals which will lav the
burden on Provost Albert Hastorf and
University President Donald Kennedy,
both of whom have the power to over
turn the CAP decision. If those appeals
prove unsuccessful, however, Babcock
said the committee is also prepared to
pursue a lawsuit.
Yesterday, elaborating on the com
mittee's three-part protests which in
clude CAP's determination of Freed
man's merits, affirmative action con
cerns and the future of the Feminist
Studies Program here, Babcock called
the decision "a great injustice" and said
she believes it to be a clear case of sex
discrimmination.
"I believe her merits (as a scholar)
can stand alone although I have a hard
time speaking to that because I'm not
an historian," said Babcock.
When it comes to the affirmative ac

tion issue, however, Babcock argued, "I
don't know what it means if it doesn't
work in a close case."
According to Babcock, a former as
sistant attorney general in the civil
rights division of the Department of
Justice, the tenure policy states that
either a person's teaching or research
has to be excellent and the other has to
be very good. "There's no way they can
deny that her teaching is excellent," she
said of Freedman, who is a former win
ner of the Dinkelspiel award. Babcock
added that in cases where the decision is
close — and she noted that Freedman's
research must at very least be near
"very good" — "it seems to me that in
that situation you have to take af
firmative action into account."
The committee includes such individ
uals as English Prof. Johr. Felstiner,
Carol Jacklin, senior research fellow in
the Psychology Dept., Committee for
Research on Women director Myra
Strober, English Prof, and Chairman of
Feminist Studies Anne Mellor and Al
bert Camarillo, associate professor of
history. "Some people think that it is a
very bad decision on the merits and oth
ers think if she had not spent the burden
of her work on feminist studies, then
she would have been better regarded.
And that is sex discrimination," Bab
cock said. Another support committee
member, visiting Assoc. Sociology
Prof. Barrie Thome, said she believes
denying tenure to Freedman demon
strates "how thin resources are and how

ambivalently committed the adminis
tration is to Feminist Studies."
Thome, who first became acquainted
with Freedman's work in 1978 when she
sat on a board to choose the winner of
the University of Michigan Press' Ham
ilton Award — which was awarded to
Freedman for her book Their Sister's
Keepers: Women's Prison Reform in
America, 1830-1930 — said that, clear
ly, the CAP "does not understand what
she's up to and what kind of break
throughs her work represents to wom
en's studies scholarship."
"I happen to be present on campus,
but believe me I'd be involved (in sup
porting Freedman) even if I wasn't,"
Thome added.
The support committee, which Bab
cock says is operating with Freedman's
full support and encouragement, does
not represent the breadth of support
which the case has attracted. Thorne
said her colleagues who are involved in
feminist studies across the country have
an eye to this case, and noted that the
support committee's letters soliciting
funds have already been met with some
responses, although she declined to
elaborate on the amount of money
raised to date.
Even before the CAP met on its rare
review of its spring tenure denial de
cision this fall. History Prof. Carl
Degler headed a special committee of
History Department faculty which put
together a file of material in support of
Freedman. The material praised her

scholarship and included letters from
outside experts. The CAP refused to
consider the evidence because it had not
been properly solicited.
Degler once again strongly endorsed
a tenured appointment for Freedman,
but called chances for a reversal by
Hastorf or Kennedy "not very good. I
had hopes that the second time around
there would have been a reversal by the
dean's office, but they seem to have not
been moved in the slightest.
"I think it's hard for a dean to be ov
erturned, but don't misunderstand me
— I think the case is very good."
Unlike Babcock, however, Degler
said, "I don't think it's sex discrimina
tion as such. Four or five women were
