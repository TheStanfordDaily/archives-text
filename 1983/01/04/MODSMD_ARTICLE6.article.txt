## The 						MBAs: a band singing the virtues of capitalism 
### JENNIFER SEYMOUR 
In the '60s it was acid rock.
In the 70s, punk rock. And
the' Bos?
"We like to think it will be
'a piece of the rock,' " said
Holden Gaines, a 1982 Stan
ford graduate and lead
guitarist for the MBAs, a
pro-business rock and roll
band. "Most bands sing about
life when the chips are down.
The MBAs sing about life
when the chips are blue. It re
ally makes for a happier al
bum."
Happier, indeed. The
MBAs' new album, Born to
Run Things, is a humorous
look at business as seen
through the eyes of a "four
piece band in three-piece
suits."

The four band members
met here as undergraduates
while working for the
Chaparral. When the band's
two elder members, Manny
Hanover (lead vocalist, Gass
of 1978) and T. Bill Raitt
(drummer, '78) went off to
Harvard Business School,
Gaines stayed behind with
bass player Franklin Mint
('81), and the two penned a
love ballad to Bethlehem
Steel called "Bessy" (the
company's nickname). That's
when things started to hap
pen.
"The Wall Street Journal
heard about the song," Mint
said. "They asked me,' Why a

love song to a corporation?'
and I said,' If a man can love a
woman or a country, why not
a multinational integrated
steel and iron company?' Two
weeks later, we were on the
front page."
The Wall Street Journal re
ceived many calls asking
where an MBAs album could
be purchased, but there was
no album. The boys discussed
making a single of "Bessy"
with an independent pro
ducer. He told » K ?m that
hundreds ot singles were re
leased each week, and the

The Wall Street
Journal heard
about the song.
They asked me,
'Why a love song
to a corporation?'
and / said, 'If a
man can love a
woman or a coun
try, why not a
multi-national in
tegrated steel and
iron companyT
Two weeks later,
we were on the
front page.

chance for getting a single
sold was slim.
"So we did what any sane,
red-blooded Stanford stu
dents would do," Gaines said.
"We wrote nine more songs
and made an album."
Almost instantaneously,
the album attracted attention
from the curious media; to
date. Vogue, Institutional In
vestor, Esquire and The Chris
tian Science Monitor have run

articles on the MBAs. People
and Newsweek are also plan
ning coverage of the band and
its release. Born to Run
Things. And bookstores from
east to west, including Stan
ford's, are selling the album.
Born to Run Things has
music for everyone — rock,
country, gospel, rap and
reggae. The album cover
shows the band jumping off
the pages of what looks like
the Wall Street Journal, and
!i«in « inight red sticker which
proclaims "CONTAINS
THEIR HIT SINGLE!" A
hit single?
"As soon as we know what
it is, you'll know what it is,"
said Gaines, trying to hide a
smile.
Only providence will tell
whether any of the songs from
Born to Run Things will be
come hits. But the songs do
provide laughs, as in the
MBAs' answer to "Take this
Job and Shove it." This coun
try song called "Take this
Pink Slip and Beat It (You
Don't Work Here Any
more)" has these words: You
tell me that you plain don't
like this job /You tell me that
you're tired. /You tell me
you'll be needing more time
off, /You've got it pal, you're
fired.
There's also a dance song
called " Do it on the Floor," a
gospel song called Jesus H.
Chrysler, and a folksong
about the Carter administra
tion's economic policies, cal
led "Good Old Boys Raising
Keynes," among others. And,
of course, an MBA Theme
("We like to eat out and drive
fast cars / We take our dates to
expensive bars...")
Both the album and cas
sette come with complete
lyrics. "Only us and Springs
teen — the only two in the
business who print lyrics on
the cassette," Mint said

proudly.
When they're not making
music, the MBAs spend their
time at professional jobs.
Hanover works at a Wall
Street investment bank;
Raitt, at a Los Angeles pub
lishing company. Mint is an
institutional investor and



Gaines is a writer for a major
advertising agency.
When asked why they
aren't using their real r.ames
on the album. Mint was quick
to reply: "At our firms, they
fire people for doing things
like this."
