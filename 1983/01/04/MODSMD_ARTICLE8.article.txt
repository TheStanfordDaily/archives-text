# Volunteers for Youth gives athletes chance to help kids
## 
### KAREN SPRINGEN 
Many student athletes do more than spend hours
per day training and studying. In fact about 80
athletes here serve as big brothers or big sisters to
local junior high school students.
The Volunteers for Youth Program (VFY),
sponsored by the National Collegiate Athletic As
sociation (NCAA), utilizes athletes here as friends
and role models for local junior high school stu
dents.
Carl Howell, national director of VFY, said:
"It's for kids that are having a tough time growing
up ... to provide these kids with a positive adult
role model." He added, "The program does
work."
Junior Geoff Bland, a student director, said VFY
is similar to the Big Brother program but works
specifically with athletes and uses female as well as
male volunteers.
Seven student program directors recruit sixth,
seventh and eighth graders through junior high
school counselors, who look for kids with low self
esteem rather than for "problem kids," Bland said.
"They come from all socioeconomic
backgrounds," he added.
Katy Dore, coordinating director of Volunteers
for Youth, said counselors may also recommend
students who are having trouble relating to friends
or who live in broken homes and need a male role
model.
Chris Avery, Class of '74, one of two Stanford
students who started the program in 1969, con
ceived the idea for the program when Stan
Fischman, former director of psychology at the
Children's Hospital, noted an improvement in
terminally ill children when he brought a football
player to visit them. Avery said they realized the
"untapped wealth of college athletes."
Student athletes benefit from the program as
much as the youth and sometimes change their
career plans to include some social work, Avery
said. "This is really a humanizing influence," he
said.
The program began to expand to other schools
around 1975. "We saw how well it was working at
Stanford, and we thought 'why just Stanford?' "

Avery said.
But the program needed framework and struc
ture, and so it attracted NCAA sponsorship in
1977. More than 50 schools, including Cornell,
Dartmouth, Harvard, Northwestern and Yale, now
use the program.
Because of the NCAA sponsorship, program di
rectors mainly try to get athletes as volunteers. In
the beginning of the year they talk to teams and
clubs, ranging from women's crew to baseball to
fencing. "We try to get them as freshmen or
sophomores," Bland said.
The program here includes 80 athlete-student
pairs â€” an ideal size from an organizational
standpoint, Bland said. Most schools have smaller
programs.

Chris Avery, Class of' 74, one of
two Stanford students who
started the program in 1969,
conceived the idea for the prog
ram when Stan Fischman 112
former director of psychology at
the Children?s Hospital, noted
an improvement in terminally
ill children when he brought a
football player to visit them.

The largest number of volunteers are football
players, Bland said, "probably because there are
more football players than anything else."
Volunteers include football players Mike Dot
terer and Kevin Bates, swimmer Kim Carlisle, de
cathlete Michael Heiss and basketball player Meg
Metzger.
Pairs develop their friendship through everyday
activities that do not detract from athletes' sports
or study time. They average about three hours per
week.
Carlisle and her little sister, Melanie, attend
movies, bowl, go for ice cream or have some in
teraction at least once a week. Carlisle said
Melanie volunteered for the program. "She was
shy and was having trouble adjusting socially," she
said.
Bates said he and his youth, Christopher Lierle,
do a wide range of activities including studying,
playing football and video games, going out to eat
and going into San Francisco.
Lierle received Bates, a fifth-year senior, as his
volunteer five years ago. Fortunately for him, he
said, Bates red-shirted and so has been his big
brother for an extra year. "I'll still probably see
him sometime the rest of my life," he added.
"The first time 1 met him (Bates) 1 was about
four feet tall and he's about 6-4. ... It was kind of
scary," Lierle said. "It's not any more," he added.
The VFY structure is flexible. "What you do is
stricUy up to you . . .It's just real individual." Dure
said. She and her student, for example, bake
cookies, go out for ice cream and go horseback
riding.
Gail Salem, a program adviser whose two chil
dren were little brothers, said the program is highly
effective. "They (her two sons) needed someone to
look up to, and they were sports-oriented. ... I'm
a single parent, so it was really nice for them to
have a male friend." Her oldest son is now a big
brother at the University of California at Davis.
Volunteers and their youth may use free tickets
to sporting events. A reimbursement system also
prevents the program from involving any cost for
the athletes.
"We always have more kids than we can pair,"
Dore said. Although the program is geared toward
student athletes because of its sponsorship by the
NCAA, anyone is welcome to be a volunteer.
