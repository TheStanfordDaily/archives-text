Confused
about the new insured
money-market accounts?
We, at Downey Savings,
want to help you understand them...
and offer you more.
Simply, money-market accounts give you an insured, high interest account with
out tying up your money with term time limits. And, a minimum balance of only
$2,500 is required.
It's that simple. But, we at Downey still don't think it's enough. So we've devel
oped two money-market packages, and you can pick the one tailored to your needs.
Plus, we'll pay you higher than most money-market fund rates with either of them.
