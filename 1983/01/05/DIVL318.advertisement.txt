I PROJECT ON THE ,
ETHNOGRAPHIC MONITORING OF RAPID CHANGE
Offered by Robert B. Textor, Professor of Education
First Meeting: Thursday Evening, January 6 at 7:00 PM, in Cubberley 334
This Project is a regular faculty research undertaking in which a limited number of students
are invited to participate. It will employ an ethnographic (anthropological) approach and
related techniques to the monitoring of very rapid change — especially change that is
technologically induced and that appears likely to impact profoundly on sociocultural sys
tems.
A primary focus, initially, will be upon the Micro-electronic Revolution and its potential for
bringing about rapid changes in the way families live, students learn, people relate to each
other, etc. People will often accept the Revolution in order to resolve one set of problems —
only to find that acceptance creates new problems, which in turn will call for adaptations in
individual behavior, social structures, or cultural values.
Many of these adaptive changes will take considerable time, but it might be possible to
anticipate some of them broadly, through the study of initial impact processes, using the
approach of the ethnographer — which is naturalistic, holistic, participatory, interactive, and
recursive. The process of anticipation can, in turn, lead to programs of an action or educa
tional nature designed to maximize positive results and minimize negative ones, as well as
help develop the means of handling crises.
The EMRC Project is an on-going faculty research undertaking intended to produce a
variety of publications, in which a small inter-disciplinary group of juniors, seniors, and
graduate students will be welcome to paticipate, and to share authorship as appropriate.
Previous social science background or interviewing experience is helpful but not necessary.
Training will be offered in tne design of ethnographic research, and in the conduct of
ethnograhic observations and interviews. Students may work in teams on a common problem
of their choice. For example, one team might choose to identify families or schools where a
microcomputer is about to be introduced, and then trace the initial human impact. Other
students might choose a bio-technical innovation (e.g., a genetic engineering project, an
industrial pollution episode, etc.); others a radical innovation (or collapse) in social or man
agerial structure. Our results will cumulate from year to year in a library archive, so that
gradually we can develop better grounded models of and for rapid change.
The Project will start this quarter under the auspices of Anthro 192/Educ 254, and students
interested in enrolling, or learning more about the Project, should meet with us on Thursday
evening, Jan. 6, at 7:00 P.M., in Cubberley 334. Flexible arrangements can be made as to
credits, completion deadlines, conformity to the requirements of other majors, etc.
Associated with the Project will be Or. Roulette wm. Smith, Visiting Scholar in Education,
and Mr. Megh Thapa and Ms. Diane Hoffman, doctoral candidates in Education.
