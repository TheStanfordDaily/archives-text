## The 						Stanford Daily Frenzied football on the Farm 
### 
Stanford missed the 1983 Rose Bowl by a far
larger margin than the width of a rose bud, but the
great dispenser of all good things decided it would
be appropriate to compensate the University with
the 1985 Super Bowl.
Think of it! The Super Bowl by the bay, frenzied
football fever on the farm â€” a veritable tidal wave
of bucks, booze and bravado will soon pass our
way.
There must be some negative aspect to this un
expected, and profitable, game plan for the Uni
versity's future, but we have trouble spotting it.
The benefits range from a strong public relations
boost in the wake of post-Big Game naysaying to
tangibles such as extensive stadium improvements,
and we welcome all of them.
Super Bowl XIX may be the arena where the
University finally defeats the numerous charges of
"aloof elitism" and "narcissism," accusations
which are frequently hurled at our citadel of cul
ture on the Peninsula. It is one event which brings
together both the elite and the everyman; chabUs
glasses and six-packs can peacefully co-exist in
uncommon aesthetic harmony of Super Bowl Sun
day.
But the University also helps out the

Bay Area by hosting such an event. Numerous
economic and psychological benefits will fall upon
the region: the 72,000 people who will occupy over
30,000 hotel rooms throughout the area. Money
talks, and the region should listen and appreciate
the University's role in the event.
In symbolic terms, however, Stanford's greatest
contribution could be its enhancement of the Bay
Area's pride and identity. No city in America is
more image-conscious than San Francisco: cable
cars, the Golden Gate Bridge, "I Left My Heart in
San Francisco" (crooned for the 10,000 th time by
a super-bored Tony Bennett), and all the cultural
flotsom and jetsam of the Beat Age and the '60s
and the gay consciousness revolution. The struggle
to get the 1984 National Democratic Party Con
vention located in the Gty of Hills is part of this
same image-raising obsession. If the University
can massage this prestige-craving citizenry with
even a single ego-stroke, Baghdad-by-the-Bay will
be forever in our emotional debt.
No matter what happens on the field, the Super
Bowl should assist Stanford's football team with its
recruitment program. Indeed, Super Bowl 1985
may lead to Rose Bowls 1986-9.

furled for the January classic.
