## God and the need for explanations 
### 
The belief in God, whatever the form of God we choose
to talk about, originated in the need for explanations.
Through a long and painful process many of the questions
that the existence and attributes given to God (or gods)
helped to answer, found alternative responses. But some
questions remained with no alternative answer, primarily
those related to the origin of the universe and the role of
human beings in it.
Two basic ideas of God remain today. One is the God of
the "rational" mind: a very undefined force, original
creator, and not much else; something (not someone) not
very clearly defined even in the mind of its believers. The
origin of this idea is twofold: on the one hand thereis a need
to explain, as mentioned before, and on the other the need
to unify and generalize the enormous divergence among the
beliefs that correspond to the second basic idea or group qf
ideas about God. But before we turn to it, let me add a
couple of thoughts on the God of "reason." First of all, this
God does not impose moral obligations and rules of be
havior, which makes "it" a more comfortable idea. Sec
ondly, this belief is not an interested one, in the sense that
there are no rewards to be obtained by it.
The second kind of God is the God of religion. Abstract
ing from all the differences provided by the hundreds of
existing religions, the basic characteristic of this God is his
human-like nature. This "humanized" God is everything
we think to be good and virtuous, to an infinite extent. He
knows everything, is almighty, has infinite intelligence and
is supremely just and compassionate. These "human" attri
butes make it easier for us to establish a personal type of
relationship with him. Let me explain this. God knows what

we do and knows if it's good or bad. Because he is almighty
and just, he should reward us or punish us accordingly.
Consequently, it is in our best interest to behave well and
"please" him. Our "moral" obligations, the rewards and
the punishments, differ with the religion in question, but the
pattern is always the same.
But self-interested action is in no way moral, except,
perhaps, when there is a threat to our lives. The moral
obligations are established by us to rule our behavior to
ward others.
God is not likely to appreciate such a self-interested
belief as fulfilling any moral obligations by human beings.
He could not be fooled so easily.
Even more, because thereis no vanity in God, it would be
totally unreasonable to believe that he demands to be rec
ognized as "supreme ruler" and be praised accordingly.
That would be silly of him, and we know that God is not like
that/Can you imagine God being so vain as to require from
us to believe in him and to let everyone know that we do by
congregating to pray?
Even if it were a sin not to believe in God, don't you think
that a being that is all compassion would end up by forgiving
us such a minor transgression? After all, if we can't recog
nize his existence that is clearly only his fault for having
created us so imperfectly.
God doesn't need prayers and we don't either. Because if
prayers are only to remind ourselves of the existence of God
to behave morally we'd be better off by printing posters or
car stickers with the logo "Have you behaved morally to
day?" That would sell better anyway.
