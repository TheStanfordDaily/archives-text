## Prof. Estelle Freedman and an elaboration of tenure procedure 
### 
This letter is prompted by various
statements that have appeared in
pewspapers during the spring of 1982
' and in more recent weeks. All of these
have addressed the denial by our office
of tenure to Asst. History Prof. Estelle
Freedman. It would be improper for
any University officer to comment pub
licly on the details of a specific case.
Nevertheless, such confusion has been
in the air that these general comments
are meant to provide background on
the tenure process at this University.
The primary criterion for tenure at
an institution such as Stanford is quality
of mind as demonstrated by published
scholarship and the teaching record.
The ways in which scholarship and
teaching are evaluated and judged
have been written about at length by
Provost Albert Hastorf, by me and by
many others, and need not be reviewed
again here. However, the so-called
"service" category of faculty activity
does warrant comment.
Service is a part of every faculty per
son's professional life. It may include
student advising, committee work, par
ticipation in extradepartmental prog
rams, serving on national committees,
membership in professional organiza
tions, and a variety of other activities.
While such activity is important, the
service category can never overcome
deficiencies in either of the two prim
ary criteria used to judge tenure, qual
ity of scholarship and quality of teach
ing. Too many examples exist here and
elsewhere of a person promoted on the
basis of strong service activities in one
year proving in later years to have lost
the fire that made him or her so effec
tive while young. Without the strength
in scholarship that sustains fine teach
ing and service, such individuals
short-change generations of students.
In addition, those persons occupy pre
cious faculty positions that should be
available to the first-rate young people
entering careers in the scholarly pro
fession.
The important goals of Affirmative
Action for minority group members

and women are pertinent to the way the
"service" category is taken into ac
count in the tenure judgment. The re
port of the Committee on the Stanford
Professoriate concluded that basic
standards in scholarship and teaching
should not be bent in order to achieve
the goals of Affirmative Action. In the
years since the report, a policy on ser
vice in the tenure equation has evolved
and may be summarized as follows: in
cases where a candidate is judged truly
"borderline" in scholarship or teach
ing, so that the vote reasonably might
go either way, then the quality and na
ture of university service may be consi
dered as a factor. This policy recog
nizes that minority group members and
women on the junior faculty are fre
quently subjected to special demands
on their time that necessarily detracts
from time available for scholarship and
teaching. It is the obligation of review
ing bodies and deans to judge carefully
whether a given candidate for tenure
falls in the "borderline" category in
scholarship or teaching, and if so, then
to consider and evaluate any special
contributions of that individual in the
service category.
The reader should note that being a
faculty member of physics, classics,
economics, Latin American studies,
human biology, or other administrative
units is not a criterion for tenure. For
many years it has been practice in the
School of Humanities and Sciences at
Stanford to make the decision about
investing a tenure position in a particu
lar field or discipline at the time an
initial search is authorized to a depart
ment and an appointment is made.
Thus, when a person is hired as a
medieval historian, a developmental
psychologist, or an organic chemist, the
individual is free to work as effectively
as he or she can as scholar and teacher.
The young person does not work for six
years under a cloud of uncertainty
about whether the field itself may be
judged inappropriate at the time of te
nure review, with the result that tenure
could be denied irrespective of the per
son's qualifications. In other words, we

do not include an "administrative" fac
tor in the tenure equation. Those who
argue for tenure on the basis of
academic field or of service to some
unit of the University are asking that
such an administrative factor be used.
But if it is, it can be used for or against
candidates. At present, being a criti
cally important participant in Latin
American studies or feminist studies,
being Stanford's only teacher of a rare
language, or whatever, is not held for
or against the person up for considera
tion. Similarly, whether the person is a
Marxist, a member of the Moral Major
ity, or has behavioral quirks is irrelev
ant. By placing the administrative fac
tor "up front" at the time of searching
and hiring, we allow the tenure process
to focus where I believe it should, on
the individual as scholar and teacher.
Finally, those unfamiliar with the te
nure evaluation process should be
aware of the care with which reviewing
bodies examine evidence and draw
conclusions. Periodically there is con
troversy at research universities such as
Stanford when an award-winning un
dergraduate teacher fails to receive te
nure. How, it is asked, can this occur?
The answer is that the reviewing bodies
of Humanities and Sciences draw con
clusions based on a more complete set
of evidence on teaching and scholar
ship than that available to most prize
awarding bodies. Furthermore, awards
and prizes may be given for many diffe
rent reasons other than the quality of
scholarship or teaching in the narrow
sense. Thus, our evaluators will cer
tainly view with respect awards for
teaching, from professional societies,
or for books published, but will inter
pret those awards in light of their own
conclusions, after careful examination
of the primary evidence and what pro
fessional colleagues say in their de
tailed analyses of the underlying work.
In summary, the tenure decision
process is a very complicated one that
takes immense time and care. It is the
most important type of decision made
by university faculties and reviewing
bodies. With changing retirement laws,

those promoted to tenure in 1983 may
still be occupying their faculty positions
in 2025 or later. A good portion of
their salaries over that span will come
from tuition of students not yet born.
Though our system is not perfect, it is
necessarily conservative. That is be
cause the impact of mistakes is so last
ing and destructive to our mission of
scholarship and teaching.

Unequal housing
The Daily's editorial, "Random
housing has purpose" (Jan. 3), gives an
accurate argument for equal rent for all
University housing. But it misses the
boat on a more fundamental question:
why are the dorms themselves so un
equal? Why did Residential Education
spend all that money on Governor's
Corner when Stern, Wilbur and Man
zanita are in such miserable shape?
Isn't it schizophrenic to pour money
into future residences while ignoring
the problems of present ones? As the
Daily points out, unequal housing
based on unequal socio-economic
backgrounds is undesirable. You
should have gone on to say that all un
equal housing is undesirable.
