## Protect our 'paraprofessions' 
### 
Perhaps you read last quarter the
story blearily titled "Schools face fi
nancial problems." This is hardly news
anymore, but the article did include
one comment which should have dis
mayed us all. I know few students were
dismayed, because we were all too
busy: we had midterms to take, prob
lem sets to finish, wash to do and.
clothes to pack for Christmas vacation.
I had more time than most, so I had a
chance to think about and define the
dismay.
Pat Keating, Michigan State budget of
ficer, is reported to have said, in re
ference to budget strictures at the
Michigan State University system,
"Our feeling has been that we've been
able to maintain the level of quality but
have seriously reduced flexibility." He
is further reported to have said that
"paraprofessional programs — the
arts, letters, education and nursing —
were areas that received more cuts than
areas such as business or engineering."
There it is. Lest we focus on the par
ticular and accidental characteristics of
the item, of a state school in the Mid
west, let me point out that our dismay
should arise from the mere fact that
such a thing could be said in reference
to higher education at any university. If
the budget officer said this, he did so
because he thought the people around
him would understand it. The students
and professors, both there and here at
Stanford, can look at this statement
and say, "Yes, more cuts were made in
paraprofessional fields like the arts and
letters." Now the French professor
might bemoan this fact, and the en
gineering student shrug and accept it as
the inexorable operation of supply and
demand for engineers and French pro
fessors. Nevertheless, all of you, stu
dents and professors of the humanities,
arts, applied and theoretical sciences,
can understand what Keating is talking
about.
We should not understand what
Keating is talking about. We should be
perplexed, and as we think more about
it, we should be angry.
A "university" is "the whole body of
teachers and scholars engaged, at a par
ticular place, in giving and receiving
instruction in the higher branches of
learning. . .We are collected here at
the particular place, Stanford; in
America we take the basic organiza
tional unit of this giving and receiving
to be a "course." A course is a group of

students examining a particular subject
under the direction of someone who
has studied it before.
As I proceed through definitions, I
want to point out just what a university
does not necessarily include. The defin
ition does not require papers, nor labs,
nor problem sets, lectures, discussion
sections, reviews, final exams, career
counseling, medical school interviews,
dramatic productions, football, food
service or the LSJUMB. Consider just
how many of our hours we devote each
day to the purely accidental and con
tingent activities of our university! We
enjoy ourselves tremendously; we do
fun things; we immerse ourselves in
fleeting and unessential activities, and
as day follows day, problem set follows
problem set, Big Game follows Big
Game, the reality of our enterprise
here together slowly fades. You all re
member Plato: the shifting, unreal illu
sions obscure our clear sight o f what
truly is.

We should all be scholars gathered together in this
one place to give and receive instruction, but in the
Stanford of today, the receiving has superceded the
giving.

We have come together here, bet
ween the foothills and the Bay, to
explore our world. We have been re
moved from the daily toil of feeding
ourselves and have a chance to
examine the world around us. Some
have decided to devote their lives to
this examination, have made it their
daily toil, and we honor them with the
title "Professor." Professors guide
their students in their exploration of
various parts of the world, so that those
of us who are less experienced have a
chance to participate in many intellec
tual journeys through varied discip
lines. We do iwJt have "Distribution
Requirements" set out like a Chinese
menu; we have instead many oppor
tunities to explore different corners of
the world with those who have
explored them before.
Consider the ideas underlying Dis
tribution Requirements. Think about
it; don't just run rhetoric through your
head, but think about the require
ments. Are your thoughts bogged
down in units, quarters, adding it all up
to get a degree in four years? These are
contingencies; they are accidental: we
have to live with them, but we do not
have to let them define the reality
which we inhabit.
We should all be scholars gathered
together in this one place to give and
receive instruction, but in the Stanford
of today, the receiving has superceded
the giving. We add up units to get a
diploma, we work long hours at our
problem sets to get a good engineering
job; we study incessantly to get into
medical school. We "work, study, get
rich." All we do is get; when do we
give? Our guides to the many worlds of
higher learning offer us their experi
ence, their insight, their years of labor;
they show us the marvels which they

and their colleagues have discovered,
in Greek tragedy, in econometrics, in
nonequilibrium systems, in the Quat
trocento. They invite us to explore
some part of the vast territory of
human experience ourselves, to be
come excited over some part of this
world we construct and inhabit, to
labor with our own minds uncovering
some small part of the wonder. They do
not just hand out paper topics and as
sign homework.
The students who are our professors
love their labor a nd they give what they
love to us; we in turn ask when it's due,
how much it counts in the final grade,
whether it'll be on the final. What
would you do if you loved a beautiful,
precious thing, and you gave it to
someone, hoping he, too, might dis
cover its beauty and perhaps learn to
cherish it? And then he turns it upside
down and shakes it, squeezes it and
asks how long the paper has to be?
Wouldn't you post your office hours,

close your door, and work on your cur
rent research?
Perhaps this all sounds too unreal to
you. If s too off the wall and weird; the
reality is that we're here at Stanford
studying our tails off to get a good job
or to enter a good graduate school. The
professors are telling last year's jokes
in lecture, handing out too much
homework and too many pages to read
and making the final closed-book.
If indeed you believe this is the way
things are, then take heart: the people
who manage the money are also com
ing arojupd to your poigt view. 4
Budget-ofgcere are no longer in the
dark: arts, letters and nursing are
"paraprofessionAl" and guess where
the budget axe will fall? In its radical
sense, "para" means "beside." It can
mean "derived from" or "beyond," but
I think Keating meant that these arts
and letters are not quite where the
money should be; that business and en
gineering are on target and the "parap
rofessional" fields miss the target a bit.
They might have something to offer.
They might not. Money is scarce and
priorities must be set.
Now are you angry? Are you
mayed? Do you wonder how people
can have it so wrong when they look at
the university? Do you wonder who is
responsible — those within or without
the university? Or are you too busy
typing that paper, too frazzled from
that last test, too burnt out from the
weekend to concentrate this week?
Give yourself a treat: give yourself a
half-hour of quiet to ponder the uni
versity and your place in it as a scholar.
You will be the better for it, and
perhaps so will the future.

lem sets to finish, wash to do and.
clothes to pack for Christmas vacation.
I had more time than most, so I had a
chance to think about and define the
dismay.
Pat Keating, Michigan State budget of
ficer, is reported to have said, in re
ference to budget strictures at the
Michigan State University system,
"Our feeling has been that we've been
able to maintain the level of quality but
have seriously reduced flexibility." He
is further reported to have said that
"paraprofessional programs — the
arts, letters, education and nursing —
were areas that received more cuts than
areas such as business or engineering."
There it is. Lest we focus on the par
ticular and accidental characteristics of
the item, of a state school in the Mid
west, let me point out that our dismay
should arise from the mere fact that
such a thing could be said in reference
to higher education at any university. If
the budget officer said this, he did so
because he thought the people around
him would understand it. The students
and professors, both there and here at
Stanford, can look at this statement
and say, "Yes, more cuts were made in
paraprofessional fields like the arts and
letters." Now the French professor
might bemoan this fact, and the en
gineering student shrug and accept it as
the inexorable operation of supply and
demand for engineers and French pro
fessors. Nevertheless, all of you, stu
dents and professors of the humanities,
arts, applied and theoretical sciences,
can understand what Keating is talking
about.
We should not understand what
Keating is talking about. We should be
perplexed, and as we think more about
it, we should be angry.
A "university" is "the whole body of
teachers and scholars engaged, at a par
ticular place, in giving and receiving
instruction in the higher branches of
learning. . .We are collected here at
the particular place, Stanford; in
America we take the basic organiza
tional unit of this giving and receiving
to be a "course." A course is a group of

students examining a particular subject
under the direction of someone who
has studied it before.
As I proceed through definitions, I
want to point out just what a university
does not necessarily include. The defin
ition does not require papers, nor labs,
nor problem sets, lectures, discussion
sections, reviews, final exams, career
counseling, medical school interviews,
dramatic productions, football, food
service or the LSJUMB. Consider just
how many of our hours we devote each
day to the purely accidental and con
tingent activities of our university! We
enjoy ourselves tremendously; we do
fun things; we immerse ourselves in
fleeting and unessential activities, and
as day follows day, problem set follows
problem set, Big Game follows Big
Game, the reality of our enterprise
here together slowly fades. You all re
member Plato: the shifting, unreal illu
sions obscure our clear sight o f what
truly is.

We should all be scholars gathered together in this
one place to give and receive instruction, but in the
Stanford of today, the receiving has superceded the
giving.

We have come together here, bet
ween the foothills and the Bay, to
explore our world. We have been re
moved from the daily toil of feeding
ourselves and have a chance to
examine the world around us. Some
have decided to devote their lives to
this examination, have made it their
daily toil, and we honor them with the
title "Professor." Professors guide
their students in their exploration of
various parts of the world, so that those
of us who are less experienced have a
chance to participate in many intellec
tual journeys through varied discip
lines. We do iwJt have "Distribution
Requirements" set out like a Chinese
menu; we have instead many oppor
tunities to explore different corners of
the world with those who have
explored them before.
Consider the ideas underlying Dis
tribution Requirements. Think about
it; don't just run rhetoric through your
head, but think about the require
ments. Are your thoughts bogged
down in units, quarters, adding it all up
to get a degree in four years? These are
contingencies; they are accidental: we
have to live with them, but we do not
have to let them define the reality
which we inhabit.
We should all be scholars gathered
together in this one place to give and
receive instruction, but in the Stanford
of today, the receiving has superceded
the giving. We add up units to get a
diploma, we work long hours at our
problem sets to get a good engineering
job; we study incessantly to get into
medical school. We "work, study, get
rich." All we do is get; when do we
give? Our guides to the many worlds of
higher learning offer us their experi
ence, their insight, their years of labor;
they show us the marvels which they

and their colleagues have discovered,
in Greek tragedy, in econometrics, in
nonequilibrium systems, in the Quat
trocento. They invite us to explore
some part of the vast territory of
human experience ourselves, to be
come excited over some part of this
world we construct and inhabit, to
labor with our own minds uncovering
some small part of the wonder. They do
not just hand out paper topics and as
sign homework.
The students who are our professors
love their labor a nd they give what they
love to us; we in turn ask when it's due,
how much it counts in the final grade,
whether it'll be on the final. What
would you do if you loved a beautiful,
precious thing, and you gave it to
someone, hoping he, too, might dis
cover its beauty and perhaps learn to
cherish it? And then he turns it upside
down and shakes it, squeezes it and
asks how long the paper has to be?
Wouldn't you post your office hours,

close your door, and work on your cur
rent research?
Perhaps this all sounds too unreal to
you. If s too off the wall and weird; the
reality is that we're here at Stanford
studying our tails off to get a good job
or to enter a good graduate school. The
professors are telling last year's jokes
in lecture, handing out too much
homework and too many pages to read
and making the final closed-book.
If indeed you believe this is the way
things are, then take heart: the people
who manage the money are also com
ing arojupd to your poigt view. 4
Budget-ofgcere are no longer in the
dark: arts, letters and nursing are
"paraprofessionAl" and guess where
the budget axe will fall? In its radical
sense, "para" means "beside." It can
mean "derived from" or "beyond," but
I think Keating meant that these arts
and letters are not quite where the
money should be; that business and en
gineering are on target and the "parap
rofessional" fields miss the target a bit.
They might have something to offer.
They might not. Money is scarce and
priorities must be set.
Now are you angry? Are you
mayed? Do you wonder how people
can have it so wrong when they look at
the university? Do you wonder who is
responsible — those within or without
the university? Or are you too busy
typing that paper, too frazzled from
that last test, too burnt out from the
weekend to concentrate this week?
Give yourself a treat: give yourself a
half-hour of quiet to ponder the uni
versity and your place in it as a scholar.
You will be the better for it, and
perhaps so will the future.

health services research.)
Perhaps you read last quarter the
story blearily titled "Schools face fi
nancial problems." This is hardly news
anymore, but the article did include
one comment which should have dis
mayed us all. I know few students were
