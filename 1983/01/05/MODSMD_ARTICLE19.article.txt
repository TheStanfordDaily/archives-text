# Women lose in heartbreakers
## 
### LIBBY LEONARD 
After her team lost its sixth
game of the season by two
points or less, women's bas
ketball coach Dotty McCrea
made a New Year's Resolu
tion. McCrea plans togo back
on the winning wagon.
The Cardinal was upset by
conference foe UCLA 70-68
last Thursday. Despite the
disappointing outcome,
McCrea said the Card
"played almost a perfect
game." Stanford shot better
from the field than its oppo
nent, but was outmuscled on
the boards 40-28. Seniors
Jeanne Ruark-Hoff and Kim
Kupferer, a reserve forward,
shared top scoring honors
with 16.
"UCLA was the only game
we didn't lose on the free
throw line," said McCrea
whose team missed just one
free throw.
Earlier that week, the Card
failed to conv â€¢? crucial fcui
shots, triggerin b 69-66 lo.v>
to visiting Nevada-Las Vegas.
After climbing to a seven
point lead early in the second
half, the Card missed the
front end of five consecutive
one-and-one opportunities,
forfeiting a possible 10
points. Ironically, the Card is
recognized as one of the na
tion's top free throw shooting
teams with a 72.3 percentage
from the line.
Las Vegas took advantage
of the Card's temporary loss
of composure and reversed
Stanford's lead and momen
tum. Senior Meg Metzger
chipped in a season-high 28
points. Las Vegas guard
Rochelle Oliver countered
with 25. Metzger is off to a
first-rate final year, averaging
17.5 points per game and 6.8
rebounds.
Teammate Ruark-Hoff has
regained her fine shooting
touch after foregoing last sea
son to get married. Ruark-
Hoff is scoring at a 16.3 clip
while converting 61 percent
from the floor.


ONLY TWO OL T OP 1000: Stanford senior Met Metzger scores two of her more than
1000 career points in the Cardinal's 69-68 loss Vegas at Maples Pavilion
Dec. 27. Metzger reached the "grand" plateau in Stanford's win over Pepperdine the
previous week.
