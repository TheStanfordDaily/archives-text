# Women lose in heartbreakers
## 
### LIBBY LEONARD 
After her team lost its sixth
game of the season by two
points or less, women's bas
ketball coach Dotty McCrea
made a New Year's Resolu
tion. McCrea plans togo back
on the winning wagon.
The Cardinal was upset by
conference foe UCLA 70-68
last Thursday. Despite the
disappointing outcome,
McCrea said the Card
"played almost a perfect
game." Stanford shot better
from the field than its oppo
nent, but was outmuscled on
the boards 40-28. Seniors
Jeanne Ruark-Hoff and Kim
Kupferer, a reserve forward,
shared top scoring honors
with 16.
"UCLA was the only game
we didn't lose on the free
throw line," said McCrea
whose team missed just one
free throw.
Earlier that week, the Card
failed to conv •? crucial fcui
shots, triggerin b 69-66 lo.v>
to visiting Nevada-Las Vegas.
After climbing to a seven
point lead early in the second
half, the Card missed the
front end of five consecutive
one-and-one opportunities,
forfeiting a possible 10
points. Ironically, the Card is
recognized as one of the na
tion's top free throw shooting
teams with a 72.3 percentage
from the line.
Las Vegas took advantage
of the Card's temporary loss
of composure and reversed
Stanford's lead and momen
tum. Senior Meg Metzger
chipped in a season-high 28
points. Las Vegas guard
Rochelle Oliver countered
with 25. Metzger is off to a
first-rate final year, averaging
17.5 points per game and 6.8
rebounds.
Teammate Ruark-Hoff has
regained her fine shooting
touch after foregoing last sea
son to get married. Ruark-
Hoff is scoring at a 16.3 clip
while converting 61 percent
from the floor.


ONLY TWO OL T OP 1000: Stanford senior Met Metzger scores two of her more than
1000 career points in the Cardinal's 69-68 loss Vegas at Maples Pavilion
Dec. 27. Metzger reached the "grand" plateau in Stanford's win over Pepperdine the
previous week.
Freshman Virginia Sourlis has
already begun a brilliant col
legiate career. Sourlis is third on
the Cardinal scoring ladder, av
eraging 11 points. The smallest
member of the team has also dis
hed out 52 assists.
Although there were setbacks
during the winter break, the
Card did have reason to be merry
after routing Pepperdine 85-70
on Dec. 18.
Stanford led by 14 at the in
termission. Pepperdine never
could muster a comeback with its
miserable 36 percent field goal
shooting. Early in the second
half, Metzger scored her 1000 th
career point. The six-foot for
ward finished a strong all-around
performance with 24.

The Card was tested on the
last day of finals week and failed
to make the grade against the
University of San Francisco,
dropping a 77-75 decision. Once
again McGea attributed this loss
to poor free throw shooting
down the stretch.
"We have to show more poise
in the end," McCrea remarked.
McCrea thinks that part of the
problem stems from a lack of ex
perience in some positions. Point
guard, anchored by rookie Sour
lis is a case in point. McCrea
claims, however, that her team
"has improved steadily in every
game." The veteran coach has
found that close contests tend to
weather her young players
quickly.
After losing three of its last

four games, the Cards' record
has slipped to 8-6. Is McCrea still
confident that her team will fare
well in conference play?
"Without a doubt," she re
sponded. "They play so hard and
work so hard, 1 know it'sgoing to
pay off."
McCrea plans to take the re
cent defeats in stride. "I figure
it's a new year, and we're bound
to get lucky now," she said.
The Card meets a quick-fire
Nebraska squad Friday at 6 p.m.
at the USF Sourdough Invita
tional. Santa Barbara and host
USF round out the four-team
competition. In its last two tour
nament appearances, the Card
ran away with first place.

MAKING A PASS: Jeanne Ruark-Hoff, who took last season
off in order to pet married, has come back in 1982-413 to
average 16.3 points per game for the Cardinal. The senior

the USF Tournament this weekend, is also shooting 61 percent
from the floor.

on Dec. 18.
Stanford led by 14 at the in
termission. Pepperdine never
could muster a comeback with its
miserable 36 percent field goal
shooting. Early in the second
half, Metzger scored her 1000 th
career point. The six-foot for
ward finished a strong all-around
performance with 24.

The Card was tested on the
last day of finals week and failed
to make the grade against the
University of San Francisco,
dropping a 77-75 decision. Once
again McGea attributed this loss
to poor free throw shooting
down the stretch.
"We have to show more poise
in the end," McCrea remarked.
McCrea thinks that part of the
problem stems from a lack of ex
perience in some positions. Point
guard, anchored by rookie Sour
lis is a case in point. McCrea
claims, however, that her team
"has improved steadily in every
game." The veteran coach has
found that close contests tend to
weather her young players
quickly.
After losing three of its last

four games, the Cards' record
has slipped to 8-6. Is McCrea still
confident that her team will fare
well in conference play?
"Without a doubt," she re
sponded. "They play so hard and
work so hard, 1 know it'sgoing to
pay off."
McCrea plans to take the re
cent defeats in stride. "I figure
it's a new year, and we're bound
to get lucky now," she said.
The Card meets a quick-fire
Nebraska squad Friday at 6 p.m.
at the USF Sourdough Invita
tional. Santa Barbara and host
USF round out the four-team
competition. In its last two tour
nament appearances, the Card
ran away with first place.

ketball coach Dotty McCrea
made a New Year's Resolu
tion. McCrea plans togo back
on the winning wagon.
The Cardinal was upset by
conference foe UCLA 70-68
last Thursday. Despite the
disappointing outcome,
McCrea said the Card
"played almost a perfect
game." Stanford shot better
from the field than its oppo
nent, but was outmuscled on
the boards 40-28. Seniors
Jeanne Ruark-Hoff and Kim
Kupferer, a reserve forward,
shared top scoring honors
with 16.
"UCLA was the only game
we didn't lose on the free
throw line," said McCrea
whose team missed just one
free throw.
Earlier that week, the Card
failed to conv •? crucial fcui
shots, triggerin b 69-66 lo.v>

After climbing to a seven
point lead early in the second

front end of five consecutive
one-and-one opportunities,
forfeiting a possible 10
points. Ironically, the Card is
recognized as one of the na
tion's top free throw shooting
teams with a 72.3 percentage
from the line.
Las Vegas took advantage
of the Card's temporary loss
of composure and reversed
Stanford's lead and momen
tum. Senior Meg Metzger
chipped in a season-high 28
points. Las Vegas guard
Rochelle Oliver countered
with 25. Metzger is off to a
first-rate final year, averaging
17.5 points per game and 6.8
rebounds.
Teammate Ruark-Hoff has
regained her fine shooting
touch after foregoing last sea
son to get married. Ruark-
Hoff is scoring at a 16.3 clip
while converting 61 percent
from the floor.
