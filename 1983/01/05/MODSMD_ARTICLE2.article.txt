# Amos relinquishes right to preliminary hearing
## 
### GLEN ALLERHAND Staff writer 
Donald John Amos, the defendant in
the Angela Arvidson homicide case,
was bound over to Santa Clara County
Superior Court yesterday after he
waived his right to a municipal court
preliminary hearing.
Amos is scheduled to be arraigned
Jan. 17 and could go on trial two
months later. Amos, charged with felo
nies, has already been arraigned at the
municipal court level.
In yesterday's proceeding, Randall
Schneider, the public defender assigned
to Amos' case, told Municipal Court
Judge Timothy Hanifin that Amos re
linquished his right to the preliminary
hearing. •
Amos' waiver means the defense
agrees that the evidence against him
creates a "strong suspicion" that Amos
was at the scene of the crime, Schneider
explained in an interview after the court
proceeding. Schneider added that the
waiver does not imply guilt on Amos'
part.
Amos, 29, is charged with murdering
Angela Arvidson, a Stanford junior,
last October. Arvidson was found
stabbed to death in the home of Medi
cal School Prof. Laurence Kedes, where
she worked as a part-time housekeeper.
Amos is also charged with being an
ex-felon in possession of a concealable
weapon and with the possession of a
stolen .38 caliber revolver and a rifle.
Amos entered court yesterday in a
red smock and handcuffs. He re
sponded affirmatively when Hanifin
asked if he realized that the waiver
meant forfeiture of his right to cross-ex
amine witnesses, present evidence in his
defense and to remain silent during the
proceeding.
Preliminary hearings are designed to
determine whether sufficient evidence
exists to try a suspect.
George Kennedy, senior deputy dis
trict attorney for the county, said after
the proceeding that he had subpoenaed
five witnesses to testify against Amos at
the scheduled hearing. They were: Tom
Sing and Tom Beck, two Santa Clara
County sheriffs assigned to the case;
Harvey Tompkins, head of the firm for
which Amos worked at the time of the

homicide; county criminalist James
Norris; and Todd Kedes, who found
Arvidson after the stabbing. Todd, 16,
is the younger son of Kedes and his
wife, Shirley. Dr. and Mrs. Kedes and
their daughter, Maureen, 20, accom
panied Todd to court yesterday.
Kennedy said the next step in the case
would be Amos' arraignment in superi
or court, followed by Amos' plea to the
charges against him. A trial mosMikely
would begin 60 days after the arraign
ment, Kennedy said.
In waiving the preliminary hearing,
Schneider said, the defense agreed that
there was enough evidence to "create a
suspicion" that Amos was at the crime
scene.
"He was working that day — no
question. We know what his route was
— no question," Schneider said.
At the time of Arvidson's death,
Amos was working as a delivery man
for Tompkins Promotions, a Los Altos
firm that raises funds for a home for the
mentally retarded.
A delivery invoice found in the drive
way of the Kedes home first led police
to suspect Amos. Authorities later
found a bloody pair of jeans and a torn
flannel shirt in his home. Arvidson's
blood type reportedly matched that of
the blood found on the jeans.
An all-points bulletin was issued two
days after the Oct. 22 slaying. Police re
ceived reports placing Amos in various
locations in the state and beyond. Amos
finally surrendered to county sheriffs in
San Jose Nov. 14 and has been held
without bail since.
Amos has been convicted previously
of assault with a deadly weapon and
selling LSD. He also was placed on pro
bation after a plea bargain on charges
of drunk driving and auto theft.
Early in the homicide investigation,
police learned that on the day of
Arvidson's stabbing Amos had made a
delivery in the neighborhood.
In a November interview with the
Daily, Shirley Kedes speculated that a
delivery man could have arrived at her
home when she was running errands
with a friend. At the time, Arvidson was
in the Kedes home alone.

firm that raises funds for a home for the
mentally retarded.
A delivery invoice found in the drive
way of the Kedes home first led police
to suspect Amos. Authorities later
found a bloody pair of jeans and a torn
flannel shirt in his home. Arvidson's
blood type reportedly matched that of
the blood found on the jeans.
An all-points bulletin was issued two
days after the Oct. 22 slaying. Police re
ceived reports placing Amos in various
locations in the state and beyond. Amos
finally surrendered to county sheriffs in
San Jose Nov. 14 and has been held
without bail since.
Amos has been convicted previously
of assault with a deadly weapon and
selling LSD. He also was placed on pro
bation after a plea bargain on charges
of drunk driving and auto theft.
Early in the homicide investigation,
police learned that on the day of
Arvidson's stabbing Amos had made a
delivery in the neighborhood.
In a November interview with the
Daily, Shirley Kedes speculated that a
delivery man could have arrived at her
home when she was running errands
with a friend. At the time, Arvidson was
in the Kedes home alone.
