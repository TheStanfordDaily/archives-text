## Cardinal beats '82 record before swinging into Pacific-10 season 
### STEVE ODELL 
Stanford, with more wins in its
first lOgames thanit had inallof
last season, travels to the Pacific
Northwest to take on Oregon
and Oregon State and initiate its
Pacific-10 Conference basket
ball schedule tomorrow.
The Cardinal, which won but
one road game a year ago, is 8-2
going into tomorrow night's con
test against the Beavers, who
were in everybody's preseason
Top Twenty. Stanford faces 4-5
Oregon Saturday night in
Eugene.
OSU has been disappointing
to date, posting only a 6-4 re
cord, and losing its last game to
underdog Idaho in the finals of
the Far West Classic.
Last season, the joke was that
Stanford had beaten the Beavers
by more in football (63-9), than
OSU had trounced the Cardinal
in basketball (111-81 and 81-
38). The Beavers rolled to a 25-5
record and their third straight
conference title before losing to
Georgetown in the finals of the
NCAA Western Regional
playoffs.
But this is a different Beaver
team. All-America guard Lester
Conner was lost to graduation
and now is a Golden State War
rior. 1981-82 Coach of the Year
Ralph Miller will also be without
the services of his All-America
junior center Charlie Sitton. Sit
ton was injured in the Idaho loss
and will miss up to 10 days of
Play-
That means the bulk of the
scoring and rebounding will need
to be assumed by forwards
Danny Evans and A.C. Green.
Evans, a senior, averaged 11.3
points per game a year ago and
sophomore Green, who has exp
losive offensive capabilities,
checked in at 8.6. Both are quick
and could present problems for
the slow frontcourt of the Cardi
nal.
Senior William Brew leads the
Beaver attack from his point
guard position, but has failed to
be as effective this season with
out Conner as his backcourt
partner. Freshman center Steve
Woodside, who led Parkrose

High School to the state champ
ionship as the Oregon Prep
Player of the Year in 1981-82,
will attempt to fill at least par
tially Sitton's vacant size 14
shoes.
With Sitton out, the Cardinal's
fate should rely even more heav

ily than usual on center John Re
velli, the leading Cardinal scorer
(20.6) and rebounder (8.9). The
junior center will be able to work
effectively inside on the smaller
and less physical Beaver front
line.


SITTON WILL BE SITTIN': All-America junior center
Charlie Sitton (52), shown here taking a charge from Johnny
Rogers, scored 31 points in Oregon State's two wins over
Stanford last season. Sitton will sit out tomorrow night's game
with the Cardinal due to a knee injury.
Revelli has led Stanford all
season and recently became the
15th 1000-point scorer in Stan
ford history. With five more re
bounds, he will also move into
the top 10 in career rebounding.
Two freshmen complete the
starting frontcourt for the Cardi
nal, walk-on Andy Fischer and
Earl Koberlein. Fischer scored a
career-high 12 points in a loss to
Rutgers over the quarter break.
The other top scorer for Stan
ford has been sixth man Keith
Jones. The second leading scorer
for the Card averaging 18.3
points per game, Jones nailed
down a career-high 27 points
against Brown over the break.
He is also shooting 57.5 percent
from the field.
Guard Keith Ramee is the
third freshman in the starting
line-up. Ramee's ball handling
wizardry has allowed him to rack
up nearly five assists per game,

and will be a key factor in attack
ing the tough Oregon State
fullcourt pressure. Steady Steve
Brown is the other starter at
guard for the Cardinal. Brown
will probably draw Brew in his
defensive assignment, and his
ability to stop Brew from penet
rating and dishing off to Green
and Evans will play a major fole
in determining the outcome in
Corvallis.
Oregon is a favorite opponent
of Stanford's, as the Ducks were
the only Pac-10 team the Cardi
nal beat last season. Stanford did
it twice, 97-88 in Maples Pavil- •
ion, and 79-76 in overtime at 1
"Mac Arthur Court. 1 ' '
The Ducks are 4-5 following
their third-place finish in the Far
West Classic and are led by
center Blair Rasmussen. The
sophomore seven-footer posses
ses a soft hook shot and has
shown credible potential, but
must overcome his relative
timidity to shoot inside.

SITTON WILL BE SITTIN': All-America junior center
Charlie Sitton (52), shown here taking a charge from Johnny
Rogers, scored 31 points in Oregon State's two wins over
Stanford last season. Sitton will sit out tomorrow night's game
with the Cardinal due to a knee injury.
Revelli has led Stanford all
season and recently became the
15th 1000-point scorer in Stan
ford history. With five more re
bounds, he will also move into
the top 10 in career rebounding.
Two freshmen complete the
starting frontcourt for the Cardi
nal, walk-on Andy Fischer and
Earl Koberlein. Fischer scored a
career-high 12 points in a loss to
Rutgers over the quarter break.
The other top scorer for Stan
ford has been sixth man Keith
Jones. The second leading scorer
for the Card averaging 18.3
points per game, Jones nailed
down a career-high 27 points
against Brown over the break.
He is also shooting 57.5 percent
from the field.
Guard Keith Ramee is the
third freshman in the starting
line-up. Ramee's ball handling
wizardry has allowed him to rack
up nearly five assists per game,

and will be a key factor in attack
ing the tough Oregon State
fullcourt pressure. Steady Steve
Brown is the other starter at
guard for the Cardinal. Brown
will probably draw Brew in his
defensive assignment, and his
ability to stop Brew from penet
rating and dishing off to Green
and Evans will play a major fole
in determining the outcome in
Corvallis.
Oregon is a favorite opponent
of Stanford's, as the Ducks were
the only Pac-10 team the Cardi
nal beat last season. Stanford did
it twice, 97-88 in Maples Pavil- •
ion, and 79-76 in overtime at 1
"Mac Arthur Court. 1 ' '
The Ducks are 4-5 following
their third-place finish in the Far
West Classic and are led by
center Blair Rasmussen. The
sophomore seven-footer posses
ses a soft hook shot and has
shown credible potential, but
must overcome his relative
timidity to shoot inside.
Stanford, with more wins in its
first lOgames thanit had inallof
last season, travels to the Pacific
Northwest to take on Oregon
and Oregon State and initiate its
Pacific-10 Conference basket
ball schedule tomorrow.
The Cardinal, which won but
one road game a year ago, is 8-2
going into tomorrow night's con
test against the Beavers, who
were in everybody's preseason
Top Twenty. Stanford faces 4-5
Oregon Saturday night in
Eugene.
OSU has been disappointing
to date, posting only a 6-4 re
cord, and losing its last game to
underdog Idaho in the finals of
the Far West Classic.
Last season, the joke was that
Stanford had beaten the Beavers
by more in football (63-9), than
OSU had trounced the Cardinal
in basketball (111-81 and 81-
38). The Beavers rolled to a 25-5
record and their third straight
conference title before losing to
Georgetown in the finals of the
NCAA Western Regional
playoffs.
But this is a different Beaver
team. All-America guard Lester
Conner was lost to graduation
and now is a Golden State War
rior. 1981-82 Coach of the Year
Ralph Miller will also be without
the services of his All-America
junior center Charlie Sitton. Sit
ton was injured in the Idaho loss
and will miss up to 10 days of
Play-
That means the bulk of the
scoring and rebounding will need
to be assumed by forwards
Danny Evans and A.C. Green.
Evans, a senior, averaged 11.3
points per game a year ago and
sophomore Green, who has exp
losive offensive capabilities,
checked in at 8.6. Both are quick
and could present problems for
the slow frontcourt of the Cardi
nal.
Senior William Brew leads the
Beaver attack from his point
guard position, but has failed to
be as effective this season with
out Conner as his backcourt
partner. Freshman center Steve
Woodside, who led Parkrose

High School to the state champ
ionship as the Oregon Prep
Player of the Year in 1981-82,
will attempt to fill at least par
tially Sitton's vacant size 14
shoes.
With Sitton out, the Cardinal's
fate should rely even more heav

ily than usual on center John Re
velli, the leading Cardinal scorer
(20.6) and rebounder (8.9). The
junior center will be able to work
effectively inside on the smaller
and less physical Beaver front
line.
