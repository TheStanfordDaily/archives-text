# Invaders give offer to Elway
## 
### Associated Press 
Oakland â€” Stanford All-
America quarterback John
Elway said yesterday he already
has seen a five-year contract
offer from the Oakland Invad
ers, "and we're pleased with
what they put in front of us."
The Invaders, the United
States Football League team
with territorial rights to Elway,
made the contract offer last week
in a meeting with the Stanford
star and his father, San Jose State
Coach Jack Elway.
No other details of the con
tract have been revealed. Elway
said, "We're definitely consider
ing it," but he was frank in ad
ding that several things were
working against the USFL.
"It would eliminate the option
of playing in the National Foot
ball League and it would also
eliminate the option to do other
things. I would have to forego
baseball."
Elway is expected to be the
first player selected in the NFL
draft in late April. He played
baseball in the New York Yan
kees' farm system last summer.
In the USFL draft, the Invad
ers' top three picks were
linebacker Billy Ray Smith of
Arkansas, wide receiver Glen
Young of Mississippi State and .
offensive tackle Dan Lutz of
Georgia Tech.
The Invaders also announced
the signing of former NFL back
Delvin Williams, who had two
1200-yard rushing seasons in
cluding one with the San Fran
cisco 49ers.
