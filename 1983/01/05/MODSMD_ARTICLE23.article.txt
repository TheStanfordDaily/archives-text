## Dome dooms Candlestick 
### 
Old man 'Stick is sick, dying, near death, but
the charade goes on.
His heart will quit, his lungs won't pump and
his army of corpuscles will move to run
elsewhere.
Doctors are saying it is not official, but the
symptoms trace the route of similar deaths in

Seattle and Minneapolis.
Old man 'Stick's obituary was
written prematurely when the im
portant people in San Francisco'
decided to allot $300,000 to "look
into" a proposed domed stadium.
There is no stopping death now.
It's a tired cliche by now, but

politics is once again running the business of
sport in the name of big business.
The city wants a domed stadium because big
business wants a domed stadium. The ground
has been set for a groundbreaking.

The Sporting Muse

That's the way it happened in Minneapolis.
Fans and taxpayers hated the idea of a domed
stadium. Viking fans were proud of their stigma
as the hardiest of a hardy sort on those wintry,
snowy afternoons at the Met. One year they
sent two tons of snow in a refrigerated truck to
accompany the Vikings on the sideline in their
playoff game against the Cowboys.
And there are no nicer days than those lazy
ones of mid-July in Minnesota — even when
spent watching the Twinkies. I can remember
squinting into the setting sun and momentarily
losing sight of the flight of Harmon Killebrew's
500 th home run.
Domes are also, as you might imagine, very
expensive to build and taxes usually foot the
bill. A liquor tax has proven successful.
But business benefits and some think the
economy does too. In the domed stadium busi
ness, business has never lost. Every time they're
told there is a chance of plopping a huge
aquarium downtown, they get it.
There will be a show for a couple of years.
Discussions of feasibility could last for as long as
five years, but certainly not more than that.
Businessmen are not real patient and within five
years will chew up the 49ers and Giants and

plant them downtown in an inflated, opulent
racquetball court.
Watching ballgames in the domes is really not
much fun, but the thought of it makes
businessmen's eyes clear and wide, like the ones
on currency.
There is reportedly some doubt as to where it
will be, but the Sad Francisfoam Dome will be
downtown. That's really only the only place
where it will help anyone.
I know my way around a supply-and-demand
curve about as well as I know my way around
the Himalayas, but I know which way is up. And
I know a downtown dome will supply a demand
for downtown restaurants and bars.
That's why most indoor ballgames are at
night. Dinner, game, drinks — dollars — get it?
Of course, they'll remind us how cold Old
Man 'Stick is, though I always thought it quite
cozy under my blanket with my thermos. They' 11
tell us how bad the turf is — there is nothing so
beautiful as uniform green carpet laid over per
fectly smooth concrete.
Eventually, they'll convince us that the dome
is for us — comfort, convenience — and we'll
believe it, maybe even adjust, and we'll keep
buying tickets.
It will still be kind of fun, but we'll miss Old
Man 'Stick. Today and tomorrow will be the
good ol' days. Sit in a dome once, it doesn't
matter which one, you'll miss Old Man 'Stick.
We'll eat downtown and we'll buy drinks and
we won't think anything about it. The scheme
works well and someone will make money.
The fans will come, but they won't be the
same. They'll wear ties to the ball park and
bring dates (nothing ruins a ball game like a
date) and it will be white-collar haven.
Sport, the ultimate barrier breaker, where
every single fan in the park has one thing in
common, one team in common, will just have to
be a little classier while it's downtown.
Ball clubs will still be there to love, but don't
bring a blanket, or sunglasses, or even a hat.
Bring your wife and your opera pumps.
You might bring a crossword puzzle. Ball
games really only come to life in nature. Aes
thetically, in the San Francisfoam Dome, wear
ing a tie, they'll seem rather dull.

But business benefits and some think the
economy does too. In the domed stadium busi
ness, business has never lost. Every time they're
told there is a chance of plopping a huge
aquarium downtown, they get it.
There will be a show for a couple of years.
Discussions of feasibility could last for as long as
five years, but certainly not more than that.
Businessmen are not real patient and within five
years will chew up the 49ers and Giants and

plant them downtown in an inflated, opulent
racquetball court.
Watching ballgames in the domes is really not
much fun, but the thought of it makes
businessmen's eyes clear and wide, like the ones
on currency.
There is reportedly some doubt as to where it
will be, but the Sad Francisfoam Dome will be
downtown. That's really only the only place
where it will help anyone.
I know my way around a supply-and-demand
curve about as well as I know my way around
the Himalayas, but I know which way is up. And
I know a downtown dome will supply a demand
for downtown restaurants and bars.
That's why most indoor ballgames are at
night. Dinner, game, drinks — dollars — get it?
Of course, they'll remind us how cold Old
Man 'Stick is, though I always thought it quite
cozy under my blanket with my thermos. They' 11
tell us how bad the turf is — there is nothing so
beautiful as uniform green carpet laid over per
fectly smooth concrete.
Eventually, they'll convince us that the dome
is for us — comfort, convenience — and we'll
believe it, maybe even adjust, and we'll keep
buying tickets.
It will still be kind of fun, but we'll miss Old
Man 'Stick. Today and tomorrow will be the
good ol' days. Sit in a dome once, it doesn't
matter which one, you'll miss Old Man 'Stick.
We'll eat downtown and we'll buy drinks and
we won't think anything about it. The scheme
works well and someone will make money.
The fans will come, but they won't be the
same. They'll wear ties to the ball park and
bring dates (nothing ruins a ball game like a
date) and it will be white-collar haven.
Sport, the ultimate barrier breaker, where
every single fan in the park has one thing in
common, one team in common, will just have to
be a little classier while it's downtown.
Ball clubs will still be there to love, but don't
bring a blanket, or sunglasses, or even a hat.
Bring your wife and your opera pumps.
You might bring a crossword puzzle. Ball
games really only come to life in nature. Aes
thetically, in the San Francisfoam Dome, wear
ing a tie, they'll seem rather dull.
