# Redskins' Gibbs is Coach of the Year

### Associated Press 
Washington â€” Coach Joe Gibbs, who led the National Football
League's Washington Redskins to their best finish in 42 years, was
named Coach of the Year yesterday by The Associated Press.
In a nationwide poll of sports writers and broadcasters, Gibbs
outdistanced Oakland Raiders coach Tom Flores to capture the
coaching honor.
Gibbs received 49 of the 84 votes cast. Flores received 14 votes and
Dallas coach Tom Landry finished third with six votes. Don Shula of
Miami, Jim Hanifan of St. Louis and Leeman Bennett of Atlanta
each received two votes.
An overnight success 20 years in the making, Gibbs said the award
is a "dream come true."
"There were times as an assistant when I wondered whether I
would ever become a head coach in the NFL," Gibbs admitted.
Gibbs spent 18 years as an assistant coach on both the collegiate
and pro level before replacing Jack Pardee as head coach of the
Redskins last year.
His first team, beset by injuries, lost its first five games. A reversal
in mid-season which saw the team win eight of its last 11 set the stage
for this year's success story.
"We take away something from each of our experiences, even
losses," Gibbs said of those first dark days as head coach. "I learned a
lot about myself when the team started off so poorly. I learned a lot
about my coaching staff, too."
Since their first victory in 1981, Gibbs has guided the Redskins to a
16-4 record over the last two years.
The team finished the strike-shortened 1982 regular season atop
the National Football Conference with an 8-1 record, their best
percentage since their 10-1 campaign of 1942, the year of their last
NFL championship.
Gibbs refuses to take all the credit for his team's success. "I just
point them in the right direction," he insists.
Gibbs came to the Redskins with a reputation as an offensive
minded coach, having served as offensive coordinator for Don
Coryell's pass-happy San Diego Chargers. In Washington, Gibbs has
remained innovative but has molded his offense around the running
of both John Riggins and Joe Washington.
Gibbs is the third Redskin coach to garner the Coach of the Year
award in the last 10 years, George Allen and Pardee having pro
ceeded him.
Noting that both Allen and Pardee were sacked within a few years
of winning the award, Gibbs smiled and said: "As great as it is to
receive the award, it doesn't look like it carries a lot of weight with the
front office here. I wonder if acceptance is mandatory."
