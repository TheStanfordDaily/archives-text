# Rams and Chiefs fire coaches
## 
### Associated Press 
Ray Malavasi of the Los Angeles Rams
and Marv Levy of the Kansas Gty Chiefs
were fired as head coaches of their respec
tive National Football League teams, it
was announced in separate statements
yesterday.
Malavasi led the Rams to the Super
Bowl in 1980 but had losing seasons the
last two years.
Rams' owner Georgia Frontiere said in
a prepared statement: "We are indebted
to Ray for some fine seasons of football.
He helped us into the playoffs three times,
won two division championships and
coached our first Super Bowl team. Un
fortunately, the results of the past two
seasons have fallen short of our goal to
give our fans a winning team.
"I have a strong personal feeling of
friendship for Ray. He is a fine and loyal
person. However, I feel for the sake of our
fans, it is time to make a change."
The Rams finished this strike
interrupted season 2-7 after going 6-10 in
1981. Malavasi had steered them to a re
cord of 12-4 after becoming the head
coach in 1978, then 9-7 in 1979 and 11-5
in 1980.
Malavasi, whose team was hit hard by
injuries this year, earlier this season was
reported to be on the way out.
He had said Monday, however, "I ex
pect we'll have meetings during the next

week to start making plans for next year,
with the draft our No. 1 area. I definitely
feel we can turn things around with the
same staff, the guys we have coming back
and help from the draft."
Telephone calls to Malavasi's home
and office Tuesday went unanswered.
Malavasi, 52, was elevated from an as
sistant's job to the head coaching job
when George AUen was fired abruptly in
the 1978 preseason. Carroll Rosenbloom,
the late Rams' owner, had hired Allen in
February of that year but dismissed him
after two exhibition losses.
Before falling to losing seasons the past
two campaigns, the Rams had won seven
consecutive division titles, including two
under Malavasi. The 1979 club is the only
Rams team to make it to the Super Bowl,
where they lost 31-19 to Pittsburgh in the
1980 NFL title game.
The Chiefs' Levy was fired because he
failed to get the long-downtrodden Na
tional Football League franchise into the
playoffs, the owner and the general man
ager said.
"That is the harshness of this business,"
said owner Lamar Hunt, who found him
self in the awkward position of explaining
why he would fire Levy less than a month
after saying he expected to retain him.
"There are more coaches who fail than
succeed,'' Hunt said." We made an evalu
ation. We asked ourselves if we could

reasonably hope to get into the playoffs
next year under the present coaching situ
ation. Our evaluation was, no, we really
don't believe we'll be in the playoffs."
Levy's dismissal also was surprising in
light of comments by general manager
Jack Steadman, who on Nov. 30 said, "I
think Marv and his staff are doing an ex
cellent job."
Levy's five-year record was 31-42, in
cluding a 9-7 mark in 1981 for their first
winning season since 1972. The Chiefs
lost their first four post-strike games this
year, however, and fell to 3-6.
"I was given an opportunity here by
Lamar Hunt," Levy said in an interview
with ABC Radio Sports. "I appreciate
having that opportunity. I do have feel
ings, not of animosity, but disappoint
ment. We spent five hard years here build
ing things up, and for the first time we had
a year when we backslid a little bit."
Levy is the fourth head coach the
Chiefs have fired since they last made the
playoffs in 1971. Hank Stram, who
coached the team to the Super Bowl
championship in January, 1970, was dis
missed following the 1974 season. The ax
fell on his replacement, Paul Wiggin,
midway through the 1977 season, and
Tom Bettis, the only holdover from the
Stram staff, was named on an interim
basis.
