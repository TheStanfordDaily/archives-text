GOP leaders urge Reagan to cut defense budget
Washington — Senate Republican leaders told President Reagan yester
day that the prospect of "terrifying" budget deficits requires reductions in
the administration's J 1.6 trillion five-year defense budget as well as in
domestic spending programs.
But Sen. Paul Laxalt (R-Nev.), Reagan's closest adviser on Capitol Hill,
said the president was not "very enthusiastic" about defense cuts when the
subject was raised during a 90-minute White House session.
"He's very close to being in concrete on the defense issue," said Laxalt,
whom Reagan chose after the election as general chairman of the Re
publican Party.
"I have a suspicion ... that we in Congress have a lot of selling to do" to
convince the president, he added.
The deficit was the principal topic of the president's meeting with the GOP
leaders, Laxalt said. The senator called the budget figures "a little terrify
ing," an indication of a "huge and probably intolerable" deficit. He gave no
figures, explaining that "no one's made any firm decisions."
Administration sources have estimated that the deficit will
reach almost $200 billion in the 1984 fiscal year that begins Oct. 1
unless there are budget reductions or tax increases. The presi
dent's continued stand against defense cuts appeared to foreclose
the largest potential area for reductions. Reagan will submit his
1984 budget to Congress on Jan. 31.
Meanwhile, Peter Davis, an economist on the staff of the Sen
ate Budget Committee, predicted that the deficit in the fiscal year
will reach $220 billion and he predicted that Congress will raise
Social Security taxes to help trim it.
"We will have a tax increase in 1983," Davis, the committee's
senior economist for tax analysis, told a meeting of the National
Economists Club,"and it probably will be a Social Security tax
increase."
The Social Security payroll tax is now 6.7 percent on both em
ployees and employers. There have been proposals to accelerate
the present schedule of increases. Under present law, the tax will
climb to 7.65 percent by 1990.
Although administration officials said Monday that the presi
dent will ask Congress to trim non-defense spending by $30
billion in fiscal 1984, Laxalt said Reagan "hasn't settled on
that."
Israel claims Soviets aiding Syria
Jerusalem — In an unusual announcement, the Israeli military
command said yesterday it has learned that Syria is constructing
two bases for Soviet-made SA-5 ground-to-air missile batteries <
"deep within Syrian territory" and that Israel will continue to
"follow developments concerning missile batteries."
The announcement did not claim that the missile batteries
pose a threat to Israel, and civilian and military officials con
ceded Syria's right to install ground-to-air missiles in its own ter
ritory. The announcement appeared to have a partially political
objective in reiterating that Syrian air defenses, although badly
mauled by the Israeli Air Force during the war in Lebanon, are
being rebuilt by the Soviet Union.
According to Israeli sources, there is a concern here that Syria,
once it is rearmed by the Soviet Union, will have lesi incentive to
withdraw its troops from Lebanon, which Israel in turn is de
manding as one condition of its own withdrawal from southern
Lebanon.
Israel also is eager to remind the world, and particularly its
own main arms supplier, the United States, that although the
Syrians were defeated in Lebanon they have not been abandoned
by the Soviet Union and are restockpiling sophisticated weapons
with Soviet assistance.
According to a military spokesman, the SA-5 was developed
by the Soviet Union during the 1960s and has not appeared out
side Soviet borders before. The missile has a range of close to 200
miles, putting it within striking distance of Israeli air space, but is
less modern and sophisticated than some of the Soviet-built
ground-to-air missile systems that the Israelis defeated during
the war in Lebanon.
Social Security may include gov't workers
Washington — A draft report by the president's Social Secur
ity advisory commission recommends bringing into the system
all future federal employees and ail current federal employees
with less than five years of government service.
It also recommends removing Social Security from the federal
budget as a way of insulating Social Security tax and benefit de
cisions from future budget politics.
The draft, prepared by the commission staff, is meant to reflect
all points of agreement reached so far. If commission Re
publicans and Democrats can reconcile other differences by their
Jan. \ 5 reporting date, it could change.
At this point, however, inclusion of federal employees is the
only major step on which the two sides have been able to agree to
raise the $150 billion to $200 billion they say is needed to keep
Social Security solvent over the next seven years.
Some combination of tax increases and benefit curtailments
presumably will be required to raise the rest, but there are dif
ferences over what the mix should be.
Most Democrats on the 15-member commission favor raising
most of the money by beginning Social Security tax increases
scheduled for 1985, 1986 and 1990 next year. Most of the Re
publicans would rely mainly on benefit cuts, including curtail
ment of the cost-of-living increases that now go automatically to
beneficiaries each year.
Several commission members, including Chairman Alan
Greenspan, have said they doubt the commission can agree un
less some agreement first is reached by President Reagan and
House Speaker Thomas "Tip" O'Neill (D-Mass). But there have
been no signs of that, and a request by one member that the com
mission meet again before Jan. 15 was turned down Monday by a
majority of the members as fruitless.
Texas Congressman to change parties
Washington — Texas Rep. Phil Gramm, who once said he did
not know any Republicans until he was an adult, apparently will
become one today.
Gramm, whose ouster from from his seat on the House Budget
Committee was recommended Monday by the Democratic
Steering Commission, is expected to announce this morning at a

press conference at his district office in Bryan, Texas, that he will
resign from his House seat, change parties and run in a special
election as a Republican for the same seat.
Gramm refused to comment before his scheduled announc
ment, but a spokesman for House Republican Leader Robert
Michel (R-lll.) said that he had "very good information" that
Gramm had decided to switch.
Gramm, a member of a group of conservative Democrats
known as "boll weevils" and a key supporter of Reagan adminis
tration budget proposals in the 97th Congress, will be embraced
by his newly adopted party.
Michel announced yesterday that the House Republican
Committee on Committees would recommend that a Budget
Committee seat be reserved for Gramm if he enters the House as
a Republican.
"The action of the Democratic Policy and Steering Committee
to seek Congressman Gramm's expulsion from the Budget Com
mittee is a grievous assault on the right of an individual member
to represent the views of his constituents as honestly and openly
as possible," Michel said. "Should Congressman Gramm ...
seek membership in our ranks, we are ready to give him and his
constituents the opportunities they deserve."
Gramm is not required by law to seek a special election once he
changes parties. He could simply announce the change and save
his constituents the cost of another election.
Gramm was crucial in helping to forge congressional alliances
for the White House in achieving its early budget victories on
Capitol Hill. Seeking to punish him, the Democratic Steering
and Policy Committee voted 26 to 4 Monday to remove him
from the Budget Committee. Fellow Democrats and the House
as a whole must vote on the issue, but concurrence is likely.
EPA cancels private lawyers for Gorsuch
Washington — The Environmental Protection Agency last
night abruptly canceled plans to hire private lawyers at a cost of
as much as $70,000 to help defend Administrator Anne Gorsuch
against a contempt-of-Congress charge, hours after the move
was questioned by the White House and a House subcommittee.
In addition, it was learned yesterday, the law firm the EPA had
intended to hire represented a company the agency is prosecuting
in an administrative proceeding for discharging toxic wastes into
the harbor of New Bedford, Mass.
The Boston firm of Ropes & Gray represented Aerovox Inc., a
defendant in a case arising from a New Bedford hazardous-waste
site ranked bv the EPA as one of the 160 most dangerous in the
country and by Massachusetts officials as the worst in the state,
EPA spokesman Byron Nelson confirmed.
According to several administration sources, the Aerovox link
was viewed as potential political dynamite. Certain documents
from its case are among hundreds Gorsuch refused to turn over
to the House after they were subpoenaed last month, calling
them too "sensitive" to be released without jeopardizing agency
prosecutions.
Under orders from President Reagan, Gorsuch invoked ex
ecutive privilege and withheld the papers. The House responded
by citing her for contempt on a lopsided, bipartisan vote of 259 to
105, the first time in history that the charge was lodged against a
Cabinet-level official.
Nelson said the decision to break off negotiations with Ropes
& Gray had nothing to do with the firm's ties to Aerovox, which
he said were unknown to the EPA until yesterday, or with ques
tions raised by White House counsel Fred Fielding and a House
subcommittee about the propriety of hiring outside lawyers.
Reagan signs orphan drug bill
Washington — Despite conflicting advice, President Reagan
yesterday signed a bill giving tax breaks to pharmaceutical com
panies that develop drugs to treat rare diseases, the White House
announced. Nt .
Reagan had held off making a decision on the bill, which
would have died at midnight tonight without his signature.
Amid reports that Reagan planned to veto the legislation
passed unanimously by Congress, several organizations
mounted a lobbying campaign to convince the president to sign
it.
In a telephone interview before the signature, Rep. Henry
Waxman, (D-Calif.) the measure's House sponsor, said the
White House was "flooded with phone calls and I hope that will
make a difference. Certainly there are millions of people that are
going to feel betrayed if the president vetoes this bill."
A White House aide refused to say how many calls had been
received.
The legislation would give tax breaks worth $75 million to the
pharmaceutical industry over the next five years to encourage de
velopment of drugs that would not otherwise be economical to
produce because a relatively small number of people need them.
The bill also would give drug companies a seven-year exclusive
marketing period for drugs that are not patentable and give them
a tax write-off of 73 cents on the dollar for expenses of human
testing.
Habib to return to Mideast negiotiations
Washington — Special envoy Philip Habib was summoned
here yesterday as the Reagan administration prepared a new
drive to break a stalemate in Israeli-Lebanese negotiations, and
thus clear the way for a broader settlement in the Mideast.
State Department sources said growing U.S. concern about

lack of progress in the week-old negotiations prompted the de
cision to call Habib back from a Florida vacation for policy
making meetings. The sources said it is likely that Habib will fly
to the Mideast within a few days in an effort to break the dead
lock.
It took the active intercession of Habib and his deputy, Am
bassador Morris Draper, to set up the Israeli-Lebanese talks that
began a week ago yesterday. The main objective, in the U.S.
view, is to arrange the basis for a prompt departure of Israeli
forces from Lebanon.
Israel's central objectives, however, are to win a form of nor
malized relations with Lebanon and to create a demilitarized se
curity zone near the Lebanese-Israeli border.
Lebanese negotiators so far have refused to place nor
malization of relations with Israel on the negotiating agenda be
cause of concern that such arrangements with the Jewish state
would imperil Lebanese relations with Arab nations.
Congress tries to end bankruptcy law stall
Washington — Congress — after missing two deadlines — is
moving to break a legal impasse over the nation's bankruptcy
law that has left hundreds of thousands of cases in confusion at a
time when business failures are increasing amid the current eco
nomic distress.
Rep. Peter Rodino (D-N.J.), chairman of the House Judiciary
Committee, introduced legislation on Monday to bring the
bankruptcy system into compliance with a Supreme Court de
cision of last June 28.
In that ruling, the Court declared that the 227 federal
bankruptcy judges could not constitutionally exercisc the broad
powers that Congress had granted them when it revised the
bankruptcy laws in 1978.
Specifically, it said bankruptcy judges could not decide non
bankruptcy issues even when they involved companies with
bankruptcy cases before those judges. In effect, the court said the
judges' powers must be curtailed or they must be given the pro
tection of lifetime tenure had by other federal judges.
The court delayed the effectiveness of its ruling until Oct. 4 and
later granted a stay until Christmas Eve. But on Dec. 23 it refused
a request to further stay the ruling to give Congress until March
25 to restructure the bankruptcy courts.
Pentagon to revamp Tomahawk program
Washington — Pentagon officials promised yesterday a major
shakeup of the troubled Tomahawk cruise missile program,
which they said has fallen up to two years behind schedule be
cause of poor management and engineering problems.
A Pentagon official indicated that the program will be restruc
tured "to place a higher degree of emphasis on management and
engineering."
Officials of the General Dynamics Corp., which produces the
missile at its Convair division in San Diego, would not discuss
the shakeup, but a company official said "there is no talk at all
about dropping us out of the program."
A Pentagon official who discussed the troubled Tomahawk
program on the condition that he not be identified said design
and production of the missile had been hobbled by the fact that
"nobody was ultimately responsible for seeing that the whole
thing was put together properly."
As a result, both the anti-ship version of the Tomahawk and
the land attack version have performed well below standards, he
said.
Government may spray paraquat again
Washington — The federal government is ready to help Col
ombia and other countries destroy their marijuana crops with
the weed-killer paraquat, claiming that could cut U.S. marijuana
imports by 70 percent.
But an official of a pro-marijuana organization predicted yes
terday that destroying foreign sources of marijuana with para
quat would be a boon to domestic growers.
Paraquat once was thought to be harmful to human lungs if
smoked inadvertently, but the State Department said there is no
evidence any marijuana smoker has been harmed and that the
risk is "virtually non-existent."
But George Farnham of the National Organization for Re
form of Marijuana Laws — known as NORML — said paraquat
is one of the most poisonous herbicides and that there has been
little or no research into its long-term health effects.
Congress lifted a three-year ban against foreign paraquat op
erations in late 1981.
Stocks up in market recovery
The stock market staged a broad recovery yesterday, reversing
Monday's late selloff and demonstrating that the start of a new
year has failed to dampen trading volatility.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 3.03 points in
the opening hour, spurted up 19.04 points at 1046.08 by the clos
ing bell. The blue-chip average gained back almost all of the
ground it lost in its 19.50-point slide Monday.
Today's weather

Social Security taxes to help trim it.
"We will have a tax increase in 1983," Davis, the committee's
senior economist for tax analysis, told a meeting of the National
Economists Club,"and it probably will be a Social Security tax
increase."
The Social Security payroll tax is now 6.7 percent on both em
ployees and employers. There have been proposals to accelerate
the present schedule of increases. Under present law, the tax will
climb to 7.65 percent by 1990.
Although administration officials said Monday that the presi
dent will ask Congress to trim non-defense spending by $30
billion in fiscal 1984, Laxalt said Reagan "hasn't settled on
that."
Israel claims Soviets aiding Syria
Jerusalem — In an unusual announcement, the Israeli military
command said yesterday it has learned that Syria is constructing
two bases for Soviet-made SA-5 ground-to-air missile batteries <
"deep within Syrian territory" and that Israel will continue to
"follow developments concerning missile batteries."
The announcement did not claim that the missile batteries
pose a threat to Israel, and civilian and military officials con
ceded Syria's right to install ground-to-air missiles in its own ter
ritory. The announcement appeared to have a partially political
objective in reiterating that Syrian air defenses, although badly
mauled by the Israeli Air Force during the war in Lebanon, are
being rebuilt by the Soviet Union.
According to Israeli sources, there is a concern here that Syria,
once it is rearmed by the Soviet Union, will have lesi incentive to
withdraw its troops from Lebanon, which Israel in turn is de
manding as one condition of its own withdrawal from southern
Lebanon.
Israel also is eager to remind the world, and particularly its
own main arms supplier, the United States, that although the
Syrians were defeated in Lebanon they have not been abandoned
by the Soviet Union and are restockpiling sophisticated weapons
with Soviet assistance.
According to a military spokesman, the SA-5 was developed
by the Soviet Union during the 1960s and has not appeared out
side Soviet borders before. The missile has a range of close to 200
miles, putting it within striking distance of Israeli air space, but is
less modern and sophisticated than some of the Soviet-built
ground-to-air missile systems that the Israelis defeated during
the war in Lebanon.
Social Security may include gov't workers
Washington — A draft report by the president's Social Secur
ity advisory commission recommends bringing into the system
all future federal employees and ail current federal employees
with less than five years of government service.
It also recommends removing Social Security from the federal
budget as a way of insulating Social Security tax and benefit de
cisions from future budget politics.
The draft, prepared by the commission staff, is meant to reflect
all points of agreement reached so far. If commission Re
publicans and Democrats can reconcile other differences by their
Jan. \ 5 reporting date, it could change.
At this point, however, inclusion of federal employees is the
only major step on which the two sides have been able to agree to
raise the $150 billion to $200 billion they say is needed to keep
Social Security solvent over the next seven years.
Some combination of tax increases and benefit curtailments
presumably will be required to raise the rest, but there are dif
ferences over what the mix should be.
Most Democrats on the 15-member commission favor raising
most of the money by beginning Social Security tax increases
scheduled for 1985, 1986 and 1990 next year. Most of the Re
publicans would rely mainly on benefit cuts, including curtail
ment of the cost-of-living increases that now go automatically to
beneficiaries each year.
Several commission members, including Chairman Alan
Greenspan, have said they doubt the commission can agree un
less some agreement first is reached by President Reagan and
House Speaker Thomas "Tip" O'Neill (D-Mass). But there have
been no signs of that, and a request by one member that the com
mission meet again before Jan. 15 was turned down Monday by a
majority of the members as fruitless.
Texas Congressman to change parties
Washington — Texas Rep. Phil Gramm, who once said he did
not know any Republicans until he was an adult, apparently will
become one today.
Gramm, whose ouster from from his seat on the House Budget
Committee was recommended Monday by the Democratic
Steering Commission, is expected to announce this morning at a

press conference at his district office in Bryan, Texas, that he will
resign from his House seat, change parties and run in a special
election as a Republican for the same seat.
Gramm refused to comment before his scheduled announc
ment, but a spokesman for House Republican Leader Robert
Michel (R-lll.) said that he had "very good information" that
Gramm had decided to switch.
Gramm, a member of a group of conservative Democrats
known as "boll weevils" and a key supporter of Reagan adminis
tration budget proposals in the 97th Congress, will be embraced
by his newly adopted party.
Michel announced yesterday that the House Republican
Committee on Committees would recommend that a Budget
Committee seat be reserved for Gramm if he enters the House as
a Republican.
"The action of the Democratic Policy and Steering Committee
to seek Congressman Gramm's expulsion from the Budget Com
mittee is a grievous assault on the right of an individual member
to represent the views of his constituents as honestly and openly
as possible," Michel said. "Should Congressman Gramm ...
seek membership in our ranks, we are ready to give him and his
constituents the opportunities they deserve."
Gramm is not required by law to seek a special election once he
changes parties. He could simply announce the change and save
his constituents the cost of another election.
Gramm was crucial in helping to forge congressional alliances
for the White House in achieving its early budget victories on
Capitol Hill. Seeking to punish him, the Democratic Steering
and Policy Committee voted 26 to 4 Monday to remove him
from the Budget Committee. Fellow Democrats and the House
as a whole must vote on the issue, but concurrence is likely.
EPA cancels private lawyers for Gorsuch
Washington — The Environmental Protection Agency last
night abruptly canceled plans to hire private lawyers at a cost of
as much as $70,000 to help defend Administrator Anne Gorsuch
against a contempt-of-Congress charge, hours after the move
was questioned by the White House and a House subcommittee.
In addition, it was learned yesterday, the law firm the EPA had
intended to hire represented a company the agency is prosecuting
in an administrative proceeding for discharging toxic wastes into
the harbor of New Bedford, Mass.
The Boston firm of Ropes & Gray represented Aerovox Inc., a
defendant in a case arising from a New Bedford hazardous-waste
site ranked bv the EPA as one of the 160 most dangerous in the
country and by Massachusetts officials as the worst in the state,
EPA spokesman Byron Nelson confirmed.
According to several administration sources, the Aerovox link
was viewed as potential political dynamite. Certain documents
from its case are among hundreds Gorsuch refused to turn over
to the House after they were subpoenaed last month, calling
them too "sensitive" to be released without jeopardizing agency
prosecutions.
Under orders from President Reagan, Gorsuch invoked ex
ecutive privilege and withheld the papers. The House responded
by citing her for contempt on a lopsided, bipartisan vote of 259 to
105, the first time in history that the charge was lodged against a
Cabinet-level official.
Nelson said the decision to break off negotiations with Ropes
& Gray had nothing to do with the firm's ties to Aerovox, which
he said were unknown to the EPA until yesterday, or with ques
tions raised by White House counsel Fred Fielding and a House
subcommittee about the propriety of hiring outside lawyers.
Reagan signs orphan drug bill
Washington — Despite conflicting advice, President Reagan
yesterday signed a bill giving tax breaks to pharmaceutical com
panies that develop drugs to treat rare diseases, the White House
announced. Nt .
Reagan had held off making a decision on the bill, which
would have died at midnight tonight without his signature.
Amid reports that Reagan planned to veto the legislation
passed unanimously by Congress, several organizations
mounted a lobbying campaign to convince the president to sign
it.
In a telephone interview before the signature, Rep. Henry
Waxman, (D-Calif.) the measure's House sponsor, said the
White House was "flooded with phone calls and I hope that will
make a difference. Certainly there are millions of people that are
going to feel betrayed if the president vetoes this bill."
A White House aide refused to say how many calls had been
received.
The legislation would give tax breaks worth $75 million to the
pharmaceutical industry over the next five years to encourage de
velopment of drugs that would not otherwise be economical to
produce because a relatively small number of people need them.
The bill also would give drug companies a seven-year exclusive
marketing period for drugs that are not patentable and give them
a tax write-off of 73 cents on the dollar for expenses of human
testing.
Habib to return to Mideast negiotiations
Washington — Special envoy Philip Habib was summoned
here yesterday as the Reagan administration prepared a new
drive to break a stalemate in Israeli-Lebanese negotiations, and
thus clear the way for a broader settlement in the Mideast.
State Department sources said growing U.S. concern about

lack of progress in the week-old negotiations prompted the de
cision to call Habib back from a Florida vacation for policy
making meetings. The sources said it is likely that Habib will fly
to the Mideast within a few days in an effort to break the dead
lock.
It took the active intercession of Habib and his deputy, Am
bassador Morris Draper, to set up the Israeli-Lebanese talks that
began a week ago yesterday. The main objective, in the U.S.
view, is to arrange the basis for a prompt departure of Israeli
forces from Lebanon.
Israel's central objectives, however, are to win a form of nor
malized relations with Lebanon and to create a demilitarized se
curity zone near the Lebanese-Israeli border.
Lebanese negotiators so far have refused to place nor
malization of relations with Israel on the negotiating agenda be
cause of concern that such arrangements with the Jewish state
would imperil Lebanese relations with Arab nations.
Congress tries to end bankruptcy law stall
Washington — Congress — after missing two deadlines — is
moving to break a legal impasse over the nation's bankruptcy
law that has left hundreds of thousands of cases in confusion at a
time when business failures are increasing amid the current eco
nomic distress.
Rep. Peter Rodino (D-N.J.), chairman of the House Judiciary
Committee, introduced legislation on Monday to bring the
bankruptcy system into compliance with a Supreme Court de
cision of last June 28.
In that ruling, the Court declared that the 227 federal
bankruptcy judges could not constitutionally exercisc the broad
powers that Congress had granted them when it revised the
bankruptcy laws in 1978.
Specifically, it said bankruptcy judges could not decide non
bankruptcy issues even when they involved companies with
bankruptcy cases before those judges. In effect, the court said the
judges' powers must be curtailed or they must be given the pro
tection of lifetime tenure had by other federal judges.
The court delayed the effectiveness of its ruling until Oct. 4 and
later granted a stay until Christmas Eve. But on Dec. 23 it refused
a request to further stay the ruling to give Congress until March
25 to restructure the bankruptcy courts.
Pentagon to revamp Tomahawk program
Washington — Pentagon officials promised yesterday a major
shakeup of the troubled Tomahawk cruise missile program,
which they said has fallen up to two years behind schedule be
cause of poor management and engineering problems.
A Pentagon official indicated that the program will be restruc
tured "to place a higher degree of emphasis on management and
engineering."
Officials of the General Dynamics Corp., which produces the
missile at its Convair division in San Diego, would not discuss
the shakeup, but a company official said "there is no talk at all
about dropping us out of the program."
A Pentagon official who discussed the troubled Tomahawk
program on the condition that he not be identified said design
and production of the missile had been hobbled by the fact that
"nobody was ultimately responsible for seeing that the whole
thing was put together properly."
As a result, both the anti-ship version of the Tomahawk and
the land attack version have performed well below standards, he
said.
Government may spray paraquat again
Washington — The federal government is ready to help Col
ombia and other countries destroy their marijuana crops with
the weed-killer paraquat, claiming that could cut U.S. marijuana
imports by 70 percent.
But an official of a pro-marijuana organization predicted yes
terday that destroying foreign sources of marijuana with para
quat would be a boon to domestic growers.
Paraquat once was thought to be harmful to human lungs if
smoked inadvertently, but the State Department said there is no
evidence any marijuana smoker has been harmed and that the
risk is "virtually non-existent."
But George Farnham of the National Organization for Re
form of Marijuana Laws — known as NORML — said paraquat
is one of the most poisonous herbicides and that there has been
little or no research into its long-term health effects.
Congress lifted a three-year ban against foreign paraquat op
erations in late 1981.
Stocks up in market recovery
The stock market staged a broad recovery yesterday, reversing
Monday's late selloff and demonstrating that the start of a new
year has failed to dampen trading volatility.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 3.03 points in
the opening hour, spurted up 19.04 points at 1046.08 by the clos
ing bell. The blue-chip average gained back almost all of the
ground it lost in its 19.50-point slide Monday.

GOP leaders urge Reagan to cut defense budget
Washington — Senate Republican leaders told President Reagan yester
day that the prospect of "terrifying" budget deficits requires reductions in
the administration's J 1.6 trillion five-year defense budget as well as in
domestic spending programs.
But Sen. Paul Laxalt (R-Nev.), Reagan's closest adviser on Capitol Hill,
said the president was not "very enthusiastic" about defense cuts when the
subject was raised during a 90-minute White House session.
"He's very close to being in concrete on the defense issue," said Laxalt,
whom Reagan chose after the election as general chairman of the Re
publican Party.
"I have a suspicion ... that we in Congress have a lot of selling to do" to
convince the president, he added.
The deficit was the principal topic of the president's meeting with the GOP
leaders, Laxalt said. The senator called the budget figures "a little terrify
ing," an indication of a "huge and probably intolerable" deficit. He gave no
figures, explaining that "no one's made any firm decisions."
Administration sources have estimated that the deficit will
reach almost $200 billion in the 1984 fiscal year that begins Oct. 1
unless there are budget reductions or tax increases. The presi
dent's continued stand against defense cuts appeared to foreclose
the largest potential area for reductions. Reagan will submit his
1984 budget to Congress on Jan. 31.
Meanwhile, Peter Davis, an economist on the staff of the Sen
ate Budget Committee, predicted that the deficit in the fiscal year
will reach $220 billion and he predicted that Congress will raise
Social Security taxes to help trim it.
"We will have a tax increase in 1983," Davis, the committee's

manding as one condition of its own withdrawal from southern
Lebanon.
Israel also is eager to remind the world, and particularly its
own main arms supplier, the United States, that although the
Syrians were defeated in Lebanon they have not been abandoned
by the Soviet Union and are restockpiling sophisticated weapons
with Soviet assistance.
According to a military spokesman, the SA-5 was developed
by the Soviet Union during the 1960s and has not appeared out
side Soviet borders before. The missile has a range of close to 200
miles, putting it within striking distance of Israeli air space, but is
less modern and sophisticated than some of the Soviet-built
ground-to-air missile systems that the Israelis defeated during
the war in Lebanon.
Social Security may include gov't workers
Washington — A draft report by the president's Social Secur
ity advisory commission recommends bringing into the system
all future federal employees and ail current federal employees
with less than five years of government service.
It also recommends removing Social Security from the federal
budget as a way of insulating Social Security tax and benefit de
cisions from future budget politics.
The draft, prepared by the commission staff, is meant to reflect
all points of agreement reached so far. If commission Re
publicans and Democrats can reconcile other differences by their
Jan. \ 5 reporting date, it could change.
At this point, however, inclusion of federal employees is the
only major step on which the two sides have been able to agree to
raise the $150 billion to $200 billion they say is needed to keep
Social Security solvent over the next seven years.
Some combination of tax increases and benefit curtailments
presumably will be required to raise the rest, but there are dif
ferences over what the mix should be.
Most Democrats on the 15-member commission favor raising
most of the money by beginning Social Security tax increases
scheduled for 1985, 1986 and 1990 next year. Most of the Re
publicans would rely mainly on benefit cuts, including curtail
ment of the cost-of-living increases that now go automatically to
beneficiaries each year.
Several commission members, including Chairman Alan
Greenspan, have said they doubt the commission can agree un
less some agreement first is reached by President Reagan and
House Speaker Thomas "Tip" O'Neill (D-Mass). But there have
been no signs of that, and a request by one member that the com
mission meet again before Jan. 15 was turned down Monday by a
majority of the members as fruitless.
Texas Congressman to change parties
Washington — Texas Rep. Phil Gramm, who once said he did
not know any Republicans until he was an adult, apparently will
become one today.
Gramm, whose ouster from from his seat on the House Budget
Committee was recommended Monday by the Democratic
Steering Commission, is expected to announce this morning at a

press conference at his district office in Bryan, Texas, that he will
resign from his House seat, change parties and run in a special
election as a Republican for the same seat.
Gramm refused to comment before his scheduled announc
ment, but a spokesman for House Republican Leader Robert
Michel (R-lll.) said that he had "very good information" that
Gramm had decided to switch.
Gramm, a member of a group of conservative Democrats
known as "boll weevils" and a key supporter of Reagan adminis
tration budget proposals in the 97th Congress, will be embraced
by his newly adopted party.
Michel announced yesterday that the House Republican
Committee on Committees would recommend that a Budget
Committee seat be reserved for Gramm if he enters the House as
a Republican.
"The action of the Democratic Policy and Steering Committee
to seek Congressman Gramm's expulsion from the Budget Com
mittee is a grievous assault on the right of an individual member
to represent the views of his constituents as honestly and openly
as possible," Michel said. "Should Congressman Gramm ...
seek membership in our ranks, we are ready to give him and his
constituents the opportunities they deserve."
Gramm is not required by law to seek a special election once he
changes parties. He could simply announce the change and save
his constituents the cost of another election.
Gramm was crucial in helping to forge congressional alliances
for the White House in achieving its early budget victories on
Capitol Hill. Seeking to punish him, the Democratic Steering
and Policy Committee voted 26 to 4 Monday to remove him
from the Budget Committee. Fellow Democrats and the House
as a whole must vote on the issue, but concurrence is likely.
EPA cancels private lawyers for Gorsuch
Washington — The Environmental Protection Agency last
night abruptly canceled plans to hire private lawyers at a cost of
as much as $70,000 to help defend Administrator Anne Gorsuch
against a contempt-of-Congress charge, hours after the move
was questioned by the White House and a House subcommittee.
In addition, it was learned yesterday, the law firm the EPA had
intended to hire represented a company the agency is prosecuting
in an administrative proceeding for discharging toxic wastes into
the harbor of New Bedford, Mass.
The Boston firm of Ropes & Gray represented Aerovox Inc., a
defendant in a case arising from a New Bedford hazardous-waste
site ranked bv the EPA as one of the 160 most dangerous in the
country and by Massachusetts officials as the worst in the state,
EPA spokesman Byron Nelson confirmed.
According to several administration sources, the Aerovox link
was viewed as potential political dynamite. Certain documents
from its case are among hundreds Gorsuch refused to turn over
to the House after they were subpoenaed last month, calling
them too "sensitive" to be released without jeopardizing agency
prosecutions.
Under orders from President Reagan, Gorsuch invoked ex
ecutive privilege and withheld the papers. The House responded
by citing her for contempt on a lopsided, bipartisan vote of 259 to
105, the first time in history that the charge was lodged against a
Cabinet-level official.
Nelson said the decision to break off negotiations with Ropes
& Gray had nothing to do with the firm's ties to Aerovox, which
he said were unknown to the EPA until yesterday, or with ques
tions raised by White House counsel Fred Fielding and a House
subcommittee about the propriety of hiring outside lawyers.
Reagan signs orphan drug bill
Washington — Despite conflicting advice, President Reagan
yesterday signed a bill giving tax breaks to pharmaceutical com
panies that develop drugs to treat rare diseases, the White House
announced. Nt .
Reagan had held off making a decision on the bill, which
would have died at midnight tonight without his signature.
Amid reports that Reagan planned to veto the legislation
passed unanimously by Congress, several organizations
mounted a lobbying campaign to convince the president to sign
it.
In a telephone interview before the signature, Rep. Henry
Waxman, (D-Calif.) the measure's House sponsor, said the
White House was "flooded with phone calls and I hope that will
make a difference. Certainly there are millions of people that are
going to feel betrayed if the president vetoes this bill."
A White House aide refused to say how many calls had been
received.
The legislation would give tax breaks worth $75 million to the
pharmaceutical industry over the next five years to encourage de
velopment of drugs that would not otherwise be economical to
produce because a relatively small number of people need them.
The bill also would give drug companies a seven-year exclusive
marketing period for drugs that are not patentable and give them
a tax write-off of 73 cents on the dollar for expenses of human
testing.
Habib to return to Mideast negiotiations
Washington — Special envoy Philip Habib was summoned
here yesterday as the Reagan administration prepared a new
drive to break a stalemate in Israeli-Lebanese negotiations, and
thus clear the way for a broader settlement in the Mideast.
State Department sources said growing U.S. concern about

lack of progress in the week-old negotiations prompted the de
cision to call Habib back from a Florida vacation for policy
making meetings. The sources said it is likely that Habib will fly
to the Mideast within a few days in an effort to break the dead
lock.
It took the active intercession of Habib and his deputy, Am
bassador Morris Draper, to set up the Israeli-Lebanese talks that
began a week ago yesterday. The main objective, in the U.S.
view, is to arrange the basis for a prompt departure of Israeli
forces from Lebanon.
Israel's central objectives, however, are to win a form of nor
malized relations with Lebanon and to create a demilitarized se
curity zone near the Lebanese-Israeli border.
Lebanese negotiators so far have refused to place nor
malization of relations with Israel on the negotiating agenda be
cause of concern that such arrangements with the Jewish state
would imperil Lebanese relations with Arab nations.
Congress tries to end bankruptcy law stall
Washington — Congress — after missing two deadlines — is
moving to break a legal impasse over the nation's bankruptcy
law that has left hundreds of thousands of cases in confusion at a
time when business failures are increasing amid the current eco
nomic distress.
Rep. Peter Rodino (D-N.J.), chairman of the House Judiciary
Committee, introduced legislation on Monday to bring the
bankruptcy system into compliance with a Supreme Court de
cision of last June 28.
In that ruling, the Court declared that the 227 federal
bankruptcy judges could not constitutionally exercisc the broad
powers that Congress had granted them when it revised the
bankruptcy laws in 1978.
Specifically, it said bankruptcy judges could not decide non
bankruptcy issues even when they involved companies with
bankruptcy cases before those judges. In effect, the court said the
judges' powers must be curtailed or they must be given the pro
tection of lifetime tenure had by other federal judges.
The court delayed the effectiveness of its ruling until Oct. 4 and
later granted a stay until Christmas Eve. But on Dec. 23 it refused
a request to further stay the ruling to give Congress until March
25 to restructure the bankruptcy courts.
Pentagon to revamp Tomahawk program
Washington — Pentagon officials promised yesterday a major
shakeup of the troubled Tomahawk cruise missile program,
which they said has fallen up to two years behind schedule be
cause of poor management and engineering problems.
A Pentagon official indicated that the program will be restruc
tured "to place a higher degree of emphasis on management and
engineering."
Officials of the General Dynamics Corp., which produces the
missile at its Convair division in San Diego, would not discuss
the shakeup, but a company official said "there is no talk at all
about dropping us out of the program."
A Pentagon official who discussed the troubled Tomahawk
program on the condition that he not be identified said design
and production of the missile had been hobbled by the fact that
"nobody was ultimately responsible for seeing that the whole
thing was put together properly."
As a result, both the anti-ship version of the Tomahawk and
the land attack version have performed well below standards, he
said.
Government may spray paraquat again
Washington — The federal government is ready to help Col
ombia and other countries destroy their marijuana crops with
the weed-killer paraquat, claiming that could cut U.S. marijuana
imports by 70 percent.
But an official of a pro-marijuana organization predicted yes
terday that destroying foreign sources of marijuana with para
quat would be a boon to domestic growers.
Paraquat once was thought to be harmful to human lungs if
smoked inadvertently, but the State Department said there is no
evidence any marijuana smoker has been harmed and that the
risk is "virtually non-existent."
But George Farnham of the National Organization for Re
form of Marijuana Laws — known as NORML — said paraquat
is one of the most poisonous herbicides and that there has been
little or no research into its long-term health effects.
Congress lifted a three-year ban against foreign paraquat op
erations in late 1981.
Stocks up in market recovery
The stock market staged a broad recovery yesterday, reversing
Monday's late selloff and demonstrating that the start of a new
year has failed to dampen trading volatility.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 3.03 points in
the opening hour, spurted up 19.04 points at 1046.08 by the clos
ing bell. The blue-chip average gained back almost all of the
ground it lost in its 19.50-point slide Monday.

GOP leaders urge Reagan to cut defense budget
Washington — Senate Republican leaders told President Reagan yester
day that the prospect of "terrifying" budget deficits requires reductions in
the administration's J 1.6 trillion five-year defense budget as well as in
domestic spending programs.
But Sen. Paul Laxalt (R-Nev.), Reagan's closest adviser on Capitol Hill,
said the president was not "very enthusiastic" about defense cuts when the
subject was raised during a 90-minute White House session.
"He's very close to being in concrete on the defense issue," said Laxalt,
whom Reagan chose after the election as general chairman of the Re
publican Party.
"I have a suspicion ... that we in Congress have a lot of selling to do" to
convince the president, he added.
The deficit was the principal topic of the president's meeting with the GOP
leaders, Laxalt said. The senator called the budget figures "a little terrify
ing," an indication of a "huge and probably intolerable" deficit. He gave no
figures, explaining that "no one's made any firm decisions."
Administration sources have estimated that the deficit will
reach almost $200 billion in the 1984 fiscal year that begins Oct. 1
unless there are budget reductions or tax increases. The presi
dent's continued stand against defense cuts appeared to foreclose
the largest potential area for reductions. Reagan will submit his
1984 budget to Congress on Jan. 31.
Meanwhile, Peter Davis, an economist on the staff of the Sen
ate Budget Committee, predicted that the deficit in the fiscal year
will reach $220 billion and he predicted that Congress will raise
Social Security taxes to help trim it.
"We will have a tax increase in 1983," Davis, the committee's
senior economist for tax analysis, told a meeting of the National
Economists Club,"and it probably will be a Social Security tax
increase."
The Social Security payroll tax is now 6.7 percent on both em
ployees and employers. There have been proposals to accelerate
the present schedule of increases. Under present law, the tax will
climb to 7.65 percent by 1990.
Although administration officials said Monday that the presi
dent will ask Congress to trim non-defense spending by $30
billion in fiscal 1984, Laxalt said Reagan "hasn't settled on
that."
Israel claims Soviets aiding Syria
Jerusalem — In an unusual announcement, the Israeli military
command said yesterday it has learned that Syria is constructing
two bases for Soviet-made SA-5 ground-to-air missile batteries <
"deep within Syrian territory" and that Israel will continue to
"follow developments concerning missile batteries."
The announcement did not claim that the missile batteries
pose a threat to Israel, and civilian and military officials con
ceded Syria's right to install ground-to-air missiles in its own ter
ritory. The announcement appeared to have a partially political
objective in reiterating that Syrian air defenses, although badly
mauled by the Israeli Air Force during the war in Lebanon, are
being rebuilt by the Soviet Union.
According to Israeli sources, there is a concern here that Syria,
once it is rearmed by the Soviet Union, will have lesi incentive to
withdraw its troops from Lebanon, which Israel in turn is de
manding as one condition of its own withdrawal from southern
Lebanon.
Israel also is eager to remind the world, and particularly its

presumably will be required to raise the rest, but there are dif
ferences over what the mix should be.
Most Democrats on the 15-member commission favor raising
most of the money by beginning Social Security tax increases
scheduled for 1985, 1986 and 1990 next year. Most of the Re
publicans would rely mainly on benefit cuts, including curtail
ment of the cost-of-living increases that now go automatically to
beneficiaries each year.
Several commission members, including Chairman Alan
Greenspan, have said they doubt the commission can agree un
less some agreement first is reached by President Reagan and
House Speaker Thomas "Tip" O'Neill (D-Mass). But there have
been no signs of that, and a request by one member that the com
mission meet again before Jan. 15 was turned down Monday by a
majority of the members as fruitless.
Texas Congressman to change parties
Washington — Texas Rep. Phil Gramm, who once said he did
not know any Republicans until he was an adult, apparently will
become one today.
Gramm, whose ouster from from his seat on the House Budget
Committee was recommended Monday by the Democratic
Steering Commission, is expected to announce this morning at a

press conference at his district office in Bryan, Texas, that he will
resign from his House seat, change parties and run in a special
election as a Republican for the same seat.
Gramm refused to comment before his scheduled announc
ment, but a spokesman for House Republican Leader Robert
Michel (R-lll.) said that he had "very good information" that
Gramm had decided to switch.
Gramm, a member of a group of conservative Democrats
known as "boll weevils" and a key supporter of Reagan adminis
tration budget proposals in the 97th Congress, will be embraced
by his newly adopted party.
Michel announced yesterday that the House Republican
Committee on Committees would recommend that a Budget
Committee seat be reserved for Gramm if he enters the House as
a Republican.
"The action of the Democratic Policy and Steering Committee
to seek Congressman Gramm's expulsion from the Budget Com
mittee is a grievous assault on the right of an individual member
to represent the views of his constituents as honestly and openly
as possible," Michel said. "Should Congressman Gramm ...
seek membership in our ranks, we are ready to give him and his
constituents the opportunities they deserve."
Gramm is not required by law to seek a special election once he
changes parties. He could simply announce the change and save
his constituents the cost of another election.
Gramm was crucial in helping to forge congressional alliances
for the White House in achieving its early budget victories on
Capitol Hill. Seeking to punish him, the Democratic Steering
and Policy Committee voted 26 to 4 Monday to remove him
from the Budget Committee. Fellow Democrats and the House
as a whole must vote on the issue, but concurrence is likely.
EPA cancels private lawyers for Gorsuch
Washington — The Environmental Protection Agency last
night abruptly canceled plans to hire private lawyers at a cost of
as much as $70,000 to help defend Administrator Anne Gorsuch
against a contempt-of-Congress charge, hours after the move
was questioned by the White House and a House subcommittee.
In addition, it was learned yesterday, the law firm the EPA had
intended to hire represented a company the agency is prosecuting
in an administrative proceeding for discharging toxic wastes into
the harbor of New Bedford, Mass.
The Boston firm of Ropes & Gray represented Aerovox Inc., a
defendant in a case arising from a New Bedford hazardous-waste
site ranked bv the EPA as one of the 160 most dangerous in the
country and by Massachusetts officials as the worst in the state,
EPA spokesman Byron Nelson confirmed.
According to several administration sources, the Aerovox link
was viewed as potential political dynamite. Certain documents
from its case are among hundreds Gorsuch refused to turn over
to the House after they were subpoenaed last month, calling
them too "sensitive" to be released without jeopardizing agency
prosecutions.
Under orders from President Reagan, Gorsuch invoked ex
ecutive privilege and withheld the papers. The House responded
by citing her for contempt on a lopsided, bipartisan vote of 259 to
105, the first time in history that the charge was lodged against a
Cabinet-level official.
Nelson said the decision to break off negotiations with Ropes
& Gray had nothing to do with the firm's ties to Aerovox, which
he said were unknown to the EPA until yesterday, or with ques
tions raised by White House counsel Fred Fielding and a House
subcommittee about the propriety of hiring outside lawyers.
Reagan signs orphan drug bill
Washington — Despite conflicting advice, President Reagan
yesterday signed a bill giving tax breaks to pharmaceutical com
panies that develop drugs to treat rare diseases, the White House
announced. Nt .
Reagan had held off making a decision on the bill, which
would have died at midnight tonight without his signature.
Amid reports that Reagan planned to veto the legislation
passed unanimously by Congress, several organizations
mounted a lobbying campaign to convince the president to sign
it.
In a telephone interview before the signature, Rep. Henry
Waxman, (D-Calif.) the measure's House sponsor, said the
White House was "flooded with phone calls and I hope that will
make a difference. Certainly there are millions of people that are
going to feel betrayed if the president vetoes this bill."
A White House aide refused to say how many calls had been
received.
The legislation would give tax breaks worth $75 million to the
pharmaceutical industry over the next five years to encourage de
velopment of drugs that would not otherwise be economical to
produce because a relatively small number of people need them.
The bill also would give drug companies a seven-year exclusive
marketing period for drugs that are not patentable and give them
a tax write-off of 73 cents on the dollar for expenses of human
testing.
Habib to return to Mideast negiotiations
Washington — Special envoy Philip Habib was summoned
here yesterday as the Reagan administration prepared a new
drive to break a stalemate in Israeli-Lebanese negotiations, and
thus clear the way for a broader settlement in the Mideast.
State Department sources said growing U.S. concern about

lack of progress in the week-old negotiations prompted the de
cision to call Habib back from a Florida vacation for policy
making meetings. The sources said it is likely that Habib will fly
to the Mideast within a few days in an effort to break the dead
lock.
It took the active intercession of Habib and his deputy, Am
bassador Morris Draper, to set up the Israeli-Lebanese talks that
began a week ago yesterday. The main objective, in the U.S.
view, is to arrange the basis for a prompt departure of Israeli
forces from Lebanon.
Israel's central objectives, however, are to win a form of nor
malized relations with Lebanon and to create a demilitarized se
curity zone near the Lebanese-Israeli border.
Lebanese negotiators so far have refused to place nor
malization of relations with Israel on the negotiating agenda be
cause of concern that such arrangements with the Jewish state
would imperil Lebanese relations with Arab nations.
Congress tries to end bankruptcy law stall
Washington — Congress — after missing two deadlines — is
moving to break a legal impasse over the nation's bankruptcy
law that has left hundreds of thousands of cases in confusion at a
time when business failures are increasing amid the current eco
nomic distress.
Rep. Peter Rodino (D-N.J.), chairman of the House Judiciary
Committee, introduced legislation on Monday to bring the
bankruptcy system into compliance with a Supreme Court de
cision of last June 28.
In that ruling, the Court declared that the 227 federal
bankruptcy judges could not constitutionally exercisc the broad
powers that Congress had granted them when it revised the
bankruptcy laws in 1978.
Specifically, it said bankruptcy judges could not decide non
bankruptcy issues even when they involved companies with
bankruptcy cases before those judges. In effect, the court said the
judges' powers must be curtailed or they must be given the pro
tection of lifetime tenure had by other federal judges.
The court delayed the effectiveness of its ruling until Oct. 4 and
later granted a stay until Christmas Eve. But on Dec. 23 it refused
a request to further stay the ruling to give Congress until March
25 to restructure the bankruptcy courts.
Pentagon to revamp Tomahawk program
Washington — Pentagon officials promised yesterday a major
shakeup of the troubled Tomahawk cruise missile program,
which they said has fallen up to two years behind schedule be
cause of poor management and engineering problems.
A Pentagon official indicated that the program will be restruc
tured "to place a higher degree of emphasis on management and
engineering."
Officials of the General Dynamics Corp., which produces the
missile at its Convair division in San Diego, would not discuss
the shakeup, but a company official said "there is no talk at all
about dropping us out of the program."
A Pentagon official who discussed the troubled Tomahawk
program on the condition that he not be identified said design
and production of the missile had been hobbled by the fact that
"nobody was ultimately responsible for seeing that the whole
thing was put together properly."
As a result, both the anti-ship version of the Tomahawk and
the land attack version have performed well below standards, he
said.
Government may spray paraquat again
Washington — The federal government is ready to help Col
ombia and other countries destroy their marijuana crops with
the weed-killer paraquat, claiming that could cut U.S. marijuana
imports by 70 percent.
But an official of a pro-marijuana organization predicted yes
terday that destroying foreign sources of marijuana with para
quat would be a boon to domestic growers.
Paraquat once was thought to be harmful to human lungs if
smoked inadvertently, but the State Department said there is no
evidence any marijuana smoker has been harmed and that the
risk is "virtually non-existent."
But George Farnham of the National Organization for Re
form of Marijuana Laws — known as NORML — said paraquat
is one of the most poisonous herbicides and that there has been
little or no research into its long-term health effects.
Congress lifted a three-year ban against foreign paraquat op
erations in late 1981.
Stocks up in market recovery
The stock market staged a broad recovery yesterday, reversing
Monday's late selloff and demonstrating that the start of a new
year has failed to dampen trading volatility.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 3.03 points in
the opening hour, spurted up 19.04 points at 1046.08 by the clos
ing bell. The blue-chip average gained back almost all of the
ground it lost in its 19.50-point slide Monday.

GOP leaders urge Reagan to cut defense budget
Washington — Senate Republican leaders told President Reagan yester
day that the prospect of "terrifying" budget deficits requires reductions in
the administration's J 1.6 trillion five-year defense budget as well as in
domestic spending programs.
But Sen. Paul Laxalt (R-Nev.), Reagan's closest adviser on Capitol Hill,
said the president was not "very enthusiastic" about defense cuts when the
subject was raised during a 90-minute White House session.
"He's very close to being in concrete on the defense issue," said Laxalt,
whom Reagan chose after the election as general chairman of the Re
publican Party.
"I have a suspicion ... that we in Congress have a lot of selling to do" to
convince the president, he added.
The deficit was the principal topic of the president's meeting with the GOP
leaders, Laxalt said. The senator called the budget figures "a little terrify
ing," an indication of a "huge and probably intolerable" deficit. He gave no
figures, explaining that "no one's made any firm decisions."
Administration sources have estimated that the deficit will
reach almost $200 billion in the 1984 fiscal year that begins Oct. 1
unless there are budget reductions or tax increases. The presi
dent's continued stand against defense cuts appeared to foreclose
the largest potential area for reductions. Reagan will submit his
1984 budget to Congress on Jan. 31.
Meanwhile, Peter Davis, an economist on the staff of the Sen
ate Budget Committee, predicted that the deficit in the fiscal year
will reach $220 billion and he predicted that Congress will raise
Social Security taxes to help trim it.
"We will have a tax increase in 1983," Davis, the committee's
senior economist for tax analysis, told a meeting of the National
Economists Club,"and it probably will be a Social Security tax
increase."
The Social Security payroll tax is now 6.7 percent on both em
ployees and employers. There have been proposals to accelerate
the present schedule of increases. Under present law, the tax will
climb to 7.65 percent by 1990.
Although administration officials said Monday that the presi
dent will ask Congress to trim non-defense spending by $30
billion in fiscal 1984, Laxalt said Reagan "hasn't settled on
that."
Israel claims Soviets aiding Syria
Jerusalem — In an unusual announcement, the Israeli military
command said yesterday it has learned that Syria is constructing
two bases for Soviet-made SA-5 ground-to-air missile batteries <
"deep within Syrian territory" and that Israel will continue to
"follow developments concerning missile batteries."
The announcement did not claim that the missile batteries
pose a threat to Israel, and civilian and military officials con
ceded Syria's right to install ground-to-air missiles in its own ter
ritory. The announcement appeared to have a partially political
objective in reiterating that Syrian air defenses, although badly
mauled by the Israeli Air Force during the war in Lebanon, are
being rebuilt by the Soviet Union.
According to Israeli sources, there is a concern here that Syria,
once it is rearmed by the Soviet Union, will have lesi incentive to
withdraw its troops from Lebanon, which Israel in turn is de
manding as one condition of its own withdrawal from southern
Lebanon.
Israel also is eager to remind the world, and particularly its
own main arms supplier, the United States, that although the
Syrians were defeated in Lebanon they have not been abandoned
by the Soviet Union and are restockpiling sophisticated weapons
with Soviet assistance.
According to a military spokesman, the SA-5 was developed
by the Soviet Union during the 1960s and has not appeared out
side Soviet borders before. The missile has a range of close to 200
miles, putting it within striking distance of Israeli air space, but is
less modern and sophisticated than some of the Soviet-built
ground-to-air missile systems that the Israelis defeated during
the war in Lebanon.
Social Security may include gov't workers
Washington — A draft report by the president's Social Secur
ity advisory commission recommends bringing into the system
all future federal employees and ail current federal employees
with less than five years of government service.
It also recommends removing Social Security from the federal
budget as a way of insulating Social Security tax and benefit de
cisions from future budget politics.
The draft, prepared by the commission staff, is meant to reflect
all points of agreement reached so far. If commission Re
publicans and Democrats can reconcile other differences by their
Jan. \ 5 reporting date, it could change.
At this point, however, inclusion of federal employees is the
only major step on which the two sides have been able to agree to
raise the $150 billion to $200 billion they say is needed to keep
Social Security solvent over the next seven years.
Some combination of tax increases and benefit curtailments
presumably will be required to raise the rest, but there are dif
ferences over what the mix should be.
Most Democrats on the 15-member commission favor raising
most of the money by beginning Social Security tax increases
