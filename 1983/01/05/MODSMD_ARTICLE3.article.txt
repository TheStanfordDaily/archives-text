GOP leaders urge Reagan to cut defense budget
Washington — Senate Republican leaders told President Reagan yester
day that the prospect of "terrifying" budget deficits requires reductions in
the administration's J 1.6 trillion five-year defense budget as well as in
domestic spending programs.
But Sen. Paul Laxalt (R-Nev.), Reagan's closest adviser on Capitol Hill,
said the president was not "very enthusiastic" about defense cuts when the
subject was raised during a 90-minute White House session.
"He's very close to being in concrete on the defense issue," said Laxalt,
whom Reagan chose after the election as general chairman of the Re
publican Party.
"I have a suspicion ... that we in Congress have a lot of selling to do" to
convince the president, he added.
The deficit was the principal topic of the president's meeting with the GOP
leaders, Laxalt said. The senator called the budget figures "a little terrify
ing," an indication of a "huge and probably intolerable" deficit. He gave no
figures, explaining that "no one's made any firm decisions."
