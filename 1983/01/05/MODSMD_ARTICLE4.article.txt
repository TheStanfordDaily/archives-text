## New Quad building stirs staff complaints 
### DAVID AZRIN Senior staff writer 
The Communication and Sociology
Departments have finished moving into
the newly reconstructed Building 120
on the north side of the Quad, but de
lays in furniture and equipment de
liveries yesterday made the first day of
classes unusually hectic.
The halls are lined with empty boxes,
stacked chairs and rolled carpets. Desk
chairs were only delivered yesterday,
and cabinets are still being painted.
Much of the office and broadcasting
equipment has not vet arrived.
It will take an estimated three weeks
for most of the furnishing to be com
pleted.
"It's chaos," said Sociology Prof.
Bernard Cohen. "I had to teach a class
in a room with no chairs so I had to go
out and rent some. There are a lot of
things that are not here that are sup
posed to be.
"There are things that haven't been
delivered yet. Hopefully it's not going
to interfere with our research or our
teaching but it has already caused some
interruptions," he said.
Before the chairs arrived yesterday,
"some people sat on apple crates, some
on boxes, and some brought their own
antique rockers," according to recep
tionist Lvla Belle.
"Some conference tables are 10 to 12
weeks away," said Leo Holm, the con
struction coordinator.
But he added that "all the delays are
normal especially in expediting a build
ing of this size this quickly. We just
didn't have time," Holm said.
"Some people get mad and jump in
the air about it but I try to keep my
cool," he said.
The move started Dec. 15 and took
one week. The Sociology Department
moved out of three Victorian style
houses (Rogers, Owens and Mariposa)
near the Law School. The Communica
tion Department moved from the Jor
don Quad, a cluster of small buildings
on the west side of campus. The depart
ments had been occupying the tem
porary offices for four years.
But since the move, many faculty and

staff members have been forced to con
duct their academic duties with con
struction workers working busily
nearby.
In one incident, an unknowing work
er took a pile of final exams which were
placed near a professor's door out to
the garbage along with a pile of empty
boxes.
Prof. Bryce Mclntyre had to "dig
through the bottom of the dumpster
and after he threw out the lettuce and
the coffee grinds, he retrieved all of the
exams," according to Betty Kaplan, ad
ministrative assistant.
A mix-up in the assignment of
classrooms has also caused confusion.
According to Kaplan, room numbers
for classes listed in the time schedule
were assigned according to the room
numbers on the architects' blueprint.
Furniture was also assigned according
to these numbers.
But the numbers on the blueprint
have no relation to the numbers posted
outside the classroom doors.
"It's very confusing having different
sets of numbers. I don't know why they
don't just stick to the numbers they had
started with. It was quite a dirty trick,"
Kaplan said.
Sociology Department Chairman
Joseph Bergr downplayed the prob
lems of transition.
"I'm sure there are problems and
they'll have to be straightened out, but
it's a new building and it's a big step.
"We've been waiting for this thing
for four years so I'm pretty excited," he
said.
Building* 120, which also housed the
Public Affairs and Affirmative Action
offices, was gutted and scheduled for re
construction four years ago.
The University has been system
atically reconstructing each building in
the Quad since 1967 in an effort to bring
them up to present day building codes
and to expand their facilities, according
to Valerie Veronin, assistant to the
provost.
The buildings used to temporarily
house the two departments will now be
divided among other departments.
