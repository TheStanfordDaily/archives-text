# ASSU error could cost SCOPE $10,000
## 
### STEVE TROUSDALE Staff writer 
An "administrative error" bv last year's ASSU
elections commission has jeopardized the Stanford
Committee on Political Education's (SCOPE) re
ceipt of approximately $10,000 from its planned fee
assessment, members of the ASSU finance commit
tee were told last night.
This figure represents approximately 100 perccnt
of SCOPE'S budget, said senator James McGrath.
Students ratified a SCOPE fee assessment in last
spring's election. However, the elections com
mission failed to have this vote certified by the
ASSU senate, a necessary step in th£ fee assessment
process.
Because the senate had not ratified this election
result, the Council of Presidents (COP) did not re
port the SCOPE fee assessment vote to the Univer
sity last spring so that the University could make
plans to collect the money through registration, as it
does for all other fee assessments.

This error was not noticed until late last month,
when SCOPE members asked Student Financial
Manager Bob Brodv if and when their money was to
be collected. When Brody checked he discovered
that the fee had not been, and was not scheduled to
be, levied, McGrath said.
In a telephone interview last night, McGrath, who
investigated the problem, told the Daily that the er
ror resulted when the SCOPE voting results were left
off of a typed copy of the election results that was
transcribed from a handwritten copy. Whether this
was done deliberately or not, McGrath is unsure,
but he said that he was "going on the assumption
that it was a clerical error."
"Given the circumstances of last spring's elec
tions commission," he said, "a clerical error is not
beyond the realm of possibility."
His doubt was caused, he said, by the way in
which the results were transcribed. The first several
voting results were listed on the typed sheet in the
same order as they had been on the handwritten

copy. However, at some point the typed copy
scrambles the order of the ballot issues on the hand
written version. It is in this jumble that the SCOPE
results were lost.
McOrath also said that SCOPE management had
not been informed of the mix-up. However, he said
that SCOPE had not exhibited any need for the
money this past fall quarter, and thus did not need to
be contacted in regard to the error. He added that
SCOPE had no idea when it would receive the fee
assessment when the group applied for it, and thus*
could possibly have had to wait until spring quarter
before receiving the money, as now seems probable.
The memorandum, which was distributed to fi
nance committee members before the meeting, lists
six options open to the ASSU in correcting this er
ror. The option the ASSU is exploring most intently
involves certifying the election result and, in agree
ment with the University, collecting the money
spring quarter.
