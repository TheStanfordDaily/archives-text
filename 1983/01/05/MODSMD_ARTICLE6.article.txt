The Communication and Sociology
Departments are in the process of moving
into the newly renovated Building 120.
Clockwise from left: a box of hooks waiting
to be unloaded; teaching assistants moving
shelves in the new television studio; the main
office of the Sociology Department; the
mechanized skylight, put in place by
helicopter last spring; Prof. Steven Chaffee
teaching his theory of communication class;
