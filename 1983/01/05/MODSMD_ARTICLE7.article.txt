# Top administrators ride bikes, too
## 
### JAN BENJAMIN 
Not ail Stanford adminis
trators commute in a 450 SL or
any other car for that matter. In
fact, a number of Stanford's top
administrators ride bikes to their
campus offices.
University President Donald
Kennedy is perhaps the Farm's
most illustrious biker.
Other administrators who
bike to work include: Robert
Hamrdla, assistant to the presi
dent; William Massy, vice
president for business and fi
nance; Gerald Lieberman, vice
provost and dean of graduate
studies; James Lyons, dean of
student affairs; Norm Robinson,
associate dean for residential
education; and Robert
Rosenzweig, vice president for
public affairs.
Others are: John Bunnell, as
sociate dean of admissions and
director of freshmen; Jean Fet
ter, associate dean of graduate
studies and research; Joel Smith,
vice president for development;
Bruce Hinchliffe, acting vice
president for development; and
Andrew Doty, director of com
munity relations.
Why, you might ask, do people
of such importance and stature
join the majority of students, fa
culty and staff in this humble but

popular activity?
"Number one, because it's
cheaper, it's quicker, I never
have a problem finding a parking
place, don't have to worry about
parking permits, and I get the
benefit of much-needed exer
cise," Lyons said.
"My work takes me all over
campus," he continued. "If I
have to go from Escondido Vil
lage to the Med Center, for
example, it's quicker to bike than
to drive."

Convenience, enjoyment and
exercise, followed by economy,
were the reasons most com
monly cited among these ad
ministrative bikers, a few of
whom have long-standing biking
histories.
Smith, for example, remarked
that he has biked "for a long
time," though "not quite prior to
the invention of the au
tomobile."
The biking careers of Fetter
and Bunnell stem from their un

dergraduate days here. Bunnell
said he has biked almost every
day "for the past 19 years.
"I'm fortunate enough to live
12 minutes from campus, and it's
beautiful biking through the
Eucalyptus Grove," he said. He
is reputed to ride from his home
in Palo Alto in any weather.
Fetter claims 25 years of cycl
ing experience. "It builds up my
leg muscles for tennis," she said,
adding that biking also provides
"ease, exercise and enjoyment."


BIKE COMMUTING: Many top Stanford
administrators use bikes as a means of getting
to and from their on-campus offices. Besides

and Dean of Residential Education Norm
