The TIME SCHEDULE and COURSES and DEGREES
have errors regarding E9O. This course WILL be offered
this Winter Quarter for 3 units and it DOES satisfy category
8 of the Distribution Requirement.
E9O is a course designed by the School of Engineering
for NON-engineers/scientists. Important issues relating to
present and future energy supplies, usage, and
environmental effects are presented and discussed. Some
elements of engineering methodology are used to provide
quantitative data for an aid to decisionmaking. High school
algebra is assumed but lots of help on numerical problems
is available.
