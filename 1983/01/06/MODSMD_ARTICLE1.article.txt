## 
### LISA LYNCH Staff writer 
Rep. Tom Lantos (D-San Mateo)
leaves today for Moscow, leading the
first congressional delegation into the
Soviet Union since the death of former
Soviet President Leonid Brezhnev.
The visit is part of a 13-day tour of
the Soviet Union, Romania, Hungary,
Yugoslavia and Greece. The tour con
cludes in Athens with a meeting of the
European Parliament, an international
organization concerned with foreign re
lations and commerce.
During the Moscow visit, Lantos is
scheduled to meet with "leading Soviet
officials" whose ■ names Lantos aide
Terrv Robertson would not disclose
"for security reasons." Lantos could
not be reached for comment.
Lantos has said he hopes to meet with
President Yuri Andropov and Foreign

Minister Andrei Gromyko, but a meet
ing with the two has not been definitely
scheduled, according to Robertson.
Robertson said the.Moscow visit is
timely, even though the European Par
liament meeting dictated the dates of
the trip. "We have been regressing to an
almost Cold War kind of relation with
the Soviet Union," Robertson said.
"This trip may not mean the beginning
of better U.S.-Soviet relations, but the
seeds can be planted."
Lantos will confer with Soviet of
ficials on issues such as disarmament
and human rights, conditions in Poland
and Afghanistan, Jewish emigration
and the status of Soviet Pentecostals,
Robertson said.
Lantos also has said he hopes to gain
information from Andropov about the
whereabouts of Raoul Wallenberg, a
Hungarian who.helped thousands of
Jews escape from the Nazis during
World War 11. Wallenberg disappeared
during the Soviet occupation of Hunga
ry.
The Soviets have long claimed that
Wallenberg is dead, but Lantos has said
he may be alive. Wallenberg was made
an honorary U.S. citizen through Lan
tos' efforts last year.
Lantos and his delegation leave Mos
cow Jan. 11 for Budapest, arrive in Bu
charest Jan. 14 and Belgrade Jan. 15.
The parliament meeting in Athens
begins Jan. 16 and runs four days. The
U.S. delegation will meet with delega
tions from 10 European nations to dis
cuss international policy and trade.
Robertson said the parliament is part
of the European community and its 435
members comprise "the world's largest
trading block." France, Germany, Ita
ly, England, the Netherlands, Belgium,
Greece, Denmark, Ireland and Luxem
borg are represented according to their
size and economic importance, he said.
