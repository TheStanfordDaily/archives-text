## Vendors enjoy independent lifestyle 
### KATHY OLMSTED 
Some professors here refer to the peddlers in
White Plaza as leftover flower children — social
dropouts who aimlessly pursue anti
establishment lifestyles. But most of the ven
dors who inhabit the expanse near Tresidder
Union are actually articulate college graduates
who say they have done no more than choose a
lifestyle that enables them to sell their art in an
unstructured atmosphere.
"I love it — it's independence. You don't
have to work for anyone else — you make your
own hours," said David Anderson, a Plaza ven
dor who makes and designs all of the jewelry
displayed at his stand. Of course, Anderson
admitted, there is "a certain degree of insec
urity" involved in his type of work, but he said
making money isn't one of his priorities.
Gary Freed, a T-shirtvendor, agreed. Travel
ing around to different college campuses selling
his T-shirt designs is a "spiritually gratifying''
experience, he said, because he enjoys creative
work and because he simply "likes T-shirts."
Freed said he prefers to work with college stu
dents, even though he might make more money
designing corporate logos. "I could do be iter if 1
just catered to companies," he said, but added
that such an arrangement would be unchalleng
ing.
Rick Greg, a jewelry designer and seller,
cautioned that the life of an itinerant vendor
isn't for everyone. Greg, who travels and sells
with his wife, said the successful vendor must
exercise great self-discipline in order to make
an adequate living. "As long as it isn't raining,
we're out selling somewhere," he said.
Many of the peddlers travel around the state,
but most said they particularly liked selling in
White Plaza. "Stanford's always been good to

me," Greg said. He comes three or four times a
month, he said, because he enjoys the art dis
plays, libraries and bookstore here. But he
never stays in the area long. "After three days,
the novelty of being here wears off," he said.
Stanford's selling conditions are superior to
other places, according to Greg. For example,
vendors who wish to sell at UC-Berkeley must
purchase a permit and must sell their wares in
the street, where the vendors encounter space
and security limitations. But the "calm and mel
low" atmosphere in White Plaza, along with
Stanford's "well-behaved and polite" students,
make the plaza an ideal place to sell, Greg said.
The vendors come from varying
backgrounds. Freed went to college for seven
years at various universities and was pursuing a
career in entomology when the Reagan ad
ministration cut the funding for his research.
Unemployed, Freed decided to pursue his own
brand of Reaganomics by going into the T-shirt
business. "By golly, this is free enterprise at the
base level," he said.
Juan Arce, a vendor whose booth displayed
handmade Peruvian sweaters and crafts, is a
teacher in Peru, visiting relatives in the area.
Arce said he would attempt to sell the remain
der of his goods, but he wasn't terribly worried
about it. ' 112 If they (the customers) buy, it's OK. If
they don't buy, that's OK too," he said. :
Greg, who attended San Francisco State Uni
versity, has sold in White Plaza for 12 years. He
said he enjoys the opportunities that the job
provides to travel and meet people. "I probably
know everyone in California," he said.
The vendors expressed almost universal satis
faction with their lifestyles. As Greg said, "I
hope I'll be able to come here for the next 50
years."
