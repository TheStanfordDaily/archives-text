## The 						Stanford Daily Tenure system challenged 
### 
The charges and recriminations surrounding de
nials of tenure to Asst. History Prof. E'stelle
Freedman cloud and challenge the integrity of the
entire tenure process.
The misdirected energy of incredibly talented
people belies an efficient and productive decision
process. On one side, political historians engage in
the underworld of administrative politics and law
professors threaten lawsuits — rather than impart
ing and furthering the knowledge of their fields.
On the other, administrators assume the role of
academic specialists and oppose, rather than coor
dinate and direct, the sentiments and energy of
much of the community.
Each side's charges will not be resolved by the
administration's current treatment of the issue: the
mud is thick, the insults are nasty and none of the
wounds inflicted daily will heal through a policy of
stonewalling or silence. A professor becomes un
worthy of University support without explicit
reasons: the decisions cast aspersions upon
Freedman's teaching, scholarship and position
within her field although none of those charges
need be supported publicly. In the process, the
administration has become its own worst enemy:
its silence draws equally undocumented charges of
prejudice, duplicity and sexism.
These are serious claims, but a tenure policy of
closed hearings, barely justified decisions and
murky sources of decision-making invites these
and other charges without lending evidence to
support or refute any of them. Confidential evi
dence flies into a black hole and emerges through a
worm hole in time as a final decision — unjustified,
measured against relatively undefined standards,
cloaked in bureaucratic anonymity and yet crucial
to both the professor and institution.
A professor considered for tenure undergoes
something very close to a trial, but we allow the
procedure to be without the record, public witness,
advocates, accountability or standards we demand
from any responsible legal system. Especially in an

institution with claims to open access to ideas and
to critical understanding of decisions, a closed
decision-making process mocks the ideals it osten
sibly furthers.
The Freedman case shows the harm of this Star
Qiamber approach to all parties involved. The
integrity of the institution vanishes because the
University has no basis for defending its decision
against charges of arbitrariness, political interfer
ence or any number of-isms once the basic trust of
the community is broken. The decision stands as a
character assassination when *he grounds for the
denials are left so vague that any number of infer
ences may be drawn. And many observers and
peripheral participants on all sides emerge bitter
and resentful.
A system without public accountability becomes
less defensible when the standards of admission
into the tenured club remain so ill-defined. As the
Freedman case shows, Dean of Humanities and
Sciences Norman Wessells' allusions to standards
of the finest scholarship and teaching are little
explanation to those observers — especially histo
rians throughout the nation — who feel they un
derstand what scholarship and teaching mean. Any
system of decision-making should protect beyond
a doubt both the professor's right to due and fair
process and the University's reputation as a just
arbitor; this case shows the shrouded tenure pro
cess protects neither.
The tenure denials hold an importance beyond
the redirected career, damaged reputations, bitter
conflicts and dismayed observers: the consensus
necessary for the tenure process to retain the trap
pings of truth secretly gleaned from the academic
gods has been destroyed. The process will proba
bly continue, the Olympian clouds will return, and
the current bitterness will subside. But perhaps —
just perhaps — the Freedman case will start
changes in a system that damages the very values
and people it is designed to protect.
