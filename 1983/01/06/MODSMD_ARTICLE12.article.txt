## Lessons from synfuels debacle 
### 
As recently as 1980, the hills of
western Colorado were alive with
geologists and engineers, all humming
the theme from "Bonanza" and dream
ing of riches from synthetic fuels. En
couraged by rising international oil
prices and the creation of aa $88-
billion federal Synfuels
modern prospectors thought
riding the wave of the future. As
Samuel Johnson remarked of a man
taking his second wife, they were
guided more by hope than by experi
ence.
Soon the inexorable economic fac
tors that have deflated synfuels booms
repeatedly since 1917 asserted them
selves again. Faced with stagnant oil
prices and falling demand, oil com
panies began to reexamine their bot
tom lines. The numbers were harsh.
Exxon's Colony project, for exam
ple, would have spent $6 billion to pro
duce 47,000 barrels of fuel a day. This
is an investment of $127,000 per daily
barrel of low-grade fuel. The same
amount of money invested in uncon
ventional natural gas or solar devices
could produce from five to 10 times
more energy. Spent on cost-effective
conservation measures, it could save 50
times as much fuel as Colony could
produce.
After carefully examining several
other investment opportunities, Exxon
officials concluded that the Colony
project was spherically senseless — it
didn't make sense no matter how they
looked at it. Exxon abandoned Colony
earlier this year.
Most other synfuel companies have
made the same decision. Occidental
and Tenneco have indefinitely post
poned their $3-billion investment at
Cathedral Bluffs, Colo. American
Natural Resources has canceled its
$2.7 billion WyCoal venture. Gulf Oil
has withdrawn from its $1.6 billion
SRC-II project. Sohio has dropped out
of the $2 billion Hampshire project in
Wyoming's Powder River Basin. Al
though a handful of other companies —
bolstered by handsome federal sub
sidies — are plugging gamely ahead,
the smart money in the private sector is
flowing elsewhere.
The federal government changes di
rection only at a glacial pace, but it, too,
will certainly abandon the synfuel ef
fort. Faced with an awesome budgetary
deficit and the collapse of the private
synthetic fuels industry. President
Reagan must soon ask Congress to
abolish the federal Synfuels Corp. and
return its money to the general revenue
fund.
As this expensive chapter in the
American energy saga comes toanend,
we should reflect on what lessons it
may hold. The Reagan administration
can be expected to cite it as proof that
energy decisions should remain in the
private marketplace. This is not the
right lesson.
If national security, environmental
protection, balance-of-payments, con
cern for the poor and a dozen other
public issues are important, then the
government must have a continuing
role in the energy field. At the same
time, it must not continue to squander

billions of tax dollars on things that we
don't need.
What America really needs in the
energy field is innovation.
Important innovations almost al
ways come small, hungry entrep
reneurs. Vacuum tubes have been
completely (fiplaced by transistors, but
not a single manufacturer of vacuum
tubes made the shift. Dominant firms,
whether they produce cars or steel or
oil, will seldom undermine the status
quo. Technological innovation comes
not from the board rooms of giants, but
from the garages of the Wright
brothers, the David Packards
(Hewlett-Packard) and the Steve Jobs
(Apple Computer).
The largest share of federal synfuels
largess has gone to giants. Giants have
difficulty seeing opportunities right
under their feet. Too often, they crush
new ideas instead of nurturing them.
Future federal energy efforts must con
sciously steer a far higher fraction of
their development dollars to our best
hope: the small entrepreneur.
The second lesson to be learned in
volves energy conservation. As oil

prices climbed from $4 per barrel 10
years ago to $34 today, the oppor 7
tunities for conservation soared. The
average new home today uses half as
much heating fuel as the average old
home. The average new car gets double!
the mileage of the average old 9ar,
Similar trends can |>e found in '
aspect of our society, including indus-«
try. More than anything else, this fal
ling demand doomed a high-priced
synfuels program that had been built
on the assumption of skyrocketing
energy needs.
Why did President Jimmy Carter and
Congress place an $88-billion bet on
synthetic fuels? Why did they not
broaden the Synfiiel Corp. charter to
encompass conservation, renewables,
deep gas and other promising options?
The answers are complex, but are
mostly rooted in ignorance, vested in-,
terests and the politics of the 19705.
Let's hope that we have learned our
lessons, and that the politics of the
1980s will be different.
