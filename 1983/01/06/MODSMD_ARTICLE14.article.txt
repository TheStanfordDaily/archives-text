## Year 1983, the way it should be 
### 
There must still be hope as 1983 be
gins. I still have hopes. I hope that some
time this year:
A television commentator will show
the last four seconds of the Stanford-
Cal football game and show anger in
stead of amusement.
The Raiders will move back to Oak
land, the Rams will move back to the
Coliseum, Carroll Rosenbloom will be
resurrected, and everything will be fine
again.
Ronald Reagan will realize that Car
roll Rosenbloom is dead, the past is
gone forever, and only one man at the
most has ever been resurrected.
Billy Martin will become manager of
the Yankees again, thereby proving
that private enterprise can reduce the
unemployment rate.
The National Basketball Association
will get serious and simply institute a
series of four-team challenge matches
in major cities, including the Lakers,
Celtics, 76ers, and an'all-star team
taken from the remaining 19 clubs.
This will break the illusion that
everyone has a chance for success be
" rhtisfe Everyone is\%jt»fcl
firtJg of the season. — r,
America will see how similar it is to
the NBA.
Crowds will cheer for the Russian
National Hockey team as it tours the
United States, simply because its
members are talented human beings.
People will start watching St.
Elsewhere.
People will stop watching Trapper
John M.D.
People will remember that E.T. was
a great movie and stop ridiculing it for
being childlike, but never childish.
People will remember that E.T. was
a great movie, a work of art, and not a
suitable motif for every material good
known to man.
Ronald Reagan will see and under
stand what either E.T. or the Bible is
really all about.
Meryl Streep will win the Academy
Award for Sophie's Choice and at the
same time will be awarded Oscars, as
history corrects itself, for her roles in
The Deer Hunter and The French
Lieutenant's Woman.
Everyone I talk to will not say that
they are not in the mood for depressing
movies like Sophie's Choice.

More people will see Sophie's Choice
than will see Tootsie even though the
latter is a more perfectand entertaining
film.
Those who read this column will not
become upset that I've mentioned a
movie three times that they probably
haven't seen, simply accepting that it is
somehow very important to my
thoughts.
"Asia" will take the initiative and
embark on a farewell tour after only
one album, arousing joy throughout
the music world, certainly more than
last year's farewell.

Ronald Reagan will improve his vertical vision
by exercising his eyes and mind as much as he
does his healthy body, thereby allowing him to
see that at least 30 million people at the bottom
of our society are not i getting along fine. 9

A song as slow and literary as Bruce
Springsteen's "Highway Patrolman"
wUI be played on the radio, maybe even
oq the j4.m| band?
'Ronald Reagarrwill improve hrs ver
tical vision by exercising his eyes and
mind as much as he does his healthy
body, thereby allowing him to see that
at least 30 million people at the bottom
of our society are not "getting along
fine."
Someone, anyone, in power will
realize the simple truth that we could
be working with left-wing regimes in El
Salvador and throughout the Third
World and that there is more of a red
menace in dye number two than there
is in Central America.
James Watt will undergo a religious
conversion, and, as a devout atheist,
will learn the importance of respecting
and preserving God's earth.
John DeLorean will receive the same
quality of justice as the poorest of de
fendants and upon conviction will be
sentenced to a newly created American
Dream rehabilitation program.
More people will begin to see the
possible, conceivable similarities bet
ween the shoreline of Beirut and the
shoreline of Miami Beach.
Nothing, except for the most private
of acts, will be done in the name of
religion.

Nothing, whatsoever, will be done in
the name of destiny or divine mission.
Ronald Reagan will never use the
words destiny or divine mission again.
A monument will be built to all the
Vietnamese killed in the Vietnam War.
Koo Stark, Margaret Thatcher, and
Queen Elizabeth will rotate their re
spective roles every four months,
thereby appreciating their common
humanity.
Broadway and Main Street, U.S.A.
will somehow intersect.
Dustin Hoffman in Tootsie will re
place John Wayne as the ideal, heroic

American man.
The National Enquirer will report
that a family living in a small San fi
asco suburb has adopted two Viet
namese children, providing them the
love and hope they need, and it will sell
a record number of copies.
There will be a far-reaching per
sonal, cultural, and political revolution
in the thoughts of Americans.
There will be substantial improve
ment in the human predicament for the
first time in human history.
One person will experiencean easing
of his suffering.
A few people will find true love.
Everyone will be granted one wish.
Everyone will feel a sense of control
for one moment.
Everyone will be able to forget for as
long as possible.
Everyone will be able to pretend and
make it so.
Everyone will believe, with John
Reed that "Grand things are ahead,
worth living and dying for," or at least
be moved by these words.
Everyone will realize that this is not
judgment day, just the beautiful dawn
of a new morning.
