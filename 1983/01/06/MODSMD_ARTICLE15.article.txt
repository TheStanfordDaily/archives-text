Questions
The Daily used to run a very reada
ble column which dealt with queries
about things happening on campus,
and the columnist often cleared up
many mysteries.
In that vein, may I ask:
1) If money is short and tuition is
going to soar another 12 percent, and
we all have to pull in our belts, why is
the University spending money on such
trivia as a memorial clock tower, new
flower beds in Encina Commons, and a
huge new Music Building, when surely
it would have been far cheaper to have
expanded the huge old one?
2) Why are scores of cars allowed to
park illegally at the open space on the
junction of Panama and Santa Teresa
Streets? They often even park on the
public pathway and make pedestrians
walk in the muck.
3) Why do students still voluntarily
support the awful "Stanford band"
which makes Stanford look like a rural
high school?
4) Why is morale so bad among staff
at Tresidder Union? Everyone I talk to
there seems unhappy at management
but seems scared to say why.
