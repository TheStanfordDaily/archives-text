## Meryl Streep's mystery women and messed-up directors 'Sophie's Choice' 
### STEVE VINEBERG 
Is it possible that Alan J.
Pakula has always harbored a
secret desire to make leather
bound illustrated classics?
Sophie's Choice, which he wrote,
directed and produced, lumbers
along for more than two-and-a
half hours without care to pace
or dramatic tension, but it's cer
tainly faithful to William Sty
ron's prestigious bestseller —
maddeningly faithful, as if Sty
ron were Faulkner at the very
least. He isn't, but it's not for
lack of self-promotion. Sophie's
Choice has a first-person nar
rator named Stingo, a young
Southern writer in the Robert
Penn Warren tradition who,
while observing a bizarre love af
fair between a Polish Catholic
who survived Auschwitz and a
paranoid schizophrenic Jew with
a Holocaust obsession, is begin
ning to think about preparing a
biography of the renegade slave
Nat Turner. Here we recognize
the germ of Styron's controver
sial prize-winning novel The
Confessions of Nat Turner, so
; when other characters compare
j Stingo to various great American
! writers (Walt Whitman's name
t crops up repeatedly), Styron is
giving himself a hearty hand
| shake and a pat on the back. The
corollary is that this gifted fireb
rand is brilliant enough to ac-
I complish anything. Sophie's
Choice runs to a hefty 600 pages,
in the course of which Styron at
tempts to crosshatch the themes
of Polish guilt over the extermi
nation camps and white/
* Southern guilt over slavery, to
k delve with Laingian magnanim-
B ity into insanity, to penetrate the .
& enigma of a concentration camp
(victim layer by layer, and to
chronicle, humorously, the
long-anticipated sexual initia
tion of a young hero — a portrait
of Portnoy as a WASP from Vir
£ ginia.

Alternately powerful and
powerfully frustrating, Styron's
novel is far from negligible as a
5 piece of writing, but when the
smoke of the author's self
confidence clears (arrogance
might express it better), what
... you see is a haze of half-fulfil led
ambitions, one remarkably
m strong horrow-show passage that
gives the book its title, and a lot
. of hot air. Pakula must have
E learned from Styron how to read
Styron's novel: his reverence
comes straight out of the book.
■ But no one could turn Sophie's
£ Choice into a good movie with
out paring down the overzealous
.narrative, losing the rites of pas
sage subplot, merging several of
the Poland-Auschwitz flash
; backs, and devising more plausi
v ble treatment for Sophie's luna-
I. tic lover. Pakula has taken the
other extreme: he actually over-
lays blocks of Styron's prose in
I the form of voice-over narration.
Pakula exhibited a sensitivity
I with actors and a modest talent
E for sustaining mood in some of
112 his early pictures — The Sterile
t Cuckoo, Klute and The Parallax
[ View. But his safe, intelligent re

ndering of Alt the President's
Men simmered when it should
have exploded, and he's way out
of his depth with an epic like
Sophie's Choice. I'm sure his
staff researched the 1947 Brook
lyn scenes and the Auschwitz
scenes carefully, but I didn't be
lieve them, probably because he
didn't compose the actors in the
crowd scenes (when there are
crowd scenes; most of the time
the settings are oddly under
populated) — the extras appear
to be standing around waiting for
something to do. And though of
fhand I can't recall a flashback in
any of the previous Pakula
movies I've seen, surely he might
have learned from watching
other directors' films that
flashback structure implies trans
itions. The pieces of the story are
subsequent, not consequent;
they fall into place like beads on
a string. And the flashbacks suf
fer from a stultifying series of
wrong decisions — about photo
graphy (Nestor Almendros
bleeds the color out, so that a
pasty salmon or nauseous green
glow hovers over everything),
about make-up (Meryl Streep's,
which was devised by J. Roy Hel
land, nearly cancels out any sub
tlety in her acting), about style
(TV pop documentary). TTie
only strength in the movie is
Meryl Streep's portrayal of
Sophie, which is, thank God,
central to it.
Streep's first film perfor
mances, in The Deer Hunter, The
Seduction of Joe Tynan, Manhat
tan and Kramer vs. Kramer, con
tained much more than the writ
ers had provided for her to play,
and those who had seen her on
stage in New York swore she
could do anything. But her Sarah
in The French Lieutenant's
Woman was clever, self
conscious and empty — all
technique, a perfect model for an
acting class. I found it impossible
to derive more than academic
pleasure out of it, and so I was
wary of seeing her play another
mysterious woman with another
accent. The surprise is that she's
radiant in this movie — majestic
— with real, rooted warmth, a
little like Ingrid Bergman'sin the
19405. She leads us into the core
of Sophie's mystery (so we don't
feel cheated, as we did in The
French Lieutenant's Woman
when Sarah's 20th-century
counterpart turned out to be just
as indecipherable as Sarah) but
she doesn't destroy each layer as
she peels it off; she doesn't play
games with the character. Pakula
has saddled her with lengthy
monologues that look like they
were shot in a couple of takes,
and she's almost constantly in
close-up, but she justifies his
faith in her even though he gives
her no assistance at all — in at
least one of these scenes the edit
ing rhythm breaks down almost
completely.

Streep's Polish accent is so
wonderful that we can't help
smiling, and there are little poc
kets of humor sewn into the way
Sophie approaches the appa
rently hopeless task of mastering
English. Streep's greatest power
is closely allied with this comedy
of hesitation and malapropism.

In one scene, she asks a snotty
librarian to help her locate the
works of an American poet
named Emile Dickens, and
though we know it is Emily Dic
kinson she seeks, the librarian
treats her as an ignorant
foreigner, condescending to her
and insulting her. Her efforts to
convince him that she has not er
red, that she is not stupid, pass
into a strained, smiling defeat
and an attempt to retreat with
some semblance of dignity. This
heartbreaking moment might be
an emblem for the most humiliat
ing chapter of the immigrant ex
perience. Streep employs that
smile more than once in the
movie, but it always signifies the
same thing: that though her in
ferior command of the English
language, or indeed of any set of
circumstances in her life, may
compel her to withdraw, she rec
ognizes a deeper truth that she
cannot express. It's the smile of
those trapped unjustly by the
barriers of language or age or in
firmity — the sublime strength of
the weak.
If Meryl Streep gets lost at
some points in the picture, if she
seems to recede in the flashback
sequences, she can hardly be
blamed. The set-up of the movie
obliges her to speak Polish and
German in these scenes, and of
course she's terribly proficient at
it — so they become scenes
about Meryl Streep's amazing
feat of playing a film role fluently
in three languages.
As her two leading men, Kevin
Kline and Peter MacNicol,
struggle with impossible roles
and, of course, lose the fight.
Kline, a handsome New York
stage actor who looks like a cross
between Errol Flynn and the
young Olivier, plays Nathan,
Sophie's Jewish lover, who, we
are asked to believe, is so charm
ing and brilliant that those who
adore him — Sophie, Stingo, his
brother Larry — put up with his
fits of viciousness and destruc
tion. (Larry won't even tell
Sophie what is wrong with
Nathan, because he's afraid to
hurt her feelings. That is re
markably muddleheaded think
ing for any age, and particularly
oddball in 1947, when the men
tally disturbed were besieged
with a torture chamber full of
experimental treatments, such as
hydrotherapy and prefrontal and
transorbital lobotomies.) Kline's
loony antics have considerable
appeal (he must be wonderful in
musicals), but we can see
Nathan's temperamental shifts,
which could only be dramatically
effective if played as shocking,
hairbreadth turns from theater
into madness, coming a mile off.
And though Peter MacNicol
does studious, carefully detailed
work and holds onto the charac
ter of Stingo for dear life, em
bodying an author's alter egoin a
story in which he is primarily an
observer never did much for any
actor's career. (Ask Sam
Waterston, the Nick Carraway of
the last Great Gats by.)
When Styron's novel works,
we can appreciate the primal
power of two towering themes,
incomprehensible evil and unas
suageable guilt, but Pakula's

movie is about words, words,
words. When Stingo finally takes
Sophie to bed, realizing his most
fervent fantasy, the astonishingly
literal-minded Pakula, instead of
showing them making love, halts
on an image of MacNicol in a
pair of ugly green shorts and
Streep in bra and panties, kissing
rather benignly, and substitutes a
voice-over of Styron's over
heated description of his feelings
at that moment. When the cam
era steals back for a morning
after glance at MacNicol, he's
still wearing those damned
shorts. I guess when you've got
literature you don't need sex.

'Still of the Night'

You know a mystery's in trou
ble when the corpse is more in
teresting than any of the live
characters. In Still of the Night,
written and directed by Robert
Benton (from a story by Benton
and David Newman), a psychiat
rist (Roy Scheider) tries to solve
the murder of one of his patients
(Josef Sommer) by reconstruct
ing their sessions and interpret
ing one of his dreams, and in the
flashbacks Sommer, who also
reads the narration in Sophie's
Choice, has some of the same
elegant malevolence Robert
Ryan used to display in his
psychotic roles (in movies like


Kevin Kline and Meryl Streep in Sophias Choice.
Caught and Clash by Night). In a
briefer role, Sara Botsford has a
couple of vibrant scenes. The
rest of the picture is splendidly
composed (Nestor Almendros
shot this one, too) and absolutely
lethal. Can Benton, who filled
his 1977 detective film The Late
Show to bursting with vivifying,
unconventional characters, re
ally have forgotten so much that
he was content to make this
bloodless tribute to Alfred
Hitchcock? (Buffs can pick out
the references to Spellbound,
Vertigo, The Birds and Rebecca
before drifting off to sleep.) Stilt
of the Night is undeniably skill
ful; it isn't easy to duplicate the
Hitchcockian strategies of comic
suspense and suspense through
simultaneous action; but
wouldn't getting us to care about
the characters have been a more
useful achievement? This movie
seems to transpire entirely in
Benton's movie-fed conscious
ness, without any convincing al
lusions to the real world. At one
point Scheider (in a dry, drowsy

performance) strolls into Central
Park after dark(!) and, to our
surprise, Almendros has made it
look like such a model of high
toned surreal horror that the
sudden appearance of a mugger
is a stylistic intrusion.
Meryl Streep shot this picture
between The French Lieuten
ant's Woman and Sophie's
Choice, and though she wears a
straight, shoulder-length blonde
wig, she is still using her thin, flat
voice from the modern sequ
ences of The French Lieutenant's
Woman — not an asset here.
Playing a neurotic woman who
had an affair with the dead man
and may or may not have killed
him, she gives a silly-finicky per
formance. (I thought I would
begin to throw things if she didn't
stop fiddling with her hair.)
Watching her, I was reminded of
a friend's response to an early
'70s Gothic called Nightwatch, in
which the mystery hinges on
whether Elizabeth Taylor is re
ally hallucinating or someone is
trying to drive her crazy. He said
that halfway through the picture,
he found himself so distracted by
Taylor's affectations that he
didn't care how the movie turned
out — he knew she was crazy.
