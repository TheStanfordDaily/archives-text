# Funds from sales grow
## University expanding in software market 
### STEVE KAUFMAN Staff writer 
Problems with distribution to poten
tial users of computer software de
veloped here has put the University in
vet another high-tech business — soft
ware sales.
The Software Distribution Center,
now in its second year, disseminates
software to other universities and com
mercial firms. The center is generating
revenue for the University and becom
ing an important link between re
searchers and users.
"This is not intended to be a com
mercial venture," said Bill Yundt, di
rector of the Center for Information
Technology (CIT). "The idea is to dis
tribute software to other educational
programs." Yundt and his staff handle
the manufacturing and processing of
the software in conjunction with the
Software Distribution Center.
Yundt explained that software is dis
tributed according to a three-tier sys
tem, depending on the commercial
viability of the individual program. Tier
one is for non-commercial research
uses, and is distributed at a cost-re
coverv basis. The second tier involves
licensing the program to a commercial
firm with the stipulation that it will be
used for its internal use only and will
not be re-sold. The distributon center
handles all transactions for these tiers.

Tier three is distribution of high-val
ue software through private software
companies, who develop the programs
for sale in the commercial market.
Stanford has been distributing soft
ware on a non-organized basis since the
late 19605, with the CIT sporting the
largest network. As a general rule, when
researchers developed programs which
they felt were marketable or useful to
other universities, the responsibility of
licensing and marketing rested with the
developers.
Expansion of the computer facilities
at Stanford, coupled with advances in
computer expertise here, led to a
backlog of software. The developers
thought many programs could benefit
other educational institutions, but
often had no way to distribute them.
"There was a big jam of software
which needed to get distributed," ex
plained Bill Osborn, an administrator
of the distribution center. "The people
at the Office of Technology Licensing
. felt that if a focal point were created, we
could more effectively distribute the
software."
The center currently distributes 25 to
30 programs ranging from aeronics to
electronics and finance/management.
"These are production tools, not prod
ucts," said Osborn. "A majority of the
code which we list in our catalog is very
technical.and only usable for very spe

cific purposes." He added that these
programs have very little commerical
value, and they are mostly helpful to re
searchers in the electrical engineering
field.
Most programs which the center dis
tributes are sold at cost and on an "as
is" basis. This means that the Univer
sity offers no installation, maintenance,
debugging, enhancements or any other
types of support. This, explained Os
born, allows the cost of the programs to
remain low, with most selling for be
tween $100 and $200.
Yundt said that the purpose of the
center is not to compete with com
mercial distributors.
"In most cases, the software we have
distributed has created a market, not
killed one," Yundt said. "It is impor
tant to remember that the majority of
what we have is very technical, and in
and of itself is not a great market."
Those programs which are deemed as
having a high potential for commercial
sale are handled in two methods. Stan
ford will either license the program for
internal "as-is" use by an individual
firm or grant a license to a private soft
ware company which then sublicenses it
to others. When sublicenses are
granted, Stanford receives a royalty
from the proceeds and the private firm
provides support.
The proceeds from sales are rouehly
distributed in thirds, with one third
going to the University, one third to the
department in which the program was
developed, and a third to the developer.
According to Osborn, of the $400,000
which has been collected during the
past two vears for developers, close to
90 percent of that has been turned back

into the labs for further use in research.
"It's really incredible," said Osborn.
"I think it shows a lot about the people
who are in the computer field at Stan
ford."
The distribution of software at Stan
ford is a joint effort between the new
center and CIT. The center handles the
administrative details of the programs,
and the CIT actually assembles the pro
grams for distribution.
Osborn said the center is thriving but
lacks one thing — a director. "It's really
going places, but if you know of a direc
tor, let us know,"he laughed.

"I think it shows a lot about the people
who are in the computer field at Stan
ford."
The distribution of software at Stan
ford is a joint effort between the new
center and CIT. The center handles the
administrative details of the programs,
and the CIT actually assembles the pro
grams for distribution.
Osborn said the center is thriving but
lacks one thing — a director. "It's really
going places, but if you know of a direc
tor, let us know,"he laughed.

Problems with distribution to poten
tial users of computer software de
veloped here has put the University in
vet another high-tech business — soft
ware sales.
The Software Distribution Center,
now in its second year, disseminates
software to other universities and com
mercial firms. The center is generating
revenue for the University and becom
ing an important link between re
searchers and users.
"This is not intended to be a com
mercial venture," said Bill Yundt, di
rector of the Center for Information
Technology (CIT). "The idea is to dis
tribute software to other educational
programs." Yundt and his staff handle
the manufacturing and processing of
the software in conjunction with the
Software Distribution Center.
Yundt explained that software is dis
tributed according to a three-tier sys
tem, depending on the commercial
viability of the individual program. Tier
one is for non-commercial research
uses, and is distributed at a cost-re
coverv basis. The second tier involves
licensing the program to a commercial
firm with the stipulation that it will be
used for its internal use only and will
not be re-sold. The distributon center
handles all transactions for these tiers.

Tier three is distribution of high-val
ue software through private software
companies, who develop the programs
for sale in the commercial market.
Stanford has been distributing soft
ware on a non-organized basis since the
late 19605, with the CIT sporting the
largest network. As a general rule, when
researchers developed programs which
they felt were marketable or useful to
other universities, the responsibility of
licensing and marketing rested with the
developers.
Expansion of the computer facilities
at Stanford, coupled with advances in
computer expertise here, led to a
backlog of software. The developers
thought many programs could benefit
other educational institutions, but
often had no way to distribute them.
"There was a big jam of software
which needed to get distributed," ex
plained Bill Osborn, an administrator
of the distribution center. "The people
at the Office of Technology Licensing
. felt that if a focal point were created, we
could more effectively distribute the
software."
The center currently distributes 25 to
30 programs ranging from aeronics to
electronics and finance/management.
"These are production tools, not prod
ucts," said Osborn. "A majority of the
code which we list in our catalog is very
technical.and only usable for very spe

cific purposes." He added that these
programs have very little commerical
value, and they are mostly helpful to re
searchers in the electrical engineering
field.
Most programs which the center dis
tributes are sold at cost and on an "as
is" basis. This means that the Univer
sity offers no installation, maintenance,
debugging, enhancements or any other
types of support. This, explained Os
born, allows the cost of the programs to
remain low, with most selling for be
tween $100 and $200.
Yundt said that the purpose of the
center is not to compete with com
mercial distributors.
"In most cases, the software we have
distributed has created a market, not
killed one," Yundt said. "It is impor
tant to remember that the majority of
what we have is very technical, and in
and of itself is not a great market."
Those programs which are deemed as
having a high potential for commercial
sale are handled in two methods. Stan
ford will either license the program for
internal "as-is" use by an individual
firm or grant a license to a private soft
ware company which then sublicenses it
to others. When sublicenses are
granted, Stanford receives a royalty
from the proceeds and the private firm
provides support.
The proceeds from sales are rouehly
distributed in thirds, with one third
going to the University, one third to the
department in which the program was
developed, and a third to the developer.
According to Osborn, of the $400,000
which has been collected during the
past two vears for developers, close to
90 percent of that has been turned back

into the labs for further use in research.
"It's really incredible," said Osborn.
"I think it shows a lot about the people
who are in the computer field at Stan
ford."
