# Bill Evans: a rediscovery of subtlety in jazz
## 
### TED GIOIA 
Subtlety is rarely a virtue of art forms that seek a
large popular following. Jazz is no exception to the
rule: artists who rely on sensitivity rather than on
empty bombast are often either ignored or else ad
mired for the wrong reasons.
The late Bill Evans is a case in point. For many
critics and musicians, Evans was the premier pianist
of his generation. Yet one suspects that many,
perhaps most, of his albums were purchased not by
jazz connoiseurs but by casual listeners who saw his
music as a superior grade of cocktail lounge music.
In the liner notes to his solo piano album Alone,
now out of print, Evans wrote:
"My solo piano professional experience has been
negligible and it is sad that this great tradition in jazz
is in danger of extinction because of the prevalent
public attitude relegating a single pianist to
background for conversation or dinner."
Listening to Bill Evans as background music is a
little like gargling with Chateau Lafite-Rothschild or
papering your living room wall with dollar bills — in
the parlance of economics it is a poor use of scarce
resources. Yet the superficial "prettiness" of his play
ing often invited precisely this type of attitude. The
subtleties of his music — the displaced rhythms, the
altered scales, the pioneering use of impressionistic
harmonies — were too often lost on all but the most
attentive listeners.
Subdued musicians such as Evans seem oddly out
of place in the nightclub atmosphere that permeates
most jazz performances. His demeanor at the piano
accentuated the introspective quality of his music.
With a strangely distant expression on his face he
would lean into the piano, his head tilted to the side
and his left ear only a few inches from the keyboard
— almost as though he were straining to hear some
elusive melody lingering at the tips of his fingers.
Thus transfixed he would sketch out a delicate web of
shimmering melodies a id chords, oblivious to the
audience which, for its own part, often felt like obtru
sive obsc 'ers at some private ritual.
Unlike most jazz pianists, Evans preferred to work
without wind instruments. During the two decades in
which he led his own group, he never featured a
trumpeter, saxophonist, guitarist, vocalist, or percus
sionist; instead he took the piano trio format —
piano, bass, drums — and honed it to new levels of
artistic perfection.
But outside of his live performances — in which he
typically remained within the trio context — he would
occasionally record with larger ensembles. Two such
sessions have been recently re-released on the Miles
tone double album The Interplay Sessions. Both of
these recording dates took place during the summer

of 1962 — in the midst of one of the most creative
periods in his career — and reveal an aggressive
attack that rarely surfaced in his playing of that time.
Here, as in three later quintet sessions Evans did for
Milestone, the presence of horn players appears to
rouse the pianist into a more assertive style of play
ing.
Although the two sessions were taped only weeks
apart, they show quite different sides of Evans' musi
cal personality. The first date finds him in the com
pany of guitarist Jim Hall and trumpeter Freddie
Hubbard. The playing is straight-ahead and the tem
pos are fast — unusually fast when one considers the
songs in question. Pieces such as "You Go to My
Head" or "I'll Never Smile Again," as their titles
perhaps indicate, are rarely played as anything but
slow dreamy ballads; here the quintet tears into them
with a vengeance. The result is one of the most atypi
cal albums of Evans long career.
The rhythmic feeling of this group differs radically
from that of Evans' various trios. With his smaller
groups Evans pioneered the concept of an "inter
nalized beat." The bassist and drummer were freed of
their traditional time-keeping responsibilities; in
stead they were given the opportunity to play more
complex counter-rhythms and counter-melodies.
Rather than stating the beat, each musician followed
it silently in his own head; the music was underplayed
yet rich in ingenious twists and turns — just when you
felt that the musicians had gone too far and lost
themselves in tl\e musical maze they were construct
ing, they would come together in an ensemble pas
sage and show the befuddled listener that they had
been following a strict beat all the time.
This approach, as one can imagine, made great

demands on the musicians; and the success of trio was
largely due to Evans' ability to find a series of brilliant
and sensitive bassists and drummers — most notably
Scott LaFaro, Paul Motian, Chuck Israels and Eddie
Gomez. At its best, the Bill Evans Trio showed a
rapport which stopped just short of telepathy.
The quintet recordings, however, were done with
different musicians, and Evans adopts a more driving
one might say a "jazzier" — rhythmic approach.
On Wrap Your T roubles in Dreams" he bops along
in a delightfully surprising fashion; here one can see
the often submerged influence of Wynton Kelly on
Evans playing, while hiding in the rear are traces of
Red Garland and Bud Powell.
The second quintet session is scarcely less unusual.
This date tocuses on Evans' skills as a composer — in
striking contrast to the leader's usual preference for
material from the American popular song tradition.
All seven numbers recorded with this quintet are
Evans originals, and the compositions are extremely
challenging with unexpected shifts in tempo and
tricky chord progressions: one can well believe pro
ducer Orrin Keepnews's claim that as many as 25
takes were made of individual songs.
Once again Evans is accompanied by Jim Hall, a
guitarist whose playing shares strong stylistic
similarities with Evans' approach to the piano.
Saxophonist Zoot Sims was a less obvious choice for
the group; a more traditional musician than Evans or
Hall, Sims made his reputation playing music far
different from the modernistic compositions featured
on this date. All things considered, he handles himself
admirably; his tone — a classicly "cool" sound
strongly reminiscent of Lester Young — is perfectly
suited to the sharply etched lines of Evans' pieces,
and his solos, if not adventurous, are anything but old
fashioned.
This is jazz that does not fit easily into any school. It
is by no means a representative example of Evans'
playing, nor is it typical of early '60s jazz. Had Evans
worked regularly with a quintet, his music might have
developed more along the lines of the Sims/Hall ses
sion.
All the same. The Interplay Sessions is well worth
the considered attention of serious jazz fans. The
creative peak which Bill Evans reached during the
late s()s and early '60s saw that artist produce a body
of work which changed the direction of modern jazz
piano. Yet outside of their interest as historical
documents, these albums speak to us with an im
mediacy and freshness that hides their age. One
hopes that Milestone's policy of re-releasing most of
its "Evans' catalog will bring his early work to the
attention of a new generation of jazz fans and musi
cians.

Evans originals, and the compositions are extremely
challenging with unexpected shifts in tempo and
tricky chord progressions: one can well believe pro
ducer Orrin Keepnews's claim that as many as 25
takes were made of individual songs.
Once again Evans is accompanied by Jim Hall, a
guitarist whose playing shares strong stylistic
similarities with Evans' approach to the piano.
Saxophonist Zoot Sims was a less obvious choice for
the group; a more traditional musician than Evans or
Hall, Sims made his reputation playing music far
different from the modernistic compositions featured
on this date. All things considered, he handles himself
admirably; his tone — a classicly "cool" sound
strongly reminiscent of Lester Young — is perfectly
suited to the sharply etched lines of Evans' pieces,
and his solos, if not adventurous, are anything but old
fashioned.
This is jazz that does not fit easily into any school. It
is by no means a representative example of Evans'
playing, nor is it typical of early '60s jazz. Had Evans
worked regularly with a quintet, his music might have
developed more along the lines of the Sims/Hall ses
sion.
All the same. The Interplay Sessions is well worth
the considered attention of serious jazz fans. The
creative peak which Bill Evans reached during the
late s()s and early '60s saw that artist produce a body
of work which changed the direction of modern jazz
piano. Yet outside of their interest as historical
documents, these albums speak to us with an im
mediacy and freshness that hides their age. One
hopes that Milestone's policy of re-releasing most of
its "Evans' catalog will bring his early work to the
attention of a new generation of jazz fans and musi
cians.

Subtlety is rarely a virtue of art forms that seek a
large popular following. Jazz is no exception to the
rule: artists who rely on sensitivity rather than on
empty bombast are often either ignored or else ad
mired for the wrong reasons.
The late Bill Evans is a case in point. For many
critics and musicians, Evans was the premier pianist
of his generation. Yet one suspects that many,
perhaps most, of his albums were purchased not by
jazz connoiseurs but by casual listeners who saw his
music as a superior grade of cocktail lounge music.
In the liner notes to his solo piano album Alone,
now out of print, Evans wrote:
"My solo piano professional experience has been
negligible and it is sad that this great tradition in jazz
is in danger of extinction because of the prevalent
public attitude relegating a single pianist to
background for conversation or dinner."
Listening to Bill Evans as background music is a
little like gargling with Chateau Lafite-Rothschild or
papering your living room wall with dollar bills — in
the parlance of economics it is a poor use of scarce
resources. Yet the superficial "prettiness" of his play
ing often invited precisely this type of attitude. The
subtleties of his music — the displaced rhythms, the
altered scales, the pioneering use of impressionistic
harmonies — were too often lost on all but the most
attentive listeners.
Subdued musicians such as Evans seem oddly out
of place in the nightclub atmosphere that permeates
most jazz performances. His demeanor at the piano
accentuated the introspective quality of his music.
With a strangely distant expression on his face he
would lean into the piano, his head tilted to the side
and his left ear only a few inches from the keyboard
— almost as though he were straining to hear some
elusive melody lingering at the tips of his fingers.
Thus transfixed he would sketch out a delicate web of
shimmering melodies a id chords, oblivious to the
audience which, for its own part, often felt like obtru
sive obsc 'ers at some private ritual.
Unlike most jazz pianists, Evans preferred to work
without wind instruments. During the two decades in
which he led his own group, he never featured a
trumpeter, saxophonist, guitarist, vocalist, or percus
sionist; instead he took the piano trio format —
piano, bass, drums — and honed it to new levels of
artistic perfection.
But outside of his live performances — in which he
typically remained within the trio context — he would
occasionally record with larger ensembles. Two such
sessions have been recently re-released on the Miles
tone double album The Interplay Sessions. Both of
these recording dates took place during the summer

of 1962 — in the midst of one of the most creative
periods in his career — and reveal an aggressive
attack that rarely surfaced in his playing of that time.
Here, as in three later quintet sessions Evans did for
Milestone, the presence of horn players appears to
rouse the pianist into a more assertive style of play
ing.
Although the two sessions were taped only weeks
apart, they show quite different sides of Evans' musi
cal personality. The first date finds him in the com
pany of guitarist Jim Hall and trumpeter Freddie
Hubbard. The playing is straight-ahead and the tem
pos are fast — unusually fast when one considers the
songs in question. Pieces such as "You Go to My
Head" or "I'll Never Smile Again," as their titles
perhaps indicate, are rarely played as anything but
slow dreamy ballads; here the quintet tears into them
with a vengeance. The result is one of the most atypi
cal albums of Evans long career.
The rhythmic feeling of this group differs radically
from that of Evans' various trios. With his smaller
groups Evans pioneered the concept of an "inter
nalized beat." The bassist and drummer were freed of
their traditional time-keeping responsibilities; in
stead they were given the opportunity to play more
complex counter-rhythms and counter-melodies.
Rather than stating the beat, each musician followed
it silently in his own head; the music was underplayed
yet rich in ingenious twists and turns — just when you
felt that the musicians had gone too far and lost
themselves in tl\e musical maze they were construct
ing, they would come together in an ensemble pas
sage and show the befuddled listener that they had
been following a strict beat all the time.
This approach, as one can imagine, made great

demands on the musicians; and the success of trio was
largely due to Evans' ability to find a series of brilliant
and sensitive bassists and drummers — most notably
Scott LaFaro, Paul Motian, Chuck Israels and Eddie
Gomez. At its best, the Bill Evans Trio showed a
rapport which stopped just short of telepathy.
The quintet recordings, however, were done with
different musicians, and Evans adopts a more driving
one might say a "jazzier" — rhythmic approach.
On Wrap Your T roubles in Dreams" he bops along
in a delightfully surprising fashion; here one can see
the often submerged influence of Wynton Kelly on
Evans playing, while hiding in the rear are traces of
Red Garland and Bud Powell.
The second quintet session is scarcely less unusual.
This date tocuses on Evans' skills as a composer — in
striking contrast to the leader's usual preference for
material from the American popular song tradition.
