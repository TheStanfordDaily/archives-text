This election is different. Bill, Doug
and Karen. Candidates. None of them
eats jelly beans. None of them grows
peanuts (though some support the in
dustry). They all can walk down stairs.
None of them have brothers who drink
beer — kegs at a time (they take care of
that themselves). This is different from
a Presidential election. This election is
for EDITOR of The Stanford Daily, a
position deserving respect. Right? So
VOTE.
