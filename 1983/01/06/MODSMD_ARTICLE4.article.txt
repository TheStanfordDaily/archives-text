Reagan considers meeting with Andropov
Washington — President Reagan said last night he agreed "in principle"
that a summit meeting with Soviet leader Yuri Andropov was desirable if it
became clear that anything could be accomplished by a face-to-face meeting.
I n a nationally televised news conference from the White House, the presi
dent said that once adequate planning for a meeting between the super
powers had taken place, "I would welcome a summit just as I welcomed his
(Andropov's) suggestion about continuing the talks on the reduction of
arms."
Despite the conciliatory tone of the president's remarks, White House of
ficials emphasized after the news conference that Reagan's basic suspicion of
Soviet intentions remains unchanged and that he will still require "tangible
evidence" of Soviet sincerity before he participates in a summit.
These officials confirmed that Reagan responded, "So what?" when he
was first told of Andropov's suggestion for a summit meeting. They said the
president viewed the Soviet leader's vaguely worded offer as a public rela
tions gesture and that Reagan was responding in kind last night.
Last week. White House spokesman Larry Speakes said the adminis
tration saw "nothing new" in Andropov's proposal, which was contained in
a written response to the editors of Hearst newspapers.
Other officials said that before Reagan would agree to participate in a
summit meeting he would expect improvement in international behavior,
particularly in Afghanistan, by the Soviets, better treatment of Russian dissi
dents and progress in the nuclear arms control talks at Geneva.

unchanged and that he had talked with advisers yesterday about
spelling out his specific objections to Soviet international con
duct at the news conference.
But the view that prevailed, one official said, was that the Sovi
ets had seized the propaganda advantage with the widely re
ported summit plan. "The president didn't want to be throwing
cold water on the idea of a summit," one official said.
Pope names 18 new cardinals
Vatican City — Pope John Paul II announced yesterday the
names of 18 priests who will become cardinals, including Chica
go Archbishop Joseph Bernardin and Archbishop Jozef Glemp,
leader of the Roman Catholic Church in the pope's native Po
land.
The priests, to be elevated at a meeting of the College of
Cardinals Feb. 2, come from 15 countries. Three are from
Eastern Europe and one is from the Soviet Union. It is the first
time a churchman living in the Soviet Union has been named a
cardinal.
Bernardin, who leads the largest archdiocese in the United
States, was the onlv American named.
Cardinals are the pope's key advisers and the 120 voting mem
bers of the College of Cardinals have exclusive right to elect the
pope.
The appointments to the college represent a slight shift in rep
resentation bv continent, with Europe increasing from 50 per
cent to 51 percent, while Latin America dropped 1 percent to
16.6 percent. The percentage of Italians also dropped slightly.
Notably absent from the list was Archbishop Paul Marcinkus
of Cicero, Illinois, the head of the scandal-tinged Vatican Bank
and the Vatican City's chief administrator.
Traditionally, his post is one held by a cardinal. Vatican
sources said the pope would not make a decision about elevating
Marcinkus until completion of an investigation by Italy and the
Vatican into the dealings of the Vatican Bank.
A Vatican observer said the new cardinals are a "mix of
progressives and conservatives — if anything, they're more on
the progressive side."
For example, Bernardin led a committee of U.S. bishops that
drafted a pastoral letter condemning nuclear war and challeng
ing the current U.S. strategic planning.
Court refuses to block Medi-Cal cuts
San Francisco — The state Supreme Court yesterday refused
to block drastic Medi-Cal cuts despite arguments that the re
duced coverage constituted "genocide of the elderly."
The denial was issued without comment.
The Bay Area Legal Foundation, on behalf of three Medi-Cal
recipients and a taxpayer, asked for a stay on grounds the cuts
violate the federal Medicaid Act. That law says state must pro
vide "medicallv necessary" services and drugs.
The cuts took effect Jan. 1 under a new Medi-Cal law reducing
coverage solely to treatment "necessary to protect life or prevent
significant disability."
The legislation allowed the state Health Department to delete
from the Medi-Cal Drug Formula such standard drugs as those
preventing illnesses or relieving pain.
The petition to the high court claimed the law reduces care
below the level set by federal law. And it also violates a federal
requirement that doctors, not the state, decide what is medically
necessary for patients, the petition said.
The law also transferred medical care of some 350,000 medi
cally indigent adults to counties, and Dr. Alexander Riskin, one
of the foundation's directors, claimed that would burden the
counties financially and mean less care for patients.
The Attorney General's office opposed a stay, saying it would
do "grevious harm to a state already beleaguered by an economic
crisis.
Soviet nuclear satellite may fall
Washington — A Soviet spy satellite, powered by a nuclear re
actor, is wobbling out of orbit and may plunge to earth in late
January, the Department of Defense said yesterday.
The officials said it was not clear precisely when the Cosmos
satellite would begin reentry into the Earth's atmosphere, how
much of the satellite would survive the searing temperatures of

reentrv, or w here the surviving chunks would land.
Defense officials said the satellite's reentry time could be de
termined well in advance of the event, but that they could predict
where the debris would fall onlv within 90 minutes of impact.
But Nuclear medicine specialists said that if the satellite's reac
tor survived the plunee intact, it could pose "significant" dan
gers to public health from radiation, and might even explode in a
small nuclear blast.
In a worst-case scenario, radioactive debris could be showered
over parts of the Earth as the satellite disintegrates during reen
try, posing what Dr. Henry Kendall, chairman of the Union of
Concerned Scientists, called a "lethal" threat over dozens of
square miles.
The Department of Defense said in a statement that it was
"carefully" monitoring the Soviet satellite and that part of it
"which we believe contains, a nuclear reactor as its power supply
will probably re-enter the earth's atmopsphere in late January."
U.S. officials, who asked not to be identified, said the United
States has advised other nations of the satellite's deteriorating
orbit, and has asked the Soviet Union for additional data on the
satellite to more accurately predict its behavior.
In January 1978, a similar Soviet satellite completing a six
month mission also wobbled out of orbit. Technkiuns from
dozens of countries tracked the satellite for weeks before it final
ly burned through the atmosphere over the northern Pacific.
At least one radioactive chunk of debris from that satellite fell
in a sparsely populated section of northern Canada Jan. 24, 1978,
about 200 miles east of Yellowknife. Technicians said that the
radiation declined to harmless levels about 100 feet from the
crater's edge.
Warsaw Pact proposes peace treaty
Moscow — The Warsaw Pact nations of Eastern Europe, in a
move apparently aimed at winning support for the Kremlin's
stance in European nuclear arms control talks, offered yesterday
to sign a nonaggression treaty with the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization.
A communique issued at the end of a two-day summit of the
seven Warsaw Pact nations in Prague and carried here by the of
ficial Tass news agency, described the offer as a "new, major
peace proposal" but gave no details.
The communique said the summit, the first in three years, had
unanimously approved a "political declaration" that would be
published separately. Czechoslovakia, the host country, will
circulate the declaration to the United Nations and to members
of the European Security Conference, which produced the 1975
Helsinki accords on East-West cooperation and human rights.
The declaration is expected to give further insight to what the
communique characterized only as a "treaty on the mutual non
use of armed force and the maintenance of relations of peace"
that NATO nations and others would be urged to sign with the
Warsaw Pact.
Western diplomats said the non-aggression pact was similar to
unsuccesful proposals by the Soviets in 1958 and again in 1963.
Soviet compliance with any such pledge would be impossible to
verify or enforce and thus would have little value except as prop
aganda, the diplomats said. Some Western analysts noted with
irony that the summit chose to revive the idea of a non-ag
gression pact in Prague, a city where the Warsaw Pact, led by So
viet tanks, snuffed out a liberal reform movement in 1968.
"The Soviets have frequently proposed arms control measures
that have no verification provisions or are simply unverifiable,"
one specialist in arms control issues said. "This would be no
more verifiable than their pledge not to use nuclear weapons
first. It wouldn't satisfy any of the basic security needs we per
ceive in Europe."
HUD adopts 'voluntary' rights policy
Washington — The Reagan administration, in another shift in
civil rights enforcement, has adopted a largely voluntary ap
proach toward landlords and brokers who discriminate against
people looking for housing.
At the Housing and Urban Development Department, whose
authority in such cases always has been limited, officials now
stress cooperation with the real estate industry rather than con
tributing to aggressive civil rights groups as in the past. They
have created, with much fanfare, a network of housing advisory
boards, but the boards are not permitted to investigate fair-hous
ing complaints or to sue anyone for discrimination.
An even more dramatic change has occurred at the Justice De
partment, which wields the government's only real legal power in
these cases. Justice has filed only two housing bias lawsuits in the
two years since President Reagan took office, compared with a
previous average of more than 30 cases a year.
Knowledgeable officials say that Justice lawyers have been
told to stop bringing these cases unless they can prove intentional
discrimination, a more rigorous standard than the courts re
quire. Even Antonio Monroig, HUD's assistant secretary for
fair housing, savs he believes this is too high a legal hurdle.
Monroig said he doesn't understand why Justice has accepted
only two of the 25 housing cases referred by HUD last year.
"I would certainly like to know their criteria for filing the suits
so we don't waste our time sending a case over that's not going to

he filed," he said.
In general, however, Monroig argues that working with the
real estate industry is the best way to eliminate the causes of dis
crimination.
"We are giving more emphasis to the voluntary programs, but
we re not diminishing enforcement," Monroig said. "We'll never
be able to take everv complaint to court. We don't have the re
sources, and it would be very costly. These voluntary programs
trv to change people's attitudes instead."
But critics are skeptical.
The effectiveness of HUD's fair housing office has never
been at as low an ebb as it is now," said Martin E. Sloane, direc
tor of the National Committee Against Discrimination in Hous
ing. "Morale there is so low as to be indescribable."
Defense surveys $8-11 billion in cuts
W ashington — The Pentagon is studying ways to cut its budget
lor next year by $8 billion to $11 billion, officials said yesterday.
Despite the unbending public line of President Reagan and
Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger that the defense budget
cannot be cut, Pentagon budget chiefs have been ordered to
assess the impact of a possible cut that size and how it might be
made.
The cut would be Irom $285 billion in total obligational au
thority that the armed services had been told they could count
on. That represents new spending commitments the Pentagon
can make in the fiscal year and is different from the amount that
actually will be spent. Spending for fiscal 1984 had been
projected at $247 billion.
Weinberger's new willingness to consider cuts, officials said,
stems from new Reagan administration projections that the fed
eral deficit will be $200 billion in fiscal 1984 and as much as $280
billion bv 1988, without spendingcuts or tax increases. The presi
dent discussed those figures with Cabinet members Tuesday.
Weinberger, in his first two years as defense secretary, was able
to light off efforts by Office of Management and Budget Director
David Stockman and others to cut the Pentagon budget before
submitting it to Congress, though in each year it later was cut
slightly.
He still may refuse to budge on the projected total, but he has
taken the first step toward cuts by directing Pentagon comptrol
lers to see how much damage an $11 billion cut would do to Rea
gan's five-vear plan "to rearm America."
Suspect denies poisoning charges
San Jose, California — Richard Ray Bowen pleaded innocent
yesterday to charges he tried to murder his wife with a massive
dose of cyanide, then was returned to jail when a judge refused to
release him on bail.
Susan Bowen, who went into convulsions and almost died af
ter ingesting the lethal poison on Nov. 26, smiled at her husband
across the courtroom and pleaded with Municipal Judge Ste
phen Manlev for her husband's freedom.
A statement written by defense lawyer Melvin Belli for Mrs.
Bowen was entered into the record after the judge asked her
whether it was accurate. She nodded her head weakly to confirm
it was.
Mrs. Bowen's voice was affected by the stroke she suffered af
ter the cyanide sent her into a coma and caused brain stem dam
age.
"I have been married since 1972 to the defendant, Dick
Bowen, and he is a good husband," her statement said. "I in no
way think or suspect him of trying to injure me. Our two children
love him and want him admitted to bail on his own recogni
zance."
"She wants him home," said Belli, the flamboyant San Fran
cisco attorney who is representing Bowen. "The two children
want him home. His parents want him home, and the neighbors
want him home."
But the judge rejected the plea, saying the crime Bowen is ac
cused of is not a bailable offense under the provisions of Proposi
tion 4, a measure passed by voters last year. Belli said he would
appeal.
Market active as rally wanes
Stock prices turned mixed in active trading yesterday as the
rally that began in Tuesday's session faded.
But energy issues were strong for the second straight day.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up about five points
in early trading, was down 1.19 at 1044.89 by the close. Advanc
ing issues outnumbered declines, however, by almost 2 to 1 on
the New York Stock Exchange.
