Reagan considers meeting with Andropov
Washington — President Reagan said last night he agreed "in principle"
that a summit meeting with Soviet leader Yuri Andropov was desirable if it
became clear that anything could be accomplished by a face-to-face meeting.
I n a nationally televised news conference from the White House, the presi
dent said that once adequate planning for a meeting between the super
powers had taken place, "I would welcome a summit just as I welcomed his
(Andropov's) suggestion about continuing the talks on the reduction of
arms."
Despite the conciliatory tone of the president's remarks, White House of
ficials emphasized after the news conference that Reagan's basic suspicion of
Soviet intentions remains unchanged and that he will still require "tangible
evidence" of Soviet sincerity before he participates in a summit.
These officials confirmed that Reagan responded, "So what?" when he
was first told of Andropov's suggestion for a summit meeting. They said the
president viewed the Soviet leader's vaguely worded offer as a public rela
tions gesture and that Reagan was responding in kind last night.
Last week. White House spokesman Larry Speakes said the adminis
tration saw "nothing new" in Andropov's proposal, which was contained in
a written response to the editors of Hearst newspapers.
Other officials said that before Reagan would agree to participate in a
summit meeting he would expect improvement in international behavior,
particularly in Afghanistan, by the Soviets, better treatment of Russian dissi
dents and progress in the nuclear arms control talks at Geneva.
