# NLRB issues complaints against University, USW
## 
### DAVID AZRIN Senior staff writer 
The National Labor Relations Board
(NLRB) has issued complaints against
both the University and United Stan
ford Workers (USW) for incidents
which occurred on the picket lines dur
ing last fall's labor dispute and at the
Stanford University Hospital last year.
Two separate hearings have been
scheduled in March to investigate the
charges.
On March 3, an administrative law
judge will hear the NLRB complaint
that hospital management "unlawfully
interrogated an employee concerning
the filing of a grievance and that the
University maintained a discriminatory
rule concerning the posting of union
materials," according to NLRB at
torney Raul Thormbourne.
On March 24, an administrative law
judge will hear an NLRB complaint
that union picketing during last fall's
strike against the University "was not
only directed against the primary em
ployer, the University, but also against
secondary neutral employers in hopes
of enmeshing them into the conflict and
coercing the University into succumb
ing to the union's objectives," accord
ing to NLRB attorney David Dam
ingas.
"When a complaint is issued, it
means that evidence has been presented
to the (NLRB) that is sufficient so that
the (NLRB) feels that an investigative
hearing is necessary in order to de
termine if there has been a violation of
the National Labor Relations Act," ac
cording to Susan De Jongh-Kearl, Uni
versity associate staff counsel.
The hearings will certainly open old
wounds in labor-management relations
caused by last fall's 30-day strike, the
longest in Stanford history..
The union's complaint against the
University involves four separate inci
dents at the Stanford University Hospi
tal in February, April, June and Sep
tember of 1982, according to USW field
attorney Mary Ann Tenuto.
Some of these incidents occurred dur
ing the campaign period for the No
vember union election in which hospital
service and maintenence employees
voted 778-253 against unionization.
But the ruling will not affect the elec
tion's outcome, Thormbourne said.
"These incidents also took place in
the context of the campaign but the
(NLRB) has reasoned that these inci
dents are not sufficient to overturn the
election," he said.
If the judge rules in the union's favor
the University will only be required to
"post a notice admitting that they were
wrong in doing it and promising that
they will not do it again," according to

Thormbourne.
The complaint includes five counts
against the University, according to
Tenuto.
"Someone was discouraged from
seeking advice about how to file a griev
ance and threatened that things
'wouldn't go well' if he filed the griev
ance," Tenuto said.
In addition, the complaint alleges
that a manager "unlawfully questioned
an employee about his reason for sup
porting the union" and that "an em
ployee was denied access to a union or
ganizer in a public cafeteria by security
guards," Tenuto said.
"The union also alleges that a certain
supervisor was witnessed by an employ
ee removing union material from a bul
letin board while leaving other materi
al," Thormbourne said.
According to De Jongh-Kearl, "The
hospital view is that no actions the hos
pital engaged in consitituted a violation
of the National Labor Relations Act."
The University's complaint against
the USW alleges that "during the strike,
reserve gates were set up at various con
duction sites exclusively for the use of
nuetral or secondary employers with
which the union had no complaint," ac
cording to De Jongh-Kearl.
Reserve gates at the contruction sites
for new-student housing and Peter
Coutts, the entrance to the
Cardiovascular Research Building near
the Medical Center, and the Alpine
Road entrance to the Stanford Linear
Accelerator were unlawfully picketed,
I)e Jongh-Kearl said.
This picketing caused delays in con
struction and cost the University mon
ey, she said.
"It's obvious that when you cause
some construction delays you incur
some costs," De Jongh-Kearl said.
''Stanford people, did not go in and
out the gate and there was no reason to
picket those gates except to force them
to shut them down and put more pres
sure on the University."
If the judge rules in the University's
favor, the union will be required to
"post a notice that it will not engage in
that activity again," according to Dam
ingas.
In addition, the University may take
the case to a federal court and demand
repayment of damages caused by the
construction delays, Damingas said.
But De Jongh-Kearl said that the
University has not yet decided if it will
take the case to a federal court if the
N LR B judge rules in its favor.
"We will have to decide at that time,"
she said.
Rulings on both complaints will
probably be issued 4-6 months after the
March hearings, Damingas said.

vember union election in which hospital
service and maintenence employees
voted 778-253 against unionization.
But the ruling will not affect the elec
tion's outcome, Thormbourne said.
"These incidents also took place in
the context of the campaign but the
(NLRB) has reasoned that these inci
dents are not sufficient to overturn the
election," he said.
If the judge rules in the union's favor
the University will only be required to
"post a notice admitting that they were
wrong in doing it and promising that
they will not do it again," according to

Thormbourne.
The complaint includes five counts
against the University, according to
Tenuto.
"Someone was discouraged from
seeking advice about how to file a griev
ance and threatened that things
'wouldn't go well' if he filed the griev
ance," Tenuto said.
In addition, the complaint alleges
that a manager "unlawfully questioned
an employee about his reason for sup
porting the union" and that "an em
ployee was denied access to a union or
ganizer in a public cafeteria by security
guards," Tenuto said.
"The union also alleges that a certain
supervisor was witnessed by an employ
ee removing union material from a bul
letin board while leaving other materi
al," Thormbourne said.
According to De Jongh-Kearl, "The
hospital view is that no actions the hos
pital engaged in consitituted a violation
of the National Labor Relations Act."
The University's complaint against
the USW alleges that "during the strike,
reserve gates were set up at various con
duction sites exclusively for the use of
nuetral or secondary employers with
which the union had no complaint," ac
cording to De Jongh-Kearl.
Reserve gates at the contruction sites
for new-student housing and Peter
Coutts, the entrance to the
Cardiovascular Research Building near
the Medical Center, and the Alpine
Road entrance to the Stanford Linear
Accelerator were unlawfully picketed,
I)e Jongh-Kearl said.
This picketing caused delays in con
struction and cost the University mon
ey, she said.
"It's obvious that when you cause
some construction delays you incur
some costs," De Jongh-Kearl said.
''Stanford people, did not go in and
out the gate and there was no reason to
picket those gates except to force them
to shut them down and put more pres
sure on the University."
If the judge rules in the University's
favor, the union will be required to
"post a notice that it will not engage in
that activity again," according to Dam
ingas.
In addition, the University may take
the case to a federal court and demand
repayment of damages caused by the
construction delays, Damingas said.
But De Jongh-Kearl said that the
University has not yet decided if it will
take the case to a federal court if the
N LR B judge rules in its favor.
"We will have to decide at that time,"
she said.
Rulings on both complaints will
probably be issued 4-6 months after the
March hearings, Damingas said.
The National Labor Relations Board
(NLRB) has issued complaints against
both the University and United Stan
ford Workers (USW) for incidents
which occurred on the picket lines dur
ing last fall's labor dispute and at the
Stanford University Hospital last year.
Two separate hearings have been
scheduled in March to investigate the
charges.
On March 3, an administrative law
judge will hear the NLRB complaint
that hospital management "unlawfully
interrogated an employee concerning
the filing of a grievance and that the
University maintained a discriminatory
rule concerning the posting of union
materials," according to NLRB at
torney Raul Thormbourne.
On March 24, an administrative law
judge will hear an NLRB complaint
that union picketing during last fall's
strike against the University "was not
only directed against the primary em
ployer, the University, but also against
secondary neutral employers in hopes
of enmeshing them into the conflict and
coercing the University into succumb
ing to the union's objectives," accord
ing to NLRB attorney David Dam
ingas.
"When a complaint is issued, it
means that evidence has been presented
to the (NLRB) that is sufficient so that
the (NLRB) feels that an investigative
hearing is necessary in order to de
termine if there has been a violation of
the National Labor Relations Act," ac
cording to Susan De Jongh-Kearl, Uni
versity associate staff counsel.
The hearings will certainly open old
wounds in labor-management relations
caused by last fall's 30-day strike, the
longest in Stanford history..
The union's complaint against the
University involves four separate inci
dents at the Stanford University Hospi
tal in February, April, June and Sep
tember of 1982, according to USW field
attorney Mary Ann Tenuto.
Some of these incidents occurred dur
ing the campaign period for the No
vember union election in which hospital
service and maintenence employees
voted 778-253 against unionization.
