# ASSU votes funding for lobbying office
## 
### KAREN SPRINGEN 
The ASSU has approved plans and
$145 in start-up money for a lobbying
office here to address student issues on
the state and local level.
Lobbying could start early next year
on issues such as financial aid and stu
dent loans, according to Yolanda
Townsend, a Council of Presidents
(COP) member. Initially, the efforts to
sway legislators will consist mainly of
letter-writing and research, she said.
According to Townsend, a Council
of Presidents (COP) member, students
have a vital interest in legislative and
budgetary policy decisions.
A director, as yet unchosen, will re
port to the ASSU during its Jan. 25
meeting on the office's progress. At that
time supplemental appropriations will
be considered for the office's opera
tions.
Funding will depend largely on other

campus groups, Townsend said. The
ASSU lobbying group could provide
staffing and share costs with other
groups, such as Stanford-in-Govern
ment.
Possible sources of revenue include
the ASSU, foundations, the SCIRE in
novation fund, alumni donations, Uni
versity departments and other groups
on campus, Townsend said.
The student lobbying committee will
serve as the central coordinating office
for student groups, giving them a uni
fied, more powerful voice in govern
ment, Townsend said.
She said the student lobbyists can
help coordinate the efforts of groups
like the Stanford Progressive Alliance
and the Graduate Student Association,
which are both interested in promoting
financial aid.
Bob Freelen, associate vice president
for public affairs and one of the Univer
sity's top Sacramento and Washington,
D.C. lobbyists, said he supports the
plan. "I think it's a fine idea. The stu
dents in the independent colleges and
universities have not done very much in
this area and they probably should."
Kreelan said conflicts between stu
dent and University lobbying groups
would be minimal. "By and large the
convergence of interest is greater than
the divergence of interest," he said, cit
ing previous agreement on draft regis
tration procedures.
Freelen said, "We would be delighted
to introduce them to people we know
... It might provide some shortcuts for
them."
Jacvn Mitchell, legislative analyst for
the office of public affairs, said, "We'll
try to cooperate in any way we can."
Last summer Townsend, who au
thored the proposal and the legislation
for the lobbying office, served as an in
tern for Rep. Mervyn Dymally (D-
Calif.) in Washington.
Last spring, the Rod Beckstrom,
Mark Epstein, Cynthia Matthewson
and Townsend slate included the lobby
ing group in its platform.
According to senator James
McGrath, a sponsor of the senate bill to
establish the association lobbying of
fice, student lobbyists will research is
sues and present them to the senate,
which must approve the issue and
stance before lobbying takes place. The
senate will also be able to initiate issues.
Most state schools use student-body
lobbying effectively, McGrath said. "If
a bunch of students lobby, politicians
are convinced there are votes out
there," he said.
According to McGrath, Stanford ad
ministrators are seen politically as lob
bying for the University. "They (Uni
versity administrators) are concerned
with fiscal viability," he said. Thus the
University is not necessarily taking ac
tions on behalf of students.
"Student issues are outweighed by
the general interests of the entire com
munity," he said.
The University will benefit from two
separate lobbying groups, McGrath
said. "The University feels more com
fortable lobbying for something stu
dents are also lobbying for," he said.
Student and University priorities dif
fer, McGrath said. The University em
phasizes research, for example, which
has little direct student impact.
According to Townsend, many
private schools belong to the Coalition
of Independent College and University
Students, which lobbies on the behalf of
students. Membership fees are $50.

ifornia Colleges and Universities lob
