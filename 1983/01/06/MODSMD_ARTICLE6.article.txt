# ASSU votes funding for lobbying office
## 
### KAREN SPRINGEN 
The ASSU has approved plans and
$145 in start-up money for a lobbying
office here to address student issues on
the state and local level.
Lobbying could start early next year
on issues such as financial aid and stu
dent loans, according to Yolanda
Townsend, a Council of Presidents
(COP) member. Initially, the efforts to
sway legislators will consist mainly of
letter-writing and research, she said.
According to Townsend, a Council
of Presidents (COP) member, students
have a vital interest in legislative and
budgetary policy decisions.
A director, as yet unchosen, will re
port to the ASSU during its Jan. 25
meeting on the office's progress. At that
time supplemental appropriations will
be considered for the office's opera
tions.
Funding will depend largely on other

campus groups, Townsend said. The
ASSU lobbying group could provide
staffing and share costs with other
groups, such as Stanford-in-Govern
ment.
Possible sources of revenue include
the ASSU, foundations, the SCIRE in
novation fund, alumni donations, Uni
versity departments and other groups
on campus, Townsend said.
The student lobbying committee will
serve as the central coordinating office
for student groups, giving them a uni
fied, more powerful voice in govern
ment, Townsend said.
She said the student lobbyists can
help coordinate the efforts of groups
like the Stanford Progressive Alliance
and the Graduate Student Association,
which are both interested in promoting
financial aid.
