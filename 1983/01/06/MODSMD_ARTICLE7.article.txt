The Mcdical Center today opens a clinic which
aims to put the University's advanced research
about diabetics to work for patients. !j|
The Diabetic and Metabolism ( linic will provide
"improved care and treatment for patients through
the expertise and education of clinic specialists," ac
cording to Asst. Endocrinology Prof. Frederic
Kraemer.
Although many other university medical centers
have similar clinics to serve diabetic patients, Stan
ford's clinic will be unique in its emphasis on re
search, according to Gerontology P r °f- Gerald Re

aven. "Stanford has for a long time been preeminent
in research and knowledge about diabetes. We have
been recognized nationally but never before have we
translated that knowledge into care. Now we can,"
Reaven said.
"We will have the environment to transfer new
knowledge into care and likewise to use the care set
ting to provide knowledge," he added.
Kraemer and Reaven said the clinic will follow
the national trend of providing more aggressive
treatment for diabetic patients, especially in the area
of long-term complications, as well as supporting re
search.

The cost of the new clinic has been nominal, ac
cording to Kraemer. "I sec it as more of an organiza
tional and redistributional change. The new clinic
will be within the existing framework of the out-pa
tient Endocrinology Clinic," he said.
The clinic will meet once a week due to time and
staff limitations and will be run on a consultative
basis. "Some patients will return directly to their
primary physicians," while others will continue with
the clinic, Kraemer said. Staff members include
Kraemer, Reaven and Prof, of Medicine Michael
Grecnfcld. Specialists in the fields of podiatry, nutri
tion, nephrology, neurology and opthamology will
also participate in the clinic.
