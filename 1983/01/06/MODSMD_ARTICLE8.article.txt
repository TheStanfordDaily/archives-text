# Talks resume
## Nations disagree on agenda 
### 
Compiled from news reports and wire services
Flanked by an American delegation, Israeli
and Lebanese negotiators will today resume
talks aimed at easing tensions between the
long-time foes.
Negotiators have met three times in the past
week, but have been unable to agree on an
agenda for the talks. The Lebanese, rep
resented by Antoine Fattal, want the meetings
to result in a withdrawal of an estimated 60,000
foreign troops from Lebanese soil while David
Kimche, Israel's representative, wants them to
end in a normalization of relations.
The talks are alternating between Khalde, a
Beirut suburb, and Qiryat Shemona, a northern
Israeli border town. And despite attempts by
Morris Draper, the U.S. special envoy, little has
been accomplished at the meetings. The main
stumbling block has been a matter of priorities.
Essentially, the Israelis want normalization of
relations with Lebanon to top the agenda while

the Lebanese want a narrower focus â€” the
withdrawal of Israeli, Palestinian and Syrian
troops from the war-torn country.
The Israelis place the withdrawal of troops
lower on the list, insisting that withdrawal
would be a logical result of reopening trade,
cultural and tourist exchange and other ties with
Lebanon.
The Lebanese government, led by President
Amin Gemayel, has rejected Israel's demands,
in part because it does not wish to alienate the
Arab world. Saudi Arabia has threatened to
withhold urgently needed reconstruction funds
for Lebanon if Gemayel's government con
cludes an agreement that deals with topics other
than an Israeli withdrawal. Lebanon is urging
the American delegation to pressure Israel to
drop some of its demands so the talks on the
troop pullout can get under way.
But Israeli officials are adhering to the line of
argument already established by Israeli Prime
Minister Menachem Begin. Speaking at a con
ference on "the psychology of stress" in Tel
Aviv Sunday, Deputy Foreign Minister Yehuda
Ben-Meir said that Israel would not agree to
withdraw the troops that invaded Lebanon last
June without first creating "good neighborly
relations" with Lebanon.
Israel is reportedly seeking the right to main
tain early-warning stations and to conduct air
and naval surveillance in Lebanon. It is also
asking for a commitment that the Palestinian
Liberation Organization will withdraw its re
maining forces and free all Israeli prisoners of
war before a simultaneous withdrawal of Israeli
and Syrian troops from Lebanon takes place.
With such conflicting political objectives, ob
servers say a breakthrough in the talks is un
likely until Begin meets with President Reagan
next month in Washington.
