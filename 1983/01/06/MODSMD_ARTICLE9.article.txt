## Mideast outlook: negotiations stall, crisis continues Peace plan bogged down 
### 
Compiled from news reports and wire ser
vices
As Israeli and Lebanese
negotiators try to bring about a
settlement of the Lebanon con
flict, efforts to reach a broader
solution to the Arab-Israeli dis
pute continue.
President Reagan last week
met with King Hussein of Jordan
to try to convince him to join the
peace process, but Hussein's ob
jections to Israeli settlements on
the West Bank led toanimpasse.
So far Reagan has made little
progress with the peace plan he
unveiled in September. The plan
envisaged a Palestinian state on
the West Bank and Gaza to be
federated with Jordan. Reagan
hoped that Hussein would agree
to join Mideast peace negotia
tions as part of a solution to the
problem of providing the Pales
tinians with a homeland.
But the plan has become bog
ged down because of the Israelis'
unwillingness to stop settlement
activity and Hussein's refusal to
join the negotiations.
With the Palestinian Libera
tion Organization's military ap
paratus destroyed in last sum
mer's Israeli invasion of Leba
non, Reagan hoped that a dip
lomatic compromise could be
found that would allow the Is
raelis and the Palestinians to
start talking.
Israeli Prime Minister
Menachem Begin has stated re
peatedly that Israel would never

give up the West Bank and Gaza
which it has occupied since the
1967 Six-Day War. But Ameri
can diplomats hope that if Hus
sein would come forward and
offer to negotiate with the Is
raelis, Begin would be pressured
into compromise.
But the Arabs have so far de
manded that the United States
put pressure on Israel to stop the
settlements before peace negoti
ations can be discussed.
Hussein has also claimed that
he needs a mandate from the
PLO and the Arab League be
fore he can consider speaking for
the Palestinian people. The Arab
League failed at its summit con
ference several months ago to
give Hussein such status.

There have been indications,
however, that Hussein may be
coming closer to an agreement
with PLO leader Yasser Arafat
on how to approach the peace
process without compromising
Palestinian goals too much.
Arafat has flown from his new
headquarters in Tunis to
Amman for talks with Hussein.
A top PLO'aide to Arafat,
Khalid al Hassan, accompanied
Hussein on his trip to
Washington last week and was
briefed regularly on the King's
talks with American leaders,
providing another clue to the
new dialogue emerging between
Hussein and Arafat.

Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak has called on Arafat to
accept the Reagan peace plan
before it is too late; Saudi Ara
bian and Morrocan leaders have
offered similar advice. Many of
ficials fear that by waiting too
long the Palestinians may find
the West Bank permanently
changed by continued Israeli set
tlements.
Mubarak has also warned that
continued Israeli occupation of
Lebanon could play into the
hands of Arab hardliners.
So far, however, American
pressure has been unsuccessful
in bringing about Israeli with
drawal from Lebanon â€¢
