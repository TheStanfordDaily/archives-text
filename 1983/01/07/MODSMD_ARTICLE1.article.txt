# University still awaits decision on Medi-Cal
## 
### KRISTEN CHRISTOPHER Senior staff writer 
A decision on whether the patient
make-up of Stanford University Hospi
tal will be determined by their ability to
pay for health care services has been
put on hold, due to a delay by state
Medi-Cal officials.
The decision about the Hospital's
Medi-Cal contract, which would ena
ble it to continue to care for Medi-Cal
patients, was supposed to have been
made by Jan. 1, the same day that the
responsibility for care of Medically In
digent Adults (MIAs) was transferred
to county hospitals.
MIAs are people who cannot qualify
for Medi-Cal, yet do not have the re
sources to pay for health care services.
Before the first of the year, private
hospitals were able to care for them at
the expense of the state. Now they will
be admitted only in emergency situa
tions.
Stanford Hospital is still admitting
Medi-Cal patients, but James Silver
man, the Hospital's chief of staff said,
"If we don't get the contract, they will
join that group of MIAs."
Legislation requiring that hospitals
contract with the state if they want to
accept Medi-Cal patients was signed by
former Gov. Jerry Brown last June and
became effective Jan. 1.
A team of negotiators from Stan
ford, including Silverman, was in
volved in discussions with Medi-Cal of
ficials and submitted a contract bid to
the state in mid-November. State offi
cials originally told the Hospital the de

cision would be made by Dec. 1, ac
cording to Mike Goodkind, of the Stan
ford Medical Center News Bureau.
Although Silverman said,"We don't
know what the essence of the problem
is," Ed Leibson, the state Medi-Cal of
ficial handling Stanford's case, said the
delay was generated primarily by the
holiday season.
"We're continuing to negotiate with
other hospitals," Leibson said. When
the negotiations with hospitals in the
Palo Alto and San Jose areas conclude,
the decision concerning Stanford will
be made.
Leibson said the decision will be
made soon but he said he could give no
specific date or any indication of what
that decision might be.
"We're not speaking to the people in
Sacramento," Silverman said.
If the Hospital does not receive a
contract, Medi-Cal patients would no
longer be able to be admitted. They
would be able to receive care at any
hospital that has a contract with the
state.
MIAs, however, are only able to go
to county hospitals.
MIAs constituted less than 3
percent of the patients at Stanford
Hospital. Silverman explained that,
while the number of MIAs was not
large, their presence did affect the
training of medical students. Since
many MIAs suffer trauma and serious
illnesses, their presence in the Hospital
served to broaden the types of condi
tions to which the students were ex

More important than the effect on
training, Silverman said, is the reduc
tion in the quality of care patients may
receive at the county hospitals.
"The perception that you can get the
same care anywhere is a misperception
on the part of the government," he
said.

There is currently one MIA with
leukemia at the Hospital whois too sick
to be transferred to a county hospital;

Ann Moses, special assistant to the

that there has been an increase in their
census, and in particular, in the number
of "unsponsored" patients or MIAs.
