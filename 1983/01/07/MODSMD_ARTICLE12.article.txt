## The 						Stanford Daily Speech issues remain relevant 
### 
Next week the University must file a brief in
response to an appeal filed with the Appellate
Court of California by former Prof. H. Bruce
Franklin. Franklin, once tenured here, was dis
missed by the University more than 10 years ago
for delivering a barrage of speeches that the Uni
versity claims incited students to riot.
The dismissal received national attention be
cause it brings into the limelight important ques
tions about academic freedom and freedom of
speech. Franklin has since gained a position as a
full professor at the Newark campus of Rutgers
University. Ten years have obscured the cir
cumstances of Franklin's speeches, but imagine
these two scenarios as the two parties now describe
the events of 1971 and 1972:
The plaque on your office door identifies you as
a top University official, and the window on the
other side of your office has probably been broken
by a brick recently. The events of My Lai are not
long past, student protest is swelling to the point
where the wave may break at any time. A few
months ago, students and faculty at Yale Univer
sity staged a strike, shutting down the university.
Now students and professors at your own institu
tion are discussing a similar action. The police are
tense. So are you.
On your faculty you have a charismatic, radical
Marxist professor who has developed quite a fol
lowing among the students. This professor is in
volved in several revolutionary groups, and you
believe that he is whipping up the rebellious senti
ments of your student body.
This professor gives several speeches at various
rallies and demonstrations. Acts of violence fol
low. You believe this professor is responsible. You
fire him. You have been defending this action ever
since.
You are an associate professor of English, with a
personal philosophy leaning toward Maoism or
Marxism/Leninism. For most of your career, you

have protested against what you regard as im
perialism and recently you have actively protested
against the Vietnam War. As the war drags on in
search of "peace with honor," you are alarmed at
the increased repression on university campuses.
For these views, for your activity, for your effec
tiveness, you believe you have been blackballed
by certain circles who are determined to have you
ousted.
But you have tenure ... at a major American
university. A major American university you be
lieve is violating a ban on classified research by
running off a program plotting the amphibious
invasion of Indochina. This is the last straw. You
give a series of speeches urging students to take
action in support of their beliefs. The students later
take over the University's Computation Center
and hassle the police at a night-time rally. After a
six-week hearing by the school's Faculty Advisory
Board, you are fired. Thinking the firing unfair,
you take the case to the ACLU.
The passing of 10 years may cause some to ques
tion the urgency of resolving the Franklin case.
Today it is hard to glean the case's chronology
from the thousands of pages of testimony that have
been entered before various judicial bodies.
Yet despite constraints, the ultimate decision in
the Franklin case could have a profound effect on
the academic community. Does a private institu
tion have a right to dismiss a tenured professor?
Should a university be more tolerant of extreme
behavior than society as a whole? What is the
definition of incitement? To what extent should
national security concerns extend to academia?
Should the United States become involved in
another war, or subject to riot or to challenges to
free speech, the resolutions of these questions
would suddenly become crucial. Today, as tenure
becomes increasingly valued in a depressed
economy, the answers to these questions are cer
tainly relevant and deserve consideration.
