## Business views developing world 
### 
The key to arty successful U.S.
foreign economic-financial policy,
especially relating to developing nation
issues, lies in the factual and perceived
conviction at home and abroad that our
national economy is getting stronger —
not weaker. Financial markets and
policies will mirror our progress. This,
of course, poses a problero now that the
United States is in a recession. But many
developing nations have few options
for help and look to the United States
for encouragement and assistance.
It is clear that most developing na
tions will need, request and increas
ingly demand more financial and other
economic assistance from the United
States and many other nations. No one
can deny their problems, needs or polit
ical power. Nor can we deny the wide
spread concern across financial institu
tions about granting further credits to
most developing countries. The easy
answer is for U.S. business to become
more provincial — to say "no" just
when the opportunity to build allies,
trade and investment has opened up
dramatically in global recession.
What forceful position should U.S.
business leadership take on these fi
nancial issues? It is no longer pragmatic
to assume that the financial and other
problems of developing countries will
just ameliorate and disappear. More
action than words will be required. To
ignore these issues is to invite inevita
ble crises affecting the U.S. economy.
Since some positive measures are now
in order, business leaders in their own
interest as well as others should sup
port:
• Vigorous public and private efforts
to combat inflation and promote needed
recovery and economic growth in the
United States and across the world by
prompt stronger involvement. This
means to take a more active part in
recovery and inflation control policy
making; to offer more positive and
realistic suggestions for constraints on
government spending and managing
money growth; expand productivity —
enhancing investments, and help
through pro bono efforts to ease the
human adjustments in sectors ad
versely affected by anti-inflation
policies. Only by consistently moderat
ing inflation and providing more stabil
ity and incentives in markets can re
newed growth be assured. Only by new
sustained U.S. growth can trade with
the rest of the world increase. Only by
increased global trade can developing
countries hope to achieve their own
sustained economic and social ad
vancement.
• Increased financial resources for
official international lending organiza
tions may be unpopular in many quar
ters, but in economic terms it is essen
tial to provide the strength needed to
preserve the global financial system
through the current liquidity crisis.
This will also ease the energy and other
adjustment processes for resource poor
nations and offer more funds for infras
tructure and related development pro
jects. This means strong support for
fulfillment of U.S. commitment to a
large capital subscription for the World
Bank is in our own interest as well as
others. Here is a worthwhile trade-off
for some dollars programmed for de
fense with at least equal prospects that
they will help promote peace.

• Encouragement for closer working
and lending relationships between the
official international bodies and private
lenders, especially commercial banks is
needed. Developing countries gener
ally can only realize their economic and
social objectives by capitalizing on the
joint powers, resources and manage
ment skills of official a^4j? r ' va
m'ercial leaders. Neither c3h meet tfie
task ahead alone, but together with
some further guarantees much can be
accomplished. Risk delineation and ac
ceptance on a coordinated basis — re
flecting the distinct capabilities of dif
ferent types of lenders — can make
financial agreements for many de
veloping nations possible and prudent
when otherwise they would not be feas
ible in these uncertain times.
• More private investment in develop
ing nations can be encouraged by more
concerted and determined efforts and
programs to convince hosts that such
investments can and will be in the best
interests of all concerned. Obviously
private investors cannot be expected to
pursue greater investment programs
unless the overall business climate is
conducive to reasonable prospects for a
reasonable profit return.
Business leaders should oppose:
• Protectionist measures, especially
those which adversely impact develop
ing nations whose economies are highly
dependent on sales to the United States
and whose loyalties are linked closely
thereto.
• Pressures to expand the global
money supply excessively to divert

funds to developing countries because
the inevitable inflationary consequ
ences will be disruptive and aggravate
rather than alleviate financial difficul
ties of developing nations.
• Grandiose plans to organize a
global lender insurance system, at least
until the precise nature of the risks tot
be insured T are determined, funding,
methods are agreed upon, potential
sources and claims are projected, qual
ifications of participants are specified
and all necessary administrative, legal
and other conditions are negotiated. A
commission to investigate this proposal
would now seem appropriate.
Strong agreement is now needed on
quid pro quo terms to move forward on
a broad front to provide more practical
prudent financial and other assistance
to developing nations in ways which are
in the interest of the United States and
its business sector. Admittedly, it is dif
ficult to make decisions to support
more activities in developing countries
in the midst of national and global re
cession. Nevertheless, this is a time
when needs are the greatest, coopera
tion is more readily attained, long
range agreements are more negotiable
and rewards and good will for the fu
ture can be generated. Opportunity is
at hand for those who have the cour
age, skills and resources to grasp it.

• Pressures to expand the global
money supply excessively to divert

funds to developing countries because
the inevitable inflationary consequ

rather than alleviate financial difficul
ties of developing nations.

methods are agreed upon, potential

Strong agreement is now needed on
quid pro quo terms to move forward on
a broad front to provide more practical

to developing nations in ways which are
in the interest of the United States and
its business sector. Admittedly, it is dif
ficult to make decisions to support
more activities in developing countries
in the midst of national and global re
cession. Nevertheless, this is a time
when needs are the greatest, coopera
tion is more readily attained, long
range agreements are more negotiable
and rewards and good will for the fu
ture can be generated. Opportunity is
at hand for those who have the cour
age, skills and resources to grasp it.

The key to arty successful U.S.
foreign economic-financial policy,
especially relating to developing nation
issues, lies in the factual and perceived
conviction at home and abroad that our
national economy is getting stronger —
not weaker. Financial markets and
policies will mirror our progress. This,
of course, poses a problero now that the
United States is in a recession. But many
developing nations have few options
for help and look to the United States
for encouragement and assistance.
It is clear that most developing na
tions will need, request and increas
ingly demand more financial and other
economic assistance from the United
States and many other nations. No one
can deny their problems, needs or polit
ical power. Nor can we deny the wide
spread concern across financial institu
tions about granting further credits to
most developing countries. The easy
answer is for U.S. business to become
more provincial — to say "no" just
when the opportunity to build allies,
trade and investment has opened up
dramatically in global recession.
What forceful position should U.S.
business leadership take on these fi
nancial issues? It is no longer pragmatic
to assume that the financial and other
problems of developing countries will
just ameliorate and disappear. More
action than words will be required. To
ignore these issues is to invite inevita
ble crises affecting the U.S. economy.
Since some positive measures are now
in order, business leaders in their own
interest as well as others should sup
port:
• Vigorous public and private efforts
to combat inflation and promote needed
recovery and economic growth in the
United States and across the world by
prompt stronger involvement. This
means to take a more active part in
recovery and inflation control policy
making; to offer more positive and
realistic suggestions for constraints on
government spending and managing
money growth; expand productivity —
enhancing investments, and help
through pro bono efforts to ease the
human adjustments in sectors ad
versely affected by anti-inflation
policies. Only by consistently moderat
ing inflation and providing more stabil
ity and incentives in markets can re
newed growth be assured. Only by new
sustained U.S. growth can trade with
the rest of the world increase. Only by
increased global trade can developing
countries hope to achieve their own
sustained economic and social ad
vancement.
• Increased financial resources for
official international lending organiza
tions may be unpopular in many quar
ters, but in economic terms it is essen
tial to provide the strength needed to
preserve the global financial system
through the current liquidity crisis.
This will also ease the energy and other
adjustment processes for resource poor
nations and offer more funds for infras
tructure and related development pro
jects. This means strong support for
fulfillment of U.S. commitment to a
large capital subscription for the World
Bank is in our own interest as well as
others. Here is a worthwhile trade-off
for some dollars programmed for de
fense with at least equal prospects that
they will help promote peace.

• Encouragement for closer working
and lending relationships between the
official international bodies and private
lenders, especially commercial banks is
needed. Developing countries gener
ally can only realize their economic and
social objectives by capitalizing on the
joint powers, resources and manage
ment skills of official a^4j? r ' va
m'ercial leaders. Neither c3h meet tfie
task ahead alone, but together with
some further guarantees much can be
accomplished. Risk delineation and ac
ceptance on a coordinated basis — re
flecting the distinct capabilities of dif
ferent types of lenders — can make
financial agreements for many de
veloping nations possible and prudent
when otherwise they would not be feas
ible in these uncertain times.
• More private investment in develop
ing nations can be encouraged by more
concerted and determined efforts and
programs to convince hosts that such
investments can and will be in the best
interests of all concerned. Obviously
private investors cannot be expected to
pursue greater investment programs
unless the overall business climate is
conducive to reasonable prospects for a
reasonable profit return.
Business leaders should oppose:
• Protectionist measures, especially
those which adversely impact develop
ing nations whose economies are highly
dependent on sales to the United States
and whose loyalties are linked closely
thereto.
• Pressures to expand the global
money supply excessively to divert

funds to developing countries because
the inevitable inflationary consequ
ences will be disruptive and aggravate
rather than alleviate financial difficul
ties of developing nations.
