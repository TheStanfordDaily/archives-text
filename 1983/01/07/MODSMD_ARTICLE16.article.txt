## News media now neglect events in Iran 
### 
Some 18 months after the expulsion
of foreign journalists from Iran, the
Iranian government recently invited a
selected group of American and other
foreign journalists to visit the country.
The reporters went on what was essen
tially a state-run tour, visiting selected
parts of the Iran-Iraq war fronts, sec
tions of the notorious Evin prison and
interviewed a number of Iranian offi
cials. No direct contacts with the
people were allowed.

The people are portrayed as loyal to the regime
and supportive of the war in general. Even
though there are some references to social and
economic problems, peoples disillusionment
and opposition to the regime is reported as
limited to the rich and those in the middle class.

At a time of rapidly escalating inter
nal chaos and crises, this invitation is
widely viewed as primarily a prop
aganda tactic of the regime, paving the
way for obtaining much-needed
economic and military assistance as
v well as more favdrabie preasuaoveragc.--

ports have been at best confusing and
more often contradictory and even mis
leading. For instance in a series of arti
cles appearing in The New York Times
last week, the situation in Iran was de
scribed as "stable and improving."
According to these articles the
Khomeini regime has made solid

strides in the economic fields, record
ing a record $15 billion in foreign re
serves last month.
In addition the regime is described as
"victorious" in its war effort with Iraq.

"terrorists," very few mentions of the
unprecedented repression and viola
tions ofhuman rights in Iran are made.

It seemsthatfust tike the period before the fall of
the Shah, we are once again getting confused
and misleading news coverage on Iran.

In contrast, Financial Times of Lon
don writes olthe growing unpoplarity
and isolation of the Iranian regime and
the reign of fear that now rules in Iran.
It portrays the Khomeini regime as a

collection of corrupt clergy, faced with
dwindling grass root support and a dis
astrous economic condition (it puts the
regime's reserves at $4.5 billion!). The
Times takes note of an active internal
armed opposition and cites the re
gime'sextreme difficulties in recruiting
volunteers for the war with Iraq as a
proof of the lack of popular support for
the war and the regime. CBS in a spe
cial on Iran, called the situation in Iran
"extremely unstable," and said that the
regime's support was at an all time low.
It went on to compare the repression
and methods of control now practiced
in Iran to that of George Orwell's
1984. In this program the Iranian
economy was described as "practically
dead," and over 10,000 political execu
tions were cited as an example of the
type of repression now present in Iran.
It seems that just like the period be
fore the fall of the Shah, we are once
again getting confused and misleading
news coverage on Iran. Giving it the
benefit of the doubt, I would like to
think of this as confusion rather than
deliberate misrepresentation of the
facts. But given the very critical situa
tion in the Mideast, now more than

ever need thorough, in-depth and
objective cpverage of the events and
the situation in Iran.
