# Energy-efficient lights to be in by April
## 
### USA LYNCH Staff writer 
A money-saving plan devised by
the University Planning Office and
several engineering students will
have pedestrians seeing orange as
they walk the campus at night. The
replacement of many mercury
vapor campus lights with high
pressure sodium fixtures is
scheduled to begin early next week.
HPS fixtures use less electricity,
yet illuminate a larger area than
mercury-vapor fixtures and they
give off an orange-yellow glow in
stead of the blue-white light of mer
cury lamps.
"Some people may think we're
just changing the color of the
lights," said Facilities Engineer
John Lerry, "but what we're doing
is saving money." Because electric
ity will be conserved by the installa
tion of HPS lights, PG&E is giving
the University a rebate." It's sort of
a pat on the back for being more
efficient," Lerry said. "We expect
the project to pay for itself within
three years."
The HPS lights were first installed
on a trial basis over the summer,
replacing mercury fixtures on Roth
Way. When the lights were ap
proved by the University president,
vice-president and student groups, a
plan was devised for the replace
ment of existing mercury vapor fix
tures.
The project is slated for comple
tion in April. Street and pathway
lights on Campus Drive, all campus
parking lots and several Palm Drive
street lights will be converted. None
of the globe fixtures which light the
quad and inner campus will be
changed. "The yellow light in a
glove fixture is unattractive," Lerry
said.
The replacement project is sepa

rate from the recently released 1983
lighting plan and the 1982 plan
which should be completed later
tins month. The '83 plan has been
.approved by the University and was
â€¢just stressed by the ASSU; the
planning office has chosen six out of
18 possible new sites for lighting.
The sites, which are among the top
lOon the ASSU priority list, include
ihe Quad Courtyard, the Physics
Tank, Roble Gym, the Press Cour
tyard, Encina Courtyard, the Lake
Lagunita pathway and the Medical
Micro pathway at the Medical
Center.
The '83 budget for lighting is
$50,000, only one-quarter of the
lighting budget for 1982. The '82
project was one of the largest in
University history and provided ex
tensive new lighting in LeSwain
Mall, Escondido Village, Serra
Street, Wilbur, Roble and Lagunita
dormitories, the Cluster area and
sections behind Memorial Church.
Large-scale lighting installation
was first recommended in 1980 as
part of a 10-year, million dollar
lighting plan that Director of Plan
ning Phil Williams deemed "too
ambitious." However, as a response
to last year's concern over rapes and
rape attempts, the lighting plan was
reconsidered and a modified plan
was developed. Sites for new light
ing were chosen through the com
bined efforts of the Planning Office,
the ASSU, the Police Department
and the Stanford community.
Campus planner Max Mazenko
maintained that the campus would
still not be completely secure.
"We'll always have dark pockets,"
he said, explaining that it was actu
ally not a good idea to light the en
tire campus. "Lighting can some
times give a false sense of security.
We only want to light areas that can
be adequately patrolled by police."

A NEW LIGHT ON THE SUBJECT: New lights along Campus and
Palm Drives and in all parking lots will emit an orange glow. The new
energy-efficient lights are due to be installed by April.
