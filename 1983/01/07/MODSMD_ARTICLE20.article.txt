Stanford ckmc its closest after
an eight-point streak made it
41-40 with 11:42 remaining, the
streak culminating with a Dave
Nussbaum lay-in.
The Beavers countered with a
six-point run'of their own on two
Darrvl Flowers jump shots and a
Flowers assist to Steve Woods
ide.
Stanford also came to within
five and three point deficits,
sandwiched between Oregon
State scoring sprees, before the
Cardinal's final run.
Revelli shot nine-for-nine
from the floor and 10-of-l3 from
the free throw line and pulled
down a game-high ten rebounds.
With just nine points at halftime,
Revelli scored 14 straight Stan
ford points and 14 of the first 16
in the second half to keep the
Cardinal close. No other Stan
ford players scored in double fig

"We were beaten bv a reallv,
reallv nice team," said Stanford
coach Tom Davis. "Their record
speyks for itself. But I'm very
proud of our guvs. I couldn't
have asked for anv more in terms
. Oregon State ran off to a 12-1
lead, hitting six of its first eight
shots from the perimiter against a
tjmid Cardinal defense. But Stan
ford cut the Beavers momentum
with a tight match-up zone de
fense and frequent substitutions,
fighting back and putting togeth
er a six-point run to make the
score 14-9 with 11:50 remaining
in the first half.
"We became rattled at the be
ginning, but Oregon State has
done that to a lot of teams"
Davis said. "We're both tempo
teams, but we're nowhere in their
class. They mav be the best tem
po team in the nation. We aspire
to be that type of team."
The Beavers led 30-22 at half
time on the strength of 63 percent
shooting from the field, forward
Jamie Stangel leading the way
with seven-for-seven.
The Cardinal was able to re
main close by hitting 8-of-l 1 free
throws, while OSU did not get to
the line once in the opening peri
?d.
Oregon State, when it was able
to break it, scored primarily off a
stingy Stanford press, hitting
open 15-18 foot jump shots.
Stanford, conversely, scored
most of its points inside to nearly
match the Beavers 57 percent
shooting from the field for the
game.
The Cardinal never came out
of its ;zone even when Oregon
State pulled the ball out and ran
up to two minutes off the clock in
the first half.
"We had to," said Davis can
didly in referring to his zone.
"Look at the speed factor.
Throughout the first eight or nine
guys, we're hard pressed to find
one guy as quick as theirs."
Stanford also kept full-court
pressure on for the entire game,

causing I6 OSU turnovers.
"We did get fatigued," said
Davis. "We bothered them with
the press, hut never could quite
get over the hump. I don't know
if there is a finer passing team
anywhere State)."
Woodsidc and Stangel led
OSU scorers with 14 points each.
The Beavers had their 49th

straight sell-out at Gill Coliseum.
7 he Cardinal will now face Or
egon Saturday in Eugene. The
Ducks are led by seven-foot cen
ter Blair Rasmussen, who pro
vides a formidable match-up for
Kevelli in the middle. Captain
David Brantley leads the Ducks
outside game. The Ducks are 5-5
after an overtime victory over
Californial last night.
