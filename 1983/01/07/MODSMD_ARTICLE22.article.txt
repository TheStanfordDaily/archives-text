According to Swimming
World magazine, the Stanford
men's swimming team should
finish fourth in the nation. Head
coach Skip Kenney feels other
wise. He thinks that his squad,
which finished third in the coun<-
try last year, has the talent to rise'
to the top this season.
"Our number one asset is
team unity and team chemistry,"
Kenney said. "It is fantastic."
Kenney said the training over
the last week of Christmas vaca
tion contributes to this factor. k,
"We all have to live and eat
together," Kenney said. "It
helps everyone get to know each

other away from the pool." The
Cardinal has a very difficult
schedule ahead, including the
top three teams in the nation.
Kenney said the performance
of the diving team, whose scores
ate induded along with those of
the swim team, will be crucial,
especially in the close meets.
Stanford, travels to the
California Invitational Friday
and Saturday.
Kenney emphasized that the
calibter of athletes on the swim
teani is excellent. Stanford has
many. Olympic-level swimmers,
which is as high as one can go in
, athletics. Stanford
placed more swimmers on the
1980 U.S. Olympic team than
any other school.

The 1983 team includes na
tional champions and many
other top swimmers in the na
tion.
The list is headed by sopho
more Dave Bottom, who was the
highest point scorer for Stanford
in the NCAA Championships
last year. Bottom, also an
American record holder, is the
team leader.
John Simons, John Moffet and
Dave Sims, all world class
swimmers, were on the 1980
Olympic team and are national
champions. Other top swimmers
include John Engs, Todd Lin
coln, Charlie Johnson and John
Denney.
There is only one senior on the
team and, according to Kenney,

"there are a couple of guys in the
freshman class who have the po
tential to be outstanding."
Kenney said the major goal is
to have everyone swim faster
than they have before. The prog
ram is designed so that they con
tinue to improve through four
years. The coaches indicated that
if this occurs, winning will take
care of itself.
Kenney praised the team as
being "the greatest group of guys
I've been associated with." He
said they talk a lot about winning
and that they believe in them
selves.
Kenney also added that the
staff "shouldn't overcoach and
should just let the guys go out
and swim."


TROUBLED WATERS: Stanford's Todd Lincoln stretches it
out in a butterfly race earlier this year. Lincoln was a 1980

Rowland Burno/Daily
Olympian and one of the swimmers coach Skip Kenney is
counting on for the team's success this season.
