# Allen wins rookie-of-year
## 
### Associated Press 
Los Angeles — Marcus Allen
heard the talk, that he wouldn't
he as effective in the National
Football League as he was as a
collegian at Southern Cal.
It didn't bother him. Fact is, it
fired him up.
"I never had any doubts," said
the sensational rookie running
back this week. "If anything, I
think it gave me more incentive
to do well. I was confident. I
knew 1 could plav."
So did the Los Angeles Raid
ers, who selected him in the first
round of last spring's NFL draft
after he won the Heisman
Trophy as college football's out
standing performer in 1981.
Although a lot of so-called ex
perts didn't think so at the time,
that pick turned out to be a
stroke of genius.
Allen, only the third running
back (behind Atlanta's Gerald
Riggs and Minnesota's Darrin
Nelson) and 10th player taken
overall in the draft, was a unani
mous selection as The Associated
Press's outstanding offensive
rookie, it was announced yester
day.
Considering Allen was third in
the NFL's Most Valuable Player
voting and was the only first-year
performer to be named as an All-
Pro, his being picked as the too
rookie on offense was a foregone
conclusion.
"It's one of your personal

goals at the beginning of the
year," said Allen of his latest
award. "But quite frankly, I for
got all about personal goals. To
be honest, I just wanted to come
in and start, that was mv No. I
goal.
"I was more concerned with
helping the team win. Not to
belittle the award, of course, but
it's more important to have the
respect and admiration of vour
teammates.
"I've been getting a lot of the
credit, which most running backs
do. When you look at the job I've
done, a lot of credit should go to
the offensive line, the receivers
and the blocking backs."
Thanks in great part to Allen,
who many thought wouldn't be
fast enough to be a star in the
NFL, the Raiders posted an 8-1
record during this strike-inter
rupted season, best in the Ameri
can Football Conference.
Thev will have the home-field
advantage as long as they stay
alive in the playoffs. Their first
round game at the Los Angeles
Coliseum will be plaved this
tomorrow against the Cleveland
Browns, who were 4-5 during the
regular season.
Allen finished as the NFL's
leading scorer with 14 touch
downs for 84 points. He was the
first non-kicking rookie to lead
the league in scoring since Gale
Savers accomplished the feat
with 22 touchdowns in 1965.

Allen, a 6-foot-2, 210-pounder
who set an NCAA record bv
rushing for 2,342 vards at South
ern Cal in 1981, finished fourth in
the NFL in rushing this season
with 697 vards on 160 carries.
Hleven of his touchdowns came
on the ground. He also had 38 re
ceptions for 401 vards and three
Tl)s.
Had the season gone the nor
mal 16 games, he almost certainly
would have rushed for more than
1,000 yards and probablv would
have had over 60 receptions.
In addition, he might have had
an excellent shot of breaking the
NKL record of 23 touchdowns
scored, established bv O.J. Sim
pson in 1975.
"There is no question that God
blessed us bv giving us Marcus
Allen," said Coach Tom Flores
of the Raiders. "Marcus is best
described as a winner. He has
added to the quality of our team
and organization with his multi
tude of talents and unselfish at
titude."
"The season went by pretty
fast," said Allen, speaking by tel
ephone from Oakland, where the
Raiders are preparing to play the
Browns. "You don't have time to
sit back and think about any
thing.
"Our goal is to make it to the
Super Bowl. We have to take it
one game at a time. We play
Cleveland this week, they're a
tough opponent. That's what's
on mv mind right now."

that pick turned out to be a
stroke of genius.
Allen, only the third running
back (behind Atlanta's Gerald
Riggs and Minnesota's Darrin
Nelson) and 10th player taken
overall in the draft, was a unani
mous selection as The Associated
Press's outstanding offensive
rookie, it was announced yester
day.
Considering Allen was third in
the NFL's Most Valuable Player
voting and was the only first-year
performer to be named as an All-
Pro, his being picked as the too
rookie on offense was a foregone
conclusion.
"It's one of your personal

goals at the beginning of the
year," said Allen of his latest
award. "But quite frankly, I for
got all about personal goals. To
be honest, I just wanted to come
in and start, that was mv No. I
goal.
"I was more concerned with
helping the team win. Not to
belittle the award, of course, but
it's more important to have the
respect and admiration of vour
teammates.
"I've been getting a lot of the
credit, which most running backs
do. When you look at the job I've
done, a lot of credit should go to
the offensive line, the receivers
and the blocking backs."
Thanks in great part to Allen,
who many thought wouldn't be
fast enough to be a star in the
NFL, the Raiders posted an 8-1
record during this strike-inter
rupted season, best in the Ameri
can Football Conference.
Thev will have the home-field
advantage as long as they stay
alive in the playoffs. Their first
round game at the Los Angeles
Coliseum will be plaved this
tomorrow against the Cleveland
Browns, who were 4-5 during the
regular season.
Allen finished as the NFL's
leading scorer with 14 touch
downs for 84 points. He was the
first non-kicking rookie to lead
the league in scoring since Gale
Savers accomplished the feat
with 22 touchdowns in 1965.

Allen, a 6-foot-2, 210-pounder
who set an NCAA record bv
rushing for 2,342 vards at South
ern Cal in 1981, finished fourth in
the NFL in rushing this season
with 697 vards on 160 carries.
Hleven of his touchdowns came
on the ground. He also had 38 re
ceptions for 401 vards and three
Tl)s.
Had the season gone the nor
mal 16 games, he almost certainly
would have rushed for more than
1,000 yards and probablv would
have had over 60 receptions.
In addition, he might have had
an excellent shot of breaking the
NKL record of 23 touchdowns
scored, established bv O.J. Sim
pson in 1975.
"There is no question that God
blessed us bv giving us Marcus
Allen," said Coach Tom Flores
of the Raiders. "Marcus is best
described as a winner. He has
added to the quality of our team
and organization with his multi
tude of talents and unselfish at
titude."
"The season went by pretty
fast," said Allen, speaking by tel
ephone from Oakland, where the
Raiders are preparing to play the
Browns. "You don't have time to
sit back and think about any
thing.
"Our goal is to make it to the
Super Bowl. We have to take it
one game at a time. We play
Cleveland this week, they're a
tough opponent. That's what's
on mv mind right now."
