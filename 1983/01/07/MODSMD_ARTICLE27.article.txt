Chris Horpel is realistic and he
knows exactly what he wants
from his wrestling team.
"Our schedule is tough so I just
want to have a winning season
and, maybe, sneak into the top
three in the conference," Stan
ford coach Horpel said. "I think
we can qualifv three or four
wrestlers for nationals and, if
we're lucky, Bet8 e t an All-Ameri
ca."
But Horpel is realistic. He
knows getting an All-America
might be asking too much, "but 1
might change mv mind about
that in a couple of weeks."
The Cardinal upped its dual
mark record to 3-2 with a 19-16
win over Canadian national
champions Simon-Fraser of Brit
ish Columbia Wednesday.
But after a trip to Sacramento
State today, Stanford hosts the
Pacific-10's best team — Arizona
State — Monday night at Maples
Pavilion at 7 p.m.
"I'm pretty pleased with our
season," Hot'pel said, "but Mon
day night we plav the best in the
conference and we are going to
have our hands full."
Stanford has been led by co
captains Tom Mullenfand Doug
Perkins, who are leading can
didates for anv individual hon
ors. Heavyweight Ed Katz and
freshman Scott Wiggin have also
been key marks in the Cardinal
line-up.
"We also have a bunch of guys
who are in the same category,"
Horpel said. "Thev are all very
competitive, thev are just not as
consistent."
Within two weeks, the
Cardinal line-up will get a shot in
the arm when 177-pounder Jeff
Wilson, a transfer from the Uni
versity of Washington, is back af
ter nursing a broken wrist back to

health.
"This team has a good at
titude," Horpel said. "Even
when we lose, evervone is reac
ting to it well.
"ASIJ and Oregon State are
the best teams in the conference
and after that, it's up for grabs.
We'd like to get that third spot
and if we keep improving we
might challenge Oregon State."
Oregon State handed Stanford
only their second loss of the sea
son last quarter and Horpel ad
mitted, the Cardinal didn't look
very good.
But Horpel likes the way his
team has rebounded and said he
will really know how he feels af
ter Monday night's clash with the
Sun Devils.
