Weinberger to look for defense cuts
Washington — Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger, under pressure
from other senior administration officials, told President Reagan yesterday
that he will re-examine the Pentagon budget in search of possible cuts,
well-placed sources reported.
The Weinberger pledge came at a morning meeting at which several of
Reagan's advisers, including Office of Management and Budget Director
David Stockman and senior White House staff members, argued that the
president must find savings in his proposed five-year defense buildup if the
administration is to bring down what one official called "eye-popping"
deficits.
In a separate session yesterday — a hectic day in which the entire budget
seemed to be back up for grabs only three weeks before it must be sent to
Congress — House Minority Leader Robert Michel (R-III.), also told the
President that the administration must come up with some alternative to the
anti-recession jobs and housing legislation that Democrats are expected to
propose when Congress returns later this month.
An aide to Michel quoted him as telling Reagan: "Responding to the
Democrats by being naysayers is not an adequate response from Republi
cans to people who arc unemployed."
