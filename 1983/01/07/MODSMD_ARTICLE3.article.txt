Weinberger to look for defense cuts
Washington — Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger, under pressure
from other senior administration officials, told President Reagan yesterday
that he will re-examine the Pentagon budget in search of possible cuts,
well-placed sources reported.
The Weinberger pledge came at a morning meeting at which several of
Reagan's advisers, including Office of Management and Budget Director
David Stockman and senior White House staff members, argued that the
president must find savings in his proposed five-year defense buildup if the
administration is to bring down what one official called "eye-popping"
deficits.
In a separate session yesterday — a hectic day in which the entire budget
seemed to be back up for grabs only three weeks before it must be sent to
Congress — House Minority Leader Robert Michel (R-III.), also told the
President that the administration must come up with some alternative to the
anti-recession jobs and housing legislation that Democrats are expected to
propose when Congress returns later this month.
An aide to Michel quoted him as telling Reagan: "Responding to the
Democrats by being naysayers is not an adequate response from Republi
cans to people who arc unemployed."
And in a third session, the president was given a
description of possible initiatives to combat the un
employment rate, which was 10.8 percent last
month. A new rate will be announced Friday. Of
ficials were instructed to report to him after de
termining what the proposals would cost.
Reagan warns MX opponents
Washington — President Reagan has said in a
letter that if Congress does not approve his MX
missile there will have to be "a reassessment" of his
strategic arms reduction proposals made to the So
viet Union in Geneva.
The president laid out his views in a letter this
week to Rep. Jack Kemp, (R-N.Y.). Kemp had
earlier urged Reagan to consider suspending U.S.
participation in the strategic arms reduction talks
(START) and related negotiations over European
based missiles if Congress did not support both the
long-range MX missile and the shorter-range Per
shing 11 missile meant for deployment in Europe.
112 unds for both were curtailed in last year's lame
duck session.
Reagan in his response to Kemp emphasized
that his START proposals for deep reductions in
the long-range missile arsenals of both sides were
based on the "assumption" that the new MX mis
sile would actually be deployed.
Administration officials indicated yesterday
that this was meant as a warning to MX critics that
if they kill the missile they could also cause a "very
lengthy" reassessment of the U.S. position at the
Geneva talks and thereby delay the arms control
process, which many MX opponents support.
Kemp wrote the president as Congress last
month was rejecting administration requests for
$988 million to begin production of the MX. That
negative vote came largely because the lawmakers
lacked confidence in the administration's pro
posed "Dense Pack" basing plan for the missile.
Economy to recover slowly
Washington — In a far from rosy scenario, the
Reagan administration is predicting that the econ
omy will grow at the anemic rate of 1.4 percent this
year, the weakest recovery from a recession in the
post-World War II era, administration officials
said Thursday.
As a result, the nation's unemployment rate —
already at a postwar high of 10.8 percent — will re
main in double digits for the remainder of the year,
declining only to about 9 percent by the end of
1984. The inflation rate, meanwhile, is expected to
remain around 5 percent in 1983, about the same as
in 1982.
The forecast, prepared for the fiscal 1984 budget
to be sent to Congress Jan. 31, is more pessimistic
about economic growth than the majority of
private forecasts, which project a growth rate of
around 2 percent to 3 percent this year. But it is in
line with the wishes of some White House aides
that, after overly optimistic projections in the last
two years, the emphasis this time be on credibility.

"We won't have a credibility problem from this
forecast," said an administration official who
asked not to be identified. "The government —
and not just during this administration — has suf
fered too long because Reagan's budget and tax
policies to reduce federal deficits projected bv the
administration.
East bloc proposes treaty
Moscow — The Soviet Union and its East bloc
allies issued a lengthv declaration yesterday saying
that there is an urgent need to lessen mistrust be
tween East and West and calling on Western na
tions to sign a mutual non-aggression treaty.
In Washington, meanwhile, the State Depart
ment vesterdav repeated President Reagan's offer
at his Wednesday news conference to consider the
Warsaw Pact proposal "in consultation with our
allies." But at the same time, the of fer was dis
missed as nothing new.
Soviet Communist party chief Yuri Andropov
and the party leaders of the six other Warsaw Pact
nations signed the 5000-word political declaration
Wednesday at the conclusion of a two-day summit
meeting in Prague, Czechoslovakia.
The declaration, released in Moscow by the of
ficial Tass press agency, portraved the Soviet
Union's policies and those of its allies as purely
peaceful and blamed world tensions on the United
States and its allies.
Reciting most of the foreign policy and arms
control proposals that the Kremlin has offered in
recent years, the declaration maintained that the
Warsaw Pact has "no aggressive intentions"
against the North Atlantic treaty Organization
"or any other country."
Peace, it contended, is an intrinsic feature of
communism, while "anti-communism has always
been a component of the onslaught on the demo
cratic freedoms and rights of the people."
Gas prices to increase
Washington — In gloomy news for Americans
who heat their homes with natural gas, the Depart
ment of Energy (DOE) yesterday revised upward
the already steep price increases predicted for the
rest of the winter.
The forecast now envisions homeowners' bills
climbing by 25 percent in the first three months of
this year compared to the same period last year.
In its "Short-Term Energy Outlook," the de
partment predicted a price of $6.17 per thousand
cubic feet — 20 cents more than the projection
DOE made just three months ago.
Consumer groups said the department is finally
recognizing the reality that prices are rising much
faster than anyone had expected because of con
tract mistakes committed by many of the country's
interstate pipelines.
In the first three months of 1982, consumers paid
an average of $4.93 per thousand cubic feet. Since
then, many interstate pipelines have been caught
between slumping demand caused by the economic
recession and contract clauses that require them to

pay for a certain amount of gas whether they have a
market for it on not.
Bill ups gasoline tax 5 cents
Washington 4- President Reagan signed a bill
yesterday which boosts the gasoline tax by a nickel
to 9 cents per illon April I, promising motorists
and mass transit customers a smoother and safer
journey in retujn
The measurq. expected to raise more than $5
billion per vearlfor road repair and other transpor
tation needs, ia'an investment in tomorrow that
we must make today," said Reagan, and will end
"a period of decline" in surface travel.
The bill opeiv many major highways to bigger
and hcjvici truio In exchange, truckers will pay
sharply higher Ik and excise taxes.
Reagan, takiiK a seat at a table in the State Din
ing Room, signed the bill "before the bridges fall
down."
Under the la* .4 cents of the nickel increase will
be used to rep.nr and rebuild highways and
bridges. The fifth penny will go to mass transit pro
grams.
The new 9-cent rate will apply to gasoline and
diesel fuel. Gaiohol, which is exempt from the
present tax, will be taxed at 4-cents per
gallon.
Dole nominated for Cabinet post
Washington — President Reagan said Wednes
day night he is dominating Elizabeth Dole to suc
ceed Drew Lewjsas secretary of transportation.
"Welcome tq the Cabinet," the president said to
Dole, who accompanied him to a news conference.
She will be tiie first woman to head a Cabinet

sistant to the president for public liaison and a
former membertofthe Federal Trade Commission.
Lewis announced his resignation last month to
head Warner-Amex Cable Communications Inc.,
the nation's sixth largest cable television company.
Stock prices, trading surge
Stock prices soared to record highs yesterday in
the heaviest trading in two months amid what ana
lysts described as increasing confidence in the out
look for an economic recovery.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials jumped
26.03 to 1070.92, topping the previous closing high
of 1070.55 it reached on Dec. 27.

allies." But at the same time, the of fer was dis
missed as nothing new.
Soviet Communist party chief Yuri Andropov
and the party leaders of the six other Warsaw Pact
nations signed the 5000-word political declaration
Wednesday at the conclusion of a two-day summit
meeting in Prague, Czechoslovakia.
The declaration, released in Moscow by the of
ficial Tass press agency, portraved the Soviet
Union's policies and those of its allies as purely
peaceful and blamed world tensions on the United
States and its allies.
Reciting most of the foreign policy and arms
control proposals that the Kremlin has offered in
recent years, the declaration maintained that the
Warsaw Pact has "no aggressive intentions"
against the North Atlantic treaty Organization
"or any other country."
Peace, it contended, is an intrinsic feature of
communism, while "anti-communism has always
been a component of the onslaught on the demo

Gas prices to increase
Washington — In gloomy news for Americans
who heat their homes with natural gas, the Depart
ment of Energy (DOE) yesterday revised upward
the already steep price increases predicted for the
rest of the winter.
The forecast now envisions homeowners' bills
climbing by 25 percent in the first three months of
this year compared to the same period last year.
In its "Short-Term Energy Outlook," the de
partment predicted a price of $6.17 per thousand
cubic feet — 20 cents more than the projection
DOE made just three months ago.
Consumer groups said the department is finally
recognizing the reality that prices are rising much
faster than anyone had expected because of con
tract mistakes committed by many of the country's
interstate pipelines.
In the first three months of 1982, consumers paid
an average of $4.93 per thousand cubic feet. Since
then, many interstate pipelines have been caught
between slumping demand caused by the economic
recession and contract clauses that require them to

pay for a certain amount of gas whether they have a
market for it on not.

Weinberger to look for defense cuts
Washington — Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger, under pressure
from other senior administration officials, told President Reagan yesterday
that he will re-examine the Pentagon budget in search of possible cuts,
well-placed sources reported.
The Weinberger pledge came at a morning meeting at which several of
Reagan's advisers, including Office of Management and Budget Director
David Stockman and senior White House staff members, argued that the
president must find savings in his proposed five-year defense buildup if the
administration is to bring down what one official called "eye-popping"
deficits.
In a separate session yesterday — a hectic day in which the entire budget
seemed to be back up for grabs only three weeks before it must be sent to
Congress — House Minority Leader Robert Michel (R-III.), also told the
President that the administration must come up with some alternative to the
anti-recession jobs and housing legislation that Democrats are expected to
propose when Congress returns later this month.
An aide to Michel quoted him as telling Reagan: "Responding to the
Democrats by being naysayers is not an adequate response from Republi
cans to people who arc unemployed."
And in a third session, the president was given a
description of possible initiatives to combat the un
employment rate, which was 10.8 percent last
month. A new rate will be announced Friday. Of
ficials were instructed to report to him after de
termining what the proposals would cost.
Reagan warns MX opponents
Washington — President Reagan has said in a
letter that if Congress does not approve his MX
missile there will have to be "a reassessment" of his
strategic arms reduction proposals made to the So
viet Union in Geneva.
The president laid out his views in a letter this
week to Rep. Jack Kemp, (R-N.Y.). Kemp had
earlier urged Reagan to consider suspending U.S.
participation in the strategic arms reduction talks
(START) and related negotiations over European
based missiles if Congress did not support both the
long-range MX missile and the shorter-range Per
shing 11 missile meant for deployment in Europe.
112 unds for both were curtailed in last year's lame
duck session.
Reagan in his response to Kemp emphasized
that his START proposals for deep reductions in
the long-range missile arsenals of both sides were
based on the "assumption" that the new MX mis
sile would actually be deployed.
Administration officials indicated yesterday
that this was meant as a warning to MX critics that
if they kill the missile they could also cause a "very
lengthy" reassessment of the U.S. position at the
Geneva talks and thereby delay the arms control
process, which many MX opponents support.
Kemp wrote the president as Congress last
month was rejecting administration requests for
$988 million to begin production of the MX. That
negative vote came largely because the lawmakers
lacked confidence in the administration's pro
posed "Dense Pack" basing plan for the missile.
Economy to recover slowly
Washington — In a far from rosy scenario, the
Reagan administration is predicting that the econ
omy will grow at the anemic rate of 1.4 percent this
year, the weakest recovery from a recession in the
post-World War II era, administration officials
said Thursday.
As a result, the nation's unemployment rate —
already at a postwar high of 10.8 percent — will re
main in double digits for the remainder of the year,
declining only to about 9 percent by the end of
1984. The inflation rate, meanwhile, is expected to
remain around 5 percent in 1983, about the same as
in 1982.
The forecast, prepared for the fiscal 1984 budget
to be sent to Congress Jan. 31, is more pessimistic
about economic growth than the majority of
private forecasts, which project a growth rate of
around 2 percent to 3 percent this year. But it is in
line with the wishes of some White House aides
that, after overly optimistic projections in the last
two years, the emphasis this time be on credibility.

"We won't have a credibility problem from this
forecast," said an administration official who
asked not to be identified. "The government —
and not just during this administration — has suf
fered too long because Reagan's budget and tax
policies to reduce federal deficits projected bv the
administration.
East bloc proposes treaty

Washington — Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger, under pressure
from other senior administration officials, told President Reagan yesterday
that he will re-examine the Pentagon budget in search of possible cuts,
well-placed sources reported.
The Weinberger pledge came at a morning meeting at which several of
Reagan's advisers, including Office of Management and Budget Director
David Stockman and senior White House staff members, argued that the
president must find savings in his proposed five-year defense buildup if the
administration is to bring down what one official called "eye-popping"
deficits.
In a separate session yesterday — a hectic day in which the entire budget
seemed to be back up for grabs only three weeks before it must be sent to
Congress — House Minority Leader Robert Michel (R-III.), also told the
President that the administration must come up with some alternative to the
anti-recession jobs and housing legislation that Democrats are expected to
propose when Congress returns later this month.
An aide to Michel quoted him as telling Reagan: "Responding to the
Democrats by being naysayers is not an adequate response from Republi
cans to people who arc unemployed."
And in a third session, the president was given a
description of possible initiatives to combat the un
employment rate, which was 10.8 percent last
month. A new rate will be announced Friday. Of
ficials were instructed to report to him after de
termining what the proposals would cost.
Reagan warns MX opponents
Washington — President Reagan has said in a
letter that if Congress does not approve his MX
missile there will have to be "a reassessment" of his
strategic arms reduction proposals made to the So
viet Union in Geneva.
The president laid out his views in a letter this
week to Rep. Jack Kemp, (R-N.Y.). Kemp had
earlier urged Reagan to consider suspending U.S.
participation in the strategic arms reduction talks
(START) and related negotiations over European
based missiles if Congress did not support both the
long-range MX missile and the shorter-range Per
shing 11 missile meant for deployment in Europe.
112 unds for both were curtailed in last year's lame
duck session.
Reagan in his response to Kemp emphasized
that his START proposals for deep reductions in
the long-range missile arsenals of both sides were
based on the "assumption" that the new MX mis
sile would actually be deployed.
Administration officials indicated yesterday
that this was meant as a warning to MX critics that
if they kill the missile they could also cause a "very
lengthy" reassessment of the U.S. position at the
Geneva talks and thereby delay the arms control
process, which many MX opponents support.
Kemp wrote the president as Congress last
month was rejecting administration requests for
$988 million to begin production of the MX. That
negative vote came largely because the lawmakers
lacked confidence in the administration's pro
posed "Dense Pack" basing plan for the missile.
Economy to recover slowly
Washington — In a far from rosy scenario, the
Reagan administration is predicting that the econ
omy will grow at the anemic rate of 1.4 percent this
year, the weakest recovery from a recession in the
post-World War II era, administration officials
said Thursday.
As a result, the nation's unemployment rate —
already at a postwar high of 10.8 percent — will re
main in double digits for the remainder of the year,
declining only to about 9 percent by the end of
1984. The inflation rate, meanwhile, is expected to
remain around 5 percent in 1983, about the same as
in 1982.
The forecast, prepared for the fiscal 1984 budget
to be sent to Congress Jan. 31, is more pessimistic
about economic growth than the majority of
private forecasts, which project a growth rate of
around 2 percent to 3 percent this year. But it is in
line with the wishes of some White House aides
that, after overly optimistic projections in the last
two years, the emphasis this time be on credibility.

"We won't have a credibility problem from this
forecast," said an administration official who
asked not to be identified. "The government —
and not just during this administration — has suf
fered too long because Reagan's budget and tax
policies to reduce federal deficits projected bv the
administration.
East bloc proposes treaty
Moscow — The Soviet Union and its East bloc
allies issued a lengthv declaration yesterday saying
that there is an urgent need to lessen mistrust be
tween East and West and calling on Western na
tions to sign a mutual non-aggression treaty.
In Washington, meanwhile, the State Depart
ment vesterdav repeated President Reagan's offer
at his Wednesday news conference to consider the
Warsaw Pact proposal "in consultation with our
allies." But at the same time, the of fer was dis
missed as nothing new.
Soviet Communist party chief Yuri Andropov
and the party leaders of the six other Warsaw Pact
nations signed the 5000-word political declaration
Wednesday at the conclusion of a two-day summit
meeting in Prague, Czechoslovakia.
The declaration, released in Moscow by the of
ficial Tass press agency, portraved the Soviet
Union's policies and those of its allies as purely
peaceful and blamed world tensions on the United
States and its allies.
Reciting most of the foreign policy and arms
control proposals that the Kremlin has offered in
recent years, the declaration maintained that the
Warsaw Pact has "no aggressive intentions"
against the North Atlantic treaty Organization
"or any other country."
Peace, it contended, is an intrinsic feature of
communism, while "anti-communism has always
been a component of the onslaught on the demo
cratic freedoms and rights of the people."
Gas prices to increase
Washington — In gloomy news for Americans
who heat their homes with natural gas, the Depart
ment of Energy (DOE) yesterday revised upward
the already steep price increases predicted for the
rest of the winter.
The forecast now envisions homeowners' bills
climbing by 25 percent in the first three months of
this year compared to the same period last year.
In its "Short-Term Energy Outlook," the de
partment predicted a price of $6.17 per thousand
cubic feet — 20 cents more than the projection
DOE made just three months ago.
Consumer groups said the department is finally
recognizing the reality that prices are rising much
faster than anyone had expected because of con
tract mistakes committed by many of the country's
interstate pipelines.
In the first three months of 1982, consumers paid
an average of $4.93 per thousand cubic feet. Since
then, many interstate pipelines have been caught
between slumping demand caused by the economic
recession and contract clauses that require them to

pay for a certain amount of gas whether they have a
market for it on not.
