"My story ends here like a

Jean-Luc Godard's film, "at a su
perb moment, when everything's

lyrical movie is a rhapsody on
cheap gangster melodramas: the
trio of protagonists (Claude

Karina) fantasize committing a
robbery in the style of cheap de
tective fiction and then,
astonishingly, carry it out. The
confusion of style and action is
characteristically Godardian, but
it has never been so richly worked
out — not even in his landmark
film Breathless. Godard wrote his
own script, based on Dolores
Hitchens' Fool's Gold, and he
speaks the narration, which is

The Philadelphia Story (1940)
Kresge Auditorium ★
The quintessential Hollywood
studio entertainment. Philip
Barrv wrote this sparkling high
comedy in 1939; Katharine Hep
burn, who had been declared box
office poison after a series of mov
ie flops, left for Broadway to play
the role of Tracv Lord, the rich
girl with an intolerance for
weakness, and the film version,
the following year, marked her
triumphant return. Donald
Ogden Stewart adapted the play,
George Cukor directed it, and
Hepburn's co-stars were Cary
(irant and Jimmy Stewart, whose
portrayal of the love-struck re
porter Macaulav Connor won
him an Oscar. These three give the
definitive performances of their
roles; Barry's lines are so marked
with their readings that the play
has never succeeded in revival,
and a musical film version. High
Society, in 1956 (with Grace Kel
ly, Bing Crosby and Frank
Sinatra), is cut-rate and crass.
With Ruth Hussev, Roland
Young, John Hallidav, Mary

Howard and Henry Daniell; shot
(in glistening black and white) by
Joseph Ruttenberg, and designed
bv Cedric Gibbons.
Plays this evening.

Broken Blossoms (1919) ★
Kresge Auditorium
D.W. Griffith's film is so
astonishingly delicate that it
seems to have been made in a sin
gle breath. Lillian Gish plays the
brutalized daughter of a boxer
(Donald Crisp), whose fragile
beauty attracts the admiration of
a tender Chinese (Richard
Barthelmess) who, like her, lives
in abject poverty in London's
"Limehouse" district. Though it
is possible to trace the German
Expressionist school of filmmak
ing from this picture, the ironies
fall gently and the theme —: the
struggle between innocence and
brute force — and the tone are
Dickensian. Gish and
Barthelmess give exquisite per
formances; one of her scenes — in
which Crisp has locked her in a
closet — may be the purest ex
pression of teror in the history of
movies. Griffith adapted Thomas
Burke's novel The Chink and the
Child, and Billv Bitzer photo
graphed. If I compiled a list of my
favorite movies of all time, this

Peter Lorre was a distinguished
German stage actor when he
made this early sound film for

starred in the original production
of Odon von Horvath's Tales

extraordinary here that one wants
to crv out against the injustices
perpetrated against him in Holly

to make the child murderer hero
of M simultaneously sympathetic

Star Trek II: The Wrath of
Khan ★
Memorial Auditorium
Nicholas Mever directed this
witty, spirited adventure film, a
sequel to an episode of the Star
Trek TV show. It features
Ricardo Montalban as Khan, a
criminal exiled by Captain Kirk
(William Shalner) to a planet that
has since deteriorated; the script
by Harve Bennett and Jack
Sowards chronicles his attempt to
exact revenge. Though there is no
real beauty in the movie, it is full
of resonant plot ideas, it moves at
an exciting clip, and Mever works
wonders with some of the actors
(especially Shatner). Ricardo
Montalban, looking like a cross
between a pirate and a middle

of Khan with all the flourish of a

Strike! (1924) ★
Kresge Auditorium
Sergei Eisenstein's first feature
is a great political cartoon of a
movie. Though film historians
have tended to neglect it in favor
of the more influential Potemkin,
it is a truly amazing first work —
full of visual audacity — and
more impassioned than anything
else Fisenstein ever did. The most
exciting sequences are also the
most frightening: the passages
that show the cruelty of soldiers
to the striking workers still have
enough revolutionary fervor to
arouse the indignation of an au

"Limehouse" district. Though it
is possible to trace the German
Expressionist school of filmmak
ing from this picture, the ironies
fall gently and the theme —: the
struggle between innocence and
brute force — and the tone are
Dickensian. Gish and
Barthelmess give exquisite per
formances; one of her scenes — in
which Crisp has locked her in a
closet — may be the purest ex
pression of teror in the history of
movies. Griffith adapted Thomas
Burke's novel The Chink and the
Child, and Billv Bitzer photo
graphed. If I compiled a list of my
favorite movies of all time, this
would be at the top.

M (1931) *
Haus Mitteleuropa
Peter Lorre was a distinguished
German stage actor when he
made this early sound film for
Fritz Lang. (The same year, he
starred in the original production
of Odon von Horvath's Tales
from the Vienna Woods.) He is so
extraordinary here that one wants
to crv out against the injustices
perpetrated against him in Holly
wood, where he was typed as a
horror movie creep. He manages
to make the child murderer hero
of M simultaneously sympathetic
and repellent (as Bruce Davison
would do in his portrayal of the
child molester in Short Eyes 46
years later). M, a classic of the
German Expressionist school, is
often thought of as Lang's finest
achievement.
Plays Thursday evening.

Star Trek II: The Wrath of
Khan ★
Memorial Auditorium
Nicholas Mever directed this
witty, spirited adventure film, a
sequel to an episode of the Star
Trek TV show. It features
Ricardo Montalban as Khan, a
criminal exiled by Captain Kirk
(William Shalner) to a planet that
has since deteriorated; the script
by Harve Bennett and Jack
Sowards chronicles his attempt to
exact revenge. Though there is no
real beauty in the movie, it is full
of resonant plot ideas, it moves at
an exciting clip, and Mever works
wonders with some of the actors
(especially Shatner). Ricardo
Montalban, looking like a cross
between a pirate and a middle
aged hippie, approaches the role
of Khan with all the flourish of a
glorious Shakespearean ham —
and steals the picture.
Plays Sunday.

The Conversation (1974) ★
Bishop Auditorium
(iene Hackman is stunning in
Francis Ford Coppola's modern
horror storv about a professional
surveillance man, obsessed with
his own privacy, who has lost the
sense of his job. Coppola (who
also wrote the script) chose a

clean, elegant visual stvle, and the
film moves as smoothly as finely
tuned machinery; the composi
tions are snug, clear, logical,
serene — and unspeakably dis
quieting, like Magritte's paint
ings. A great small-scale film.
With John Cazale, Allen Gar
field, Frederic Forrest, Cindy
Williams and Robert Duvall. Bill
Butler (who photographed) and
David Shire(who wrote the score)
perform on Coppola's level. I

Strike! (1924) ★
Kresge Auditorium
Sergei Eisenstein's first feature
is a great political cartoon of a
movie. Though film historians
have tended to neglect it in favor
of the more influential Potemkin,
it is a truly amazing first work —
full of visual audacity — and
more impassioned than anything
else Fisenstein ever did. The most
exciting sequences are also the
most frightening: the passages
that show the cruelty of soldiers
to the striking workers still have
enough revolutionary fervor to
arouse the indignation of an au
dience.
Plays Monday evening with
Broken Blossoms.

Lady Sings the Blues (1972)
Terman Auditorium
This glossy, trashv musical bio,
adroitly directed bv Sidney J.
Furie, is in the Helen Morgan
Story — I'll Cry Tomorrow —
Funny Girl mode of show biz
heartbreak soap opera. Though
it's highlv entertaining, and
Diana Ross (in her movie debut)
gives a canny, convincing per
formance, you may cringe if vou
care at all about the real storv of
jazz singer Billie Holiday, whose
morphine addiction probably
didn't begin because she was lone
ly for handsome, patient Billy
Dee Williams on the road and
who probably didn't discover her
racial identity bv chance one day
when she came across the corpse
of a lynched black man in a south
ern town. Ross sings beautifully,
but her decision to sound as much
like Holiday as possible was an
unwise one, because she can't
compete. (Who could?) She
would have been better off de
veloping her own distinctive vocal
style, like Cagnev did as George
M. Cohan or Streisand as Fanny
Brice. With Richad Prvor.
Plays tomorrow evening.

Annie Hall( 1977j *
Bishop Auditorium
Woody Allen's last good mov
ie. This Oscar-winner lacks the
wild inventiveness of his earlier
comedies, hut it is warmlv funnv
and beautifully made. (Ciordon
Willis shot it.) Not quite ev
erything it is reputed to be, Annie
Hall is nonetheless a focal movie
for many filmgoers between 25
and 35: it seems to locate the
source of much of the anxiety of
that generation. Diane Keaton
gives a memorable performance
as Annie, and the cast is filled
with other interesting people, too
— Colleen Dewhurst, Shellev
Duvall, Janet Margolin, Carol
Kane, Paul Simon, Christopher
Walken, Tony Roberts and Jeff
Goldblum. Allen co-authored the
screenplay with Marshall
Brickman.
Plays this evening.
