# AT&T break-up inconveniences students

Students who have been trying to get new phone
service this quarter are already feeling after-shocks of
the AT&T break-up which will eventually affect
telephone service for consumers across the nation.
"The most immediate change is in the location of
equipment centers," said Pacific Telephone rep
resentative Jim Monroe.
At the beginning of the year many Pacific Tele
phone phone center stores including the one in Palo
Alto became the property of American Bell, a new
subsidiary of AT&T formed for the purpose of selling
rather than leasing telephone equipment.
Chris Wall, a student who recently moved into the
trailers, says that the phone she and her roommates
wanted would have cost them $79. Instead of paying
that high price she went up to a Pacific Telephone
service center in Redwood City where it is still possi
ble to rent phones. According to Wall, people in the
trailers who don't have cars are finding this to be very
inconvenient. "One guy said he didn't even think he
was going to get a phone this quarter," Wall said.
In addition, it is uncertain whether Pacific Tele
phone will still send trailers to campus in the fall to

sell phones to students. Monroe said, "As far as I
know, with all the changes in the way the business is
operating, the final decision has not yet been made."
Though Pacific Telephone is still offering its cus
tomers the option of leasing instead of buying
phones, this will end once the current stock of phones
runs out. According to Monroe, the average phone
costs about $35 and lasts about seven years, though
the price is less if one buys the phone currently being
leased.
By owning their own phones, customers "will save
on rental and be protected from rental increases,"
according to a spokesman for Pacific Telephone.
Monroe said, however, that any savings incurred
by owning a phone may be lost because "local rates
will probably go up."
Within the next year Pacific Telephone will be
come a separate company from AT&T as required by
an anti-trust settlement between AT&T and the U.S.
Justice Department. When this break takes effect.
Pacific Telephone will begin servicing only local calls
while AT&T continues to service long distance lines.
The loss of revenue from long distance calls will force

Pacific Telephone to raise its rates.
On the other hand, long distance rates will most
probably go down because of increased competition
from companies such as MCI and Sprint.
Despite these changes Monroe says that "in gen
eral service won't be affected at all."
Large businesses and universities should be able to
take advantage of the AT&T break-up by shopping
around for service to their phone systems. Stanford is
taking advantage of this in setting up its new tele
communications system.
"The effect that the AT&T break-up will have on
the new phone system is yet to be determined,"
explained Dave Sutter, project director of the new
telecommunication system. However, he also says
that "the Bell System, AT&T and Western Electric
will all be competing for a contract to service the
University so that service may be less expensive."
The University's new telecommunications system
is not going toinclude telephone service for students.
So for now, at least, students are going to have to put
up with the inconveniences that the AT&T break-up
has caused.
