# Budget for '83-'84 may involve faculty reduction
## 
### KATHY CHRISTIE Staff writer 
More "rigorous initiatives," which
could include a "last ditch" cut in the
number of faculty, will be needed to
balance the University's 1984-1985
budget. Provost A 1 Hastorf announced
at yesterday's Faculty Senate meeting.
"Three key variables are still being
reviewed: tuition, indirect cost recov
ery and salaries, both faculty and
staff," Hastorf said.
He emphasized that although tuition
is a variable, hikes should become less
rigorous. "We've been driving tuition
too hard and too fast and we've got to
slow it down," he said. "We shall be
examining the consequences of a sub
stantially lower rate of increase than
the 12 percent assumed in the long
range forecast, hoping that ways can be
found to reduce that rate of increase."
When asked why it was so important
that this be so, Hastorf replied,"l think
there's one hell of a big depression out
there."
"Our largest single expense item is
salaries," continued Hastorf. "We
have been taking a hard look at
whether we can maintain the 7 to
8 percent base increase projected
in the long-range forecast. It is now
clear to me that we cannot maintain
that rate of increase." He added, "The
hardest look is being taken at adminis
trative and other expenses in the non
academic areas. As was true in previ
ous episodes of budget-cutting, we ex
pect proportionately heavier reduc
tions to be made in these areas."
Because of a "commitment on our
part of crucial importance to the re
search enterprise at Stanford and to the
support of our federally funded inves
tigators," Hastorf said that "barring
powerful contrary arguments we ex
pect to recommend to the trustees that
we hold the Indirect Cost rate at its
present 69 percent for 1983-1984."
Hastorf also noted, "We aregoing to
need to look at the overall size of the
University in relation to its sustainable
support." Hastorf explained that this
means that "we may not be able to have

as large a faculty." but he called this a
"last ditch" solution. Although increas
ing the student population would bring
with it more tuition money, Hastorf
said that this is only being done in some
graduate areas, as the University wants
to maintain the quality of the student
body. He said that now the emphasis is
to "increase the ambience for the un
dergraduates."
The Annual Report of the Academic
Council Committee on Computers and
Information Technology was also pre
sented at the meeting. Instead of being
viewed as a "necessary evil," the com
mittee recommended that "Stanford
should view instructional computing as
a central (although not necessarily a
critical) University activity."
The report also'recommended that
the University "develop a long-range
capacity plan envisioning regular addi
tions to capacity over ti me in support of
instructional computing," instead of
reacting to needs after they occur. The
report suggested that departments
should also be able to allocate Provost
Computing Funds to selected instruc
tional activities and that "Stanford
should view Context (a sophisticated
text editing system) as two possibly
three separate and distinct projects
supporting separate University func
tions of noticeably different relative
importance."
In regard to the Superbowl being
held in Stanford Stadium in 1985, Pres
ident Kennedy said that, "Once you
add up the capital expenditures ... my
best estimate is that it is going to be a
wash transaction." He said that there
will be "some diversion of administra
tive staff time and perhaps some com
mitment of University resources a little
earlier than we might have chosen to
commit them otherwise. On the plus
side, there should be favorable atten
tions to the University's facilities and
its friendliness, and for our athletic
programs. And in my judgment, dwarf
ing all of these, there is an opportunity
to do something for our friends and
neighbors, as opposed to being cast in
the role of dog-in-the-manger."
