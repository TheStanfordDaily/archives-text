# University investigates Delts' drinking incident
## 
### BOB COHN Staff writer 
The University is awaiting reports
from the Delta Tau Delta fraternity
and the Inter-Fraternity Council (IFC)
in response to a post-initiation drinking
spree which resulted in three pledges
being rushed to Stanford Medical
Center Dec. 5, according to James
Cadena, assistant director of the row.
The three pledges, taken to the hos
pital by otherfraternity members, were
released the same evening. Two were
examined briefly while the third was
held and studied for several hours.
"He had drunk so much," said IFC
President Andy Beal, "that they were
concerned he would stop breathing."
University and fraternity representa
tives met yesterday to discuss the inci
dent and its effect on the Delts and the
IFC. A decision concerning the extent
of punitive action taken by the Univer
sity against the fraternity, if any, will
probably be reached by the end of this
month.
According to James Lyons, dean of
student affairs, University officials are
not treating this incident as a normaf
hazing case. He said that in hazing
cases involving physical injury it is usu
ally "highly likely" that the fraternity
would be suspended or have their char
ter revoked pending investigation. This

action has not been taken.
''The final response of the University
is to be contingent on how the house
responds," said Cadena, whoisalso the
fraternity adviser. In addition, Beal
said that the IFC is "working on an IFC
policy on alcohol-related abuse, relat
ing specifically to pledge and initiation
ceremonies."
Delt officials and the house resident
assistant last night refused to release
the names of the pledges. Cadena yes
terday said he did not remember the
names of those injured.
The pledges were participating in
"an activity which they (the Delts)
commonly do after initiation. They go
out to some fields with some bottles of
booze and some beer. It's not forced,
but it is a tradition," Beal said.
"They held an event they tradition
ally hold after initiation and usually a
lot of drinking takes place," Cadena
explained. "The officers (of the frater
nity) noticed that these three pledges
were looking a little green around the
gills and had the presence of mind to
get them to the hospital."
"The incident," Cadena continued,
"is a violation of the state hazing code
and the University policy on hazing."
