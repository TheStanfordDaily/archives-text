# University investigates Delts' drinking incident
## 
### BOB COHN Staff writer 
The University is awaiting reports
from the Delta Tau Delta fraternity
and the Inter-Fraternity Council (IFC)
in response to a post-initiation drinking
spree which resulted in three pledges
being rushed to Stanford Medical
Center Dec. 5, according to James
Cadena, assistant director of the row.
The three pledges, taken to the hos
pital by otherfraternity members, were
released the same evening. Two were
examined briefly while the third was
held and studied for several hours.
"He had drunk so much," said IFC
President Andy Beal, "that they were
concerned he would stop breathing."
University and fraternity representa
tives met yesterday to discuss the inci
dent and its effect on the Delts and the
IFC. A decision concerning the extent
of punitive action taken by the Univer
sity against the fraternity, if any, will
probably be reached by the end of this
month.
According to James Lyons, dean of
student affairs, University officials are
not treating this incident as a normaf
hazing case. He said that in hazing
cases involving physical injury it is usu
ally "highly likely" that the fraternity
would be suspended or have their char
ter revoked pending investigation. This

action has not been taken.
''The final response of the University
is to be contingent on how the house
responds," said Cadena, whoisalso the
fraternity adviser. In addition, Beal
said that the IFC is "working on an IFC
policy on alcohol-related abuse, relat
ing specifically to pledge and initiation
ceremonies."
Delt officials and the house resident
assistant last night refused to release
the names of the pledges. Cadena yes
terday said he did not remember the
names of those injured.
The pledges were participating in
"an activity which they (the Delts)
commonly do after initiation. They go
out to some fields with some bottles of
booze and some beer. It's not forced,
but it is a tradition," Beal said.
"They held an event they tradition
ally hold after initiation and usually a
lot of drinking takes place," Cadena
explained. "The officers (of the frater
nity) noticed that these three pledges
were looking a little green around the
gills and had the presence of mind to
get them to the hospital."
"The incident," Cadena continued,
"is a violation of the state hazing code
and the University policy on hazing."
Section 32050 of the Education
Code of the State of California reads:
" 'Hazing' includes any method of in
itiation or preinitiation into a student
organization or any pastime or amuse
ment engaged in with respect to such an
organization which causes, or is likely
to cause, bodily danger, physical harm,
or personal degradation or disgrace re
sulting in physical or mental harm."
"Almost anything anybody does
could be called a haze in some respect.
That word is so ambiguous," Beal
commented. He added that the pledges
were not coerced into consuming al
cohol at this event, although "there was
plenty of booze there."
Both Beal and Cadena agreed that
much of the information vital to this
case is still being uncovered. "All of
this stuff is still in the very early
stages," Cadena said.
Beal and Cadena said they are hope
ful that the University's final reaction
to the incident will be fair but lenient.
"The house seems to understand the
enormity and severity of the problem,"
Cadena said. "They're working on a
significant program to educate and
alert people to potential problems that
can occur."
Both agree that the major concern of
University officials is that such be
havior does not reoccur. Beal claims
that the chief worry of Dean of Resi
dential Education Norm Robinson —

the ultimate arbiter of this case — is
that fraternities will soon forget this
incident.
Thus both the Delts and the LFC are
currently exploring options to educate
fraternities and the Stanford commun
ity on the dangers of alcohol abuse. The
Delts have asked a representative from
Cowell Student Health Center to speak
at their house. They have also invited a
spokesman frorf) the Committee to
Halt Unnecessary College Killings
(CHUCK) to give a seminar on campus
in March.
Beal, as head of the IFC, is establish
ing a program in conjunction with the
row office on the potential for frater
nity problems. Topics to be included in
the proposed one- to two-hour presen
tation are the rights of pledges, hazing
policies, and the potential for alcohol
abuse. They also plan to set up a "haz
ing hotline" — a number fraternity
pledges can call to speak with IFC
membersif theyfeel they are the victim
of abuse.
The IFC also plans to instill a specific
program aimed at Delt pledges both
this year and in future years. "I think
the Delts were irresponsible to the ex
tent that they let these guys get as bad
as they did," Beal said. "But they were
responsible because they saw to their
safety after the incident occurred."
The Delta Tau Delta fraternity was
suspended in 1976 for intruding and
vandalizing the Beta Theta Pi and
Delta Upsilon houses.
