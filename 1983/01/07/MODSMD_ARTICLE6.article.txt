# ASSU to begin new assessment system
## 
### STEVE TROUSDALE Staff writer 
A series of changes in the ASSU fee assessment
process, including a stipulation that onh students
whovote in an ASSU fee assessment election will be
able to obtain refunds, are scheduled nexi fall. The
changes hinge on ASSU Senate approval of a report
written by a special subcommittee formed to draw
up guidelines for the fee assessment reform
amendment that was passed by l ist spring.
The process by which student group> obtain fee
assessments, which represent approximately
$10,000 for each quarter's assessment and which
often make up a substantial portion of i student
group's budget, will undergo substantial alterations.
The new system will also permit student groups to
request a fee in any amount above $400 U.
Under the new system there will be two different
kinds of fee assessments. One will be the association
fee and the other is the special fee. The association
fee will fund various ASSU boards, sUsh as the
Program Board, the Publications Board. and the
Academic Organizations Board. These hoards allo
cate money to student organizations that often are
not large enough to justify having their own fee

assessment.
However, if a group funded by one of these
boards receives more than $5000 in a single year or
$ 12,000 in three years (the new system provides for
indexing of these figures to reflect inflation), it will
be directed to apply for a special fee. This, in turn,
will be obtainable if the group can secure petition
signatures of at least 10 percent of the student body
and senate approval, or signatures from 20 percent
of the student body, in order to appear on the fee
assessment ballot.
To gain funding for next year, these groups will
apply to the various allocations boards for funds
early this quarter. Each board will draw up a budget
allocating money to the various student groups that
applied toit, using the funding requests as a guide to
this process. The senate will then ratify these
budgets; no voter approval is required for the as
sociation fee assessments.
The special fee assessment will have a minimum
request of $4000 for a fiscal year and will operate
much like present fee assessments except that
groups can request any amount of fees above the
$4000 minimum.
Another difference between this new system and

the old one is that there are no more one or two
quarter fee assessments; instead, groups will receive
the same amount of money each quarter.
Unlike association fees, voter approval will be
required for these special fee assessments.
Once special fees and the association fee have
been approved, the financial office of the ASSU will
draw up a schedule determining the quarter in
which various student groups fees will be collected,
and how much will be collected for each group. This
schedule will attempt to even out the amount of
money collected each quarter.
Thus, if one organization requests $10,000 and
another requests $8000, the ASSU financial office
may decide to collect 50 cents from each student in
fall, winter and spring quarters, with no money col
lected in summer quarter. Assuming that there are
12,000 registered students in each of these three
quarters, this will represent $6000 revenue in each
quarter for a total of $18,000 for the whole year.
Refunds will vary from the way they arc presently
done. The amount collected for a student group in a
quarter will be the amount available to students
from refunds. Because the amount collected for a
