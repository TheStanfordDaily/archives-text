# ASSU to begin new assessment system
## 
### STEVE TROUSDALE Staff writer 
A series of changes in the ASSU fee assessment
process, including a stipulation that onh students
whovote in an ASSU fee assessment election will be
able to obtain refunds, are scheduled nexi fall. The
changes hinge on ASSU Senate approval of a report
written by a special subcommittee formed to draw
up guidelines for the fee assessment reform
amendment that was passed by l ist spring.
The process by which student group> obtain fee
assessments, which represent approximately
$10,000 for each quarter's assessment and which
often make up a substantial portion of i student
group's budget, will undergo substantial alterations.
The new system will also permit student groups to
request a fee in any amount above $400 U.
Under the new system there will be two different
kinds of fee assessments. One will be the association
fee and the other is the special fee. The association
fee will fund various ASSU boards, sUsh as the
Program Board, the Publications Board. and the
Academic Organizations Board. These hoards allo
cate money to student organizations that often are
not large enough to justify having their own fee

assessment.
However, if a group funded by one of these
boards receives more than $5000 in a single year or
$ 12,000 in three years (the new system provides for
indexing of these figures to reflect inflation), it will
be directed to apply for a special fee. This, in turn,
will be obtainable if the group can secure petition
signatures of at least 10 percent of the student body
and senate approval, or signatures from 20 percent
of the student body, in order to appear on the fee
assessment ballot.
To gain funding for next year, these groups will
apply to the various allocations boards for funds
early this quarter. Each board will draw up a budget
allocating money to the various student groups that
applied toit, using the funding requests as a guide to
this process. The senate will then ratify these
budgets; no voter approval is required for the as
sociation fee assessments.
The special fee assessment will have a minimum
request of $4000 for a fiscal year and will operate
much like present fee assessments except that
groups can request any amount of fees above the
$4000 minimum.
Another difference between this new system and

the old one is that there are no more one or two
quarter fee assessments; instead, groups will receive
the same amount of money each quarter.
Unlike association fees, voter approval will be
required for these special fee assessments.
Once special fees and the association fee have
been approved, the financial office of the ASSU will
draw up a schedule determining the quarter in
which various student groups fees will be collected,
and how much will be collected for each group. This
schedule will attempt to even out the amount of
money collected each quarter.
Thus, if one organization requests $10,000 and
another requests $8000, the ASSU financial office
may decide to collect 50 cents from each student in
fall, winter and spring quarters, with no money col
lected in summer quarter. Assuming that there are
12,000 registered students in each of these three
quarters, this will represent $6000 revenue in each
quarter for a total of $18,000 for the whole year.
Refunds will vary from the way they arc presently
done. The amount collected for a student group in a
quarter will be the amount available to students
from refunds. Because the amount collected for a
student group may not be a round fi
gure, the total amount of money to be
refunded to an individual student will
be rounded to the nearest quarter to
ease disbursement problems at the
time refunds are given.
Also beginning in the fall, only stu
dents who voted in the previous
spring's election or individuals like
freshmen, who could not have voted,
will be eligible to receive refunds.
Also, student groups will now in
clude in the budgets they submit to the
ASSU for approval the percentage of
refunds they expect to lose in the fol
lowing year. This Ls done because stu
dent groups will receive 25 percent of
their fee assessment request in fall,
winter, and spring quarters, but the
percentage of refunds throughout the
preceeding three quarters will be de
ducted from the 25 percent that re
mains, according to Senator Joe
Hughes, one of the authors of the im
plementation report for the new fee
assessment system. However, if a stu
dent group's refunds are running at a

rate higher than 25 percent, the ASSU
financial office has the right to with
hold some of that groups fee assess
ment for spring quarter.
One problem that may arise from the
refund system is the percentage student
groups predict they will lose in student
refunds. If they predict a figure that is
too high — the maximum is 25 percent
— then they will receive more money
than they were entitled to receive.
However, Senator James McGrath,
another author of the report, said that
there were many checks to prevent this
from occurring. For example, to get on
the spring quarter ballot a group must
have 20 percent of the students sign a
petition or 10 percent and senate ap
proval. Then, a group must have its fee
assessment ratified by the voters. Even
if a group passes all these checks, it still
must report changes of more than a
certain amount — the senate has not
yet decided how much — in any line
item of its budget to the ASSU finan
cial office. Thus, if it receives more
money than it expected to, and thus has
to change its budget, the ASSU will
become aware of any major discrepan
cies between a group's predicted re
fund rate and the actual rate.

assessment system. However, if a stu
dent group's refunds are running at a

rate higher than 25 percent, the ASSU
financial office has the right to with
hold some of that groups fee assess
ment for spring quarter.
One problem that may arise from the
refund system is the percentage student
groups predict they will lose in student
refunds. If they predict a figure that is
too high — the maximum is 25 percent
— then they will receive more money
than they were entitled to receive.
However, Senator James McGrath,
another author of the report, said that
there were many checks to prevent this
from occurring. For example, to get on
the spring quarter ballot a group must
have 20 percent of the students sign a
petition or 10 percent and senate ap
proval. Then, a group must have its fee
assessment ratified by the voters. Even
if a group passes all these checks, it still
must report changes of more than a
certain amount — the senate has not
yet decided how much — in any line
item of its budget to the ASSU finan
cial office. Thus, if it receives more
money than it expected to, and thus has
to change its budget, the ASSU will
become aware of any major discrepan
cies between a group's predicted re
fund rate and the actual rate.
A series of changes in the ASSU fee assessment
process, including a stipulation that onh students
whovote in an ASSU fee assessment election will be
able to obtain refunds, are scheduled nexi fall. The
changes hinge on ASSU Senate approval of a report
written by a special subcommittee formed to draw
up guidelines for the fee assessment reform
amendment that was passed by l ist spring.
The process by which student group> obtain fee
assessments, which represent approximately
$10,000 for each quarter's assessment and which
often make up a substantial portion of i student
group's budget, will undergo substantial alterations.
The new system will also permit student groups to
request a fee in any amount above $400 U.
Under the new system there will be two different
kinds of fee assessments. One will be the association
fee and the other is the special fee. The association
fee will fund various ASSU boards, sUsh as the
Program Board, the Publications Board. and the
Academic Organizations Board. These hoards allo
cate money to student organizations that often are
not large enough to justify having their own fee

assessment.
However, if a group funded by one of these
boards receives more than $5000 in a single year or
$ 12,000 in three years (the new system provides for
indexing of these figures to reflect inflation), it will
be directed to apply for a special fee. This, in turn,
will be obtainable if the group can secure petition
signatures of at least 10 percent of the student body
and senate approval, or signatures from 20 percent
of the student body, in order to appear on the fee
assessment ballot.
To gain funding for next year, these groups will
apply to the various allocations boards for funds
early this quarter. Each board will draw up a budget
allocating money to the various student groups that
applied toit, using the funding requests as a guide to
this process. The senate will then ratify these
budgets; no voter approval is required for the as
sociation fee assessments.
The special fee assessment will have a minimum
request of $4000 for a fiscal year and will operate
much like present fee assessments except that
groups can request any amount of fees above the
$4000 minimum.
Another difference between this new system and

the old one is that there are no more one or two
quarter fee assessments; instead, groups will receive
the same amount of money each quarter.
Unlike association fees, voter approval will be
required for these special fee assessments.
Once special fees and the association fee have
been approved, the financial office of the ASSU will
draw up a schedule determining the quarter in
which various student groups fees will be collected,
and how much will be collected for each group. This
schedule will attempt to even out the amount of
money collected each quarter.
Thus, if one organization requests $10,000 and
another requests $8000, the ASSU financial office
may decide to collect 50 cents from each student in
fall, winter and spring quarters, with no money col
lected in summer quarter. Assuming that there are
12,000 registered students in each of these three
quarters, this will represent $6000 revenue in each
quarter for a total of $18,000 for the whole year.
Refunds will vary from the way they arc presently
done. The amount collected for a student group in a
quarter will be the amount available to students
from refunds. Because the amount collected for a
student group may not be a round fi
gure, the total amount of money to be
refunded to an individual student will
be rounded to the nearest quarter to
ease disbursement problems at the
time refunds are given.
Also beginning in the fall, only stu
dents who voted in the previous
spring's election or individuals like
freshmen, who could not have voted,
will be eligible to receive refunds.
Also, student groups will now in
clude in the budgets they submit to the
ASSU for approval the percentage of
refunds they expect to lose in the fol
lowing year. This Ls done because stu
dent groups will receive 25 percent of
their fee assessment request in fall,
winter, and spring quarters, but the
percentage of refunds throughout the
preceeding three quarters will be de
ducted from the 25 percent that re
mains, according to Senator Joe
Hughes, one of the authors of the im
plementation report for the new fee
assessment system. However, if a stu
dent group's refunds are running at a

rate higher than 25 percent, the ASSU
