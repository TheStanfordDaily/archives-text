## Bechtel I-Center works to unite foreign and native students 
### FELICIA LEE 
Bechtel International Center,
located between Tresidder
Union and Florence Moore Hall,
serves not only to help Stanford's
foreign students feel at home in
their new surroundings, but also
to acquaint American students
with the world's many different
cultures, people and ways of life.
The present I-Center, as it is
known, is located in what for
merly was the Zete house. It
moved to this location in 1963,
after the former International
Center, which was located near
Lathrop House, was destroyed
by fire. The present international
center was named after Stephen
Bechtel, who provided the funds
for the remodeling of the old
Zete house.
The I-Center provides a di
verse range of services and ac
tivities for both foreign and
American students. Among its
primary services are the provid
ing of legal, financial and family
counseling, as well as conversa
tional English dasses and orien
tation programs for incoming
students. According to Lee
Zeigler, director of the I-Center,
qot all foreign students use
services and those who most fre
quently take advantage of them
tend to be those who are least

familiar with the American sys
tem and culture.
The I-Center also sponsors a
large number of social and recre
ational activities for interna
tional students. Among these are
the Holiday House program,
which has been held for the past
four years, and the Mornings
About Town program, which
consists of tours of local areas of
interest for the spouses of.
foreign students, most of whom
are prohibited from workingÂ»in
the United States.
Programs for the children of
international students are also
held by the I-Center. According
to Penny Thorpe, Program
Coordinator for the I-Center,
these children, most of whom are
quite young, generally adjust
easily to life in the Stanford area.
Another responsibility of the
I-Center is the arrangement of
tours and activities for the more
than 1200 international visitors
who come to Stanford each year.
One service of the I-Center
aimed primarily at American
students is provided by the Over
ses Resource Center, which
helps jhfonpatiqq,

travel, stuck or work. Although
the center itself does not sponsor
any overseas programs or scho

larships, it provides contacts and
counseling for those planning to
go abroad and issues interna
tional student ID cards for
travelling students. In addition
to this service, the Overseas Re
source Center also handles Stan
ford applications for such foreign
scholarships as the Rhodes and
Fulbright scholarships.
Besides promoting foreign
travel in general, the Overseas
Resource Center hopes specifi
cally to encourage more travel in
the Third World. Although stu
dents have traditionally chosen
Europe for overseas study and
the majority of Stanford students
continue to choose Europe for
their travels, there exists "a
growing number of students in
terested in Third World coun
tries," according to ORC direc
tor Cathy Gammon.
In addition to providing in
formation on overseas travel for
American students, the ORC
also provides information for
foreign visitors on travel within
the United States.
Other 1-Center activities are
designed to promote contact be
tween international and Ameri
can students, as well as to expose
students to different cultures.
Among these activities are the
Sunday Suppers, which feature

international menus prepared by
volunteers, informal classes in
such subjects as yoga and
folkdancing, foreign films and a
language exchange program, in
which a student desiring practice
speaking a foreign language can
practice with a native speaker of
the language.
In addition, the I-Center
sponsors several luncheon dis
cussion groups, in which groups
consisting of six American and
six foreign students discuss such
controversial subjects as sex
roles in different cultures and the
influence of superpowers on
world politics. Despite the highly
political nature of these topics,
however, the I-Center itself does
not support any one political
view and is, according to Zeigler,
"open ground for any political or
social activity." Zeigler points
out that such diverse groups as
COJME, which works for justice
in the Middle East, and Amnesty
International have held their
functions in the I-Center.
Despite the fact that the face
ofStanford'sinternational popu
lation has changed over the past
few years, the goals of the
I-Center remain the same. Stu
dents' interests, however, have

changed over the years, and the
I-Center reflects these changes.
According to Zeigler, interna
tional students 15 years ago, like
their American counterparts,
were more socially aware a nd so
cially active than students today.
Programs involving volunteer
work in East Palo Alto and in the
inner cities, once popular with
foreign students, have now fallen
from favor. International stu
dents, like most Stanford stu
dents, Zeigler states, are now
chiefly concerned with "getting
degrees and finding jobs."
Zeigler also states that today's
foreign students are more
"sophisticated" and knowledge
able about American life than
were earlier students.
Another important concern of
the I-Center, according to
Zeigler, is "the false impression
that the I-Center is only for
foreign students." He adds that
there is "definitely not" enough
day-to-day contact between
American and foreign students,
a majority of whom are graduate
students. The I-Center, then,
serves as a center for contact be
tween the two groups. "We're
not a foreign ghetto," Zeigler
emphasizes.
