Runoff
Election
Today
★ *
All Daily staffers: For the more
than 100 of you who have done
enough work on the editorial side of
the newspaper to be on the staff vot
ing list, there will be a runoff election
today. Because no candidate received
a majority of the votes cast in Thurs
day's election, Doug Jehl and Karen
Springen have advanced to today's
special election. This election will be
conducted as the other was, with vot
ing taking place between noon and 10
p.m. and with a majority of those
votes cast being necessary for any
candidate to win the election.
If you have any complaints, ques
tions or suggestions , please speak
to Richard Klingler. As always, best
of luck to the candidates.
