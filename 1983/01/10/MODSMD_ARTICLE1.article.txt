# Alpha Sig leaves national organization
## 
### KRISTEN CHRISTOPHER Senior staff writer 
After nine years of conflict with the national
Alpha Sigma Phi fraternity, members of the cam
pus chapter are giving up their charter and plan to
begin a new fraternity called Alpha Sigma.
The split from the national organization was
made definite last Wednesday when residents of
the Coweil Cluster's Alpha Sig house — the Tau
chapter — voted in favor of the move. Letters
containing a statement of purpose were sent to the
national organization and several hundred alumni
on Friday.
Problems between the chapter here and the na
tional fraternity began in 1973 when members of
the all-male fraternity decided to enter the house
into the University housing draw. The national
refused to recognize women residents as members
of the fraternity and disapproved of the non
selectivity of male members.
rhe campus chapter was suspended in January,
1981. Since that time, Stanford Alpha Sigs have
been trying to negotiate a compromise with the
national but House Manager Jimmy Kimzie said,
'Its down to the point where we realize they
won't accept any of our compromises."
Kimzie called the selection of members through
the housing draw the "main stumbling block."
The national was willing to have women living
in the house, Kimzie said, but its unwillingness to
recognize them as members apparently bothers

Alpha Sig residents.
"Since the national council has not recognized
women as equal members, even on a local option
basis, we feel that the only way to give women in
the house full recognition is to establish ourselves
as a local fraternity," according to the statement of
purpose, written by senior Leon Hilton, house
president.
"The whole idea in dropping the national is to
start our own fraternity," Kimzie said.
During spring quarter a constitution, by-laws
and a ritual book for a new fraternity were drafted,
Hilton said, and those documents will be reviewed
in the next few weeks.
Hilton and Adam Elsesser, Alpha Sig resident
assistant, met with Row Director Diana Conklin
earlier this year, but Hilton said they will not know
the University's detailed reaction and willingness
to recognize the new fraternity until next week.
As to the response from the national, Hilton
said that though they are aware of the move by
Alpha Sigs here, they opted to wait to receive the
letter before commenting.
"Technically, a person can't quit the frater
nity," Hilton said, adding that he expects the na
tional to dismiss the members.
An Alpha Sigma Phi charter will still exist on
campus and the national has three options, accord
ing to Hilton. They can try to reorganize an all
male fraternity, retract the charter, or remain in
active.

Rejjnjishing the national charter will probably
not afßi the Alpha Sig house. "We will not lose
much ofiything mainly because we haven't been
that sfcgly tied to the national," Hilton said.
Howjber, funds for large projects provided by
the lodU hapter, headed by the Tau corporation,
will n®]flgi-r be available, Hilton said that he is
not wA?d about that because the house has not
requeJje money for several years and is finan
cially «ud.
Those unds have been generated by dues paid
by won; the national organization would not
acceptfcht money.
Accfronj: to Hilton, the most important prob
lem thkt ;ouid arise from the split with the na
tional I tie loss of alumni support.
"W«vant to increase our relations with
alumniP'he said. Members of the house have
planneM idinner for alumni on Feb. 25.
Alurhnaid in initiation and advising, according
to AlpnaSig Peter Sylvester, a 1953 Stanford
graduate, and are important forces in keeping
tradition.
"1 ceftainly support the right of students living
in a residence to decide what kind of living situa
tion suits them best," he said.
Although Sylvester said he and other alumni are
sorry toij&ee the dissolution of their fraternity, he
said he qoes not think anyone will be outraged,
especially because the split from the national has
appeared inevitable for several years.
