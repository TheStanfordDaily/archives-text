## Amnesty International's letters free foreign prisoners 
### BOB ORTTUNG 
Writing a letter to the King of
Morocco and telling him to clean
up his act is not as crazy as it
sounds, at least not to members
of Amnesty International (AI).
The international organization
sends as many letters as it can to
various countries in hopes of
gaining freedom for certain pris
oners. Approximately one-third
of the prisoners AI "adopts" are

released.
Each Thursday the group
meets at the Bechtel Interna
tional Center to hear reports of
individual prisoners all over the
world. They also invite speakers
from campus to explain current
conditions in various countries.
AI itself was founded in 1961
in Great Britain by Peter Benen
son and holds no religious or
political ties. And because it pub

lishes information about indi
vidual prisoners, AI is the only
organization of its kind in the
world. By the mid 1970s it had
about 40,000 members in 57
countries.
AI usually hears about the
prisoners it works with from a
prisoner's friend or relatives. It
then sends a staff member or one
of its representatives in that
country to investigate a particu
lar case.

Many of these
prisoners are in
deteriorating health,
have been tortured or
are about to be
executed.

Before AI will begin its plea
for a particular person's free
dom, it checks to make sure he
has never used or advocated vio
lence to accomplish his goals, as
the use of violence is shunned by
AI.
Once a prisoner is adopted, AI
releases Urgent Action appeals

to its fccichapters around the
world.fee reports explain the
plight Individual prisoners.
Many esc prisoners are in
detericmtg health, have been
torture care about to be exe
cuted.
The \t writing then begins
in an e: >ito free the prisoner.
Each m rer of AI writes about
one let : week.
The trs themselves are not
necessa [flashy; simplicity and
politen* jre stressed. In many
cases, ji tthe fact that the out
side wc Icshows interest in a
particul [terson is enough to
make t egwernment thin:-,
twice at iiwhat it is doing.

'I ha fealways
beliei el that torture
iswrc y. In Amnesty
Interi ttional /
founc i group with
the sc ie ideals and
was e yer to get
involhi:

"It is st; -ding that all you have
to do is v iie a letter," said AI
member 1 ill Tierney.
Althou h the letters are not
unique, t! pir authors definitely
are. Jenni Noe was studying in
Vienna 1: it year when Poland
declared i |artial law. Many re
fugees fled to Austria and she
became imolved in organiza
tions helpfcg them. Noe joined
AI in the ffll when she returned.
"I havelalways believed that
torture is wrong," Noe said. "In
Amnesty laternational 1 found a
group with* the same ideals and
was eager to get involved."
Lynn Marcus joined after
hearing a speaker from the in
ternational level of AI suggest
the idea of sending a letter to a
Turkish jailkeeper to free a pris
oner.
Tierney spent two years in the
Peace Corps working in
Morocco. Every so often he ac
tually sends a letter to the kind
on a prisoner's behalf.
The members of the group are
not dismayed by the fact that the
people they help are often on the
other side of the world. "It may

seem like a cliche but people are
all the same; imprisonment hurts
them as much as it hurts me,"
Robert Townsend said.
The Stanford chapter of AI is
making a comeback after falling
apart two years ago. Townsend,
who was instrumental in starting
AI again on campus, came to
Stanford for law school and tried
to join the local chapter, but dis
covered it had folded.

Townsend and a few friends
restarted AI at Stanford and
since then their core has grown
to about 70 people.
Much of the spirit of the group
is characterized by Jinetta Sagen,
the founder of Al's American
division. Sagen was captured in
World War II by the Germans
while helping the Italian resis
tance. While in prison, someone
placed a matchbox inside a loaf
of bread and gave it to her. The

message was but a word in
length: "courage." On a per
sonal level, this showed Sagen
how important it was for prison
ers to know that there are people
who are familiar with their plight
and are working to help them.
The Stanford chapter of AI
contains no form of hierarchy.
Townsend describes it as "a
group of committed individuals
with everyone doing what they
can."
