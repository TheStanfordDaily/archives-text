## The 						Stanford Daily Ghosts of monarchs past 
### 
What can you say to the Queen of England? You
might try the light conversation tack: ask about the
weather, what the Queen thinks of California or
how she enjoyed the tour of the Hewlett-Packard
plant. No, too irreverent. You might try the policy
angle: ask about unemployment in Britain, the
Common Market or the growing influence of
British policies throughout the world. No, tactless
at best.
Yet there is something about the Queen's visit
that has prompted doting coverage by newspapers
and television stations around the nation. Some
thing beyond the opportunity to lob probing ques
tions to a monarch has scores of otherwise un
flappable University social climbers beseeching
the powers that be for a place at the Queen's
luncheon.
There are, of course, the quick explanations of
how Americans long for the royal heritage they
denied themselves or of how the Queen fulfills the
mother figure role a heritage of founding fathers
has never provided. Another pseudo
psychological explanation is that — especially in
dismal economic times — Americans wish to in
habit a Cinderella world of counts, royal balls,
princes and champagne that is the fantasy fulfill
ment of a materialism that has no aristocracy to
consolidate its success.
Even if these reasons are put forth too quickly,
there is something special in the Queen's visit.

Even if Americans will never inhabit their roman
ticized world and can never adopt their own roy
alty, there is something that elevates the Queen's
visit beyond a public relations tour of a nominal
head of state. A tour by Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher would be the occasion for pointed ques
tions whose answers might lead to a greater under
standing of foreign affairs, but that benefit is not
what adds luster to the Queen's presence.
The reason there is little appropriate to say to
the Queen is the same that makes her visit an
occasion for celebration and wonder: she repre
sents an institution as much as an individual, and
brings with her the symbols of a rich past as she
embodies it. And hers is our past, too, which jus
tifies and explains much of the excitement accom
panying her tour. With the current monarch comes
the ghosts of a past that has very much shaped our
present: ceremonies that hearken back to those of
George 111 or courtesies accorded figures who
could assemble battalions and navies around the
globe.
So don't worry that there will be little of rele
vance to ask the Queen or that the media insist
upon turning the trip into a circus. Enjoy the
pageantry with the knowledge that with the
Queen's visit we come a bit closer to ourselves, and
see through the images of ages shadowed glimpses
of our present selves.
