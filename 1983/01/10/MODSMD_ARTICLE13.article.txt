## Make first-class Oxford students 
### 
Those of us who are associated with both the University
and Magdalen College, Oxford, were delighted when
through a joint arrangement a Stanford in Oxford was
established. It was a bit of a shock, therefore, when some
key faculty members said they disapproved of the decision
on the basis that Stanford students will be second-class
citizens.
They have a point. Rhodes Scholars are definitely first
class citizens, because they are the product of a rigorous
selection process, which is the modus operandi of Oxford.
However, run-of-the-mill American students will have to
prove themselves. There are at Oxford many new institu
tions with high standards, but they will be regarded as
marginal until they have stood the test of time. The attitude
of the Stanford administration seems to be "we will try this
experiment for five years to see if it works." But if, at the
end of five years. Stanford in Oxford has not proved itself
and is abandoned, it would be better the experiment had
never been begun. It will take 20 years before Stanford in
Oxford is regarded by the host university as having proved
itself.
What can be done to make sure that the experiment does
not go sour? The first requirement is respect for the envi
ronment. Magdalen is a beautiful college in a beautiful city.
The maintenance of its fabric is a main concern of the
American Friends of Magdalen College, headed by a re
markable former Rhodes Scholar, Charles Saltzman, who
has had a distinguished career in government and finance.
The brochures which his organization prepares reflect an
intense love of Oxford architecture, and the funds collected
among old members of the college provide invaluable help
in maintaining and restoring the exquisite masonry and
stonework.
Unfortunately, the experience here would suggest that
the wrong attitude is all too prevalent at the University.
Visitors to Stanford student residences are often appalled
by the slummy conditions. The struggle to prevent the Uni
versity buildings from becoming a slum seems like a losing
battle, and unfortunately some of the offenders are faculty
members who ought to know better. Nor does the cause
receive any help from University publications, including the
Daily, whose distributors toss bundles around the quad and
the bookstore with obvious scorn for the litter problem.
Noise pollution is another problem. The beerbusts on

fraternity row, with 'musicians" whose amplified sound
may shatter the walls of the new music building, infuriate
the campus residents whose peace is destroyed and leave the
area of the conviviality littered with beer cans and paper
plates. Like all Oxford colleges, Magdalen chapel is a
sanctuary of great music, and on occasion the choir sings
from the majestic tower overlooking Stanford in Oxford.
Comparisons will be odious.
Perhaps the concept of "a scholar and a gentleman" is
quaint and archaic, but Stanford campuses abroad would do
well to realize that it is not quite dead at Oxford. Visitors to
Stanfords abroad are taken aback when they politely greet
students sitting in the lobby and get a response which can be
described as at best casual. Dinner is still something of a
ceremony in Oxford's magnificent halls. Meals in some
Stanfords abroad have all the charm of San Quentin. Again,
comparisons could be odious.
Oxford's educational system is quite un-American. Stu
dents "read" their major. The core is the kind of reading
throughout the year, including the vacations, which Stan
ford students are not accustomed to. The work is supervised
by the tutorial system. Lectures are optional, and some
times are an expression of the lecturer's research. The
American system, in which teaching has become a popular
ity contest and reading is subsidiary, is properly looked
upon as a continuation of high school. Stanford students
complaints about the quality of lecturing, meaning popular
appeal, will not be appreciated.
Care should be taken in selecting the Stanford visiting
faculty to make sure they understand what is involved.
Failure to observe common courtesies, such as answering
letters, will arouse the Ruggles of Red Gap lurking in every
European, indeed in our own Eastern elite.
In Rome, do as the Romans do. It might have been better
were the Farm's Oxford outpost housed on a farm near
Oxford. Since Stanford has chosen instead to live on the
Forum, it must remember that the Romans will observe
with curiosity the strange tribe which comes from the out
post of civilization. Let us hope they will be moved to
paraphrase the remark attributed to Saint Augustine when
he saw English slaves in Rome: "Non Angli, sed angeli" â€”
"Not Angles, but angels." The concept of angels is
quaint and archaic, so let us settle for scholars and gentle
men. Or is that too much?
