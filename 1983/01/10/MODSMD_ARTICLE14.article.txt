## Computers won't rescue waterlogged humanities departments 
### 
When Pope John Paul said the other
day that atheism was at the root of the
world's troubles, one suspects that few
on campuses like ours would agree.
One need not agree entirely and still
may be concerned by that easy mass
rejection. It is not a question of a
specific belief like the pope's but of a
healthy direction of things. Saul Bel
low, for example, in The Dean's De
cember. is disturbed by a lack of the
deeply "personal" in his time, and not
just in the Soviet bloc country in which
his protagonist is struggling. My own
concern has locally to do with the
pragmatic thrust of our civilization and
of Stanford, insufficiently balanced
with the spiritual dimension of life, or
what Camus tended to call gingerly (gi
ven his past paganism) "the sacred."
That imbalance is manifested by the
disastrous drop in humanities study
here (as elsewhere). Our recent poor
showing in the national ratings of
humanities departments indicates we
have not done enough managerially to
help the situation, and that other great
rival institutions are in better shape in
this regard. Part of the reason is that if
you want to improve the humanities

you have to have the expert direction of
a humanist, not a scientist. Another
part is that you cannot use all sorts of
criteria which are not purely qualitative
to choose your personnel (imagine if
this method were applied to a sports
team or an orchestra, or a scientific
research team. .. .).
If Stanford continues to ignore pa
tent realities (such as the law that says if
a ball can't fall it can't bounce up; the
same applies to studies) it is easy to
predict the results: an even worse de
cline in our reputation, already reeling.
This is clearly parallel to the interna
tional crash looming beyond our reces
sion. if we don't shape up financially.
* If we do not do our share to educate
authentically some spiritual and intel
lectual leaders, our country to that ex
tent will tend to blunder blindly along a
path parallel to the soul-less prag
matism which took Nazi Germany over
a cliff and has made a living hell of the
Soviet Union.
It is not a question, I repeat, of a
specific dogma. Our greatest writers,
collectively, representing varied beliefs
including some sophisticated ones such
as pantheism (like Emily Dickenson's.

or Camus" "sacred"), afford a strong
sense of general spiritual direction.
And these writers have a vital sense of
the tragic dimension of existence, cut
ting through the sentimental half
truths of modern liberal ideology. One
can never be authentically educated
without a serious exploration of those
alarming depths, which underlie the
daily relations between the sexes, the
races and all other important human
realities. Only so many people are very
talented for peering lucidly into those
existential abysses, guided by Virgil.
Dante, Dostoevsky, Nietzsche, Gide,
Proust el aland coming up with en
lightened. humane and good-hearted
perspectives for the long-range gui
dance of the country's endeavors.
So let us have done with lip-service
and gimmickry. It is not computers and
word-processors nor the extraneous
and exhibitionistic "institutes" which
often would rather spread the pluralis
tic and hollow doctrines which are br
inging us down wholesale which are
going to bail out the waterlogged
humanistic enterprises here. In this re
spect, Allan Bloom's "Our Listless
Universities" (Dec. 10, National Re

view) is a minor classic and must read
ing. Gerald Graff likewise, in various
at tides, pointedly observes that busi
ness enterprises including universities
ate often more amoral and spiritually
empty than the "post-modernist" dis
sidents who pretend to war on them.
Let's be serious; let's stop playing
games; let's seek out people with god
given talent and find ways of getting
them here for keeps. Let's make it pos
sible for our students to spend time
reading and thinking before they dash
off term papers. Let's locate a dedi
cated humanist leader out there (or in
hfre) and put him in charge of the cam
paign for excellence. Let's start the pa
tient process of building a solid univer
sity along with its scientific and
technological wings.
|A few days ago I got a letter from a
gtpnd old scholar who is a truly tower
ing figure, unique. He expressed keen
dkappointment with Stanford, in
winch he had previously placed great
hfpes. There was a real and saddening
nlte of despair in his voice. Let's prove
hi is wrong!

When Pope John Paul said the other
day that atheism was at the root of the
world's troubles, one suspects that few
on campuses like ours would agree.
One need not agree entirely and still
may be concerned by that easy mass
rejection. It is not a question of a
specific belief like the pope's but of a
healthy direction of things. Saul Bel
low, for example, in The Dean's De
cember. is disturbed by a lack of the
deeply "personal" in his time, and not
just in the Soviet bloc country in which
his protagonist is struggling. My own
concern has locally to do with the
pragmatic thrust of our civilization and
of Stanford, insufficiently balanced
with the spiritual dimension of life, or
what Camus tended to call gingerly (gi
ven his past paganism) "the sacred."
That imbalance is manifested by the
disastrous drop in humanities study
here (as elsewhere). Our recent poor
showing in the national ratings of
humanities departments indicates we
have not done enough managerially to
help the situation, and that other great
rival institutions are in better shape in
this regard. Part of the reason is that if
you want to improve the humanities

you have to have the expert direction of
a humanist, not a scientist. Another
part is that you cannot use all sorts of
criteria which are not purely qualitative
to choose your personnel (imagine if
this method were applied to a sports
team or an orchestra, or a scientific
research team. .. .).
If Stanford continues to ignore pa
tent realities (such as the law that says if
a ball can't fall it can't bounce up; the
same applies to studies) it is easy to
predict the results: an even worse de
cline in our reputation, already reeling.
This is clearly parallel to the interna
tional crash looming beyond our reces
sion. if we don't shape up financially.
* If we do not do our share to educate
authentically some spiritual and intel
lectual leaders, our country to that ex
tent will tend to blunder blindly along a
path parallel to the soul-less prag
matism which took Nazi Germany over
a cliff and has made a living hell of the
Soviet Union.
It is not a question, I repeat, of a
specific dogma. Our greatest writers,
collectively, representing varied beliefs
including some sophisticated ones such
as pantheism (like Emily Dickenson's.

or Camus" "sacred"), afford a strong
sense of general spiritual direction.
And these writers have a vital sense of
the tragic dimension of existence, cut
ting through the sentimental half
truths of modern liberal ideology. One
can never be authentically educated
without a serious exploration of those
alarming depths, which underlie the
daily relations between the sexes, the
races and all other important human
realities. Only so many people are very
talented for peering lucidly into those
existential abysses, guided by Virgil.
Dante, Dostoevsky, Nietzsche, Gide,
Proust el aland coming up with en
lightened. humane and good-hearted
perspectives for the long-range gui
dance of the country's endeavors.
So let us have done with lip-service
and gimmickry. It is not computers and
word-processors nor the extraneous
and exhibitionistic "institutes" which
often would rather spread the pluralis
tic and hollow doctrines which are br
inging us down wholesale which are
going to bail out the waterlogged
humanistic enterprises here. In this re
spect, Allan Bloom's "Our Listless
Universities" (Dec. 10, National Re

view) is a minor classic and must read
ing. Gerald Graff likewise, in various
at tides, pointedly observes that busi
ness enterprises including universities
ate often more amoral and spiritually
empty than the "post-modernist" dis
sidents who pretend to war on them.
Let's be serious; let's stop playing
games; let's seek out people with god
given talent and find ways of getting
them here for keeps. Let's make it pos
sible for our students to spend time
reading and thinking before they dash
off term papers. Let's locate a dedi
cated humanist leader out there (or in
hfre) and put him in charge of the cam
paign for excellence. Let's start the pa
tient process of building a solid univer
sity along with its scientific and
technological wings.
