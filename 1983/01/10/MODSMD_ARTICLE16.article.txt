# Notes in the Margin
## Risk a New Year's resolution 
### 
Have you kept to your New Year's
resolution? It has been over a week
now since Jan. 1 and we've all had
ample time to fall to folly, succumb to
routine, and abandon our newly-laid
plans.
Or didn't you make one? " Man's not
perfect." Or, "If God had meant us to
follow orders he wouldn't have given us
brains."
Such talk is all well and good for
some who want to lock themselves up
in a closet. However, this philosophy is
oflittleuseif we want to deal with life's
hopes, wants and frustrations. And it is
safe to say that indecision is one of the
most woeful agonies of this existence.
The making of New Year's resolu
tions is an oft-mocked and belittled
practice: "as if we could change the
world." However, from a less defeatist
perspective, an at least yearly personal
inventory and "redirectioning" can be
a most effective way of identifying and
making time for what we want to do in
our lives.
Every day we make decisions that
affect our courses in life, most in a small
way: cereal or eggs for breakfast, walk
or bike to school, study late or sleep.
We weigh the simple factors involved
and make a choice based on the out
come most desired. However, long-run
issues tend to be settled in a wholly
different manner — more by momen
tum than mind.
Do I truly want to become an en
gineer, lawyer, chemist, mother of
three? Commonly, people accept the
validity of long-term goals proposed by
society's indices (respectability, profit
and power) rather than personal
priorities (mental stimulation, emo
tional satisfaction). It is in these latter
areas that New Year's resolutions are
grounded.
In the process of formulating an ap
propriate New Year's resolution we
take on the essential question we face
in our lives: are we doing what we can
to make the life we want to lead for
burselves? Answering this question in
evitably involves a recognition of that
hazy concept of one's "self."
Throughout our working lives we try
to make time to spend with our friends,
a book, even our stereo systems. But

can you remember the last time you
made time to spend with yourself? Yes,
I mean to sit down for a few moments
and see what your own brain, heart and
soul are saying about your life.
If you've never done it, this is not an
easy thing to do. At first, you might
have to get a pencil and paper out and
write down a few questions for your
interview, in case no one can think of
anything to say. But, after the ice is
broken, you might be amazed at what
you can learn about yourself.
New Year's comes around only once
a year, and it is probably the most con
venient time for reappraisals: it is
something to do while deciding the
small issue of where to hang this year's
calendar. However, any day of the year
will do.
Unplug the phone. Deposit yourself
on your favorite chair, bed or piece of
floor. There's nothing to worry about
— you can even set the alarm if you're
afraid of spending too much time on

yourself. Maybe you'll decide Stanford
is not where you want to be and you'll
have your tuition money refunded and
get on the next plane bound for New
Zealand. Maybe not.
Different wants and needs are bound
to contradict, which is why many resol
utions are broken days or even hours
after being made. But what'simportant
is not the resolution itself, but the re
solving.
It is always easy to put off the future,
because it has a way of arriving of its
own accord. In some ways it is too bad
that we don't have to do something
different in order for time to pass. But,
while convenient today, stagnancy
comes with a risk: the possibility that
someday you' 11 realize that once upon a
time you missed a chance to take your
life by the tail.
So, risk a resolution.

write down a few questions for your
interview, in case no one can think of
anything to say. But, after the ice is
broken, you might be amazed at what
you can learn about yourself.
New Year's comes around only once
a year, and it is probably the most con
venient time for reappraisals: it is
something to do while deciding the
small issue of where to hang this year's
calendar. However, any day of the year
will do.
Unplug the phone. Deposit yourself
on your favorite chair, bed or piece of
floor. There's nothing to worry about
— you can even set the alarm if you're
afraid of spending too much time on

yourself. Maybe you'll decide Stanford
is not where you want to be and you'll
have your tuition money refunded and
get on the next plane bound for New
Zealand. Maybe not.
Different wants and needs are bound
to contradict, which is why many resol
utions are broken days or even hours
after being made. But what'simportant
is not the resolution itself, but the re
solving.
It is always easy to put off the future,
because it has a way of arriving of its
own accord. In some ways it is too bad
that we don't have to do something
different in order for time to pass. But,
while convenient today, stagnancy
comes with a risk: the possibility that
someday you' 11 realize that once upon a
time you missed a chance to take your
life by the tail.
So, risk a resolution.
