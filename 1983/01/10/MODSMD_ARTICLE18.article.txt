# Stanford chapter of Astro and Aero Institute to put fluids experiment on Space Shuttle
## 
### MARY CATHERINE FISH 
One project in the vast array
of experiments under develop
ment here is destined for low
earth orbit.
A team of students coordi
nated by the Stanford chapter of
the American Institute of
Aeronautics and Astronautics is
working on a Get Away Special
(GAS) project which will be
aboard a Space Shuttle Orbiter
scheduled for launch in the
summer of 1984.
Through the GAS program,
NASA sells extra room in its
' space shuttle cargo bays in the
form of large "garbage cans"
„ that are taken aboard. An exper
iment fated to enclosure in one
of these cans is now being de
signed by students in the De
ipartment of Aeronautics and As
jtronautics. The project was
►started while Gary Allen was
of the Stanford AIAA.

Emilio Calius is currently presi
dent.
The experiment itself will
study the interaction of fluids
and their containers. On earth,
gravity forces pull down on a
liquid and the boundaries of the
container confine it.
If you've ever seen the menis
cus curve which is notable in a
tube containing a fluid, you've
observed other forces at work.
These surface and cohesive
forces are negligible on earth be
cause gravity is predominant.
However, they become the ones
that govern fluid behavior if
there is no gravity.
What the GAS project desig
ners have in mind is to observe
the shape and movement of
liquid surfaces in capillary tubes
as they go into space and enter
the world of apparent zero
gravity. Because the shuttle will
be between about 70 and 500

miles from the earth's surface,
there will still be quite a bit of
gravitational force.
However, as Calius explained,
"The gravitational force is com
pensated by the centrifugal force
of this thing spinning around the
earth." The result is a condition
very close to that of zero-gravity.
The experiment will be self
contained, battery powered, and
automatically controlled by a
microprocessor-based system.
Data collected will be mostly in
the form of pictures — cameras
will take sequences of pictures of
the interfaces. Two or more
cameras could be used whose
projections could later give
three-dimensional information.
Motion picture cameras are also
being considered.
Experimenters will also want
to measure temperature, fluid
characteristics being a function
of it. Acceleration measure

ments m sibe carefully re
corded; \( will vary even
though th i ill be close to zero
net. The b the fluid behaves
when it i sddenly without a
sense of u cdown will depend
on three \ rib'es: the shape of
its contain fluid itself and
acceleratic .
When tl rxperiment travels
it will be si kn up, so it must be
put back t< an orderly state
and obser xfrom there. The
plan is to « iulate gravitational
force, possi |;by putting the ex
periment o atype of turntable.
Once in pee, it would spin
and the cei r'ugal force would
push the liq icto one area of the
container, "fjhin, when the spin
ning devicJi turned off, the
transformatlpis that the liquid
undergoes dp be followed as it
proceeds frajnithe familiar state
to the yet mysterious one of low
gravity.

The data extracted will be
general and not high precision;
however, it is a vital starting
place and will be essential when
more sophisticated measure
ments follow. There will be many
applications for this fundamental
information.
For jexample, there are impor
tant implications for any rocket
using liquid fuel. On earth fuel
goes out the bottom of a tank,
but in space the exact location of
the fuel is unknown, especially
when the tank isn't full. New
data is needed to predict this be
havior and to find the best shape
and design of liquid propellant
systems.
New ideas are evolving in the
science of materials processing.
This is one activity that will be in
the forefront of industrial pro
jects are ever executed in space.
One of the major problems in
the field of materials processing
is that of contamination control.
During the high-temperature
fluid stages of materials proces
sing, all kinds of contaminants
from surfaces come into contact
with the material. Since fluids
behave differently in space, it
may be possible to achieve less
contact between fluids and their
containers, thereby lessening
contamination.
Not only do builders of the
GAS project have to worry
about how the experiment will
perform, they have to be con
cerned with making sure it
doesn't come apart on its way up.
It will experience about three
million pounds of thrust with
blast-off. Unimaginable vibra
tions will overwhelm the cargo
bay along with around 150 de
cibels of sound and extreme
temperature variations. Access
is needed to sophisticated testing
facilities, extensive computer
networks and experts in the roc
ket field.
Help in the form of funds,
equipment and information is
being sought from outside com
panies. Lockheed has made a
I commitment.
