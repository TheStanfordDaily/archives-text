# Merit of Stanley Kaplan review courses for exams disputed
## 
### BRUCE FINLEY 
Complete preparation for the
Law School Aptitude Test
(LSAT), Medical College Ap
titude Test (MCAT), Graduate
Record Examination (GRE) and
other well-known examinations
involves, increasingly often, a
Stanley Kaplan review course.
Kaplan courses involve eight to
12 weeks of lectures, listening to
cassette tapes, and topical review
homework, all designed to en
hance a student's knowledge in
the area in which he will be
tested. For around $325 per
course, Kaplan centers through
out the nation claim to provide
"a very thorough review of fun
damental concepts."
For anxious students con
cerned about future study oppor
tunities, the presence of
Kaplan-type courses increases
the financial burden and the time
commitment involved in taking
assorted tests. Christopher

Shinkman, Director of the
Career Planning and Placement

"I find it very distressing. They

pointed out that test scores
"shouldn't get over

"don't make or break whether

She cautioned students "not to

Shinkman stressed that there are
no good statistics. "There was a

said, but "the study was not

Bill Sneed, a senior here who

emphasis is placed on the test
scores."
The decision whether or not to
take a Kaplan review course will
remain difficult until there is
statistical evidence of their
merit. Regarding the effective
ness of Kaplan-type courses,
Shinkman stressed that there are
no good statistics. "There was a
study attempted by a U.S. gov
ernment agency," Shinkman
said, but "the study was not
well-designed. So the results
were inconclusive."
Bill Sneed, a senior here who
scored high on the LSAT exami
nation without the aid of Kaplan
review, sees the courses as confi
dence builders. "I think if you
don't have any confidence in
yourself these are fine," Sneed
said.
The Educational Testing Ser
vice defines aptitude as "de
veloped ability." The Kaplan
business enthusiastically claims
to "develop students' abilities."
In a society where test scores are
a key to opportunity, both enter
prises Rourish.
