## Women win tourney 
### LIBBY LEONARD 
The Stanford women's
basketball team baked its op
ponents and won the USF
Sourdough Invitational this
weekend, allowing its record
to rise to 10-6.
In Friday's opening round,
the Card set back an impa
tient Nebraska squad, 81-70.
Both teams exchanged quick
baskets in the first half, but
later Stanford put a throttle
on Nebraska's run-and-gun
offense.

"Nebraska shot itself out of
the game," said Cardinal
coach Dotty McCrea.
After the Card switched
the game's tempo in the third
quarter, Nebraska could not
change gears or execute well
in a disciplined style of play.
"We decided to slow down
and set up, which worked in
our favor," said McCrea.
Post players Meg Metzger
and Jeanne Ruark-Hoff re
sponded by fueling the Card
with 24 and 21 points respec

lively. Senior Kim Kupferer,
a 6-foot-1 center, added 12
points and eight rebounds.
Kupferer recently regained
her starting position, after
nursing a knee injury most of
last season.
Angie Paccione and Vir
ginia Sourlis, who foim the
Card's backcourt duo, are
playing in better harmony
with the other starters.
Against Nebraska, Paccione
spotted her open teammates
and tallied 10 assists.
"You can see the guards
and forwards working to
gether," said McCrea. Pac
cione and Sourlis "are read
ing the other players and rec
ognizing defensive changes,"
the coach added.
The Card sought revenge
against USF in Saturday's
championship game and
upset the tournament's host
team 74-58. Last month, USF
surprised Stanford with a
two-point victory.
McCrea said her players
"have a lot of pride, and they
were determined not to lose
to USF again." From the
opening tipoff, Stanford
played with intensity and
dominated the backboards,
building a 35-28 halftime ad
vantage. Although the Card
pushed the ball up the floor, it
usually retreated and ran a
patient half-court offense.
Careful shot selection al
lowed the Card to shoot a re
spectable 55 percent from the
field.
McCrea told her team "to
keep the ball out of the (USF)
point guard's hands." The de
fensive strategy worked.
Without the help of its top
ballhandler, USF had trouble
initiating any type of scoring
threat.

team. Metzger's outstanding
two-day performance, which
included 49 total points,
earned her MVP honors.
