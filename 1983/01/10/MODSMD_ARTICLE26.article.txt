EYEING NO. 10: Stanford guard Steve Brown played a crucial role in the slow-tempo offense
the Cardinal utilized in its first conference and 10th overall victory of the season Saturday night
at the University of Oregon. Brown led the Card in minutes played in the 80-74 win.
Evervone took advantage of the
Ducks' defensive letdowns, un
like Thursday night when Revelli
scored 28 and no other Cardinal
had more than six points.
This time, Revelli again led the
way with 20 points, but five team
mates had eight or more. For
wards Hans Wicharv and Earl
Koberlein had season highs of 14
and 13 points respectively.
Oregon, which had begun to
attain some respectability with its
third place finish in the Far West
Classic in late December, due in
large part to its defensive efforts,
committed a cardinal sin on de

fense; they simply failed to deny
the baseline. When giving up the
baseline, there is no one to help
backside, so the result is usually a
lay-up.
Stanford capitalized on this
blatant betrayal of fundamentals
to drive the baseline over and
over again for easy baskets in
side. The main opportunist was
Cardinal center John Revelli,
who completed a phenomenal
weekend bv scoring 20 points on
eight-of-10 shooting.
Oregon coach Jim Haney,
whose team is now 5-6 overall
and 1-1 in the conference, was
puzzled as to why the break

downs on defense occurred. "De
fense is the reason we lost tonight
and also the reason we had won
five games," he said. "The break
downs simply came at the end of
the court where we have shown
we can play well."
Revelli was nine-of-nine
against OSU to make him 17-
of-19 from the field for 48 points
in the two games. His most im
portant basket came with 7:12 re
maining after the Ducks had
clawed their way back in the
game with a five-point streak and
had closed to within three points,
the smallest deficit they had faced
since the opening minutes.
The Cardinal led 63-55 with
9:25 left to play when Oregon
guard Gary Gatewood, who led
the Ducks with 23 points, re

taliated with night-foot jump
shot on a fast to bring Ore
gon to within i'
After Wicl r was called for
an offensive uf° r throwing an
elbow, UG aptain David
Brantley mi P'av which
brought the Court
crowd to its 112 ;tßrantlev took a
pass from gu; (Paul Bain in the
open court ar cove one-on-one
on Revelli, s oting a running
jump shot fr Tinside the key.
Revelli bumpld3rantley to pick
up his fourtWprsonal foul and
when the ball riled around the
rim and fell *1 the 5960 Duck
fans went intp frenzy. After a
Stanford timJpl, Brantley com
pleted the twf-point play to
bring UO to winin 63-60.

Revelli then took matters into
his own hands. The next trip
down the court, the six-foot-eight
junior took a pass at the choke
post and bulled down the left side
of the key to score on Oregon's
seven-foot center, Blair
Rasmussen.
"Revelli's leadership was ob
vious down the stretch," sadi
Davis. "That was the tvpe of play
that leaders make. He just took it
in there and stuck it in."
Stanford continued to run its
patient vet potent offense which
it had been doing since the 12
minute mark, forcing the Ducks
to spread out their man-to-man
defense and leaving gaping holes
up the middle.
Guard Keith Jones was the

first to exploit this strategy. After
Bain missed his First shot after he
had hit on four consecutive long
range jumpers, Jones find a crack
and took Bain down the middle
for a lav-in to put Stanford up by
seven with 5:52 to play.
"We were playing for the un
contested lay-in," said Jones,
who finished with 10 points.
"They were trying to deny, every
pass, playing one-on-one. But it's
hard to cover one-on-one with a
whole court to work with."
A critical Duck turnover fol
lowed. Jerrv Adams grabbed the
ball after Jones' bucket and on
the inbounds pass, threw the ball
off the back of the Card's basket.
Jones scored off the inbounds
plav, putting down a short

jumper from the right side.
Then it was Keith Ramee's
turn to play Phil Ford. Ramee ex
ploded down the lane and made a
lav-in for the last of eight straight
Cardinal points, making the
score 71-60 with 3:46 remaining
and disposing any Duck come
back aspirations.
UO closed to within five at
73-68 with 2:06 left, but two more
Ramee penetrations off the circle
offense for lav-ins kept the Ducks
at bay.
"We just had to open our of
fense wider," Ramee said. "They
had to come out and play us and
it left holes for good shots. They
played defense pretty well, but
time was running out on them.
We just couldn't panic."

EYEING NO. 10: Stanford guard Steve Brown played a crucial role in the slow-tempo offense
the Cardinal utilized in its first conference and 10th overall victory of the season Saturday night
at the University of Oregon. Brown led the Card in minutes played in the 80-74 win.
Evervone took advantage of the
Ducks' defensive letdowns, un
like Thursday night when Revelli
scored 28 and no other Cardinal
had more than six points.
This time, Revelli again led the
way with 20 points, but five team
mates had eight or more. For
wards Hans Wicharv and Earl
Koberlein had season highs of 14
and 13 points respectively.
Oregon, which had begun to
attain some respectability with its
third place finish in the Far West
Classic in late December, due in
large part to its defensive efforts,
committed a cardinal sin on de

fense; they simply failed to deny
the baseline. When giving up the
baseline, there is no one to help
backside, so the result is usually a
lay-up.
Stanford capitalized on this
blatant betrayal of fundamentals
to drive the baseline over and
over again for easy baskets in
side. The main opportunist was
Cardinal center John Revelli,
who completed a phenomenal
weekend bv scoring 20 points on
eight-of-10 shooting.
Oregon coach Jim Haney,
whose team is now 5-6 overall
and 1-1 in the conference, was
puzzled as to why the break

downs on defense occurred. "De
fense is the reason we lost tonight
and also the reason we had won
five games," he said. "The break
downs simply came at the end of
the court where we have shown
we can play well."
Revelli was nine-of-nine
against OSU to make him 17-
of-19 from the field for 48 points
in the two games. His most im
portant basket came with 7:12 re
maining after the Ducks had
clawed their way back in the
game with a five-point streak and
had closed to within three points,
the smallest deficit they had faced
since the opening minutes.
The Cardinal led 63-55 with
9:25 left to play when Oregon
guard Gary Gatewood, who led
the Ducks with 23 points, re

taliated with night-foot jump
shot on a fast to bring Ore
gon to within i'
After Wicl r was called for
an offensive uf° r throwing an
elbow, UG aptain David
Brantley mi P'av which
brought the Court
crowd to its 112 ;tßrantlev took a
pass from gu; (Paul Bain in the
open court ar cove one-on-one
on Revelli, s oting a running
jump shot fr Tinside the key.
Revelli bumpld3rantley to pick
up his fourtWprsonal foul and
when the ball riled around the
rim and fell *1 the 5960 Duck
fans went intp frenzy. After a
Stanford timJpl, Brantley com
pleted the twf-point play to
bring UO to winin 63-60.

Revelli then took matters into
his own hands. The next trip
down the court, the six-foot-eight
junior took a pass at the choke
post and bulled down the left side
of the key to score on Oregon's
seven-foot center, Blair
Rasmussen.
"Revelli's leadership was ob
vious down the stretch," sadi
Davis. "That was the tvpe of play
that leaders make. He just took it
in there and stuck it in."
Stanford continued to run its
patient vet potent offense which
it had been doing since the 12
minute mark, forcing the Ducks
to spread out their man-to-man
defense and leaving gaping holes
up the middle.
Guard Keith Jones was the

first to exploit this strategy. After
Bain missed his First shot after he
had hit on four consecutive long
range jumpers, Jones find a crack
and took Bain down the middle
for a lav-in to put Stanford up by
seven with 5:52 to play.
"We were playing for the un
contested lay-in," said Jones,
who finished with 10 points.
"They were trying to deny, every
pass, playing one-on-one. But it's
hard to cover one-on-one with a
whole court to work with."
A critical Duck turnover fol
lowed. Jerrv Adams grabbed the
ball after Jones' bucket and on
the inbounds pass, threw the ball
off the back of the Card's basket.
Jones scored off the inbounds
plav, putting down a short

jumper from the right side.
Then it was Keith Ramee's
turn to play Phil Ford. Ramee ex
ploded down the lane and made a
lav-in for the last of eight straight
Cardinal points, making the
score 71-60 with 3:46 remaining
and disposing any Duck come
back aspirations.
UO closed to within five at
73-68 with 2:06 left, but two more
Ramee penetrations off the circle
offense for lav-ins kept the Ducks
at bay.
"We just had to open our of
fense wider," Ramee said. "They
had to come out and play us and
it left holes for good shots. They
played defense pretty well, but
time was running out on them.
We just couldn't panic."
