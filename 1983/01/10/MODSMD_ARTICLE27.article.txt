# Wrestlers host ASU
## 
### 
A "slightly weakened" Stan
ford team will host the confer
ence's top wrestling squad,
Arizona State, tonight, but Car
dinal coach Chris Horpel thinks
Stanford will match up fairly well
at 7 p.m. in Maples Pavilion.
"Realistically, we don't expect
to win the match," Horpel said,
"but I think we match up fairly
well in some weights. I think we
match up better than we did
against Oregon State so we
should do better than we did
against (the Beavers) even
though Arizona State is a much
stronger squad."
Stanford is hot off consecutive
dual victories over Simon Fraser
of British Columbia Wednesday
and a 28-18 win over Sac
ramento State Friday.
Friday, Stanford picked up
wins from freshman Bert
Fukunaga at 118 pounds,
freshman Scott Wiggin at 142,
who recorded his first fall,
freshman Pete Rogers at 150,
co-captain Tom Mullen at 167,
co-captain Doug Perkins at 190,
who recorded his fourth fall of
the season, and heavyweight
Flint Pulskamp, who picked up a
pin in his first match of the sea
son.
Pulskamp, who is a 190 pound
back-up to Perkins, moved into
the heavyweight spot when Ed

Katz became ill. Pulskamp will
stay in the line-up for tonight's
match against the Sun Devils.
"Although Pulskamp is really
a second-string 190 pounder,
I'm moving him into the
heavyweight spot because he re
ally is a competent wrestler."
Horpel is not sure how his
team will wrestle because he
does not know ASU's line-up.
Stanford will have Fukunaga
at 118, Bill George at 126 replac
ing Neil Wartnik who is out with
a hurt shoulder, Jeff Bradley at
134, Wiggin at 142, Rogers at
150, Jeff Hazard at 158, Karl
Bazin at 167 replacing Mullen,
who is being moved up to 177,
Perkins at 190 and Pulskamp at
heavyweight.
Horpel said Stanford's
chances rest on Wiggin, who de
spite an earlier loss to Adam
Q>hen may be able to come back
with a win, Mullen, Perkins and
Pulskamp.
All Cardinal wrestlers except
Bazon, Mullen, Perkins and
Pulskamp are freshmen.
Horpel said he is fairly confi
dent at those spots, but "every
body else I just don't know
enough about their wrestlers."


STAY DOWN: Stanford's Bert Fukunaga lies pressure to
a Simon-Fraser opponent last week. Ai Us pounds,
Fukunaga will open tonight's dual agaiDsi highly-touted
Arizona State.


LEGGING IT: Stanford's Jeff Bradley tries to tie up the legs of
a Simon-Fraser opponent last week. Bradley, a 134 pounder,
