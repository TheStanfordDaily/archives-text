Laxalt torsees defense reduction
Washington — President Reagan's closest ally in Congress predicted yes
terday that Reagan will tackle the prospect of ever higher federal deficits by
agreeing to slow defense spending now and endorsing a contingency plan for
increasing taxes after 1984.
Sen. Paul Laxalt (R-Nev.) said he feels that Reagan has adopted "a wholly
different perspective" on fiscal problems confronting his administration as a
result of candid meetings in the last week with his economic advisers and
Republicans from the House and Senate.
"He recognizes unless something bold and decisive is done, that we're
going to have a terribly difficult couple of years in every way," Laxalt said on
"This Week With David Brinkley."
Asked if he thinks the president will move in directions being urged on him
bv senior Republicans, Laxalt added: "I think he's going to move. I predict
that he will."
Laxalt advocated an economic game plan that would trigger higher taxes
in the years ahead if they should be needed to overcome recurring annual
deficits of $200 million to $300 billion, a prospect that he has described as "a
little terrifying."
The budget deficit for fiscal 1984 is expected to exceed $200 billion. Last
week, the president was told that, without further action, this would rise to
$288 billion by 1988.
Laxalt, soon to become general chairman of the Republican National
Committee, said he would not favor higher taxes now, a step that Reagan
seemed virtually to have ruled out when he described it last Wednesday as
"the wrong thing to do when you're coming out of a recession."
The senator said, however, that business and financial markets need as
surances that something will be done to head off even higher "out-year defi
cits" in case the economy does not improve sufficiently. Without such as
surances. Laxalt suggested, interest rates never will come down to reason
able levels.
Thatcher visits Falkland*
Stanley, Falkland Islands — Hundreds of tearful islanders cheered and
mobbed British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher yesterday as she began a
surprise tour of this disputed South Atlantic colony, wrested back from Ar
gentina seven months ago.
While Thatcher toured Stanley's fortified airfield and visited British
troops, Argentina denounced her visit as a brazen provocation. In London,
Thatcher's opposition accused her of playing politics with the surprise tour.
No advance announcement was made of the visit.
The first prime minister to visit the Falklands in 150 years of British rule
arrived Saturday night after an 8000-mile, 24-hour trip from London.
