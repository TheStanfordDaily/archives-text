Laxalt torsees defense reduction
Washington — President Reagan's closest ally in Congress predicted yes
terday that Reagan will tackle the prospect of ever higher federal deficits by
agreeing to slow defense spending now and endorsing a contingency plan for
increasing taxes after 1984.
Sen. Paul Laxalt (R-Nev.) said he feels that Reagan has adopted "a wholly
different perspective" on fiscal problems confronting his administration as a
result of candid meetings in the last week with his economic advisers and
Republicans from the House and Senate.
"He recognizes unless something bold and decisive is done, that we're
going to have a terribly difficult couple of years in every way," Laxalt said on
"This Week With David Brinkley."
Asked if he thinks the president will move in directions being urged on him
bv senior Republicans, Laxalt added: "I think he's going to move. I predict
that he will."
Laxalt advocated an economic game plan that would trigger higher taxes
in the years ahead if they should be needed to overcome recurring annual
deficits of $200 million to $300 billion, a prospect that he has described as "a
little terrifying."
The budget deficit for fiscal 1984 is expected to exceed $200 billion. Last
week, the president was told that, without further action, this would rise to
$288 billion by 1988.
Laxalt, soon to become general chairman of the Republican National
Committee, said he would not favor higher taxes now, a step that Reagan
seemed virtually to have ruled out when he described it last Wednesday as
"the wrong thing to do when you're coming out of a recession."
The senator said, however, that business and financial markets need as
surances that something will be done to head off even higher "out-year defi
cits" in case the economy does not improve sufficiently. Without such as
surances. Laxalt suggested, interest rates never will come down to reason
able levels.
Thatcher visits Falkland*
Stanley, Falkland Islands — Hundreds of tearful islanders cheered and
mobbed British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher yesterday as she began a
surprise tour of this disputed South Atlantic colony, wrested back from Ar
gentina seven months ago.
While Thatcher toured Stanley's fortified airfield and visited British
troops, Argentina denounced her visit as a brazen provocation. In London,
Thatcher's opposition accused her of playing politics with the surprise tour.
No advance announcement was made of the visit.
The first prime minister to visit the Falklands in 150 years of British rule
arrived Saturday night after an 8000-mile, 24-hour trip from London.
The final leg was a perilous 13-hour flight from
Ascension island in the mid-Atlantic aboard an unarmed
Royal Air Force C-130 Hercules, a lumbering propeller
driven cargo plane refueled three times in flight. It was
escorted into Port Stanley by Phantom fighters.
Emerging from the transport in skirt, dark overcoat
and pink scarf, she declared: "I've come to talk to the
people here, to support the armed forces and to pay trib
ute to those who liberated the islands."
Argentina seized the Falklands last April 2 after a pro
tracted sovereignty dispute. Britain regained the
lalklands, called Las Malvinas by Argentina, last June
14 after a war that left 255 Britons and 712 Argentines
dead.
Word of Thatcher's arrival in Stanley, reported in a
news flash on the local radio station, spread quickly
among the population of 1800 islanders and 3500 British
servicemen.
Hundreds of well-wishers greeted her as she rode, with
her husband Denis, into town in the converted London
taxi used as an official car by civil administrator Sir Rex
Hunt. Soldiers along the route snapped to attention,
while residents, many with tears in their eyes, shouted:
"God bless you."
Salvadoran colonel defies gov't
Sensuntepeque, El Salvador — Rebel Col. Sigifredo
Ochoa Perez emerged from a five-hour meeting with five
other military commanders yesterday and declared,
"They'll only make me leave Cabanas dead."
Ochoa, who commands 900 soldiers in northern
Cabanas province, had rejected a transfer to the
Salvadoran Embassy in Uruguay last week and de
manded the resignation of the defense minister, Gen. Jose
Guillermo Garcia.
Ochoa told a cheering crowd of about 2500 people in
the provincial capital of Sensuntepeque, "We have made
a proposal.... We hope that the minister of defense and
the high command understand that we want justice." He
did not elaborate on the proposal.
In the national capital of San Salvadoi, Gen. Garcia
told reporters, "I have the support of the commanders
and I'm staying here."
Garcia met throughout the day with the directors of
the national and treasury police and military comman
ders at the chiefs of staff headquarters.
Ochoa said the five officers who visited him were an of
ficial negotiating body and that they had returned to San
Salvador.
He indicated that he had dropped his demand that
Garcia, who is considered a moderate in the right-wing
government, resign.
Ochoa said that if allowed, he would stay in Cabanas
and continue fighting leftist guerrillas even if Garcia re
mained in office. "I accept that we have committed a mili
tary offense but... they obliged us into this position," he
said. "We are not guilty."
Gen. Eugenio Vides Casanova, the national guard
commander and one of the five military chiefs who met
with Ochoa, told reporters in Sensuntepeque, "We did
not come to pressure (Ochoa) in any sense. We are look
ing for a solution that would be for the benefit of the
country and the armed forces."
He indicated that a decision ending the three-day-old
standoff would take more time. "The best solutions occur
when they are more discussed," he said.
Addressing the crowd, Vides Casanova said, "No one
has considered taking military action against this
glorious town." He said he and the others came to Sensu
tepeque with a "counter-proposal" to conditions set by
Ochoa.
Deukmejian offers balanced budget
Sacramento — Gov. Deukmejian's plan to solve Cali
fornia's fiscal crisis will be sent to the Legislature today,
and Deukmejian has promised a budget balanced
without tax increases.
"The proposal that will be put forth by the governor is

a balanced budget that will not require a tax increase,"
Deukmejian press secretary Larry Thomas told reporters
in a briefing last week on the' Republican governor's first
cabinet meeting.
"He does not want to see an increase in the tax burden
on Californians. That's where he starts from. That's the
philosophical framework," Thomas added.
The budget Deukmejian has drafted is expected to
combine a wide assortment of program cuts and a stingy
cap on cost-of-living increases with a plan to "roll over"
into the new fiscal year a substantial part of the estimated
$1.6 billion deficit in the state's current $25 billion
budget.
But it is uncertain whether such a plan will be received
bv legislators as a realistic solution to the state's budget
crisis, or just Deukmejian's starting position in nego
tiations over a tax increase.
In his campaign for governor last year, Deukmejian
said repeatedly that he could balance the state budget
without a tax increase bv cutting spending.
But Deukmejian stopped short of an absolute promise,
and the deficit he inherited last week from former Gov.
Jerry Brown is nearly double the deficit estimated during
much of the campaign.
Similarly, he stressed spending cuts in his inaugural ad
dress last Monday. But he added the phrase no "net tax
increase," stirring speculation that he might com
promise.
The most controversial portion of the kind of budget
package Deukmejian is expected to offer will be the pro
posal to carrv over part of the deficit of the current fiscal
year, which ends June 30, into the 1983-84 fiscal year.
Such a year-end deficit — even with a plan for repay
ment — puts a cloud over the credit-worthiness of the
state. If that cloud is dark enough to trigger a down
grading of the state's bond rating, it could cost taxpayers
millions more annually for decades in extra interest
charges on state bonds.
Lebanon re-enforces cease-fire
Beirut, Lebanon — Government security police cruised
embattled slums in the north city of Tripoli yesterday in a
new effort to enforce a cease-fire between warring pro-
Syrian and anti-Svrian Moslem militias, state radio re
ported.
In Israel, the government blamed a grenade attack in
downtown Tel Aviv on what it called Palestinian ter
rorists bent on sabotaging Israeli-Lebanese talks on with
drawal of all foreign armies from Lebanon. The talks re
sume today in the Beirut suburb of Khalde.
Lebanon state radio said the first patrol of the para
military security force entered Tripoli's slum neighbor
hood of Kubbeh in the late afternoon and reinforcements
were expected to follow later.
The police were deployed after Hisham Shaar, chief of
Lebanon's internal security forces, met in Tripoli with
Syria's deputy chief of staff, Brig. Gen. Ali Asian, and
said militiamen agreed to get off the streets by sundown.
Earlier, state and privately owned radios reported spo
radic shooting could still be heard in the two slum neigh
borhoods. But they said the intensity of the fighting
lessened markedly after Shaar's announcement.
The independent Lebanese newspaper An-Nahar said
five people died and several others were wounded in fight
ing Saturday, bringing the death toll in seven weeks of
warfare to 213, with more than 600 wounded.
A decision to deploy Lebanese security forces was ap
proved Saturday in the Syrian capital of Damascus after
a meeting there between Lebanese Prime Minister Shafik
Wazzan and Syrian President Hafez Assad. Syria main
tains an estimated 25.(XX) to 30,000 troops in Lebanon
serving as a peacekeeping force under a 1976 Arab
League mandate to police Lebanon's civil war armistice.
Mubarak endorses Reagan plan
Cairo, Egypt — President Hosni Mubarak said yester
day he hopes the Arabs make peace with Israel based on
President Reagan's formula sometime this year, before
the U.S. presidential campaign complicates the nego

| lating process.
In an interview with The Associated Press, he urged
I lordanian King Hussein and Palestine Liberation Or
| ionization leader Yasser Arafat to quickly "negotiate
| ind come to conclusions" on the plan Reagan proposed
I ast Sept. 1. It calls for Palestinian self-rule in association
| wth Jordan for the Israeli occupied territories of the
Vest Bank of the Jordan River and Gaza Strip.
The Israelis are building at a very quick tempo so
nanv settlements in the West Bank and Gaza," Mubarak
aid in an office at the Uruba palace.
II we are going to lose another year with just deliver
ing statements without anv activity so as to put the Rea
| jan initiative into action, it will be a big loss and the prob
em will be more difficult to solve."
The Israelis oppose the Reagan plan, saying it would
cad to a hostile Palestinian state and threaten Israeli se
jurity. They also reject a portion of the plan calling for an
immediate freeze on Jewish settlements in the territories
Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East War.
Most Arab states reject the plan because it calls for a
Palestinian association with Jordan rather than an inde
pendent state. Egypt, the only Arab nation with relations
with Israel, supports the plan as an outline subject to ne
gotiation.
Mubarak said "it will be very difficult for Reagan to
implement his initiative" once the campaign for the 1984
U.S. presidential election begins.
"So I am urging those who are looking for a com
prehensive settlement, those who want peace in this area,
the factions concerned, to make the best use of this specif
ic period of time so as to negotiate and to come to con
clusions maximum within six months or one year," he
said.
Reagan to institute farm aid
Dallas — A farm-aid measure first used during the
Great Depression will be reinstated here Tuesday when
President Reagan tells farmers that they can have surplus
government grain and cotton if they agree to let some of
their fields lie fallow this year.
Known as the "pavment-in-kind" program or PI K, the
program is designed to reduce the nation's record sup
plies of wheat, rice and corn and near-record supply of
cotton. At the same time it would aid financially strapped
farmers, who are facing their fourth consecutive year of
reduced income, by lowering production costs.
The program could also save the federal government
billions of dollars normally spent on farm loans and
purchases of surplus commodities.
Officials of the American Farm Bureau Federation
said they expect to learn details of the plan, which has
been under discussion for weeks in Washington, when
Reagan addresses the group's annual meeting here.
Reagan will apparently use his executive authority to
implement the program, bypassing Congress, which
failed to approve aspects of the plan during last month's
lame-duck session.
The PIK program is the latest in a series of adminis
tration measures aimed at reviving a farm economy that
is deteriorating and placating a farm population that is
showing signs of impatience and militancy. In recent
weeks farm foreclosure sales have sparked angry and
sometimes violent demonstrations. Farmers have dis
rupted sales in Illinois, Minnesota, Ohio and Colorado,
the first outbreak of such rebellions since the Great De
pression.
A recent report from the Department of Agriculture
indicates that five out of every 100 farmers in the United
States will be financially vulnerable this year, and that
many of them will not survive.
Multinational tax status reviewed
Washington — A long-running battle over whether
multinational corporations can avoid paying state in
come taxes shifts to the Supreme Court today in a case
that could cost financially pressed states hundreds of mil
lions of dollars.
The suit involves technical economic arguments, and

the stakes have been high enough to attract more than
two dozen friend-of-the-court briefs from the National
Governors Association and Consumer Federation of
America on one side to Sonv Corp., Coca-Cola, Gulf Oil
Corp. and Firestone Tire & Rubber Co. on the other.
Lawyers will debate Monday whether the Container
Corp. of America must pav California about $75,000 in
disputed income taxes from 1963 to 1965.
But the larger issue is California's controversial "uni
tary" method of collecting corporate income taxes, used
in some form by 22 other states. Rather than examining
how much money a company claims to make in the state, *
the unitary method in its broadest form looks at the
firm's worldwide business activities and estimates what
proportion of profits should be subject to state taxes.
Many corporations insist that this formula is unfair,
and that they should not have to pay state taxes on in
come earned by foreign subsidiaries. But North Dakota
tax commissioner Kent Conrad responded that "some
corporations don't want to pay any taxes and look for ev
ery dodge, every loophole, every method to get an edge.
"It's just an accounting shell game," he said. "One of.
the things you learn in business school is to put your prof
its where there's the least tax burden. If you're a major
multinational company, you can show your profits in a
foreign country that has the least tax liability."
Attorney Franklin Latcham, who has been represent
ing Container Corp. in the case for 14 years, said Califor
nia's approach is unconstitutional. "California is taxing
income earned in foreign countries," he said. "The meth
od inevitably results in double taxation, by California
and bv the foreign countries involved. Every multi
national in the world is vitally interested in this case."
Zimbabwe welcomers trample five
Harare, Zimbabwe — Five thousand screaming Zim
babweans waiting to welcome Chinese Premier Zhao
Zivang stampeded through an airport gate yesterday,
trampling five women to death and injuring 64 other peo
ple.
Police said scores of others fainted in the crush, caused
after security officers opened the gate to the airport
tarmac about an hour before Zhao's entourage arrived
for an official three-day visit.
China was a main supporter of the black African strug
gle to rule Zimbabwe, the former white-ruled British co
lony of Rhodesia. The nation's state-run press had urged
people to greet Zhao at the airport.
"People were stamping on each other and pushing to
get through the gate and I could see people being
squashed on the ground," an witness told the Zimbabwe
Inter-African News Agency.
"It was like a carnage without blood," one airport se
curity officer said. "People were screaming and moaning
and sobbing. It was horrible."
Ambulances careened to the scene, sirens wailing, to
ferry the dead to mortuaries and the injured to hospitals.
Neither Zhao nor Prime Minister Robert Mugabe,
who arrived shortly before Zhao's plane touched down,
witnessed the tragedy. Police brought the crowd under
control by the time official welcoming ceremonies began.
. Mugabe was told of the deaths by aides after the formal
welcome, a government sources told The Associated
Press.
The government-controlled yeskerday Mail newspaper
had urged Zimbabweans "to give comrade Zhao a warm
and rousing welcome" at Harare international airport,
eight miles from the center of the capital.
Two of the injured, one a young girl, were admitted for
treatment at Parirenyatwa hospital, acting medical super
intendent Doreen Shennan said in a telephone interview.
Most of the others were treated for minor injuries and
discharged.
Today's weather
