# Roble tells whale of tale
## 
### LISA LYNCH Staff writer 
Roble residents who planned to ven
ture out on the briny deep to watch
whales last Saturday, were not only
disappointed to miss the mammalian
denizens of the waters off the Half
Moon Bay coast, but couldn't even find
the fishing company they had chartered
to take them out.
The Pillar Point Fishing Trips Com
pany failed to inform the leaders of the
crew of 49, who paid $15 per head to
go, that it went bankrupt last month.
"Tve been planning this trip since
October," said organizer Megan Ches
nut, a Roble resident assistant. A $100
deposit check was mailed to the com
pany well before it went bankrupt, but
the balance — $622 — was paid by
check on Dec. 29.
"Hopefully, the check arrived after

the company went bankrupt, and the
money will be easy to recover," Ches
nut said.
The Pillar Point Fishing Trips com
pany was listed in the Residential Edu
cation programming booklet.
Elizabeth Hiyama, administrative di
rector at Res Ed, said that she was not
sure whether other dorms had char
tered Pillar Point for whale watching.
"I imagine we'll send out a warning
notice, telling students what has hap
pened and suggesting how they might
reclaim their money," Hiyama said.
Reclaiming the money may prove a
whale of a task for Chesnut and the
Roble residents, however. The har
bormaster's office in Half Moon Bay
advised Chesnut that she should try to
recover the money in bankruptcy
court.
