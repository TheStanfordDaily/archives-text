# COCE members face bias charges
## 
### KAREN SPRINGEN 
Two members of the Committee on
Contemporary Entertainment
(COCE), a staff and student group
which approves campus concerts, have
been accused of conflict of interest.
One, Vinnie Freda, chairman of the
board of the Concert Network and fi
nancial manager of the Chaparral, has
already resigned. The other is Bob
Brody, ASSU student financial man
ager.
The charges came in a letter from
KZSU radio station members to
COCE Chairman Thom Massey, as
sociate dean of student affairs and head
of the KZSU board. It asked for a re
view of COCE procedures and con
flicts of interest, according to Andy
Midler, KZSU financial manager.
The KZSU letter also questioned
COCE lack of standardization and the
ethics of having members associated
with the Concert Network, according
to Jim Mooney, station manager.
(The Concert Network, which con
sists of the Chaparral, the ASSU, the
Leland Stanford Junior Marching
Band — LSJUMB — and the Student
Alumni Network — STAN — formed
this fall to co-promote concerts as a
group.)
Freda resigned from his post as
COCE intern in December. "My con
flicts of interest were just getting to be
too much," he said. "The entire COCE
agreed that my association with the
Concert Network made it look like I
was getting preferential treatment," he
added.
Brody has countered, "I don't feel I
have any conflict of interest . . . My
dealings with the Concert Network
were only at the very beginning."
Concert negotiator Vicky Holt, di
rector of events and services, said,
" Brody'a relationship with the commit
| tee was much -more detached (than
Freda's)."
Also as a resul t of conflict of interest,
Council of Presidents (COP) member
Cynthia Matthewson, a member of the
Concert Network, had COP member
Mark Epstein replace her on the
COCE.
Brody said, "KZSU is screaming
about conflicts of interest . . . when
• there own chair is on the committee."
Holt also denied conflict of interest
charges. "When you're putting to
gether a committee, you have to have
the people who are involved."
This Thursday, the COCE is meeting
to streamline procedures and to inves
tigate whether members have excessive
conflicts of interest.
According to Ellie Oppenheim, di
rector of Tresidder Union and a COCE
member, the COCE will discuss the
role of interns and the relationship be
tween the committee and other organi
zations on campus. "I would like very
much to have a clear set of written

standards," Oppenheim said.
"The COCE has been very inconsis
tent," Midler said. KZSU first submit
ted a proposal last April at which time
the COCE asked that the student radio
station get approval from its board and
resubmit its proposal in early fall. The
COCE then rejected the proposal for a
second time, asking for more financial
data.
Mooney said, "They (the COCE)
don't like us."
Because KZSU suffered a "substan
tial" deficit last year, the station is look
ing for new sources of revenue such as
concert-promoting. "It (a concert)
could mean an extra $5000," Midler
said, referring to the Chaparral's lucra
tive promotion of the Grateful Dead.
Holt said the COCE needed more
current information in order to ap
prove the KZSU proposal. "There
were (financial) questions raised about
the application," she said.
KZSU has a $32,000 budget this
year, Mooney said.
Fee assessment revenue has de
creased while costs have increased.
KZSU receives about 65 percent of its
budget from fee assessments, 15 per
cent from broadcast fees and about 20
percent from underwriters.
The COCE passed the preliminary
proposal for concerts to be co
promoted by the senior class presidents
and the Concert Network. Tlie COCE
has approved a concert to be promoted
by Hillel. Hillel, gearing up for a celeb
ration of Israeli Independence Day, is
working on a specific show for the end
of March in Memorial Auditorium.
Luke Cole, co-chairman of the Delta
Upsilon concert committee which co
promoted the Oct. 24 Kenny Loggins
( concert, said, "The Concert NetworV
as a whole has been a conflict of in
terest from the start, as it's a near
monopoly situation for the members
involved. ... As members of the inner
circle of the COCE they (the ASSU
and the Chaparral) obviously know
how to tailor their proposals to the
satisfaction of the committees."
Ben Wilson, the other DU co
chairman, agreed with conflict of in
terest charges. "Vinnie's (Chaparral)
concert went through really easily and
smoothly," he said.
The COCE will not discuss a poten
tial DU summer concert series until the
DUs turn in a balance sheet for the
Loggins concert. "They don't want one
group putting on that many concerts.
They don't want it to be an open mar
ket. . . . They think that somebody
would dominate the market," Wilson
said, adding, "We made money and
they know that."
