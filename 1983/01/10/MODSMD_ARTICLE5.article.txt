# Research could lead to gonorrhea vaccine
## 
### DAVID SANCHEZ Staff writer 
â€¢ Researchers at the Medical Microbiology Depart
ment here are conducting research thai may someday
lead to a vaccine for gonorrhea.
Microbiologist Stanley Falkow and graduate stu
dent J. Michael Koomey have, for the first time,
discovered a way to test an enzyme long suspected to
be a weapon the gonococcus bacteria u<e to produce
gonorrhea. According to Falkow, knowledge about
the enzyme may lead to a vaccine or a similar com
batant against the disease.
"We are trying to identify the role ot the protease
(the enzyme)," said Falkow. "And if it appears to
play an essential role in pathogenic infection, poten
tially people who are in the vaccine development line
might want to incorporate the protein as part of the
vaccine."

"At this point all of the data suggest that it playsan
important role in infection," added Falkow. "Logic
dictates that it destroys local antibodies."
Falkow could not, however, give an estimate as to
when a gonorrhea vaccine might be forthcoming. He
explained that the Medical Microbiology Depart
ment is primarily a basic science department and that
it is not involved in creating vaccines.
"My interest is at the basic science level,"
explained Koomey, who began research on the bac
teria three years ago. "Once it is established that (the
enzyme) is important . .. then other people could
work with it (to develop a vacine)."
Koomey has identified the gene that is responsible
for informing the bacteria how and when to produce
the enzyme called " IgA 1 protease." By using genetic
engineering techniques, he has been able toeliminate
that single gene from the bacteria, creating an or

ganism that is almost identical to gonococcus, except
that it cannot produce the crucial enzyme. This en
zyme, according to Falkow, acts as a chemical cleaver
that snips in two certain antibodies the human body
produces to fight off infection.
"One of the major advantages of this work," Fal
kow said, "is the fact that he (Koomey) has been able
to construct these strains that area bsolu tely identical,
except one doesn't have this enzyme, and the other
does. So that the comparison of the role of it can be
done very easily."
Normally, the next step in research would be to
compare the responses of laboratory animals injected
with either gonococcus or the engineered bacteria.
But the critical enzyme attacks only one specific
human antibody which is not present in animals. This,
accordine to Falkow. has slowed research utilizinc
the engineered strain of the bacteria.
Falkow, who has studied that
gonococcus bacteria for 10 years,
noted that although penicillin and its
derivatives have been quite effective in
stopping most acute bouts of
gonorrhea, the antibiotics are only a
temporary solution to the sexually
transmitted disease.
The research on IgAl protease is not
just addressing only the problem of
gonorrhea, however. Falkow said that
it is also addressing the more general
question of the strategies bacteria use
to cause disease.
According to Falkow, research on
the gonococcus bacteria is being fi
nanced by grants from the National In
stitute of Health, and has cost $32,000
per year for the last five years.
