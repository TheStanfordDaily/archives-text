# ASSU may close down its Office of Public Affairs
## 
### KATHY CHRISTIE Staff writer 
A resolution to abolish the ASSU
Office of Public Affairs (OPA) will K
submitted to the Senate tomorrow
night.
The resolution, proposed b\
graduate senator James McGrath
states that the OPA should be
abolished because it "is not staffed at
its authorized level" and "is not ac
complishing the tasks specified in its
charge."
To these allegations. Council of Pro
idents member Mark Epstein replied
"It's a combination of a lot of bad fac
tors. One is that the director resigned
and another is the budget."
Maria Doelger, the resigned OPA
director, cited the vagueness of the
original charter as a reason for the of
fice's apparent demise. Doelger said
the original charter divided the office *

duties into four areas: ''outreach, ad
vertising, distribution for advertising
and newsletter." This fall, the OPA
was divided into the OPA and the
ASSU Advertising Agency, which left
the OPA with performing outreach and
putting out the newsletter, Doelger
said.
The purpose of outreach was not
clearly defined, so "the most important
part got left behind." she said.
"The intention was to teach Stanford
what the ASSU was doing," said COP
member Rod Beckstrom." It was just a
communication body."
"They intended great things of the
OPA," said Doelger. "The problem
with the OPA was that no one really
knew what it was supposed to do."
Doelger resigned because she
couldn't put in the time required of the
job. "I wanted to do it but I couldn't,"
she said. —

"All charters are vague," said Eps
tein. who said that the definition of out
reach was "vague, but it gave flexibil
ity."
"It's really the money that hurt us
this year," said Epstein.
The background statement for the
resolution states that "in the original
1982-1983 Operating Budget the Of
fice was allocated $5535. This was re
duced by the Senate last quarter to
$3235. As of January 4, 1983, the Of
fice had spent $926.94."
Epstein said that the OPA only spent
$92 6.94 because, "we just couldn't
hire staff. We opened up the position of
director for four weeks . .. and we
didn't get one application." The ex
penses were thus not as much as ex
pected because, "If we hire somebody
that's automatically $1200."
"Our newsletter editors got caught
in the budget crunch," said Doelger.

One, Tahirih Lee, eventually resigned
when the ASSU Correspondent went
from a newspaper to a newsletter for
mat.
Epstein pointed to the newsletter as
an example of a case in which "the big
problem was that people that took on
the job found that what they expected
to do was becoming much less signific
ant." He said also," If there were more
money we would get a more quality
staff." The OPA was extremely under
funded, he said.
The COP has not yet formulated its
official position concerning the resolu
tion.
But Epstein said the OPA "should
be left open but not operative. We will
live within our means, but our means
are not that great " he said. "One thing
we're trying not to do is pass on our
problems."
