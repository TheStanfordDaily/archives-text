## On the military: U.S. faces cuts Soviets hint missile withdrawal Soviets offer West non aggression pact 
### 
Compiled from news reports and wire services
In a bid for European support of its proposed nonaggression pact,
Moscow has set its sights on a compromise that will stay the NATO
deployment of 572 new U.S.-built nuclear missiles.
Soviets have hinted that they may remove about 380 launchers
with 580 warheads if the plan to deploy the Pershing 11 and ground
launched cruise missiles next year is scrapped. The 150 or so remain
ing SS-20s would roughly equal the 162 missile launchers in the
independent French and British nuclear forces. But the United States
would be left with no launchers in Western Europe.
In an unusual statement, the government of British Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher welcomed recent rumors of com promise, saying a
Soviet offer "may be a step in the right direction." And though
French President Francois Miterrand firmly backed the U.S.
negotiating stance, he has said the outcome could be somewhere
between the opening U.S. and Soviet positions.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany welcomed the proposal and
said the West "would give it careful consideration." A crucial issue
for the West Germans is whether to go ahead with the deployment
this year of the Pershing II medium-range missiles and cruise mis
siles. If negotiations between the Soviets seem promising govern
ment leaders might choose to delay deployment.
The Reagan administration, however, is unenthusiastic about the
recent offering and said the Warsaw Pact's call for a non-aggression
treaty "does not seem to represent anything new."
The 7000-word Soviet bloc statement called for a mutual renuncia
tion of force by both sides on the basis that such a move "could help to
overcome the division of Europe into confronting military groupings
and meet the desire of the peoples to live in peace and security." The
text of the proposal said it would be a commitment of treaty members
not to be the first to use military force of any kind against each other.
Such a treaty, the proposal said, should be accompanied by practical
measures to reduce the threat of surprise attack and to reduce exist
ing arms.
The text also said no treaty would eliminate the "legitimate rights
of the participants in it to individual and collective self-defense."
Though the administration's formal response did not reject the
proposal outright, American skepticism was clear. Addressing the
Warsaw proposal, John Hughes, State Department spokesman, said
in a statement, "We learned from bitter experience between two
world wars that simple declarations of peaceful intent are not
enough. What we need are concrete results, which not only reduce
the danger of war, but which contribute to an atmosphere of in
creased trust."
Meanwhile Western diplomats in Moscow and Defense Depart
ment experts link the offer to Soviet efforts to derail the plan by
Western alliances to deploy the American medium-range missiles in
Europe. The missiles are scheduled for installment starting in De
cember and are in response to the buildup of Soviet intermediate
range SS-20 missiles aimed at Western Europe.
Said one Pentagon official of the proposal: "It's another kind of
zero option â€” zero missiles for the U.S. and hundreds for them."
