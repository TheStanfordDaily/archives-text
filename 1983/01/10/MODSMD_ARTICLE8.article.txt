# Treaty proposal outlined

Compiled from news reports and wire services
Calling for cooperation in easing international!
tensions, the Soviet Union and its Warsaw allies
made public Friday the details of a proposed
nonaggression pact with the nations of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization.
The goals of the Prague talks seem concentrated
on an accelerated conclusion of agreements to halt
the current arms race. Among the Warsaw Pact's:
objectives listed are efforts:
• To elaborate in the shortest possible period a
treaty on a complete and general ban on nuclear
tests;
• To accelerate the elaboration of an interna
tional convention on banning and liquidating
chemical weapons;
• To start planning a convention banning neut
ron weapons;
• To open immediately talks on banning the de
ployment of any weapons in outer space;
• To complete as soon as possible the conclusion
of an international convention banning radiologi
cal weapons;
•To speed settlement of the question of
strengthening security guarantees of the non
nuclear states.
The pact currently being offered by Soviet leader
Yuri Andropov and his government is not the first
such attempt. The idea for nonaggression pacts
between rival blocks was put forth for the first time
in 1955 at a summit meeting between the Soviets,
who represented the Warsaw alliance, and leaders
of the United States, Britain and France.
Nikolai Bulganin, then Soviet Prime Minister,
proposed the pact as a step toward dissolving both
alliances. It was rejected by the Western allies as a
ploy to weaken NATO and separate West Ger
many from the West.
In the recent past, Soviet proposals of treaties
based on the renunciation of force, such as the
pledge not to be the first to use nuclear weapons
that the Kremlin gave last year, have been dismis
sed by the West because they make no tangible
contribution to the lowering of tensions between

the opposing blocks.
The nonaggression pact proposal was prefaced
by the previously rejected Soviet proposal that
both NATO and the Warsaw alliance dissolve. The
Warsaw Pact leaders said the bid remained in
force, but added the current situation "makes it
impossible to wait any longer."
Pact negotiators stressed the urgent need to take
"effective measures which can already today lessen
mistrust between the Warsaw treaty member states
and the NATO states and diminish their fears of
possible aggression."
Member states of the Warsaw Pact include the
Soviet Union, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, East
Germany, Hungary, Poland and Rumania. NATO
is comprised of the United States, Belgium, Bri
tain, Canada, Denmark, France, Greece, Iceland,
Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Por
tugal, West Germany, Spain and Turkey.
Western diplomats in Moscow indicated the
primary target of the Soviet proposal appears to be
West Germany, which is to be the base for the
entire complement of 108 Pershing II missiles.
Diplomats speculate that the Soviets might con
sider West Germans particularly susceptible to the
appeal for an East-West nonaggression pact
West Germany was the first and only WesteritVia
tion to reach such an agreement with the Kremlin,
in 1970.
The interpretation gained credence from pas
sages in the document directed at European fears
that the Reagan administration is pursuing policies
that undermine the political and economic ties with
Eastern Europe that developed in the 19705.
The treaty outline also urged mutual commit
ment to nonaggressive solutions of conflict.
Adopting an attitude of peaceful co-existence,
members of the Pact declared that they "have no
aggressive intentions" and said that if NATO
members are committed to similar declarations
"there should be no reason preventing the adop
tion by the states comprising the two alliances of
appropriate mutual commitments of an interna
tional legal character."
