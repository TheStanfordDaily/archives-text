# Military cuts passed; Pentagon feels pinch
## 
### 
Compiled from news reports and wire services
As a gesture to Congress, White House officials say President
Reagan is likely to accept modest cuts in military spending in his 1984
budget.
But the battle over military spending and the MX missile is
nonetheless expected to be long and hard-fought.
Under pressure from Congress, Defense Secretary Caspar Wein
berger has agreed to see if he could produce additional cuts in
military appropriations in the 1984 fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1,
and in following years. Studies were ordered last week to see if
reductions could be made without undercutting military readiness or
weapons production.
As described by several officials, the freeze might include suspen
sion of cost-of-living increases in pay, retirement and benefit prog
rams. Cuts in actual military spending on arms, however, are ex
pected to be slight.
Aides said the savings would be substantially more than the $30
billion in reductions agreed on within the administration early last
week.
Despite the presidential concession, aides predict that the prop
osed budget will probably still be rejected by Congress and rewritten
extensively. For this reason officials indicated it was important to
accede to demands for military cuts as a sign of good faith and
willingness to work with the Congress as the budget is revised.
Weinberger has been shuttling back and forth between the Penta
gon and White House as the Pentagon comptroller's office makes
assessments in conjunction with defense specialists at the White
House Office of Management and Budget.
The comptroller's office Friday assessed the impact of a series of
cuts, officials said, including reductions of $8 billion, $11 billion and
$20 billion in budget authority and only a modest 3 percent increase
in actual spending from fiscal 1983 to 1984.
While nothing has been decided yet, disputed estimates on funds
needed to continue current programs have complicated Wein
berger's efforts to trim the defense budget.
For example, the Navy's shipbuilding program is expected to cost
at least $5 billion more than anticipated over the next five years,
defense officials said Friday.
The dispute further clouds the future of Reagan's defense buildup
when Pentagon budget chiefs are conducting frantic paper exercises
to assess the consequences of trimming defense to help reduce pro
jected federal budget deficits of more than $200 billion in fiscal 1984
and beyond.

The Reagan administration has said it would make more sense to
shrink forces by reducing personnel on the payroll than to reduce
readiness by skimping on spare parts, ammunition and training.
Savings made by reducing personnel also can be achieved much more
quickly than scrapping super-weapons like the Air Force's B-l
bomber or the Navy's two Nimitz-class aircraft carriers, which are
paid for in installments over five years or more.
An additional strain is the expected increase in military outlays
from $208.8 billion in the current year to $247 billion next year, a
growth of more than 18 percent including inflation.
