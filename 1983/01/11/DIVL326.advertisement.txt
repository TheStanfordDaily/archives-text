Today's technology may represent only a feeble glimpse into the possible.
That's why we are probing the frontiers of science and technology with
basic and applied research at sophisticated levels.
These investigations are in high energy laser optics; infrared electro
optical systems and fiber optics; microprocessors and semiconductor
application; semicustom IC/hybrid circuits; energy conversion; materials
technology; fluid dynamics; CAD/CAM and robotics; industrial and military
systems analysis; scientific/commercial programming; instrument research;
... other areas.
Maybe you can help if you are a graduate student. So let's talk when we
visit your campus.
