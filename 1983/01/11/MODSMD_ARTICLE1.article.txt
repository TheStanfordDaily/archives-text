# Stanford tops ranking in technology revenues
## 
### KRISTEN CHRISTOPHER Senior staff writer 
The University has found that scien
tific research can be profitable. Stan
ford received more than $2.5 million —
more than any other university — from
technology licensing during fiscal
1982.
A study of the 20 U.S. universities
with the largest research volumes was
done by Roger Ditzel, UC-Berkeley's
director of patents, trademarks and
copyrights.
Stanford's $2.5 million income from
technologies made it first on the list,
Ditzel confirmed. He said Cal's gross
income was approximately $1.7 mil
lion, but he would not release its rank
ing or information about other schools.
Income from 56 technologies — aris
ing mostly from research done in
molecular biology and information sci
ences — contributed to the $2.5 mil
lion. However, almost $1.5 million was
generated by the recombinant DNA
patent, according to Niels Reimers, di
rector of the Office of Technology and
Licensing.
"This was an unusual year because of
the separate accounting of the DNA
case," he said.
The normal procedure for allocating
income from technologies, Reimers
said, is for 15 percent to be taken off
the top for administrative cost recovery
and for the net income to be divided
equally with one-third of it going to the
inventors, one-third to their depart
ments and one-third to their schools.
However, he said this year some of the
money was distributed differently be
cause of the gene splicing and cloning
patent.
The recombinant techniques that led
to that patent were developed by Stan
ley Cohen, professor of medicine and
genetics here, and UC-San Francisco

Prof. Eugene Boyer.
The University of California was
paid $471,843 for its share of the pat
ent, $15,000 was held for known
liabilities related to the patent and
$200,000 was held as a "litigation re
serve," according to Reimers. The
$200,000 will be used "to enforce the
patent, to have something in reserve
for legal costs," he explained.
The money given to the inventors,
their departments and schools was not
equal as the designated formula indi
cates it should be. Reimers said the
discrepancy exists because Cohen do
nated his share of the recombinant
DNA patent to the Medical School's
Department of Medicine fellowship
fund and in some cases it is not possible
to identify a single inventor who should
receive the funds earned.
The money that goes to Stanford de
partments and schools "has to go back
into research or educational pur
poses," Reimers said. "It's free re
search money . . . it's important to get
stiiHerus started off in research."
David Mendelow, associate dean for
administration at the Medical School,
said that the money his school receives
is put back into the operating budget
and is used to help make up the decline
in research funds.
Since some of the income received
from patents is put back into University
research, it seems possible that officials
here might encourage researchers to
concentrate on projects that could re
sult in a marketable product. However,
Reimers said, "That would be inap
propriate."
Scientists are "motivated by being
first scientifically," he added, so it is
unlikely they will be affected by the
monetary potential of licensed
technology.
