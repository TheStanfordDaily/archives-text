## The
						Stanford Daily Money management crucial 
### 
Given the poor and careless management of last
spring's ASSU elections, it is not surprising to dis
cover that an error originating from those elections
has caused a problem that will likely delay the
receipt of funding for a campus organization.
The Stanford Committee on Political Education
(SCOPE) won the right to a fee assessment when it
received the overwhelming approval of the student
voters last spring. However, the ommission of this
group on the list of voting results officially ap
proved by the ASSU Senate last spring caused
SCdPE. to be left off the list of organizations
scheduled to receive a fee assessment. As a result
of this oversight the source of SCOPE'S entire
budget — the $10,000 it receives from fee assess
ments — is currently up in the air.
The ASSU wants the University to put SjCOPE
on the Permits to Register to be used for spring
registration. But the University claims that the
extra expense of adding in the extra dollar to the
University loans and grants would be prohibitive.
ASSU officials have stated that if the University
does not agree to the addition of the fee assess
ment, they will loan SCOPE an interest free loan of
$10,000 at a cost to students of between $700 and
$750.

The ASSU is in no position to demand that the
University bail them out of a self-created problem.
On the other hand, if the ASSU has to advance a
loan to SCOPE the ASSU loses about $700 — a
cost paid by all students.
While the need for exploring the least expensive
alternatives for rectifying this problem is under
stood, the dispute over which option ought to be
used should not obscure the basic fact that the
responsibility for the mishap clearly rests with the
ASSU. It should also not cause us to overlook the
inconvenience and uncertainty that this mistake
has caused SCOPE.
Though a majority of its time is spent on other
concerns, one of the ASSU's most important func
tions is to collect and distribute money to those
student organizations which earned that right
through a vote of the students. In this case the
ASSU has failed in one of its most important tasks.
While we are encouraged by the ASSU's will
ingness to attempt to redress a wrong it caused to
SCOPE, we hope that some effort is made to pin
point the source of this mistake and make any
organizational corrections necessary to eliminate
or greatly reduce the chances of such an error
occurring again.
