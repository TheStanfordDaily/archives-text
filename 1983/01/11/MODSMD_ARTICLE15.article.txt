## Mentors enhance learning experience 
### 
High grades plus the mastery of course material may give
you a temporary high. They may give you an uneasy feeling
also. High grades help admit you to graduate school. Yet,
when you look back on these undergraduate years, you may
wonder if any skill, judgment or cohesive knowledge came
with those grades. Did you get any skills, usable knowledge
or judgment from 12 years of grammar and high school?
Many students answer no for both the college and pre
college years. This article can change the results of college
for you by focusing on mentors and far-thinking questions,
along with grades.
A personal relationship transmits skill and judgment
most directly. That is why professions demanding results
require mentors. For example, the surgeon-apprentice will
not receive a cutting knife until senior physicians have
observed him under intense pressure performing menial
tasks during the internship that follows eight years of uni
versity classrooms. Finally, the surgeon-apprentice cuts
open patients, but then only under the one-to-one supervi
sion of a seasoned surgeon.

If you really desire important
■ r> knowledge and productive methods
7 of thinking you will create your own
mentor-protege relationship.

Similarly, top law graduates work as clerks under Sup
reme Court justices. They could open up private practice.
However, they know that the Supreme Court clerkship is a
valuable method for intensive learning through association
with a person of great ability.
If you really desire important knowledge and productive
methods of thinking, you will create your own mentor
protege relationship. The university rarely provides you
with a structured mentor program like the Supreme Court
clerkship. Some science departments try to do it through
research assistant positions for students. Yet, the University
rarely organizes and then rewards the mentor-protege rela
tionship in the same way as it rewards high grade point
averages. This is a mistake because close relationships with
top experts can lead to more productivity than a degree
itself.
Here Is a step-by-step program for a mentor-protege
relationship which you can develop even if the University
provides none.
In the first step, identify a skill or an interest. In the
second step, locate the person inside or outside the Univer
sity who is the most competent in that knowledge or skill. In
the third step, develop a personal relationship centered
around far-thinking and around core questions. Let's go
over each of the steps in detail.
1. Identify a skill or interest. It could be your favorite
course. It could be someone you like or admire with a skill
that attracts you. It could be a skill in organizing people, a

physical ability in sports, sculpture, drawing or fixing motor
engines.
Commit yourself to developing this interest or skill, al
though you feel it will not lead to your ultimate work or
career. It will lead to other interests and skills which will
combine productively. For example, 1 know a bone surgeon
who spent three summers as a furniture maker's apprentice
in high school, another summer living and working in the
home of an engineer and, finally, five years in an internship.
His understanding of stress engineering, the amount of
weight the leg of a table can support and orthopedic surgery
combine to give him creative approaches to bone repair.
2. Ask friends and teachers the names of the people most
skilled and knowledgeable in your interest. Locate them and
approach them!
Will that person have time for you? Yes. The reason will
be the type of question you will ask in contrast to other
students. The typical student question is a "bread and but
ter" question asking for clarification of points made in class,
the due dates of term papers or the time of the final exam.,
These questions may not intrigue a Nobel Prize-winning
professor. In contrast to bread and butter questions,
teachers have time for far-thinking and core questions.
3. Far thinking questions ask the mentor to think ahead
and contemplate how to be effective iri the future, based on
the wisdom he possesses. For example; " Whets do you see
your field.developing over the neVt ID years?" This q(J£s-'
tion is followed by: "What skills or knowledge should I
obtain to become effective in your field?"
These questions give the mentor a chance to share the
future and give immortality to his ideas. This chemistry
between youth-inquiring and wisdom*thinking is the basis
for the mentor-protege relationship. Often, a mentor's own
children develop other interests and don't listen to him.
Consequently, a young person with a heartfelt interest and
good questions can unlock the mentor and share the proces
ses that produce wisdom, discovery and productivity.
On the other hand, core questions such as "What is the
secretof. . .?" give the mentor the chance to describe the core
drills that guide his productivity. "What is the secret of
holding 300 students in rapt attention while you lecture"
sounds corny. Yet the answers are the self statements and
the core drills that guide people. These drills are mdst
effectively passed on when you give the teacher time to
explore them with you in a close relationship. You can read
these core drills in granite on monuments dedicated to
Theodore Roosevelt or Abraham Lincoln or in Stanford
Memorial Church; this method is less effective. Least effec
tive is taking lecture notes at a distance. Learning one-to
one is most effective.
Developing a close personal relationship with a person
whose skill or profession impresses you is as good as striving
for high grades in a course. It will take initiative on your
part, whereas courses, exams and term papers are handed to
you on a silver platter. Try them both this term and see
which gives you more fulfillment and more lasting results.

Developing a close personal relationship with a person
whose skill or profession impresses you is as good as striving
for high grades in a course. It will take initiative on your
part, whereas courses, exams and term papers are handed to
you on a silver platter. Try them both this term and see
which gives you more fulfillment and more lasting results.

High grades plus the mastery of course material may give
you a temporary high. They may give you an uneasy feeling
also. High grades help admit you to graduate school. Yet,
when you look back on these undergraduate years, you may
wonder if any skill, judgment or cohesive knowledge came
with those grades. Did you get any skills, usable knowledge
or judgment from 12 years of grammar and high school?
Many students answer no for both the college and pre
college years. This article can change the results of college
for you by focusing on mentors and far-thinking questions,
along with grades.
A personal relationship transmits skill and judgment
most directly. That is why professions demanding results
require mentors. For example, the surgeon-apprentice will
not receive a cutting knife until senior physicians have
observed him under intense pressure performing menial
tasks during the internship that follows eight years of uni
versity classrooms. Finally, the surgeon-apprentice cuts
open patients, but then only under the one-to-one supervi
sion of a seasoned surgeon.

If you really desire important

7 of thinking you will create your own
mentor-protege relationship.

Similarly, top law graduates work as clerks under Sup
reme Court justices. They could open up private practice.
However, they know that the Supreme Court clerkship is a
valuable method for intensive learning through association
with a person of great ability.
If you really desire important knowledge and productive
methods of thinking, you will create your own mentor
protege relationship. The university rarely provides you
with a structured mentor program like the Supreme Court
clerkship. Some science departments try to do it through
research assistant positions for students. Yet, the University
rarely organizes and then rewards the mentor-protege rela
tionship in the same way as it rewards high grade point
averages. This is a mistake because close relationships with
top experts can lead to more productivity than a degree
itself.
Here Is a step-by-step program for a mentor-protege
relationship which you can develop even if the University
provides none.
In the first step, identify a skill or an interest. In the
second step, locate the person inside or outside the Univer
sity who is the most competent in that knowledge or skill. In
the third step, develop a personal relationship centered
around far-thinking and around core questions. Let's go
over each of the steps in detail.
1. Identify a skill or interest. It could be your favorite
course. It could be someone you like or admire with a skill
that attracts you. It could be a skill in organizing people, a

physical ability in sports, sculpture, drawing or fixing motor
engines.
Commit yourself to developing this interest or skill, al
though you feel it will not lead to your ultimate work or
career. It will lead to other interests and skills which will
combine productively. For example, 1 know a bone surgeon
who spent three summers as a furniture maker's apprentice
in high school, another summer living and working in the
home of an engineer and, finally, five years in an internship.
His understanding of stress engineering, the amount of
weight the leg of a table can support and orthopedic surgery
combine to give him creative approaches to bone repair.
2. Ask friends and teachers the names of the people most
skilled and knowledgeable in your interest. Locate them and
approach them!
Will that person have time for you? Yes. The reason will
be the type of question you will ask in contrast to other
students. The typical student question is a "bread and but
ter" question asking for clarification of points made in class,
the due dates of term papers or the time of the final exam.,
These questions may not intrigue a Nobel Prize-winning
professor. In contrast to bread and butter questions,
teachers have time for far-thinking and core questions.
3. Far thinking questions ask the mentor to think ahead
and contemplate how to be effective iri the future, based on
the wisdom he possesses. For example; " Whets do you see
your field.developing over the neVt ID years?" This q(J£s-'
tion is followed by: "What skills or knowledge should I
obtain to become effective in your field?"
These questions give the mentor a chance to share the
future and give immortality to his ideas. This chemistry
between youth-inquiring and wisdom*thinking is the basis
for the mentor-protege relationship. Often, a mentor's own
children develop other interests and don't listen to him.
Consequently, a young person with a heartfelt interest and
good questions can unlock the mentor and share the proces
ses that produce wisdom, discovery and productivity.
On the other hand, core questions such as "What is the
secretof. . .?" give the mentor the chance to describe the core
drills that guide his productivity. "What is the secret of
holding 300 students in rapt attention while you lecture"
sounds corny. Yet the answers are the self statements and
the core drills that guide people. These drills are mdst
effectively passed on when you give the teacher time to
explore them with you in a close relationship. You can read

tive is taking lecture notes at a distance. Learning one-to
