## God and prayer should never be dismissed lightly 
### 
Isaac Tabor's recent "God and the
need for explanations" (Daily, Jan. 5)
is heir to a long tradition which sees
religion and the experience of faith as
"nothing but . .(e.g., ideology, ob
sessional neurosis, resentment etc.).
Rather than respond point by point, I
would simply like to suggest a contrast
ing understanding of religion.
Religion is an enduring and vital as
pect of human experience. It arises out
of the experience of limits: when we
stand before the beauty of the universe
or ache from human cruelty, when we
hear the screams of Buchenwald or the
strains of Beethoven, something deep

within us is stirred. We can take that
stirring as the foundation for a house of
despair, or take the equally viable al
ternative of hope and of prayer. Prayer
can be a way of knowing, a kind of
sight, although it belongs in the trans
cendental realm. And clearly the world
does not suffer from an excess of trans
cendence.
In an age of potential thermonuclear
apocalypse, we cannot lightly dismiss
prayer nor easily give up our search for
God.
