# God's nature...

Isaac Tabor's column "God and the
need for explanations" presents two
opposing views of God: the God of the
"rational" mind, an undefined force, a
creator that imposes no moral obliga
tions, and the God of religion, a
"humanized" God who is supremely
just and compassionate. What it ends
up presenting are two "rational" Gods:
one of pure reasoning and one bor
rowed from modern liberal theology.
Tabor begins his discussion of the
"God of religion" by saying that "God
knows what we do and knows if it is
good or bad. Because He is almighty
and just, He should reward us or punish
us accordingly. Consequently, it is in
our best interest to behave well and
'please' Him." He talks about a system
of rewards and punishments which con
jures up an i mage of God holding scales
and deciding if a person's "good" out
weighed his "bad." This God is as
much a God of "reason" as the unde
fined force of the rational God. A God
of religion implies some amount of
faith. A God of faith would not save a
man because that man's good out
weighed his bad, for a God of supreme
justice would require a man to be per
fect. A God of faith would save a man
even though that man had sinned.
Tabor's article echoes the typical
statement of the liberal theologian
when he says "even if it were a sin not'

to believe in God, don't you think that
a being that is all compassion would
end up by forgiving us such a minor
transgression?" This is yet another ver
sion of the question "How can a loving
God send a man to hell?" The God of
religion isindeed a God of love, but this
love is tempered by justice. God is
often presented as a father. If a father
has his children's best interestsin mind,
he will punish those children at times. If
he decides that he "loves" his children
too much to punish them, the children
will soon learn that they can get away
with anything. Children with parents
like this soon become what most
people call "spoiled." Is this permissive
father the more loving of the two?
Tabor's article states that "God
doesn't need prayers and we don't
either. Because if prayers are only to
remind ourselves of the existence of
God. ..Is this the sole purpose of
prayer? If God can help humanity out
of the state that it is in today, then
prayer may be the thing we need the
most.
