# UC fee rise will lessen state deficit
## 
### KEVIN GROSS Staff writer 
As part of the proposed 1983-84 California state
budget he unveiled yesterday, Governor George
Duke Deukmejian included a provision for a
$ 150 increase in the annual "fees" paid by students
attending the University of California.
The looming state budget deficit has necessitated
the proposals to increase fees, which have more
than doubled in the past three years. The most
recent projections from the state controller's office
have estimated the state budget deficit for the cur
rent 1982-83 fiscal year at $1.5 to $2 billion.
Consequently, it is unlikely legislators will in
crease expenditures on the Cal-grant program,
which provides need-based subsidies to both public
and private college students. This will make it more
difficult for Stanford students to finance their edu
cational expenses, as tuition costs and other fees are
expected to rise again next year.
In a speech last September, University Vice-
President for Public Affairs Bob Rosenzweig, pro
posed to an all-university convocation at the Uni
versity of the Pacific that the University of Califor
nia begin charging students "realistic" levels of tui
tion, and provide grants to those who needed them.
Last September, Rosenzweig proposed introduc
ing " the concept of financial need... into the provi
sion of subsidies for public higher education." In a
recent interview, Rosenzweig observed "that the
failure to face the need for tuition dollars at public
schools has eroded the ability of students at private

universities to receive financial aid."
However, a spokesman in the Governor's office
said that Deukmejian has no plans to charge tuition
at UC schools, despite the proposed fee increase.
Apparently, there is an important psychological
and semantic difference between the word "fees"
and the word "tuition." One legislative aide said
that there is "concern among elected officials, that if
you begin talking 'tuition,' people will begin to be
lieve that you can't provide quality education at
little or no cost. It's basically symbolism."
According to Marj Dickinson, of the California
Post-Secondary Education Commission, the "fees"
which are assessed of students in the UC system are
not used for instructional costs, but rather for ad
ministrative costs and other services necessary for
maintaining the nine UC campuses.
Dickinson added that a report from the Commis
sion had recommended that the governing boards of
the state university system use a portion of student
fee revenues for instructional purposes, but did not
recommend that a tuition charge be imposed.
She said, however, that the "no tuition" policy
has been more of a symbol, although low fees have
been a tradition for a long time. "The school of
thought, is that what you do is charge fees at a level
that most students can meet, and provide aid to
those who need it."
Kate Jeffery, assistant financial aid director for
the UC system, noted that it will be difficult to
maintain the symbolic difference between tuition

and fees much longer. "In order to maintain the
semantic difference, you cannot raise 'fee' revenues
by more than $10-$ 12 million, or you will get into
instructional costs," she said.
Francis Mondragon, the acting director of finan
cial aid at UC-Berkeley, said that many Berkeley
students come from "mid to high affluent families.
At least 50 percent of the students come from
families with over $40,000 in annual income, and
many have incomes into the $50,000 to $60,000
bracket," lie said.
Mondragon was unsure whether the legislature
would impose tuition on state college and university
students, which he said might hurt really needy
students. "If the state feels they can continue to cut
back on the nine UC campuses, you either start
charging tuition, or you start cutting programs," he
said.
In spite of the state's financial situation, most, if
not all state legislators are adamant in stating their
opposition to charging "tuition" at UC campuses.
Included among these are Assembly speaker Willie
Brown. Yet several souces suggested that some
state legislators have been talking about charging
tuition, although there has been no formal move to
do so yet.
While Assemblyman Byron Sher (D-Palo Alto)
"strongly resists" the idea of "tuition" at UC
schools, his administrative aide Kip Lipper said that
Sher will look closely at the Governor's proposed
fee increase.

has been more of a symbol, although low fees have
been a tradition for a long time. "The school of
thought, is that what you do is charge fees at a level
that most students can meet, and provide aid to
those who need it."
Kate Jeffery, assistant financial aid director for
the UC system, noted that it will be difficult to
maintain the symbolic difference between tuition

and fees much longer. "In order to maintain the
semantic difference, you cannot raise 'fee' revenues
by more than $10-$ 12 million, or you will get into
instructional costs," she said.
Francis Mondragon, the acting director of finan
cial aid at UC-Berkeley, said that many Berkeley
students come from "mid to high affluent families.
At least 50 percent of the students come from
families with over $40,000 in annual income, and
many have incomes into the $50,000 to $60,000
bracket," lie said.
Mondragon was unsure whether the legislature
would impose tuition on state college and university
students, which he said might hurt really needy
students. "If the state feels they can continue to cut
back on the nine UC campuses, you either start
charging tuition, or you start cutting programs," he
said.
In spite of the state's financial situation, most, if
not all state legislators are adamant in stating their
opposition to charging "tuition" at UC campuses.
Included among these are Assembly speaker Willie
Brown. Yet several souces suggested that some
state legislators have been talking about charging
tuition, although there has been no formal move to
do so yet.
While Assemblyman Byron Sher (D-Palo Alto)
"strongly resists" the idea of "tuition" at UC
schools, his administrative aide Kip Lipper said that
Sher will look closely at the Governor's proposed
fee increase.
