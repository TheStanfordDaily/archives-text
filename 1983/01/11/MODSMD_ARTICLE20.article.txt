## Foreign debts: today, yesterday 
### 
Today's international financial sys
tem is groaning under a monstrous
load, some $500 billion of debts owed
mostly by less developed countries and
especially (about $300 billion) by Latin
American countries. At least a dozen
countries, led by Mexico and Brazil,
have foreign debts as large as their na
tional products, comparable to the Un
ited States owing a trillion or so dollars
abroad; and they face annual charges
far greater than any likely export
surpluses. This debt overhang has been
growing for many years, at first slowly
and then much more rapidly since
OPEC price increases threw world fi-

nancial relations out of joint.
n This, seems a new phenomenon in
world history, but it is hot erttirely So.
Senior citizens may remember that the
f92os were filled with controversy over
debts owed principally to the United
States. The obligations remaining from
World War I were the biggest subject
of diplomacy of the decade. Great Bri
tain, France, Italy and other countries
owed the United States some $11 bill
ion (equivalent to about 10 times as
many 1982 dollars) for loans to fight
the war before the United States en
tered, while Germany owed other
countries, mostly France, a much larger
amount in reparations under the peace
treaties.
Germany lacked means of paying
reparations, France would not or could
not pay the United States unless Ger
many paid and Britain had severe fi
nancial problems. The United States
collected a little only by paying itself:
new loans were made to Germany,
which in turn used them to make pay
ments on reparations, which were used
to make a few debt payments. There
were conferences and plans for cutting
down and stretching out the repara
tions and debts, until the Young Plan
extended them to 1988, to burden the
greatgrandchildren of those who
started the war. Finally in 1930, as

world trade spiraled down in the De
pression, President Herbert Hoover
had the statesmanship to call for a
year's moratorium to save Germany
from financial ruin. This became a four
years' moratorium, and the old debts
were eventually forgotten in the new
conflict of World War 11. The United
States then took care not to ask for
lOUs that would not be collectable.
The current situation is in some ways
quite different. Now there are no com
plicating questions of war reparations
and the just sharing of war costs. Now
the deeply indebted countries are not

strong European ones, but mostly rela
tively weak Third World economies.
Most of the ttioney is owed hoW to pri
vate banks. And now the lenders are
much more willing to throw new money
at bad debts by extending new loans to
forestall default.
Despite these differences there are
strong parallels. Nowadays the debtor
countries again feel that they are not
morally bound to pay because the loans
have been to the advantage of the len
ders, and they claim the history of

Great Britain, Franee, Italy and other countries
owed the United States some $11 billion
(equivalent to about 10 times as many 1982
dollars) for loans to fight the war before the
United States entered, while Germany owed
other countries, mostly France, a much larger
amount in reparations under the peace treaties.

exploitation gives special rights to the
poor borrowers. If they do not disclaim
responsibility so emphatically as those
who called the United States "Uncle
Shylock" 60 years ago, it is because
they hope for new loans. Ultimate re
payment is at least as much out of the

question today as in the 19205. Now as
then the debtors would have to in
crease enormously their sales in the
United States in order to earn dollars to
meet their obligations. The idea of
Europeans paying war debts was given
its coup de grace by the Smoot-Hawley
tariff of 1930, raising a high protec
tionist wall around the American mar
ket, but no sufficient increase of Euro
pean exports to this country was con
ceivable in any case. Shortly after
World War I Germany made some ef
fort to meet reparations with shipments
of goods to France and Italy; producers
in those countries protested and stop
ped it. Now the American mood is
again protectionist; it is typical that
whereas Brazil owes so much, there are
barriers against many Brazilian man
ufacturers. If there is any serious idea
of the debtor countries paying, or even
keeping up with interest due, the
minimum response would be to open
fully the American market.
The outcome of the debt crisis is also
likely to be ultimately the same: the
realization that efforts to press for
payment of unpayable debts are futile
and damaging to the world economy.
The easy way out, postponing troubles
by "restructuring" or "roll-overs,"
with new loans to meet immediate ob
ligations, cannot work forever unless
inflation keeps reducing the real value
of debts. Sooner or later banks and
public lending agencies will have to ac
cept the fact, however painful, that a
large part of their assets are pretense,
and that the easy paper profits from
furnishing large sums to more or less

incompetent governments for dubious
purposes has to come to an end.
