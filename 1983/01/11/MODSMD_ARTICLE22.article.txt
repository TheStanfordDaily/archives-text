## 'Tootsie': sex role comedy without guilt 
### STEVE VINEBERG 
For the first hour, the beauti
fully balanced new comedy
Tootsie reminds you of Some
Like It Hot, with Dustin
Hoffman in a role that merges
the Jack Lemmon and Tony Cur
tis parts, and Jessica Lange
standing in for Marilyn Monroe.
Hoffman plays Michael Dorsey,
a gifted actor and teacher of act
ing who can't get a job because,
his agents tells him, he's too dif
ficult: he quarrels with all his di
rectors, even when he shoots
commercials. So when one of his
students, Sandy (Teri Garr), is
turned down for ajole in a day
time soap because she doesn't fit
the "type" demanded, Michael
shows up at the studio dressed
and made up as a woman — he
calls himself Dorothy Michaels
— and talks his way into an audi
tion. He performs with so much
conviction that he lands the part
(as a newly hired hospital ad
ministrator in something called
Southwest General), and almost
immediately falls in love with
Julie (Jessica Lange), an actress
on the show who is attached to its
chauvinistic director (Dabney
Coleman).
Tootsie has Vaudeville bits in it
that I haven't seen since Some
Like It Hot — like Dorothy walk
ing into a women's washroom
and apologizing, and a running

Dustin Hoffman has to exercise all his
actors wiles to keep up with the game,
while he is discovering layers of sensitivity
in himself he never knew existed. And
Tootsie manages to get cleverer, funnier and
more moving as its complications mount.

gag based on her masculine
strength -— and they still work
surprisingly well. But as the
movie continues, it grows out of
this tradition — and grows and
grows. It's a knockout — and it's
the first comedy ever made
about sex roles with ideas that
you don't feel embarrassed
about discussing afterwards.
Blake Edwards' Victor /Victoria,
which came out last winter,
claimed tc say something about
male and female sexuality, but in
the end the "daring" heroine,
Julie Andrews, who disguised
herself as a female impersonator
in order to get a singing job,
turned out to be as conven
tionally feminine as any 1950s
leading lady, taking her virile

man (James Garner) to suffer
through an opera while his taste
in entertainment — a boxing
match — made her cringe and
hide her eyes. But Tootsie
doesn't compromise itself. The

structure demands that as
Michael gets himself deeper and
deeper into this sexual and pro
fessional deception — as
Dorothy becomes the darling of
daytime television and she and
Julie become more and more in
timate friends — he has to exer
cise all his actor's wiles to keep
up with the game, while he is dis
covering layers of sensitivity in
himself he never knew existed.
And Tootsie manages to get cle
verer, funnier and more moving
as its complications mount.
The screenwriting credit goes
jointly to Larry Gelbart (A
Funny Thing Happened on the
Way to the Forum and Sly Fox on
Broadway, M*A *S*H on TV,
Movie Movie on screen) and

Murray Schisgal (who wrote The
Typists, The Tiger and Luv for
the stage, as well as a 1969 Dus
tin Hoffman vehicle called
Jimmy Shine), but apparently half
the talented writers in Hol
lywood worked on it, including
Elaine May and Barry Levinson.
Often a script that has made the
rounds in this way has a desper
ate quality about it, as if
everyone had tried in vain to sal
vage it, but Tootsie feels like a
community effort — it's been
blessed with the work of many
highly skilled hands, male and
female. I would guess that when
all these contributors saw what
the director, Sydney Pollack, had
done with it, they were all proud
fo have shared in its construc
tion. Pollack has a reputation for
bringing out the best in some of
the actors he's worked with —
Jane Fonda and Gig Young in
They Shoot Horses, Don't They?,
Robert Redford and Barbra
Streisand in The Way We Were,
Paul Newman in last year's Ab
sence of Malice — and there isn't
a bum performance in Tootsie,
from Hoffman and Lange
through the supporting cast: Bill
Murray as Michael's roommate
Jeff, an aspiritlg playwright; Teri.
Garr as Sandy; Charles Durning
as Julie's father Les, who falls for
Dorothy; George Gaynes as the
dim, pompous, narcisstic star of

Southwest General. (The worst
that can be said is that Dabney
Coleman, as the television di
rector, repeats his role from 9 to
5. Pollack even turns in an excel
lent performance himself, as
Michael's exasperated agent).
But even the best parts of They
Shoot Horses and The Way We
Were don't prepare us for the
marvellous way in which Pollack
has shaped Tootsie, which builds
to the most uproarious climax
any American movie has given
us in years, or for his rich, sym
pathetic treatment of the theatri
cal milieu where the screenplay
is located. Pollack trained as an
actor at New York's Neighbor
hood Playhouse and appeared in
small parts in a number of televi
sion dramas in the '50s, so he
must have recognized Michael
Dorsey and his students and
friends, who sweat to be truthful
and do honest work but have to
confront the invariably brutal
and generally fruitless cycle of
auditions while they pay the rent
with restaurant jobs. The movie
begins with a sequence in which
Michael's feverish exhortations
to his students to set no limits on
their talents — a good actor, he
tells them, can act anything —
are intercut with his own disap
pointments at audition after au
dition, his failure to convince di
rectors that he can make himself

right for the parts they say he's
too old, or too short, or too tall
for. This scene, and a party scene
that follows in which Jeff gets
drunk and verbalizes his crazy

phenomenal generations of actors this

Dustin Hoffman belongs to
one of the most phenomenal
generations of actors this coun
try has ever seen — the group
that headed into their 40s a
couple of years ago — and he
may end up with the most im
pressive record of all of them. In
his decade and a half in movies,
he has rarely given a bad per
formance, and despite his dis
tinctive vocal mannerisms, he
has succeeded with amazing con
sistency in finding new ways of
approaching new roles. Because
he is so well known for being
temperamental and exacting, we
can't help seeing him in Michael
Dorsey — but Michael Dorsey is
also a brilliant actor, and when
he finally becomes a star, as
Dorothy, no one can deny that
he has earned it. You have to have
patience for Hoffman when he
stands up at the Academy
Awards ceremony and lauds
struggling young actors with
what sounds like condescension,
but when you see his work in
Tootsie and Kramer vs. Kramer
and the sadly neglected Straight
Time (in which he plays an ex
con), you can appreciate that he
embodies the principles Michael
endorses. Hoffman plays
Dorothy as a southern belle with
a hidden spring that snaps when
she's pushed too far; that's her
tie with Michael. Otherwise, she
resides in the areas of his person
ality that he doesn't have time to
explore in his masculine life:

she's sweet, attentive, emotion
ally generous. As much as I've
enjoyed Hoffman in comedies
before this, I've never seen any
thing like his delicacy in the
scene in which Les indicates his

admiration for Dorothy, or the
scenes with Jessica Lange, in
which he longs to make love to
her and can't. In one of them,
Julie confesses that knowing
Dorothy has made her feel
lonely, as if she wanted some
thing she can't have; Michael
leans forward to kiss her, and she
pulls back, confused and upset.
It's a Shakespearean moment.
Of course, these scenes
couldn't work without Jessica

Lange. Hoffman has been rec
ognized for his talent since his
first starring role (in The
Graduate), but Lange is only be
ginning to receive critical atten
tion, in Tootsie and in the title
role in Frances, which played
limited engagements in New
York and Los Angeles around
Christmas in order to qualify for
the Oscars. But she was delight
ful in King Kong — though for
some reason most people who
saw her in it assumed that she
was funny by accident — and her

intense, erotic performance in
the recent remake of The Post
man Always Rings Twice wan the
only thing that made it worth se
eing. In Tootsie, she plays a
woman who is so effortlessly
sexy and so dreamy — Julie swal
lows bits of her sentences, as if
she weren't aware that she
hadn't completed them — that
men don't give her credit for
brains or talent or stability, but
she holds down a tough acting
job while raising a child on her
own, and when Dorothy begins
to coach her (Michael can't re
sist) her acting really improves.
Michael is attracted to Julie be
cause she's gorgeous, but as he
gets to know her, as Dorothy, in
ways that would be denied
Michael, he really falls in love
with her; that's the great, satisfy
ing joke the whole movie hinges
on. And Lange provides Julie
with as much depth as the movie
needs.
One can find elements of
Tootsie to complain about —
chiefly that since Michael's love
affair with Sandy, which exists as
a matter of narrative conveni
ence, is the only example we
have of his behavior toward
women before his relationship

with Julie, we can't see the de
velopment of his understanding
and sensitivity as clearly as we
might like. (He doesn't seem in
sensitive even in his pre-Dorothy
scenes.) But to cavil when you're
faced with a comedy of real sen
sibility seems like ingratitude.
Tootsie is about people who can't
be pinned down or slotted be
cause they keep changing; it cel
ebrates the joy of constant mo
tion, constant surprise. Appro
priately, it brings out the best in
everyone associated with it.

Tootsie to complain about —

women before his relationship

with Julie, we can't see the de
velopment of his understanding
and sensitivity as clearly as we
might like. (He doesn't seem in
sensitive even in his pre-Dorothy
scenes.) But to cavil when you're
faced with a comedy of real sen
sibility seems like ingratitude.
Tootsie is about people who can't
be pinned down or slotted be
cause they keep changing; it cel
ebrates the joy of constant mo

Dustin Hoffman and Jessica Lange in Tootsie.

For the first hour, the beauti
fully balanced new comedy
Tootsie reminds you of Some
Like It Hot, with Dustin
Hoffman in a role that merges
the Jack Lemmon and Tony Cur
tis parts, and Jessica Lange
standing in for Marilyn Monroe.
Hoffman plays Michael Dorsey,
a gifted actor and teacher of act
ing who can't get a job because,
his agents tells him, he's too dif
ficult: he quarrels with all his di
rectors, even when he shoots
commercials. So when one of his
students, Sandy (Teri Garr), is
turned down for ajole in a day
time soap because she doesn't fit
the "type" demanded, Michael
shows up at the studio dressed
and made up as a woman — he
calls himself Dorothy Michaels
— and talks his way into an audi
tion. He performs with so much
conviction that he lands the part
(as a newly hired hospital ad
ministrator in something called
Southwest General), and almost
immediately falls in love with
Julie (Jessica Lange), an actress
on the show who is attached to its
chauvinistic director (Dabney
Coleman).
Tootsie has Vaudeville bits in it
that I haven't seen since Some
Like It Hot — like Dorothy walk
ing into a women's washroom
and apologizing, and a running

Dustin Hoffman has to exercise all his
actors wiles to keep up with the game,
while he is discovering layers of sensitivity
in himself he never knew existed. And
Tootsie manages to get cleverer, funnier and
more moving as its complications mount.

gag based on her masculine
strength -— and they still work
surprisingly well. But as the
movie continues, it grows out of
this tradition — and grows and
grows. It's a knockout — and it's
the first comedy ever made
about sex roles with ideas that
you don't feel embarrassed
about discussing afterwards.
Blake Edwards' Victor /Victoria,
which came out last winter,
claimed tc say something about
male and female sexuality, but in
the end the "daring" heroine,
Julie Andrews, who disguised
herself as a female impersonator
in order to get a singing job,
turned out to be as conven
tionally feminine as any 1950s
leading lady, taking her virile

man (James Garner) to suffer
through an opera while his taste
in entertainment — a boxing
match — made her cringe and
hide her eyes. But Tootsie
doesn't compromise itself. The

structure demands that as
Michael gets himself deeper and
deeper into this sexual and pro
fessional deception — as
Dorothy becomes the darling of
daytime television and she and
Julie become more and more in
timate friends — he has to exer
cise all his actor's wiles to keep
up with the game, while he is dis
covering layers of sensitivity in
himself he never knew existed.
And Tootsie manages to get cle
verer, funnier and more moving
as its complications mount.
The screenwriting credit goes
jointly to Larry Gelbart (A
Funny Thing Happened on the
Way to the Forum and Sly Fox on
Broadway, M*A *S*H on TV,
Movie Movie on screen) and

Murray Schisgal (who wrote The
Typists, The Tiger and Luv for
the stage, as well as a 1969 Dus
tin Hoffman vehicle called
Jimmy Shine), but apparently half
the talented writers in Hol
lywood worked on it, including
Elaine May and Barry Levinson.
Often a script that has made the
rounds in this way has a desper
ate quality about it, as if
everyone had tried in vain to sal
vage it, but Tootsie feels like a
community effort — it's been
blessed with the work of many
highly skilled hands, male and
female. I would guess that when
all these contributors saw what
the director, Sydney Pollack, had
done with it, they were all proud
fo have shared in its construc
tion. Pollack has a reputation for
bringing out the best in some of
the actors he's worked with —
Jane Fonda and Gig Young in
They Shoot Horses, Don't They?,
Robert Redford and Barbra
Streisand in The Way We Were,
Paul Newman in last year's Ab
sence of Malice — and there isn't
a bum performance in Tootsie,
from Hoffman and Lange
through the supporting cast: Bill
Murray as Michael's roommate
Jeff, an aspiritlg playwright; Teri.
Garr as Sandy; Charles Durning
as Julie's father Les, who falls for
Dorothy; George Gaynes as the
dim, pompous, narcisstic star of

Southwest General. (The worst
that can be said is that Dabney
Coleman, as the television di
rector, repeats his role from 9 to
5. Pollack even turns in an excel
lent performance himself, as
Michael's exasperated agent).
But even the best parts of They
Shoot Horses and The Way We
Were don't prepare us for the
marvellous way in which Pollack
has shaped Tootsie, which builds
to the most uproarious climax
any American movie has given
us in years, or for his rich, sym
pathetic treatment of the theatri
cal milieu where the screenplay
is located. Pollack trained as an
actor at New York's Neighbor
hood Playhouse and appeared in
small parts in a number of televi
sion dramas in the '50s, so he
must have recognized Michael
Dorsey and his students and
friends, who sweat to be truthful
and do honest work but have to
confront the invariably brutal
and generally fruitless cycle of
auditions while they pay the rent
with restaurant jobs. The movie
begins with a sequence in which
Michael's feverish exhortations
to his students to set no limits on
their talents — a good actor, he
tells them, can act anything —
are intercut with his own disap
pointments at audition after au
dition, his failure to convince di
rectors that he can make himself

right for the parts they say he's
too old, or too short, or too tall
for. This scene, and a party scene

Dustin Hoffman belongs to
one of the most phenomenal
generations of actors this coun
try has ever seen — the group
that headed into their 40s a
couple of years ago — and he
may end up with the most im
pressive record of all of them. In
his decade and a half in movies,
he has rarely given a bad per
formance, and despite his dis
tinctive vocal mannerisms, he
has succeeded with amazing con
sistency in finding new ways of
approaching new roles. Because
he is so well known for being
temperamental and exacting, we
can't help seeing him in Michael
Dorsey — but Michael Dorsey is
also a brilliant actor, and when
he finally becomes a star, as
Dorothy, no one can deny that
he has earned it. You have to have
patience for Hoffman when he
stands up at the Academy
Awards ceremony and lauds
struggling young actors with
what sounds like condescension,
but when you see his work in
Tootsie and Kramer vs. Kramer
and the sadly neglected Straight
Time (in which he plays an ex
con), you can appreciate that he
embodies the principles Michael
endorses. Hoffman plays
Dorothy as a southern belle with
a hidden spring that snaps when
she's pushed too far; that's her
tie with Michael. Otherwise, she
resides in the areas of his person
ality that he doesn't have time to
explore in his masculine life:

she's sweet, attentive, emotion
ally generous. As much as I've
enjoyed Hoffman in comedies
before this, I've never seen any
thing like his delicacy in the
scene in which Les indicates his

admiration for Dorothy, or the
scenes with Jessica Lange, in
which he longs to make love to
her and can't. In one of them,
Julie confesses that knowing
Dorothy has made her feel
lonely, as if she wanted some
thing she can't have; Michael
leans forward to kiss her, and she
pulls back, confused and upset.
It's a Shakespearean moment.
Of course, these scenes
couldn't work without Jessica

Lange. Hoffman has been rec
ognized for his talent since his
first starring role (in The
Graduate), but Lange is only be
ginning to receive critical atten
tion, in Tootsie and in the title
role in Frances, which played
limited engagements in New
York and Los Angeles around
Christmas in order to qualify for
the Oscars. But she was delight
ful in King Kong — though for
some reason most people who
saw her in it assumed that she
was funny by accident — and her

intense, erotic performance in
the recent remake of The Post
man Always Rings Twice wan the
only thing that made it worth se
eing. In Tootsie, she plays a
woman who is so effortlessly
sexy and so dreamy — Julie swal
lows bits of her sentences, as if
she weren't aware that she
hadn't completed them — that
men don't give her credit for
brains or talent or stability, but
she holds down a tough acting

enjoyed Hoffman in comedies
before this, I've never seen any
thing like his delicacy in the
scene in which Les indicates his

admiration for Dorothy, or the
scenes with Jessica Lange, in
which he longs to make love to
her and can't. In one of them,
Julie confesses that knowing
Dorothy has made her feel
lonely, as if she wanted some
thing she can't have; Michael
leans forward to kiss her, and she
pulls back, confused and upset.
It's a Shakespearean moment.
Of course, these scenes
couldn't work without Jessica

Lange. Hoffman has been rec
ognized for his talent since his
first starring role (in The
Graduate), but Lange is only be
ginning to receive critical atten
tion, in Tootsie and in the title
role in Frances, which played
limited engagements in New
York and Los Angeles around
Christmas in order to qualify for
the Oscars. But she was delight
ful in King Kong — though for
some reason most people who
saw her in it assumed that she
was funny by accident — and her

intense, erotic performance in
the recent remake of The Post
man Always Rings Twice wan the
only thing that made it worth se
eing. In Tootsie, she plays a
woman who is so effortlessly
sexy and so dreamy — Julie swal
lows bits of her sentences, as if
she weren't aware that she
hadn't completed them — that
men don't give her credit for
brains or talent or stability, but
she holds down a tough acting
job while raising a child on her
own, and when Dorothy begins
to coach her (Michael can't re
sist) her acting really improves.
Michael is attracted to Julie be
cause she's gorgeous, but as he
gets to know her, as Dorothy, in
ways that would be denied
Michael, he really falls in love
with her; that's the great, satisfy
ing joke the whole movie hinges
on. And Lange provides Julie
with as much depth as the movie
needs.
One can find elements of
Tootsie to complain about —
chiefly that since Michael's love
affair with Sandy, which exists as
a matter of narrative conveni
ence, is the only example we
have of his behavior toward
women before his relationship

with Julie, we can't see the de
velopment of his understanding
and sensitivity as clearly as we
might like. (He doesn't seem in
sensitive even in his pre-Dorothy
scenes.) But to cavil when you're
faced with a comedy of real sen
sibility seems like ingratitude.
Tootsie is about people who can't
be pinned down or slotted be
cause they keep changing; it cel
ebrates the joy of constant mo
tion, constant surprise. Appro
priately, it brings out the best in
everyone associated with it.

Dustin Hoffman and Jessica Lange in Tootsie.

For the first hour, the beauti
fully balanced new comedy
Tootsie reminds you of Some
Like It Hot, with Dustin
Hoffman in a role that merges
the Jack Lemmon and Tony Cur
tis parts, and Jessica Lange
standing in for Marilyn Monroe.
Hoffman plays Michael Dorsey,
a gifted actor and teacher of act
ing who can't get a job because,
his agents tells him, he's too dif
ficult: he quarrels with all his di
rectors, even when he shoots
commercials. So when one of his
students, Sandy (Teri Garr), is
turned down for ajole in a day
time soap because she doesn't fit
the "type" demanded, Michael
shows up at the studio dressed
and made up as a woman — he
calls himself Dorothy Michaels
— and talks his way into an audi
tion. He performs with so much
conviction that he lands the part
(as a newly hired hospital ad
ministrator in something called
Southwest General), and almost
immediately falls in love with
Julie (Jessica Lange), an actress
on the show who is attached to its
chauvinistic director (Dabney
Coleman).
Tootsie has Vaudeville bits in it
that I haven't seen since Some
Like It Hot — like Dorothy walk
ing into a women's washroom
and apologizing, and a running

Dustin Hoffman has to exercise all his
actors wiles to keep up with the game,
while he is discovering layers of sensitivity
in himself he never knew existed. And
Tootsie manages to get cleverer, funnier and
more moving as its complications mount.

gag based on her masculine
strength -— and they still work
surprisingly well. But as the
movie continues, it grows out of
this tradition — and grows and
grows. It's a knockout — and it's
the first comedy ever made
about sex roles with ideas that
you don't feel embarrassed
about discussing afterwards.
Blake Edwards' Victor /Victoria,
which came out last winter,
claimed tc say something about
male and female sexuality, but in
the end the "daring" heroine,
Julie Andrews, who disguised
herself as a female impersonator
in order to get a singing job,
turned out to be as conven
tionally feminine as any 1950s
leading lady, taking her virile

man (James Garner) to suffer
through an opera while his taste
in entertainment — a boxing
match — made her cringe and
hide her eyes. But Tootsie
doesn't compromise itself. The

structure demands that as
Michael gets himself deeper and
deeper into this sexual and pro
fessional deception — as
Dorothy becomes the darling of
daytime television and she and
Julie become more and more in
timate friends — he has to exer
cise all his actor's wiles to keep
up with the game, while he is dis
covering layers of sensitivity in
himself he never knew existed.
And Tootsie manages to get cle
verer, funnier and more moving
as its complications mount.
The screenwriting credit goes
jointly to Larry Gelbart (A
Funny Thing Happened on the
Way to the Forum and Sly Fox on
Broadway, M*A *S*H on TV,
Movie Movie on screen) and

Murray Schisgal (who wrote The
Typists, The Tiger and Luv for
the stage, as well as a 1969 Dus
tin Hoffman vehicle called
Jimmy Shine), but apparently half
the talented writers in Hol
lywood worked on it, including
Elaine May and Barry Levinson.
Often a script that has made the
rounds in this way has a desper
ate quality about it, as if
everyone had tried in vain to sal
vage it, but Tootsie feels like a
community effort — it's been
blessed with the work of many
highly skilled hands, male and
female. I would guess that when
all these contributors saw what
the director, Sydney Pollack, had
done with it, they were all proud
fo have shared in its construc
tion. Pollack has a reputation for
bringing out the best in some of
the actors he's worked with —
Jane Fonda and Gig Young in
They Shoot Horses, Don't They?,
Robert Redford and Barbra
Streisand in The Way We Were,
Paul Newman in last year's Ab
sence of Malice — and there isn't
a bum performance in Tootsie,
from Hoffman and Lange
through the supporting cast: Bill
Murray as Michael's roommate
Jeff, an aspiritlg playwright; Teri.
Garr as Sandy; Charles Durning
as Julie's father Les, who falls for
Dorothy; George Gaynes as the
dim, pompous, narcisstic star of

Southwest General. (The worst
that can be said is that Dabney
Coleman, as the television di
rector, repeats his role from 9 to
5. Pollack even turns in an excel
lent performance himself, as
Michael's exasperated agent).
But even the best parts of They
Shoot Horses and The Way We
Were don't prepare us for the
marvellous way in which Pollack
has shaped Tootsie, which builds
to the most uproarious climax
any American movie has given
us in years, or for his rich, sym
pathetic treatment of the theatri
cal milieu where the screenplay
is located. Pollack trained as an
actor at New York's Neighbor
hood Playhouse and appeared in
small parts in a number of televi
sion dramas in the '50s, so he
must have recognized Michael
Dorsey and his students and
friends, who sweat to be truthful
and do honest work but have to
confront the invariably brutal
and generally fruitless cycle of
auditions while they pay the rent
with restaurant jobs. The movie
begins with a sequence in which
Michael's feverish exhortations
to his students to set no limits on
their talents — a good actor, he
tells them, can act anything —
are intercut with his own disap
pointments at audition after au
dition, his failure to convince di
rectors that he can make himself

right for the parts they say he's
too old, or too short, or too tall
for. This scene, and a party scene
that follows in which Jeff gets
drunk and verbalizes his crazy
dreams of an avant-garde thea-

phenomenal generations of actors this

Dustin Hoffman belongs to
one of the most phenomenal
generations of actors this coun
try has ever seen — the group
that headed into their 40s a
couple of years ago — and he
may end up with the most im
pressive record of all of them. In
his decade and a half in movies,
he has rarely given a bad per
formance, and despite his dis
tinctive vocal mannerisms, he
has succeeded with amazing con
sistency in finding new ways of
approaching new roles. Because
he is so well known for being
temperamental and exacting, we
can't help seeing him in Michael
Dorsey — but Michael Dorsey is
also a brilliant actor, and when
he finally becomes a star, as
Dorothy, no one can deny that
he has earned it. You have to have
patience for Hoffman when he
stands up at the Academy
Awards ceremony and lauds
struggling young actors with
what sounds like condescension,
but when you see his work in
Tootsie and Kramer vs. Kramer
and the sadly neglected Straight
Time (in which he plays an ex
con), you can appreciate that he
embodies the principles Michael
endorses. Hoffman plays
Dorothy as a southern belle with
a hidden spring that snaps when
she's pushed too far; that's her
tie with Michael. Otherwise, she
resides in the areas of his person
ality that he doesn't have time to
explore in his masculine life:

she's sweet, attentive, emotion
ally generous. As much as I've
