# The
						J. Geils Band shticks around long enough to relax
## 
### JEFF SANTOSUOSSO 
Yet another J. Geils Band live
album graces the record stores.
Their third live effort. Show
time!, fulfills the demand for
even more live Geils following
their American and European
tours. The brunt of the material
is drawn from their three latest
and most popular albums.
Sanctuary, Love Slinks, and
Freeze Frame. With these three
records came real national and
international exposure and real
demand for more of the band's
unique stage antics as a party
band.
Geils has always been a strong
(mostly sell-out) draw in the
Boston area. But is due only to
recent developments that
they've become a national
phenomenon. With Sanctuary's
release came the hits "One Last
Kiss" and "Sanctuary." Love
Stinks brought with it the single
of the same name, "Just Can't
Wait," and other popular offer
ings of Geils' harmonica/
keyboard rhythm and blues. The
whole formula crystalized in
Freeze Frame, as "Centerfold"
hit number one nationally. The

rest is record-industry history.
But Bostonians have always
flocked to Geils" live perform
ances, ahead of Muncie. Ind. in
tribute to their own band. Even
before Sanctuary, Peter Wolf
and the band were filling the
Boston Garden, Providence
Civic Center and Cape Cod Col
iseum. Geils had had some na
tional success with "House
Party," "Lookin' for a Love,"
and "Give it to Me." Yet od
dities such as Magic Dick's har
monica solo, "Whammer Jam
mer," heavy rhythm and blues,
like "Detroit Breakdown," and
general looniness, like Wolfs
slapstick ad-libbing remained
mainly a New England
phenomenon. People from Ban
gor, Maine to New Haven,
Conn., to Syracuse. N.Y. could
recite Wolfs "Raputa the Be
auta" story. During the early and
mid-'7os, Geils in the Boston
area was like Bob Seger in the
Detroit area during the late '60s
and early '70s.
But now of course, everyone
wants to hear them. They've an
swered with Showtime!, which

was recorded following their re
turn to the United States. Oddly,
the concert dates were in De
troit, not Boston. Wolf has ex
plained that the demand was too
high to delay the taping until
Geils' Christmas shows in Bos
ton. Too bad, the Boston shows
were luscious. Regardless, the
Motor City provided a hospita
ble setting for Geils' mayhem.
After cruising right through
"Jus' Can't Stop Me" and "Just
Can't Wait," Peter Wolf begins
his antics, dedicating "Till the
Walls Come Tumbling Down" to
"the beer drinkers out there"
and leading the "ooh-yeahs"
that make the song so popular in
concert. This is the song in which
Wolf warns that, "You've got to
brush your teeth with rock 'n'
roll."
Despite the pensive "I'm Fal
ling," so reminiscent of the
pretty, slower numbers like
"Theresa," the album never lets
go of the party-band image that
Geils has attained. Wolf dedi
cates a good chunk of the album
to "Love Rap," the story of that
"jive fool" Adam who used to
"wear a designer figleaf." He re

counts how Adam came to chow
a huge pizza at the Garden of
Eden 7-11 aftej; he had gotten
stoned. On Blow Your Face Out,
Wolf "forgets" name
and calls her "Raputa the Be
auta." This time, the amnesia is
directed at "that Mexican dip."
"Holy Guacamqle."
The rap is interrupted as Eve,
Adam's "bitch,"veils that "Love
stinks!" The title is split in two,
with "love" ending side one and
"stinks" opening side two and
ushering the hit of the same
name. Cute technique.
Following the anthem, "I
Do," one of those happy '50s
tunes that is full of "do-wah's,"
forces you to dance. Later, you
want to dance just like Wolf in
the video of "Centerfold" as he
breaks into the dumber One hit.
Wolf keeps it going in the closing
"Land of a Thousand Dances."
Here, he instructs us that we've
"got to do the Pony like Bony
Moroni."
So, the album is mainly just a
fun audio version of a Geils con
cert. The older, raspier numbers
from Blow Your Face Out and
Full House Live are absent. This

album has taken on a more
humorous and self-lampooning
tone. It is no accident that
Adam's pizza has "No An
chovies, Please." It is no accident
that Adam calls Eve " Raputa the
Beauta." The rock 'n' roll is
faithful, but the album eschews
every trace of anything resembl
ing remorse. Instead, we get
schtick, like the album's cover

which tells us that the contents
are "entertaining, informative,
fun."
Geils may have built their
reputation on classic rhythm and
blues, but they hit the heights of
popular music fame through fun,
danceable numbers and the
goofy schtick of Peter Wolf.
While an occasional purist may
be lamenting the sometimes

poor mixing, most people will de
light in the emergence of an en
tertaining party band that is
worth its weight in gold records.
Make no mistake: the band has
been working very hard at de
veloping theii craft for over 10
years and is well-deserving of
some fun and relaxation. And it's
all the more interesting when the
guys share it with theiraudience.
