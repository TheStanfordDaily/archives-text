## the 						value of technology 
### MARIA VELLANI 
in a musical age ot increasing
technological advancements,
one may fear that the creative
human element will soon be per
fected right out of music, leaving
a manufactured sound with all
the perfection and uniqueness of
an assembly line. While this may
be true for some groups, there is
new hope from across the Atlan
tic: Saga. After four successful
albums in Europe, Saga's newest
album Worlds Apart is their in
troductiofftOthe AnierJcaTirntft
ical scene. Instead of rejecting
the computerized sound that has
been threatening to destroy the
richness of music quality. Saga
has learned to use it to their ben
efit. The outcome is a hybrid
type of music somewhere in be
tween Journey and Pink Floyd. It
is a uniquely modern sound and
the album Worlds Apart uses this
sound to explore the many as
pects of modern life. It is an
album for and about modern
man. In every song the individual
is put in a hopeless situation with
no way out.
The album's opening song "on
the loose" starts out with
feverish intensity, grabbing the
listener's attention. An array of
computerized sounds are skill
fully belted out to create a
futuristic aura which pervades

the entire album. The confused,
destructive, fast pace of modern
life is successfully mimicked by
the song's rapid beat and almost
alien sound of its instrumentals.
This high-pitched excitement
that seems to be heading toward
self destruction is prevalent in
almost all the songs. Even in the
lyrics,"On the Loose" leaves the
listener no doubt that this is an
album about the crazed and de
structive pace of modern life:
"The time we feel most stable is
the time we're heading for the
wall /And there's every indica
tion that we're heading for a
fall."
In "Framed" the individual
has once more been put in a posi
tion of isolation and confusion.
This time a new devise is intro
duced in addition to the instru
mentals and artificial sounds to
create a disoriented atmosphere.
A conversation between the lead
singer and some omnipotent rep
resentative of authority is re
peated during the chorus, "I've
been framed /No you were to
blame." Although the idea is
there, musically this is not en
tirely successful. Yet the group
quickly recovers with "Times
Up," an apt description of the
boring, bureaucratic nature of
modern existence. The constant
and almost repetitive beat helps

to portray the dull, trapped lives
being described, "Nothing ever
changes from day to day /I've
just been guarding this desk for
you."
The tone of the album changes
slightly with "The Interview."
This one way dialogue is a series
of questions addressed to an
older leader (politician) asking
why he won't resign in favor of a
younger man: "How long do you
think we'll last living with con
tinuous past /As you stare at us
we say you're looking less like
me each day." Modern times
demand a leadership of modern
men who understand the neuro
tic pace of that type of life.
Things have obviously changed
and now ruler and ruled are
"worlds apart." This predomi
nant theme is captured on the
album cover: a close up of a
woman wearing mirrorized
sun-glasses; on one lens there is
an ancient map and on the other
a photograph of a galaxy.
The rest of the album is quie
ter than the first part but the style
and theme remain the same.
"Conversations" for example
has only one line while the music
itself conveys the disjointed lack
of communication. In Worlds
Apart, Saga has proven it
self to be a top-notch band.
