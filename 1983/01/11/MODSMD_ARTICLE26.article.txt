# Neil Young's flipa-coin iconoclasm

### MIKE STERNICK 
Like sushi or Stanford Univer
sity, Neil Young's latest album
Trans is not the easiest thing in
the world to get into. Every bit as
daring as Nebraska, Young's
Redwood City of tomorrow
seems light years away from
Bruce Springsteen's Atlantic
City of today.
Arguably Young's most ad
venturesome and unexpected ef
fort in a career that has turned
the unexpected into merely the
unanticipated. Trans is Young's

times disappointing, certain to alienate

strongest record of the '80s,
which doesn't say much in itself.
Indeed, the initial reaction of
everyone I know to this album is
one of disbelief that Young is ac
tually doing this kind of "trashy"
electronic music.
Well, let's focus on the strong
points first:
1) He could have been cheap
and not included a lyric sheet;
2) He could have done a syn
thetic remake of "T-Bone" in
stead of "Mr. Soul";
3) Most of the album is dance
able.
Trans ultimately boils down to
a typical Neil Young
"album — at times brilliant, at
times disappointing, certain to
alienate prior fans while bringing
a new audience into the fold.
As suggested by the intriguing
cover artwork, the album's
theme is the dichotomy between
old/new, past/future, country/
city, De Soto/De Lorean, Perry
Como/Brian Eno. Like 1977's
American Stars V Bars, 1978's
Rust Never Sleeps, and 1980's
Hawk and Doves, Trans stylisti
cally is two albums in one. Three
pf tl !h£ nine songs were cut in
this summer using " tradi
tional" instruments, with the
remainder recorded at Young's
ranch featuring a Synclavier syn
thesizer and two Vocoders. Not
surprisingly, the results are un
even.
For the most part, the Hawaii
numbers are safe and pleasant.
" Hold On To Your Love" is eas
ily dismissed, both musically and
lyrically. "Like An Inca" could
have been the tour-de-force of

the album — a churning
maelstrom of raucus guitarwork
in the tradition of "Cortez the
Killer" and " Like A Hurricane."
Featuring Young on a furiously
tortured lead guitar, "Inca" was
the highlight of Young's recent
California and European tours.
Unfortunately, the studio ver
sion contained on Trans lacks the
firepower of the live version,
possibly due to Young switching
to acoustic guitar while leaving
the lead chores to Nils Lofgren.
Still, "Inca" remains a stunning

narrative, adopting the unique
viewpoint of a condor reminis
cing to a preying mantis about
the Aztecs and the Incas. The
result is the most frightening
concept of nuclear holocaust yet
recorded by anyone. "Who put
the bomb /On the sacred altar?
/Why should we die /If it comes
our way?") Even more amazing
is that "Inca" was slated for re
lease seven years ago on 1975's
Zuma. How many gems like this
remain buried in Young's legen
dary stockpile of more than 200
unreleased songs?
"Little Thing Called Love,"
the album's single, is a rollicking
country-rocker and the best
example of the tightness of
Young's recently-formed back
up band of Lofgren, Ben Keith
on steel, Joe Lala on percussion,
Bruce (Buffalo Springfield)
Palmer on bass and Ralph
(Crazy Horse) Molina on drums.
The tune is a funky stomper with
the rhythm section laying down a
steady beat beneath Keith's
superb slide playing.
Among the eight or nine songs
recorded at the Hawaii sessions
was "If You Got Love." Al
though it appears on the lyric
sheet, the song was subsequently
purged from the final mix by
Young this fall. Fear not, con
sumer — Young's new record
company has gone out of its way
to warn the buyer by placing a
finely printed notice upon the
album cover. Having heard the
song from Young's shows this
summer, I can agree with his de
cision to keep it off the record,
but I'm" disappointed that it

wasn't replaced by the repor
tedly classic and still unreleased
"Island In The Sun" from the
Hawaii sessions.
The rest of the album is filled
with what Young has referred to
as "Trans-music." Vocals dis
torted through Vocoders, guitars
altered through synthesizers,
pre-programmed drumbeats in
cessantly pounding — like it or
not, this may be the future of
rock 'n' roll. Although Young's
trademark nasal whine is all but
neutered under the treatments,
the urgency of some of his earlier
work like "Helpless" still man
ages to shine through.
Words alone simply cannot do
justice to these concoctions; nor
can they be dismissed by main
taining that live music is better.
"Computer Age" is extremely
accessible, featuring a snappy
hook and some nifty guitar play
ing. Describing the corner traffic
signal as a life-and-death situa
tion, the tune boasts the most
tongue-in-cheek verse on the al
bum: "You need me /Like ugly
needs a mirror." Regrettably the
luster of the new-fangled elec
tronic sound fades in "We R In
Control" and "Computer Cow
boy," both of which are saddled
with less-than-inspired lyrics.
Young sings of standing out in
the hot desert sun; it seems like
he composed these two ditties
while he was there.
"Transformer Man" has been
called the best song Young has
written in the last 10 years by no
less of an authority than the au
thor himself! At any rate, it is a
poignantly beautiful tribute to
Young's four-year old son Ben,
who has been forced to bear the
chains of a serious illness since
birth. "Transformer Man /Your
eyes are shining on a beam
/Through the galaxy of love."
You just can't find those
thoughts on an AC/DC album.
Bound to be castigated by rad
ical feminists from Yale to the
University of Minnesota, "Sam
ple And Hold" describes the so
ciety of tomorrow, where a man
prefers a "unit" to a wife.

"Satisfction guaranteed /Perfec
tion in every detail," Young
specifies his desires for a "new
design" that has "Hair-Blonde
/Eyes-Blue /Weight-110 /Mood
Code-Rotary Adjustible," and
out comes his "mate," waiting to
be energized. Sounds like a can
didate for the white-suited men
with butterfly nets, until you
start to wonder if the synthetic
heart pictured on the back of the
album is the same one that Bar
ney Clark currently walks

around with.
The beat is every bit as catchy
as "Computer Age," ending up
segueing into a remake of "Mr.
Soul," Young's hit of 15 years
ago when he was in the Buffalo
Springfield. The new version
contains a note-for-note replica
of the original's classic guitar
solo, while pulsating with the
dance rhythm of New Wave syn
thesizers.
So there you have it. Even
though there are some disap

pointments, that is to be ex
pected from any Young product,
and I like the album for its suc
cesses. When most current al
bums are lucky to have three
halfway decent songs, Trans has
twice that amount by my
scorecard. Neil Young's willing
ness to innovate, to go beyond
what is "expected" of him is cer
tainly laudable in this era of cor
porate rock, and his "Trans
m\isic" is more vital to my ears
than any recent efforts from his

dinosaur contemporaries like
Crosby, Stills and Nash.
"Is it strange I should change
/I don't know" Young rhetori
cally wonders, and the beauty of
the statement is that the answer
doesn't concern him in the least.
I'm already looking forward to
Young's next effort. I would ex
pect a joint collaboration with
Brian Eno, but then again I
wouldn't be surprised to find an
album of gospel music as an al
ternative.

ical feminists from Yale to the
University of Minnesota, "Sam
ple And Hold" describes the so
ciety of tomorrow, where a man
prefers a "unit" to a wife.

"Satisfction guaranteed /Perfec
tion in every detail," Young
specifies his desires for a "new
design" that has "Hair-Blonde
/Eyes-Blue /Weight-110 /Mood
Code-Rotary Adjustible," and
out comes his "mate," waiting to
be energized. Sounds like a can
didate for the white-suited men
with butterfly nets, until you
start to wonder if the synthetic
heart pictured on the back of the
album is the same one that Bar
ney Clark currently walks

around with.
The beat is every bit as catchy
as "Computer Age," ending up
segueing into a remake of "Mr.
Soul," Young's hit of 15 years
ago when he was in the Buffalo
Springfield. The new version
contains a note-for-note replica
of the original's classic guitar
solo, while pulsating with the
dance rhythm of New Wave syn
thesizers.
So there you have it. Even
though there are some disap

pointments, that is to be ex
pected from any Young product,
and I like the album for its suc
cesses. When most current al
bums are lucky to have three
halfway decent songs, Trans has
twice that amount by my
scorecard. Neil Young's willing
ness to innovate, to go beyond
what is "expected" of him is cer
tainly laudable in this era of cor
porate rock, and his "Trans
m\isic" is more vital to my ears
than any recent efforts from his

dinosaur contemporaries like
Crosby, Stills and Nash.
"Is it strange I should change
/I don't know" Young rhetori
cally wonders, and the beauty of
the statement is that the answer
doesn't concern him in the least.
I'm already looking forward to

"album — at times brilliant, at
times disappointing, certain to

a new audience into the fold.
As suggested by the intriguing
cover artwork, the album's
theme is the dichotomy between
old/new, past/future, country/
city, De Soto/De Lorean, Perry
Como/Brian Eno. Like 1977's
American Stars V Bars, 1978's
Rust Never Sleeps, and 1980's
Hawk and Doves, Trans stylisti
cally is two albums in one. Three
pf tl !h£ nine songs were cut in
this summer using " tradi
tional" instruments, with the
remainder recorded at Young's
ranch featuring a Synclavier syn
thesizer and two Vocoders. Not
surprisingly, the results are un
even.
For the most part, the Hawaii
numbers are safe and pleasant.
" Hold On To Your Love" is eas
ily dismissed, both musically and
lyrically. "Like An Inca" could
have been the tour-de-force of

the album — a churning
maelstrom of raucus guitarwork
in the tradition of "Cortez the
Killer" and " Like A Hurricane."
Featuring Young on a furiously
tortured lead guitar, "Inca" was
the highlight of Young's recent
California and European tours.
Unfortunately, the studio ver
sion contained on Trans lacks the
firepower of the live version,
possibly due to Young switching
to acoustic guitar while leaving
the lead chores to Nils Lofgren.
Still, "Inca" remains a stunning

narrative, adopting the unique
viewpoint of a condor reminis
cing to a preying mantis about
the Aztecs and the Incas. The
result is the most frightening
concept of nuclear holocaust yet
recorded by anyone. "Who put
the bomb /On the sacred altar?
/Why should we die /If it comes
our way?") Even more amazing
is that "Inca" was slated for re
lease seven years ago on 1975's
Zuma. How many gems like this
remain buried in Young's legen
dary stockpile of more than 200
unreleased songs?
"Little Thing Called Love,"
the album's single, is a rollicking
country-rocker and the best
example of the tightness of
Young's recently-formed back
up band of Lofgren, Ben Keith
on steel, Joe Lala on percussion,
Bruce (Buffalo Springfield)
Palmer on bass and Ralph
(Crazy Horse) Molina on drums.
The tune is a funky stomper with
the rhythm section laying down a
steady beat beneath Keith's
superb slide playing.
Among the eight or nine songs
recorded at the Hawaii sessions
was "If You Got Love." Al
though it appears on the lyric
sheet, the song was subsequently
purged from the final mix by
Young this fall. Fear not, con
sumer — Young's new record
company has gone out of its way
to warn the buyer by placing a
finely printed notice upon the
album cover. Having heard the
song from Young's shows this
summer, I can agree with his de
cision to keep it off the record,
but I'm" disappointed that it

wasn't replaced by the repor
tedly classic and still unreleased
"Island In The Sun" from the
Hawaii sessions.
The rest of the album is filled
with what Young has referred to
as "Trans-music." Vocals dis
torted through Vocoders, guitars
altered through synthesizers,
pre-programmed drumbeats in
cessantly pounding — like it or
not, this may be the future of
rock 'n' roll. Although Young's
trademark nasal whine is all but
neutered under the treatments,
the urgency of some of his earlier
work like "Helpless" still man
ages to shine through.
Words alone simply cannot do
justice to these concoctions; nor
can they be dismissed by main
taining that live music is better.
"Computer Age" is extremely
accessible, featuring a snappy
hook and some nifty guitar play
ing. Describing the corner traffic
signal as a life-and-death situa
tion, the tune boasts the most
tongue-in-cheek verse on the al
bum: "You need me /Like ugly
needs a mirror." Regrettably the
luster of the new-fangled elec
tronic sound fades in "We R In
Control" and "Computer Cow
boy," both of which are saddled
with less-than-inspired lyrics.
Young sings of standing out in
the hot desert sun; it seems like
he composed these two ditties
while he was there.
"Transformer Man" has been
called the best song Young has
written in the last 10 years by no
less of an authority than the au
thor himself! At any rate, it is a
poignantly beautiful tribute to
Young's four-year old son Ben,
who has been forced to bear the
chains of a serious illness since
birth. "Transformer Man /Your
eyes are shining on a beam
/Through the galaxy of love."
You just can't find those
thoughts on an AC/DC album.
Bound to be castigated by rad
ical feminists from Yale to the
University of Minnesota, "Sam

ciety of tomorrow, where a man
prefers a "unit" to a wife.

album cover. Having heard the
song from Young's shows this
summer, I can agree with his de
cision to keep it off the record,
but I'm" disappointed that it

wasn't replaced by the repor
tedly classic and still unreleased
"Island In The Sun" from the
Hawaii sessions.
The rest of the album is filled
with what Young has referred to
as "Trans-music." Vocals dis
torted through Vocoders, guitars
altered through synthesizers,
pre-programmed drumbeats in
cessantly pounding — like it or
not, this may be the future of
rock 'n' roll. Although Young's
trademark nasal whine is all but
neutered under the treatments,
the urgency of some of his earlier
work like "Helpless" still man
ages to shine through.
Words alone simply cannot do
justice to these concoctions; nor
can they be dismissed by main
taining that live music is better.
"Computer Age" is extremely
accessible, featuring a snappy
hook and some nifty guitar play
ing. Describing the corner traffic
signal as a life-and-death situa
tion, the tune boasts the most
tongue-in-cheek verse on the al
bum: "You need me /Like ugly
needs a mirror." Regrettably the
luster of the new-fangled elec
tronic sound fades in "We R In
Control" and "Computer Cow
boy," both of which are saddled
with less-than-inspired lyrics.
Young sings of standing out in
the hot desert sun; it seems like
he composed these two ditties
while he was there.
"Transformer Man" has been
called the best song Young has
written in the last 10 years by no
less of an authority than the au
thor himself! At any rate, it is a
poignantly beautiful tribute to
Young's four-year old son Ben,
who has been forced to bear the
chains of a serious illness since
birth. "Transformer Man /Your
eyes are shining on a beam
/Through the galaxy of love."
You just can't find those
thoughts on an AC/DC album.
Bound to be castigated by rad
ical feminists from Yale to the
University of Minnesota, "Sam
ple And Hold" describes the so
ciety of tomorrow, where a man
prefers a "unit" to a wife.

"Satisfction guaranteed /Perfec
tion in every detail," Young
specifies his desires for a "new
design" that has "Hair-Blonde
/Eyes-Blue /Weight-110 /Mood
Code-Rotary Adjustible," and
out comes his "mate," waiting to
be energized. Sounds like a can
didate for the white-suited men
with butterfly nets, until you
start to wonder if the synthetic
heart pictured on the back of the
album is the same one that Bar
ney Clark currently walks

around with.
The beat is every bit as catchy
as "Computer Age," ending up
segueing into a remake of "Mr.
Soul," Young's hit of 15 years
ago when he was in the Buffalo
Springfield. The new version
contains a note-for-note replica
of the original's classic guitar
solo, while pulsating with the
dance rhythm of New Wave syn
thesizers.
So there you have it. Even
though there are some disap

pointments, that is to be ex
pected from any Young product,
and I like the album for its suc
cesses. When most current al
bums are lucky to have three
halfway decent songs, Trans has
twice that amount by my
scorecard. Neil Young's willing
ness to innovate, to go beyond
what is "expected" of him is cer
tainly laudable in this era of cor
porate rock, and his "Trans
m\isic" is more vital to my ears
than any recent efforts from his

dinosaur contemporaries like
Crosby, Stills and Nash.
"Is it strange I should change
/I don't know" Young rhetori
cally wonders, and the beauty of
the statement is that the answer
doesn't concern him in the least.
I'm already looking forward to
Young's next effort. I would ex
pect a joint collaboration with
Brian Eno, but then again I
wouldn't be surprised to find an
album of gospel music as an al
ternative.
