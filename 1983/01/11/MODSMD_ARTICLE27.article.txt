# Today: Yet Another Runoff Election
## 
### 
There will be yet another election
for editor of The Stanford Daily to
day from noon until 10 p.m., with
voting including those editorial and
business staff members on the vot
ing list or who are qualified to vote
under the by-laws (see the editor if
you-are unsure).
The candidates remain Doug Jehl
and Karen Springen, and both have
agreed to have today be the day of
the second runoff election. This
election is necessary because
neither candidate received a majori
ty of the votes cast, which is the re
quirement for the editor's election.
The vote was further complicated by
votes cast for neither candidate and
irregularities worthy of the best that
student government has to offer.
May the best candidate win, and
may both survive the ordeal.
