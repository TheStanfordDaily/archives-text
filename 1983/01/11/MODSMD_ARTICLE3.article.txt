Armed forces may not receive pay raise
Washington — The White House, as part of its all-bets-are-off reassess
ment of the fiscal 1984 budget, is challenging a 7.6 percent pay raise the Pen
tagon had penciled in for the 2 million men and women in uniform effective
next Oct. I, defense officials said yesterday.
The Pentagon had estimated 7.6 percent was necessary to keep the all-vol
unteer armed forces from dropping behind next year's likely inflation rate
and private sector pav.
In a new effort to find defense cuts, however, the Office of Management
and Budget has asked Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger his views on a
number of pav alternatives, ranging from an outright freeze to a raise this
year of only 4 percent, the same as last year.
But defense officials said yesterday there is now almost no hope for a 7.6
percent pa v raise in the budget the president is scheduled to send to Congress
Jan. 31. One reason is that the likely inflation rate now is lower than when the
budget was first drawn up. Another is the soaring budget deficit, and an in
sistence in Congress that there be cuts in defense as well as domestic pro
grams.
Also unclear is how large a raise Reagan will propose for the government's
civilian employees next Oct. I. They, too, got 4 percent last Oct. I.
Pentagon manpower officials said raises of 5 percent would probably keep
military people even next fiscal year with civilians holding comparable jobs.
Weinberger is expected to fight any White House efforts to go much below a
5 percent raise on grounds that it would hurt the all-volunteer military force
Reagan has bragged about recently.
James Baker states Donovan should resign
W ashington — White House chief of staff James Baker has told a Texas
newspaper that Secretary of Labor Raymond Donovan should resign, mak
ing public Baker's long-held opinion that Donovan is a serious political lia
bility to President Reagan.
"Ray Donovan shouldn't be in here," Baker said in an interview con
ducted during a turkev shoot on his south Texas ranch during Christmas
week. "What's he thinking about? He's got his good name now. He's vin
dicated. Now he ought to do what's right for the president.
Baker's comments, published Sunday in The
Dallas Morning News, brought into the open the
dissatisfaction he and others in the White House
long have expressed privately about some Cabinet
members, particularlv Donovan and Interior Sec
retary James Watt. But these Cabinet members
have defied attempts to induce them to quit be
cause of their apparent belief that they still enjoy
the support of the president.
Yesterday, Reagan said he "regretted" the Tex
as newspaper storv, expressed his confidence in
Donovan and pronounced the incident closed.
Donovan issued a statement saying comments
such as Baker's "serve the president poorly, and I
work for the president, not his staff."
Baker apologized, to Donovan and to Reagan,
that he had been quoted about his dim view of
Donovan's usefulness to the administration. But
he did not deny the accuracy of the quotation.
"I deeply regret that statements by me in a story
in Sunday's edition of The Dallas Morning News
reflect unfavorablv upon Secretary Donovan,"
Baker said in a two-sentence statement. "I have
apologized to the secretary this morning that such
views appeared in the public press, and I assured
him that he continues to enjoy the full support and
confidence of the president."
Sen. Baker to forego re-election
Washington — Senate Republican Leader How
ard Baker of Tennessee has told relatives and top
aides he has decided tentatively not to seek re-elec
tion in 1984, sources said yesterday.
Instead, Senate sources said Baker would serve
out the remainder of his term as the powerful GOP
floor leader, and explore the possibility of becom
ing a presidential contender in 1984 if President
Reagan does not run, or in 1988 if he does.
The sources, who asked to remain anonymous,
stressed the decision was tentative. Baker was in
Florida and could not be reached for comment.
Baker's spokesman, Tom Griscom, said, "It's
premature right now to speculate. Clearly, he has
not made up his mind and only he can make that
announcement.
It has been widely assumed in Congress that the
57-vear-old Baker would seek re-election to a
fourth term and hope to lead Republicans to con
tinued majority rule in the Senate. That would pre
sumably enable him to continue in his position as
Republican leader, a post he has used for the past
two years to push much of Reagan's programs
through the Senate.
Experts debate birth contol shot
Washington — A panel of scientists yesterday
considered whether American women could use
Depo-Provera injections as a three-month con
traceptive, while critics said they will sue the drug's
manufacturer for injuries it allegedly caused.
The public board of inquiry, convened by the
Food and Drug Administration, opened a week
long hearing on whether it should recommend use
of the drug as a contraceptive in the United States.
Depo-Provera, available in 84 countries and
used bv about 1.5 million women, has been op
posed since the FDA proposed allowing its use in
1974. It was blocked as a contraceptive in 1974 and
1978 by opponents concerned it may be linked to
cancer.
A favorable FDA ruling would not only have an

impact in the lucrative American drug market, but
also internationally, since some nations that
haven't approved the drug cite the U.S. govern
ment's reluctance to allow it.
White House considers tax hikes
Washington — President Reagan yesterday au
thorized his economic advisers to draw up possible
tax increases beginning in fiscal 1986 if needed to
bring down huge projected budget deficits, admin
istration officials reported.
While the president withheld a decision on the
provisional tax increase idea, he was described as
receptive after a morning meeting at which his ad
visers, led bv Treasury Secretary Donald Regan,
made the case for tax increases in later years.
The administration is said to be "fluid" on what
tax increases to propose, but officials said that Re
gan had ruled out two that had been discussed
before: wiping out the deductions for state sales
taxes and mortgage interest on second homes.
The administration officials are proposing a
"contingency plan" in which the tax increases
would take effect only if the deficit seemed likely to
exceed some fixed percentage of gross national
product — perhaps I or 2 percent — in the fiscal
years between 1986 and 1988 when the economy
would presumably be recovering. This would
translate into deficits of $50 billion to $ 100 billion.
Current administration estimates are that,
without further action, the deficit would rise to
$295 billion by 1988. This would be equivalent to
more than 5 percent of GNP. Administration of
ficials fear that such large deficits, if included as
projections in the fiscal 1984 budget proposal Rea
gan will send to Congress on Jan. 31, would jolt the
money markets and keep long-term interest rates
high, endangering economic recovery.
Administration to stop 'leaks'
Washington — At the insistence of President
Ronald Reagan, the White House set up pro
cedures yesterday to tighten its control over un
authorized leaks on presidential deliberations and
decisions.
"I've had it up to mv kiester with these leaks,"
White House communications director David
Gergen quoted the president as saying at a morn
ing meeting yesterday between Reagan and his sen
ior staff.
The president's expression of irritation referred
particularly to a spate of stories attributed to un
identified White House "sources" or "officials"
about purported presidential decisions on the 1984
budget, which is now reaching its final stage of
preparation.
The president, Gergen said in reference to these
unidentified White House officials or staffers,
"does not appreciate having people whom. I call
'free-lance artists' come out of a private meeting
and disclose the contents of the private meeting
before he or his advisers even have a chance to re
flect on what's going on."
Gergen's office was designated by the guidelines
issued late yesterday by James Baker, the White
House chief of staff, as the clearance point for re
quests for interviews with presidential aides.
Gergen told questioners he "would not call this a
gag rule."
Gergen denied that the decision to issue the
guidelines was related to an interview published in

Sunday's Dallas Morning News in which Baker
was quoted as telling a reporter that it was his per
sonal view that Raymond Donovan should resign
as Secretary of Labor now that his name has been
cleared of allegedly improper associations.
In a covering statement issued with the
guidelines. Baker noted that he was acting "at the
direction of the president." He said the instruc
tions "extend to the entire staff procedures that al
ready exist for a number of departments."
Baker added a sardonic reference to the Dallas
interview, conducted by a reporter while he and
Baker were in a turkey blind: "P.S. The president
has refused to make an exception for interviews in
turkey blinds.''
Baker's memo said the White House press office
"should remain the first stop for White House re
porters seeking information about the president's
policies and views."
Reagan recalls ambassador
Washington — The Reagan administration is re
calling and considering the replacement of its am
bassador to conventional arms reduction talks
with the Soviet Union and its Eastern European al
lies because he has made unauthorized statements
and has behaved erratically, according to informed
government officials.
Richard Starr, a former assistant director of the
conservative Hoover Institution at Stanford Uni
versity, was evpected at the White House today to
make an appeal to keep his job in a meeting with
William Clark, the president's national security af
fairs adviser.
Starr could not be reached for comment last
night, but senior administration officials acknowl
edged that he was "in trouble" and his replacement
was likely. The State Department choice to replace
Starr, these officials said, is Herbert Okun, who
served in theCarter administration as the State De
partment's representative to strategic nuclear arms
talks.
Market reaches record highs
The stock market climbed to record highs for the
third straight session yesterday in an advance in
spired bv hopes for a broadening economic re
covery.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down
about five points at the outset, was up 16.28 at
1092.35 by the close. Since last Aug. 12, the average
has risen more than 315 points.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange came
to 101.89 million shares, against 127.29 million
Friday.

to believe that the economy was beginning to pull
out of its slump of the last 18 months.
