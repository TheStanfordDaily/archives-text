Armed forces may not receive pay raise
Washington — The White House, as part of its all-bets-are-off reassess
ment of the fiscal 1984 budget, is challenging a 7.6 percent pay raise the Pen
tagon had penciled in for the 2 million men and women in uniform effective
next Oct. I, defense officials said yesterday.
The Pentagon had estimated 7.6 percent was necessary to keep the all-vol
unteer armed forces from dropping behind next year's likely inflation rate
and private sector pav.
In a new effort to find defense cuts, however, the Office of Management
and Budget has asked Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger his views on a
number of pav alternatives, ranging from an outright freeze to a raise this
year of only 4 percent, the same as last year.
But defense officials said yesterday there is now almost no hope for a 7.6
percent pa v raise in the budget the president is scheduled to send to Congress
Jan. 31. One reason is that the likely inflation rate now is lower than when the
budget was first drawn up. Another is the soaring budget deficit, and an in
sistence in Congress that there be cuts in defense as well as domestic pro
grams.
Also unclear is how large a raise Reagan will propose for the government's
civilian employees next Oct. I. They, too, got 4 percent last Oct. I.
Pentagon manpower officials said raises of 5 percent would probably keep
military people even next fiscal year with civilians holding comparable jobs.
Weinberger is expected to fight any White House efforts to go much below a
5 percent raise on grounds that it would hurt the all-volunteer military force
Reagan has bragged about recently.
James Baker states Donovan should resign
W ashington — White House chief of staff James Baker has told a Texas
newspaper that Secretary of Labor Raymond Donovan should resign, mak
ing public Baker's long-held opinion that Donovan is a serious political lia
bility to President Reagan.
"Ray Donovan shouldn't be in here," Baker said in an interview con
ducted during a turkev shoot on his south Texas ranch during Christmas
week. "What's he thinking about? He's got his good name now. He's vin
dicated. Now he ought to do what's right for the president.
