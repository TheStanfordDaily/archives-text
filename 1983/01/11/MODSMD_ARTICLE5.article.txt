### DAVID AZRIN Senior staff writer 
Prof. Martin Perl has received the
1983 Wuif Foundation prize in physics,
"the Israeli equivalent of the Nobel
Prize," for his discovery of the sub
atomic tau particle, it was announced
yesterday.
Perl will share the $100,000 prize
with experimental physicist Leon
Lederman, who discovered the fifth
quark.
This is only the second time a Stan
ford faculty member has received the
award. In 1978, Professor Carl
Djerassi received the award in Chemis
try.
Perl's discovery at the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) in
1975 added the tau particle to a group
of elementary particles of matter called
leptons. Scientists had previously be
lieved the lepton family included only
two charged particles, the electron and
the muon.
The tau particle is different from the
other two leptons in that it is much
heavier, almost 35 hundred times
heavier than the electron.
"It's very important because it was
so unexpected. It's an extra layer of
matter and nobody seems to know why
it's there," said physicist William Ash,
a member of the SLAC research divi
sion.
According to Wolfgang Panofsky,
director of SLAC, "it's rather pro
found in that now there is a symmetry
between the number of leptons and the
number of quarks."
Perl said that this award will help

give his research a stamp of approval.
"The most important thing about the
prize is that I tend to go off in other
directions than other people and some
times it doesn't pan out. But this time it
did," Perl said.
"And right now we're doing some
things that many people don't agree
with but now 1 know I'm right," he said.
Perl said he received news of the
award while on vacation last Thursday.
The Wolf Prize is given to "scientists
and artists outstanding for their
achievements for the benefit of human
ity and brotherly relationships amongst


Martin Perl
the peoples, regardless of nationality,
race, color, religion, sex or political
views."
Previous recipients of the award
have included Marc Chagall for art,
George Sprague for agriculture, and
Andrei Kolmogorov for mathematics.
The Foundation was established in

1976 by an Israeli chemist and multi
millionaire, Richard Wolf. Since 1978,
the Foundation has awarded five scien
tific prizes each year in agriculture,
physics, chemistry, medicine and
mathematics.
Perl said he will travel to Jerusalem,
Israel to receive the award from the
Israeli President of State on May 8 in a
special ceremony at the Knesset, the
Israeli parliament.
According to Panofsky, Perl's dis
covery was the result of a "very

painstaking search of literally millions
of data that had been gathered at
SLAC at the storage ring."
"After combing the data, he found
about 150 cases in which an electron
and a muon were observed in the same
event," Panofsky said.
This fact proved that there must be a
third particle involved in the high en
ergy pa'rticle collisions, Panofsky said.
"His discovery was greeted by quite
a bit of skepticism, including by him
self," Panofsky said.

"But since then, quite a bit of col
laborative evidence has been found
that proves his results," he added.
Awards for physics research are cus
tomarily given out many years after the
research has been completed because
"many of the discoveries are puzzling
and it takes a few years to figure out
how it all fits in," according to Ash.
Panofsky called Perl "one of the
world's great experimental research
people."
