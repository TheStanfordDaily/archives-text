# Campus communication system slated for 1985

### CAROLINE RHOADS Staff writer 
Stanford's new electronic communi
cations system, which got concept ap
proval from the Board of Trustees last
December, is now in the process of
being designed.
The project involves the installation
of a new telephone system, an energy
management and control system and a
broadband network for video and
computers. The total cost is estimated
to be between $15 and $18 million and
the installation is scheduled to be com
pleted by early 1985, according to
Project Manager Dave Sutter.
The new telephone system will re
place the current Centrex 701 equip
ment which has become obsolete. Joe
Deßode, telecommunication service
manager, said that the new system " will
be a state of the art computerized sys
tem that features call transfer and for
warding, call conference and routing of
long distance calls along with many
other services."
The new system will do away with
the familiar red "hold" button and line
of flashing white lights at the bottom of
the University's phones. In the future,
if a user wants to transfer a call or per
form some other operation, he will
simply push a two or three digit code on
a push button phone and the transfer
will be carried out automatically.
The broadband video and computer
system is essentially a "highway" for all

computer traffic in the University.
..Computerization will allow the user
to perform many more operations (up
to 400 are possible) easily and without
the need of operator assistance. It will
also allow the University to have
greater control over its own system and
thus more freedom from the phone
company, according to Deßode. For
example, if phones and numbers need
to be switched from one place to
another within the University, the
proper information will be fed into the
computer and the switch will take place
immediately without the involvement
of the phone company.
The Energy Management and Con
trol System will also replace an obso
lete system. According to Sutter, the
University had to install a new system
because replacement parts for the old
system are no longer manufactured.
"Just like with the telephone system,
we are going to install a modern
computer-based system which will
handle control systems in 73 academic
buildings," said Sutter.
The new system will monitor heat
ing, cooling and ventilation and will be
capable of providing fire and intrusion
alarm systems, Sutter said. It will also
allow the University to control its own
brown outs so that if PG&E has a blan
ket brown out, the University will still
be able to keep key areas on campus
and at the Medical Center operating.
