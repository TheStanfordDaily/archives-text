# Redwoods to fall to accommodate new building
## 
### JASON COLE Staff writer 
Axes will swing this week as progress
continues to cut its path. To make room
for the new Center for Integrated Sys
tems (CIS) two majestic redwood
trees, along with several other trees,
will be cut down.
While the University contends that
its construction plans for the building
were designed to save as many trees as
possible, at least one person — former
Stanford law student John Kelly — be
lieves that the loss of any of the trees is
unacceptable.
The redwoods, which are in a grove
between where Ventura Hall stood and
Serra Hall now stands, are slated to he
cut down within the next week or two.
Ventura Hall has alredy been moved
and several trees have either been
moved or cut down in preparation for
the new building.
Kelley expressed his desire that the
redwoods be saved. Kelley criticized
the action saying, "The trees are beau
tiful and irreplaceable."
Kelley said he wanted to file an en
vironmental impact suit but was unable
to. He also explained that since he is no
longer a student his effect on the situa
tion is quite limited. Kelley said that he
heard the news from some of his
friends, but as yet no coalition exists to
save the trees. "The effort must really
come from the students," he said.
CIS will be a new facility for com
puter chip research and development
by graduate students in the Electrical

Engineering and Computer Science
departments. The project is being
funded by Stanford, the federal gov
ernment and private industry.
But the building will also be excep
tionally large, covering over 70,000
square feet. Because of the large area it
entails, the University requested per
mission from Santa Clara County to cut
down or move many of the trees.
After going over the plans and work
ing out a strategy to save as many trees
as possible, the county gave the Uni
versity permission to cut down the trees
in the area.
Roger Cairns, CIS project manager,
said that, "Santa Clara County gave us
approval with the knowledge that as
many trees as possible would be
saved."
James Burke, facilities coordinator
for the project, explained that a $6000
budget has been established for tree
protection, treatment and relocation.
But he said, the redwoods are too large
and too old to relocate.
"The county asked us if we could
move the building over, but it's not
possible." said Cairns pointing to the
blueprints. The trees arc located on the
northern side, about 30 feet into the
building. On all the other sides there
are streets.
Cairns also explained that he tried to
build around the trees but that the red
woods are located close to where the
loading docks would be, making it all
but impossible to save the stately red
woods.
