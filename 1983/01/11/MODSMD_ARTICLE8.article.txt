## 'ET' doesn't go to the Farm but 'Missing' is here – the flicks 
### DANA RATLIFF 
Paper airplanes wing through
the air and the lucky few which
reach the stage are met with a
smattering of applause. Dorm
rivalries peak and the rock music
piped in over the sound system
has a hard time being heard over
the rowdy crowd. The lights dim
and mid clapping and hissing the
show begins.
Sunday night flicks are a tradi
tion at Stanford.
Although most students know
what movie is playing each week
at the ASSU Sunday Flicks, few
understand the selection process
behind the operation which
brings more than 40 flicks to
campus year round.
According to Flicks manager
Scott Culley, the process of de
ciding which films will be shown
is the responsibility of the man
ager and his staff.
The decision itself, however, is
based on several things — a sur
vey given to 100 students asking
them the 10 movies they would
most like to see, film journals,
box office figures and the college
market.
Culley then speaks to repre
sentatives of various movie com
panies. Efforts were made to get
movies such as E.T. and An Of
ficer and a Gentleman, but with
out success. However, individual
contracts have been drawn up for
Reds and Raiders of the Lost Ark
for spring quarter.
Once the movies have been
selected and obtained, the order
in which they will be shown is
considered. Lengthy, serious

movies generally are shown the
first five weeks of the quarter.
Movies such as Missing, Diner
and Absence of Malice head the
flicks for the first half of this
quarter.
Lighter, funnier movies — A
Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy
and Fast Times at Ridgemont
High — are shown as the quarter
closes in on finals week.
Paper Chase is traditionally
the last movie shown winter

Stanford and MIT s on cam
pus movie arrangements are
unique compared to other col

student operated movie organi

aspects of the ASSU Flicks such

Stanford also differs from
other college campuses in the
students' preference of films.
Films that normally prove suc
cessful at schools like Berkeley
and UCLA, Firefox, The Best
Little Whorehouse in Texas and
Porky's, for example, haven't at
Stanford.

A recent trend in movies
shown at Memorial Auditorium
has been toward more current re
leases. Classified as a second
rate theater, the campus flicks
organization is limited to certain
individual movie contracts of
fered by major movie com
panies.
In the past, newer movies were
withheld from the second rate
theaters until they no longer
were financial hits at the first
rate theater box offices. But be
cause the movie industry re
cently has experienced economic
difficulties, movie companies
have been renting out more cur
rent releases and even offering
limited releases such as Rocky
111 to second rate theaters.
Poltergeist, shown fall quarter,
was a limited release offered by
the company only for the week
before Halloween, a time when it
was simultaneously showing in
nearby first-rate theaters.
Newer movies are also easier
to get for Stanford community
viewing since the ASSU Flicks
admission price was raised to
$1.50, 50 cents more than the

dollar admission that hd re
mained constant since the
1960 s. Consequently, taking
risks on newer, more expensive
movies became a possibility.
Individual contracts drawn up
between each company and the
school require that either a gross
percentage (55 to 70 percent) of
the money made or a base
amount, $1500 to $2000, be
paid, depending on which figure
is higher. These figures vary ac
cording to the popularity of the
movie.

FLICKS LINE: Stanford students line-up outside Memorial
Auditorium each Sunday for the weekly movie. This quarter's

Paul Ainslie/Daily
schedule includes "Missing," "Diner," "Fast Times at
Ridgemont High" and "Paper Chase."
Paper airplanes wing through
the air and the lucky few which
reach the stage are met with a
smattering of applause. Dorm
rivalries peak and the rock music
piped in over the sound system
has a hard time being heard over
the rowdy crowd. The lights dim
and mid clapping and hissing the
show begins.
Sunday night flicks are a tradi
tion at Stanford.
Although most students know
what movie is playing each week
at the ASSU Sunday Flicks, few
understand the selection process
behind the operation which
brings more than 40 flicks to
campus year round.
According to Flicks manager
Scott Culley, the process of de
ciding which films will be shown
is the responsibility of the man
ager and his staff.
The decision itself, however, is
based on several things — a sur
vey given to 100 students asking
them the 10 movies they would
most like to see, film journals,
box office figures and the college
market.
Culley then speaks to repre
sentatives of various movie com
panies. Efforts were made to get
movies such as E.T. and An Of
ficer and a Gentleman, but with
out success. However, individual
contracts have been drawn up for
Reds and Raiders of the Lost Ark
for spring quarter.
Once the movies have been
selected and obtained, the order
in which they will be shown is
considered. Lengthy, serious

movies generally are shown the
first five weeks of the quarter.
Movies such as Missing, Diner
and Absence of Malice head the
flicks for the first half of this
quarter.
Lighter, funnier movies — A
Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy
and Fast Times at Ridgemont
High — are shown as the quarter
closes in on finals week.
Paper Chase is traditionally
the last movie shown winter

Stanford and MIT s on cam
pus movie arrangements are
unique compared to other col
lege campuses in that both have
student operated movie organi

aspects of the ASSU Flicks such

Stanford also differs from
other college campuses in the
students' preference of films.
Films that normally prove suc
cessful at schools like Berkeley
and UCLA, Firefox, The Best
Little Whorehouse in Texas and
Porky's, for example, haven't at
Stanford.
"The most popular movie now
among all college campuses is An
Officer and A GentlemanCul -
ley noted.
A recent trend in movies
shown at Memorial Auditorium
has been toward more current re
leases. Classified as a second
rate theater, the campus flicks
organization is limited to certain
individual movie contracts of
fered by major movie com
panies.
In the past, newer movies were
withheld from the second rate
theaters until they no longer
were financial hits at the first
rate theater box offices. But be
cause the movie industry re
cently has experienced economic
difficulties, movie companies
have been renting out more cur
rent releases and even offering
limited releases such as Rocky
111 to second rate theaters.
Poltergeist, shown fall quarter,
was a limited release offered by
the company only for the week
before Halloween, a time when it
was simultaneously showing in
nearby first-rate theaters.
Newer movies are also easier
to get for Stanford community
viewing since the ASSU Flicks
admission price was raised to
$1.50, 50 cents more than the

dollar admission that hd re
mained constant since the
1960 s. Consequently, taking
risks on newer, more expensive
movies became a possibility.
Individual contracts drawn up
between each company and the
school require that either a gross
percentage (55 to 70 percent) of
the money made or a base
amount, $1500 to $2000, be
paid, depending on which figure
is higher. These figures vary ac
cording to the popularity of the
movie.
