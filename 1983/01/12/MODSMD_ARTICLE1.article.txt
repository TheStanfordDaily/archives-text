# ASSU votes fee refund guidelines
## 
### STEVE TROUSDALE Staff writer 
Despite the objections of the student
director of Club Sports, the ASSU Sen
ate last night approved a resolution de
tailing guidelines on the implementa
tion of the fee assessment reform
amendment passed by students last
spring.
Implementing these guidelines, Di
rector Richie Sobel told the senate,
"might lead to the downfall of Club
Sports bv dividing us."
The meeting, which lasted four
hours, was marred by bickering be
tween coalitions of ASSU officials on
certain points. The senate approved a
bill freezing the budget, and essentially
dismembering the ASSU's Office of
Public Affairs, and another bill restruc
turing the committee system of the sen
ate.
Debate on the fee assessment resolu
tion centered on the issue of whether or
not Club Sports should be exempted
from the resolution's guidelines.
Sobel argued that under the
guidelines proposed by the subcommit
tee on the fee assessment reform
amendment, his organization must reg
ister as an ASSU board in order to re
ceive funding. He said that this would
limit the autonomy of his organization
by forcing it to have its budget ap
proved by the senate.
In response to this charge, senator
Joseph Hughes argued that currently
the senate retains ultimate authority
over Club Sports' budget, because it
can vote not to disburse that organiza
tion's fee assessment to the group.
Senate Deputy Chair Roc Blumen
thal also said that if Club Sports had to
register as an ASSU board in order to
receive funding, the senate could
allowances to lessen the financial ac
countability of the group to the senate.
However, he did not elaborate what
these allowances could be.
Differences of opinion also arose
over a meeting that was held between
senator James McGrath, Sobel and the
University's director of Club Sports,
Shirley Schoof. Sobel said that
McGrath told him that becoming an
ASSU board would be beneficial to his
organization, but did not "harp" on
that fact that doing so would make his
organization directly accountable to
the senate.
McGrath said that he, Schoof and
Sobel examined the fee assessment re
form guidelines and that all three of
them agreed with it.
Sobel also said that he disagreed with
a provision in the guidelines which
directs student groups to report
changes to any line item of their budget
by more than $100. "We have our own
accounting system that works. . .and
what you're doing is throwing a system
that works out of whack." However,
several senators raised objections to
this figure, and the senate failed to set a
new figure.
The fee assessment guidelines even
tually passed, with only one minor
amendment, but several senators ques
tioned the motives of their colleagues in
voting for this bill.
"It appears that many people voted
for the resolution so ihat they wouldn't
have to debate on it," Hughes said. Sen
ator David Porter added that the senate
"probably passed a resolution that
doesn't represent the intent of the sen
ate."
With the passing of the resolution the
senate rules committee will now begin
to write the necessary by-laws to put the
guidelines, which act as suggestions to
the committee, into effect.
Because the senate only froze the
budget of the ASSU's Office of Public
Affairs (OPA) and failed to pass a bill to
abolish it, the office will continue to ex
ist, but has no money and in fact, ac
cording to COP member Mark Epstein,
no staff with which to operate.
Epstein cited earlier budget cuts as
the reason for which it was not operat
ing as originally planned.
The bill restructuring the senate in
creases the number of its committees to
six, because it divides an existing com
mittee, the finance committee, into two
committees â€” one on appropriations
and one on budget and finance. It also
adds two committees, graduate educa
tion/research and undergraduate and
residential education, while dropping
the present academic affairs committee.

The photograph on page 3 of yester
day's Daily incorrectly identified Rev.
Wendy Smith and Roger Green as
members of the Stanford Amnesty In
ternational group. In fact the two are
part of Memorial Church's Urgent Ac

writes letters in behalf of groups of pris
oners.
In the Dec. 8 issue of the Daily we
printed a mistaken quote that the
biology 110 final was given during dead
week. In fact, the final was adminis
tered Dec. 2, the week before Dead
Week.
