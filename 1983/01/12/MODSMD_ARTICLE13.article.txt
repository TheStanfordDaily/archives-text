## The 						Stanford Daily Mixed feelings about the ERA 
### 
We greeted with mixed emotions the news that
the Equal Rights Amendment, which says simply
"equality of rights under the law shall not be de
nied or abridged by the United States or any state
on the basis of sex," was the first bill introduced in
the 98th Congress.
The amendment failed to be ratified by the
necessary 38 states by June 30, 1982, and was
subsequently re-introduced to Congress, where it
faces what will probably be a tough battle through
the Republican-controlled Senate. It passed both
houses, easily garnering the two-thirds vote neces
sary, in 1972.
The potential difficulty of its passage is the source
of our ambivalence. If the struggles in the Senate
this fall were any indication, the so-called "social
issues" — abortion, school prayer, busing and the
ERA — remain controversial and time-consuming
in a Congress which faces a probable $200 billion
deficit in the next fiscal year. A filibuster by a New
Right hero such as Republican Senator Jesse
Helms of North Carolina could stall the passage of
any legislation aimed at solving this budget crisis.
Such problems do not dim our enthusiasm for
the ERA, however. The fact that the majority of
Americans are not guaranteed equal rights by a
federal law bothers us more than a little. A recent
poll showed that 73 percent of Americans favor
the amendment, and despite extensive gains in the
area of equal rights for women, discrimination
exists on all levels. Jobs traditionally held by
women remain low-paying. Rape laws remain in
herently unfair in many states. The percentage of

women legislators at both the state and national
level has not increased substantially in 10 years.
Many job opportunities remain closed to women,
and the overwhelming majority of college profes
sors are men, exacerbating the problem by giving
female students few role models.
The ERA would benefit men as well, by bringing
into question divorce laws which give child custody
to women, despite the fact that fathers are often
more capable of supporting the child.
Inequalities such as these will not be solved by
state or local action, as President Reagan claims.
The amendment was stalled for a decade primarily
because the legislatures of mostly southern states,
composed almost entirely of men, refused to give
women equality. Lawmakers in these states will
block just as easily any legislation aimed at limiting
discrimination there.
What is needed is a national law that will, in
one broad gesture, mitigate discrimination based
on sex. But this would not be the be-all and end-all
of the struggle. Day care centers, affirmative ac
tion for women, abortion rights and substantial
changes in attitudes about sexual roles are also
essential.
We wish that an amendment which offers simply
a step toward the equality of the sexes would not
gather such a storm of controversy, a storm which
will inevitably stall other legislation. It is unfortu
nate that the amendment had to be re-introduced
in the first place, but on its re-introduction we can
offer nothing but hope for a speedy passage.
