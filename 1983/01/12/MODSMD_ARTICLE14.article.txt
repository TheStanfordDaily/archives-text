## Royal luncheon dates: perspective on novelty 
### 
When I heard that the Queen of En
gland was coming to Stanford to have
lunch with the Kennedys and 20 stu
dents, I decided immediately that I
wanted to be one of the privileged
guests. This is most assuredly a once
in-a-lifetime event for most of us, and
even if 1 were to get a second chance to
dine with the Queen I could never re
gret having done it at this point in my

I was to write a letter to Kennedy in which I
explained why I wanted to have lunch with the
Queen and to list some of my activities at
Stanford. They would be looking for an
interesting and diverse student representation.

youth. While no one at Stanford could
have guessed that this opportunity
would arise, this is the sort of thing
which is bound to happen when one is
associated with a prestigious and
flourishing community which has be
come a world center in academics and
technology.
The question now, however, was
how should one be counted among the
select? My first instinct was to run to
President Donald Kennedy's office to
see if perhaps 1 could be included be
cause 1 was among the first to ask. That
sort of thinking proved much too naive,
however, and the president's secretary
informed me of the official procedure:
1 was to write a letter to Kennedy in
which 1 explained why 1 wanted to have
lunch with the Queen and to list some
of my activities at Stanford. They
would be looking for an interesting and
diverse student representation.
That all sounded simple enough

from their point of view, but as far as I
was concerned they could have just as
well told me I'd first have to complete a
mission on NASA's spade shuttle. I
mean, what could be more intimidating
than trying to convince Kennedy that
you are one of Stanford's most diverse
and interesting students? No way. Not
here, where eager students begin com
piling their personal resumes from the

day they volunteer to clean up after
freshman orientation week until the
day they usher at their own graduation!

students have become expert, it is the
process of marketing themselves as
superior products; and I can only imag
ine the type of letters that Kennedy is
going to receive.
But after he reads through the type
set resumes and convincing letters of

recommendation from history profes
sors or freshman advisers, Kennedy
will undoubtedly remain with the two
fundamental questions left unan
swered: why would a Stanford student
want to have lunch with the Queen of
England, and what, alas, are the proper
qualifications? And with all due re
spect to the Queen of England and to
the diversity of student achievement at
Stanford, Kennedy will probably ad
mit, in the final analysis, that it is all
very simple — Stanford students, even
those who have received Rhodes
Scholarships, would like to have lunch
with the Queen for the novelty of the
experience: so they can write home,
joke with their friends and maybe one
day tell their kids about it. And as far as
qualifications go, a clean tie or a nice
blouse should certainly suffice.
Wouldn't it be a more simple and
equitable solution if Kennedy settled
the matter by putting the names of all
interested students into a hat and then
selected from it randomly and confi-

dently? But then again, I suppose those
who have memorized the prologue to
Chaucer's Canterbury Tales may be
better prepared to pass the salt to Her
Majesty.
