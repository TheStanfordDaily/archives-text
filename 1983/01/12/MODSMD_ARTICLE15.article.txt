## With enough shovels, we might bury ourselves 
### 
On the cover of Robert Scheer's
book. With Enough Shovels: Reagan,
Hush and Nuclear War, is printed a
statement from Scheer's interview with
T.K. Jones. Deputy Under Secretary of
Defense for Strategic and Theater Nu
clear Forces; Jones advised us as fol
lows:
"Dig a hole, cover it with a couple of
doors and then throw three feet of dirt
on top . . . It's the dirt that does it... if
there are enough shovels to go around,
everybody's going to make it."
I have recently been reading a
different sort of book: Unforgettable
Fire: Pictures Drawn by Atomic Bomb
Survivors (edited by Japan Broadcast
ing Corporation). These pictures,
drawn and painted by amateurs, give
one an overwhelming sense of disaster
and tragedy. The terrible calamity of
the atomic explosion on August 6,
1945 created, in a few moments, a hell
on earth for the people of Hiroshima —
for those who lived and who were not
instantly killed by the blast and fires.
The pictures are carefully drawn, with
great attention to detail, and brief nar
ratives. touching and pathetic, accom
pany the drawings. Some of them de
pict a scries of ghastly scenes:
" I smelled and tasted the black rain on
my head. Parents were looking for their
children and children were crying for
their parents . . . The vice-principal
who came into the classroom im

mediately after the A-bomb had lost
his glasses, his clothes were t° rn °ff»
and his arms, bloody and skinned, hung
down by his side. His face was burned
black."
The following is the story of Umpin
Motoyama, now 76 years old:
"Miserable, so miserablelcountless si
lent forms of corpses
wringing and shaking our hearts ...
The last moment of a mother and a
child,
too horrible to cast a look;
Their bloody faces,
swollen and burnt
crushed in water bucket,
exhibits a horror in blue and black..
Will we have time, one wonders, and
will we have the amazing presence of
mind to seek shovels and dig holes,
when nuclear warheads much more
powerful than the primitive Hiroshima
bomb rain down on our heads?
Each one of us is morally obligated
to support the freeze on nuclear
weapons, to save the children and to
demand now an end to the madness of
Reagan, Bush, Jones et al., as they bus
ily plan our fate and the fate of the
planet. There is not much time left.

Looking to God
After reading Isaac Tabor's article,
"God and the need for explanations," I
felt compelled to comment on his ar
gument and conclusions.
I agree with Tabor's premise: man
does have a need for God. As Blaise
Pascal, a 17th-century philosopher,
mathematician and devout Christian
put it, "there is a God-shaped vacuum
in the heart of'every man which re
mains unfilled by any created thing but
only by God made known through His
son, Jesus Christ." This fact does not
disprove His existence, however, but
supports it. If we have a need for some
thing, take hunger for example, doesn't
that suggest the existence of a satisfying
element such as food?
Accepting the existence of God leads
one to the question of why He created
us. The God of the Bible created man
for fellowship; for something that He
could love and that would in turn love
and glorify Him. If we were made for
Him. it logically follows we would have
a need for Him.
Tabor correctly points out that we
attribute human characteristics to God
in order to establish a personal rela
tionship with Him. but seems to imply
that is a ridiculous assertion on our
part. I don't agree. The God of the
Bible created man in His image; it fol
lows that some of our characteristics
can also be attributed to Him. A blue
print in no way fully explains or repre

sents a building but it can nevertheless
be used to describe it. The fact that we
take these attributes such as love, jus
tice, and goodness and make them infi
nite in our conceptualization of God
indicates our inability to fully com
prehend Him.
labor's argument is true in part; his
conclusion is not. God does wish to be
worshiped; that is part of the relation
ship. However, He does not need our
worship, but wants it — as much for us
as for Him. For if we acknowledge His
existence, but do not submit to His will
and come to know Him through prayer,
then we cannot fill our void, satisfy out
need and be what we were created to
be.
Prayers are not for the purpose of
reminding ourselves to "behave." If
they were, Tabor would be correct in
his suggestion that we might as well put
up signs reminding ourselves to behave
morally. Prayer is communicating with
God, our creator, the one who can ful
fill us completely, forever. Through
prayer, reading His word and sharing
our faith with both nonbelievers and
believers, we can come to know Him
and love Him, to serve and to obey
Him.
Tabor's justification for the signs,
that they would sell better than prayer
as reminders to "be good," also misses
the point. God is not a product. Accept
ing or rejecting Him is not an option —
it is the purpose of our lives.

our faith with both nonbelievers and
believers, we can come to know Him
and love Him, to serve and to obey
Him.
Tabor's justification for the signs,
that they would sell better than prayer
as reminders to "be good," also misses
the point. God is not a product. Accept
ing or rejecting Him is not an option —
it is the purpose of our lives.

On the cover of Robert Scheer's
book. With Enough Shovels: Reagan,
Hush and Nuclear War, is printed a
statement from Scheer's interview with
T.K. Jones. Deputy Under Secretary of
Defense for Strategic and Theater Nu
clear Forces; Jones advised us as fol
lows:
"Dig a hole, cover it with a couple of
doors and then throw three feet of dirt
on top . . . It's the dirt that does it... if
there are enough shovels to go around,
everybody's going to make it."
I have recently been reading a
different sort of book: Unforgettable
Fire: Pictures Drawn by Atomic Bomb
Survivors (edited by Japan Broadcast
ing Corporation). These pictures,
drawn and painted by amateurs, give
one an overwhelming sense of disaster
and tragedy. The terrible calamity of
the atomic explosion on August 6,
1945 created, in a few moments, a hell
on earth for the people of Hiroshima —
for those who lived and who were not
instantly killed by the blast and fires.
The pictures are carefully drawn, with
great attention to detail, and brief nar
ratives. touching and pathetic, accom
pany the drawings. Some of them de
pict a scries of ghastly scenes:
" I smelled and tasted the black rain on
my head. Parents were looking for their
children and children were crying for
their parents . . . The vice-principal
who came into the classroom im

mediately after the A-bomb had lost
his glasses, his clothes were t° rn °ff»
and his arms, bloody and skinned, hung
down by his side. His face was burned
black."
The following is the story of Umpin
Motoyama, now 76 years old:
"Miserable, so miserablelcountless si
lent forms of corpses
wringing and shaking our hearts ...
The last moment of a mother and a
child,
too horrible to cast a look;
Their bloody faces,
swollen and burnt
crushed in water bucket,
exhibits a horror in blue and black..
Will we have time, one wonders, and
will we have the amazing presence of
mind to seek shovels and dig holes,
when nuclear warheads much more
powerful than the primitive Hiroshima
bomb rain down on our heads?
Each one of us is morally obligated
to support the freeze on nuclear
weapons, to save the children and to
demand now an end to the madness of
Reagan, Bush, Jones et al., as they bus
ily plan our fate and the fate of the
planet. There is not much time left.

Looking to God
After reading Isaac Tabor's article,
"God and the need for explanations," I
felt compelled to comment on his ar
gument and conclusions.
I agree with Tabor's premise: man
does have a need for God. As Blaise
Pascal, a 17th-century philosopher,
mathematician and devout Christian
put it, "there is a God-shaped vacuum
in the heart of'every man which re
mains unfilled by any created thing but
only by God made known through His
son, Jesus Christ." This fact does not
disprove His existence, however, but
supports it. If we have a need for some
thing, take hunger for example, doesn't
that suggest the existence of a satisfying
element such as food?
Accepting the existence of God leads
one to the question of why He created
us. The God of the Bible created man
for fellowship; for something that He
could love and that would in turn love
and glorify Him. If we were made for
Him. it logically follows we would have
a need for Him.
Tabor correctly points out that we
attribute human characteristics to God
in order to establish a personal rela
tionship with Him. but seems to imply
that is a ridiculous assertion on our
part. I don't agree. The God of the
Bible created man in His image; it fol
lows that some of our characteristics
can also be attributed to Him. A blue
print in no way fully explains or repre

sents a building but it can nevertheless
be used to describe it. The fact that we
take these attributes such as love, jus
tice, and goodness and make them infi
nite in our conceptualization of God
indicates our inability to fully com
prehend Him.
labor's argument is true in part; his
conclusion is not. God does wish to be
worshiped; that is part of the relation
ship. However, He does not need our
worship, but wants it — as much for us
as for Him. For if we acknowledge His
existence, but do not submit to His will
and come to know Him through prayer,
then we cannot fill our void, satisfy out
need and be what we were created to
be.
Prayers are not for the purpose of
reminding ourselves to "behave." If
they were, Tabor would be correct in
his suggestion that we might as well put
up signs reminding ourselves to behave
morally. Prayer is communicating with
God, our creator, the one who can ful
fill us completely, forever. Through
prayer, reading His word and sharing
our faith with both nonbelievers and
believers, we can come to know Him
and love Him, to serve and to obey
Him.
Tabor's justification for the signs,
that they would sell better than prayer
