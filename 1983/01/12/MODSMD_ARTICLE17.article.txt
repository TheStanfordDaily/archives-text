Although prejudice and bigotry are words most often
associated with the likes of Archie Bunker and members of
the KKK, tendencies toward banner-waving narrow
mindedness and simplistic name calling are as at home here
among the well-educated as they are among hard hats,
backwoodsmen, and southern rednecks. For example, it is
not at all uncommon on this campus to hear otherwise
intelligent students refer to politicians and presidents as
"fascists," both on the pages of the Daily and in the cor
ridors of the political science building. I myself, in fact, have
been accused in print of having the "most reactionary views
around."

The educated citizen must vote and
decide on the issues. Name calling
and label making only lead to
prejudice and ignorance.

But aside from these rhetorical excesses, there exists here
and in America at large a harmful tendency to label people
with appellations such as "conservative" or "liberal," "right
wing" or "left-wing" based only on superficial evidence and
without regard to any historical definitions of the terms.
This tendency is harmful because in most cases these labels
have been so misused as to lose all inherent meaning.
If one is to make rational political judgments free
from emotional hysteria or 'knee-jerk' responses, one must
first recognize the unavoidable contradictions which follow
from these labels. To do so one must examine what it has
meant in history to be "right" or "left" and also what, if
anything, it means today.
Historically, conservatives were those who sought to pre
serve the status-quo and the privilege and wealth associated
with it. During the English Puritan revolution there were
those who defended the monarchy against those who sought
to create a rule of Parliament and religion. During the
French revolution conservatives were those who opposed
the more radical revolutionaries. It was also a relative term
describing first, those who defended the monarchy, and
then progressively different phases of the revolution itself
against those who sought to change it further.
The 19th century was an era marked more by legislative
change than the overthrow of recognized governments. In
Victorian England conservatives were those who sought to
preserve the privileges of the nobility and gentry against the
encroachments of the reform-minded liberals. Conserva
tives were also those who defended the earlier mercantilist
economics against the champions of free trade and free
enterprise such as Adam Smith.
Unlike earlier conservatives, more recent American con
servatives were those who defended laissez-faire economics
and resisted the Keynesian policies of Franklin Roosevelt's
New Deal. On the other hand, these same American con
servatives were also more likely to be isolationist and
against military involvement of the United States overseas.
In Europe during the 1930s "right wing" became con
nected with the growing National Socialist Workers' Party
(Nazis) in Germany. The Nazis were ideologically
nationalistic, racist, militaristic and totalitarian. Yet they
kept the military subordinate to civilian, party control and
they nationalized vital industries much to the dismay of
corporate interests.

The Fascists of Mussolini's Italy were also extremely
nationalistic and sought to revive the Roman Empire.
However, they closely aligned themselves with corporate
and religious interests (unlike their German counterparts).
This period saw "left-wing" become the label for com
munists and socialists around the world. However, the pre
mier communist party, the Communist Party of the Soviet
Union (CPSU), resembled in many respects the to
talitarianism of the "right-wing" Nazis. Zbigniew
Brzezinski has outlined many similarities between Nazi and
Soviet totalitarianism. Originally, the CPSU was also, like
the Nazis, a party of workers and of fervent ideology. Other
aspects of Nazism have been mirrored by Communism.
The CPSU has been responsible for the largest military
buildup in human history, and under the leadership of
Joseph Stalin was the perpetrator of genocide and many
racist crimes.
Today, there is such a great variety of political beliefs and
positions that any such reduction to a horizontal scale of
degrees only clouds our understanding with mispercep
tions. So many issues cut across all established lines of party
or label. "Conservatives" today advocate changing the
status-quo; "liberals" such as Tip O'Neill defend it as in
O'Neill's statement, "We cannot let the president undo 30
years of progress."

/ and others should be judged on the
basis of specific stands on specific
issues, not broad-sweeping
generalizations placing us in a
' right or'left camp. I reject all such
labels.

In many cases conservative Republican President Re
agan relied on conservative Democrats to defeat liberal
Republicans in the House of Representatives. A "liberal"
Republican Congressman Pete McCloskey and an "arch
conservative" Republican Congressman Jim Collins can
both propose military conscription over the protests of "lib
eral" Republican Senator Mark Hatfield and "arch
conservatives" Milton Friedman and William Buckley.
When such contradictions exist it becomes plainly evident
that the labels of "right," "left," "conservative," and "lib
eral" have indeed lost all inherent meaning.
I and others should be judged on the basis of specific
stands on specific issues, not broad-sweeping generaliza
tions placing us in a "right" or "left" camp. 1 reject all such
labels. Terms like "Nazi" or "fascist" should only be used
for those who fulfill the entire historical definition, lest
similarity in some regards lead one to falsely assume
similarities in other areas.
The educated citizen must vote and decide on the issues.
Name calling and label making only lead to prejudice and
ignorance. If general terminology is necessary, it is my
opinion that new words and definitions should be used in
order to add light to the issues and not to overwhelm them
with the darkness of preconceptions.
