Cancer researcher lauded
The Armand Hammer Foundation
awarded the first annual prize for "the per
son or persons deemed to have made the
greatest contribution to the cure of cancer"
to Ronald Levy, an associate professor of
medicine.
Levy shares the $100,000 award with
C ieorge Telford Stevenson, an Australian re
searcher. Their research involved the use of
polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies for
treatment of cancers of the blood and lymph
glands.
The monoclonal antibodies, which were
first developed in England in 1975, are pro
teins which are the result of a fusion of an
antibody-producing human cell and a cell
from a mouse tumor. The proteins, which
are called hvbridomas, are able to produce
almost unlimited quantities of an antibody.
When the cells are released into the blood
stream, they search for cells that have
matching membrane coats. The protein is
then able to attach itself to the cell and it willi
label the cell for destruction.
The two scientists developed the
monoclonal cells to fight leukemia and lym
phoma of B-cells, which attacks the infec
tion-fighting antibodies.

Stevenson found that the B-cells have ab
normal proteins, or idiotypes, on their sur
faces. The idiotypes are used to target the
cancerous cells because each abnormal cell
produces thousands of cells with the same id
iotype which is unlike anything else found in
the body.
Levy has been able to use his compound in
the treatment of patients. One man, who was
treated with the antibodies after regular
types of therapy had failed, is still in re
mission from his B-cell lymphoma after
18 months.
Levy, however, is quick to caution that his
method has not been applied to enough pa
tients to qualify it as foolproof.
After graduating from Harvard and re
ceiving his M.D. from the University in
1968, Levy worked as a fellow of the Helen
Hav Whitney Foundation. He has been a
faculty member here since 1975.
Emeritus prof, dies
Civ Howard Hatcher died Dec. 29 of a
massive heart attack. The 82-year-oid pro
fessor of surgery emeritus was the former
chief of the School of Medicine's division of
orthopedic surgery.
After 30 years on the University of Chica
go's faculty, Hatcher came to the University
in 1960 and worked for five years before re
tiring. After 1965, Hatcher opened his own
private orthopedic surgery practice in Palo
Alto in addition to serving as a consultant
for the Stanford and Palo Alto Veterans Ad
ministration Medical Center.
A member of the American Academy of
Orthopedic Surgeons, the American Or
thopedic Association and the American

Medical Association, Hatcher was also an
honorary fellow of the British Orthopedic
Association and served as a consultant to the
United Nations Relict and Rehabilitation
Administration in Greece in 1946.
In 1924, Hatcher received his bachelor's
degree from UC-Berkelev , and five years
later, his M.I), from IJC-San Francisco.
Hatcher did his post-graduate work in
pathologv in Innsbruck, Austria.
Hatcher's main interest was in bone dis
eases, especially bone tumors.
Memorial services were held Jan. 3.
Hatcher is survived bv three children and
two grandchildren.

Senior fellow named
Thomas Henriksen has been named a sen
ior research fellow at the Hoover Institution,
said Institution Director Glenn Campbell.
His career at the Institution began in 1979

fairs Fellows Program.
The following year Henriksen was made a
research fellow in addition to working in the
University's Internal Audit Department asa
senior auditor.

Saharan Africa, Henriksen also co-authored
The Struggle for Zimbabwe with Lewis
Gann, another senior fellow, in addition to
working on other pieces of literature.
As an army airborne infantry officer from
1963 to 1965, Henriksen was also a history
professor at the State University of New
York in Plattsburgh.
He received his Ph.D. from Michigan
State University and his B.A. from Virginia
Militarv Institute.

Schulman named staff chief
Irving Schulman, M.D., has been ap
pointed chief of staff at the Children's Hos
pital.
The Marron and Mary Elizabeth Ken
drick Professor of Pediatrics, Schulman is
also chairman of the Department of
Pediatrics in the School of Medicine.
hollowing approval by the hospital's
board of directors, Executive Director John
Williams announced the appointment effec
tive Jan. I, 1983.
In addition to being the chief of staff at the
Children's Hospital, Schulman is now also
chief of the pediatrics division.
As chief of staff at the Children's Hospi
tal, Schulman is responsible for the medical
staff, the patient care programs and teaching
and research efforts.
Schulman will have to divide his time be
tween the Med School, the University Hos
pital and the Children's Hospital, which is
affiliated with the Med School.

Cole named asst â€¢ dean
Sallv Cole has been appointed by Dean of
Student Affairs James Lyons as Assistant
Dean for Judicial Affairs.
This new position is in addition to Cole's
duties as Director of Research for Student
Affairs.
Students who have questions or concerns
about the Honor Code or the Fundamental
Standard are now able to contact Cole who
will help answer questions or investigate the
concerns. Cole is also able to instigate for
mal charges on behalf of the University.
The prosecuting aspects of the Honor
Code used to be dealt with by the Office of
Legal Counsel at the delegation of the presi
dent of the University. The decision to move
these offices came from a desire to reduce the
student perception of Judicial Affairs as a
solely adversary office and not an educa
tional office.
Reporting the results of the proceedings
of the Judicial Council to the University
community is also a part of Cole's duties.
She will also be responsible for overseeing
the efficiency of the entire judicial process.

surveys of "students' beliefs, perceptions
and behaviors with respect to their own aca
demic honesty and that of their fellow stu
dents."

Scholarship established
Nadine Nakanishi recently gave the Uni
versity the Kenji Nakanishi Memorial
Scholarship, a permanently endowed fund
made possible bv the donations of many
friends and relatives of the late Kenji
Nakanishi.
Nakanishi was the first student to attend
the University from Roosevelt High School
in East Los Angeles. He earned a B.S. and an
M.S. in 1970 and an M.B.A. in 1972.
Nakanishi, an executive at Occidental Pe
troleum Corporation, was 31 when he
boarded a PSA commuter flight between
Los Angeles and San Diego. He and 143 oth
ers died when their jet collided with a smaller
plane on Sept. 25, 1978.
Nakanishi, while attending Roosevelt,
was greatly influenced by Nina Elkind West
who received both her B.A. and M.A. from
the University in 1961. She and her husband
contributed a large portion of the fund.
Nakanishi, who was born in Hiroshima in
1947, was raised on a small farm. After emi
grating to the United States in 1958,
Nakanishi's familv settled on the east side of
Los Angeles.
A resident assistant in Burbank House,
Stern Hall, Nakanishi received a B.S. in en
gineering and an M.S. in industrial engineer
ing. He graduated magna cum laude and Phi
Beta Kappa.
His wife established the fund in the hope
that students from East Los Angeles can
"perpetuate his memory through the sus
taining of knowledge and the contribution to
learning at Stanford University." Mrs.
Nakanishi has said that she hopes that the
money can be given to a student from Roo
sevelt High School or any other high school
' in East Los Angeles.
