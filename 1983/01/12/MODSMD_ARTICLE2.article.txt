Reagan proposes $11.3 billion defense cuts
Washington — President Reagan announced yesterday that he will "glad
ly" cut his planned Pentagon funding request by $11.3 billion for the next
fiscal year, prompting the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Commit
tee to declare that he would resist efforts to decrease defense spending by any
more than $11.3 billion.
However, a liberal member of his panel said the cuts were both insufficient
and aimed at the wrong targets.
The chairman, Sen. John Tower (R-Texas) said he would resist efforts to
make further across-the-board cuts in defense or to eliminate major weapons
programs he said were vital to the nation's security.
But Sen. Carl Levin (D-Mich.) a committee member often at odds with the
Pentagon's priorities, told reporters that the proposed cuts "are not enough
and they appear to be in the wrong place.
Reagan's announcement represented a victory for several presidential ad
visers and Republican congressional leaders who had urged Reagan to trim
defense spending and raise taxes in order to reduce a projected $200 billion
budget deficit that could send interest rates climbing again.
Reagan, according to White House sources, Monday authorized his eco
nomic advisers to develop so-called triggered tax increases to go into effect in
two vears if budget deficits are not reduced by a recovered, healthy economy.
Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger, who previously had argued per
sistently that Pentagon spending could not be significantly slowed without
endangering national security, came up with the 4 percent, SI 1.3 billion re
duction in the militarv funding Reagan tentatively had intended to propose
in the fiscal 1984 budget that he will send to Congress Jan. 31.
Both Reagan and Weinberger emphasized that no major weapons sys
tems, such as the MX missile or the B-l bomber, would be eliminated.
The president insisted, "It is not setting back any substantive way at all
our defense program because that still remains the top priority — the secur
ity of our people."
But, he added, "Obviously, there might (be) some things that will be
slowed a little bit, but thev are not absolutely essential to the major buildup.
So we're not reversing our course."
