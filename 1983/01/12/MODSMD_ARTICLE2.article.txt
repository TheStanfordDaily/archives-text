Reagan proposes $11.3 billion defense cuts
Washington — President Reagan announced yesterday that he will "glad
ly" cut his planned Pentagon funding request by $11.3 billion for the next
fiscal year, prompting the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Commit
tee to declare that he would resist efforts to decrease defense spending by any
more than $11.3 billion.
However, a liberal member of his panel said the cuts were both insufficient
and aimed at the wrong targets.
The chairman, Sen. John Tower (R-Texas) said he would resist efforts to
make further across-the-board cuts in defense or to eliminate major weapons
programs he said were vital to the nation's security.
But Sen. Carl Levin (D-Mich.) a committee member often at odds with the
Pentagon's priorities, told reporters that the proposed cuts "are not enough
and they appear to be in the wrong place.
Reagan's announcement represented a victory for several presidential ad
visers and Republican congressional leaders who had urged Reagan to trim
defense spending and raise taxes in order to reduce a projected $200 billion
budget deficit that could send interest rates climbing again.
Reagan, according to White House sources, Monday authorized his eco
nomic advisers to develop so-called triggered tax increases to go into effect in
two vears if budget deficits are not reduced by a recovered, healthy economy.
Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger, who previously had argued per
sistently that Pentagon spending could not be significantly slowed without
endangering national security, came up with the 4 percent, SI 1.3 billion re
duction in the militarv funding Reagan tentatively had intended to propose
in the fiscal 1984 budget that he will send to Congress Jan. 31.
Both Reagan and Weinberger emphasized that no major weapons sys
tems, such as the MX missile or the B-l bomber, would be eliminated.
The president insisted, "It is not setting back any substantive way at all
our defense program because that still remains the top priority — the secur
ity of our people."
But, he added, "Obviously, there might (be) some things that will be
slowed a little bit, but thev are not absolutely essential to the major buildup.
So we're not reversing our course."
Reagan and Weinberger, anticipating the
almost-certain demand by many congressmen
for even deeper cuts, indicated that they al
ready had compromised about as much as they
would.
Schweiker leaves HHS post
Washington — Secretary of Health and Hu
man Services Richard Schweiker is resigning
early next month to take a job in private in
dustry, government sources said yesterday.
Schweiker, whose two years in the Cabinet
have been stormv, with fights over welfare,
medical programs, health insurance and Social
Security, would be the second Cabinet member
to resign in recent weeks and the fourth since
the start of the Reagan administration.
Schweiker has accepted the post of president
of the American Council of Life Insurance, the
spokesman for the nation's giant life-insurance
industry, with a salary reportedly in six figures,
sources said.
The resignation was not prompted by any
conflict with President Reagan, the sources
said. Schweiker was said to feel that the new
job was a "blue-ribbon offer" and "ir
resistible."
As head of the ACLI he will deal only with
life insurance, sources said, and will not get
into the health insurance area over which, as
head of H HS, he had jurisdiction.
According to one report, former represent
ative Margaret Heckler, (R-Mass.) who was
defeated for re-election in November after
being redistricted into the same congressional
district as Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.), is a
leading candidate to replace Schweiker. Social
Security Commissioner John (Jack) Svahn is
mentioned as potential undersecretary, along
with Assistant Secretary for Health Edward
Brandt.

Andropov, Vogel discuss arms
Moscow — The West German Social Demo
cratic leader, Hans Jochen Vogel, met with So
viet leader Yuri Andropov here vesterday and
said later that Andropov's remarks have in
creased his optimism about a possible com
promise at the Soviet-American talks in Gene
va on reducing medium-range nuclear weap
ons.
Speaking to West German journalists, Vogel
said Andropov had given him new details
about the Dec. 21 Soviet proposal to reduce the
number of Soviet medium-range missiles in
Europe to match the combined total of 162
deployed bv Britain and France. The Soviet of
fer is contingent on NATO abandoning
deployment in Western Europe of 572 cruise
and Pershing II missiles that is set to begin late
this year.
"My hopes that there will be an agreement
(in Geneva) have bv no means been reduced bv
today's discussions, but have in fact been
strengthened," Vogel said.
Vogel declined to provide details of his talks
with Andropov, saying he intends to relay
them first to the West German government of
Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
Vogel, who is his party's candidate for chan
cellor in West Germany's general election on
March 6, conferred with Andropov for 2 1-2
hours, an unusually long period by Soviet stan
dards.
For most of the time, the two men were ac
companied bv advisers except for about 15
minutes when Vogel and Andropov talked

Reagan considers pay freeze
Washington — President Ronald Reagan is

expected to decide today whether to freeze the
pay of all federal employees, civilian and mili
tary , in an effort to keep the 1984 budget deficit
below S2OO billion, administration officials
told the Los Angeles Times vesterday.
A saving of S4 6 billion would result, they
said.
()ne of the officials said the pay freeze, to be
gin in October at the start of the 1984 fiscal
vear for 2 million civilian government workers
and 2.1 million members of the armed forces, is
virtually certain to be approved bv the presi
dent.
A strong signal ihat the presidential decision
"is cut and dried." an administration official
said, was the announcement vesterdav by Sec
retary of Defense Caspar Weinberger that the
new Pentagon buldget w ill call for a cut of more
than S8 billion in projected spending in fiscal
1984.
Members of the three uniformed services are
due for a 7.6 percent pay raise in October 1983,
on top of a 4 percent raise they received last Oc
tober. Freezing their pay now will save some
52.9 billion, according to Pentagon calcu
lations.
Civilians in the executive branch of the gov
ernment had been expected to get a 4 percent
pay increase next October, on top of a 4 per
cent raise last October, as part of a program to
maintain pav scales comparable to those in
private industrv. The rise last October cost the
government 51.7 billion, so freezing the in
crease programmed for next October is ex
pected to save a comparable amount.
Administration officials said that most of
the Pentagon budget savings that are unrelated
to inflation and fuel will come in reduced per
sonnel costs.

Reagan proposes $11.3 billion defense cuts
Washington — President Reagan announced yesterday that he will "glad
ly" cut his planned Pentagon funding request by $11.3 billion for the next
fiscal year, prompting the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Commit
tee to declare that he would resist efforts to decrease defense spending by any
more than $11.3 billion.
However, a liberal member of his panel said the cuts were both insufficient
and aimed at the wrong targets.
The chairman, Sen. John Tower (R-Texas) said he would resist efforts to
make further across-the-board cuts in defense or to eliminate major weapons
programs he said were vital to the nation's security.
But Sen. Carl Levin (D-Mich.) a committee member often at odds with the
Pentagon's priorities, told reporters that the proposed cuts "are not enough
and they appear to be in the wrong place.
Reagan's announcement represented a victory for several presidential ad
visers and Republican congressional leaders who had urged Reagan to trim
defense spending and raise taxes in order to reduce a projected $200 billion
budget deficit that could send interest rates climbing again.
Reagan, according to White House sources, Monday authorized his eco
nomic advisers to develop so-called triggered tax increases to go into effect in
two vears if budget deficits are not reduced by a recovered, healthy economy.
Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger, who previously had argued per
sistently that Pentagon spending could not be significantly slowed without
endangering national security, came up with the 4 percent, SI 1.3 billion re
duction in the militarv funding Reagan tentatively had intended to propose
in the fiscal 1984 budget that he will send to Congress Jan. 31.
Both Reagan and Weinberger emphasized that no major weapons sys
tems, such as the MX missile or the B-l bomber, would be eliminated.
The president insisted, "It is not setting back any substantive way at all
our defense program because that still remains the top priority — the secur
ity of our people."
But, he added, "Obviously, there might (be) some things that will be
slowed a little bit, but thev are not absolutely essential to the major buildup.
So we're not reversing our course."
Reagan and Weinberger, anticipating the
almost-certain demand by many congressmen
for even deeper cuts, indicated that they al
ready had compromised about as much as they
would.
Schweiker leaves HHS post
Washington — Secretary of Health and Hu
man Services Richard Schweiker is resigning
early next month to take a job in private in
dustry, government sources said yesterday.
Schweiker, whose two years in the Cabinet
have been stormv, with fights over welfare,
medical programs, health insurance and Social
Security, would be the second Cabinet member
to resign in recent weeks and the fourth since
the start of the Reagan administration.
Schweiker has accepted the post of president
of the American Council of Life Insurance, the
spokesman for the nation's giant life-insurance
industry, with a salary reportedly in six figures,
sources said.
The resignation was not prompted by any
conflict with President Reagan, the sources
said. Schweiker was said to feel that the new
job was a "blue-ribbon offer" and "ir
resistible."
As head of the ACLI he will deal only with
life insurance, sources said, and will not get
into the health insurance area over which, as
head of H HS, he had jurisdiction.
According to one report, former represent

defeated for re-election in November after
being redistricted into the same congressional
district as Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.), is a
leading candidate to replace Schweiker. Social

Moscow — The West German Social Demo

said later that Andropov's remarks have in
creased his optimism about a possible com
promise at the Soviet-American talks in Gene

Speaking to West German journalists, Vogel
said Andropov had given him new details
about the Dec. 21 Soviet proposal to reduce the
number of Soviet medium-range missiles in
Europe to match the combined total of 162
deployed bv Britain and France. The Soviet of
fer is contingent on NATO abandoning
deployment in Western Europe of 572 cruise
and Pershing II missiles that is set to begin late
this year.
"My hopes that there will be an agreement
(in Geneva) have bv no means been reduced bv
today's discussions, but have in fact been
strengthened," Vogel said.
Vogel declined to provide details of his talks
with Andropov, saying he intends to relay
them first to the West German government of
Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
Vogel, who is his party's candidate for chan

Andropov, Vogel discuss arms
Moscow — The West German Social Demo
cratic leader, Hans Jochen Vogel, met with So
viet leader Yuri Andropov here vesterday and
said later that Andropov's remarks have in
creased his optimism about a possible com
promise at the Soviet-American talks in Gene
va on reducing medium-range nuclear weap
ons.
Speaking to West German journalists, Vogel
said Andropov had given him new details
about the Dec. 21 Soviet proposal to reduce the
number of Soviet medium-range missiles in
Europe to match the combined total of 162
deployed bv Britain and France. The Soviet of
fer is contingent on NATO abandoning
deployment in Western Europe of 572 cruise
and Pershing II missiles that is set to begin late
this year.
"My hopes that there will be an agreement
(in Geneva) have bv no means been reduced bv
today's discussions, but have in fact been
strengthened," Vogel said.
Vogel declined to provide details of his talks
with Andropov, saying he intends to relay
them first to the West German government of
Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
Vogel, who is his party's candidate for chan
cellor in West Germany's general election on
March 6, conferred with Andropov for 2 1-2
hours, an unusually long period by Soviet stan
dards.
For most of the time, the two men were ac
companied bv advisers except for about 15
minutes when Vogel and Andropov talked
privately with only interpreters present.
Reagan considers pay freeze
Washington — President Ronald Reagan is

expected to decide today whether to freeze the
pay of all federal employees, civilian and mili
tary , in an effort to keep the 1984 budget deficit
below S2OO billion, administration officials
told the Los Angeles Times vesterday.
A saving of S4 6 billion would result, they
said.
()ne of the officials said the pay freeze, to be
gin in October at the start of the 1984 fiscal
vear for 2 million civilian government workers
and 2.1 million members of the armed forces, is
virtually certain to be approved bv the presi
dent.
A strong signal ihat the presidential decision
"is cut and dried." an administration official
said, was the announcement vesterdav by Sec
retary of Defense Caspar Weinberger that the
new Pentagon buldget w ill call for a cut of more
than S8 billion in projected spending in fiscal
1984.
Members of the three uniformed services are
due for a 7.6 percent pay raise in October 1983,
on top of a 4 percent raise they received last Oc
tober. Freezing their pay now will save some
52.9 billion, according to Pentagon calcu
lations.
Civilians in the executive branch of the gov
ernment had been expected to get a 4 percent
pay increase next October, on top of a 4 per
cent raise last October, as part of a program to
maintain pav scales comparable to those in
private industrv. The rise last October cost the
government 51.7 billion, so freezing the in
crease programmed for next October is ex
pected to save a comparable amount.
Administration officials said that most of
the Pentagon budget savings that are unrelated
to inflation and fuel will come in reduced per
sonnel costs.
