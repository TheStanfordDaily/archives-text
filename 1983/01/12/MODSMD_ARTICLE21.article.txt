### Associated Press 
San Diego â€” The presidents of
two predominantly black univer
sities say a controversial measure
upgrading academic require
ments for athletes makes it
tougher for black players to at
tend large, predominantly white
institutions.
The measure, known as pro
posal 48, was passed Tuesday on
a show of hands at the annual
convention of the National Col
legiate Athletic Association fol

lowing a sometimes heated,
three-hour debate.
"I hope this message goes out
to black athletes at all institu
tions," said Dr. Joseph Johnson,
president of Grambling State.
"They don't want you at white
institutions."
"They're saying to black ath
letes, 'If you want to play basket
ball or football, stay out of white
institutions,"' said Dr. Jesse
Stone, president of Southern
University.
