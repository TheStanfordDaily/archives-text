Recent events suggest a
couple of things about the
state of basketball in the Pa
cific-10 Conference.
First, the level of play,
which in recent years had
begun to erode, is heading
back to the heights it had
fallen from.
UCLA ran roughshod over

the con
ferenceas well
as over the
rest of the
land for what
seemed like
an ice age, but
since the fall

of the House of Westwood,
the Pac-10, collectively, has
been taking a beating from its
neighboring leagues. Six timeS
in the past three NCAA tour
naments, representatives of
the West's most prestigious
conference have fallen on
their faces in their very first
post-season game.

The Odes Factor

Secondly, and partly be
cause of the aforementioned
observation, the parity of the
league is stronger at present
than it has been in the last two
decades.
Which is all good and well
for the state of Stanford
basketball, which is leading
the resurgence.
As for increased equality,
consider the chain of oc
curences in the Northwest on
the conference's opening
weekend. Oregon State beat
Stanford (without Charlie Sit
ton), then with Charlie Sitton,
lost to Cal, who in a horren
dous exhibition of basketball
two nights before, lost to Ore
gon, who in turn lost a con
vincing decision to Stanford
Saturday night.
"There's a definite move
occurring," said Oregon
coach Jim Haney after his
team's loss to Stanford.
"There's nobody in this con
ference that can't play
And Stanford is the best ex
ample of the turnaround. Led
bv coach Tom Davis, the
Cardinal has worked its way
to a 9-3 record, the third best
overall mark in the conference
(after UCLA and Washington

State). Stanford has not won
more than nine games since
1979.
It is the way in which Davis
is picking up the wins which is
most interesting. The
Cardinal is playing running,
full-court pressure basketball,
which most would have con
sidered unthinkable given
Stanford's overall team speed,
or lack thereof.
But Stanford is making it
work with a lot of sweat and
smarts. The Card not only
hustle to get in position, but
take the shortest route pos
sible to get there. And I've
never seen a team execute the
inbounds plav under its own
basket with the proficiency of
Stanford. Again and again
Revelli takes a short lob pass
inside and either sticks it in
the hole or gets fouled.
Another reason the
Cardinal is winning is because
of the attitude Davis has in
stilled in his team. Davis is
careful to never be too critical
of his players, as long as he is
getting good effort. As a re
sult, the team's attitude is con
fident and aggressive. What
right does Stanford have to be
confident and aggressive? It
starts three freshman (includ
ing one walk-on) and has not
had a winning season since
1973.
But the big difference in the
waning moments of the Ore
gon win was that the Cardinal
was running its slow-tempo
offense confidently and ag
gressively. Stanford was
playing to keep its lead, not
like in past years when it
played not to lose it and one
could see confidence.
Guards Keith Jones and
Keith Ramee ran the circle of
fense expertly and the rest of
the team followed suit, mak
ing assertive ball fakes and
passes. With the first sign of
an opening in the Duck de
fense, either Jones or Ramee
would capitalize instantly by
taking their man to the
basket.
So Stanford's improvement
is paralleling that of the
league's. One can only hope
the Cardinal's turnaround
happens just a little bit faster.
