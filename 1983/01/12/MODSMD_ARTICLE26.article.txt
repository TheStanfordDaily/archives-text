# NCAA asks anti-trust exemption
## 
### Associated Press 
San Diegoâ€” With its lucrative
football television package in leg
islative limbo, the National Col
legiate Athletic Association's
vers have drafted a bill seek
ing to make NCAA TV plans ex
empt from federal antitrust laws.
Michael Scott, of the Washing
ton law firm of Squire, Sanders &-
Dempsey, told the opening ses
sion of the NCAA's 77th annual
convention Mondav that win
ning legislative support for an
antitrust exemption would "be
difficult, but by no means im
possible."
When word of the NCAA
plans got out, the directors of the
College Football Association, a
group of major football powers
within the NCAA, voted to try
for antitrust exemption as well if
the NCAA does.
"We wouldn't want the
NCAA to have one (an exemp
tion) exclusively," said Charles
M. Neinas, executive director of
the CFA, which precipitated the
television rights squabble last
year bv making a bid to sign its
own contract for national cov
erage.'
Last November, ruling on a
suit brought against the NCAA
by the Universities of Oklahoma
and Georgia, Federal Judge Juan
Burciaga threw out the $216.5
million TV package saying it vio
lated antitrust laws and that each
NCAA member could sell its
own TV rights independently.
The NCAA appealed to the 10th
Circuit Court in Denver and're
ceived a stay pending a ruling by
that court, expected later this
winter.
