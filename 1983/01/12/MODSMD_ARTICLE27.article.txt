# Billy to manage Yanks for third time
## Steinbrenner rehires Martin again 
### Associated Press 
New York — Battlin' Billy
Martin, like a veteran boxer who
[refuses to go down for the count,
answered the bell for round three
as manager of the New York
Yankees vesterdav.
Bearing well the scars of two
previous, stormy stints as the
Yankees' skipper, Martin was ac
companied to the stadium for the
announcement by his agent,
Judge Kd Sapir of New Orleans,
and bv Yankee boss George
Steinbrenner.
Both Martin and Steinbrenner
vowed this round would be dif
ferent than the first two, when
Martin, once fired and once re
signing under pressure, left in
turmoil and, literally, a flurry of
punches.
Sources close to both the Yan
kees and Martin said the new
manager would receive about
SS(K),(KK) per year for five years,
making him the highest-paid
manager in baseball.

"We're entering a new era, for
the third time," Steinbrenner
said at a news conference.
"To be No. I in pinstripes kind
of sticks with you," said Martin,
a Yankee jersey emblazoned with
ihe numeral one hanging on the
dais in front of him. "I could
have sat out and waited for man
agers to tumble and a job to open
up. But when George called me
and I saw he was excited, and I
was excited, that was it.
"Now, it's up to me to do the
job."
Martin was fired by the Oak
land A's last Oct. 20, making him
available to the Yankees. He left
a club that finished fifth in the
American League West and in
herits from Clyde King a club
that finished fifth in the AL East
last season. King, who manageo
the Yankees for the last two
months of the 1982 season,
moves into the front office, shar
ing chief advisory duties with an
other former manager, Gene

Michael.
In becoming the first man to
gel three chances to manage the
Yankees, Martin takes his sev
enth managerial job since 1969.
The switch of managers was the
lOth for Steinbrenner since he
took over the club in January
1973, almost 10 years ago to the
day, and the fourth in one year.
Bob Lemon btf»an the 1982 sea
son, was replaced in April by
Michael who, in turn, was re
placed by King on Aug. 3.
"I've said all along that if Mr.
Steinbrenner wants Billy back,
it's fine with me," King said from
his home in Goldsboro, N.C. "I
enjoyed managing and would
have liked a full year, but he's the

boss and whatever he wants is
line."
Martin, 54, is only the fourth
man to manage a team more than
twice. Buckv Harris with the
Washington Senators and
Charlie Grimm with the Chicago
Cubs each had three tries, and
Dannv Murtaugh managed the
Pittsburgh Pirates four different
times.
Martin first managed in Min
nesota, then came jobs with the
Detroit Tigers and Texas
Rangers before he took over the
Yankees for the first time on
Aug. I, 1975, replacing Bill Vir
don. He lasted until July 1978
when he was forced to resign.
