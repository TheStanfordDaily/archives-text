### 
The Stanford men's rugby club was dealt a rude awakening to win
ter quarter by the San Francisco Rugby Club last Saturday, as it lost
two of its three games.
The 3s were the sole winners for the Cardinal, winning 20-18 on the
game's final play. The Is were outconditioned and outmuscled by a
scrappy S.K. side, 38-18. The 2s were defeated 24-0.
"They beat us fair and square," said Stanford coach Tom O'Grady
referring to the Is loss. "But the fact is that they forced us to play their
game, which intimidated us and eventually wore us down."
()'<iradv further alluded to a lack of conditioning by the team over
the holiday break, which led to a poorly played second half. Tries by
brake Rick Putnam, fullback Dave Andrews, and outside-center
Morgan Morgan, with the conversions added by Andrews, rounded
out the scoring bv the Cardinal.
I he 3s game was a see-saw battle from the start. Brake Tim Brehm
w;is stellar in the loose play, and scored an early try. Dick Price scored
two tries, including the game winner with 20 seconds remaining. The
relatively young backline tackled well, and were continuously sup
ported bv forwards Clark Beyer, Pete Lubey, and DaveGlick.
