It couldn't have happened to a nicer person.
In a devilish coup hv the Office of Public Af
fairs, the director of the tour guide service,
Karen Springen, has won the privilege of edit
ing The Stanford Daily. In a hard-fought elec
tion, election, election carried by Springen's
persuasive talents, the ultimate peacemaker
will provide the grandest four-month tour of
the campus vet seen.
Daily staffers will get a tour they will never
forget, too, as demonstrated by a special pre
view given bv Springen upon learning of her
election:
"On your left, where the Coke machine is
now, you'll soon see a Tab machine. And this
scruffy entrance will soon be just marvelous,
just as soon as I finish crocheting a new door.
"Remember those missed deadlines? Well,
they're a part of Daily history dating back to
the Navlor endorsement of Goldwater, when
the staff suspended operations for three days in

protest, but now a full-size, four-color, super
duper, new and improved wall-length chart of
deadlines should do ihe trick," the future Proc
tor and Gamble brand manager bubbled.
"And the computer system? Well, the
Burger memorial certainly hearkens back to
the days before the great typesetter fiasco,
documented in University archives, but the big
problems can all be taken care of by a little per
sonal attention.
"And here, at the night editor's desk, is
where the crucial munchie break has taken
place for longer than even Daily lore can docu
ment. And as with all great Stanford tradi
tions, this one will continue — with a bit heav
ier dose of fro-yo and air-popped popcorn."
Asked about anv conflict of interest in hold
ing the two positions, Springen replied,
"Ooooh, I've done nearly everything at the
Daily except photo and spo, and I get along
with evervone so well, 1 can't imagine any con

llict of interest."
Springen s physical prowess is legendary.
Not only has this marvel of modern technology
been able to go for months with an hour or two
of sleep a night, she has been known to exist for
seasons on only Tab and popcorn.
I he incoming editor's influence is world
wide: after crocheting her way across Europe,
she stormed the Farm with her legendary phos
phorescent minidresses and gold shoes as she
rallied her legendary campus connections.
Asked about not having time for her mystical
power with the clarinet, she replied, "I've been
blowing mv own horn long enough, ever since I
sent a tape of my playing with my Stanford ap
plication."
/\sked if she was ready to start the task,
Springen replied, "The next volume has been
years in the making. It'll be terrific, I'm just
sure."
