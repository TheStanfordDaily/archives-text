# Former Reagan adviser
## Allen to return to Hoover 
### KRISTEN CHRISTOPHER Senior staff writer 
Former National Security Adviser
Richard Allen is returning to the Hoo
ver Institution here as a senior research
fellow. However, his "by-courtesy" ap
pointment means Allen has no commit
ments to Hoover and will receive no
Compensation from the Institution.
"He probably will be associated with
us but won't be moving here and work
ing here full-time," George Marotta, a
senior research fellow and public affairs
coordinator at Hoover, said. "He prob
ably will just visit us from time to time."
Allen resigned from his post in the
Reagan White House last January in
the midst of a government investigation
into allegations that he had unethically
received gifts from Japanese officials.
He had served as national security ad
viser since the beginning of the admin
istration.
Marotta said he does not think the
past allegations against Allen will cause
any problems.
"That's sort of past ... if anything,
he might get ribbed on that and then
we'll get down to some serious dis
cussions," he said.
Allen, a Hoover senior staff member
from 1966 to 1969, is currently presi
dent of the Richard V. Allen Company,
an international consulting firm based
in Washington, D.C. He also serves as
senior counselor for foreign policy and
national security affairs to the Re

publican National Committee.
Allen is expected to continue in his
study of international relations and na
tional security affairs in his work at
Hoover. "I'm sure like the rest of us he
has a geographic focus," Marotta said,
adding that he would guess Allen is
most interested in U.S.-Soviet rela
tions.
Marotta also said he expects Allen to
participate in many seminars and con
ferences held by Hoover.
The former national security ad
visor's experience in foreign affairs was
praised by both Marotta and Hoover
Deputy Director Dennis Bark; "I'm
sure it will help in his discussions with
the Hoover people," Marotta said.
Bark said Allen's appointment is "re
ally an honor ... it is a courtesy ap
pointment in which he expressed an in
terest."
Although Bark said Allen will not re
ceive any compensation, Marotta said
Hoover may pay his travel and related
expenses. "I'm sure we'll give him some
kind of support."
On the question of whether Allen will
keep the District of Columbia as his city
of residence, Marotta said, "I assume
that is the case because he has his Wash
ington consulting firm and is associated
with the Heritage Foundation."
However, Bark said, "I don't know
what his future plans are." He said he
has not seen Allen since Allen's speech
before students at the Graduate School

of Business last spring.
Several Stanford professors have re
ceived bv-courtesy appointments from
Hoover in the past, including Heinz
Eulau, political science, and William
Goode, sociology.
