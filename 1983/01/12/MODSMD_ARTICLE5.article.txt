# University, Palo Alto hope to join cable TV systems
## 
### KATHERINE HUTT Staff writer 
The University is hoping to interface its own
planned cable communications system — called
SUnet — with a cable television system currently
being considered by the city of Paha A4to.
This move would allow University faculty and
staff home access, both on the campus and in Palo
Alto, to Stanford's computer center, the Center
for Information Technology (CIT), according to
Michael Oman, director of the University's cable
TV steering group.
At the same time, the residents of Palo Alto
would be able to receive programs originating on
campus, such as broadcasts of Lively Arts pro
grams, lectures and sports events, according to
William Yundt, director of the Network Develop
ment Division of CIT.
"What we're doing is working with the city,
jointly, to provide a system to serve all of these
people," said Paul Kaufman, a member of the
Steering Group staff.
According to Charles McNeely, assistant to the
Palo Alto city manager, "There are attractive fea
tures for Palo Alto in having Stanford a part of the
system."
A survey conducted last June of University fac
ulty and staff members living on campus and in
the neighboring city revealed that 68 percent are
interested in subscribing to a cable communica
tions system.
Respondents overwhelmingly indicated a desire
for access to interactive cable services, with home
security and electronic banking the most popular

features. In addition, they expressed an interest in
Stanford-originated cable programs, such as Live
ly Arts programs and campus lectures.
Survey respondents also showed a high degree
af erufausiasiii-for a cablc -ability to link,
home computers to the University's computer
network. T wentv percent of the Stanford residents
and 12 percent of the Palo Alto respondents cur
rently own personal computers, and an estimated
60 percent of the same group expects to own a mi
crocomputer or home terminal device within the
next five years, according to the survey findings.
Respondents said they would do about 20 per
cent of their work at home using a cable system
that could link home and office.
According to Oman and Yundt, the survey find
ings affirm what the University has suspected all
along. "The survey provided substantiation of the
desirability of a link to Palo Alto and of delivery
of program materials from the Palo Alto area to
Stanford," said Yundt.
McNeely, who had not seen the results of the
survey, said that its findings had not affected the
city's plans for a cable system.
According to Oman, "The University is not in
tending to invest in the residential cable system."
He added, "We see our financial investment in
SUnet as a contribution to an overall system."
Yundt said that some portion of SUnet will be
funded bv Stanford, but that they were also seek
ing outside sources of monev.
Yundt explained the University's need for its
own cable system. "Palo Alio is designing its sys
tem to serve the needs of the business community.

We on the other hand are an educational institu
tion," he said.
"SUnet has as its principal motivation serving
Stanford's institutional needs, and foremost
among those is the need to provide data com
munications to support the hundreds of computer
facilities and the thousands ofcomputer terminals
and personal computers," Yundt added.

SUnet has been granted "concept approval" by
the Board of Trustees, and the network design is
currently being developed. In addition, prototype
networks are being operated in the Computer Sci
ence department, the Medical Center, CIT and
other locations on campus, and work is underway
to develop the software and hardware interfaces
to permit interconnection of different kinds of
networks.
According to Yundt, "A number of the design
issues for Stanford won't be resolved until Palo
Alto is further along on its own planning (of its
cable system), particularly those issues relating to
the Stanford residential population."
According to McNeely, the city staff is current
ly trying to work out a contract with the Washing
ton, D.C. law firm of Arnold and Porter to pre
pare documents needed for solicitation of cable
system bids from private vendors.
If hired, the firm would also evaluate the bids,
finalize a system design (i.e. decide on the number
of channels, on whether the system would be in
teractive, etc.), and work out the conditions for a
joint participation in the system (for example,
with Stanford).
McNeely said that the city staff expects to have
completed negotiations with Arnold and Porter in
the next week or two, and that the firm should
submit a final report to the City Council on the re
sults of the proposals by July or August.
Once the'Council has the bids, it will compare
them to the cost of a municipally-owned system,
and decide whether they or a private vendor will
fund their system.

The University is hoping to interface its own
planned cable communications system — called
SUnet — with a cable television system currently
being considered by the city of Paha A4to.
This move would allow University faculty and
staff home access, both on the campus and in Palo
Alto, to Stanford's computer center, the Center
for Information Technology (CIT), according to
Michael Oman, director of the University's cable
TV steering group.
At the same time, the residents of Palo Alto
would be able to receive programs originating on
campus, such as broadcasts of Lively Arts pro
grams, lectures and sports events, according to
William Yundt, director of the Network Develop
ment Division of CIT.
"What we're doing is working with the city,
jointly, to provide a system to serve all of these
people," said Paul Kaufman, a member of the
Steering Group staff.
According to Charles McNeely, assistant to the
Palo Alto city manager, "There are attractive fea
tures for Palo Alto in having Stanford a part of the
system."
A survey conducted last June of University fac
ulty and staff members living on campus and in
the neighboring city revealed that 68 percent are
interested in subscribing to a cable communica
tions system.
Respondents overwhelmingly indicated a desire
for access to interactive cable services, with home
security and electronic banking the most popular

features. In addition, they expressed an interest in
Stanford-originated cable programs, such as Live
ly Arts programs and campus lectures.
Survey respondents also showed a high degree
af erufausiasiii-for a cablc -ability to link,
home computers to the University's computer
network. T wentv percent of the Stanford residents
and 12 percent of the Palo Alto respondents cur
rently own personal computers, and an estimated
60 percent of the same group expects to own a mi
crocomputer or home terminal device within the
next five years, according to the survey findings.
Respondents said they would do about 20 per
cent of their work at home using a cable system
that could link home and office.
According to Oman and Yundt, the survey find
ings affirm what the University has suspected all
along. "The survey provided substantiation of the
desirability of a link to Palo Alto and of delivery
of program materials from the Palo Alto area to
Stanford," said Yundt.
McNeely, who had not seen the results of the
survey, said that its findings had not affected the
city's plans for a cable system.
According to Oman, "The University is not in
tending to invest in the residential cable system."
He added, "We see our financial investment in
SUnet as a contribution to an overall system."
Yundt said that some portion of SUnet will be
funded bv Stanford, but that they were also seek
ing outside sources of monev.
Yundt explained the University's need for its
own cable system. "Palo Alio is designing its sys
tem to serve the needs of the business community.

We on the other hand are an educational institu
tion," he said.
"SUnet has as its principal motivation serving
Stanford's institutional needs, and foremost
among those is the need to provide data com
munications to support the hundreds of computer
facilities and the thousands ofcomputer terminals
and personal computers," Yundt added.

SUnet has been granted "concept approval" by
the Board of Trustees, and the network design is
currently being developed. In addition, prototype
networks are being operated in the Computer Sci
ence department, the Medical Center, CIT and
other locations on campus, and work is underway
to develop the software and hardware interfaces
to permit interconnection of different kinds of
networks.
According to Yundt, "A number of the design
issues for Stanford won't be resolved until Palo
Alto is further along on its own planning (of its
cable system), particularly those issues relating to
the Stanford residential population."
According to McNeely, the city staff is current
ly trying to work out a contract with the Washing
ton, D.C. law firm of Arnold and Porter to pre
pare documents needed for solicitation of cable
system bids from private vendors.
If hired, the firm would also evaluate the bids,
