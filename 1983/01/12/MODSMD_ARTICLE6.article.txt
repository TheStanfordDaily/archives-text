# Professor speaks on Martin Luther King legacy
## 
### DAVID SANCHEZ Staff writer 
Attacking everything from the Reagan adminis
tration to the tests used for college admissions, a
Rutgers University professor and minister said yes
terday the "great iegacy" of Martin Luther King is
the concept of equal opportunity.
Samuel Proctor, Martin Luther King professor of
education at Rutgers, told a predominantly black
audience of about 150 people that King was "the
product of two strong movements in this country
that have never received the attention that they de
serve."
One movement, according to Proctor, was the
founding and development of private church-re
lated black colleges in the South following and im
mediately before the Civil War.
"A lot of people do not know that the black
middle class today rests solidly on the efforts made
in the establishment of these colleges," said Proctor.
King attended one of those schools as an under
graduate.
"Here is a tradition," Proctor explained, "a tradi
tion that said that black people would not advance if
caught on the slow pace designed by the states and
counties of the Southland, that there would be no
slow un folding of opportunity as everybody thought
over there . . . But there would be this sudden in
novation teaching these people philosophy and
Latin and all of these arts and sciences to prepare
them to make one big leap from where they were: ex
slaves to leaders, preachers, and teachers and scien
tists and thinkers.
"So here we stand todav with what modicum of a
middle class that we mav have, and with what little
intellectual vanguard there may be amongst us —
here we stand because of this intervention. And

Martin Luther King was a part of that tradition."
Proctor said that this tradition "explains so
much" about King: "his pride, his sense of self, his
ability to move around without apology, and his
sense of destiny that has pervaded through our peo
ple."
Proctor's stirring speech elicited more than a few
"Amens" from members of the Kresge audience,
who received his message enthusiastically.
Proctor said that white Americans were not ready
for the self-assured black man. "That's why King
was a shock and surprise to them," said Proctor.
"Thev didn't know where a black man (like him)
came from ... But thev saw him as some kind of
monstrosity. They were not accustomed to dealing
with black people who felt accomplished and se
cure."
The second tradition from which King came was,
according to Proctor, the liberal Protestant move
ment that reached its peak in this country in the
19205.
Proctor complained that the current American
fundamentalism, in contrast to the liberal Protes
tant school of thought, is neglecting "the social
teachings of Jesus and his moral example"
"My conclusion," said Proctor, "is that the
strong moral tenets of the Judeo-Christian tradition
are all but lost in these days and times."
Proctor attacked the Reagan administration's
stance on many black issues.
He said that Reagan insulted black people "by
saving that Bob Jones University ought not to be pe
nalized for restricting black and white dating." This,
according to Proctor, was like making an announce
ment to the whole world, "with no sense of shame
whatsoever," that "black folk have no feelings, have
no pride."

He also attacked Reagan for appointments he's
made to the Civil Rights Commission (CRC) and
the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission,
describing the head of the CRC, Clarence Pend
leton, as a man who "has no background in civil
rights, a man who talks about black folk not needing
federal assistance, who himself had a federal loan
. . . who hasn't paid taxes in four years, and who
didn't vote."
"These folk do not intend to harm us," said Proc
tor, "they just do not want to be held responsible for
doing us any good."
The Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT), a factor in
the admissions decisions of many colleges, including
Stanford, also hinders black advancement, accord
ing to Proctor.
Refering to the SAT preparatory courses that
"middle-class white people" send their children to,
Proctor described the tests as primarily reflecting
"privilege and opportunity and experience made
available."
The "great legacy" left to us by King is, according
to Proctor, the notion of equal opportunity. "De
spite the frustrations and embarrassments, in the
end. those who do get a chance will measure up, and
equal opportunity will become a fact amongst us.. .
If you crack the door and give bright people a
chance, they'll show you how senseless some of
those criteria were that kept us out of these institu
tions," he said.
"All we need to do is to give people a chance at
fulfillment, development, at exploring their gifts.
You'll find out that this thing that is such a problem,
and an ache and a pain to everybody turns out to be
one of the finest things that we could do in the name
of justice, in the name of humanity. And this is the
great legacy of Martin Luther King, Jr.," he said.

according to Proctor, was like making an announce
ment to the whole world, "with no sense of shame
whatsoever," that "black folk have no feelings, have
no pride."

He also attacked Reagan for appointments he's
made to the Civil Rights Commission (CRC) and
the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission,
describing the head of the CRC, Clarence Pend
leton, as a man who "has no background in civil
rights, a man who talks about black folk not needing
federal assistance, who himself had a federal loan
. . . who hasn't paid taxes in four years, and who
didn't vote."
"These folk do not intend to harm us," said Proc
tor, "they just do not want to be held responsible for
doing us any good."
The Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT), a factor in
the admissions decisions of many colleges, including
Stanford, also hinders black advancement, accord
ing to Proctor.
Refering to the SAT preparatory courses that
"middle-class white people" send their children to,
Proctor described the tests as primarily reflecting
"privilege and opportunity and experience made
available."
The "great legacy" left to us by King is, according
to Proctor, the notion of equal opportunity. "De
spite the frustrations and embarrassments, in the
end. those who do get a chance will measure up, and
equal opportunity will become a fact amongst us.. .
If you crack the door and give bright people a
chance, they'll show you how senseless some of
those criteria were that kept us out of these institu
tions," he said.
"All we need to do is to give people a chance at
fulfillment, development, at exploring their gifts.
You'll find out that this thing that is such a problem,
and an ache and a pain to everybody turns out to be
one of the finest things that we could do in the name
of justice, in the name of humanity. And this is the
great legacy of Martin Luther King, Jr.," he said.
Attacking everything from the Reagan adminis
tration to the tests used for college admissions, a
Rutgers University professor and minister said yes
terday the "great iegacy" of Martin Luther King is
the concept of equal opportunity.
Samuel Proctor, Martin Luther King professor of
education at Rutgers, told a predominantly black
audience of about 150 people that King was "the
product of two strong movements in this country
that have never received the attention that they de
serve."
One movement, according to Proctor, was the
founding and development of private church-re
lated black colleges in the South following and im
mediately before the Civil War.
"A lot of people do not know that the black
middle class today rests solidly on the efforts made
in the establishment of these colleges," said Proctor.
King attended one of those schools as an under
graduate.
"Here is a tradition," Proctor explained, "a tradi
tion that said that black people would not advance if
caught on the slow pace designed by the states and
counties of the Southland, that there would be no
slow un folding of opportunity as everybody thought
over there . . . But there would be this sudden in
novation teaching these people philosophy and
Latin and all of these arts and sciences to prepare
them to make one big leap from where they were: ex
slaves to leaders, preachers, and teachers and scien
tists and thinkers.
"So here we stand todav with what modicum of a
middle class that we mav have, and with what little
intellectual vanguard there may be amongst us —
here we stand because of this intervention. And

Martin Luther King was a part of that tradition."
Proctor said that this tradition "explains so
much" about King: "his pride, his sense of self, his
ability to move around without apology, and his
sense of destiny that has pervaded through our peo
ple."
Proctor's stirring speech elicited more than a few
"Amens" from members of the Kresge audience,
who received his message enthusiastically.
Proctor said that white Americans were not ready
for the self-assured black man. "That's why King
was a shock and surprise to them," said Proctor.
"Thev didn't know where a black man (like him)
came from ... But thev saw him as some kind of
monstrosity. They were not accustomed to dealing
with black people who felt accomplished and se
cure."
The second tradition from which King came was,
according to Proctor, the liberal Protestant move
ment that reached its peak in this country in the
19205.
Proctor complained that the current American
fundamentalism, in contrast to the liberal Protes
tant school of thought, is neglecting "the social
teachings of Jesus and his moral example"
"My conclusion," said Proctor, "is that the
strong moral tenets of the Judeo-Christian tradition
are all but lost in these days and times."
Proctor attacked the Reagan administration's
stance on many black issues.
He said that Reagan insulted black people "by
saving that Bob Jones University ought not to be pe
nalized for restricting black and white dating." This,
according to Proctor, was like making an announce
ment to the whole world, "with no sense of shame
whatsoever," that "black folk have no feelings, have
no pride."

He also attacked Reagan for appointments he's
made to the Civil Rights Commission (CRC) and
the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission,
describing the head of the CRC, Clarence Pend
leton, as a man who "has no background in civil

federal assistance, who himself had a federal loan
. . . who hasn't paid taxes in four years, and who
didn't vote."

tor, "they just do not want to be held responsible for
doing us any good."
