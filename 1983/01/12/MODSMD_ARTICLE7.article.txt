## Bulimia: the 'secret' eating disorder 
### MARINA PICCIOTTO 
The avejage Stanford student has proba
bly heard of anorexia nervosa, a psychologi
cal disease that makes an adolescent girl con
tinue dieting until she becomes too thin to
function. Most people, however, have not
heard of bulimia, a more common eating dis
order. Bulimics may be normal or slightly
overweight. They may eat normally at most
times and in addition, most bulimics try to
hide the signs of their disorder as though it
were shameful. This makes it harder to iden
tify a bulimic than an anorectic.
Bulimia is different from anorexia in that
bulimia involves periods of uncontrollable
eating (usually of unhealthy or junk foods) to
the point of painful fullness and then forcing
\>neself to vomit out the food. This is gener
ally followed by self-reproach and anger and,
as mentioned before, a feeling that the whole
thing must be kept secret. Although bulimics
can usually live normally, bulimia involves a
psychological problem just as anorexia does.
Bulimia is far less serious than anorexia,
however, since it is generally not life

threatening.
Dr. David Dorosin, director of Counsel
ling and Psychological Services (CAPS) at
Stanford discussed the prevalence of eating
disorders here. "We have seen any
where from 40 to 50 cases of bulimia a
year in the last couple of years as compared
to maybe five cases of anorexia a year."
Bulimia has only been recognized as a dis
ease in the last eight to 10 years although it
has been around longer than that.
Anorexia was a documented disease
as far back as the 19th century but both
disorders seem more common today than
they have been in the past. Dorosin attri
butes this more to a greater awareness and
recognition of these disorders than to a true
increase of their incidence.
Since anorexia involves a conviction by the
victim that she is still fat even when she ap
pears emaciated to another person, most
anorectics are brought in by a friend, an R.A.,
or a family member. Anorectics are usually
referred to the Stanford Hospital or other
suitable medical facilities for long-term

therapy because of the difficulty of treating
the disease.
Bulimia is far easier to treat, however, and
bulimics often come in for treatment on their
own. CAPS has had great success in counsel
ling bulimics thus far. Marilyn Reed Hoskins,
codirector of one of the two year-long groups
for therapy with bulimics at CAPS, said that
treatment is often effective in controlling
bulimia within a few months. Anorectics
often remain in therapy for many years.
One reason that bulimia may be more pre
valent at Stanford than anorexia is the age
group that each disease affects most fre
quently. Anorexia is associated with a fear of
becoming an adult and thus affects the ado
lescent girl who is beginning to menstruate
and develop breasts. The weight loss as
sociated with anorexia generally stops
menstruation and flattens the chest, prevent
ing the outward signs of approaching
womanhood.
Bulimia seems to be related to unex
pressed fears about autonomy and indepen
dence from home. The eating takes the place
of expressing emotions such as anxiety, anger
or sadness. The vomiting and self-reproach
are sometimes an expression of the frustra
tion of holding these feelings in. Both Doro
sin and Hoskins expressed concern that the
feelings of shame connected with bulimia
often keep the bulimic from seeking help,
even when they recognize the problem.
Much is still unknown about eating disor
ders. Although anorexia and bulimia are
generally accepted as psychological prob
lems, it is not known whether there is some
chemical factor that contributes to their oc
curence. It is also not known why females are
more likely to have these disorders than
males (approximately 90 percent of anorec
tics and bulimics are female). The new
awareness of these problems by both the
medical profession and the public is con
tributing greatly to success in diagnosing and
treating anorexia and bulimia.
"Five years ago if you had asked me what
the most common eating disorder was," said
Dorosin, "I would have said over-eating."

are sometimes an expression of the frustra
tion of holding these feelings in. Both Doro
sin and Hoskins expressed concern that the
feelings of shame connected with bulimia
often keep the bulimic from seeking help,
even when they recognize the problem.
Much is still unknown about eating disor
ders. Although anorexia and bulimia are
generally accepted as psychological prob
lems, it is not known whether there is some
chemical factor that contributes to their oc
curence. It is also not known why females are
more likely to have these disorders than
males (approximately 90 percent of anorec
tics and bulimics are female). The new
awareness of these problems by both the
medical profession and the public is con
tributing greatly to success in diagnosing and
treating anorexia and bulimia.
"Five years ago if you had asked me what
the most common eating disorder was," said
Dorosin, "I would have said over-eating."
