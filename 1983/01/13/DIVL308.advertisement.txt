"Before it is too late, we must narrow the gaping
chasm between our proclamations of peace and our
lowly deeds which precipitate and perpetuate war.
we are called upon to look up from the quagmire of
military programs and defense commitments and
read the warnings on history's signposts."
Martin Luthw King, Jr., 1967
Although written in 1967, the meaning conveyed in these words
still rings clear today. If you have been worried lately about the fate
of peace, come to the MARTIN LUTHER KINO
