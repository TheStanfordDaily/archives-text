PROGRAM IN HUMAN BIOLOGY announces:
HB9O
HUMAN NATURE:
THE HUMAN ANIMAL
Monday & Thursday, 3:15-5:05
Open to all students ...
There are certain questions about ourselves that have been of concern to thinking people for millenia:
istherea"human nature"?arewe naturally aggressive? can the brain grow and change? how far can
we go beyond our biological inheritance? are men more aggressive than women? are there basic
emotions?
In the past few decades a new human science has developed, one that is beginning to provide
answers to some of the most basic questions. This course is a new one, one which will bring some of
the most important experts in the human sciences together, so that students can read important
recent works, and speak to authorities themselves. The course takes several of the most important
questions and treats them in depth: the nature of Early man; what specifically does make us human;
what does natural selection select; how does evolution operate; why do males actthe way they do in
matters of sex, and is this biologically different than females; what is basic to the human brain that is
different to other brains; how does the brain grow and change with experience. The end of the course
will be an intensive discussion, in a special seminar on the psychological effects on health and the
immune system.
Like it or not, many of the most important aspects of being human are built up on a basis common to
other animals.What are these bases that we share with others, and what is distinctively human.
Emotions, for instance, were here before we were.
Some of the guest speakers will include:
Donald Johansen, author of Lucy
Stephen Jay Gould, author of The Pandas Thumb
Donald Symons, author of The Evolution of Human Sexuality
Paul Ekman, author of Emotions in the Human Face
Other lectures will consider: How the brain grows and develops, the Divided Brain (Left and
Right Hemispheres), the search for memory in the brain, psychoimmunology.
The course is organized by Robert Ornstein, author of The Psychology of Consciousness.
THE FIRST COURSE MEETING WILL BE HELD ON
MONDAY, JANUARY 10, 1983 in 260-268.
