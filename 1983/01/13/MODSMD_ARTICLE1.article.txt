# Top University officials in forum, discount rapid tuition growth
## 
### KATHY BODOVITZ Senior staff writer 
A Stanford senior graduating in the
year 2000 will probably have paid
about $180,000 for four years on the
Farm while most members of the class
of '83 will be 37 years old then and
earning about $100,000 per year, esti
mated Raymond Bacchetti, director of
University budgets.
Bacchetti, along with University
President Donald Kennedy, Provost
Albert Hastorf and William Massy,
vice president for business and finance,
discussed tuition last night at a forum
presented by the ASSU Task Force on
Tuition and the ASSU Speakers
Bureau.
This group of top University ad
ministrators spoke to approximately 50
students in a near-empty Dinkelspiel
Auditorium. Kennedy commented that
the speakers "will not conclude from

the relatively low attendance tonight
that you are deeply satisfied with the
current trajectory of tuition and that
we are therefore free to move it as our
ambitions suggest."
Bacchetti said he based his salary es
timate on the assumption that most
Stanford students will probably follow
a professional or managerial tract.
While the dollar amount of tuition
has steadily increased, Bacchetti said,
"In general it is true that college costs
the same proportion of income today
that it cost 10 years ago.
"A recent study by the National
Commission on Student Financial As
sistance demonstrated that the income
of parents with children in college rose
at an average annual rate of about 7.5
percent over the last decade — and so
did college costs in general."
Admitting that Stanford costs rose
faster than "in general" — at a rate of

about 10 or 11 percent depending on
the specific factors included — Bac
chetti said, "I'd make a small wager
that on the average (the income of par
ents of Stanford students) probably ex
ceeded that of the general population.
"At any rate, it's a close call as to
whether Stanford costs more in rela
tion to income now than in 1970," Bac
chetti added.
Bacchetti discussed tuition as a cost
— to students and their parents. Com
pared to Brown, Cornell, Dartmouth,
Harvard, M.1.T., Princeton and Yale
— institutions with whom Stanford has
the most candidates for the freshman
class in common — Bacchetti said Stan
ford's tuition this year is about $150
less than the average of those seven
schools. He said last year it was about
$100 less than the average and for the
four preceding years it was $50-$ 100
above the average.

He added that the seven schools plus
Stanford also compare closely in the
rate of tuition increase. The average
increase of tuition this year over last
year among the seven schools was 15.7
percent while Stanford's tuition went
up 15.1 percent.
Comparing Stanford's increases to
the general economy, Massy said that
between 1971 and 1981 the Consumer
Price Index rose 10.6 percent and Stan
ford's operating budget rose a close
10.2 percent. During the same period,
Stanford tuition rose an average of
10.1 percent, the endowment rose 13.2
percent, income from gifts and grants
rose 10.4 percent, and research volume
rose a larger 15 percent.
Kennedy explained that on a year
to-year basis the University does not
have much control over its sources of
income, such as indirect cost recovery

RUNNING OUT OF STEAM?: The tunnels that now carry steam throughout the University will possibly be

from the government on research done
here, gifts, and land lease income. "The
parameter of income over which we
have some little control is the largest
one — tuition," Kennedy said.
But he added, "We don't want to
move tuition at a rate that makes it
impossible for students who want to
come here."
Of the total operating budget, Massy
said 45 percent is spent on instruction
and departmental research (not spon
sored by an outside organization). The
next largest portion, 16 percent, goes
to operations and maintenance, includ
ing energy costs, which he noted have
risen dramatically. The next item, ad
ministration, receives 12 percent; li
braries receive 9.9 percent; student
services receive 6.6 percent; student
aid receives 5.9 percent, and general
expenses such as development receive
5.2 percent.
In describing the budget process this
year, Hastorf said that after receiving
the inflation predictions of local mac
roeconomists, he sent letters to all the
school deans asking how they would
cut 5 percent from their budgets and
what the consequences of the cuts
would be. Last year Hastorf asked the
deans to cut 1 percent.
The request for a 5 percent cut stems
from Hastorf s belief that," We have to
work on getting our tuition increase
down to less than the predicted 12 per
cent (announced to the Faculty Senate
earlier this year)."
A consideration is maintaining
the possibility of innovation. Hastorf
said that amidst the 5 percent cut he
would still try to have a tiny bit of new
program money. "It is crucial to keep
some atmosphere of pushing forward.
The deans will have to cut back, but
they will also have a crack at some new
money," he said.
