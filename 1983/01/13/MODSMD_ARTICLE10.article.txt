# Expanding lobbying future
## 
### 
We must admit that we were a bit skeptical
about the ASSU's plans for a new lobbying office.
What could anyone hope to accomplish with the
paltry $145 allocated by the ASSU, we pondered.
On further reflection, however, we began to see
that this latest action could go far beyond the sim
ple fulfillment of an idealistic campaign pledge.
Few students today are speaking out on impor
tant issues, even though the issues may affect their
lives in very direct ways. Now, more than ever,
there is a need for students to inform legislators of
their priorities. The ASSU effort to create an or
ganization that will encourage and coordinate stu
dent lobbying could prove fruitful, especially if
additional funding for a student lobby office is
found.
The current lack of funding is not the only prob
lem that the newly invented lobby office faces.
Lobbying offices are traditionally partisan, repre
senting only the specific interests of its supporters.
We wonder how the lobby could determine exactly
what students want, even in areas like educational
funding where student interest is relatively
homogeneous. Yolanda Townsend, Council of
Presidents (COP) member and author of the pro
posal which led to the creation of the lobby, stated
that a student body office could coordinate efforts

with the Stanford Progressive Alliance and the
Graduate Student Association, but failed to men
tion other student groups like the Stanford Con
servative Political Alliance in the same breath.
Would the lobby office coordinate its efforts with
this group too, or would only some students, rather
than all members of the ASSU be represented?
Our conception of what the role of the student
lobby office should be may differ from what is
currently envisioned by the COP. Rather than
have the ASSU waste an inordinate amount of its
time — time it could use to lobby the administra
tion — determining exactly what stands the lobby
will take, it should direct the lobby office to act as a
source of information and encouragement open to
all students, rather than as an advocate of particu
lar positions.
We certainly applaud the ASSU's interest in
making legislators more aware of student needs,
specifically the needs of students here. But we
hope ASSU leaders will seriously consider the
problems of funding the lobby office and of defin
ing exactly what its role will be. More student
voices need to be heard in legislators' offices across
the country and what the ASSU has done so far is a
good first step. We hope that the pace will not be
broken.
