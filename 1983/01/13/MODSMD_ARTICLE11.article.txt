## Grads shouldn't pay for undergrad housing 
### 
We read with interest the Daily's
editorial (Jan. 3) supporting the princi
ple that student housing rates should be
the same for residents of Governor's
Corner as for occupants of older or
less desirable campus residences. What
this editorial overlooked, however, was
the existence of a group of students
occupying on-campus housing who
enjoy the dubious privilege of paying
for Governor's Corner but who have
no chance of living there: graduate stu
dents.
Graduate students living in Escon
dido Village will pay $1.1 million in
rents in 1982-83 above the actual costs
associated with providing their housing
(including their share of housing sys
tem overhead costs). This money is
going to subsidize housing for under
graduates, and specifically to pay the
mortgage on Governor's Corner,
which this year increased the annual
debt service of the housing system from
$2 million to $3.56 million and will

increase it by an additional $2 million
in 1983-84.
While spreading this cost among all
undergraduates living on campus may
be justified by the fact that they each
have a roughly equal chance through
the housing draw of living in the new
housing complex, no such argument
applies to graduate students, who have
no chance of enjoying the benefits of
living in Governor's Corner yet are
being asked to pay for it.
However, the Daily's oversight may
be more readily understood (if not ex
cused) once one realizes that the edito
rial was completely consistent with of
ficial University policy. As graduate
student members of the Task Group ou
Housing Rates, which has just com
pleted a lengthy process of reviewing
rents charged in student housing, we
argued that graduate students should
not have to bear the costs associated
with the construction of new under
graduate housing, but were informed

that this policy was not subject to de
bate.
Our objections to this policy will be
spelled out at greater length in the
minority report which we will be sub
mitting to the Task Force. Stated
briefly, we are unpersuaded by the jus
tice of (as opposed to, say, the Universi
ty's claims as to the financial necessity
of) requiring graduate students living
in graduate housing to pay higher rents
in order to finance expensive new un
dergraduate housing in which they are
barred from living.
