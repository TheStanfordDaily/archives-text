# Sanctioning military repression
## 
### 
Buried somewhere between the
news of impending $200 billion deficits
and continuing record levels of unem
ployment, reports are surfacing of two
events which are more fundamentally
indicative of the failures of the Reagan
administration and, by implication, of
the United States itself. The firsi m
these is the upcoming certification pro
cess in which President Reagan is re
quired to show Congress that the gov
ernment of El Salvador is enforcing
human rights as a precondition for
sending further military aid. The sec
ond is Reagan's recent renewal of mili
tary sales to the government of
Guatemala over the objections of
numerous human rights organizations.
This action leaves little doubt, if, in
deed, there was any in the first place,
over the outcome of the certification
process. The very process of certifica
tion, which Congress intended as a
guarantee of human rights in El Sal
vador has become instead a dance of
deception that the Reagan administra
tion performs every six months,
thereby displaying its reckless disre
gard for human rights.
The Congressionally mandated cer
tification requirement actually includes
three specific provisions which the
president must certify. The first of
these is that the government of El Sal
vador is making a concerted and signif
icant effort to comply with internation
ally recognized human rights by con
trolling all elements of its armed forces.
Obviously, there is some room for in
terpretation within the ambiguous
term "concerted and significant ef
fort," but it is equally obvious that the
administration's apparent standard of
progress as that of 400 rather than 600
murders each month by Salvadoran
government troops is unacceptable.
Furthermore, there is no indication
that the Salvadoran government has
made even such a limited and cynical
effort as this standard suggests. Several
human rights organizations, including
Amnesty International and Americas
Watch, have reported that massacres of
non-combatants and cases of selective
torture and assassination committed by
government troops have continued un
abated. Even Reagan's own ambas
sador to El Salvador, Deane Hinton,
recently noted the more than 30,000
deaths that have occurred there over
the past three years and charged that
the "mafia of the right" was destroying
El Salvador.
The second provision of certification
requires Reagan to affir.n that the gov
ernment of El Salvador has demon
strated its good faith efforts to begin
discussions with all factions willing to
negotiate a peaceful political solution
to the civil war. Certification of this
point requires nothing less than the
total suspension of disbelief. The Sal
vadoran government has rejected re
peated offers of negotiations from the
opposition, and it has rejected numer
ous peace proposals from the govern
ments of Venezuela, France, Mexico
and Colombia as well. After one well
publicized negotiation offer by the op
position made in Mexico City last Oc
tober, Roberto D'Aubuisson, leader of
El Salvador's constituent assembly, de
clared that "We will permit neither
dialogue nor negotiations with the
criminal groups." This determination
was underscored in late October when
15 members of the peaceful political
opposition were abducted and eight of
them later turned up in the hands of the
military. The remaining seven are still
unaccounted for. This method of deal
ing with the moderate political opposi
tion demonstrates the complete lack of
interest the government has in any
peacefully negotiated settlement of its
conflict with the guerrillas.
The third aspect of certification that
Reagan must defy truth to support is
the proposition that the Salvadoran
government is making continued prog
ress in implementing essential eco
nomic and social reforms, including its
land reform program. The rightist gov
ernment that was installed last March
in what was misleadingly sold to the
American public as a free election — as
if any such thing could take place when

the failure to vote carried a very real
threat of harsh punishment by govern
ment troops who checked IDs to see
who had voted — has successively de
stroyed each of the three phases of the
land reform program that it inherited.
The New York Times reported last Sep
tember that the government agency re
sponsible for carrying out land reforms
had been overtaken by rightists repre
senting the major landed interests, and
the few peasants who benefited from
the first steps of land reform have been
forcibly evicted.

General Rios Montt, who came to power in a
coup in Guatemala last March and whom
Reagan declared had received a'bum rap* from
the media, was charged by Amnesty
International of presiding over a government
whose troops were responsible for the massacre
of 2600 peasant in the first three months of
Montfs reign.

One final issue of the certification
process, while not formally included in
the certification legislation, is consid
ered to pose an additional constraint on
further military aid to the Salvadoran
regime. This is the requirement that the
Salvadoran government make a good
faith effort to investigate the murders
of four U.S. nuns and two U.S. labor
leaders in El Salvador in 1980 and
1981. While the government did make
some token attempts at prosecuting
those responsible, the courts balked at
prosecuting the high-level officers re
sponsible when it became clear that
they had the support of prominent gov
ernment officials, including
D'Aubuisson. As The New York Times
editorialized in November, "The Re
agan administration cannot plausibly
certify Salvador's eligibility for aid
under American law if its courts do
nothing about the higher-ups who or
dered the murder of two American
land reform advisors and a peasant
leader in 1981."
The Reagan administration's policy
toward Guatemala has followed a pat
tern dishearteningly similar to that es
tablished by its repeated renewals of
military aid to El Salvador through the

expedient of making false certifications
of progress. Reagan's recent renewal of
military sales to Guatemala on the
basis of alleged improvements in
human rights there flies in the face of
the reality of repressive policies that
The Boston Globe aptly characterized
as "somewhere between a pogrom and
genocide." General Rios Montt, who
came to power in a coup in Guatemala
last March and whom Reagan declared
had received a "bum rap" from the
media, was charged by Amnesty Inter
national with presiding over a govern-

ment whose troops were responsible
for the massacre of 2600 peasants in
the first three months of Montt's reign.
As Congressman Tom Harkin, whose
resolution against the renewal of arms
sales to Guatemala has already
gathered 76 co-sponsors in the House,
said of Reagan's policy, "the'quiet' the
administration cites as justification for
the sales is the quiet of the dead."
As long as the administration hears
only the quiet of the dead in Central
America, peasants will continue to die
at the hands of American weapons in
the meaningless name of an anti
communist policy that purports to de
fend the very rights that it denies. The
only hope that remains is that Congress
will take time out between trying to
balance the budget and attempting to
rectify Social Security in order to turn
its ears toward Central America during
the certification process next week. If it
does, it will hear cries for justice and
freedom from oppression and the
sounds of life under pain. If it listens
closely, it will hear them falling silent
one by one.

position made in Mexico City last Oc
tober, Roberto D'Aubuisson, leader of
El Salvador's constituent assembly, de
clared that "We will permit neither
dialogue nor negotiations with the
criminal groups." This determination
was underscored in late October when
15 members of the peaceful political
opposition were abducted and eight of
them later turned up in the hands of the
military. The remaining seven are still
unaccounted for. This method of deal
ing with the moderate political opposi
tion demonstrates the complete lack of
interest the government has in any
peacefully negotiated settlement of its
conflict with the guerrillas.
The third aspect of certification that
Reagan must defy truth to support is
the proposition that the Salvadoran
government is making continued prog
ress in implementing essential eco
nomic and social reforms, including its
land reform program. The rightist gov
ernment that was installed last March
in what was misleadingly sold to the
American public as a free election — as
if any such thing could take place when

the failure to vote carried a very real
threat of harsh punishment by govern
ment troops who checked IDs to see
who had voted — has successively de
stroyed each of the three phases of the
land reform program that it inherited.
The New York Times reported last Sep
tember that the government agency re
sponsible for carrying out land reforms
had been overtaken by rightists repre
senting the major landed interests, and
the few peasants who benefited from
the first steps of land reform have been
forcibly evicted.

General Rios Montt, who came to power in a
coup in Guatemala last March and whom
Reagan declared had received a'bum rap* from
the media, was charged by Amnesty
International of presiding over a government
whose troops were responsible for the massacre
of 2600 peasant in the first three months of
Montfs reign.

One final issue of the certification
process, while not formally included in
the certification legislation, is consid
ered to pose an additional constraint on
further military aid to the Salvadoran
regime. This is the requirement that the
Salvadoran government make a good
faith effort to investigate the murders
of four U.S. nuns and two U.S. labor
leaders in El Salvador in 1980 and
1981. While the government did make
some token attempts at prosecuting
those responsible, the courts balked at
prosecuting the high-level officers re
sponsible when it became clear that
they had the support of prominent gov
ernment officials, including
D'Aubuisson. As The New York Times
editorialized in November, "The Re
agan administration cannot plausibly
certify Salvador's eligibility for aid
under American law if its courts do
nothing about the higher-ups who or
dered the murder of two American
land reform advisors and a peasant
leader in 1981."
The Reagan administration's policy
toward Guatemala has followed a pat
tern dishearteningly similar to that es
tablished by its repeated renewals of
military aid to El Salvador through the

expedient of making false certifications
of progress. Reagan's recent renewal of
military sales to Guatemala on the
basis of alleged improvements in
human rights there flies in the face of
the reality of repressive policies that
The Boston Globe aptly characterized
as "somewhere between a pogrom and
genocide." General Rios Montt, who
came to power in a coup in Guatemala
last March and whom Reagan declared
had received a "bum rap" from the
media, was charged by Amnesty Inter
national with presiding over a govern-

ment whose troops were responsible
for the massacre of 2600 peasants in
the first three months of Montt's reign.
As Congressman Tom Harkin, whose
resolution against the renewal of arms
sales to Guatemala has already
gathered 76 co-sponsors in the House,
said of Reagan's policy, "the'quiet' the
administration cites as justification for
the sales is the quiet of the dead."
As long as the administration hears
only the quiet of the dead in Central
America, peasants will continue to die
at the hands of American weapons in
the meaningless name of an anti
communist policy that purports to de
fend the very rights that it denies. The
only hope that remains is that Congress
will take time out between trying to
balance the budget and attempting to
rectify Social Security in order to turn
its ears toward Central America during
the certification process next week. If it
does, it will hear cries for justice and
freedom from oppression and the
sounds of life under pain. If it listens
closely, it will hear them falling silent
one by one.

Buried somewhere between the
news of impending $200 billion deficits
and continuing record levels of unem
ployment, reports are surfacing of two
events which are more fundamentally
indicative of the failures of the Reagan
administration and, by implication, of
the United States itself. The firsi m
these is the upcoming certification pro
cess in which President Reagan is re
quired to show Congress that the gov
ernment of El Salvador is enforcing
human rights as a precondition for
sending further military aid. The sec
ond is Reagan's recent renewal of mili
tary sales to the government of
Guatemala over the objections of
numerous human rights organizations.
This action leaves little doubt, if, in
deed, there was any in the first place,
over the outcome of the certification
process. The very process of certifica
tion, which Congress intended as a
guarantee of human rights in El Sal
vador has become instead a dance of
deception that the Reagan administra
tion performs every six months,
thereby displaying its reckless disre
gard for human rights.
The Congressionally mandated cer
tification requirement actually includes
three specific provisions which the
president must certify. The first of
these is that the government of El Sal
vador is making a concerted and signif
icant effort to comply with internation
ally recognized human rights by con
trolling all elements of its armed forces.
Obviously, there is some room for in
terpretation within the ambiguous
term "concerted and significant ef
fort," but it is equally obvious that the
administration's apparent standard of
progress as that of 400 rather than 600
murders each month by Salvadoran
government troops is unacceptable.
Furthermore, there is no indication
that the Salvadoran government has
made even such a limited and cynical
effort as this standard suggests. Several
human rights organizations, including
Amnesty International and Americas
Watch, have reported that massacres of
non-combatants and cases of selective
torture and assassination committed by
government troops have continued un
abated. Even Reagan's own ambas
sador to El Salvador, Deane Hinton,
recently noted the more than 30,000
deaths that have occurred there over
the past three years and charged that
the "mafia of the right" was destroying
El Salvador.
The second provision of certification
requires Reagan to affir.n that the gov
ernment of El Salvador has demon
strated its good faith efforts to begin
discussions with all factions willing to
negotiate a peaceful political solution
to the civil war. Certification of this
point requires nothing less than the
total suspension of disbelief. The Sal
vadoran government has rejected re
peated offers of negotiations from the
opposition, and it has rejected numer
ous peace proposals from the govern
ments of Venezuela, France, Mexico
and Colombia as well. After one well
publicized negotiation offer by the op
position made in Mexico City last Oc
tober, Roberto D'Aubuisson, leader of
El Salvador's constituent assembly, de
clared that "We will permit neither
dialogue nor negotiations with the
criminal groups." This determination
