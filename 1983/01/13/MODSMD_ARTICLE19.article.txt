## 'The Verdict' is in: directors indicted, Newman wins 
### STEVE VINEBERG 
Sidney Lumet's movies have
begun to acquire a joyless, self
important self-consciousness. 1
could barely make it all the way
through his three-hour treatise
on police corruption and guilt,
Prince of the City, because for all
the screaming tirades the large
cast of characters hurled at each
other, I was never sure what
Lumet's point of view was, and
after the first hour I had stopped
being able to tell the supporting
players apart. He must think he's

by the negligence of a doctor
who administered the wrong
anesthetic to her, he sees a
chance to redeem himself and
reverse the course of his profes
sional life, and so he refuses to be
paid off by the eminent law firm
defending the hospital and the
diocese on whose land the hospi
tal sits.
Paul Newman is a terrific actor
who has been getting better in
the last few years, in movies like
Buffalo Bill and the Indians, Slap
Shot, Fort Apache, the Bronx and
Absence of Malice; and on and
off he gives a very good perform
ance in The Verdict: He gets Gal
vin's exhaustion down in the first
scenes: he walks slowly, with dif
ficulty, up stairs, and the effort
tells in his hoarse, breathless
voice. Polishing himself up for a
new client, he squirts Murine in
his eyes and dabs them with his
handkerchief, showing the grim
experience of a man whose
livelihood depends on convinc
ing strangers of his respectabil
ity. But though Mamet works in
suggestions of dark corners in
Galvin's character, he cleans
them out before we've had the
opportunity to consider their
implications. The plaintiff's
brother-in-law, whose plan to
move with his wife to another
city is ruined by Frank's insis
tence on taking the case to court,
accuses him of using his clients
for his own selfish ends, and the
movie might be fascinating if it
developed this possibility — or if
Frank really had to struggle with

saying something significant in
The Verdict, too, because every
scene is underscored by somber,
impressive theme music (by
Johnny Mandel) and the photog
raphy and art direction (by An
drzej Bartkowiak and Edward
Pisoni, respectively) have a solid,
architectural elegance. It's a real
Oscar contender: the camera
remains discreetly distant from
the action so that we can admire
how carefully sets have been
built and compositions arranged,
and David Mamet's script ser
monizes earnestly about the
need for the poor and weak to
believe in the possibility of jus
tice.
Mamet and Lumet (they
sound like insurance brokers)
have built the movie around Paul
Newman, who plays Frank Gal
vin, a down-and-out lawyer.
Galvin was once accused of jury
tampering, and his career started
to bottom out immediately af
terwards, even though he won
his acquittal: his wife has left
him, he has lost his last four
cases, and now (when he's sober)
he haunts funeral parlors, posing
as a mourner and trying to solicit
clients among the bereaved.
When he is hired to plead a mal
practice case, representing a
woman turned into a vegetable

himself before refusing the fat
sum his opponents offer him. But
Mamet has made him as noble as
a Frank Capra hero — we know
long before we're told officially
that the jury tampering charge
was a frame-up — and that
doesn't give Newman much to
play. Besides, Lumet has di
rected him to make his bid for an
Academy Award, which means
that his big scenes are slowed

down and" seem a little over
rehearsed and dried out. His
summation to the jury must be
the most sententious speech he's
ever had to read; it's so unin
teresting that we stop listening in
the middle.
The filmmakers haven't dis
tributed their care evenly
throughout the picture: the plot
ting is confusing in some places
and implausible in others, and
the romance between Frank and
a mysterious woman named
Laura (Charlotte Rampling),
who picks him up in a bar, makes
so little sense that when Mamet
reveals its narrative purpose, the
springs of the screenplay begin to
creak. He has, however, pro
vided some nice roles for James
Mason (as the defendants' attor
ney), Jack Warden (as Galvin's
partner) and Julie Bovasso (as a
nurse), and the scenes in which
Mason preps his staff and his
witnesses expose the inner work
ings of a large, prestigious law
firm for what may be the first
time in a film. Mason, playing a
lawyer who takes a football
coach's delight in propelling his
team toward victory, has an au
thenticity that Milo O'Shea, sad
dled with the role of an unbeliev
ably partial judge — a holdover
from . . . And Justice for All —
cannot summon up. (It doesn't
help that the costumers have
made him look like the valet in
an eighteenth-century drawing
room comedy.)
Very early in the picture, Gal
vin tells a joke to some cronies in
a bar. It's reasonably funny, and
Newman takes pleasure in relat
ing it, but Lumet films the scene

in long shot, as if to move the
camera in would be an in
dulgence. The Verdict delivers its
audience such a boffo affirma
tion of the hopes of victims and
down-and-outers to recoup their
losses that the crowd I saw it with
applauded at the end, but I didn't
really enjoy it very much. When
a director has become too up
tight to let us laugh at a good
joke, it's time for him to loosen
his tie.

any actor's ever had in a movie
debut, as well as all the major
routines and all the best lines. Of
course, it wasn't much of a risk,
because Eddie Murphy ias built
up an enthusiastic following as a
result of his appearances on
Saturday Night Live, but he gets
so many innings in this movie
that you just know his role (Re

ggie Hammond, a con sprung
from jail to help the police to
catch a murderer) grew on the
set. And no one can complain
about the results. Murphy knows
the trick of staying sharp and re
laxed at the same time, and his
gears are buried so deep inside
him that he can shift them with
no visible clue, always catching
us by surprise. He does a black
sheriff routine (complete with
toothpick and 10-gallon hat)
that leaves Cleavon Little's ef
forts in Blazing Saddles choking
in the dust, as well as an Uncle
Tom and a sweet-talking pimp,
and at key moments he draws a
facial expression somewhere be

tween indignation and contempt,
as if mankind in general had just
pulled an incredibly low-class
scam at his expense.
Murphy and Nick Nolte, who
plays Jack Cates, the cop who
presses Reggie into service, have
a winning rapport, though Nolte,
a fine actor, has been relying too
much lately on the gravel-voiced

bone-weariness he perfected in
North Dallas Forty. In fact, 48
Hours wouldn't be a very in
teresting movie without Eddie
Murphy, although Hill gives it
the benefit of his considerable
skill as an action director and he
brings in two of his favorite
character actors, James Remar
(he was one of The Warriors and
Johnny Starr in The Long Rid
ers) and David Patrick Kelly (he
was the psycho in The Warriors),
to spice up the familiar cops
and-killers plot. Dialogue has
never been a strength in Hill's
movies, but the script of 48
Hours is unusually banal (even
though Hill worked on it with
three other writers). And despite
the crackerjack opening se
quence, in which Remar stages
an escape from a work gang — a
scene so saturated with rural
midday heat from the beginning
and so ominously scored by
James Horner (whose music
sounds a lot like that of Ry
Cooder, Hill's composer on The
Long Riders and Southern Com
fort) that we wait for the explo
sion — the film really marks a
sentimental journey for Hill
back to the days when he wrote
such movies as Sam Peckinpah's
The Getaway. 48 Hours doesn't
have a single idea in it, but it's
sure to be a bigger hit than Hill's
last picture, Southern Comfort,
which was fascinating. Fortu
nately, its popularity is based en
tirely on Eddie Murphy's per
formance, which deserves all the
praise he's received for it. 48
Hours must have been a vacation
for Hill; I hope we can look for
ward to seeing him back at work
in his next movie.

Mamet has made him as noble as
a Frank Capra hero — we know
long before we're told officially
that the jury tampering charge
was a frame-up — and that
doesn't give Newman much to
play. Besides, Lumet has di
rected him to make his bid for an
Academy Award, which means
that his big scenes are slowed

down and" seem a little over
rehearsed and dried out. His
summation to the jury must be
the most sententious speech he's
ever had to read; it's so unin
teresting that we stop listening in
the middle.
The filmmakers haven't dis
tributed their care evenly
throughout the picture: the plot
ting is confusing in some places
and implausible in others, and
the romance between Frank and
a mysterious woman named
Laura (Charlotte Rampling),
who picks him up in a bar, makes
so little sense that when Mamet
reveals its narrative purpose, the
springs of the screenplay begin to
creak. He has, however, pro
vided some nice roles for James
Mason (as the defendants' attor
ney), Jack Warden (as Galvin's
partner) and Julie Bovasso (as a
nurse), and the scenes in which
Mason preps his staff and his
witnesses expose the inner work
ings of a large, prestigious law
firm for what may be the first
time in a film. Mason, playing a
lawyer who takes a football
coach's delight in propelling his
team toward victory, has an au
thenticity that Milo O'Shea, sad
dled with the role of an unbeliev
ably partial judge — a holdover
from . . . And Justice for All —
cannot summon up. (It doesn't
help that the costumers have
made him look like the valet in
an eighteenth-century drawing
room comedy.)
Very early in the picture, Gal
vin tells a joke to some cronies in
a bar. It's reasonably funny, and
Newman takes pleasure in relat
ing it, but Lumet films the scene

in long shot, as if to move the
camera in would be an in
dulgence. The Verdict delivers its
audience such a boffo affirma
tion of the hopes of victims and
down-and-outers to recoup their
losses that the crowd I saw it with
applauded at the end, but I didn't
really enjoy it very much. When
a director has become too up
tight to let us laugh at a good
joke, it's time for him to loosen
his tie.

debut, as well as all the major
routines and all the best lines. Of
course, it wasn't much of a risk,
because Eddie Murphy ias built
up an enthusiastic following as a
result of his appearances on
Saturday Night Live, but he gets
so many innings in this movie
that you just know his role (Re

ggie Hammond, a con sprung
from jail to help the police to
catch a murderer) grew on the
set. And no one can complain
about the results. Murphy knows
the trick of staying sharp and re
laxed at the same time, and his
gears are buried so deep inside
him that he can shift them with
no visible clue, always catching
us by surprise. He does a black
sheriff routine (complete with
toothpick and 10-gallon hat)
that leaves Cleavon Little's ef
forts in Blazing Saddles choking
in the dust, as well as an Uncle

facial expression somewhere be

as if mankind in general had just

scam at his expense.
Murphy and Nick Nolte, who
plays Jack Cates, the cop who
presses Reggie into service, have
a winning rapport, though Nolte,
a fine actor, has been relying too
much lately on the gravel-voiced

bone-weariness he perfected in
North Dallas Forty. In fact, 48
Hours wouldn't be a very in
teresting movie without Eddie
Murphy, although Hill gives it
the benefit of his considerable
skill as an action director and he
brings in two of his favorite
character actors, James Remar
(he was one of The Warriors and
Johnny Starr in The Long Rid
ers) and David Patrick Kelly (he
was the psycho in The Warriors),
to spice up the familiar cops
and-killers plot. Dialogue has
never been a strength in Hill's
movies, but the script of 48
Hours is unusually banal (even
though Hill worked on it with
three other writers). And despite
the crackerjack opening se
quence, in which Remar stages
an escape from a work gang — a
scene so saturated with rural
midday heat from the beginning
and so ominously scored by
James Horner (whose music
sounds a lot like that of Ry
Cooder, Hill's composer on The
Long Riders and Southern Com
fort) that we wait for the explo
sion — the film really marks a
sentimental journey for Hill
back to the days when he wrote
such movies as Sam Peckinpah's
The Getaway. 48 Hours doesn't
have a single idea in it, but it's
sure to be a bigger hit than Hill's
last picture, Southern Comfort,
which was fascinating. Fortu
nately, its popularity is based en
tirely on Eddie Murphy's per
formance, which deserves all the
praise he's received for it. 48
Hours must have been a vacation
for Hill; I hope we can look for

Sidney Lumet's movies have
begun to acquire a joyless, self
important self-consciousness. 1
could barely make it all the way
through his three-hour treatise
on police corruption and guilt,
Prince of the City, because for all
the screaming tirades the large
cast of characters hurled at each
other, I was never sure what
Lumet's point of view was, and
after the first hour I had stopped
being able to tell the supporting
players apart. He must think he's

by the negligence of a doctor
who administered the wrong
anesthetic to her, he sees a
chance to redeem himself and
reverse the course of his profes
sional life, and so he refuses to be
paid off by the eminent law firm
defending the hospital and the
diocese on whose land the hospi
tal sits.
Paul Newman is a terrific actor
who has been getting better in
the last few years, in movies like
Buffalo Bill and the Indians, Slap
Shot, Fort Apache, the Bronx and
Absence of Malice; and on and
off he gives a very good perform
ance in The Verdict: He gets Gal
vin's exhaustion down in the first
scenes: he walks slowly, with dif
ficulty, up stairs, and the effort
tells in his hoarse, breathless
voice. Polishing himself up for a
new client, he squirts Murine in
his eyes and dabs them with his
handkerchief, showing the grim
experience of a man whose
livelihood depends on convinc
ing strangers of his respectabil
ity. But though Mamet works in
suggestions of dark corners in
Galvin's character, he cleans
them out before we've had the
opportunity to consider their
implications. The plaintiff's
brother-in-law, whose plan to
move with his wife to another
city is ruined by Frank's insis
tence on taking the case to court,
accuses him of using his clients
for his own selfish ends, and the
movie might be fascinating if it
developed this possibility — or if
Frank really had to struggle with

saying something significant in

scene is underscored by somber,
impressive theme music (by
Johnny Mandel) and the photog
raphy and art direction (by An
drzej Bartkowiak and Edward
Pisoni, respectively) have a solid,
architectural elegance. It's a real
Oscar contender: the camera
remains discreetly distant from
the action so that we can admire
how carefully sets have been
built and compositions arranged,
and David Mamet's script ser
monizes earnestly about the
need for the poor and weak to
believe in the possibility of jus
tice.
Mamet and Lumet (they
sound like insurance brokers)
have built the movie around Paul
Newman, who plays Frank Gal
vin, a down-and-out lawyer.
Galvin was once accused of jury
tampering, and his career started
to bottom out immediately af
terwards, even though he won
his acquittal: his wife has left
him, he has lost his last four
cases, and now (when he's sober)
he haunts funeral parlors, posing
as a mourner and trying to solicit
clients among the bereaved.
When he is hired to plead a mal
practice case, representing a
woman turned into a vegetable

himself before refusing the fat
sum his opponents offer him. But
Mamet has made him as noble as
a Frank Capra hero — we know
long before we're told officially
that the jury tampering charge
was a frame-up — and that

ggie Hammond, a con sprung
from jail to help the police to
catch a murderer) grew on the
set. And no one can complain
about the results. Murphy knows
the trick of staying sharp and re
laxed at the same time, and his
gears are buried so deep inside
him that he can shift them with
no visible clue, always catching
us by surprise. He does a black
sheriff routine (complete with
toothpick and 10-gallon hat)
that leaves Cleavon Little's ef
forts in Blazing Saddles choking
in the dust, as well as an Uncle
Tom and a sweet-talking pimp,
and at key moments he draws a
facial expression somewhere be

tween indignation and contempt,
as if mankind in general had just
pulled an incredibly low-class
scam at his expense.
Murphy and Nick Nolte, who
plays Jack Cates, the cop who
presses Reggie into service, have
a winning rapport, though Nolte,
a fine actor, has been relying too
much lately on the gravel-voiced

bone-weariness he perfected in
North Dallas Forty. In fact, 48
Hours wouldn't be a very in
teresting movie without Eddie
Murphy, although Hill gives it
the benefit of his considerable
skill as an action director and he
brings in two of his favorite
character actors, James Remar
(he was one of The Warriors and
Johnny Starr in The Long Rid
ers) and David Patrick Kelly (he
was the psycho in The Warriors),
to spice up the familiar cops
and-killers plot. Dialogue has
never been a strength in Hill's
movies, but the script of 48
Hours is unusually banal (even
though Hill worked on it with
three other writers). And despite
the crackerjack opening se
quence, in which Remar stages
an escape from a work gang — a
scene so saturated with rural
midday heat from the beginning
and so ominously scored by
James Horner (whose music
sounds a lot like that of Ry
Cooder, Hill's composer on The
Long Riders and Southern Com
fort) that we wait for the explo
sion — the film really marks a
sentimental journey for Hill
back to the days when he wrote
such movies as Sam Peckinpah's
The Getaway. 48 Hours doesn't
have a single idea in it, but it's
sure to be a bigger hit than Hill's
last picture, Southern Comfort,
which was fascinating. Fortu
nately, its popularity is based en
tirely on Eddie Murphy's per
formance, which deserves all the
praise he's received for it. 48
Hours must have been a vacation
for Hill; I hope we can look for
ward to seeing him back at work
in his next movie.

Paul Newman in The Verdict

Sidney Lumet's movies have
begun to acquire a joyless, self
important self-consciousness. 1
could barely make it all the way
through his three-hour treatise
on police corruption and guilt,
Prince of the City, because for all
the screaming tirades the large
cast of characters hurled at each
other, I was never sure what
Lumet's point of view was, and
after the first hour I had stopped
being able to tell the supporting
players apart. He must think he's

by the negligence of a doctor
who administered the wrong
anesthetic to her, he sees a
chance to redeem himself and
reverse the course of his profes
sional life, and so he refuses to be
paid off by the eminent law firm
defending the hospital and the
diocese on whose land the hospi
tal sits.
Paul Newman is a terrific actor
who has been getting better in
the last few years, in movies like
Buffalo Bill and the Indians, Slap
Shot, Fort Apache, the Bronx and
Absence of Malice; and on and
off he gives a very good perform
ance in The Verdict: He gets Gal
vin's exhaustion down in the first
scenes: he walks slowly, with dif
ficulty, up stairs, and the effort
tells in his hoarse, breathless
voice. Polishing himself up for a
new client, he squirts Murine in
his eyes and dabs them with his
handkerchief, showing the grim
experience of a man whose
livelihood depends on convinc
ing strangers of his respectabil
ity. But though Mamet works in
suggestions of dark corners in
Galvin's character, he cleans
them out before we've had the
opportunity to consider their
implications. The plaintiff's
brother-in-law, whose plan to
move with his wife to another
city is ruined by Frank's insis
tence on taking the case to court,
accuses him of using his clients
for his own selfish ends, and the
movie might be fascinating if it
developed this possibility — or if
Frank really had to struggle with

saying something significant in
The Verdict, too, because every
scene is underscored by somber,
impressive theme music (by
Johnny Mandel) and the photog
raphy and art direction (by An
drzej Bartkowiak and Edward
Pisoni, respectively) have a solid,
architectural elegance. It's a real
Oscar contender: the camera
remains discreetly distant from
the action so that we can admire
how carefully sets have been
built and compositions arranged,
and David Mamet's script ser
monizes earnestly about the
need for the poor and weak to
believe in the possibility of jus
tice.
Mamet and Lumet (they
sound like insurance brokers)
have built the movie around Paul
Newman, who plays Frank Gal
vin, a down-and-out lawyer.
Galvin was once accused of jury
tampering, and his career started
to bottom out immediately af
terwards, even though he won
his acquittal: his wife has left
him, he has lost his last four
cases, and now (when he's sober)
he haunts funeral parlors, posing
as a mourner and trying to solicit
clients among the bereaved.
When he is hired to plead a mal
practice case, representing a
woman turned into a vegetable

himself before refusing the fat
sum his opponents offer him. But
Mamet has made him as noble as
a Frank Capra hero — we know
long before we're told officially
that the jury tampering charge
was a frame-up — and that
doesn't give Newman much to
play. Besides, Lumet has di
rected him to make his bid for an
Academy Award, which means
that his big scenes are slowed

down and" seem a little over
rehearsed and dried out. His
summation to the jury must be
the most sententious speech he's
ever had to read; it's so unin
teresting that we stop listening in
the middle.
The filmmakers haven't dis
tributed their care evenly
throughout the picture: the plot
ting is confusing in some places
and implausible in others, and
the romance between Frank and
a mysterious woman named
Laura (Charlotte Rampling),
who picks him up in a bar, makes
so little sense that when Mamet
reveals its narrative purpose, the
springs of the screenplay begin to
creak. He has, however, pro
vided some nice roles for James
Mason (as the defendants' attor
ney), Jack Warden (as Galvin's
partner) and Julie Bovasso (as a
nurse), and the scenes in which
Mason preps his staff and his
witnesses expose the inner work
ings of a large, prestigious law
firm for what may be the first
time in a film. Mason, playing a
lawyer who takes a football
coach's delight in propelling his
team toward victory, has an au
thenticity that Milo O'Shea, sad
dled with the role of an unbeliev
ably partial judge — a holdover
from . . . And Justice for All —
cannot summon up. (It doesn't
help that the costumers have
made him look like the valet in
an eighteenth-century drawing
room comedy.)
Very early in the picture, Gal
vin tells a joke to some cronies in
a bar. It's reasonably funny, and
Newman takes pleasure in relat
ing it, but Lumet films the scene

in long shot, as if to move the
camera in would be an in
dulgence. The Verdict delivers its
audience such a boffo affirma
tion of the hopes of victims and
down-and-outers to recoup their
losses that the crowd I saw it with
applauded at the end, but I didn't
really enjoy it very much. When
a director has become too up
tight to let us laugh at a good
joke, it's time for him to loosen
his tie.

You can sense Walter Hill's
delight at directing Eddie Mur
phy in 48 Hours: he gives him
one of the funniest introductions
