The local chapter of the interna
tional Alpha Phi sorority was granted
official recognition by the University
yesterday, making it the third sorority
to be recognized here since a 33-year
ban on the groups was lifted in 1977.
The Kappa Deuteron chapter's
two-year effort to gain University rec

requirements.
For two years the chapter's recogni

process of point-by-point negotiation
with the University and the interna
tional. This process came to an end
when the international guaranteed
across-the-board autonomy.
Row Director Diana Conklin, who
represented the University in the
negotiations, called the letter guaran
teeing autonomy "a beautiful blanket
statement." She said it was much
shorter — and more comprehensive —
than such past statements.

one of the more prescriptive, and I was
surprised to see the change in attitude

women here," Conklin said.
Kirsten Sanders, head of the chap
