The local chapter of the interna
tional Alpha Phi sorority was granted
official recognition by the University
yesterday, making it the third sorority
to be recognized here since a 33-year
ban on the groups was lifted in 1977.
The Kappa Deuteron chapter's
two-year effort to gain University rec
ognition ended successfully when the
Alpha Phi international provided a
short statement guaranteeing the chap
ter's autonomy in all matters.
The issue of local autonomy has been
the primary barrier facing sororities in
their struggles to gain University rec
ognition over the past five years. When
the University denied recognition to
seven Stanford chapters of national
sororities late in 1979, the reason given
in each case v/as the possibility of out
side interference in membership selec
tion and group governance.
According to Holly Hoven, presi
dent of the Kappa Deuteron chapter,
the local group has been autonomous
in practice ali along. The international
Alpha Phi charter, however, contained
items unacceptable to the University,
and the local chapter had to obtain as
surance in writing that they would be
allowed autonomy in all areas where
the charter conflicted with University
requirements.
For two years the chapter's recogni
tion committee had been involved in a
process of point-by-point negotiation
with the University and the interna
tional. This process came to an end
when the international guaranteed
across-the-board autonomy.
Row Director Diana Conklin, who
represented the University in the
negotiations, called the letter guaran
teeing autonomy "a beautiful blanket
statement." She said it was much
shorter — and more comprehensive —
than such past statements.
~ "The Alpha Phi national charter is
one of the more prescriptive, and I was
surprised to see the change in attitude
Z. . I'm very happy on the part of the
women here," Conklin said.
Kirsten Sanders, head of the chap
ter's recognition committee, said a
change in presidency at the national
level may have been responsible, in
part, for the chapter's success.
. University recognition means that
the chapter can hold meetings and
other events, including fund-raising
and rush activities, on campus, and will
be able to work through Residential
Education in publicizing its events.
According to Hoven, the ability to
hold meetings on campus is "the most
exciting part" of recognition. The 50-
member chapter has in the past held
meetings at the Palo Alto Holiday Inn
and the University Lutheran Church
on Stanford Avenue. Hoven said meet
ing off campus "detracted from the
feeling of being a campus organiza
tion," and was potentially dangerous at

night.
Sororities were banned here by the
board of trustees in 1944, when it was
feared that extreme competition for
sorority memberships was creating a
dangerous rift between members —
who lived in sorority houses on campus
— and other women who had to live in
University dormitories. According to
Hoven, Alpha Phi was the first of 10
sororities to reform when the ban was
lifted in December 1977 (three later
disbanded). The name Kappa Deute
ron refers to the fact that this is the
second "Kappa" chapter of Alpha Phi
at Stanford, the first having been
forced to disband in 1944.
Alpha Phi is the second sorority to
have gained recognition this school
year. The local chapter of Sigma Delta
Tau was recognized last October.
