# Disconnected Dialtone

### STEPHANIE PEIROLO 
Stanford benefits from a mag
zine like. Dialtone because it
rovides an easily accessible
free) forum for criticism, fic
ion, photography and feature
>riented journalism. The year's
irst issue, which appeared at the
:nd of last quarter, is a mixed
iuccess, for while it contains out
itanding material in each cate
gory, it also includes some less
impressive work which is either
indicative of a lack of talent
available, or editors with low
standards.
Dialtone is strongest in its
critical capacity. The music
reviews in "Dial Tunes" offer
concise information and criti
cism of the works of a variety of
"musical groups, from Marlene
■ Dietrich to The Jam. In the "Bay
•'■Area Magazine Review" 14 Bay
—Area cultural magazines are sur
,,;veyed as to price, frequency of
publication and other statistics
along with entertaining criticism
of their subject matter. There are
ni ;no book reviews but the movie
liTron is discussed. This socio
- -economic review departs from
v-the lean format of the other re
views, lapsing instead into pre
tentious verbosity; many of the
observations are interesting, but
the article is too long.
Part of the aim of the maga
ii zine seems to be a critical exami

nation of Stanford, as well as art.
In the excellent article "The Mad
Frenchman" the mysterious his
tory of the local figure known as
Peter Coutts is discussed in rela
tion to the inability of our
technological society in general.

and Stanford in particular, to ac
cept and benefit from legend.
The result is an entertaining, yet
thought-provoking commentary
which revolves around a specific
event. Another critical examina
tion of Stanford, "Why I Hide
My Face . . suffers from being
too abstract and self-conscious,
but underneath the excess ver
biage are a few insightful chal
lenges.
The issue contains two short
pieces of fiction, "Hitching" by
Nick Burbules, and "Brick
Story" by Newton Ash by.

"Hitching" is an outstanding
work of fiction — while not fault
less, it is remarkable because it
conveys so much so well in such
short space. Unfortunately
"Brick Story" does not achieve
the same result for it is hampered
by a somewhat contrived voice.
Printed as it is, on newsprint.
Dialtone cannot do justice to
photographs because they olten
do not reproduce well, and thus
many appear heavy and dark.
The layout of the magazine is ex
cellent for, other than the pho
tography, it turns the newsprint
to an advantage with an old
movie theme, as well as integrat
ing art, advertisement and print
into a pleasing and readable ar
rangement.
The potential that Dialtone
shows in this issue is great, for
there is sharp and informative
criticism of music and magazines
as well as larger, less tangible is
sues in our society. The overall
effect of the good material is
hampered, however, by the in
clusion of articles like the
"Exotic/Erotic Halloween Ball"
which is, quite frankly, awful.
Plenty of talent and energy can
be found in this publication, and
hopefully, higher editorial stan
dards in the future will allow
these strengths to reach their po
tential.
