The most recent issue of

;;which combines an excellent

Most of the material is cen
tered around Stanford, which
- adds unity to the disparate forms
of humor. There are spurious
admissions applications from
- terrorists and Young Democrats,
Sinot the newest idea, but well
j-jdone. Monopoly is given a boost
by the inclusion of new Chance
Community Chest cards for

the Stanford student such as
"just back from overseas, you
don't know about bike lanes. $50
for hitting 3 people in White
Plaza at noon."
"Almost" takes a wry look at
the problem of missed opportu
nities and almost achievements,
while a longer article reveals the

effects roommates have on each
other. All of these articles are
entertaining, but they are gener
ally short and compose only a
small percentage of the actual
magazine space.
The greatest component of the
issue is advertising. Numerous
full-page ads comprise too many
of the 50 pages, especially since

it is often difficult to distinguish
between ad and magazine mate
rial. Large, often full-page
graphics are also liberally in
terspersed and detract from the
otherwise professional appear
ance of the layout, for the
graphics are crudely executed
and would be more appropriate
as doodles on a notebook than
magazine art. Obviously there
was a serious lack of material for
this issue and the attempt to flesh
out what good there is with poor
graphics and cut-rate articles like
"Midnight Mensch" and
" Rumplestiltskin
along with large amounts bf MitS
filled space, lessens the appear
ance of the magazine as a whole.
Unfortunately the editors of
Chaparral seem to have mas
tered the very "Art of Filler"
they deride in "How to Book."
The Chaparral avoids, for the
most part, two of the pitfalls
common to humor magazines:
wordiness and tastelessness. The
articles are short enough so they
do not ruin a concept by overdo
ing it, and the subjects are rela
tively clean, placing the empha
sis on satire rather than smut.
The quality of the writing is good
overall, but the large quantities
of filler and advertising make
this issue just "get by."
