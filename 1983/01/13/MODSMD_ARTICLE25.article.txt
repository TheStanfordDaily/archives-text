# Spin Gang of Four again
## 
### TERRI SUTTON 
Every year, thousands of records are
released, and every year, a few marvelous
albums become lost in the crowd. My
candidate for 1982's most undeservedly
unsuccessful lp is Gang of Four's Songs of
the Free, released in late spring.
While the single from the album, "I
Love a Man in a Uniform," proved to be a
dance club and progressive radio hit, the
rest of the lp has disappeared into the
backlogs of unheard music.
Instead, artists like John Cougar and
Saga (who?) rack up the platinum sales.
Such is life, I suppose.
But Songs of the Free deserves a second
listen, for the lp displays Gang of Four's
recovery of the creative energy that
fueled their classic first album, Enter
tainment!.
"Man in a Uniform" signalled the re
juvenated GOF when it came out last
summer. The single was an infectious
blend of electronic percussion, funky
bass, and a vocal resembling none other
than Marc Almond of Soft Cell. Jon King
— long the deadpan conversationalist/
Screamer of GOFs songs — had some
how learned to sing, melodiously.
Of course, such a move toward musical
ity, coupled with the (relative) success of
the single, constitutes sure sell-out status
to some. That's their problem. For my
part, the album manages a terrific balance
between the harmonious lines of "Un
iform" and the jarring guitar and percus
sion of the first album. GOF has already
attempted to rewrite Entertainment! once
(on Solid Gold), an endeavor notable
mostly for undistinguishable melodies.
Songs of the Free, on the other hand,
comes full of lovely hooks which rise
above the rhythmic one-two of Hugo
Burnham's percussion and Sara Lee's
bass. Part of the credit for the lp's sound
must go to the backing vocals, for Lee, a
new addition to the group, and singer Joy
Yates contribute a much-needed female
voice: delicately topping King's occasion
ally abrasive tones on "I Will Be a Good
Boy"; adding a punchy soul to " Man in a
Uniform."
However, Andy Gill's guitar work, ex

cellent as always, provides the melodic
hook on a number of cuts, especially "The
History of the World." While King
chants, Gill's guitar soars eerily from
sphie-tingling harmony to crashing distor
tion.
Gill continues to push at the limits of his
guitar's capabilities — just as King has
begun to play with the qualities of his
voice. Neither has lost, thankfully, the
ability to be ugly, atonal or clashing. For
all the fine singing King has produced
here — and "Of the Instant" resonates
with the emotive power of King's softly
dying voice — he can still rant with the
best of them.
" It is Not Enough" relates the thoughts
of a housewife chafing at the repetition of
her life. After speaking for the woman in a
voice high with near hysteria. King
screeches into the chorus: "It is not
enough /It is just a habit." Accompanied
by Gill's searing guitar, it is not pretty
either.
The next song, "Life! It's a Shame,"
allows Gill a chance to crank into some
vintage " Anthrax"-esque feedback — al
though with the new GOF sound, he does
it above a chorus which, oddly enough,
resembles Elvis Costello's "Tears Before
Bedtime."
GOFs new balance between melody
and rhythm is paralleled in their lyrics as
well. GOF have never been shy in stating
their politics — note their name, for in
stance — and they continue to deal with
subjects ABC wouldn't touch with a straw
bowler. As King states in "Muscles for
Brains)): "For reasons that are not mys
terious /The weak are sent to the wall
/They have reservations in heaven /Down
here they're not so fashionable."
However, in the four years since their
first album, GOF have learned a bit more
compassion for the participants in the so
ciety they abhor. The majority of Songs of
the Free are sung from the perspective of
the sacred or confused victim — unlike
the stricter polemics of Entertainment!,
where at times the finger-pointing be
came a bit self-righteous.
The new album blends irony, suffering,
the voice of determined unconsciousness.
"Of the Instant," for example, communi
cates the incredible sadness of realizing
that even the most private embrace con

tains relations of power. As the singer
relates: "There was something I can't re
member/Did you say' I've had enough' ?"
Contrast the plaintive closing lines of
this song: " Who owns what you do? / Who
owns what you use?," to the coldblooded
treatment of the same subject on Enter
tainment! 's "Contract": "Is this so pri
vate /Our struggle in the bedroom."

Gill and King have also developed their
knack for striking (and amusing) imagery,
juxtaposing sentences much as they set up
opposing musical instruments. Again and
again, they top off a situation with a line
bringing the usually political subject right
down into your lap. As King snaps in
"The History of the World": "After birth
I cursed my luck /Then went down to
breakfast."
The tensions which made the first
album great still build on this album —
between irony and sincerity; between in
struments; between contrasting rhythms;
between consciousness and blind accep
tance.
However, GOF have grown subtle,
throwing in some beautiful melodies,
some achingly insightful lyrics, some emo
tional range amongst the scathing criti
cisms of of Western culture. They've
learned how to feel something beyond
anger, I think, which deepens their music
considerably, and makes this album a
winner.
This is the sort of album that should
have gone platinum in 1982.
