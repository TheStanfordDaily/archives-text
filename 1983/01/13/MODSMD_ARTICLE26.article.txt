More paperwork
Just when you thought you were checking off
that last piece of paper, ed-elect Karen has
dreamed up something else for you to sign. Ap
plications for staff positions are on the Daily office
door. Meetings to discuss next volume — staff
positions, suggestions, ideas — will be scheduled
next Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday. The staff
for next volume will be announced a week from to
day.
Happy hour
You worked for it. You deserve it. You have it.
Happy hour tomorrow at 4:30. Good times, good
people, good food (well, almost) and definitely
good refreshments.
