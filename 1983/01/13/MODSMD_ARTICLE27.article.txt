# DNA patent
## Government closes file 
### TIM GRIEVE 
The U.S. Patent Office has complied
with a University request and closed to
public scrutiny its file on the Universi
ty's patent application for recombinant
DNA.
Normally, patent application files
are closed to the public until patents
are approved, but in an unprecedented
move the University originally asked
the Patent Office to leave the DNA
patent file open. On Dec. 6, however,
the University asked that the file be
closed.
By originally keeping the file open,
the University hoped to "emerge at the
end with a stronger patent," said
Robert Rosenzweig, vice president for
public affairs.
Niels Reimers, director of the Uni
versity's Office of Technology Licens
ing, explained that patents with wide
spread importance often are contested
in courts by companies wishing to avoid
paying royalties.
It is sometimes cheaper for a com
pany to challenge the validity of a pat
ent than to pay royalties to the patent
holder, Reimers said. By opening the
file and allowing anyone interested to
input information pertaining to recom
binant DNA before the patent is
granted, the University hoped to
weaken the case of anyone who might
later contest the patent's validity.
Reimers claimed that any firm which
later tried to contest the patent would
have "an interesting time" doing so,
because the firm would already have
had a chance to offer information on
the patent earlier, before the patent
was granted.

By Dec. 6, however, the University
had decided that the open-file experi
ment had failed.
The initial decision to keep the file
open was "an experiment with some
risks attached," Rosenzweig said. "We
were prepared to take the risk because
of the widespread interest in the sub
ject of the application and because we
believed we would emerge at the end
with a stronger patent.
"The latter may still be true, but in
our judgment, the experiment has
failed. It is better to recognize that fact
before more damage is done."
Although Reimers said he believes
the more important reason for opening
the file was to obtain a stronger pat
ent, he said that some damage has been
done to the invention's reputation be
cause of unfavorable reaction from the
press.
Nature magazine, according to
Reimers, made a number of erroneous
statements concerning the Patent Of
fice's earlier rejection of the DNA ap
plication.
Stanford's application is currently
still under review by the Patent Office.
It is not known when the Patent Office
will respond. Reimers said the Univer
sity is continuing to "proceed with
some confidence" in its effort to obtain
the patent.
If eventually granted, the patent will
protect techniques developed by Stan
ford Genetics Prof. Stanley Cohen and
UC-San Francisco biochemist Herbert
Hoyer. The Patent Office awarded the
pair a patent in 1980 for earlier work in
gene cloning which has since brought
$1.4 million to Stanford and UCSF.
