Reagan orders arms control shake-up
Washington — President Reagan ousted Eugene Rostow, director of the
U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, in a major shakeup of his
arms control negotiating team yesterday.
Rostow, 69, a lifelong Democrat who served in the administration of Pres
ident Lyndon Johnson but split with former President Jimmy Carter on de
fense issues, had been under fire from conservative senators and Reagan's
top foreign policy advisers,
Reagan replaced Rostow with Kenneth Adelman, 36, deputy to U.N. Am
bassador Jeane Kirkpatrick. Adelman was described by one administration
official, who asked not to be identified, as "a young, brash conservative."
The president also ousted Richard Staar, the controversial head U.S. ne
gotiator in 10-year-old conventional forces reduction talks in Vienna. Ad
ministration officials had complained privately that Staar was making un
authorized statements and behaving erratically. They said he was overly con
cerned about security and had asked for permission to issue sidearms and
bulletproof vests to his negotiators.
Reagan replaced Staar with Morton Abramowitz, a former ambassador
to Thailand.
Reagan also named David Emery, 34, a former Republican congressman
from Maine, as the deputy to Adelman. He will fill the No. 2 job in the Arms
Control and Disarmament Agency, succeeding Robert Grey, who was
forced out last month.
