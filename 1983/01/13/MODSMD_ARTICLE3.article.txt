Reagan orders arms control shake-up
Washington — President Reagan ousted Eugene Rostow, director of the
U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, in a major shakeup of his
arms control negotiating team yesterday.
Rostow, 69, a lifelong Democrat who served in the administration of Pres
ident Lyndon Johnson but split with former President Jimmy Carter on de
fense issues, had been under fire from conservative senators and Reagan's
top foreign policy advisers,
Reagan replaced Rostow with Kenneth Adelman, 36, deputy to U.N. Am
bassador Jeane Kirkpatrick. Adelman was described by one administration
official, who asked not to be identified, as "a young, brash conservative."
The president also ousted Richard Staar, the controversial head U.S. ne
gotiator in 10-year-old conventional forces reduction talks in Vienna. Ad
ministration officials had complained privately that Staar was making un
authorized statements and behaving erratically. They said he was overly con
cerned about security and had asked for permission to issue sidearms and
bulletproof vests to his negotiators.
Reagan replaced Staar with Morton Abramowitz, a former ambassador
to Thailand.
Reagan also named David Emery, 34, a former Republican congressman
from Maine, as the deputy to Adelman. He will fill the No. 2 job in the Arms
Control and Disarmament Agency, succeeding Robert Grey, who was
forced out last month.
The White House made a point of noting that
Reagan was retaining his main negotiators in nu
clear arms reduction talks with the Soviet Union at
Cieneva. Thev are Edward Rowny, who heads the
Strategic Arms Reduction Talks — dubbed
START — and Paul Nitze, chief negotiator at the
Intermediate Nuclear Force talks.
Reagan to overhaul tax system
Washington — In a search for new revenues to
trim the budget deficit, President Reagan is con
sidering asking Congress for major changes in the
tax system, including possible elimination of popu
lar deductions and perhaps a 10 percent surcharge
on tax bills, administration officials said yesterday.
The president definitely will call for a major ov
erhaul and simplification of the tax system in his
State of the Union address to Congress on Jan. 25,
one well-placed official told the Los Angeles Times
. In this connection. White House spokesman
Larrv Speakes said the president considers the so
called "flat rate" income tax "an attractive idea."
In its purest form, the flat rate proposal would set a
single, low tax rate for all income, and wipe out all
deductions sprinkled through the hundreds of
pages in the current tax code. However, Congress
would be very reluctant to reduce or eliminate such
popular items as the deductions for interest
payments on home mortgages and other loans, and
for contributions to charity.
If the administration pushed the idea, political
realities probably would make it necessary to re
tain some of the most popular deductions. A flat
rate tax would lower the income tax rates, now at a
maximum of 50 percent, but the government
would still collect more total revenues because of
the elimination or narrrowing of deductions. An
other major proposal for raising revenues calls for
a 10 percent additional income tax to be levied au
tomatically in 1986 and beyond if budget deficits
grow too large. Secretary of the Treasury Donald
Regan said yesterday. Under this surtax plan, a
taxpayer would calculate his or her tax and then
add an additional 10 percent.
Heckler appointed to HHS post
Washington — President Reagan yesterday
nominated former Rep. Margaret Heckler of Mas
sachusetts, a moderate Republican who lost her
bid for re-election last fall, to replace Richard
Schweiker as secretary of Health and Human Ser
vices.
If her nomination is approved by the Senate,
Heckler will be Reagan's third female Cabinet
level appointee. She will assume command of a
Cabinet department that has the third largest
budget in the world — $276 billion — after the
United States and the Soviet Union.
As head of the department responsible for Social
Security, Medicare, Medicaid, welfare and other
costly federal programs, she will move to the center
stage of controversy in Reagan's efforts to reduce
domestic spending.
Reagan announced Heckler's nomination in the
East Room of the White House after accepting
Schweiker's letter of resignation. The president
praised Heckler's ability, pointing to her eight
terms in the House.
"Congresswoman Heckler brings to the job ex
tensive experience in the workings of government
. . ~ " he said. "She has proven herself a practical
and compassionate public servant, and I am confi
dent that she will prove an invaluable member of
our team."
Heckler, 51, battled with Reagan's supporters at
the 1980 Republican National Convention in her
efforts to have the party platform include support
of the Equal Rights Amendment. A Roman Catho
lic with three children, she is opposed to abortion,
as is Reagan, but unlike Reagan she does not favor
a constitutional amendment to outlaw it.
As the president introduced her as his nominee
for HHS secretary, however, she pledged loyalty to
him.
"Indeed, it is with a sense of faith in your vision
and your goals for America, faith in President Rea
gan, that 1 accept what 1 think is the hardest assign
ment in Washington," she said.
Heckler becomes the second woman named to
the Reagan Cabinet in a week. The president on
Jan. 5 chose Elizabeth Dole, the former head of the
White House's public liaison office, "to succeed
Drew Lewis as head of the Department of Trans

portation. Jeane Kirkpatrick, ambassador to the
United Nations, also has Cabinet-level status.
Army mutiny leader resigns
San Salvador, El Salvador — Salvadoran Presi
dent Alvaro Magana announced yesterday that Lt.
Col. Sigifredo Ochoa, who led *a six-day non-vi
olent army mutiny in Cabanas Province, has relin
quished his command of its 1200-man garrison.
Magana's announcement followed what he de
scribed as a secret meeting yesterday morning just
after dawn between Ochoa and a special com
mission of officers acting as intermediaries some
where in the rugged mountains north of Cabanas'
provincial capital of Sensuntepeque.
"The whole problem (of the army mutiny) is
solved," Magana said, but the solution, as he de
scribed it in a news conference, leaves unaddressed
many of the questions raised by Ochoa's actions
and their likely consequences for the fractured
army Washington supports here.
For the moment, Defense Minister Gen. Jose
Ciuillermo Garcia, whose resignation Ochoa had
demanded, remains in place. But his prestige suf
fered badly during the mutiny and Magana was
equivocal about how long Garcia will remain in of
fice.
Earlier in the week Ochoa's subordinates had
suggested that a face-saving deal could be struck in
which Garcia would retain his post long enough to
avoid the appearance of capitulation.
Regan: more revenue needed
Washington — Treasury Secretary Donald Re
gan said yesterday that the government's tax take
will have to rise to 21 or 22 percent of the gross na
tional product (GNP) by the middle of the decade
to shrink projected budget deficits and come closer
to paying for federal programs.
Regan's statement amounted to a- concession
that President Reagan's original goal of reducing
the level of federal taxes and spending as a propor
tion of the total economy would not be met.
In 1980, the federal budget was equivalent to
22.5 percent of GNP and taxes to just over 20 per
cent.
Reagan's 1983 budget a year ago projected
spending at 20.9 percent and taxes at 19.1 percent
of GN P bv 1985. But spending totaled 24.6 percent
of GNP in fiscal 1982.
The administration's failure to bring federal
spending down in line with taxes has led to yawn
ing budget deficits that cannot be narrowed by
further spending cuts alone, according to officials
scrambling to finish work on the fiscal 1984
budget, due to be completed this week.
Regan said he hoped that a growing economy
would provide much of the additional revenues.
But the administration's present economic forecast
does not provide for enough growth to bring reven
ues up to 21 or 22 percent of GNP by 1986, other
sources said.
Poland expels UPI reporter
Warsaw — The Polish authorities ordered Unit
ed Press International bureau chief Ruth Gruber
expelled yesterday from the country for allegedly
collecting espionage materials.
The order was announced less than three hours
after Miss Gruber was released from 23 hours of
police detention. Nonetheless, she said the ex
pulsion order came as a surprise, since her inter
rogators had stressed to her that she was being held
only as a witness, and there had been no criminal
accusation against her.
"They had not given me any indication —
none," she said.
Gruber called the charges against her "totally
trumped up" and "part of the continuing harrass
ment of the Western press."
An official communique read on state television
last night said that police had intercepted a film
packet addressed to Gruber allegedly containing
photographs of military installations.
The communique added that the authorities de
cided not to prosecute her for espionage because
"she had no criminal intentions."
Nonetheless, it said, "collecting material of an
espionage character is an obvious infringement of
the rights of a press agency correspondent ac
credited in Warsaw." The government had ordered
her stripped of her accreditation and expelled, it
added.

Gruber said late yesterday that she had still re
ceived no official notice of her expulsion, but that
she had been told to appear at the Foreign Ministry
today.
An U.S. Embassy spokesman said that U.S.
Deputy Chief of Mission Herbert Wilgis was told
by the head of the Foreign Ministry's North Amer
ican department late yesterday that she would have
48 hours to leave Poland.
Weinberger loses budget fight
Washington — President Reagan's decision to
wipe out the Pentagon's projected 7.6 percent pay
raise in October for the 2.1 million men and women
in uniform represents the biggest setback Defense
Secretary Caspar Weinberger has suffered since
taking office two years ago, Pentagon officials said
yesterday.
They said Weinberger has feared that denying
the raises could discourage high quality young peo
ple from joining the all-volunteer Army, Navy, Air
Force and Marine Corps, and prompt those al
ready in service who possess the most critical and
saleable skills to leave for private industry.
"Cap was really down about it when he came
back from that meeting," said one defense ex
ecutive after the Monday White House review
when Reagan decided to go along with his Office of
Management and Budget recommendation and
give no pay raise to either military or civilian em
ployees of the government for fiscal 1984.
"He fought for keeping in at least a 4 percent
raise," said a knowledgeable administration of
ficial in describing Weinberger's last stand on the
pay issue. Congress had approved a 4 percent raise
for this year and recommended similar pay in
creases for fiscal 1984 and 1985.
Weinberger has been telling Army, Navy, Air
Force and Marine personnel all over the world the
past two years that their pay during previous ad
ministrations was "disgraceful." He indicated that
helping them keep pace with inflation was one of
his solemn obligations as defense secretary.
Weinberger also told congressional committees
that they either had to keep up military salaries or
see the national experiment known as the All-Vol
unteer Force go to ruin.
Profit-taking slows Dow Jones
Stock prices finished mostly higher yesterday,
but the market ran into strong resistance from
profit-takers after the Dow Jones industrial aver
age had a brief fling at the 1100 level.
Trading was heavy.
Dow Jones' average of 30 blue chips, which
crossed 1100 for the first time at about 2:30 p.m.,
was down .18 at 1083.61 by the close. The broad
tally on the New York Stock Exchange showed
nearly two issues rising in price for every one that
declined.
Analysts said some traders had decided in ad
vance to take profits when the Dow reached 1100
for the first time.
Today's weather
Sunny, with light winds. Highs in the 60s.
