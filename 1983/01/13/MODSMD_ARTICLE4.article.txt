# Rules delay energy plant

### MARIE-JEANNE JUILLAND 
The University Board of Trustees in
last December's meeting approved the
concept of building a cogeneration
plant to provide electricity and steam
for the University, but a conflict be
tween federal and state regulations
may delay the final decision to build the
plant beyond the expected May or June
date.
According to Jack Barkle, consulting
director of facilities project manage
ment, the Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) has not yet approved
California's environmental standards
for cogeneration plant carbon
monoxide emissions..
The EPA and the Bay Area Air
Quality Management District have ap
proved the concept of a cogeneration
plant, Barkle said. But until the federal
agency approves California's standards
for carbon monoxide emissions, con
struction of new cogeneration plants is
prohibited.
The University currently has two en
ergy systems — one for steam and one
for electricity. University-produced

electricity is generated by natural gas,
with high temperature exhaust gases
usually wasted. Cogeneration plants
incorporate these two systems, using
this exhaust to create steam for heat
ing. Cogeneration is thus considered
more efficient.
The plant could reduce the current
$12.6 million electricity and natural
gas plant costs to $4.8 million, saving
nearly $8 million annually, Barkle said.
Mark Harris, assistant director of
utilities for the City of Palo Alto, said
cogeneration — or gas turbine —
plants, are the most environmentally
acceptable of plants using fossil fuels.
"Project Cogen (construction of the
cogeneration plant) will result in an
overall area reduction in emissions of
some of the regulated pollutants and
only small increases in others," accord
ing to the report submitted to the board
of trustees in December.
The proposed plant would be locatcd
next to the existing Central Energy
Facility near Jordan Way and Campus
Drive.
In addition to meeting the Universi
ty's steam requirements with a maxi
mum gain in efficiency, the cogenera
tion plant would realize revenues
through the sale of electricity. "We've
made enough studies to be certain the
return on the project is sufficient to pay
for itself in five years." Barkle said.
"We're not making money, just re
ducing the cost of providing electricity
and steam.'" he added, forecasting a
reduction of 25 to 40 percent in total
University energy costs.
Long-term economic benefits de
pend on trends in natural gas costs and
sale prices for surplus energy. The Uni
versity is negotiating surplus energy
sales with Pacific Gas and Electric and
the City of Palo Alto.
According to Harris, both the Uni
versity and the City of Palo Alto would
benefit from a local cogeneration plant.
In addition to economic benefits, the
University would gain an independent

source of electricity which would not be
subject to curtailed service because of
supply or capacity shortages. As a
cogenerator. the University would
move one step higher in priority to re
ceive natural gas supplies. The plant
would be designed to use oil in the
event natural gas were not available.
The plant would require little main
tenance. according to Barkle. "It's a
large version of a jet engine, a mechan
ical device that's simple to operate and
maintain," he said.
Howard Ward, a member of the
Cogen financial committee, said the
Office of Management and Financial
Planning should announce the comple
tion of the Cogen financial and en
gineering model this Friday. The model
represents economic and engineering
factors, such as plant size, inflation and
potential financial packages, and their
effect on the operating budget and the
University.
The Cogen committee is considering
straight-bond, leverage-lease and
third-party owner-operator financing.
