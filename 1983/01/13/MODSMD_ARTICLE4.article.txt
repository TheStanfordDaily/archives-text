# Rules delay energy plant

### MARIE-JEANNE JUILLAND 
The University Board of Trustees in
last December's meeting approved the
concept of building a cogeneration
plant to provide electricity and steam
for the University, but a conflict be
tween federal and state regulations
may delay the final decision to build the
plant beyond the expected May or June
date.
According to Jack Barkle, consulting
director of facilities project manage
ment, the Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) has not yet approved
California's environmental standards
for cogeneration plant carbon
monoxide emissions..
The EPA and the Bay Area Air
Quality Management District have ap
proved the concept of a cogeneration
plant, Barkle said. But until the federal
agency approves California's standards
for carbon monoxide emissions, con
struction of new cogeneration plants is
prohibited.
The University currently has two en
ergy systems — one for steam and one
for electricity. University-produced

electricity is generated by natural gas,
with high temperature exhaust gases
usually wasted. Cogeneration plants
incorporate these two systems, using
this exhaust to create steam for heat
ing. Cogeneration is thus considered
more efficient.
The plant could reduce the current
$12.6 million electricity and natural
gas plant costs to $4.8 million, saving
nearly $8 million annually, Barkle said.
Mark Harris, assistant director of
utilities for the City of Palo Alto, said
cogeneration — or gas turbine —
plants, are the most environmentally
acceptable of plants using fossil fuels.
"Project Cogen (construction of the
cogeneration plant) will result in an
overall area reduction in emissions of
some of the regulated pollutants and
only small increases in others," accord
ing to the report submitted to the board
of trustees in December.
The proposed plant would be locatcd
next to the existing Central Energy
Facility near Jordan Way and Campus
Drive.
