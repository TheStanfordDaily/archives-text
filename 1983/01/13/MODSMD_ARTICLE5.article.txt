# Studio problems force Quad photo rescheduling
## 
### BOB COHN Staff writer 
More than 80 seniors have been
notified that they must have their year
book portrait retaken as a result of
equipment problems, according to
Quad co-Editors-in-Chief Jack Chen
and Tony Chung.
Chung explained that Delma
Studios, the firm hired by The Quad to
shoot senior portraits and residence
photos, "had problems with the back
ground flash, and, as a result, the back
ground was not lit for some of the pic
tures."
Chen said, "Everyone who had their
picture taken will get it in the book. All
but seven have rescheduled, and
they've either graduated or they're
overseas this quarter."
For those seven, Delma will hand
spraypaint the backdrops of the origi
nal photos so that they match the blue
backgrounds of the other pictures,
Chen explained. The studio wanted to
shoot retakes not only for consistency,
but because the new proofs would be
more attractive, increasing the likeli
hood that students would purchase one
of the photo packages that Delma of

fers.
"They (Delma Studios) have a pack
age deal," Chung said. "They pay us $6
per senior, and they get the chance to
sell seniors their picture packages."
Althouth the studio mix-up should
not delay the yearbook itself, "it's defi
nitely causing a lot of headaches," said
Chen. Retake appointments were
available only through yesterday be
cause the deadline for the senior sec
tion falls at the end of this month.
This is not the first time that Delma
foul-ups have inconvenienced students
and the Quad. Some students complain
that they received notices from the
company saying they must return their
choice of proofs or face a late fee, even
though they have never received pro
ofs.
"We got their (those students)
names and numbers and we're trying to
track down what happened. There's no
reason they should have to pay that
$10," Chen said.
"It's a hassle because they're not
going to be able to choose their poses
for the yearbook," Chen commented.
He added, however, that because of
this extra week of shooting, more than

1200 seniors will have their picture in
the yearbook, more than in previous
years.
"Now I'm gonna look scruffy,"
Senior Doug Nomiyama said, stroking
the chin whiskers he forgot to shave. "I
know I looked great the first time."
Nomiyama, like the 83 other seniors
whose pictures were ruined, received a
note from Delma explaining that "cir
cumstances beyond (Delma's) control"
made it necessary for him to sit for his
yearbook photographs again.
Although Delma Studios could not
be reached for comment, Chen insists
they have been very cooperative.
"There's just been a number of little
mistakes," he said.
Asked if The Quad will use the
studio next year, Chen quipped, "We'll
think about it. It's a matter of whether
we think they're capable of doing a
good job next year."
"If you're a true professional this
type of thing doesn't happen to you,"
Chung added.
The Quad changed to Delma this
year because, according to Chen, "We
had problems with last year's com
pany."

SAY CHEESE: Seniors who earlier this year had their portraits taken for
the Quad may now have to reschedule appointments because of a foul-up
with the contracted photography company.
