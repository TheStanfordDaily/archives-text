# Negotiations with Neiman-Marcus
## Parking lot construction planned for March 
### LESLIE WEEDEN 
Construction of a otie-story parking deck in the
Stanford Shopping Center will begin in March if the
fashion store Neiman-Marcus signs a fully executed
lease with the University, as is expected.
The 402-car deck would be located above the
present parking lot at the intersection of Arboretum
and Quarry roads.
The deck would be necessary if the Neiman-
Marcus store is built because the store would put an
extra demand on parking near the store and because
construction would displace more than 100 parking
spaces.
The board of trustees approved $3 million for the
construction of the deck in December and its design
has been approved by the Architectural Planning
Review Board of Palo Alto.
The deck is only one part of a plan to add about
700 new spaces to the shopping center's parking
area, according to Andy Doty, director of commu
nity relations. Currently, the amount of parking
space is "manageable," but below a level set by an
agreement between the University and the major

stores in the center, he said.
Other parts of the plan include restriping the
parking lanes, creating more spaces by putting lanes
closer together and designating areas for compact
cars only. Restriping is currently underway.
A second source would come from the planned
extension of Willow Road to El Camino, which
would free space in the parking lot now used as a
surrogate road for through traffic. The board of
trustees last year approved the concept of extending
Willow Road from its present terminus at Ar
boretum at an estimated cost of $ 1.8 to $2.2 million.
A report to the trustees predicted that the use of the
parking lot and internal traffic lanes as a surrogate
road would become "untenable" with the addition
of the Neiman-Marcus store to the shopping center.
That report also considered the additional traffic
which may be caused by potential developments of
the Hospital and Stanford West.
The parking deck, the third source, would not be
necessary if the Neiman-Marcus store is not built,
according to Doty. But a fully executed lease will be
signed by March if not before, according to Rosem
ary McAndrews, manager of campus properties.

Negotiations between the University and
Neiman-Marcus regarding the construction of a
store in the shopping center began in 1976 when the
renovation plan for the shopping center was first
developed. Construction of the store. Phase IV of
the plan, was slated to begin in 1981, but has been
delayed by stalled negotiations.
According to Doty, both sides are at this point
basically in agreement ovÂ«r the conditions of the
lease, but are just trying to work out the timing of
construction. For example, Neiman-Marcus does
not want the store to be half-completed during the
Christmas rush.
Doty said a delay in negotiations over construc
tion of the new Neiman-Marcus store on Union
Square in San Francisco is what slowed the whole
process down. Neiman-Marcus postponed negotia
tions with Stanford until that store opened last
November.
According to the original plan the Neiman-
Marcus store will be a three-story building with a
total of 100,000 square feet. It will be located at the
western end of the mall complex that houses Macy's
and the Emporium.
