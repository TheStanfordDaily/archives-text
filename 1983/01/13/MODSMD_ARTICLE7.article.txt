## Soviet spy satellite continues tumble through space U.S. keeps watch; Soviets say all's well

Compiled from news reports and wire ser

Threatening to leave a trail of
radioactive debris, the Soviet spy
satellite Cosmos 1402 which
wandered off course last week
and began a plunge to earth has
the world anxiously watching
and the Soviets working over
time to assure onlookers every
thing is under control.
Soviet officials deny that the
nuclear-powered reconnais
sance satellite is out of control
and in danger of crashing to
earth and maintain that the satel
lite carrying a nuclear reactor
containing more than 100
pounds of enriched uranium, will
burn up before reaching earth.
In the meantime, from its un
derground center near Colorado
Springs, Colo., the North
American Aerospace Defense
Command is keeping a watchful
eye on the run-away satellite's
descent. And as a precaution
mobilized special teams includ
ing the Nuclear Emergency
Alert Team were placed on alert
to gather the "hot" material in
case the debris falls in the United
States.
State Department officials in
dicated the United States offered
to assist other nations that might
be hit by the radioactive parti
cles.
Initially, Soviet officials
brushed off Western concern
about the satellite and denied the
Cosmos was ailing. A Soviet sci
entist last Thursday said that
Cosmos 1402 was not out of con
trol and was following a "pre
planned operation." But as evi
dence accumulated from track
ing stations that Cosmos 1402
was falling, Moscow admitted
the satellite was in trouble.
The Kremlin continues to in
sist the satellite poses no danger
while Soviet ground controllers
radio a flood of signals to the
errant craft, which is tumbling
through space at an altitude of
about 150 miles, in an effort to
control it. Unless they succeed,
Pentagon sources said, Cosmos
1402 will make a fiery, meteor
like re-entry into the atmosphere
at the end of this month.
With almost 5000 manmade
objects orbiting the earth, a

satellite falling back to earth is an
everyday occurrence. In nearly
all cases, the material disinte
grates and burns up in the earth's
atmosphere. Larger vehicles that
might survive reentry are con
trolled so that their debris comes
down in the Pacific Ocean far
from land. Fragments of the
American Skylab fell in the In
dian Ocean and western Au
stralia, but no radioactive waste
was released.
American officials have issued
assurances that the reactor
should not explode in reentry,
but can not guarantee against a
uranium leak in the reactor used
to generate electricity to operate
the satellite's radar for observing
the movements of the world's
navies.
The nuclear-powered satellite
is not the first to threaten to

spray parts of the world with
radioactive particles. Soviet
satellite Cosmos 954 plunged to
earth in 1978 and though the nu
clear fuel burned up in the upper
atmosphere, several fragments,
some of which were radioactive,
landed near Great Slave Lake in
Canada's Northwest Territories.
Glowing metal and nuclear rub
bish fell over 15,000 square
miles of the sparsely populated
tundra. The accident left the
Canadian government with a $6
million cleanup operation, half
of which was payed by the Soviet
Union.
The incident sparked a
worldwide call for a ban on
nuclear-powered spacecraft.
While Moscow insists that the
reactors do not violate any tre
aty, the United States has not
pressed the issue. For one, the
Defense Department is itself
considering using reactors to
power laser and particle-beam
weapons that may eventually be
deployed in space. Also, NASA
has already sent nuclear power
packs to the moon and uses them
regularly on robot spacecraft to

the outer planets like the Voy
ager missions to Jupiter, Saturn
and beyond.
But to American space scien
tists, the real problem is not that
the Soviets are sending reactors
into space. As Jerry Grey,
spokesman for the American In
stitute of Aeronautics and As
tronautics, points out, it is that
they are doing it "so damned
stupidly" â€” operating the
nuclear-powered satellites at
such low altitudes that they eas
ily become vulnerable to prema
ture return. In order to do
close-up snooping, the Soviets
let their satellites descend to as
low as 100 miles, then boost
them up with onboard rockets to
prevent any further orbital "de
cay."
If an object is launched high
enough to avoid the upper at
mosphere's braking effects, it
can orbit indefinitely, like the
moon.
After that embarrassment, the
Soviet Union waited until 1980
before launching similar satel-

lites.
But in the last two years, Mos
cow has made up for lost time h\
launching seven new spy satel
lites. Shaped like a cocktail
shaker with antennas, the 10,000
pound cylindrical Cosmos 1402
and its nuclear reactor, which
generates intense heat, was de
signed for a short life.
According to U.S. sources,
when the fuel was spent. Soviet
ground control split the satellite
into three pieces. Two of those
pieces were supposed to disinte
grate on reentry into the earth's
atmosphere, hut the third piece,
the reactor, should have been
fired safely into a 560-mile-high
orbit. However, as happened in
1978, the controllers were ap
parently unable to separate the
satellite so that it could be
boosted into orbit. After the
maneuver failed, U.S. trackers
sounded the alert that a Soviet
satellite was behaving erratically
and experiencing a rapid loss of
altitude.
