# Satellite unlikely to hit populated areas

For the second time in the last five years, a Soviet spy
satellite is falling to earth. But because most of the earth's
surface is covered by water, experts say that the chance the
satellite, the Cosmos 1402, will hit a populated area is very
small.
It is a catastrophe of minor proportions," said Aeronautics
and Astronautics Prof. John Breakwell. He used the term
"minor" because "it is likely to hit the water," he added.
The Soviets commanded the satellite, which was traveling at
an altitude of 150 miles above the earth, to break up into three
fragments on Dec. 28. The largest fragment, containing the
satellite's nuclear reactor, was supposed to be fired into a
higher orbit 500 miles above the earth, where it would have
remained indefinitely. Byt the rocket apparently failed to fire,
and the satellite has since been falling toward a fiery reentry
into the atmosphere.
One of the three fragments has since fallen through the
atmosphere and disintegrated. But U.S. officials say they ex
pect some material from the reactor to survive the reentry.
But because 70 percent of the earth's surface is covered by
water and much of the land is uninhabited, the satellite is
unlikely to pose much of a hazard. But because the satellite is
traveling in such a wide plane of orbit, it could fall anywhere
from Greenland in the north to the southernmost tip of South
America.
The main cause of concern is the satellite's nuclear reactor,
which is fueled by enriched uranium 235, the same highly
radioactive substance that fuels nuclear power plants on land.
The satellite's reactor contains about 100 pounds of the nu
clear fuel. Although the fuel should burn up when the satellite
reenters the earth's atmosphere, U.S. officials say they expect
radioactive debris will eventually reach the earth's surface.
According to Daniel Bershader, Stanford professor of
Aeronautics and Astronautics, it is possible to design such
satellites so that the nuclear element can withstand the heat of
reentry and impact. Such satellites should also have a "suitable
destruct mechanism" to be used in such emergencies, he said.
While American officials have warned of the possible
hazardous effects of the satellite's falling on populated areas
because of the radioactivity involved, the Soviets have claimed
that "the level of radioactivity will remain within the natural '
background limits."
Physics Prof. John Wagoner said that the radioactive mate
rial burning up in the atmosphere would not pose a problem,
because "the total amount of radioactivity" that might be
released in the atmosphere would be "infinitesimal compared
to what you get every day."
Wagoner said that the falling satellite would have no "global
effects."
Asked whether Soviet satellites were more accident-prone
than their Americ?.r. counterparts, Wagoner replied," I sqspect
we have the same safeguards they do."
But Bershader said t&at although he could oot speculate
about how Soviet satellites arjs designed, "I have a gut feeling
that we are a little more careful about these things than the
Soviets."
