If Stanford University Hospital personnel aren't
feeling a little uneasy these days, they should be.
State action has already altered and may drasti
cally change the patient make-up of their hospital.
Currently officials are waiting to hear whether
their clientele will be limited to those who can
afford the costs. If the state does not approve the
Hospital's Medi-Cal contract, Stanford will be un
able to continue care for Medi-Cal patients. The
decision on the contract was supposed to have
been made Jan. 1 but has been delayed.
The loss of the Medi-Cal contract would only
have a harmful impact on the Hospital, not to
mention upon its reputation. In the past, Stanford
has faced criticism for the limited range of its pa
tient make-up. Even now, only 13 percent of its
patients are on Medi-Cal.
In addition, other state legislation has already
ordered all Medically Indigent Adults (MIAs),
"the working poor" who cannot qualify for
Medi-Cal, to be cared for in county hospitals only.
Before Jan. 1, private hospitals such as Stanford's
were able to provide health care to MIAs and
charge the costs to the state.
Although less than 3 percent of the Hospital's
patients are MIAs, they provide an invaluable be
nefit in the training of medical students. Students
are able to broaden their exposure to the types of
cases not usually found in a research hospital like
Stanford. This is no slight matter. Well-rounded
and practical training adds tremendously to a med
ical education.

Moreover, one must consider the more impor
tant and philosophical question of differing qual
ities of medical care at different hospitals. Al
though the state legislators may believe otherwise,
a patient won't get the same care in every hospital.
In one bureaucratic swipe, the MIA legislation
has successfully segregated medical treatment.
I here will be hospitals for the rich and hospitals for
the poor. Many private hospitals like Stanford
have better-trained personnel than most county
hospitals: they can often attract more qualified
people because they can afford to pay better wages
than a government hospital can.
State Medi-Cal officials who are currently
negotiating with other hospitals in the area should
recognize the advantages that a prestigious hospi
tal like Stanford possesses. The patients and the
hospital both would benefit if Stanford were
awarded the contract.
The patients would receive high-quality care
they may not be able to receive in a less well
funded hospital and Stanford gains the opportu
nity to provide the community services and profes
sional training it should be. Moreover, if Stanford
were also to lose its Medi-Cal patients, it would
gain an even more exclusive reputation than it
already has.
It is truly sad that the Hospital has already lost its
MIAs. It would be sadder to see the hospital lose
its Medi-Cal patients as well. But it is even sadder
that state budgetary actions could be keeping the
poor from receiving proper medical care.
