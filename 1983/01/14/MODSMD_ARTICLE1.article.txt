# Revisions discussed at COCE
## 
### JULIE RYAN Staff writer 
In an attempt to eliminate organiza
tional problems, the Committee on
Contemporary Entertainment
(COCE), a staff and student group
which approves campus conccrls, dis
cussed new operating guidelines in a
closed meeting yesterday and replaced
its chairperson early this week.
Ellie Oppenheim, director of Tre
sidder Union, has been named the new
COCE chairperson by Dean of Student
Affairs James Lyons. She replaces
Thom Massey, associate dean of stu
dent affairs. Vicky Holt, director of
events and services, is expected to as
sume the position of chairperson this
spring.
A rotating chair position would
allow the COCE to operate more effi
ciently, "increasing the pace of the
committee," Lyons said.
At yesterday's meeting, the commit
tee "set more explicit guidelines to cut
down the arbitrary sense of how it (the
COCE) works," Massey said.
KZSU radio station members re
cently submitted a letter to the COCE
requesting a review of COCE proce
dures and conflicts of interest.
According to Jim Mooney, KZSU
station manager, the letter criticized
"policies of the COCE which don't
exist." He added, "Every time the
committee meets they change the
guidelines."
The concert committee set three
major criteria to evaluate preliminary
group applications. First, the COCE
will examine the number and commit
ment of people who would be involved
in promoting the concert. Second, the
committee will judge the organiza
tion's previous experience with pro
grams and regular services. Third, the
COCE will evaluate the financial sta
bility of the organization.
According to Mooney, the COCE
previously failed to request specific
criteria in its preliminary concert appli
cation. The COCE approved a one
page document submitted by the
Chaparral. But the committee failed to
approve a 20-page proposal submitted
by KZSU, requesting additional finan
cial information.
The new standardized procedures
should eliminate confusion regarding
application standards, Oppenheim
said.
Massey and Oppenheim denied
claims of biased committee decisions.
But Massey said, "You can't get rid of

the aura of conflict of interest com
pletely."
Uppenheim also refuted conflict of
interest claims made against Bob
Brody, ASSU financial manager. Al
though the ASSU is one of four student
groups comprising the Concert Net
work, Brody is not the ASSU represen
tative on the organization. "He
(Brody) has handled his dual role in a
very professional manner," Op
penheim said.
The COCE adopted new guidelines
for recruiting student interns. Under
the new system, a committee member
cannot have a primary role in produc
ing a campus concert. If a COCE
member is also a member of a group
submitting a proposal, he must abstain
from COCE discussion.
