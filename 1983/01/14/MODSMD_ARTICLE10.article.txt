# Zimbardo: man behind the myth in front of the man
## 
### DANNY PEARL 
He has appeared on national
television on shows like That's
Incredible!, Good Morning
America and The Today Show.
His Introduction to Psychology
course consistently attracts up
ward of 600 students. His often
dramatic research has made him
a popular figure on campus and
beyond. He is Stanford's most
widely known professor, but
Psychology Prof. Philip Zim
bardo is uncomfortable with his
celebrity image.
"It's really interesting. I don't
think of myself in that way. I just
think it's all very curious that
these things happen to me.
What's bad about it is that it's
seen as a barrier.
"My sense is that I'm less close
to students than when I first
came to Stanford. I'm teaching
bigger classes and there are
fewer students who come to see
me. I think part of it may be this
kind of creeping celebrity
status."
Celebrity or not, Zimbardo is
an entertainer. His "lectures"
are actually well produced
shows, complete with movies,
slide shows and demonstrations.
And Zimbardo, microphone in
hand, conducts them with flair.
His round, eternally young face,
his dimples, his California perm,
and his sharp beard give him a
distinctive, almost cherubic ap
pearance; he seems oddly fitted
to the role of emcee.
Zimbardo's productions tend
toward the humorous, as well as
the shocking and dramatic. One
day amusing Candid Camera se
quences are shown, another day
the entire class is hypnotized,
another day a tape of the Jones
town massacre is played. Zim
bardo is criticized for his show
manship, but more often praised
for his enthusiasm.
But is he the same person in
and out of class? To Zimbardo,
the difference is superficial: "I'm
into gesturing (in class), and I
tend to be a more manicky per
son, but offhand I'd say I'm the
same."
But those who know him dis
agree. "lie's a different man in
front of class and in person," said
Brian Jans, who worked as a re
search assistant for Zimbardo.
"In class, lots of people get the
impression that he's really ar
rogant and full of himself, just

because he runs the class in a
showy way. But in person he's a
lot more modest and sensitive."
He is also more relaxed. In this
respect, there are quite clearly
two different strains running
through Zimbardo's personality.
The first is the New Yorker, born
in the Bronx, schooled at Brook
lyn College. "I was a quintessen
tial New Yorker. I was a hustler,
wheeler, dealer, operator, al
ways on the move, always on the
go, always under high stress —
and liking it, perceiving that that
was the only lifestyle."
This is the Philip Zimbardo
that paces frantically back and
forth in class, waving his left
hand up and down in true Italian
fashion to help make his point.
This is the Zimbardo that greets
you hurriedly, that talks in tense,
broken sentences, his blue eyes
darting about suspiciously. This
is the Zimbardo who is always
probing for the exciting and new.

"I need a tremendous amount
of stimulation. I mean, I often
think of my life as very boring,
and what that is, is a couple of
days go by and I don't have any
exciting thoughts, and I don't
meet any interesting people, and
I haven't done anything which is
different.
"And then when I step back
and look at it I say, 'God, that's
really crazy. I've been running all
around the country doing inter
views, I've been teaching at Stan
ford.' It's part of what comes out
of living in New York, is that
there's just a very high expecta
tion for stimulation of whatever
kind. You're going to get
mugged, you're going to get
raped; you're going to make
love: something good or some
thing bad is always happening."
Then there's Philip Zimbardo,
the Californian. He moved here
12 years ago and has stayed ever
since. This is the part that flashes

a warm smile, that lets his paun
chy body lie back in his office
chair and talks to you with his
arms pillowing his head and his
voice totally relaxed. It is also the
part that, paradoxically, with
draws from other people.
"People are less important for
me than they were in New York.
I mean, in my perception a cen
tral aspect of functioning in New
York is having intense personal
relationships, and people work
hard to avoid intense personal
relationships in California. You
have acquaintances and not deep
friends.
"I'd say since I'm here I've
only made a couple of friends
that are really close. And proba
bly it's my fault for being a
worker, and probably it's the
ethos of Stanford and California
where other people have not felt
strong enough to make an ap
proach to make ir\e their friend.

The environment always wins. It
is the rare cucumber that you put
into a vinegar barrel that does
not come out a pickle."
Zimbardo seems on the whole
happy to be at Stanford, though.
Like most professors, he praises
the students for their intelligence
and potential, and like most pro
fessors, he mourns the fact that
"they don't exploit Stanford;
they don't exploit the faculty."
According to his son, Adam, a
junior here who lives at the
Alpha Delta Phi fraternity
house, the elder Zimbardo wel
comes opportunities to take
breaks from his grueling
schedule and relax with students.
" He spends a lot of time at the
house. We gave him a bid last
spring, mainly because he eats
more dinners here than most of
the people in the house. He
comes to a lot of Friday kegs, too;
we got him to chug his first beer
this year.

"He has a really good time at
ADs. I think he'd like to live
here if he could and just forget
about the outside world. It's hard
for him because he gets really
work-fixated sometimes. I think
he likes this place because it
gives him a chance to deal with
people who aren't always talking
about publication deadlines."
Zimbardo spends a great deal
of time writing. In addition to
writing articles and papers, he is
constantly updating his book,
"Essentials of Psychology and
Life," which is used as a
textbook in his and many other
courses. He sometimes spends
seven hours a day writing at
home, according to his son.
His research has ranged across
all areas of social psychology. He
has written extensively on vio
lence and aggression; he single
handedly made shyness a topic of
psychological research; he did

work in hypnosis; and he is cur
rently studying mind control. Of
ten, as with the Stanford Prison
Experiment in 1970, the results
are controversial. Always, the
research and the teaching are
tightly interwoven.
"What's fortunate is that the
research I do I can talk about in
class, and then while teaching 1
can get ideas that I can then re
search. 1 never have to role-play
being enthusiastic about the con
tent of what I'm teaching if it's
the main thing I'm working on in
my life." Indeed, Zimbardo so
often becomes the subject of his
own lectures that he is dismissed
by some as an egotist.
But even cynical observers
have to admit that Zimbardo has
a far-reaching concern for stu
dents. His secretary, Rosanne
Saussotte, said, "He likes to talk
to students. Sometimes I have to
pull him away so that other
people who need to see him
don't have to wait an hour."
Sean Kelly, a student who par
ticipated in a special hypnosis
experiment with Zimbardo,
felt that "he was trying to make
us get the most of our time; he
was teaching us about hyp
notism."
Even Zimbardo's testing sys
tem reveals an overwhelming de
sire to be fair to his students.
Students can improve their grade
by arguing over wrong answers.
"I try to minimize situations
where I say 'you have to do it
because I say you have to, or be
cause I have the power of author
ity or I know what's best for you.'
Some of the ways of reorganized
teaching and testing really come
out of that."
Said one student advisee: "He
knows where students aie com
ing from, so he takes the stu
dent's perspective. Like I can
come in and tell him I don't want
to take a certain class because
I've heard the final's impossible
and the professor's a jerk; and
we can talk about it at that level.
And he always asks me about
other areas of my life."
Indeed, there is one facet to
Philip Zimbardo that is always
visible — he cares. He cares
about the world, which is why he
takes his work so seriously. And
he cares about individual people,
whether he is in front of a class or
one-on-one, whether he is being
a Californian or a New Yorker.

Professor Phillip Zimbardo (upper left) teaches what is arguably the most
popular course on campus, as shown by the standing-room only crowds he

draws for his classes. Despite his popularity, however, he feels that he is
getting to know fewer students as his fame is making students shy of him.
