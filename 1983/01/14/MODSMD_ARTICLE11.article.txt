## The 						Stanford Daily King's dream of non-violence 
### 
We all remember the face. We saw it in a movie,
or newspaper in grammar school, junior high or
even high school. It was a friendly face, but some
what stern. It was determined. The face of Dr.
Martin Luther King, Jr. told us about a dream, a
dream that black and white children could hold
hands some day in the future Without caring about
the color of the other's skin.
We ponder that dream for a few moments each
Jan. 15, the anniversary of King's birth, but 15
years later few of us realize the impact that he still
has on our day-to-day lives.
Racial and economic equality, dignity for
humankind, non-violence — King's career as a
civil rights activist and leader of the black libera
tion movement was dedicated to these ideals. So
often since his death these abstracts have been
associated with King's name that he has become,
perhaps more as a martyr than as an activist, a
symbol of the emotions of the '60s.
Yet King has left a practical legacy often forgot
ten.
A strong supporter of equal education, he was
largely responsible for starting the Basic Educa
tional Opportunity Grant (BEOG) program, and
he precipitated an acceleration of affirmative ac
tion efforts around the country. Affirmative action

for minorities, though discussed in University ad
ministrative circles prior to King's assassination,
was really not implemented here until after his
death. Their success (22.4 percent of Stanford stu
dents are minorities now) is largely due to his
efforts.
King also pushed for the hot lunch at inner-city
primary and secondary schools, the installation of
ramps for the handicapped and the printing of
braille course catalogs for the blind.
In 1964, King won the Nobel Peace Prize —
both for his achievements and the manner in which
he brought them about. He will be remembered for
his policy of non-violence, a policy which proved
more effective in bringing about his goals than all
of the racial riots during the '60s. In our era, one of
domestic economic crisis and increasing interna
tional tension, this ethic of non-violence should be
studied for its worth, and for the survival of man
kind.
King's dream was one of love, one which went
beyond religion and race, one which preached
equality and hope. His dream proved to be too
much for all Americans to accept, but to those who
can accept his vision, it remains, 15 years after his
death, a cause for celebration.
