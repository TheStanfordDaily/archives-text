# From scholars to salesmen

The $400,000 boost so far to University reve
nues from expanding software marketing —
coupled with recently released figures ranking
Stanford first among universities in technology
licensing revenues — may come as welcome relief
to increasing budget problems. Initial pleasure at
this payoff should be tempered by concern that this
relief may bring enormous, far-reaching costs.
Stanford certainly needs the money. The Uni
versity faces prospects of deep departmental cuts,
diminishing sources of federal funds for research
and financial aid, fast-paced energy costs and ris
ing tuition charges. And with chances of revived
inflation, continuing Depression shadows and
further threats to federal education funds, tradi
tional funding sources will provide no quick bail
outs.
These budget problems may also affect stan
dards and structure of research and teaching con
ducted here: hiring may diminish, and so may the
innovation and expansion defining any world-class
university. Money for implementing programs that
refine ideas of what education should be — for the
experimentation Stanford provides for much of
higher education — has dwindled to only a token
amount. Provost Albert Hastorf has stated that
funds for new programs will maintain only "some
atmosphere of pushing forward."
Beyond these financial problems looms the El
Dorado of applied science profits. During fiscal
1982, the University received more than $2.5 mil
lion from technology licensing — more than any
other university. That sum buys lots of test tubes,
underwrites a scholarship or two and pays quite a
few professors. The recombinant DNA patent
provided the bulk of the funds, but 56 technologies
contributed to the kitty. The tendency for re
searchers to give their share of profits to the Uni
versity, too, discourages charges of crass profit
oriented research.
Yet we cannot pretend that these potentially
enormous benefits come without potentially
enormous costs. The first warning comes in the
repeated and strenuous denials that research is
being warped by the promise of fame and money

associated with the final payoff: the administrator
doth protest too much.
The obvious danger of researchers or depart
ments directing their efforts toward work that
might turn a profit is the least of many costs. The
problem is very real, but it can be monitored and
fended off with the vigilance prevalent in an
academic community. There will, however, be an
increasing tension between the need to fund schol
arship and the desire to prevent financial consid
erations from distorting that scholarship.
The current, broad definition of appropriate,
pure research could be a less obvious casualty of
the intertwining of laboratory and marketplace.
The conflict might be self-aggrandizing, as it has
been in biology: issues preceding potential applica
tion define basic research when the enormous
gravity of the marketplace shifts the perspective of
what constitutes scholarship itself. Of course,
sources for funding, determined partially by what
research can be applied, will shape what research is
undertaken — even as that funding blurs distinc
tions between pure and applied research.
The very purpose of a university becomes mud
dled as administrators don entrepreneurial caps.
They make an almost Faustian bargain when the
University strives to participate in the market
place, as it has by accepting business support for
high technology fields, by acting as a supplier for
software middlemen and by ensuring through pat
ents that market rights are maintained and even
fostered. In its quest for growth through market
income, the university assumes the manner and
structure of a business — and thereby risks losing
its soul, the ideal of insulated research unsullied by
considerations other than intellectual exploration.
Stanford leads the nation in this uneasy alliance
between the university and business. For the sake
of those qualities that distinguish education —
teaching and research directed toward basic explo
ration of knowledge — Stanford must also con
front the problems of the alliance as directly and
publicly as possible. Actions in this area now will
define the American university; its strengths and
guiding principles cannot be pawned for a more
secure future.
