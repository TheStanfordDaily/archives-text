## East is east and Stanford at Oxford is Stanford 
### 
Prof. Ronald Hilton's recent article
on the new Stanford in Oxford pro
gram (Daily, Jan. 10) claims that much
needs to be done so that Stanford stu
dents are not treated there as second
class citizens. He addresses himself not
only to how Oxford may view Stanford
students as second class, but also how
he sees Stanford students as inferior to
those in the Oxford class, and encour
ages students abroad to follow the old
adage of "when in Rome, do as the
Romans do." I think the latter sugges
tion is entirely appropriate, because it
is extremely rude and insensitive to of
fend the sensibilities of one's host when
one is a guest. This applies whether the
host is Oxford or the University of
Outer Mongolia at Ulan Bator. But I
think that Hilton's perjorative remarks
about the second class nature of the
Stanford (read "American") student
are unfounded and unfair.
"Rhodes Scholars," writes Hilton,
"are definitely first-class citizens, be
cause they are the product of a rigorous
selection process, which is the modus
operandi of Oxford." Admittance to
Oxford is difficult (so is getting into
Stanford), but nowhere near as difficult
as becoming a Rhodes Scholar. The
picture Hilton paints of Oxford is of
wall-to-wall scholars and gentlemen of
Rhodes caliber sipping sherry and
cracking walnuts in the Junior Com
mon Room, but it would be more accu
rate to say that Oxford is populated by
students not unlike those at Stanford,
although some cultural and social
habits differ. We have our scholars,
preppies, sun worshippers and social
ites, and they have their scholars, pub

lic school preppies, children of aristo
crats and socialites (remember that
Brideshead Revisited was not entirely
fiction). We have our rock concerts
complete with "musicians" and beer
busts, and they have their equivalents. I
spent six months in Cambridge several
years ago (the city, not the university),
and was amazed to see the pubs jam
med during weeknights with students
drinking beer and playing darts. Why, I
joked to a friend, were these students
not home studying? I have enjoyed
conversations with Cambridge stu
dents which were every bit as funny,
obscene, witty and foul-mouthed as
any that I've had with Stanford under
graduates. In fact, the English have a
certain prediliction for disgusting
comments such as "bloody c ," both
verbally and in print; I'm sure the Daily
has too high standards to allow such
obscenities.
While, as Hilton points out, the En
glish college system is more oriented
toward tutorials and "reading" your
major, there is one simple truth both
here and at Oxford: some people do
their work, and some don't. On the
other hand, with respect to the diver
sity of course choices available to the
Stanford student, as opposed to her
Oxford counterpart who reads only
one subject, perhaps we are more "lib
erally educated" than our English
speaking counterparts?
As to the stunning beauty of Oxford
versus the San Quentin existence here
on the Farm, I think it's fair to say that
Stanford has a different but outstand
ing physical plant. Though some may
say it looks like an overgrown Taco

Bell, I think the Stanford campus is
remarkable. Let's not feel second-class
because we don't look like Oxford.
Let's just be ourselves.
Oxford and Cambridge are sub
sidized by the British government in a
manner completely unlike their En
glish equivalents. They receive far
more money than any other univer
sities in England â€” so much, in fact,
that the British government refuses to
divulge exactly how much. (Not sur
prisingly, many government officials
are alumni.) A report issued several
years ago by the Stanford Institute for
Finance and Government claimed the
details of this funding to be one of the
best-kept secrets in the fiscal labyrinths
of the British government. Stanford's
position with respect to the govern
ment and sister institutions, while
privileged, is far more egalitarian. Any
thing would have to be.
Finally, despite its many intellectual
and cultural merits, which I thoroughly
enjoyed as a visitor, Oxford (and Cam
bridge) represent the apex of snob
bishness and elitism which is rivaled by
few other places in the world, with a
level of pretentiousness per cubic cen
timeter that deserves mention in the
Guinness Book of World Records.
Students don't just "go" to Oxford,
they "go up." While this is meant to
emphasize that Oxford is north of Lon
don, the image it evokes of Mount
Olympus or Mount Sinai is not entirely
accidental. Oxford was founded some
600 years ago; it was older in 1701,
when Yale was founded, than Yale is
today. For a very long time it has oc
cupied a privileged place in a society

that is far more class oriented than our
own, and by and large it looks down on
all other academic institutions (save
Cambridge, maybe) as second-class.
Despite my critical remarks, Oxford
has a long history of outstanding schol
arship and research in the arts and sci
ences, and has much to offer the
American student from the Farm,
which is why it has been chosen as a
foreign campus. So do like the Ro
mans, enjoy, respect and learn from
their company, but don't insist on be
coming one of them. Stanford has noth
ing to be ashamed of in terms of its
academic accomplishments, and in my
opinion is a surprisingly open environ
ment where people can speak out
frankly and be heard, where academic
arrogance has not run amuck. Oxford
has its way of doing things, and so do
we. I see no need to imitate them.

Wallenberg
In the Jan. 6 issue of the Daily, one of
your reporters described Raoul Wallen
berg as Hungarian! For your informa
tion, Raoul Wallenberg was or is a
Swede, born a member of the leading
Swedish banking family and employed
by the Swedish Foreign Service when
he was kidnapped by the Soviets, in
Hungary, at the end of World War 11.
Since most Swedes are very proud of
this man, who was or is truly a hero, by
any standard, we get upset when you
deny his Swedish heritage.
