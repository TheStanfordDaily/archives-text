## Revolution no solution in RSA 
### 
The government of the Republic of
South Africa (RSA) recently an
nounced the drafting of a new constitu
tion that would grant selected non
whites the right to participate in the
political process.
The constitution drawn up by P.W.
Botha, the prime minister of South Af
rica, represents a rather modest at
tempt to placate internal turmoil and to
disacknowledge criticisms directed at
the RSA by the world community.
Because of its policy of apartheid,
South Africa has been the object, dur
ing the last 15 years, of international
expressions of hostility. Since 1948 this
policy has represented the central
theme in the life of this country. Apar
theid, meaning "separateness," at

structure in which each of the major

Africans do not benefit from some of the efforts
of the international black community aimed at
economically and politically isolating South
Africa from the rest of the world.

racial groups living in the 9ountry pur
sues different paths of development.
The inhabitants of this rich nation at
the extreme tip of the African conti
nent are legally divided into two main
categories: "whites" and "blacks." The
whites, representing only 16 percent of
the 28 million residents, retain com
plete control over all aspects of the
government, administration and eco
nomy. The blacks or non-whites, com
prising Africans (72 percent of the
population), coloreds (9 percent of the
population) and Asians/Indians (3 per
cent of the population), are relegated
to the role of second-class citizens.
The planned constitution, which the
Wall Street Journal has defined accu
rately as a classic expression of "survi
val politics" envisions the creation of a
parliamentary system of government
composed of three chambers — one
each for whites, coloreds and Indians
— headed by a white president whose
powers allow him to govern by decree if
necessary.
But what about the 22 million Afri
cans? According to Botha, the con

them to work in skilled and other high
paying jobs which have been, until re
cently, the exclusive domain of non-
Africans. The prime minister believes
that creating economic incentives is the
best way to avoid dealing with some of
the broader political and social de
mands of the African population. Ob
viously, the Africans reject this notion.
There are those advocating a non
violent struggle against the whites such
as Mangosuthu Buthelezi, head of a
Zulu tribe and of the largest anti
apartheid organization in the country,
and those such as Joe Slovo, a high
ranking white member of Umkhonto
we Sizwe, the armed faction of the Af
rican National Congress (ANC), who
see terrorism and violence as the sole
method capable of forcing the white
regime to renounce its policies.

stitution would pave the way for ;i
dramatic improvement in the economic
conditions of Africans. It would permit
The same differences of opinion
exist within the international commu
nity. On one end of the spectrum lies
President Reagan's "constructive en
gagement" policy that opposes apar
theid in principle but refrains from pub
licly expressing this view. On the other
end of the spectrum are the socialist
marxist nations of black Africa th?' <re
contributing financially and politically
to efforts to violently overthrow the
white government.
Unfortunately, this internal conflict
has assumed ideological dimensions
that could lead to the internationaliza
tion of the dispute. Those who would
stand to lose the most from such a de
velopment would be the Africans.
They would become the instruments of
a broader East-West dispute with
which they are not concerned. In the
words of Chief Buthelezi:
"Black South Africa is not ideologi
cal . . . (people) understand that
hunger is placated by food; shelter
comes from a house; care comes from
hospitals and security comes from
work. Ideologies do not produce these
things. They only promise them some
time in the future. . .

Africans do not benefit from some of
the efforts of the international black
community aimed at isolating econom
ically and politically South Africa from
the rest of the world. Among these ef
forts was the opposition to the $1.1
billion loan by the International Mone
tary Fund (IMF) to South Africa last
October and the "disinvestment" cam
paign intended to dismantle existing
and discourage future investment in
the RSA by American corporations.
Refusal of the loan would, as the Wall
Street Journal points out, wind up hurt
ing the very people it is intended to
help because the government would
most likely cover the extra cost in
volved in borrowing from private
banks by cutting back on domestic pro
grams benefiting blacks. Depriving
American corporations of the possibil
ity to invest in the RSA allows Euro
pean and Japanese companies, instead,
to take advantage of these opportuni
ties.
Unless we believe that a bloody re
volution represents the answer to the
problems of blacks within South Africa
we must be willing to accept a solution
of compromise. This is a more difficult
and challenging course to pursue. One
could argue that Africans have nothing
to loose from a revolution. Not true. A
civil, war would bring about an eco
nomic collapse that would cause even
greater misery to Africans. The heavy
black immigration into South Africa
from such newly independent and
"free" countries as Zimbabwe,
Mozambique and Botswana is evi
dence that economic survival and wel
fare often retain, among Africans, a
higher priority than political freedom.
The efforts of people in the Western
world must be directed toward ena
bling Africans to change apartheid
from within South Africa. We should
lobby our legislatures to establish a
humanitarian aid program for blacks in
South Africa to be administered
through international agencies.
Moreover, we should give young black
South Africans the opportunity to
come to the United States or Western
Europe to study and experience living
in a just multi-racial society for a lim
ited period of time.
By contributing to the improvement
of their economic and educational
level, we will increase the chances that
black South Africans will realize their
own political destinies without having
to resort to violent confrontation.
