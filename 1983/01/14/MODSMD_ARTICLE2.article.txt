Vogel: Soviets willing to reduce warheads
Bonn, West Germany — West Germany's opposition candidate for chan
cellor, Hans Jochen Vogel, said yesterday that the Soviet Union was pre
pared to negotiate on the number of warheads not just the number of in
termediate-range missiles in Europe.
Reporting on talks with Soviet leader Yuri Andropov in Moscow this
week. Vogel told a press conference that the Soviets were willing to destroy
some of their missiles aimed at Western Europe — a position he had alluded
to earlier this week — and to seek a balance in the number of warheads, not
just missiles, deploved bv both sides.
U.S. diplomats said the change could be significant because it would mean
that Moscow was "moving in the right direction of measuring actual bal
ances and not just missiles" and thus accepting Washington's view on the
key matter of arms control criteria. Western nations have reported making
diplomatic efforts in Moscow to seek further details of the announced Soviet
initiatives, including those for the Euromissile talks in Geneva.
The primary Soviet weapon aimed at Western Europe, the SS-20, contains
three warheads, while the U.S. missiles scheduled for deployment in Western
Europe later this year are to be armed with only one warhead apiece.
Until now, the Soviets have indicated willingness to reduce the number of
SS-20s to match the total of British and French intermediate missiles. Not all
of the 162 British-French missiles have multiple warheads, so the Soviet al
lusion to a balance of warheads could mean a new flexibility — perhaps in
cluding acceptance of some U.S. Pershing II and cruise missiles in Europe as
now planned by NATO. The public Soviet position has been to oppose that
deployment absolutely.
During 24 hours of talks with the new Soviet
leader, Social Democrat Vogel said, Andropov
told him the Soviets were prepared not only to
scrap some of their missiles but also remove others
to points so far east that they could not strike West
Germany or other West European countries.
Shultz denies disarray
Washington — Secretary of State George Shultz
denied yesterday any administration disarray over
how to negotiate with the Soviets and moved to
strengthen his grip on the U.S. Arms Control and
Disarmament Agency (ACDA) after President
Reagan fired Director Eugene Rostow.
"We have the situation firmly under control,"
Shultz said as he announced Kenneth Dam, his
deputy and former colleague at the University of
Chicago, would "provide day-to-day policy gui
dance" to the embattled nuclear arms control
agency.
Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.) didn't buy
that. "The latest changes in the arms control lead
ership of our nation reflect the continuing disarray
in the arms control policies of this adminis
tration," he said.
"The prevention of nuclear war is the fundamen
tal challenge of our time, and no president should
permit the mission and the personnel of ACDA to
become political footballs in the hands of Senate
extremists opposed to responsible arms control,"
Kennedy said.
Rostow resigned Wednesday under fire from
Reagan and and a group of conservative Re
publican senators, headed by Jesse Helms (R-
N.C.) who had already succeeded in stripping him
of two close assistants, Robert Grey, his deputy di
rector, and Norman Terrell.
Stressing that Reagan is "the boss" and that his
policy on seeking arms control agreements with the
Soviet Union would not be changed, Shultz said
Reagan also intends to play a dominant role.
Shultz took over the daily press briefing at the
State Department to get his views to reporters im
mediately after Rostow bade an emotional farewell
to agency colleagues in the Dean Acheson
auditorium.
Rostow said that after years of neglect, the agen
cy had played a major part in shaping adminis
tration policy.
But in a reference to the upheavals that led to his
resignation, Rostow said the "political and bu
reaucratic difficulties ... never quite went away and
have now been manifest anew."

Israel, Lebanon to negotiate
Kirvat Shmona, Israel — Pressure from Presi
dent Reagan broke a three-week deadlock yester
day as Israel and Lebanon agreed to negotiate si
multaneously on the withdrawal of Israeli and oth
er foreign troops from Lebanon and on future rela
tions between Israel and Lebanon.
Despite agreement on a compromise agenda giv
ing priority to neither issue, the two governments
made clear that in the negotiations each would put
its primary concern first.
Lebanese officials in Beirut said when the Israeli,
Lebanese and American negotiators get down to
business at their next meeting Monday, their dele
gation would propose a comprehensive plan for
withdrawal of all Israeli troops from Lebanon.
Israeli Defense Minister Ariel Sharon said he
was sure the negotiators "will arrive at security ar
rangements and normalization as the first stage to
peace between Israel and Lebanon."
Through four semi-weekly meetings in this
northern Israeli town and the south Beirut suburb
of Khalde, the Israelis insisted that the negotiators
first agree on normalization of relations between
the two nations, while the Lebanese demanded
priority for withdrawal of the estimated 60,000 Is
raeli, Syrian and Palestinian troops.
At the tTth meeting Monday in Khalde, both
Lebanon an<l Israel accepted special U.S. envoy
Morris Drape.'* proposal for concurrent nego

tiations on all the issues, but each demanded
changes. Agreement finally came at the sixth meet
ing after Philip Habib, Reagan's chief Middle East
envoy, arrived from Washington with word that
the president was growing impatient and wanted
an end to the deadlock.

Reagan nixes army pay hike
Washington — President Reagan did not consult
the Joint Chiefs of Staff before deciding to scrap
the 7.6 percent October pav increase for the 2.1 mil
lion men and women in uniform. Gen. Charles
(iabriel, the Air Force chief of staff, said yesterday.
Ciabriel said that he and his fellow chiefs would
be willing to trade weapons for pay raises if such a
choice has to be made, but responded, "I'm not
going to give vou a hit list," when asked what
weapons he would be willing to give up.
(iabriel, answering questions from Pentagon re
porters over breakfast, said not only had he not
been consulted about the pay freeze but also he had
not been officially informed that the president had
decided to impose it.
Later in the day the Pentagon's public affairs of
fice issued a statement apparently designed to take
the political sting out of Gabriel's remarks. It said
that Marine Corps Commandant Robert Barrow,
acting chairman of the Joint Chiefs, "stated that
the United States military establishment is ready to
respond to the president's request and do its part in
restoring economic strength to the nation."
Lt. Col. DeLorme, a deputy to Henry Catto, as
sistant secretary of defense for public affairs,
whose office issued the statement, said, "I don't
know" when asked where Barrow had made the
statement. Catto's office paraphrased what it said
were Barrow's remarks, without quoting him
directly at any point or explaining where or why he
made the remarks.
"He said that the relations between the Joint
Chiefs and the White House have never been bet
ter," the public affairs office statement said of Bar
row.

Soviets pro-Arafat peace plan
Moscow — Palestine Liberation Organization
Chairman Yasser Arafat won qualified Soviet sup
port yesterday for a Middle East settlement plan
under which a future Palestinian state would enter
into a confederation with Jordan.
The Soviet reservations were underscored in an
official communique in which Arafat's position
was said to have been met bv "an attitude of under
standing" from the Soviet leadership.
Earlier in the day, Arafat told a news conference
that Soviet leader Yuri Andropov and other of
ficials have told him that they would agree to any
thing the Palestinian people accepted.
Arafat said Moscow was "in agreement" with a
PLO plan under which an "independent Palesti
nian state would enter into a confederation with'
Jordan, and that this would be decided by a refer
endum."

Japan aids U.S. imports
Tokyo — Amid a groundswell of protectionist
sentiment on Capitol Hill, Japan yesterday an
nounced its latest round of steps to give foreign
products greater access to the market here in a bid
to smooth the wav for Prime Minister Yasuhiro
Nakasone's visit to Washington next week for
talks with President Reagan.
Adopted at a special meeting of Nakasone's key
economic ministers, the measures promised no im
mediate relief for the huge $20 billion U.S. deficit
in its trade with Japan.
Thev did, however, outline a broad strategy for
dismantling the labyrinthine customs, product
standards and testing procedures which American
businessmen complain bar them from competing

in lucrative markets here.
The new trade package came amid a govern
ment-orchestrated publicity drive clearly designed
to avert a protectionist backlash in Washington by
attempting to demonstrate Nakasone's de
termination to improve badlv strained relations
with the United States, Japan's biggest overseas
customer.
The new steps did not differ substantially from
two previous sets of measures adopted by Tokyo
over the past 12 months and thev appeared des
tined to meet the same chillv response from U.S.
officials who have been pressing Japan to take
more dramatic action.
U.S. may curb Chinese imports
Peking — Just three weeks before Secretary of
State George Shultz's scheduledgood will visit
here, sensitive Sino-American textile talks broke
down yesterday with China blaming the U.S. side
for "lacking sincerity."
Unless the Reagan administration retreats from
earlier threats, Washington will act tomorrow to
unilaterally curb certain Chinese textile imports —
a move Peking has hinted could ignite a bitter trade
war between the two nations.
"Should the U.S. side obstinately impose unilat
eral controls, the Chinese side will have to respond
strongly," warned China's chief textile negotiator,
Li Dengshan, whose remarks were carried last
night bv the official news agency.
U.S. textile negotiator Peter Murphy, who
headed the American team here during the week
long, last-ditch talks, was unavailable for comment
last night. He is scheduled to hold a news con
ference today before returning to Washington.
U.S. diplomats here had hoped to sweep away
the nagging trade dispute before Shultz's Feb. 2 ar
rival so he could focus on the larger strategic issues
of common concern and restore lost momentum in
Sino-American relations.
At issue is a new agreement for limiting the types
and amounts of products that China's rapidly ex
panding textile industry can export to the United
States. The previous pact expired Dec. 31, but
Washington agreed to extend it until tomorrow to
allow for a final round of negotiations.
Stocks down; trading slow
Stock prices retreated and trading slowed yester
day in a letdown that followed the Dow Jones in
dustrial average's brief flirtation with the 1100
level the day before.
Dow Jones' average of 30 blue chips dropped
9.66 to 1,073.95.
New York Stock Exchange volume totaled 77.03
million shares, down from 109.85 million the day
before.

long, last-ditch talks, was unavailable for comment
last night. He is scheduled to hold a news con
ference today before returning to Washington.
U.S. diplomats here had hoped to sweep away
the nagging trade dispute before Shultz's Feb. 2 ar
rival so he could focus on the larger strategic issues
of common concern and restore lost momentum in
Sino-American relations.
At issue is a new agreement for limiting the types
and amounts of products that China's rapidly ex
panding textile industry can export to the United
States. The previous pact expired Dec. 31, but
Washington agreed to extend it until tomorrow to
allow for a final round of negotiations.

Vogel: Soviets willing to reduce warheads
Bonn, West Germany — West Germany's opposition candidate for chan
cellor, Hans Jochen Vogel, said yesterday that the Soviet Union was pre
pared to negotiate on the number of warheads not just the number of in
termediate-range missiles in Europe.
Reporting on talks with Soviet leader Yuri Andropov in Moscow this
week. Vogel told a press conference that the Soviets were willing to destroy
some of their missiles aimed at Western Europe — a position he had alluded
to earlier this week — and to seek a balance in the number of warheads, not
just missiles, deploved bv both sides.
U.S. diplomats said the change could be significant because it would mean
that Moscow was "moving in the right direction of measuring actual bal
ances and not just missiles" and thus accepting Washington's view on the
key matter of arms control criteria. Western nations have reported making
diplomatic efforts in Moscow to seek further details of the announced Soviet
initiatives, including those for the Euromissile talks in Geneva.
The primary Soviet weapon aimed at Western Europe, the SS-20, contains
three warheads, while the U.S. missiles scheduled for deployment in Western
Europe later this year are to be armed with only one warhead apiece.
Until now, the Soviets have indicated willingness to reduce the number of
SS-20s to match the total of British and French intermediate missiles. Not all
of the 162 British-French missiles have multiple warheads, so the Soviet al
lusion to a balance of warheads could mean a new flexibility — perhaps in
cluding acceptance of some U.S. Pershing II and cruise missiles in Europe as
now planned by NATO. The public Soviet position has been to oppose that
deployment absolutely.
During 24 hours of talks with the new Soviet
leader, Social Democrat Vogel said, Andropov
told him the Soviets were prepared not only to
scrap some of their missiles but also remove others
to points so far east that they could not strike West
Germany or other West European countries.
Shultz denies disarray
Washington — Secretary of State George Shultz
denied yesterday any administration disarray over
how to negotiate with the Soviets and moved to
strengthen his grip on the U.S. Arms Control and
Disarmament Agency (ACDA) after President
Reagan fired Director Eugene Rostow.
"We have the situation firmly under control,"
Shultz said as he announced Kenneth Dam, his
deputy and former colleague at the University of
Chicago, would "provide day-to-day policy gui
dance" to the embattled nuclear arms control
agency.
Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.) didn't buy
that. "The latest changes in the arms control lead
ership of our nation reflect the continuing disarray
in the arms control policies of this adminis
tration," he said.
"The prevention of nuclear war is the fundamen
tal challenge of our time, and no president should
permit the mission and the personnel of ACDA to
become political footballs in the hands of Senate
extremists opposed to responsible arms control,"
Kennedy said.
Rostow resigned Wednesday under fire from
Reagan and and a group of conservative Re
publican senators, headed by Jesse Helms (R-
N.C.) who had already succeeded in stripping him
of two close assistants, Robert Grey, his deputy di
rector, and Norman Terrell.
Stressing that Reagan is "the boss" and that his
policy on seeking arms control agreements with the
Soviet Union would not be changed, Shultz said
Reagan also intends to play a dominant role.
Shultz took over the daily press briefing at the
State Department to get his views to reporters im
mediately after Rostow bade an emotional farewell
to agency colleagues in the Dean Acheson
auditorium.
Rostow said that after years of neglect, the agen
cy had played a major part in shaping adminis
tration policy.
But in a reference to the upheavals that led to his
resignation, Rostow said the "political and bu
reaucratic difficulties ... never quite went away and
have now been manifest anew."

Israel, Lebanon to negotiate
Kirvat Shmona, Israel — Pressure from Presi
dent Reagan broke a three-week deadlock yester
day as Israel and Lebanon agreed to negotiate si
multaneously on the withdrawal of Israeli and oth
er foreign troops from Lebanon and on future rela
tions between Israel and Lebanon.
Despite agreement on a compromise agenda giv
ing priority to neither issue, the two governments
made clear that in the negotiations each would put
its primary concern first.
Lebanese officials in Beirut said when the Israeli,
Lebanese and American negotiators get down to
business at their next meeting Monday, their dele
gation would propose a comprehensive plan for
withdrawal of all Israeli troops from Lebanon.
Israeli Defense Minister Ariel Sharon said he
was sure the negotiators "will arrive at security ar
rangements and normalization as the first stage to
peace between Israel and Lebanon."
Through four semi-weekly meetings in this
northern Israeli town and the south Beirut suburb
of Khalde, the Israelis insisted that the negotiators
first agree on normalization of relations between
the two nations, while the Lebanese demanded
priority for withdrawal of the estimated 60,000 Is
raeli, Syrian and Palestinian troops.
At the tTth meeting Monday in Khalde, both
Lebanon an<l Israel accepted special U.S. envoy
Morris Drape.'* proposal for concurrent nego

tiations on all the issues, but each demanded
changes. Agreement finally came at the sixth meet
ing after Philip Habib, Reagan's chief Middle East
envoy, arrived from Washington with word that
the president was growing impatient and wanted
an end to the deadlock.

Reagan nixes army pay hike
Washington — President Reagan did not consult
the Joint Chiefs of Staff before deciding to scrap
the 7.6 percent October pav increase for the 2.1 mil
lion men and women in uniform. Gen. Charles
(iabriel, the Air Force chief of staff, said yesterday.
Ciabriel said that he and his fellow chiefs would
be willing to trade weapons for pay raises if such a
choice has to be made, but responded, "I'm not
going to give vou a hit list," when asked what
weapons he would be willing to give up.
(iabriel, answering questions from Pentagon re
porters over breakfast, said not only had he not
been consulted about the pay freeze but also he had
not been officially informed that the president had
decided to impose it.
Later in the day the Pentagon's public affairs of
fice issued a statement apparently designed to take
the political sting out of Gabriel's remarks. It said
that Marine Corps Commandant Robert Barrow,
acting chairman of the Joint Chiefs, "stated that
the United States military establishment is ready to
respond to the president's request and do its part in
restoring economic strength to the nation."
Lt. Col. DeLorme, a deputy to Henry Catto, as
sistant secretary of defense for public affairs,
whose office issued the statement, said, "I don't
know" when asked where Barrow had made the
statement. Catto's office paraphrased what it said
were Barrow's remarks, without quoting him
directly at any point or explaining where or why he
made the remarks.
"He said that the relations between the Joint
Chiefs and the White House have never been bet
ter," the public affairs office statement said of Bar
row.

Soviets pro-Arafat peace plan
Moscow — Palestine Liberation Organization
Chairman Yasser Arafat won qualified Soviet sup
port yesterday for a Middle East settlement plan
under which a future Palestinian state would enter
into a confederation with Jordan.
The Soviet reservations were underscored in an
official communique in which Arafat's position
was said to have been met bv "an attitude of under
standing" from the Soviet leadership.
Earlier in the day, Arafat told a news conference
that Soviet leader Yuri Andropov and other of
ficials have told him that they would agree to any
thing the Palestinian people accepted.
Arafat said Moscow was "in agreement" with a
PLO plan under which an "independent Palesti

Jordan, and that this would be decided by a refer

Japan aids U.S. imports
Tokyo — Amid a groundswell of protectionist
sentiment on Capitol Hill, Japan yesterday an
nounced its latest round of steps to give foreign
products greater access to the market here in a bid
to smooth the wav for Prime Minister Yasuhiro
Nakasone's visit to Washington next week for
talks with President Reagan.
Adopted at a special meeting of Nakasone's key
economic ministers, the measures promised no im
mediate relief for the huge $20 billion U.S. deficit
in its trade with Japan.
Thev did, however, outline a broad strategy for
dismantling the labyrinthine customs, product
standards and testing procedures which American
businessmen complain bar them from competing

in lucrative markets here.
The new trade package came amid a govern
ment-orchestrated publicity drive clearly designed
to avert a protectionist backlash in Washington by
attempting to demonstrate Nakasone's de
termination to improve badlv strained relations
with the United States, Japan's biggest overseas
customer.
The new steps did not differ substantially from
two previous sets of measures adopted by Tokyo
over the past 12 months and thev appeared des
tined to meet the same chillv response from U.S.
officials who have been pressing Japan to take
more dramatic action.
U.S. may curb Chinese imports
Peking — Just three weeks before Secretary of
State George Shultz's scheduledgood will visit
here, sensitive Sino-American textile talks broke
down yesterday with China blaming the U.S. side
for "lacking sincerity."
Unless the Reagan administration retreats from
earlier threats, Washington will act tomorrow to
unilaterally curb certain Chinese textile imports —
a move Peking has hinted could ignite a bitter trade
war between the two nations.
"Should the U.S. side obstinately impose unilat
eral controls, the Chinese side will have to respond
strongly," warned China's chief textile negotiator,
Li Dengshan, whose remarks were carried last
night bv the official news agency.
U.S. textile negotiator Peter Murphy, who

U.S. may curb Chinese imports
Peking — Just three weeks before Secretary of
State George Shultz's scheduledgood will visit
here, sensitive Sino-American textile talks broke
down yesterday with China blaming the U.S. side
for "lacking sincerity."
Unless the Reagan administration retreats from
earlier threats, Washington will act tomorrow to
unilaterally curb certain Chinese textile imports —
a move Peking has hinted could ignite a bitter trade
war between the two nations.
"Should the U.S. side obstinately impose unilat
eral controls, the Chinese side will have to respond
strongly," warned China's chief textile negotiator,
Li Dengshan, whose remarks were carried last
night bv the official news agency.
U.S. textile negotiator Peter Murphy, who
headed the American team here during the week
long, last-ditch talks, was unavailable for comment
last night. He is scheduled to hold a news con
ference today before returning to Washington.
U.S. diplomats here had hoped to sweep away
the nagging trade dispute before Shultz's Feb. 2 ar
rival so he could focus on the larger strategic issues
of common concern and restore lost momentum in
Sino-American relations.
At issue is a new agreement for limiting the types
and amounts of products that China's rapidly ex
panding textile industry can export to the United
States. The previous pact expired Dec. 31, but
Washington agreed to extend it until tomorrow to
allow for a final round of negotiations.

Vogel: Soviets willing to reduce warheads
Bonn, West Germany — West Germany's opposition candidate for chan
cellor, Hans Jochen Vogel, said yesterday that the Soviet Union was pre
pared to negotiate on the number of warheads not just the number of in
termediate-range missiles in Europe.
Reporting on talks with Soviet leader Yuri Andropov in Moscow this
week. Vogel told a press conference that the Soviets were willing to destroy
some of their missiles aimed at Western Europe — a position he had alluded
to earlier this week — and to seek a balance in the number of warheads, not
just missiles, deploved bv both sides.
U.S. diplomats said the change could be significant because it would mean
that Moscow was "moving in the right direction of measuring actual bal
ances and not just missiles" and thus accepting Washington's view on the
key matter of arms control criteria. Western nations have reported making
diplomatic efforts in Moscow to seek further details of the announced Soviet
initiatives, including those for the Euromissile talks in Geneva.
The primary Soviet weapon aimed at Western Europe, the SS-20, contains
three warheads, while the U.S. missiles scheduled for deployment in Western
Europe later this year are to be armed with only one warhead apiece.
Until now, the Soviets have indicated willingness to reduce the number of
SS-20s to match the total of British and French intermediate missiles. Not all
of the 162 British-French missiles have multiple warheads, so the Soviet al
lusion to a balance of warheads could mean a new flexibility — perhaps in
cluding acceptance of some U.S. Pershing II and cruise missiles in Europe as
now planned by NATO. The public Soviet position has been to oppose that
deployment absolutely.
During 24 hours of talks with the new Soviet
leader, Social Democrat Vogel said, Andropov
told him the Soviets were prepared not only to
scrap some of their missiles but also remove others
to points so far east that they could not strike West
Germany or other West European countries.
Shultz denies disarray
Washington — Secretary of State George Shultz
denied yesterday any administration disarray over
how to negotiate with the Soviets and moved to
strengthen his grip on the U.S. Arms Control and
Disarmament Agency (ACDA) after President
Reagan fired Director Eugene Rostow.
"We have the situation firmly under control,"
Shultz said as he announced Kenneth Dam, his
deputy and former colleague at the University of
Chicago, would "provide day-to-day policy gui
dance" to the embattled nuclear arms control
agency.
Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.) didn't buy
that. "The latest changes in the arms control lead
ership of our nation reflect the continuing disarray
in the arms control policies of this adminis
tration," he said.
"The prevention of nuclear war is the fundamen
tal challenge of our time, and no president should
permit the mission and the personnel of ACDA to
become political footballs in the hands of Senate
extremists opposed to responsible arms control,"
Kennedy said.
Rostow resigned Wednesday under fire from
Reagan and and a group of conservative Re
publican senators, headed by Jesse Helms (R-
N.C.) who had already succeeded in stripping him
of two close assistants, Robert Grey, his deputy di
rector, and Norman Terrell.
Stressing that Reagan is "the boss" and that his
policy on seeking arms control agreements with the
Soviet Union would not be changed, Shultz said
Reagan also intends to play a dominant role.
Shultz took over the daily press briefing at the
State Department to get his views to reporters im
mediately after Rostow bade an emotional farewell
to agency colleagues in the Dean Acheson
auditorium.
Rostow said that after years of neglect, the agen
cy had played a major part in shaping adminis
tration policy.
But in a reference to the upheavals that led to his
resignation, Rostow said the "political and bu
reaucratic difficulties ... never quite went away and
have now been manifest anew."

Israel, Lebanon to negotiate
Kirvat Shmona, Israel — Pressure from Presi
dent Reagan broke a three-week deadlock yester
day as Israel and Lebanon agreed to negotiate si
multaneously on the withdrawal of Israeli and oth
er foreign troops from Lebanon and on future rela
tions between Israel and Lebanon.
Despite agreement on a compromise agenda giv
ing priority to neither issue, the two governments
made clear that in the negotiations each would put
its primary concern first.
Lebanese officials in Beirut said when the Israeli,
Lebanese and American negotiators get down to
business at their next meeting Monday, their dele
gation would propose a comprehensive plan for
withdrawal of all Israeli troops from Lebanon.
Israeli Defense Minister Ariel Sharon said he
was sure the negotiators "will arrive at security ar
rangements and normalization as the first stage to
peace between Israel and Lebanon."
Through four semi-weekly meetings in this
northern Israeli town and the south Beirut suburb
of Khalde, the Israelis insisted that the negotiators
first agree on normalization of relations between
the two nations, while the Lebanese demanded
priority for withdrawal of the estimated 60,000 Is
raeli, Syrian and Palestinian troops.
At the tTth meeting Monday in Khalde, both
Lebanon an<l Israel accepted special U.S. envoy
Morris Drape.'* proposal for concurrent nego

tiations on all the issues, but each demanded
changes. Agreement finally came at the sixth meet
ing after Philip Habib, Reagan's chief Middle East
envoy, arrived from Washington with word that
the president was growing impatient and wanted
an end to the deadlock.

Reagan nixes army pay hike
Washington — President Reagan did not consult
the Joint Chiefs of Staff before deciding to scrap
the 7.6 percent October pav increase for the 2.1 mil
lion men and women in uniform. Gen. Charles
(iabriel, the Air Force chief of staff, said yesterday.
Ciabriel said that he and his fellow chiefs would
be willing to trade weapons for pay raises if such a
choice has to be made, but responded, "I'm not
going to give vou a hit list," when asked what
weapons he would be willing to give up.
(iabriel, answering questions from Pentagon re
porters over breakfast, said not only had he not
been consulted about the pay freeze but also he had
not been officially informed that the president had
decided to impose it.
Later in the day the Pentagon's public affairs of
fice issued a statement apparently designed to take
the political sting out of Gabriel's remarks. It said
that Marine Corps Commandant Robert Barrow,
acting chairman of the Joint Chiefs, "stated that
the United States military establishment is ready to
respond to the president's request and do its part in
restoring economic strength to the nation."
Lt. Col. DeLorme, a deputy to Henry Catto, as
sistant secretary of defense for public affairs,
whose office issued the statement, said, "I don't
know" when asked where Barrow had made the
statement. Catto's office paraphrased what it said
were Barrow's remarks, without quoting him
directly at any point or explaining where or why he
made the remarks.
"He said that the relations between the Joint
Chiefs and the White House have never been bet
ter," the public affairs office statement said of Bar
row.

Soviets pro-Arafat peace plan
Moscow — Palestine Liberation Organization
Chairman Yasser Arafat won qualified Soviet sup
port yesterday for a Middle East settlement plan
under which a future Palestinian state would enter
into a confederation with Jordan.
The Soviet reservations were underscored in an
official communique in which Arafat's position
was said to have been met bv "an attitude of under
standing" from the Soviet leadership.
Earlier in the day, Arafat told a news conference
that Soviet leader Yuri Andropov and other of
ficials have told him that they would agree to any
thing the Palestinian people accepted.
Arafat said Moscow was "in agreement" with a
PLO plan under which an "independent Palesti
nian state would enter into a confederation with'
Jordan, and that this would be decided by a refer
endum."

Japan aids U.S. imports
Tokyo — Amid a groundswell of protectionist
sentiment on Capitol Hill, Japan yesterday an
nounced its latest round of steps to give foreign
products greater access to the market here in a bid
to smooth the wav for Prime Minister Yasuhiro
Nakasone's visit to Washington next week for
talks with President Reagan.
Adopted at a special meeting of Nakasone's key
economic ministers, the measures promised no im
mediate relief for the huge $20 billion U.S. deficit
in its trade with Japan.
Thev did, however, outline a broad strategy for
dismantling the labyrinthine customs, product
standards and testing procedures which American
businessmen complain bar them from competing

in lucrative markets here.
The new trade package came amid a govern
ment-orchestrated publicity drive clearly designed
to avert a protectionist backlash in Washington by
