Vogel: Soviets willing to reduce warheads
Bonn, West Germany — West Germany's opposition candidate for chan
cellor, Hans Jochen Vogel, said yesterday that the Soviet Union was pre
pared to negotiate on the number of warheads not just the number of in
termediate-range missiles in Europe.
Reporting on talks with Soviet leader Yuri Andropov in Moscow this
week. Vogel told a press conference that the Soviets were willing to destroy
some of their missiles aimed at Western Europe — a position he had alluded
to earlier this week — and to seek a balance in the number of warheads, not
just missiles, deploved bv both sides.
U.S. diplomats said the change could be significant because it would mean
that Moscow was "moving in the right direction of measuring actual bal
ances and not just missiles" and thus accepting Washington's view on the
key matter of arms control criteria. Western nations have reported making
diplomatic efforts in Moscow to seek further details of the announced Soviet
initiatives, including those for the Euromissile talks in Geneva.
The primary Soviet weapon aimed at Western Europe, the SS-20, contains
three warheads, while the U.S. missiles scheduled for deployment in Western
Europe later this year are to be armed with only one warhead apiece.
Until now, the Soviets have indicated willingness to reduce the number of
SS-20s to match the total of British and French intermediate missiles. Not all
of the 162 British-French missiles have multiple warheads, so the Soviet al
lusion to a balance of warheads could mean a new flexibility — perhaps in
cluding acceptance of some U.S. Pershing II and cruise missiles in Europe as
now planned by NATO. The public Soviet position has been to oppose that
deployment absolutely.
