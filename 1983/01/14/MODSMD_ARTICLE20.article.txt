## Elway, Dressel, White to compete for West squad Three Stanford players in Shrine All-Star game 
### 
It certainly will be a family af
fair Saturday afternoon in Stan
ford Stadium when many of the
country's top collegiate coaches
and senior football players
gather for the 58th annual East-
West Shrine game.
For the first time, the Elway
family will be united on the foot
ball field, as Stanford quarter
back John tlwav and his father
Jack, the head football coach at
San Jose State, will be on the
same sideline.
The two Elways have battled
during John's four years at Stan
ford in the annual Stanford-San
Jose State game each fall. How
ever, tomorrow afternoon father
Jack will coach the West squad,
to be quarterbacked by son John.
lowa's Havden Fry will coach
the East team, which features Illi
nois quarterback Tony Eason
and lowa punter Reggie Roby,
whose 49.8 yard average is the
best in NCAA history.
Other Stanford seniors who
will plav in the game are running
back Vincent White and tight end
Chris Dressel. The proceeds of
the event, with kick-off sched
uled for 12:45 p.m., will benefit
the Shriners Hospital in San
Francisco.
Elwav, runner-up in the
Heisman trophv balloting and
thought bv many to be the best
collegiate quarterback ever, fin
ished his senior season at Stan
ford with record-breaking
statistics. Elwav completed 262
of 405 passes for a 64.6 per
centage completion average and
3242 yards. He threw for 24
touchdowns, including one 51-
vard bomb.
White, a five-foot-ten dynamo,
replaced ex-Card Darrin Nelson,
now with the NFL's Minnesota
Vikings, at the halfback position
in 1982. White rushed for 494
yards on 88 carries, a 5.6 yards
per carry average,
Dressel caught 44 passes for
580 yards and two touchdowns,
averaging 13.1 yards per recep
tion.
"It's a privilege to play in the
game," Dressel said last night.
"It pulls together good ball
players for a cause."
Dressel noted the relaxed at
mosphere among the players on
both squads. "The East and West
teams are staying together (in the
same hotel)," he said. "It's dif
ferent than having a real oppo
nent."
Oregon standout defensive end
Mike Walter will also play for the
West squad.
Last year, the West prevailed
20-13 before 76,000 fans, the sec
ond largest crowd in Shrine game
historv.
