# Gymnasts in action tonight
## 
### STEVE ODELL 
The Stanford men's and wom
en's gymnastics teams will be
competing in the same place and
at the same time, but with dif
ferent purposes when they per
form in a 7:30 meet tonight at
Maples Pavilion.
The men's team will be com
peting in a triangular meet with
Cal State-Fullerton and Arizona
State, two of the best teams in the
country. The results will be
critical in determining whether
the Cardinal will make a first
ever team appearance in the
NCAA Championships at the
conclusion of the regular season.
The women, meanwhile, will
be hosting the University of Al
berta in an opportunity to get
their collective feet wet in their
first competition of the season.
For the men, their competition
will do a good deal in showing if
they will be one of the 10 teams
which qualify for the NCAAs.
Four of those teams are selected
on the basis of being the top team
in each of four regions in the
country.
The other six teams are picked
on an at-large basis. With UCLA
virtually assured of being the No.
I team in the West, Stanford
coach Sadao Hamada is hoping
to gain at at-large berth.
"ASU is very tough," said
Hamada of the Sun Devils, who
have qualified for the NCAA
tournament the last nine years.
"According to weekly statistics,
they scored 270.55 in their first
meet. I think we should be able to
go 270, so it'll be close."
Hamada stressed consistency
as the key factor in his team's per
formance because of a recent rule
change with states that all five
performers' scores in each event
will be counted in reaching a final
team score.
"Consistency will be the key,"
Hamada, now in his 11th year as
the Cardinal men's coach, said.
"We must put all the routines to
gether without making any major
mistakes, and we'll have a good
chance of beating ASU. We need
to beat them to go to the
NCAAs."
ASU is led by Donnie Hinton,
Tom Dewitt, and Bill Ryden.

Hinton was a 1982 All-America
on the floor exercise, while Dew
itt is the team's No. I all-around
performer. Ryden excels in the
high bar.
"We need to beat Fullerton
State, too," said Hamada, refer
ring to post-season possibilities.
"We beat them once already this
year, but they are another pow
erhouse."
The Cardinal defeated Full
erton State in a three-way meet
earlier this season, scoring 256
points. Berkeley was second with
255 points and Fullerton finished
with 244. The meet represented
the first time Stanford had beaten
Cal in 10 years.
Andv Pacho, ranked No. I in
the floor exercise and an All-
America on the parallel bars last
season, and Joe Rapp, who leads
the team in the parallel bars and
the vault, are Fullerton's top
gymnasts. They will be supported
by Bob Cavito, the team's best on
the pommel horse, Greg Hall, the
1982 national junior college

pommel horse champion, and
Tom Pace, Fullerton's top all
around man.
The Cardinal, which has al
ready won the 1982 Spartan In
vitational, are led bv freshmen
Jon Levy and Garv Smith. Levy
was the United States Gvm
nastics Federation Class I Cham
pion in the all-around, floor ex
ercise, rings, and parallel bars.
Smith was the 1982 Texas high
school all-around champion and
placed fifth in the all-around in
the Japan-USA meet last week
end.
Other top Card performers are
co-captains Rich Rosen, who ex
cels on the pommel horse and
parallel bars, and Brian Nelson,
whose best event is the high bar.
Junior Ed Gresser is strong in the
floor exercise and vaulting.
The women's meet against Al
berta will be the first for new
Cardinal coach Homer Sardina.
"The women's team is very
good to start with," said

Japan meet. Smith, who finished fifth all-around against
Japan, will help lead the Cardinal against Cal State-Full
erton and Arizona State tonight at 7:30 in Maples Pavilion.
Hamada, who coordinates both
the men's and women's pro
grams. "Nobody reallv stands
out, but we have great depth with
several outstanding all-around
performers."
Hamada said he thought that
the meet against Alberta would
be good testing ground for the
women's team. "Thev (Alberta)
are one of the top college gym
nastics teams in Canada," said
Hamada of the team which was
the Canadian Intercollegiate
Athletic Union team champion
in 1978 and 1979. "Canada is
starting to get very strong in its
gymnastics. As far as we're con
cerned, we need to show good
consistency and I think we'll be
OK. I think we have a great
chance to qualify for the NCAAs
this year."
Alberta is led by Elis Workin,
the 1982 CIAU floor exercise
champion, Heidi Ross, sixth in
the all-around at the CIAU
championships, and Kathy
Steven, a veteran performer who
was a member of both cham
pionship teams.
Stanford, the 1982 NorCal
conference champion, will be
hurt bv the loss of its No. 1 wom
en's gymnast, Merilyn Chapman,
who decided not to compete this
season because of personal rea
sons. Chapman represented the
Cardinal at nationals last season.
Stanford will be competing in
the West Coast Athletic Associa
tion, generally regarded as a
stronger conference than the
NorCal in 1983. A further blow
was dealt to this year's team
when sophomore Carolyn Tark
ington went down with an elbow
injury on Wednesday, putting
her out of action for the season.
There has been a rule change
on the women's side also, stipu
lating that of six gymnasts com
peting for each team in every
event, the top five scores rather
than four as in years past, will be
recorded.
Hamada said this will work to
Stanford's advantage. "The rule
is in favor of our program be
cause we have so many good all
around performers," he said.
In the absence of Chapman,
Stanford's top gymnasts are co
captains Julie Bledsoe and Angie
Barnes.
The Cardinal will also rely
heavily on the performances of
senior Kim Strauss, who is strong
on the uneven parallel bars, and
freshman Pam Blom, whose best
events are the floor exercise and
vaulting.

earlier this season, scoring 256
points. Berkeley was second with
255 points and Fullerton finished
with 244. The meet represented
the first time Stanford had beaten
Cal in 10 years.
Andv Pacho, ranked No. I in
the floor exercise and an All-
America on the parallel bars last
season, and Joe Rapp, who leads
the team in the parallel bars and
the vault, are Fullerton's top
gymnasts. They will be supported
by Bob Cavito, the team's best on
the pommel horse, Greg Hall, the
1982 national junior college

pommel horse champion, and
Tom Pace, Fullerton's top all
around man.
The Cardinal, which has al
ready won the 1982 Spartan In
vitational, are led bv freshmen
Jon Levy and Garv Smith. Levy
was the United States Gvm
nastics Federation Class I Cham
pion in the all-around, floor ex
ercise, rings, and parallel bars.
Smith was the 1982 Texas high
school all-around champion and
placed fifth in the all-around in
the Japan-USA meet last week
end.
Other top Card performers are
co-captains Rich Rosen, who ex
cels on the pommel horse and
parallel bars, and Brian Nelson,
whose best event is the high bar.
Junior Ed Gresser is strong in the
floor exercise and vaulting.
The women's meet against Al
berta will be the first for new
Cardinal coach Homer Sardina.
"The women's team is very
good to start with," said

Hamada, who coordinates both
the men's and women's pro
grams. "Nobody reallv stands
out, but we have great depth with
several outstanding all-around
performers."
Hamada said he thought that
the meet against Alberta would
be good testing ground for the
women's team. "Thev (Alberta)
are one of the top college gym
nastics teams in Canada," said
Hamada of the team which was
the Canadian Intercollegiate
Athletic Union team champion
in 1978 and 1979. "Canada is
starting to get very strong in its
gymnastics. As far as we're con
cerned, we need to show good
consistency and I think we'll be
OK. I think we have a great
chance to qualify for the NCAAs
this year."
Alberta is led by Elis Workin,
the 1982 CIAU floor exercise
champion, Heidi Ross, sixth in
the all-around at the CIAU
championships, and Kathy
Steven, a veteran performer who
was a member of both cham
pionship teams.
Stanford, the 1982 NorCal
conference champion, will be
hurt bv the loss of its No. 1 wom
en's gymnast, Merilyn Chapman,
who decided not to compete this
season because of personal rea
sons. Chapman represented the
Cardinal at nationals last season.
Stanford will be competing in
the West Coast Athletic Associa
tion, generally regarded as a
stronger conference than the
NorCal in 1983. A further blow
was dealt to this year's team
when sophomore Carolyn Tark
ington went down with an elbow
injury on Wednesday, putting
her out of action for the season.
There has been a rule change
on the women's side also, stipu
lating that of six gymnasts com
peting for each team in every
event, the top five scores rather
than four as in years past, will be
recorded.
Hamada said this will work to
Stanford's advantage. "The rule
is in favor of our program be
cause we have so many good all
around performers," he said.
In the absence of Chapman,
Stanford's top gymnasts are co
captains Julie Bledsoe and Angie
Barnes.
The Cardinal will also rely
heavily on the performances of
senior Kim Strauss, who is strong
on the uneven parallel bars, and
freshman Pam Blom, whose best
events are the floor exercise and
vaulting.

SWINGING INTO ACTION: Stanford gymnast Julie Bledsoe and her teammates will be in ac
tion for the first time in 1983 tonight in a dual meet against the University of Alberta. The meet
starts at 7:30 p.m. at Maples Pavilion.
The Stanford men's and wom
en's gymnastics teams will be
competing in the same place and
at the same time, but with dif
ferent purposes when they per
form in a 7:30 meet tonight at
Maples Pavilion.
The men's team will be com
peting in a triangular meet with
Cal State-Fullerton and Arizona
State, two of the best teams in the
country. The results will be
critical in determining whether
the Cardinal will make a first
ever team appearance in the
NCAA Championships at the
conclusion of the regular season.
The women, meanwhile, will
be hosting the University of Al
berta in an opportunity to get
their collective feet wet in their
first competition of the season.
For the men, their competition
will do a good deal in showing if
they will be one of the 10 teams
which qualify for the NCAAs.
Four of those teams are selected
on the basis of being the top team
in each of four regions in the
country.
The other six teams are picked
on an at-large basis. With UCLA
virtually assured of being the No.
I team in the West, Stanford
coach Sadao Hamada is hoping
to gain at at-large berth.
"ASU is very tough," said
Hamada of the Sun Devils, who
have qualified for the NCAA
tournament the last nine years.
"According to weekly statistics,
they scored 270.55 in their first
meet. I think we should be able to
go 270, so it'll be close."
Hamada stressed consistency
as the key factor in his team's per
formance because of a recent rule
change with states that all five
performers' scores in each event
will be counted in reaching a final
team score.
"Consistency will be the key,"
Hamada, now in his 11th year as
the Cardinal men's coach, said.
"We must put all the routines to
gether without making any major
mistakes, and we'll have a good
chance of beating ASU. We need
to beat them to go to the
NCAAs."
ASU is led by Donnie Hinton,
Tom Dewitt, and Bill Ryden.

Hinton was a 1982 All-America
on the floor exercise, while Dew
itt is the team's No. I all-around
performer. Ryden excels in the
high bar.
"We need to beat Fullerton
State, too," said Hamada, refer
ring to post-season possibilities.
"We beat them once already this
year, but they are another pow
erhouse."

erton State in a three-way meet
