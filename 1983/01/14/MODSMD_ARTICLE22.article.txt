# Linzmeier leads Card into weekend meets
## 
### SHAILENDRA BHUMRALKAR 
The Stanford women's swim
team finished second in the
NCAA Championships last year,
yet boasts of a new and much
improved attitude.
Coach George Haines insti
tuted a change in the weight
training program so that
everyone is lifting weights. This
prompted him to say, "The team
looks great physically." It also
caused a team member to give
him a notepad bearing the head
ing, "No More Mr. Nice Guy!"
The Cardinal will face Long
Beach State today and Southern
Illinois tomorrow at deGuerre
Pool.
The team, which graduated
only one swimmer, is led by
Marybeth Linzrneier, who won
three individual races at last
year's NCAA Championships.
Kim Carlisle will also be a major
contributor. Haines said, "She is
swimming much better than a
year ago." Sherri Hanna will
provide important support, as

will Anne Tweedy. Haines said
of Kelly Asplund, "She is way
ahead of what she did last year."
The bumper crop of freshmen
includes Patty Gavin, Libby
Kink cad. Kathy Smith and
Diana Zock. Haines said that the
new recruits "will fill the voids
and should help a great deal."
Haines said that each swim

mer knows "if everyone does
their job, they have as good a
chance to win as anyone else."
He added that everyone must
stay healthy and the team must
shore up its weak points.
"I really think we're going to
do well," Haines said.
The NCAA Championships
will include new top teams, like

AIAW champ Texas, since the
AIAW no longer exists. But
Haines indicated. "With our
completely different attitude
plus our freshmen, we're going
to he competitive."
Haines explained this attitude
and said the team has some sta
bility after experiencing four
coaching changes in four years
before he arrived last year.
