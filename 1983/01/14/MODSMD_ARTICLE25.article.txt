### Associated Press 
New York — Record-shatter
ing Marv Decker Tabb, the best
woman's distance runner in
American history, was named
winner of The Associated Press'
Female Athlete of the Year
Award for 1982 yesterday.
The 24-year-old Tabb, the
first track and field athlete to win
the honor since Chi Cheng in
1970, received 29 votes in the an
nual balloting by sports writers
and broadcasters.
Tennis player Martina
Navratilova finished second with
21 votes and golfer Jo Anne
Carner was third with 9. The
1981 winner, tennis player Tracy
Austin, failed to receive one vote.
The AP's 1982 Male Athlete of
the Year was Wayne Gretzky of
the Edmonton Oilers.
"Wow!" the surprised Tabb
exclaimed after learning of the
award. "That's great. It's a great
honor. I like for people to know
what I'm doing.
"It also means that people are
beginning to recognize women's
track and field athletes. Since I've
been running (since she was 11
years old), it doesn't seem we
have been recognized as we
should."
It was hard to ignore Tabb in
1982.
Indoors, she shattered the
world best in the mile three times,
lowering it the last time to 4
minutes, 20.5 seconds, and re
duced the world bests in the 2000
meters to 5:53.4 and the 3000 to
8:47.3.
Outdoors, she was just as im
pressive, before an injured left
Achilles' tendon prematurely
ended her season in August.
Prior to the injury, she cracked
world records in the mile
(4:18.08, later reduced to 4:17.44
bv Romania's Maricica Puica),
5000 meters (15:08.26) and
10,000 meters (31.35.3), and set
an American record for 3000
meters (8:29.71, the second
fastest clocking in history).
At the end of the outdoor sea
son, she was ranked No.l in the
United States in the 800, the
1500, the 3000, the 5000 and the
10,000, and No.l in the world in
the latter two events. Indoors and
outdoors, she competed in 14
races — and won them all, vir
tually every one by an over
whelming margin.
No American woman's dis

tance runner ever has been so
dominant.
Her only comparatively close
race was an 800 at Lausanne,
Switzerland. "There also was a
5000 in Eugene (Ore. June 5). but
actually I pulled awav when I
wanted," she recalled about her
victory over Britain's Paula
Fudge, ranked No. I in the world

in 1981.
She considers her best race of
the vear the 3000 at Oslo, Nor
way, July 7, when she set the U.S.
record.
Navratilova, meanwhile, dom
inated women's tennis in 1982.
She won 90 of 93 matches, includ
ing the Wimbledon.
