The Cardinal men's and wom
en's fencing teams head south
tomorrow to take on Long Beach
State and Cal State Fullerton in
the Forty-niner's home gym.
The Long Beach men have
posted seven straight victories
and lead their conference. The
Forty-niner women are not far
off the pace with a 5-2 mark and
are currently second in the con
ference.
Cal State-Fullerton's men's
team is No. 3 in the conference
while the Lady Titans are No. 4.
"Although our women have
fenced fewer meets," fencing
coach Buzz Hurst said, "I think
they are much stronger than

either Long Beach or Fullerton
and I look for a victory. The Ful
lerton men were decimated by
graduation last year and
shouldn't give us too much trou
ble, but Long Beach could be
another story. They're a team
that has always managed to get
themselves 'psyched-up' for big
meets, and we're going to be in
their home gym."
Saturday marks the first time
that Cardinal and Forty-niner
fencers have met in dual-meet
competition. Stanford fencers to
watch for should be Jennifer Yu
in women's foil, Nik Blevins and
Harvey Cain in cpee, Howard
Cash in sabre and Elliott Cheu in
men's foil.
