## The 						old restaurant gets a face lift ... and a few new wrinkles 
### JOHN REDDER 
THE GOLDEN SPIKE
700 Welch Road
Palo Alto

Have you ever bumped into an
old friend who had really
| changed in appearance? Right
-•away you start comparing the
: person before you with the
image preserved of all the good
things that you liked about that
" friend. If the Golden Spike used
' to be that old friend who you
i" have not visited in a while, a re
turn trip will greet you with a
new face. With restaurants as
with people, it takes more than a
face lift to change the personality
. of an acquaintance. The Golden
Spike not only transformed its
visual character but it now boasts
, a new dining experience as well.
If the Golden Spike you re
member was a crowded evening
watering hole where you could
catch a burger and the music of
Murphy's Lawyers or the
Druids, well, you will be sur
prised to know it has been trans
formed to a rather quiet restau
rant. Yes, they do still have occa
sional bands, but their frequency
' and quality are still unpredicta
ble. How successful this change
in tempo has been is hard to as
sess since their new image is yet
' unknown to many and our re
view missed the potential crowds
of the weekends. One cannot ex
pect to find the same casual pa
trons of the old Spike frequent

ing this new place and only time
will tell what kind of crowd, or
lack of, the new Spike will draw.
If you desire an exceptionally
quiet atmosphere we would rec
ommend dining on a Sunday
evening. Sunday evenings are a
new occurrence at the Spike
since they just extended their
hours to include all of Sunday
except from 3 to 5 p.m. From
what we have heard, evenings
are typically slower than lunches,
which is understandable consid
ering that there are only two
good restaurants in the Stanford
Mall and Mama's tends to cater
to women's club socials and
business people's lunches
charged on the company ac-,
count.
Nevertheless, there is both a
lunch and dinner menu indicat
ing that the new Spike is serious
about becoming a dinner restau
rant and not just a snack bar.
That evening we were seated
immediately and there was no
worry about anyone overhearing
our conversation as the other
two seated tables were well
spaced out. One of the first
things to catch one's eye in the
rustic locomotive setting is the
train which makes the rounds of
the restaurant every few min
utes. If you are still a kid at heart
(like one of us) you might even
send messages across the room
by way of the empty flatcar.
Maybe this was their way of
amusing us when the service was

not as prompt as it should have
been. The restaurant is also
stocked with Stanford
memorabilia — a true scrapbook
for any Leland Stanford, Jr.
aficionado.
Enough about the pre
liminaries — let's talk about

Although we do not
want to repeat our
particular dining
experience at the
Spike there are
many other
promising
possibilities to
choose from. It
should be kept in
mind that the Spike
is trying out a lot of
new things and some
growing pains are to
be expected.

food. For a cocktail the Spike of
fers a nice selection of mixed
fruit drinks (Strawberry Mar
garitas, fruit daiquiris and col
adas along with other exotics)
and a fair assortment of specialty
beers (Guiness, Bass, Heinekin,
Becks etc.) along with some
good drafts (Henry's, Bavarian

Dark etc.). The wine list is curi
ous if not brief although some of
the most pleasant surprises are
found in overlooked labels. The
liquor prices were quite reason
able, in line with the overall cost
of the restaurant.
Lunch prices also seem to be
very reasonable, with the excep
tion of Shrimp Louie at $7.25, no
single item is over $5.50. Infla
tion does strike as the dinner bell
tolls with price increases on the
same items sported on both the
lunch and dinner menu. (The fet
tucini mysteriously becomes $2
better). It is also a good idea to
overlook the apparent values in
the way of children's servings
because almost all will save you
15 to 20 cents for a reduced por
tion — not much of a deal.
At the Golden Spike a wide
selection of culinary experiences
is available. From the dinner
menu you may ch6bse from eight
appetizers, two soups, seven
salads, five entrees, eight
sandwiches and eight variations
of the burger, not to mention a
daily quiche. We opted not to
purchase the French Bread.
(How could we resist for $ 1.50?)
Remembering a past experience,
one of us hesitantly ordered the
potato skins ($4.25) and the
other some deep fried zucchini
($3.25) for an appetizer. The
skins turned out to be an im
provement from the old Spike's
solid slices as these were hal
lowed out potato shells covered

with a cheese spred, cream
cheese and bacon bits. We still
reserve praise; both of us have
enjoyed better tasting and man
ner of preparation at other res
taurants in the Stanford area.
More regretfully, the fried zuc
chini did not fair as well as its
potato counterpart. Although
the breading was light and crispy,
the vegetable itself was over
cooked and rather tasteless. A
very tasty dill sauce was included
and was almost successful in
overcoming the disappointment
of the zucchini. We are sorry to
say that somewhere in the
kitchen my salad was lost, but
their selection includes: Spinach
and Mushroom ($5.25), Taco
($5.75), Shrimp Louie ($7.25)
and others to appease a lover of
greens; however, even their
well-stocked dinner salad is ex
pensive as far as dinner salads go
— $3.25.
Since both of our critical tum
mies were already getting full
from the generous appetizer
servings we opted for a sandwich
and burger rather than a main
entree. In all honesty, this deci
sion limited us in regard to re
viewing the new image of the

Spike, but we believe many more
Stanford students are willing to
drop five bucks for a good
sandwich than a 10 for a steak. If
you are out for a more expensive
culinary experience the Spike's
entree section allows for a choice
between a number of prime beef
cuts, 880 ribs, chicken and even
feteccini alfredo. A bit of advice,
though; if you order a beef selec
tion, whether it be entree or
burger, unless you like your meat
well done tell the waiter specif
ically how you like it to be done.
Our major criticism of both our
meals was the overdone beef.
But the servings we received at
the Spike could fill the heartiest
of appetites. The French Dip Su
preme ($5.25) was a large
sandwich full of thinly sliced
roast with a nice addition of bell
peppers, mushrooms, onions and
jack cheese.
Similar to the French dip, the
Mexican burger ($4.95) was well
prepared (except for the zeal
ously cooked beef). Bacon,
guacamole, chedder cheese and
tomato on a toasted French bun
make for an abundant meal dif
ficult to bite into. Included with

both meal prices were mounds of
delicious ranch-cut fries and an
orange slice masquerading as a
"fresh fruit wedge."
The meal finished with a
mixed blessing. We ordered cafe
mocha ($1.45) and cappucino
($1.25) along with a slice of car
rot cake. The chocolate
enriched coffee was quite good
but the weak espresso topped
with sparse amounts of steamed
milk fell far short of this area's
better versions. Disagreement
arose over the carrot cake as one
described it as slightly "over
moist" while the more expert
deemed it "water-sogged."
Although we do not want to
repeat our particular dining ex
perience at the Spike there are
many other promising pos
sibilities to choose from. It
should be kept in mind that the
Spike is trying out a lot of new
things and some growing pains
arc to be expected. What still
looks inviting is the new entree
selections and the whole
luncheon experience with its
wide variety of salads, cold
sandwiches and quiche.
