Orson Welles once told me "Beware of any place with a blue
plate special or an offer for'all you can eat'." I have tried to live
out my life without breaking the leviathan director's faith in
me, but I'm afraid I was treading very close to the edge of the
line when I took dinner at Pasquinelli's Farmhouse, home of
the $5 dinner special.
The restaurant sits on the edge of route 101 in Redwood
City — there's another anecdote like the first involving Warren
Beatty and restaurants near major roads, but I think the point
has been made — and a large lit sign aids in pointing out the
huge yellow building.
The place is, indeed, very big, and it shares property with an
equally huge parking lot, which was full when we arrived early
in the evening. In addition, the road leading up was clogged
with parked cars, leading rhe to believfcthat the place
somewhat popular.
Upon our entrance (reservations are not taken for parties
smaller than eight) we left our name and were shuttled to the
bar. We spent about 15 minutes in the bar before our table for
two was ready, and a slightly longer wait was required for
larger parties.
The bar was quite nice, perhaps a bit drafty due to its large
size and proximity to the door. Formidable wooden tables and
chairs, popcorn, unobtrusive cocktail video games and scat
tered "period" wall hangings made for a comfortable atmos
phere, a fake fireplace being the only discordant effect.
We were led to our table by a waitress through a thin cor
ridor of tables and chairs. The Farmhouse does not have a
spacious dining area. However, despite the lack of "wasted"
space, the tables themselves were not uncomfortably
crammed.
Upon the checkerboard tablecloth lay the menu, printed
upon an equally checkerboard placemat. This is the unique
feature of Pasquinelli's Farmhouse — everything is included
with the dinner, giving you only the choice of some 14 entrees.
Ranging from the $5 chicken cacchiatore special to a $9.95
filet mignon, the price on the menu aside from whatever you
would have to drink — I took note of the three house wines
they had there; the famous "red," "white" and "rose," which
came in "small" and "large" — would be the price you would
have to pay.

This is the principal attraction of Pasquinelli's Farmhouse. It
is neither gifted with any variety of exotic foods nor an elegant,
intimate dining area, but it is a clean, fairly attractive place to
eat "American" food at a reasonable price.
The people there reflected this. There were a lot of families
and older people having a "family night out" and very few
young couples with stars in their eyes. That is not a criticism,
but a statement of fact — this is not a place to go on a date, this
is a place to go to eat.
We ordered the prawns and prime rib ($8.95) and the
($4.95) half chicken. With the dinner came some very excel
lent bread, piping hot and not bearing any of the signs of being
heated in a microwave. We were also given Minestrone soup,
which came in an impressive caldron, and when one of the
party passed on ordering a salad — which was mostly lettuce
and broccoli — we were offered extra soup to make up for it.
The entrees arrived soon after — the service throughout the
meal, despite the crowd at the restaurant, was surprisingly
prompt — and fit in very nicely with the "American" spirit of
the restaurant. The prawns were not under- or outer-cooked,
'and the prime rib vfas a nice, tender cut, cooked to a satisfying
medium rare. Included on the plate was an odd assortment of
vegetables and a baked potato that was depressingly mealy.
The chicken was, anatomically, at least, half of a chicken, but
it did not live up to one's ideal of a chicken half. Reminiscent of
food service, the chicken breast was undersized and thin, and
the legs and wing were a debit proposition as far as eating was
concerned. It would be a good idea if they were to boost both
the price and the size of their chicken. With the chicken were
the same motly group of vegetables and some linguine, which
was surprisingly good.
After the dinner we were given a small dish of chocolate chip
ice cream, which was again included with the dinner. It was fine
ice cream, but it seemed to throw the whole deal back in our
faces — a chain restaurant such as this is treading a mighty fine
line even when specializing in such "universal" fare as meat,
potatoes and chocolate chip ice cream when you cannot even
choose your own flavor of ice cream.
So ends Pasquinelli's evening of dining, an unspec
tacular but sufficient meal, a check of $16, and the oddest
feeling of being forced to dine out against your will. I would not
recommend this place as somewhere to take a date, but if you
have a group looking for just a meal in a night out, Pasquinelli's
would not be a bad choice. If you're looking for a known
quantity, that is what you're paying for here.

phere, a fake fireplace being the only discordant effect.
We were led to our table by a waitress through a thin cor
ridor of tables and chairs. The Farmhouse does not have a
spacious dining area. However, despite the lack of "wasted"
space, the tables themselves were not uncomfortably
crammed.
Upon the checkerboard tablecloth lay the menu, printed
upon an equally checkerboard placemat. This is the unique
feature of Pasquinelli's Farmhouse — everything is included
with the dinner, giving you only the choice of some 14 entrees.
Ranging from the $5 chicken cacchiatore special to a $9.95
filet mignon, the price on the menu aside from whatever you
would have to drink — I took note of the three house wines
they had there; the famous "red," "white" and "rose," which
came in "small" and "large" — would be the price you would
have to pay.

This is the principal attraction of Pasquinelli's Farmhouse. It
is neither gifted with any variety of exotic foods nor an elegant,
intimate dining area, but it is a clean, fairly attractive place to
eat "American" food at a reasonable price.
The people there reflected this. There were a lot of families
and older people having a "family night out" and very few
young couples with stars in their eyes. That is not a criticism,
but a statement of fact — this is not a place to go on a date, this
is a place to go to eat.
We ordered the prawns and prime rib ($8.95) and the
($4.95) half chicken. With the dinner came some very excel
lent bread, piping hot and not bearing any of the signs of being
heated in a microwave. We were also given Minestrone soup,
which came in an impressive caldron, and when one of the
party passed on ordering a salad — which was mostly lettuce
and broccoli — we were offered extra soup to make up for it.
The entrees arrived soon after — the service throughout the
meal, despite the crowd at the restaurant, was surprisingly
prompt — and fit in very nicely with the "American" spirit of
the restaurant. The prawns were not under- or outer-cooked,
'and the prime rib vfas a nice, tender cut, cooked to a satisfying
medium rare. Included on the plate was an odd assortment of
vegetables and a baked potato that was depressingly mealy.
The chicken was, anatomically, at least, half of a chicken, but
it did not live up to one's ideal of a chicken half. Reminiscent of
food service, the chicken breast was undersized and thin, and
the legs and wing were a debit proposition as far as eating was
concerned. It would be a good idea if they were to boost both
the price and the size of their chicken. With the chicken were
the same motly group of vegetables and some linguine, which
was surprisingly good.
After the dinner we were given a small dish of chocolate chip
ice cream, which was again included with the dinner. It was fine
ice cream, but it seemed to throw the whole deal back in our
faces — a chain restaurant such as this is treading a mighty fine
line even when specializing in such "universal" fare as meat,
potatoes and chocolate chip ice cream when you cannot even
choose your own flavor of ice cream.
So ends Pasquinelli's evening of dining, an unspec
tacular but sufficient meal, a check of $16, and the oddest
feeling of being forced to dine out against your will. I would not
recommend this place as somewhere to take a date, but if you
have a group looking for just a meal in a night out, Pasquinelli's
would not be a bad choice. If you're looking for a known
quantity, that is what you're paying for here.
PASQUINELLI'S FARMHOUSE
386 Convention Way

Orson Welles once told me "Beware of any place with a blue
plate special or an offer for'all you can eat'." I have tried to live
out my life without breaking the leviathan director's faith in
me, but I'm afraid I was treading very close to the edge of the
line when I took dinner at Pasquinelli's Farmhouse, home of
the $5 dinner special.
The restaurant sits on the edge of route 101 in Redwood
City — there's another anecdote like the first involving Warren
Beatty and restaurants near major roads, but I think the point
has been made — and a large lit sign aids in pointing out the
huge yellow building.
The place is, indeed, very big, and it shares property with an
equally huge parking lot, which was full when we arrived early
in the evening. In addition, the road leading up was clogged
with parked cars, leading rhe to believfcthat the place
somewhat popular.
Upon our entrance (reservations are not taken for parties
smaller than eight) we left our name and were shuttled to the
bar. We spent about 15 minutes in the bar before our table for
two was ready, and a slightly longer wait was required for
larger parties.
The bar was quite nice, perhaps a bit drafty due to its large
size and proximity to the door. Formidable wooden tables and
chairs, popcorn, unobtrusive cocktail video games and scat
tered "period" wall hangings made for a comfortable atmos
phere, a fake fireplace being the only discordant effect.
