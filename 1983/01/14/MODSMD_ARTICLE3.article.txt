### LISA LYNCH Staff writer 
Human rights violations in Cent
ral America came under fire last
night in a campus symposium,which
was primarily an attack on con
tinued U.S. financial and military
aid in I I Salvador.

Three panelists were cho
sen to discuss the human rights issue
in Central America: Armado Oliva,
public affairs director of Christian
Legal Aid; Melvyn Levitsky, deputy
assistant secretary of state; and
Father Robert Drinan, law profes
sor at Georgetown University.
Robert Wesson, a senior research
fellow at the Hoover Institution,
and Patricia Weiss Fagen, a history
professor at San Jose State Univer
sity, gave brief commentaries on the
panelists' speeches. The Kresge
Auditorium symposium was mod
erated by History Prof. John Wirth.
Oliva commented mostly on the
situation in El Salvador. "It is very
hard to synthesize all that has hap
pened or is happening in El Sal
vador," he said, "but it is apparent
that the government has used force
to repress the people." He gave spe
cific incidents of human rights viola
tions, and described a decree passed
in December 1980 that legitimized
torture of political prisoners and
denied them right of defense.
Oliva also cited the approximate
tolls for political assassinations in
the past two years. In 1981 approx
imately 11,727 political deaths were
reported, but in 1982 the number
decreased to 5967, he said.
"This may lead some people to
the false conclusion that human
rights conditions have improved,"
Oliva said. He explained that al
though deaths have decreased, the
problem is "still very great" and
could not be helped by U.S. political
intervention.
Levitsky, taking the official U.S.

government position on American
involvement in Central America,
outlined what he termed a "positive
policy" of fostering democracy in
Central America.
"We believe democracy is the
way to end human rights abuses,"
SS """■ :
cide on a peaceful, democratic forir
of government.'
He claimed that the government
devoted a great deal of attention to
human rights implementation.
"Whenever possible, we use 'quiet
diplomacy,' " Levitsky explained,
"and if that fails, we use public di
plomacy and condemnation."
Levitsky said that he felt there
was no incompatibility between
human rights policies in Central
America and the success of U.S.
political and economic systems.
"In El Salvador," he explained,
"we have supported the building of
a democracy, but we do not ignore
the problems — they are still there.
Through our efforts, we have seen a
decrease in violence and we have
seen a free election." U.S. support
of El Salvador would continue, he
claimed, as long as the government
continued its policy of land reform,
defense of human rights, and devel
opment of the electoral system and
the democratic political process.
" We attempt to help political and
economic freedom thrive in Central
America, and we can do this by
lending materials and the necessary
support," Levitsky explained.
Drinan, a former U.S. con
gressman, vigorously attacked U.S.
intervention in El Salvador. "We
have intervened in a mass cultural
conflict," Drinan said. "This is a war
that is profound revolution and our
country has intervened on the
wrong side of history."
Drinan called the El Salvador situa
tion "Reagan's War," asserting that
when Reagan entered office he fired
the U.S. ambassador to El Salvador
"because (the ambassador) didn't want
to fight a war. This administration is
ashamed of what it has done there,"
Drinan said.
Drinan supported Oliva in saying
that the decrease in the death toll does
not mean improvement in human
rights. "The people are subdued,
they're afraid, he said. "Besides,
there's only so many people you can

kill."
"The concession in this room is that
things are not all right in El Salvador,"
asserted Fagen during her commen
tary.
Fagen cited the example of an offi
cial who had the dual duties of support
ing human rights and working for the
national police. "Governments are
specifically charged to protect their
civilians," Fagen said, "not to murder
the civilians."
Scheduled two weeks before the ex
pected certification by President Re
agan of human rights improvements in
El Salvador, the symposium was origi
nally conceived by SCAAN (Stanford
Central American Action Network).
