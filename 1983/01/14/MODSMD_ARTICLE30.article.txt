Mac Arthur Park. Everyone
knows the name. But, it's one of
those places that's so convenient
that you might pass it by the next
time you think about going out.
Well think again. Passing this
restaurant up would definitely be
a mistake.
Not being able to find a car to
use, we walked over to the res
taurant and up to the door past
the suspicious eyes of the valet
parkers. (No tip tonight, guys.)
As we entered we were deluged
with white — white tablecloths,
white napkins, a white ceiling
and white waiters' uniforms.
Along with the touches of brass
and assorted colors, the overall
effect was polished and confi
dent .
We were promptly escorted
away from the large main dining
room to a smaller room with only
five tables. The atmosphere was
quiet and relaxed — it felt as if I
was dining in my own home. Our
experience, then, was quite
different than what the rest of
you may have or will experience
at Mac Arthur Park. When we
left our room at the end of the
meal, we noticed the vast
difference between our peaceful
room and the constant clanging
of dishes and loud buzz of con
versation (complete with a tal
ented piano player in the back
ground) which occupied the
main dining room.

Our meal began with a heap
ing (we're talking/mg?) order of
potato skins ($2.50). They were
unusual in that they were simply
seasoned and served with sour
cream on the side — they weren't
smothered with bacon and
cheese like the usual fare. They
were an unexpected, but tasty
appetizer.

We next shared an order of
New England style clam chow
der ($2.50) and an Orange and
Bermuda Onion salad ($3.45).
The soup was creamy and well
seasoned, and the salad was crisp
— the oranges and onions were a
surprisingly good combination.
In between courses, we were
able to exhibit our artistic and
creative talents by drawing on
our placemats with the crayons
provided on each table. For
some reason, though, both of us
felt somewhat inhibited and un
artistic. My partner didn't draw
anything, and all I managed was
a weak version of "Kilroy was
here."
For the main course we or
dered chicken from the oakwood
smoker ($6.80) and skewered
scallops from the mesquite char
coal broiler ($9.60). The chicken
was tender and incredibly flavor
ful. Unfortunately, although
they were tasty, the scallops were
quite underdone. Both dishes
were served with nondescript
french fries. The chicken was ac
companied by some delicious
cole slaw, and as a side dish, I
ordered string beans almondine
($1.25) which were somewhat
cold and underdone.
I think our major mistake was
in not ordering what Mac Arthur
Park is famous for: ribs. How
ever, we did speak with the party
of four next to us (all of whom

ordered ribs) and they absolutely
raved about their dinners. (Now
I know what Tin ordering when I
go baek.)
Now on to the real food — de
ssert. MaeArthur Park boasts
that it bakes its own desserts, and
1 would certainly like to meet the
chef of these fabulous creations.
We ordered Turtle Pie ($3.60), a
wonderfully rich dessert mod
eled after the turtle candies,
made with nuts, chocolate and
caramel. We also sampled the
Apple Brown Betty ($2.45), a
dessert similar to deep dish apple
pie, but with a crumb crust and
whipped cream on top.
We finished our meal with
cappucino and some Bailey's
Irish Cream (a total of $5.75) —
1 think we're going to buy a bot
tle of Bailey's tomorrow!
As my partner and I prepared
for our cold walk home, we both
agreed that MaeArthur Park de
served our recommendation
wholeheartedly. The atmos
phere, price (moderate to
slightly expensive), and food all
met with our approval (although
I would suggest sticking to those
entrees from the oakwood
smoker). Our waiter, Tony, was
pleasant and prompt, and unob
trusive yet always there when we
needed him.
If you're in the mood for a fun,
casual evening out, try MaeAr
thur Park for a sampling of
what's been called "pop" food —
sort of a cross between hambur
gers and filet mignon. MaeAr
thur Park is open every day for
dinner from 5:30 to 10:30 p.m.,
for lunch Monday through Fri
day from 11:30 a.m. to 2:30
p.m., and for Sunday brunch
from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m.

If yoit re in the -
mood for a fun,
casual evening out,
try Mac Arthur Park
for a sampling of
whafs been called
"pop?' food - sort of
a cross between
hamburgers and
filet mignon.

As an added plus, if you are
tired of bookstore posters and if
you are feeling creative during
the evening, you can even take
home a placemat to decorate
your room!

MACARTHUR PARK
27 University Avenue
Palo Alio
321-9990
Mac Arthur Park. Everyone
knows the name. But, it's one of
those places that's so convenient
that you might pass it by the next
time you think about going out.
Well think again. Passing this
restaurant up would definitely be
a mistake.
Not being able to find a car to
use, we walked over to the res
taurant and up to the door past
the suspicious eyes of the valet
parkers. (No tip tonight, guys.)
As we entered we were deluged
with white — white tablecloths,
white napkins, a white ceiling
and white waiters' uniforms.
Along with the touches of brass
and assorted colors, the overall
effect was polished and confi
dent .
We were promptly escorted
away from the large main dining
room to a smaller room with only
five tables. The atmosphere was
quiet and relaxed — it felt as if I
was dining in my own home. Our
experience, then, was quite
different than what the rest of
you may have or will experience
at Mac Arthur Park. When we
left our room at the end of the
meal, we noticed the vast
difference between our peaceful
room and the constant clanging
of dishes and loud buzz of con
versation (complete with a tal
ented piano player in the back
ground) which occupied the
main dining room.

Our meal began with a heap
ing (we're talking/mg?) order of
potato skins ($2.50). They were
unusual in that they were simply
seasoned and served with sour
cream on the side — they weren't
smothered with bacon and
cheese like the usual fare. They
were an unexpected, but tasty
appetizer.

We next shared an order of
New England style clam chow
der ($2.50) and an Orange and
Bermuda Onion salad ($3.45).
The soup was creamy and well
seasoned, and the salad was crisp
— the oranges and onions were a
surprisingly good combination.
In between courses, we were
able to exhibit our artistic and
creative talents by drawing on
our placemats with the crayons
provided on each table. For
some reason, though, both of us
felt somewhat inhibited and un
artistic. My partner didn't draw
anything, and all I managed was
a weak version of "Kilroy was
here."
For the main course we or
dered chicken from the oakwood
smoker ($6.80) and skewered
scallops from the mesquite char
coal broiler ($9.60). The chicken
was tender and incredibly flavor
ful. Unfortunately, although
they were tasty, the scallops were
quite underdone. Both dishes
were served with nondescript
french fries. The chicken was ac
companied by some delicious
cole slaw, and as a side dish, I
ordered string beans almondine
($1.25) which were somewhat
cold and underdone.
I think our major mistake was
in not ordering what Mac Arthur
Park is famous for: ribs. How
ever, we did speak with the party
of four next to us (all of whom

ordered ribs) and they absolutely
raved about their dinners. (Now
I know what Tin ordering when I
go baek.)
Now on to the real food — de
ssert. MaeArthur Park boasts
that it bakes its own desserts, and
1 would certainly like to meet the
chef of these fabulous creations.
We ordered Turtle Pie ($3.60), a
wonderfully rich dessert mod
eled after the turtle candies,
made with nuts, chocolate and
caramel. We also sampled the
Apple Brown Betty ($2.45), a
dessert similar to deep dish apple
pie, but with a crumb crust and
whipped cream on top.
We finished our meal with
cappucino and some Bailey's
Irish Cream (a total of $5.75) —
1 think we're going to buy a bot
tle of Bailey's tomorrow!
As my partner and I prepared
for our cold walk home, we both
agreed that MaeArthur Park de
served our recommendation
wholeheartedly. The atmos
phere, price (moderate to
slightly expensive), and food all
met with our approval (although
I would suggest sticking to those
entrees from the oakwood
smoker). Our waiter, Tony, was
pleasant and prompt, and unob
trusive yet always there when we
needed him.

thur Park for a sampling of

gers and filet mignon. MaeAr
