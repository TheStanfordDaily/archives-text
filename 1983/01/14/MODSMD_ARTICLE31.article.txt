# Saddle up for dinner and a night on the town

### LISA SHAFFER WILLY BURKHARDT 
THE STAGECOACH RESTAURANT
3062 Woodside Road
Woodside 851-8010
If you've been out in the fields building up a hearty
appetite, you might want to saddle up your horse and
ride into town for dinner at The Stagecoach. The
Stagecoach Restaurant sits upon the oldest public trans
portation route in the Woodside Valley: the old stage
route between Redwood City and Searsville which oper
ated from 1866 to well into the 1890s.
The Stagecoach primarily caters to a family crowd.
There is something for everyone to enjoy, including a
junior menu for people 12 and under or 60 and over. We
began our meal with two delicious appetizers. The
Shrimp Cocktail ($3.75), served with a tangy cocktail
sauce, was both fresh and tasty. The Potato Skins
($2.75) were prepared just the way I like them — crispy
skins smothered in sour cream, chives and melted Ched
dar cheese.
As for the main course, you can choose from a wide
variety of entrees including seven different seafood spe
cialties, veal parmigiana ($8.95), baked ravioli ($6.95),
enchiladas, tostadas and many beef entrees. We finally

decided on the prawns and the prime rib. The Prawns
Saute Frederick ($9.95) consisted of a hefty portion of
prawns, sauteed with tomatoes, garlic, onion, and mush
rooms, and served upon a bed of tasty brown rice. It was
a delightful dish.
Unfortunately, the prime rib was a little disappoint
ing. Unlike the prawns, the serving of beef was rather

The Stagecoach is a difficult
restaurant to critique ... the food
is not very adventurous or
dynamic. They simply offer good,
down-to-earth eating.

skimpy and the quality of the meat was only fair. All of
the entrees include fresh vegetables, bread and the
choice of clam chowder or a salad bar.
Although one of us was full, we still managed to find
room for dessert. The Chocolate Nut Cheesecake
($ 1.95) is only mediocre — the first few bites are flavor
ful, but then it becomes somewhat plain. The French
Apple Pie ($1.75) is simple but delicious — a marvel

ously sweetened pie crust filled with an abundance of
apples coated in a brown sugar and cinnamon glaze.
Finally, one must not pass up the Jamocha Rum Nut Pie
— a wonderful chocolate-pecan dessert that will simply
knock your socks off!
The Stagecoach is a difficult restaurant to critique.
What is offers is exactly what it serves — a nice change
from the more common pretentious places. However,
the food is not very adventurous or dynamic. They sim
ply offer good, down-to-earth eating. The restaurant is
filled with memorabilia from the Old West which is
interesting to read if you get the chance. Unfortunately,
the atmosphere is very cluttered — there are just too
many objects suspended from the ceiling or hung on the
walls. In addition, the tables are too close together to
enjoy an intimate meal.
Thus The Stagecoach is left as somewhat of a question
mark. If you are looking for some good old fashioned
cooking, however, this just might be the place.

seven days a week.
