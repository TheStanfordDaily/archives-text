Monsieur Verdoux (1947) ★
Festival, Palo Alto
When Charlie Chaplin brought
this black comedy out after
World War 11, just about ev
erybody hated it. (Among critics,
Archer Winsten and the per
sistently perceptive James Agee
were the notable exceptions.) No
body wanted to see the beloved
Little Tramp transformed into a
deft Bluebeard who murders
wealthy women so that he can af
ford to keep his wife and child in
sulated from the brutal world, in a
garden paradise. And then for
years no one could see Verdoux,
because when Chaplin was denied
re-entrance into this country dur
ing the McCarthy years, he
withdrew the Him and would not
permit it to be shown here until
the early '70s. It is a curio, and the
first scene is bewilderingly
clumsy, but be patient: the movie
is a masterpiece, and Chaplin
turns in a breathtaking per
formance in the title role. Ver
doux despises the world and
claims that he lives only for the
hours h: spends with his family in
their garden, but he seems
bloodless when he's with them;
murder revives him. The film is
full of chilling moments that
come back to you years after
you've seen it, and it features a
great comic turn by Martha Rave
as Verdoux's nemesis. With
Isabel Elsom, Margaret Hoffman
and Marilyn Nash as the destitute
voung woman whose life he
spares.
Plays through Wednesday with
The Gold Rush.
Top Hat (1935) ★
Kresge Auditorium
Astaire and Rogers in one of
the most enchanting of all screen
musicals. To begin with, it has a
sensational score by Irving Berlin
("Top Hat, White Tie and Tails,"
"Isn't This a Lovely Day,"
"Cheek to Cheek," "No Strings,"
"The Piccolino"), two of which
songs provide pas de deux for the
stars, while one — the title tune —
is a witty number performed bv
Astaire with a male chorus whom
he mows down at the conclusion,
using his cane as a machine gun.
Dwight Taylor and Allan Scott
wrote the script, Mark Sandrich
directed, and the niftv supporting
cast features Edward Everett
Horton, Erik Rhodes, Eric Blore
and Helen Broderick (with
Lucille Ball in a walk-on).
Plays Monday evening with
Christopher Strong.

Breaking Away (1979) ★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Steve Tesich has laid his
screenplay in Bloomington, Indi
ana, where he spent his teenage
years, and the four bovs (played
by Dennis Christopher, Dennis
Quaid, Daniel Stern and Jackie
Earle Haley) who are the pro
tagonists are so intricately drawn
that by the end of the movie vou
feel you've known them all your
life. Tesich has a talent for funny,
naturalistic dialogue and for
sketching the idiosyncrasies of his
characters so that thev don't seem
eccentric: he even writes first-rate
monologues. This picture is about
the inevitable development of the
bovs in separate directions, but
Tesich and the director, Peter
Yates, whose work here is under
stated and kindly, see the state of
change as affirmative. Beautifully
acted by the boys and bv Paul
Doolev and Barbara Barrie as
Dennis Christopher's parents,
Breaking Away has a stinging
comic beauty.
Plavs tomorrow and Sunday
with Chariots of Fire.
The Front (1976)
Kresge Auditorium
A number of people associated
with this movie — among them
the writer, Walter Bernstein, the
director, Martin Ritt, and Zero
Mostel, who appears in it — sur
vived the bleak days of the Mc-
Carthy era, vet this comedy about
the blacklist, strangely enough,
lacks conviction. Woodv Allen
plavs a schlemiel who signs his
name to the teleplavs of an assort
ment of blacklisted dramatists so
that they can get their work on
TV, and in the best scenes he be
gins to enjoy his fraudulent celeb
rity status and demand that the
writers he's fronting for maintain
a high standard. It's a fairly limp
comedy most of the time, how
ever, and the presence of Woody
Allen, as funny as he is, makes us
wonder whose movie we're really
in: his performance isn't much
different from the acting he does
in his own pictures. With Andrea
Marcovicci, Michael Murphy
and Herschel Bernardi.
Plavs tonight.

It takes place in Chile during
the coup in 1973 that overthrew
Allende's Marxist government
and established a military junta,
but it seems to be set in hcll.Xos
ta-Gavras, the director, gives a
stunning demonstration of what
it is like to be in a country in a
state of siege, and in some scenes
he shows a feeling for visual
poetry that indicates Bertolucci's
influence. The screenplay (by
Costa-Gavras and Donald Stew
art, out of Thomas Hauser's
book) tells the true story of the
search for an American, Charlie
Horman, arrested in Chile in the
first davs of the take-over. But

there's a second plot, too — the
pollicitation of Horman's con
servative father (Jack Lemmon),
who comes to Chile to help his
daughter-in-law (Sissv Spacek,
giving her best performance in
years) to find Charlie — and it
nearly wrecks the movie. The
problem is not just Lemmon's aw
ful acting, but also the fact that
Horman's development has been
cut out of the cloth of 1960s gen
eration-gap cliches.
Plavs Sunday evening.
Stroszek (1977)
Haus Mitteleuropa
The first half of this curious
Werner Herzog film is a variation
on Porgy and Bess: Bruno (Bruno
S.) is a street musician who offers
shelter to Eva (Eva Mattes), a
prostitute, after her pimp lover
drives her away, but in this ver
sion it's Porgy who takes Bess to
New York — or rather, Wiscon
sin, where their landlord, Scheitz
(Clemens Scheitz), has promised
Eva a waitressing job. Bruno S.,
who made this movie after star
ring in Herzog's Mystery of
Kaspar Hauser, comes across like
a slightly drunken, slightly un
balanced hanger-on in a local bar
might — he reads his lines stilted-
Iv and doesn't focus his eves on
the people he speaks to — but he
has a peculiar charm, and plump,
overripe Eva Mattes has an ap
pealing animal sensusousness.
Once they get to America,
though, Herzog shifts gears: he
seems to want to make a movie
about the alienation of immi
grants, but he's chosen characters
who are so remote from the main
stream of European-American
lifestyles that thev're alienated by
definition.
Plavs Thursday evening.

Old Mill 6, Mountain View
The first comedy ever made
about sex roles with ideas that
you don't feel embarrassed about
discussing afterwards. Dustin
Hoffman plavs Michael Dorsey,a
gifted actor and teacher of acting
who shows up at an audition
dressed and made up as a woman
and lands a part in a daytime
soap. The movie starts out in the
tradition of Some Like It Hot, but
it grows and grows: as Michael
gets himself deeper and deeper
into this sexual and professional
deception, he has to exercise all
his actor's wiles to keep up with
the game, while he is discovering
levers of sensitivity in himself he
never knew existed. Sydney
Pollack hasdonea marvellous job
of shaping a first-rate script by
Larrv Gelbart and Murrav
Schisgal (and uncredited others),
and he affirms his reputation as a
fine actor's director: Hoffman,
Jessica Lange, Bill Murrav, Teri
(iarr, Charles Durning, George
Gavnes and Pollack himself all
turn in excellent performances.
This is a comedy of real sensi
bility.

American Graffiti (1973) ★
Tresidder Union, Room 270
This buoyant, affectionate
comedy about high school seniors
at the verv end of the pre-Beatle
era made its director, George
Lucas, famous. When it came out,
some people gave it credit for a
high seriousness it probablv never
intended, because the post-dra
matic information we're given
about the characters adds a
somber (and inappropriate) note
to the proceedings. Some of the
actors do give the funnv Willard
Huyck-Gloria Katz screenplay
some supplementary depth: Cin
dy Williams, Paul Le Mat,
Mackenzie Phillips and a voung,
touching Richard Drevfuss(look
ing a little like a juvenile version
of George C. Scott) as the
amorous dreamer Curt. Less suc
cessful are the episodes between
Charlie Martin Smith asthe hope

Candy Clark as Debbie, who tries

The Wages of Fear (1953) ★
Fox, Redwood City
In Henri-GeorgesClouzoi's fa
mous suspense thriller, four men
stuck in a crummy South Ameri
can town because of lack of funds
agree to an American oil com
pany's offer of $2000 apiece to
drive trucks full of nitro over
crude country roads (in order to
combat an oil fire). The treatment
of the careless Americans is trans
parent, but the rest of the movie is
breathtaking: wound tight, laid
out with exactitude, and almost
unbearably tense. The Him sug
gests Camus or Sartre energized
by a first-rate action director, and
the opening scenes in the sleepv
town are like the earlv scenes in
Huston's Treasure of the Sierra
Madre. The drivers are played by
Charles Vanel, Folco Lulli, Peter
Van Evck, and the young Yves
Montand, who has the presence
of a new Jean Gabin. (Clouzot in
cludes a tribute to Gabin's
greatest role, Pepe Le Moko.)
Stunningly shot bv Arinand Thir

New Varsity, Palo Alto
Many people find this drama
about a pair of English runners in
the 1924 Paris Olympics inspira
tional — taking their cue, no
doubt, from Colin Welland's
achingly preachv script and the
cautiously arranged period detail
with which the director, Hugh
Hudson, has loaded everything
down. The heroes are Eric Liddell
(lan Charleson), a Christian who
runs for the glory of God, and
Harold Abrahams (Ben Cross),
who runs to prove that Jews are
just as good as Christians: the
movie seems to be saving that vou
can be a champion if vour cause is
pure enough. The film works best
when it shuts its big mouth and we
watch the athletes' preparations
and the Olympic events (though
the sports scenes in Personal Best
are much better shot). As
Abrahams' sweetheart, actress
Sybil Gordon, Alice Krige wears
amazing showpiece gowns and
gives a delightfully preposterous
performance. With an immense,
expensive cast that includes John
(iielgud, lan Holm, Patrick
Magee, Lindsav Anderson, Den
nis Christopher, Nigel Davenport
and Brad Davis.

The Women (1939)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Audiences adore this movie,
which is performed by a stellar
cast consisting of many of M-G-
M's most interesting women of
the period. As a portrait of the
sex, it is not especially flattering
— one of the themes is that, given
the chance, women will destroy
each other's homes through mali
cious gossip and envy — but the
script bv Anita Loos and Jane
Murfen (adapted from the stage
play by Claire Boothe) is too
lighthearted to be taken verv seri
ously. In the most insufferable
role — Marv Haines, who smiles
courageously through her tears
when her husband has an affair
with a shopgirl — is Norma
Shearer, who gives a careful, stiff
ly worked out performance; her
Edwardian drawing-room dra
matic technique penetrates every
scene. As the other woman.
Crystal, Joan Crawford is ob
vious, too, but she has some en
joyable low moments. The third
leading role, the bitch, is plaved
by Rosalind Russell, giving one of
her glorious early comic per
formances. The other females in
clude Joan Fontaine, Paulette
Goddard, Phyllis Povah, Lucile
Watson, young Virginia Weidler,
Ruth Hussev, Virginia Grey, But
terfly McQueen, Hedda Hopper,
and, best of all, Marv Boland and
Marjorie Main. The direction by
George Cukor is fairly stylish, but
one wonders whose idea it was to
have him stage that drearv fash
ion show sequence (which was or
iginally in Technicolor).
Plays Thursdav only with Din
ner at Eight.

ta-Gavras, the director, gives a

he shows a feeling for visual

Haus Mitteleuropa
The first half of this curious
Werner Herzog film is a variation
on Porgy and Bess: Bruno (Bruno
S.) is a street musician who offers
shelter to Eva (Eva Mattes), a
prostitute, after her pimp lover
drives her away, but in this ver
sion it's Porgy who takes Bess to
New York — or rather, Wiscon
sin, where their landlord, Scheitz
(Clemens Scheitz), has promised
Eva a waitressing job. Bruno S.,
who made this movie after star
ring in Herzog's Mystery of
Kaspar Hauser, comes across like
a slightly drunken, slightly un
balanced hanger-on in a local bar
might — he reads his lines stilted-
Iv and doesn't focus his eves on
the people he speaks to — but he
has a peculiar charm, and plump,
overripe Eva Mattes has an ap
pealing animal sensusousness.
Once they get to America,
though, Herzog shifts gears: he
seems to want to make a movie
about the alienation of immi
grants, but he's chosen characters
who are so remote from the main
stream of European-American
lifestyles that thev're alienated by

In Henri-GeorgesClouzoi's fa

stuck in a crummy South Ameri

agree to an American oil com

drive trucks full of nitro over
crude country roads (in order to

of the careless Americans is trans

breathtaking: wound tight, laid

Many people find this drama
about a pair of English runners in
the 1924 Paris Olympics inspira
tional — taking their cue, no
doubt, from Colin Welland's
achingly preachv script and the
cautiously arranged period detail
with which the director, Hugh
Hudson, has loaded everything
down. The heroes are Eric Liddell
(lan Charleson), a Christian who
runs for the glory of God, and
Harold Abrahams (Ben Cross),
who runs to prove that Jews are
just as good as Christians: the
movie seems to be saving that vou
can be a champion if vour cause is
pure enough. The film works best
when it shuts its big mouth and we
watch the athletes' preparations
and the Olympic events (though
the sports scenes in Personal Best
are much better shot). As
Abrahams' sweetheart, actress
Sybil Gordon, Alice Krige wears
amazing showpiece gowns and
gives a delightfully preposterous
performance. With an immense,
expensive cast that includes John
(iielgud, lan Holm, Patrick
Magee, Lindsav Anderson, Den

and Brad Davis.

The Women (1939)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Audiences adore this movie,
which is performed by a stellar
cast consisting of many of M-G-
M's most interesting women of
the period. As a portrait of the
sex, it is not especially flattering
— one of the themes is that, given
the chance, women will destroy
each other's homes through mali
cious gossip and envy — but the
script bv Anita Loos and Jane
Murfen (adapted from the stage
play by Claire Boothe) is too
lighthearted to be taken verv seri
ously. In the most insufferable
role — Marv Haines, who smiles
courageously through her tears
when her husband has an affair
with a shopgirl — is Norma
Shearer, who gives a careful, stiff
ly worked out performance; her
Edwardian drawing-room dra
matic technique penetrates every
scene. As the other woman.
Crystal, Joan Crawford is ob
vious, too, but she has some en
joyable low moments. The third
leading role, the bitch, is plaved
by Rosalind Russell, giving one of
her glorious early comic per
formances. The other females in
clude Joan Fontaine, Paulette
Goddard, Phyllis Povah, Lucile
Watson, young Virginia Weidler,
Ruth Hussev, Virginia Grey, But
terfly McQueen, Hedda Hopper,
and, best of all, Marv Boland and
Marjorie Main. The direction by
George Cukor is fairly stylish, but
one wonders whose idea it was to
have him stage that drearv fash
ion show sequence (which was or
iginally in Technicolor).

Monsieur Verdoux (1947) ★
Festival, Palo Alto
When Charlie Chaplin brought
this black comedy out after
World War 11, just about ev
erybody hated it. (Among critics,
Archer Winsten and the per
sistently perceptive James Agee
were the notable exceptions.) No
body wanted to see the beloved
Little Tramp transformed into a
deft Bluebeard who murders
wealthy women so that he can af
ford to keep his wife and child in
sulated from the brutal world, in a
garden paradise. And then for
years no one could see Verdoux,
because when Chaplin was denied
re-entrance into this country dur
ing the McCarthy years, he
withdrew the Him and would not
permit it to be shown here until
the early '70s. It is a curio, and the
first scene is bewilderingly
clumsy, but be patient: the movie
is a masterpiece, and Chaplin
turns in a breathtaking per
formance in the title role. Ver
doux despises the world and
claims that he lives only for the
hours h: spends with his family in
their garden, but he seems
bloodless when he's with them;
murder revives him. The film is
full of chilling moments that
come back to you years after
you've seen it, and it features a
great comic turn by Martha Rave
as Verdoux's nemesis. With
Isabel Elsom, Margaret Hoffman
and Marilyn Nash as the destitute

monologues. This picture is about
the inevitable development of the

This buoyant, affectionate

some people gave it credit for a

somber (and inappropriate) note

The Wages of Fear (1953) ★
Fox, Redwood City
In Henri-GeorgesClouzoi's fa
mous suspense thriller, four men
stuck in a crummy South Ameri
can town because of lack of funds
agree to an American oil com
pany's offer of $2000 apiece to
drive trucks full of nitro over
crude country roads (in order to
combat an oil fire). The treatment
of the careless Americans is trans
parent, but the rest of the movie is
breathtaking: wound tight, laid
out with exactitude, and almost
unbearably tense. The Him sug
gests Camus or Sartre energized
by a first-rate action director, and
the opening scenes in the sleepv
town are like the earlv scenes in
Huston's Treasure of the Sierra
Madre. The drivers are played by
Charles Vanel, Folco Lulli, Peter
Van Evck, and the young Yves
Montand, who has the presence
of a new Jean Gabin. (Clouzot in

Stunningly shot bv Arinand Thir

Many people find this drama
about a pair of English runners in
the 1924 Paris Olympics inspira
tional — taking their cue, no
doubt, from Colin Welland's
achingly preachv script and the
cautiously arranged period detail
with which the director, Hugh
Hudson, has loaded everything
down. The heroes are Eric Liddell
(lan Charleson), a Christian who
runs for the glory of God, and
Harold Abrahams (Ben Cross),
who runs to prove that Jews are
just as good as Christians: the
movie seems to be saving that vou
can be a champion if vour cause is
pure enough. The film works best
when it shuts its big mouth and we
watch the athletes' preparations
and the Olympic events (though
the sports scenes in Personal Best
are much better shot). As
Abrahams' sweetheart, actress
Sybil Gordon, Alice Krige wears
amazing showpiece gowns and
gives a delightfully preposterous
performance. With an immense,
expensive cast that includes John
(iielgud, lan Holm, Patrick
Magee, Lindsav Anderson, Den

and Brad Davis.

The Women (1939)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Audiences adore this movie,
which is performed by a stellar
cast consisting of many of M-G-
M's most interesting women of
the period. As a portrait of the
sex, it is not especially flattering
— one of the themes is that, given
the chance, women will destroy
each other's homes through mali
cious gossip and envy — but the
script bv Anita Loos and Jane
Murfen (adapted from the stage
play by Claire Boothe) is too
lighthearted to be taken verv seri
ously. In the most insufferable
role — Marv Haines, who smiles
courageously through her tears
when her husband has an affair
with a shopgirl — is Norma
Shearer, who gives a careful, stiff
ly worked out performance; her
Edwardian drawing-room dra
matic technique penetrates every
scene. As the other woman.
Crystal, Joan Crawford is ob
vious, too, but she has some en
joyable low moments. The third
leading role, the bitch, is plaved
by Rosalind Russell, giving one of
her glorious early comic per
formances. The other females in
clude Joan Fontaine, Paulette
Goddard, Phyllis Povah, Lucile
Watson, young Virginia Weidler,
Ruth Hussev, Virginia Grey, But
terfly McQueen, Hedda Hopper,
and, best of all, Marv Boland and

George Cukor is fairly stylish, but
one wonders whose idea it was to

Monsieur Verdoux (1947) ★
Festival, Palo Alto
When Charlie Chaplin brought
this black comedy out after
World War 11, just about ev
erybody hated it. (Among critics,
Archer Winsten and the per
sistently perceptive James Agee
were the notable exceptions.) No
body wanted to see the beloved
Little Tramp transformed into a
deft Bluebeard who murders
wealthy women so that he can af
ford to keep his wife and child in
sulated from the brutal world, in a
garden paradise. And then for
years no one could see Verdoux,
because when Chaplin was denied
re-entrance into this country dur
ing the McCarthy years, he
withdrew the Him and would not
permit it to be shown here until
the early '70s. It is a curio, and the
first scene is bewilderingly
clumsy, but be patient: the movie
is a masterpiece, and Chaplin
turns in a breathtaking per
formance in the title role. Ver
doux despises the world and
claims that he lives only for the
hours h: spends with his family in
their garden, but he seems
bloodless when he's with them;
murder revives him. The film is
full of chilling moments that
come back to you years after
you've seen it, and it features a
great comic turn by Martha Rave
as Verdoux's nemesis. With
Isabel Elsom, Margaret Hoffman
and Marilyn Nash as the destitute
voung woman whose life he
spares.

Breaking Away (1979) ★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Steve Tesich has laid his
screenplay in Bloomington, Indi
ana, where he spent his teenage
years, and the four bovs (played
by Dennis Christopher, Dennis
Quaid, Daniel Stern and Jackie
Earle Haley) who are the pro
tagonists are so intricately drawn
that by the end of the movie vou
feel you've known them all your
life. Tesich has a talent for funny,
naturalistic dialogue and for
sketching the idiosyncrasies of his
characters so that thev don't seem
eccentric: he even writes first-rate
monologues. This picture is about
the inevitable development of the
bovs in separate directions, but
Tesich and the director, Peter
Yates, whose work here is under
stated and kindly, see the state of
change as affirmative. Beautifully
acted by the boys and bv Paul
Doolev and Barbara Barrie as
Dennis Christopher's parents,
Breaking Away has a stinging

A number of people associated

the blacklist, strangely enough,
lacks conviction. Woodv Allen
plavs a schlemiel who signs his
name to the teleplavs of an assort
ment of blacklisted dramatists so
that they can get their work on
TV, and in the best scenes he be
gins to enjoy his fraudulent celeb
rity status and demand that the
writers he's fronting for maintain
a high standard. It's a fairly limp
comedy most of the time, how
ever, and the presence of Woody
Allen, as funny as he is, makes us
wonder whose movie we're really

It takes place in Chile during

ta-Gavras, the director, gives a
stunning demonstration of what
it is like to be in a country in a
state of siege, and in some scenes
he shows a feeling for visual
poetry that indicates Bertolucci's

Costa-Gavras and Donald Stew

book) tells the true story of the
search for an American, Charlie
Horman, arrested in Chile in the
first davs of the take-over. But

there's a second plot, too — the
pollicitation of Horman's con
servative father (Jack Lemmon),
who comes to Chile to help his

Stroszek (1977)
Haus Mitteleuropa
The first half of this curious
Werner Herzog film is a variation
on Porgy and Bess: Bruno (Bruno
S.) is a street musician who offers
shelter to Eva (Eva Mattes), a
prostitute, after her pimp lover
drives her away, but in this ver
sion it's Porgy who takes Bess to
New York — or rather, Wiscon
sin, where their landlord, Scheitz
(Clemens Scheitz), has promised
Eva a waitressing job. Bruno S.,
who made this movie after star
ring in Herzog's Mystery of
Kaspar Hauser, comes across like
a slightly drunken, slightly un
balanced hanger-on in a local bar
might — he reads his lines stilted-
Iv and doesn't focus his eves on
the people he speaks to — but he
has a peculiar charm, and plump,
overripe Eva Mattes has an ap
pealing animal sensusousness.
Once they get to America,
though, Herzog shifts gears: he
seems to want to make a movie
about the alienation of immi
grants, but he's chosen characters
who are so remote from the main
stream of European-American
lifestyles that thev're alienated by
definition.

Edwardian drawing-room dra
matic technique penetrates every
scene. As the other woman.
Crystal, Joan Crawford is ob
vious, too, but she has some en

clude Joan Fontaine, Paulette

Watson, young Virginia Weidler,
Ruth Hussev, Virginia Grey, But
terfly McQueen, Hedda Hopper,

Monsieur Verdoux (1947) ★
Festival, Palo Alto
When Charlie Chaplin brought
this black comedy out after
World War 11, just about ev
erybody hated it. (Among critics,
Archer Winsten and the per
sistently perceptive James Agee
were the notable exceptions.) No
body wanted to see the beloved
Little Tramp transformed into a
deft Bluebeard who murders
wealthy women so that he can af
ford to keep his wife and child in
sulated from the brutal world, in a
garden paradise. And then for
years no one could see Verdoux,
because when Chaplin was denied
re-entrance into this country dur
ing the McCarthy years, he
withdrew the Him and would not
permit it to be shown here until
the early '70s. It is a curio, and the
first scene is bewilderingly
clumsy, but be patient: the movie
is a masterpiece, and Chaplin
turns in a breathtaking per
formance in the title role. Ver
doux despises the world and
claims that he lives only for the
hours h: spends with his family in
their garden, but he seems
bloodless when he's with them;
murder revives him. The film is
full of chilling moments that
come back to you years after
you've seen it, and it features a
great comic turn by Martha Rave
as Verdoux's nemesis. With
Isabel Elsom, Margaret Hoffman
and Marilyn Nash as the destitute
voung woman whose life he
spares.
Plays through Wednesday with
The Gold Rush.
Top Hat (1935) ★
Kresge Auditorium
Astaire and Rogers in one of
the most enchanting of all screen
musicals. To begin with, it has a
sensational score by Irving Berlin
("Top Hat, White Tie and Tails,"
"Isn't This a Lovely Day,"
"Cheek to Cheek," "No Strings,"
"The Piccolino"), two of which
songs provide pas de deux for the
stars, while one — the title tune —
is a witty number performed bv
Astaire with a male chorus whom
he mows down at the conclusion,
using his cane as a machine gun.
Dwight Taylor and Allan Scott
wrote the script, Mark Sandrich
directed, and the niftv supporting
cast features Edward Everett
Horton, Erik Rhodes, Eric Blore
and Helen Broderick (with
Lucille Ball in a walk-on).
Plays Monday evening with
Christopher Strong.

Breaking Away (1979) ★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Steve Tesich has laid his
screenplay in Bloomington, Indi
ana, where he spent his teenage
years, and the four bovs (played
by Dennis Christopher, Dennis
Quaid, Daniel Stern and Jackie
Earle Haley) who are the pro
tagonists are so intricately drawn
that by the end of the movie vou
feel you've known them all your
life. Tesich has a talent for funny,
naturalistic dialogue and for
sketching the idiosyncrasies of his
characters so that thev don't seem
eccentric: he even writes first-rate
monologues. This picture is about
the inevitable development of the
bovs in separate directions, but
Tesich and the director, Peter
Yates, whose work here is under
stated and kindly, see the state of
change as affirmative. Beautifully
acted by the boys and bv Paul
Doolev and Barbara Barrie as
Dennis Christopher's parents,
Breaking Away has a stinging
comic beauty.
Plavs tomorrow and Sunday
with Chariots of Fire.
The Front (1976)
Kresge Auditorium
A number of people associated
with this movie — among them
the writer, Walter Bernstein, the
director, Martin Ritt, and Zero
Mostel, who appears in it — sur
vived the bleak days of the Mc-
Carthy era, vet this comedy about
the blacklist, strangely enough,
lacks conviction. Woodv Allen
plavs a schlemiel who signs his
name to the teleplavs of an assort
ment of blacklisted dramatists so
that they can get their work on
TV, and in the best scenes he be
gins to enjoy his fraudulent celeb
rity status and demand that the
writers he's fronting for maintain
a high standard. It's a fairly limp
comedy most of the time, how
ever, and the presence of Woody
Allen, as funny as he is, makes us
wonder whose movie we're really
in: his performance isn't much
different from the acting he does
in his own pictures. With Andrea
Marcovicci, Michael Murphy
and Herschel Bernardi.
Plavs tonight.

Memorial Auditorium
It takes place in Chile during
the coup in 1973 that overthrew
Allende's Marxist government
and established a military junta,
but it seems to be set in hcll.Xos
ta-Gavras, the director, gives a
stunning demonstration of what
it is like to be in a country in a
state of siege, and in some scenes
he shows a feeling for visual
poetry that indicates Bertolucci's
influence. The screenplay (by
Costa-Gavras and Donald Stew
art, out of Thomas Hauser's
book) tells the true story of the
search for an American, Charlie
Horman, arrested in Chile in the
first davs of the take-over. But

there's a second plot, too — the
pollicitation of Horman's con
servative father (Jack Lemmon),
who comes to Chile to help his
daughter-in-law (Sissv Spacek,
giving her best performance in
years) to find Charlie — and it
nearly wrecks the movie. The
problem is not just Lemmon's aw
ful acting, but also the fact that
Horman's development has been
cut out of the cloth of 1960s gen
eration-gap cliches.
Plavs Sunday evening.
Stroszek (1977)
Haus Mitteleuropa
The first half of this curious
Werner Herzog film is a variation
on Porgy and Bess: Bruno (Bruno
S.) is a street musician who offers
shelter to Eva (Eva Mattes), a
prostitute, after her pimp lover
drives her away, but in this ver
sion it's Porgy who takes Bess to
New York — or rather, Wiscon
sin, where their landlord, Scheitz
(Clemens Scheitz), has promised
Eva a waitressing job. Bruno S.,
who made this movie after star
ring in Herzog's Mystery of
Kaspar Hauser, comes across like
a slightly drunken, slightly un
balanced hanger-on in a local bar
might — he reads his lines stilted-
Iv and doesn't focus his eves on
the people he speaks to — but he
has a peculiar charm, and plump,
overripe Eva Mattes has an ap
pealing animal sensusousness.
Once they get to America,
though, Herzog shifts gears: he
seems to want to make a movie
about the alienation of immi
grants, but he's chosen characters
who are so remote from the main
stream of European-American
lifestyles that thev're alienated by
definition.
Plavs Thursday evening.
Tootsie ★
Old Mill 6, Mountain View
The first comedy ever made
about sex roles with ideas that
you don't feel embarrassed about
discussing afterwards. Dustin
Hoffman plavs Michael Dorsey,a
gifted actor and teacher of acting
who shows up at an audition
dressed and made up as a woman
and lands a part in a daytime
soap. The movie starts out in the
tradition of Some Like It Hot, but
it grows and grows: as Michael
gets himself deeper and deeper
into this sexual and professional
deception, he has to exercise all
his actor's wiles to keep up with
the game, while he is discovering
levers of sensitivity in himself he
never knew existed. Sydney
Pollack hasdonea marvellous job
of shaping a first-rate script by
Larrv Gelbart and Murrav
Schisgal (and uncredited others),
and he affirms his reputation as a
fine actor's director: Hoffman,
Jessica Lange, Bill Murrav, Teri
(iarr, Charles Durning, George
Gavnes and Pollack himself all
turn in excellent performances.
This is a comedy of real sensi
bility.

American Graffiti (1973) ★
Tresidder Union, Room 270
This buoyant, affectionate
comedy about high school seniors
at the verv end of the pre-Beatle
era made its director, George
Lucas, famous. When it came out,
some people gave it credit for a
high seriousness it probablv never
intended, because the post-dra
matic information we're given
about the characters adds a
somber (and inappropriate) note
to the proceedings. Some of the
actors do give the funnv Willard
Huyck-Gloria Katz screenplay
some supplementary depth: Cin
dy Williams, Paul Le Mat,
Mackenzie Phillips and a voung,
touching Richard Drevfuss(look
ing a little like a juvenile version
of George C. Scott) as the
amorous dreamer Curt. Less suc
cessful are the episodes between
Charlie Martin Smith asthe hope
less nerd, Terrv the Toad, and
Candy Clark as Debbie, who tries
to emulate Sandra Dee and Con
nie Stevens.

The Wages of Fear (1953) ★
Fox, Redwood City
In Henri-GeorgesClouzoi's fa
mous suspense thriller, four men
stuck in a crummy South Ameri
can town because of lack of funds
agree to an American oil com
pany's offer of $2000 apiece to
drive trucks full of nitro over
crude country roads (in order to
combat an oil fire). The treatment
of the careless Americans is trans
parent, but the rest of the movie is
breathtaking: wound tight, laid
out with exactitude, and almost
unbearably tense. The Him sug
gests Camus or Sartre energized
by a first-rate action director, and
the opening scenes in the sleepv
town are like the earlv scenes in
Huston's Treasure of the Sierra
Madre. The drivers are played by
Charles Vanel, Folco Lulli, Peter
Van Evck, and the young Yves
Montand, who has the presence
of a new Jean Gabin. (Clouzot in
cludes a tribute to Gabin's
greatest role, Pepe Le Moko.)
Stunningly shot bv Arinand Thir
ard, and co-starring Vera Clouzot
(in an ill-conceived role).
Plavs Wednesday only with

Chariots of Fire
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Many people find this drama
about a pair of English runners in
the 1924 Paris Olympics inspira
tional — taking their cue, no
doubt, from Colin Welland's
achingly preachv script and the
cautiously arranged period detail
with which the director, Hugh
Hudson, has loaded everything
down. The heroes are Eric Liddell
(lan Charleson), a Christian who
runs for the glory of God, and
Harold Abrahams (Ben Cross),
who runs to prove that Jews are
just as good as Christians: the
movie seems to be saving that vou
can be a champion if vour cause is
pure enough. The film works best
when it shuts its big mouth and we
watch the athletes' preparations
and the Olympic events (though
the sports scenes in Personal Best
are much better shot). As
Abrahams' sweetheart, actress
Sybil Gordon, Alice Krige wears
amazing showpiece gowns and
gives a delightfully preposterous
performance. With an immense,
expensive cast that includes John
(iielgud, lan Holm, Patrick
Magee, Lindsav Anderson, Den
nis Christopher, Nigel Davenport
and Brad Davis.
Plays tomorrow and Sunday
with Breaking A way.
The Women (1939)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Audiences adore this movie,
which is performed by a stellar
cast consisting of many of M-G-
M's most interesting women of
the period. As a portrait of the
sex, it is not especially flattering
— one of the themes is that, given
the chance, women will destroy
each other's homes through mali
cious gossip and envy — but the
script bv Anita Loos and Jane
Murfen (adapted from the stage
play by Claire Boothe) is too
lighthearted to be taken verv seri
ously. In the most insufferable
role — Marv Haines, who smiles
courageously through her tears
when her husband has an affair
with a shopgirl — is Norma
Shearer, who gives a careful, stiff
ly worked out performance; her
Edwardian drawing-room dra
matic technique penetrates every
scene. As the other woman.
Crystal, Joan Crawford is ob
vious, too, but she has some en
joyable low moments. The third
leading role, the bitch, is plaved
by Rosalind Russell, giving one of
her glorious early comic per
formances. The other females in
