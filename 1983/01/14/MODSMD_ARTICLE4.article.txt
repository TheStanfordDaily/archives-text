A symposium here yesterday on
U.S. media coverage in Central
America turned into a forum for
criticism of the treatment of the civil
war in El Salvador and the lack of
media attention given to the guerril
las.
Don Gomez, a news director for
Channel 11 in San Jose and the most
animated of the three panelists,
began the discussion by analyzing
the news coverage of the El Sal
vadoran elections. "Everyone saw
the media coverage of the elections.
But there were a lot of problems
with the 'free elections' that I didn't
see covered by the American
media," he said.
Foremost among these, he said,
were problems with the sedula, an

item Gomez described as similar to
an American driver's license. Ac
cording to Gomez, "Your sedula
was stamped when you voted . . .
Not having voted was the equivalent
of being a sympathizer with the re
bels; a death sentence. Voting was
an act of self-preservation."
Raymond Bonner, who has
covered Central America for The
New York Times, had been sched
uled to be a panelist — the only one
representing a major news organi
zation — but did not appear. He was
replaced by another journalist criti
cal of the American media: Alex
Drehsler, a former San Diego Union
reporter who is now a free-lance
writer. He attacked the major
American newspapers and tele-

vision networks for their lack of "bal
anced coverage" in El Salvador.
According to Drehsler, "There is a
real traffic jam of European reporters,
French, Dutch and Belgian, in the
guerrilla camps. But The New York
Times, The Washington Post, would tell
me, 'We don't really have the connec
tions to get in with the guerrillas,'
which is a lot of crap. They just don't
want to take the time."
Another speaker, Robin Anderson,
a UC-Irvine Ph.D. candidate, drew
parallels between government policy
statements and news coverage." Eighty

percent of the media's sources come
from the United States government
and the El Salvadoran government,"
she said.
Anderson said that the "Carter line
was that a very moderate government
in El Salvador was battling extremists
of the right and left. It's a war without
winners."
Consequently, she said the main
news value in earlier coverage was vio
lence.
She said the Reagan administration,
however, felt the need to reassert
American will in Central America, es
pecially in El Salvador, which, she said,
"AI Haig called 'textbook case of
communist interference in El Sal
vador.'
