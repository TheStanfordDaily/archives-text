# Publishers cite illegality
## Classroom copying challenged 
### DAVID AZRIN Senior staff writer 
When most students want to copy a page from a book,
they simply step up to the copying machine, place the
opened book flat on the glass and drop the coin in the slot.
Few students notice the little black sign on the copying
machine that reads "Federal law prohibits. . . ."
Professors here also seem unaware or confused about
the current copyright laws concerning classroom use, even
though many distribute copied works to their students
without getting copyright permission.
"We're all going to be put in jail for this," Prof. Stephen
Krasner joked in an introductory political science course
this fall. After class about 285 students purchased 600-
page packets from a student entrepreneur waiting outside.
"I haven't really kept up on it in a really legal sort of
way," said Prof. Paul Turner who also distributes packets
of copied materials in an introductory art course. Turner
said that he had not obtained copyright permission.
But publishers are beginning to take the copyright laws
more seriously. They hope to test the scope of the law in a
suit filed last month against New York University (NYU),
nine of its professors, and an off-campus copy shop.
The suit pits nine of the publishing giants against one of
the largest private universities in the country and promises
to be a crucial test of the "fair use" doctrine of the 1976
copyright law.
This is the first time that a university and its professors
have been sued for violating the copyright laws concerning
classroom use, and the issue strikes the heart of the
academic world. What is intellectual property, and how
does the owner stop someone from stealing it?

Publishers hope the suit will set an example for other
schools, according to Carol Risher, director of the Associa
tion of American Publishers (AAP) copyright division
which is coordinating the suit.
4, We want the publicity. The school has a responsibility
for its employees and the faculty have an obligation to obey
the law," Risher said.
"I hope that the public stands up and takes notice," she
said.
Risher said that since the NYU suit was announced, she
has received evidence of anthologies at many other
schools, though she has not received reports of any inci
dents at Stanford.
The suit has already caused concern among University
administrators and faculty here.
University Provost Albert Hastorf said he sent a news
release about the suit to every dean and department head
as soon as he read about the case.
"I thought that this had enough implications that they
should take a look at it and alter their practices accord
ingly," Hastorf said.
According to Prof. Carolyn Lougee, who for three years
has asked students to buy packets of works prepared by
Kinko's copy shop for her History 1 course," We have tried
to use non-copyrighted materials, but we're going to have
to revise the packet because of the suit against NYU."
"We'll have to look very closely and make sure that
everything we copy is in the public domain," Lougee said.
Copyright permission is not obtained on the material, she
said.

trying to crack down on unauthorized photocopying of
material for classroom use.
Professors have reason to be con
fused about the current copyright laws,
according to University attorney Iris
Brest.
" Nobody knows what is legal." Brest
said. "It's a question of boundaries be
tween the very wishy-washy notion of
'fair use' and the very minimum guide
lines of the AAP."
The current suit charges that NYU
professors compiled anthologies of
copyrighted works without obtaining
copyright permission, thus depriving
the authors and publishers of royalties
and copyright fees. The professors re
portedly asked students to buy copies
at a copy shop near campus.

Publishers claim the practices "flag
rantly" violated the "fair use" doctrine
of the 1976 copyright law. The law was
intended to allow professors to distri
bute copies of materials in class under
certain conditions.
"The big question is what is fair use,"
said Law School Prof. Paul Goldstein.
"There are a number of factors that
have to be weighed. But in most cases
there is no bright line that tells us what
is infringement and what isn't, what is
fair use and what isn't," he said.
Because the fair-use doctrine is so
vague, a specific set of guidelines was
drawn up by an ad-hoc committee of
important publishing interests and rep
resentatives of 40 educational groups
in 1976 and presented at the house
committee hearings.
The guidelines which make up the
law's legislative history stress the need
for "spontaneity, brevity and cumula
tive effect," and contain the following
restrictions:
• A poem must be less than 250
words or two pages.
• A complete article must be less
than 2500 words and an excerpt must be
less than 1000 words or 10 percent of
the complete work.
• Copying shall not be used to create
anthologies, compilations or collective
works.
• Copying shall not substitute for the
purchase of books or articles.
• Copying of the same works shall
not be repeated from term to term.
These guidelines are not "the law,"
but only the "minimum standards"
which publishers agreed would not
constitute a violation of the copyright
law's doctrine of "fair use."
In cases where professors go beyond
the guidelines, "the courts must be free
to adapt the doctrine to particular situ
ations on a case-by-case basis," com
mittee reports state.
In the NYU case, members of the
AAP claim that violations of the guide
lines were so "flagrant" that they do
constitute a violation of the doctrine of
"fair use," Risher said.
"There is a strict provision that
under no conditions may copying be
used to create an anthology. Under no
conditions may it be a replacement of a
book. They were doing it all over the
university," Risher said.
Here at Stanford, a number of pro
fessors do compile collections of mate
rials and ask local copy shops or their
own academic departments to make
the copies without getting copyright
permission.
Professors say the packets are neces
sary for a variety of reasons.
Most say that works included in the

packets were difficult to obtain or
out-of-print. But copyright laws re
main in effect even when a book goes
out of print.
Professors also complained that it is
too time-consuming tor students to
read works placed on reserve at Meyer
Library. 'One gets tremendous resist
ance from classes when they have to go
to the library and use reserve reading. I
hear complaints about it and I hear
about it in the course evaluations," said
Anthropology Prof. Arthur Wolf.
Wolf said that he asks students in his
Anthropology 6 course to buy a pcket
of selections he compiled at Kinko's.
"It's playing right on the edge of leg
ality," Wolf added.
Political Science Prof. Alexander
Dallin said he has no qualms about
preparing a packet of readings for his
students without obtaining copyright
permission.
"I have felt fairly comfortable or
ganizing a collection for all the students
who are willing to pay for it at cost,
especially if it's out-of-print or not
readily available," he said.
In the Structured Liberal Education
Program, large packets of readings are
also prepared for students.
Junior Luke Cole, who has earned
money distributing packets for two
courses here, said that he felt he was
doing the students a service.
"If the packets weren't available the
class would have been extremely ex
pensive," he said, "either in terms of
the time spent waiting for reserve read
ing at Meyer, the expense from people
just copying the material themselves,
or the expense in having to buy the
actual books."
Managers at the Stanford Bookstore
said they were not aware that any pro
fessors were copying sections of books
and distributing them to their classes.
"It hasn't come to our attention that
that's a large problem. If they want to
take the risk of copying it, and we're
not going to lose money on it, then we
really don't care," said assistant man
ager Philipp Chiaramonte.
The Kinko's copying shop appears to
be the most popular among professors
here. Robert VanDeWeerd, manager
of the local store, said that more than
22 professors have asked him to pre
pare packets of reading for their classes
this quarter.
"Primarily the readers that we do are
made up of part of a book and part of
an article. The professor or the teach
ing assistant will bring in a box of arti
cles or books and ask for a piece of this
and a piece of that to be copied," he
said.
VanDeWeerd emphasized that "we
do not just copy anything that walks j
in."
"I examine each and every
orders that come in here and if it is fliof
within the accepted levels of the (Aalt)
guidelines, I instruct them that they i
have to get copyright permission be
fore I will touch it,"he said.
Professors are required to sign a re
lease from stating that they are adher
ing to AAP guidelines, VanDeWeerd
said.
The whole issue of legality remains
clouded because of the vagueness of
the current laws. Faculty and students
can only hope the NYU case will help
clarify what they can and cannot do
under the law.
"Most people are hoping that the
NYU case will teach us a lot, that we
will know better about the law after the
case is settled," said Brest.

Professors have reason to be con
fused about the current copyright laws,
according to University attorney Iris
Brest.
" Nobody knows what is legal." Brest
said. "It's a question of boundaries be
tween the very wishy-washy notion of
'fair use' and the very minimum guide
lines of the AAP."
The current suit charges that NYU
professors compiled anthologies of
copyrighted works without obtaining
copyright permission, thus depriving
the authors and publishers of royalties
and copyright fees. The professors re
portedly asked students to buy copies
at a copy shop near campus.
portedly asked students to buy copies
at a copy shop near campus.
Publishers claim the practices "flag
rantly" violated the "fair use" doctrine
of the 1976 copyright law. The law was
intended to allow professors to distri
bute copies of materials in class under
certain conditions.
"The big question is what is fair use,"
said Law School Prof. Paul Goldstein.
"There are a number of factors that
have to be weighed. But in most cases
there is no bright line that tells us what
is infringement and what isn't, what is
fair use and what isn't," he said.
Because the fair-use doctrine is so
vague, a specific set of guidelines was
drawn up by an ad-hoc committee of
important publishing interests and rep
resentatives of 40 educational groups
in 1976 and presented at the house
committee hearings.
The guidelines which make up the
law's legislative history stress the need
for "spontaneity, brevity and cumula
tive effect," and contain the following
restrictions:
• A poem must be less than 250
words or two pages.
• A complete article must be less
than 2500 words and an excerpt must be
less than 1000 words or 10 percent of
the complete work.
• Copying shall not be used to create
anthologies, compilations or collective
works.
• Copying shall not substitute for the
purchase of books or articles.
• Copying of the same works shall
not be repeated from term to term.
These guidelines are not "the law,"
but only the "minimum standards"
which publishers agreed would not
constitute a violation of the copyright
law's doctrine of "fair use."
In cases where professors go beyond
the guidelines, "the courts must be free
to adapt the doctrine to particular situ
ations on a case-by-case basis," com
mittee reports state.
In the NYU case, members of the
AAP claim that violations of the guide
lines were so "flagrant" that they do
constitute a violation of the doctrine of
"fair use," Risher said.
"There is a strict provision that
under no conditions may copying be
used to create an anthology. Under no
conditions may it be a replacement of a
book. They were doing it all over the
university," Risher said.
Here at Stanford, a number of pro
fessors do compile collections of mate
rials and ask local copy shops or their
own academic departments to make
the copies without getting copyright
permission.
Professors say the packets are neces
sary for a variety of reasons.
Most say that works included in the

packets were difficult to obtain or
out-of-print. But copyright laws re
main in effect even when a book goes
out of print.
Professors also complained that it is
too time-consuming tor students to
read works placed on reserve at Meyer
Library. 'One gets tremendous resist
ance from classes when they have to go
to the library and use reserve reading. I
hear complaints about it and I hear
about it in the course evaluations," said
Anthropology Prof. Arthur Wolf.
Wolf said that he asks students in his
Anthropology 6 course to buy a pcket
of selections he compiled at Kinko's.
"It's playing right on the edge of leg
ality," Wolf added.
Political Science Prof. Alexander
Dallin said he has no qualms about
preparing a packet of readings for his
students without obtaining copyright
permission.
"I have felt fairly comfortable or
ganizing a collection for all the students
who are willing to pay for it at cost,
especially if it's out-of-print or not
readily available," he said.
In the Structured Liberal Education
Program, large packets of readings are
also prepared for students.
Junior Luke Cole, who has earned
money distributing packets for two
courses here, said that he felt he was
doing the students a service.
"If the packets weren't available the
class would have been extremely ex
pensive," he said, "either in terms of
the time spent waiting for reserve read
ing at Meyer, the expense from people
just copying the material themselves,
or the expense in having to buy the
actual books."
Managers at the Stanford Bookstore
said they were not aware that any pro
fessors were copying sections of books
and distributing them to their classes.
"It hasn't come to our attention that
that's a large problem. If they want to
take the risk of copying it, and we're
not going to lose money on it, then we
really don't care," said assistant man
ager Philipp Chiaramonte.
The Kinko's copying shop appears to
be the most popular among professors
here. Robert VanDeWeerd, manager
of the local store, said that more than
22 professors have asked him to pre
pare packets of reading for their classes
this quarter.
"Primarily the readers that we do are
made up of part of a book and part of
an article. The professor or the teach
ing assistant will bring in a box of arti
cles or books and ask for a piece of this
and a piece of that to be copied," he
said.
VanDeWeerd emphasized that "we
do not just copy anything that walks j
in."
"I examine each and every
orders that come in here and if it is fliof
within the accepted levels of the (Aalt)
guidelines, I instruct them that they i
have to get copyright permission be
fore I will touch it,"he said.
Professors are required to sign a re
lease from stating that they are adher
ing to AAP guidelines, VanDeWeerd
said.
The whole issue of legality remains
clouded because of the vagueness of
the current laws. Faculty and students
can only hope the NYU case will help
clarify what they can and cannot do
under the law.
"Most people are hoping that the
NYU case will teach us a lot, that we
will know better about the law after the
case is settled," said Brest.
When most students want to copy a page from a book,
they simply step up to the copying machine, place the
opened book flat on the glass and drop the coin in the slot.
Few students notice the little black sign on the copying
machine that reads "Federal law prohibits. . . ."
Professors here also seem unaware or confused about
the current copyright laws concerning classroom use, even
though many distribute copied works to their students
without getting copyright permission.
"We're all going to be put in jail for this," Prof. Stephen
Krasner joked in an introductory political science course
this fall. After class about 285 students purchased 600-
page packets from a student entrepreneur waiting outside.
"I haven't really kept up on it in a really legal sort of
way," said Prof. Paul Turner who also distributes packets
of copied materials in an introductory art course. Turner
said that he had not obtained copyright permission.
But publishers are beginning to take the copyright laws
more seriously. They hope to test the scope of the law in a
suit filed last month against New York University (NYU),
nine of its professors, and an off-campus copy shop.
The suit pits nine of the publishing giants against one of
the largest private universities in the country and promises
to be a crucial test of the "fair use" doctrine of the 1976
copyright law.
This is the first time that a university and its professors
have been sued for violating the copyright laws concerning
classroom use, and the issue strikes the heart of the
academic world. What is intellectual property, and how
does the owner stop someone from stealing it?

Publishers hope the suit will set an example for other
schools, according to Carol Risher, director of the Associa
tion of American Publishers (AAP) copyright division
which is coordinating the suit.
4, We want the publicity. The school has a responsibility
for its employees and the faculty have an obligation to obey
the law," Risher said.
"I hope that the public stands up and takes notice," she
said.
Risher said that since the NYU suit was announced, she
has received evidence of anthologies at many other
schools, though she has not received reports of any inci
dents at Stanford.
The suit has already caused concern among University
administrators and faculty here.
University Provost Albert Hastorf said he sent a news
release about the suit to every dean and department head
as soon as he read about the case.
"I thought that this had enough implications that they
should take a look at it and alter their practices accord
ingly," Hastorf said.
According to Prof. Carolyn Lougee, who for three years
has asked students to buy packets of works prepared by
Kinko's copy shop for her History 1 course," We have tried
to use non-copyrighted materials, but we're going to have
to revise the packet because of the suit against NYU."
"We'll have to look very closely and make sure that
everything we copy is in the public domain," Lougee said.
Copyright permission is not obtained on the material, she
said.

Most say that works included in the

packets were difficult to obtain or
out-of-print. But copyright laws re
main in effect even when a book goes
out of print.
Professors also complained that it is
too time-consuming tor students to
read works placed on reserve at Meyer
Library. 'One gets tremendous resist
ance from classes when they have to go
to the library and use reserve reading. I
hear complaints about it and I hear
about it in the course evaluations," said
Anthropology Prof. Arthur Wolf.
Wolf said that he asks students in his
Anthropology 6 course to buy a pcket
of selections he compiled at Kinko's.
"It's playing right on the edge of leg
ality," Wolf added.
Political Science Prof. Alexander
Dallin said he has no qualms about
preparing a packet of readings for his
students without obtaining copyright
permission.
"I have felt fairly comfortable or
ganizing a collection for all the students
who are willing to pay for it at cost,
especially if it's out-of-print or not
readily available," he said.
In the Structured Liberal Education
Program, large packets of readings are
also prepared for students.
Junior Luke Cole, who has earned
money distributing packets for two
courses here, said that he felt he was
doing the students a service.
"If the packets weren't available the
class would have been extremely ex
pensive," he said, "either in terms of
the time spent waiting for reserve read
ing at Meyer, the expense from people
just copying the material themselves,
or the expense in having to buy the
actual books."
Managers at the Stanford Bookstore
said they were not aware that any pro
fessors were copying sections of books
and distributing them to their classes.
"It hasn't come to our attention that
that's a large problem. If they want to
take the risk of copying it, and we're
not going to lose money on it, then we
really don't care," said assistant man
ager Philipp Chiaramonte.
The Kinko's copying shop appears to
be the most popular among professors
here. Robert VanDeWeerd, manager
of the local store, said that more than
22 professors have asked him to pre
pare packets of reading for their classes
this quarter.
"Primarily the readers that we do are
made up of part of a book and part of
an article. The professor or the teach
ing assistant will bring in a box of arti
cles or books and ask for a piece of this
and a piece of that to be copied," he
said.
VanDeWeerd emphasized that "we
do not just copy anything that walks j
in."
"I examine each and every
orders that come in here and if it is fliof
within the accepted levels of the (Aalt)
guidelines, I instruct them that they i
have to get copyright permission be
fore I will touch it,"he said.
Professors are required to sign a re
lease from stating that they are adher
ing to AAP guidelines, VanDeWeerd
said.
The whole issue of legality remains
clouded because of the vagueness of
the current laws. Faculty and students
can only hope the NYU case will help
clarify what they can and cannot do
under the law.
"Most people are hoping that the
NYU case will teach us a lot, that we
will know better about the law after the
case is settled," said Brest.
When most students want to copy a page from a book,
they simply step up to the copying machine, place the
opened book flat on the glass and drop the coin in the slot.
Few students notice the little black sign on the copying
machine that reads "Federal law prohibits. . . ."
Professors here also seem unaware or confused about
the current copyright laws concerning classroom use, even
though many distribute copied works to their students
without getting copyright permission.
"We're all going to be put in jail for this," Prof. Stephen
Krasner joked in an introductory political science course
this fall. After class about 285 students purchased 600-
page packets from a student entrepreneur waiting outside.
"I haven't really kept up on it in a really legal sort of
way," said Prof. Paul Turner who also distributes packets
of copied materials in an introductory art course. Turner
said that he had not obtained copyright permission.
But publishers are beginning to take the copyright laws
more seriously. They hope to test the scope of the law in a
suit filed last month against New York University (NYU),
nine of its professors, and an off-campus copy shop.
The suit pits nine of the publishing giants against one of
the largest private universities in the country and promises
to be a crucial test of the "fair use" doctrine of the 1976
copyright law.
This is the first time that a university and its professors
have been sued for violating the copyright laws concerning
classroom use, and the issue strikes the heart of the
academic world. What is intellectual property, and how
does the owner stop someone from stealing it?

Publishers hope the suit will set an example for other
schools, according to Carol Risher, director of the Associa
tion of American Publishers (AAP) copyright division
which is coordinating the suit.
4, We want the publicity. The school has a responsibility
for its employees and the faculty have an obligation to obey
the law," Risher said.
"I hope that the public stands up and takes notice," she
said.
Risher said that since the NYU suit was announced, she
has received evidence of anthologies at many other
schools, though she has not received reports of any inci
dents at Stanford.
The suit has already caused concern among University
administrators and faculty here.
University Provost Albert Hastorf said he sent a news
release about the suit to every dean and department head
as soon as he read about the case.
"I thought that this had enough implications that they
should take a look at it and alter their practices accord
ingly," Hastorf said.
According to Prof. Carolyn Lougee, who for three years
has asked students to buy packets of works prepared by
Kinko's copy shop for her History 1 course," We have tried
to use non-copyrighted materials, but we're going to have
to revise the packet because of the suit against NYU."
"We'll have to look very closely and make sure that
everything we copy is in the public domain," Lougee said.
Copyright permission is not obtained on the material, she
said.

publishers, citing a violation of copyright laws, are

trying to crack down on unauthorized photocopying of
material for classroom use.
Professors have reason to be con
fused about the current copyright laws,
according to University attorney Iris
Brest.
" Nobody knows what is legal." Brest
said. "It's a question of boundaries be
tween the very wishy-washy notion of
'fair use' and the very minimum guide
lines of the AAP."
The current suit charges that NYU
professors compiled anthologies of
copyrighted works without obtaining
copyright permission, thus depriving
the authors and publishers of royalties
and copyright fees. The professors re
portedly asked students to buy copies
at a copy shop near campus.

Publishers claim the practices "flag
rantly" violated the "fair use" doctrine
of the 1976 copyright law. The law was
intended to allow professors to distri
bute copies of materials in class under
certain conditions.
"The big question is what is fair use,"
said Law School Prof. Paul Goldstein.
"There are a number of factors that
have to be weighed. But in most cases
there is no bright line that tells us what
is infringement and what isn't, what is
fair use and what isn't," he said.
Because the fair-use doctrine is so
vague, a specific set of guidelines was
drawn up by an ad-hoc committee of
important publishing interests and rep
resentatives of 40 educational groups
in 1976 and presented at the house
committee hearings.
The guidelines which make up the
law's legislative history stress the need
for "spontaneity, brevity and cumula
tive effect," and contain the following
restrictions:
• A poem must be less than 250
words or two pages.
• A complete article must be less
than 2500 words and an excerpt must be
less than 1000 words or 10 percent of
the complete work.
• Copying shall not be used to create
anthologies, compilations or collective
works.
• Copying shall not substitute for the
purchase of books or articles.
• Copying of the same works shall
not be repeated from term to term.
These guidelines are not "the law,"
but only the "minimum standards"
which publishers agreed would not
constitute a violation of the copyright
law's doctrine of "fair use."
In cases where professors go beyond
the guidelines, "the courts must be free
to adapt the doctrine to particular situ
ations on a case-by-case basis," com
mittee reports state.
In the NYU case, members of the
AAP claim that violations of the guide
lines were so "flagrant" that they do
constitute a violation of the doctrine of
"fair use," Risher said.
"There is a strict provision that
under no conditions may copying be
used to create an anthology. Under no
conditions may it be a replacement of a
book. They were doing it all over the
university," Risher said.
Here at Stanford, a number of pro
fessors do compile collections of mate
rials and ask local copy shops or their
own academic departments to make
the copies without getting copyright
permission.
