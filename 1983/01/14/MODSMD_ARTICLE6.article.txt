# Publishers cite illegality
## Classroom copying challenged 
### DAVID AZRIN Senior staff writer 
When most students want to copy a page from a book,
they simply step up to the copying machine, place the
opened book flat on the glass and drop the coin in the slot.
Few students notice the little black sign on the copying
machine that reads "Federal law prohibits. . . ."
Professors here also seem unaware or confused about
the current copyright laws concerning classroom use, even
though many distribute copied works to their students
without getting copyright permission.
"We're all going to be put in jail for this," Prof. Stephen
Krasner joked in an introductory political science course
this fall. After class about 285 students purchased 600-
page packets from a student entrepreneur waiting outside.
"I haven't really kept up on it in a really legal sort of
way," said Prof. Paul Turner who also distributes packets
of copied materials in an introductory art course. Turner
said that he had not obtained copyright permission.
But publishers are beginning to take the copyright laws
more seriously. They hope to test the scope of the law in a
suit filed last month against New York University (NYU),
nine of its professors, and an off-campus copy shop.
The suit pits nine of the publishing giants against one of
the largest private universities in the country and promises
to be a crucial test of the "fair use" doctrine of the 1976
copyright law.
This is the first time that a university and its professors
have been sued for violating the copyright laws concerning
classroom use, and the issue strikes the heart of the
academic world. What is intellectual property, and how
does the owner stop someone from stealing it?

Publishers hope the suit will set an example for other
schools, according to Carol Risher, director of the Associa
tion of American Publishers (AAP) copyright division
which is coordinating the suit.
4, We want the publicity. The school has a responsibility
for its employees and the faculty have an obligation to obey
the law," Risher said.
"I hope that the public stands up and takes notice," she
said.
Risher said that since the NYU suit was announced, she
has received evidence of anthologies at many other
schools, though she has not received reports of any inci
dents at Stanford.
The suit has already caused concern among University
administrators and faculty here.
University Provost Albert Hastorf said he sent a news
release about the suit to every dean and department head
as soon as he read about the case.
"I thought that this had enough implications that they
should take a look at it and alter their practices accord
ingly," Hastorf said.
According to Prof. Carolyn Lougee, who for three years
has asked students to buy packets of works prepared by
Kinko's copy shop for her History 1 course," We have tried
to use non-copyrighted materials, but we're going to have
to revise the packet because of the suit against NYU."
"We'll have to look very closely and make sure that
everything we copy is in the public domain," Lougee said.
Copyright permission is not obtained on the material, she
said.
