# EPA to review energy proposal

The facilities project management
office here should present an operating
plan to the Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) in two to three weeks
for a proposed cogeneration plant â€” a
gas turbine plant producing both elec
tricity and steam from a single fuel,
according to project manager Jack
Barkle.
Both the EPA and the University are
confident the plan will keep plant car
bon monoxide emissions below the
point where a construction ban would
be applicable.
The ban covers construction and
modification of major stationary
sources of carbon monoxide and hy
drocarbons in nonattainment areas
such as the Bay Area since July 1979.
The Clean Air Act defines nonattain
ment regions as areas failing to meet
federal health safety standards on car
bon monoxide and hydrocarbon emis
sions. Nonattainment areas must meet
these standards.
Until the Bay Area implements a
motor vehicle inspection and mainte
nance plan that would lower carbon
monoxide and hydrocarbon levels by
10 to 20 percent, a ban exists on con
struction and modification of major
stationary sources which produce more
than 100 tons per year of carbon
monoxide and hydrocarbons.
Under the current operating plan,
the University's cogeneration plant
may emit more than the 100-ton per
year limit qualifying it as a major sta
tionary source of carbon monoxide.
But the University will present a new
operating plan with operational restric
tions that will ensure the plant no
longer qualifies as a major souce of
carbon monoxide emissions.
According to a staff engineer in the
permits section of the EPA, the federal
agency expects the University to pre
sent a suitable plan.
Barkle said the EPA "will remove
the construction ban in the next two or
three weeks."
The EPA and the Bay Area Air
Quality Management District are in the
preliminary stages of issuing a permit
for plant construction. But both
foresee few complications once the ban
is lifted.
Cogeneration could reduce the Uni
versity's current $12.6 million energy
cost to $8 million, an annral savings of
nearly $4.8 million, according to
Barkle. (These figures were reversed in
a story in yesterday's Daily, which was
based on a University news release.)
The cogeneration proposal is cur
rently in a 30-day public comment
period.
