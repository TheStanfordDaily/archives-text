## A
						day in a place of the past-the Hidden Villa story 
### GALE WARNER 
Quiet. Frost covers the fields like an over
night stubble of beard; later it will be shaved
clean by the sun. The valley is cool, damp, the
tops of mountains concealed in cloud. Cows
amble to pasture after their morning milking to
feed on new winter grass, chilled and brittle
beneath their hooves.
By the time the school buses arrive at Hid
den Villa Ranch the sun has cleared a ridge and
the fields turn steamy, blanketed with light.
Clouds dissipate; one of the guides remarks," it
looks like good hawk weather." The guides
agree to start the day by getting the children to
sing the chant, "Red-tailed Hawk."
But as they spill from the bus they are al
ready singing their school song, "Give me that
ol' Cavanaugh spirit," which goes to the tune of
"Give me that ol' time religion." Guides join in
as these third-graders from Cavanaugh
Elementary in East Palo Alto gather around,
their faces shimmering with delight and antici
pation. There are no white faces.
This is their first visit to Hidden Villa, the
2500-acre ranch nestled in the foothills of the
Santa Cruz Mountains that has been opening
its gates to people of all ages, races and back
grounds for half a century. Many have
never seen a live cow or pig before, or spent a
day hiking in a forest. The mountainsides and
pastures are so alien-looking that several view
them with apprehension, but all are eager to
begin. The busload splits into small groups,
each guide taking six children, and one thing is
clear: it will be an unforgettable day for all.
The area of fertile valleys and gentle moun
tains known as Hidden Villa has been inha
bited for centuries, but its precise history is
uncertain; details are shadowy and softened
with time, with many stories filling the gaps. It
is likely that Ohlone Indians lived along Adobe
Creek, and were later replaced by Spanish
padres. Some of the old ranch buildings may
date from the 1860s, and one legend is that a
house that still stands served as a first night's
rest in the late 19th century for the three-day
trip from San Jose to San Francisco. Travelers

went by stage to Hidden Villa in one day, cros
sed the mountains to Pescadero the next, and
caught a steamer to San Francisco on the third.
But Hidden Villa's history really begins in
1924, when Frank and Josephine Duveneck
bought the original 1000-acre ranch for $25 an
acre. Frank was an engineer with a master's
degree from Harvard, the son of two well
known painters. Josephine was a Boston de
butante with poetic leanings and a deep love of
nature. They married in 1913 and came to
California just before World War I, fleeing
New England winters and the equal coldness,
they felt, of the Boston Brahmin society they
had been raised in.

Hidden Villa was a center for
progressive thinking on the
peninsula, sheltering a variety
of people from displaced
WWII Japanese Americans to
Cesar Chavez.

They had lived in Palo Alto with their four
small children for several years when they acci
dentally discovered their new permanent
home. Josephine later wrote that "when I first
walked up the road in Hidden Villa, I was
overwhelmed by a sense of past lives lived in
serenity and harmonious fulfillment in this
place." Gradually they acquired more land
until they owned all of the Adobe Creek
watershed, hoping to protect it from the devel
opment pressures that even then threatened
their wilderness of thick forests, steep chapar
ral hillsides, and open grasslands.
But Hidden Villa quickly became more than
just a home to the Duveneck family; as their
neighbor Wallace Stegner once remarked,
"they could not own a home without sharing
it." It became a center for progressive thinking
and action on the Peninsula, a refuge for the
displaced and disadvantaged, a mecca for so
cial activist groups, an embodiment of the

Duvenecks' conservation and humanitarian
ideals.
The Loma Prieta chapter of the Sierra Club
was born in a small glen at Hidden Villa in
1933. In 1937 the Duvenecks opened a youth
hostel, the first on the Pacific Coast. In 1945
they began one of the first inter-racial summer
camps in the country. All three enterprises
flourish today.
Hidden Villa has frequently welcomed many
groups and causes that were not welcome
elsewhere. During World War 11 the
Duvenecks took in Jewish refugees from
Europe. Japanese-Americans imprisoned in
camps, and others displaced by the war. In
dians, Chicanos, blacks, even Moslems used
Hidden Villa as a meeting place; Cesar Chavez
and his cohorts held secret meetings in their
friendly fields to plan some of the first strikes of
the Agricultural Worker's Union.
Josephine died in 1978, just after finishing
her autobiography. Life on Two Levels, but
Frank is, as his friends like to say, "96 years
young." He maintains that he never really
owned the land, but that "I simply held it, and
took care of it."
Children have long been part of Hidden Vil
la's tradition; Frank calls them "the most im
portant crop we grow here." Some 4000 pre
schoolers, kindergartners, and first-graders tour
the farm each year, seeing, often for the first
time, connections between their glass of milk
and a cow, their scrambled eggs and a chicken.
But in the aftermath of Earth Day many felt a
more intensive experience with older children
was needed to develop a sense of caring for the
land, plants and animals and an awareness of
the role ecology plays in our lives. In 1970 the
Hidden Villa Environmental Project began
bringing busloads of children from Bay Area
elementary schools to Hidden Villa for a full
day of exploring the farm and hiking the moun
tain trails. For many, such as the children of
Cavanaugh Elementary, it is the most extraor
dinary day of school all year.
One group has a good mix — three boys,
three girls, all on the inquisitive side, all

energetic. By midday they have already sam
pled wild miner's lettuce, held a baby lamb,
smelled crushed sage and pennyroyal, patted
calves, hugged a mossy tree, examined a
banana slug, and pulled a carrot from the gar
den. Now, on a trail lined with bay, oak and
toyon, they are quickly losing any initial hesi
tancy about the strangeness of their surround
ings, and are full of questions.
"What's that called?" asks one girl, pointing
to a white flower which happens to be in the
mustard family. "What would you name it?"
The guide asks back. She thinks for a moment.
"White Twinkles," she finally announces,
pleased. Other children join in, naming hounds
tongue "Blue Crystals" and Indian warriors
"Red Ferns." Unlike the monikers they could
have been served pre-cooked and reheated,
they digest the names they create, remember
ing them all day.

Stanford students have been
guiding at Hidden Villa for
11 years; credit is available
through ARLO, SCIRE, or
human biology.

It is decided that the children are ready to do
an "alone walk," which means that each child
will have to walk about 200 yards of trail alone,
slowly, looking and listening carefully, experi
encing a sense of solitude with the trees and
birds.
The shyest boy volunteers to go first and
stops at the end with an enormous smile. "That
was neat!" The next boy stops on the trail only
50 yards away, out of sight around a corner,

and yells that he is scared. "Keep walking — I
was scared too, but I made it," calls the quiet
child, and he coaches the apprehensive boy the
rest of the way. The rest follow without mishap;
the triumph in their eyes is unmistakable.
The aim of the environmental project is not
to just teach facts about ecology, or indoctri
nate a particular point of view, but rather ex
plore the human values inherent in our at
titudes toward land and its creatures. Thus the
volunteer guides often learn just as much as the
kids from a day at Hidden Villa. Drawn from
both the community and four area colleges,
they commit one day a week for two quarters.
Stanford students have now been guiding at
Hidden Villa for 11 years.
But while perhaps the most meaningful,
guiding is not the only way students can share
in Hidden Villa's beauty. Located on Moody
Road two miles west of Foothill College, the
ranch is within bike-riding distance or a 15-
minute drive from campus. It is free and open
to the public every day except Mondays for
hiking, jogging, riding, picnicking or even i|
studying. The youth hostel offers a cheap night
off-campus or a weekend retreat for groups i
and organizations. Now as always. Hidden jg
Villa offers its serenity and wildness for all to
enjoy.
The sun nears the opposite ridge as the group
comes back to join the other children and
guides for a last few songs. Each of the children
hugs his guide and says thank-you. As all in
tone the old, vaguely Indian chant, "Wearing
my red-tailed feathers as I fly, I circle around
the boundaries of the earth," a hawk appears
over the ridge as if on cue, riding the last warm
currents of the day.
