You've never
seen anything
like it. . .
A nocturnal animal, if
has seven terminal
arms and occasionally
short hands, goes to
bed late five nights a
week, writes heads,
lays pages, makes
odlines, deadlines,
cutlines and pics, ears
pizza or night and
sometimes its own
words. It's the Daily,
your newspaper.
You could love it!
