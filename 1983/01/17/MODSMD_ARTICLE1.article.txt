# Democratic presidential candidates convene
## 
### RICHARD DECK 
Sacramento — In the California state con
vention, popularly acclaimed as the first "cattle
show" of the 1984 Democratic presidential
race, seven presidential hopefuls attempted to
impress delegates — and the press — this
weekend.
And in personal interviews, all of the candi
dates were quick to say that they were suppor
tive and enthusiastic about an increased federal
role in education.
The seven declared or potential candidates
were Ohio Sen. John Glenn, Colorado Sen.
Gary Hart, Arizona Rep. Morris Udall, South
Carolina Sen. Ernest "Fritz" Hollings, Arkan
sas Sen. Dale Bumpers, former Vice President
Walter "Fritz" Mondale and California Sen.
Alan Cranston.
It appeared that Cranston was most success
ful in wooing the delegates as he garnered 1129

out of 1700 votes in a non-binding straw poll
among the Democrats. Before the convention,
political observers had considered it a necessity
for the little-known Cranston to capture a
majority of the votes for his campaign to sur
vive.
But Mondale may have captured the hearts
of the extensive press corps — over 200 news
paper, magazine and television journalists who
created a veritable "media circus" — by impre
ssing many with the fact that the former vice
president remains a very strong candidate.
Mondale captured 23 percent of the votes in
the "straw poll," which placed him a strong
second.
And Glenn spoke most forcefully at his press
conference about the need for greater federal
support for education. He supported what he
called "opportunity for all," reassuring his au
dience that no student should be denied the

opportunity for higher education due to a lack
of personal or family funds.
Glenn also said that "for the first time in a
quarter of a century," it is now nearly impossi-'
ble for youths coming from"the lower
economic strata" to obtain a higher education
in the United States.
The country must also place a higher priority
on research if it wishes to maintain its competi
tive edge and technological lead in the world
economy, Glenn said.
Glenn, a former astronaut, observed that the
federal government has at least partially
funded most Nobel laureate research per
formed in the United States. "I can't think of
any cutbacks that are more likely to leave us
less competitive than cutbacks in education,
cutbacks in research," he said.
But Glenn angrily supported draft registra
tion laws, stating that "when it's the law of the

land that you register, then you register!
"I know that it doesn't set well on some
campuses, but I don't think that we can pick
and choose the laws that we will obey and not
obey," Glenn said.
In an exclusive Daily interview, candidate
Hollings said, "we should target science and
mathematics education." When asked whether
the federal government should increase its
support for pure research, he said, "Oh, man,
should it!"
Hollings also opposed any restrictions on the
free flow of scholarly information and research
findings, claiming that they constitute our
"best forms of diplomacy."
In addition, universities should not adminis
ter federal draft registration enforcement pro
cedures, Hollings said.
The disenchantment, lack of political par
ticipation and general political apathy of the

younger collegiate generation is largely the
fault of the generation in power, Hollings said.
"When it comes to the present federal govern
ment, student leadership on the campuses can
see through this nonsense; they (students)
don't have anything to look up to or admire,"
he said.
During his speech before the convention
Hart said that "we must recommit America to
excellence in education and make education
the highest priority for our future."
Hart attacked the education policies of the
Reagan administration by declaring that the
president had "defaulted on its obligation to
public education." He denounced the Reagan
administration for its attitude that "education
is a luxury — not a necessity — a misuse of
public funds rather than an investment for
economic opportunity."
