## Turner criticizes Reagan policies Former CIA head speaks in Branner 
### DAVID AZRIN Senior staff writer 
Former Central Intelligence Agency
Director Stansfield Turner criticized a
series of President Reagan's actions,
which he said have "unleashed" the
CIA, during a talk at Branner Hall Fri
day.
Turner called a 1981 Reagan execu
tive order that for the first time au
thorized covert operations inside the
United States a "bad move."
"It was bad from my point of view,
because they opened up the possibility
of the CIA spying on Americans. I
don't think that it was desirable or
necessary. They unleashed (the CIA)
to an extent which I think was a bad
move," he said before the audience of
120.
Turner, who headed the CIA for
three years during the Carter administ
ration, gave a brief talk and then
answered a variety of questions from
members of the audience.
Turner also said he was worried
about a "gradual erosion" of checks on
the CIA.
"The series of controls and oversight
on the intelligence process has been
weakened," he said.
"They (the CIA) need guidance.
They need some form of checks. We
have developed those. I really hope
they (Reagan administration officials)
don't weaken them further. I don't
think they have weakened them seri
ously, but I am worried about a gradual
erosion," he said.
Turner cited a number of administra
tion actions in the past two years that
have increased the power and secrecy
of the CIA.
The executive order issued in late
1981 lifted a long-standing ban on
covert operations inside the United
States, permitting physical surveillance
of U.S. residents when "significant
foreign intelligence" was sought.
In addition, the Intelligence Identifi
cation Act enacted June 23 last year
made it a crime to disclose names of
U.S. intelligence agents, even when the
information was publicly available.
According to Turner, Reagan may
have also made the CIA less accounta
ble to the National Security Council

than it was under previous administra
tions.
"The Reagan administration has
weakened this check by not wording it
quite as mandatorily, which signals to
me at least an intent not to be as strin
gent," he said.
Turner also had criticism for U.S.
military operations in Nicaragua, de
signed to curb the flow of arms ship
ments to El Salvador.
"I think it is a very ill-advised move
that the government and the CIA are
making. We have blown Central
America out of proportion in my opin
ion," he said.
Turner said that when Congress ap
propriated money for El Salvador,
Reagan was told that "none of this
money is to be used to try to destabilize
the Samoza regime."
"The administration is saying we are
making these raids to prevent the
Nicaraguans from supplying arms to
the El Salvador rebels. It's a very fine
and tenuous line. If they are down
there with the intent of destabilizing,
they are doing it against the law today,"
he said.
Turner also criticized Reagan's
Soviet-American policies, by saying
that improvements in relations bet
ween the countries are not possible in
"this administration that talks so stri
dently against the Soviet Union."
"We must maintain a line of com
munication with the Soviet Union. If
we ever get to where we really don't
understand each other and we don't
communicate at all, it could be danger
ous for the whole world," he said.
In response to a question about CIA
abuses of power, Turner said that al
though the CIA may have been guilty
of such abuses in the past, it has always
had "good motives."
"I believe that those excesses, those
improper performances and intrusions
into the life of Americans, were the
excess of the dedication and the desire
to serve the country," he said.
"The people in the CIA are not
malevolent, but secrecy in any organi
zation, in any society, breeds abuse,"
he said.
The talk was sponsored by the Stan
ford Law Forum and Branner Hall.
