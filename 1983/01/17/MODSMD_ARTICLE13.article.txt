## The 						Stanford Daily An early summer this winter 
### 
Ever since students returned to campus follow
ing winter break, the Career Planning and Place
ment Center (CPPC) has been jammed with the
curious, the highly motivated and the casually des
perate. The goal: meaningful summer employ
ment. The means: whatever is necessary. Like the
elegantly clad seniors scurrying hurriedly from one
interview to another and the freshmen who fur
tively compute their first-quarter GPA then ex
trapolate to determine their chances of obtaining
admission to law school, "internship mania" seems
indicative of a growing tendency for students to
ignore the whys of getting ahead, fixing their atten
tion on the hows.
Why all the fuss? Why the intensity? Why this
all-consuming preoccupation with the future?
Why is it already too late to apply for most pre
stigious internships in the middle of January?
These are questions for us all to consider in a
decade in which the only serious objection to the
"establishment" is that it is much too difficult for
recent college graduates to become a part of it. But
let us be frank: Daily editorial board members are
certainly not immune to the kind of thinking which
leads people to apply for 1983 summer jobs in
December of 1982.
A visitor from the '60s might well be surprised
by the mood on campus reflected by the scramble
for internships. Our visitor from the "Age of
Aquarius" would probably wonder at our narrow
focus on getting ahead, resume-packing and mak

ing "good contacts." Likewise, newly-arrived
graduate students are often taken aback by the
Stanford atmosphere, but for different reasons.
One recent arrival was heard to say: "I thought
that students here would be more relaxed, that
there would be a sense of having 'arrived.' What I
found is that Stanford is not the country club I
expected. Many here seem driven by a fear of
failure."
We do not mean to discourage the ambition of
anyone who has the drive and the determination to
succeed in a world in which success does not come
easy. And certainly, many professions are simply
impossible to enter now without a long list of work
experiences to your name.
Still, we are reminded of the scene back at the
CPPC. Students jockey for position in front of a list
of business "opportunities." In one corner, a ner
vous sophomore hunches over a worn Manila fol
der scribbling furiously on a note pad, then curses
silently when he notices that the deadline for appli
cation has already passed. Meanwhile, yet another
rejection letter is removed from a post office box
and tossed into the trash.
The job market being what it is, it is not difficult
to understand why so many students are concerned
about their futures. Doubtless, it is easier to ques
tion one's own way of life when it is secure than
when it is threatened. Nobody likes failure. But in
our rush to avoid it, perhaps we have forgotten to
define success.
