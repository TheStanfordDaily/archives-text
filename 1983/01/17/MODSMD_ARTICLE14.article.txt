## Reagan New Year resolutions 
### 
The new year brings not only new
resolutions, new hopes and new expec
tations, but new chances for our offi
cials on Capitol Hill. President Reagan,
having failed to see the light last year,
has another opportunity to make the
necessary and long-awaited adjust-

The administration, after placing its balanced
budget amendment on the backburner, is now
forecasting annual deficits in excess of $200
billion. No one knows for sure how much in
excess they will be, but all economists agree that
the figure is high.

ments to his economic recovery pro
gram. This is the year that counts. If he
demurs from quick and decisive action,
party politics will enter and bipartisan
cooperation will vanish. The president
needs to take the lead to reduce record
deficits, stifling interest rates and bloat
ed defense budgets.
The administration, after placing its
balanced budget amendment on the
back burner, is now forecasting annual
deficits in excess of $200 billion. No
one knows for sure how much in excess
they will be, but all economists agree
that the figure is high. Reagan appar
ently considers these deficits of low
priority. Strong economic recovery,
however, will not take place until the
government steps out of the financial
markets. The longer Uncle Sam con
tinues to compete with the business
sector for badly needed funds, the
longer economic stagnation will per
sist.
The obvious, though not the only,
culprit for record deficits is the Penta
gon. It is time to tread on the
sanctimonious ground of the defense
establishment. Just as a "palace coup"
was unnecessary for the president to
acquiesce to a gasoline "revenue en
hancer," there need only be some co
gent reasoning to convince Reagan that
the Pentagon can do with less. Scrap
ping the MX would be a step in the
right direction. (Pershing missiles and
Trident II submarines, deployed
shortly, should fill any possible
strategic gap.) Furthermore, the de
fense department continues to evade
close budget scrutiny. While numerous
income transfer programs, save Social
Security, and other social programs
have undergone marked reductions
and careful review, the Pentagon's
budget manages to escape such severe
questioning, let alone cutbacks.
The inflation rate, now hovering at 4
or 5 percent annually, gives further im
petus for a reduction in defense expen
ditures. With inflation having dropped
precipitously, more than anticipated,

the real rate of increase for the defense
budget shoots beyond the administra
tion's earlier target. The president may
use this reasoning to support a curtail
ment of defense funds without com
promising his basic tenet of rebuilding
the nation's defenses and standing up

to the Soviets.
If the administration chooses to
brush aside rather than tackle the roc
keting deficits and defense outlays,
high interest rates of 9 percent will con
tinue to thwart any potential economic
rebound (assuming money supply
targets aren't appreciably altered). In
vestment, choked off from the high cost
of borrowing, can be modest at best.
Treasury Secretary Donald Regan has
the right idea. Selected tax increases, or
"revenue enhancers" if you prefer, and
defense cuts would ultimately lead to

lower interest rates. That might just
spur the economic upturn we have
been waiting for.
With 10 million unemployed, how
ever, Congress will not wait long. Con
gressional pressure for make-work
programs will mount. This is no rem
edy. A long-term cure can come only
from the president's implementation of
sound economic policy and reshuffling
of priorities to ensure the normal 6,
rather than the anemic 2 , percent
post-recession growth rate. As the
economy expands, we can expect sig
nificant drop in unemployment. Fur
thermore, the drop in unemployment
benefits would mitigate the off-setting
effect rising benefits have had upon
enacted spending cuts.
Reagan must make some New
Year's resolutions; 1983 need not be a
year of sluggish growth. The opportu
nity is at hand. The American people
and most of the world are waiting.
