## Fee assessment plea: don't take Club Sports program refund 
### 
Stanford students should consider
some important points before making a
decision as to whether or not to ask for
their ASSU fee assessment refund for
club sports.
The Club Sports program is open to
any member of the Stanford commu
nity: graduate and undergraduate stu
dents, faculty and staff. There are 30
teams in all and over 1300 players. This
program allows fop a wide array of
sports which are not funded through
other areas of the athletic department.
In Club Sports, there is more opportu
nity for students to participate than in
varsity sports.
The key to club sports is that they are

all student-run organizations. The em
phasis is on student initiative: not only
in competition and performance, but
also in team management.
Club sports provide important alter
natives to varsity competition. Your
ASSU fee assessment of only $1 can go
a long way to help support students in a
wide variety of exciting athletic en
deavors.

Oxford comparison
Prof. Ronald Hilton's article,"Make
first-class Oxford students," ( Daily.

Jan. 10), may convey, inadvertently,
the idea that Stanford's commitment to
the development of a program in Ox
ford is short-termed. Stanford Over
seas Studies is constantly reviewing
Stanford's programs overseas. How
ever, our commitments to our pro
grams are. everything else being equal,
defined by their importance to the
University's academic purposes.
Everyone at Stanford recognizes that a
program at Oxford of which we can be
proud will take time to develop
through knowledge and experience.
No one at Stanford has placed a limit of
time on that development.
Hilton's other remarks about Stan

ford students and residences are a mat
ter of opinion. I live in a Stanford stu
dent residence. I do not find it
"slummy." I have lived in or visited all
the Stanford residences abroad. I have
not found them "slummy." If anything,
some of them compare favorably to
many residences on the home campus.
Finally, I have never dined, much less
lived, at San Quentin and, therefore,
have no experience of my own on the
basis of which to judge the validity of
Hilton's remarks about the charm of
meals at some of our Overseas centers.
