## Registration and U.S. values 
### 
(Editor's note: The following is an open
letter to Thomas Turnage, the director
of the Selective Service System.)
Although I have indicated on the en
closed form that I will register with the
Selective Service System ("S.S."), 1 am
doing so under protest. By not register
ing with the "S.S." for almost two
years, I hoped to revive discussion of
U.S. foreign and military policy. As an
American citizen, I feel that it is my
duty to do everything in my power to
protect American interests. Accord
ingly, I felt that not registering was the
most significant action I could take to
influence American policy makers,
hopefully bringing them back into line
with fundamental American values and
long-term interests. I also felt that not
registering was the morally right action
to take given my personal religious
convictions. As for the effectiveness of
the protest, it seems to me that the
political implications of 600,000 non
registrants certainly has sparked de
bate on re-instating the draft.
While I realize that it is registration
and not compulsory military service
that is currently being enforced, I con
tend that registration is the logical pre
, cursor to the draft and for the purposes
of protest or in-depth discussion the
two cannot be separated. Furthermore,
it seems that now would be the ideal
time to raise questions of civil liberties
violations and the direction of U .S. mil
itary policy. Often, in times of "na
tional emergency," a discussion of
these questions is pushed aside to ac
commodate military conformity and ef
ficiency.
With that in mind perhaps this letter
of protest can aid my cause. I hope to
express my outrage with the injustice of
the draft and the insane military
policies of President Reagan.
The defense of the United States is
undisputedly a public good. It follows
that such a good, which benefits all citi
zens, should be paid for by all citizens,
equally. Yet, the current draft system,
if implemented, would require
thousands of young men to "serve their
country" by giving us their personal
lives, their jobs, their families, their
liberty and their values. They would be
forced to do this for the benefit of the
majority. Thus, the system requires a
select few to "bear the burden" of a
given level of military preparedness (or
aggression).
In the case of other goods, for in
stance the space program, we expect
the costs to be distributed among the
public, since everyone benefits from
the program. We do not force a select
few to dedicate their lives and liveli
hood to the program. Instead, we en
courage potential candidates for the
program by just compensation (wages,
benefits, prestige etc.).
Then why would we not want to dis
tribute the costs of defense more equit
ably? One reason is that if costs are
distributed more equitably, they be
come more explicit and measurable in
monetary terms. Why? The more tense
the world becomes, the higher salaries
will need to be in order to attract com-

petent servicemen. This expense will
result in either larger budget deficits,
higher taxes or reduced expenditures
on non-defense goods. Americans will
be forced to make a choice. Inevitably,
they will demand a more justifiable ex
planation for a given level of defense
spending. Questions of defense waste
will be raised. Questions about as-1
sumptions held by particular adminis
trations will be raised. Concerns about
foreign policy will be voiced. Rest as
sured, when the rest of the country be
gins to feel the burden of the immense
defense programs, they too will speak
out. Maybe then they will understand
the voice of dissent expressed by
600,000 young men in this country.

The administration insists on painting the
world into a simplistic black and white, us vs.
them, good guys vs. bad guys picture. Each year
we sell more arms and provide more support /or
repressive regimes in order to ward off
'Communist aggression. 9

Indeed, the huge defense budget we
have just appropriated is largely the
result of a pay increase to servicemen in
order to attract more qualified person
nel. We are certainly attracting more
qualified personnel, but many Ameri
cans are concerned about the justifica
tions, implications and effects of such a
large defense budget.
Without a doubt, if such questions
were asked by a majority of the Ameri
can people, the Reagan administra
tion's propaganda would not hold up.
"In virtually every measure of military
power the Soviet Union enjoys a de
cided advantage," Reagan contends.
Yet the 1982 annual report issued by
the Defense Department states that a
"rough parity" exists between the
United States and the Soviet Union (in
strategic nuclear weapons). Moreover,
considering the recent innovations
such as the cruise missile, Trident sub
and Stealth bomber, and the technolog
ical superiority enjoyed by the United
States, I seriously doubt leaders in the
Kremlin believe the Soviet Union has a

decided advantage. Despite this, the
administration insists on deploying re
dundant systems such as the MX mis
sile and the B-l bomber to support its
nuclear-war fighting strategy at an
enormous cost to the U.S. economy.
In the conventional realm, the ad
ministration consistently and con
sciously fails to compare NATO forces
with the Warsaw Pact, choosing instead
to exaggerate and play up the gap be
tween the level of U.S. forces and the
level of Soviet forces. Also, our lead in
technology is often down-played.
Finally, the administration insists on
painting the world into a simplistic
black and white, us vs. them, good guys
vs. bad guys picture. Each year we sell

more arms and provide more support
for repressive regimes in order to ward
off "Communist aggression." We sup
port these regimes in blatant disregard
of the Lockean-liberal value system
that America was founded on and
without developing any workable or
constructive plan for improving de
mocracy, justice and human rights. It is
little wonder that the United States has
lost its sense of direction and self
confidence over the last decade-and
a-half.
Given its immense power
capabilities, I believe that the United
States, for both moral reasons and
long-term interests, has a responsibility
to develop constructively a more just
and equitable world. If we properly use
our power capabilities, in ways consis
tent with our value system, we will be
nefit in the long run and will come that
much closer to becoming the great na
tion we aspire to be.
