## National Jaycees attempt to prevent local chapter from admitting women 
### KRISTEN BROWN 
Although the proportional gap between pro
fessional men and women continues to narrow
in most areas of society, it has taken an about
face in the National Jaycee organization. Last
July, the National Jaycees began a lawsuit
against its Palo Alto chapter for its policy of
allowing equal membership to women.
Traditionally, the Jaycee (Junior Chamber of
Commerce) organization's purpose has been to
provide leadership training through community
service to "any man" 18 to 35 years old.
In order to integrate women into the pro
gram, the local chapter here, with the consent of
the U.S. Jaycees, devised a separate corpora
tion, called Palo Alto Young Citizens, in which
both men and women are equal voting mem
bers.
However, in 1981, the National Jaycees
claimed that Palo Alto membership policies vio
lated the organization's bylaws. State Superior
Court Judge Barton Phelps silenced the na
tional organization temporarily when he or
dered it not to interfere.
Last July, the National Jaycees broke the
court order and decided to go ahead with its
legal case against Palo Alto and three other
chapters. According to the National Jaycee pub
lic relations director Mike Fernandes, "The
issue is not about sex discrimination, but about
whether a private organization should be forced
by the courts to change its bylaws."
The National Jaycees call the suit a case of
"trademark infringement," and aim to deprive
Palo Alto Jaycees of the use of their name. They
also want to retrieve all funds the local Jaycees
have collected for community charities.
The suit was filed in federal court because
federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction in all
trademark cases.
Palo Alto Jaycees believe that they would be
more likely to get a sympathetic hearing in state
court. Steve Poizner, president of the local or
ganization, hopes that Phelps can get the case
dismissed from the federal or the state court on
grounds that the National Jaycees are in con
tempt of its 1981 court order.
If this happens, it is likely that Palo Alto
Jaycees will get what they want: the right for
each local chapter to choose its own member
ship policies.
The National Jaycees claim that bylaw in
fringement is the fundamental issue, but Palo
Alto chapter members disagree.
Said Sylvia Way, vice president: "I feel the
issue is sex discrimination, and I feel that each
local chapter should be able to choose its own
membership policies." The chapter makes it

clear that it is not proposing all Jaycees admit
women, hut that they have the option.
It is ironic that the National Jaycees singled
out their Palo Alto chapter for such a lawsuit.
At the end of October, the Palo Alto chapter
ranked third among the 235 California Jaycees
in membership, number of community service
projects and leadership training activities.
In addition, in a different convention of state
Jaycees, Poizner was voted the "most effective"
chapter president in the state.
Why don't they simply break off from the
National Jaycee organization entirely? Poizner
asserts that except for the membership policy,
they agree with the Jaycee philosophy 100 per
cent. He also admits that the chapter would not
be as strong if it were independent.
The Chicago and Los Angeles chapters did
not have as much patience. They quit the na
tional organization because of similar issues.

But the Palo Alto Jaycees decided to try to
reform the system from within. To become in
dependent might give a fleeting boost to the
equal rights movement, but because of the high
reputation the Jaycees possess across the coun
try, the possibility that women could one day be
integrated into the organization would have far
greater benefits in the long run.
So, the question remains: do the National
Jaycees have the right to take away the trade
name and the funds of Jaycee chapters who
admit women? Unless they come to some sort of
a compromise, the National Jaycee organiza
tion may turn into two groups: the chapters —
mostly large, urban organizations — that wish
to go beyond the letter of the restraining bylaws
versus the mostly small-town chapters that con
tinue to support them.
