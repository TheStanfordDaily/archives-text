## Elway and White combine for West's fireworks Illinois’ Tony Eason pulls East to last-second win 
### MARK ZEIGLER 
It was all you could ask for in a
college football All-Star game.
A last-second, game-winning
TD pass. An MVP trophy for
Stanford's own John Elway. A
78-yard TD bomb on the game's
first play. 72,000 fans. The only
thing the East-West Shrine game
committee didn't provide was a
game-ending, 80-yard rugby
style kick-off return involving a
band.
But when you talk All-Star
games, you're not talking bitter
rivalries, helmet crunching tack
les or controversial penalties.
You're talking "sweat-less"
football of the sloppy variety —
to the tune of seven fumbles, six
interceptions and two missed
PAT kicks. The teams have little
time to practice and playing as a
unit is difficult.
Despite a turnover-ridden
fourth quarter, the East team
came from behind to defeat the
West 26-25 Saturday in the 58th
annual Shrine game, the pro
ceeds of which go to San Francis
co's Shriners' Hospital for Crip

pled Children.
It was a game neither team
seemed eager to win — the two
teams turned the ball over five
times in the final 10 minutes of
play.
It took the last second heroics
of quarterback "Champaign"
Tony Eason and receiver Oliver
Williams, teammates at Illinois,
to better a West attack that fea
tured another same-team duo,
Stanford's Elway and running
back Vincent White. Jack Elway,
John's father, coached the West
squad.
Eason used a play out of the
Illinois playbook to hit Williams
at the left end zone pylon with
the winning six-yard TD pass
with 14 seconds left. The
touchdown capped a 37-yard
drive that took Eason and the
East just four plays and 27 sec
onds to complete.
"It helped having worked with
him (Williams) for three years
(at Illinois)," Eason said. "We
really had an advantage." Wil
liams ended up with seven recep
tions for 130 yards.

The West's tandem of offen
sive players from the same team
was equally potent.
Elway, the game's offensive
MVP, completed 21-of-34 pas
ses for 202 yards and one
touchdown. Six of those catches
were made by White, who also
grabbed a Steve Clarkson toss
for a 25-yard gain. The 5-foot-8,
190-pound White carried the
ball 17 times for 68 yards and
one TD, including a 20-yard
ramble in the second half.
Tight end Chris Dressel, the
third Stanford player on the
West squad, caught two Elway
passes for 15 yards.
The day ended on a scary note
for Elway, who sustained a
bruised elbow late in the game.
"It was a shock more than any
thing else when I was hit," he
said, describing how an East de
fender plugged his right arm as
he tried to throw a pass from the
West's end zone.
"I didn't see him coming and I
was awfully scared when it went
numb," Elway said. "My dad
was certainly concerned."
Elway was instrumental in
leading the West to leads of 22-7
and 25-14 after the East jumped
to a 7-0 lead just 19 seconds into
the game.
On the first play from scrim
mage, Eason fired long to a
backpedaling Mike Miller. A

world class sprinter from Ten
nessee, Miller had little trouble
outracing the coverage to the
end zone to complete the 78-
yard pass play, the longest in
Shrine game history.
The West bounced back on its
first possession, driving 71 yards
in 11 plays behind a seven-for
eight passing clinic by Elway,
who utilized all his receivers and
running backs in ways that make
pro scouts drool. Washington
State's Tim Harris, who led all

rushers with 70 yards on 14 car
ries, charged 14 yards up the
middle for the TD.
The kicking game on both
sides certainly was not all it was
cracked up to be. Washington's
Chuck Nelson, who didn't miss a
field goal or a PAT all season,
muffed two extra points Satur
day. However, PAT holder
Elway admitted Nelson's first
miss "was definitely my fault"
after bobbling the snap from
center.

lowa's Reggie Roby, whose
48.9 yards per punt average was
best in NCAA history, was less
than impressive. Although he
still managed to punt four times
and average 42.7 yards on each,
the kicks were often low line
drives that accumulated most of
their yardage bouncing
downfield.
After a Nelson 20-yard field
goal and an Elway to San Jose
State's Steve Kearse touchdown,
the West led 16-7 with 12:25 left

in the half. Three minutes later,
following a fumble recovery by
Wyoming's John Salley on the
East 33, Whie took a pitch-out at
the five and juked his way into
the end zone.
Nelson's PAT attempt went
wide left, his second miss of the
afternoon, but the West still held
a 22-7 advantage. Indiana's
Babe Laufenberg hooked up
with Miller with 1:28 left in the
half to give the East its second

CHAMPAIGN TONY: Tony Eason of Illinois led the East to a final-minute touchdown over
the West in its 26-25 win in the Annual East-West charity Shrine game held at Stanford
Stadium Saturday.
TD, making the score 22-14.
On the West's opening drive
of the second half, one that went
75 yards and ended with a 22-
yard Nelson field goal, the
"Stanford connection" on the
West squad was at its best.
Nine of the drive's 16 plays
involved only Stanford players,
with White carrying on four of
those occasions and catching
passes on two others. Elway
scrambled two times in the drive
for small gains while completing
one pass to Dressel.
Nelson's three-pointer, how
ever, was all the West could mus
ter in the second half.
"There's only so much you can
do on offense in an All-Star
game," quarterback Elway said.
"We showed them everything we
had in the first half."
Coach Elway thought the
West's problems in the second
half centered around its turnov
ers. "In the first half, we took
advantage of their mistakes," he
said, "and in the second half they
took advantage of our mis
takes."
In the final 10 minutes of the
game, the West turned the ball
over four times. In that 10-
minute period, the East put 12
unanswered points on the
scoreboard.
Kelvin Bryant, who led East
rushers with 58 yards on eight
carries, scored his only
touchdown with 8:18 remaining
on a 12-yard run.
San Jose State's Clarkson, El
way's back-up, had a miserable
afternoon, especially in the
fourth quarter. The Spartan QB
completed only one of eight pas

ses and had three passes picked
off in the final 10 minutes.
Behind 25-20 with 4:27 re
maining, the East drove 52 yards
to the West's five. With Eason
and Laufenberg alternating at
quarterback, the East had four
chances to punch it into the end
zone for the go-ahead score.
Neither QB was effective.
On first down, Eason threw
low to Williams, who was open in
the end zone. On second,
Laufenberg fumbled and reco
vered the snap. Eason threw in
tentionally out-of-bounds on
third down after being chased
out of the pocket. And on fourth
and goal from the seven,
Laufenberg's pass to Miller went
wide.
Eason and the East had an ear
lier chance to score with 6:04 left
in the fourth quarter. But a pass
intended for Williams was inter
cepted in the West's end zone by
Arizona State's Paul Moyer, the
game's co-defensive MVP. The
play was similar to the one Eason
and Williams later used to score
the game winning TD.
The East got its final chance
with 41 seconds left after forcing
Nelson to punt from his own end
zone, and drove 37 yards in four
plays for the winning six.
ASU's Moyer and Louisiana
State's James Britt, both defen
sive backs, were named co
defensive MVPs. Notre Dame
linebacker Mark Zavagnin re
corded 10 tackles for the East
while Oregon linebacker Mike
Walter played outstanding de
fense for the West.
The 72,000 fans on hand were
amazingly quiet and appeared
disinterested with the game on
the field. The biggest cheers

came after score updates from
the Raiders-Jets game in Los
Angeles.
Krazy George, a professional
cheerleader who works for the
Oakland A's, Minnesota Vikings

and Houston Oilers, donated his
services free to the Shriners. At
one point in the second half, he
divided the stadium into four
sections, with each one shouting
"Go" in turn.
