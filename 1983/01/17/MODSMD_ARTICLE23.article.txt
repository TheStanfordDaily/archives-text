# Card sharpshooters at Cal tonight
## 
### STEVE ODELL 
Stanford, the best field goal
shooting team in the country,
will be looking for its first
Pacific-10 conference win
over a team other than the
Oregon Ducks in more than a
year when it travels to Ber
keley tonight to face Califor
nia in an 8 p.m. conference
game at Harmon Gym.
The Cardinal, 9-3 after
splitting a pair of games in the
Beaver State last weekend, is
the hottest shooting team in
the nation by virtue of its
record-setting performance
in its 80-74 victory against
UO, which Stanford beat for
the sixth straight time. The
Cardinal shot an incredible
76.9 percent from the floor,
breaking the conference
shooting record and raising its
seasonal mark to 57.6. Stan
ford also hit 57.1 percent of
its field goal attempts in its
62-53 loss to Oregon State.
The main reason for the
Card's incredible marksman
ship to date has been its abil
ity to get the ball inside —
either by passing, usually to
center John Revelli, or penet
rating the middle or the
baseline — for easy buckets.
Revelli is the Pac-10 slead
ing scorer (21.2 points per
game) and field goal shooter
(67.2 percent) and fourth in
the conference in rebounding
(8.5 rebounds per game). The
6-foot-8 junior made 17-of
-19 attempts from the floor
against the Oregon schools to
lead the Cardinal's sizzle pat
rol.
California, 6-4, is having an
up-and-down year. In the
conference's opening
weekend, the Bears dropped
a sloppy, poorly-played over
time contest to UO 69-67,
then came back two nights
later to defeat three-time de
fending league champion
Oregon State 62-53. The
Bears demolished an under
manned UC-Davis squad
Thursday night.
The Bears should play
primarily a zone defense, at
tempting to deny the ball in -
side to Revelli by collapsing
on the Card center and
double-teaming him. A Bear
zone will also force Stanford
to shoot from the perimeter,
which the Cardinal has done
very little this season.

The key match-up will be
Revelli against Cal's Michael
Pitts, a 6-11 center who is
leading the Bears in scoring
(16.7 points per game) and on
the boards (7.1 rebounds per
game). Pitts was named the
Pac-10 player of the week for
his performance last
weekend, primarily against
OSU when he went 1 l-for-15
from the floor, scoring 27
points and wiping the win
dows for 11 rebounds.
Revel li is the stronger per
former inside, while Pitts will
probably try to pull him cut
side and hit his mid-range
jump shot.
If Pitts is the Bears' leader
in statistics, guard Michael
Chavez is Cal's leader in
every other definition of the
word. Chavez, who it seems
has been playing for Berkeley
coach Dick Kuchen since the
end of the war, possesses a
deadly outside jumper and is
averaging 13.9 points per
game. Chavez is the confer
ence leader in free throw
shooting at 90 percent.
Cal goes as Chavez goes, so
whichever Card draws him in
his defensive assignment,
probably Steve Brown, will
have to contain the 5-9
senior, keep a hand in his face
on his perimeter shot while
also stopping his dish-off
drives to the basket.
The Bears' other guard,
6-4 junior Butch Hays, is
scoring at a 10.4 clip and lead
ing the conference in steals at
2.4 per game. At the forwards
are 6-7 senior Darrell Haley,
averaging 7.4 points per
game, and 6-8 freshman
Dave Butler, who checks in at
6-7.
While guard and center will
be the most anticipated and
well-defined match-ups, for
ward should be the most in
teresting. Cal is thinnest at
the forward position after
Pitts was forced to move to
center after now-NBA center
Mark McNamara, who led
the Pac-10 in scoring and re
bounding a year ago,
graduated.
Stanford, meanwhile,
showed good depth and solid
performances down the line
at the corners in last
weekend's games. Stanford
coach Tom Davis said
freshman forward Earl

Koberlein had his "career
game" in the win over the
Ducks while both Hans
Wichary and Johnny Rogers
looked good coming off the
bench. Wichary muscled in
side to hit a season-high 14
points while Rogers de
monstrated the shooting
touch which earned him
1981-82 Rookie of the Year
honors. That touch could be
important if Cal does indeed
play a tightly-packed zone de
fense.
Sixth man Keith Jones con
tinues to be the Card's second
leading scorer, pouring
through 16.6 points per con
test, while freshman guard
Keith Ramee has passed off
for 54 assists, an average of
more than four a game.
Davis continues to start

three freshmen, forwards
Koberlein and Andy Fischer
among them. Koberlein
nailed down a career-high 13
points against UO and
Fischer is one of the best
blood 'n' guts players in the
league since Oregon's Mike
Drummond graduated.
Cal defeated Stanford both
times the arch-rivals met last
season, 78-59 in Harmon
Gym and 48-36 in Maples
Pavilion. The Bears lead the
series 119-79, with the Car
dinal's last victory coming in
the final game of the 1980-81
season, 81-72 at home.
The game tonight will be
televised as the Pac-10 Mon
day Night game of the week,
while both KSFO (560 AM)
and KZSU (90.1 FM) will
carry the contest on radio.

ZEROING IN ON CAL: Stanford's John Revelli sets for a
free throw in action earlier this year. Revelli leads the
conference in scoring and shooting accuracy and is the
main force in the Cardinal offense.
