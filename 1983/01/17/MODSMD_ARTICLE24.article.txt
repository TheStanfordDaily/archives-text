# Card women split weekend series
## 
### LIBBY LEONARD 
Coming close counts in horseshoes but not in basketball. The
Cardinal women's basketball team knows this all too well, after
narrowly falling to Fullerton State 69-68 last Friday.
The loss dropped the Card to 0-2 in the Western Collegiate Athle
tic Association. UCLA squeezed past the Card 70-68, in its first
conference game two weeks ago.
Fullerton was forced to rely on its outside game because the Card
effectively shutdown its fast break. Showing no reluctance, Fullerton
fired up 64 shots, many from long range. Stanford worked the ball
inside and connected on 26 of 48 shots from the field.
The score seasawed in the opening quarters, but Fullerton held a
slim lead throughout the second half. In the decisive fourth quarter,
Fullerton sunk six long-range field goals which helped lay the Card's
chances to rest.
Several Fullerton shot attempts were aided by the iron, one crucial
shot hitting the back rim, bouncing six feet into the air and then

falling in.
"(Fullerton) shot out of their minds in the last five minutes," said
Stanford coach Dotty McCrea. "They must be going tr. the right
church."
The Card's lack of dominance on the defensive boards allowed
Fullerton to retrieve several costly offensive rebounds in the first
half. Stanford was so weak on the boards that 5-foot-2 guard Virginia
Sourlis led the Card with seven boards.
Turnovers in key situations also hindered the Card. Sloppy bal
lhandling and untimely passes by Stanford guards accounted for 11 of
Stanford's 17 turnovers.
Although seniors Meg Metzger and Jeanne Ruark-Hoff finished
with impressive statistics, their solo efforts were not enough. Metzger
went 10-for-l 3 from the field for 23 points and Ruark-Hoff tallied 20
points. No other Card could manage more than eight points.
"Playing well and losing by one, just isn't good enough," remarked
McCrea. "We have to play to win."
Unfortunately for the Card, conference competition is only going
to get tougher in the weeks ahead. No. 1 USC awaits the Card. So do
Arizona State and Long Beach State, which are also ranked in the
nation's Top Twenty. The WCAA is regarded as a powerhouse
throughout the country; yet McCrea still believes the Card "will win
its share of games in the league."
On Saturday, Stanford made a tremendous comeback and edged
an inferior UC-Irvine team 65-62 in a non-conference game. The
contest should not have been close, but the Card came out cold and
fell behind by 14. As the Card's shooting warmed up, Irvine's lead
slowly melted in the second half.
"We played with unbelievable poise in the end," McCrea com
mented.
Sophomore Mary Bradach, a reserve guard, "made the difference
in the game," according to McCrea. Bradach grabbed two important
rebounds and sunk three of four free throws in the high-pressured
fourth quarter. "That kind of bench support is what we need on a
regular basis," said McCrea.
Again Metzger and Ruark-Hoff carried the bulk of the Card's
scoring load. Metzger chipped in 23 points and Ruark-Hoff followed
with 15. Senior guard Angie Paccione took advantage of Irvine's
sagging defensive zone and hit four outside jump shots.
McCrea would like to see more scoring from senior center Kim
Kupferer. "We need the front line to score in double figures," said
McCrea. Kupferer retired with just seven points against Irvine in a
dormant performance.
The Card hosts Arizona State in Maples Pavilion Thursday at 5:45
p.m. Arizona State's No. 10 ranking should drop in this week's poll
after the Sun Devils loss to UCLA and USC last weekend.
