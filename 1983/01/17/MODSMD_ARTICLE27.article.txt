# Levy leads Stanford to win
## 
### SARAH CARREL 
The Stanford gymnastics
teams met with three strong op
ponents Friday night in Maples
Pavilion, and came away with
two victories.
The Cardinal men defeated
Cal State-Fullerton by a score of
262.15 to 256.25, while Arizona
State topped the triangular meet
with 267.35 points. On the
women's board, Stanford easily
downed the University of Al
berta by the score of 163.60 to
150.55.
The Cardinal men were led by
two outstanding freshmen, Jon
Levy and Gary Smith. Levy
walked away with the all-around
by scoring his personal best of
55.50 in the six events. Except
for a slip on the pommel horse,
Levy's scores in each event were
well above the 9.0 (out of 10)
point mark.
"Breaking 54 means a lot to a
gymnast because it means he's
averaging more than 9.0," head
coach Sadao Hamada said. A
close second in the men's all

around was Smith, who scored a
total of 53.65. He was followed
by Tom Pace of Fullerton, who
finished with 52.5 points.
Stanford felt acutely the loss of
veteran performer Jim Cam
panelli, who was out with an arm
injury. Campanelli helps provide
the consistency that Stanford
needs, and Hamada expressed
the hope that he will be back in
action for next week's crucial
meeting with Berkeley.
Consistency was definitely the
major factor deployed by ASU.
Although the Sun Devils did not
place any gymnasts in the top
all-around rankings, their consis
tently strong performances from
all team members in all events
kept them ahead for most of the
meet.
For the Cardinal, the strongest
event was the vault. "Everybody
hit tonight," said Hamada. Not a
single Cardinal score in the event
was below 9.0. Junior Ed Gres
ser was particularly strong, and
in his other specialty, the floor

exercise, he averaged a 9.5 from
the two judges.
Another promising individual
performer for Stanford was
rookie Brian Nelson, who
showed strength in both the high
bar and the pommel horse. "He
shows a great deal of potential,"
said Hamada.
Although there were some
bright spots in the evening, the
men's performance was not quite
up-to-par." We are looking to go
to the NCAA championships,"
said Hamada. "To do that, we
should be 270 or above, and we
did not do that today, so I was a
little disappointed. We need to
improve our weak areas and get
our routines together to beat
Cal." Stanford faces the Bears at
Maples Pavilion Jan. 21 at 7:30
p.m.
The women's meet was the
first for new coach Homer Sar
dina. Despite the lopsided vic
tory, he felt the women, too,
were not working up to poten
tial.
t Stanford was hurt by the ab
sence of all-around performer
jCarolyn Tarkington, whose spot
was filled by junior Caryn
Lucido. "We were off what we
expected," said Sardina, "be
cause you just can't replace a
Carolyn Tarkington in one day,
although Lucido did an outstand
ing job."
The Cardinal's strongest
events were the uneven parallel
bars and the vault, where gym
nasts averaged well over 8.0
points. Exciting freshman Pam
Blom topped the scoring in the
bars by successfully completing
three front somersaults. "I was

nervous," said Blom, who is only
working out every other day be
cause of a bad back. "But there
was a lot of team support."
Another solid new performer
is sophomore Vicky Worden,
who moved up to the team this
year for her first competition
after being taught the sport in
gymnastics classes last year.
"That (her improvement) is hard
to belive," said Sardina.
Topping the women's all
around was Alberta's Heidi
Ross, followed by less than a
point by Stanford's Angie
Barnes. Julie Bledsoe, the Car
dinal's most consistent per

former, was third.
If there was a weak event for
the women, it was the balance
beam. Stanford compiled a total
of 20 falls in this event, making
the beam a target for improve
ment.
The women will be meeting
UC-Santa Barbara this Saturday
for their first meet away from
home, and Sardina is looking
forward to a very strong season.
."This is an amazing team," he
said of the Cardinal, which is
composed of an interesting blend
of veterans and beginners.
"They've got a lot of promise,"
he said.

injury. Campanelli helps provide
the consistency that Stanford
needs, and Hamada expressed
the hope that he will be back in
action for next week's crucial
meeting with Berkeley.
Consistency was definitely the
major factor deployed by ASU.
Although the Sun Devils did not
place any gymnasts in the top
all-around rankings, their consis
tently strong performances from
all team members in all events
kept them ahead for most of the
meet.
For the Cardinal, the strongest
event was the vault. "Everybody
hit tonight," said Hamada. Not a
single Cardinal score in the event
was below 9.0. Junior Ed Gres
ser was particularly strong, and
in his other specialty, the floor

exercise, he averaged a 9.5 from
the two judges.
Another promising individual
performer for Stanford was
rookie Brian Nelson, who
showed strength in both the high
bar and the pommel horse. "He
shows a great deal of potential,"
said Hamada.
Although there were some
bright spots in the evening, the
men's performance was not quite
up-to-par." We are looking to go
to the NCAA championships,"
said Hamada. "To do that, we
should be 270 or above, and we
did not do that today, so I was a
little disappointed. We need to
improve our weak areas and get
our routines together to beat
Cal." Stanford faces the Bears at
Maples Pavilion Jan. 21 at 7:30
p.m.
The women's meet was the
first for new coach Homer Sar
dina. Despite the lopsided vic
tory, he felt the women, too,
were not working up to poten
tial.
t Stanford was hurt by the ab
sence of all-around performer
jCarolyn Tarkington, whose spot
was filled by junior Caryn
Lucido. "We were off what we
expected," said Sardina, "be
cause you just can't replace a
Carolyn Tarkington in one day,
although Lucido did an outstand
ing job."
The Cardinal's strongest
events were the uneven parallel
bars and the vault, where gym
nasts averaged well over 8.0
points. Exciting freshman Pam
Blom topped the scoring in the
bars by successfully completing
three front somersaults. "I was

nervous," said Blom, who is only
working out every other day be
cause of a bad back. "But there
was a lot of team support."
Another solid new performer
is sophomore Vicky Worden,
who moved up to the team this
year for her first competition
after being taught the sport in
gymnastics classes last year.
"That (her improvement) is hard
to belive," said Sardina.
Topping the women's all
around was Alberta's Heidi
Ross, followed by less than a
point by Stanford's Angie
Barnes. Julie Bledsoe, the Car
dinal's most consistent per

former, was third.
If there was a weak event for
the women, it was the balance
beam. Stanford compiled a total
of 20 falls in this event, making
the beam a target for improve
ment.
The women will be meeting
UC-Santa Barbara this Saturday
for their first meet away from
home, and Sardina is looking
forward to a very strong season.
."This is an amazing team," he
said of the Cardinal, which is
composed of an interesting blend
of veterans and beginners.
"They've got a lot of promise,"
he said.

DEAD RINGER: Freshman Jon Levy scored a personal-best 55.50 to capture first place in the
all-around as Stanford finished second to Arizona State in a tri-meet Friday nignt.
The Stanford gymnastics
teams met with three strong op
ponents Friday night in Maples
Pavilion, and came away with
two victories.
The Cardinal men defeated
Cal State-Fullerton by a score of
262.15 to 256.25, while Arizona
State topped the triangular meet
with 267.35 points. On the
women's board, Stanford easily
downed the University of Al
berta by the score of 163.60 to
150.55.
The Cardinal men were led by
two outstanding freshmen, Jon
Levy and Gary Smith. Levy
walked away with the all-around
by scoring his personal best of
55.50 in the six events. Except
for a slip on the pommel horse,
Levy's scores in each event were
well above the 9.0 (out of 10)
point mark.
"Breaking 54 means a lot to a
gymnast because it means he's
averaging more than 9.0," head
coach Sadao Hamada said. A
close second in the men's all

around was Smith, who scored a
total of 53.65. He was followed
by Tom Pace of Fullerton, who
finished with 52.5 points.
Stanford felt acutely the loss of
veteran performer Jim Cam
panelli, who was out with an arm
injury. Campanelli helps provide
the consistency that Stanford
needs, and Hamada expressed
the hope that he will be back in
action for next week's crucial
meeting with Berkeley.
