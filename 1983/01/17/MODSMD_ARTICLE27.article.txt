# Levy leads Stanford to win

### SARAH CARREL 
The Stanford gymnastics
teams met with three strong op
ponents Friday night in Maples
Pavilion, and came away with
two victories.
The Cardinal men defeated
Cal State-Fullerton by a score of
262.15 to 256.25, while Arizona
State topped the triangular meet
with 267.35 points. On the
women's board, Stanford easily
downed the University of Al
berta by the score of 163.60 to
150.55.
The Cardinal men were led by
two outstanding freshmen, Jon
Levy and Gary Smith. Levy
walked away with the all-around
by scoring his personal best of
55.50 in the six events. Except
for a slip on the pommel horse,
Levy's scores in each event were
well above the 9.0 (out of 10)
point mark.
"Breaking 54 means a lot to a
gymnast because it means he's
averaging more than 9.0," head
coach Sadao Hamada said. A
close second in the men's all

around was Smith, who scored a
total of 53.65. He was followed
by Tom Pace of Fullerton, who
finished with 52.5 points.
Stanford felt acutely the loss of
veteran performer Jim Cam
panelli, who was out with an arm
injury. Campanelli helps provide
the consistency that Stanford
needs, and Hamada expressed
the hope that he will be back in
action for next week's crucial
meeting with Berkeley.
Consistency was definitely the
major factor deployed by ASU.
Although the Sun Devils did not
place any gymnasts in the top
all-around rankings, their consis
tently strong performances from
all team members in all events
kept them ahead for most of the
meet.
For the Cardinal, the strongest
event was the vault. "Everybody
hit tonight," said Hamada. Not a
single Cardinal score in the event
was below 9.0. Junior Ed Gres
ser was particularly strong, and
in his other specialty, the floor

exercise, he averaged a 9.5 from
the two judges.
Another promising individual
performer for Stanford was
rookie Brian Nelson, who
showed strength in both the high
bar and the pommel horse. "He
shows a great deal of potential,"
said Hamada.
Although there were some
bright spots in the evening, the
men's performance was not quite
up-to-par." We are looking to go
to the NCAA championships,"
said Hamada. "To do that, we
should be 270 or above, and we
did not do that today, so I was a
little disappointed. We need to
improve our weak areas and get
our routines together to beat
Cal." Stanford faces the Bears at
Maples Pavilion Jan. 21 at 7:30
p.m.
The women's meet was the
first for new coach Homer Sar
dina. Despite the lopsided vic
tory, he felt the women, too,
were not working up to poten
tial.
