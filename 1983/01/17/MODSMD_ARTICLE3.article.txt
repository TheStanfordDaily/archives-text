### SANDRA BODOVITZ Staff writer 
Speakers ranging from a prime
minister to an investment firm
executive discussed the potential
recovery from the present world re
cession and other topics at the day
long Conference on International
Business in Developing Countries
Saturday at the Business School.
Emphasizing the need for foreign
investment in the Caribbean and the
seriousness with which develop
ment projects are being underta
ken, Jamaican Prime Minister Ed
ward Seaga said, "Let me then
suggest that if the image of the
Caribbean in the past was that busi
ness was mainly pleasure, it is cer
tainly time now to change that per
ception. The business of the Carib
bean. like that of America, is busi
ness." '»»»'•'
"The economic and development
model to be found in the majority of
the English speaking islands today is
the one that is most compatible with
the political and social needs and
instincts of the region," Seaga said.
"Public sector investment is used to
build the infrastructure and to
stimulate development in the slower
growing traditional sectors, while
the private sector is encouraged to
expand and develop the modern in
dustrial sector which can respond
more rapidly and dynamically."
The day-long conference opened
with a welcoming address by Busi
ness School Dean Robert Jaedicke.
Prof. Gerald Meier gave an opening
address entitled "Evolution of at
titudes: from the 1960s to the
1980s." This was followed by a
panel discussion on the "Dilemmas
of private investment: current

perspectives."
The first panel member to speak
was Carlos Caballero of Colombia.
Caballero said that controls over
foreign investment such as those
that were implemented in Colombia
in 1967, and the decline of the world
economy as a whole, were responsi
ble for the decline in foreign in
vestment interest in developing
countries in recent years.
"World trade is not growing. This
has meant that the exports of Latin
America are growing very slowly
and the growth of their economies is
being severely affected," he said.
Prof. Elliot Berg, an economic
consultant for governments and in
ternational organizations and a
former consultant for the World
Bank and the International Monet
ary Fund, addressed the problems
of the poorer developing countries,
particularly those in the sub-
Saharan region of Africa. Berg said
that "severe organizational re
straints" as the result of bureaucra
tic decision-making hindered ad
vancement in these areas.
Rodney Wagner, a senior vice
president of Morgan Guaranty
Trust Company, noted the poor per
formance of the world economy as a
major factor in the decline in bank
loans to developing nations. Money
in the economy as a whole is "mov
ing more slowly" and banks are
therefore "cutting down on lending
to LDOs," he said.
The short-run loans already
granted to many of these nations
have not been repaid and this gen
erates "a lack of confidence in these
countries," according to Wagner.'
"The only way out is growth,"
Wagner said.
