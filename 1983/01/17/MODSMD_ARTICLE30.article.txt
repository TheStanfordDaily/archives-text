Three Sigma Alpha Epsion pledges
in the process of cleaning up after
painting the huge"C on the hill above
Cal's Memorial Stadium cardinal red
were arrested by UC'-Berkcley Police
early Saturday morning and charged
with "trespassing and malicious dam
age to university property," according
to C'al spokesman Charles Hurley.
The three — identified by a fellow
pledge to be Dave Youmans, Todd
Vanye and Dave Godat — were re
leased on citation later Saturday and
must appear in court later this month to
face charges.
According to another SAE pledge
who declined to release his name, the
prank was part of "Hell Week" tests in
which 25 pledges spent an entire night
touring the Bay Area and performing
various stunts such as giving a Bruce
Springsteen concert in Ghirardelli
square and stealing back a brass bell
from the Cal SAE chapter.
The pledges had been planning the
prank for the last week, according to
the source, and were equipped with
vans, CB radios, eight gallons Of paint
and nine brooms when they ap
proached the hill about 6a.m. Saturday
morning. Police followed soon after at
about 6:30 a.m.
"I guess they just heard 25 people
rummaging through the woods," said
the pledge. "Some of us didn't even
find the 'C.' It was pitch black."
