Lobbyists attack Social Security reform
Washington â€” Powerful interest groups pledged yesterday to seek changes
in a bipartisan plan for bailing out the Social Security system, despite grudg
ing support for the delicate package from President Reagan, congressional
leaders and a reform commission.
Organizations representing retired people, government workers and small
business said they opposed some or all of the $169 billion package designed
to keep Social Security solvent until 1990. Legislators and members of the
Social Security reform commission who drafted the plan acknowledged that
gaining congressional approval will not be easy.
After the reform commission voted 12-3 Saturday night to accept the
package, Republican economist Alan Greenspan, the panel chairman, said,
"All of us swallowed very hard and accepted individual notions that we per

President Reagan agreed "it includes elements which each of us could not

"Meet the Press" that the legislation must pass Congress and be signed into
law May 7 so that the government can make the changes in benefit tables to
reflect the proposed delay in the July cost-of-living increase.
"There's no question that you cannot go from a piece of paper, which is
basically what this is, into legislative format without hearings, markup ses
sions in the Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Commit
tee," Greenspan said on Cable News Network's "Newsmaker-Sunday,"
The most controversial provisions of the compromise include a speed-up
in scheduled increases in the payroll tax, taxing benefits received by upper
and middle-income retirees, a one-time six-month delay in this July's cost
of-living increase and an expansion of Social Security coverage to new feder
al employees starting in 1984.
Mo Biller, president of the 320,000-member American Postal Workers
Union, vowed a strong lobbying campaign to drop the provision bringing
federal workers under Social Security.
AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland, one of the reform commission mem
bers, supported the overall package, but added he also opposed making cov
erage of federal emplovees mandatory.
John Cosgrove, a spokesman for the Fund for Assuring an Independent
Retirement (FAIR), said the 26 national organizations of federal and postal
employees which belong to the group also would be lobbying against the
