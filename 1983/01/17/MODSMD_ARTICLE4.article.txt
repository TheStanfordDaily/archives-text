Lobbyists attack Social Security reform
Washington — Powerful interest groups pledged yesterday to seek changes
in a bipartisan plan for bailing out the Social Security system, despite grudg
ing support for the delicate package from President Reagan, congressional
leaders and a reform commission.
Organizations representing retired people, government workers and small
business said they opposed some or all of the $169 billion package designed
to keep Social Security solvent until 1990. Legislators and members of the
Social Security reform commission who drafted the plan acknowledged that
gaining congressional approval will not be easy.
After the reform commission voted 12-3 Saturday night to accept the
package, Republican economist Alan Greenspan, the panel chairman, said,
"All of us swallowed very hard and accepted individual notions that we per
sonally did not actually support."
President Reagan agreed "it includes elements which each of us could not
support if they were not part of a bipartisan compromise."
But the fight over the package may just be beginning.
Senate Finance Committee Chairman Bob Dole (R-Kan.) said on NBC's
"Meet the Press" that the legislation must pass Congress and be signed into
law May 7 so that the government can make the changes in benefit tables to
reflect the proposed delay in the July cost-of-living increase.
"There's no question that you cannot go from a piece of paper, which is
basically what this is, into legislative format without hearings, markup ses
sions in the Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Commit
tee," Greenspan said on Cable News Network's "Newsmaker-Sunday,"
The most controversial provisions of the compromise include a speed-up
in scheduled increases in the payroll tax, taxing benefits received by upper
and middle-income retirees, a one-time six-month delay in this July's cost
of-living increase and an expansion of Social Security coverage to new feder
al employees starting in 1984.
Mo Biller, president of the 320,000-member American Postal Workers
Union, vowed a strong lobbying campaign to drop the provision bringing
federal workers under Social Security.
AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland, one of the reform commission mem
bers, supported the overall package, but added he also opposed making cov
erage of federal emplovees mandatory.
John Cosgrove, a spokesman for the Fund for Assuring an Independent
Retirement (FAIR), said the 26 national organizations of federal and postal
employees which belong to the group also would be lobbying against the
Court approves k 6O Minutes' segment
New Orleans — A federal appeals court yesterday ruled that a
"60 Minutes" segment on alleged New Orleans police brutality
may he shown on television in Dallas, where seven officers go on
trial next month.
Not long afterward, U.S. Supreme Court Justice Byron White
refused a request bv attornevs for the officers to reinstate a ban
against showing the program in Dallas. The attorneys then ap
plied to Chief Justice Warren Burger, who denied their appeal
without comment, said court spokeswoman Tom House.
A federal district judge had first ordered CBS not to broadcast
the segment nationwide as scheduled last night, but the ruling
was overturned Saturdav by the sth U.S. Circuit Court of Ap
peals in New Orleans. The district judge then ordered only that
the show be banned in Dallas, and that ruling was blocked by the
appeals court vesterdav.
Seven New Orleans officers charged with civil rights violations
are to stand trial in Dallas beginning Feb. 7.
The trial and the "60 Minutes" broadcast concern the 1980 po
lice inquiry into the slaving of New Orleans police officer
Gregory Neupert.
Four black residents of New Orleans' Algiers neighborhood
were killed by police during the investigation. Police said all four
were killed while shooting or reaching for weapons.
A federal grand jury found no wrongdoing in the police shoot
ings, but indicted seven officers on charges of violating witnesses'
civil rights. The police are accused of abusing witnesses during
interrogation bv beating and kicking them and placing plastic
bags over their heads to choke off their air.
The shootings sparked months of racial discord and led to the
resignation of Police Superintendent James Parsons.
Attorneys for the officers won a motion to move the trial to
Dallas, contending that broadcasting the segment before the trial
began would make it impossible to find an impartial jury.
But the sth Circuit ruled yesterday that U.S. District Judge
.Adrian Duplantier in New Orleans was wrong in deciding that
broadcasting the show in Dallas would prejudice potential
jurors.
Arms proposal factor in Rostow ouster
Washington — Former Arms Control and Disarmament
Agency Director Eugene Rostow was reprimanded last summer
for exceeding his authority because he privately explored a Sovi
et proposal for reducing Europe-based nuclear missiles, an inci
dent that was "certainly a factor" in his ouster, a senior Reagan
administration official said yesterday.
But the official, who spoke to a reporter on condition that he
not be identified, said the incident, first disclosed last September
by Rostow's conservative Republican opponents in the Senate,
was merely symptomatic of the bureaucratic strains that led to
President Reagan's decision to seek his resignation last week.
According to reports that surfaced in mid-September, Rostow
interposed his own authority during a trip to Geneva las> July
and encouraged the U.S. negotiator, Paul Nitze, to explore a So
viet offer to reduce missiles aimed at Europe but still allow sever
al hundred more than the zero limit sought by the adminis
tration.
Rostow's action led to his being reprimanded by White House
national security adviser William Clark in a memorandum to
Secretarv of State George Shultz. The incident was reported by
participants in a campaign led by Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.), to
block confirmation of two Rostow aides to high positions in the
arms control agency.
China offers Cambodian deal
Washington — As part of the secret dialogue between the
giants of communism, China has proposed to the Soviet Union a
plan for phased settlement of the Cambodian conflict, according
to reports reaching official Washington.
The Chinese plan reportedly was submitted to Soviet Deputy
Foreign Minister Leonid Ilvichev last October in Peking. There

ports «,aid it calls for a complete withdrawal by Vietnamese
troops from Cambodia over an unspecified "reasonable period
ol time m return tor a corresponding gradual improvement in
Chinese-Vietnamese relations.
1 here was no indication, according to U.S. and Asian diplo
matic sources, that China explicitlv held out the prospect of re
ducing its pressure on Vietnam by withdrawing some of its
300.000 troops from positions near the Sino-Vietnamese border
or scaling back Chinese support for the anti-Vietnamese guer
rillas of Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot.
I he C hinese are reported to have told the Soviets that a neu
tral and non-aligned Cambodia would be acceptable to Peking
alter wi-thdrawal of Vietnamese forces. This is a stand that Pe
king has adopted gradually in recent months.
I he reports reaching here are that the Soviets initially rebuffed
the C hinese initiative, saving that "you are talking to the wrong
part\ and indicating that responsibility for Cambodia lies with
the \ ietnamese. However, the Chinese are said to have insisted
that they were talking to the right people because, in their view,
the Soviets, as sponsors of the Vietnamese, are basically respon
sible.
The Chinese position appears to represent more flexible tactics
but an essentially unchanged strategic posture regarding Cam
bodia. Nonetheless, it is considered significant and perhaps even
important that they have taken it directly to the Soviets in diplo
matic discussions.
The Chinese are reported to expect a serious response in time,
perhaps in the next round of Sino-Soviet talks scheduled in Mos
cow early in March.
Israel approves 2 West Bank settlements
Jerusalem — The Israeli government settlement committee
vesterdav voted to establish two new Jewish outposts in the oc
cupied West Bank and two others nearby on the Israeli side of the
pre-1967 border.
All four new communities are in the Mount Hebron area south
of the mostly Arab town of Hebron. The area is bisected by the
"green line" which separated Israel from the Jordanian-held
West Bank of the Jordan River before Israel seized the territory
in the Six Day War of 1967.
It was the second time since Sept. 1, when President Reagan
called for a freeze on Jewish settlement activity in the West Bank
and the Gaza Strip, that the committee voted to establish new
settlements. It created eight new outposts and reconfirmed four
others, all in occupied territories, in September.
In addition to the four new settlements, the committee on yes
terday selected a permanent location for another community
that had been authorized earlier. This one is on the Israel side of
the green line.
Presiding over the meeting was the committee's acting chair
man, Science and Technology Minister Yuval Neeman, head of
the right wing Tehiva Partv, which was created to oppose Israel's
withdrawal from the Sinai. Since the Sinai was returned to Egypt
last year, the party has championed settlement activity in the
West Bank and Gaza.
A spokesman for Neeman said that no date has been set to be
gin construction of the new settlements. He could give no esti
mate of the cost of the projects because a separate committee
handles appropriations.
"There was no discussion of money today," the spokesman
said. "Those attending the meeting had the map out and they dis
cussed yvhere to put the dots."
Israel hopes to increase the Jewish population of the West
Bank and Gaza to about 100,000 by the middle of this decade.
About 1.2 million Palestinian Arabs live in the two territories
which, together, are the size of Delaware.
Officials of Prime Minister Menachem Begin's government
have made no secret of their determination to retain Israeli con
trol over the two territories that they consider part of the biblical
land of Israel. The officials say that one reason for encouraging
Jewish settlement is to make it more difficult for any future gov
ernment to yield the area as part of a territory-for-peace swap,
such as the one Israel made in its peace treaty with Egypt.

Turkish crash kills 40
Ankara, Turkey — A Turkish Airlines jet carrying 67 passen
gers and crew members crashed while landing in a snow storm at
Ankara's airport yesterday and at least 40 people were killed, au
thorities reported.
They said 22 others were hospitalized and a few escaped with
only slight injuries.
I he semi-official Anatolia News Agency said the Boeing 727,
arriv ing Irom Istanbul with 60 passengers and a crew of seven,
struck the edge of the runway and broke into two sections. The
rear section then burst into flames, it reported.
Government officials said there were two foreign passengers
aboard. One was listed as a British citizen and the other as a Ro
manian, but further identification was*not available.
The officials said most of the survivors were rescued from the
front section of the craft. All of the crew members — two pilots, a
navigator and four stewardesses — were among the survivors,
airport sources said.
One of the dead was identified as Prof. Feyzi Feyzioglu, a
member of the consultative assembly established by Turkey's
martial-law government.
In Los Angeles, a main wheel assembly on a New York-bound
American Airlines 747 passenger jet collapsed just before takeoff
Irom Los Angeles International Airport early yesterday, forcing
evacuation of the plane, authorities said. No injuries were re
ported.
Nakasone visits Washington
1 okyo — Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone, apparently de
termined to use his bold style of leadership to improve badly
strained ties with the United States, leaves today for his first of
ficial visit to Washington.
The thorny issues of trade and defense are likely to be the ma
jor points ofcontention when Nakasone meets President Reagan
tommorrow for the first time since becoming prime minister on
Nov. 26. During the White House talks, Nakasone is not ex
pected to make any specific new pledges in the economic or mili
tary spheres.
In preparation for his visit, however, the 64-year-old leader
has moved quickly on a broad front to address a number of long
standing U.S. demands. In so doing, he has attempted to cast
himself as a man of action, w ho, unlike his predecessors, will not
shrink from an enlarged global role for Japan more in line with
the country's vast economic strength.
Prison population rises
Washington — The number of state and federal prison inmates
rose by 11,055 during the third quarter of 1982 to a record
405,371, the Justice Department said yesterday.
The department's Bureau of Justice Statistics said there was a
9.9 percent increase in prisoners during the first nine months of
1982, compared with an 8.6 percent increase during the first nine
months of 1981.
Prison populations have been growing at near record rates in
1981 and 1982, and bureau officials have attributed this largely
to new state laws imposing mandatory sentences and restricting
parole. The total 1981 increase was 11.8 percent. The record an
nual increase in the 57 years that records have been kept was 12.2
percent in 1939.
Federal prisoners accounted for 29,403 of the total as of Sept.
30, 1982, or about 20 percent more than the rated capacity of fed
eral prisons. The federal figure included 1234 unsentenced pris
oners under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Immigration and Natu
ralization Service, including many Cubans who arrived in the
this country during the 1980 boatlift from that Caribbean island
nation.
