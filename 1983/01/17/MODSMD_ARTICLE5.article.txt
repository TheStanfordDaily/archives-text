# GSB hosts Jamaican prime minister

### SANDRA BODOVITZ Staff writer 
The key to ending the present world recession and
stagnation of trade is the stimulation of investment flows
into the productive processes, Jamaican Prime Minister
Edward Seaga said Saturday.
"In July 1982 the Jamaica National Investment
Promotion was incorporated and began operating in
September of that year. Its purpose is to attract invest
ments to all areas of the economy and to guide these
investments into production in the shortest possible
time," Seaga said.
And the stimulation of production in developing
countries such as Jamaica will help stimulate the world
economy as a whole, according to Seaga.
Introduced by his Harvard classmate, University Pres
ident Donald Kennedy, Seaga discussed anti

recessionary measures at the Conference on Interna
tional Business in Developing Countries sponsored by
the Stanford Business School.
"Developing countries seeking international business
or investment capital all have much the same objectives.
They can be very simply stated: the development of their
economies, the provision of employment, the earning of
foreign exchange, acquisition of new technologies and
the diversification of their production base," Seaga said.
In order for corporations to achieve their simple ob
jective, the maximization of profits, they need a "com
patible and welcoming environment," he added.
The enormous problem of unemployment in Jamaica
and elsewhere in the Caribbean makes private invest
ment particularly necessary, according to Seaga. "In the
Caribbean as a whole unemployment Drobablv now av-

erages at least 20 percent and is consid
erably higher than this in a number of
islands. While aid flows to the public
sector are of great importance for the
establishment of primary infrastruc
ture and concessionary financing, these
cannot generate the kind of productive
expansion that will create new
employment on a scale sufficient to
lower the rate of unemployment to
more tolerable moral and social
levels," Seaga said.
Seaga claimed that Jamaica's
socialist regime during the 1970s com
pounded the problems of the develop
ing country. "Because private invest
ment flows dried up, the economy con
tracted and in the end there were fewer
jobs, not more, being created, and gre
ater hardships, not fewer, on the mass
of the population."
The present government plans to use
a "mixed-market economy" to en
hance development. "There is a middle
path between a simplistically applied
pure capitalist market system and the
completely centralized one of the Mar
xist economies," he added.
Stressing the idea that developing
countries should not rely solely on de
veloped countries for financing, Seaga
said that "any country that is serious
about investment and production
should be prepared to put up most of
the money itself from internal sources
and look only outside for residual capi
tal."
"Our experience has shown us that
even in the wrong times, the right
policies, the right will, and the right
partners, can achieve the right results,"
he concluded.
Seaga's warm reception by a capacity
crowd at Bishop Auditorium was
marked by the exchanging of gifts bet
ween Seaga and his business school
hosts. Along with the memories he will
take back to Jamaica with him are a
bottle of California wine and a pair of
Stanford jogging shorts.
