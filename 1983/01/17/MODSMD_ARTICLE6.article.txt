# Student rally honors Martin Luther King
## 
### FELICIA LEE Staff writer 
Amid the noon rush in White Plaza,
well over 100 students and community
members of different racial and ethnic
backgrounds gathered to honor the
memory and the work of Dr. Martin
Luther King Friday.
The half-hour rally, much like those
that have been held annually for the
past several years, consisted of music,
songs and speeches by members of the
Black Students Union (BSU), which
sponsored the event. Although a pri
mary purpose of the rally was to urge
official recognition of King's birthday
as a national and University holiday,
the prevailing theme of the rally was
the continuation of King's work and
ideals, rather than the celebration of
King's birthday itself.
BSU reprcxr/ative Steve Randall
urged the crowd to remember
King's ideals and to strive to
continue them. He cited in particular
King's well-known "1 have a dream"
speech, which Randall called "the
greatest speech of his entire life." In
this speech, Randall said. King spoke
of his vision of "a world with no op
pression."
"This dream is alive in me and Fm
sure it is in all of you," Randall told the
crowd. He also reminded them that al
though King was an important figure in
the civil rights movement, he was only a

catalyst in the process of social change
and he could not have accomplished all
of the work of the civil rights move
ment alone. It is up to people here and
now, Randall said, to "pick it up where
he (King) left it off."
Although the general mood of the
rally was one of unity and optimism,
there was also a strong feeling ex
pressed by the speakers that there still
is much work to be done in the pursuit
of civil rights. The songs played over
the loudspeaker before and after the
rally were songs of change and oppres
sion, and the theme of struggle was one
mentioned by all four speakers.
Yet none of the speakers spoke of
struggle without gain. Although a
poem read by Cathy Drayton, BSU
student affairs coordinator, spoke of
struggle as "the breath of life," it also
declared "We believe history is on our
side."
The speakers also discussed more
immediate concerns of the Stanford
community in the realm of civil rights.
Although they acknowledged the prog
ress made by black students at Stanford
and particularly acknowledged the
ASSU for closing its offices in honor of
King's birthday, stronger involvement
in student and community activities by
Stanford's black students was urged.
Students were reminded again of the
struggle of their predecessors: Stanford
students in the! 9605, who worked for
the progress of black students today.
