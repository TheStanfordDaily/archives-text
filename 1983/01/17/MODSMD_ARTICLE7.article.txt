## Budget proposals: Reagan outlines cutbacks, freezes Budget trimming ahead Social Security gets bipartisan approval

Compiled from news reports arid wire services
The search for new revenues to trim the
budget deficit continues as President Rea
gan and his aides propose a number of
changes including major alterations in the
current tax system, Social Security be
nefits and the pay scale for federal civilian
and military employees.
According to administration officials,
Reagan is considering asking Congress
for a major overhaul and simplification of
the tax system in his State of the Union
address to Congress on Jan. 25, and
perhaps a 10 percent surcharge on tax
bills.
The so-called "flat rate" income tax
which Reagan favors would, in its purest
form, set a single, low tax rate for all in
come, and wipe out all deductions sprink
led through the hundreds of pages in the
current tax code. Congress, however,
would be reluctant to reduce or eliminate
such popular items as the deductions for
interest payments on home mortgages
and other loans, and for contributions to
charity.
Political pressure would most likely
make it necessary to keep some of the
more popular reductions. A flat tax rate
would lower the income tax rates, now at
a maximum of 50 percent, but the new
government would still collect more total
revenues because of new deduction re
strictions.
Another proposal for raising revenues
calls for a 10 percent additional income
tax to be levied automatically in 1986 and
beyond if budget deficits grow too large,
said Treasury Sec. Donald Regan last

week. If enacted, such a plan would re
quire a person who owed $2000 to the
Internal Revenue Service to pay a sur
charge of $200, for a total tax obligation
of $2200.
None of the proposed income tax
changes would take effect before 1986,
said Regan, because the president be
lieves an increase in taxes over the next
three years would hamper the economy's
gradual recovery from its current deep
slump. The president has repeatedly said
that he does not want to raise income
taxes during a recession.
Social Security taxes, however, are not
immune to earlier changes. Under a com
promise package being developed to res
cue the financially strapped retirement
system, taxes could rise as early as 1984.
According to administration officials,
higher Social Security taxes and a six
month delay in the annual cost of living
increase granted to Social Security reci
pients are the crucial provisions in a pro
posed $168 billion combination of in
creased revenues and reduced outlays for
the retirement fund over the next seven
years.
In addition to changes in Social Secu
rity and the tax system, Reagan has de
cided to ask Congress to deny federal civi
lian and military employees any fiscal
1984 pay raise.
If approved by Congress, it would be
the first time since 1964 that federal
workers did not receive a yearly pay in
crease of some amount. The president's
decision would affect about 2.1 million
uniformed military personnel and about

two million civilian workers throughout
the government.
As work continues on the fiscal 1984
budget to be submitted to Congress Jan.
31, White House officials said the military
budget savings agreed to by Defense Sec
retary Caspar Weinberger will mean a
delay of some major weapons programs in
later years.
Despite the salary freeze, federal em
ployees will still get longevity or in-grade
increases, which typically are about 3 per
cent. Although the president views the
pay freeze as a necessary across-the
board sacrifice, Weinberger strongly op
posed the move. Reagan's decision to ask
federal workers to forgo next year's pay
raise marked a setback for Weinberger,
who was seeking military pay raises of 7.6
percent for 1984.
Struggling to bring down a deficit now

estimated to reach $200 billion in fiscal
1984, Reagan could trim about $6 billion
a year from the projected deficit if the pay
freeze is approved.
The 1983 congressional budget resolu
tion, approved last summer, called for pay
increases of 4 percent a year for three
years. Federal workers, both civilian and
military received 4 percent raises last Oc
tober.
In other parts of its final budget delib
erations affecting government workers,
the administration also is considering a
proposal to require in the future that they
work an additional 10 years (to age 65) to
get full retirement benefits and contribute
a larger proportion of their salary to their
retirement fund.
Neither of the proposals has enjoyed
much support from civilian and military
employees.

Compiled from news reports and wire ser
vices
By a vote of 12-3 Saturday
night, President Reagan's Social
Security advisory commission
approved a Social Security res
cue plan which would provide
$169 billion in tax increases and
benefit reductions over the next
seven years to keep the system
from default.
The agreement basically com
prises:
- Advancement to 1984 of a
three-tenths of 1 percent in
crease in Social Seucrity tax al
ready scheduled for 1985; and a
similar move-up to 1988 of an
increase scheduled for 1990.
- Self-employed persons
would be required to pay the
same total tax on their incomes
as an employer and employee
together now pay on a worker's
salary of the same amount.
Under current law, the self
employed pay three-quarters of
combined employer-employee
tax. The self-employed would be
allowed to offset the extra pay
ment against income tax.
- This year's automatic cost
of-living increase in benefits
would be postponed for six
months, from July to January.
The increase then would be
given each Jan. 1 thereafter.
- High income beneficiaries
would be required to pay income
tax on half their benefits, but
only if total income from all
souces exceeded $20,000 a year
in the case of a single person or
$25,000 in the case of a married
couple filing jointly. Social Secu
rity benefits are not taxed now.
- The system would be reim
bursed for certain credits
granted to members of the
armed forces, and also would re
ceive credit for Social Security
checks that go uncashed.
- Mandatory Social Security
coverage extended to newly

hired federal workers, those with
three years or less of federal em
ployment, and workers in non
profit organizations as of Jan. 1.
1984. Federal employees are not
covered by Social Security at
present on a mandatory basis, al
though some qualify by work in
the private sector, and nonprofit
•rganizations may join if they
choose.
The latter point aroused
heated dispute, namely because
government workers have their
own retirement plans which offer
earlier retirement and, in many
cases, better benefits. Bringing
them into the Social Security
fund would provide about $30
billion in additional revenue by
1989.
The problem remains, how
ever, of a long-range deficit. The
commission also estimated that
Social Security will face a deficit
of 1.8 percent of taxable payroll
on a long-term basis over the
next 75 years. This amounts to
about $1.6 trillion.
The agreement reached would
wipe out more than two-thirds of
this long-range deficit.
The eleventh-hour decision,
backed by both Reagan and
House Speaker Thomas "Tip"
O-Neill, was the result of months
of bipartisan wrangling. There
was also a time pressure, because
the commission's existence offi
cially ended at midnight, and the
Social Security issue must go to
Congress in February.
A compromise politically bles
sed by the White House and
Speaker O'Neill would carry
considerable weight in Congress
but still would be subject to dras
tic change as legislators pon
dered the potential impact on the
voters — 115 million workers
who pay Social Security taxes
and 86 million persons who re
ceived Social Security checks
each month.
