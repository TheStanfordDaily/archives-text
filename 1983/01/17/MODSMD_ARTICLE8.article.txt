# Protest mounts over insurance tax, wage proposal
## 
### 
Compiled from news reports and wire services
While President Reagan struggles to reduce the
budget deficit and curb high unemployment, special
interest groups are gathering for major confrontation
should proposals to tax health insurance benefits and
instigate a sub-minimum wage for teens be adopted.
A wide range of business, labor and professional or
ganizations have urged Reagan to project the proposal
to tax the insurance benefits saying such a limit on tax
free health benefits would lead to erosion of insurance
coverage, particularly for older workers and those who
live in areas with high medical costs.
Proponents of the tax have said it would raise several
billion dollars of revenue and help control health costs
by discouraging the purchase of excessive amounts of
health insurance. Health costs have consistently risen
faster than the Consumer Price Index. In the 12-month
period that ended in November, charges for medical care

rose 11 percent while the Consumer Price Index for all
items rose 4.6 percent, according to the Bureau of Labor
Statistics.
Most health insurance in the United States is provided
by employers as a contractual fringe benefit. Under cur
rent law, an employer who pays health insurance pre
miums for his employees may deduct the payments as a
business expense on his tax return, but the payments are
not counted as taxable income for the employees.
The proposal under study by the administration, for
possible inclusion in the budget to be submitted to Con
gress by month's end, would require a worker to pay
income tax on employer contributions to health insur
ance above a certain level. A ceiling has not been set, but
administration officials have said it might be $2100 a
year for a family and $900 a year for an individual.
A second proposal under consideration would create a

sub-minimum wage whereby businesses could pay teen
agers $2.50 an hour — 85 cents less than the current
$3.35 minimum wage administration sources said. The
lower wage, however could only be paid for summer
jobs.
The proposal, debated and approved at a Cabinet
council meeting last week, is one of several administra
tion initiatives aimed at curbing high unemployment.
The summer limitation is designed to head off stiff oppo
sition by congressional Democrats and organized labor.
The AFL-CIO has opposed any lowering of the
minimum wage for youths, saying businesses would be
encouraged to replace older workers and heads of
households with teenagers at the lower labor costs.
Rather, the 15 million-member labor federation has
argued that any change in the minimum wage law should
upgrade the pay scale, which has been frozen since Jan.
1, 1981.
