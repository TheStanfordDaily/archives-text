The noon concerts. The film
series. The Christmas Faire.
Many of the entertainment
events sponsored by Student
Arts at Stanford (STARTS) are
well-known and attended, but
few students understand the
specific functions of this prog
ramming arm of Tresidder Un
ion.
STARTS is a collection of
seven committees that concen
trate on specific types of enter
taining events. There are com
mittees for the performing arts,
visual arts, films, lectures and
classes, annual events, contem
porary entertainment and spe
cial programs. Each committee
usually has fewer than 10 people
working on it.
Students are in charge of each
committee. At the beginning of
each year they collect 30 to 40
ideas for events to sponsor.
Members of the Visual Arts
Committee, for example, are in
charge of choosing the exhibits in

the Coffee House and the Tre
sidder lobby. Usually the shows
are put on by student artists. Part
of the reason for having the
board is "to give students a
chance to be on the other side, to
be the producers and to deal with
all the problems and excitement

STARTS tries *to give students a chance to
be on the other side, to be the producers and
deal with all the problems and excitement of
producing

of producing," according to Jean
Martin, Tresidder Program Di
rector.
Among the details STARTS
members have to worry about is
the publicity for an event. "You
would be surprised how many

people think 'Well, we'll just get
out a flyer the day before so
people will know about the event
and everyone will come.' About
one fiasco teaches people the
importance of early advertis
ing," Martin said.
The Music and Noon Enter-

tainment Committee is in charge
of the noon concerts and Coffee
House entertainment. Under the
direction of Annie Mudge, the
committee auditions student
groups and bands in the area.
The members usually look for

"talent, the group's entertain
ment quotient: whether they're
good technically, whether they
express themselves well. We give
first priority to our own students.
We'll give people a chance even
if they are not that professional,"
Mudge said.
Once the committee has cho
sen a band, the members take
care of the details of the concert.
They are responsible for every
thing from scheduling to prepar
ing the stage and sound system.
In addition, STARTS puts on
an annual faculty show entitled
"Professors in Performance"
every May. Last year's show fea
tured, among others, Provost A 1
Hastorf as master of ceremonies
and Associate Dean Thom Mas
sey, who played the harmonica
version of "Matriculation
Blues." Last summer STARTS
sponsored a two-week residen
tial jazz workshop. Legendary
jazz saxophonist Stan Getz was
the artist in residence and will be
back next summer to teach
again.

At the end of this month,
STARTS will begin its annual
recruiting drive to find new
members for its committees.
Jennifer Watson, Cindy Peabody
and Kevin Howell are in charge
of the recruiting activities.
"A lot of people feel kind of
lost when they come here: what
can you latch on to, what's special
about you that you can express
by working in some organiza
tion. I think STARTS is a good
outlet for that," Watson said.
A large chunk of the money
for the budget comes from the
Christmas Faire. In three days it

grossed $100,000, with a net for
STARTS of $20,000. The group
also gets commissions from art
works it sells and some funds
from ticket sales to concerts and
other events.
The group began in 1962 as
the Tresidder Program Board.
"During the war years people
were more interested in larger
issues," Martin said. More stu
dents were concerned with resist
ing the draft than with putting on
shows in the Union, she said.
When Martin arrived in 1969,
the program board was defunct.
Having studied here as a music

major, Martin was aware of the
lack of opportunity for students
to play for audiences in an in
formal setting. She began to
bring these recitals to Tresidder.
Other people soon began spon
soring films, lectures and the
noon concerts on the patio. Clas
ses were added later.
In 1979 the program board
members decided their name
lacked "pizazz." They consi
dered ideas all summer, finally
deciding on the name STARTS
and the logo of the pig listening
to a gramaphone. With the new
name and logo, the number of
students involved increased from
15 to almost 50.
For the people involved,
STARTS serves a very definite
purpose. "The University speaks
one language and the world
speaks another. Here on the
campus we're very interested in
academic concerns and grades
... but in the outside world
people are much more interested
in how you get along with
people, how you make decisions
and how you take responsibility.
In STARTS students have the
opportunity to learn these
things," Martin said.
