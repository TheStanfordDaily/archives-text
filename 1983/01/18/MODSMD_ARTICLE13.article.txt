## The
						Stanford Daily Copying without thought 
### 
The technology revolution strikes the publishing
industry at its basic level, funding, and the courts
are considering the new regime's first gains. The
dispute concerns professors who use copying
machines to provide many, cheap copies of works
to students, and the legal battle underway against
New York University's practice might just as well
be directed against our own university.
There is no doubt that the law is murky: only in
the last decade or so has the technology for wide
spread copying been readily available. Even so,
principles of providing full protection and respect
for intellectual endeavors should be receiving the
greatest protection, rather than the greatest abuse,
in an academic community.
Widespread copying endangers the principles of
reward and protection of ideas that are the basis of
a community of scholars. Not only is the thinker
denied payment for thought, but the importance of
ideas originating with individuals and spread
through financial risk in the marketplace is de
graded. The professor who copies works while
teaching comes close to an ugly plagiarism, or at
best is indulging in a sloppy footnote.
Yet this community of scholars copies and dis
tributes original work with abandon. The practice
here ranges from copying a selection of poems for a
single class to directing students to buy the entire
course readings at the local corner copy shop. With
the exception of only a few professors, especially in
the Business School, this raiding of works con
tinues without the author's permission, without
payment and without giving the full credit every
writer deserves.

The copying is usually done with the best of
motives — to save students money and inconveni
ence — but is a cruelly ironic and shortsighted
kindness: this gesture comes from professors who
are at the same time undermining their own work,
livelihood and ostensible values.
This copying first deprives scholars of payment
— that bit of money which augments disgracefully
low salaries, attracts new professors to the field
and encourages current scholars to share their
thoughts. Just as important, copying denies pub
lishing companies their payment for the risk of
allowing thousands to read writers' work. The pub
lishing company goes without the reward neces
sary to continue distributing the work, and the
practice deprives them of funds necessary to un
dertake authors' new projects and to indulge in
publishing worthy thinkers at an initial or continu
ing loss.
More fundamentally, professors tell students
that the written word, the very thoughts of their
field, are not worthy enough of protection or im
portant enough to command the respect accorded
other efforts. And this is the saddest lesson of all,
for it comes from the very people who should be
counted upon to defend the worth of intellectual
endeavors.
Copying may stem from good intentions, but it
damages the author, the reader and anyone with a
vested interest in principles determining and
furthering education. Academicians should be the
first to defend against an attack upon their work
and values, rather than serve as the leaders of that
assault.
