# Crumpets with the Queen
## 
### 
You may already be a winner.
Your possible nomination for the Dean of Stu
dent Affairs' Service Award may have qualified
you, yes you — a generic Stanford student — to
participate in the Simply Smashing "Win-a-
Lunch-with-the-Queen" Sweepstakes. Only you
and a few other inventive letter-writing rogues are
eligible to cast lots for this once-in-a-lifetime op
portunity: a luncheon date with Queen Elizabeth
11, President Donald Kennedy, various University
officials and approximately 17 other generic stu
dents like yourself.
With enterprise worthy of officials at a major
American educational institution, University ad
ministrators have devised a fool-proof, certain
not-to-work method of choosing the lucky 18.

Don't you worry, it's absolutely guaranteed not to
produce a cross-section of the student body. On
the fateful judgment day, administrators will toss
the names of Service Award nominees and stu
dents who have written letters requesting invita
tions into a hat. Then 18 names will be scientifi
cally drawn out of the chapeau. These lucky win
ners — one of whom could be you — will be invited
to luncheon with Queen Elizabeth and Prince
Philip.
Don't delay. The decision should be made soon.
Many others have already expressed interest —
sending gifts and letters to Kennedy — so don't
hesitate to send that letter, bake that cake, record
that "God Save the Queen" tape. Lyons says that
breakfast in bed might be nice as well. Don't forget
the crumpets.
