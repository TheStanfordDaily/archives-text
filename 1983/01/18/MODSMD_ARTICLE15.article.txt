## Subtle biases were at work in the Freedman tenure decision 
### 
This letter is in response to Dean of
Humanities and Sciences Norman
Wessells' recent comments {Daily, Jan.
5) concerning the negative tenure deci
sion in the case of Asst. History Prof.
Estelle Freedman and the tenure pro
cedures currently followed at Stanford.
I have been personally much dismayed
by this negative decision, both because
I think Freedman deserves promotion to
tenure at Stanford and because I think
subtle biases were at work in the
decision-making process.
Currently, the Stanford Faculty
Handbook states that in order for a
person to be promoted to tenure at
Stanford, he or she must be an out
standing scholar or teacher and at least
very good at the other. There can be no
doubt that Freedman is an outstanding
teacher: she was awarded the Deans'
Award for Distinguished Teaching and
received the Dinkelspiel Award for her
outstanding contribution to under
graduate education. In helping to con
struct the curriculum for the new
Feminist Studies Program, Freedman
was performing not only a community
service but also a pedagogical function:
the theoretical conception of a feminist
methodology and its curricular im
plementation.
The deans have argued that Freed
man's scholarship is less than "very
good." I have read Freedman's Our
Sisters' Keepers and agreed with those
scholars in the field who have reviewed
this book in the leading review
journals in American history that it is a
very good book: lucidly written,
thoroughly documented and a
genuinely original contribution to the
field of American social history.
Why then was Freedman denied te
nure? I and many of my colleagues in
the feminist community here share the
perception that, despite Wessells' dis
claimer, an "administrative" factor did
indeed play a role in this particular te
nure decision. In other words, Freed
man was penalized in the tenure discus
sions surrounding her case for having
done exactly what she was hired to do
and what the History Department con
sistently encouraged her to do, namely
to teach the bulk of her courses and do
the bulk of her research in the field of

women's history. I believe that some
scholars, both inside and outside of
Stanford, who evaluated her work
found this new field of women's history
so controversial that they discredited
her work within this discipline. But as
History Prof. Carl Degler has already
asserted, this new field is here to stay.
And unless the Stanford administra
tion actively encourages young scho
lars to work in this new but rapidly
advancing discipline of gender studies,
this University shall soon find itself un
able to offer a legitimate academic
program in an intellectual area of vital
and immediate concern to some of our
most gifted students.
It is for these reasons that I hope
Freedman's appeal to reverse this de
canal decision will be successful. Not
only does she deserve to be promoted,
but the University needs scholars with
her active, productive commitment to
research in the new and exciting area of
feminist studies.

Bulimia is serious
I believe that the article (Daily, Jan.
12) on bulimia was presented in an all
too-casual manner, regarding it simply
as a less serious eating disorder than
anorexia nervosa. The simple fact:
bulimia is serious.
When they first discover purging,
bulimarexics think they have found an
ideal diet aid. The truth is that habitual
binging and vomiting are extremely
dangerous. Purging upsets the body's
electrolyte balance, the vital chemical
equilibrium in the blood, which can
seriously disrupt proper heart and
muscle function. People have died of
heart attacks during self-induced vom
iting and can strangle on their vomit.
The esophagus may be ruptured, caus
ing one to bleed to death. Complica
tions include kidney and liver damage,
irregular menses, ulcers, hernias,
stomach rupture, severe gastric and di
gestive problems, colitis, dehydration
and dental cavities and tooth enamel
erosion due to the acidic vomit. Those

who depend on laxatives to purge ex
cess calories ruin the normal function
of their bowels and may need to de
pend on laxatives for life. Rectal bleed
ing can also result from the overuse of
laxatives.
I began researching this disorder
when a friend confronted me with her
"abnormality," and I found that 20 to
30 percent of college-age women are
estimated to be bulimarexic, according
to ANAD (Anorexia Nervosa and As
sociated Disorders). This disease is fos
tered by society's obsession with thin
ness; fear of gaining weight causes tre
mendous ambivalence for the over
eater. Those who suffer from bulimia
are difficult to detect because they are
of normal weight and eat normal-size
portions when with others. To coun
teract stress and depression, gorging
and purging is done in secret, anywhere
from once per week to 10 times per
day. Bulimia is likely to be common at
Stanford, as those affected are often
talented young women with extremely
high standards of achievement. Most
bulimarexics tend to over-exercise as
well as over-eat.
Bulimarexics feel guilty because they
realize that their behavior is abnormal.
Counseling is used to increase self
esteem and to teach new ways of deal
ing with problems and insecurities so
that food is no longer the central focus
of life. Seeking help may be embarras
sing, but the dangers of this disorder
are serious. Like any addictive be
havior, breaking the pattern is difficult
without professional help.
Bulimarexics may contact Marilyn
Reed Hoskins, co-director of therapy
groups at Stanford's CAPS (Counsel
ing and Psychological Services).
Further information may be obtained
from ANAD (Anorexia Nervosa and
Associated Disorders), Box 271, High
land Park, 111. 60035.
It is my hope, in writing this letter,
that those affected with eating disor
ders will seek assistance before ir
reparable damage to their health oc
curs.

Immorality?
The questions posed by nuclear
weapons and nuclear politics are prob
ably the most complex and important
questions ever faced by mankind. I
have long opposed a nuclear freeze on
several grounds. First, I think a freeze
would lock in place many dangerous
imbalances, some in favor of the Un
ited States and some in favor of the
Soviet Union. A more important and
all-encompassing objection, though, is
that the freeze solution is hopelessly
simple. Attempting to exorcise our
nuclear demons with "freeze now" ap
pears to me about as naive as was the
Kellogg-Briand Pact of 1928.
Now along comes Constance
Kuruppu (Daily, Jan. 12) who says,
"Each one of us is morally obligated to
support the freeze on nuclear weapons,
to save the children and to demand now
an end to the madness of Reagan,
Bush, Jones et al., as they busily plan
our fate." Kuruppu is suggesting that I
am immoral because I oppose a nuclear
freeze. Based on the tone of her letter
she might even say that I was in favor of
world-wide holocaust, as well. She ap
parently thinks that President Reagan
and Vice President George Bush are
itching to push the button and for the
most part I agree with them. Well, Tm
sorry but I am not in favor of a world
wide holocaust and I am not im
moral, either. It is time that the
immoral, either. It is time that the
"freeze now" advocates stopped claim
ing to have a monopoly on morality. I
doubt there is anyone in the country
who wants nuclear war and it should be
recognized that some of us simply have
different viewpoints from others. We
are all following the dictates of our in
tellects and our consciences.
Unless one of the freeze advocates
can come forward and prove to me that
he has a direct hotline to God I am
going to continue to regard my opposi
tion to the nuclear freeze as being just
as moral as their support of it.

This letter is in response to Dean of
Humanities and Sciences Norman
Wessells' recent comments {Daily, Jan.
5) concerning the negative tenure deci
sion in the case of Asst. History Prof.
Estelle Freedman and the tenure pro
cedures currently followed at Stanford.
I have been personally much dismayed
by this negative decision, both because
I think Freedman deserves promotion to
tenure at Stanford and because I think
subtle biases were at work in the
decision-making process.
Currently, the Stanford Faculty
Handbook states that in order for a
person to be promoted to tenure at
Stanford, he or she must be an out
standing scholar or teacher and at least
very good at the other. There can be no
doubt that Freedman is an outstanding
teacher: she was awarded the Deans'
Award for Distinguished Teaching and
received the Dinkelspiel Award for her
outstanding contribution to under
graduate education. In helping to con
struct the curriculum for the new
Feminist Studies Program, Freedman
was performing not only a community
service but also a pedagogical function:
the theoretical conception of a feminist
methodology and its curricular im
plementation.
The deans have argued that Freed
man's scholarship is less than "very
good." I have read Freedman's Our
Sisters' Keepers and agreed with those
scholars in the field who have reviewed
this book in the leading review
journals in American history that it is a
very good book: lucidly written,
thoroughly documented and a
genuinely original contribution to the
field of American social history.
Why then was Freedman denied te
nure? I and many of my colleagues in
the feminist community here share the
perception that, despite Wessells' dis
claimer, an "administrative" factor did
indeed play a role in this particular te
nure decision. In other words, Freed
man was penalized in the tenure discus
sions surrounding her case for having
done exactly what she was hired to do
and what the History Department con
sistently encouraged her to do, namely
to teach the bulk of her courses and do
the bulk of her research in the field of

women's history. I believe that some
scholars, both inside and outside of
Stanford, who evaluated her work
found this new field of women's history
so controversial that they discredited
her work within this discipline. But as
History Prof. Carl Degler has already
asserted, this new field is here to stay.
And unless the Stanford administra
tion actively encourages young scho
lars to work in this new but rapidly
advancing discipline of gender studies,
this University shall soon find itself un
able to offer a legitimate academic
program in an intellectual area of vital
and immediate concern to some of our
most gifted students.
It is for these reasons that I hope
Freedman's appeal to reverse this de
canal decision will be successful. Not
only does she deserve to be promoted,
but the University needs scholars with
her active, productive commitment to
research in the new and exciting area of
feminist studies.

Bulimia is serious
I believe that the article (Daily, Jan.
12) on bulimia was presented in an all
too-casual manner, regarding it simply
as a less serious eating disorder than
anorexia nervosa. The simple fact:
bulimia is serious.
When they first discover purging,
bulimarexics think they have found an
ideal diet aid. The truth is that habitual
binging and vomiting are extremely
dangerous. Purging upsets the body's
electrolyte balance, the vital chemical
equilibrium in the blood, which can
seriously disrupt proper heart and
muscle function. People have died of
heart attacks during self-induced vom
iting and can strangle on their vomit.
The esophagus may be ruptured, caus
ing one to bleed to death. Complica
tions include kidney and liver damage,
irregular menses, ulcers, hernias,
stomach rupture, severe gastric and di
gestive problems, colitis, dehydration
and dental cavities and tooth enamel
erosion due to the acidic vomit. Those

who depend on laxatives to purge ex
cess calories ruin the normal function
of their bowels and may need to de
pend on laxatives for life. Rectal bleed
ing can also result from the overuse of
laxatives.
I began researching this disorder
when a friend confronted me with her
"abnormality," and I found that 20 to
30 percent of college-age women are
estimated to be bulimarexic, according
to ANAD (Anorexia Nervosa and As
sociated Disorders). This disease is fos
tered by society's obsession with thin
ness; fear of gaining weight causes tre
mendous ambivalence for the over
eater. Those who suffer from bulimia
are difficult to detect because they are
of normal weight and eat normal-size
portions when with others. To coun
teract stress and depression, gorging
and purging is done in secret, anywhere
from once per week to 10 times per
day. Bulimia is likely to be common at
Stanford, as those affected are often
talented young women with extremely
high standards of achievement. Most
bulimarexics tend to over-exercise as
well as over-eat.
Bulimarexics feel guilty because they
realize that their behavior is abnormal.
Counseling is used to increase self
esteem and to teach new ways of deal
ing with problems and insecurities so
that food is no longer the central focus
of life. Seeking help may be embarras
sing, but the dangers of this disorder
are serious. Like any addictive be
havior, breaking the pattern is difficult
without professional help.
Bulimarexics may contact Marilyn
Reed Hoskins, co-director of therapy
groups at Stanford's CAPS (Counsel
ing and Psychological Services).
Further information may be obtained
from ANAD (Anorexia Nervosa and
Associated Disorders), Box 271, High
land Park, 111. 60035.
It is my hope, in writing this letter,
that those affected with eating disor
ders will seek assistance before ir
reparable damage to their health oc

Immorality?
The questions posed by nuclear
weapons and nuclear politics are prob
ably the most complex and important
questions ever faced by mankind. I
have long opposed a nuclear freeze on
several grounds. First, I think a freeze
would lock in place many dangerous
imbalances, some in favor of the Un
ited States and some in favor of the
Soviet Union. A more important and
all-encompassing objection, though, is
that the freeze solution is hopelessly
simple. Attempting to exorcise our
nuclear demons with "freeze now" ap
pears to me about as naive as was the
Kellogg-Briand Pact of 1928.
Now along comes Constance
Kuruppu (Daily, Jan. 12) who says,
"Each one of us is morally obligated to
support the freeze on nuclear weapons,
to save the children and to demand now
an end to the madness of Reagan,
Bush, Jones et al., as they busily plan
our fate." Kuruppu is suggesting that I
am immoral because I oppose a nuclear
freeze. Based on the tone of her letter
she might even say that I was in favor of
world-wide holocaust, as well. She ap
parently thinks that President Reagan
and Vice President George Bush are
itching to push the button and for the
most part I agree with them. Well, Tm
sorry but I am not in favor of a world
wide holocaust and I am not im
moral, either. It is time that the
immoral, either. It is time that the
"freeze now" advocates stopped claim
ing to have a monopoly on morality. I
doubt there is anyone in the country
who wants nuclear war and it should be
recognized that some of us simply have
different viewpoints from others. We
are all following the dictates of our in
tellects and our consciences.
Unless one of the freeze advocates
can come forward and prove to me that
he has a direct hotline to God I am
going to continue to regard my opposi
tion to the nuclear freeze as being just
as moral as their support of it.
