# Reflections
## Free enterprise with federal help 
### 
Just as Americans were settling
down by their TV sets to enjoy the
Orange Bowl before New Year's, some
black people in Miami had the bad
taste to riot after an apparently
trigger-happy policeman fatally shot a
young black man. Most people
switched the channel. Miami Gty offi
cials complained about unfair {i.e., too
much) media coverage of the event.
To be fair, my first instinct when I
hear news about race riots is to turn my
thoughts to the more pleasant events of
the day. This instinct is worth examin
ing, for I believe it reflects a perception
of the intractability of the problem:
America has a permanent underclass,
predominantly composed of racial
minorities. My focus here is on the
inner city ghettos of Watts, Newark,
Detroit etc. — not on the black middle
class that has made the move to the
suburbs.
The liberal notion that government
programs, such as food stamps, welfare
or CETA, would change the pattern of
poverty and hopelessness in America's
ghettos has been discredited. While
given with the best intentions, hand
outs perhaps create a work disincen
tive, but, more crucially, do not give
rise to economic oppor
tunities for people who desperately
need and want them. President Reagan
has talked about establishing Enter-

prise Zones in blighted areas — and
using tax policy to stimulate investment
in these regions actually seems like a
good idea, but it is insufficient standing
alone. Yet, even those economists who
contend that government assistance
only perpetuates the dependence of the
underclass on the handout don't
suggest that the federal government
pull the plug on these programs.

The long-term solution, of course, lies in
motivating the young people of Harlem,
Overtown and Chicago?s south side to take
school seriously, get an education that trains
them for jobs in an economy that demands a
skilled labor force and compete as equals in the
job market.

the Rev. Jesse Jackson has tried to sell
the idea to minority youth in his PUSH
program.
But the optimistic/motivational mes
sage doesn't square with the reality of
decaying neighborhoods, unstable
families and violent schools. Without a
real hope ot competing equally with
white society, ghetto teenagers look
around them and see who has ready
cash — the drug dealers and other as
sorted bad guys. Meanwhile, the fairy
tale images of affluent America beam
into their homes, confirming the belief
that the gap between the haves and
have-nots in this country is immense
and growing, exacerbated by economic
hard times.
It is no secret that affluent America
and the permanent underclass divide
generally along racial lines. And we
would be fooling ourselves to think that
racism is not still a strong force in our

society and does much to perpetuate
inequality of opportunity. At precisely
the wrong moment, the Reagan ad
ministration has put civil rights issues
— the symbolic stance against racism in
this country — on the back burner.
Oddly, new groups of immigrant
minorities seem to escape the vicious
cycle of joblessness and despair, and I
wonder whether their success can't be

the inner city. I'm thinking specifically
of New York and its population of
Asian immigrants. Virtually every
street corner in Manhattan features a
Korean or Chinese store, selling veget
ables or groceries, open from dawn till
after midnight. The stores are mostly
family owned, and family members of
all ages put in long hours at low wages.
Business seems to thrive. In a sense, the
success of these new immigrants mir
rors the rise ouf of the ghetto achieved
by the pre-war populations of Euro
pean immigrants.
Opportunities for free enterprise still
exist, even in the recession of the
1980s. The challenge for the decade
remains to rehabilitate urban schools,
provide job training programs where
necessary and extend those oppor
tunities into the ghetto by encouraging
private investment. This must be done.
Otherwise, outbursts such as the riot in
Miami will become a more frequent
visitor to the urban scene.

The liberal notion that government
programs, such as food stamps, welfare
or CETA, would change the pattern of
poverty and hopelessness in America's
ghettos has been discredited. While
given with the best intentions, hand
outs perhaps create a work disincen
tive, but, more crucially, do not give
rise to economic oppor
tunities for people who desperately
need and want them. President Reagan
has talked about establishing Enter-

prise Zones in blighted areas — and
using tax policy to stimulate investment
in these regions actually seems like a
good idea, but it is insufficient standing
alone. Yet, even those economists who
contend that government assistance
only perpetuates the dependence of the
underclass on the handout don't
suggest that the federal government
pull the plug on these programs.

The long-term solution, of course, lies in
motivating the young people of Harlem,
Overtown and Chicago?s south side to take
school seriously, get an education that trains
them for jobs in an economy that demands a
skilled labor force and compete as equals in the
job market.

the Rev. Jesse Jackson has tried to sell
the idea to minority youth in his PUSH
program.
But the optimistic/motivational mes
sage doesn't square with the reality of
decaying neighborhoods, unstable
families and violent schools. Without a
real hope ot competing equally with
white society, ghetto teenagers look
around them and see who has ready
cash — the drug dealers and other as
sorted bad guys. Meanwhile, the fairy
tale images of affluent America beam
into their homes, confirming the belief
that the gap between the haves and
have-nots in this country is immense
and growing, exacerbated by economic
hard times.
It is no secret that affluent America
and the permanent underclass divide
generally along racial lines. And we
would be fooling ourselves to think that
racism is not still a strong force in our

society and does much to perpetuate
inequality of opportunity. At precisely
the wrong moment, the Reagan ad
ministration has put civil rights issues
— the symbolic stance against racism in
this country — on the back burner.
Oddly, new groups of immigrant
minorities seem to escape the vicious
cycle of joblessness and despair, and I
wonder whether their success can't be

the inner city. I'm thinking specifically
of New York and its population of
Asian immigrants. Virtually every
street corner in Manhattan features a
Korean or Chinese store, selling veget
ables or groceries, open from dawn till
after midnight. The stores are mostly
family owned, and family members of
all ages put in long hours at low wages.
Business seems to thrive. In a sense, the
success of these new immigrants mir
rors the rise ouf of the ghetto achieved
by the pre-war populations of Euro
pean immigrants.
Opportunities for free enterprise still
exist, even in the recession of the
1980s. The challenge for the decade
remains to rehabilitate urban schools,
provide job training programs where
necessary and extend those oppor
tunities into the ghetto by encouraging
private investment. This must be done.
Otherwise, outbursts such as the riot in
Miami will become a more frequent
visitor to the urban scene.
