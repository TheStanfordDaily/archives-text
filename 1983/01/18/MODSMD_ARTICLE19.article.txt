## Changing of the fusion guard Real people that change for the better 
### MARK ZEIGLER 
Remove the lights, speakers
and instruments from the Jeff
Lorber Fusion and you find five
men. That's it. Just normal hu
man beings simply out to make a
living. No limousines. No bod
yguards. No slipping out the
back door to avoid the press after
the show.
Following their 8 p.m. concert
last Friday night at the Old
Waldorf, the band members
mingled with friends backstage.
Keyboardist Jeff Lorber, the
group's founding member,
talked with two middle-aged
women. Although they don't
think of themselves as
"groupies," the two have fol
lowed the band on the West
Coast portion of its national
tour. But the two "groupie"
women realize what's so special
about the band â€” they're real
people. They walk on sidewalks
and drink water just like the rest
of us.
A few minutes later, Lorber
stuck his head into the back room
of the Waldorf's backstage area.
"We're going out to get sushi.
Anyone want to come?" Lorber
rounded up three of the five band
members and a few friends and
left.
One small detail, Jeff. It was
10:45 p.m. and the group had a
second show to start in an hour.
The sushi entourage returned to
the Waldorf an hour later, with
barely enough time to warm-up
and start the evening's second 90-
minute set.
And once you give the band its

lights, speakers and instruments
back, you realize why they're up
on-stage and why you're not and
why you shelled out nine dollars
to be in the Waldorf at that par
ticular moment. The Jeff Lorber
Fusion can play.
The band has had some per
sonnel shake-ups as of late.
Bassist Danny Wilson is gone. So
is drummer Dennis Bradford.
The two were mainstays in the
group on the Wizard Island and
Galaxian albums.
But Lorber recruited two of
the best in the business to replace
them. As a result, the band leader
may have his most talented group
of five yet.
Bassist Randy Jackson is a lo
cal jazz/fusion star, and had
played with the best of them.
Jackson toured with Jean-Luc
Ponty and Billy Cobham and has
performed as a sessionist on a
number of fusion albums. In the
Bay Area, he plays with the Tom
Coster Band and the Warriors, a
jazz/rock group led by drummer
Narada Michael Walden.
Drummer Rayford Griffin is a
prize recruit as well. Griffin
played with Jackson on Ponty's
1982 LP Mystical Adventures and
the two proved to be a solid team.
Griffin stayed on for last sum
mer's Ponty tour and won the
hearts of a sold-out Greek Thea
ter with a Stirling performance at
the Berkeley Jazz Festival. Grif
fin ironically is the cousin of
DJ Clifford Brown, Jr.,
the MC at the jazz festival's final
day.
Perhaps the major reason why

JLF is such a fine concert band is
that they have fun while playing.
Sound corny? Well, it's true. Ask
any of them about any aspect of
their show and they'll just tell you
they're out there to have a good
time. And they do.
According to Kenny Gorelick
the band's woodwind man now
known as Kenny G after releas
ing his debut album by that
name, JLF practiced just two
hours Friday afternoon before
the evening shows. Friday's show
was the first one of the tour.
What about Jackson and Grif
fin, who aren't familiar with
JLF's music like Gorelick Lorber
and guitarist Marlon McClain
are? How long does it take them
to learn the songs? About a day
of practicing, Kenny G said.
"We're professionals, you
know."
But you'd never know so little
practice went into Friday's tour
opening show by the way JLF
played. As usual, the songs were
all very tight and the solos
climactic.
A word on the solos. Gorlick
said each band member knows
when another will solo, but the
solos themselves are composed,
usually improvised, by the indi
vidual musicians. The solos, es
pecially Lorber's and Gorelicks,
differed radically from the first to
the second shows at the Waldorf.
Playing mostly tunes from
Lorber's most recent LP, It's a
Fact, and fromGorelicks kenny G
, the quintet's show is one that is
hard to top. Except for "Tierra
Verde" and "It's a Fact," all the

songs are of the upbeat variety,
and all are speeded and tightened
up for concert. Most tunes either
featured a Lorber or a Gorelick
solo or both.
Highlights of the 90-minute
show included a sax solo by
Gorelick without the aid of the
rest of the band and a funky Jack
son bass solo in "Can't Get
Enough." McClain's guitar
solos, though not overly com
plicated, fit into the mold of the
songs well. His "heavy metal"
sound and mediocre voice makes
JLF that much more multi
dimensional.
The next night after the
Waldorf shows, JLF played at
Santa Clara's Meayer Theater, a
luxurios theater ha!! perfect for a
concert of JLF's size. Saturday's
show, although similar to Fri
day's, was by no means identical.
The quintet played two different
songs than the night before and,
as usual, the improvised solos
were different.
But the five men that make up
the Jeff Lorber Fusion were the
same. Backstage after the Santa
Clara show, they again were real
people. They visited with friends,
told stories about past ex
periences on tours, and joked
about new bands they might play
in.
Kenny G, through all this, was
collecting vegetables that were
neatly arranged on a tray in the
dressing room and putting them
in a clear plastic bag.
"Vege thief," shouted Griffin

from the other side of the room.
Gorelick smjled at Griffin and
reminded him of the next day's
long van ride to their next concert

site. "I'm going to get hungry,"
he said. "But you won't see these
veges in the same form tomor
row." Gorelick was referring to

his soup fetish.
"I gotta go," he said, twisting
the now-full bag shut. "I got to
warm up for the next show."
