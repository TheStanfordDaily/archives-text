# The 						Dregs lose more than a violin
## 
### MARK ZEIGLER 
It may not seem like a big
deal when a rock band loses
its violinist. So what? Violins
and kick-ass rock 'n roll don't
mix anyway.
But for an instrumental
rock group called the Dregs,
losing their violinist may have
serious consequences — on
their band as well as on the
rest of the industry.
M icrophones have
amplified the sound of violins
in electric bands for only
about 10 years (I think John
McLaughlin's Mahavishnu
Orchestra was the first). Jean-
Luc Ponty, the French
jazz/fusion violoinist, has
made the most waves and
probably the most money us
ing the string instrument.
But the Dregs, formerly the
Dixie Dregs, have become one
of the more innovative, let
alone versatile, bands that sell
albums in the rock section of
the record store and use an
electric violin as their lead in
strument.
The formerly five- but now

Four-man group appeared last
Wednesday night at San
Francisco's Kabuki night
club. And although their
show was brilliant compared
to that of other bands, some
thing was missing. Translated
into simple terms, they need a
violin player — bad.
The funny thing of it is, the
Dregs, the four-man version
that is, contain enough talent
to fill the solo and melody
space vacated by the de
parture of Mark O'Connor
the national fiddling cham
pion. " r
Guitarist/band lead
er/song writer Steve Morse
has to be one of the top guitar
players in the country today.
He plays extremely fast, is
emotional and can perform all
kinds of music with equal ex
cellence. During the concert,
Morse went from hard rock to
fusion to country to classical
guitar.
To make up for the absence
of O'Connor, Morse played
most of the melodies as well as
his usual solos, giving the

songs a one dimensional ef
fect.
But if playing without a vio
linist had any good effects, it
was that it allowed the rest of
the band members to exhibit
their talent too. In the past,
there just wasn't enough solo
ing time to go around for
those other than Morse and
O'Connor.
The two biggest changes
evident last Wednesday from
the "violin days" was the im
provement of bassist Andy
West and keyboardist T

Lavitz. Both were shouldered
with the burden of more spot
light time and the two re
sponded well. West played
difficult bass riffs with a pick
and even managed to "pop"
and "slap" once and a while.
Lavitz picked up co-soloing
honors on an old Dregs tune
called "The Bash," one that
used to feature a Morse-
O'Connor guitar/fiddle duel.
Although Lavitz played his
part well, it didn't have the
same country flavor present in
past versions of the song.

A problem with replacing
someone li4ce O'Connoris that
you don't; you can't do any
better than the national fiddl
ing champ. And it is virtually
impossible to find a violinist
good enough to play the
Dregs' intricately difficult
m usic; he also has to be able to
play rock and county and
jazz/fusion competently.
However, a handful of such
violinists do exist. O'Connor
was the group's second vio
linist, as he replaced original
Dixie Dreg. Alan Sloan. One
possible replacement could be
former Mahavishnu Or
chestra violinist Jerry Good
man, who made a surprise ap
pearance last spring in the Bay
Area with a local jazz/rock
band called the Warriors. In
the Warriors' Keystone Palo
Alto show, Goodman showed
he hasn't lost a bit of his old
Mahavishnu form.
The Dregs played an almost
identical show to their War
field Theater once last spring.
But all the songs involving ex
tensive violin work were

either shortened or changed
to accomodate the other in
struments.
The Dregs also unveiled
two new songs, to appear on a
forthcoming album. Both
sounded as if the were written
for just a guitarist, bassist,
drummer and keyboardist; no
trace of a violin part was evi
dent. In other words, it
doesn't seem as if the Dregs
plan to replace O'Connor, at
least before their next LP.
Mistake. Losing the violin
has left the Dregs a rather
bland band. They no longer
can claim any difference from
your basic Mark IV rock
group other than that they
don't have a vocalist. But just
removing a singer from a
band doesn't do the trick.
The Dregs' problems aren't
just internal ones. The rock
industry, badly in need of a
breath of fresh air, will suffer
if innovative bands like the
Dregs fall apart.
And right now, the Dregs
are playing like team a man
short. Good luck.
