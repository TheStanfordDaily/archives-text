## 'Chilly Scenes of Winter' 
### STEVE VINEBERG 
The main characters in Joan
Micklin Silver's Chilly Scenes of
Winter — Charles (John Heard),
Laura (Mary Beth Hurt), the
married woman he adores, and
Sam (Peter Riegert), his some
time roommate — are survivors
of the '60s generation trying to
adjust to the banal, workaday
world they trained themselves to
reject. They've lived in straight
society for a few years (they're
all around 30) but they still find it
boring and unfulfilling, and deal
with it as though it were transit
ory, a phase in their lives that
they can goof about someday.
And there's something touching
and appealing about their efforts
to confront this world that alien
ates them, to appease it by ap
proaching it with a kind of expe
dient logic. Laura can't make up
her mind whether or not to leave
her husband, so she separates
from him on a trial basis and be
cause she might return at any
moment, refuses to buy furniture
for herself — just to be practical.
Charles loves Laura so much that
he thinks his persistence will
break down all barriers between
them, and when Laura's husband
doesn't disappear, as Charles
dreamed he would, Charles ag
rees to acknowledge his rival's
existence so long as Laura con
tinues to divide her life between
the two men. These characters
behave like hopeless romantics
in a relentlessly unromantic
world.
Joan Micklin Silver has never
had a hit movie, though there
was considerable virtue in her
debut film, Hester Street, and in
her adaptation of F. Scott
Fitzgerald's story "Bernice Bobs
Her Hair" for the PBS American
Short Story series. She's a
screenwriter-director, and the
fact that her ear far outvalues her
eye may explain why relatively
few people have taken notice of
her: when you think back on

Chilly Scenes of Winter a month
later, you tend to hear it in your
head rather than see it. It's rather
a cramped, unattractive piece of
filmmaking — sloppily framed,
visually unvaried, and so
haphazard in selection of loca
tions that it sometimes looks like
a mediocre student film. Silver's
unsophisticated grasp of the
medium makes the picture seem
slighter than it is. Her strengths
show up when the actors open
their mouths and the words that
float out of them seem exactly
right: revue sketch dialogue,
put-ons, elaborately conceived
armor against the levelling
power of the straights. She sees
to it that the characters' language
will illuminate their quirks and
insecurities and then alerts the
actors to remain sensitive to it.
On Charles and Laura's first
date, she offers him wine; seeing
that her apartment is bereft of
furniture, he mimes a wine glass.
When a blind candy vendor in
the lobby of Charles' office
building asks Charles what he
wants, he responds to this perfect
stranger with a declaration of his
love for Laura. Charles and
Laura — and Sam, too, who
throws lighted matches over the
edge of the dining-room light fix
ture — speak the language of
their era, which has become a
kind of code.
Silver adapted her film from
Ann Beattie's first novel, and it's
one of the few examples of a
movie that improves on material
by a talented writer. I had to
force myself to finish the book,
because the characters were
locked in patterns that became
rapidly less interesting as the
story wore on, and the dialogue
seemed blocked in, as it often
does in the kind of stories The
New Yorker prints regularly —
stories that contain almost no
thing except dialogue. Beattie's
characters behave like people
with permanent hangovers, and
after a while, their somber pro
nouncements and futile, half
hearted actions made me feel
like I had a hangover. But Silver
alters the tone of the dialogue, so
that it turns in on itself and

laughs at its own self
seriousness. Or perhaps she has
simply found the right way to
read Beattie's novel. In any case,
the movie is a sweet-natured,
light comedy built around a
warm, ebullient hero.
When Silver originally re
leased it, in 1979, she called it
Head Over Heels, and though it
attained cult status in Boston it
faded in other large cities, or else
didn't open at all. Silver recut it
before redistributing it as Chilly
Scenes of Winter (Beattie's title),
dropping the "happy" ending
she had derived from the book,
and this new version has been
generally acknowledged as an
improvement, from the title on
down. I never had an opportun
ity to see Head Over Heels, but I
must say that though it sounds
like a fatuous title, it's actually
far more appropriate for a
romantic comedy about a man so

indiscriminately enamored of a
woman that he drives her away.
And the revised ending struck
me as unsatisfying, because it
demands a transformation in
Charles that his conduct in no
way prepares us for. Beattie's
ending wasn't happy, in any case
— it just extended the relation
ship a little longer. Charles' ir
repressible, obsessive personal
ity and Laura's indecisive, ter
rified one couldn't possibly sus
tain a long-term love affair, and
Beattie knows that just as well as
we do.
John Heard's quavering,
crackling voice (he sounds a little
like Dustin Hoffman here)
matches Mary Beth Hurt's small,
tinkling one, and their perfor
mances complement each other,
too. Charles and Laura respond
so quickly to each other's sense
of humor that you can see why
they fall in love: inside of one

evening, they develop the kind of
rhythm married couples or close
friends have who finish each
other's sentences. I've never
seen better work from either of
these performers, and in fact
Heard's funny, sensitive acting in
this movie (his timing suggests a
counterculture Fred Astaire)
caused me to respond to him, for
the first time, with unmixed ad
miration. (He played a crippled
vet in Cutter's Way and a
zookeeper in Cat People with
considerably less success. Mary
Beth Hurt has also been seen as
the vocationless sister in Woody
Allen's Interiors and as Robin
Williams' wife in The World Ac
cording to Garp.) Peter Riegert
is very good, too, as are Gloria
Grahame (looking like an over
grown '30s starlet — a less
ludicrous, much more amusing
Baby Jane) as Charles' batty
mother, Nora Heflin as one of his

Co-workers, Frances Bay as a sol
icitous lunatic, and especially the
endlessly remarkable Kenneth
McMillan as Grahame's hus
band. The less memorable cam
eos are generally the result of an
overzealous attempt on Silver's
part to satirize the ordinary
world Charles is in constant con
flict with: in the worst scenes,
we're back at the party scene in
The Graduate, hearing pompous
bores with granite jaws espous
ing the glory of plastics. In the
best scenes, we're firmly en
sconced in human territory.
