The characters in Chilly
Scenes of Winter cherish a nos
talgia for the'6os; in the Austra
lian film Winter of Our Dreams,

Rolling Stone photograph
the nostalgia belongs to John
Duigan, who wrote and directed
it. Rob (Bryan Brown) is a one
time radical who now runs a
bookstore and shares an uneasy
open marriage with a teacher,
Gretel (Cathy Downes); he has
defused his political energies
and, bored as hell, expends more
time and concentration on com
puterized chess than he does on
either his professional or his pri
vate life. Lou (Judy Davis), a
hooker addicted to dope, strives
to remake herself in the image of
a dead friend, Lisa, a probable
suicide whose path out of politi
cal activism and folk music led
her to heroin. Rob, an old school
pal and possibly a lover of Lisa's,
represents Lou's link to her; she
falls in love with him, just as Lisa
claims (in her diary) she did, but
Rob refuses to admit that such a
liaison existed, just as he refuses
to respond to Lou's advances.
In the movie's term, these de
nials of Rob's constitute a failure
to revitalize himself, though the
alternative — a romance with a
woman with whom he has no
thing in common, a woman,
moreover, unstable enough to
want to take on a dead friend's
identity — may seem ludicrous
to most of us. But Duigan
doesn't seem to perceive Lou's
movement toward Lisa as unsta
ble. It gets her off junk, and in
the last scene she begins to make
friends with a group of politicals
who are sitting in (for an un
explained cause) down at the
docks. These people come right
out of a "Make Love, Not War"
poster: they smile glowing, open
smiles that signify inner peace
while they sit around sharing
food, petting dogs and singing
Joan Baez-like ballads. In the
scene just previous to this one,
Rob stayed behind in the locker
room while his soccer buddies —
assimilated former radicals lilke
himself who call their team "The
Trotskyites" —drag their beards
and incipient paunches onto the
field: an image of division, alie
nation, solitude. I may be misin
terpreting Duigan's intentions
here, but I think he is positing
these treacly protesters as the
only solution to anomie. If not —
if he is saying that Lou is as much
doomed as Lisa and Rob — then
his sentimentality for the past
these two grew away from effects
alterations on his scheme that he
is unconscious of. Gretel and her
pretentious, vacuous friends
provoke Duigan's anger, so he
satirizes them so unmercifully
that their world appears more
vile and poisonous than the
scummy existence Lou leads on
the streets. And we care much
more about Lou than about Rob,
who, though amiable enough, is
so inscrutable that one might
conclude he simply doesn't have
a center. The movie is sincere
and not unintelligent, and Judy

Davis (the star of My Brilliant
Career) gives Lou some mo
ments of real vibrance — when
she isn't trying too hard to win
the Jane Fonda Award for Most
Convincing Portrayal of a Prosti
tute. But I left the theater con
fused, as though Duigan had
omitted some important clue.
