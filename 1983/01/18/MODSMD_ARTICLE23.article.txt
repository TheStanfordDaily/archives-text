# Can't blame him for trying

### JEFF SANTOSUOSSO 
Warren Zevon took a tip from
his pal Bruce Springsteen's dar
ing on Nebraska and gave a solo
recital Jan. 8 at the Old Waldorf.
Credit Zevon with broadening
the path of performance and
creativity by baring himself
onstage. But buyer beware! Al
though quite touching in its
penultimate set, Zevon's per
formance was inconsistent and
poorly planned and executed.
Zevon opened the show with
the slashy introductory riff of
"Lawyers, Guns and Money,"
which proved deceptive, as the
rest of the song fell flatly into the
mire of Zevon's distracted
Strumming as he sang the verse.
The notes just lay there in a suc
cession of first-lesson uncer
tainty and established the prece
dent for flimsy guitar numbers.
Z His second number, "Hasten
Down the Wind" of Linda
Ronstadt fame, revealed his de
bate madness at the keyboard. It
(hit the rift between the moving
giano ballads and the faceless
guitar works even deeper as
everyone seemed to prompt him
fp the baby-grand and away from
the six- or 12-string.
t "The Envoy" and"The Over
draft," two of his latest hits, reit
erated his bland ax-work. Even
the pointed lyrics of the former
and the rousing chorus of the lat
ter couldn't save the songs.
Bui Zevon hit the heights of
the performance during a set of
four songs that preceded the
wild "Werewolves of London"
and his departure. "Roland, the
Headless Thompson Gunner,"
one of a trio from the Excitable
Boy album in this set, triumphed
even without the audience sing
ing "that counter thing." Zevon
descended from the rising lyrics
into a quiet solo that let the angry
sentiments breathe a little until he
pounded the low notes to close
the song. On his one decent
guitar song, "Mohammed's
Radio," he threatened to slip
back into the depths of the blase,
as he forgot the words to the sec

ond verse. With help from the
audience, he recovered and
rendered another strong vocal
interpretation, which was fol
lowed by "Accidently, Like a
Martyr" and a special treat,
"Veracruz."
Here, Zevon finally used his
need to walk around stage to
grab a smoke, a drink (water
only!) and a harmonica effec
tively. His earlier fumbling
around served only to confuse
the crowd, slow the pace of the
recital to a crawl, and break up
any sense of cohesion to the per
formance. But this time, his
fidgeting let the impact of the
preceding numbers mount and
then slowly dissipate. There was
no way that "Werewolves of
London," pointed so boister
ously at Susan Sonntag, Ronald
and Nancy Reagan, Jimmy Buf
fet, Jackson Browne and Gary
Gilmore, and interspersed with
new choruses like "Werewolves
of Daly City," could succeed fol
lowing the touching grace of the
previous set. Instead, the break
delivered the crowd from the
tight, wrenching melancholy to
the rowdiness of the Zevon
trademark.
The encore, "Sleep When Tm
Dead," was anticlimactic, but it
didn't matter, anyway. Most
people realized that Zevon
needed some practice and plan
ning.
A solo effort is a hell of a tough
thing to deliver, especially the
first time around. The slightest
miscue cannot be covered-up by
the drummer or guitarist.
Broken guitar strings and forgot
ten lyrics, although possibly lead
ing to some amusing ad-libbing,
are magnified in their silent dis
sonance when there is only one
man on stage. Although there
was no doubt about Zevon's in
tentions, the strength of his voice
(even though it cracked on some
of the highs), or his ability to
carry a tune on the piano, the
disjointed pace and measly
guitar work left even the yearn
ing loyalists unimpressed.
