# 'Le Beau Manage'
## 
### 
Sabine (Beatrice Romand),
the heroine of Eric Rohmer'sL*
Beau Mariage, admits to being
frank, impulsive, independent
and argumentative, but as the
movie unfolds ("persists" might
be a better word) we find out that
she isn't half as interesting as she
makes herself sound. Tumbling
out of a clumsy affair with a mar
ried painter (Feodor Atkine),
she determines to get married —
to Edmond (Andre Dussollier),
the lawyer cousin of her best
friend (Arielle Dombasle). He
doesn't appear to have much
personality, but still she pursues
him with the singlemindedness
of Truffaut's Adele H. hounding
her indifferent lieutenant half
way across the world — she
phones his office day after day,
lures him out to the provinces,
where she lives, with the promise
of an antique pitcher he's seek
ing, throws a party so that she
can invite him to it, and eventu
ally makes a scene in front of his
secretary. Unfortunately, Sabine
isn't witty or frightening like
Adele H., and Rohmer doesn't
dissect her passion the way Truf
faut did; anyway, it's not passion,
just pouting wilfulness that con
verts itself perversely into obses
sion. Rohmer used to make mar
velous comedies founded on the
theory that if extremely literate,
vivacious people conversed intel
ligently on screen for an hour
and a half, we'd be riveted. But
Rohmer's technique of holding
the camera for long spaces of
time on speakers and listeners
doesn't work when he fails to
provide characters worth listen
ing to.
