# Task force considering central waste facility
## 
### ALISON SOUTH 
A centralized waste disposal facility
may be built in the future if a new task
force on hazardous waste management
recommends its construction at a Feb.
5 meeting.
The task force, appointed by Gerald
l.ieberman, dean of graduate studies, is
working with health physics and health
and safety to assess current waste man
agement programs and the problems
they generate.
"In principle, the faculty members
agreed that centralization of manage
ment of wastes would be an effective
alternative to the existing decen
tralized program. But there is still a
question of efficiency and cost," ac
cording to Roland Finston, director of
health physics.
Alain Decleve, director of health
and safety, said, "There has been a
tremendous increase in public aware
ness of the need to better control the
disposal of hazardous waste which has
resulted in more stringent regulatory
requirements including accountability.
These issues cannot be taken lightly,
and we are embarked in an effort to
raise the level of consciousness of all
those who use, generate or dispose of
hazardous materials on campus."
In a December meeting, task force
members analyzed the different man
agement systems for the three
categories of toxic waste generated at
the Hospital and research labs.
Health physics has a centralized
program for radioactive waste and
health and safety has a separate cen

tralized system for chemical waste.
The management of decentralized
systems for the disposal of biological,
infectious and pathological material is
shared by health and safety, the De
partment of Laboratory Animal
Medicine and the Hospital.
Centralized management would
have sole jurisdiction over all proce
dures involving hazardous wastes here.
This would include waste treatment —
sterilization and neutralization — and
packaging, handling, storage and in
cineration, according to Decleve.
Decleve said a central management
would give a single, cohesive direction
to waste streams, aid in identification
of materials and eliminate confusion
over toxic waste content.
The two existing incinerators are old,
inadequate and poorly located, accord
ing to Decleve. The University cur
rently relies on annual "patch-up"
methods to maintain the outdated
machines. "It's an emergency situa
tion," he said.
The task force wants to avoid an
"overkill" in waste management/
facility recommendations and to focus
on the most realistic approach to the
University's safety needs, Decleve
said.
According to Joan Kojola, a health
and safety specialist, hazardous waste
disposal conditions have improved re
cently. "Disposal of chemicals that was
before improper has now improved
300 percent," she said.
The task force will meet on Feb. 5.
