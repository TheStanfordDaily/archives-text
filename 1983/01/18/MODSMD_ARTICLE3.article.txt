# Stanford ranks high in recent grad study
## 
### BOB COHN Staff writer 
Stanford graduate schools ranked
second in the nation in graduate school
faculty and rated in the top 10 in the
nation in 25 of 32 departments in a
recent study conducted by four na
tional academic organizations.
The rankings were based on a "repu
tational" scale in which faculty mem
bers rated the academic quality of their
peers across the country.
UC-Berkeley was ranked number
one by the study, with 28 of its depart
ments rated in the top 10.
The departments of computer sci
ence and psychology received
number-one ratings, while mechanical
engineering and statistics ranked sec
ond in the country.
In addition to Cal and Stanford,
Harvard, UCLA, the University of
Chicago, Princeton, Yale, the Univer
sity of Michigan, Massachusetts Insti
tute of Technology, Columbia and the
University of Wisconsin respectively
round out the top 10.
"I think it is an interesting measure
and a good one," Gerald Lieberman,
vice provost and dean of graduate
studies and research, said. "It'sart indi
cator of quality, but not the indicator,"
he stressed.
The study was conducted by the
Conference Board of Associated Re
search Councils, an ad hoc group con
sisting of the American Council of
Learned Societies, the American
Council on Education, the National
Research Council, and the Social Sci
ence Research Council. The study was
based on a poll of 5000 faculty mem
bers from 228 colleges and universities.
Fifteen areas besides reputation
were rated in the study, including the
number of journal articles published by
a department's faculty members. The
University ranked ninth, with seven of
23 departments in the top 10.
Aftfiougfi rnc C/nfvcrs/ty rated lower
in the area of publication than reputa
tion, Lieberman said this is not a reflec
tion of faculty or University priority.

"No matter what, I think that the fa
culty is interested in making research
available to their peers." He added that
"it (research and publication) is a self
imposed but important part" of many
professor's careers.
Prof. Paul David, chairman of the
economics department, said, "I don't
think there'sanybody who places much
weight on these (number of articles
published) rankings. The frequency
with which the faculty published in
journals is not an accurate index of the
quality of their articles."
In addition, both David and Lieber
man noted that the size of Stanford
departments is usually smaller than
those of other universities, and thus the
volume of published articles is rela
tively smaller.
David said Harvard's economics
department, which ranked above Stan
ford's in reputation and publications
has a faculty of 50 to 60, while Stanford
has 42.
Despite the University's high rank
ings, some professors see limitations in
this type of ranking system.
"Whichever criterion you choose for
ranking places, none of them is going to
be perfect," Prof. Stan Wojcicki.
chairman of the physics department
said. "One really has to be rather leerv
of any kind of ranking based on any
single criterion."
"They do not attempt to evaluate the
quality of the instruction program,"
David said. "If they took into account
the effectiveness and quality of
graduate programs I think that we're
on a par with M.1.T.," he said, referring
to the top-ranked economic school
Wojcicki feels that the reputation of
the physics department, which placed
in a tie for seventh, is ranked lower
than the capabilities of the depart
ment's faculty really indicate. "My
guess is that, per faculty member, we
should rank higher," he said. "I'm wil
»*««--* up oui Kc-pii tmoni mgotmt
any one in the country."
"We have on the faculty some very
good people who have already made an
impact on the field and I expect them to
make more of an impact in the future,"
Wojcicki continued. "I think that in the
future our reputation will rise," he ad
ded.
Prof. John Perry, chairman of the
philosophy department, was also hesit
ant to accept the rankings at face value.
"1 think it's like student evaluation of
teachers — it's information but it re
quires careful evaluation," he said.
"I'm happy to see them ranked in the
top 10, but some of those (ahead of
Stanford) have seen better days,"
Perry added.
Lieberman sees the category of top

10 as more meaningful than the actual
ranking number. "1 hate to say that
Stanford being number one in psychol
ogy is better than the number two," he
The number of top 10 rankings is
obviously dependent on the number of
graduate schools that a given university
has, he said. For instance, Stanford
does not have a geography depart
ment — one of the 32 departments
considered in the rankings. By the
same token, Harvard has no engineer
ing school.
In the past few years there have been
a multitude of rankings and surveys
conducted, and yet Lieberman inter
prets this one as of major significance.
"The last study of this magnitude
was made 13 years ago," he said.
"From that point of view, one has to
look at it (this ranking) seriously."

second in the nation in graduate school
faculty and rated in the top 10 in the
nation in 25 of 32 departments in a
recent study conducted by four na
tional academic organizations.
The rankings were based on a "repu
tational" scale in which faculty mem
bers rated the academic quality of their
peers across the country.
UC-Berkeley was ranked number
one by the study, with 28 of its depart
ments rated in the top 10.
The departments of computer sci
ence and psychology received
number-one ratings, while mechanical
engineering and statistics ranked sec
ond in the country.
In addition to Cal and Stanford,
Harvard, UCLA, the University of
Chicago, Princeton, Yale, the Univer
sity of Michigan, Massachusetts Insti
tute of Technology, Columbia and the
University of Wisconsin respectively
round out the top 10.
"I think it is an interesting measure
and a good one," Gerald Lieberman,
vice provost and dean of graduate
studies and research, said. "It'sart indi
cator of quality, but not the indicator,"
he stressed.
The study was conducted by the
Conference Board of Associated Re
search Councils, an ad hoc group con
sisting of the American Council of
Learned Societies, the American
Council on Education, the National
Research Council, and the Social Sci
ence Research Council. The study was
based on a poll of 5000 faculty mem
bers from 228 colleges and universities.
Fifteen areas besides reputation
were rated in the study, including the
number of journal articles published by
a department's faculty members. The
University ranked ninth, with seven of
23 departments in the top 10.
Aftfiougfi rnc C/nfvcrs/ty rated lower
in the area of publication than reputa
tion, Lieberman said this is not a reflec
tion of faculty or University priority.

"No matter what, I think that the fa
culty is interested in making research
available to their peers." He added that
"it (research and publication) is a self
imposed but important part" of many
professor's careers.
Prof. Paul David, chairman of the
economics department, said, "I don't
think there'sanybody who places much
weight on these (number of articles
published) rankings. The frequency
with which the faculty published in
journals is not an accurate index of the
quality of their articles."
In addition, both David and Lieber
man noted that the size of Stanford
departments is usually smaller than
those of other universities, and thus the
volume of published articles is rela
tively smaller.
David said Harvard's economics
department, which ranked above Stan
ford's in reputation and publications
has a faculty of 50 to 60, while Stanford
has 42.
Despite the University's high rank
ings, some professors see limitations in
this type of ranking system.
"Whichever criterion you choose for
ranking places, none of them is going to
be perfect," Prof. Stan Wojcicki.
chairman of the physics department
said. "One really has to be rather leerv
of any kind of ranking based on any
single criterion."
"They do not attempt to evaluate the
quality of the instruction program,"
David said. "If they took into account
the effectiveness and quality of
graduate programs I think that we're
on a par with M.1.T.," he said, referring
to the top-ranked economic school
Wojcicki feels that the reputation of
the physics department, which placed
in a tie for seventh, is ranked lower
than the capabilities of the depart
ment's faculty really indicate. "My
guess is that, per faculty member, we
should rank higher," he said. "I'm wil
»*««--* up oui Kc-pii tmoni mgotmt
any one in the country."
"We have on the faculty some very
good people who have already made an
impact on the field and I expect them to
make more of an impact in the future,"
Wojcicki continued. "I think that in the
future our reputation will rise," he ad
ded.
Prof. John Perry, chairman of the
philosophy department, was also hesit
ant to accept the rankings at face value.
"1 think it's like student evaluation of
teachers — it's information but it re
quires careful evaluation," he said.
"I'm happy to see them ranked in the
top 10, but some of those (ahead of
Stanford) have seen better days,"
Perry added.
Lieberman sees the category of top

10 as more meaningful than the actual
ranking number. "1 hate to say that
Stanford being number one in psychol
ogy is better than the number two," he
The number of top 10 rankings is
obviously dependent on the number of
graduate schools that a given university
has, he said. For instance, Stanford
does not have a geography depart
ment — one of the 32 departments
considered in the rankings. By the
same token, Harvard has no engineer
ing school.
In the past few years there have been
a multitude of rankings and surveys
conducted, and yet Lieberman inter
prets this one as of major significance.
"The last study of this magnitude
was made 13 years ago," he said.
"From that point of view, one has to
look at it (this ranking) seriously."
