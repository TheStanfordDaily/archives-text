# University establishes freeze on fraternity, sorority housing
## 
### SID ATKINS Staff writer 
In a widely-distrihuted memorandum issued this
weekend. Dean of Student Affairs Jim Lyons formally
announced that the University will no longer accept peti
tions for housing from recognized fraternities and
sororities.
No petitions for housing have been accepted from frat
ernal organizations — fraternities and sororities - since
this September. Bu; I yons felt it was ncce>\ary t'- for
malize the tree/.e due to the recent opening of eight new
houses on campus and the increased student interest on the
question.
"The freeze is designed to allow time for full and open
discussions of Stanford fraternal groups in general and
residential fraternal groups in particular Lyons wrote in

the memo.
According to Diana Conklin, director of the Row, there
are no pending housing petitions from eligible groups. If
the freeze were not in effect, four officially-recognized
fraternal organizations would be eligible to petition, but
Conklin said, "The message I get is that they're not in
terested in housing right now."
This may not be the case in the future, however, as more
and more University housing space becomes available,
according to Lyons. "If we announced that a house was
available, I can almost guarantee you that we would have
five groups wanting to move in right away. We don't have
the demand right now, but that may increase with the
availability (of houses)," he said.
"It's time for us to look again at the proportion of the
residential system that we want to allocate to fraternal

organizations," Lyons said.
There are currently 12 fraternities with houses on cam
pus, and 16 other fraternal organizations that could be
eligible for housing in the near future. If all these groups
were to be recognized and housed, according to Lyons,
there would be 28 fraternal organizations on campus —
two more than the all-time high reached in 1960.
"This would represent a significant change in the resi
dential environment. It would not be a trivial situation, so
we need to set up some policy guidelines (concerning when
the University wi 11 allow fraternal organizations to be
housed)," Lyons said.
According to senior Katherine Mills, president of Delta
Gamma, one of the three sororities recognized by the
University, the members of her sorority are divided on
whether they would like a house on campus if one were

available. "We may want a house in the distant future, but
right now what we'd really like is some office space," Mills
said.
Senior Kirsten Sanders, chairman of the Recognition
Committee for Alpha Phi, a sorority recognized last week,
said that her group has not thought about getting a house.
"Having our members in dorms is actually an advantage,
we feel, because that way the sorority provides additional
contacts outside of the dorm."
The Zeta Psi fraternity, which lost its campus housing
last year, will not be affected by the new rule, according to
Lyons. "Their housing privilege has been suspended, not
withdrawn. The agreement we have with them says they
can get back in their house in four years, and we're not
going to pull new rules on them," Lyons said.
