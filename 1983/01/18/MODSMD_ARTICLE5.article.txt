Reagan suggests delayed cost-of-living increases
Washington — President Reagan will propose a six-month delay this year
in cost-of-living increases for government pensions, veterans' payments and
railroad retirement benefits as part of a drive to keep the fiscal 1984 budget
deficit below $200 billion, administration officials said yesterday.
If Congress goes along with the proposal, which parallels a similar six
month delay in cost-of-living raises recommended for Social Security reci
pients, the payments would be postponed from May until November of this
year.
Both retired military personnel and civilian employees of the federal gov
ernment would be affected by the president's decision, which would save an
estimated SI .5 billion in fiscal vear 1984, which starts Oct. I.
Reagan also will recommend a $40 billion standby tax increase for fiscal
1986 that would be imposed onlv if the federal deficit for that year exceeds 2
percent of the Gross National Product, estimated at SlOO billion, the of
ficials said.
But a Department of the Treasury spokesman denied a published report
that the administration is leaning toward a $5-a-barrel oil tax that would add
1 2 cents to the price of a gallon of gasoline, along with a surcharge of I per
cent of taxable income in the contingency tax package.
Other officials, who asked not to be identified, said some simple formula
to impose a surcharge on taxable income or a surtax on federal income tax
bills would be part of the president's new budget that would be sent to Con
gress Jan. 31. For example, a surcharge of I percent on taxable income of
530,000 after deductions would be $300. In the case of a surtax of 10 percent,
a taxpaver with a tax bill of $5000 would pav an extra $500.
Businessmen call for tough stand with Nakasone
Washington — American business and labor leaders asked President Rea
gan vesterdav to take a tough stand on economic issues in today's much
awaited meeting with Japan's new prime minister, Yasuhiro Nakasone.
The pleas of the Americans, who cited the distressed U.S. economy and
Japanese trade practices, blended with the sound of sirens from the arrival
motorcade as the Japanese visitor and his party sped past the White House
into town for a three-dav official visit.
According to business participants in yesterday's meeting, Reagan lis
tened carefullv, but did not disclose the plans for his presentation to
Nakasone. Howcxer, a senior adminstration official forecast that Reagan
will walk "a vcrv delicate line" between praising Nakasone for unusually
vigorous efforts during his seven weeks in office and requesting additional
"prompt action" to meet U.S. concerns in both economicand military fields.
