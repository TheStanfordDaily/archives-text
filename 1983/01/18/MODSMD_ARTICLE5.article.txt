Reagan suggests delayed cost-of-living increases
Washington — President Reagan will propose a six-month delay this year
in cost-of-living increases for government pensions, veterans' payments and
railroad retirement benefits as part of a drive to keep the fiscal 1984 budget
deficit below $200 billion, administration officials said yesterday.
If Congress goes along with the proposal, which parallels a similar six
month delay in cost-of-living raises recommended for Social Security reci
pients, the payments would be postponed from May until November of this
year.
Both retired military personnel and civilian employees of the federal gov
ernment would be affected by the president's decision, which would save an
estimated SI .5 billion in fiscal vear 1984, which starts Oct. I.
Reagan also will recommend a $40 billion standby tax increase for fiscal
1986 that would be imposed onlv if the federal deficit for that year exceeds 2
percent of the Gross National Product, estimated at SlOO billion, the of
ficials said.
But a Department of the Treasury spokesman denied a published report
that the administration is leaning toward a $5-a-barrel oil tax that would add
1 2 cents to the price of a gallon of gasoline, along with a surcharge of I per
cent of taxable income in the contingency tax package.
Other officials, who asked not to be identified, said some simple formula
to impose a surcharge on taxable income or a surtax on federal income tax
bills would be part of the president's new budget that would be sent to Con
gress Jan. 31. For example, a surcharge of I percent on taxable income of
530,000 after deductions would be $300. In the case of a surtax of 10 percent,
a taxpaver with a tax bill of $5000 would pav an extra $500.
Businessmen call for tough stand with Nakasone
Washington — American business and labor leaders asked President Rea
gan vesterdav to take a tough stand on economic issues in today's much
awaited meeting with Japan's new prime minister, Yasuhiro Nakasone.
The pleas of the Americans, who cited the distressed U.S. economy and
Japanese trade practices, blended with the sound of sirens from the arrival
motorcade as the Japanese visitor and his party sped past the White House
into town for a three-dav official visit.
According to business participants in yesterday's meeting, Reagan lis
tened carefullv, but did not disclose the plans for his presentation to
Nakasone. Howcxer, a senior adminstration official forecast that Reagan
will walk "a vcrv delicate line" between praising Nakasone for unusually
vigorous efforts during his seven weeks in office and requesting additional
"prompt action" to meet U.S. concerns in both economicand military fields.
There was no indication that Reagan will shift
his basic stand, which was worked out in a meeting
with his senior advisers Friday morning. As ex
plained by administration sources, Reagan's cen
tral objectives will be to establish a close working
relationship with the new Japanese leader and to
convince Nakasone that rising protectionist senti
, ment in this country is a formidable political prob
lem with major dangers for both partners in the
Tokyo-Washington alliance.
There is no expectation in the administration,
according to the sources, that Nakasone will be
able to pledge substantial additional actions dur
ing this week's meetings. The hope is, though, that
he will use the discussions to set the stage for
further action after returning to Tokyo.
"I think it is a little unwise to expect a whole
range of specific measures to come out of a first
meeting between the president and the prime min
ister," said U.S. Trade Representative William
Brock, a key participant in economic negotiations
with Japan. "The important thing is to recognize
the need for continuing action over a period of
lime. Nakasone has taken some steps already.
Further steps will be needed."
USSR wants NATO arms pact
Bonn, West Germany — Soviet Foreign Minister
Andrei Gromvko gave a clear warning here yester
day that Moscow would be forced to take coun
termeasures if the Atlantic Alliance went ahead
with deploying new medium-range missiles in Eu
rope later this year.
The result would be the maintenance of a nucle
ar balance, "but on a higher level than at present,"
Gromvko said at a dinner given for him by Hans-
Dietrich Genscher, his West German counterpart.
Gromvko was speaking after the first full day of
talks on his visit here, including two meetings with
Genscher and a courtesy call on President Karl
Carstens.
The meeting with Genscher concentrated on the
issue of medium-range missiles, with Genscher
stressing Bonn's adherance to the "zero option"
proposed by President Reagan.
This envisages the Soviet Union dismantling all
its medium-range nuclear missiles pointing at
Western Europe, in exchange for the North Atlan
tic Treaty Organization scrapping plans to deploy
cruise and Pershing 2 missiles in West Europe be
ginning next Autumn.
West Germany would take the lion's share of the
new missiles, and the issue is expected to become a
dominant theme of the campaign for the Mar. 6
general election for a rew Parliament.
Retirement age may increase
Washington — On top of the tax increases and
benefit cuts on which they have agreed for the short
run, a majority of the president's Social Security
Advisory Commission is expected to recommend
this week that the normal retirement age be raised
from 65 to 66 beginning early in the next century. 1

Senate Finance Committee Chairman Robert
Dole (R-Kan.), a member of the commission, said
yesterday that he will back the age increase and he
expects a majority of the commission to do so, per
haps as many as i 0 of the 15 members.
A bipartisan commission majority agreed Satur
day night on steps that would provide $169 billion
over the next seven years to solve the short-term fi
nancing problems.
But that compromise, endorsed by President
Reagan and House Speaker Thomas "Tip"
O'Neill (D-Mass.), would wipe out only about
two-thirds of the system's long-range deficit. The
bipartisan majority could not reach agreement on
the remaining one-third, and it was agreed that the
15 members would make their own individual rec
ommendations on this final issue.
Social Security's short-range problems derive
mainly from the high inflation and unemployment
of recent years. The longer-range problem grows
out of demographics: the population is aging and
by early in the next century there will be fewer
workers per retiree.
USSR missiles found in Syria
Washington — U.S. intelligence sources re
ported yesterday they have confirmed the arrival of
a long-range Soviet SAM-5 anti-aircraft missile in
Syria and said there are other indications the Sovi
ets may be increasing their presence in that Arab
country.
These sources, who asked to remain anony
mous, expressed concern that the presence of such
anti-aircraft weapons, with enough range to reach
into Israeli airspace and cover much of Lebanon,
could create a new and dangerous crisis if the Is
raelis move to destroy them.
This concern was heightened by reports suggest
ing that Soviet troops may operate the SAM-5 mis
siles, which are said by experts to have a range of
between 150 and 190 miles.
About 10 days ago, American intelligence
sources said they had detected evidence that the
Soviets were preparing SAM-5 launching sites in
two locations, Dumayr, which is northeast of Da
mascus, and Horns, north of Lebanon.
According to more recent reports, at least 12
SAM-5 missile containers arrived last week at the
Syrian port of Tartus.
Soon afterward, sources said, vehicles as
sociated with SAM-5 missiles were sighted en route
to Dumayr.
Fresh reports received here say that computer
vans and other equipment identified as related to
the SAM-5 also were landed at Tartus just before
the weekend.
In all, at least 50 additonal vehicles known to be
part of the SAM-5 system, including missile trans
porters, were seen in the Damascus area, sources
said.
All this is considered confirmation that the Sovi
ets are moving ahead swiftly to set the missiles in
combat positions.
Meanwhile, other reports reaching U.S. in
telligence said that satellite communications

equipment and computer vans have appeared at
the Soviet port of Nikolayev, and U.S. analysts
belive this equipment may be shipped to Syria.
As they view it, this is significant because com
munciations equipment of this sort is used by Sovi
et forces to communicate with their general staff
headquarters in Moscow. Similar equipment has
been spotted in Afghanistan, East Germany and
Mongolia, U.S. sources said.
Court considers prayer, nukes
Washington — Controversy was evident in Su
preme Court chambers as the issues of school
prayer and California's moratorium on the con
struction of new nuclear plants confronted the jus
tices.
A Department of Justice official urged the Su
preme Court yesterday to strike down California's
moratorium on the construction of new nuclear
plants on grounds that the law conflicts with feder
al policy supporting nuclear power.
"There is a national commitment to the con
struction of new nuclear plants," Deputy Solicitor
General Louis Claiborne told the justices. Both he
and an attorney for the Pacific Gas and Electric
Co. argued that only Congress and the U.S. Nucle
ar Regulatory Commission, not the states, may im
pose limits on nuclear power.
On the other hand, Laurence Tribe, a Harvard
law professor representing California's Energy Re
sources Conservation and Development Com
mission, argued during a hearing before the court
that state governments have the right to decide that
nuclear power is, at the moment, too costly anckoo
uncertain to be allowed to go forward.
Also during yesterday's proceedings, the Su
preme Court, refusing once again to reconsider its
previous rulings on the sensitive subject of school
prayer, let stand a lower-court decision that.barred
the Lubbock, Texas, school system from allowing
student religious groups to use public school facil
ities for meetings before or after school hours.
Moderate gain in stock market

yesterday with late selling after a broad advance at
midday. Analysts said hopes for a widening eco
nomic recovery continued to help the market.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up
more than 10 at its high point for the session,
wound up at 1084.81 — 3.96 points higher than
Friday's close. New York Stock Exchange volume
reached 89.21 million shares, up from 86.48 million
in the previous session.
