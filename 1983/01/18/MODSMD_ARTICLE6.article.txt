# SURE understaffed

### JASON COLE Staff writer 
With more than a year separating
students from the reality of the last
rape on campus, Students United for
Rape Elimination (SURE) is ex
periencing difficulty in attracting
enough volunteer escorts to cover its
normal operations.
At the height of rape awareness last
winter, SURE had 60 escorts. Cur
rently, it has only 25. As a result of the
dropoff in the number of escorts,
SURE is having trouble covering its
normal 8 p.m. to 12 p.m. hours, and is
unable to provide its additional earlier
winter quarter service that begins at ft
p.m., according to director Derek P as
sart.
Dean of Student Affairs Jim Lyons
said, "The big reason for the drop-off is
the sense of security on campus. The
problems work in a cycle. When no
thing has happened for a period of
time, students don't realize that the
problem can occur," he said.
Lyons continued, "The people who
are here try to create an atmosphere of
trust. Students don't think anything
bad will happen because they can trust
the other students around them. How
ever, students are naive to think that
only Stanford people are on campus
This atmosphere of trust causes
another problem because to create
safeguards isinterpreted as a slap in the
face to others."
Missy Brown, a SURE dispatcher,
said that many women still do not use
the service. "Some women see it as a
hassle to wait five or 10 minutes for the
escort to show up. Convenience can be
dangerous," she said.
Passarelli said that even though the
number of escort requests has not de
clined significantly, SURE has lost cre
dibility with some women because es

corts have been late. "The only way to
alleviate the problem is to get more
people," she said.
To get more people. SURE is initiat
ing a media blitz through Campus
Connection and the Rape Education
Project (REP). REP will go to dorms to
present a film, discuss the problem of
rape and solicit volunteer escorts.
Passarelli said that he tries to get re
sident assistants, especially those in
freshmen dorms, to ask students to be
escorts, explaining that, "They have
more influence on students in their
dorms."
Lyons said, "If everyone who is now
a SURE escort were to ask a friend or if
some organization (i.e. a fraternity)
were to be responsible for providing a
certain number of escorts, the shortage
would be alleviated."
In addition to Lyons' vocal support,
the Office of Student Affairs
has given SURE monetary support.
OSA has lent SURE approximately
$3500 for equipment purchases and for
buying a golf cart (SURE mobile) to
improve the service. SURE will pay
back the loans with its spring quarter
fee assessment.
Asked if SURE has considered pay
ing its escorts, Passarelli said, "I really
don't feel that it's the type of work that
we should pay for. Also, I'm not sure
where we would get the money." Al
though the dispatchers are paid
through federal work-study, he said he
doubts that he could get any money
from that program.
Passarelli estimated that SURE
needs to at least double its present total
of 25 escorts to operate efficiently. In
the meantime, he said, SURE will have
to hope that it can provide an adequate
service and that it will not have to de
pend on an unfortunate attack or rape
to get people to help.
