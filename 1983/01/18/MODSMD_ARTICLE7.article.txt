# Hoop record now 9-4
## Cal cools Card, 75-61 
### STEVE ODELL 
Berkeley â€” A red-hot Stanford
basketball team was cooled off last
night when California defeated the
Cardinal 75-61 in a Pacific-10 Con
ference game at Harmon Gym.
Stanford, now 9-4 overall and 1-2
in the conference, came into the
game with a nation-leading 57.6
field goal percentage, but was only
able to connect on 41 percent of its
shots against a tightly-packed Cal
zone defense.
The Bears effectively bottled up
the inside, in particular center John
Revelli, who entered the game as
the conference's leading scorer and
field goal shooter. Revelli finished
with just seven points and got off
only three shots against Bear center
Michael Pitts and a supporting cast
of Cal defenders who sagged in to
double and triple team Revelli
every time he touched the ball.
"Pitts clearly dominated inside,"
said Stanford coach Tom Davis of
the much-anticipated match-up.
"And the fact that they are quicker
than us at every position really
bothered us. They didn't let us run
any offense, and they executed their
own offense well. Cal deserves a lot
of credit for the way they played."
The Bears, now 7-4 overall and
2-1 in league play, bolted out to a
12-3 lead and were never headed.
Four Cal players scored in double
figures, and were led by freshman
forward Dave Butler, who scored

16 points and grabbed 13 rebounds,
including one tip-in slam with 6:51
remaining that gave the Bears their
biggest lead at 58-39.
The Card came its closest with
1:33 left in the first half when it cut
the gap to one. After Bear Boh
Owen sank two foul shots to put Cal
ahead 26-22, Stanford guard Steve
Brown hit an 18-foot jump shot and
Revelli was fouled underneath on
the shot by John Ritchie.
Revelli hit the first foul shot and
when he missed the bonus, Johnny
Rogers snared the offensive re
bound, but missed on a field goal
attempt to keep the Cardinal down
by one. Buttler hit two free throws
to deter the Cardinal and Rogers hit
one from the foul line to make the
score at intermission 28-26.
As at the beginning of the game,
the Bears played strong out of the
locker room to start the second h.tlf
Stanford was only too obliged to
help, committing five turnovers in
the first five minutes. A Butch Hays
steal and a pass to a wide-open Pitts
for a slam dunk culminated an eight
point Cal streak that brought the
partisan crowd of 6000 to its feet
and the Cardinal to its knees.
Stanford was led by guard Keith
Jones, who scored 12 points off thr
bench, and forward Andy Fischer,
who played a strong game inside to
also finish with 12 points, tying his
career high.
