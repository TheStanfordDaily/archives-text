## Get employed! Career Week 
### MELISSA IGNACIO 
Last week's Career Week gave hundreds
of Stanford students an opportunity to
explore career opportunities with Bay Area
professionals from many fields.
Sponsored by the Career Planning and
Placement Center (CPPC), Career Week
provided information on 28 different pro
fessional fields. "We tried to pick some up
and-coming career fields that people don't
know about but should know about," said
Renee Filice, director of the CPPC. "For
example, technical writing and computer/
data processing are careers that liberal arts
majors can enter."
Students could choose among several ses
sions each day (held at Tresidder Union
from Jan. 10-13). Each session had a panel
consisting of four to five professionals who
gave brief talks on their jobs. Some panels
featured Stanford students who had held
internships or other related work experi
ence.
The CPPC started planning this event last
October. In earlier years, the CPPC held
career sessions at different times through
out the year, but student turnout was usu
ally low. In order to reach more students,
the CPPC staff decided to hold a Career
Week.
In addition to benefiting students by giv
ing them valuable inside information, the
career program also creates job oppor
tunities. According to Filice, many panelists
follow up their visits by contacting the
CPPC when they have job openings or want
to establish internships.
"Until we contact these professionals for
Career Week, many are unaware that we
(the CPPC) exist," Filice said. "They find
we can become a pipeline for providing out
standing future employees."
