# New Biz School dean: scholar, not businessman
## 
### KIMBERLY BROWN 
Picture the Marlboro Man. Now picture the dean of the
nation's number one graduate school of business. The im
ages are not as juxtaposed as they might seem. At least, not
in the case of the new dean of the Stanford Graduate School
of Business (GSB) Dean Robert Jaedicke.
The 53-year-old Jaedicke, a real-life Montana ranch
hand and lover of the old West, moved his barbed wire
collection to a plush spread in the GSB on Jan. 1, when he
took over as successor to Dean Rene McPherson, who
resigned for health and personal reasons.
Some observers believe that Jaedicke's selection indi
cates that the School's faculty members wanted an insider in
the driver's seat. He is the first non-businessman to take on
the job since 1958; the last three deans were all prominent
corporate executives.
Others have questioned his perceived lack of business
contacts. Jaedicke discounted this concern, noting that "this
school already has a well-developed set of contacts. It isn't
as if I'll be starting from scratch," he said.
After serving as an associate dean for academic affairs
from 1969 to 1981, Jaedicke developed close ties with —
and earned the admiration of — many of the School's
professors when he returned to teaching.
Having survived his first days on the job, Jaedicke ap
peared relaxed in his new office and comfortable with his
administrative responsibilities. He said his decision to ac
cept the position was "a major decision in the sense that the
life of a faculty member was a nice one.
"But the fact that I know the School well — and that I
know the people well — all made the job more attractive,"
he said.
Jaedicke perceives the deanship as a general managerial
job. "If you were to look at my calendar you would con
clude that 15 to 20 percent of my time will be spent with
academic affairs, 15 to 20 percent somehow interacting
with external groups, and 50 to 60 percent on development,
at least initially," he said.

The fundraising effort stands as one of the greatest chal
lenges facing Jaedicke in the coming months. He said he has
no "fundraising blue-print" yet, but in general, plans to
concentrate on those constituencies who have a mutual
interest in the School — alumni, corporations and founda
tions.

The dean was careful to emphasize that the development
effort, while time-consuming, should not take precedent
over the School's academic effort. "The dean can come out
sounding like the money-raiser," he said. "In part, I think
that is true. But I don't think I could spend 100 percent of
my time raising money. I'd run the risk of losing touch with
what it is I'm raising money for."
Jaedicke is committed to cultivating outside constituen
cies who, he said, "are important for more than simple
money-raising purposes." He said that contacts are essen
tial to understanding what is happening in the business
world.
"Even as a faculty member it was necessary to know the
managerial community," he stressed." all, we share a
mutual interest."

Jaedicke sees his role inside the School as a catalyst to
facilitate academic change rather than as the source of that
change. Acknowledging that the faculty is the School's
primary policy-setting group, he anticipates that a good part
of his job will be in implementing what the faculty wants.

"What happens in the academic
programs must be developed by the fa
culty rather than my acting as dic
tator," Jaedicke said. "The exciting
part of the process is that it is very much
that — a process."
In response to questions on actual
course content, Jaedicke said that ide
ally, the School should stay one step
ahead of the business world. But at the
same time, courses must reflect current
business techniques and problems.
In particular, Jaedicke noted that the
School is more interested now in man
agement in the not-for-profit sectors of
management. He commented upon the
increasing number of graduates secur
ing jobs as administrators in the arts,
universities and government.
In addition, the School has a special
interest in developing more courses
dealing with management in high
technology — especially considering
the University's prime location in the
midst of the Silicone Valley firms.
Jaedicke also expects an increase in
emphasizing the entrepreneurial as
pects of business." Enter preneurship is
becoming a much more important issue
to the large corporations," he said.
He underscored the importance of
courses staying one step ahead of the
business world by pointing out that in a
five-year period, typically half the
course offerings are replaced with new
ones.

One way of improving the School's
research and course development is to
expand the faculty. Jaedicke antici
pates hiring an additional 10 faculty
members within the next five years. In
addition, the total number of faculty
hired in the next 10 years, including
those hired to replace departing pro
fessors, may reach 35 or 40.
When asked about the School's
policies concerning the hiring of
women professors, Jaedicke said that
there has been a "pipeline effect on the
faculty. ... The pool of women faculty
members available was not in great
supply — by any means — 10 years
ago," he said.
"However, what is happening is that
there are more coming into the fculty
pool now," he continued. "They are
still relatively in short supply, but that
is improving at a rather remarkable
rate."

Hanover, Kansas, a ranching commun
ity of 900, graduated Phi Beta Kappa
from the University of Washington,
then went on to the University of Min
nesota for his doctorate. He taught ac
counting at Harvard University for
three years before coming to Stanford.
