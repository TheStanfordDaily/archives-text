# A 						Stanford tradition who teaches at 8
## 
### STEVEN PHILLIPS 
If you haven't had her for a
class, you probably know some
one who has. Or maybe your
father or mother had her. She
has been a fixture in the
Mathematics Department for
five decades.
Since 1943, Stanford students
have learned calculus from Prof.
Mary Sunseri. Although calculus
at 8 a.m. can be a frightening
prospect for many freshmen,
Sunseri's knowledge, teaching
ability and genuine concern for
her students help them com
prehend a difficult subject while
half asleep.
Born and raised in the San
Jose area, Sunseri has lived in the
Bay Area all of her life. "I was
rather fond of the area," she

says, "so I never thought of leav
ing." Holding a wide range of
interests in high school from the
sciences, music, drama and read
ing to basketball and baseball,
Sunseri was particularly at
tracted to algebra.
Inspired by her female math
teachers, she decided to attend
San Jose State College to pre
pare for a career teaching math
on the high school level. After
graduating with a degree in
mathematics and teaching for a
year at San Jose State and work
ing a year at Stanford as a teach
ing assistant, she applied for a
full-time job at Stanford and at
Berkeley. "I made my choice be
cause Stanford was smaller," she
says.
Her classes, however, are not

small. With a yearly total exceed
ing 300 students in the Math 19,
20, 21 series, Sunseri feels that a
large part of her "raison d'etre"
is the student. She finds two
kinds of students particularly
rewarding — "the student that is
having problems and starts get
ting it before the end of the
quarter, (and) the student who
has done well and comes back
several years later, and says,
'You know, I remember some of
the things you told me.' " These
students, she says, give her the
feeling that she "had a little to do
with where they are."
The students come back be
cause they know that Sunseri
cares about them. Recognizing
that the first year student is in a
critical period of life, she takes
care to teach the skills and
techniques of calculus in as effi
cient and painless a manner as
possible. Few students will disag
ree with the assertion that her
exams are straight-forward and
fair. "I have been very careful, I
think," she says, "to see that the
student gets (the necessary
skills)."
There is more to Sunseri,
however, than just her work. Her
limits extend far beyond those of
mathematics. "I like the out
doors, I like going to the beach, I
like reading, I like music. I don't
even mind trying out new re
cipes. 1 do just about anything."
Travelling provides a pleasant
escape for Sunseri. With trips
throughout the United States,
Canada and Europe, she retains
a special fondness for home. "I
enjoy it while I'm there, but then
it's great coming home. I like it
all," she says in her easy-going
manner.
At home, she tries to attend a
number of the on-cainpus
events. Her life is so active, in
fact, that she regrets the inevita
ble overlap between her work
and her play." It would be nice to
just close the door and forget
about it for awhile and do some
thing else, but that isn't always
possible."

Sunseri's tenure here makes
her somewhat of an authority on
Stanford. She feels that the
commitment of the students and
the quality of the instruction
have remained constant over the
years. The major changes, ac
cording to Sunseri, are products
of the expansion of the Univer
sity.
Consistent with her love for
the outdoors, she hopes that the
buildings don't overcrowd the
open spaces. The increase in stu
dents has brought other prob
lems. In the old days, "you could
walk around without getting run
over." How has Sunseri survived
five decades of change? "You
get used to it," she states simply.
How much longer can Stan
ford expect to keep Sunseri from
pursuing her diverse interests
full time? "I don't know," she
says in response to questions of
when she will leave the differen
tials and integrals for pleasure
reading and the outdoors. Al
though she contemplates retiring
every year, she just takes it
year by year. Whenever she does
retire, she will leave behind a
void in the Math Department
and thousands of students she
helped on their odysseys to
adulthood.
It is 8 a.m. Monday in early
September of any year. Hun
dreds of confused, bleary-eyed
freshmen wonder why they
aren't in bed like their fuzzy
studies friends. They do not
know that their teacher chose
this hour because of the lack of
conflicts with other classes and
because she can "get a parking
space." Nor do they know that
they are about to embark on a
difficult journey with as experi
enced, skillful, and caring
navigator as they will have
throughout the remaining four
years of their career. Many will
come to realize the quality of
their instructor. A few will even
come back and tell her that they
remember what she taught. And
Mary Sunseri has made a differ
ence — for the past 40 years.

Prof. Mary Sunseri *
If you haven't had her for a
class, you probably know some
one who has. Or maybe your
father or mother had her. She
has been a fixture in the
Mathematics Department for
five decades.
Since 1943, Stanford students
have learned calculus from Prof.
Mary Sunseri. Although calculus
at 8 a.m. can be a frightening
prospect for many freshmen,
Sunseri's knowledge, teaching
ability and genuine concern for
her students help them com
prehend a difficult subject while
half asleep.
Born and raised in the San
Jose area, Sunseri has lived in the
Bay Area all of her life. "I was
rather fond of the area," she

says, "so I never thought of leav
ing." Holding a wide range of
interests in high school from the
sciences, music, drama and read
ing to basketball and baseball,
Sunseri was particularly at
tracted to algebra.
Inspired by her female math
teachers, she decided to attend
San Jose State College to pre
pare for a career teaching math
on the high school level. After
graduating with a degree in
mathematics and teaching for a
year at San Jose State and work
ing a year at Stanford as a teach
ing assistant, she applied for a
full-time job at Stanford and at
Berkeley. "I made my choice be
cause Stanford was smaller," she
says.
Her classes, however, are not

small. With a yearly total exceed
ing 300 students in the Math 19,
20, 21 series, Sunseri feels that a
large part of her "raison d'etre"
is the student. She finds two
kinds of students particularly
rewarding — "the student that is
having problems and starts get
ting it before the end of the
quarter, (and) the student who
has done well and comes back
several years later, and says,
'You know, I remember some of
the things you told me.' " These
students, she says, give her the
feeling that she "had a little to do
with where they are."
The students come back be
cause they know that Sunseri
cares about them. Recognizing
that the first year student is in a
critical period of life, she takes
care to teach the skills and
techniques of calculus in as effi
cient and painless a manner as
possible. Few students will disag
ree with the assertion that her
exams are straight-forward and
fair. "I have been very careful, I
think," she says, "to see that the
student gets (the necessary
skills)."
There is more to Sunseri,
however, than just her work. Her
limits extend far beyond those of
mathematics. "I like the out
doors, I like going to the beach, I
like reading, I like music. I don't
even mind trying out new re
cipes. 1 do just about anything."
Travelling provides a pleasant
escape for Sunseri. With trips
throughout the United States,
Canada and Europe, she retains
a special fondness for home. "I
enjoy it while I'm there, but then
it's great coming home. I like it
all," she says in her easy-going
manner.
At home, she tries to attend a
number of the on-cainpus
events. Her life is so active, in
fact, that she regrets the inevita
ble overlap between her work
and her play." It would be nice to
just close the door and forget
about it for awhile and do some
thing else, but that isn't always
possible."

Sunseri's tenure here makes
her somewhat of an authority on
Stanford. She feels that the
commitment of the students and
the quality of the instruction
have remained constant over the
years. The major changes, ac
cording to Sunseri, are products
of the expansion of the Univer
sity.
Consistent with her love for
the outdoors, she hopes that the
buildings don't overcrowd the
open spaces. The increase in stu
dents has brought other prob
lems. In the old days, "you could
walk around without getting run
over." How has Sunseri survived
five decades of change? "You
get used to it," she states simply.
How much longer can Stan
ford expect to keep Sunseri from
pursuing her diverse interests
full time? "I don't know," she
says in response to questions of
when she will leave the differen
tials and integrals for pleasure
reading and the outdoors. Al
though she contemplates retiring
every year, she just takes it
year by year. Whenever she does
retire, she will leave behind a
