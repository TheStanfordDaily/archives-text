The fact that there is no more Alpha Sigma Phi
but may soon be an Alpha Sigma may just be
Greek to most readers, but the news struck us as
ironic and significant: the reason for last week's
name change can be traced to a time when frater
nities seemed on the way out at Stanford, and,
despite strong interest recently in the Greek sys
tem, a return of that time might not be far off.
Hard to Relieve? Let's backtrack a little bit.
Alpha Sigma Phi started 10 years ago, back
in the spring of 1973. The campus mood wasn't
exactly riotous — the big anti-war demonstrations
had come a year earlier — but it wasn't exactly
pro-fraternity either. The number of on-campus
fraternities had dropped to 14 from the all-time
high of 26 in 1960, and it threatened to drop even
further. Alpha Sig, Theta Chi and other frater
nities, worried that they couldn't fill their houses
through rush that year, dropped out of rush, went
co-ed and joined the housing draw.
Ever since, Alpha Sig has remained co-ed and
has battled its national organization, which stead
fastly refused to recognize female members and
disapproved of the non-selectivity of male mem
bers. The national suspended the local charter in
January 1981, and last week members voted to
abandon the national (Alpha Sigma Phi) and to
start a new, co-ed fraternity (Alpha Sigma).
Currently, none of the 12 fraternities with
houses here is anywhere near to approaching the
dire straits Alpha Sig and the others were in in
1973. Fraternities have gained in popularity since
the early '70s — more men, in fact, turned out for
last spring's rush than for any in recent memory.
The reason for this turnabout is in large part a
campus attitude much changed from that of the
Vietnam generation. But perhaps even more im
portant has been a concern with finding desirable
on-campus housing. "I don't want to get stuck in
Stern again" has been an oft-heard explanation for
rushing a fraternity.
But it looks now as if the new Governor's Corner
housing complex may change all that. By next fall,
when Sterling Quad will join the housing pool
along with the suites and the independent houses,
the housing pool will have increased by some 800
spaces. Some of those spaces have and will be
taken by graduate students moving into Manzanita
Park, but even so, there will be a net gain of at least
350 undergraduate spots in this spring's housing
draw over last year's. And although no one has

announced it officially yet, it seems quite likely
that there will soon no longer be such a thing as an
unguaranteed year — administrators have not yet
breathed a word of warning to this year's
freshmen.
All of this means that it will be far more easy to
land a spot in a residence even nicer than most of
the fraternity houses through the draw system —
and to be able to stay on campus for four years.
We can but only praise this change: it will allow
students to live in nicer residences and to stay on
campus longer. But at the same time, we wonder if
what we are hearing is the first muffled chime of
the death knell for fraternity houses here.
We think we have heard other faint chimes as
well. Rated housing capacities are being raised
effective next fall for some fraternities, which will
squeeze tight living conditions even further, mak
ing fraternity housing less attractive to a freshman
who draws, say, into the suites — and an accom
panying single. And more important, Dean of Stu
dent Affairs Jim Lyons last week formally an
nounced a freeze on on-campus housing for frater
nities. Said Lyons: "It's time for us to look again at
the proportion of the residential system that we
want to allocate to fraternal organizations."
Together, these indications seem to spell out a
future in which individual fraternity houses will die
one by one and the system as a whole will dissolve
by attrition. The beauty and modernity of Gover
nor's Corner and other University residences
combined with the prospect of not having to spend
one year off campus might very well convince a
potential fraternity member to opt out of fraternity
living.
If that happens on a large scale, some — perhaps
all — houses would try to first attract boarders to
fill vacant rooms, but eventually would have to
drop the selective system altogether and go co-ed,
likely abandoning the Greek system in all but
name. What Lyons' memo means is that those
houses would rejoin the housing draw; other
fraternities and sororities which do not at present
have housing would not be eligible to petition for
the vacant residences.
As of now, it's only conjecture. But what we may
be seeing is the beginning of the end of the frater
nity housing system here, a step towrd an eventual
end of treating fraternities and sororities in the
same way: as purely social organizations with no
housing privileges whatsoever.
