## MNCs encourage LDC development 
### 
The multinational corporation
(MNC) is the key institution in the
world economy facilitating the transfer
of prosperity from industrialized coun
tries to less-developed ones (LDCs). It
transfers technology to the LDCs that
then can be used to produce exports; it
transfers capital to the LDCs that pro
vides employment for LDC labor, and
the multinational corporation also is a
vehicle through which a considerable
amount of North-South trade takes
place.
Multinationals integrate the world

In the modern world, it is government - not the
multinational corporations - that is out of
control. To the extent that the multinationals
help control governments by inducing
competition between them, they render the
public a valuable service.

economy. Otherwise fragmented labor
markets, commodity markets and capi
tal markets in the South are unified
with their northern counterparts by the
multinationals to provide true world
markets for products and factors of
production. This is without doubt the
most important consequence of the
multinational corporation.
This crucial virtue, however, often
has been misrepresented by the critics
of multinationals. Critics do not dis
pute that multinationals transfer
technology and capital to the LDCs,
but they claim that the technology
transferred is inappropriate to the
LDCs, and that foreign direct invest
ment by the multinationals goes into
the wrong industries. They also
criticize the multinationals for under
mining the tax base of Third World
countries.
On the theory that the best way to
determine what is right about the mul
tinational corporations is to find out
what the American liberals and Euro
pean social democrats are saying is
wrong with them, the following quotes
from the report of the Brandt Commis
sion (chaired by Willy Brandt, ex
chancellor of West Germany) are in
structive.
"Much of the international trade
which multinational corporations con
duct goes on within their own organiza
tions ... In all such transactions, trans
fer prices may be settled which are dif
ferent from the price which would have
been the case between independent
parties operating at arm's length. Such
differences may reflect the legitimate
business concerns of the companies but
are also capable of being used in order
to shift profits from high to low tax
countries or to get around exchange or
price controls or customs duties. The
ability of multinationals to manipulate
financial flows by use of artificial
tranfer prices is bound to be a matter of
concern to government."
One baffling implication of this
quote is why shifting profits from high

to low-tax countries and getting around
exchange and price controls, as well as
custom duties, somehow are not consi
dered to be "legitimate business con
cerns" of private companies. The
Brandt Commission needs to be re
minded that the first obligation of the
directors and managers of a private
corporation is to their stockholders,
and this obligation would not be legiti
mately discharged if they did not take
full advantage of any and all legal
means to minimize taxes and avoid
profit-reducing interferences with

proper commerce.
TTie Brandt Report quote raises the
essential question of whether or not the
"legitimate business concerns" of the
multinationals are in harmony with the
legitimate concerns of society: in other
words, whether shifting taxes from high
to low countries, and getting around
controls of various kinds, are in the
social as well as private interest.
Hie first point to be made is that the
interests of government and those of
society do not come to the same thing.
High taxes and controls on private in
itiative may be in the interests of some
governments. But are high taxes in the
interests of society when they stagnate
growth, create scarcities and induce
corruption? Are exchange controls
that permit inflation-prone govern
ments to continue to inflate beneficial
for the economy? And is it wrong to
avoid customs duties which serve to
promote inefficiency in domestic re
source allocation and rob the consumer
by increasing prices? The answer to
these three questions must be negative
unless, like the Brandt Report, one
identifies the society's interest with
that of the government.
The public should applaud the flexi
bility of multinationals that allows
them to avoid the burdens government
attempts to impose. For example, the
ability of multinationals to shift profits
from high-tax to low-tax countries puts
needed and socially beneficial pressure
on governments to be reasonable in
their tax policies. The Brandt Commis
sion not only is aware of the capacity of
multinationals to put governments into
competition with one,another to lower
taxes, but seeks to suppress it by prop
osing "the harmonization of fiscal and
other incentives to avoid the undermin
ing of the tax base and competitive pos
itions of host countries."
What the Brandt Commission's
"harmonization" means, of course, is
cartel; governments collude with one
another to prevent anyone from under
cutting a competitor in seeking the bus

iness of the multinationals. Harmoni
zation is precisely analogous to the at
tempt by vendors to suppress competi
tion amongst themselves by fixing
industry-wide "fair" prices. It is typical
of the Brandt Report's double-think
that the suppression of com petition be
tween governments should be cham
pioned on the grounds that it prevents
"the undermining of the competitive
positions of host countries."
The Brandt Report claims that "un
derlying many of the fears about multi
national corporations is the concern
that they have been able to race ahead
in global operations and out of reach of
effective controls by nation-states or
international organizations."
But the Brandt Report has it back
wards. In the modern world, it is gov
ernment — not the multinational cor
porations — that is out of control. To
the extent that the multinationals help
control governments by inducing com
petition between them, they render the
public a valuable service.
