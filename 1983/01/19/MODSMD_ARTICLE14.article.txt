## Battling the ethos of 'casual' 
### 
I'm going to write something depres
sing today. I could find a moderate way
to say what I am going to say, some way
that doesn't knock anyone out of touch
with how he wants to feel. But that
would be a facade, the facade we all
work ourselves into, and I want to
shake it.
We think the answer to difficult
thingsistoattenuate them, toadhereto

We approximate happiness by stabilizing and
neutralizing our unhappiness piecemeal. And
that is the foundation upon which we proceed to
organize our sensibilities of what we enjoy, of
how we want to be with others, of what is cool
and what is not.

the tenants of moderation and be
casual. We wage a war of attrition
against the feelings that would pull us
down and keep us from experiencing
the model of pleasant or at least ap
propriate emotion. Most of us win that
war. We approximate happiness by
stabilizing and neutralizing our unhap
piness piecemeal. And that is the foun
dation upon which we proceed to or
ganize our sensibilities of what we en
joy, of how we want to be with others,
of what is cool and what is not.
Such a feat of maturity must be what
we mean by adulthood, one would
think. But in fact it is only a refuge, a
night's shelter on our journey — we
should not mistake it for our destina
tion. When we cling to that refuge we
set our pain in concrete, because we are
clinging to an encumbering apparatus

Sexuality especially can get lost when there is
isolation, because the essence of both
masculinity and femininity is a feeling for the
other. That is my theory anyway. A male
discovers his masculinity in what a girl can do
to him. It is in the presence offemininity that he
feels how he wants to move a woman and love
her.

for attenuating our responses to all the
things that screw us up, rather than
going on to see how else we could think
and feel.

"Casual" becomes an ethos. We "let
loose" and experience our sociability,
so long as some naive idea of spon
taneity is not violated, so long as we
aren't asked to engage more than the
moment, so long as we aren't made
aware, at which point all is spoiled and
we deftly turn away, but with a shudder
at our back, as if reality were something
that could pop.

Whatever else is right about it, it's
"casual" is prissy. A little character is
enough to make one want to shout.

"CasuaP' becomes an ethos. We"let loosef* and
experience our sociability, so long as some naive
idea of spontaneity is not violated, so long as we
are not asked to engage more than the moment,
so long as we are not made aware, at which point
all is spoiled and we deftly turn away, but with a
shudder at our back, as if reality were something
that could pop.

The worst consequences are for rela
tions between men and women. Being
moved by a member of the opposite sex

transcends more directly than anything
else the constraints on our behavior
and feelings. It evaporates any naive
notion of spontaneity. What matters is

not that our feelings have sneaked up
on us, but that they are alive. Not only
are we aware, we know at every mo
ment a world of things we want to do.
But, oops, you failed to be casual.
You are supposed to tease those feel
ings out, not just have them. It's time to
be "friends," and maybe take some
cold showers, until you can get it right.
It is not just a benign tedium either.
There is a real isolation of feelings.
Without communication, one'sfeelings
get channeled into how one is coming
across and what effect one is having on
the other person's emotions. Rather
than remain ourselves, it is hard not to
become a creature of the situation, and
get trivialized by it.
Sexuality especially can get lost
when there is isolation, because the es
sence of both masculinity and feminin
ity is a feeling for the other. That is my
theory anyway. A male discovers his
masculinity in what a girl can do to him.
It is in the presence of femininity that

he feels how he wants to move a woman
and love her. And a woman feels her
femininity in the way she wants to be
loved by a man, emotionally and physi
cally. (Am I right?)
This extends beyond any narrow
sense of sexuality. In all things, our
deepest sense of ourselves includes our
lover. By isolating and trivializing each
other we lose that deeper sense of our
selves and our world. And it is sense
less. We need not be that way. Whether
a story will have a happy ending or not
we should have confidence that as men
and women we can easily find our way
through. Because it is true.
When I see all that people put each
other through my image is of a non
swimmer thrashing to stay afloat; if
only he would try out his legs he would
find that the water is only chest-deep.

for attenuating our responses to all the
things that screw us up, rather than
going on to see how else we could think
and feel.

"Casual" becomes an ethos. We "let
loose" and experience our sociability,
so long as some naive idea of spon
taneity is not violated, so long as we
aren't asked to engage more than the
moment, so long as we aren't made
aware, at which point all is spoiled and
we deftly turn away, but with a shudder
at our back, as if reality were something
that could pop.

Whatever else is right about it, it's
"casual" is prissy. A little character is
enough to make one want to shout.

experience our sociability, so long as some naive
idea of spontaneity is not violated, so long as we
are not asked to engage more than the moment,
so long as we are not made aware, at which point

The worst consequences are for rela
tions between men and women. Being
moved by a member of the opposite sex

transcends more directly than anything
else the constraints on our behavior
and feelings. It evaporates any naive
notion of spontaneity. What matters is

not that our feelings have sneaked up
on us, but that they are alive. Not only
are we aware, we know at every mo
ment a world of things we want to do.
But, oops, you failed to be casual.
You are supposed to tease those feel
ings out, not just have them. It's time to
be "friends," and maybe take some
cold showers, until you can get it right.
It is not just a benign tedium either.
There is a real isolation of feelings.
Without communication, one'sfeelings
get channeled into how one is coming
across and what effect one is having on
the other person's emotions. Rather
than remain ourselves, it is hard not to
become a creature of the situation, and
get trivialized by it.
Sexuality especially can get lost
when there is isolation, because the es
sence of both masculinity and feminin
ity is a feeling for the other. That is my
theory anyway. A male discovers his
masculinity in what a girl can do to him.
It is in the presence of femininity that

he feels how he wants to move a woman
and love her. And a woman feels her
femininity in the way she wants to be
loved by a man, emotionally and physi
cally. (Am I right?)
This extends beyond any narrow
sense of sexuality. In all things, our
deepest sense of ourselves includes our
lover. By isolating and trivializing each
other we lose that deeper sense of our
selves and our world. And it is sense
less. We need not be that way. Whether
a story will have a happy ending or not
we should have confidence that as men
and women we can easily find our way
through. Because it is true.
When I see all that people put each
other through my image is of a non
swimmer thrashing to stay afloat; if
only he would try out his legs he would
find that the water is only chest-deep.

I'm going to write something depres

to say what I am going to say, some way
that doesn't knock anyone out of touch
with how he wants to feel. But that
would be a facade, the facade we all
work ourselves into, and I want to
shake it.

casual. We wage a war of attrition
against the feelings that would pull us
down and keep us from experiencing
the model of pleasant or at least ap

war. We approximate happiness by

Such a feat of maturity must be what
we mean by adulthood, one would
think. But in fact it is only a refuge, a
night's shelter on our journey — we
should not mistake it for our destina
