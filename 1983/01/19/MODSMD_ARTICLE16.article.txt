Mac Arthur Fellows chosen
Bradley Efron, professor of statistics, and
William Durham, assistant professor of an
thropology, became the University's third
and fourth recipients of the prestigious
Mac Arthur Fellowship.
The Unversity's first two recipients of this
award were Persi Diaconis, professor of
statistics, and Charles Bigelow, art and com
puter science. They received their awards in
1979.
The Mac Arthur Fellowships, which are
sponsored by the John D. and Catherine T.
Mac Arthur Foundation of Chicago, are
awarded to outstanding individuals person
ally, rather than for a particular projects.
The recipients of the awards receive tax
free cash grants over a period of five years,

and their departments are also awarded
grants. Because the amount of personal
grants varies with the age of the recipient,
Durham, 33, will receive $176,000 while
Efron, 44, will receive $220,000.
Neither Efron nor Durham had any idea
that they would be chosen for this award.
Upon his notification by the Mac Arthur
Foundation, Efron immmediately "called
back to find out if it was a joke," explaining
that several of his friends had also won
awards.

Durham was equally surprised by the
news. His first reaction, he said, was a feeling
of "great elation," but this was soon tem
pered by a feeling of "considerable humil
ity." Although he said he felt honored, he
also said that he felt a "great responsibility
to contribute."
Efron expressed similar sentiments, point
ing out that the Mac Arthur Foundation
asked him to "promise further contribu
tions" in his fields of study.
Neither recipient has made any definite
plans for the use of his grant or for the next
five years. Efron joked that his 10-year old
son asked that he take the grant in quarters
for video games. In reality, however, Efron
said that he would probably remain at the
University and continue his research in
statistics.
Durham said that he would like to use his
grant for research, travel and field work. He
mentioned the desire to revisit the San Bias

Islands off the coast of Panama, where he
has done studies of the K.una people who in
habit the islands. Noting the contrasting na
tures of their respective plans and fields of
study, Efron said, "He gets to travel more
and I get to travel less."
Efron, who is chairman of the
mathematical sciences department, earn'' .
his undergraduate degree at California In
stitute of Technology He earned his M.S.
and Ph.D. here after ..being kicked out
of the University because the Chaparral of
which he was the editor, published an excep
tionally irreverant isue.
Durham received his Ph.D. from the Uni
versity of Michigan. He is best known for his
research in what he calls the process of
"coevolution," a term he uses to describe
what he believes is a strong relationship be
tween human genetics and human culture.
Doodles Weaver dies
Doodles Weaver, a University graduate
who helped develop improvisational com
edy on television, died on Saturday, Jan. 15.
The 71-year-old comic died of self-inflicted
gunshot wounds according to police.
Weaver had his own television show with

NBC-TV in 1951. An addition, he also
hosted children's shows on both the East
and West coasts. "Topper," "The Birds,"
"The Story of Dr. Wassell," "Winchester
'73" and "Li'l Abner" were among the more
than 150 films that Weaver worked on.
While at the University during the 19305,
Weaver allegedly performed enough amaz
ing feats to form the Doodles Weaver Leg
end. Although he denied most of them as ex
aggerations, the stunts represent some of
Weaver's earlier successes as a comedian.
One of the Doodles Weaver Legend's said
that he paid his tuition in pennies. Another
said that he wore rollerskates to graduation
and skated over to receive his degree. Yet an
other legend related how he disassembled a
Model A Ford and reassembled it at the top
of Hoover Tower all in one night.
Trustees approve expansion
The Board of Trustees approved a $9.3
million expansion of the University's coin
vestment mortgage program (COIN) for
faculty and senior staff.
The new increase brings the COIN fund to
its ceiling of $21 million. The program has
been in existence since 1980 in order to help

faculty and staff purchase homes.
A successor program is now under in
vestigation with Robin Hamill, the director
of housing programs, leading the task force.
The COIN program close on June 30,
1983, the end of the current recruiting sea
son. Commitments made prior to that date
will he honored.
In order to increase the number of reci
pients, the average amount of money lent to
each person will be decreased.
However, the reduction will only affect
those who purchase homes for more than
$200,000. Now, the maximum amount
loaned bv COIN for a $400,000 house will be
$80,(XX) as opposed to the $100,000 that
would formerly have been loaned.
The actual buying power of the loaned
money is roughly equivalent to what it was
last year because faculty salaries have in
creased at a faster rate than local housing
prices and interest rates have declined.
In order to improve the loan-to-value ra
tio of COIN loans, persons buying homes
priced at $350,000 or above will be required
to make a 15 persent down payment. The
program used to require a 10 percent down
payment on all homes purchased, regardless
of the price.

awards.

Durham was equally surprised by the
news. His first reaction, he said, was a feeling
of "great elation," but this was soon tem
pered by a feeling of "considerable humil

also said that he felt a "great responsibility
to contribute."
Efron expressed similar sentiments, point
ing out that the Mac Arthur Foundation
asked him to "promise further contribu
tions" in his fields of study.
Neither recipient has made any definite
plans for the use of his grant or for the next
five years. Efron joked that his 10-year old
son asked that he take the grant in quarters
for video games. In reality, however, Efron
said that he would probably remain at the
University and continue his research in
statistics.
Durham said that he would like to use his
grant for research, travel and field work. He
mentioned the desire to revisit the San Bias

Islands off the coast of Panama, where he
has done studies of the K.una people who in
habit the islands. Noting the contrasting na
tures of their respective plans and fields of
study, Efron said, "He gets to travel more
and I get to travel less."
Efron, who is chairman of the
mathematical sciences department, earn'' .
his undergraduate degree at California In
stitute of Technology He earned his M.S.
and Ph.D. here after ..being kicked out
of the University because the Chaparral of
which he was the editor, published an excep
tionally irreverant isue.
Durham received his Ph.D. from the Uni
versity of Michigan. He is best known for his
research in what he calls the process of
"coevolution," a term he uses to describe
what he believes is a strong relationship be
tween human genetics and human culture.
Doodles Weaver dies
Doodles Weaver, a University graduate
who helped develop improvisational com
edy on television, died on Saturday, Jan. 15.
The 71-year-old comic died of self-inflicted
gunshot wounds according to police.
Weaver had his own television show with

NBC-TV in 1951. An addition, he also
hosted children's shows on both the East
and West coasts. "Topper," "The Birds,"
"The Story of Dr. Wassell," "Winchester
'73" and "Li'l Abner" were among the more
than 150 films that Weaver worked on.
While at the University during the 19305,
Weaver allegedly performed enough amaz
ing feats to form the Doodles Weaver Leg
end. Although he denied most of them as ex
aggerations, the stunts represent some of
Weaver's earlier successes as a comedian.
One of the Doodles Weaver Legend's said
that he paid his tuition in pennies. Another
said that he wore rollerskates to graduation
and skated over to receive his degree. Yet an
other legend related how he disassembled a
Model A Ford and reassembled it at the top
of Hoover Tower all in one night.
Trustees approve expansion
The Board of Trustees approved a $9.3
million expansion of the University's coin
vestment mortgage program (COIN) for
faculty and senior staff.
The new increase brings the COIN fund to
its ceiling of $21 million. The program has
been in existence since 1980 in order to help

faculty and staff purchase homes.
A successor program is now under in
vestigation with Robin Hamill, the director
of housing programs, leading the task force.
The COIN program close on June 30,
1983, the end of the current recruiting sea
son. Commitments made prior to that date
will he honored.
In order to increase the number of reci
pients, the average amount of money lent to
each person will be decreased.
However, the reduction will only affect
those who purchase homes for more than
$200,000. Now, the maximum amount
loaned bv COIN for a $400,000 house will be
$80,(XX) as opposed to the $100,000 that
would formerly have been loaned.
The actual buying power of the loaned
money is roughly equivalent to what it was
last year because faculty salaries have in
creased at a faster rate than local housing
prices and interest rates have declined.
In order to improve the loan-to-value ra
tio of COIN loans, persons buying homes
priced at $350,000 or above will be required
to make a 15 persent down payment. The
program used to require a 10 percent down
payment on all homes purchased, regardless
of the price.
