## Stanford divers springing higher 
### SHAILENDRA BHUMRALKAR 
When Dr. Rick Schavone
came to Stanford from Princeton
in 1979 to coach the diving
teams, he found only three di
vers, including one he had
brought with him. The team was
virtually nonexistent. In three
short years, however, he has
transformed both the men's and
women's diving squads into solid
competitors for the top spot in
the nation.
"We have a little program, but
it is tremendously successful,"
said Schavone. "We have a
built-in problem, too. We have
to dive outdoors, and it's cold."

This is why many top recruits
have refused to come out West.
But Schavone praised his divers
for "the amount of work the kids
have put in."
Schavone has favorable expec
tations regarding the women's
team. "They are expected to
produce," he said. Schavone ex
pects three of the four to go to
the NCAA Championships and
two of them to score there.
The women are led by Jean
Meyer, who scored in last year's
national championships. Vete
ran Tracey Stewart returns for
what could be her best year ever.
Walk-on Tori Pulskamp and

freshman Kim Jones round out
the roster. All four have already
met the point standards neces
sary to qualify for the NCAA
Championships.
In contrast with the estab
lished women's program, this is
the first year that the men have a
solid team. "The men are young,
so I'm not pushing them,"
Schavone explained. He feels
that if they keep training hard,
they will do well.
The men are led by prize re
cruit Tom Rothenbucher, who
dived with the U.S. International
team last summer. Thor
Johnson, another top freshman,

shows much potential for the
coming year. Mike Leahey, a
holdover from last year, figures
to improve greatly. Veterans
Chris Graviss and Spencer Ro
gers and freshman Bernard Zaia
complete the line-up. Four
members — Rothenbucher,
Johnson, Graviss and Rogers —
have qualified for the NCAA
Championships already.
The diving teams have tough
competition this weekend. They
will join the swimming teams and
travel to Arizona to face Arizona
on Friday and Arizona State on
Saturday.

TAKING CHARGE: Stanford freshman Andy Fischer scored a career-high 12 points in the
Card's 75-61 loss to Cal Monday night. Stanford must bounce right back and face the USC
Trojans tomorrow night at Maples.
