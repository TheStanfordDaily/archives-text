### LISA LYNCH Staff writer 
As a result of a preliminary hearing
yesterday, Stanford junior Neil
MacAvoy will be formally charged with
importation of and possession with in
tent to sell hashish and possession with
intent to sell cocaine. MacAvoy, who
was arrested Oct. 6 following a "con
trolled delivery" of a package of hash
ish, was scheduled for a Jan. 31 ar
raignment.
During the hearing, District Attor
ney Valarie Stewart presented six wit
nesses. The witnesses, which included a
U.S. Customs officer, Postal Inspector
William Hallonen, Santa Clara County
Criminalistics Lab analyst Mark
Moriyama, Stanford Police evidence
technician Sandra Mize, Narcotics Of
ficer David Weidler, and Stanford de
tective Iran White, related the events
leading up to and following the Oct. 6
raid.
On Sept. 27, according to the cus
toms officer, a package mailed from
China and addressed to MacAvoy at
his residence in the Alpha Delta Phi
fraternity, attracted the attention of a
dog trained to detect narcotics. The
package was opened and found to con
tain two packages of jasmine tea. In
side one of the packages was another, a
sealed package containing hashish.
The customs officer field-tested the
contents of the package and, suspecting
that it contained hashish, sent it to the
Oakland Post Office where it was

examined by postal inspector Halonen.
Halonen then contacted the Stanford
Police Department and organized a
controlled delivery of the substance. In
a controlled delivery, a warrant is ob
tained before the delivery is made, and
if the package is accepted, a search of
the premises follows. When the pac
kage is found, the addressee/owner is
charged with possession.
MacAvoy signed for the package.
According to Halonen, "He held it
over his head; students who were in the
dining area cheered." Halonen then
notified the Stanford police that
MacAvoy had accepted the package.
Officer Weidler, Detective White
and several other officers approached
MacAvoy's room and asked him to
open the door sevral times before they
kicked it open. They found the package
in a record album MacAvoy was hold
ing in his hands as they entered the
room. The package was unwrapped
and some of the hashish ws loose bet
ween the covers of the album.
Other items confiscated and submit
ted as evidence by Stewart were several
large and small bags of marijuana, a
film cannister containing hashish, a
mirror with a line of cocaine on the
surface and a razor blade and a straw
attached, an eyeglass case containing a
bag holding about $1500 worth of
cocaine and two scales — one with
cocaine residue on the surface and one
in a Scandanavian Airlines bag that
also contained bags of marijuana.

John Conneely, MacAvoy's lawyer,
maintained that the additional drugs
and paraphernalia found in the room
should be dismissed as evidence, be
cause the search warrant only covered
the seizure of the package of hashish
MacAvoy received. However, Stewart
produced two warrants — one for the
package of hashish and one permitting
a general search of the premises. Con
neely then complained that he had not
been given a copy of the warrant.
" I didn't know of the existence of the
second warrant," he said. He com
plained that in the reports filed by both
Weidler and White, a "warrant" rather
than "warrants" were refered to, and
when he had requested copies of search
warrants, only the one concerning the
package of hashish had been sent to
him.
Conneely also claimed that the sec
ond warrant was invalid, because there
was no reason for the detectives in
volved in the case to assume that there
was other contraband on the premises.
As for the charge that MacAvoy had
imported a controlled substance, Con
neely said that there was no proof that
MacAvoy knew of the contents of the
package before he opened it. Conneely
countered Halonen's insinuation that
MacAvoy knew the nature of the pac
kage by saying that MacAvoy could
have gotten this information from the
postal receipt.
"We're trying to prove this whole
thing is a set-up," he said.
