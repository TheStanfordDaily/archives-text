# Card readies for USC after Cal loss
## 
### STEVE ODELL 
With all the hubbub surround
ing the impending invasion by
No. 1 UCLA this weekend, Stan
ford might have a tendency to
overlook the Bruins' predeces
sor to Maples Pavilion, the USC
Trojans, who the Cardinal face
tomorrow night at 8 p.m. in a
Pacific-10 conference basketball
game.
Such an oversight could be
costly. Southern Cal, third place
in the Pac-10 standings with a
3-1 conference record and a 9-5
mark overall, will present similar
problems for the Card as Cal did
in its 75-61 victory over Stan
ford. The Trojans are quick in
the perimeter and strong in the
pivot.
Stanford is tied for sixth ir. the
conference with a 1-2 mark and
is 9-4 overall after its loss to Cal
Monday night. The Bears limited
the conference's leading scorer
and field goal shooter, Cardinal
center John Revejli, to just three
shot attempts and seven points
with a hustling, tightly-packed
zone defense, which was the key
to their lopsided victory.
It is important for Stanford to
not fall behind early as it did
against Cal by 12-3, forcing it
into a catch-up role against a fas
ter foe. Stanford will also need to
hit the defensive boards harder
to prevent second shots from the
physical Trojan front line.
Southern Cal is led by 6-foot-8

forward Wayne Carlander, who
was named to the 1981-82
Pac-10 All-Rookie Team. Car
lander is scoring 13.7 points and
grabbing 8.6 rebounds per game.
Carlander is an effective inside
player who also possesses a soft
touch from medium range.
The other starting forward is
senior co-captain James
McDonald, who USC coach Stan
Morrison called "one of the best
defensive players in the coun
try."
Splitting time at center will be
sophomore Ken Johnson, the
1981-82 Pac-10 leader in
blocked shots with an average of
1.5 rejections a game. Johnson is
powerful inside, being named to
the Pac-10 All-Rookie Team
and leading the Trojans in re
bounds a year ago.
Clayton Olivier should also
play plenty of minutes in the
middle. Olivier, a 6-10 sopho
more, has been hampered by in
juries throughout his college
career, but brings considerable

muscle to the USC line-up now
that he is healthy.
In the backcourt, USC is quick
and is led by three time co
captain Jacque Hill, who has had
to become more of a complete
player since the graduation of
Dwight Anderson. Hill's scoring
average is up over six points a
game compared to a year ago to
13.5. The other guard is Cedric
Bailey, a 6-6 junior with long
range on his jump shot.
Freshman forward Gerry
Wright, 1981-82 CIF 3-A Player

of the Year, has much potential
and should become a Pac-10
standout soon. Wright blocked
eight shots against Santa Gara
earlier this season.
Last year's 19-9 Trojan team
defeated Stanford both times the
teams met, 74-59 at the Los
Angeles Sports Arena and 85-74
at Maples Pavilion. USC has
beaten the Cardinal the last four
meetings, Stanford's last victory
a 93-91 overtime victory in the
final game of the 1979-80 sea
son.
