### Associated Press 
Los A ngeles â€” Two gold m ed
als won by Jim Thorpe in the
1912 Olympic Games were re
stored to his family yesterday, 70
years after he was stripped of his
amateur status because he ac
cepted $2 a game to play
baseball.
Juan Antonio Samaranch of
Spain, president of the Interna
tional Olympic Committee, offi
cially returned the gold medals
for the pentathlon and decathlon
events to the family of the
American Indian, who died in
% 1953 at age 64.
"The 70-year-old marathon is
over," said Thorpe's daughter,
Charlotte, 63, one of six Thorpe
children who attended the cere
mony.
Another daughter, Grace, said
she thought her father would
have onlysaid,"lt'sabouttime."
Thorpe won the grueling
Olympic events at the age of 24
in Stockholm, Sweden, but lost
them seven months later when
he admitted he was paid to play
baseball in 1909 and 1910.
The gold medals awarded yes
terday were not actually those
won by Thorpe, because "it
would be unfair to ask survivors
of the second place finishers to
return their (gold) medals,"
Samaranch had said.
Samaranch said that since
Thorpe's disqualification in
1913, "it is impossible to enum
erate all those who protested
against this decision and made
every effort to reverse it.
"In the end, when the LAAF
(International Amateur Athle
tics Federation) and United
States Olympic Committee had
finally accepted to reinstate him,
subsequent modification of the
so-called 'amateur rule' into a
much more positive 'eligibility
rule' of the lOC enabled us to
make this historic decision."
