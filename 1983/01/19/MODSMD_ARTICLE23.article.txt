# Ruggers rip Davis
## 
### 
The Stanford Women's Rugby
Team won its first league match
Sunday, trouncing UC-Davis
42-0.
Wet field conditions resulted
in a lot of kicking and loose-ball
play, two areas of the game Stan
ford has been steadily improving
on as the year has progressed.
Manley Williams scored first
for the Cardinal, taking advan
tage of an overlap on the outside.
Minutes later Stanford increased
its lead to 10-0 by running 75
yards on a 20-meter drop-out
play and converting the extra
points. Alice Abrams, Jennifer
Flattery, Jen Crawford and
Rusty Renner each scored once
and Paula McNerney and Joan
Sanders scored twice.
Stanford players attribute
their success to the excellent
coaching of John Tyler and Jim
Feuille as well as the solid play of
an athletic quick-learning group
of rookie players. "We're de
veloping as well as utilizing our
talents," second-year prop Paula
McNerney explained.
Stanford coaches were satis
fied with the team's performance
but emphasized, "We still have a
lot of potential which we'll need
to develop before playing the
more experienced teams in the
league."
Stanford will host the always
strong San Francisco Women's
Rugby Club Saturday at
Maloney Field at 11 a.m.
