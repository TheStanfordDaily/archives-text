# Men sweep Hastings in three games, BATS next
## 
### 
The Stanford Men's Rugby
Club posted a solid three-game
sweep over Hastings Law School
last Saturday, the Is winning
12-9, the 2s 24-6, and the 3s
28-8.
The victories were charac
terized by vigorous rucking and
loose play by the forwards, de
monstrating significant im
provement over last week.
The Is game began slowly as
both defenses proved tough in
the early going. Break Mark
Pearson scored the first try of the
game for Stanford late in the first
half, plunging over the line from
a ruck on the left side. Fullback
"Sparkplug" Dickson added the
conversion.
In the second half Hastings
came back to tie the game, and
then the two sides traded penalty
kicks to even the score at nine
late in the second half. Dickson
provided the winning margin
with another kick to give the
game to the Cardinal.
The 2s game was marked by
impressive forward play, al
though the Hastings pack had
the advantage in the set scrums.
Standoff A 1 Sinsheimer scored
two tries off loose play in the first
half to get the ball rolling for
Stanford, and from then on Hast
ings was never in the game.
In the second half inside
center Fred Gregory made a
beautiful 25-yard run to put
Stanford ahead 20-0. Then came
the coup de grace: second-row
Ken Cunz, broken nose and all,
bulled his way in on a straight
ahead drive to score with half the
Hastings side hanging on his
back.
In the 3s game the backs
dominated as Jeff School scored
twice and Jack McGannon and
Dirk Price scored once to keep
far ahead of Hastings.
Stanford hosts the BATS this
Saturday at Harry Maloney
Field. The BATS lost their las
match to the San Francisco
Rugby Club.
