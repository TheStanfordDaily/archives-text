## Spice up your life with Thai cuisine

Hey! Does your life need a little spicing
up? Are you tired of eating dinner with
out being able to distinguish between
beef, pork and veal? Are your taste buds
dying from a lack of flavorful stimuli?
If you answered yes to any of these
questions, then you might be suffering
from "blandiosis" which often afflicts
people who eat mundane meals. How
ever, there is no longer a need to be con
cerned because 1 have discovered a sure
fire method for eliminating your problem.
The miracle cure is called Khan Toke — a
restaurant serving outstanding Thai (from
Thailand) food. Thai food is one of my
favorite cuisines, so I have eagerly
awaited an opportunity to try this restaur
ant. Because many people believe that
Khan Toke is the best Thai restaurant in
the area, my expectations were quite high.
1 am happy to report that I was not disap
pointed.
When you open the door and cross the
threshold, you will enter into a completely
different world. You will be greeted by a
man in a white coat, knickers and long
socks who will request that you take your
shoes off to feel more comfortable. Your
host will then escort you to one of 12
tables where you can lounge on pillows
while you read the menu. The dining
room is quite cozy and the soft lighting
and individual candles create a very relax -
ing atmosphere. The walls are adorned
with many South Asian patterns and de
signs as well as many Buddhist orna
ments, including a "spirit house" which
rests outside under a flood light.
Unlike the quiet, docile atmosphere,
the food at Khan Toke is very robust and
bursting with flavor. All the dinners begin
with soup. On the night we were there, we
received a very spicy chicken broth soup
filled with many tasty vegetables. I have
not tried very many Thai soups, but this

one was quite good.
Following the soup, I would strongly
suggest having an appetizer or two, or
maybe all nine of them! 1 would particu
larly recommend the Look Chin Moo
Yang ($4.25) and the Meing Com
($3.95). The Meing Com is mysteriously
described on the menu as "seven favorite
ingredients served with lemon grass sauce
and butter lettuce." However, do not be
afraid — those seven ingredients add up
to a truly outstanding dish. The seven in
gredients and the lettuce arrived on a cir
cular wooden plate with the sauce in the
middle. Our waiter then instructed us
about how to fold the lettuce into a cup in
which you place one piece of each ingre
dient in the correct order: ginger, shrimp,
green pepper, onion, lemon, browned
coconut and peanuts. Then you place a
teaspoon of lemon grass sauce on top, fold
over the last flap of the lettuce and place
the entire concoction inside your mouth
— then the real fun begins. As you bite
into the lettuce, your taste buds can detect
each individual flavor. Then, they all
merge into one exquisite taste sensation.
The other appetizer was equally as in
teresting. This time, you take a thin
square of rice paper and fold it into a cup
which you fill with garlic, green pepper,
ginger, peanuts, pork and tarmarind
sauce. Once again, the whole cup is eaten
in one bite — a sensation which will reac
tivate even the most dormant taste buds.
You certainly could make a meal just
out of the appetizers, but that would dep
rive you of lOian Toke's wonderfully fla
vored dinners. With every entree, you
have the choice of seasonings varying
from mild to hot. Mild is for the unadven
turous, medium is for those who enjoy
breaking into a slight sweat and hot is for
those who want to say farewell to their
entire mouth, throat and stomach. We or
dered a medium version of Moo Plig
Khing ($4.25) — a marvelous pork dish
served with green beans and spicy ginger

sauce. It was superb, and it was a great
warm up (literally) for our other entree: a
medium version of their hottest beef
curry. Penang Neua ($4.50) is a must for
anyone who enjoys curry. The beef, sweet
basil, spicy red curry and coconut milk all
combine to produce a magnificant culi
nary experience. The beef is served in a
bowl which gives it the deceptive appear
ance of an ordinary beef stew. However,
this illusion is "blown out" of your mind
after just one bite — at first, you will just
feel warm, then you might remove a few
articles of clothing, next your nose will
start to run, then your throat will begin to
burn, and finally, you will break out into a
real sweat. This is the way eating was in
tended to be. (Just in case things get out of
hand, I would suggest that you keep a cool
bottle of Singha — Thai beer — and a
glass of cold water within easy reach.)
I have always felt that the only disap
pointing aspect of Thai cuisine is that it
does not include any good desserts. How
ever, this problem was eliminated at Khan
Toke. We had fried bananas with ice
cream — rather simple, but really tasty,
and the ice cream helped to sooth my
pulsating lips and mouth. The other de
ssert was called the Thai dessert ($1.50)
— a delicious variation of rice pudding.
Both of these desserts were washed down
with a wonderful cup of strong yet some
what sweet coffee.
As you can probably tell, Thai food is
usually not recommended to those people
who only like hamburgers, hot dogs and
fried chicken. However, Thai cuisine of
fers a unique dining experience which
should not be avoided. If you already
know that you like Thai food, then you
should certainly make plans to go to Khan
Toke in the near future; if you have never
tried Thai food, then be daring and treat
your taste buds to an experience they will
never forget.

and butter lettuce." However, do not be
afraid — those seven ingredients add up
to a truly outstanding dish. The seven in
gredients and the lettuce arrived on a cir
cular wooden plate with the sauce in the
middle. Our waiter then instructed us
about how to fold the lettuce into a cup in
which you place one piece of each ingre
dient in the correct order: ginger, shrimp,
green pepper, onion, lemon, browned
coconut and peanuts. Then you place a
teaspoon of lemon grass sauce on top, fold
over the last flap of the lettuce and place
the entire concoction inside your mouth
— then the real fun begins. As you bite
into the lettuce, your taste buds can detect
each individual flavor. Then, they all
merge into one exquisite taste sensation.
The other appetizer was equally as in
teresting. This time, you take a thin
square of rice paper and fold it into a cup
which you fill with garlic, green pepper,
ginger, peanuts, pork and tarmarind
sauce. Once again, the whole cup is eaten
in one bite — a sensation which will reac
tivate even the most dormant taste buds.
You certainly could make a meal just
out of the appetizers, but that would dep
rive you of lOian Toke's wonderfully fla
vored dinners. With every entree, you
have the choice of seasonings varying
from mild to hot. Mild is for the unadven
turous, medium is for those who enjoy
breaking into a slight sweat and hot is for
those who want to say farewell to their
entire mouth, throat and stomach. We or
dered a medium version of Moo Plig
Khing ($4.25) — a marvelous pork dish
served with green beans and spicy ginger

sauce. It was superb, and it was a great
warm up (literally) for our other entree: a
medium version of their hottest beef
curry. Penang Neua ($4.50) is a must for
anyone who enjoys curry. The beef, sweet
basil, spicy red curry and coconut milk all
combine to produce a magnificant culi
nary experience. The beef is served in a
bowl which gives it the deceptive appear
ance of an ordinary beef stew. However,
this illusion is "blown out" of your mind
after just one bite — at first, you will just
feel warm, then you might remove a few
articles of clothing, next your nose will
start to run, then your throat will begin to
burn, and finally, you will break out into a
real sweat. This is the way eating was in
tended to be. (Just in case things get out of
hand, I would suggest that you keep a cool
bottle of Singha — Thai beer — and a
glass of cold water within easy reach.)
I have always felt that the only disap
pointing aspect of Thai cuisine is that it
does not include any good desserts. How
ever, this problem was eliminated at Khan
Toke. We had fried bananas with ice
cream — rather simple, but really tasty,
and the ice cream helped to sooth my
pulsating lips and mouth. The other de
ssert was called the Thai dessert ($1.50)
— a delicious variation of rice pudding.
Both of these desserts were washed down
with a wonderful cup of strong yet some
what sweet coffee.
As you can probably tell, Thai food is
usually not recommended to those people
who only like hamburgers, hot dogs and
fried chicken. However, Thai cuisine of
fers a unique dining experience which
should not be avoided. If you already
know that you like Thai food, then you
should certainly make plans to go to Khan
Toke in the near future; if you have never
tried Thai food, then be daring and treat
your taste buds to an experience they will
never forget.

Hey! Does your life need a little spicing
up? Are you tired of eating dinner with
out being able to distinguish between
beef, pork and veal? Are your taste buds
dying from a lack of flavorful stimuli?
If you answered yes to any of these
questions, then you might be suffering
from "blandiosis" which often afflicts
people who eat mundane meals. How
ever, there is no longer a need to be con
cerned because 1 have discovered a sure
fire method for eliminating your problem.
The miracle cure is called Khan Toke — a
restaurant serving outstanding Thai (from
Thailand) food. Thai food is one of my
favorite cuisines, so I have eagerly
awaited an opportunity to try this restaur
ant. Because many people believe that
Khan Toke is the best Thai restaurant in
the area, my expectations were quite high.
1 am happy to report that I was not disap
pointed.
When you open the door and cross the
threshold, you will enter into a completely
different world. You will be greeted by a
man in a white coat, knickers and long
socks who will request that you take your
shoes off to feel more comfortable. Your
host will then escort you to one of 12
tables where you can lounge on pillows
while you read the menu. The dining
room is quite cozy and the soft lighting
and individual candles create a very relax -
ing atmosphere. The walls are adorned
with many South Asian patterns and de
signs as well as many Buddhist orna
ments, including a "spirit house" which
rests outside under a flood light.
Unlike the quiet, docile atmosphere,
the food at Khan Toke is very robust and
bursting with flavor. All the dinners begin
with soup. On the night we were there, we
received a very spicy chicken broth soup
filled with many tasty vegetables. I have
not tried very many Thai soups, but this

one was quite good.
Following the soup, I would strongly
suggest having an appetizer or two, or
maybe all nine of them! 1 would particu
larly recommend the Look Chin Moo
Yang ($4.25) and the Meing Com
($3.95). The Meing Com is mysteriously
described on the menu as "seven favorite
ingredients served with lemon grass sauce
and butter lettuce." However, do not be
afraid — those seven ingredients add up
to a truly outstanding dish. The seven in
gredients and the lettuce arrived on a cir
