Looking for a place to take
that special date? Want to dine in
an elegant, romantic, yet relaxed
setting? L'Escargot, an exquisite
French restaurant titled after its
excellent snails, offers this and
very much more. This restaur
ant, located near Highway 101 in
not-too-distant Burlingame, has
its roots in southeast France. It
has been serving authentic
French delicacies here for eight
years.
From our very first glance, the
restaurant conveyed an atmos
phere of a quaint streetside cafe.
The outside is simple, but nice,
with only a small lighted sign
over a single glass door marking
its entrance — quite unlike the
formal, stuffy countenance we
had expected. We were im
mediately seated in the restaur
ant's single room, a homey and
private dining area. Even though
the room was small, it seemed
very open; the wooden tables
were apart enough not to make
us feel crowded. The room had
dark wood paneling and white
stucco walls, combining to give a
rustic appearance. Authentic
paintings and momentos from
France accentuated the atmos
phere. Dimmed chandeliers and
soft candlelight provided the
lighting. All in all, a very com
fortable and pleasant feeling
prevailed.
Oh yes, and we forgot to men
tion the one thing that makes
L'Escargot authentically French
— the food! From start to finish,
our meal was consistently excel
lent. For starters, we had very
good freshly baked French bread
and sipped wine, which was cho

sen from an impressive list of
both imported and domestic
wines (prices ranging typically
from $10 to $30 per bottle).
Bearing in mind the respon
sibilities of our job, we ap
prehensively ordered the next
part of our meal. Since the re
staurant's name is L'Escargot,
we felt obligated to try one item
in particular: the snails! Much to
oursurprise, they were excellent.
Three varieties of escargot are
offered, each at $3.95. We de
voured the escargots Nicoise, a
"taste-bud-tantalizing" blend of
snails, mushrooms, tomatoes
and peppers in a wine sauce. We
highly recommend this flavorful
and delicious hor d'oeuvre to
both the escargot connoisseur
and the person cautious of trying
a perhaps unfamiliar dish.

With the main entree comes a
choice of soup du jour, salad or
coquille cancalaise (mixed sea
food in cream sauce). We had
onion soup and spinach salad.
The soup was a tasty combina
tion of cheese and onions in a
spicy but not overpowering
broth — a must for you onion
soup.fans. Similarly, the salad
was delicious, simply prepared
with diced egg and a tangy
French dressing, different from
most creamy French dressings.
Now, what you've been wait
ing for, the heart of the meal.
The entrees we ordered were
veau aux champignons (veal,
cream sauce, brandy, mus
hrooms — $11) and canard a
I'orange (duckling with orange
sauce — $11.25). The veal was
extremely tasty, tender and came
in a reasonably sized portion.
The cream sauce had a cheesy
texture and a mild flavor, which
balanced well with the pleasant
taste of the meat. Included were
somewhat slight servings of scal
loped potatoes, which were very
light and well-prepared, and
green beans, which were mild
and crisp without being over
cooked. The whole dinner was
something to savor. The two very
large pieces of canard a I'orange
were moist and tender, and were
well complemented by a tangy
orange flavor. The taste was

somewhat like a very tender
chicken, but more flavorful. _
Green beans and whipped ••
potatoes were also provided. We
highly recommend both entrees.
The quality of the food was very
excellent, providing a formal
meal in a less formal environ
ment.
Other entrees range in price
from $9.75 to $13.75 and in
clude: veau aux zucchini (veal in
lemon butter, sliced zucchini —
$11), coq-au-vin (chicken
cooked in red wine with mus
hrooms and herbs — this and
other kinds of chicken each for
$9.75), medaillon elder (tender- "
loin with tomatoes and bearnaise
— $11.75) and carre d'agneau :
Bayaldi (domestic rack of lamb
— $13.75). Overall, we found "
the prices to be reasonable for

the quality of food and service
we received.
Finally, our meal ended nicely
with a couple of those famous
French desserts. Being true
mousse lovers, we found the
mousse au chocolat ($2) a real
treat. A smooth and semi-sweet
chocolate taste prevailed in this
lightly whipped dessert, com
plete with large chips of choco
late. If you prefer custard, we
also found the creme caramel
($2) to be good. Even though not
particularly custard fans, we
found this dessert to be light and
enjoyable.
Other people seemed to share
our positive view of L'Escargot.
We noticed that many customers
knew the manager and waiters
by name and carried on friendly
conversations with them. This
seems an indication that a regu
lar clientele frequents the re-"
staurant. The service was prompt
and cordial, yet unimposing. The
waiters' manners and dress were
nice, but informal — our experi
ence was like dining with a very
courteous French family. L'Es
cargot serves dinners only, and is
openffom 6 to lQp.m, everyday
except Sunday. Reservations are ; 'J
required. Bon appetit. '

coquille cancalaise (mixed sea
food in cream sauce). We had
onion soup and spinach salad.
The soup was a tasty combina
tion of cheese and onions in a
spicy but not overpowering
broth — a must for you onion
soup.fans. Similarly, the salad
was delicious, simply prepared
with diced egg and a tangy
French dressing, different from
most creamy French dressings.
Now, what you've been wait
ing for, the heart of the meal.
The entrees we ordered were
veau aux champignons (veal,
cream sauce, brandy, mus
hrooms — $11) and canard a
I'orange (duckling with orange
sauce — $11.25). The veal was
extremely tasty, tender and came
in a reasonably sized portion.
The cream sauce had a cheesy
texture and a mild flavor, which
balanced well with the pleasant
taste of the meat. Included were
somewhat slight servings of scal
loped potatoes, which were very
light and well-prepared, and
green beans, which were mild
and crisp without being over
cooked. The whole dinner was
something to savor. The two very
large pieces of canard a I'orange
were moist and tender, and were
well complemented by a tangy
orange flavor. The taste was

somewhat like a very tender
chicken, but more flavorful. _
Green beans and whipped ••
potatoes were also provided. We
highly recommend both entrees.
The quality of the food was very
excellent, providing a formal
meal in a less formal environ
ment.
Other entrees range in price
from $9.75 to $13.75 and in
clude: veau aux zucchini (veal in
lemon butter, sliced zucchini —
$11), coq-au-vin (chicken
cooked in red wine with mus
hrooms and herbs — this and
other kinds of chicken each for
$9.75), medaillon elder (tender- "
loin with tomatoes and bearnaise
— $11.75) and carre d'agneau :
Bayaldi (domestic rack of lamb
— $13.75). Overall, we found "
the prices to be reasonable for

the quality of food and service
we received.
Finally, our meal ended nicely
with a couple of those famous
French desserts. Being true
mousse lovers, we found the
mousse au chocolat ($2) a real
treat. A smooth and semi-sweet
chocolate taste prevailed in this
lightly whipped dessert, com
plete with large chips of choco
late. If you prefer custard, we
also found the creme caramel
($2) to be good. Even though not
particularly custard fans, we
found this dessert to be light and
enjoyable.
Other people seemed to share
our positive view of L'Escargot.
We noticed that many customers
knew the manager and waiters
by name and carried on friendly
conversations with them. This
seems an indication that a regu
lar clientele frequents the re-"
staurant. The service was prompt
and cordial, yet unimposing. The
waiters' manners and dress were
nice, but informal — our experi
ence was like dining with a very
courteous French family. L'Es
cargot serves dinners only, and is
openffom 6 to lQp.m, everyday
except Sunday. Reservations are ; 'J
required. Bon appetit. '

L'ESCARGOT
1137 California Drive
Burllngame
344-4144
Looking for a place to take
that special date? Want to dine in
an elegant, romantic, yet relaxed
setting? L'Escargot, an exquisite
French restaurant titled after its
excellent snails, offers this and
very much more. This restaur
ant, located near Highway 101 in
not-too-distant Burlingame, has
its roots in southeast France. It
has been serving authentic
French delicacies here for eight
years.
From our very first glance, the
restaurant conveyed an atmos
phere of a quaint streetside cafe.
The outside is simple, but nice,
with only a small lighted sign
over a single glass door marking
its entrance — quite unlike the
formal, stuffy countenance we
had expected. We were im
mediately seated in the restaur
ant's single room, a homey and
private dining area. Even though
the room was small, it seemed
very open; the wooden tables
were apart enough not to make
us feel crowded. The room had
dark wood paneling and white
stucco walls, combining to give a
rustic appearance. Authentic
paintings and momentos from
France accentuated the atmos
phere. Dimmed chandeliers and
soft candlelight provided the
lighting. All in all, a very com
fortable and pleasant feeling
prevailed.
Oh yes, and we forgot to men
tion the one thing that makes
L'Escargot authentically French
— the food! From start to finish,
our meal was consistently excel
lent. For starters, we had very
good freshly baked French bread
and sipped wine, which was cho

sen from an impressive list of
both imported and domestic
wines (prices ranging typically
from $10 to $30 per bottle).
Bearing in mind the respon
sibilities of our job, we ap
prehensively ordered the next
part of our meal. Since the re
staurant's name is L'Escargot,
we felt obligated to try one item
in particular: the snails! Much to
oursurprise, they were excellent.
Three varieties of escargot are
offered, each at $3.95. We de
voured the escargots Nicoise, a
"taste-bud-tantalizing" blend of
snails, mushrooms, tomatoes
and peppers in a wine sauce. We
highly recommend this flavorful
and delicious hor d'oeuvre to
both the escargot connoisseur
and the person cautious of trying
a perhaps unfamiliar dish.
