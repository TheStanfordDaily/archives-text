So you're still undecided
whether you want to spend that
quarter at Cliveden before the
Stanford program moves to Ox
ford. You're still not quite sure
whether a few months in the En
glish countryside without the
possibility of satisfying a Big Mac
attack or a Winchell's donut run
would be bearable. Perhaps you
don't want to go, or maybe you
just need to spend a few hours in
a real "English atmosphere" be
fore deciding. Well, you needn't
trek all the way across the Atlan
tic just yet. Just take a 20-minute
ride up 101 to Burlingame, and
experience the "enchantment of
18th century England" at Gul
liver's.
You remember Gulliver. He's
the chap from the Jonathon Swift
book who set out to sea in search
of adventure and landed in
places only imaginable to one
partaking of various mind
altering substances. Among his
adventures were those with the
little folks at Lilliput, and the
Houyhnhnmy (the land of
horses). I mean really, Jon, I had
no idea that the age of Aquarian
psychodelia started in 1701.
Nonetheless, it makes for an in
teresting and charming atmos
phere.
We arrived at Gulliver's at
about 7:45 p.m. on a Sunday,
and was it crowded! Reserva
tions are suggested, as we arrived
and were kindly told that the
wait would be about 45 minutes.
Not to worry, though, for the pub
had plenty of room, enabling us
to get a head start on our drink
ing while further developing our
already substantial appeliies.
We were then seated in a very
large dining room containing
countless items of English
memorabilia. Though I have
never been to England, the at
mosphere seemed to be from out
of an old Robin Hood movie,
where Robin would visit the
stately old mansion of a rich aris
tocratic landowner, and later ap
propriate some of the latter's
possessions. The room, although
not really elegant, had a certain
charm, and perhaps could have
been cozy except for the size.
We were greeted by a very
courteous, but somewhat shy
waitress named Sheri. (I must
say, however, that the "wench"
costume worn by the waitresses
borders on bad taste or embar
rassment, and seems a little in
appropriate in a family-style re
staurant. Perhaps the manage

ment feels the uniforms are cute,
but sexist would probably be a
better adjective.)
In any event, we began our ex
cursion with a choice of either
the Glubbdubdrib Sallet (tossed
salad for you uneducated col
onists) or the pottage (soup) of
the day. My friend elected to go
with the salad of hearts of romaine
lettuce, garnished with chopped
egg, a cherry tomato, baby bay
shrimp and an oil and vinegar
dressing. It was the standard
house salad, quite good though
not spectacular.
1 really savored my pottage,
however. It was potato leek
soup, and extremely tasty. I al
most felt like a kid (heck, I still
do it) wanting to ask mom for
seconds, but seeing that I was at a
restaurant with a "date" (and I'd
ruin my appetite anyway), my
better judgment restrained me.
Gulliver's prides itself on its
prime rib (in fact, it promises you
"the best Prime Rib experience
ever"). Thus, my friend ordered
the regular Gulliver cut, a gener
ous slab of beef which goes for
$12.50. The other similarly
priced cuts are the Big Endian
cut (brown and crispy) and the
Prime Minister cut, which is
thinly sliced. And if you're re
cruiting a defensive tackle for the
Cardinal football team, better
get the Brobdingnagian, a full
bone cut for $16.95.
The prime rib was excellent (I,
of course, couldn't resist tasting)
— not too chewy nor too tough.
However, 1 was somewhat dis
appointed with my entree, the
Crispy Long Island Duck
($11.50). I wanted to try some
thing other than prime rib, and
being enthralled in conversation,
I neglected to notice that the
duck came "crispy." It was a bit
too crisp and dry for my taste,
but then again, I was forewarned
by the menu.
I think next time I'll order
prime rib, or if I don't care for
red meat that night, I'll try the
whole boneless breast of chic
ken, which comes sauteed on a
bed of mushrooms with red wine
and Bernaise on top. (Sounds
good — for only $9.75.) Gul
liver's also has cold water West
Australian lobster tail ($12.75),
Petrale sole ($10.50), and filet of
salmon ($11.75) for dinner.
I must also comment on the
side orders that accompany the
entrees. We both had creamed
corn (Gulliver's famous creamed
corn, of course). Whether it is
famous or not is one matter —
butifit isn't, it should be. It had a
great texture and was slightly

(but not overly) sweet. Equally
as good was their creamed
spinach souffle. It's the kind of
spinach you'd like even if you
hated it as a kid.
During dinner we had a fine
Napa Valley wine. Although
etiquette usually dictates a red
wine with beef, we decided that
since we preferred white wine,
we'd have that instead. (Take thai,
Miss Manners!) Now, 1 am not
by any means a wine connois
seur, but in the words of a retired
Supreme Court Justice, I may
not be able to explain it, "but I
know it when I see it." The wine
was neither too sweet nor over
powering, and was very refresh
ing. Gulliver's offers a different
selected California wine for
less than $6 every month. If you
want to impress your date, then
you may want to go with the
more expensive $15 wine, but
the one we had was just fine.
By this time we were pretty
full, but seeing that I was with a
dessert connoisseur (and ad

diet!), we couldn't resist going
for dessert. All the desserts at
Gulliver's are $2.25, and from
what we tasted, more than worth
it. My friend had the Chocolate
Temptation, and tempting it was.
It was an incredibly rich choco
late on chocolate cake. My
friend, being reasonably expert
on chocolate (I wouldn't be the
least bit surprised if she had a
degree in Chocolatry, or what
ever) obviously enjoyed it
thoroughly.
Yet even better was the Trifle
pudding (sherried of course).
This is a traditional English con
fection, made with Devonshire
cream, almond sponge cake,
raspberries, and topped with
whipped cream and strawberries
— and doused in sherry. It has a
pronounced sherry taste (so
much so that one with a low al
cohol tolerance might even feel a
wee bit tipsy — no such problem
here, though). Nonetheless, it
was delicious! Needless to say, as
full as we had been, we were now
bloated. Maybe next time we'll

skip something beforehand to
really savor the desserts (al
though we did a pretty fair job in
spite of ourselves). Gulliver's
also offers an apple crumb cake
and a vanilla rum mousse.
All in all, it was quite a satisfy
ing culinary experience. We en
joyed it all except for the
aforementioned "crispy" duck.
Our waitress was hospitable and
efficient. The atmosphere was
Old World and though it was
really crowded, it was not rowdy
or pub-like. The crowd was
mostly older, but there were a
good number of younger people,
and even a few kids. The dress is
informal (though I wouldn't go
in a tattered "Beat the Weenies"
T-shirt, either). Gulliver's has a
lunch menu as well, and serves
lunch from 11:30 a.m. to 3:30
p.m. on weekdays. I would re
commend making reservations
on a weekend night for dinner.

seur, but in the words of a retired
Supreme Court Justice, I may
not be able to explain it, "but I
know it when I see it." The wine
was neither too sweet nor over
powering, and was very refresh
ing. Gulliver's offers a different
selected California wine for
less than $6 every month. If you
want to impress your date, then
you may want to go with the
more expensive $15 wine, but
the one we had was just fine.
By this time we were pretty
full, but seeing that I was with a
dessert connoisseur (and ad

diet!), we couldn't resist going
for dessert. All the desserts at
Gulliver's are $2.25, and from
what we tasted, more than worth
it. My friend had the Chocolate
Temptation, and tempting it was.
It was an incredibly rich choco
late on chocolate cake. My
friend, being reasonably expert
on chocolate (I wouldn't be the
least bit surprised if she had a
degree in Chocolatry, or what
ever) obviously enjoyed it
thoroughly.
Yet even better was the Trifle
pudding (sherried of course).
This is a traditional English con
fection, made with Devonshire
cream, almond sponge cake,
raspberries, and topped with
whipped cream and strawberries
— and doused in sherry. It has a
pronounced sherry taste (so
much so that one with a low al
cohol tolerance might even feel a
wee bit tipsy — no such problem
here, though). Nonetheless, it
was delicious! Needless to say, as
full as we had been, we were now
bloated. Maybe next time we'll

skip something beforehand to
really savor the desserts (al
though we did a pretty fair job in
spite of ourselves). Gulliver's
also offers an apple crumb cake
and a vanilla rum mousse.
All in all, it was quite a satisfy
ing culinary experience. We en
joyed it all except for the
aforementioned "crispy" duck.
Our waitress was hospitable and
efficient. The atmosphere was
Old World and though it was
really crowded, it was not rowdy
or pub-like. The crowd was
mostly older, but there were a
good number of younger people,
and even a few kids. The dress is
informal (though I wouldn't go
in a tattered "Beat the Weenies"
T-shirt, either). Gulliver's has a

So you're still undecided
whether you want to spend that
quarter at Cliveden before the
Stanford program moves to Ox
ford. You're still not quite sure
whether a few months in the En
glish countryside without the
possibility of satisfying a Big Mac
attack or a Winchell's donut run
would be bearable. Perhaps you
don't want to go, or maybe you
just need to spend a few hours in
a real "English atmosphere" be
fore deciding. Well, you needn't
trek all the way across the Atlan
tic just yet. Just take a 20-minute
ride up 101 to Burlingame, and
experience the "enchantment of
18th century England" at Gul
liver's.
You remember Gulliver. He's
the chap from the Jonathon Swift
book who set out to sea in search
of adventure and landed in
places only imaginable to one
partaking of various mind
altering substances. Among his
adventures were those with the
little folks at Lilliput, and the
Houyhnhnmy (the land of
horses). I mean really, Jon, I had
no idea that the age of Aquarian
psychodelia started in 1701.
Nonetheless, it makes for an in
teresting and charming atmos
phere.
We arrived at Gulliver's at
about 7:45 p.m. on a Sunday,
and was it crowded! Reserva
tions are suggested, as we arrived
and were kindly told that the
wait would be about 45 minutes.
Not to worry, though, for the pub
had plenty of room, enabling us
to get a head start on our drink
ing while further developing our
already substantial appeliies.
We were then seated in a very
large dining room containing
countless items of English
memorabilia. Though I have
never been to England, the at
mosphere seemed to be from out
of an old Robin Hood movie,
where Robin would visit the
stately old mansion of a rich aris
tocratic landowner, and later ap
propriate some of the latter's
possessions. The room, although
not really elegant, had a certain
charm, and perhaps could have
been cozy except for the size.
We were greeted by a very
courteous, but somewhat shy
waitress named Sheri. (I must
say, however, that the "wench"
costume worn by the waitresses
borders on bad taste or embar
rassment, and seems a little in
appropriate in a family-style re
staurant. Perhaps the manage

ment feels the uniforms are cute,
but sexist would probably be a
better adjective.)
In any event, we began our ex
cursion with a choice of either
the Glubbdubdrib Sallet (tossed
salad for you uneducated col
onists) or the pottage (soup) of
the day. My friend elected to go
with the salad of hearts of romaine
lettuce, garnished with chopped
egg, a cherry tomato, baby bay
shrimp and an oil and vinegar
dressing. It was the standard
house salad, quite good though
not spectacular.
1 really savored my pottage,
however. It was potato leek
soup, and extremely tasty. I al
most felt like a kid (heck, I still
do it) wanting to ask mom for
seconds, but seeing that I was at a
restaurant with a "date" (and I'd
ruin my appetite anyway), my
better judgment restrained me.
Gulliver's prides itself on its
prime rib (in fact, it promises you
"the best Prime Rib experience
ever"). Thus, my friend ordered
the regular Gulliver cut, a gener
ous slab of beef which goes for
$12.50. The other similarly
priced cuts are the Big Endian
cut (brown and crispy) and the
Prime Minister cut, which is
thinly sliced. And if you're re
cruiting a defensive tackle for the
Cardinal football team, better
get the Brobdingnagian, a full
bone cut for $16.95.
The prime rib was excellent (I,
of course, couldn't resist tasting)
— not too chewy nor too tough.
However, 1 was somewhat dis
appointed with my entree, the
Crispy Long Island Duck
($11.50). I wanted to try some
thing other than prime rib, and
being enthralled in conversation,
I neglected to notice that the
duck came "crispy." It was a bit
too crisp and dry for my taste,
but then again, I was forewarned
by the menu.
I think next time I'll order
prime rib, or if I don't care for
red meat that night, I'll try the
whole boneless breast of chic
ken, which comes sauteed on a
bed of mushrooms with red wine
and Bernaise on top. (Sounds
good — for only $9.75.) Gul
liver's also has cold water West
Australian lobster tail ($12.75),
Petrale sole ($10.50), and filet of
salmon ($11.75) for dinner.
I must also comment on the
side orders that accompany the
entrees. We both had creamed
corn (Gulliver's famous creamed
corn, of course). Whether it is
famous or not is one matter —
butifit isn't, it should be. It had a
great texture and was slightly

(but not overly) sweet. Equally
as good was their creamed
spinach souffle. It's the kind of
spinach you'd like even if you
hated it as a kid.
During dinner we had a fine
Napa Valley wine. Although
etiquette usually dictates a red
wine with beef, we decided that
since we preferred white wine,
we'd have that instead. (Take thai,
Miss Manners!) Now, 1 am not
by any means a wine connois

however. It was potato leek
soup, and extremely tasty. I al
most felt like a kid (heck, I still
do it) wanting to ask mom for
seconds, but seeing that I was at a
restaurant with a "date" (and I'd
ruin my appetite anyway), my
better judgment restrained me.
Gulliver's prides itself on its
prime rib (in fact, it promises you
"the best Prime Rib experience
ever"). Thus, my friend ordered
the regular Gulliver cut, a gener
ous slab of beef which goes for
$12.50. The other similarly
priced cuts are the Big Endian
cut (brown and crispy) and the
Prime Minister cut, which is
thinly sliced. And if you're re
cruiting a defensive tackle for the
Cardinal football team, better
get the Brobdingnagian, a full
bone cut for $16.95.
The prime rib was excellent (I,
of course, couldn't resist tasting)
— not too chewy nor too tough.
However, 1 was somewhat dis
appointed with my entree, the
Crispy Long Island Duck
($11.50). I wanted to try some
thing other than prime rib, and
being enthralled in conversation,
I neglected to notice that the
duck came "crispy." It was a bit
too crisp and dry for my taste,
but then again, I was forewarned
by the menu.
I think next time I'll order
prime rib, or if I don't care for
red meat that night, I'll try the
whole boneless breast of chic
ken, which comes sauteed on a
bed of mushrooms with red wine
and Bernaise on top. (Sounds
good — for only $9.75.) Gul
liver's also has cold water West
Australian lobster tail ($12.75),
Petrale sole ($10.50), and filet of
salmon ($11.75) for dinner.
I must also comment on the
side orders that accompany the
entrees. We both had creamed
corn (Gulliver's famous creamed
corn, of course). Whether it is
famous or not is one matter —
butifit isn't, it should be. It had a
great texture and was slightly

(but not overly) sweet. Equally
as good was their creamed
spinach souffle. It's the kind of
spinach you'd like even if you
hated it as a kid.
During dinner we had a fine
Napa Valley wine. Although
etiquette usually dictates a red
wine with beef, we decided that
since we preferred white wine,
we'd have that instead. (Take thai,
Miss Manners!) Now, 1 am not
by any means a wine connois
seur, but in the words of a retired
Supreme Court Justice, I may
not be able to explain it, "but I
know it when I see it." The wine
was neither too sweet nor over
powering, and was very refresh
ing. Gulliver's offers a different
selected California wine for
less than $6 every month. If you
want to impress your date, then
you may want to go with the
more expensive $15 wine, but
the one we had was just fine.
By this time we were pretty
full, but seeing that I was with a
dessert connoisseur (and ad

diet!), we couldn't resist going
for dessert. All the desserts at
Gulliver's are $2.25, and from
what we tasted, more than worth
it. My friend had the Chocolate
Temptation, and tempting it was.
It was an incredibly rich choco
late on chocolate cake. My
friend, being reasonably expert
on chocolate (I wouldn't be the
least bit surprised if she had a
degree in Chocolatry, or what
ever) obviously enjoyed it
thoroughly.
Yet even better was the Trifle
pudding (sherried of course).
This is a traditional English con
fection, made with Devonshire
cream, almond sponge cake,
raspberries, and topped with
whipped cream and strawberries
— and doused in sherry. It has a
pronounced sherry taste (so
much so that one with a low al
cohol tolerance might even feel a
wee bit tipsy — no such problem
here, though). Nonetheless, it
was delicious! Needless to say, as
full as we had been, we were now
bloated. Maybe next time we'll

skip something beforehand to
really savor the desserts (al
though we did a pretty fair job in
spite of ourselves). Gulliver's
also offers an apple crumb cake
and a vanilla rum mousse.
All in all, it was quite a satisfy
ing culinary experience. We en
joyed it all except for the
aforementioned "crispy" duck.
Our waitress was hospitable and
efficient. The atmosphere was
Old World and though it was
really crowded, it was not rowdy
or pub-like. The crowd was
mostly older, but there were a
good number of younger people,
and even a few kids. The dress is
informal (though I wouldn't go
in a tattered "Beat the Weenies"
T-shirt, either). Gulliver's has a
lunch menu as well, and serves
lunch from 11:30 a.m. to 3:30
p.m. on weekdays. I would re
commend making reservations
on a weekend night for dinner.
Now, about that quarter at
Cliveden ....
