Until the other day, I think my closest experience
with "taking tea and crumpets" was what I had wit
nessed once on an Upstairs, Downstairs episode.
Thanks to the London House though, this charming
British custom is one we American no longer merely
have to daydream about.
As my friend and I first stepped through a very
elegant wrought-iron gateway our curiosity was im
mediately roused by numerous cabinets and tables
displaying assorted stocks of imported teas, jams and
chocolates. The decor so cleverly mimics an English
tea shop that at first glance you may honestly wonder
if a hostess will ask to seat you. (However, there is no
real worry in this regard; we were seated promptly
despite the bustling Friday lunch hour.)
Although our table was practically touching the
neighboring tables, the visuaJ effects provided by the
homey fireplace, colorful British Isles posters and
"The Celtic Shop" above us were a relaxing counter
part to the sometimes-distracting noise level. Unfor
tunately, toward the end of the meal I have to admit I
became more interested in watching the waitresses
confusedly maneuver their ways through the crowded
dining area than I was in watching the authentic sur
roundings.
My friend was to point ouLinbehalf otthe
ojlfierwise flawless tea room peik
time would most likely be exactry'the one w« chose,
Friday around noon. If a more intimate or peaceful
environment were desired, dinner at The London
House would have to be the better choice.
From the moment I opened the menu, I realized
that this was certain to be one lunch my taste-buds
would long remember. Naturally, neither my friend
nor I could justify passing over the extensive list of
Twining teas, although we did restrain ourselves
from the very tempting list of lagers and ales. Our
waitress (whose delightful British accent caught us

momentarily offguard) very promptly arrived with
the Orange Pekoe and English Breakfast teas in their
spotless Royal Doulton china pots.
Throughout the meal, meticulous and personal at
tention seemed to be paid to the appearance of each
container and corresponding food item. It came as no
surprise that the owner, upon being introduced to us
at the end of our lunch, proved to be a beautifully
dressed and proud Englishwoman who showed a
friendly interest in her patrons.
Apparently, she first intended — 14 years ago —to
open a shop serving primarily tea and freshly-baked
cakes reminiscent of English tea rooms in which
"single women might grab a snack while reading the
afternoon paper etc." Although women, along with a
slightly older crowd, did prevail in the restaurant on
that particular Friday, TTie London House had its
share of men and younger couples as well. Not only
has the patronage expanded beyond the bounds of
her original intention, but the menu has been mag
nified toinclude such classic choices as Welsh rarebit,
Cornish beef pastie and Ploughman's Lunch.
But after reading the description of the chicken
salad (served with celery, nuts, apples, onion and sour
cream dressing), I couldn't be persuaded even by the
more traditional-sounding dishes. My partner wisely
chose the pair of English crumpets with minced ham
and cheddar cheese ($5.15) which was accompanied
by a simple toss of lettuce, tomatos and cucumber.
Attempting a review of our two entrees is my most
difficult task in writing this article, not because I am
unsure of the verdict, but because I know I could
never convey in words the absolute deliciousness of
our courses. On first impression, I was doubtful that
the portions could satisfy those with more demanding
appetites; yet both my creamy chicken salad and my
partner's smothered crumpets remained so rich
through the course of our conversation (and munch
ing) that we both eventually found them challenging
to finish.
My few bites of the crumpet — a "crumpet" is a
moister, more flavorful counterpart of what we know
as the English muffin — were I hope, enough to allow

me to judge this meaty version as subtly spiced and
very pleasantly tangy. I would guess that the majority
of the fantastic flavor came from a naturally sharp
cheddar which was wonderfully gooey, though the
crumpets certainly had a large enough proportion of
ham to include it as a contender in the taste-making.
The consistency of the crumpet itself ws so enjoyable
that I would probably choose the crumpets with jam
on my next visit in order to capture the bread's taste
more completely, and more important, in order to
save upwards of $2.50.
Despite the seemingly high $5.25 for the chicken
salad (served with a small helping of canned fruit and
homemade buttered bread), there couldn't be a tas
tier nor more original recipe of this sandwich spread
anywhere. Not only was there an incredibly large
amount of very tender chicken, but the texture was
superb with the sprinkling of walnuts and green ap
ple. No single ingredient of the recipe overpowered
the whole, though the apples obviously lent the un
usually nice sweet taste to the chicken and the sour
cream was responsible for the perfectly smooth con
sist* ocy of the sauce.
While I have no doubt that my friend and I would
have walked away delighted with the London House
fare had we not ordered dessert, the thought of refus
ing the cake cart was just too painful for us. My
Orange-Chocolate Gateau ($1.95) really seemed to
melt in my smiling mouth, but not even its delicate
taste could match that of our other selection — the
English Trifle. This strawberry-topped shortcake,
layered with mounds of whipped cream, was so
drenched with sherry that the bowl literally fumed
with wonderful flavor.
All in all, the London House is a restaurant that
aims to please and succeeds beautifully in its task. I
cannot imagine that anyone with an interest in crea
tive, delicious food would be able to resist the Lon
don House for much longer.

Attempting a review of our two entrees is my most
difficult task in writing this article, not because I am
unsure of the verdict, but because I know I could
never convey in words the absolute deliciousness of
our courses. On first impression, I was doubtful that
the portions could satisfy those with more demanding
appetites; yet both my creamy chicken salad and my
partner's smothered crumpets remained so rich
through the course of our conversation (and munch
ing) that we both eventually found them challenging
to finish.
My few bites of the crumpet — a "crumpet" is a
moister, more flavorful counterpart of what we know
as the English muffin — were I hope, enough to allow

me to judge this meaty version as subtly spiced and
very pleasantly tangy. I would guess that the majority
of the fantastic flavor came from a naturally sharp
cheddar which was wonderfully gooey, though the
crumpets certainly had a large enough proportion of
ham to include it as a contender in the taste-making.
The consistency of the crumpet itself ws so enjoyable
that I would probably choose the crumpets with jam
on my next visit in order to capture the bread's taste
more completely, and more important, in order to
save upwards of $2.50.
Despite the seemingly high $5.25 for the chicken
salad (served with a small helping of canned fruit and
homemade buttered bread), there couldn't be a tas
tier nor more original recipe of this sandwich spread
anywhere. Not only was there an incredibly large
amount of very tender chicken, but the texture was
superb with the sprinkling of walnuts and green ap
ple. No single ingredient of the recipe overpowered
the whole, though the apples obviously lent the un
usually nice sweet taste to the chicken and the sour
cream was responsible for the perfectly smooth con
sist* ocy of the sauce.
While I have no doubt that my friend and I would
have walked away delighted with the London House
fare had we not ordered dessert, the thought of refus
ing the cake cart was just too painful for us. My
Orange-Chocolate Gateau ($1.95) really seemed to
melt in my smiling mouth, but not even its delicate
taste could match that of our other selection — the
English Trifle. This strawberry-topped shortcake,
layered with mounds of whipped cream, was so
drenched with sherry that the bowl literally fumed
with wonderful flavor.
All in all, the London House is a restaurant that
aims to please and succeeds beautifully in its task. I
cannot imagine that anyone with an interest in crea
tive, delicious food would be able to resist the Lon
don House for much longer.
THE LONDON HOUSE

Until the other day, I think my closest experience
with "taking tea and crumpets" was what I had wit
nessed once on an Upstairs, Downstairs episode.
Thanks to the London House though, this charming
British custom is one we American no longer merely
have to daydream about.
As my friend and I first stepped through a very
elegant wrought-iron gateway our curiosity was im
mediately roused by numerous cabinets and tables
displaying assorted stocks of imported teas, jams and
chocolates. The decor so cleverly mimics an English
tea shop that at first glance you may honestly wonder
if a hostess will ask to seat you. (However, there is no
real worry in this regard; we were seated promptly
despite the bustling Friday lunch hour.)
Although our table was practically touching the
neighboring tables, the visuaJ effects provided by the
homey fireplace, colorful British Isles posters and
"The Celtic Shop" above us were a relaxing counter
part to the sometimes-distracting noise level. Unfor
tunately, toward the end of the meal I have to admit I
became more interested in watching the waitresses
confusedly maneuver their ways through the crowded
dining area than I was in watching the authentic sur
roundings.
My friend was to point ouLinbehalf otthe
ojlfierwise flawless tea room peik
time would most likely be exactry'the one w« chose,
Friday around noon. If a more intimate or peaceful
environment were desired, dinner at The London
House would have to be the better choice.
From the moment I opened the menu, I realized
that this was certain to be one lunch my taste-buds
would long remember. Naturally, neither my friend
nor I could justify passing over the extensive list of
Twining teas, although we did restrain ourselves
from the very tempting list of lagers and ales. Our
waitress (whose delightful British accent caught us

momentarily offguard) very promptly arrived with
the Orange Pekoe and English Breakfast teas in their
spotless Royal Doulton china pots.
Throughout the meal, meticulous and personal at
tention seemed to be paid to the appearance of each
container and corresponding food item. It came as no
surprise that the owner, upon being introduced to us
at the end of our lunch, proved to be a beautifully
dressed and proud Englishwoman who showed a
friendly interest in her patrons.
Apparently, she first intended — 14 years ago —to
open a shop serving primarily tea and freshly-baked
cakes reminiscent of English tea rooms in which
"single women might grab a snack while reading the
afternoon paper etc." Although women, along with a
slightly older crowd, did prevail in the restaurant on
that particular Friday, TTie London House had its
share of men and younger couples as well. Not only
has the patronage expanded beyond the bounds of
her original intention, but the menu has been mag
nified toinclude such classic choices as Welsh rarebit,
Cornish beef pastie and Ploughman's Lunch.
But after reading the description of the chicken
salad (served with celery, nuts, apples, onion and sour
cream dressing), I couldn't be persuaded even by the
more traditional-sounding dishes. My partner wisely
chose the pair of English crumpets with minced ham
and cheddar cheese ($5.15) which was accompanied
by a simple toss of lettuce, tomatos and cucumber.
