Nations agree to strengthen IMF resources
The world's leading industrial nations agreed yesterday to a major
strengthening of the International Monetary Fund's resources to fend off
potential default by Third World countries on their international debts.
At the same time, in a significant policy reversal, the Western nations that
make up the Group of Ten agreed to stress "renewed and sustained" eco
nomic growth to counter a global recession that is becoming the worst since
the Great Depression. Until now, the policy focus of the major nations and
the international lending organizations such as the IMF has been to fight
inflation.
The finance ministers of the 10 wealthy nations, meeting in Paris, took two
steps to enlarge the resources of the IMF, the Washington-based arm of the
World Bank that provides loans to less developed nations. They created a
new SI9 billion emergency fund, available to any IMF member with prob
lems that "pose a threat to the stability of the international monetary sys
tem." An existing $7 billion fund of the Group of 10, known as the General
Agreement to Borrow, or GAB, has been available only to the rich donor
countries themselves.
They also promised to support a "substantial" increase in the normal re
sources of the IMF — the quotas, or deposits, put up by the member coun
tries—at a meeting of the IMF policy board in Washington Feb. lOand 11.
But the pledge that the rich countries would undertake steps by midyear to
"ensure renewed and sustained growth'' is considered equally important, a
recognition that larger loan resources alone won't move the world out of its
worst recession since the Great Depression. Treasury Undersecretary Beryl
Sprinkel argued in Paris that those countries, including the United States,
that have made major progress in reducing inflation should turn attention
now to stimulating economic growth.
No details were made available on the cxact steps the leading
nations could take to stimulate growth. Conference chairman
Jacques Delors, France's finance minister, cautioned that "we
are not magicians" who can create an economic recovery over
night.
But the new emphasis on the urgency of economic growth and
the reduction of unemployment amounts to an about-face on in
ternational economic policy. Secretary of State George Shultz
recently warned that without new global growth, Third World
countries could never earn enough money to pay off their in
ternational debts.
Japanese trade limits may be resisted
Washington — President Reagan and Japanese Prime Minister
Yasuhiro Nakasone agreed yesterday to resist pressures to im
pose import and export limits but did not discuss the key issue of
Japanese auto exports, a senior administration official said.
The two leaders agreed to have breakfast at the White House
today. Reagan said the two-hour meeting resulted in "very fruit
ful discussions of difficult problems of trade and defense," but
no specific steps on areas of dispute between the two countries
were announced.
The president said in describing the U.S.-Japanese rela
tionship at the start of the session: "It's like a happy marriage.
Sometimes you argue. But it's still a happy marriage."
"You cannot maintain a close alliance if you do not talk to
each other," the president said, as he and Nakasone, warmed by
a blazing log fire, posed for photographs.
A close aide to Nakasone said the 64-year-old prime minister
wanted to create with Reagan "a personal relationship of trust"
to help overcome a period of "nagging each other about trivial
problems" between the two nations.
A Japanese embassy spokesman, who also asked that his name
not be used, said of the prime minister, "He doesn't necessarily
want to haggle over oranges and beef."
Nakasone is being called on in Japan to limit imports of U.S.
beef and citrus products, while Reagan is under pressure to con
tain Japanese exports to the United States.
Congress has been flirting with protectionist legislation, and
the automobile and steel industries are suffering from Japanese
competition that has brought a record trade imbalance of $20
billion in Japan's favor.
The senior administration official who described the meeting
said Reagan "was very forceful" in arguing against protec
tionism. He added that "both sides expressed a great sense of re
sponsibility to try to head off that kind of deterioration in the
world economy."
Nitze suggests flexibility in arms talks
Washington — U.S. arms control negotiator Paul Nitze said
yesterday that he is "confident that if it becomes wise for the
United States government to change its position" in talks with
the Soviet Union on reducing nuclear missiles in Europe "it will
in fact do so."
Nitze gave no indication that the Reagan administration is
considering any shift, but his remarks in an NBC television in
terview suggest for the first time that there may be some flexibili
ty in the U.S. position at the Geneva talks if the Soviet Union
offers a better proposal than it has.
Nitze said he was "completely satisfied" with the backing he
has received from the Reagan administration and with the U.S.
negotiating position.

In an earlier interview yesterday with The Washington Post,
Nitze also said that some ideas he and his Soviet counterpart dis
cussed informally last year about how to reduce nuclear missiles
in Europe "was not an agreement" in the sense of an offer by
either negotiator authorized by his government.
Referring to the Soviet negotiator, Nitze said that "what Am
bassador Yuli Kvitsinsky and I developed was an exploratory
package" of ideas "which was not an offer on behalf of the Unit
ed States and not an offer by him on behalf of the Soviet Union,
but which we considered both governments might wish to look
at."
The Soviets, Nitze said, "firmly rejected" the package, while
Washington "didn't feel they were adequate" but did not shut
the door as clearly as did Moscow.
Nitze, who rarely makes public statements on his role as the
chief U.S. negotiator at the Geneva talks on limiting in
termediate-range nuclear forces (INF) in Europe, did so Tuesday
in response to a storm of controversy here about the nego
tiations.
Administration officials are known to be concerned that re
cent shake-ups in the U.S. arms control agency, news accounts
about what has gone on behind closed doors in Geneva, an ag
gressive campaign of speeches by Soviet leaders and continued
pressure on the White House from here and abroad to reach an
accommodation with Moscow all threaten to undermine their
ability to manage these difficult negotiations.
Gromyko offers to dismantle missiles
Bonn, West Germany — Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei
Gromyko made a new pitch to West Germany's growing anti
nuclear movement yesterday with an offer to dismantle some of
the Soviet medium-range missiles aimed at Western Europe if the
Western allies cancel plans to deploy new U.S. rockets.
It was the second innovation in Soviet arms proposals ad
vanced by the veteran Soviet foreign minister in a four-day visit
to West Germany. Speaking Monday night at a dinner in his
honor, he said his government is prepared to negotiate an agree
ment for a mutual reduction of tactical missiles with a range of
less than 600 miles. It was the first such public offer by a Soviet
spokesman.
Although he once again said the Soviets would not reduce
their medium-range missiles targeted on Western Europe below
the number in the French and British arsenals, reputed to be 162,
Gromyko said at a news conference:
"We have said in the negotiations, some of the missiles could
be destroyed, others could be transported to other parts of the
Soviet Union where they could no longer reach the countries of
Western Europe."
It was believed to be the first time a Soviet leader said publicly
that the Kremlin was willing to dismantle some of its middle
range nuclear weapons. Last week, however, separate groups of
U.S. congressmen and West German officials said they had been
told in visits to Moscow of the Soviets' willingness to scrap some
missiles.
Otherwise Gromyko in his news conference and his speech the
night before broke no new ground.
U.S., Honduras plan military exercise
Washington — The United States and Honduras have
rescheduled for Feb. 1 a large-scale joint military exercise that
will deploy Honduran troops near that nation's tense border
with Nicaragua as part of a program "to improve the defense of
friendly nations," a Pentagon spokesman said yesterday.
The exercise will involve 4000 Hondurans and 1600 U.S. sup
port personnel, making it the largest ever conducted involving

the two countries. The estimated cost of U.S. participation is 55
million, said Pentagon spokesman Lt. Col. Carroll Williams.
The maneuvers, named Ahuas Tara, or Big Pine, are to last six
days. Williams said Honduran forces will operate within 10 miles
of the Nicaraguan border in the eastern province of Gracias a
Dios near the Caribbean coastline. About 10,000 Miskito Indi
ans who have fled Nicaragua are based in refugee camps there.
Originally scheduled for early December, the Big Pine ex
ercises were postponed to avoid increased tension in the region
during President Reagan's visit to Honduras and other Latin
American countries.
Big Pine has become another point of contention in strained
relations between the Reagan administration and the Sandinista
government. U.S. and Honduran officials have claimed that
Honduras' southern border has been violated repeatedly by
Nicaraguan-supported arms traffic destined for leftist insurgents
in El Salvador.
Administration to certify Salvador aid
San Salvador, El Salvador — U.S. Ambassador Deane Hinton
said Monday night the Reagan administration "should" and
"will" certify El Salvador's government eligible for more than
$200 million in U.S. military and economic aid this year.
U.S. officials here said yesterday morning that the certifica
tion, due by law within the next week, would be issued Friday in
Washington.
The president is required to certify to Congress twice a year
that the government it backs here is making progress in human
rights, social and economic reforms and the prosecutions of
Salvadoran soldiers who allegedly murdered U.S. citizens. Only
"very strong" evidence to the contrary could prevent the
certification from being made, Hinton said in an interview. The
alternative, he said, would be a probable defeat for the
Salvadoran government in its brutal war with leftist-led in
surgents.
"Surely," Hinton said, "any president or any administration
that thinks it would be a disaster if this country was taken over by
a totalitarian Marxist regime is going to hesitate a long time and
the evidence would have to be very strong before he decides not
to certify."
Hinton's remarks came as the Salvadoran government finds
itself in an especially delicate and dangerous situation both polit
ically and militarily.
An army mutiny has left the military high command, long cul
tivated by Washington, in disarray with a major reshuffling of
senior officers expected shortly.
Stocks drop in quiet trading
New York — Stock prices drifted lower in a relatively quiet ses
sion yesterday as traders cashed in on some of the market's re
cent gains.
But several leading blue chip and technology issues bucked the
downward trend.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which had climbed
10.86 points in the last two trading days, slipped back 5.16 to
1,079.65.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange slowed to 78.38
million shares from 89.21 million Monday.
Today's weather
Partly cloudy today after a slight chance of morning showers.
Highs in the 50s. Northwest winds 10 to 25 mph. Chance of rain
20 percent. Clearing tonight; mostly fair tomorrow.

"very strong" evidence to the contrary could prevent the
certification from being made, Hinton said in an interview. The
alternative, he said, would be a probable defeat for the
Salvadoran government in its brutal war with leftist-led in
surgents.
"Surely," Hinton said, "any president or any administration
that thinks it would be a disaster if this country was taken over by
a totalitarian Marxist regime is going to hesitate a long time and
the evidence would have to be very strong before he decides not
to certify."
Hinton's remarks came as the Salvadoran government finds
itself in an especially delicate and dangerous situation both polit
ically and militarily.
An army mutiny has left the military high command, long cul
tivated by Washington, in disarray with a major reshuffling of
senior officers expected shortly.

Nations agree to strengthen IMF resources
The world's leading industrial nations agreed yesterday to a major
strengthening of the International Monetary Fund's resources to fend off
potential default by Third World countries on their international debts.
At the same time, in a significant policy reversal, the Western nations that
make up the Group of Ten agreed to stress "renewed and sustained" eco
nomic growth to counter a global recession that is becoming the worst since
the Great Depression. Until now, the policy focus of the major nations and
the international lending organizations such as the IMF has been to fight
inflation.
The finance ministers of the 10 wealthy nations, meeting in Paris, took two
steps to enlarge the resources of the IMF, the Washington-based arm of the
World Bank that provides loans to less developed nations. They created a
new SI9 billion emergency fund, available to any IMF member with prob
lems that "pose a threat to the stability of the international monetary sys
tem." An existing $7 billion fund of the Group of 10, known as the General
Agreement to Borrow, or GAB, has been available only to the rich donor
countries themselves.
They also promised to support a "substantial" increase in the normal re
sources of the IMF — the quotas, or deposits, put up by the member coun
tries—at a meeting of the IMF policy board in Washington Feb. lOand 11.
But the pledge that the rich countries would undertake steps by midyear to
"ensure renewed and sustained growth'' is considered equally important, a
recognition that larger loan resources alone won't move the world out of its
worst recession since the Great Depression. Treasury Undersecretary Beryl
Sprinkel argued in Paris that those countries, including the United States,
that have made major progress in reducing inflation should turn attention
now to stimulating economic growth.
No details were made available on the cxact steps the leading
nations could take to stimulate growth. Conference chairman
Jacques Delors, France's finance minister, cautioned that "we
are not magicians" who can create an economic recovery over
night.
But the new emphasis on the urgency of economic growth and
the reduction of unemployment amounts to an about-face on in
ternational economic policy. Secretary of State George Shultz
recently warned that without new global growth, Third World
countries could never earn enough money to pay off their in
ternational debts.
Japanese trade limits may be resisted
Washington — President Reagan and Japanese Prime Minister
Yasuhiro Nakasone agreed yesterday to resist pressures to im
pose import and export limits but did not discuss the key issue of
Japanese auto exports, a senior administration official said.
The two leaders agreed to have breakfast at the White House
today. Reagan said the two-hour meeting resulted in "very fruit
ful discussions of difficult problems of trade and defense," but
no specific steps on areas of dispute between the two countries
were announced.
The president said in describing the U.S.-Japanese rela
tionship at the start of the session: "It's like a happy marriage.
Sometimes you argue. But it's still a happy marriage."
"You cannot maintain a close alliance if you do not talk to
each other," the president said, as he and Nakasone, warmed by
a blazing log fire, posed for photographs.
A close aide to Nakasone said the 64-year-old prime minister
wanted to create with Reagan "a personal relationship of trust"
to help overcome a period of "nagging each other about trivial
problems" between the two nations.
A Japanese embassy spokesman, who also asked that his name
not be used, said of the prime minister, "He doesn't necessarily
want to haggle over oranges and beef."
Nakasone is being called on in Japan to limit imports of U.S.
beef and citrus products, while Reagan is under pressure to con
tain Japanese exports to the United States.
Congress has been flirting with protectionist legislation, and
the automobile and steel industries are suffering from Japanese
competition that has brought a record trade imbalance of $20
billion in Japan's favor.
The senior administration official who described the meeting
said Reagan "was very forceful" in arguing against protec
tionism. He added that "both sides expressed a great sense of re
sponsibility to try to head off that kind of deterioration in the
world economy."
Nitze suggests flexibility in arms talks
Washington — U.S. arms control negotiator Paul Nitze said
yesterday that he is "confident that if it becomes wise for the
United States government to change its position" in talks with
the Soviet Union on reducing nuclear missiles in Europe "it will
in fact do so."
Nitze gave no indication that the Reagan administration is
considering any shift, but his remarks in an NBC television in
terview suggest for the first time that there may be some flexibili
ty in the U.S. position at the Geneva talks if the Soviet Union
offers a better proposal than it has.
Nitze said he was "completely satisfied" with the backing he
has received from the Reagan administration and with the U.S.
negotiating position.

In an earlier interview yesterday with The Washington Post,
Nitze also said that some ideas he and his Soviet counterpart dis
cussed informally last year about how to reduce nuclear missiles
in Europe "was not an agreement" in the sense of an offer by
either negotiator authorized by his government.
Referring to the Soviet negotiator, Nitze said that "what Am
bassador Yuli Kvitsinsky and I developed was an exploratory
package" of ideas "which was not an offer on behalf of the Unit
ed States and not an offer by him on behalf of the Soviet Union,
but which we considered both governments might wish to look
at."
The Soviets, Nitze said, "firmly rejected" the package, while
Washington "didn't feel they were adequate" but did not shut
the door as clearly as did Moscow.
Nitze, who rarely makes public statements on his role as the
chief U.S. negotiator at the Geneva talks on limiting in
termediate-range nuclear forces (INF) in Europe, did so Tuesday
in response to a storm of controversy here about the nego
tiations.
Administration officials are known to be concerned that re
cent shake-ups in the U.S. arms control agency, news accounts
about what has gone on behind closed doors in Geneva, an ag
gressive campaign of speeches by Soviet leaders and continued
pressure on the White House from here and abroad to reach an
accommodation with Moscow all threaten to undermine their
ability to manage these difficult negotiations.
Gromyko offers to dismantle missiles
Bonn, West Germany — Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei
Gromyko made a new pitch to West Germany's growing anti
nuclear movement yesterday with an offer to dismantle some of
the Soviet medium-range missiles aimed at Western Europe if the
Western allies cancel plans to deploy new U.S. rockets.
It was the second innovation in Soviet arms proposals ad
vanced by the veteran Soviet foreign minister in a four-day visit
to West Germany. Speaking Monday night at a dinner in his
honor, he said his government is prepared to negotiate an agree
ment for a mutual reduction of tactical missiles with a range of
less than 600 miles. It was the first such public offer by a Soviet
spokesman.
Although he once again said the Soviets would not reduce
their medium-range missiles targeted on Western Europe below
the number in the French and British arsenals, reputed to be 162,
Gromyko said at a news conference:
"We have said in the negotiations, some of the missiles could
be destroyed, others could be transported to other parts of the
Soviet Union where they could no longer reach the countries of
Western Europe."
It was believed to be the first time a Soviet leader said publicly
that the Kremlin was willing to dismantle some of its middle
range nuclear weapons. Last week, however, separate groups of
U.S. congressmen and West German officials said they had been
told in visits to Moscow of the Soviets' willingness to scrap some
missiles.
Otherwise Gromyko in his news conference and his speech the
night before broke no new ground.
U.S., Honduras plan military exercise
Washington — The United States and Honduras have
rescheduled for Feb. 1 a large-scale joint military exercise that
will deploy Honduran troops near that nation's tense border
with Nicaragua as part of a program "to improve the defense of
friendly nations," a Pentagon spokesman said yesterday.
The exercise will involve 4000 Hondurans and 1600 U.S. sup
port personnel, making it the largest ever conducted involving

the two countries. The estimated cost of U.S. participation is 55
million, said Pentagon spokesman Lt. Col. Carroll Williams.
The maneuvers, named Ahuas Tara, or Big Pine, are to last six
days. Williams said Honduran forces will operate within 10 miles
of the Nicaraguan border in the eastern province of Gracias a
Dios near the Caribbean coastline. About 10,000 Miskito Indi
ans who have fled Nicaragua are based in refugee camps there.
Originally scheduled for early December, the Big Pine ex
ercises were postponed to avoid increased tension in the region
during President Reagan's visit to Honduras and other Latin
American countries.
Big Pine has become another point of contention in strained
relations between the Reagan administration and the Sandinista
government. U.S. and Honduran officials have claimed that
Honduras' southern border has been violated repeatedly by
Nicaraguan-supported arms traffic destined for leftist insurgents
in El Salvador.
Administration to certify Salvador aid
San Salvador, El Salvador — U.S. Ambassador Deane Hinton
said Monday night the Reagan administration "should" and
"will" certify El Salvador's government eligible for more than
$200 million in U.S. military and economic aid this year.
U.S. officials here said yesterday morning that the certifica
tion, due by law within the next week, would be issued Friday in
Washington.
The president is required to certify to Congress twice a year
that the government it backs here is making progress in human
rights, social and economic reforms and the prosecutions of
Salvadoran soldiers who allegedly murdered U.S. citizens. Only
"very strong" evidence to the contrary could prevent the
certification from being made, Hinton said in an interview. The
alternative, he said, would be a probable defeat for the
Salvadoran government in its brutal war with leftist-led in
surgents.
"Surely," Hinton said, "any president or any administration

The exercise will involve 4000 Hondurans and 1600 U.S. sup
port personnel, making it the largest ever conducted involving

the two countries. The estimated cost of U.S. participation is 55
million, said Pentagon spokesman Lt. Col. Carroll Williams.
The maneuvers, named Ahuas Tara, or Big Pine, are to last six
days. Williams said Honduran forces will operate within 10 miles
of the Nicaraguan border in the eastern province of Gracias a
Dios near the Caribbean coastline. About 10,000 Miskito Indi
ans who have fled Nicaragua are based in refugee camps there.
Originally scheduled for early December, the Big Pine ex
ercises were postponed to avoid increased tension in the region
during President Reagan's visit to Honduras and other Latin
American countries.
Big Pine has become another point of contention in strained
relations between the Reagan administration and the Sandinista
government. U.S. and Honduran officials have claimed that
Honduras' southern border has been violated repeatedly by
Nicaraguan-supported arms traffic destined for leftist insurgents
in El Salvador.
Administration to certify Salvador aid
San Salvador, El Salvador — U.S. Ambassador Deane Hinton
said Monday night the Reagan administration "should" and
"will" certify El Salvador's government eligible for more than
$200 million in U.S. military and economic aid this year.
U.S. officials here said yesterday morning that the certifica
tion, due by law within the next week, would be issued Friday in
Washington.
The president is required to certify to Congress twice a year
that the government it backs here is making progress in human
rights, social and economic reforms and the prosecutions of
Salvadoran soldiers who allegedly murdered U.S. citizens. Only
"very strong" evidence to the contrary could prevent the
certification from being made, Hinton said in an interview. The
alternative, he said, would be a probable defeat for the
Salvadoran government in its brutal war with leftist-led in
surgents.
"Surely," Hinton said, "any president or any administration
that thinks it would be a disaster if this country was taken over by
a totalitarian Marxist regime is going to hesitate a long time and
the evidence would have to be very strong before he decides not
to certify."
Hinton's remarks came as the Salvadoran government finds
itself in an especially delicate and dangerous situation both polit
ically and militarily.
An army mutiny has left the military high command, long cul
tivated by Washington, in disarray with a major reshuffling of
senior officers expected shortly.
Stocks drop in quiet trading
New York — Stock prices drifted lower in a relatively quiet ses

The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which had climbed
10.86 points in the last two trading days, slipped back 5.16 to
1,079.65.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange slowed to 78.38
million shares from 89.21 million Monday.

Nations agree to strengthen IMF resources
The world's leading industrial nations agreed yesterday to a major
strengthening of the International Monetary Fund's resources to fend off
potential default by Third World countries on their international debts.
At the same time, in a significant policy reversal, the Western nations that
make up the Group of Ten agreed to stress "renewed and sustained" eco
nomic growth to counter a global recession that is becoming the worst since
the Great Depression. Until now, the policy focus of the major nations and
the international lending organizations such as the IMF has been to fight
inflation.
The finance ministers of the 10 wealthy nations, meeting in Paris, took two
steps to enlarge the resources of the IMF, the Washington-based arm of the
World Bank that provides loans to less developed nations. They created a
new SI9 billion emergency fund, available to any IMF member with prob
lems that "pose a threat to the stability of the international monetary sys
tem." An existing $7 billion fund of the Group of 10, known as the General
Agreement to Borrow, or GAB, has been available only to the rich donor
countries themselves.
They also promised to support a "substantial" increase in the normal re
sources of the IMF — the quotas, or deposits, put up by the member coun
tries—at a meeting of the IMF policy board in Washington Feb. lOand 11.
But the pledge that the rich countries would undertake steps by midyear to
"ensure renewed and sustained growth'' is considered equally important, a
recognition that larger loan resources alone won't move the world out of its
worst recession since the Great Depression. Treasury Undersecretary Beryl
Sprinkel argued in Paris that those countries, including the United States,
that have made major progress in reducing inflation should turn attention
now to stimulating economic growth.
No details were made available on the cxact steps the leading
nations could take to stimulate growth. Conference chairman
Jacques Delors, France's finance minister, cautioned that "we
are not magicians" who can create an economic recovery over
night.
But the new emphasis on the urgency of economic growth and
the reduction of unemployment amounts to an about-face on in
ternational economic policy. Secretary of State George Shultz
recently warned that without new global growth, Third World
countries could never earn enough money to pay off their in
ternational debts.
Japanese trade limits may be resisted
Washington — President Reagan and Japanese Prime Minister
Yasuhiro Nakasone agreed yesterday to resist pressures to im
pose import and export limits but did not discuss the key issue of
Japanese auto exports, a senior administration official said.
The two leaders agreed to have breakfast at the White House
today. Reagan said the two-hour meeting resulted in "very fruit
ful discussions of difficult problems of trade and defense," but
no specific steps on areas of dispute between the two countries
were announced.
The president said in describing the U.S.-Japanese rela
tionship at the start of the session: "It's like a happy marriage.
Sometimes you argue. But it's still a happy marriage."
"You cannot maintain a close alliance if you do not talk to
each other," the president said, as he and Nakasone, warmed by
a blazing log fire, posed for photographs.
A close aide to Nakasone said the 64-year-old prime minister
wanted to create with Reagan "a personal relationship of trust"
to help overcome a period of "nagging each other about trivial
problems" between the two nations.
A Japanese embassy spokesman, who also asked that his name
not be used, said of the prime minister, "He doesn't necessarily
want to haggle over oranges and beef."
Nakasone is being called on in Japan to limit imports of U.S.
beef and citrus products, while Reagan is under pressure to con
tain Japanese exports to the United States.
Congress has been flirting with protectionist legislation, and
the automobile and steel industries are suffering from Japanese
competition that has brought a record trade imbalance of $20
billion in Japan's favor.
The senior administration official who described the meeting
said Reagan "was very forceful" in arguing against protec
tionism. He added that "both sides expressed a great sense of re
sponsibility to try to head off that kind of deterioration in the
world economy."
Nitze suggests flexibility in arms talks
Washington — U.S. arms control negotiator Paul Nitze said
yesterday that he is "confident that if it becomes wise for the
United States government to change its position" in talks with
the Soviet Union on reducing nuclear missiles in Europe "it will
in fact do so."
Nitze gave no indication that the Reagan administration is
considering any shift, but his remarks in an NBC television in
terview suggest for the first time that there may be some flexibili
ty in the U.S. position at the Geneva talks if the Soviet Union
offers a better proposal than it has.
Nitze said he was "completely satisfied" with the backing he
has received from the Reagan administration and with the U.S.
negotiating position.

In an earlier interview yesterday with The Washington Post,
Nitze also said that some ideas he and his Soviet counterpart dis
cussed informally last year about how to reduce nuclear missiles
in Europe "was not an agreement" in the sense of an offer by
either negotiator authorized by his government.
Referring to the Soviet negotiator, Nitze said that "what Am
bassador Yuli Kvitsinsky and I developed was an exploratory
package" of ideas "which was not an offer on behalf of the Unit
ed States and not an offer by him on behalf of the Soviet Union,
but which we considered both governments might wish to look
at."
The Soviets, Nitze said, "firmly rejected" the package, while
Washington "didn't feel they were adequate" but did not shut
the door as clearly as did Moscow.
Nitze, who rarely makes public statements on his role as the
chief U.S. negotiator at the Geneva talks on limiting in
termediate-range nuclear forces (INF) in Europe, did so Tuesday
in response to a storm of controversy here about the nego
tiations.
Administration officials are known to be concerned that re
cent shake-ups in the U.S. arms control agency, news accounts
about what has gone on behind closed doors in Geneva, an ag
gressive campaign of speeches by Soviet leaders and continued
pressure on the White House from here and abroad to reach an
accommodation with Moscow all threaten to undermine their
ability to manage these difficult negotiations.
Gromyko offers to dismantle missiles
Bonn, West Germany — Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei
Gromyko made a new pitch to West Germany's growing anti
nuclear movement yesterday with an offer to dismantle some of
the Soviet medium-range missiles aimed at Western Europe if the
Western allies cancel plans to deploy new U.S. rockets.
It was the second innovation in Soviet arms proposals ad
vanced by the veteran Soviet foreign minister in a four-day visit
to West Germany. Speaking Monday night at a dinner in his
honor, he said his government is prepared to negotiate an agree
ment for a mutual reduction of tactical missiles with a range of
less than 600 miles. It was the first such public offer by a Soviet
spokesman.
Although he once again said the Soviets would not reduce
their medium-range missiles targeted on Western Europe below
the number in the French and British arsenals, reputed to be 162,
Gromyko said at a news conference:
"We have said in the negotiations, some of the missiles could
be destroyed, others could be transported to other parts of the
Soviet Union where they could no longer reach the countries of
Western Europe."
It was believed to be the first time a Soviet leader said publicly
that the Kremlin was willing to dismantle some of its middle
range nuclear weapons. Last week, however, separate groups of
U.S. congressmen and West German officials said they had been
told in visits to Moscow of the Soviets' willingness to scrap some
missiles.
Otherwise Gromyko in his news conference and his speech the
night before broke no new ground.
U.S., Honduras plan military exercise
Washington — The United States and Honduras have
rescheduled for Feb. 1 a large-scale joint military exercise that
will deploy Honduran troops near that nation's tense border
with Nicaragua as part of a program "to improve the defense of
friendly nations," a Pentagon spokesman said yesterday.
The exercise will involve 4000 Hondurans and 1600 U.S. sup
port personnel, making it the largest ever conducted involving

the two countries. The estimated cost of U.S. participation is 55
