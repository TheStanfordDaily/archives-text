Nations agree to strengthen IMF resources
The world's leading industrial nations agreed yesterday to a major
strengthening of the International Monetary Fund's resources to fend off
potential default by Third World countries on their international debts.
At the same time, in a significant policy reversal, the Western nations that
make up the Group of Ten agreed to stress "renewed and sustained" eco
nomic growth to counter a global recession that is becoming the worst since
the Great Depression. Until now, the policy focus of the major nations and
the international lending organizations such as the IMF has been to fight
inflation.
The finance ministers of the 10 wealthy nations, meeting in Paris, took two
steps to enlarge the resources of the IMF, the Washington-based arm of the
World Bank that provides loans to less developed nations. They created a
new SI9 billion emergency fund, available to any IMF member with prob
lems that "pose a threat to the stability of the international monetary sys
tem." An existing $7 billion fund of the Group of 10, known as the General
Agreement to Borrow, or GAB, has been available only to the rich donor
countries themselves.
They also promised to support a "substantial" increase in the normal re
sources of the IMF — the quotas, or deposits, put up by the member coun
tries—at a meeting of the IMF policy board in Washington Feb. lOand 11.
But the pledge that the rich countries would undertake steps by midyear to
"ensure renewed and sustained growth'' is considered equally important, a
recognition that larger loan resources alone won't move the world out of its
worst recession since the Great Depression. Treasury Undersecretary Beryl
Sprinkel argued in Paris that those countries, including the United States,
that have made major progress in reducing inflation should turn attention
now to stimulating economic growth.
