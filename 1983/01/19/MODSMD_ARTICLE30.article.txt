# Kennedy to choose Queen's guest list
## 
### 
President Donald Kennedy's office
informed the Daily yesterday that the
process for choosing students to attend
the March 3 luncheon for Queen
Elizabeth II will not involve "picking
from a hat," as Jim Lyons, dean of stu
dent affairs, indicated on Sunday.
"There is not going to be a random
selection . .. the president is sorry that
that impression got out," Bob
Hamrdla, assistant to the president,
said.
Based on information provided by
Lyons, a story in Monday's Daily re
ported that only students who have
written letters to Kennedy expressing a
desire to attend or who have been
nominated for the Dean's Service

Award would have the opportunity to
be invited. The names of those invited
were to be drawn from a hat, according
to Lyons.
"The president is going to make the
decision," Hamrdla said. The office of
the dean of student affairs will propose
some names, he added, but others will
be considered.
"There will certainly be an effort to
have a broad representation,"
Hamrdla said.
The president's office has requested
that students stop sending letters re
questing an invitation.
"People who send letters now will
not be considered," Hamrdla said.
