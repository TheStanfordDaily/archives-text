Despite some local opposition, Uni
versity officials have high hopes thaf
Stanford's proposed extension of Wil
low Road to El Camino Real, an histor
ically controversial issue in the com
munity, will survive the time
consuming approval process necessary
for the start of construction.
"I think it does have a good chance
this time," said Andy Doty, director of
community relations." I think that if we
can demonstrate that there are benefits
to the project and that there would be a
minimum of disadvantage to the city,
that enough votes will surface."
Kenneth Schreiber, Palo Alto plan
ning director, said, "The information
that will come from the Environmental
Impact Report will be very important."
Last December, the Stanford Board
of Trustees approved the concept of
the Willow Road extension at an esti
mated cost of $1.8 to $2.2 million. The
road would be built through a vacant
lot between the Stanford Shopping
Center and San Francisquito Creek,
according to Fi ank Morrow, director of
real estate here. A plan calling for a
large island in the middle of El Camino
Real which would prevent traffic from
crossing the highway onto Alma St. has
been submitted to the City of Palo
Alto.
According to Schreiber, the Palo
Alto Planning Commission is now
working with Stanford and several con
sultants "to put together a scope of
work, a schedule, that sort of thing."
Schreiber expects that the consul
tants will soon start work on the En
vironmental Impact Report. He said
that the consultants will work for the
city of Palo Alto but will be paid by
Stanford, which is funding the entire
project. Phyllis Potter, of the environ
mental assessment division, said that
she will be closely involved with the
environmental study, but that the out
side consultants will actually conduct it.
Schreiber said that the consultants
will need eight weeks to prepare a pre
liminary draft of the reportfor the Uni
