# Willow Road extension likely
## 
### LESLIE WEEDEN 
Despite some local opposition, Uni
versity officials have high hopes thaf
Stanford's proposed extension of Wil
low Road to El Camino Real, an histor
ically controversial issue in the com
munity, will survive the time
consuming approval process necessary
for the start of construction.
"I think it does have a good chance
this time," said Andy Doty, director of
community relations." I think that if we
can demonstrate that there are benefits
to the project and that there would be a
minimum of disadvantage to the city,
that enough votes will surface."
Kenneth Schreiber, Palo Alto plan
ning director, said, "The information
that will come from the Environmental
Impact Report will be very important."
Last December, the Stanford Board
of Trustees approved the concept of
the Willow Road extension at an esti
mated cost of $1.8 to $2.2 million. The
road would be built through a vacant
lot between the Stanford Shopping
Center and San Francisquito Creek,
according to Fi ank Morrow, director of
real estate here. A plan calling for a
large island in the middle of El Camino
Real which would prevent traffic from
crossing the highway onto Alma St. has
been submitted to the City of Palo
Alto.
According to Schreiber, the Palo
Alto Planning Commission is now
working with Stanford and several con
sultants "to put together a scope of
work, a schedule, that sort of thing."
Schreiber expects that the consul
tants will soon start work on the En
vironmental Impact Report. He said
that the consultants will work for the
city of Palo Alto but will be paid by
Stanford, which is funding the entire
project. Phyllis Potter, of the environ
mental assessment division, said that
she will be closely involved with the
environmental study, but that the out
side consultants will actually conduct it.
Schreiber said that the consultants
will need eight weeks to prepare a pre
liminary draft of the reportfor the Uni

GETTING THE GREEN LIGHT?: University officials are optimistic
that a plan to extend Willow Road to El Camino Real will be endorsed bv

however, must make it through a rigorous approval process.
versity, then an additional three to four
weeks to get it ready for public review.
From there it will go to the Planning
Commission for public hearings. The
State requires a 4 5-day review period
after the report is made available to the
public, before it is voted on by the City
Council. Schreiber expects the report
to be available sometime in May for
public hearings. Stanford hopes that
construction will start in July.
"Willow Road has been a very con
troversial issue," said Schreiber. "His
torically it has been a hotly debated,
highly contested issue."
The matter goes back to the 1950s
when thre was a proposal for a Willow
Freeway which would have run from

highway 101 to 280. The proposal was
soundly defeated in the late 1960s by a
referendum in Menio Park.
"That is no longer a proposal. It is a
concept that would be extremely dif
ficult, if not impossible, to implement,
but because it was a real proposal that
was debated vigorously, there is still
fear of it," Schreiber said.
Increased traffic on Alma Street due
to the extension is also a matter of pub
lic concern. Morrow said, "We are well
aware of the desire on the part of the
city to prevent traffic from crossing
onto Alma Street, so our consultant
engineers have tried to devise an inter
section arrangement that will make any
crossing extremely difficult, as well as
illegal."
Schreiber said that some people in
the community feel that building more
roads is no solution to traffic problems
and some feel that the road itself will
generate traffic. They fear that a more

direct route in Palo Alto to 280 from
101, where currently there are few, will
cause more traffic in other parts of the
city such as University Avenue and
Embarcadero Road.
Doty, adding to the list of reasons for
the opposition, said, "I think you have
an anti-growth argument: concrete be
gets concrete." Close to this argument
is that of the environmentalists which
has to do with the number of trees
which will have to be cut down. How
ever, the proposed alignment of the
Willow Road extension is designed to
protect as many trees as possible in the
area, according to a report to the board
of trustees.
According to Doty, officially the
project needs only the approval of the
Palo Alto City Council. But in the past,
out of courtesy, the projects have also
been submitted to the Menlo Park City
Council for approval.
