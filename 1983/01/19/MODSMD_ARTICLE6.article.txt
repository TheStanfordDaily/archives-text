# New suites give residents some inconveniences
## 
### JULIE HAGEN 
The newly-built suites located in Governor's
Corner opened amidst high praise slightly more than
two weeks ago, yet suite residents report that a few
problems do exist in the University's version of the
promised land.
Cold showers preceded the first class of the quarter
for most suite residents,due toan unexplained power
outage. Jan Van Houten, director of Governor's
Corner, emphasized that this was a one-time occurr
ence and since that time a plumber has been on hand
every morning at 6:30 so that should another power
outage occur, it will be taken care of immediately.
The fire alarms installed in all the new buildings
have been a more persistent problem for students,
according to Van Houten. The alarms are extremely
sensitive and may be set off by a single cigarette, a
popcorn maker, or simply dust, she said.
"Everyone thinks the suites are sogrcat. Ask them
if they'd like to come out here and wake up at 7 a.m.
with the fire alarms," said sophomore resident Mark
Kim.
In fact, sleep may turn out to be a precious com
modity in the suites, because as resident Karen Men
donca remarked, "If the fire alarms at four, five or
seven don't get you, you can't miss the bulldozers at
eight." Work to complete the landscaping of the area
begins every morning at 8, resulting in a lot of noise,
and, it appears, a lot of mud.

"Everyone has seen the aesthetic quality of the
suites — the beautiful view of the lake, the nice
landscaping ... what about the beautiful pastoral
colors as the mud washes against the walls or the
picturesque view of the garbage cans?" queried Ted
Mourouzis, resident of Griffin House. Mourouzis
also questioned the lack of fans installed in the bat
hrooms of the individual suites, producing "mysteri
ous puddles" on the floor of the bathroom when
steam condenses and runs down the walls after four
showers per morning. Other residents report that
too-short, or absent shower curtains also contribute
to the ever-present puddles.
The lofted beds necessary in the seven by 10 foot
bedrooms also present a problem for some suite resi
dents. Russell Jong, sophomore, reported that his
roommate actually fell out of bed — about a s'/2-foot
drop. "I guess he started rolling and just kept going.
Luckily he was unhurt; I thought he was dead. Now
he wedges his ladder between his mattress and the
bed frame."
Longer-term problems facing the suites may in
clude a lack of social interaction between the houses.
The eating clubs, rather than the residences, will be
the centers of social activity for the suite members. As
resident assistant David Montgomery admitted,
"Within the residences there is a potential for isola
tion," but he said, "if you have energetic people in the
eating clubs who want to create new communities it
won't be a problem."

Some concern has also hern raised over the con
tinued upkeep of the expensive new area, which in
cludes the Eliot Program Center. Upkeep of the indi
vidual suites is the responsibility of the residents and
apparently the new furniture and fixtures provide an
incentive for them to do so. "What interests me is
how many more people are interested in using the
vacuum cleaner here than in the trailers," Montgom
ery said.
Upkeep of the eating clubs is mainly a student
responsibility, with Facilities Manager Glenn Carroll
providing occasional help and guidance. Carroll's de
partment provides custodial services in Eliot Prog
ram Center, but after large social functions students
are "typically expected to help out," Carroll
explained.
However, even with the problems, most suite resi
dents say they would not want to give up their new
home.
"They're great," sophomore Scott Sather said.
"The few functional disorders are easy to cope with
when you realize that they got the work done, and got
us moved in as they promised."
Regarding the students' handling of the problems.
Van Houten noted,' 'The students have been asked to
put up with a certain amount of shakedown . . . and
they have been most impressive and most com
plimentary, I think."
