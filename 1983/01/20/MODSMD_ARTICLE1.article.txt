Native Americans blast Watt

Students and administrators met yesterday in the
Native American Cultural Center to respond to
Interior Secretary Watt's comment that Indian re
servations were an "example of the failures of

socialism." Participants in the news conference ar
gued that the current state of affairs is a result of
"federal despotism" and not some defect in the Na
tive American culture.
