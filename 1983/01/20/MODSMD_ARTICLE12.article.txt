## The 						Stanford Daily Tuition is the cost of education 
### 
The annual cost of attending the University is
more often than not treated as the black sheep of
the Stanford family of "experiences." It isn't that
people are outraged about tuition increases any
more (though that may be true as well) so much as
aggressively apathetic — the subject is generally
ignored, and it is seen as indelicate to raise fiscal
questions while sitting down at Chez Dorm for
dinner. The pocketbook doesn't hurt as much
when you don't talk about it, perhaps.
But before complaining too strongly about the
apathy of the student body toward financial mat
ters, one should understand the very real motiva
tions behind this hiding of tuition fees like 24-karat
skeletons in the closet. For roughly two-thirds of
the students at the University, an increase in tui
tion means only an increase in financial aid —
possibly annoying, to be sure, and even dangerous
in the case of loans, but still not a real burden to
those at a University committed to providing fi
nancial assistance. And for those both with and
without aid, the perceptions may be along the lines
of "Well, what can I do?" The rules of the game
dictate that one is to get in, spend four or five years
of academic and economic hardship, and get out so
another batch can play. Not much of a chance for
lasting impacts there.
Maybe that's why last week, when a tuition
forum was held in Dinkelspiel Auditorium with
top University administrators like University Pres
ident Donald Kennedy and Raymond Bacchetti,
director of University budgets, only 50 students
showed up. For those of you still counting Johnny's
apples, Dinkelspiel Auditorium holds 700 people.
Something was missing, and it looks like that some
thing was participation.
Fortunately, and to their credit, the University
representatives understand that the low atten
dance at the forum does not imply that students are
satisfied with the trends of recent tuition increases.
There are many reasons to be dissatisfied, some of
which the University fails to recognize and, indeed,
incorporates into its defense of budgetary issues.

For example, most folks remember (rather pain
fully so) the tuition hikes of the past few years in
percentages — as in, "inflation plus 6 percent."
But it's never been really explained why any in
crease beyond inflation is needed, especially since
percentage points are being trimmed from de
partment budgets all over campus. We can try to
reason why — our best guess has something to do
with research costs, rates of salary and energy cost
increase, increased financial aid and the like — but
we can't tell for sure. That is what we need
explained at a tuition forum, more than compari
sons with costs at Ivy League universities.
More disturbing, and even more ingrained in the
collective University consciousness, is the idea of
breaking the budget news with the estimated
salaries of current Stanford graduates. For in
stance, Bacchetti watered down the scary estimate
of $180,000 for four years of University study
around the year 2000 by mentioning that the aver
age 1983 graduate will be making roughly
$100,000 a year by then. That sounds great to
these ears, but what if bread is also $50 a loaf, and
gasoline totally unavailable?
The closest the University has come to that ques
tion is in tying its increases in tuition to the increas
ing income of students' parents. But that too is
uncomfortable, because it ignores the income of
the applicant pool in favor of those accepted. The
whole idea of financial aid at the University is to
make cost less of an obstacle to low-income
families — those not in the professional/
managerial tract that the University assumes its
graduates will follow. This discrepancy hints at a
larger inconsistency in reasoning — an inconsis
tency that will have to be considered if we are ever
to hold the line on tuition. Whether the Stanford
experience costs $180,000, an arm or a leg or your
first-born, the University — and that includes us,
as transient but involved students — must do what
it can to keep the costs of higher education from
being a cost to that education.
