## They're killing people, not Leftists 
### 
I know a beautiful place to go at
night when I feel like being alone.
Maybe you haven't been there, but you
may be near there every day — I'm
talking about that lovely little plaza
near Hoover Tower. If you haven't
walked through it or sat and watched
the fountain, I highly recommend it.
In between the two main buildings,
with their neo-Greco pillars, there are
two other friendly buildings that might
be conference or dining rooms of some
kind. There is a recessed area between
the smaller, pseudo-Oriental styled
places where an unenthusiastic foun
tain bubbles until the early evening.
There is also a huge cross section of an
ancient redwood that seems to have all
the important dates marked on it —
you know, things like "Emancipation
Proclamation," "France donates
Statue of Liberty," "Marshall Plan set
into effect." At night some trees are
lighted from underneath by white and
green spotlights, making a wonderfully
romantic setting. It's quite a different
world from the campus that we cruise
through on our 10-speeds.
I have overheard someone say that
the people in the Hoover Institution
don't like Stanford students hanging
around their area, and many of us hear,

and complain, that the organization
(devoted to peace as we read before
entering the elevator that goes to the
top of the tower: "The purpose of this
institution is to promote peace. Its re
cords stand as a challenge to those who
promote war, they should attract those
who search for peace. I therefore dedi
cate this building to those purposes."
June, 20, 1940. Herbert Hoover.) is
involved in foreign affairs decisions.
I went there last Sunday night to sit
for a while by the fountain, look at the
green and white trees and think for a
while. I had just seen Missing with
some friends from Cardenal, and I
didn't feel content to just walk past that
silent place as I was leaving Memorial
Auditorium.
You may think there's a bit of irony
in the fact that Missing is shown 200
feet away from that mysterious place. I
do too. Most of what I felt was confu
sion — what to think, how to react.
Maybe you felt that way as well. We
saw a film that told us people (as op
posed to Leftists, Communists, El Sal
vadoians), people are being killed so
you and I can sit back obliviously to it
all and drink Coca-Cola, or do what
ever our free hearts desire. We listened
to a movie that claims to be an accurate

portrayal of a contemporary reality (as
opposed to some hopeless history in
black and white of the Holocaust)
where an American was murdered to
protect Americans. He was buried in a
wall. He reminded me a little of myself,
except that he was far away, and I was
sitting by a fountain, surrounded by
pretty buildings.
That "documentary" said American
corporations have strong interests in
Latin America and that our direct in
volvement in the military coup d'etat in
Chile is a simple necessity if we are to
have such nice, comfortable lives, con
centrating on arts and sciences or
whatever else turns us on.
"We can't have both," was one dip
lomat's justification. I don't like
catagorizing people as imbeciles, but I
suppose that the character meant: we
can't have our middle-class lives and
treat other nations as if they were com
posed of people, not just factions.
The movie scared me and I want to
know more about it. If this is still going
on, can we get our politicians to talk
about it? How do we stop it?
Maybe that romantic little spot is a
nice place for a rally.
