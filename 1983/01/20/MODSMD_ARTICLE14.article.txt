## Editorial on Stanford Hospital health care simplified its role 
### 
The recent editorial on "Private care
for privileged" (Daily, Jan. 13) addres
sed important issues in the current
reorganization of health care cost dis
tribution, but I believe it weakened its
message by making unwarranted as
sumptions.
The loss of the Medi-Cal contract
and its effect on Stanford's "reputa
tion" are not germane. Stanford enjoys
a national reputation as a foremost re
search institute, and criticism about its
patient make-up very likely has little
effect upon the policies which encour
age research here. Stanford has little
lack of the experimental resources it
requires. The proper forum for criti
cism of the decision on Medi-Cal is that
of public policy and overall health con
cerns, both in the community and on
the national level.
It seems that the point of the edito
rial concerns differing standards of
health care. I do not believe that we can
say the Medically Indigent Adults legis
lation has, "in one bureaucratic swipe"
acted to segregate medical treatment
along lines of wealth. Segregation ac
cording to funding has existed all along,
in the sense that some hospitals have
always had more money to spend than
others. Because a certain group of
people unable to pay may not now
utilize the (non-emergency) services of

Stanford does not necessarily mean
that they are no longer receiving
"proper medical care."
In the first place, "proper medical
care" is an ambiguous term which in
volves a host of assumptions. It re
quires a careful and philosophical con
sideration of just what society is mor
ally obligated to provide to its members
in the way of health care. Such a defini
tion is far from established and is being
debated right now on an international
level. In the second place, the fine re
search institute that is Stanford by no
means claims to be the best place for
everyone, poor or rich, to receive med
ical treatment. Hospitals, like univer
sities, have strengths and weaknesses;
honest people in an institution will
readily admit to them.
The issues are complex and far
reaching, and we must strive to keep
the complexity alive in our thoughts.
Simplification and "sloganization" do
not lead to solutions; they lead to a
rabble-rousing atmosphere which can
surround an issue and prevent reason
able peoples' voices being heard. Let us
not hastily jump on the social
services-budget-cuts bandwagon and
decry the filthy rich people who are
snatching health itself from the hapless

poor. There is more to the problem
than that.

Revolutions happen
In response to Jan Boyer's recent
column ("Revolution no solution in R
S A," Jan. 14, Daily), it appears that
history is no longer a requirement for
international relations majors and I
will give a brief account of some perti
nent facts.
When the American colonists be
came fed up with England's taxation
and policies, fighting ensued, and thus
the American Revolution was born.
Likewise, within Russia the peasants
suffering under Czarist rule became the
Russian Revolution. The Chinese
booted the British out after years of
abuse, and thus ensued the Chinese
Revolution. As documented by his
tory, revolution has solved a few prob
lems in its day.
If black South Africans do not
benefit from efforts by the black inter
national community aimed at isolating
white South Africans economically and
politically from the rest of the world (a

peaceful process so far), then what be
nefits are black South Africans to gain
from the "new constitution" drafted by
Prime Minister P.W. Botha. If
ideologies will not bring food, shelter,
care and security until sometime in the
future as pointed out in your column,
then when are we to see the improve
ments under Botha's plan? Next week,
next year or sometime in the future? I
hardly think a future high paying job
will make up for the murders, incarcer
ations, harassments and degradation
suffered by my brothers and sisters in
their homeland.
Which brings me to another bone I
would like to pick with Boyer. By
suggesting that "we" should give the
"young black South Africans" the op
portunity to travel abroad and experi
ence living in a "just multi-racial soci
ety" for a "limited period of time"
Boyer is implying that it is the fault of
black South Africans that the racist re
gime exists. Well, if so, then let black
South Africans correct the problem as
seen fit.
The only reason for keeping this re
sponse short is so others will have room
in this paper to take Boyer's faulty as
sumptions and tear them to pieces.
