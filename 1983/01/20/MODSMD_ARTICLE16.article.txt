## Of a columnist and his endings 
### 
Dora, a committed revolutionary,
states at the end of Albert Camus' play,
The Just Assasins: "No! We must go on
and on and on. How good it would be to
rest a bit! But that's impossible. Some
times one wants to let oneself relax and
take things easy. But that foul thing
injustice sticks to us like a leech . ..
Human beings, human faces — that's
what we'd like to love. To be in love
with love instead of justice."
What can any of us say at the end?
We can keep making ourselves clearer
and clearer. I can try to further explain
the difference between the surface and
the reality, between the political and
the literary, the almost irreconcilable
difference between a class in Interna
tional Political Economy and a class in
Albert Camus. Yet, many of us learn
both and accept both into our lives.
I could write much more about the
American Dream, an entire year of
columns. This time, I could comment
on the implications of the conclusion of
the Los Angeles Times' article on the
death of underworld figure Meyer
Lansky: "a man of reason, a man of
violence, one of the century's most avid
seekers of the American Dream."
I could become enraged to the point
of irrationality at the ignorance ©fPcesr
ident Reagan, at the continuing blind
ness to desperation and poverty, at the
repressive, hypocritical foreign policy
of my own humanitarian nation.
Or I could talk a bit about the absur
dity of the absurd, how only those who
understand and face it are truly free
men.
But what do we really do in the end,
except run out of time? I ran out of time
and I must answer all the questions
now. What finally makes a difference?
After all the expression, after all the
perspectives, how can I possibly hope
to find a last word or a last few words?
How can 1 hope to say anything when I
am forced to reach a firm conclusion,
when I must be completely satisfied
with what I say?
In the end, I feel that everything I've
written could have been more mean
ingful if it had been something else. I
keep thinking that I should have talked
about important current issues. But I
could not. My plan was to cover every
thing; it was beyond politics, beyond
culture. It was beyond contemporary
world affairs.
On the other hand, the only time I
was sure of anything was in the very
first piece, even before my first official
column. I stated vehemently and I tried
to prove that the judiciary must be in
dependent, more specifically even, that
three California judges should not be
recalled. I could have stuck to that ap

proach. I could have been sure of many
things then. I could have asserted ail
my deep-seated views. I wouldn't be
contused right now. Gun control, arms
control, the death penalty, gasoline
taxes — they aren't confusing.
I could have written better and I
could have written not as well. I could
be happier and I could be unhappier.
And I could have definitely written one
more column; the column I did not
write is, in the end, the most important.
It would have been a marvelous
work. I would have brought in films
and music, politics and philosophy. I
would have started slowly, but
strongly, developed a logical,
evidence-ridden argument, and pro
ceeded to a grand, eternal finale. I
would have searched for the perfect
truth and you would have found it un
expectedly one Thursday morning on
page four of the Daily.

The final choice I offered so many weeks ago in
that first column is between the traditional,
meaningless grand finale so common on the
stage or a quiet ending where everybody just goes
home, where everybody just stops reading.

I would have much more to re
member now, more than just the neat
device of a split personality, more than
just a glorious, awful weekend at the
end of October, more than just a so
cially devastating album or a cute set of
predictions for the coming year rattled
off in a half-nour.
I would be able to point to something
permanent and valuable, something
that was crafted out of love and tears,
something that was special.
Everything should build to a grand
finale. I'm still looking for the perfect
end as I write on. But I feel it is behind
me, in the things I forgot to say or could
not say, in the things I have not been
able to do and the things I may never be
able to do.
For, in the end, it may be as it was on
the long forgotten bulletin board of my
junior high school: the saying of the
week, the only one I can still re
member. "After all is said and done,
there is a lot more said than done."
The question "What makes a differ
ence?" must be answered with actions,
but all I can do here is keep saying.
We must act to be happy. I don't
know if I have ever been happy when I
have been alone, thinking, or even

thinking and writing these columns. 1
also can't believe that I've done anyone
any good during these periods of
thought. I've probably found more
happiness and done more good in one
simple conversation.
The search must end, or at least be
put aside — no great truths, no perfect
acts, no grand finale. The final choice 1
promised so many weeks ago in that
first column is between the traditional,
meaningless grand finale so common
on the stage or a quiet ending where
everybody just goes home, where
everybody just stops reading.
The thinking stops, the action stops,
the futile search for the perfect act or
truth ends, and as the stage clears two
people are alone or maybe three or.
four. They talk; they laugh. They love
each other; they trust each other. They
are content. Everyone may very well go
home unsatisfied. There isn't much of a

show; there isn't much art. But, in the
end, only if the love of love, human and
temporal love, overwhelms or at least
controls the love of justice or perfec
tion can there be any happiness.
And when at some time we may be
ready to do more, we must fight against
the obvious wrongs that are so preva
lent instead of searching for the proper
universal feelings of truth. We are sim
ply inadequate for anything beyond
this. No one can say put all your faith in
the divine. No one can say you must
despair of the terrible reality to find
hope again, and no one can say that you
must be blind to be happy.
In the end, the second me who sees
the truth does not really, and the first
me who is blind and happy is not really.
They are constantly a part of one per
son. They are within us all, all of the
time, and together they struggle to do
the best that they can.
"The time is gone, the song is over.
Thought I'd something more to say." I
don't know if anyone can feel any other
way, in the end.

English. This was his last column.)
