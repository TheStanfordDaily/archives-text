## Gandhi: Attenborough's intentions are not enough 
### STEVE VINEBERG 
Richard Attenborough, the
director of Gandhi, is clearly a
sensitive, intelligent man whose
choice of movie subjects reflects
a legitimate concern with some
of the most provocative issues of
our century. His first film, Oh!
What a Lovely War, and his sec
ond, A Bridge Too Far, dealt
with the futility of war; for his
third he has selected as his hero a
figure who altered modern man's
evaluation of the power of the
individual will for benevolent
purposes — so much so that he
cannot be considered without
reverence. Unfortunately, At
tenborough's salient characteris
tic as a director is his good inten
tions. Gandhi is his third epic in a
row, and though we might ad
mire his persistence, he just
doesn't have the right qualities
for this sort of filmmaking: visual
scope, a strong structural sense,
delineative narrative skills, a
feeling for drama. Gandhi is a
3V4-hour soporific.
A movie focused on a
saintlike protagonist runs a ter
rific risk of becoming mired in
goodness — which is not, after
all, an inherently dramatic trait.
The most logical manner of av
oiding this trap, it seems to me,
would be to concentrate on the
history exploding around Gan
dhi, but out of either a lack of
personal resources or an ascetic
(and perverse) refusal to vul
garize Gandhi's story, Atten
borough has resisted turning it
into theater. And in the process
of purifying it of historical lumps,
he has buried much essential fac
tual information and obfuscated
the issues. Title cards appear in
frequently, and when they do,
they are often infuriatingly
vague: "The Lieutenant Gover
nor's Mansion, Some Months
Later," for example, when we
want to know, what is this man
lieutenant governor of, and some
months later than when? The
first half ends with a dramatiza
tion of the Jallianwalla Bagh
massacre, an instance of British
colonial brutality so scandalous
that it remains one of the blac
kest marks on England's impe
rial record, but Attenborough
and his screenwriter, John

Briley, don't even identify the
location. And I'll bet that 90 per
cent of the people who
applauded Gandhi the night I
saw it couldn't explain why its
hero led his people on a drive to
make their own salt, or why the
establishment of Pakistanincited
a series of riots that even he,
whose control over the Indians
was so firm in other matters, had
extraordinary difficulty in calm
ing. (He almost starved himself
to death trying.) These incidents
are in the movie, but so little exp
lanation is offered that in order

to comprehend them, you have
to consult Ved Mehta's book
Mahatma Gandhi and His Apos
des or some other reliable biog
raphical source.
As it happens, Ben Kingsley,
the Anglo-Indian actor who
plays Gandhi, brings such a fas
cinating mixture of understated
passion and unpredictable wit to
the role that we end up grateful
that he is at the movie's center.
Kingsley, who has acted with the
Royal Shakespeare Company
(he appeared in the original
Nicholas Nickleby), humanizes
the icon Briley's homiletic
screenplay sets up; when we hear
him sing a snatch of a hymn
learned in childhood, or watch

him scamper across a bech or
stare through his glasses at his
dying wife (Rohini Hattangady)
like a sad-eyed owl, we think,
"Yes, such a man might have
existed." And creating a plausi
ble character out of all this virtue
must have been a nearly impos
sible assignment. If Briley truly
had the soul of a dramatist, he
would have included Gandhi's
stormy relationship with his re
bellious son, or even — though
this occurred in the period bet
ween 1893, when the movie's
chronology begins — the night
Gandhi made love to his preg
nant wife (considered by Hindus
an unclean act) and, told that his
father had died in the meantime,
blamed his own lust. (This inci
dent sparked Gandhi's repeated
vovrS of celibacy, which the film
introduces in a dumb, cutesy
scene in the second half.)
Attenborough weighs the
movie with famous actors: John
Gielgud, whose role is devised to
spotlight the famous Gielgudian
double take, Edward Fox as a
general, Trevor Howard as a
judge, Martin Sheen in knickers
and wire rims as a New York
Times reporter, Candice Bergen
as a Life reporter (with the most
unsayable line in the script, to
Gandhi's wife: "Does it rankle,
being separated like this?"), and
lan Charleson, Michael Hor
dern, John Mills, etc. Most of
them give the slightly condes
cending star cameos invited by
huge, shapeless period pictures
like this one, and at least a few of
them seem as bewildered as we
are about whom they're playing.
(Half of the characters are not
introduced by name.) The only
actor in the film is Ben Kingsley,
anyway; all these stars are just
expensive dressing, like the hun
dreds of extras in Gandhi's fun
eral procession, which is shot
from the air to make it look espe
cially impressive. Watching this
sequence, I knew what I was
supposed to be feeling — an
overwhelming sense of the im
portance of this man's life, and of
the movie Richard Atten
borough has made of that life —
but I couldn't keep my mind off
the logistics of setting up a shot
encompassing so much area, and
then rehearsing all those extras.

Of course, I felt guilty after
wards, as though Td cut civics
class.

Since Yoda and E.T. are two
of my favorite figures in the
movies of the past few years, I
looked eagerly forward to The
Dark Crystal, which was co
directed by Muppet masters Jim
Henson and Frank Oz. But it
turns out to be a disappointment.
The fantasy plot — apocalyptic,
like most fantasy is (Tolkien's,
C.S. Lewis's, Richard Wagner's)
— concerns the efforts of Jen, a
"gelfling," to recover the lost
shard of an indigo-colored crys
tal that determines the power of
whoever possesses it, and thus
free the land from the tyranny of
the dreaded Skeksis. I didn't
mind all the steals from Norse
mythology by way of Tolkien,
and from The Wizard of Oz
(there's even a bit from The Pic
ture of Dorian Gray), but the
movie lacks the requisite magical
dimension, and so it droops.
Some of the creatures Brian
Froud has designed are wonder
ful to watch — the slimy-beaked,
skeleton-clawed Skeksis look
like villains from Lord of the
Rings as John Tenniel might
have imagined them, and the
keeper of the crystal sliver, obs
tinate, ill-tempered Aughra, is
Miss Havisham conceived as a
Jabberwock. And Henson and
Oz have included an uproarious
Skeksis banquet that might be
described as reptilian baroque.
But the good guys have been
constructed much less imagina
tively than the monsters: the
Druid-like Mystics (the Skeksis'
opposite number) are a little
draggy, and the pair of gelfling
mates have as little spark as the
lovers in Dragonslayer. The
Dark Crystal could have used
Dragonslayer's photographer,
Derek Vanlint, though — the ac
tion sequences and the major set
pieces seem visually insubstan
tial. Henson wrote the story
(which David Odell
dramatized), and it contains
enough seductive ideas for a
first-rate fantasy, but they must
have fizzled into banality some
where between the drawing
board and the editing room.
