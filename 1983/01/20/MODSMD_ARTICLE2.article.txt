Output declines sharply in '82
Washington — Reflecting the severity of the recession, the nation's eco
nomic output fell 1.8 percent in 1982, the sharpest drop in 36 years, the De
partment of Commerce said Tuesday. The drop in the last three months of
1982 was at an annual rate of 2.5 percent.
The department attributed the economy's poor performance in the Octo
ber-through-December period chiefly to sagging manufacturing production
— particularly in the automobile industry — and weak export sales.
Secretary of Commerce Malcolm Baldrigesaid, however, that signs of im
provement in auto production and housing construction are evidence that
"recovery is beginning" in the first quarter of the new year.
Although the rebound is "likely to be moderate," he said, unemployment
fall to 10 percent from the current post-Depression high of 10.8 per
cent by the end of the year, while inflation continues to moderate.
"In short, while not all of the main economic sectors are yet signaling 'go,'
enough are picking up to indicate that this quarter will be the first quarter of
recovery," he said at a news conference called to discuss his department's
latest report on the gross national product — the economy's total output of
goods and services.
At the White House, the tone was equally upbeat. "We fully expect the
GN P will show steady improvement in the coming year," deputy press secre
tary Larry Speakes told reporters.
Some private economists shared the administration's optimistic outlook.
"It looks like we are very near the turning point," said Michael Evans,
president of the private consulting firm of Evans Economics. But he said the
recovery could be the weakest of any rebound from a recession in the post-
World War II period.
China retaliates against U.S. textile curbs
Peking — China retaliated yesterday against new U.S. import restrictions
on Chinese textiles bv barring any new contracts to buy American cotton,
chemical fibers and soybeans.
The U.S. Embassy refused comment on the Chinese action, which is ex
pected to complicate Secretary of State George Shultz's talks with officials in
Peking beginning Feb. 2.
Shultz faced Chinese complaints over the Reagan administration's arms
sales to Taiwan, slowness in providing U.S. technology to China and accep
tance of of political defectors from China.
On its side, the United States is reportedly concerned about recent Chinese
diplomatic overtures towards the Soviet Union.
Since trade contracts are negotiated in advance, it was not clear how
quickly the Chinese embargo would affect U.S. trade.
Sales of American cotton, soybeans and chemical fibers were slumping in
1982. China has sharply expanded its own cotton production and shifted
most of its purchases away from the United States.
However, the two-paragraph announcement by the official Xinhua news
agency said China also planned to reduce imports of other American agricul
tural products.
It did not specify which ones. Wheat is the largest single agricultural trade
item between the United States and China, which has agreed to buy at least 6
million ton's of the grain annually.
Last week the Reagan administration announced it would limit Chinese
textile imports to their current $700 million level after a fourth round of talks
failed to produce a new trade agreement to replace one that expired on Dec.
31, 1982.
Japenese prime minister receives kudos
Washington — Japan's new prime minister, Yasuhiro Nakasone, won
praise for his initial actions yesterday at the White House and on Capitol
Hill, but in both places he heard requests for stronger and more effective
initiatives in the months ahead.
Saying a public farewell on the White House grounds after an intimate
family breakfast. President Reagan praised Nakasone's commitments to
open Japanese markets to a greater degree, and said the two leaders' con
sultations this week "have made some imprint on the first steps in the area of
trade."
Reagan was not specific, but a White House briefer said there had been no
talk between the two men of a new Japanese export quota on automobiles,
and that discussions of U.S. beef and citrus shipments to Japan are still at an
impasse. The president asked for "tangible progress" in removing obstacles
to U.S. exports in order for Japan to prove its "good intentions."
On Capitol Hill, Nakasone was praised by Senate Majority Leader How
ard Baker (R-Tenn.) for efforts to ease trade restrictions, increase defense
spending, share military technology with the United States and repair
Japan's relations with South Korea.
But Baker went on to say, at a luncheon for Nakasone, that "there is much
that remains to be done before it can be said we are truly working in concert
to overcome the difficulties we face and the threats that confront us."
U.S. to maintain position in Geneva talks
Washington — The Reagan administration said yesterday that Paul Nitze,
chief negotiator at the Geneva talks aimed at limiting midrange nuclear
weapons in Europe, will carry no new American proposals when he returns
there next week for another round of talks.
