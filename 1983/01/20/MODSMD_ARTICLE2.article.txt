Output declines sharply in '82
Washington — Reflecting the severity of the recession, the nation's eco
nomic output fell 1.8 percent in 1982, the sharpest drop in 36 years, the De
partment of Commerce said Tuesday. The drop in the last three months of
1982 was at an annual rate of 2.5 percent.
The department attributed the economy's poor performance in the Octo
ber-through-December period chiefly to sagging manufacturing production
— particularly in the automobile industry — and weak export sales.
Secretary of Commerce Malcolm Baldrigesaid, however, that signs of im
provement in auto production and housing construction are evidence that
"recovery is beginning" in the first quarter of the new year.
Although the rebound is "likely to be moderate," he said, unemployment
fall to 10 percent from the current post-Depression high of 10.8 per
cent by the end of the year, while inflation continues to moderate.
"In short, while not all of the main economic sectors are yet signaling 'go,'
enough are picking up to indicate that this quarter will be the first quarter of
recovery," he said at a news conference called to discuss his department's
latest report on the gross national product — the economy's total output of
goods and services.
At the White House, the tone was equally upbeat. "We fully expect the
GN P will show steady improvement in the coming year," deputy press secre
tary Larry Speakes told reporters.
Some private economists shared the administration's optimistic outlook.
"It looks like we are very near the turning point," said Michael Evans,
president of the private consulting firm of Evans Economics. But he said the
recovery could be the weakest of any rebound from a recession in the post-
World War II period.
China retaliates against U.S. textile curbs
Peking — China retaliated yesterday against new U.S. import restrictions
on Chinese textiles bv barring any new contracts to buy American cotton,
chemical fibers and soybeans.
The U.S. Embassy refused comment on the Chinese action, which is ex
pected to complicate Secretary of State George Shultz's talks with officials in
Peking beginning Feb. 2.
Shultz faced Chinese complaints over the Reagan administration's arms
sales to Taiwan, slowness in providing U.S. technology to China and accep
tance of of political defectors from China.
On its side, the United States is reportedly concerned about recent Chinese
diplomatic overtures towards the Soviet Union.
Since trade contracts are negotiated in advance, it was not clear how
quickly the Chinese embargo would affect U.S. trade.
Sales of American cotton, soybeans and chemical fibers were slumping in
1982. China has sharply expanded its own cotton production and shifted
most of its purchases away from the United States.
However, the two-paragraph announcement by the official Xinhua news
agency said China also planned to reduce imports of other American agricul
tural products.
It did not specify which ones. Wheat is the largest single agricultural trade
item between the United States and China, which has agreed to buy at least 6
million ton's of the grain annually.
Last week the Reagan administration announced it would limit Chinese
textile imports to their current $700 million level after a fourth round of talks
failed to produce a new trade agreement to replace one that expired on Dec.
31, 1982.
Japenese prime minister receives kudos
Washington — Japan's new prime minister, Yasuhiro Nakasone, won
praise for his initial actions yesterday at the White House and on Capitol
Hill, but in both places he heard requests for stronger and more effective
initiatives in the months ahead.
Saying a public farewell on the White House grounds after an intimate
family breakfast. President Reagan praised Nakasone's commitments to
open Japanese markets to a greater degree, and said the two leaders' con
sultations this week "have made some imprint on the first steps in the area of
trade."
Reagan was not specific, but a White House briefer said there had been no
talk between the two men of a new Japanese export quota on automobiles,
and that discussions of U.S. beef and citrus shipments to Japan are still at an
impasse. The president asked for "tangible progress" in removing obstacles
to U.S. exports in order for Japan to prove its "good intentions."
On Capitol Hill, Nakasone was praised by Senate Majority Leader How
ard Baker (R-Tenn.) for efforts to ease trade restrictions, increase defense
spending, share military technology with the United States and repair
Japan's relations with South Korea.
But Baker went on to say, at a luncheon for Nakasone, that "there is much
that remains to be done before it can be said we are truly working in concert
to overcome the difficulties we face and the threats that confront us."
U.S. to maintain position in Geneva talks
Washington — The Reagan administration said yesterday that Paul Nitze,
chief negotiator at the Geneva talks aimed at limiting midrange nuclear
weapons in Europe, will carry no new American proposals when he returns
there next week for another round of talks.
State Department spokesman John Hughes ad
dressed the issue for the second time in two days.
He repeated the administration position that Nitzc
"has always been authorized to explore any flex
ibility in the Soviet position" — but has been in
structed to return to Geneva Jan. 27 with the Unit
ed States' "zero option" proposal unchanged.
The zero option plan was first offered by Presi
dent Reagan in a speech Nov. 18,1981. It proposed
that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
would forgo deployment of 464 cruise missiles and
1 08 upgraded Pershing 2 ballistic missiles if the So
viets agreed to dismantle the estimated 333 triple
warhead SS-20s now deployed against West Eu
rope and China. Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei
Gromvko repeated in Bonn Tuesday that the Sovi
et Union has "completely ruled out" the zero op
tion.
Nitze has been reported to have urged that the
administration prepare a fallback position. This
would be based on the expectation that the Soviets
would never accept the zero option and that the
Europeans would never muster the political will to
deploy the missiles if the United States does not
soon show some willingness to compromise.
In an interview by NBC News Tuesday night,
Nitze said he completelv supports the zero option
concept. But he added that he is "confident that if
it becomes wise for the U.S. government to change
its position it will, in fact, so do."
"1 am empowered to pursue every avenue in ex
ploring possibilities of change in the Soviet posi
tion," he added. Earlier, in a statement issued by a
spokesman for the Arms Control and Disarma
ment Agency, Nitze said: "I am completely satis
fied with the flexibility I have as a U.S. nego
tiator."
Israel to keep troops in Lebanon
Jerusalem — Foreign Minister Yitzhak Shamir
said yesterday that Israel will not withdraw its
troops from Lebanon unless the Beirut govern
ment agrees to the establishment of early-warning
stations manned by Israeli soldiers in southern
Lebanon.
Shamir said that the stations, designed to detect
infiltration of Palestinian guerrillas into the region
north of the Israeli border, were an integral part of
the security guarantees that Israel is demanding as
the price for evacuating its army.
Withdrawal of Israeli forces will not start,
Shamir said, until a security agreement is signed
and Syrian and Palestine Liberation Organization
forces have also agreed to leave.
In an interview with Israel Radio, Shamir in
sisted that Israel will not drop the demand for ear
ly-warning stations or agree to any compromise re
garding it.
If Israel is as adamant on the point as Shamir
contends, it could result in long and drawn-out
talks between Israel and Lebanon. Negotiations
involving the two countries and the United States
are being held twice a week and are scheduled to

resume Thursday in the Israeli border town of
Kirvat Shemona.
It was understood that Lebanon flatly rejected
the proposal for Israeli-operated military outposts
on its territory when the Israelis raised the issue in
an earlier round of talks.
Two Israeli newspapers, the independent and
often anti-government Haaretz and the pro-gov
ernment Yediot Aharonot, reported Wednesday
before Shamir's interview that U.S. special envoy
Philip Habib had suggested that American troops
operate the early-warning stations.
Both newspapers said that Israel is likely to ac
cept the compromise, something that Shamir flatly
denied.
Lebanon is reportedly far from enthusiastic
about having stations on its territory at all, no mat
ter who operates them. However, the Lebanese ap
pear to be prepared to compromise if such stations
were to be manned by Americans or troops of the
U.S.-French-Italian force on duty in and around
Beirut.
Soviet satellite falling quicker
Washington — The crippled, nuclear-powered
Soviet space surveillance satellite is now losing
altitude so fast that it could fall out of orbit, burn
up in the atmosphere and spew radioactive debris
anywhere over inhabited parts of Earth as early as
this weekend.
Pentagon sources said that the descending per
igee, the low point of an eccentric orbit, of Cosmos
1402 fell 4.5 miles on Tuesday and another 4.5
miles yesterday, bringing it 117 miles from Earth
on its closest approach.
Satellites fall out of orbit and burn up in the
Earth's atmosphere when their perigees fall to an
altitude of about 105 miles, which is in the up
permost reaches of the atmosphere and close
enough for the growing pull of gravity to draw it to
Earth.
Launched from the Cosmodrome near Leninsk
last Aug. 30, the satellite is powered by a small nu
clear reactor fueled by 110 pounds of uranium
isotope U-235, the fuel used in atomic submarines
and to make atomic bombs.
Of most concern is not the uranium fuel but
poisonously radioactive isotopes such as stron
tium-90 and cesium-137, which are products of fis
sioning uranium and emit deadly gamma radiation
for thousands of years. The uranium-fueled reac
tor was turned on the day Cosmos 1402 flew into
orbit more than four months ago.
The Soviets turned off the reactor last Dec. 28, a
day or two after radio signals beamed from the
Earth caused the satellite to separate into two
parts.
This signaled U.S. space watchers that the Sovi
ets were about to fire an engine remotely on the sec
tion that houses the reactor in an attempt to propel
it into an orbit so high that it would stay there for at
least 1000 years. The same maneuver has been per
formed on more than 20 other Soviet nuclear-pow
ered satellites.

This time, the maneuver failed, either because
the satellite's engine failed completely or because it
fired so erratically that it caused the satellite to be
gin tumbling out of orbit instead of boosting it into
a higher orbit.
Elections split German coalition
Bonn — Election pressures are opening up seri
ous fissures between West Germany's governing
coalition partners over the key campaign issues of
missile deployment and economic policies.
As Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko
departed yesterday after a three-day visit, it be
came evident that a tactical breach still divided the
Christian Democrats and their junior partner, the
Free Democrats, over the best way to nurture an
agreement between Moscow and Wasington that
would restrict or eliminate medium-range nuclear
missiles from Europe.
The Christian Democratic chancellor, Helmut
Kohl, stressed to Gromyko that the Bonn govern
ment held a "firm, clear position" in favor of Presi
dent Reagan's "zero solution" that would cancel
deployment of 572 Pershing II and cruise missiles if
the Soviet Union dismantles some 600 or more nu
clear-tipped rockets targeted on western Europe.
But the Free Democrats' leader, Foreign Min
ister Hans Dietrich Genscher, is now calling for
"an interim solution" that would keep the missile
count low on both sides if the ultimate goal of total
elimination could not be achieved this year.
In a radio interview yesterday, Genscher argued
that a shift away from the zero option should be
undertaken if the Soviet Union showed signs of re
ciprocal compromise. Genscher's views were
backed by Jurgen Moellemann, a Free Democrat
foreign affairs specialist, who said an "all or noth
ing" approach on the missiles could not be ac
cepted and the West must prepare for "an interim
solution."
As the parties here scramble for votes in the up
coming March election, the missile debate has be
come motivated more than ever by political con
siderations.
Stocks continue to decline
Stock prices tumbled yesterday, extending the
decline that set in Tuesday.
Analysts said a rise in open-market interest rates
helped touch off the selling.
Some of the markets' recent strength has been
attributed to speculation that the Federal Reserve
would soon cut the discount rate, which now
stands at BV2 percent. But no reduction has been
made to date.
Today's weather
Fair, with highs in the 50s. Light winds. Tonight
increasing clouds becoming mostly cloudy tomor
row. Lows in the upper 30s and 40s. Highs in the
50s.
