# idiosyncratic Wall of Voodoo doesn't catch on
## 
### MIKE HALE 
I The only bad thing about
Ding to a Wall of Voodoo con
ert is explaining to people be
jrehand exactly what it is you' re
oing to see. By the time you've
Dnvinced someone it won't in
olve dolls and dead chickens,
filing them about the songs isn't
rorth the aggravation.
The band doesn't help much.
Mexican Radio," the closest
lung to a radio hit they've had
et, seems to have been deliber
tely sabotaged: not only was it a
2-inch single, but the flip side
/as a short exercise in self-

indulgence called "There's No
thing On This Side," which con
sisted of snippets of "Mexican
Radio," feedback passages and
people saying "There's nothing
on this side." It's rumored that
the band members are indepen
dently wealthy — they're either
that, or full of integrity, or not
very bright.
Despite all this, Wall of Voo
doo seems to be on the verge of
edging into the spotlight. Their
concert this past weekend at San
Francisco's Kabuki Nightclub
sold out, and the Kabuki is a big
place — it looks like the sort of

nightclub that otherwise exists
only in '30s movies, with lots of
tables for the Nicholas Brothers
to dance across — and quite a
few people seem to have man
aged to get past the band's sur
face strangeness to an apprecia
tion of their music (or else the
image itself is catching on).
The music, available so far on
two albums (Dark Continent and
Call of the West) and an EP, isn't
quite like anything else you've
heard (really). For one thing, the
band has been heavily influenced
by country music and TV west
erns of the '50s and '60s, and old

Western movies — a riff will pop
up that's been borrowed (con
sciously or not) from "Death
Valley Days," or Hank Williams.
The group does their own ver
sion of Johnny Cash's "Ring of
Fire," and Saturday rehearsed
Jimmy Dean's "Big Bad John"
during the sound check (but,
wisely, didn't play it during the
show).
Not only does the music sound
like it could be the soundtrack
for a new wave Western, but the
songs are about the American
West, too. Call of the West is ac
tually a coherent and quite liter
ate "concept" album, the sort of
thing American bands aren't
supposed to be doing these days.
They don't say anything particu
larly new — the album is about
the West as last outpost of the
American dream, and its failure
to live up to people's hopes for it
— but what they say, they say
very well.
There's also an ominous qual
ity to Wall of Voodoo's sound —
their records can be unsettling
when heard alone, late at night.
This is due partly to their use of a
rhythm machine, which sets up a
loud, monotonous, hollow beat
that doesn't change as the band
members play with, and off of, it;
the band goes for a kind of Phil
Spector, wall-of-sound effect,
leaving rhythm to the machine
and layering synthesizers, guitar
and percussion around the beat.
And it's due partly to lead voc

alist Stanard Ridgway. Ridgway
doesn't sing all that well, and he
has a very strange voice: it, too,
sounds like it's coming from a
machine, a rather self-conscious
machine that isn't comfortable
on stage.
The ominousness and the
country touches combine for a
compelling sound. On stage,
Wall of Voodoo can't really re
plicate this, at least not in a place
the size of the Kabuki. Their
songs sound campy in front of an
audience, and as if in realization
of this Ridgway and drummer
Joe Nanini do an inordinate
amount of joking and playing to
the audience. It was an enjoyable
show, but so far Wall of Voodoo
hasn't learned to be as good on
stage as they are on record.
Chrome Dinette, one of Voo
doo's opening acts, provided an
educational contrast. Chrome
Dinette isn't a good band —
they're muddy and unoriginal —
but they're slick, and the crowd
responded. Sounding one mo
ment like the Police without a
lead guitar, the next like a heavy
metal Men at Work, Chrome
Dinette generated more excite
ment than Wall of Voodoo.
Perhaps it was because Chrome
Dinette is a San Francisco band,
but it's likely that if Wall of Voo
doo smoothed up their ap
proach, they'd have hit it big a
few years ba£k. Chrome Dinette
may be in the Top 40 any day
now.
