Elements is pianist Ira
Stein's and oboist Russel
Walder's debut LP. Recorded
at Windham Hill Records and
released in the Fall of 1982,
this album won the attention
of Billboard Magazine's"Top
Album Picks." In the
November 20, 1982 issue,
Stein and Walder were
praised: "Windham Hill's
latest addition is this young
duo already steeped in the
chamber jazz atmosphere of
Oregon, Art Lande and other
stylists. Stein's lyrical piano
and Walder's piquant oboe
counterpoint each other
beautifully. ..
Stein composed all six
piano-oboe duets. Together
Stein and Walder make music
which is spirited and compel
ling. As their two instruments
blend and solo, the energy of
the music stays high. When
one musician solos he takes
all the space he can get, all the
directions he can find. The
two artists create one com

plete work through the six in
terrelated pieces. Wonderful
changes of pace make this
music alive and interesting.
From the piano and oboe's
joyously accelerating in
terplay in " Minou's Walt," to
the oboe's beautiful, irres
ponsible, break-neck solo in
"Rice Fields," the music's
energy abounds. After "Rict
Fields" is a piece Stein calls
"Eden." Stein's piano creates
a view of Eden which is com
plete with a summer shower.
His solo trickles, softly cover
ing and highlighting the gar
den he has led his listeners
into.
It may be that no one song
stands apart from the others
â€” for example, you may not
find yourself queing for" Rice
Fields" specifically. How
ever, what you may discover
is that Elements as a whole
will haunt you. Instead of one
song you feel you "just have
to hear," it is the whole col
lection you find yourself re
turning to again and again.
