# Sororities consider block bidding
## 
### MARK GILLIS 
Members of the Inter-Sorority Council are considering implementing an idea
that would allow women to join sororities in groups instead of as individuals in
the upcoming spring rush.
ISC President Suzanne Schendel said each sorority is supposed to vote on the
idea at its next meeting. However, she said some sororities had not yet had time
to vote on the matter.
She said a change in the sorority rush system that would adopt this idea of
block bidding is not yet planned. Schendel said, "It's something we're consider
ing for girls who might like to all go into the same sorority."
Schendel said the idea for block bidding has come up with a concern about,
how to get groups started. Because women are more likely to join.the larger,
more prestigious and established sororities, Schendel felt that block biding
would help smaller sororities grow faster.
"If a bunch of girls all know that they can join the same one, have more of an:
influence on the group and be with their friends, they may join the smaller
ones," she added. l
Another method the sororities are using to equalize the number of pledges
each sorority receives, Schendel said, is to set quotas based on the number of:
women coming in divided-by the number of groups. For example, if 60 women:
were pledging six sororities, each one could take 10 pledges at the most. ;
With this system each sorority could, ideally, have equal pledge membership
after rush. "It's a way to assure every girl a place and try to keep the sororities -
around the same size," she added.
Schendel stressed, however, that block bidding is only a possibility and not a.
revolutionary decision, "I don't think it would drastically change rush or be:
widespread. In fact, it would only be a special case," she said.
Block bidding is not a tactic to counteract low rush turnouts, she said. On the ■
contrary, Schendel optimistically stressed, "Last year's rush was the largest'
we've ever had, and I see our system as expanding."
