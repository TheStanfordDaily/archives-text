training â€” Daily staffers need it too. All
photogs, writers, night editors, wire edi

session next Saturday, Jan. 29. No ski
trips allowed!

ition of next volume's staff will be
posted in the office this afternoon.

Sports
Hooo! All those interested in writing
sports, or covering a sports beat, next
volume should attend a meeting at 3:30
p.m. tomorrow. Sports eds will be in
