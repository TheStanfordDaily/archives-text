# Scouts' efforts win local player
## Star QB to sign with Card 
### MARK ZEIGLER 
Regarded as the top high school
quarterback in the nation, local star
John Paye told the Daily late last night
he will attend Stanford next fall pend
ing his formal acceptance.
"I'm committed to Stanford," said
Paye, who has called a 12:30 p.m. press
conference today to announce his deci
sion. A senior at Menlo Park's Menlo
School, Paye talked to the Daily in
Meyer Undergraduate Library, where
he was studying for a high school his
tory final exam.
"I'm pretty sure I'm going to get in,"
Paye said, in reference to his chances
'* for admission. Menlo School, a private
prep school, is highly-regarded
4 academically and consistently sends
several of its students to Stanford each
Paye ranks near the top of his
class.
Paye said the press conference was
called this week for two reasons. "One,
so I'm not bothered by recruiters any
more, and, two, because it might influ
ence other recruits to attend Stanford."
Paye will make an oral commitment
to Stanford today, three weeks before
national letter of intent day — the first
day high school athletes can commit
themselves in writing to attend a uni

versity.
The Menlo School senior set three
state passing records this season and
was selected by USA Today and other
publications as the nation's No. 1 prep
quarterback.
"He's an excellent college pros
pect," said Stanford Receiver Coach
Dave Ottmar. "His range, mobility,
arm strength and experience make him
one of the top prospects in the country
at quarterback."
Paye said he has always kept his eye
on Stanford. "I was born in Stanford
Hospital and have lived in the area all
my life," he said. "I've always been
around Stanford."
By last November, the Menlo senior
had narrowed his choices to Stanford,
Notre Dame and UCLA and made
formal visits to only the first two.
"I couldn't visualize myself going to
any other school," he said." Academics
(at Stanford) are a big plus. If I went to,
say, Notre Dame, it would be on a
purely athletic basis."
Both Offensive Coordinator Jim
Fassel and Ottmar indicated there is "a
definite possibility" that Paye could be
a four-year starter at Stanford.
Steve Cottrell seems to be the
number one candidate for the starting

quarterback position at the present
time, but Paye could be redshirted his
freshman year to preserve all four years
of his athletic eligibility, the two
coaches said.
"I'd say he's an awful fine quarter
back," said junior receiver Emile
Harry, with whom Paye stayed last
weekend in his official recruiting visit
here. "He's quite deserving of all the
rankings he had in high school."
In three years at Menlo School, Paye
racked up 7569 yards through the air
— the third best total in California prep
history. His 1982 season total of 3388
yards passing is a state record, as is his
average of 308 yards passing per game.
Paye also threw eight touchdown
passes in one game, another state
mark, against Marello Prep last
Nbvember.
The Menlo senior has helped the
Knights compile a 19-2-1 record over
the last two seasons while leading them
to consecutive league and North Coast
Section Division I-A championships.
Besides football, Paye plays high
school baseball and has been a four
year varsity basketball starter. He indi
cated he would "possibly play baseball
in college, but that's tentative."
