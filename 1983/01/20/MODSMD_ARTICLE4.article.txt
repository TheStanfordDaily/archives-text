# Coffee House confronts $10,000 deficit
## 
### STEVE TROUSDALE Staff writer 
As a result of a $20,000 deficit regis
tered between Sept. 1 and Nov. 31 of
last year, the Coffee House will imple
ment several labor cost-cutting mea
sures, according to Bob Brody, ASSU
student financial manager and Coffee
House treasurer.
However, Brody projected that for
the period from Dec. 1 to Aug. 31 the
Coffee House would make approxi
mately $10,000, thus ending the fiscal
year with a total deficit of $10,000.
The cost-cutting measures being im-*
plemented, Brody said, including a new
system for ordering sandwiches, a re
duction in the total hours offered to
employees, a reduction in the number
of employees hired and a requirement
that managers work "on the line," that
is, serve customers directly. The re
staurant employs, on average, between
110 and 130 total employees, 12 of
whom are full-time employees.
Brody attributed the deficit in the
first part of the year to the more than
$2000 of glassware that was stolen
from the Coffee House's premises and
in part by insufficient preparation of a
new system for serving food. Since then
the latter problem has been corrected.
Brody was unable to provide exact
figures on the change in revenue and
customer counts noted since the begin
ning of this quarter because they have
not yet been compiled.
Steve Weiss, manager of the Coffee
House, did confirm that customer
counts and revenue were up last week
compared to a similar period last year.
The loss during most of last quarter
was caused, he said, by a series of
events at the beginning of the school
year. First, the strike caused a tre
mendous increase in customers for the
restaurant, an increase that it was un
able to handle because at the beginning
of the year the Coffee House is usually
understaffed, as that is the time when it
does most of its hiring for the year. He
said that many long-time customers
became dissatisfied with the long lines
caused by this increase in patronage
and began to stop using the restaurant.
This increase in customers occurred
at the same time that a new system of
serving food went into effect, he said.
Under this system customers could
order sandwiches part by part, instead
of ordering a certain type of sandwich.
In this system, customers could and
sometimes did order a sandwich with
two slices of bread and a slice of cheese,

according to Chris Cramer, president
of the Coffee House, Inc. Such a
sandwich, he said, cost the Coffee
House the same in labor to make as
would a much more expensive
sandwich, and thus the Coffee House
was losing money on such sandwiches.
Added to these difficulties were de
lays — again strike-caused — to the
new garden patio, an addition which
doubles the Coffee House's seating
capacity. Because the new system of
making sandwiches was scheduled to
go into effect at the same time as the
" J, *he"W'pzrtf&, delays in finishing the patio
fed to a postponement in instituting the
new sandwich system until just before
the start of fall quarter.
Because the new system was untried,
many problems with it had to be
worked out in the face of large crowds
and few workers, according to Weiss.
He said about those opening weeks,
"I'm surprised we made it through
(them)."
The Coffee House, which has been
run by students since the spring of 1980
and was set up to run on a non-profit
basis, started its first year with an ap
proximate $35,000 loss, according to

Brody. To bail it out, the ASSU made
the group a loan, as it also had for the
restaurant's start-up costs. These two
loans totaled approximately $35,000,
he said.
In its next year, according to Brody,
it made approximately $8000 on sales
of approximately/$730,000. Thus, the
Coffee House remains in debt because
it has not been able to make enough to
pay off its loans from the ASSU, Brody
said.
The Coffee House, Inc., remains
connected to the ASSU in other ways,
although it is less connected :. ; ,j than,
in past years.
For example, on the board of direc
tors sits Cynthia Mathewson, as chair,
Brody and ASSU Senator Robin
Gaither, because three ASSU officials
automatically sit on the board. Also,
the ASSU Senate holds the 100 shares
of Coffee House, Inc. stock in trust for
the students, who in effect own the re
staurant because they helped in its
start-up costs.
However, Cramer said that the Cof
fee House's relationship with the
ASSU was not a close one, because, he
said, "the ASSU doesn't exercise day

to-day control" over the restaurant. He
did mention that he, as president, did
not have as much control as he might
like: "I have at times felt that the cor
porate structure is hard to work for,"
because he had previously been the
ASSU's Course Guide project manager
and at that position he had had more
day-to-day control, with the provision
that he report to the student financial
manager.
Furthermore, to cut down on the loss
associated with customers taking out
glassware, the Coffee House has
L to disposable cups, although,
according to Lisa Loveft, a student shift
manager, this move has produced
complains from customers. However,
she said that once such economy moves
were explained to customers they stop
ped their complaints.
Despite the nature of its operation as
a restaurant, and despite its losses, the
Coffee House remains committed to
operating on a non-profit basis and
working towards training students to
work, instead of using full-time
employees, said Weiss.

mind could afford to hire 110 stu
dents," he said because "you lose some
efficiency" in training that number of
students and splitting a regular eight
hour shift between several students.
However, he said the Coffee House

had "obtained (its) goal of becoming a
large-scale student employer."
And despite the complaints of long.-
time customers of new Coffee House
methods for ordering food, the re*
staurant remains one of the most well
used enterprises in Tresidder Union. In
a survey conducted last spring by Tre-;
sidder management, 75 percent of a
random sample of students on campus
used the Coffee House.
