# DUs dissatisfied with new house color
## 
### ALISON SOUTH 
Members of the Delta Upsilon fraternity here
unleashed linguistic creativity in their attempt to
name the shade of green now covering their house.
This fresh coat of paint provides inspiration for the
various epithets "split pea soup," "puke" and
"exorcist green," said several DU members.
Heloisa Edwards, manager of Row and Cluster
facility, was in charge of the painting project and
color selection. "The house was supposed to be
painted during the summer, but the project was
delayed until this Christmas," explained Edwards.
When the DUs returned to campus for registra
tion this quarter, they were very surprised to find
that their house had changed colors.
"No DUs were consulted whatsoever. No DUs
knew," said Tad Swanson. a member of the house.
Todd Ackerman, also a DU, added, "We didn't
know what color was chosen until after they or
dered the paint. During finals, we went to Heloisa

and saw the primer she chose. We were all sur
prised."
While selecting the paint last summer, Edwards
consulted several non-DU students after showing
them a sample of the green color. And the peculiar
shade of "adobe" stuck.
"Rotting adobe," Swanson countered.
"She thought about consulting us, but decided
not to, to avoid buying a more expensive paint,"
said DU John Harris.
"It's unfortunate. Had I known they would be
this unhappy and so bothered, I would have gone
through them. It didn't occur to me that they would
care so much," said Edwards. "In the future, I will
get in touch before the summer, and get an opinion
from the house. You can never please everyone.
Some will like it, some won't," she added.
The members of Sigma Chi responded to the
paint job with a letter addressed to Chris Ely, DU
president. In the letter, the fraternity disavowed

any responsibility for the new "sickening hue," and
offered their condolences as well as luck in "the
pursuit of revenge."
The letter was received by the DUs in the same
tongue-in-cheek spirit with which it was sent.
"There is no loss of love between the houses.
They used it as an opportunity to make a state
ment," said Ackerman. "Even they don't deserve
that color," said Sigma Chi member Paul Toback,
"it highlights our house even better."
While the DUs express their frustration over the
new color of their house, they are facing the reality
of living with it every day. DU Randy Breitenbach
suggested that they paint black question marks all
over it.
And Chris Kelsey found something optimistic
about the house predicament. "There's something
to say about living in the ugliest house on campus,"
he said.
