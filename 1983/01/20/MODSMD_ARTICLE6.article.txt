Compiled from news reports and wire services
Pledging cooperation to resist economic
protectionism and revitalize the global
economy. President Reagan and Japanese
Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone met in
Washington this week to discuss the two na
tions' differences.
Though the meetings were conducted in a
spirit of goodwill, neither of the two leaders
offered any new solutions to the vexing trade
problems between the capitalist world's two
most powerful industrial countries.
Prior to the White House meeting,
Nakasone told newspaper editors that poli
tics limit Japanese economic expansion ab
road, lest the island nation become isolated
from its trading partners and the world at
large.
According to the Japanese leader, a cent
ral task for political leaders must be to pre
vent the isolation of Japan by accommodat
ing its economic drives to the needs of other
nations.

In a session Tuesday, Reagan reportedly
emphasized that the United States' protec
tionist drive is a serious political problem for
both nations. Reagan apologized for what he
termed "unfair" Democratic attacks on
Japanese trade and indicated that Japan
could expect much the same if the Democrats
win in 1984.
The two leaders, however, did not discuss
one of the most difficult trade issues between
their countries, the continuation of Japan's
two-year-old "voluntary" limit on the export
of automobiles to the American market.
The current limit on exporting Japanese
cars to the United States is 1,680,000 au
tomobiles per year. The American auto in
dustry is seeking a two-year extension of the
limits.
Also of some help in contributing to
friendly feelings between Japan and the Un
ited States was Nakasone's announcement
that he will aim to build Japan'sair defense to
the point that it can detect and stop over

flights by the Soviet Union's long-range
Backfire bomber.
Nakasone's boldness in the military area,
as well as his directness in the economic field
were greeted appreciatively by Reagan and
other senior officials.
Acceptance of such an objective would re
quire a major buildup by Japanese forces
beyond what is currently scheduled.
In order to monitor and stop overflights by
the Backfire, Japan would increase radar
capability as well as expand interception
capacity, according to U.S. experts. The
Japanese will soon receive a limited number
of F-15 warplanes, but not enough to handle
the task.
To blockade the Soviet fleet the Japanese
will need a much larger number of mines and
more advanced mine-laying air and sea craft
than the nation has on hand.
