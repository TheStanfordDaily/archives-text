# Nakasone -a new leader takes command, sets agenda

Compiled from news reports and wire services
In his relatively brief time in office, Japanese
Prime Minister Yashura Nakasone has shown
himself to be a staunch advocate of closer ties
between his country and the United States.
Nakasone's use of the word "alliance" dur
ing his visit to Washington to describe U.S.-
Japanese relations symbolized the importance
he attaches to the problem of maintaining a
good relationship between the two countries.
The previous Japanese government's use of the
word stirred up controversy in antimilitarist
Japan. But a spokesman for Nakasone said that
the prime minister intends to continue to use
the word because of the closeness of the two
nations.
Relations between Japan and the United
States have been strained because of Japanese
import restrictions. Some American industries
have pressed for import restrictions on
Japanese products unless the Japanese relax
their trade restrictions on American goods.

On the day before he was elected to the
position of prime minister by the Japanese par
liament, Nakasone said, "The crux of Japanese
foreign policy is Japanese-United States rela
tions. Should relations with the U.S. stagger,
no other policy will work effectively."
Nakasone surprised American officials by
offering to undertake a major Japanese de
fense buildup aimed at giving Japan the capa
bility of tracking Soviet Backfire bombers over
its territory and of keeping the Sea of Japan
closed to the Soviet Navy in time of war.
American officials have long pressed the
Japanese to undertake a more active role in
defense.
Nakasone first won a seat on the Diet, Ja
pan's parliament, in 1947, at the age of 29. He
has been one of Japan's most forceful and con
troversial leaders throughout his career. He
advocates quick rearmament after World War
II and has since repeatedly denied that he de
sires to reassert Japanese military power.

During the late 1960s Nakasone headed Ja
pan's Defense Agency, whose budget in
creased steadily. But Nakasone responded to
rumors that he wanted to turn Japan into a
nuclear power by saying he thought that Japan
"should not, now or in the future, build its own
nuclear weapons."
In 1972, Nakasone was named minister of
International Trade and Industry.
Nakasone took office as prime minister less
than two months ago after a hard struggle'
within the ruling Liberal Democratic Party. He
had obtained the political backing of former
Japanese Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka, who
is currently on trial in Japan in connection with
the Lockheed bribery scandal. Tanaka's en
dorsement was considered an important ele
ment in Nakasone's successful bid for the top
post. His success came after years of trying to
overcome his rivals within his own party.
Nakasone used his influential position within

the party to accumulate enough political debts
to maneuver himself into power.
While Nakasone spelled out his intentions in
the military sphere, he remained vague about
what he plans to do about U.S.-Japanese trade
relations. An administration official said that
President Reagan had failed to extract any
specific concessions from Nakasone. Nakasone
was said to have warned of the dangers of the
growing popularity of protectionism in this
country.
Nakasone has described the relationship be
tween the United States and Japan as similar to
that between a teacher and a student. "The
U.S. has been a very good teacher to Japan,"
he is reported to have said, "and the student
does not want to fight the teacher."
