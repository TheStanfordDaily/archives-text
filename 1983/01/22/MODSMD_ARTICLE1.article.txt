# Food Service, ASSU surveys conflict

### CAROLINE RHOADS 
Despite conflicting indications of student opin
ion, residents of Sterling Quad next fall will likely
pay only for the food they eat, as part of a Univer
sity Food Service experiment.
A recent ASSU survey indicated that students
feel they now eat more than necessary and thus
waste food and money. A similar Food Service
study, however, showed that most students wish to
remain on the present plan in which they pay a set
price for unlimited food.
The development of the surveys, both issued last
quarter, was spurred in part by an ASSU Task
Force report on University Food Service, released
in September. In the report, the task force made
five recommendations for improving the Food Ser
vice program, including the "fee-for-service" ex
periment.
Maxine Anderson, food service maTiager, said
"surveys show that students don't want fee-for
service." At least one survey backs her up. Eighty
eight percent of the students responding to the Uni
versity survey said they agreed that "the seconds
policy should be continued." Eighty-one percent
disagreed that "individuals should pay extra for
seconds."
But the ASSU study, which asked a slightly diffe
rent question, suggests that students would wel
come a pay-as-you-eat plan.
In the Task Force survey, 71 percent of the stu
dents responding said they ate more when on a meal
plan than during the 30-day strike of Stanford
workers which closed dormitory kitchens and
forced students to buy meals elsewhere. Fifty-four
percent said they felt that they were eating the right
amount of food during the strike.
Task Force Co-Cair Gordon Hecker said that the
University's questions may have misled students.
"Unfortunately we felt that some of the questions

(on the University questionnaire) might be am
biguous. I'm afraid that some of the results they got
confirm this," Hecker said.
More than 2000 students, from all dormitories,
responded to the University study. The Task Force
questionnaire reached about 150 students in 10
dorms.
Task Force proponents of the fee-for-service
plan maintain the system would reduce food waste
and allow students more control over the quality
and variety of the food they eat. The system would
also "create a more equitable system of board pay
ment where students pay for what they themselves,
and not their neighbors, eat," the report said.
University Food Service, which works closely
with Residential Education, sees the fee-for
service as possibly leading to less dorm unity since
students might be encouraged to eat outside the
dorm under the new plan, according to Task Force
Co-Chair Mark Kalkus.
" Res Ed's philosophy is to have people eat at the
dorm," said Kalkus.
Anderson said she recently visited the University
of Washington where the entire University is run on
such a plan.
"The system is fine for the University of
Washington," she said, "but there is a completely
different feeling in the eating places. You see more
people eating alone."
TTie Task Force also recommended that row
houses currently operated by the University Food
Service be allowed to "hire their own cooks and
operate their own kitchens, as do the 23 self
operated houses on campus."
Self-ops are less expensive for the University to
run, Kalkus said. "The University sustained a
$140,000 loss subsidizing row houses last year," he
said.
University-run row houses are less efficient, he

said, because in a large dorm only a few cooks are
needed to serve up to 800 people but one cook is
needed for every 40 to 50 in a row house. Self-ops
"have been less expensive and don't cost the Uni
versity any money," he said.
In addition to the financial incentives for allow
ing the row houses to become self-ops, students
would have greater control over the type and qual
ity of the food they eat, the Task Force said.
Response to the Food Service survey showed that
63 percent of the students who filled it out favored
the conversion of row houses to self-ops over three
other cost reduction alternatives.
Row Director Diana Conklin recently sent out a
letter to all residential assistants in University-run
row houses saying that one or two will be allowed to
become self-operated on an experimental basis
next fall upon submission of a detailed proposal for
the conversion.
Other recommendations proposed by the Task
Force were that meal cards be replaced by magnetic
identification cards, that Residential Education's
participation in the Food Service program be en
hanced and that the University look into the possi
bility of hiring a private contractor to run Food
Service.
The magnetic ID cards would facilitate the im
plementation of the fee-for-service program be
cause by inserting the card into the proper machine,
the cost of the student's meal would automatically
be deducted from a standing account.
Registrar Sally Mahoney is looking into the
feasibility of issuing magnetic cards to students,
since with the proper machines, the cards could also
be used to add and drop classes, check out library
books and make Bookstore charges as well as for a
host of other functions.

FOOD FOR THOUGHT: Seniors Rick Putnam and Nancy Rodkin serve
themselves at a typical, buffet-style food service salad bar. The University
and the ASSU distributed independent surveys to get a clear picture of
students' feelings about food service but came up with different views.
In regard to the hiring of a private
contractor the Task Force found that
the "program at Stanford costs 30 to 80
percent more than identical plans of
fered by private contractors at other
universities in the area and nation
wide."
While the University is following up
on the Task Force recommendations
for saving money and raising the qual
ity of food, it does not want to do so at
the expense of the philosophy of resi
dential education, Kalkus said. If the
experiments with the self-ops and fee
for-service programs are successful, it
is possible that those programs will be
expanded in the future.
"We are looking into a plan that will
be compatible with Res Ed," Anderson
said. "We want to make Food Service
what is right for Stanford."
