Senior Anne Marie DeGeorge,
director of the committee for
Austria week said, "Austria
week is a week of activities open
to all people of the Stanford
community and designed to ac
quaint them with the Austrian
culture." Certainly the flavor of
Austrian culture will be rep
resented, since one of the guests
of honor for the week is an Aust
rian, Heidi Thiming. She is the as
sistant director of the Universi
ty's overseas program in Vienna.
The guest of honor is
being specially down in from

Austria. The event will take
place on Monday night, at a
: place to be announced.
This lecture will be followed,

"tiorfai'Wine drinking festival at
; Haus Mitteleuropa. This event is
patterned after a celebration

in Austria known as
Heurigenabend. During this fes
tival, the new wine of the year is
tasted for the first time, along
with sausages, cheese and other
refreshments. The University

is the scene of Thursday's phase
of Austria week. The house will
co-sponsor a traditional Aust
rian coffee house, complete with
authentic Austrian drinks and
pastries.
Finally, on Friday night, the
members of Haus Mitteleuropa
will run a real Austrian restaur
ant. The cooking, waiting and
entire administration will be
done at 620 Mayfield by the

members of the Haus. The even
ing promises a wonderful cul
tural experience as well as delici

ous food. Reservations are
necessary well in advance.
Along with these special
events, the week will be sprink
led with reminders of Austria.
For instance, on Sunday after
noon, Feb. 6, KZSU will play
two hours of Austrian classical
music.
To top off this week, there is
Saturday's famous Viennese ball.
The opening ceremonies will
begin at 8 p.m. The members of
the ball committee will perform
their traditional opening, com
plete with long white dresses and
elbow length gloves for the
women and tuxedos for the men.
This ceremony is done in true
pageant style with the honored
guests making their entrance first.
The guest list includes such
personalities asThiming and the
Austrian Consul. These guests
will be followed by the openers,
dancing their carefully choreog
raphed steps to the "Blue
Danube Waltz." Senior Marta
Fajardo, a leading member of
the committee, said, "There is so
much magic in the whole thing.
That's what 1 want to pass on to
people here." Fajardo had the
privilege of taking part in the
opening ceremonies of a ball
while she was overseas in Austria
a year ago.

The ball, which ends at 1 a.m.,
is fashioned after those in Vienna
during the season of Fasching,
when extravagant wintertime
balls are held night after night. "It
(the ball) is a symbol of old Vie
nna and the Hapsburg empire,"

The members of the
ball committee will
perform their
traditional opening,
complete with long
white dresses and
elbow length gloves
for the women and
tuxedos for the men.
The ceremony is
done in a true
pageant style with
the honored guests
making their
entrance first.

Fajardo said. These balls are trad
itionally cotillions, or "coming
out" dances for young Austrian
women. The opening dance here
will follow such a pattern. Ac
companying the ball will be Aust

nan refreshments and decora
tions. Of course, the music will be
an orchestra performing Austrian
waltzes and polkas. For those pre
ferring a different pace, a jazz
band will play in an adjoining
room. For regular ticket holders,
the dress will be formal, but
tuxedos are not required.
Those involved in planning the
week's events have been hard at
work since last quarter. Six spe
cial committees are working to
make the week and the ball a
success. Funds will come from
the sale of tickets and such dona
tions as those from the Overseas
Office and the German Depart
ment. Emily Brown, head of the
funding committee, said, "For
me, the most important thing
with the ball is getting together
again with the people that I was
overseas with."
Tickets to the Viennese ball go
on sale Jan. 31 in White Plaza at
$13 per person. Sales will con
tinue from noon to 3 p.m. each
day until tickets are sold out.
Only 500 tickets are available
this year because of new fire reg
ulations in Roble Gym. If you
are unsure of yourself on the
dance floor, at least four sessions
of waltz, polka and swing danc
ing lessons will be held before
the dance.
