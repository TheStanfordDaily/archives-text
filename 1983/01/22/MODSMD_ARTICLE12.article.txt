## Another Hollywood bomb 
### 
Just when you thought it was safe to begin arms
negotiations again... Or, The return of the neutron
bomb. Or maybe just Crusin', with the Pershingll.
Any of these titles might fit the latest Reagan
administration shake-up in arms control strategists
and policies.
President Reagan had almost escaped the
charge that he uses a Hollywood background and
mentality to solve — or at least to camouflage —
the most complicated domestic and foreign
policies. Almost, but the latest White House
policies cry to be interpreted as implementing the
idea that public relations work and a few trick
camera angles can make up for an all too apparent
lack of policy substance and innovation.
The efforts to counter what officials have fallen
into the habit of calling "the Soviet peace offen
sive" (as though arms proposals must be viewed as
yet another assault on American security) hearken
back to the first days of Voice of America or even
to George Creel's propaganda outfit during World
War I. Officials have labeled the U.S. arms control
problems as being ones of "public diplomacy"
rather than of policy, and they have set up high
powered groups to set the world straight on the
matter. National Security Advisor William Clark,
famous for his impressive command of ignorance
during his earlier confirmation hearings, will head
a Cabinet-level group to tell a new truth to the
nation, and Peter Dailey will lead a similar group in
the effort to sell the American story to the Euro
peans.
Wednesday's announcement of the new arms
negotiation effort was unabashed in its intent to
shape world opinion through better advertising
rather than by presenting a better product. Clark's
group — which includes Secretary of State George
Shultz, Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger and
Charles Wick, director of the U.S. Information
Agency — is supposed to coordinate press efforts
better and solve such "problems" as the nuclear
freeze movement. Dailey — who boasts such pol
icy experience as running the largest West Coast
advertising agency and directing advertising for
Reagan's 1980 presidential race and former Presi

dent Richard Nixon's 1972 bid — will lead his
group in convincing the Western Europeans of the
United States' good intentions and sound policies.
For a while it looked as though there was a
possibility of imminent progress in arms reduction.
What looked like an initial victory for hardliners
within the Senate in the dismissal of Eugene Ros
tow, who was head of the Arms Control and Dis
armament Agency, turned out to be a clash of
personalities. The departure of Richard Starr from
the conventional arms talk — and with his tales
of "erratic behavior" and issuing pistols and bul
letproof vests to underlings, hardly the stuff of
arms negotiation — came at the same time as ap
pointments of former Rep. David Emory and vete
ran diplomat Morton Abramovitz, not known for
their intractable positions.
These personnel changes came when the Soviets
were making a series of publicized proposals and
U.S. officials continued to leak news of impending
settlement. But the latest media blitz suggests that
these were only false hopes raised by honest
people longing for long-awaited arms reduction.
Instead, the administration has confirmed fears
that it views nuclear arms control talks as a forum
to win the hearts and allegiance of nations around
the world rather than as the means for effective
control of nuclea weapons.
This concentration upon form over substance
becomes more disturbing when it challenges the
idea that there need be any substance at all, or at
least challenges the assumption that creative
policies lead to arms control first, and then wow
the masses. When Soviet peace offers become
necessary objects of suspicion and attack, when
arms control talks are enslaved to the scoreboard
of world alliance rather than the other way around,
and when people and governments need convinc
ing through better public relations rather than
through better ideas, American actions can only
call into question American sincerity and com
mitment to averting war. Hollywood can sway the
tabloids and the movie audiences, but it shouldn't
be the substance of reducing conventional and nuc
lear arms.
