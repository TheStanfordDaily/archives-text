## Campus days spent with a cane 
### 
Last week 1 injured my knee. It
doesn't matter how I did it, or when, or
where. What does matter is that now I
am temporarily confined to the condi
tions of a cane. This cane isn't very
pretty. It is cold, it is metal and it is
silver. It isn't very friendly. I don't
think it likes me much. Quite frankly, I
don't like it one bit.
This cane has made a big intrusion on
my lifestyle. It's not just the disability
or the injury that is the intrusion. It's
not the fact that I can't nin or dance for
a while. It's the cane. What it does to
me, how it makes me appear, how it
makes me feel.
It's funny — there's quite a per
ceived difference between using
crutches and using a cane. If you're
using crutches, people assume you
have a temporary injury: she broke her
leg, he sprained his ankle etc. A cane is
quite different. People think you are
different. I guess they assume that
there is something permanently wrong
with you; I sense them wondering,
"What could it be?" I feel mixed emo
tions emanating from these people. It
begins with curiousity, goes to pity,
sympathy, empathy and winds up
around guilt — have I caused an inter
ruption into the every day lives of these

people? Am I an ugly reminder of what
is imperfect, of what is incurable, of
what is unwanted? This troubles me.
The reactions have been quite varied
— mostly stares. Cold ones. Reeking of
emptiness. At first this made me angry.
I wanted to create some kind of aware
ness in them, to awaken them to a u
nique kind of existence. I wanted to yell
at them, "I'm really no different than
you — I am just having trouble walking
right now." Yet, somehow, I feel as
though I have failed in this endeavor —
I am guilty in my silence.
Another method. Smile. Smile, you.
I'll smile at you. Don't be surprised,
people with canes smile, honest. That's
right, smile. At me. What small joy that
exists in that exchange of energies is
clearly worth the discomfort that pro
voked it.
Someone just pointed out to me that
there are all sorts of things that one can
do with a cane. One can dance with it,
as in Bing Gosby. One can pretend
that it's a hook and drag pretend
people off stage. One can twirl it and
shine in the rays that the steel emits, as
it flashes in the light.
I've learned an appreciation of what
it is like to be handicapped. And of how
one is treated. Of what it is like for

some considerate person to hold a door
open for you. Of what it is like for some
tactless, unfeeling person to speculate
about your "problem," even though
you stand just a few feet away, feeling
every insensitive word with a twinge of
pain to the knee. Of what it is like to use
a ramp instead of stairs, and of how it
feels to be forced to use the stairs be
cause there isn't a ramp. Of what it is
like to have someone who is walking
behind you at a brisk pace slow down,
just to make you feel better and not so
aware of the disability. Of what it is like
to be treated as one who is not human,
but inferior, unnatural, unwelcome.
Somehow, I identify with the
minorities, women, elderly veterans,
children and all the other groups that
have experienced the prejudice and
discrimination that accompanies a per
ceived difference.
I still don't like using the cane. It is
awkward, uncomfortable and tiring. It
is also useful, inspirational and
thought-provoking. The discontent it
provoked has given me a new perspec
tive on life. In my discontent, lam con
tent. Thank you, cane.
