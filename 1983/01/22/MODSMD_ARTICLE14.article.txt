## Abortion law: here vs. West Germany 
### 
Ten years ago on Jan. 22, 1973, the
U.S. Supreme Court in Roe v. Wade
and Doe v. Bolton overturned all state
abortion laws by ruling:
. No state can interfere with abor
tions performed before 12 weeks gesta
tion.
• No restrictions can be imposed dur
ing the next 12 weeks, except those to
make the procedure safer for the
mother (i.e., requiring that the abor
tion be performed in a hospital).
. In the period after ''viability,"
when the child is capable of meaningful
life outside the womb, states may regu-

He recognized that "as long as at least
potential life is involved, the state may
assert interests beyond the protection
of the pregnant woman alone." If the
fetus were granted the full rights of a
"person" under the Fourteenth
Amendment, "the fetus' right to life
would then be guaranteed specifically
by the amendment."
The Court found that all such rights
previously had been contingent upon
live birth, and so held that the fetus is
not a person within the language and
meaning of the Fourteenth Amend
ment. By referring to prenatal life as

The West German court chose to re
solve the difficult question of when
iife begins by establishing: "Life, in the
sense of historical existence of a human
individual, exists according to definite
biological-psysiological knowledge, in
any case, from the 14th day after con
ception. ... The process of develop
ment which has begun at this point is a
continuing process which exhibits no
sharp demarcation and does not allow a
precise division of the various steps of
development of the human life. .
The right to life is guaranteed to
everyone who lives; no distinction can
be made here between various stages of
the life developing itself, before birth,
or between unborn and born life." .
It is in the aftermath of World War II
that the West German people now hold
human life as the ultimate value: "It is
the living foundation of human dignity
and the prerequisite for all other fun
damental rights." The Federal Con
stitutional Court consequently held
that any changes in the abortion laws
which would allow the taking of human
life are unconstitutional.

late or prohibit abortions except when
the health or life of the mother is
threatened. (Health includes a variety
of factors including physical,.emotional
and psychological well-being, and the
woman's age.)
In sharp contrast to Roe v. Wade, the
Federal Constitution Court of West
Germany in 1975 struck down as un
constitutional a statute which would
have legalized abortion during the first
12 weeks of pregnancy. In addition, the
statute would have legalized those
abortions in later stages of pregnancy
performed by a physician if warranted
by specific medical or eugenic reasons.
By contrasting these two decisions, the
controversy which continues in this
country can be better understood.
In an effort to determine the con
stitutionality of abortion laws in the
United States, Justice Harry Blackmun
reviewed their historical development.
By the late 1950s many states allowed
only those abortions designed to pro
tect the life of the mother. Blackmun
considered two main reasons for this
development.
First, until the 19605, "the proce
dure was a hazardous one for the wo
man." In the 1960s new techniques
were being developed which resulted in
greater safety for the woman.
Blackmun then considered the state's
interest in protecting "prenatal life."

"potential life," the U.S. Supreme
Court balanced the rights of "potential
life" against the rights of the pregnant
woman and struct down as unconstitu
tional laws prohibiting abortion.

The West German court chose to resolve the
difficult question of when life begins by
establishing: "Life, in the sense of historical
existence of a human individual, exists
according to definite biological-physiological
knowledge, in any case, from the 14th day of
conception .. "

Before deciding on the constitution
ality of abortion laws in West Ger
many, the Federal Constitutional
Court reviewed a provision within the
Basic Law which asserted that
"everyone has the right to life." The
provision was included in "reaction to
the'destruction of life unworthy of life'
. . .carried out by the National Socialis
tic Regime as measures of state." It was
the duty of the Federal Constitutional
Court to determine if this statement
included life before birth. Only then
could they rule on the constitutionality
of the abortion laws.

and adamantly denies the humanity of
the child. Another side is outraged by
the destruction of life and fails to ap
preciate the problems of the woman.
Instead of constructive dialogue, the
political climate has encouraged
polarization. Each side clings to its be
liefs, afraid of the compromise that
could result from true dialogue. Com
munication rather than confrontation
is the only solution I can propose.

of factors including physical,.emotional

In sharp contrast to Roe v. Wade, the
Federal Constitution Court of West
Germany in 1975 struck down as un
constitutional a statute which would
have legalized abortion during the first
12 weeks of pregnancy. In addition, the
statute would have legalized those
abortions in later stages of pregnancy
performed by a physician if warranted
by specific medical or eugenic reasons.
By contrasting these two decisions, the
controversy which continues in this
country can be better understood.
In an effort to determine the con
stitutionality of abortion laws in the
United States, Justice Harry Blackmun
reviewed their historical development.
By the late 1950s many states allowed
only those abortions designed to pro
tect the life of the mother. Blackmun
considered two main reasons for this
development.
First, until the 19605, "the proce
dure was a hazardous one for the wo
man." In the 1960s new techniques
were being developed which resulted in
greater safety for the woman.
Blackmun then considered the state's
interest in protecting "prenatal life."

"potential life," the U.S. Supreme
Court balanced the rights of "potential
life" against the rights of the pregnant
woman and struct down as unconstitu
tional laws prohibiting abortion.

The West German court chose to resolve the
difficult question of when life begins by
establishing: "Life, in the sense of historical
existence of a human individual, exists
according to definite biological-physiological
knowledge, in any case, from the 14th day of
conception .. "

Before deciding on the constitution

Ten years ago on Jan. 22, 1973, the
U.S. Supreme Court in Roe v. Wade
and Doe v. Bolton overturned all state
abortion laws by ruling:
. No state can interfere with abor
tions performed before 12 weeks gesta
tion.
• No restrictions can be imposed dur
ing the next 12 weeks, except those to
make the procedure safer for the
mother (i.e., requiring that the abor
tion be performed in a hospital).
. In the period after ''viability,"
when the child is capable of meaningful
life outside the womb, states may regu-

He recognized that "as long as at least
potential life is involved, the state may
assert interests beyond the protection
of the pregnant woman alone." If the
fetus were granted the full rights of a
"person" under the Fourteenth
Amendment, "the fetus' right to life
would then be guaranteed specifically
by the amendment."
The Court found that all such rights
previously had been contingent upon
live birth, and so held that the fetus is
not a person within the language and
meaning of the Fourteenth Amend
ment. By referring to prenatal life as
