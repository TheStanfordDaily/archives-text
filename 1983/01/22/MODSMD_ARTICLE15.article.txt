## Academic pressures necessitate casual relationships 
### 
In his column (Daily, Jan. 19), Alec
Rawls attacks the casual way many
people approach life and interpersonal
relationships. His basic thesis appears
to be that casuality cheats people out of
a full life.
Perhaps his basic thesis is correct.
But in his arguments, he makes a
statement about the sexuality of men
and women which is archaic in this day
and age: "... a woman feels her femi
ninity in the way she wants to be loved
by a man."
Thus Rawls portrays the woman's
role in love as a passive desire, that will
be fulfilled if she is lucky. I disagree. I
am a woman, and I will not wait "to be
loved by a man." A woman does — and
should — take an active role in a rela
tionship. Both partners in the relation
ship should love, actively, and be loved,
passively. Give and take, equally and
shared.
I also take objection to the implicit
dismissal of gay love. Is Rawls saying
that a man-man or woman-woman re
lationship is doomed to casuality, to
shallowness? Given the prejudices and
inequalities in our society, gay love is
less likely to be fully realized, but by no
means is it an impossibility! Ideally,
hetero- and homosexual relationships
would not be different in spirit, but
only in their physical manifestations.
Finally, 1 would like to offer an ex
planation for the casuality of relation
ships, sexuality and friendships found
here. As students here, we are all under

tremendous pressures; pressures to
perform. Performance takes time, a lot
of time. A relationship is something
that both partners must work at, and
that takes time, both with the other
person and alone. A lover, a full-blown
give and take relationship, is about
equivalent to a nine-unit class. How
many of us could afford to take an addi
tional nine units without suffering?
Since we cannot afford the time, we
must escape into shallow, trivial, casual
relationships.

Bulimia is serious
The article which compared bulimia
to anorexia nervosa {Daily, Jan. 12) is
not a fair treatment of bulimia. Bulimia
is a serious problem, both for the indi-

The Stanford Daily provides a forum to the
Stanford community in which public issues
can be debated, new ideas can be proposed
and old ideas challenged. Topics of inter
national, national and local concern are
considered appropriate. Will (he economy
turn around? How can the Mideast be
stabilized? Is there a future in the NATO

vidual, and here, for the community
within a student residence.
Bulimics can unknowingly condition
their bodies beyond the point of con
trol. It is generally believed that
bulimics force themselves to vomit
after binging. Bulimics, in fact, may
find their stomachs rejecting food and
may vomit as an involuntary response
to any and all eating. It is also not un
common for damage to the stomach
lining or esophagus to result from the
binge and purge syndrom of bulimia.
These early adverse effects are proba
bly factors in the number of bulimics
who seek treatment independently.
In situations such as a student resi
dence, the bulimic must also deal with
the problem of privacy and secrecy.
Bulimics will often use showers rather
than toilets — running water helps con
ceal the sound of their vomiting. It is
usually a plumbing complaint that
leads us to belive that someone in the
residence may be bulimic. Residents

may resent this use of common
facilities, and in fact, the disruption to
individuals, and the strain on the
plumbing (as inane as that may seem) is
often the leverage used by the resi
dence staff to get the individual to seek
treatment.
Bulimia is a serious health problem.
The story's summary statements that
bulimia is "more common," "easier to
treat" and "far less serious . .. since it
is generally not life threatening" than
anorexia nervosa trivialize the emo
tional and physical trauma of the
bulimic. The shame, guilt and feeling of
lack of control that the bulimic faces
deserve serious consideration. With 40
to 50 cases of bulimia reported here
each year, chances are that anyone who
read the Daily article will know a
bulimic here. I would hope that they
would exhibit more understanding
than your reporter.
