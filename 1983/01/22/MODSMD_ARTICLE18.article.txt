# Cardinal topples Devils
## 
### LIBBY LEONARD 
The Stanford women's basket
ball team collected its first con
ference win last night, outshining
the Arizona State Sun Devils
66-56.
Arizona State jumped out to a
quick 12-point lead in the first
quarter and things did not look
bright for Stanford.
But after 10 minutes, the Card
cooled down ASU's inside game
bv tightening its defensive zone
and protecting the middle.
Sophomore Marv Bradach
came off the bench in the second
quarter to hit three short baseline
jump shots, sparking a Cardinal
scoring drive.
Arizona State's sluggish zone
defense failed to shift quickly,
often leaving a Cardinal all alone
on the weak side and Stanford
was able to take advantage.
"We read what was open and
started to take good shots," Stan
ford coach Dottv McCrea said.
"That made the difference."
In a ten-minute scoring spree,
the Card blitzed Arizona State
22-5. Senior Jeanne Ruark-Hoff
scored eight unanswered points
with three minutes remaining in
the first half to give Stanford a
31-26 lead. Ruark-Hoff led all
scorers at half-time with 11
points.
Kvm Hampton, Arizona
Stale's powerful, left-handed
center and leading scorer, man
aged just eight points in the first
half. Hampton entered the game
averaging 25 points.
Stanford came out agressivelv
in the second half, denying the
b.ill to Hampton and forcing the
Sun I )e\ ils to shoot from outside
where thev did little damage.
Offensively, the Cardinal
started to penetrate inside the
lane and either scored on lay-ups
or dished the ball hack outside to
an unattended plaver.
Senior guard Angie Paccione
connected on 4-of-6 shots against
a loose \SI J /one in the second
half.
Stanford broke out to a 46-36
lead, but the Sun Devils scam
pered back to close the gap to
>4-50.
\fter a Stanford time-out,
Bradach scored two clutch
baskets to increase the margin to
eight with two minutes remain
ing.
Stanford coolly rattled off 6-
of-6 free throws in the final
minute to seal the win as the Sun
Devils desperately fouled to stop
the clock.
Ruark-Hoff hit 8-of-ll from
the field to finish with 19 points.
Paccione collected a season-high
16 points while Bradach also
scored a season-high 12 points.
Stanford's leading scorer, Meg
Met/ger, finished with four
points.
Stanford is now 1-2 in con
ference plav while Arizona State
has lost three in a row to drop its
record to 1-3.
The Cardinal hosts Arizona
Monday at 7:30 p.m in Maples
Pavilion.
