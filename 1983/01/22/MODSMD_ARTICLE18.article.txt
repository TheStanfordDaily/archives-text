# Cardinal topples Devils
## 
### LIBBY LEONARD 
The Stanford women's basket
ball team collected its first con
ference win last night, outshining
the Arizona State Sun Devils
66-56.
Arizona State jumped out to a
quick 12-point lead in the first
quarter and things did not look
bright for Stanford.
But after 10 minutes, the Card
cooled down ASU's inside game
bv tightening its defensive zone
and protecting the middle.
Sophomore Marv Bradach
came off the bench in the second
quarter to hit three short baseline
jump shots, sparking a Cardinal
scoring drive.
Arizona State's sluggish zone
defense failed to shift quickly,
often leaving a Cardinal all alone
on the weak side and Stanford
was able to take advantage.
"We read what was open and
started to take good shots," Stan
ford coach Dottv McCrea said.
"That made the difference."
In a ten-minute scoring spree,
the Card blitzed Arizona State
22-5. Senior Jeanne Ruark-Hoff
scored eight unanswered points
with three minutes remaining in
the first half to give Stanford a
31-26 lead. Ruark-Hoff led all
scorers at half-time with 11
points.
Kvm Hampton, Arizona
Stale's powerful, left-handed
center and leading scorer, man
aged just eight points in the first
half. Hampton entered the game
averaging 25 points.
