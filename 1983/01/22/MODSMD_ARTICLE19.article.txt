# No. 1 Bruins next

### STEVE ODELL 
That UCLA was ranked
No. I earlier this week by the
major wire services really was
of no consequence. There is
no question that the Bruins,
who Stanford meets tomor
row night in an 8 p.m. Pacif
ic* 10 conference basketball
game at Maples Pavilion, are
the best team the Cardinal will
face all season.
Still, Stanford coach Tom
Davis might have easily been
seen reading his horoscope
with heightened interest, deal
ing out tarot cards, or speak
ing with a soothsayer this
week. Davis will be attempt
ing to hold the pattern the
Cardinal have established by
pulling off major upsets over
UCLA in 1979 and 1981.
The complexion of the
game was changed a bit last
night though when John Rev
elli went to the floor with an
ankle injury that will proba
bly keep him from playing

against UCLA. Revelli is the
Cardinal's leading scorer, re
bounder, and field goal
shooter.
The Bruins beat Cal last
night 68-63 for their sixth
straight win and their 50th
straight victory over the
Bears. The win made them 5-0
in the Pac-lOand 12-1 overall.
UCLA is led by their veter
an forward tandem which is
unparalleled in collegiate
ranks. Watching six-foot-sev
en forward Kenny Fields
plav, it is scary to think he is
only a junior. Fields is averag
ing a team-high 18.7 points
and 7.8 rebounds per game
and had 19 versus Cal. The
other forward is 6-8 senior
Darren Dave, who checks in
at 16.5 points and 6.8 caroms
a game.
Rod Foster is playing his
best basketball since his
freshman season and has
finally found his place in
