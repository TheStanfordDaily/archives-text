# Anti-nuke protest held at Cal, police arrest' human blockade'
## 
### KRISTEN CHRISTOPHER Senior staff writer 
At least 95 people were arrested at
UC-Berkeley yesterday while protest
ing the university's connection with
government-supported nuclear
weapons research at the Lawrence
Livermore Laboratory.
The protesters — both students and
members of the Berkeley community
— set up a human blockade outside
University Hall, where the office of Cal
President David Saxon is located.
All of the 95 arrested protesters
were charged with blocking a sidewalk,
UC police dispatcher Deborah Chre
tien said, adding that "a few" were also
charged with resisting arrest.
Members of UC Cluster, an um
brella group that organized the protest,
said the number arrested was 107,
slightly higher than the police estimate.
They added that 10 of those were re
leased on their own recognizance.
The protest was directed at Saxon
because in his role as a UC regent he
votes on the contract for the University
of California management of the nuc
lear weapons laboratories, said Ken
Nightingale, Livermore Action Group
staff member.
The contract between UC and the
government for management of the

nuclear weapons laboratories at Los
Alamos and Livermore is a standing
contract but can be repealed.
"The university manages for the De
partment of Energy," Nightingale said.
"The university provides a cover of
legitimacy for the lab."
Nightingale said that workers can
claim to be employed by UC when they
actually work for the military.
The protest was planned during the
past two months, according to Vivian
Kendon, a member of UC Cluster.
Asked if the protesters did not realize
they might be arrested during the bloc
kade, Kendon replied, "They all plan
ned to."
The blockade wassetupat 7:30 a.m.
yesterday and all of the protesters were
herded into police vans by 11 a.m., ac
cording to Kendon. Their arraignment
is scheduled for 2 p.m. today, but its
location was not determined yesterday.
The decision as to whether it will be
held in Pleasanton, where the protes
ters are being held at the Santa Rita
Jail, or in Berkeley will be made by
state Supreme Court Justice Rose Bird
this morning, Kendon said.
Cal students and Berkeley commun
ity members opposed to UCs connec
tion with the laboratory will continue
to protest, according to Nightingale.

Opposition has been expressed for the
past five years and since UC officials
ha«a/iot responded. "I doubt whethet
they will negotiate anything," he said. '
More protesting may occur in less
than two weeks. "The next possible
thing is leafleting and picketing on Feb.
2 . . . when Livermore Lab is coming to
interview on campus," Kendon said.
Arrests have occurred in previous
protests against Livermore, but yester
day's were more numerous than in the
past, according to Nightingale. Last
year two Stanford students were ar
rested at a rally at Livermore.
Nightingale added that a protest
against Los Alamos and Livermore at
UC-Santa Barbara involved 90 to 100
arrests.
UC Cluster was organized last June
and is comprised of several student
groups, including Berkeley Students
for Peace, Progressive Student Organi
zation and Reap: The Education and
Action Project, according to Kendon.
Although the organization was
"kind of dormant" during the summer,
its members have been working ac
tively since September, Kendon said.
According to Stanford Progressive
Alliance (SPA) member Jim Steyer the
group may represent some of the ar
rested Cal students.
