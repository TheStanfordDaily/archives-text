# Revelli carried from floor
## Stanford blasts Trojans 92-74 
### STEVE ODELL Veni, Vidi, Vici 
The Stanford men's basketball
team came, saw and conquered
last night.
The Cardinal came to Maples
Pavilion, saw the foul line 45
times, and conquered the USC
Trojans 92-54 in a Pacific-10
Conference basketball victory.
There was a bittersweet feeling
in the victorv for the Cardinal,
one that raised itst:onferencc rec
ord to 2-2 and 10-4 overall. Cen
ter John Revelli went up to
partially deflect a James
McDonald jump shot and came
down with an ankle injury, forc
ing him to leave the game with
8:53 remaining and the Cardinal
leading 66-53.
Revelli's status is questionable
at present with No. 1 UCLA
knocking on Maples' door
tomorrow night, but the general
consensus is that he will not play
against the Bruins.
"We'll just play it by ear," said
Stanford coach Tom Davis.
"We'll see if there's swelling
tomorrow and if there is any, he
won't play. We'll just have to
wait and see."
Trainer Jim Liukkonen esti
mated that Revelli would be out a
week to 10 days, but refused to
make any definite prognosis, al
though the injury was not
thought to be worse than a bad
sprain.
USC coach Stan Morrison,
who saw his team drop to 3-2 in
the Pac-10 and 9-6 overall, must
have left his game films at home
in Hollywood, because despite
the success Cal experienced

Monday night in its 75-61 win
over the Cardinal when the Bears
effectively bottled up the Stan
ford offense, USC staved in a
man-to-man defense almost the
entire game.
The result, due in large part to
fine Cardinal execution and ball
control, was that USC picked up
30 fouls, sending Stanford to the
line 45 times, of which it made 38.
In contrast, the Trojans made
only 10 foul shots in 15 attempts.
USC had five more field goals in
the game.
The key to the game might
have come in the final minutes of

the first half. Stanford led 33-32
with 3:20 remaining before in
termission after Ron Holmes put
in a lav-in off a nice pass from
Jacque Hill on a 3-on-2 fast
break.
Play became sloppv as both
teams missed easv lay-ins and
then exchanged turnovers before
Keith Jones came up with a steal
and drove to the hoop, drawing a
foul from Trojan forward James
McDonald. Jones hit both foul
shots to give Stanford a five
point lead.

over Revelli that left both players
sprawled on the floor. That there
was no call on the plav incited
Davis and his argument with the
officials held plav up momentari

Stanford gained possession
and ran its "Roll" offense, run
ning time off the clock until Hill
reached in and fouled Keith
Jones with 17 seconds left. Jones
connected on both free throws
for two of his 20 points to put the
Cardinal ahead 39-34.

inside, but missed as he was in

who sped upcourt and fired a

sank a 30-footer from the left side
with two ticks on the clock, giv

The Cardinal fought back
from two earlv deficits and
grabbed the lead for good at
31-30 when Revelli put in an of
fensive rebound with 4:31 re
maining in the first half.
"Talk about a team per

were so many positive things that

who suffered a probable broken
nose) out for most of the first
half, we had to adjust our sub

out. And we got some really good
minutes right before the first half

clearly dominated inside, scoring

20 points on eight-of<nine shoot

the success Cal experienced

Monday night in its 75-61 win
over the Cardinal when the Bears
effectively bottled up the Stan

man-to-man defense almost the
entire game.
The result, due in large part to
fine Cardinal execution and ball
control, was that USC picked up
30 fouls, sending Stanford to the
line 45 times, of which it made 38.
In contrast, the Trojans made
only 10 foul shots in 15 attempts.
USC had five more field goals in
the game.

The Cardinal fought back

"Talk about a team per

were so many positive things that

nose) out for most of the first
half, we had to adjust our sub

out. And we got some really good
minutes right before the first half

and Darin Maurer in there."
Revelli, before his injury,
clearly dominated inside, scoring

20 points on eight-of<nine shoot

from the foul line. This was a
clear reversal of Monday night
against the Bears when he was
held to just three shot attempts
and seven points.
"John got in earlv foul trouble

Davis also commented on the

"And I just want them to know
