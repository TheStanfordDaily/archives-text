## One Krazy Kat 
### 
Fifteen years ago Don
Bogdan walked into a San
Jose State football game with
a bugle, a drum and a fifth of
tequila.
Bogdan sat next to a friend
and offered him his choice of
weapons. George Henderson,
who was just beginning an
other one of his nine vears at
San Jose State, reached for the
drum.
"I didn't know how to play
the bugle so I grabbed the oth
er two," Henderson said.
It was Krazv George who
started to bang that drum at
all San Jose State football
games. An appropriate
enough nickname, "but I al
ready had it."

The Sporting Muse

Krazv George was dubbed
bv judo teammates on one of
their national championship
San Jose State teams. The
judo has long been replaced
by a new passion for racquet
ball, but Krazv George keeps
his name through the 200,000
miles of traveling and the 100
or so ball games he leads
cheers at every year.
Krazv George is loud, ob
noxious, comical, serious and
calculating all at the same
time. Thick, long blond hair
circles an ever-widening bald
spot on the top of his head.
The hair flows freelv down to
his shoulders and onto one of
the hundreds of sweatshirts
and t-shirts he uses as his uni
form.
An ever-widening paunch
strains his sweat-stained
sweatshirt reminding Krazv
George of his too few racquet
ball games and his too-en
jovable life.
Krazv George loves life. He
loves what he does enough to
do it for free, but he gets paid
for it and he gets paid well.
"I live very comfortably,"
Cieorge said. "I could do this
forever. I would do this for
free, but I figure I'll have to do
this for five more vears to be
financially stable the rest of
my life."
Krazv George works for lit
erally dozens of teams all
across the continent. Last
night he sparked life into a
normallv-quiet Maples Pavil
ion crowd of 5076 that
watched the Cardinal em
barass USC 92-74.
Krazv George is a local tal
ent. He lives in the area and
has been taking the month of
January slowly since the East-
West Shrine Game last week
end. Stanford called him and
hired him for the USC and
UCLA games.

"I reallv don't know whv
they called me up. I think a
couple of administrators got
drunk."

In normal times, Krazy
George works for the Hous
ton Oilers, Minnesota Vik
ings, Oakland A's, British Co
lumbia Lions, Tampa Bay
Rowdies, Tulsa Roughnecks,
San Diego Sockers, Winnipeg
Jets, Edmonton Oilers, Van
couver Canucks "and seven
or eight other teams I can't
think of right now."
Fans love Krazy George.
He tells people to veil and they
do it because Krazv George is
very funnv and he makes peo
ple have fun when thev think
they aren't supposed to.
"The worst fan is someone
who wants to boo," Krazy
George said. "Mv job is to
make them forget about it if
it's bad and I try and get them
excited if it's good."
Players have mixed reac
tions to Krazv George.
"When Minnesota (Vik
ings) beat Dallas a couple of
weeks ago, the Viking center
sprinted 60 vards across the
Held to shake mv hand and 60
yards back. Later he told the
press it was the hardest work
out he'd had all game."
But four years ago, Krazy
(ieorge had a Houston Oiler
crowd so loud during a game
against the Pittsburgh Steelers
in the Astrodome that "Terrv
Bradshaw said his players
couldn't hear the signals and
Chuck Noll protested the
game. He said I should be
banned from the league."
Krazv George is famous
now. His face has been on tel
evision as much as Johnny
Carson's. He's danced and
screamed and banged his
drum in front of thousands of
crowds and tens of thousands
of people.
But Krazy George relates
to the working stiff. During
the USC victory celebration,
Krazy George accepted warm
handshakes from all passers
by but steered his conversa
tions toward the cops, the se
curity guards and the vendors.
He bangs himself through a
drum a year and considers it
tough work. Krazy George is
a working stiff, but he loves
his work likenooneelseinthe
world.

"When Minnesota (Vik
ings) beat Dallas a couple of
weeks ago, the Viking center
sprinted 60 vards across the
Held to shake mv hand and 60
yards back. Later he told the
press it was the hardest work
out he'd had all game."
But four years ago, Krazy
(ieorge had a Houston Oiler
crowd so loud during a game
against the Pittsburgh Steelers
in the Astrodome that "Terrv
Bradshaw said his players
couldn't hear the signals and
Chuck Noll protested the
game. He said I should be
banned from the league."
Krazv George is famous
now. His face has been on tel
evision as much as Johnny
Carson's. He's danced and
screamed and banged his
drum in front of thousands of
crowds and tens of thousands
of people.
But Krazy George relates
to the working stiff. During
the USC victory celebration,
Krazy George accepted warm
handshakes from all passers
by but steered his conversa
tions toward the cops, the se
curity guards and the vendors.
He bangs himself through a
drum a year and considers it
tough work. Krazy George is
a working stiff, but he loves
his work likenooneelseinthe
world.

Fifteen years ago Don
Bogdan walked into a San
Jose State football game with
a bugle, a drum and a fifth of
tequila.
Bogdan sat next to a friend
and offered him his choice of
weapons. George Henderson,
who was just beginning an
other one of his nine vears at
San Jose State, reached for the
drum.
"I didn't know how to play
the bugle so I grabbed the oth
er two," Henderson said.
It was Krazv George who
started to bang that drum at
all San Jose State football
games. An appropriate
enough nickname, "but I al
ready had it."

The Sporting Muse

Krazv George was dubbed
bv judo teammates on one of
their national championship
San Jose State teams. The
judo has long been replaced
by a new passion for racquet
ball, but Krazv George keeps
his name through the 200,000
miles of traveling and the 100
or so ball games he leads
cheers at every year.
Krazv George is loud, ob
noxious, comical, serious and
calculating all at the same
time. Thick, long blond hair
circles an ever-widening bald
spot on the top of his head.
The hair flows freelv down to
his shoulders and onto one of
the hundreds of sweatshirts
and t-shirts he uses as his uni
form.
An ever-widening paunch
strains his sweat-stained
sweatshirt reminding Krazv
George of his too few racquet
ball games and his too-en
jovable life.
Krazv George loves life. He
loves what he does enough to
do it for free, but he gets paid
for it and he gets paid well.
"I live very comfortably,"
Cieorge said. "I could do this
forever. I would do this for
free, but I figure I'll have to do
this for five more vears to be
financially stable the rest of
my life."
Krazv George works for lit
erally dozens of teams all
across the continent. Last
night he sparked life into a
normallv-quiet Maples Pavil
ion crowd of 5076 that
watched the Cardinal em
barass USC 92-74.
Krazv George is a local tal
ent. He lives in the area and
has been taking the month of
January slowly since the East-
West Shrine Game last week
end. Stanford called him and
hired him for the USC and
UCLA games.

"I reallv don't know whv
they called me up. I think a
couple of administrators got
drunk."

In normal times, Krazy
George works for the Hous
ton Oilers, Minnesota Vik
ings, Oakland A's, British Co
lumbia Lions, Tampa Bay
Rowdies, Tulsa Roughnecks,
San Diego Sockers, Winnipeg
Jets, Edmonton Oilers, Van
couver Canucks "and seven
or eight other teams I can't
think of right now."
Fans love Krazy George.
He tells people to veil and they
do it because Krazv George is
very funnv and he makes peo
ple have fun when thev think
they aren't supposed to.
"The worst fan is someone
who wants to boo," Krazy
George said. "Mv job is to
make them forget about it if
it's bad and I try and get them
excited if it's good."
