# Men gymnasts set for Cal
## 
### SARAH CARREL 
The University of Calgary will
also take part in the tri-meet,
which will begin at 7 p.m.
Stanford beat Cal earlier this
season in a closely-fought meet,
but this will be the first regular
season dual. Cal has come out on
top of Stanford for the past 10
years.
Veteran Jim Campanelli will
be returning after injuries that
kept him away from last week's

loss to University of Arizona.
Stanford will also find strength
from its outstanding freshmen
Jon Levy and Gary Smith, who
were first and second in last
week's all-around.
The Bears will counter with
equal threats. Randy Wikstrom
is the defending national champ
ion in the vault, as well as being
outstanding in the floor exer
cises. Tom Kratky, Paul Spinka

and Keb Buyers are also top
gymnasts who have won the all
around for Cal on different occa
sions.
Berkeley's head coach, Hal
Frey, is nervous about the meet
ing with Stanford. "Stanford re
ally has some good competition
this year," said Frey." I think the
meet will be decided by the Sth
place men on both Cal and Stan
ford's team."
The University of Calgary,
ranked as one of the top three in
Canada, will also provide stiff
competition to the Cardinal.
The women gymnasts travel to
Santa Barbara on Saturday for a
meet with UCSB. Head coach
Homer Sardina's women are led
by all-arounders Angie Barnes
and Julie Bledsoe.
