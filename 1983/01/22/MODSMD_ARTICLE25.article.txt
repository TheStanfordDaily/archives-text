# Paye day comes early for Card

### MARK ZEIGLER 
Menlo Park â€” Echoing the
words he told the Daily late
Wednesday night, prep quarter
back John Paye officially an
nounced at a press conference
yesterday afternoon he is "ver
bally committed to Stanford
pending my admission."
Speaking before reporters and
television cameras in Menlo
School's President's Dining
Room, the local star orally ex
pressed his committment to Stan
ford nearly three weeks before
the Heb. 9 national letter-of-in
tent day.
Pave said the announcement
was made yesterday in an effort
to encourage other recruits con
sidering Stanford to commit

themselves as well. He indicated
he would begin contacting some
of these prospects.
Pave's acceptance to Stanford
appears to be a mere formality
even though he has not been of
ficially notified bv the Ad
missions Office. Menlo is a high
ly-regarded private prep school
and Athletic Director Ron
Bryant estimated Paye carries a
3.7 grade point average.
The Menlo senior was a Pa
rade Magazine High School All-
America and was selected the na
tion's No. I prep quarterback by
USA Today. Brvant said Paye
may very well have been the most
heavily-recruited player in the
country this season.
"I made the decision primarily
because I asked the question,
'Where would I like to be if I
wasn't plaving football?' " he
said. Pave had narrowed his

choices to Stanford, Notre Dame
and UCLA last November.
"I could picture mvself going
to school at Stanford," he com
mented, "but I couldn't picture
mvself going to, sav, a place like
Notre Dame.
"I would like to play on a win
ning football team," he added, "
and I will do anything I can to get
Stanford to the Rose Bowl."
Pave did a lot of winning at
Menlo, especially over the last
two football seasons. In 1981 and
19X2, he led the Knights to a
19-2-1 record and consecutive
North Coast Section Division I-
A titles.
In his three years as a varsity
letterman, the six-foot-three,
190-pound senior broke or tied
two national and eight state prep
records. Mis 555 career pass com
pletions shattered the national
high school mark held by Joe

l-erguson of the NHL's Buffalo
Bills.
Stanford's football office was
pleased with Pave's decision.
Both Offensive Coordinator Jim
I assel and Keciever Coach Dave
Oltmar have indicated Pave has
the potential to he a four-year
starter here.
"Realistically, I think I will
redshirt this season," Pave said,
referring to the athletic practice
that would allow him to retain all
four years of eligibility after his
freshman vear.
"Coach (Paul) Wiggin told me
to 'Go for it'mv freshman year,"
he continued. "But as a
freshman, I don't think you can
compete on the college level.
"As a quarterback, I think you
need an extra vear since the tran
sition from high school to college
is so great."
