Reagan predicts economic upturn
Washington — President Reagan, who swept into office promising pros
perity and balanced budgets, observed the midpoint of his term yesterday
contending the nation was entering "a season of hope" even if economic re
covery has so far proved elusive.
Reagan offered a personal appraisal of his stewardship "in the first term"
— he has vet to officially announce he'll seek a second — during an im
promptu appearance in the White House press room on the second an
niversary of his inauguration.
After two years in office, Reagan continued to blame the state of the econ

case, the biggest surprise was finding out that they were even worse. And it's
a real human tragedy that so manv of our people today are still suffering
from the political mistakes of the past that we've finally started to correct.''
Reagan said he foresaw "an American economy and an America on the
mend." He laid out no timetable for how long it would take to heal the coun
try's economic ailments.
Reagan said "nearlv everv economic indicator shows us heading into re
covery." but he did not mention that unemployment has increased from 7.4
percent when he took office to 10.8 percent last month.
Nor did Reagan, who had promised a balanced budget by 1983, say any
thing about the high deficits in his budgets. The fiscal year 1984 deficit is
expected to be about SI9O billion. Aides now say Reagan is aiming for a bal
anced budget bv the end of the decade.
After Reagn's appearance, Democratic National Chairman Charles Man

ness and mismanagement, and suggesting the Republican president was
seeing things differently from the rest of the country.
