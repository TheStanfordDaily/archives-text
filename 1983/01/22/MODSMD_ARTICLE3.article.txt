Reagan predicts economic upturn
Washington — President Reagan, who swept into office promising pros
perity and balanced budgets, observed the midpoint of his term yesterday
contending the nation was entering "a season of hope" even if economic re
covery has so far proved elusive.
Reagan offered a personal appraisal of his stewardship "in the first term"
— he has vet to officially announce he'll seek a second — during an im
promptu appearance in the White House press room on the second an
niversary of his inauguration.
After two years in office, Reagan continued to blame the state of the econ
omy, at its worst since World War 11, on his predecessors. "This recession
had been coming on for several vears and gradually growing worse," he said.
Recalling that when John F. Kennedy took office he was surprised to Hnd
that things were as bad as he had been saying they were, Reagan said: "In my
case, the biggest surprise was finding out that they were even worse. And it's
a real human tragedy that so manv of our people today are still suffering
from the political mistakes of the past that we've finally started to correct.''
Reagan said he foresaw "an American economy and an America on the
mend." He laid out no timetable for how long it would take to heal the coun
try's economic ailments.
Reagan said "nearlv everv economic indicator shows us heading into re
covery." but he did not mention that unemployment has increased from 7.4
percent when he took office to 10.8 percent last month.
Nor did Reagan, who had promised a balanced budget by 1983, say any
thing about the high deficits in his budgets. The fiscal year 1984 deficit is
expected to be about SI9O billion. Aides now say Reagan is aiming for a bal
anced budget bv the end of the decade.
After Reagn's appearance, Democratic National Chairman Charles Man
att issued a response saving Reagan had put the nation on a course of unfair
ness and mismanagement, and suggesting the Republican president was
seeing things differently from the rest of the country.
Reagan speaks on missile deployment
Washington — Escalating the war of words surrounding U.S.-Soviet nu
clear arms negotiations. President Reagan said yesterday that the Soviet
Union is demanding "the right to maintain enough intermediate-range nu-
clear warheads to literally hit every population center in
Europe, but thev don't want a single weapon of a de
terrent nature to he there on the other side."
Reagan's statement was made to reporters as he ap
peared in the White House press room to take note of his
second anniversary in office. But the president was clear
ly addressing voters in West Germany, where the planned
deployment of U.S. Pershing 2 ballistic missiles and nu
clear-armed cruise missiles has become a focal point of
the upcoming national election.
With Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Ciromyko visit
ing Germany and Soviet Communist Party leader Yuri
Andropov taking every opportunity to sieze the initiative
in the public debate over arms control, the Reagan ad
ministration has stepped up efforts to avoid the ap
pearance of inflexibility while sticking with the "zero op
tion" plan that Reagan proposed for Europe last year.
Asked whether there is any flexibility in the U.S. nego
tiating stance, inasmuch as the Soviets have flatly rejected
the zero-option formula, Reagan replied, "You can't talk
openly about strategy or tactics. We have said that we be
lieve the best solution for both of us is zero zero, but we
have said that we will listen to and negotiate any fair pro
posals that are made.
"There is no question that their goal is, whatever they
do, they do not want us to implement the plan of placing
even one of those missiles on European soil. We are just
as determined that we are going to stay on schedule with
that."
Under the zero option plan proposed in November
1981, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization would
cancel the planned deployment of the 464 ground
launched cruise missiles and 108 Pershing 2 ballistic mis
siles in Europe in exchange for the Soviet dismantlement
of some 333 SS-20 ballistic missiles, each armed with
three nuclear warheads and most of them targeted on
Western Europe.
In another sign of apprehension about Moscow's
propaganda blitz, the State Department confirmed that
Peter Dailev, the U.S. ambassador to Ireland and the
1980 advertising manager for the Reagan presidential
campaign, has been tapped to "help strengthen com
munications with Europe." Spokesman John Hughes
also said a high-level inter-agency committee had been
formed "to coordinate the U.S. government's policies
and activities in the area of public diplomacy."
Soviets nix interim solution
Moscow — The Soviet news agency Tass last night car
ried an article rejecting the so-called "interim solution"
that has gained popularity among some Western Europe
an policy-makers as a way of resolving the current East-
West impasse over intermediate-range nuclear missiles in
Europe.
Tass said the "intermediate agreement" was "absolute
ly unacceptable to the Soviet Union" and hinted that any
deployment of new American medium-range missiles in
Western Europe could lead to the collapse of the Geneva
negotiations.
The "interim solution" calls for each side to maintain a
small number of medium-range missiles if total elimina
tion of all such missiles cannot be achieved this year in the
U.S.-Soviet discussions currently under way in Geneva.
This would enable the United States to proceed with
plans to deploy some of the medium-range missiles this
year, a move Moscow opposes as a threat to its security.
The article distributed by Tass said that West German
Foreign Minister Hans Genscher and British Foreign
Secretary Francis Pvm were proponents of this idea.
"The placement of the first Pershing 2 on West Ger
man territory and the first cruise missile in Sicily creates a
new situation," it said.
"The Geneva talks on nuclear armaments in Europe
would become deprived of the realistic basis upon which
they are now being conducted if only because the Soviet
Union would be forced to take immediate measures to re
store the balance which had been disturbed in order to

ensure for itself and its allies security equal to that of the
NATO countries."
Lebanon rejects Israeli demand
Kirvat Shmona, Israel — Lebanon yesterday rejected
Israel's demand to operate electronic spy stations on Leb
anese soil, and U.S. envoy Philip Habib was reported
working on a compromise proposal for listening posts
manned bv Americans.
Negotiators clashed over the Israeli demand but did
agree to form four committees, including one to draw up
a timetable for evacuating foreign armies from Lebanon.
A joint statement after the eighth round of talks said
"good progress was made."
But officials attending the U.S.-mediated negotiations
said no attempt was made to bridge differences over Is
rael's conditions for leaving Lebanon, which it invaded
June 6 to smash the Palestine Liberation Organization.
The joint statement said committees were created "to
enter into detailed examination" of the topics on the
agenda: withdrawal, security arrangements, future Is
raeli-Lebanese relations and possible guarantees of the
final agreement.
A fifth committee was formed previously to formulate
a declaration ending the 34-year-old formal state of war
between Lebanon and Israel, completing the roster of
agenda items.
Habib, ordered by President Reagan to help speed up
the talks, waited in Jerusalem for a report, and planned to
meet todav with Israeli Foreign Minister Yitzhak
Shamir.
Habib met Shamir and the Israeli delegations three
times this week to try to whittle down the Israeli demands
and develop new ideas.
Nakasone backs U.S. trade rights
Washington — Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone
Hew back to Tokyo yesterday to face a battle in Par
liament over his decision to allow the United States to ob
tain Japanese technology for military uses.
The controversial decision, made three days before
Nakasone began his trip to the United States, was an ex
emption from a 16-year-old Japanese policy ban on ex
ports of weapons.
Late Wednesday night, after attending a dinner at the
Japanese ambassador's residence for 16 American busi
ness and labor leaders, Nakasone was questioned by re
porters traveling with him about how he intended to deal
with the opposition parties. Nakasone rejected charges
that the exemption approved by his Cabinet last Friday
conflicted with a parliamentary resolution banning
weapons exports. Only the interpretation of it — to allow
the United States, which provides a security guarantee to
Japan, to obtain military technology — has been
changed, he insisted.
Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger, after a meet
ing with Nakasone here Tuesday, praised Nakasone's de
cision as "a politically courageous act."
In June 1981, Weinberger asked Japan to reciprocate
for the flow of military technology Japan has received
from the United States since the mid-19505. The Japanese
administration led bv Prime Minister Zenko Suzuki re
fused to act on the request, however.
Suzuki himself was reliably reported to have opposed
providing military technology because of Japan's com
mitment to a peace-oriented foreign policy.
Japan's leading opposition group, the Socialist Party,
which advocates a policy of unarmed neutralism, and the
Communists, also opposed any concession to the United
States, and both parties are now leading the attack on
Nakasone.
Brown attacks protective trade laws
Washington — Former California Gov. Edmund
Brown departed sharply from growing Democratic doc
trine yesterday assailing trade protection legislation that
he said is "scapegoating" the Japanese.

"The scapegoating of Japan is very dangerous from
both an economic and security point of view .... I believe
the Japanese are being scapegoated for what we ought to
be doing ourselves," Brown told the Senate Finance sub
committee on investment policy.
Subcommittee Chairman John Chafec (R-R.1.) noting
that several Democratic presidential candidates had
taken protectionist stands, said he agreed with Brown.
Among Democratic candidates who have taken pro
tectionist positions are Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.)
and former Vice President Walter Mondale.
Brown said Japan is "producing a better industrializa
tion policy and therefore better autos." Trying to force
Japan to take more U.S. imports could drive the Japanese
closer to the Chinese and Russians, he said.
"Instead of responding (to a flood of Japanese im
ports) with trade barriers," Brown said, the United States
should find wavs to improve its own industrial produc
tion.
Brown called for changes in banking and pension laws
that would make pension funds available for investment.
He suggested that I percent of pension funds be made
availabled for use as venture capital and 3 percent to 5
percent for investment in high-growth companies.
Social Security reform proposed
Washington — The National Commission on Social
Security Reform sent President Reagan yesterday its
Sl6B billion blueprint for pulling the system back from
the brink of a financial crisis that threatens to delay re
tirees' checks this summer.
A majority also recommended gradually raising the
normal retirement age from 65 to 66. If Congress ap
proves, everyone bom since 1938 would be affected.
The change would be phased in one month a year so
that those born in 1949 or later would have to wait until
age 66 to draw full Social Security benefits. The retire
ment age also eventually would go up automatically with
any gains in life expectancy.
That was not part of the compromise rescue plan that
President Reagan and House Speaker Thomas O'Neill
endorsed Saturday night after the pact was approved by
12 of the commission's 15 members.
The centerpiece of the plan is a six-month delay in this
July's cost-of-living increase for Social Security's 36 mil
lion beneficiaries; higher payroll taxes in 1984, 1988 and
1989 for employees and employers; a permanently higher
payroll tax on the self-employed starting in 1984; taxa
tion of one-half of benefits for middle-and upper-income
retirees; and bringing all new federal workers and non
profit groups in the system next year.
The payroll tax would jump from the current 6.7 per
cent to 7 percent on Jan. 1. For 1984 only, workers would
get a tax credit against their income taxes to cushion them
from paying any extra tax overall.
California's credit future unclear
Sacramento — State officials waited anxiously yester
day for word of whether one of the nation's top two bond
rating firms will downgrade California's credit rating —
and if so, bv how much.
The nation's largest brokerage firm, Merrill, Lynch,
Pierce, Fenner & Smith Inc., downgraded California's
rating in an internal memorandum made public yester
day.
But most state officials viewed a review by Standard &
Poor's as having the greatest impact on the state's ability
to continue to borrow or sell bonds at acceptable rates.
The decision could cost the state millions of dollars in
higher interest payments.
Standard & Poor's, one of the two major firms that
rate the credit-worthiness of government agencies, has
had California on a "credit watch" since state tax reven
ues started falling behind estimates and the deficit — now
projected at $1.5 billion or more — started to grow last
fall.
After meetings in New York earlier this week with top
state fiscal officers, Standard & Poor's officials were re

viewing California's credit rating in an all-day closed
door session vesterdav. But there was no indication when
a ruling would he made.
California lost its "AAA" rating after Proposition 13
cut property taxes 4 vearsago, but has held an "AA-plus"
rating since then, a rating exceeded by only 12 of the other
49 states.
Among possible actions discussed by state officials if
the deficit continues and the state's credit rating plunges
is the issuance of registered warrants instead of checks to
state employees, local governments and taxpayers receiv
ing state income tax refunds.
Satellite unlikely to hit U.S.
Washington — The Pentagon estimated yesterday a 2
percent chance that debris from a disabled nuclear-pow
ered Soviet spy satellite will hit the United States after en
tering the atmosphere sometime between early Sunday
and Monday afternoon.
Spokesman Henry Catto told reporters that experts
have predicted the re-entry of the satellite, which carries a
nuclear reactor, sometime between I a.m. EST Sunday
and 3 p.m. EST Monday.
However, space experts said the Cosmos 1402, which
has been tumbling toward earth at an ever-increasing
rate, may plunge into the atmosphere late Sunday night.
Experts state there is a 70 percent chance the Cosmos
debris will come down over water, 15 percent chance over
the Soviet Union, 3 percent chance over Canada and 2
percent chance over the United States.
The Cosmos 1402 was launched from the Soviet Union
on Aug. 30. U.S. experts detected problems with it after
the Soviets failed in an effort to separate the 1,000-pound
reactor section from the rest of the spaceship and to send
it into a "parking orbit" where its more than 100 pounds
of radioactive materials would stay safely in space for 500
years or longer.
The satellite began tumbling and one part broke away.
The remainder of the space vehicle, along with a small un
identified piece traveling with it, has been descending in
orbit since.
Volcker cautions on spending
Washington — Federal Reserve Chairman Paul
Volcker warned yesterday night that the prospect of huge
continuing budget deficits is keeping interest rates high,
while their realization could bar a sustained economic re
covery.
Volcker said the fiscal 1983 deficit could end up equal
to 6 percent of the gross national product, well above the
previous 4 percent peak, with between one-half and two
thirds of the red ink due to the recession.
Lowering the deficits would, "in and of itself. . . have
favorable effects on current interest rates and in damping
concerns about future increases," he declared.
Stocks post small overall gain
Energy issues and Apple Computer shares were the
standout performers as the stock market posted a small
overall gain yesterday.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which had
fallen 16.75 points in the last two sessions, edged up 2.76
to 1,070.82.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange totaled
82.79 million shares, against 80.90 million Wednesday.
Apple was bv far the day's most active issue, climbing
3'/2 to 37'/h bid in the over-the-counter market, with more
than 3.1 million shares changing hands. That marked a
new high for the stock since the company went public at
$22 a share in December of 1980.
Today's weather
Variable clouds with chance of showers this afternoon.
Partly cloudy with occasional showers tomorrow. Lows
in the 40s, highs in the mid-50's.

Reagan predicts economic upturn
Washington — President Reagan, who swept into office promising pros
perity and balanced budgets, observed the midpoint of his term yesterday
contending the nation was entering "a season of hope" even if economic re
covery has so far proved elusive.
Reagan offered a personal appraisal of his stewardship "in the first term"
— he has vet to officially announce he'll seek a second — during an im
promptu appearance in the White House press room on the second an
niversary of his inauguration.
After two years in office, Reagan continued to blame the state of the econ
omy, at its worst since World War 11, on his predecessors. "This recession
had been coming on for several vears and gradually growing worse," he said.
Recalling that when John F. Kennedy took office he was surprised to Hnd
that things were as bad as he had been saying they were, Reagan said: "In my
case, the biggest surprise was finding out that they were even worse. And it's
a real human tragedy that so manv of our people today are still suffering
from the political mistakes of the past that we've finally started to correct.''
Reagan said he foresaw "an American economy and an America on the
mend." He laid out no timetable for how long it would take to heal the coun
try's economic ailments.
Reagan said "nearlv everv economic indicator shows us heading into re
covery." but he did not mention that unemployment has increased from 7.4
percent when he took office to 10.8 percent last month.
Nor did Reagan, who had promised a balanced budget by 1983, say any
thing about the high deficits in his budgets. The fiscal year 1984 deficit is
expected to be about SI9O billion. Aides now say Reagan is aiming for a bal
anced budget bv the end of the decade.
After Reagn's appearance, Democratic National Chairman Charles Man
att issued a response saving Reagan had put the nation on a course of unfair
ness and mismanagement, and suggesting the Republican president was
seeing things differently from the rest of the country.
Reagan speaks on missile deployment
Washington — Escalating the war of words surrounding U.S.-Soviet nu
clear arms negotiations. President Reagan said yesterday that the Soviet
Union is demanding "the right to maintain enough intermediate-range nu-
clear warheads to literally hit every population center in
Europe, but thev don't want a single weapon of a de
terrent nature to he there on the other side."
Reagan's statement was made to reporters as he ap
peared in the White House press room to take note of his
second anniversary in office. But the president was clear
ly addressing voters in West Germany, where the planned
deployment of U.S. Pershing 2 ballistic missiles and nu
clear-armed cruise missiles has become a focal point of
the upcoming national election.
With Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Ciromyko visit
ing Germany and Soviet Communist Party leader Yuri
Andropov taking every opportunity to sieze the initiative
in the public debate over arms control, the Reagan ad
ministration has stepped up efforts to avoid the ap
pearance of inflexibility while sticking with the "zero op
tion" plan that Reagan proposed for Europe last year.
Asked whether there is any flexibility in the U.S. nego
tiating stance, inasmuch as the Soviets have flatly rejected
the zero-option formula, Reagan replied, "You can't talk
openly about strategy or tactics. We have said that we be
lieve the best solution for both of us is zero zero, but we
have said that we will listen to and negotiate any fair pro
posals that are made.
"There is no question that their goal is, whatever they
do, they do not want us to implement the plan of placing
even one of those missiles on European soil. We are just
as determined that we are going to stay on schedule with
that."
Under the zero option plan proposed in November
1981, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization would
cancel the planned deployment of the 464 ground
launched cruise missiles and 108 Pershing 2 ballistic mis
siles in Europe in exchange for the Soviet dismantlement
of some 333 SS-20 ballistic missiles, each armed with
three nuclear warheads and most of them targeted on
Western Europe.
In another sign of apprehension about Moscow's
propaganda blitz, the State Department confirmed that
Peter Dailev, the U.S. ambassador to Ireland and the
1980 advertising manager for the Reagan presidential
campaign, has been tapped to "help strengthen com
munications with Europe." Spokesman John Hughes
also said a high-level inter-agency committee had been
formed "to coordinate the U.S. government's policies
and activities in the area of public diplomacy."
Soviets nix interim solution
Moscow — The Soviet news agency Tass last night car
ried an article rejecting the so-called "interim solution"
that has gained popularity among some Western Europe
an policy-makers as a way of resolving the current East-
West impasse over intermediate-range nuclear missiles in
Europe.
Tass said the "intermediate agreement" was "absolute
ly unacceptable to the Soviet Union" and hinted that any
deployment of new American medium-range missiles in
Western Europe could lead to the collapse of the Geneva
negotiations.
The "interim solution" calls for each side to maintain a
small number of medium-range missiles if total elimina
tion of all such missiles cannot be achieved this year in the
U.S.-Soviet discussions currently under way in Geneva.
This would enable the United States to proceed with
plans to deploy some of the medium-range missiles this
year, a move Moscow opposes as a threat to its security.
The article distributed by Tass said that West German
Foreign Minister Hans Genscher and British Foreign
Secretary Francis Pvm were proponents of this idea.
"The placement of the first Pershing 2 on West Ger
man territory and the first cruise missile in Sicily creates a
new situation," it said.
"The Geneva talks on nuclear armaments in Europe
would become deprived of the realistic basis upon which
they are now being conducted if only because the Soviet
Union would be forced to take immediate measures to re
store the balance which had been disturbed in order to

ensure for itself and its allies security equal to that of the
NATO countries."
Lebanon rejects Israeli demand
Kirvat Shmona, Israel — Lebanon yesterday rejected
Israel's demand to operate electronic spy stations on Leb
anese soil, and U.S. envoy Philip Habib was reported
working on a compromise proposal for listening posts
manned bv Americans.
Negotiators clashed over the Israeli demand but did
agree to form four committees, including one to draw up
a timetable for evacuating foreign armies from Lebanon.
A joint statement after the eighth round of talks said
"good progress was made."
But officials attending the U.S.-mediated negotiations
said no attempt was made to bridge differences over Is
rael's conditions for leaving Lebanon, which it invaded
June 6 to smash the Palestine Liberation Organization.
The joint statement said committees were created "to
enter into detailed examination" of the topics on the
agenda: withdrawal, security arrangements, future Is
raeli-Lebanese relations and possible guarantees of the
final agreement.
A fifth committee was formed previously to formulate
a declaration ending the 34-year-old formal state of war
between Lebanon and Israel, completing the roster of
agenda items.
Habib, ordered by President Reagan to help speed up
the talks, waited in Jerusalem for a report, and planned to
meet todav with Israeli Foreign Minister Yitzhak
Shamir.
Habib met Shamir and the Israeli delegations three
times this week to try to whittle down the Israeli demands
and develop new ideas.
Nakasone backs U.S. trade rights
Washington — Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone
Hew back to Tokyo yesterday to face a battle in Par
liament over his decision to allow the United States to ob
tain Japanese technology for military uses.
The controversial decision, made three days before
Nakasone began his trip to the United States, was an ex
emption from a 16-year-old Japanese policy ban on ex
ports of weapons.
Late Wednesday night, after attending a dinner at the
Japanese ambassador's residence for 16 American busi
ness and labor leaders, Nakasone was questioned by re
porters traveling with him about how he intended to deal
with the opposition parties. Nakasone rejected charges
that the exemption approved by his Cabinet last Friday
conflicted with a parliamentary resolution banning
weapons exports. Only the interpretation of it — to allow
the United States, which provides a security guarantee to
Japan, to obtain military technology — has been
changed, he insisted.
Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger, after a meet
ing with Nakasone here Tuesday, praised Nakasone's de
cision as "a politically courageous act."
In June 1981, Weinberger asked Japan to reciprocate
for the flow of military technology Japan has received
from the United States since the mid-19505. The Japanese
administration led bv Prime Minister Zenko Suzuki re
fused to act on the request, however.
Suzuki himself was reliably reported to have opposed
providing military technology because of Japan's com
mitment to a peace-oriented foreign policy.
Japan's leading opposition group, the Socialist Party,
which advocates a policy of unarmed neutralism, and the
Communists, also opposed any concession to the United
States, and both parties are now leading the attack on
Nakasone.
Brown attacks protective trade laws
Washington — Former California Gov. Edmund
Brown departed sharply from growing Democratic doc
trine yesterday assailing trade protection legislation that
he said is "scapegoating" the Japanese.

"The scapegoating of Japan is very dangerous from
both an economic and security point of view .... I believe
the Japanese are being scapegoated for what we ought to
be doing ourselves," Brown told the Senate Finance sub
committee on investment policy.
Subcommittee Chairman John Chafec (R-R.1.) noting
that several Democratic presidential candidates had
taken protectionist stands, said he agreed with Brown.
Among Democratic candidates who have taken pro
tectionist positions are Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.)
and former Vice President Walter Mondale.
Brown said Japan is "producing a better industrializa
tion policy and therefore better autos." Trying to force
Japan to take more U.S. imports could drive the Japanese
closer to the Chinese and Russians, he said.
"Instead of responding (to a flood of Japanese im
ports) with trade barriers," Brown said, the United States
should find wavs to improve its own industrial produc
tion.
Brown called for changes in banking and pension laws
that would make pension funds available for investment.
He suggested that I percent of pension funds be made
availabled for use as venture capital and 3 percent to 5
percent for investment in high-growth companies.
Social Security reform proposed
Washington — The National Commission on Social
Security Reform sent President Reagan yesterday its
Sl6B billion blueprint for pulling the system back from
the brink of a financial crisis that threatens to delay re
tirees' checks this summer.
A majority also recommended gradually raising the
normal retirement age from 65 to 66. If Congress ap
proves, everyone bom since 1938 would be affected.
The change would be phased in one month a year so
that those born in 1949 or later would have to wait until
age 66 to draw full Social Security benefits. The retire
ment age also eventually would go up automatically with
any gains in life expectancy.
That was not part of the compromise rescue plan that
President Reagan and House Speaker Thomas O'Neill
endorsed Saturday night after the pact was approved by
12 of the commission's 15 members.
The centerpiece of the plan is a six-month delay in this
July's cost-of-living increase for Social Security's 36 mil
lion beneficiaries; higher payroll taxes in 1984, 1988 and
1989 for employees and employers; a permanently higher
payroll tax on the self-employed starting in 1984; taxa
tion of one-half of benefits for middle-and upper-income
retirees; and bringing all new federal workers and non
profit groups in the system next year.
The payroll tax would jump from the current 6.7 per
cent to 7 percent on Jan. 1. For 1984 only, workers would
get a tax credit against their income taxes to cushion them
from paying any extra tax overall.
California's credit future unclear
Sacramento — State officials waited anxiously yester
day for word of whether one of the nation's top two bond
rating firms will downgrade California's credit rating —
and if so, bv how much.
The nation's largest brokerage firm, Merrill, Lynch,
Pierce, Fenner & Smith Inc., downgraded California's
rating in an internal memorandum made public yester
day.
But most state officials viewed a review by Standard &
Poor's as having the greatest impact on the state's ability
to continue to borrow or sell bonds at acceptable rates.
The decision could cost the state millions of dollars in
higher interest payments.
Standard & Poor's, one of the two major firms that
rate the credit-worthiness of government agencies, has
had California on a "credit watch" since state tax reven
ues started falling behind estimates and the deficit — now
projected at $1.5 billion or more — started to grow last
fall.
After meetings in New York earlier this week with top
state fiscal officers, Standard & Poor's officials were re

viewing California's credit rating in an all-day closed
door session vesterdav. But there was no indication when
a ruling would he made.
California lost its "AAA" rating after Proposition 13
cut property taxes 4 vearsago, but has held an "AA-plus"
rating since then, a rating exceeded by only 12 of the other
49 states.
Among possible actions discussed by state officials if
the deficit continues and the state's credit rating plunges
is the issuance of registered warrants instead of checks to
state employees, local governments and taxpayers receiv
ing state income tax refunds.
Satellite unlikely to hit U.S.
Washington — The Pentagon estimated yesterday a 2
percent chance that debris from a disabled nuclear-pow
ered Soviet spy satellite will hit the United States after en
tering the atmosphere sometime between early Sunday
and Monday afternoon.
Spokesman Henry Catto told reporters that experts
have predicted the re-entry of the satellite, which carries a
nuclear reactor, sometime between I a.m. EST Sunday
and 3 p.m. EST Monday.
However, space experts said the Cosmos 1402, which
has been tumbling toward earth at an ever-increasing
rate, may plunge into the atmosphere late Sunday night.
Experts state there is a 70 percent chance the Cosmos
debris will come down over water, 15 percent chance over
the Soviet Union, 3 percent chance over Canada and 2
percent chance over the United States.
The Cosmos 1402 was launched from the Soviet Union
on Aug. 30. U.S. experts detected problems with it after
the Soviets failed in an effort to separate the 1,000-pound
reactor section from the rest of the spaceship and to send
it into a "parking orbit" where its more than 100 pounds
of radioactive materials would stay safely in space for 500
years or longer.
The satellite began tumbling and one part broke away.
The remainder of the space vehicle, along with a small un
identified piece traveling with it, has been descending in
orbit since.
Volcker cautions on spending
Washington — Federal Reserve Chairman Paul
Volcker warned yesterday night that the prospect of huge
continuing budget deficits is keeping interest rates high,
while their realization could bar a sustained economic re
covery.
Volcker said the fiscal 1983 deficit could end up equal
to 6 percent of the gross national product, well above the
previous 4 percent peak, with between one-half and two
thirds of the red ink due to the recession.
Lowering the deficits would, "in and of itself. . . have
favorable effects on current interest rates and in damping
concerns about future increases," he declared.

Volcker cautions on spending
Washington — Federal Reserve Chairman Paul
Volcker warned yesterday night that the prospect of huge
continuing budget deficits is keeping interest rates high,
while their realization could bar a sustained economic re
covery.
Volcker said the fiscal 1983 deficit could end up equal
to 6 percent of the gross national product, well above the
previous 4 percent peak, with between one-half and two
thirds of the red ink due to the recession.
Lowering the deficits would, "in and of itself. . . have
favorable effects on current interest rates and in damping
concerns about future increases," he declared.

Reagan predicts economic upturn
Washington — President Reagan, who swept into office promising pros
perity and balanced budgets, observed the midpoint of his term yesterday
contending the nation was entering "a season of hope" even if economic re
covery has so far proved elusive.
Reagan offered a personal appraisal of his stewardship "in the first term"
— he has vet to officially announce he'll seek a second — during an im
promptu appearance in the White House press room on the second an
niversary of his inauguration.
After two years in office, Reagan continued to blame the state of the econ
omy, at its worst since World War 11, on his predecessors. "This recession
had been coming on for several vears and gradually growing worse," he said.
Recalling that when John F. Kennedy took office he was surprised to Hnd
that things were as bad as he had been saying they were, Reagan said: "In my
case, the biggest surprise was finding out that they were even worse. And it's
a real human tragedy that so manv of our people today are still suffering
from the political mistakes of the past that we've finally started to correct.''
Reagan said he foresaw "an American economy and an America on the
mend." He laid out no timetable for how long it would take to heal the coun
try's economic ailments.
Reagan said "nearlv everv economic indicator shows us heading into re
covery." but he did not mention that unemployment has increased from 7.4
percent when he took office to 10.8 percent last month.
Nor did Reagan, who had promised a balanced budget by 1983, say any
thing about the high deficits in his budgets. The fiscal year 1984 deficit is
expected to be about SI9O billion. Aides now say Reagan is aiming for a bal
anced budget bv the end of the decade.
After Reagn's appearance, Democratic National Chairman Charles Man
att issued a response saving Reagan had put the nation on a course of unfair
ness and mismanagement, and suggesting the Republican president was
seeing things differently from the rest of the country.
Reagan speaks on missile deployment
Washington — Escalating the war of words surrounding U.S.-Soviet nu
clear arms negotiations. President Reagan said yesterday that the Soviet
Union is demanding "the right to maintain enough intermediate-range nu-
clear warheads to literally hit every population center in
Europe, but thev don't want a single weapon of a de
terrent nature to he there on the other side."
Reagan's statement was made to reporters as he ap
peared in the White House press room to take note of his
second anniversary in office. But the president was clear
ly addressing voters in West Germany, where the planned
deployment of U.S. Pershing 2 ballistic missiles and nu
clear-armed cruise missiles has become a focal point of
the upcoming national election.
With Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Ciromyko visit
ing Germany and Soviet Communist Party leader Yuri
Andropov taking every opportunity to sieze the initiative
in the public debate over arms control, the Reagan ad
ministration has stepped up efforts to avoid the ap
pearance of inflexibility while sticking with the "zero op
tion" plan that Reagan proposed for Europe last year.
Asked whether there is any flexibility in the U.S. nego
tiating stance, inasmuch as the Soviets have flatly rejected
the zero-option formula, Reagan replied, "You can't talk
openly about strategy or tactics. We have said that we be
lieve the best solution for both of us is zero zero, but we
have said that we will listen to and negotiate any fair pro
posals that are made.
"There is no question that their goal is, whatever they
do, they do not want us to implement the plan of placing
even one of those missiles on European soil. We are just
as determined that we are going to stay on schedule with
that."
Under the zero option plan proposed in November
1981, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization would
cancel the planned deployment of the 464 ground
launched cruise missiles and 108 Pershing 2 ballistic mis
siles in Europe in exchange for the Soviet dismantlement
of some 333 SS-20 ballistic missiles, each armed with
three nuclear warheads and most of them targeted on
Western Europe.
In another sign of apprehension about Moscow's
propaganda blitz, the State Department confirmed that
Peter Dailev, the U.S. ambassador to Ireland and the
1980 advertising manager for the Reagan presidential
campaign, has been tapped to "help strengthen com
munications with Europe." Spokesman John Hughes
also said a high-level inter-agency committee had been
formed "to coordinate the U.S. government's policies
and activities in the area of public diplomacy."
Soviets nix interim solution
Moscow — The Soviet news agency Tass last night car
ried an article rejecting the so-called "interim solution"
that has gained popularity among some Western Europe
an policy-makers as a way of resolving the current East-
West impasse over intermediate-range nuclear missiles in
Europe.
Tass said the "intermediate agreement" was "absolute
ly unacceptable to the Soviet Union" and hinted that any
deployment of new American medium-range missiles in
Western Europe could lead to the collapse of the Geneva
negotiations.
The "interim solution" calls for each side to maintain a
small number of medium-range missiles if total elimina
tion of all such missiles cannot be achieved this year in the
U.S.-Soviet discussions currently under way in Geneva.
This would enable the United States to proceed with
plans to deploy some of the medium-range missiles this
year, a move Moscow opposes as a threat to its security.
The article distributed by Tass said that West German
Foreign Minister Hans Genscher and British Foreign
Secretary Francis Pvm were proponents of this idea.
"The placement of the first Pershing 2 on West Ger
man territory and the first cruise missile in Sicily creates a
new situation," it said.
"The Geneva talks on nuclear armaments in Europe
would become deprived of the realistic basis upon which
they are now being conducted if only because the Soviet
Union would be forced to take immediate measures to re
store the balance which had been disturbed in order to

ensure for itself and its allies security equal to that of the
NATO countries."
Lebanon rejects Israeli demand
Kirvat Shmona, Israel — Lebanon yesterday rejected
Israel's demand to operate electronic spy stations on Leb
anese soil, and U.S. envoy Philip Habib was reported
working on a compromise proposal for listening posts
manned bv Americans.
Negotiators clashed over the Israeli demand but did
agree to form four committees, including one to draw up
a timetable for evacuating foreign armies from Lebanon.
A joint statement after the eighth round of talks said
"good progress was made."
But officials attending the U.S.-mediated negotiations
said no attempt was made to bridge differences over Is
rael's conditions for leaving Lebanon, which it invaded
June 6 to smash the Palestine Liberation Organization.
The joint statement said committees were created "to
enter into detailed examination" of the topics on the
agenda: withdrawal, security arrangements, future Is
raeli-Lebanese relations and possible guarantees of the
final agreement.
A fifth committee was formed previously to formulate
a declaration ending the 34-year-old formal state of war
between Lebanon and Israel, completing the roster of
agenda items.
Habib, ordered by President Reagan to help speed up
the talks, waited in Jerusalem for a report, and planned to
meet todav with Israeli Foreign Minister Yitzhak
Shamir.
Habib met Shamir and the Israeli delegations three
times this week to try to whittle down the Israeli demands
and develop new ideas.
Nakasone backs U.S. trade rights
Washington — Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone
Hew back to Tokyo yesterday to face a battle in Par
liament over his decision to allow the United States to ob
tain Japanese technology for military uses.
The controversial decision, made three days before
Nakasone began his trip to the United States, was an ex
emption from a 16-year-old Japanese policy ban on ex
ports of weapons.
Late Wednesday night, after attending a dinner at the
Japanese ambassador's residence for 16 American busi
ness and labor leaders, Nakasone was questioned by re
porters traveling with him about how he intended to deal
with the opposition parties. Nakasone rejected charges
that the exemption approved by his Cabinet last Friday
conflicted with a parliamentary resolution banning
weapons exports. Only the interpretation of it — to allow
the United States, which provides a security guarantee to
Japan, to obtain military technology — has been
changed, he insisted.
Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger, after a meet
ing with Nakasone here Tuesday, praised Nakasone's de
cision as "a politically courageous act."
In June 1981, Weinberger asked Japan to reciprocate
for the flow of military technology Japan has received
from the United States since the mid-19505. The Japanese
administration led bv Prime Minister Zenko Suzuki re
fused to act on the request, however.
Suzuki himself was reliably reported to have opposed
providing military technology because of Japan's com
mitment to a peace-oriented foreign policy.
Japan's leading opposition group, the Socialist Party,
which advocates a policy of unarmed neutralism, and the
Communists, also opposed any concession to the United
States, and both parties are now leading the attack on
Nakasone.
Brown attacks protective trade laws
Washington — Former California Gov. Edmund
Brown departed sharply from growing Democratic doc
trine yesterday assailing trade protection legislation that
he said is "scapegoating" the Japanese.

"The scapegoating of Japan is very dangerous from
both an economic and security point of view .... I believe
the Japanese are being scapegoated for what we ought to
be doing ourselves," Brown told the Senate Finance sub
committee on investment policy.
Subcommittee Chairman John Chafec (R-R.1.) noting
that several Democratic presidential candidates had
taken protectionist stands, said he agreed with Brown.
Among Democratic candidates who have taken pro
tectionist positions are Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.)
and former Vice President Walter Mondale.
Brown said Japan is "producing a better industrializa
tion policy and therefore better autos." Trying to force
Japan to take more U.S. imports could drive the Japanese
closer to the Chinese and Russians, he said.
"Instead of responding (to a flood of Japanese im
ports) with trade barriers," Brown said, the United States
should find wavs to improve its own industrial produc
tion.
Brown called for changes in banking and pension laws
that would make pension funds available for investment.
He suggested that I percent of pension funds be made
availabled for use as venture capital and 3 percent to 5
percent for investment in high-growth companies.
Social Security reform proposed
Washington — The National Commission on Social
Security Reform sent President Reagan yesterday its
Sl6B billion blueprint for pulling the system back from
the brink of a financial crisis that threatens to delay re
tirees' checks this summer.
A majority also recommended gradually raising the
normal retirement age from 65 to 66. If Congress ap
proves, everyone bom since 1938 would be affected.
The change would be phased in one month a year so
that those born in 1949 or later would have to wait until
age 66 to draw full Social Security benefits. The retire
ment age also eventually would go up automatically with
any gains in life expectancy.
That was not part of the compromise rescue plan that
President Reagan and House Speaker Thomas O'Neill
endorsed Saturday night after the pact was approved by
12 of the commission's 15 members.
The centerpiece of the plan is a six-month delay in this
July's cost-of-living increase for Social Security's 36 mil
lion beneficiaries; higher payroll taxes in 1984, 1988 and
1989 for employees and employers; a permanently higher
payroll tax on the self-employed starting in 1984; taxa
tion of one-half of benefits for middle-and upper-income
retirees; and bringing all new federal workers and non
profit groups in the system next year.
The payroll tax would jump from the current 6.7 per
cent to 7 percent on Jan. 1. For 1984 only, workers would
get a tax credit against their income taxes to cushion them
from paying any extra tax overall.
California's credit future unclear
Sacramento — State officials waited anxiously yester
day for word of whether one of the nation's top two bond
rating firms will downgrade California's credit rating —
and if so, bv how much.
The nation's largest brokerage firm, Merrill, Lynch,
Pierce, Fenner & Smith Inc., downgraded California's
rating in an internal memorandum made public yester
day.
But most state officials viewed a review by Standard &
Poor's as having the greatest impact on the state's ability
to continue to borrow or sell bonds at acceptable rates.
The decision could cost the state millions of dollars in
higher interest payments.
Standard & Poor's, one of the two major firms that
rate the credit-worthiness of government agencies, has
had California on a "credit watch" since state tax reven
ues started falling behind estimates and the deficit — now
projected at $1.5 billion or more — started to grow last
fall.
After meetings in New York earlier this week with top
state fiscal officers, Standard & Poor's officials were re

viewing California's credit rating in an all-day closed
door session vesterdav. But there was no indication when
a ruling would he made.
California lost its "AAA" rating after Proposition 13
cut property taxes 4 vearsago, but has held an "AA-plus"
rating since then, a rating exceeded by only 12 of the other
49 states.
Among possible actions discussed by state officials if
the deficit continues and the state's credit rating plunges
is the issuance of registered warrants instead of checks to
state employees, local governments and taxpayers receiv
ing state income tax refunds.
Satellite unlikely to hit U.S.
Washington — The Pentagon estimated yesterday a 2
percent chance that debris from a disabled nuclear-pow
ered Soviet spy satellite will hit the United States after en
tering the atmosphere sometime between early Sunday
and Monday afternoon.
Spokesman Henry Catto told reporters that experts
have predicted the re-entry of the satellite, which carries a
nuclear reactor, sometime between I a.m. EST Sunday
and 3 p.m. EST Monday.
However, space experts said the Cosmos 1402, which
has been tumbling toward earth at an ever-increasing
rate, may plunge into the atmosphere late Sunday night.
Experts state there is a 70 percent chance the Cosmos
debris will come down over water, 15 percent chance over
the Soviet Union, 3 percent chance over Canada and 2
percent chance over the United States.
The Cosmos 1402 was launched from the Soviet Union
on Aug. 30. U.S. experts detected problems with it after
the Soviets failed in an effort to separate the 1,000-pound
reactor section from the rest of the spaceship and to send
it into a "parking orbit" where its more than 100 pounds
of radioactive materials would stay safely in space for 500
years or longer.
The satellite began tumbling and one part broke away.
The remainder of the space vehicle, along with a small un
identified piece traveling with it, has been descending in
orbit since.

However, space experts said the Cosmos 1402, which
has been tumbling toward earth at an ever-increasing
rate, may plunge into the atmosphere late Sunday night.
Experts state there is a 70 percent chance the Cosmos
debris will come down over water, 15 percent chance over
the Soviet Union, 3 percent chance over Canada and 2
percent chance over the United States.
The Cosmos 1402 was launched from the Soviet Union
on Aug. 30. U.S. experts detected problems with it after
the Soviets failed in an effort to separate the 1,000-pound
reactor section from the rest of the spaceship and to send
it into a "parking orbit" where its more than 100 pounds
of radioactive materials would stay safely in space for 500
years or longer.
The satellite began tumbling and one part broke away.
The remainder of the space vehicle, along with a small un
identified piece traveling with it, has been descending in
orbit since.
Volcker cautions on spending
Washington — Federal Reserve Chairman Paul
Volcker warned yesterday night that the prospect of huge
continuing budget deficits is keeping interest rates high,
while their realization could bar a sustained economic re
covery.
Volcker said the fiscal 1983 deficit could end up equal
to 6 percent of the gross national product, well above the
previous 4 percent peak, with between one-half and two
thirds of the red ink due to the recession.
Lowering the deficits would, "in and of itself. . . have
favorable effects on current interest rates and in damping
concerns about future increases," he declared.
Stocks post small overall gain
Energy issues and Apple Computer shares were the

Reagan predicts economic upturn
Washington — President Reagan, who swept into office promising pros
perity and balanced budgets, observed the midpoint of his term yesterday
contending the nation was entering "a season of hope" even if economic re
covery has so far proved elusive.
Reagan offered a personal appraisal of his stewardship "in the first term"
— he has vet to officially announce he'll seek a second — during an im
promptu appearance in the White House press room on the second an
niversary of his inauguration.
After two years in office, Reagan continued to blame the state of the econ
omy, at its worst since World War 11, on his predecessors. "This recession
had been coming on for several vears and gradually growing worse," he said.
Recalling that when John F. Kennedy took office he was surprised to Hnd
that things were as bad as he had been saying they were, Reagan said: "In my
case, the biggest surprise was finding out that they were even worse. And it's
a real human tragedy that so manv of our people today are still suffering
from the political mistakes of the past that we've finally started to correct.''
Reagan said he foresaw "an American economy and an America on the
mend." He laid out no timetable for how long it would take to heal the coun
try's economic ailments.
Reagan said "nearlv everv economic indicator shows us heading into re
covery." but he did not mention that unemployment has increased from 7.4
percent when he took office to 10.8 percent last month.
Nor did Reagan, who had promised a balanced budget by 1983, say any
thing about the high deficits in his budgets. The fiscal year 1984 deficit is
expected to be about SI9O billion. Aides now say Reagan is aiming for a bal
anced budget bv the end of the decade.
After Reagn's appearance, Democratic National Chairman Charles Man
att issued a response saving Reagan had put the nation on a course of unfair
ness and mismanagement, and suggesting the Republican president was
seeing things differently from the rest of the country.
Reagan speaks on missile deployment
Washington — Escalating the war of words surrounding U.S.-Soviet nu
clear arms negotiations. President Reagan said yesterday that the Soviet
Union is demanding "the right to maintain enough intermediate-range nu-
clear warheads to literally hit every population center in
Europe, but thev don't want a single weapon of a de
terrent nature to he there on the other side."
Reagan's statement was made to reporters as he ap
peared in the White House press room to take note of his
second anniversary in office. But the president was clear
ly addressing voters in West Germany, where the planned
deployment of U.S. Pershing 2 ballistic missiles and nu
clear-armed cruise missiles has become a focal point of
the upcoming national election.
With Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Ciromyko visit
ing Germany and Soviet Communist Party leader Yuri
Andropov taking every opportunity to sieze the initiative
in the public debate over arms control, the Reagan ad
ministration has stepped up efforts to avoid the ap
pearance of inflexibility while sticking with the "zero op
tion" plan that Reagan proposed for Europe last year.
Asked whether there is any flexibility in the U.S. nego
tiating stance, inasmuch as the Soviets have flatly rejected
the zero-option formula, Reagan replied, "You can't talk
openly about strategy or tactics. We have said that we be
lieve the best solution for both of us is zero zero, but we
have said that we will listen to and negotiate any fair pro
posals that are made.
"There is no question that their goal is, whatever they
do, they do not want us to implement the plan of placing
even one of those missiles on European soil. We are just
as determined that we are going to stay on schedule with
that."
Under the zero option plan proposed in November
1981, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization would
cancel the planned deployment of the 464 ground
launched cruise missiles and 108 Pershing 2 ballistic mis
siles in Europe in exchange for the Soviet dismantlement
of some 333 SS-20 ballistic missiles, each armed with
three nuclear warheads and most of them targeted on
Western Europe.
In another sign of apprehension about Moscow's
propaganda blitz, the State Department confirmed that
Peter Dailev, the U.S. ambassador to Ireland and the
1980 advertising manager for the Reagan presidential
campaign, has been tapped to "help strengthen com
munications with Europe." Spokesman John Hughes
also said a high-level inter-agency committee had been
formed "to coordinate the U.S. government's policies
and activities in the area of public diplomacy."
Soviets nix interim solution
Moscow — The Soviet news agency Tass last night car
ried an article rejecting the so-called "interim solution"
that has gained popularity among some Western Europe
an policy-makers as a way of resolving the current East-
West impasse over intermediate-range nuclear missiles in
Europe.
Tass said the "intermediate agreement" was "absolute
ly unacceptable to the Soviet Union" and hinted that any
deployment of new American medium-range missiles in
Western Europe could lead to the collapse of the Geneva
negotiations.
The "interim solution" calls for each side to maintain a
small number of medium-range missiles if total elimina
tion of all such missiles cannot be achieved this year in the
U.S.-Soviet discussions currently under way in Geneva.
This would enable the United States to proceed with
plans to deploy some of the medium-range missiles this
year, a move Moscow opposes as a threat to its security.
The article distributed by Tass said that West German
Foreign Minister Hans Genscher and British Foreign
Secretary Francis Pvm were proponents of this idea.
"The placement of the first Pershing 2 on West Ger
man territory and the first cruise missile in Sicily creates a
new situation," it said.
"The Geneva talks on nuclear armaments in Europe
would become deprived of the realistic basis upon which
they are now being conducted if only because the Soviet
Union would be forced to take immediate measures to re
store the balance which had been disturbed in order to

ensure for itself and its allies security equal to that of the
NATO countries."
Lebanon rejects Israeli demand
Kirvat Shmona, Israel — Lebanon yesterday rejected
Israel's demand to operate electronic spy stations on Leb
anese soil, and U.S. envoy Philip Habib was reported
working on a compromise proposal for listening posts
manned bv Americans.
Negotiators clashed over the Israeli demand but did
agree to form four committees, including one to draw up
a timetable for evacuating foreign armies from Lebanon.
A joint statement after the eighth round of talks said
"good progress was made."
But officials attending the U.S.-mediated negotiations
said no attempt was made to bridge differences over Is
rael's conditions for leaving Lebanon, which it invaded
June 6 to smash the Palestine Liberation Organization.
The joint statement said committees were created "to
enter into detailed examination" of the topics on the
agenda: withdrawal, security arrangements, future Is
raeli-Lebanese relations and possible guarantees of the
final agreement.
A fifth committee was formed previously to formulate
a declaration ending the 34-year-old formal state of war
between Lebanon and Israel, completing the roster of
agenda items.
Habib, ordered by President Reagan to help speed up
the talks, waited in Jerusalem for a report, and planned to
meet todav with Israeli Foreign Minister Yitzhak
Shamir.
Habib met Shamir and the Israeli delegations three
times this week to try to whittle down the Israeli demands
and develop new ideas.
Nakasone backs U.S. trade rights
Washington — Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone
Hew back to Tokyo yesterday to face a battle in Par
liament over his decision to allow the United States to ob
tain Japanese technology for military uses.
The controversial decision, made three days before
Nakasone began his trip to the United States, was an ex
emption from a 16-year-old Japanese policy ban on ex
ports of weapons.
Late Wednesday night, after attending a dinner at the
Japanese ambassador's residence for 16 American busi
ness and labor leaders, Nakasone was questioned by re
porters traveling with him about how he intended to deal
with the opposition parties. Nakasone rejected charges
that the exemption approved by his Cabinet last Friday
conflicted with a parliamentary resolution banning
weapons exports. Only the interpretation of it — to allow
the United States, which provides a security guarantee to
Japan, to obtain military technology — has been
changed, he insisted.
Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger, after a meet
ing with Nakasone here Tuesday, praised Nakasone's de
cision as "a politically courageous act."
In June 1981, Weinberger asked Japan to reciprocate
for the flow of military technology Japan has received
from the United States since the mid-19505. The Japanese
administration led bv Prime Minister Zenko Suzuki re
fused to act on the request, however.
Suzuki himself was reliably reported to have opposed
providing military technology because of Japan's com
mitment to a peace-oriented foreign policy.
Japan's leading opposition group, the Socialist Party,
which advocates a policy of unarmed neutralism, and the
Communists, also opposed any concession to the United
States, and both parties are now leading the attack on
Nakasone.
Brown attacks protective trade laws
Washington — Former California Gov. Edmund
Brown departed sharply from growing Democratic doc
trine yesterday assailing trade protection legislation that
he said is "scapegoating" the Japanese.

"The scapegoating of Japan is very dangerous from
both an economic and security point of view .... I believe
the Japanese are being scapegoated for what we ought to
be doing ourselves," Brown told the Senate Finance sub
committee on investment policy.
Subcommittee Chairman John Chafec (R-R.1.) noting
that several Democratic presidential candidates had
taken protectionist stands, said he agreed with Brown.
Among Democratic candidates who have taken pro
tectionist positions are Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.)
and former Vice President Walter Mondale.
Brown said Japan is "producing a better industrializa
tion policy and therefore better autos." Trying to force
Japan to take more U.S. imports could drive the Japanese
closer to the Chinese and Russians, he said.
"Instead of responding (to a flood of Japanese im
ports) with trade barriers," Brown said, the United States
should find wavs to improve its own industrial produc
tion.
Brown called for changes in banking and pension laws
that would make pension funds available for investment.
He suggested that I percent of pension funds be made
availabled for use as venture capital and 3 percent to 5
percent for investment in high-growth companies.
Social Security reform proposed
Washington — The National Commission on Social
Security Reform sent President Reagan yesterday its
Sl6B billion blueprint for pulling the system back from
the brink of a financial crisis that threatens to delay re
tirees' checks this summer.
A majority also recommended gradually raising the
normal retirement age from 65 to 66. If Congress ap
proves, everyone bom since 1938 would be affected.
The change would be phased in one month a year so
that those born in 1949 or later would have to wait until
age 66 to draw full Social Security benefits. The retire
ment age also eventually would go up automatically with
any gains in life expectancy.
That was not part of the compromise rescue plan that
President Reagan and House Speaker Thomas O'Neill
endorsed Saturday night after the pact was approved by
12 of the commission's 15 members.
The centerpiece of the plan is a six-month delay in this
July's cost-of-living increase for Social Security's 36 mil
lion beneficiaries; higher payroll taxes in 1984, 1988 and
1989 for employees and employers; a permanently higher
payroll tax on the self-employed starting in 1984; taxa
tion of one-half of benefits for middle-and upper-income
retirees; and bringing all new federal workers and non
profit groups in the system next year.
The payroll tax would jump from the current 6.7 per
cent to 7 percent on Jan. 1. For 1984 only, workers would
get a tax credit against their income taxes to cushion them
from paying any extra tax overall.
California's credit future unclear
Sacramento — State officials waited anxiously yester
day for word of whether one of the nation's top two bond
rating firms will downgrade California's credit rating —
and if so, bv how much.
The nation's largest brokerage firm, Merrill, Lynch,
Pierce, Fenner & Smith Inc., downgraded California's
rating in an internal memorandum made public yester
day.
But most state officials viewed a review by Standard &
Poor's as having the greatest impact on the state's ability
to continue to borrow or sell bonds at acceptable rates.
The decision could cost the state millions of dollars in
higher interest payments.
Standard & Poor's, one of the two major firms that
rate the credit-worthiness of government agencies, has
had California on a "credit watch" since state tax reven
ues started falling behind estimates and the deficit — now
projected at $1.5 billion or more — started to grow last
fall.
After meetings in New York earlier this week with top
state fiscal officers, Standard & Poor's officials were re

viewing California's credit rating in an all-day closed
door session vesterdav. But there was no indication when
a ruling would he made.
California lost its "AAA" rating after Proposition 13
cut property taxes 4 vearsago, but has held an "AA-plus"
rating since then, a rating exceeded by only 12 of the other
49 states.
Among possible actions discussed by state officials if
the deficit continues and the state's credit rating plunges
is the issuance of registered warrants instead of checks to
state employees, local governments and taxpayers receiv
ing state income tax refunds.
Satellite unlikely to hit U.S.
Washington — The Pentagon estimated yesterday a 2
percent chance that debris from a disabled nuclear-pow
ered Soviet spy satellite will hit the United States after en
tering the atmosphere sometime between early Sunday
and Monday afternoon.
Spokesman Henry Catto told reporters that experts
have predicted the re-entry of the satellite, which carries a
nuclear reactor, sometime between I a.m. EST Sunday
and 3 p.m. EST Monday.
However, space experts said the Cosmos 1402, which
has been tumbling toward earth at an ever-increasing
rate, may plunge into the atmosphere late Sunday night.

Satellite unlikely to hit U.S.
Washington — The Pentagon estimated yesterday a 2
percent chance that debris from a disabled nuclear-pow
ered Soviet spy satellite will hit the United States after en
tering the atmosphere sometime between early Sunday
and Monday afternoon.
Spokesman Henry Catto told reporters that experts
have predicted the re-entry of the satellite, which carries a
nuclear reactor, sometime between I a.m. EST Sunday
and 3 p.m. EST Monday.
However, space experts said the Cosmos 1402, which
has been tumbling toward earth at an ever-increasing
rate, may plunge into the atmosphere late Sunday night.
Experts state there is a 70 percent chance the Cosmos
debris will come down over water, 15 percent chance over
the Soviet Union, 3 percent chance over Canada and 2
percent chance over the United States.
The Cosmos 1402 was launched from the Soviet Union
on Aug. 30. U.S. experts detected problems with it after
the Soviets failed in an effort to separate the 1,000-pound
reactor section from the rest of the spaceship and to send
it into a "parking orbit" where its more than 100 pounds
of radioactive materials would stay safely in space for 500
years or longer.
The satellite began tumbling and one part broke away.
The remainder of the space vehicle, along with a small un
identified piece traveling with it, has been descending in
orbit since.
Volcker cautions on spending
Washington — Federal Reserve Chairman Paul
Volcker warned yesterday night that the prospect of huge
continuing budget deficits is keeping interest rates high,
while their realization could bar a sustained economic re
covery.
Volcker said the fiscal 1983 deficit could end up equal
to 6 percent of the gross national product, well above the
previous 4 percent peak, with between one-half and two
thirds of the red ink due to the recession.
Lowering the deficits would, "in and of itself. . . have
favorable effects on current interest rates and in damping
concerns about future increases," he declared.
