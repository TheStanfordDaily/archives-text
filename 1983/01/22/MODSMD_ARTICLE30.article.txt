The ice hockey club opens a
heavy home winter quarter
schedule this weekend with two
games, Fresno tomorrow and
Cal on Sunday.
The Cal game at Belmont Ice
land starting at 7:30 p.m. prom
ises to be an exciting chance to
avenge the Big Game and the
recent basketball loss. (A skating
party with free beer follows the
game. Everyone, including the
Band, is invited.) Future games
this quarter include a
Washington's Birthday weekend
series with Arizona State and
UCLA followed the next week
by a two-game stand against
Northern Arizona University's
club team.
The fall schedule was com
prised of all away games which
partly explains the team's slow
start this year. The record for the
year is 4-3-3.

The ASU game was an ex
tremely fast, offensive game with
the lead changing hands several
times. ASU was ahead 7-5 with
only two minutes to go. But
senior Mason Day squelched
their hopes for a victory with two
goals after Stanford pulled the
goalie for a sixth attacker.
The fall schedule victories
were over Reno, Santa Rosa and
Fresno while the other ties were
against Fresno and Stockton.
After losing to Stockton in Oc
tober, Stanford started off the
winter with a win in Stockton last
Sunday, 4-2. Taking advantage
of extra practice time this quar
ter, the club was able to master
the well-conditioned and very
physical Colts. Sophomore Jon
Zierk led the team with two goals
and Gould, a graduate of the
Business School, followed suit
with two more.
