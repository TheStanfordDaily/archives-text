# Pat Benatar almost advances

Pat Benatar
Get Nervous
Chrysalis Records
Pat Benatar has revamped her
band and delivered a new sound
to add to her old tricks on Get
Nervous. No longer is the tiny
Benatar wailing at the top of her
pumps in an attempt to over
power Neil Geraldo's screeching
guitar licks. Sure, the band is still
distinctly axe-laden, but Benatar
is beginning to realize that given
the chance, her voice can actu
ally please without being over
dubbed. The basic Darwinian
themes survive, but keyboardist

Charlie Giordano has taken the
desperation out of the struggle.
Although she still clings to
echo's and sustains in say, the
false a cap pel I a introduction of
"Shadows of the Night," new
modes of interpretation present
the strength and diversity of Be
natar's unmolested voice in the
title cut and "Little Too Late."
There is no more faking or mask -
ing on these two songs: she
doesn't have to hide behind
Geraldo's leviathan riff the way
she does when she screams "But
your heart says try again" on
Precious Time's"Promises in the
Dark."
"Fight it Out" presents Be
natar singing on her own, while
her band remains comparatively
subdued. Geraldo's contribu
tions are effective in their spar
sity, and Giordano's work rises
for texture but not for camouf
lage. The result is a diverse vocal
ranging from the yearning
chorus to the gentle, relaxed
final verses and a smoother, less
obtrusive backing track.
Geraldo's flirtations with the
keyboards on Precious Time
proved miniscule, but paved the
way for Giordano's fruitful work
here. The result is a more engag

ing sound. His efforts are most
effective on "Looking for a
Stranger" and "Anxiety (Get
Nervous)." There is no more ul
timately flat and listless guitar
flailing such as Precious Time's
"Helter Skelter" or even Crimes
of Passion's "You Better Run."
Instead, the bopping keyboards
behind the versus and Police-like
rain textures behind the chorus
of "Looking for a Stranger"
round out the music.
Producers Geraldo and Peter
Coleman take the keyboards one
step further in the title cut, as the
keys actually intertwine with the
jackhammer (but essentially
subdued) guitars and create a
layer of music. This song is no
"Layla," but it sure holds your
attention longer than "Treat Me
Right."
But — and "but" is almost as
important a word here as
"keyboard" — Get Nervous fails
to transcend the almost tiring
Benatar trademarks. Granted,
pop music is puppy-love music,
and Pat Benatar is almost as pop
as Rick Springfield or Abba; but
the fact remains that the subject
matter is plain old tiring. Just a
glance at the titles reveals
enough clues as to the identity of
the album's artist. "Fight it Out"
echoes "Take it Any Way You
Want It," which harks back to
"Hit Me With Your Best Shot,"
whose parents are "No You
Don't" and "Heartbreaker."
"Looking for a Stranger" claims
as its ancestors, "Never Want to
Leave You" and "1 Need a
Lover." This kind of repetition

may be enough for the costumed
girls of Fast Times at Ridgemont
High, but like all profit-oriented
pop, it holds your attention only
until you whip out your old Be
natar discs.

The step forward that Benatar
has taken in vocal strength and
diversity, plus the extra pace
taken by the bouncy keyboards,
does more than offset the
backpedalling of the stagnated,
molasses-like lyrics. It leaves Get
Nervous a step ahead of Be
natar's former efforts. But just
one.
