When I was checking out the
New York music scene over the
winter break, there was a buzz
about Miami Steve Van Zandt's
solo album. The rhythm guitarist
of Springsteen's E Street Band
had concentrated his talents into
making an album for himself.
Previously, Van Zandt had pro
duced, arranged, and composed
songs for Springsteen, Ronnie
Spector, Southside Johnny and
the Asbury Jukes, and Gary
"U.S." Bonds. Now, he felt the
desire to do something for him
self. To prove that this was not to
be a cashing in on his name, and
to prove to himself that he had a
unique musical identity, Van
Zandt has labelled himself and
his band as "Little Steven and
the Disciples of Soul." Not only
is this the toughest name around,
but the music found on the
grooves of Men Without Women
is the toughest rock and soul
produced since the Blues
Brothers' Band (Yes, the band
that backed up Jake and Elwood,
which was one of the finest col
lections of rock/R&B/soul musi
cians ever).
Basically, the album, Men
Without Women, shows the
complete musical vision of Steve
Van Zandt. Although hinted at
on his various productions or
compositions, the material on
Men Without Women has no real
precedents on Van Zandt's pre
vious work. The sound is what
rock and roll used to sound like.

It is the sound that rock and roll
was meant to sound like. It is
raw, gutsy, moving, danceable,
sensual and spontaneous. Furth
ermore, lyrically, if you thought
that Springsteen had the
monopoly on portraying the
plight and pathos of the working
man's struggle to survive, then I
guess Van Zandt has picked up
some lyrical touches from his
boss. In fact, Van Zandt's songs
are an all encompassing over
view of the lives of those whose
only hope is through rock and
roll.
Men Without Women has the
vision of rock and roll to com
municate and express the fears of
life while at the same time being
able to redeem and liberate both
the listener and the performer. It
is Van Zandt's vision of rock and
roll as the lone constant in the
ever-changing ways of life. It is
the sole factor that still gives
strength after all these years. As
he explains in "Until TTie Good
Is Gone," it was rock that helped
show him the future â€” "We al
ways stood on the same block
way back when, waiting to find
out where in the world we fit in;
Then something on the radio
changed everything we'd been.
Ever since, I need it over and
over again. Where it comes from
baby I don't know; That same
old something just won't let me
go-"
Yet, how does Van Zandt
communicate such vision, truth
and intensity on his first solo out
ing, especially since he sounds
like a combination of Bob Dylan
