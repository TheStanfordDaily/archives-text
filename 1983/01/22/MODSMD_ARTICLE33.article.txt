### STEFAN MALMOLI 
Little Steven and the Disciples of Soul
Men Without Women
EMI
When I was checking out the
New York music scene over the
winter break, there was a buzz
about Miami Steve Van Zandt's
solo album. The rhythm guitarist
of Springsteen's E Street Band
had concentrated his talents into
making an album for himself.
Previously, Van Zandt had pro
duced, arranged, and composed
songs for Springsteen, Ronnie
Spector, Southside Johnny and
the Asbury Jukes, and Gary
"U.S." Bonds. Now, he felt the
desire to do something for him
self. To prove that this was not to
be a cashing in on his name, and
to prove to himself that he had a
unique musical identity, Van
Zandt has labelled himself and
his band as "Little Steven and
the Disciples of Soul." Not only
is this the toughest name around,
but the music found on the
grooves of Men Without Women
is the toughest rock and soul
produced since the Blues
Brothers' Band (Yes, the band
that backed up Jake and Elwood,
which was one of the finest col
lections of rock/R&B/soul musi
cians ever).
Basically, the album, Men
Without Women, shows the
complete musical vision of Steve
Van Zandt. Although hinted at
on his various productions or
compositions, the material on
Men Without Women has no real
precedents on Van Zandt's pre
vious work. The sound is what
rock and roll used to sound like.

It is the sound that rock and roll
was meant to sound like. It is
raw, gutsy, moving, danceable,
sensual and spontaneous. Furth
ermore, lyrically, if you thought
that Springsteen had the
monopoly on portraying the
plight and pathos of the working
man's struggle to survive, then I
guess Van Zandt has picked up
some lyrical touches from his
boss. In fact, Van Zandt's songs
are an all encompassing over
view of the lives of those whose
only hope is through rock and
roll.
Men Without Women has the
vision of rock and roll to com
municate and express the fears of
life while at the same time being
able to redeem and liberate both
the listener and the performer. It
is Van Zandt's vision of rock and
roll as the lone constant in the
ever-changing ways of life. It is
the sole factor that still gives
strength after all these years. As
he explains in "Until TTie Good
Is Gone," it was rock that helped
show him the future — "We al
ways stood on the same block
way back when, waiting to find
out where in the world we fit in;
Then something on the radio
changed everything we'd been.
Ever since, I need it over and
over again. Where it comes from
baby I don't know; That same
old something just won't let me
go-"
Yet, how does Van Zandt
communicate such vision, truth
and intensity on his first solo out
ing, especially since he sounds
like a combination of Bob Dylan
and Keith Richard being put
through a Veg-O-Matic. Basi
cally, he pulls this off by enlisting
an array of talent, who all have
been saved by rock and roll.
From members of the E Street
Band to Dino Danelli and Felix
Cavaliere of the Rascals (the
'60s finest white soul outfit) to
La Bamba from the Asbury
Jukes, all of the musicians com
bine to share their talents and
visions. In doing so, they create a
tight, impeccable powerhouse.
They combine the soulful punch
ing horns with the searing guitar
and the driving bass and drums
that one only expected on the
best of Motown and S tax's classic
soul numbers. Whether it's the
mean, hard soul sounding roc
kers like "Save Me" and "Inside
Of Me" (which sound so re
miniscent of the Four Tops'
"Reach Out, I'll Be There" and
the Temptations' "I'm Losing
You") or the refreshing, looser
R&B of the Rascals and the Su p
remes as in "Angel Eyes" and
"Forever," the music succeeds
on all levels.
However, it is the intense lyri
cal content and the poignant
emotional feel that enables this
music to rise above being mere
imitations of'6os soul. With Van
Zandt's passion filled screen
ings delivering out the truths of

life in the city, one cannot help
from being completely captured
up by the music. For example, on
"Lyin' In A Bed Of Fire," one
feels the tensions of living a life
with no apparent meaning or di
rection — "It was so much easier
yesterday when all we had to do
was survive . . . You wait and
pray, maybe it'll all go away; it
clings like a curse . . . We're lyin'
in a bed of fire, we're burnin' and
we don't even know it; We're
lyin' in a bed of fire, better wake
up now or surrender." Or on
"Save Me," one feels the pains
that emptiness and loneliness
can cause in life — "We need all
the strength to get well; Who's
gonna save the children when we
can't help ourselves. Nobody's
picking up the fallen flag; No
body seems to know it went
down; It's getting harder and
harder to find the things you
need."
What else can be said about
this album? It is a sheer reflec
tion of rock and roll as the
saviour it can occasionally be. It
is the vision of rock and roll as
life. It is a classically sounding
album that combines the finest
uplifting qualities that have
dominated rock and soul for the
last 25 years. It goes beyond clas
sification because it strikes a
chord that one can only feel from
within. It affects one's deepest
emotions and feelings. Unless
you've listened to it, more can
not be said. Incidentally, this is,
without a doubt, the best album
of the year so far.

Men Without Women has no real
precedents on Van Zandt's pre
vious work. The sound is what
rock and roll used to sound like.

It is the sound that rock and roll
was meant to sound like. It is
raw, gutsy, moving, danceable,
sensual and spontaneous. Furth
ermore, lyrically, if you thought
that Springsteen had the
monopoly on portraying the
plight and pathos of the working
man's struggle to survive, then I
guess Van Zandt has picked up
some lyrical touches from his
boss. In fact, Van Zandt's songs
are an all encompassing over
view of the lives of those whose
only hope is through rock and
roll.
Men Without Women has the
vision of rock and roll to com
municate and express the fears of
life while at the same time being
able to redeem and liberate both
the listener and the performer. It
is Van Zandt's vision of rock and
roll as the lone constant in the
ever-changing ways of life. It is
the sole factor that still gives
strength after all these years. As
he explains in "Until TTie Good
Is Gone," it was rock that helped
show him the future — "We al
ways stood on the same block
way back when, waiting to find
out where in the world we fit in;
Then something on the radio
changed everything we'd been.
Ever since, I need it over and
over again. Where it comes from
baby I don't know; That same
old something just won't let me
go-"
Yet, how does Van Zandt
communicate such vision, truth
and intensity on his first solo out
ing, especially since he sounds
like a combination of Bob Dylan
and Keith Richard being put
through a Veg-O-Matic. Basi
cally, he pulls this off by enlisting
an array of talent, who all have
been saved by rock and roll.
From members of the E Street
Band to Dino Danelli and Felix
Cavaliere of the Rascals (the
'60s finest white soul outfit) to
La Bamba from the Asbury
Jukes, all of the musicians com
bine to share their talents and
visions. In doing so, they create a
tight, impeccable powerhouse.
They combine the soulful punch
ing horns with the searing guitar
and the driving bass and drums
that one only expected on the
best of Motown and S tax's classic
soul numbers. Whether it's the
mean, hard soul sounding roc
kers like "Save Me" and "Inside
Of Me" (which sound so re
miniscent of the Four Tops'
"Reach Out, I'll Be There" and
the Temptations' "I'm Losing
You") or the refreshing, looser
R&B of the Rascals and the Su p
remes as in "Angel Eyes" and
"Forever," the music succeeds
on all levels.
However, it is the intense lyri
cal content and the poignant
emotional feel that enables this
music to rise above being mere
imitations of'6os soul. With Van
Zandt's passion filled screen
ings delivering out the truths of

life in the city, one cannot help
from being completely captured
up by the music. For example, on
"Lyin' In A Bed Of Fire," one
feels the tensions of living a life
with no apparent meaning or di
rection — "It was so much easier
yesterday when all we had to do
was survive . . . You wait and
pray, maybe it'll all go away; it
clings like a curse . . . We're lyin'
in a bed of fire, we're burnin' and
we don't even know it; We're
lyin' in a bed of fire, better wake
up now or surrender." Or on
"Save Me," one feels the pains
that emptiness and loneliness
can cause in life — "We need all
the strength to get well; Who's
gonna save the children when we
can't help ourselves. Nobody's
picking up the fallen flag; No
body seems to know it went
down; It's getting harder and
harder to find the things you
need."
What else can be said about
this album? It is a sheer reflec
tion of rock and roll as the
saviour it can occasionally be. It
is the vision of rock and roll as
life. It is a classically sounding
album that combines the finest
uplifting qualities that have
dominated rock and soul for the
last 25 years. It goes beyond clas
sification because it strikes a
chord that one can only feel from
within. It affects one's deepest
emotions and feelings. Unless
you've listened to it, more can
not be said. Incidentally, this is,
without a doubt, the best album
of the year so far.
Little Steven and the Disciples of Soul
Men Without Women
EMI
When I was checking out the
New York music scene over the
winter break, there was a buzz
about Miami Steve Van Zandt's
solo album. The rhythm guitarist
of Springsteen's E Street Band
had concentrated his talents into
making an album for himself.
Previously, Van Zandt had pro
duced, arranged, and composed
songs for Springsteen, Ronnie
Spector, Southside Johnny and
the Asbury Jukes, and Gary
"U.S." Bonds. Now, he felt the
desire to do something for him
self. To prove that this was not to
be a cashing in on his name, and
to prove to himself that he had a
unique musical identity, Van
Zandt has labelled himself and
his band as "Little Steven and
the Disciples of Soul." Not only
is this the toughest name around,
but the music found on the
grooves of Men Without Women
is the toughest rock and soul
produced since the Blues
Brothers' Band (Yes, the band
that backed up Jake and Elwood,
which was one of the finest col
lections of rock/R&B/soul musi
cians ever).
Basically, the album, Men
Without Women, shows the
complete musical vision of Steve
Van Zandt. Although hinted at
on his various productions or
compositions, the material on
Men Without Women has no real
