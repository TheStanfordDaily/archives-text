# Yeah, but if he's Rocky, who's Clubber Lang?

The Distance
Capitol Records
Initially, I had lukewarm
feelings towards writing an
article comparing the Rocky
film trilogy with rock and roll.
However, by the time the fear
of embarrassment, ridicule
and torture subsided, I de
cided that it would make an
intriguing introduction to a
review of Bob Seger's latest
album.
Now what does Rocky have
to do with rock and roll?
Well, in Bob Seger's case, it is
comparable in every way.
Seger had his own dream at
attaining his own shot at the
title in the field of rock music.
For years, Seger was struggl
ing to realize his dream. He
persevered against derision
and self-doubt (he even enti
tled one of his albums. Beauti
ful Loser), always keeping his
"eye on the tiger." Eventu
ally, with Night Moves, Seger
reached the goals of his
dream just as Rocky had
done. However, just as Roc
ky's dream was not the same
once he had achieved it, Seger
also felt himself to be a
"Stranger in Town" (as his
next album was entitled). He
lost sight of the original val
ues of his struggle, and thus
lost his "eye." He realized he
needed to re-examine him
self, which was hinted at on
his cautious next album
(Against The Wind), which
had Seger "runnin' against
the wind" and running from
what his dream had become.
However, what was hinted
at on that previous album, is
fully realized on his new al
bum. On it, Seger goes the
distance once again to regain
his "eye of the tiger" and to
regain his dream. Therefore,
on the aptly titled The Dis
tance, one is struck with a

Seger who is still fighting to
attain new heights to his
dream. In doing so. The Dis
tance is as emotional, power
ful and soul-searching as his
breakthrough album. Night
Moves. Unlike Night Moves
though, which gained promi
nence through its freshness
and innocence in showing
Seger's original struggle to
the top. The Distance is an ef
fort that questions the mean
ing of success and the worth
of going the distance.
As the album is a whole, it
is hard to single out individual
highlights. The album con
tains some of Seger's harshest
rockers to date, which implies
that Seger's weak, mellow
rockers on Against The Wind
were only the products of a
temporary lack of musical di
rection caused by his inner
need to re-evaluate the
reasons behind his going the
distance. In fact, this record
explodes with three of Seger's
finest rockers ever. From the
opening "Even Now," which
has Seger straining to regain
his dream ("And through the
darkness, through all the end
less days; Through all the
changes, % pointless one act
plays, I can still make it") to
the kinetic recollection of
Chuck Berry's automobile
world of 1955 in "Makin'
Thunderbirds," one is hit
with a firm intensity that is
Seger's forte.
The most lyrical rocker
though, is "Boomtown
Blues." In this song, Seger
questions success because,
just as Rocky learned, success
is only a false illusion that is
void of all meaning and emo
tion — "You're feelin' rest
less and it's hard to sleep;
Look what you win, but look
what you lose; Stuck here in
heaven with these Boomtown
Blues." However, he coA
cludes that the struggle to st

rive further is the key to ob
taining a true meaning to suc
cess. One cannot sit compla
cently upon what one has.
One must keep going the dis
tance at all costs so as to be
truly satisfied — "You can't
miss that freezin' rain; You'd
have to be insane to head
back north and go through all
that again."
Seger's finesse though, lies
in his knowledge of when to
build up or let down an inten
sity. Just as his live shows
have perfectly balanced roc
kers with soothing ballads.
The Distance also shows
Seger to be one of rock's
finest balladeers. On
"Comin' Home," oneisinstil
led with the sadness of the
song's young, ambitious
woman who lost her dreams
in leaving a warm home for
the cold city, while in "Shame
On The Moon" (which was
written by Rodney Crowell),
one is faced with the fears of
life and failure directly —
"When nothing comes easy,
old nightmares are real; until
you've been beside a man,
you don't know how he
feels."
As stated before, since the
album is a whole, its indi
vidual highlights cannot be
exactly pinpointed. The total
effect of "going the distance"
is enhanced as each song
progresses since they all com
plement one another. The
tension and the truth of the
album's themes invade the
listner, until one is subjected
to questioning one's own val
ues on success, life and love.
And, although the answers to
these questions may lie unre
solved, the ability to over
come the hardships is finally
seen to be the key to ap
preciating both life and The
Distance.
