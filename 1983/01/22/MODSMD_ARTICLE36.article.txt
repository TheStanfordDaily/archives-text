The Magnificent Ambersons
(1942) *
Kresge Auditorium
RKO decided that Orson
Welles had been too extravagant
with their time and money when
he made this film (his second,
right after Citizen Kanel of Booth
Tarkington's rich novel, so they
cut 40 minutes out of it and gave
him a reputation for ir
responsibility that he has never
managed to live down. But even
in its truncated form, Ambersons
is one of the great American mov
ies. It chronicles the tumbling of
the gracious, tiered society of the
late 19th and earlv 20th centuries
into the age of speed through the
descent of one grand family.
Welles evokes the declining Vic-

The Exorcist (1973)
Kresge Auditorium
An outrage. William Peter
Blattv adapted bis cheap, revolt
ing thriller about possession and
exorcism to the screen, and Wil
liam Friedkin provided extra
shocks, such as a painfully de
tatted spinal tap sequence and
close-ups of a man, flung out of a
window, hitting every step before
he splatters on the front lawn.
Friedkin is a terribly slick diretor
— he drives every charge home
(although the picture is actually
more sickening than scary) — but
what kind of human being would
be proud of making this glaringly
calculated, phony-religious, mis
anthropic mumbo-jumbo work?
Owen Roizman's photography
has moments of real elegance; El-

It*n Burstvn, as the victim's moth
er, does some fine acting in the

to bring some dignity

Days of Heaven (1978)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
It looks like a masterpiece
(Nestor Almendros and Haskell
~.~.\y6*ler shot it, Jack Fisk super
vised the art direction) and it
sounds like a masterpiece (Ennio
Morricone and Leo Kottke wrote
the score, and the experimental
sound recording makes the
dialogue echo hauntinglv) — but
in Terrence Malick's movie, set in
the midwest in the 1910s, the
characters take second place to
the compositions, and so does the

plot. As a result, We're never sure
■iXiietlv what is happening or why,
or why we're supposed to care.
It's a movie about what gorgeous
■affects talented people can man
age with camera and lighting, but
it's so static that you don't retain
much of it afterwards. With Rich
ard Gere, Brooke Adams, Sam
Shepard and Linda Manz (who
must be an acquired taste).

Paul Schrader's drama (which
he wrote with his brother
Leonard) about factory workers
who try to break both their bosses
and the corrupt union sets out to
prove that men who rebel against
the system end up being killed, co
opted or enemies (as one of the
characters explains early on), The
film achieves its purpose, but be
cause there are no surprises, it
dries out fast, despite the con
siderable talent invested in it —
that Of the three leading actors,
Harvey Keitel, Richard Pryor
and Vaphet Kotto, und that of the
photographer, Bobby Byrne, who
gives the factory scenes a dense,

rich texture (which Schrader vio
lates bv bringing the camera in
too close too much of the time).
Keitel isn't used especially well,
and Pryor seems uncomfortable
in half of his scenes —• though this
is the only nort-concert film that
has ever suggested the breadth of
his talent. But Kotto gives a
splendid demonstration of con
tained emotionaiintensUy.

Diner^M!
Memorial Auditorium
Writer-director Barry
Levinson based thiflwonderful
period piece, set in on his
own past, and every detail In it
seems deeply felt. The heroes are a
quintet of men in their early 20s
who gather to celebrate the wed
ding of one of them and to send
off the decade that saw their
adolescence. Levinson under
stands the highly emotionally
charged nature of what we call
"trivia": pop music is the
absolute against which these peo
ple measure everything that tran
spires in their lives, The acting (by
Daniel Stern, Steve Guttenberg,
Mickey Rourke, Kevin Bacon,
Timothy Daly, Ellen Barkin and
others) has the kind of veri
similitude we usually find in great
documentaries. Diner is perhaps
the most sensuous and complexly
funny rites-of-passage movie ever
made in this country.

Red Beard (1965) *
Building 420, Room 41
When this three-hour drama,
set in a clinic for the poor, lapses
into homily, we might be watch
ing Doctor Knows Best: Toshiro
Mifune plavs the title role, a gruff,
autocratic head doctor under
whose guidance an arrogant
young intern (Yttto Kayama)
grows into manhood. "Red
Beard" never quite lives up to the
reports of his personality we re
ceive in the first few minutes —
he's not a fascinating enough
character to hold this sprawling
movie together, so it splits into
episodes. However, some of the
episodes are splendid, notably
one involving an unhappy young
woman (beautifully played by
Terumi Niki) "Red Beard" re
leases from a brothelkeeper's
clutches and another about a little
bov caught stealing food from the
clinic kitchen, This film about
poverty add misplaced pride
marked the beginning of
Kurosawa's latest period, in
which he fuses mythic elements
with Renoiresquc humanism and
character detail.
