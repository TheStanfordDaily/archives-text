# Program combats departmental isolation
## New group unites grad students 
### DAVID AZRIN Senior staff writer 
A group of graduate students here hope they have started
a new Stanford tradition, weekly gatherings of graduate
students from a wide range of disciplines designed to help
them overcome "departmentalization."
"Once you're put in the department, you're lost. You
don't see people. You don't talk to anyone out of the
department. You don't have that much time," said Steven
Utt, a graduate student in bio-engineering and one of the
organizers of Grads in Common.
The Grads in Common program, a special project of the
Graduate Students Association (GSA), will include two
forums each quarter as well as weekly coffee hours at the
Old Union Clubhouse, according to organizers. The prog
ram is designed to bring graduate students from different
departments together in an intellectual and social setting.
The group held its first event yesterday, a forum entitled
"Coping with the Information Explosion" which featured
John McCarthy, father of the programming language LISP,
and Paul Kaufman, special assistant to the director of
Center for Information Technology.
Organizers called the forum a success.
" I would have been happy if we had 60 people, and we've
got about 130 people in there," said organizer Susan Bryan,
a second-year graduate student in American Literature.
"It's really the start of a Stanford tradition that we hope
will keep on going," she said.
After the forum, members of the audience split into six
small groups to discuss a set of prepared questions on issues
raised during the forum.
The project has drawn a great deal of interest from
graduate students here, according to Bryan. Students from
more than 12 departments have volunteered to help, she
said.
"You mention this to people and they just get excited

about helping," Bryan said.
The program may also help graduate students become a
stronger force in influencing University policy decisions,
particularly policy decisions on graduate student housing
and research-industry ties, according to Eric Berg, GSA
treasurer.
"We are hoping that people will gain a sense of a graduate
community, that they are facing a lot of similar issues and
problems. And we hope people will find out more about the
GSA and get more involved," Berg said.
Organizers said they also hope the program will help
graduate students realize the value of interdisciplinary
studies, according to organizer Michele Fisher, director of
the Center for Teaching and Learning.
"We want to make people more aware that there are
valid (interdisciplinary) programs and that interdisciplinary
scholarship can be attractive," she said.
Berg said the group is planning at least three more forums
this year.
"We see it as a really valuable opportunity for graduate
students to get together in an informal atmosphere. By
setting up a program and discussions afterwards, there will
be a setting for people to talk to people they don't already
know. The topics were chosen to appeal to a broad range of
people," said Berg.
Coffee hours will provide a regular social meeting place
for graduate students, said GSA president Dirk Van Com
pernolle.
"There's no meeting place for graduate students. It's
much harder for graduate students to get out and meet each
other. At the undergraduate level, the dorms provide the
main social contact." said Van Compernolle.
According to Berg, "people don't find the cafeteria very
attractive and some people think the Coffee House is too
crowded."
