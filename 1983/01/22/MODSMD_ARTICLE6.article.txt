# Quarter system favored
## 
### KEVIN GROSS Staff writer 
A report released this week by an ad
hoc Faculty Senate committee recom
mends that the University retain the
academic quarter system.
In addition, the report encouraged
deans and departments to consider ex
perimenting with continuing courses
and course sequences, such as the His
tory 1-2-3 sequence.
"We thought that a given course
might spill over from one quarter to the
next, but would not necessarily meet
for the whole next quarter," said
Committee Chairman Edwin Good, a
religious studies professor. He added
that departments might also consider
having classes start during the middle
of one quarter and go through the end
of the next quarter.
The committee has been meeting for
about a year, discussing the possibility
of a switch to a system of 14-week
semesters or flexible, five-week terms
named Golubs, after Computer Sci
ence Prof. Gene Golub, who suggested
the system.
In an informal Daily survey of sev
eral undergraduates, most said they
agree with the committee's recom
mendation to retain the quarter sys
tem.
"We like it," said Tucker Ford, a
senior industrial engineering major,
when asked about the quarter system.
" I can only take the same kind of prob
lem sets for 10 weeks," she said.
Sophomore Terry Vann, a transfer
student, said, "I like the quarter sys
tem. Sure beats the Old Miss semester
system."
Among the most common reasons
cited in support of the quarter system
were greater variety in course availabil
ity, less time for procrastination, and
less time spent in a boring class.
According to Industrial Engineering
Prof. Charles Kruger, another commit
tee member, most engineering profes
sors feel the quarter system works well
for teaching their courses. "Changing
over to another system would be a tre
mendous disruption. We prefer the
quarter system. It allows us to teach
different length courses and gives us.
more flexibility than other systems," he
said.
Education Prof. Elizabeth Cohen
was among those on the committee
who disagreed with the final report. In
submitting a minority report for the
committee. Cohen said that it was im
portant to get her colleagues to think
about their teaching techniques, rather
than the system of quarters or semes
ters.
"Is teaching adjusted to the quarter
system? Does a professor try to cram a
semester's work into a quarter?" she
asked. "I felt it was implied in the re
port that wc have such wonderful stu
dents at Stanford that it doesn't matter
what we do."
Yet. Cohen said that a recent study
of Chicano students at five universities
by the Center for Research on Women
suggests that teaching techniques may
need to be revised to accommodate
some students on the quarter system.
"It is a drawback for foreign students
as well," said Cohen. She speculated
that a study of all students would reach
the same conclusion — that more stu
dents felt they had difficulty getting
their work done on time in the quarter
than in the semester system.
But some students told the Daily
they felt greater motivation to study
and do homework in the quarter sys
tem, saying that friends at other col
leges partied for a longer period of time
at the beginning of the term.
According to Terry Tseng, a senior
majoring in communication and
sociology, "I think the longer time I
have to procrastinate, the more chance
I have that I won't do as well."
