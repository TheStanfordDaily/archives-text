# The 						Bridge: a place to turn even if you just need to talk
## 
### MARY CATHERINE FISH Staff writer 
What did you do the last time anxiety over school work
had you fearing one more bit of pressure would reduce you
to mental wreckage? How about after that fight with your
girlfriend or boyfriend, when you were so upset that you
couldn't concentrate on anything else? Remember those
frustrations that come along when you simply can't seem to
get your act together? How many times would it just be nice
to have someone to talk to, someone who would listen?
The Bridge is the largest peer counseling program at
Stanford. It is staffed by students who have completed
thorough training and evaluations. Working from the pre

mise that there is much help and support in counseling
through personal interaction, Bridge staffers will listen and
discuss problems or feelings of all types.
Located at 640 Campus Drive, next to Campus Bike
Shop, The Bridge is open Monday through Friday, 12-10
p.m. and Friday 10-6 p.m. Counselors also answer phone
calls 10 p.m.-8 a.m. every night. Much of the counseling is
done over the phone (497-3392).
Since counselors are students, they can relate to experi
ences we share here. All have taken a Peer Counseling class
(LAC 172), which is recommended not only for Bridge
staffers, but for anyone who wants to improve communica
tion techniques.

Four students are live-in counselors, who have at least a
quarter's experience. They help teach the counseling class,
take care of problems as they come up, and end up overse
eing many Bridge activities. According to Amy Mar, one of
the live-ins, people get involved in counseling to different
extents. Some take the class and use it in other areas such as
being an RA or just a better friend. Others may counsel for
only a quarter or so, and some continue for longer periods
of time.
The number of part-time counselors who make up the
staff varies; usually there are around 15. Michael McGee is
a medical student who puts in several hours per week as a
Bridge counselor. He said, "It's great. 1 really enjoy it. It's
rewarding to be trained to counsel and to have those skills,
then to be able to use them to help other people."
McGee feels The Bridge is a service that students should
use more. "Talking and having somebody to listen to you
and help you explore a problem or issueis really therapeutic
. .. Talking about it is a lot more effective than milling it
over."
He noted that about 10 to 20 calls are received per week
and talked about the attitude some have toward talking to
counselors. Many think counselors are only for "sick" per
sons or for maladjusted people with serious problems. Seek
ing counseling may be looked at as a sign of weakness.
McGee thinks, "If people knew it were OK to have prob
lems and if it were OK to talk about them, then I think more
people would use it."
So if you feel confused, lonely, or depressed, why not just
call a friend? Though friends are willing to help and con
cerned, few people possess intuitively the listening skills
that come with training. Counselors also offer a fresh
perspective, and anonymity.
The Gay Counseling Group works out of The Bridge.
Gay counselors are available to talk about specific problems
of gay people. They also maintain files of information about
other Bay Area organizations and services.
Another aspect of The Bridge is its unique workshops,
which are offered each quarter. Winter's offerings include
Yoga, Natural Weight Control, Bread Baking, Self-
Hypnosis and Meditation. Groups are usually small, around
a dozen.
One of the more popular Bridge workshops is its massage

workshop. They will be given in student residences
throughout the quarter, and arrangements can be made to
have one in your dorm by calling The Bridge. These are also
used to spread awareness of The Bridge and its services.
The biggest fund-raiser for The Bridge is the annual
Spring Crafts Faire. Bridge staffers organize and oversee
the whole thing. The Bridge also sponsors Mental Health
Week, with the help of Residential Education and Counsel
ing and Psychological Services (CAPS). This is the second
week in February and will be highlighted by workshops as
well as large lectures on campus. Speakers will be people
from Cowell Student Health Center in addition to other
professionals in the Mental Health field.

friend. The staff atThe Bridge enjoy using their train
ing to help people, but fear that most people think
counseling is something you turn to only if you're weak
or have a serious problem.
