## The
						Stanford Daily Last winter remembered 
### 
More than a year has passed since a campus rape
was reported in these pages and we are certainly
not the only ones who are relieved by this fact.
Unfortunately, it seems that a collective feeling of
relief has been supplanted by a false sense of secu
rity in recent months. A significant indicator of the
current attitude surfaced last week when it was
made known that the Students United for Rape
Elimination (SURE) escort service was seriously
understaffed. At the height of rape awareness last
winter, more than 60 volunteers filled the ranks of
SURE's escort service. Now, less than half that
number are on the rolls and SURE is finding it
difficult to operate during its regular 8 p.m. to 12
midnight hours, let alone provide escorts for early
evening hours.
Those who remember last winter's level of
"awareness" have not forgotten the uneasiness
that gripped the campus each night and the often
disturbing reports that came with the morning
news. It is no wonder that SURE's ranks swelled at
that time as students united in response to a com
mon threat.
We realize that in many ways encouraging "rape
awareness" is a euphemistic way of advocating a
"climate of fear ; "and we want to make it clear that
this is by no means our ideal. What we do advocate
is a higher level of awareness and concern among
all members of the Stanford community. "The
problems work in a cycle," said Dean of Student

Affairs Jim Lyons, and we think his words point to
something that few of us are willing to consider:
unless we are willing to accept a repetition of the
past, we must not forget what it brought.
More concretely, we encourage students to take
responsibility for each other. We congratulate
those SURE volunteers who have persevered at a
time when the need for their services is less appa
rent but just as real. And we appreciate the fact
that many students regularly offer to escort their
dormmates on a "free-lance" basis. The Univer
sity, as well, has shown marked concern: the im
provements made in campus lighting have not
gone unnoticed.
Still, we fear that not enough is being done. We
hope that Stanford community members will re
examine their current attitudes and that concern
for one other will take the place of self-interest and
convenience. Even the University's very vocal
support of safety efforts is sometimes lacking in
substance; perhaps financial assistance — in addi
tion to the loan that was made to allow the pur
chase of a golf cart (the SURE mobile) — should
be given to help recruit needed volunteers and
promote safety.
Perhaps it seems strange to some that we should
be so concerned about events which have faded
into the past. We write now because we'd like to
prevent them from recurring now or in the future.
