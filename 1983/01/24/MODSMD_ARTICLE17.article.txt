## MNCs encourage MNC development 
### 
Melvyn Krauss's article ("MNCs en
courage LDC development", Daily,
Jan. 19) praises the multinational cor
poration (MNC) as one of the marvels
of the modern economic world. It is
good practice, however, to examine
closely all such pronouncements before
accepting them as literal truth. When
Krauss' assertions are examined, one
finds that his statements are not only
incorrect, but they run completely con
trary to the ideals of both democratic
socialism and free-market conser
vatism.
Krauss believes that the MNCs rep
resent a positive good in the relation
ship between the industrialized coun
tries and the less-developed ones
(LDCs): "Multinationals integrate the
world economy. Otherwise fragmented
labor markets, commodity markets and
capital markets in the South are unified
with their Northern counterparts by
the multinationals to provide true
world markets for products and factors
of production."
What Krauss doesn't say is probably
more important than what he does say.
Because of the lack of strong labor un
ions in most LDCs, the multinational
can get away with paying little more
than subsistance wages to its foreign
workers. If these countries are to
purchase the finished products, how
ever, the prices they must pay aren't
significantly Jower than prices here.
They must pay American prices for
goods while earning no more than a
fraction of American wages.
Also, many MNC operations involve
only a few specific parts bching man
ufactured in LDCs while the finished
product is assembled elsewhere. The
net effect is that the MNCs maintain
thcsame old colonial relationships be
tween the industrialized and Third
World: the LDCs are sources of cheap
labor and markets for finished products
and thus never develop a real economic
infrastructure of their own.
In respone to the Brandt Commis

sion's accusations that the MNCs
evaded taxes by shifting reported profits
from countries of high taxation to
countries of low tax rates, Krauss
applauded this strategy as one that
justly penalized governments with
"high" tax rates. "But are high taxes in
the interests of society when they stag
nate growth, create scarcities and in
duce corruption?" This attitude seems
to exemplify the monetarist's desire for
a free market. Nevertheless, the mod
ern multinational makes a farce of the
free market doctrine.
The modern MNC can increase its
bargaining position with labor unions
in industrialized nations by showing

only a small profit in the home nation.
It can create "loss-making" sections in
industrialized nations for tax purposes.
It can actually lose money in some
areas simply to gain control of a market
and thus artificially decrease competi
tion. It can make money from currency
fluctuations. The above factors, then,
make "free market" little more than a
rallying cry. In the long run, the
monopolistic tendencies of MNCs con
tribute more to inflation through ad
ministered pricing and fixed minimum
profits (cost-push inflation) than the
inherently evil fiscal policies of gov
ernments ever could.
Krauss believes that the MNC
should be looked upon as a champion
of popular control in governments. "In
the modern world, it is government —
not multinational corporations — that
is out of control. To the extent that the

multinationals help control govern
ments by inducing competition bet
ween them, they render a valuable ser
vice." This view seems to see the MNC
as a dragonslayer when in actuality it is
the dragon. When the MNCs avoid
paying taxes, the middle- and lower
class American must take up the slack.
In addition to a negative subsidy to the
MNCs, there is also a positive one. The
U.S. taxpayer, by way of the govern
ment, is either loaning or giving great
sums of money to the LDCs. This
money is used to make interest pay
ments to multinational banks or purch
ase finished goods from multinational
manufacturers. Ineffect, the American

middle- and lower-class sudsidizes the
MNCs by paying taxes for them and
giving them money through various
channels.
Krauss was correct on one point. He
stated that the main priority of MNCs
was to their stockholders, which of
course means more profits. As we have
seen, this accumulation of profits
comes at the expense of taxpayers
(mainly the middle class and working
poor) and the peoples of the LDCs. In
his zeal to defend the corporate in
terest, Krauss condemns taxes and in
flationary government policies. He
neglects to mention the negative as
pects of the MNCs, namely the increase
in maldistribution of wealth in this
country, cost-push inflation, and the
detrimental effects on the economies of
the less-developed countries.
