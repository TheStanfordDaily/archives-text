## Is Freedman's work in the Feminist Studies Dept. 'service?' 
### 
Dean of Humanities and Sciences
Norm Wessells' letter about the tenure
process (Daily, Jan. 5) discusses the
way University service is counted in
tenure decisions. Although it is under
standable that the dean could not dis
cuss details of his office's recent denial
of tenure to Prof. Estelle Freedman, it
would %c important to know whether
Freedman's work in the Feminist
Studies Program is seen as "service" or
"teaching" in evaluating her for te
nure. It carf be argued that develop
ment of curriculum and design of
courses is part of a faculty member's
teaching responsibilities.
Freedman.is a primary architect of
the Feminist Studies Program. She in
fluenced significantly the curriculum
for the major and the content of
courses within the major. She has
worked zealously to develop a core
curriculum that is academically rigor
ous and consistent with the ideals of
feminist scholarship and research.
Freedman's shaping influence is re
flected not just in the courses that are
part of the Feminist Studies cur
riculum, nor in the shape of the major,
but in the standards of scholarship she
sets for her students and colleagues.
Freedman's qualities of mind and

dedication to feminist scholarship in
fluenced the intellectual interests and
scholarly pursuits of her colleagues on
the faculty. Professors Nan Keohane
(now president of Wellesley College)
and Diane Middlebrook (currently a
Fellow at the Bunting Institute at
Radcliffe) were just beginning to do
work in the field of feminist studies
when they served with Freedman on
the committee to design the new
Feminist Studies program. Both credit
Freedman with influencing their own
intellectual development and interest
in feminist scholarship. With Prof.
Shelly Rosaldo, Freedman served as a
leader to and a teacher of other faculty
members at Stanford as well as to stu
dents in this new area of interdiscipli
nary study.
I have been heartened in recent
years to hear University President
Donald Kennedy and Wessells speak
publicly in support of CROW, "Signs"
and the Feminist Studies Program. It
has also been encouraging to hear re
newed commitment to affirmative ac
tion goals, which Wessells' letter on te
nure states can come into play at crucial
points in some tenure decisions. As a
member of the Feminist Studies Com
mittee, I hope that those responsible

for reviewing the decision in Freed
man's case view her work in developing
the Feminist Studies Program as part of
her excellent record of teaching, not
merely as service to the University, and
reverse a decision that makes some of
us wonder whether the commitments
to feminist scholarship and affirmative
action can be affirmed when they count
most.

Casual guise
Alec Rawls ("Battling the Ethos of
'Casual'," Daily, Jan. 19) addresses a
concern of mine which, more than im
minent finals or paper deadlines, has
kept me awake many nights. The ap
proximation of happiness seems to be a
rampant disease at Stanford, hidden
under the guise of casualness. Being
casual is dishonest, because life is never
trivial to the one who is living it. But
honesty is an endangered species.

especially on this campus. I am speak
ing of true honesty, opening oneself up ;
and looking inside, facing what's there
and acting on it.
i
It's not "Who should I be now?" or
"How am I coming across?" that
should be asked, but rather "Am I
being honest?" or "Is this really me?"
These questions are the foundation for ,
almost every other question you'll ask k
yourself: "Do I really want to be a doc
tor?," "Am 1 doing this just to pad my
resume or for myself?," "Is money re- ;
ally that important to me?," "Do Ire- ;
ally care for this person more than I'm 1
admitting to myself?" Once you com
mit yourself to honesty, the answers
should come clearly and often rela
tively easily. From there, it's a short
step to communicating honesty with
others, creating closer and more enjoy- ;
able relationships, perhaps even (dare I ,
say it?) falling in love. But the process
must start with yourself; if you want to
cut through the 8.5., start with a little
housecleaning. Above all, stop
"thrashing to stay afloat." It doesn't
have to be that hard.

feminist scholarship and research.
Freedman's shaping influence is re
flected not just in the courses that are
part of the Feminist Studies cur
riculum, nor in the shape of the major,
but in the standards of scholarship she
sets for her students and colleagues.
Freedman's qualities of mind and

dedication to feminist scholarship in
fluenced the intellectual interests and
scholarly pursuits of her colleagues on
the faculty. Professors Nan Keohane
(now president of Wellesley College)
and Diane Middlebrook (currently a
Fellow at the Bunting Institute at
Radcliffe) were just beginning to do
work in the field of feminist studies
when they served with Freedman on
the committee to design the new
Feminist Studies program. Both credit
Freedman with influencing their own
intellectual development and interest
in feminist scholarship. With Prof.
Shelly Rosaldo, Freedman served as a
leader to and a teacher of other faculty
members at Stanford as well as to stu
dents in this new area of interdiscipli
nary study.
I have been heartened in recent
years to hear University President
Donald Kennedy and Wessells speak
publicly in support of CROW, "Signs"
and the Feminist Studies Program. It
has also been encouraging to hear re
newed commitment to affirmative ac
tion goals, which Wessells' letter on te
nure states can come into play at crucial
points in some tenure decisions. As a
member of the Feminist Studies Com
mittee, I hope that those responsible

for reviewing the decision in Freed
man's case view her work in developing
the Feminist Studies Program as part of
her excellent record of teaching, not
merely as service to the University, and
reverse a decision that makes some of
us wonder whether the commitments
to feminist scholarship and affirmative
action can be affirmed when they count
most.

Casual guise
Alec Rawls ("Battling the Ethos of
'Casual'," Daily, Jan. 19) addresses a
concern of mine which, more than im
minent finals or paper deadlines, has
kept me awake many nights. The ap
proximation of happiness seems to be a
rampant disease at Stanford, hidden
under the guise of casualness. Being
casual is dishonest, because life is never
trivial to the one who is living it. But
honesty is an endangered species.

especially on this campus. I am speak
ing of true honesty, opening oneself up ;
and looking inside, facing what's there
and acting on it.
i
It's not "Who should I be now?" or
"How am I coming across?" that
should be asked, but rather "Am I
being honest?" or "Is this really me?"
These questions are the foundation for ,
almost every other question you'll ask k
yourself: "Do I really want to be a doc
tor?," "Am 1 doing this just to pad my
resume or for myself?," "Is money re- ;
ally that important to me?," "Do Ire- ;
ally care for this person more than I'm 1
admitting to myself?" Once you com
mit yourself to honesty, the answers
should come clearly and often rela
tively easily. From there, it's a short
step to communicating honesty with
others, creating closer and more enjoy- ;
able relationships, perhaps even (dare I ,
say it?) falling in love. But the process
must start with yourself; if you want to
cut through the 8.5., start with a little
housecleaning. Above all, stop
"thrashing to stay afloat." It doesn't
have to be that hard.
