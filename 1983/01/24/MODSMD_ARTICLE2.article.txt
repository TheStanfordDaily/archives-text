# Stanford West may be reduced
## Palo Alto City Council to decide on size of housing project 
### LESLIE WEEDEN 
The Palo Alto Planning Commission
voted last Thursday to recommend a 24
percent reduction in size of the pro
posed Stanford West housing devel
opment, jeopardizing current Univer
sity plans for the project.
However, the commission will also
urge the council to consider an incen
tive plan that would approve the origi
nal 1469-unit size planned for the Wil
low Rd. project if the University agrees
to provide more lower-cost units' and
designate certain University lands as
open space.
University officials fear that a reduc
tion in the number of units in the de
velopment might make individual units
too expensive for Stanford faculty and
staff.
The commission, which has been
studying the project and its environ
mental effects for five months, will
make its recommendations to the Palo
Alto City Council, which must approve
the University's plans before construc
tion can begin.
The commission decided to ask the
University to reduce the number of
units planned for the north side of Wil
low Road by 355, from 1275 to 920.
The 194 units planned on Welch Road
were approved.
Frank Morrow, University director

of real estate, said he was getting more
and more worried that, if the City
Council upholds the commission's rec
ommendations, the University will be
unable to build affordable housing for
faculty and staff.
The proposed reduction in units
would raise the average cost of the re
maining units by $7500, according to
Morrow.
He said that on the positive side the
Planning Commission certified that the
findings of the draft Environmental
Impact Report (EIR) were adequate.
But he decried the commission's rec
ommendation to reduce the number of
units north of Willow Road.
"It makes me angry," he said.
"There is no need to develop at that
low a density. There are no data in the
EIR that support such a reduction."
Andy Doty, director of community
relations, said Planning Commissioner
Jack Sutorious deserves credit for try
ing to come up with a plan that would
please both sides.
According to the plan, Stanford
would be able to "earn" up to 400 addi
tional units by providing three lower
priced units for each additional unit al
lowed.
Stanford plans to sell 15 percent of
the units at below market rates.
Nevertheless, the average one

bedroom unit will reportedly sell for
$101,250 to $127,500; the three
bedroom units from $202,500 to
$255,000. However, Doty believes the
quoted figures are too high. He said
that Morrow is looking for an average
of about $150,000.
Under Sutorious' plan, "lower-cost"
means affordable to people earning
120 to 150 percent of the county me
dian income, which for a family of three
is $28,200.
The proposal would also allow Stan
ford to add up to 255 additional units
by setting aside certain other lands as
open space.
Morrow said that trading other Stan
ford lands"is not something we can live
with." The board of trustees strongly
opposes the notion of designating Uni
versity land as permanent open space
to gain city approval of a project, ac
cording to Doty.
In addition to a reduction in the
number of units, the commission, in a
34-page report, proposed other re
quirements to cut down on the en
vironmental effects of the project.
These range from improving 13 inter
sections on Willow Road to the con
struction of bike paths.
"Again these are not directly related
to the EIR . . . again they will unneces
sarily raise the cost of the project,"
Morrow said.
Doty said, "I think Stanford is taking
a long, hard look at the total costs in
volved in the project if all the (recom
mended) mitigations are required by
the city." He said that the University
will come up with a total based on the
estimated cost of each of the require
ments, which they will then discuss with
the city staff.
"I think there is room for negotia
tions," he said.
Doty said he believes that both sides
want the housing badly. In fact the city
encouraged the University to devise
plans for a housing project due to the
critical discrepancy between jobs and
housing in Palo Alto. Doty said the city
is just worried about the project's im
pact.
"The city is saying if we approve the
housing we want you to take responsi
bility for lessening its impact," he said.
Doty said that according to the EIR,
the impact of the project alone "is not
great." It is the "cumulative impacts"
that inspired the long list of mitiga
tions.
As an example, Doty explained that
if an intersection has a limit on traffic
flow and if traffic — no matter how
light — from Stanford West makes it
exceed that limit, the University would
be expected to pay for the required
improvements.
The University disagrees, believing
such improvements should be funded
from tax monies, according to Doty.
Requirements involving Willow
Road include improving 13 intersec
tions, widening the road and adding
turn lanes.
The commission's discussion of the
project's density came after the ap
proval of certain environmental propo
sals concerning predicted air pollution,
traffic and noise levels in the EIR.
Menlo Park also wants to review the
matter. However, according to Menlo
Park Councilwoman Peg Gunn, the
city council there will not vote on the
project." We have authority," she said.
"All we can do is negotiate on the basis
of a good neighbor policy."
Even before the Planning Commis
sion reached its decision, Gunn had
voiced concern over the impact of the
project and had requested a meeting
with President Donald Kennedy. The
meeting, she said, is scheduled for Jan.
27.
