# Notes in the Margin
## Communication and tolerance 
### 
What if we could journey back in
time? If we try to imagine it, a picture
like this might come to mind: no tele
phone poles, no power lines, funny
clothes, no modern conveniences and
perhaps a few cows in a field.
But what is not often considered in
putting ourselves in these make
believe scenarios is what we would
have to take out of our minds. Depend
ing on the place and time, our concep
tions of self, morality, and place in the
universe of things might have to be re
placed and rigid blinders inserted. This
applies not only to past centuries, but
even to as recently as a few decades
ago.
What sets these times apart from the
present are developments in two areas:
communications (means of message
sending) and intellectual tolerance
(willingness to accept new messages).
If mankind has indeed made, any prog
ress since achieving a certain basic,level
of intellectual development, the
greatest gain leading to progress in all
fields has been in the breakdown of
parochialism and concomitant intellec
tual torpor.
Why then do nations, members of
different cultures and the two sexes
continue to suffer problems of com
munication and stagnated interrela
tional misunderstanding? Many factors
are involved: different definitions,
different needs, but especially
differences in comparative power. It is
in this last area that our era's claim to
"progressiveness" is most debatable.
Among governments, unfavorable
messages from the small states to the
large (Afghanistan-Soviet Union,
Honduras-United States, even Euro
pean nations-superpowers) are
routinely ignored or even altered to fit
favorable modes of reception. Simi
larly, messages from sub-cultures to
dominant cultures in nations of mixed
ethnicity often receive attention com
parable only to that sub-culture's per
cent of the population. And between
men and women, the success of the re
cent movie Tootsie points out popular
recognition of enduring problems of
flawed communication and "stereotyp
ing."
With these thoughts in mind, the
smugness and self-assuredness of
medieval ignorance might not seem far
removed. But to succumb to this type
of intellectual defeatism is like not
picking up one's grades after studying

hard for a whole quarter — there have
been some major accomplishments.
In the area of science, the demise of
unfounded theories and the sub
sequent rushes of progress and under
standing have been particularly notice
able. While in the 15th century one
could talk about falling off the earth's
edge among respectable company,
today nightly news programs show
satellite views of our rotating globe on
the weather report. In social affairs, the
breaking of intellectual barriers
through the spread of ideas has been
slower, but of similarly dynamic effect.

Clearly, intellectual and moral conformism are
still with us today. And the complex problems of
toda/s world (some created by the very
technologies that have helped us) make a
time-tunnel regression to the 12 th Century seem
like a return to the Garden of Eden. It is a tempting
picture in many respects.

Recent centuries have witnessed the
dwindling of unquestioned faith and
senseless ritual in various religious and
ethical systems. The Protestant revival
in the 1970s was built on tolerance and
talking, rather than spiritualism and as
ceticism. The results of these social de
velopments (and the growth of interna
tional communication) have been an
unprecedented closeness among
peoples and applications of thought to
shared problems: poverty, war, over
crowding and reckonings with exis
tence itself.
Within nations, ethnic communities
once had an almost dictatorial role in
the lives of their offspring. Secular edu
cation and the mass media particularly
the latter part of this century have
opened a plurality of opportunities.
The mixing of ideas have led to a
greater degree of personal decision
making in formulation of one's moral
code. And for minorities television
provided a new and vivid forum in the
1950s and 1960s for the exposure of
discrimination.

Innovations in almost instantaneous -•
worldwide video and sound communi- ..
cations helped bring the Vietnam War
to a quicker end. The new recognition ..-i
of war's terror brought on by the pre
sence nightly of war footage on televi
sion was the touchstone for much polit- ::
ical dissent: overcoming American
traditions of unquestioned respect for • ■
government and fervent anti- .-
communism. (Notably, the Soviet
Union warily keeps a veritable news i
blackout on their Afghan war.)
Yet developments in the social..,
sphere have come through periods of

vicious conformism and enforced ig
norance: heretics were burned at the
stake in Old New England, Jews were -
incinerated under the Third Reich and .
thousands of Americans lost careers
and respectability in the plague of
McCarthyism.
Clearly, intellectual and moral con
formism are still with us today. And the
complex problems of today's world
(some created by the very tchnologies
that have helped us) make a time-,
tunnel regression to the 12th Century ;
seem like a return to the Garden of
Eden. It is a tempting picture in many
respects. •
However, the means for solving:
problems of misunderstanding and ig- i
norance have never been so great. Will
ingness to use these tools to our advan
tage in challenging our knowledge and ■.
beliefs is another question. Progress
comes with tolerance, if we can consis
tently stand up for the necessity of the j
reverse.
