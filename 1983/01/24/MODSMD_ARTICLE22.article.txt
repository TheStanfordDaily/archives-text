## Foster fires in 31; UCLA rips Cardinal 
### STEVE ODELL 
UCLA All-America guard
Rod Foster gunned down Stan
ford Saturday night, scoring 31
points in a remarkable outside
shooting performance to lead the
No. 1 Bruins to a 101-87
Pacific-10 Conference basket
ball victory over the Cardinal be
fore 8000 vocal fans at a sold-out
Maples Pavilion.
It was a season-high for Fos
ter, who scored all 11 of his field
goals on his highly accurate
long-range jump shot. Foster,
who set a NCAA record for free
throw percentage last season
(.950), also went nine-of-nine at
the line.
"Foster's a tremendous
ballplayer," said Stanford coach
Tom Davis. "And they did a
good job getting the ball to him.
We just wztnted to put pressure
on him within the framework of
our defense. But you're looking
at a two-prong situation. If you
go out and get him (Foster) at 20
feet, then the guys inside will
beat you at two feet.
"When you've got good guys
outside and inside, I guess that's
why you're the No. 1 team in the
nation."
The Cardinal, forced to play
without leading scorer and re
bounder John Revelli, who sat
out with an injured ankle, tiailed
by just two at halftime. But the
combination of Foster outside
and Bruin forward Kenny Fields
inside finally wore down Stan
ford, which fell to 10-5 overall
and 2-3 in the Pac-10.
With Revelli out, junior Hans
Wichary assumed the starting
center position and responded
by scoring a career-high 20
points on 8-of-10 shooting from
the floor and gr .bbing a team
high eight rebounds. Also pick
ing up considerable slack was
forward and sixth man Johnny
Rogers, who banged home a
season-high 20 points, hitting on
10-of-14 field goal attempts in
another strong performance.
"It was really a shock not to
have him (Revelli) out there,"
said Davis. "He's meant so much
to this team. But we adjusted
pretty well. I thought Wichary
and (reserve center Dave)
Nussbaum did a nice job. There
were some negatives in there,
but a lot of good things also."
Revelli's absence was felt most
acutely on the boards. When
Foster did misfire, which was
rare,* the Bruins- battered the
Cardinal for 16 offensive re
bounds. UCLA outrebounded
Stanford overall by a healthy
40-26 margin and blocked six
Cardinal shots.
If Foster showed why he is the
foremost shooting guard in the
country, Fields showed why he is
the best offensive forward.
Fields scored 22 points and
grabbed 10 rebounds from all
areas on the court, including two
one-hand slam dunks off alley
oop passes from Ralph Jackson,
who had six assists. The "other"
forward of the pair of top col
legiate corner men in the coun
try, Darren Daye, scored 16

points and also passed off for six
assists in just 25 minutes of play.
Stanford executed well, com
mitting just 12 turnovers against
constant Bruin pressure, as op
posed to its season average of
20-plus. The Cardinal played
mostly against a UCLA 3-2
match-up zone defense after
Daye and Fields got into early
foul trouble.
"I was pleased with a lot of
things we did," said Davis.
"Emotionally down the stretch
we weren't as tough with the ball.
But UCLA has a lot of great
players and they do that to a lot
of people."
The game got out of Stanford's
reach midway through the sec
ond half, due in large part to the
Bruins's 64 percent field goal
shooting in the final 20 minutes.
UCLA had already started to
pull away Foster and Fields
combining for 12 of the Bruins'
first 16 points in the half, and
UCLA led 60-50 with 14:15 re
maining.
Stanford's last glimmer was
provided by forward Andy
Fischer, who pulled the Cardinal
to within seven on a falling-back
muscle shot inside on which he
was hammered by UCLA center
Stuart Gray. The ball fell, the
crowd rose, and Fischer sunk the
free throw, completing the
three-point play to cut the lead
to seven.
UCLA followed with two
three-point plays of its own.
Gray tipped in a Foster miss with
Wichary on his back and made
the foul shot to complete the first
three-pointer, and after a Stan
ford miss, Daye found Foster in
the right corner for a 22-foot
jump shot which he hit as Stan
ford guard Keith Jones, who
finished with 19 points, flew
through the air and slapped his
wrist.
After Foster's free throw,
UCLA regained possession after
another Card miss and Fields
took a pass from Daye for a fast
break lay-in over Ricky Lewis
that made the score 68-53 with
12:27 remaining. The Bruin
blitzkreig had hit with speed and
force, UCLA scoring eight
straight points in just under a
minute to secure its sixth confer
ence win without a loss.
The Cardinal called timeout to
regroup, and was successful
momentarily, following with a
five-point streak which included
a Nussbaum foul shot, a Rogers
turnaround jump shot and a
Jones drive past Holton and
Brad Wright for a lay-in to bring
the Card to within 10. Stanford
cut the deficit to eight with 7:53
remaining at 74-66 on two
Wichary foul shots, but it was as
close as the Cardinal would come
the rest of the way, and the
Bruins won going away.
Unlike in the Cardinal's 92-74
win over USC Thursday night,
when it made 38 free throws (in
45 attempts), to establish a new
Stanford record for most free
throws in a game, the Cardinal
hit on only 17-of-26 foul shots
for 65 percent against the

Bruins, eight percentage points
lower than its seasonal average.
The Cardinal tied the score
twice in the closing minutes of
the first half, pulling even the
first time after a six-point burst
made it 38-38 with 2:53 left.
Wichary hit a turnaround
jumper off the glass over Gray,
Fischer hit a 10-footer off a nice
feed from a driving Keith
Ramee, and Wichary followed
with a turnaround jumper inside
off an inbounds pass.
The Cardinal led briefly 4-2,
before a Bruin streak of eight
straight points gave them a lead
they never relinquished.
Davis was unsure as to
whether Revelli, who watched
Saturday's game in street
clothes, would be able to play
this weekend at Washington and
Washington State. "He could be
out for awhile," Davis said after
the game. "He couldn't walk on
it today, and I'd have to say he's
questionable for next week."
