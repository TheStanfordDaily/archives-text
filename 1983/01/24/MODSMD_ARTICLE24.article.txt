# Gymnastics teams win over weekend
## Men beat Cal for first time in 11 years 
### SARAH CARREL 
Stanford's men's gymnas
tics team beat arch-rival Cal
at Maples Pavilion Friday
night with an all-time Stan
ford record score of 270.55 to
Cal's 259.75. The University
of Calgary pulled up third in
the tri-meet with a score of
215.05.
It had been 11 years since
the Cardinal defeated the
Bears, and it is the first time
ever for Stanford's head
coach Sadao Hamada who
came to the Farm 10 years
ago.
"This is the best team I've
had at Stanford. It feels
great," Hamada said.
Stanford swept the all
around as freshman Jon Levy
scored the highest with 55.40.
Except for a slip on the paral
lel bars, Levy scored above
9.0 in all events. Individually,
Levy placed first in the floor
exercise, pommel horse, rings
and high bar.
The New Orleans native at
tributed much of the team's
success to its strong opening
on the pommel horse, usually
the most difficult event for
Stanford.
"We got off to a good
start," said Levy. "With that
behind us, all we had to look
forward to was better
events."
Freshman Gary Smith was
a close second in the all
around. Smith achieved the
highest individual event score
of the meet with a 9.65 in the
vault as well as winning the
parallel bars with a 9.1. Thus,
between Levy and Smith,
Stanford took first in every
event of the meet.
Third in the all-around was
Stanford's Kirk Druey, with a
53.20. Druey was particularly
strong with flair in the floor
exercises, along with Cardinal
Ed Gresser, who specializes
in that event.
Stanford was thankful for
the return of mainstay Jim
Campanelli, who was able to
compete on the pommel
horse while recovering from
an arm injury. Campanelli's
9.25 in that event was the

boost that Stanford needed to
start the meet strongly.
Coach Hamada also named
Chris Smith as instrumental.
Smith has improved a good
deal in the past week, and was
really able to get his routines
together in time to beat Cal,
including a 9.4 in the vault.
"This is our first competi
tion since Christmas when the
whole team has really been
together," said Hamada.
"Before the meet I told the
team we had two main goals
... to beat Cal and to score
over 270.1 am happy because
we reached both those main
objectives."

The Stanford women's
gymnastics team performed
well in spite of unfavorable
equipment conditions in its
victory over UC-Santa Bar
bara Saturday.
Facing such conditions as
non-regulation landing mats
and a slippery vaulting run
way, the Stanford women still
won by a score of 167.76 to
161.2. Each school fielded
two teams, and both Stanford
teams triumphed.
"One of the best things
about this meet was the depth
and cohesiveness displayed
by the team," said Stanford
coach Homer Sardina. All 10
gymnasts competed in the
all-around, including junior
Anne Friend, who made her
first appearance since injur
ing her knee in her freshman
year.
Junior Kim Strauss had to
ad lib the second half of her
bar routine after missing a
move and ending up facing
the wrong direction.
Top performer of the meet
was Cardinal sophomore
Angie Barnes, who won the
uneven parallel bars and the
all-around with a score of
34.35. Senior Karen Hall won
the vault and floor exercises,
and Kim Strauss tied with
UCSB's Ginaia Bernardini
for the balance beam win.
