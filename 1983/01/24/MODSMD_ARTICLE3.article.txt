Storm socks Bay Area; more on the way
San Francisco — Gusts up to 68 mph blew a violent Pacific storm into
Northern California vesterdav, knocking a house off a hillside and cutting
power to thousands of homes. The Weather Service posted a gale warning in
the San Francisco Bav area and reported that more storms are on the way.
Power failed in about 4100 homes and businesses in San Jose and there
were smaller outages reported in Oakland. San Francisco, Pacifica and
Walnut Creek, according to Pacific Gas & Electric spokesman Dick Davin.
The storm is expected to leave one or two inches of rain in Northern Cali
fornia before clearing todav. But forecasters said a string of similar storms is
building off the coast and would probably sock Northern California at 30- to
40-hour intervals, starting tomorrow night.
Earlv this morning in Palo Alto, many streets were reported flooded, in
cluding the underpass at University Ave. and Alma St. At another, at Ore
gon Expressway and Alma St., cars were stalled under three feet of water.
Palo Alto police also responded to minor traffic accidents and to reports of
Hooded basements and parking garages.
Flooding was the major problem on the Stanford campus as well. Water
was nearly a foot deep at midnight at the corner near 558 Mayficld Dr., and
was nearly as deep at the corner of Mayfield and Alvarado Row. Residents
of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity reported that water was running "like
the Colorado River"; across campus, at Wilbur Hall, students sloshed
through water six inches deep to get their laundry out of a flooded basement.


A little under the weather

high winds combined with torrential rains. For

At Stanford, the rain began to subside at about 12:30 a.m..
Soon after, the floodwaters began to recede.
About 20 miles south of Big Sur, Highway 1 was closed when
mud oozed across the scenic coastal route. Highway Patrol dis
patcher Paul Douglas said the road would be closed for two days.
A 28-vear-old visitor from Pottstown, Pa. was washed off a
rock at Pescadero Point on the Monterey Peninsula as he posed
for a photo, said sheriffs Sgt. John Darling. A sheriffs heli
copter spotted the body but was unable to recover it. The identity
of the victim was withheld until family members could be
notified.
Heavy rain, hail and strong winds prompted the Highway Pa
trol to caution those driving small cars across the Oakland-San
Francisco Bay Bridge.
In the Sierra, 200 miles east of San Francisco, forecasters
warned of strong winds, heavy rain and more snow in the same
areas where an Alaskan weather front dumped two feet of snow
Saturday.
Motorists in the Sierra were told to carry chains or stay home.
Snow and mudslides from Saturday's storm posed a special haz
ard, authorities warned.
Soviet satellite plunges into ocean
Washington — An out-of-control, radioactive Soviet spy satel
lite plunged to fiery destruction in Earth's dense atmosphere
over the mid-Indian Ocean yesterday, the Pentagon announced.
Air Force Col. Robert O'Brien, a Pentagon spokesman, said
U.S. observers on the island of Diego Garcia reported seeing a
"40-second burn" in the sky at 2:15 p.m. PST, six minutes before
the satellite's main hulk rammed fully into the dense atmosphere.
The North American Aerospace Command confirmed that
the main body of the Soviet Cosmos 1402, estimated to weigh
about 8000 pounds, fell into the atmosphere at 2:21 p.m. PST.
At 6:10 p.m. the Federal Emergency Management Agency
called off its worldwide alert and informed emergency teams
standing by across the country to disband.
In a message to officials in all 50 states, FEM A said, "the pub
lic should be advised that protective action in connection with
Cosmos 1402 are no longer necessary and thus the alert is over."
Pentagon officials said the satellite's "impact area," was about
980 nautical miles (1127 statute miles) southeast of the British
owned island of Diego Garcia, where the United States main
tains a naval base.
NORAD placed the re-entry point at about 25 degress south
latitude by 84 degrees east longitude.
"We do not know at this time whether any portion of the satel
lite reached the earth's surface intact," the Pentagon statement
said.
OPEC agrees to firm price structure
Geneva, Switzerland — Oil ministers of the 13-member Or
ganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries tentatively agreed
yesterday to a new production ceiling and a strict national quota
system in order to uphold their present benchmark price of $34 a
barrel.
But the agreement hinges on acceptance by other OPEC na
tions of a Saudi Arabian demand for a firm price-differential
structure that would allow Saudi light oil to compete with closer
to-market African lights, Venezuelan Oil Minister Humberto
Calderon Berti said. He said that if there was no agreement on
differentials, the Gulf countries wanted the benchmark price to

come down.
Meeting in Geneva in emergency talks to restore discipline in
OPhC ranks in the face of lower priced non-OPEC competition,
sagging world demand and an oil glut, the ministers held two
lengthy sessions yesterday and will reconvene today in an effort
to thrash out the differential question.
"We all agree on three things," Iranian Oil Minister Moham
mad Gharazi said, "maintenance of the price, the ceiling and
quotas."
If there is formal agreement, the ceiling on OPEC production
will be set at 17.2 million barrels a day apportioned among the
producers by strict national quotas that will see Iran's share in
creased to 2.5 million barrels and Saudi Arabia's sharply cut
back to 4.5 million, according to Gharazi.
Congress to open tomorrow
Washington — The 98th Congress, hobbled from the start by
soaring deficits, deep recession, political divisions and a White
House struggling to regain its footing, opens for business tomor
row with optimism for a Social Security accord and pessimism
about nearly everything else.
The agenda ranges from defense, trade and foreign aid to jobs,
taxes, social-welfare spending, immigration and environmental
controls — mostly issues that dominated the 97th Congress, with
a few added starters such as campaign financing reform.
Nearly every issue is complicated by economic and budget
considerations: either the recession or the deficit, or both. But
the climate in which they are being considered this year is a far
cry from what it was when President Reagan came to town two
years ago.
Gone is the headv optimism with which Republicans took
control of the Senate and effective command of the House in
1981 and set about carrying out the Reagan revolution, with big
tax and domestic spending cuts coupled with a huge military
buildup, over sputtering objections from down-and-out Demo
crats.
In its place, after wrenching economic and political changes,
including Democratic recapture of actual control in the House, is
what Senate Finance Committee Chairman Robert Dole (R-
Kan.) calls "a good deal of realism" about "very limited op
tions" for steering the country toward a long-delayed recovery.
American, Israeli confront in close call
Washington — A U.S. Marine Corps rifleman had an Israeli
soldier in his sights and had to be ordered not to fire in the closest
call vet in the recent series of U.S.-Israeli military confrontations
in Lebanon, Pentagon sources said yesterday.
The incident is believed to have occurred near the Beirut air
port Friday, the same day Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger
taped the Cable News Network's "Newsmaker-Saturday" pro
gram in which he said: "I am very worried about these incidents,
and they are continuing."
The Marine rifleman, according to Pentagon officials, com
plained to his superiors that he had been trained to fire in self
defense, if necessary. These are the ground rules for U.S. troops
in the multinational peace-keeping force in Lebanon, according
to public statements of U.S. officials.
But the incident, although not yet known in detail, dramatized
the murkiness of the rules of engagement in Lebanon and under
scored worries expressed publicly by Weinberger and privately
by military professionals.
The Pentagon announced Thursday that two confrontations
had occurred within a day between Marines and Israeli forces at

Regan claims economy to recover
Washington — Treasury Secretary Donald Regan predicted
yesterday the economy will have a "decent recovery" in 1983 and
key commercial lending rates will fall below double digits.
At the same time, Regan stressed that recent economic fore
casts have been far off the mark.
The secretary, interviewed on CBS-TV's "Face the Nation,"
said, "1 think interest rates can and will come down in (1983)."
He said that as the economy picks up in 1984, "It's possible in
terest rates may stay at a higher level than normal.
"I do think that we'll probably see another couple of points at
least on (off) the prime," Regan added.
The prime rate, now at 11 to 11.5 percent, is the key com
mercial lending rate that banks charge their most credit-worthy
customers. Although consumer loans usually run several points
higher, the prime sets the floor for other rates.
On the economy, Regan said, "I think we're going to have a
decent recovery, slow at first, but certainly getting very stimu
lative toward the third and fourth quarters of 1983."
He said economic growth would be up 3.2 percent in the fourth
quarter of the year compared with the same period in 1982.
