Storm socks Bay Area; more on the way
San Francisco â€” Gusts up to 68 mph blew a violent Pacific storm into
Northern California vesterdav, knocking a house off a hillside and cutting
power to thousands of homes. The Weather Service posted a gale warning in
the San Francisco Bav area and reported that more storms are on the way.
Power failed in about 4100 homes and businesses in San Jose and there
were smaller outages reported in Oakland. San Francisco, Pacifica and
Walnut Creek, according to Pacific Gas & Electric spokesman Dick Davin.
The storm is expected to leave one or two inches of rain in Northern Cali
fornia before clearing todav. But forecasters said a string of similar storms is
building off the coast and would probably sock Northern California at 30- to
40-hour intervals, starting tomorrow night.
Earlv this morning in Palo Alto, many streets were reported flooded, in
cluding the underpass at University Ave. and Alma St. At another, at Ore
gon Expressway and Alma St., cars were stalled under three feet of water.
Palo Alto police also responded to minor traffic accidents and to reports of
Hooded basements and parking garages.
Flooding was the major problem on the Stanford campus as well. Water
was nearly a foot deep at midnight at the corner near 558 Mayficld Dr., and
was nearly as deep at the corner of Mayfield and Alvarado Row. Residents
of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity reported that water was running "like
the Colorado River"; across campus, at Wilbur Hall, students sloshed
through water six inches deep to get their laundry out of a flooded basement.
