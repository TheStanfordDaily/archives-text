## McCloskey awaits ASSU vote 
### SID ATKINS Staff writer 
Former U.S. Rep. Paul "Pete"
McGoskey (R-Menlo Park) will likely
become a guest professor here spring
quarter if the ASSU Senate gives its
approval at a meeting tomorrow night.
Junior Jon Adelstein will speak
against the selection at tomorrow's
meeting, however, on behalf of a group
of about 10 students who don't want
McCloskey to teach here.
According to Adelstein, the group
belie\es the Bureau could get someone
better for the money, and that there is a
danger McCloskey could use the class
room as a vehicle to espouse personal
views outside of his proposed academic
subject — congressional decision
making.
The political science department has
approved McCloskey's proposed
course on "Congressional Decisionm
kaing The ASSU will vote tomorrow
night on whether to approve the
course's proposed budget and tentative
syllabus.
"It the ASSU approves the budget
and the tentative syllabus, then the ball
is in his (McCloskey's) court," said
Seth Unfield, the director of the Guest
Professorship Bureau. McCloskey
would then have to accept the pro
posed salary terms.
McCloskey is a controversial figure
on campus, partially because of state
ments he has made concerning the
Mideast.
"He has made several inflammatory
statements about ethnic groups — par
ticularly the Jewish and Israeli lobbies
in Washington — in the past, and we're
concerned that this might happen in
class, given his strong views," Adels
tein said.
Specifically, Adelstein objects to
McCloskey's including such topics on
the tentative syllabus as the Yom Kip
pur War of 1973 and a discussion of
OPEC.
"What does the Yom Kippur war
have to do with congressional
decision-making? Nixon and Kissinger
were the important actors on that
scene," he said.

Adelstein said his group hopes to
persuade at least seven senators to vote
against McCloskey's course, the
number necessary to prevent a two
thirds majority in the 20-member sen
ate.
Linfield admitted that the critics of
McCloskey have a legitimate right to
complain about some of McCloskey's
statements.
"Rep. McCloskey has made remarks
about the Mideast political situation
which in my opinion show a lack of
understanding and some ignorance of
geo-political reality, but just because
he has views that are not the most
popular does not mean he shouldn't
teach here," Linfield said.
Linfield called McCloskey "a walk
ing store of applied political science
material," and said that most of his
biases have been accounted for in the
syllabus.
Work to secure McCloskey as a guest
professor began last year when he cor
responded with University President
Donald Kennedy, indicating that he
would be interested in teaching a
course here. Kennedy forwarded the
information to the Guest Professorship
Bureau, which began its efforts this
summer.
According to the tentative syllabus,
McCloskey will lecture on such topics
as the relationship between the execu
tive and legislative branches of U.S.
government with regard to the Viet
nam war, the advent of civil rights legis
lation, and special interest lobbying in
Congress. The syllabus is still subject to
review by the Bureau and the ASSU.
David Marks, the member of the
Bureau primarily responsible for re
cruiting McCloskey, said, "He's very
excited about teaching here. He's been
very helpful throughout the whole pro
cess."
McCloskey said yesterday,"I enjoy
teaching very much. I look forward
very much to improving students' un
derstanding of what really goes on in
Congress — of the actual blood, sweat
and sawdust of the arena."
Political Science Prof. Hubert Mar
shall said that while McCloskey won't

be able to offer the theoretical back
ground that some Stanford professors
have, "he will be able to provide a
first-hand, very lively and incisive
analysis of how Congress operates."
McCloskey's salary has not been de
termined, but Linfield said that the
proposed budget for the entire course
including TA fees should be around
$4000. Two years ago, John Anderson
earned $10,000.
McCloskey served in the House of
Representatives for 15 years before
running unsuccessfully for the Senate
this year. He received both his under
graduate and law degrees from Stan
ford.
He taught at the Stanford and Santa
Clara Law schools for four years be
tween 1964-68.
The course, if approved, will be a
large lecture course meeting twice a
week, and open to all students.
McCloskey recommended his course to
any student who might want to run for
Congress and anyone else who might
be interested.
"I guarantee that you'll enjoy the
classroom aspects of class. I plan to use
the law school method of teaching
using approximately half class partici
pation," he said, adding, "I plan to be
tough on students who haven't done
their reading."

in Washington — in the past, and we're
concerned that this might happen in
class, given his strong views," Adels
tein said.
Specifically, Adelstein objects to
McCloskey's including such topics on
the tentative syllabus as the Yom Kip
pur War of 1973 and a discussion of
OPEC.
"What does the Yom Kippur war
have to do with congressional
decision-making? Nixon and Kissinger
were the important actors on that
scene," he said.

Adelstein said his group hopes to
persuade at least seven senators to vote
against McCloskey's course, the
number necessary to prevent a two
thirds majority in the 20-member sen
ate.
Linfield admitted that the critics of
McCloskey have a legitimate right to
complain about some of McCloskey's
statements.
"Rep. McCloskey has made remarks
about the Mideast political situation
which in my opinion show a lack of
understanding and some ignorance of
geo-political reality, but just because
he has views that are not the most
popular does not mean he shouldn't
teach here," Linfield said.
Linfield called McCloskey "a walk
ing store of applied political science
material," and said that most of his
biases have been accounted for in the
syllabus.
Work to secure McCloskey as a guest
professor began last year when he cor
responded with University President
Donald Kennedy, indicating that he
would be interested in teaching a
course here. Kennedy forwarded the
information to the Guest Professorship
Bureau, which began its efforts this
summer.
According to the tentative syllabus,
McCloskey will lecture on such topics
as the relationship between the execu
tive and legislative branches of U.S.
government with regard to the Viet
nam war, the advent of civil rights legis
lation, and special interest lobbying in
Congress. The syllabus is still subject to
review by the Bureau and the ASSU.
David Marks, the member of the
Bureau primarily responsible for re
cruiting McCloskey, said, "He's very
excited about teaching here. He's been
very helpful throughout the whole pro
cess."
McCloskey said yesterday,"I enjoy
teaching very much. I look forward
very much to improving students' un
derstanding of what really goes on in
Congress — of the actual blood, sweat
and sawdust of the arena."
Political Science Prof. Hubert Mar
shall said that while McCloskey won't

be able to offer the theoretical back
ground that some Stanford professors
have, "he will be able to provide a
first-hand, very lively and incisive
analysis of how Congress operates."
McCloskey's salary has not been de
termined, but Linfield said that the
proposed budget for the entire course
including TA fees should be around
$4000. Two years ago, John Anderson
earned $10,000.
McCloskey served in the House of
Representatives for 15 years before
running unsuccessfully for the Senate
this year. He received both his under
graduate and law degrees from Stan
ford.
He taught at the Stanford and Santa
Clara Law schools for four years be
tween 1964-68.
The course, if approved, will be a
large lecture course meeting twice a
week, and open to all students.
McCloskey recommended his course to
any student who might want to run for
Congress and anyone else who might
be interested.
"I guarantee that you'll enjoy the
classroom aspects of class. I plan to use
the law school method of teaching
using approximately half class partici
pation," he said, adding, "I plan to be
tough on students who haven't done
their reading."


Pete McCloskey
Former U.S. Rep. Paul "Pete"
McGoskey (R-Menlo Park) will likely
become a guest professor here spring
quarter if the ASSU Senate gives its
approval at a meeting tomorrow night.
Junior Jon Adelstein will speak
against the selection at tomorrow's
meeting, however, on behalf of a group
of about 10 students who don't want
McCloskey to teach here.
According to Adelstein, the group
belie\es the Bureau could get someone
better for the money, and that there is a
danger McCloskey could use the class
room as a vehicle to espouse personal
views outside of his proposed academic
subject — congressional decision
making.
The political science department has
approved McCloskey's proposed
course on "Congressional Decisionm
kaing The ASSU will vote tomorrow
night on whether to approve the
course's proposed budget and tentative
syllabus.
"It the ASSU approves the budget
and the tentative syllabus, then the ball
is in his (McCloskey's) court," said
Seth Unfield, the director of the Guest
Professorship Bureau. McCloskey
would then have to accept the pro
posed salary terms.
McCloskey is a controversial figure
on campus, partially because of state
ments he has made concerning the
Mideast.
"He has made several inflammatory
statements about ethnic groups — par
ticularly the Jewish and Israeli lobbies
in Washington — in the past, and we're
concerned that this might happen in
class, given his strong views," Adels
tein said.
Specifically, Adelstein objects to
