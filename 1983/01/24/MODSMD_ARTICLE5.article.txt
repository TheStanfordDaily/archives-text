# False alarms cause sparks in new dorms
## 
### TIM GRIEVE 
Popcorn poppers, dust, water surges, cigarettes
and burnt toast have been setting off the fire alarms
at Governor's Corner this week.
The fire alarms at the new residences went off at
least three times this weekend, and residents esti
mate that the alarms have been going off about
twice a day since the beginning of the quarter.
"I don't have an exact count, but the alarms do
seem to be going off too often," said Jan Van
Houten. Governor's Corner director.
The fire department has told Van Houten that
there is nothing wrong with the alarms themselves,
and students will have to get used to them.
"One time when the alarm went off a young
woman was smoking in her loft, right under a smoke
detector, and it went off. That's an enclosed space
and the alarm is going to go off," Van Houten
explained. "
The alarm in Independent House II went off yes
terday morning when students used a toaster to

make their Sunday brunch. Residents also report
that the alarms have gone off because of popcorn
poppers and fireplace fires.
However, Van Houten said that residents have
not been responsible for all the false alarms. Dust
from landscaping going on outside has caused
alarms to go off when smoke detectors mistakenly
identified the dust as smoke. Van Houten said an
alarm also went off earlier this quarter because of "a
surge of water. I'm not technical enough to under
stand why that happened, but that's what they told
me."
Van Houten doesn't know when, if ever, anything
will be done about the alarms.
"Everytime I've talked to the fire department
they've told me that there's nothing to fix. They say
the smoke detectors aren't too sensitive, that it's
just a matter of the students getting used to it.
Maybe when the fire department gets tired of com
ing out here they'll do something about it."
Until then, many Governor's Corner residents

are ignoring the alarms when they go off.
When an alarm went off in Murray House yester
day morning, senior Lisa Bell ran downstairs, al
though she said she "knew it was a false alarm.
There was nobody out there, which is really bad. It's
like crying wolf."
When the alarms go off in the morning, many
residents stay in bed.
"If you're in bed you hope it's not a fire and sleep
through it. If no one comes in and yells 'fire!' then
you assume you're safe," explained one resident.
"If you're already up, then you go to the eating
clubs and wait for the fire trucks to come and the
alarms to go off. You can't hear them over there."
Mary Haber, an RA in Anderson House, is con
cerned about the safety of the residents when they
ignore the alarms. "Everyone just stays in the suites
when the alarm goes off. If we had a fire, it would be
a real problem.
