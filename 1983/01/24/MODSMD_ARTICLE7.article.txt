# Mideast: talks and progress, but in delicate balance
## Israel, Lebanon agree on agenda 
### 
Compiled from news reports and wire ser
vices
Peace talks between Israeli
and Lebanese negotiators
moved ahead slowly last week as
the delegations agreed to little
more than the creation of at least
three subcommittees to discuss
key issues stemming form Is
rael's invasion of Lebanon.
Although negotiators clashed
over an Israeli demand to oper
ate electronic spy stations on
Lebanese soil, the two parties
did agree to form four commit
tees, including one to draw up a
timetable for evacuating foreign
armies from Lebanon.
Israel wants Israelis to man the
bases to make sure Palestinian
guerrillas and Syrian forces stay
out of Lebanon once they with
draw. Lebanon believes
Lebanese should operate the sta
tions, but agreed to a U.S. com
promise of Americans manning
the bases provided Israel goes
along with the plan.
Meeting for only two hours at
the Israeli border town of Kiryat
Shemona, negotiators charged
three separate panels with the
task of security arrangements
and the withdrawal of foreign
forces from Lebanon as well as
addressing the issues of future
Israeli-Lebanese relations, such
as trade and tourism. Another
committee was established ear
lier to formulate a declaration
ending the 34-year-old formal
state of war between Lebanon
and Israel.
Meanwhile, U.S. special
envoy Philip Habib shuttled be
tween Jerusalem and Beirut
working to speed up the pace of
the talks. But Habib's meeting
with Israeli leaders had no im
pact, according to Israeli televi
sion. Foreign minister Yitzhak
Shamir announced that Israel
would reject a U.S. proposal to
station Americans instead of Is

raelis at warning stations in east
ern Lebanon on the Syrian bor
der. The plan is favored by Be
irut officials.
Beirut press reports indicated
that Lebanon would reject the
setting up of Israeli-manned
monitoring stations in southern
Lebanon insisting that only the
evacuation of all Israeli troops,
along with the Syrian and Pales
tinian forces, would restore its
sovereignty.
Conference sources in Kiryat
Shemona said one of the sub
committees was assigned the
task of drawing up a timetable
and maps for a withdrawal of the
foreign troops, which number
60,000. They said the Israeli de
legation reiterated its position
that PLO guerrillas believed to
number 6000 to 8000 must leave
first, followed by a simultaneous
and phased pullout of the Israeli
and Syrian armies. Syria has
about 30,000 troops in Lebanon
and Israel an estimated 25,000.
While peace attempts drag on,
U.S. State Department officials
express increasing concern about
the risk of confrontations and ac
cidents as long as American
forces are kept out of Lebanon.
Defense Secretary Caspar
Weinberger has said he wants
the Marines out as soon as possi
ble and General David Jones,
former chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, publicly opposed
sending American troops in
Lebanon as a peace-keeping
force last year.
However, U.S. policy-makers
believe a continued U.S. military
presence is vital to the new
Lebonese government and to
Lebanon, to get Israeli, Syrian
and Palestinian forces out of that
country. Administration officials
hope for a breakthrough soon in
negotiations for withdrawing
foreign troops.
