# Gemayel probe yields assassin mastermind

The investigation into the assassination of Lebanese president
elect Bashir Gamayel last September has led Phalange Party officials
to conclude that Syrian intelligence almost certainly was behind the
killing. But the results of the inquiry have not been published and
may never be â€” largely because the key suspect escaped but, appa
rently, for political reasons as well.
The Phalange Party has never publicly accused Syria of involve
ment in the assassination. Its officials say that this is because they did
not succeed in capturing Nabil Alam, the man manipulating the
detained suspected assassin, Habib Shartouni.
Alam, according to these officials, was one of four leaders of the
Lebanese National Syrian Social Party, who resigned Oct. 5, three
days after the capture of Shartouni was made public.
Phalange officials also indicated to several Western embassies and
reporters that nothing has been said about the Syrian role because it
could complicate the Lebanese government's efforts to gain Syrian
cooperation for the withdrawal of its troops from Lebanon together
with those of Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization.
Alam managed to flee Lebanon before he could be seized and is
now thought by Phalange officials to be living in Syria. He reportedly
was identified as the mastermind behind the plot by Shartouni, whom
the Phalange captured a few days after Gemayel's assassination Sept.
14, trying to make his way across the mountains northeast of Beirut
to Syrian lines.
