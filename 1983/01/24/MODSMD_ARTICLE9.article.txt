# Syrian stand opposes talks
## 
### 
Compiled from news reports and wire services
As negotiations between Israel and Lebanon
proceed laboriously, there is a certain anxiety on
the part of Lebanon to tread carefully and avoid
any steps toward a diplomatic recognition of the
Israel which would anger Muslim-Christian rela
tions within and upset neighboring Arab states.
The government of Lebanese President Amin
Gemayel needs cooperation from Saudi Arabia to
help repair the tremendous damage caused by the
war, as well as from Syria in withdrawing its forces
from the area. So far, both countries have expres
sed their disapproval of an Israeli-Lebanese ag
reement dealing with any issue than the pullout of
foreign troops.
As Israel and Lebanon agree at last on what they
will talk about, the initial Arab reaction was pre
dictably in opposition to both the negotiations and
President Reagan's Sept. 1 peace initiative calling
for a future relationship between Jordan and the
Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
While attending a meeting of nonaligned nations
in Nicaragua, Abdel Halim Khaddam, Syrian vice
premier and foreign minister, said that his govern
ment would oppose any Israeli peace terms im
posed on Lebanon.
The hardening of the Syrian position results
from Syria's alienation from the present Mideast
peace efforts and its conflicts with Arab neighbors
and Israel. Syria's stand may be seen as an attempt
to reassert and regain credibility after a year of

traumatic events such as the Lebanon war.
Another factor in the Syrian view is the Soviet
Union, which is Syria's principal arms supplier.
Syrian President Hafiz Assad recently made two
unpublicized visits to the Soviet Union, during
which he reaffirmed a long-term friendship treaty
signed with Moscow two years ago, and concluded
new arms contracts.
As a result, the Syrian air force has reportedly
been rebuilt from its military losses during the
Lebanon war last summer, and Syria has the com
mittment of Moscow to the defense of Syria and its
forces stationed in Lebanon.
Not denying Israeli claims that Syria has ob
tained Soviet SA-5 surface-to-air missiles, the Sy
rian media said that the newly-aquired weapons
are a defense against Israeli air attacks.
Still, the Socialist regime in Damascus is rela
tively cut off position and influence in the region,
retaining only the insubstantial tenuous support of
Libya and South Yemen.
In question, then, is the possible neutralization
of Syria in the Mideast, in the face of progressing
rapprochement among former Arab foes who seek
the formation of a moderate Arab camp which
would include Egypt, Jordon and Iraq — Syria's
three main adversaries.
Also, the current talks between Israel and Leba
non on the withdrawal of foreign forces from
Lebanon carry implications of Syrian isolation,
should an agreement be reached.
