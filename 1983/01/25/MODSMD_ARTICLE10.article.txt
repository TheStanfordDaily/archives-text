# Affirmative action entails active recruitment

'Stanford is going to have to go out
there and identify the people,
instead of sitting back, forming a
search committee and getting 700
applications, only two of which are
black.'

'W
w W hen you are harried by day and haunted by
night by the fact that you are a Negro, living constantly at
tiptoe stance, never quite knowing what to expect next
and plagued with inner fears and outer resentments,
when you are forever fighting a degenerating sense of
'nobodyness' — then you will understand why we find it
difficult to wait."

Martin Luther King's letter, written from a Birming
ham jail almost 20 years ago, reflects the spirit of the
time. Much remained to be done in the struggle for
minority rights.
King's death on April 4,1968, increased this sense of
urgency that efforts must be made to help correct past
discrimination.
On that day, the Black Student Union (BSU) here
presented 10 demands to the University, including one
calling for the "active recruitment of minority group
faculty" (or affirmative action).
"The Black- Student Union will no longer tolerate
inequality and demands that Stanford University revise
its operational policies," they said.
Federal laws enacted in 1972 now require the Univer
sity to actively recruit minority faculty and staff in order
to be eligible for federal funds.
"Affirmative action is an effort to correct past dis
crimination," Garnett Tatum, an assistant affirmative
action officer said.
The University's 1983 Affirmative Action Plan states,
"The mere avoidance of direct discrimination, even
where that can be fully achieved, does not by itself
guarantee the desired changes in the composition of the

faculty of staff. Positive recruiting is, therefore, basic."
This plan currently consists of "imaginative and seri
ous search and recruiting, administrative review of hir
ing practices and analysis of faculty and staff units to
determine problem areas."
But 15 years after King's death, statistics reveal slow
growth in the number of minority faculty and staff and
great under-representation of minorities in some areas.
According to University statistics:
• The percentage of minority faculty has increased from
4.1 percent in 1972 to 6.75 percent in 1982.
• The percentage of minority salaried staff has grown
from 11.3 percent in 1974 to 15.9 percent in 1982.
• The percentage of black tenured faculty has actually
declined from 2 percent in 1973 to 1.82 percent in 1982.
• There are no native Americans on the faculty.
• The School of Earth Sciences, the School of Education
and the School of Medicine have no black faculty mem
bers.
• The School of Earth Sciences has no Hispanic faculty
members, and the Graduate School of Business and the
School of Education have only two Hispanic faculty
members each.

• The School of Education and the School of Law have
no Asian faculty members.
• There are no minorities in upper-level, policy-making
administrative positions.
Statistics on minority faculty and staff are not even
available before 1972.
According to Santiago Rodriguez, head of the Affir
mative Action Office which has an annual budget of
$200,000, "If you look in terms of absolute growth, yes,
we are growing, though it is a very discouragingly slow
growth."
Administration officials said a variety of reasons may
be responsible for the slow growth in minority faculty.
According to Gerald Lieberman, vice provost and
dean of graduate studies, the pool of competent minority
graduate students is insufficient.
"I am particularly discouraged because in order for us
to be hiring minority faculty, you need to have a pipeline
of graduate students and there does not appear to be a
large pipeline, especially in the sciences ... It's not a
Stanford problem, it's a national problem," he said.
Others claim that a strong enough effort has not been
made to recruit those potential candidates.
"Stanford is going to have to go out there and identify
the people, instead of sitting back, forming a search
committee and getting 700 applications, only two of
which are black. We have to be a little broader in our
search " said Cecilia Burciaga, assistant provost for fac
ulty affirmative action.
"The upper administrators do not make the appoint
ments. The real selection is done within each department
and the three, four or five faculty who are conducting the
search.
"Faculty have their own set of old-boy networks.
They've got to get out and identify early the potential
graduate students. What I want to see is faculty calling
Joe and John and Dick at Harvard and MIT to identify
the minority graduate students," Burciaga said.
University administrators also encourage search
committees to advertise widely for available positions
and to change job descriptions that may be discriminat
ory or may otherwise discourage potential minority can
didates.
According to some observers, however, many minor
ity faculty, especially blacks, also have greater time
commitments than non-minorities. They are often asked
to serve on committees, act as advisers and act as repre
sentatives for their ethnic community.
These extra time-commitments may account for the
failure of many black faculty members to get tenure in
the mid-19705, after the University had hired a record
number, according to Anthropology Prof. James Gibbs,
a former dean of undergraduate studies and the only

senior black administrator in University history.
"Sometimes people don't make tenure because they
don't have enough time to spend on their scholarship
and research," he said.
Lieberman agreed that the seven-year tenure time
deadline is a problem. The University has allocated
$50,000 this year for the Affirmative Action Fund which
is designed to help keep minority faculty here by paying
them for time-on-leave or by creating new positions, he
said.
"I certainly believe that the calls on the minority fac
ulty by the community are such that they have to spend
more time in their outside duties than others.
"It may be that the system which says that you've got
to produce in a set period works against these people,"
Lieberman said.
The fund was designed "to give these faculty every
opportunity to show that they can make it,"he said.
Anthropology Prof. Sylvia Yanagisako said affirma
tive action is less important for Asians than for other
minorities because they already have a strong represen
tation here. But improvements in the distribution of

Asians is needed, she said.
"Asian Americans do fit into the category of affirma
tive action when it's useful for the University," she said.
"I don't think there is a strong policy to recruit them.
And I agree with the University's policy. I think that
more priority should be given to blacks and Hispanics."
Because a wide variety of Eastern races including
Indians and Filipino's are lumped together in one
"Asian" category, some of these groups are overlooked
in affirmative action, Yanagisako said.
Distribution among academic schools remains a prob
lem for blacks and Hispanics as well as for Asians.
Most Asian faculty are concentrated in engineering,
medicine and the East-Asian program, while blacks and
Hispanics are concentrated in the arts and sciences.
Most of the professional schools here show a tremen
dous lack of minority representation.
"Underutilization is striking in the Medical School
and the School of Education," according to Iris Brest,
University attorney.
Minorities in the Graduate School of Business and the

School of Earth Scicnces are also underutilized when
compared with the available pool of potential candi
dates, according to the 1983 affirmative action report.
I he staff side of the University has also shown ex
tremely slow growth in minority representation. Most
observers agree that upper-level management is the area
most lacking in minority representation.
"This University is basically governed by white
males," Rodriguez said.
"We have a major problem with minority representa
tion at the mid- and senior management and policy
making levels," he said. "Blacks and Hispanics are
mainly located in the lower, non-exempt levels."
According to Linda Haines, employment manager.
University President Donald Kennedy has made a more
conscious effort this year to recruit minorities to high
level positions.
Kennedy specifically requested that the search team
looking for a new Vice President of the Office of Devel
opment "undertake special efforts to identify
minorities," Haines said.
Some highly technical positions such as computer
analysts and research associates also display a serious
lack of minority representation, according to Rodriguez.
In addition to more actively recruiting minorities.
Asst. Provost Keith Smith said the University must also
make a stronger effort to "grow (its) own," promoting
minority administrators within the University or training
them for higher positions.
Administrators claim affirmative action should be
come a "natural process" throughout the University, but
that differing perceptions by faculty and staff provide
obstacles to the program.
One of the most important areas of improvement is
"making the goals and objectives commonly understood
to everyone," according to Smith.
Lieberman said that he is "concerned because I don't
think there is a uniform understanding among faculty
about what is affirmative action and where it really plays
a role."
"Almost everybody believes in affirmative action.
The trouble is that everybody interprets it somewhat

differently," Lieberman said.
The presence of minority faculty is important in order
to provide role models for students who may be consid
ering an academic career themselves.
"When you have managed to get a diverse student
population and a staff population and you bring in a
non-diverse faculty, then you're begging the commit
ment question.
"If we give them the view that you can always be a
gardener or a maintenance person or maybe even an
assistant provost, but that's as far as you can go, then
you're not going to have role models for the minority
students to become scholars," Burciaga said.
The rhetoric of the Reagan administration concerning
minority programs may also be affecting people's per
ceptions of affirmative action, according to Rodriguez.
But the administration has not lessened its enforcement
of affirmative action policies, he said.
"In terms of enforcement, we're seeing just as strong
an effort as before. They may say things about affirma
tive action, but in terms of practice, nothing much has
changed," Rodriguez said.
"Where I think there has been a problem is that this
administration is sending signals to people that it is not
interested in affirmative action, and that things are not as
important as before.
"And in getting these signals, we may be letting the
critters out of the hole. This has all had a chilling effect
on people here at the University," he added.
According to Burciaga, "People are feeling a little

freer to say whatever they please."
She also said that recent court decisions, including the
Supreme Court's Bakke decision, which outlawed strict
quotas but allowed race to be taken into account in
admissions decisions, have also had a "chilling effect" on
minority enrollment at universities.
"It's not a very welcome feeling to walk on campus
and have your classmates say,' Hey, I know why you got
in,' " she said.
Most administrators agree that Kennedy and other
top administrators should continue to voice their com
mitment to diversity and affirmative action.
"Just having people at higher levels reminding each
other that affirmative action is an important part of the
hiring process is essential," Haines said.
The University has now had 15 years to work toward
meeting the BSU's demand presented after King's death
that the University's actively recruit minority faculty and
staff.
But the ultimate goal of affirmative action has always
been to make the hiring of minority faculty and staff a
"natural" thing, according to Rodriguez, so that affirma
tive action itself will no longer be necessary.
"It just takes time for people to institutionalize
things," Haines said. "I think we're chipping away at it.
But there have not been any great leaps. We're making
slow progress. And it's always frustrating not to make
better and faster progress.
"We still have a whole lot of work to do," Haines said.
