# Affirmative action entails active recruitment

'Stanford is going to have to go out
there and identify the people,
instead of sitting back, forming a
search committee and getting 700
applications, only two of which are
black.'

'W
w W hen you are harried by day and haunted by
night by the fact that you are a Negro, living constantly at
tiptoe stance, never quite knowing what to expect next
and plagued with inner fears and outer resentments,
when you are forever fighting a degenerating sense of
'nobodyness' — then you will understand why we find it
difficult to wait."

Martin Luther King's letter, written from a Birming
ham jail almost 20 years ago, reflects the spirit of the
time. Much remained to be done in the struggle for
minority rights.
King's death on April 4,1968, increased this sense of
urgency that efforts must be made to help correct past
discrimination.
On that day, the Black Student Union (BSU) here
presented 10 demands to the University, including one
calling for the "active recruitment of minority group
faculty" (or affirmative action).
"The Black- Student Union will no longer tolerate
inequality and demands that Stanford University revise
its operational policies," they said.
Federal laws enacted in 1972 now require the Univer
sity to actively recruit minority faculty and staff in order
to be eligible for federal funds.
"Affirmative action is an effort to correct past dis
crimination," Garnett Tatum, an assistant affirmative
action officer said.
The University's 1983 Affirmative Action Plan states,
"The mere avoidance of direct discrimination, even
where that can be fully achieved, does not by itself
guarantee the desired changes in the composition of the

faculty of staff. Positive recruiting is, therefore, basic."
This plan currently consists of "imaginative and seri
ous search and recruiting, administrative review of hir
ing practices and analysis of faculty and staff units to
determine problem areas."
But 15 years after King's death, statistics reveal slow
growth in the number of minority faculty and staff and
great under-representation of minorities in some areas.
According to University statistics:
• The percentage of minority faculty has increased from
4.1 percent in 1972 to 6.75 percent in 1982.
• The percentage of minority salaried staff has grown
from 11.3 percent in 1974 to 15.9 percent in 1982.
• The percentage of black tenured faculty has actually
declined from 2 percent in 1973 to 1.82 percent in 1982.
• There are no native Americans on the faculty.
• The School of Earth Sciences, the School of Education
and the School of Medicine have no black faculty mem
bers.
• The School of Earth Sciences has no Hispanic faculty
members, and the Graduate School of Business and the
School of Education have only two Hispanic faculty
members each.
