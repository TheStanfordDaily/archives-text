'Asian-Americans apply and get in.
The University uses us when they
need to show admissions (data),
but I'm the only Asian American
administrator on campus and I'm a
student. All we have is office space,
no cultural center.'

T
JBL hey are small communities within this commu
nity, cultural havens where students can speak the lan
guage, eat the foods and mark the festivals of their ethnic
groups.
The members of the Asian-American, black, Chicano
and native American communities here share many con
cerns and problems. But each of the ethnic families is
unique.
• Because the University does not recognize Asian-
Americans as a minority, the group is denied support
some student leaders feel is crucial. The only University
administrator helping Asian-American student groups is
a part-time student intern. Instead of a cultural center,
the Asian American Students Organization works out of
an office in the Old Firehouse.
• The black community fields the most student groups
— and also the widest variety of activities. Black stu
dents publish a yearbook, Imani, sing in a gospel choir,
and have activated chapters of national black sororities
and fraternities. One fraternity has been granted Uni
versity recognition.
» University Chicano organizations place special em
phasis on community service. Two separate programs
reach out to Spanish-speaking schoolchildren while
Chicano pre-professional societies find staging health
fairs and providing role models equally as important as
offering members academic support.
• The American Indian Association follows the tribal
government method of organization — a council of
members, similar to the councils that run the affairs of

many tribes, makes decisions for the group and plans for
the annual spring Pow-Wow. Being Stanford's smallest
minority group creates special problems for native
Americans; when a large number of student leaders
graduates, there may not be enough new students to
assume responsibility for the group.
Students here can join more than 31) different social,

political, religious, academic and cultural ethnic organi
zations. Some, like the local chapter of the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored Peoples,
belong to national groups; others, like the Asian Ameri
can Theatre Project, are homegrown — conceived and
organized by past and present students here.

The Latino Business Society, founded four years ago, is designed to expose Hispanic students to the
opportunities in the corporate world through workshops on resume-writing, interviewing and public
speaking.
Many student leaders told the Daily they enjoy having
all kinds of friends, but feel more at home within ethnic
organizations. "I feel accepted in the Asian-American
community," said Naomi Hirahara, who directs the
Asian American Theatre Project. "1 feel I don't have to
explain myself or the way I act. In high school, I was
never right for a role. I was always too small, or Asian or
something."
Doris Wilson, president of the Black Pre-Law Society,
came to Stanford from Chicago, which she called "the
most segregated city in the country." She credits the
Black Student Union (BSU) with giving her the confi
dence she needed to join other student groups.
"I had never been around white people before," Wil
son said. "I was thrown in here. The BSU gave me the
support to join ASSU and University committees. If 1
had not had that kind of support, I wouldn't have made it
through Stanford. I'm strong-willed. I often wonder
about those who are not."
Ethnic organizations also help members learn more
about their own cultures. "Even though my parents are
Mexican I wasn't brought up with the political issues,"
said Marta Carrillo, a member of El Teatro Sin Ver
guenza. In that respect, joining the Chicano community
here was '„'a difficult transition, but it has helped me a
lot."
Junior Russell Jeung provides administrative support
to Asian-American student groups in his capacity as an
Office of Student Affairs intern. Currently, he is working
with the Asian American Students Organization on a
cultural fair planned for April.
Jeung called the University's failure to classify
Asian-American students as a minority "a major prob
lem."

"Asian-Americans apply and get in," he said. "The
University uses us when they need to show admissions
(data), but I'm the only Asian American administrator
on campus and I'm a student. All we have is office space,
no cultural center."
Hirahara agreed that the University could do "a lot
more" for Asian American students. "A lot of people
say Asian-Americans have really assimilated, but I don't
feel that's true. If it is true, that's even more reason to
have support systems," she said. "Some of the discrimi
nation is beneath the surface. We have no place to go."

s
of the newest additions to the array of black
organizations here are Greek — two sororities and three
fraternities, all activated within the last five years.
One fraternity. Kappa Alpha Psi, is recognized by the
University. The others, fraternities Omega Psi Phi and
Alpha Phi Alpha and sororities Alpha Kappa Alpha and
Delta Sigma Theta, have found that the rules the na
tional organization expects all local chapters to follow
conflict with University policy, which stresses local au
tonomy.
The four groups not recognized by the University
must hold meetings and activities off campus and cannot
call themselves "Stanford chapters."
Senior Cam Hawkins, former president of Alpha
Kappa Alpha, said the University gives some support to
unrecognized black fraternities and sororities, but all
would like official recognition. The recognition of
Kappa Alpha Psi this year is a positive sign and a goal for
other black groups, she said.
Deciding whether to join a black or predominantly
white sorority may depend on background, Hawkins
said, "the people you were raised around."
For junior Margaret-Ann Laing, Delta Sigma Theta
first vice-president, it was an easy decision. "A feeling of
sisterhood comes out more around black people. I'm
from Jamaica and it's a more comfortable group for me. I
didn't know about white sororities until I came here,"
Laing said.
Black sororities here "tend to be more vocal and
visible about their public service orientation," she ad
ded. "Most of the community service we do is helping

people in the black community. It's better for me in a
black sorority because that's where the emphasis is."
According to junior Steve Bowman, a member of
Omega Psi Phi, the main difference between black
fraternities and other fraternities here is that black
fraternities do not offer housing.
Bowman also stressed the service-oriented nature of
black fraternities. "One of its principles is uplifting the
black community," he said.
Chicano student leaders emphasize outreach. Senior
Gina Valdovinos, a member of Chicanos in Health Edu
cation, said she does not believe in the bootstrap theory
of advancement. "Most of us realize that we are here
because of our communities and their support. We feel a
desire and obligation to return our skills to our com
munities," she said.
"Most of our organizations are built around the fact
that we do not wish to assimilate. We want to combine
the two cultures," Valdovinos added.
Through the Barrio Assistance Program, Project Out
reach and other groups, students here try to provide
academic help and positive role models to Chicano
school children from kindergarten through high school,
"A major objective of a lot of groups is to encourage
more Hispanic students to stay in school and not just
come to a school like Stanford but to go to college
period," said Ruben Rodriguez, a member of the
Latino Business Society. "A lot of us know what it's like
to come from a community where education beyond
high school is not stressed."
The University's tiny native American community —
currently about 60 students — saw several student lead
ers graduate last year, and only seven native Americans
entered this fall, said Lori Cupp, a second-year medical
student.
So, while the American Indian Science and Engineer
ing Society remains active, pre-med and pre-law
societies are "not really needed this year," Cupp said.
Membership in the Native American Students Or
ganization is growing. But the group also wants to help
its members make good grades. "We are toning down
our events now in hopes that students will study more,"
Cupp said.
The administration's support for the native American
community seems "loose and disorganized" when com
pared with Cupp's undergraduate experience at
Dartmouth College. "We could have native American
faculty, a Native American Resource Center to bring in
people to do research .. . Students will have difficulty
wherever they go adapting to the new culture. The best
thing to help them is a strong cultural group," Cupp said.

The University's tiny native American community —
currently about 60 students — saw several student lead

entered this fall, said Lori Cupp, a second-year medical
student.
So, while the American Indian Science and Engineer

societies are "not really needed this year," Cupp said.
Membership in the Native American Students Or
ganization is growing. But the group also wants to help
its members make good grades. "We are toning down

Cupp said.
The administration's support for the native American
community seems "loose and disorganized" when com

Dartmouth College. "We could have native American
faculty, a Native American Resource Center to bring in
people to do research .. . Students will have difficulty
wherever they go adapting to the new culture. The best
thing to help them is a strong cultural group," Cupp said.

Many student leaders told the Daily they enjoy having
all kinds of friends, but feel more at home within ethnic
organizations. "I feel accepted in the Asian-American
community," said Naomi Hirahara, who directs the
Asian American Theatre Project. "1 feel I don't have to
explain myself or the way I act. In high school, I was
never right for a role. I was always too small, or Asian or

Doris Wilson, president of the Black Pre-Law Society,
came to Stanford from Chicago, which she called "the
most segregated city in the country." She credits the
Black Student Union (BSU) with giving her the confi
dence she needed to join other student groups.
"I had never been around white people before," Wil
son said. "I was thrown in here. The BSU gave me the
support to join ASSU and University committees. If 1
had not had that kind of support, I wouldn't have made it
through Stanford. I'm strong-willed. I often wonder
about those who are not."
Ethnic organizations also help members learn more
about their own cultures. "Even though my parents are
Mexican I wasn't brought up with the political issues,"
said Marta Carrillo, a member of El Teatro Sin Ver
guenza. In that respect, joining the Chicano community
here was '„'a difficult transition, but it has helped me a

Junior Russell Jeung provides administrative support
to Asian-American student groups in his capacity as an

s
of the newest additions to the array of black
organizations here are Greek — two sororities and three
fraternities, all activated within the last five years.
One fraternity. Kappa Alpha Psi, is recognized by the
University. The others, fraternities Omega Psi Phi and
Alpha Phi Alpha and sororities Alpha Kappa Alpha and
Delta Sigma Theta, have found that the rules the na
tional organization expects all local chapters to follow
conflict with University policy, which stresses local au
tonomy.
The four groups not recognized by the University
must hold meetings and activities off campus and cannot
call themselves "Stanford chapters."
Senior Cam Hawkins, former president of Alpha
Kappa Alpha, said the University gives some support to
unrecognized black fraternities and sororities, but all
would like official recognition. The recognition of
Kappa Alpha Psi this year is a positive sign and a goal for
other black groups, she said.
Deciding whether to join a black or predominantly
white sorority may depend on background, Hawkins
said, "the people you were raised around."
For junior Margaret-Ann Laing, Delta Sigma Theta
first vice-president, it was an easy decision. "A feeling of
sisterhood comes out more around black people. I'm
from Jamaica and it's a more comfortable group for me. I
didn't know about white sororities until I came here,"
Laing said.
Black sororities here "tend to be more vocal and
visible about their public service orientation," she ad
ded. "Most of the community service we do is helping

people in the black community. It's better for me in a
black sorority because that's where the emphasis is."
According to junior Steve Bowman, a member of
Omega Psi Phi, the main difference between black
fraternities and other fraternities here is that black
fraternities do not offer housing.
Bowman also stressed the service-oriented nature of
black fraternities. "One of its principles is uplifting the
black community," he said.
Chicano student leaders emphasize outreach. Senior
Gina Valdovinos, a member of Chicanos in Health Edu
cation, said she does not believe in the bootstrap theory
of advancement. "Most of us realize that we are here

desire and obligation to return our skills to our com
munities," she said.

that we do not wish to assimilate. We want to combine

Kappa Alpha, said the University gives some support to
unrecognized black fraternities and sororities, but all
would like official recognition. The recognition of
Kappa Alpha Psi this year is a positive sign and a goal for
other black groups, she said.
Deciding whether to join a black or predominantly
white sorority may depend on background, Hawkins
said, "the people you were raised around."
For junior Margaret-Ann Laing, Delta Sigma Theta
first vice-president, it was an easy decision. "A feeling of
sisterhood comes out more around black people. I'm
from Jamaica and it's a more comfortable group for me. I
didn't know about white sororities until I came here,"
Laing said.
Black sororities here "tend to be more vocal and
visible about their public service orientation," she ad
ded. "Most of the community service we do is helping

people in the black community. It's better for me in a
black sorority because that's where the emphasis is."
According to junior Steve Bowman, a member of
Omega Psi Phi, the main difference between black
fraternities and other fraternities here is that black
fraternities do not offer housing.
Bowman also stressed the service-oriented nature of
black fraternities. "One of its principles is uplifting the
black community," he said.
Chicano student leaders emphasize outreach. Senior
Gina Valdovinos, a member of Chicanos in Health Edu
cation, said she does not believe in the bootstrap theory
of advancement. "Most of us realize that we are here
because of our communities and their support. We feel a
desire and obligation to return our skills to our com
munities," she said.
"Most of our organizations are built around the fact
that we do not wish to assimilate. We want to combine
the two cultures," Valdovinos added.
Through the Barrio Assistance Program, Project Out
reach and other groups, students here try to provide
academic help and positive role models to Chicano
school children from kindergarten through high school,
"A major objective of a lot of groups is to encourage
more Hispanic students to stay in school and not just
come to a school like Stanford but to go to college
period," said Ruben Rodriguez, a member of the
Latino Business Society. "A lot of us know what it's like
to come from a community where education beyond
high school is not stressed."
The University's tiny native American community —
currently about 60 students — saw several student lead
ers graduate last year, and only seven native Americans
entered this fall, said Lori Cupp, a second-year medical
student.
So, while the American Indian Science and Engineer
ing Society remains active, pre-med and pre-law
societies are "not really needed this year," Cupp said.
Membership in the Native American Students Or
ganization is growing. But the group also wants to help
its members make good grades. "We are toning down
our events now in hopes that students will study more,"
Cupp said.
The administration's support for the native American
community seems "loose and disorganized" when com
pared with Cupp's undergraduate experience at
Dartmouth College. "We could have native American
faculty, a Native American Resource Center to bring in
people to do research .. . Students will have difficulty
wherever they go adapting to the new culture. The best
thing to help them is a strong cultural group," Cupp said.
