# Social groups boost cultural consciousness

'Asian-Americans apply and get in.
The University uses us when they
need to show admissions (data),
but I'm the only Asian American
administrator on campus and I'm a
student. All we have is office space,
no cultural center.'

T
JBL hey are small communities within this commu
nity, cultural havens where students can speak the lan
guage, eat the foods and mark the festivals of their ethnic
groups.
The members of the Asian-American, black, Chicano
and native American communities here share many con
cerns and problems. But each of the ethnic families is
unique.
• Because the University does not recognize Asian-
Americans as a minority, the group is denied support
some student leaders feel is crucial. The only University
administrator helping Asian-American student groups is
a part-time student intern. Instead of a cultural center,
the Asian American Students Organization works out of
an office in the Old Firehouse.
• The black community fields the most student groups
— and also the widest variety of activities. Black stu
dents publish a yearbook, Imani, sing in a gospel choir,
and have activated chapters of national black sororities
and fraternities. One fraternity has been granted Uni
versity recognition.
» University Chicano organizations place special em
phasis on community service. Two separate programs
reach out to Spanish-speaking schoolchildren while
Chicano pre-professional societies find staging health
fairs and providing role models equally as important as
offering members academic support.
• The American Indian Association follows the tribal
government method of organization — a council of
members, similar to the councils that run the affairs of

many tribes, makes decisions for the group and plans for
the annual spring Pow-Wow. Being Stanford's smallest
minority group creates special problems for native
Americans; when a large number of student leaders
graduates, there may not be enough new students to
assume responsibility for the group.
Students here can join more than 31) different social,

political, religious, academic and cultural ethnic organi
zations. Some, like the local chapter of the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored Peoples,
belong to national groups; others, like the Asian Ameri
can Theatre Project, are homegrown — conceived and
organized by past and present students here.
