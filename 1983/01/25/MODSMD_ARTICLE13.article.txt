# Stanford stacks up favorablyâ€”but not best

There were clearly qualified
minority students around 10 years
ago. But many of the predominantly
white schools preferred not to invest
in bringing in minority students.'

s
tanford may not be as ethnically diverse as the
University of Southern California (USC), but its under
graduate body contains a higher percentage of blacks,
Asians, Hispanics and native Americans than either
Harvard or Yale.
Recent statistics show that 32.2 percent of American
undergraduates at USC are minorities, whereas at Stan
ford minority students comprise 23.4 percent of the
undergraduate body. Harvard and Yale have 17.4 and
15.4 percent respectively.
S. Allen Counter, director of the Harvard Foundation,
an agency established to improve race relations at Har
vard, said, "I don't think that we have a shortage of any
minorities here in the East."
He added, however, "I think it's unfortunate that we
have not reached representative levels for the minority
groups that are represented in this country. There are
students who are capable of doing the work at Ivy
League schools whom we are just not recruiting or mak
ing contact with."
The percentages for black and native American stu
dents are comparable at all four schools. USC has a far
greater percentage of Asian students than Stanford or
either of the Ivy League schools. Both West Coast
schools have significantly greater percentages of His
panic students than their East Coast competition.
These figures suggest what Stanford Ahthropology
Prof. James Gibbs terms "a East-West split," which
represents a higher percentage of Asians and Hispanics
in the western part of the country and a greater group
awareness and militancy among Hispanics in that same
region.
While Stanford's undergraduate body may contain a
good representative sampling of blacks, Asians, His
panics and native Americans, the University does a
worse job than any of the other three schools surveyed of
matching its percentages of minority students with those
of minority faculty.
Recent statistics show that 6.8 percent of the Universi
ty s ladder faculty (those eligible for and those who have
tenure) are minorities, which is just under one third its
percentage (23.4) of minority undergraduates.
Clearly there is a way to go," Gibbs said, in increas
ing the number of minority professors.
