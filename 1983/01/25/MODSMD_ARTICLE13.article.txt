# Stanford stacks up favorably—but not best

There were clearly qualified
minority students around 10 years
ago. But many of the predominantly
white schools preferred not to invest
in bringing in minority students.'

s
tanford may not be as ethnically diverse as the
University of Southern California (USC), but its under
graduate body contains a higher percentage of blacks,
Asians, Hispanics and native Americans than either
Harvard or Yale.
Recent statistics show that 32.2 percent of American
undergraduates at USC are minorities, whereas at Stan
ford minority students comprise 23.4 percent of the
undergraduate body. Harvard and Yale have 17.4 and
15.4 percent respectively.
S. Allen Counter, director of the Harvard Foundation,
an agency established to improve race relations at Har
vard, said, "I don't think that we have a shortage of any
minorities here in the East."
He added, however, "I think it's unfortunate that we
have not reached representative levels for the minority
groups that are represented in this country. There are
students who are capable of doing the work at Ivy
League schools whom we are just not recruiting or mak
ing contact with."
The percentages for black and native American stu
dents are comparable at all four schools. USC has a far
greater percentage of Asian students than Stanford or
either of the Ivy League schools. Both West Coast
schools have significantly greater percentages of His
panic students than their East Coast competition.
These figures suggest what Stanford Ahthropology
Prof. James Gibbs terms "a East-West split," which
represents a higher percentage of Asians and Hispanics
in the western part of the country and a greater group
awareness and militancy among Hispanics in that same
region.
While Stanford's undergraduate body may contain a
good representative sampling of blacks, Asians, His
panics and native Americans, the University does a
worse job than any of the other three schools surveyed of
matching its percentages of minority students with those
of minority faculty.
Recent statistics show that 6.8 percent of the Universi
ty s ladder faculty (those eligible for and those who have
tenure) are minorities, which is just under one third its
percentage (23.4) of minority undergraduates.
Clearly there is a way to go," Gibbs said, in increas
ing the number of minority professors.
The gap between percentages of minority students

and faculty 'partly represents the fact that the numbers
of minority students is a recent phenomenon, and that it
will take them a while to work their way up through the
PhD level. It also represents the fact that faculty are
much more ambivalent about affirmative action at the
faculty than at the undergraduate level. And many
minority undergraduates find other professions more
appealing than academia," Gibbs said.
Harvard does only slightly better that Stanford at
matching percentages of minority students and profes
sors. At USC the percentage of minority faculty is only
slightly more than one-third of its percentage of minority
undergraduates. Although Yale has the smallest per
centage of minority students of the four schools, it also
has the best minority student-faculty ratio: almost two to
one.
"I question the seriousness of the effort and the sincer
ity of the effort to recruit minority faculty members (at
Harvard,)" Counter said. "I think they should have
more black, more Chicano and more Asian professors.
There are certainly people who are qualified."
Stanford's percentage of minorites in its ladder faculty
is comparable with the percentages of Harvard and Yale.
The University has 6.8 percent, Harvard 5.5 percent and
Yale 7 percent. USC, with 12 percent has a significantly
higher percentage of minority professors because of its
far greater percentage of Asian faculty.
Spokespersons from Stanford, USC, Harvard and
Yale could not agree on any noticeable trends in the
numbers of minority undergraduates and faculty over
the past decade.
The impetus provided by the Civil Rights movement
of the 1960s led to an increase in minority recruitment in
the early 19705, Gibbs said. "The problem now is push
ing beyond that plateau where most schools have re
mained for many years," he added.
Counter said, "There were clearly qualified minority

students around ten years ago. But many of the predom
inantly white schools preferred not to invest in bringing
in minority students." Since then, he said, there has been
at Harvard a significant increase in the number of Asian
students, a slight increase in the number of Chicano
undergraduates and a decrease in the number of black
students.
When asked about any changes in the number of
minority undergraduates at Yale, Judith Hackman, di
rector of the Office of Institutional Research at Yale,
said, "My hunch is that it has been fairly comparable to
this for the last few years."
According to Barbara Pearson, affirmative action of
ficer for USC, USCs affirmative action policy "changes
according to whatever comes out of Washington." Since
1970 the percentage of of minority faculty at USC has
increased from 6.6 percent to the current 12 percent, she
said.
On the subject of minority faculty at Harvard,
Counter said," We've had a slight increase in the number
of minority students, but I don't see any increase in
minority professors at all."
According to Counter, Harvard has "no history" of
minority faculty. "For example, there's been only one
black professor of science in Harvard's history, and I was
that professor," he said.
Fran Holloway, director of affirmative action at Yale,
said, "Our overall experience has been that there is quite
a lot of turnover with minority faculty." Yale i$ currently
increasing the number of its tenured minority faculty
members, she added.
Both West Coast schools offer more variety in minor
ity academic departments than either Harvard or Yale.
USC has the largest number of minority departments,
with a Hispanic Media Culture Department and a Media
Institute for Minorities in the School of Journalism and
an Ethnic Studies Department. "We are in such a large
black, Mexican and Chicano area that everything we do
(for minorities) seems routine," Pearson said.
USC has talked recently of making Ethnic Studies
interdepartmental, she said. "I think it (the number of
majors in the department) has decreased quite a lot. I
don't think it's a very big group."
According to Gibbs, Stanford was the first major pri
vate institution to offer a B.A. in Afro-American
Studies. New this year at the University is a Chicano
Fellows Program which offers courses to under
graduates.
Yale and Harvard both have Afro-American Studies
Departments. In addition, Yale has a Concilium on In
ternational Affairs and Area Studies, which includes a
Council on African Studies. It does scholarly research on
political science, economics and cultural affairs in eight
areas of the world.
Counter described Harvard's Afro-American Studies
as "a very scholarly department." He added, "There are

30 million blacks in this country, and over 70 million in
this hemisphere. Certainly there in enough of a body of
knowledge about Afro-Americans here to warrant a
department."
"I believe that every American university should have
a native American Studies Program, a black Studies
Program, a Latino Studies Program, and an Asian
Studies Program," Counter said.
He cited as the best model the University of California
at Los Angeles's Institute of American Cultures, which
has both academic and cultural programs in Afro-
American, Asian-American, Hispanic-American and
native American studies.
The reason that Harvard now has only one depart
ment focusing on an American minority, Counter said, is
that "everyone wants to claim an equalness in suffering,
but the reality is that the white Europeans and the en
slaved Africans were the first to get started in America."
As more of the other minorities come into the country,
he added, they will demand more recognition.
Yale and Harvard have identical systems of under
graduate housing — residential housing — and likewise
identical housing policies for minorities. David Henson,
dean of student organizations at Yale, said, "Our minor
ity students live in the residential colleges among the
other students."
Counter said, "Harvard has a policy based on its old
tradition. Students are integrated into the houses as well
as they can possibly be." This system, he added, "has its
advantages and disadvantages."
At USC, according to Pearson, minority stu
dents are for the most part housed with non-minorities.
There is one Latino house for students majoring in Latin
American Studies.
Stanford's program of ethnic theme houses is unique
among the four schools surveyed.
The University has black, Asian-American and
Chicano theme houses, in addition to a native American
priority house. "I think that the idea of theme houses is
one that we should continue to work with. For some
students the University experience is a better experience
if they can live in a setting with more than a token
number of students from their own background," Gibbs
said.
"My own belief is that a University residence should
not consist 100 percent of members of one ethnic group.
The key is finding Anglo students who will live in the
theme house and contribute to its program." The Uni
versity's current policy is to try filling at least 50 percent
of a themehouse with students from that particular
ethnic background.
Theme houses distinguish Stanford's cultural program
from Harvard, Yale and USC. But overall, the private,
predominantly white universities have yet to reach rep
resentative levels for minority groups represented in this
country.
