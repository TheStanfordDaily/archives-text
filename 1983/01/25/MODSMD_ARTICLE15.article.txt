# Ethnic academic studies began, continue here

'While the African and
Afro-American Studies program is
prospering, similar programs for
other ethnic groups are either just
beginning or now extinct.'

l n 1969, the year following Martin Luther King's
assassination, the University instituted the first ethni
cally focused academic program in the nation — African
and Afro-American studies.
The African and Afro-American studies bachelor of
arts program, in the planning stages here before King's
death, was in the forefront of ethnically focused
academic programs. (However, Yale followed suit three
weeks later and received much wider publicity.)
African and Afro-American studies, the systematic
investigation of the history, culture and circumstances of
peoples of African descent, remains the University's
only major that concentrates specifically on the situation
of an ethnic minority in the United States, according to
Courses and Degrees.
When the major began, 13 undergraduates were en
rolled, and the number has fluctuated over the years,
according to Anthropology Prof. James Gibbs, original
acting chairman. This year 17 undergraduates are en
rolled, 16 of whom are black and 15 of whom are
double-majoring, mainly in humanities and social sci
ences.
Gibbs pointed out, however, that "we intended that
the program be judged not just as a major but as a
collection of courses, and that it be of service not just to
students in the major but throughout the University."
The desire for such a program became evident in the
1960s when, Gibbs said, there was "quite a bit of interest
in the civil rights movement on campus," and a compara
tively high percentage of students here went to the South
to work on the voters' rights movement.
The interest was manifested on campus by the forma
tion of the Black Students Union (BSU) in 1967. The
BSU created a curriculum committee that worked on
introducing more classes into the University that dealt
with African and Afro-American studies.
Because of a large grant from the Ford Foundation,
the University was expanding its offerings in Afro-
American, Latin American and East Asian studies,
Gibbs said. The grant allowed the University to bring in
several key faculty members, including African spe
cialists Gibbs and Political Science Prof. David Aber
nethy.
A faculty committee on African Studies was formed
and began working simultaneously with the BSU. That
committee later set up a subcommittee charged with

developing a proposal for an African and Afro-
American studies program. The program was officially
launched as an undergraduate major in January 1969.
The program was titled African and Afro-American
studies. "... At the time we had much more faculty
strength in African studies than Afro-American studies.
We also thought it was intellectually important to have a
background in the first to study the latter," Gibbs said.
"We designed the program in such a way as to concen
trate on the strengths we had with the understanding that
the University would expand it as we got other faculty,"
Gibbs said.
The first chairman of the program was St. Clair Drake,
whom Gibbs noted was highly sought-after at the time.
"It was a real coup to get him to come lead our program.
He was one of the few scholars who had researched all
the areas in which blacks had lived," he said.
In 1977 Sylvia Wynter, professor of Spanish and Por
tuguese, took over as chairman for three years. When
she received a fellowship in 1980, Kennell Jackson, as
sociate history professor and current chairman, assumed
the position.
Only nine classes in the program — including one in
troductory class and four core seminars — are not inter
disciplinary or cross-referenced with another department.
Gibbs expressed pride in the new introductory class
offered this fall. Possible future courses include one that

he and Jackson are discussing on the film portrayal of
black culture.
While the African and Afro-American Studies pro
gram is prospering, similar programs for other ethnic
groups are either just beginning or now g or now extinct.
According to Hamuri Befu, anthropology professor
and resident fellow in the East Asian theme house, no
academic program or even courses exist that focus on the
Asian-American experience. "In the past there have
been such courses offered from time to time, usually
sponsored by SCIRE or the Undergraduate Special pro
gram, but they have been sporadic."
Jae So, a theme associate at Okada, the Asian-
American theme house, said that seven or eight years
ago such courses were offered because students ex
pressed strong desire for them. But when those students
graduated, interest waned and the courses were discon
tinued.
The Chicano Fellows Program, by contrast, is gaining
momentum. This year the program will offer five courses
for undergraduates during the academic year. Luis Ar
royo, a visiting history professor, is teaching one each
quarter, and two teaching fellows, both graduate stu
dents, will each teach a class spring quarter. Lillian
Christensen, program assistant for the Chicano Fellows
Program, said the goal of the Chicano Fellows Program
is to have a different visiting professor each year.
