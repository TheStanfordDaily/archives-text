an effort to promote cross-cultural awareness
through undergraduate residential living, the University
began ethnic theme houses after 1970.
"The idea is for us to realize that despite our
differences we are very similar," Okada Resident Fellow
(RF) Cal Lai, a compensation analyst, said.
The Asian-American theme house provides a "cross
cultural education through communal living," he said." I
don't view it as a retreat for Asian-Americans. At most
half the house is Asian-American."
The purpose of theme houses such as Okada would be
defeated if they consisted of less than 50 percent non-
Asia-American students, Lai said.
Casa Zapata RF Arturo Pacecho, associate dean of
the School of Education, said the Chicano theme house
brings Chicano culture into daily life and is a place for
interaction within the Chicano community.
"It serves a purpose of bringing together a significant
number of Chicano students .. . where their own culture
can be a part of their everyday life at Stanford. Another
purpose, inasmuch as only one-third of the house is
Chicano, is cross-cultural interaction and learning.
Much of the basic learning comes in sharing and learning
on a daily basis the lives of people very different from
your own."
In addition to serving Zapata residents, Pacheco said,
"The house has also become a very important nexus
within the Chicano community at Stanford."
About half of the residents of Zapata are freshmen, as
it has been for the last three years. It is difficult for all
students to adjust to the University. But Pacheco said,
"For Chicanos sometimes it's doubly hard."
He added, "Freshmen tend to react and participate in
programs more actively (than upperclassmen)."
Senior Maria Elena Gonzales, who lived in Zapata her
freshman year because she indicated it on her housing
preference card, said, "I didn't want to forget (my
Chicano background)."
Gonzales criticized the charge frequently made that
theme houses lack an intellectual purpose. For example,
Zapata residents tutor underprivileged students in East

Palo Alto. "They speak Spanish at home — it's a real
problem," she said.
"I have the feeling in general that most students are
against them (theme houses)," Gonzales said. "(But)
there's more to Casa Zapata than just being a haven for
Chicanos. They do have a lot of political activities."
She stressed that theme house activities are not exclu
sive. "When they have Cinco de Mayo and Mexican
celebrations, everyone is welcome," she said.
"It's very hard for non-minorities," Gonzales said.
"They feel left out period."
Living in a theme house helps whites understand
minority feelings, Gonzales said. "This isn't something
they (minorities) got placed in for a quarter — this is
something they face every day," she said. "White people
have to look at it as minorities have to live in a culture
different from their own every day. Now they're feeling
the same thing that minorities feel. Many non-minority
students really can't take that."
In the mural in the Zapata dining room, the white
person lacks a face. "Some white people felt personally
attacked by it," Gonzales said.
Because Zapata is in Stern Hall and because many
students only get assigned there because they drew
poorly, they enter the theme house with a negative at
titude. "Even some Chicano people don't want to live
there," Gonzales said.

Theme houses make non-minorities aware of minority
concerns, she added.
Senior Doris Wilson, a resident assistant at the black
theme house, said, "I think that Ujamaa should be a
house where all can come and learn about black cul
ture."
Senior Richard Craven, a former Ujamaa resident and
Ujamaa committee member of the Black Student Union
(BSU), said, "It's more than a dorm — it's a community
center. Ideally it's a place where you can come even if
you don't live here ... where blacks can come and feel
comfortable without feeling alone." He added, "It was
set up to be more than just a dorm ... Black students
proposed that only students that wanted to live in the
dorm live here."
As the assignment system is set up now, only half of the
students can have ethnic priority to get into Ujamaa.
Craven said, "You end up with a lot of people who don't
want to be involved in the activities. I don't think it's set
up to work as students want it."
Senior Cam Hawkins, a member of a black sorority,
said, "The black theme house here is almost like an
escape for black people who have grown up in black
communities . . . You don't have to explain things like
why you like this music, why you dress this way."

native American priority house.
According to junior Sam Winder, one of two program
assistants who help promote the priority house's theme,
the native American community here has been fighting
for a theme house for the last 10 years. "A lot of people
that came here like myself were 'urban Indians.' With a
theme you can get more involved in activities and get a
better awareness," Winder said.
Soto formerly served as a native American house. But
Winder guessed that the lack of native Americans here
(there are only 60 — graduates and undergraduates)
brought about the end of the theme house.
Currently, only five Roble residents are native
Americans. But Winder said, "There are usually at least
12 in Roble."
Roble contains the same percentage of priority stu
dents as other theme houses, Winder said.
Small numbers have not stopped Roble's native
Americans from organizing theme-related activities.
Their main focus this spring will be organizing and rais
ing about $8000 for the Stanford Pow Wow, "an event
where tribes from Northern California, Washington and
Nevada come together and dance," Winder said.

•JHki he housing of students who are forced to
live in the residencies because of low draw numbers has
been a problem for all of the theme houses at one time. A
non-member of the ethnic group the theme promotes
may feel uncomfortable, and among non-house mem
bers theme houses often suffer a bad reputation. Most
theme house residents seem to agree that the bad reputa
tion is unjustified.
Freshman Tivo Romero was assigned to Ujamaa even
though he marked not to live in a theme house on his
housing preference card. Although initially he was not
too happy with his assignment, Romero said he would
want to live at the black theme house next year.
"Underlying everything you've got the personal scale.
Some would feel very uncomfortable if they're the only
of their kind, like I am here. It's good for you though,

like the medicine that tastes bad," Romero said. He
enjoys the experience of living in the black theme house
because he comes from Argentina, a "pure white com
munity," he said.
"This University talks to us about diversity, but what
we'd like to do is show diversity," he said." Minorities in
this University are forced to interact with the majority."
Sophomore Ina Roy, who is living in Okada this year
because she drew a poor housing number, is also happy
with her assignment. Originally assigned to Zapata, she
wait-listed into Okada at the beginning of the year be
cause she had heard they conduct many house meetings
in Spanish. "There's a lot of kids here that were brought
up with the same morals. It brings me closer to myself,"
Roy said.
Sophomore Dave McGee, also assigned to Okada
because of a low housing number, said," I don't think it's
that different than the rest of the Wilbur houses." House
unity increases "as the year goes along," he said.
Sophomore Angela Walker, an Ujamaa resident,
stressed the unity of the black house. "Ujamaa itself
means familyhood, and that's what the house tries to
emphasize."
Walker chose to live in Ujamaa. Even when she lived
elsewhere last year, she said, "I could feel comfortable
with the people here, like I had something in common."
Living in Ujamaa is invaluable, she said, "if you come
from a predominantly black environment and you come
to Stanford where it's predominantly white."
According to junior Jae So, a theme associate at
Okada, the main function of the house is "not to share
culture but to realize how much alike people are."
Okada is somewhat different than other theme houses
because, she said, "Stanford doesn't consider Asian-
Americans a minority, and the people here don't con
sider themselves a minority. Most of them come from
similar backgrounds as Caucasians."
Besides all of the activities any other dorm would
sponsor such as ski trips, faculty speakers and movies,
theme houses add theme-related activities. Residents of
Okada, Ujamaa and Zapata non-ethnic group members
often attend activities. Each theme house has several
theme associates who organize events.
Among Okada's theme activities have been a discus
sion on interracial dating, a presentation by poet Nelli
Wong and a trip to a traditional tea ceremony. At the
beginning of the year house members responded to a
questionnaire asking which activities they would most
like to attend, and the Okada staff has been receptive to
their suggestions.
Pacheco said, "In the educational program here (at
Zapata) we try and ground the learning in an academic
program." For example, he said, Chicano faculty mem
bers lecture at the house. And Pacheco taught a
SWOPSI course on Chicano lives in the house. About 40
percent of the students were non-Chicanos, he said.
In addition, Zapata theme activities have included a
Cinco de Mayo celebration, a Latin American film series
and a celebration of Mexico's independence.'
Pacheco cited budgetary problems in continuing cul
tural activities. For example, Zapata residents peti
tioned for and received a Mexican food line for dinner

last year. But Pacheco said, "It was cut back this year
because of budget problems."
Expressing disappointment, Pacheco said, "Food is
obviously one of the most obvious expressions of one's
culture. We're limited in many respects by being in Stern
Hall."
Senior Marcy Hicks, theme associate at Ujamaa, said
the theme at Ujamaa this year is, "A Wordly Picture of
Black Culture." Thus many of the house's theme ac
tivities have related to black life in area such as the
Caribbean or Africa. Other theme-related activities this
year have included showing the movie Black Orpheus,
hearing a talk on the history of Ujamaa and listening to a
speaker discuss black English as a science. The staff at
Ujamaa also decorates the walls of the dorm with posters
and clippings that enhance the dorm's theme.
Although Ujamaa's current house policy not to spend
money on alcohol for parties is not necessarily theme
related, it is unique here on campus.
"If we're going to do all of these activities and we
spend $1000 on alcohol, we won't have any money left.
You can have fun without alcohol," Wilson said. "I've
seen people killed on alcohol, and I'm not going to be
responsible." She added, "None of the people have
complained."
Okada, Ujamaa and Zapata are official cultural theme
houses whose large minority composition is advocated
officially by the University. Mirrielees, however, is seen
by many as an unofficial black and Chicano house.
Gonzales, currently a Mirrielees resident, said. "It's
true to an extent because blacks and Chicanos like to live
here . . . It's their choice."
Graduate student Sharon Padilla, a resident assistant
at Mirrielees, said, "It's no secret that there are a
number of minority students living in Mirrielees."
About 50 black students live in Mirrielees this year, she
said.
The apartment housing is an attractive alternative to
the theme houses in Wilbur and Stern halls, she said.
"They can get away from food service, and for a lot of
people the food is very different from what they're used
to eating." %
Senior Hoover Fellow John Bunzel, president of San
Jose State during the 19705, is doing a private study
which includes theme houses. "There's been some in
quiries made by a number of people in the University,"
he said. Bunzel is writing a narrative history and analysis
of the situation here over the past 15 years.
Bunzel denied claims that he opposes theme houses,
particularly since he is still researching the issue.
According to Norm Robinson, associate dean of Resi
dential Education, the subcommittee on Residential
Education is advising the Committee on Undergraduate
Studies on theme houses.
Assistant Prof, of History Stephen Ferruolo, a
member of the subcommittee, said that it is seeing if
there are ways to "fit theme houses a little bit better into
a program for revised residential education." The sub
committees' final report, due Feb. 1, will say that there
are "potentially some changes in the location and
makeup of theme houses," Ferruolo said.

live in the residencies because of low draw numbers has
been a problem for all of the theme houses at one time. A
non-member of the ethnic group the theme promotes
may feel uncomfortable, and among non-house mem
bers theme houses often suffer a bad reputation. Most
theme house residents seem to agree that the bad reputa
tion is unjustified.
Freshman Tivo Romero was assigned to Ujamaa even
though he marked not to live in a theme house on his
housing preference card. Although initially he was not
too happy with his assignment, Romero said he would
want to live at the black theme house next year.
"Underlying everything you've got the personal scale.
Some would feel very uncomfortable if they're the only
of their kind, like I am here. It's good for you though,

like the medicine that tastes bad," Romero said. He
enjoys the experience of living in the black theme house
because he comes from Argentina, a "pure white com
munity," he said.
"This University talks to us about diversity, but what
we'd like to do is show diversity," he said." Minorities in
this University are forced to interact with the majority."
Sophomore Ina Roy, who is living in Okada this year
because she drew a poor housing number, is also happy
with her assignment. Originally assigned to Zapata, she
wait-listed into Okada at the beginning of the year be
cause she had heard they conduct many house meetings
in Spanish. "There's a lot of kids here that were brought
up with the same morals. It brings me closer to myself,"
Roy said.
Sophomore Dave McGee, also assigned to Okada
because of a low housing number, said," I don't think it's
that different than the rest of the Wilbur houses." House
unity increases "as the year goes along," he said.
Sophomore Angela Walker, an Ujamaa resident,
stressed the unity of the black house. "Ujamaa itself
means familyhood, and that's what the house tries to
emphasize."
Walker chose to live in Ujamaa. Even when she lived
elsewhere last year, she said, "I could feel comfortable
with the people here, like I had something in common."
Living in Ujamaa is invaluable, she said, "if you come
from a predominantly black environment and you come
to Stanford where it's predominantly white."
According to junior Jae So, a theme associate at
Okada, the main function of the house is "not to share
culture but to realize how much alike people are."
Okada is somewhat different than other theme houses
because, she said, "Stanford doesn't consider Asian-
Americans a minority, and the people here don't con
sider themselves a minority. Most of them come from
similar backgrounds as Caucasians."
Besides all of the activities any other dorm would
sponsor such as ski trips, faculty speakers and movies,
theme houses add theme-related activities. Residents of
Okada, Ujamaa and Zapata non-ethnic group members
often attend activities. Each theme house has several
theme associates who organize events.
Among Okada's theme activities have been a discus
sion on interracial dating, a presentation by poet Nelli
Wong and a trip to a traditional tea ceremony. At the
beginning of the year house members responded to a
questionnaire asking which activities they would most
like to attend, and the Okada staff has been receptive to
their suggestions.
Pacheco said, "In the educational program here (at
Zapata) we try and ground the learning in an academic
program." For example, he said, Chicano faculty mem
bers lecture at the house. And Pacheco taught a
SWOPSI course on Chicano lives in the house. About 40
percent of the students were non-Chicanos, he said.
In addition, Zapata theme activities have included a
Cinco de Mayo celebration, a Latin American film series
and a celebration of Mexico's independence.'
Pacheco cited budgetary problems in continuing cul
tural activities. For example, Zapata residents peti
tioned for and received a Mexican food line for dinner

last year. But Pacheco said, "It was cut back this year
because of budget problems."
Expressing disappointment, Pacheco said, "Food is
obviously one of the most obvious expressions of one's
culture. We're limited in many respects by being in Stern
Hall."
Senior Marcy Hicks, theme associate at Ujamaa, said
the theme at Ujamaa this year is, "A Wordly Picture of
Black Culture." Thus many of the house's theme ac
tivities have related to black life in area such as the
Caribbean or Africa. Other theme-related activities this
year have included showing the movie Black Orpheus,
hearing a talk on the history of Ujamaa and listening to a
speaker discuss black English as a science. The staff at
Ujamaa also decorates the walls of the dorm with posters
and clippings that enhance the dorm's theme.
Although Ujamaa's current house policy not to spend
money on alcohol for parties is not necessarily theme
related, it is unique here on campus.
"If we're going to do all of these activities and we
spend $1000 on alcohol, we won't have any money left.
You can have fun without alcohol," Wilson said. "I've
seen people killed on alcohol, and I'm not going to be
responsible." She added, "None of the people have
complained."
Okada, Ujamaa and Zapata are official cultural theme
houses whose large minority composition is advocated
officially by the University. Mirrielees, however, is seen
by many as an unofficial black and Chicano house.
Gonzales, currently a Mirrielees resident, said. "It's
true to an extent because blacks and Chicanos like to live
here . . . It's their choice."
Graduate student Sharon Padilla, a resident assistant
at Mirrielees, said, "It's no secret that there are a
number of minority students living in Mirrielees."
About 50 black students live in Mirrielees this year, she
said.
The apartment housing is an attractive alternative to
the theme houses in Wilbur and Stern halls, she said.
"They can get away from food service, and for a lot of
people the food is very different from what they're used
to eating." %
Senior Hoover Fellow John Bunzel, president of San
Jose State during the 19705, is doing a private study
which includes theme houses. "There's been some in
quiries made by a number of people in the University,"
he said. Bunzel is writing a narrative history and analysis
of the situation here over the past 15 years.
Bunzel denied claims that he opposes theme houses,
particularly since he is still researching the issue.
According to Norm Robinson, associate dean of Resi
dential Education, the subcommittee on Residential
Education is advising the Committee on Undergraduate
Studies on theme houses.
Assistant Prof, of History Stephen Ferruolo, a
member of the subcommittee, said that it is seeing if
there are ways to "fit theme houses a little bit better into
a program for revised residential education." The sub
committees' final report, due Feb. 1, will say that there
are "potentially some changes in the location and
makeup of theme houses," Ferruolo said.

music, why you dress this way.'

an effort to promote cross-cultural awareness
through undergraduate residential living, the University
began ethnic theme houses after 1970.
"The idea is for us to realize that despite our
differences we are very similar," Okada Resident Fellow
(RF) Cal Lai, a compensation analyst, said.
The Asian-American theme house provides a "cross
cultural education through communal living," he said." I
don't view it as a retreat for Asian-Americans. At most
half the house is Asian-American."
The purpose of theme houses such as Okada would be
defeated if they consisted of less than 50 percent non-
Asia-American students, Lai said.
Casa Zapata RF Arturo Pacecho, associate dean of
the School of Education, said the Chicano theme house
brings Chicano culture into daily life and is a place for
interaction within the Chicano community.
"It serves a purpose of bringing together a significant
number of Chicano students .. . where their own culture
can be a part of their everyday life at Stanford. Another
purpose, inasmuch as only one-third of the house is
Chicano, is cross-cultural interaction and learning.
Much of the basic learning comes in sharing and learning
on a daily basis the lives of people very different from
your own."
In addition to serving Zapata residents, Pacheco said,
"The house has also become a very important nexus
within the Chicano community at Stanford."
About half of the residents of Zapata are freshmen, as
it has been for the last three years. It is difficult for all
students to adjust to the University. But Pacheco said,
"For Chicanos sometimes it's doubly hard."
He added, "Freshmen tend to react and participate in
programs more actively (than upperclassmen)."
Senior Maria Elena Gonzales, who lived in Zapata her
freshman year because she indicated it on her housing
preference card, said, "I didn't want to forget (my
Chicano background)."
Gonzales criticized the charge frequently made that
theme houses lack an intellectual purpose. For example,
Zapata residents tutor underprivileged students in East

Palo Alto. "They speak Spanish at home — it's a real
problem," she said.
"I have the feeling in general that most students are
against them (theme houses)," Gonzales said. "(But)
there's more to Casa Zapata than just being a haven for
Chicanos. They do have a lot of political activities."
She stressed that theme house activities are not exclu
sive. "When they have Cinco de Mayo and Mexican
celebrations, everyone is welcome," she said.
"It's very hard for non-minorities," Gonzales said.
"They feel left out period."
Living in a theme house helps whites understand
minority feelings, Gonzales said. "This isn't something
they (minorities) got placed in for a quarter — this is
something they face every day," she said. "White people
have to look at it as minorities have to live in a culture
different from their own every day. Now they're feeling
the same thing that minorities feel. Many non-minority
students really can't take that."
In the mural in the Zapata dining room, the white
person lacks a face. "Some white people felt personally
attacked by it," Gonzales said.
Because Zapata is in Stern Hall and because many
students only get assigned there because they drew
poorly, they enter the theme house with a negative at
titude. "Even some Chicano people don't want to live
there," Gonzales said.

Theme houses make non-minorities aware of minority
concerns, she added.
Senior Doris Wilson, a resident assistant at the black
theme house, said, "I think that Ujamaa should be a
house where all can come and learn about black cul
ture."
Senior Richard Craven, a former Ujamaa resident and
Ujamaa committee member of the Black Student Union
(BSU), said, "It's more than a dorm — it's a community
center. Ideally it's a place where you can come even if
you don't live here ... where blacks can come and feel
comfortable without feeling alone." He added, "It was
set up to be more than just a dorm ... Black students
proposed that only students that wanted to live in the
dorm live here."
As the assignment system is set up now, only half of the
students can have ethnic priority to get into Ujamaa.
Craven said, "You end up with a lot of people who don't
want to be involved in the activities. I don't think it's set
up to work as students want it."
Senior Cam Hawkins, a member of a black sorority,
said, "The black theme house here is almost like an
escape for black people who have grown up in black
communities . . . You don't have to explain things like
why you like this music, why you dress this way."
Although it is not a theme house, Roble Hall is the

native American priority house.
According to junior Sam Winder, one of two program
assistants who help promote the priority house's theme,
the native American community here has been fighting
for a theme house for the last 10 years. "A lot of people
that came here like myself were 'urban Indians.' With a
theme you can get more involved in activities and get a
better awareness," Winder said.
Soto formerly served as a native American house. But
Winder guessed that the lack of native Americans here
(there are only 60 — graduates and undergraduates)
brought about the end of the theme house.
Currently, only five Roble residents are native
Americans. But Winder said, "There are usually at least
12 in Roble."
Roble contains the same percentage of priority stu
dents as other theme houses, Winder said.
Small numbers have not stopped Roble's native
Americans from organizing theme-related activities.
Their main focus this spring will be organizing and rais
ing about $8000 for the Stanford Pow Wow, "an event
where tribes from Northern California, Washington and
Nevada come together and dance," Winder said.

Bunzel denied claims that he opposes theme houses,

According to Norm Robinson, associate dean of Resi

Education is advising the Committee on Undergraduate
Studies on theme houses.
Assistant Prof, of History Stephen Ferruolo, a
member of the subcommittee, said that it is seeing if
there are ways to "fit theme houses a little bit better into

an effort to promote cross-cultural awareness
through undergraduate residential living, the University
began ethnic theme houses after 1970.
"The idea is for us to realize that despite our
differences we are very similar," Okada Resident Fellow
(RF) Cal Lai, a compensation analyst, said.
The Asian-American theme house provides a "cross
cultural education through communal living," he said." I
don't view it as a retreat for Asian-Americans. At most
half the house is Asian-American."
The purpose of theme houses such as Okada would be
defeated if they consisted of less than 50 percent non-
Asia-American students, Lai said.
Casa Zapata RF Arturo Pacecho, associate dean of
the School of Education, said the Chicano theme house
brings Chicano culture into daily life and is a place for
interaction within the Chicano community.
"It serves a purpose of bringing together a significant
number of Chicano students .. . where their own culture
can be a part of their everyday life at Stanford. Another
purpose, inasmuch as only one-third of the house is
Chicano, is cross-cultural interaction and learning.
Much of the basic learning comes in sharing and learning
on a daily basis the lives of people very different from
your own."
In addition to serving Zapata residents, Pacheco said,
"The house has also become a very important nexus
within the Chicano community at Stanford."
About half of the residents of Zapata are freshmen, as
it has been for the last three years. It is difficult for all
students to adjust to the University. But Pacheco said,
"For Chicanos sometimes it's doubly hard."
He added, "Freshmen tend to react and participate in
programs more actively (than upperclassmen)."
Senior Maria Elena Gonzales, who lived in Zapata her
freshman year because she indicated it on her housing
preference card, said, "I didn't want to forget (my
Chicano background)."
Gonzales criticized the charge frequently made that
theme houses lack an intellectual purpose. For example,
Zapata residents tutor underprivileged students in East

Palo Alto. "They speak Spanish at home — it's a real
problem," she said.
"I have the feeling in general that most students are
against them (theme houses)," Gonzales said. "(But)
there's more to Casa Zapata than just being a haven for
Chicanos. They do have a lot of political activities."
She stressed that theme house activities are not exclu
sive. "When they have Cinco de Mayo and Mexican
celebrations, everyone is welcome," she said.
"It's very hard for non-minorities," Gonzales said.
"They feel left out period."
Living in a theme house helps whites understand
minority feelings, Gonzales said. "This isn't something
they (minorities) got placed in for a quarter — this is
something they face every day," she said. "White people
have to look at it as minorities have to live in a culture
different from their own every day. Now they're feeling
the same thing that minorities feel. Many non-minority
students really can't take that."
In the mural in the Zapata dining room, the white
person lacks a face. "Some white people felt personally
attacked by it," Gonzales said.
Because Zapata is in Stern Hall and because many
students only get assigned there because they drew
poorly, they enter the theme house with a negative at
titude. "Even some Chicano people don't want to live
there," Gonzales said.

Theme houses make non-minorities aware of minority
concerns, she added.
Senior Doris Wilson, a resident assistant at the black
theme house, said, "I think that Ujamaa should be a
house where all can come and learn about black cul
ture."
Senior Richard Craven, a former Ujamaa resident and
Ujamaa committee member of the Black Student Union
(BSU), said, "It's more than a dorm — it's a community
center. Ideally it's a place where you can come even if
you don't live here ... where blacks can come and feel
comfortable without feeling alone." He added, "It was
set up to be more than just a dorm ... Black students
proposed that only students that wanted to live in the
dorm live here."
As the assignment system is set up now, only half of the
students can have ethnic priority to get into Ujamaa.
Craven said, "You end up with a lot of people who don't
want to be involved in the activities. I don't think it's set
up to work as students want it."
Senior Cam Hawkins, a member of a black sorority,
said, "The black theme house here is almost like an

communities . . . You don't have to explain things like

native American priority house.
According to junior Sam Winder, one of two program
assistants who help promote the priority house's theme,
the native American community here has been fighting
for a theme house for the last 10 years. "A lot of people
that came here like myself were 'urban Indians.' With a
theme you can get more involved in activities and get a
better awareness," Winder said.
Soto formerly served as a native American house. But
Winder guessed that the lack of native Americans here
(there are only 60 — graduates and undergraduates)
brought about the end of the theme house.
Currently, only five Roble residents are native
Americans. But Winder said, "There are usually at least
12 in Roble."
Roble contains the same percentage of priority stu
dents as other theme houses, Winder said.
Small numbers have not stopped Roble's native
Americans from organizing theme-related activities.
Their main focus this spring will be organizing and rais
ing about $8000 for the Stanford Pow Wow, "an event
where tribes from Northern California, Washington and
Nevada come together and dance," Winder said.
T
•JHki he housing of students who are forced to
live in the residencies because of low draw numbers has
been a problem for all of the theme houses at one time. A
non-member of the ethnic group the theme promotes
may feel uncomfortable, and among non-house mem
bers theme houses often suffer a bad reputation. Most
theme house residents seem to agree that the bad reputa
tion is unjustified.
Freshman Tivo Romero was assigned to Ujamaa even
though he marked not to live in a theme house on his
housing preference card. Although initially he was not
too happy with his assignment, Romero said he would
want to live at the black theme house next year.
"Underlying everything you've got the personal scale.
Some would feel very uncomfortable if they're the only
of their kind, like I am here. It's good for you though,

like the medicine that tastes bad," Romero said. He
enjoys the experience of living in the black theme house
because he comes from Argentina, a "pure white com
munity," he said.
"This University talks to us about diversity, but what
we'd like to do is show diversity," he said." Minorities in
this University are forced to interact with the majority."
Sophomore Ina Roy, who is living in Okada this year
because she drew a poor housing number, is also happy
with her assignment. Originally assigned to Zapata, she
wait-listed into Okada at the beginning of the year be
cause she had heard they conduct many house meetings
in Spanish. "There's a lot of kids here that were brought
up with the same morals. It brings me closer to myself,"
Roy said.
Sophomore Dave McGee, also assigned to Okada
because of a low housing number, said," I don't think it's
that different than the rest of the Wilbur houses." House
unity increases "as the year goes along," he said.
Sophomore Angela Walker, an Ujamaa resident,
stressed the unity of the black house. "Ujamaa itself
means familyhood, and that's what the house tries to
emphasize."
Walker chose to live in Ujamaa. Even when she lived
elsewhere last year, she said, "I could feel comfortable
with the people here, like I had something in common."
Living in Ujamaa is invaluable, she said, "if you come
from a predominantly black environment and you come
to Stanford where it's predominantly white."
According to junior Jae So, a theme associate at
Okada, the main function of the house is "not to share
culture but to realize how much alike people are."
Okada is somewhat different than other theme houses
because, she said, "Stanford doesn't consider Asian-
Americans a minority, and the people here don't con
sider themselves a minority. Most of them come from
similar backgrounds as Caucasians."
Besides all of the activities any other dorm would
sponsor such as ski trips, faculty speakers and movies,
theme houses add theme-related activities. Residents of
Okada, Ujamaa and Zapata non-ethnic group members
often attend activities. Each theme house has several
theme associates who organize events.
Among Okada's theme activities have been a discus
sion on interracial dating, a presentation by poet Nelli
Wong and a trip to a traditional tea ceremony. At the
beginning of the year house members responded to a
questionnaire asking which activities they would most
like to attend, and the Okada staff has been receptive to
their suggestions.
Pacheco said, "In the educational program here (at
Zapata) we try and ground the learning in an academic
program." For example, he said, Chicano faculty mem
bers lecture at the house. And Pacheco taught a
SWOPSI course on Chicano lives in the house. About 40
percent of the students were non-Chicanos, he said.
In addition, Zapata theme activities have included a
Cinco de Mayo celebration, a Latin American film series
and a celebration of Mexico's independence.'
Pacheco cited budgetary problems in continuing cul
tural activities. For example, Zapata residents peti
tioned for and received a Mexican food line for dinner

last year. But Pacheco said, "It was cut back this year
because of budget problems."
Expressing disappointment, Pacheco said, "Food is
obviously one of the most obvious expressions of one's
culture. We're limited in many respects by being in Stern
Hall."
Senior Marcy Hicks, theme associate at Ujamaa, said
the theme at Ujamaa this year is, "A Wordly Picture of
Black Culture." Thus many of the house's theme ac
tivities have related to black life in area such as the
Caribbean or Africa. Other theme-related activities this
year have included showing the movie Black Orpheus,
hearing a talk on the history of Ujamaa and listening to a
speaker discuss black English as a science. The staff at
Ujamaa also decorates the walls of the dorm with posters
and clippings that enhance the dorm's theme.
Although Ujamaa's current house policy not to spend
money on alcohol for parties is not necessarily theme
related, it is unique here on campus.
"If we're going to do all of these activities and we
spend $1000 on alcohol, we won't have any money left.
You can have fun without alcohol," Wilson said. "I've
seen people killed on alcohol, and I'm not going to be
responsible." She added, "None of the people have
complained."
Okada, Ujamaa and Zapata are official cultural theme
houses whose large minority composition is advocated
officially by the University. Mirrielees, however, is seen
by many as an unofficial black and Chicano house.
Gonzales, currently a Mirrielees resident, said. "It's
true to an extent because blacks and Chicanos like to live
here . . . It's their choice."
Graduate student Sharon Padilla, a resident assistant
at Mirrielees, said, "It's no secret that there are a
number of minority students living in Mirrielees."
About 50 black students live in Mirrielees this year, she
said.
The apartment housing is an attractive alternative to
the theme houses in Wilbur and Stern halls, she said.
"They can get away from food service, and for a lot of
people the food is very different from what they're used
to eating." %
Senior Hoover Fellow John Bunzel, president of San
Jose State during the 19705, is doing a private study
which includes theme houses. "There's been some in
quiries made by a number of people in the University,"
he said. Bunzel is writing a narrative history and analysis

Winder guessed that the lack of native Americans here
(there are only 60 — graduates and undergraduates)
brought about the end of the theme house.
Currently, only five Roble residents are native
Americans. But Winder said, "There are usually at least
12 in Roble."
Roble contains the same percentage of priority stu
dents as other theme houses, Winder said.
Small numbers have not stopped Roble's native
Americans from organizing theme-related activities.
Their main focus this spring will be organizing and rais
ing about $8000 for the Stanford Pow Wow, "an event
where tribes from Northern California, Washington and
Nevada come together and dance," Winder said.
T
•JHki he housing of students who are forced to
live in the residencies because of low draw numbers has
been a problem for all of the theme houses at one time. A
non-member of the ethnic group the theme promotes
may feel uncomfortable, and among non-house mem
bers theme houses often suffer a bad reputation. Most
theme house residents seem to agree that the bad reputa
tion is unjustified.
Freshman Tivo Romero was assigned to Ujamaa even
though he marked not to live in a theme house on his
housing preference card. Although initially he was not
too happy with his assignment, Romero said he would
want to live at the black theme house next year.
"Underlying everything you've got the personal scale.
Some would feel very uncomfortable if they're the only
of their kind, like I am here. It's good for you though,

like the medicine that tastes bad," Romero said. He
enjoys the experience of living in the black theme house
because he comes from Argentina, a "pure white com
munity," he said.
"This University talks to us about diversity, but what
we'd like to do is show diversity," he said." Minorities in
this University are forced to interact with the majority."
Sophomore Ina Roy, who is living in Okada this year
because she drew a poor housing number, is also happy
with her assignment. Originally assigned to Zapata, she
wait-listed into Okada at the beginning of the year be
cause she had heard they conduct many house meetings
in Spanish. "There's a lot of kids here that were brought
up with the same morals. It brings me closer to myself,"
Roy said.
Sophomore Dave McGee, also assigned to Okada
because of a low housing number, said," I don't think it's
that different than the rest of the Wilbur houses." House
unity increases "as the year goes along," he said.
Sophomore Angela Walker, an Ujamaa resident,
stressed the unity of the black house. "Ujamaa itself
means familyhood, and that's what the house tries to
emphasize."
Walker chose to live in Ujamaa. Even when she lived
elsewhere last year, she said, "I could feel comfortable
with the people here, like I had something in common."
Living in Ujamaa is invaluable, she said, "if you come
from a predominantly black environment and you come
to Stanford where it's predominantly white."
According to junior Jae So, a theme associate at
Okada, the main function of the house is "not to share
culture but to realize how much alike people are."
Okada is somewhat different than other theme houses
because, she said, "Stanford doesn't consider Asian-
Americans a minority, and the people here don't con
sider themselves a minority. Most of them come from
similar backgrounds as Caucasians."
Besides all of the activities any other dorm would
sponsor such as ski trips, faculty speakers and movies,
theme houses add theme-related activities. Residents of
Okada, Ujamaa and Zapata non-ethnic group members
often attend activities. Each theme house has several
theme associates who organize events.
Among Okada's theme activities have been a discus
sion on interracial dating, a presentation by poet Nelli
Wong and a trip to a traditional tea ceremony. At the
beginning of the year house members responded to a
questionnaire asking which activities they would most
like to attend, and the Okada staff has been receptive to
their suggestions.
Pacheco said, "In the educational program here (at
Zapata) we try and ground the learning in an academic
program." For example, he said, Chicano faculty mem
bers lecture at the house. And Pacheco taught a
SWOPSI course on Chicano lives in the house. About 40
percent of the students were non-Chicanos, he said.
In addition, Zapata theme activities have included a
Cinco de Mayo celebration, a Latin American film series
and a celebration of Mexico's independence.'
Pacheco cited budgetary problems in continuing cul
tural activities. For example, Zapata residents peti
tioned for and received a Mexican food line for dinner

last year. But Pacheco said, "It was cut back this year
because of budget problems."
Expressing disappointment, Pacheco said, "Food is
obviously one of the most obvious expressions of one's
culture. We're limited in many respects by being in Stern
Hall."
Senior Marcy Hicks, theme associate at Ujamaa, said
the theme at Ujamaa this year is, "A Wordly Picture of
Black Culture." Thus many of the house's theme ac
tivities have related to black life in area such as the
Caribbean or Africa. Other theme-related activities this
year have included showing the movie Black Orpheus,
hearing a talk on the history of Ujamaa and listening to a
speaker discuss black English as a science. The staff at
Ujamaa also decorates the walls of the dorm with posters
and clippings that enhance the dorm's theme.
Although Ujamaa's current house policy not to spend
money on alcohol for parties is not necessarily theme
related, it is unique here on campus.
"If we're going to do all of these activities and we
spend $1000 on alcohol, we won't have any money left.
You can have fun without alcohol," Wilson said. "I've
seen people killed on alcohol, and I'm not going to be
responsible." She added, "None of the people have
complained."
Okada, Ujamaa and Zapata are official cultural theme
houses whose large minority composition is advocated
officially by the University. Mirrielees, however, is seen
by many as an unofficial black and Chicano house.
Gonzales, currently a Mirrielees resident, said. "It's
true to an extent because blacks and Chicanos like to live
here . . . It's their choice."
Graduate student Sharon Padilla, a resident assistant
at Mirrielees, said, "It's no secret that there are a
number of minority students living in Mirrielees."
About 50 black students live in Mirrielees this year, she
said.
The apartment housing is an attractive alternative to
the theme houses in Wilbur and Stern halls, she said.
"They can get away from food service, and for a lot of
people the food is very different from what they're used
to eating." %
Senior Hoover Fellow John Bunzel, president of San
Jose State during the 19705, is doing a private study
which includes theme houses. "There's been some in
quiries made by a number of people in the University,"
he said. Bunzel is writing a narrative history and analysis
of the situation here over the past 15 years.
Bunzel denied claims that he opposes theme houses,
particularly since he is still researching the issue.
According to Norm Robinson, associate dean of Resi
dential Education, the subcommittee on Residential
Education is advising the Committee on Undergraduate
Studies on theme houses.
Assistant Prof, of History Stephen Ferruolo, a
member of the subcommittee, said that it is seeing if
there are ways to "fit theme houses a little bit better into
a program for revised residential education." The sub
committees' final report, due Feb. 1, will say that there
are "potentially some changes in the location and
makeup of theme houses," Ferruolo said.
