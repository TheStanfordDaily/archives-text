# Minority houses: awareness or segregation?

The black theme house here is
almost like an escape for black
people who have grown up in black
communities ... You don't have to
explain things like why you like this
music, why you dress this way.'

an effort to promote cross-cultural awareness
through undergraduate residential living, the University
began ethnic theme houses after 1970.
"The idea is for us to realize that despite our
differences we are very similar," Okada Resident Fellow
(RF) Cal Lai, a compensation analyst, said.
The Asian-American theme house provides a "cross
cultural education through communal living," he said." I
don't view it as a retreat for Asian-Americans. At most
half the house is Asian-American."
The purpose of theme houses such as Okada would be
defeated if they consisted of less than 50 percent non-
Asia-American students, Lai said.
Casa Zapata RF Arturo Pacecho, associate dean of
the School of Education, said the Chicano theme house
brings Chicano culture into daily life and is a place for
interaction within the Chicano community.
"It serves a purpose of bringing together a significant
number of Chicano students .. . where their own culture
can be a part of their everyday life at Stanford. Another
purpose, inasmuch as only one-third of the house is
Chicano, is cross-cultural interaction and learning.
Much of the basic learning comes in sharing and learning
on a daily basis the lives of people very different from
your own."
In addition to serving Zapata residents, Pacheco said,
"The house has also become a very important nexus
within the Chicano community at Stanford."
About half of the residents of Zapata are freshmen, as
it has been for the last three years. It is difficult for all
students to adjust to the University. But Pacheco said,
"For Chicanos sometimes it's doubly hard."
He added, "Freshmen tend to react and participate in
programs more actively (than upperclassmen)."
Senior Maria Elena Gonzales, who lived in Zapata her
freshman year because she indicated it on her housing
preference card, said, "I didn't want to forget (my
Chicano background)."
Gonzales criticized the charge frequently made that
theme houses lack an intellectual purpose. For example,
Zapata residents tutor underprivileged students in East

Palo Alto. "They speak Spanish at home — it's a real
problem," she said.
"I have the feeling in general that most students are
against them (theme houses)," Gonzales said. "(But)
there's more to Casa Zapata than just being a haven for
Chicanos. They do have a lot of political activities."
She stressed that theme house activities are not exclu
sive. "When they have Cinco de Mayo and Mexican
celebrations, everyone is welcome," she said.
"It's very hard for non-minorities," Gonzales said.
"They feel left out period."
Living in a theme house helps whites understand
minority feelings, Gonzales said. "This isn't something
they (minorities) got placed in for a quarter — this is
something they face every day," she said. "White people
have to look at it as minorities have to live in a culture
different from their own every day. Now they're feeling
the same thing that minorities feel. Many non-minority
students really can't take that."
In the mural in the Zapata dining room, the white
person lacks a face. "Some white people felt personally
attacked by it," Gonzales said.
Because Zapata is in Stern Hall and because many
students only get assigned there because they drew
poorly, they enter the theme house with a negative at
titude. "Even some Chicano people don't want to live
there," Gonzales said.

Theme houses make non-minorities aware of minority
concerns, she added.
Senior Doris Wilson, a resident assistant at the black
theme house, said, "I think that Ujamaa should be a
house where all can come and learn about black cul
ture."
Senior Richard Craven, a former Ujamaa resident and
Ujamaa committee member of the Black Student Union
(BSU), said, "It's more than a dorm — it's a community
center. Ideally it's a place where you can come even if
you don't live here ... where blacks can come and feel
comfortable without feeling alone." He added, "It was
set up to be more than just a dorm ... Black students
proposed that only students that wanted to live in the
dorm live here."
As the assignment system is set up now, only half of the
students can have ethnic priority to get into Ujamaa.
Craven said, "You end up with a lot of people who don't
want to be involved in the activities. I don't think it's set
up to work as students want it."
Senior Cam Hawkins, a member of a black sorority,
said, "The black theme house here is almost like an
escape for black people who have grown up in black
communities . . . You don't have to explain things like
why you like this music, why you dress this way."

In what some Zapata residents regard as a social statement against Caucasians, the Chicano theme house
