Yamani said the meeting was "a complete failure."
The possibility was left open that Saudi Arabia could
carry out its implied threat to reduce its price if there was
no agreement, which could touch off a series of price cuts
around the world and undermine OPEC's already erod
ing power over prices.
Oteiba was quoted by the Gulf News Agency in
Bahrain as declaring that Persian Gulf oil-producers
were "now free to decide what they deem suitable for the
protection of their interests."
Yamani said Saudi Arabia would not cut the Saudi
price without consent of other cartel members.
"We don't want to start a price war," he said.
International bankers fear that a sudden and large
drop in prices could lead to default on billions of dollars
of loans to countries such as Mexico and Venezuela
which depend on oil sales for national income.
Mexico exports 1.5 million barrels a day, so every price
drop of $ 1 would cost Mexico $1.5 million a day at a time
when the country is struggling through its worst econom
ic crisis and trying to pay off an $80 billion foreign debt.
Mexican oil officials had no immediate comment on
the meeting.
Other economists say it also would mean an improve
ment of conditions for importing nations, such as Brazil.
It also would mean lower prices for gasoline and other
products made from crude oil.
Reagan drops in popularity polls
Washington — When President Reagan delivers his
third State of the Union address tonight, he will be speak
ing to a nation sharply skeptical of his performance, ac
cording to a new Washington Post-ABC News public
opinion poll.
Reagan's popularity rating is his lowest in Post-ABC
News polls. For the first time a majority expressed little
or no confidence that his program will lead to improve
ment of the economy. A majority also said Reagan has
gone too far in increasing military spending while cutting
back social programs.
Even Reagan's income tax cuts and success in reducing
the official rate of inflation are discounted. Four of five
people polled said the cuts in tax rates have so far made
little or no difference in the amount of tax they pay, and a
majority said inflation is more of a problem than it was a
year ago.
A majority of Americans, 54 percent, disapproves of
his overall handling of the presidency. Only 42 percent
approve of his performance, a striking shift since Octo
ber, when the president was given a 49-to-44 pcrcent fa
vorable rating. Reagan has lost support across the board,
from Republicans, Democrats and independents.
Court considers busing, death penalty
Washington — The Supreme Court yesterday unani
mously turned down a Department of Justice request that
it re-examine its landmark 1971 decision allowing courts
to order busing to achieve school desegregation and also
temporarily blocked the execution of a convicted Texas
murderer. At the same time, the court said it would con
sider on an emergency basis how the courts should handle
all such last-minute death penalty appeals.
The justices left in effect a decision by the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Sixth Circuit in Cincinnati requiring the
Nashville, Tennessee, public schools to continue to use
busing in order to desegregate the entire school system.
The appeals court found that Nashville has not yet over
come the separation of the races caused when the school
system was segregated by law three decades ago.

The Supreme Court's action in refusing to hear the
Nashville case does not set a precedent or change the law
regarding the need for busing. But it indicates that the
justices are, at least for now, unwilling to retreat from
their prior decisions on court-ordered busing.
The decision on the death penalty appeal, which could
delay all executions scheduled for the next few months,
comes amid charges from opponents of capital pun
ishment that state officials and appeals court judges have
begun rushing executions without giving defendants a
full chance to present their pleas. More than 1100 people
nationwide are on death row.
Thomas Barefoot, 37, was convicted in the August
1978 shooting death of police officer Carl Levin, the
father of five, who had been questioning him in connec
tion with a nightclub fire in Harker Heights, Texas. Pros
ecutors said Barefoot was a fugitive and shot Levin to
avoid arrest.
Barefoot unsuccessfully sought a stay of execution and
a full appeal at the sth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals,
based in New Orleans. When that was denied without full
arguments and briefs on the grounds that his plea lacked
legal merit, his lawyers went to the Supreme Court.
Yesterday, the Supreme Court said it would review
"the appropriate standard for granting or denying a stay
of execution" in such circumstances as well as Barefoot's
challenge on the use of psychiatric testimony in his sen
tencing. Expediting its procedures, the court scheduled
oral arguments for April 26. Normally, it would have
heard the case next fall.
Possible MX tests protested
Vandenberg Air Force Base, Calif. — Anti-nuclear
demonstrators tried to block the main gate at this poten
tial MX missile test site today and about 100 of them were
promptly arrested.
Military police, backed up by California Highway Pa
trol officers and county sheriffs deputies, arrested pro
testers who either tried to block the gate or crossed onto
the base over a boundary wire.
About 300 demonstrators showed up to protest pos
sible future MX missile tests at the base, located 130 miles
northwest of Los Angeles. Many of the 300, however,
said they did not plan to obstruct the gate or enter the
base.
The demonstrators had intended to prevent workers
from getting to their jobs, but most base employees ar
rived long before the protesters tried to block the gate at
7:30 a.m.
"Get a job!" one emplovee yelled at the demonstrators
Fierce storms ravage country
At least 28 deaths have been blamed on the violent
weather that began last Thursday with an ice storm that
turned out the lights in more than 170,000 homes in the
South while a train of Pacific storms rumbling across Cal
ifornia with 70 mph winds and heavy rains sent mudslides
tumbling across highways yesterday as thousands of peo
ple lost power and many fled their flooded homes.
Fresh snow waist deep in the Sierra Nevada blocked
mountain routes and 15-foot waves pounded the beaches
of Southern California.
On the other side of the country, a coat of ice and heavy
fog hampered travel in much of New England and up
state New York.
Down South, residents of Key West, Florida, were
drying out from a weekend deluge of 12 inches of rain
that one police dispatcher described as "like a hur
ricane."
Winter storm warnings were posted in northeastern
California and the Lake Tahoe basin of western Nevada.

Snow also was scattered from northeast Montana across
North Dakota, northern Minnesota and the upper Great
Lakes region.
About 16 inches of snow fell during the night on In
terstate 80 at Donner Pass in California and three other
major roads across the Sierra were closed, including Cali
fornia Highway 70 through Feather River Canyon,
which was blocked by a snowslide.
Forecasters in California said the storm was the second
of four expected to hit the coast before the week is out.
Highway crews worked to keep the Pacific Coast High
way open between Malibu and Santa Monica, just up the
coast from Los Angeles, but the slides closed the Malibu
Canvon-Los Virgenes Road which connects with the
Veniura Freeway.
More than 80 people evacuated their homes in
Northern California, including 50 from an apartment
complex near San Jose. One vacant house tumbled down
a hillside at Oakland, and 5000 commuters were without
a train ride because of washouts on the Southern Pacific
Railroad between San Jose and San Francisco.
Market plummets
New York — The stock market took its sharpest drop
in three months yesterday, faced with worries about the
oil-price outlook and rising interest rates.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 22.81 to
1030.17, for its biggest one-day drop since it tumbled a
near-record 36.33 points last Oct. 25. In the last two ses
sions, the average has lost more than 40 points.
Today's weather
Increasing clouds today with a chance of light showers.
Rain beginning tonight with locally heavy rain late to
night or tomorrow. Increasing southerly winds tonight
and tomorrow morning. Tonight, lows from 50 to 57 and
highs between 58 and 66. Chance of measurable rain in
creasing to 40 percent today, then 80 percent tonight.

No agreement reached at OPEC meeting
Geneva, Switzerland — An emergency OPEC meeting col
lapsed yesterday in disagreement over production quotas — a
failure that could force down oil prices and prolong a worldwide
glut.
OPEC did not change its base price of $34 per barrel, several
ministers said.
"We could not agree on anything at all," said Mana Saeed
Oteiba, the oil minister of the United Arab Emirates.
Some oil ministers said there was a consensus that the Or
ganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries drop its overall
production ceiling bv I million barrels daily to 17.5 million,
about the current level of production by the 13 OPEC members.
But Oteiba and Saudi Arabian Oil Minister Ahmed Zaki
Yamani said there was no agreement on any point.
Yamani said the meeting was "a complete failure."
The possibility was left open that Saudi Arabia could

Possible MX tests protested
Vandenberg Air Force Base, Calif. — Anti-nuclear
demonstrators tried to block the main gate at this poten
tial MX missile test site today and about 100 of them were
promptly arrested.
Military police, backed up by California Highway Pa
trol officers and county sheriffs deputies, arrested pro
testers who either tried to block the gate or crossed onto
the base over a boundary wire.
About 300 demonstrators showed up to protest pos
sible future MX missile tests at the base, located 130 miles
northwest of Los Angeles. Many of the 300, however,
said they did not plan to obstruct the gate or enter the
base.
The demonstrators had intended to prevent workers
from getting to their jobs, but most base employees ar
rived long before the protesters tried to block the gate at
7:30 a.m.
"Get a job!" one emplovee yelled at the demonstrators
Fierce storms ravage country
At least 28 deaths have been blamed on the violent
weather that began last Thursday with an ice storm that
turned out the lights in more than 170,000 homes in the
South while a train of Pacific storms rumbling across Cal
ifornia with 70 mph winds and heavy rains sent mudslides
tumbling across highways yesterday as thousands of peo
ple lost power and many fled their flooded homes.
Fresh snow waist deep in the Sierra Nevada blocked
mountain routes and 15-foot waves pounded the beaches
of Southern California.
On the other side of the country, a coat of ice and heavy
fog hampered travel in much of New England and up
state New York.
Down South, residents of Key West, Florida, were
drying out from a weekend deluge of 12 inches of rain
that one police dispatcher described as "like a hur
ricane."
Winter storm warnings were posted in northeastern
California and the Lake Tahoe basin of western Nevada.

Snow also was scattered from northeast Montana across
North Dakota, northern Minnesota and the upper Great
Lakes region.
About 16 inches of snow fell during the night on In
terstate 80 at Donner Pass in California and three other
major roads across the Sierra were closed, including Cali
fornia Highway 70 through Feather River Canyon,
which was blocked by a snowslide.
Forecasters in California said the storm was the second
of four expected to hit the coast before the week is out.
Highway crews worked to keep the Pacific Coast High
way open between Malibu and Santa Monica, just up the
coast from Los Angeles, but the slides closed the Malibu
Canvon-Los Virgenes Road which connects with the
Veniura Freeway.
More than 80 people evacuated their homes in
Northern California, including 50 from an apartment
complex near San Jose. One vacant house tumbled down
a hillside at Oakland, and 5000 commuters were without
a train ride because of washouts on the Southern Pacific
Railroad between San Jose and San Francisco.
Market plummets
New York — The stock market took its sharpest drop
in three months yesterday, faced with worries about the
oil-price outlook and rising interest rates.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 22.81 to
1030.17, for its biggest one-day drop since it tumbled a
near-record 36.33 points last Oct. 25. In the last two ses
sions, the average has lost more than 40 points.
Today's weather
Increasing clouds today with a chance of light showers.
Rain beginning tonight with locally heavy rain late to

and tomorrow morning. Tonight, lows from 50 to 57 and
highs between 58 and 66. Chance of measurable rain in
creasing to 40 percent today, then 80 percent tonight.

No agreement reached at OPEC meeting
Geneva, Switzerland — An emergency OPEC meeting col
lapsed yesterday in disagreement over production quotas — a
failure that could force down oil prices and prolong a worldwide
glut.
OPEC did not change its base price of $34 per barrel, several
ministers said.
"We could not agree on anything at all," said Mana Saeed
Oteiba, the oil minister of the United Arab Emirates.
Some oil ministers said there was a consensus that the Or
ganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries drop its overall
production ceiling bv I million barrels daily to 17.5 million,
about the current level of production by the 13 OPEC members.
But Oteiba and Saudi Arabian Oil Minister Ahmed Zaki
Yamani said there was no agreement on any point.
Yamani said the meeting was "a complete failure."
The possibility was left open that Saudi Arabia could
carry out its implied threat to reduce its price if there was
no agreement, which could touch off a series of price cuts
around the world and undermine OPEC's already erod
ing power over prices.
Oteiba was quoted by the Gulf News Agency in
Bahrain as declaring that Persian Gulf oil-producers
were "now free to decide what they deem suitable for the
protection of their interests."
Yamani said Saudi Arabia would not cut the Saudi
price without consent of other cartel members.
"We don't want to start a price war," he said.
International bankers fear that a sudden and large
drop in prices could lead to default on billions of dollars
of loans to countries such as Mexico and Venezuela
which depend on oil sales for national income.
Mexico exports 1.5 million barrels a day, so every price
drop of $ 1 would cost Mexico $1.5 million a day at a time
when the country is struggling through its worst econom
ic crisis and trying to pay off an $80 billion foreign debt.
Mexican oil officials had no immediate comment on
the meeting.
Other economists say it also would mean an improve
ment of conditions for importing nations, such as Brazil.
It also would mean lower prices for gasoline and other
products made from crude oil.
Reagan drops in popularity polls
Washington — When President Reagan delivers his
third State of the Union address tonight, he will be speak
ing to a nation sharply skeptical of his performance, ac
cording to a new Washington Post-ABC News public
opinion poll.
Reagan's popularity rating is his lowest in Post-ABC
News polls. For the first time a majority expressed little
or no confidence that his program will lead to improve
ment of the economy. A majority also said Reagan has
gone too far in increasing military spending while cutting
back social programs.
Even Reagan's income tax cuts and success in reducing
the official rate of inflation are discounted. Four of five
people polled said the cuts in tax rates have so far made
little or no difference in the amount of tax they pay, and a
majority said inflation is more of a problem than it was a
year ago.
A majority of Americans, 54 percent, disapproves of
his overall handling of the presidency. Only 42 percent
approve of his performance, a striking shift since Octo
ber, when the president was given a 49-to-44 pcrcent fa
vorable rating. Reagan has lost support across the board,
from Republicans, Democrats and independents.
Court considers busing, death penalty
Washington — The Supreme Court yesterday unani
mously turned down a Department of Justice request that
it re-examine its landmark 1971 decision allowing courts
to order busing to achieve school desegregation and also
temporarily blocked the execution of a convicted Texas
murderer. At the same time, the court said it would con
sider on an emergency basis how the courts should handle
all such last-minute death penalty appeals.
The justices left in effect a decision by the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Sixth Circuit in Cincinnati requiring the
Nashville, Tennessee, public schools to continue to use
busing in order to desegregate the entire school system.
The appeals court found that Nashville has not yet over
come the separation of the races caused when the school
system was segregated by law three decades ago.

The Supreme Court's action in refusing to hear the
Nashville case does not set a precedent or change the law
regarding the need for busing. But it indicates that the
justices are, at least for now, unwilling to retreat from
their prior decisions on court-ordered busing.
The decision on the death penalty appeal, which could
delay all executions scheduled for the next few months,
comes amid charges from opponents of capital pun
ishment that state officials and appeals court judges have
begun rushing executions without giving defendants a
full chance to present their pleas. More than 1100 people
nationwide are on death row.
Thomas Barefoot, 37, was convicted in the August
1978 shooting death of police officer Carl Levin, the
father of five, who had been questioning him in connec
tion with a nightclub fire in Harker Heights, Texas. Pros
ecutors said Barefoot was a fugitive and shot Levin to
avoid arrest.
Barefoot unsuccessfully sought a stay of execution and
a full appeal at the sth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals,
based in New Orleans. When that was denied without full
arguments and briefs on the grounds that his plea lacked
legal merit, his lawyers went to the Supreme Court.
Yesterday, the Supreme Court said it would review
"the appropriate standard for granting or denying a stay
of execution" in such circumstances as well as Barefoot's
challenge on the use of psychiatric testimony in his sen
tencing. Expediting its procedures, the court scheduled
oral arguments for April 26. Normally, it would have
heard the case next fall.

around the world and undermine OPEC's already erod
ing power over prices.
Oteiba was quoted by the Gulf News Agency in
Bahrain as declaring that Persian Gulf oil-producers
were "now free to decide what they deem suitable for the
protection of their interests."
Yamani said Saudi Arabia would not cut the Saudi
price without consent of other cartel members.
"We don't want to start a price war," he said.
International bankers fear that a sudden and large
drop in prices could lead to default on billions of dollars
of loans to countries such as Mexico and Venezuela
which depend on oil sales for national income.
Mexico exports 1.5 million barrels a day, so every price
drop of $ 1 would cost Mexico $1.5 million a day at a time
when the country is struggling through its worst econom
ic crisis and trying to pay off an $80 billion foreign debt.
Mexican oil officials had no immediate comment on
the meeting.
Other economists say it also would mean an improve
ment of conditions for importing nations, such as Brazil.
It also would mean lower prices for gasoline and other
products made from crude oil.
Reagan drops in popularity polls
Washington — When President Reagan delivers his
third State of the Union address tonight, he will be speak
ing to a nation sharply skeptical of his performance, ac
cording to a new Washington Post-ABC News public
opinion poll.
Reagan's popularity rating is his lowest in Post-ABC
News polls. For the first time a majority expressed little
or no confidence that his program will lead to improve
ment of the economy. A majority also said Reagan has
gone too far in increasing military spending while cutting
back social programs.
Even Reagan's income tax cuts and success in reducing
the official rate of inflation are discounted. Four of five
people polled said the cuts in tax rates have so far made
little or no difference in the amount of tax they pay, and a
majority said inflation is more of a problem than it was a
year ago.
A majority of Americans, 54 percent, disapproves of
his overall handling of the presidency. Only 42 percent
approve of his performance, a striking shift since Octo
ber, when the president was given a 49-to-44 pcrcent fa
vorable rating. Reagan has lost support across the board,
from Republicans, Democrats and independents.
Court considers busing, death penalty
Washington — The Supreme Court yesterday unani
mously turned down a Department of Justice request that
it re-examine its landmark 1971 decision allowing courts
to order busing to achieve school desegregation and also
temporarily blocked the execution of a convicted Texas
murderer. At the same time, the court said it would con
sider on an emergency basis how the courts should handle
all such last-minute death penalty appeals.
The justices left in effect a decision by the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Sixth Circuit in Cincinnati requiring the
Nashville, Tennessee, public schools to continue to use
busing in order to desegregate the entire school system.
The appeals court found that Nashville has not yet over
come the separation of the races caused when the school
system was segregated by law three decades ago.

The Supreme Court's action in refusing to hear the
Nashville case does not set a precedent or change the law
regarding the need for busing. But it indicates that the
justices are, at least for now, unwilling to retreat from
their prior decisions on court-ordered busing.
The decision on the death penalty appeal, which could
delay all executions scheduled for the next few months,
comes amid charges from opponents of capital pun
ishment that state officials and appeals court judges have
begun rushing executions without giving defendants a
full chance to present their pleas. More than 1100 people
nationwide are on death row.
Thomas Barefoot, 37, was convicted in the August
1978 shooting death of police officer Carl Levin, the
father of five, who had been questioning him in connec
tion with a nightclub fire in Harker Heights, Texas. Pros
ecutors said Barefoot was a fugitive and shot Levin to
avoid arrest.
Barefoot unsuccessfully sought a stay of execution and
a full appeal at the sth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals,
based in New Orleans. When that was denied without full
arguments and briefs on the grounds that his plea lacked
legal merit, his lawyers went to the Supreme Court.
Yesterday, the Supreme Court said it would review
"the appropriate standard for granting or denying a stay
of execution" in such circumstances as well as Barefoot's
challenge on the use of psychiatric testimony in his sen
tencing. Expediting its procedures, the court scheduled
oral arguments for April 26. Normally, it would have
heard the case next fall.
Possible MX tests protested
Vandenberg Air Force Base, Calif. — Anti-nuclear
demonstrators tried to block the main gate at this poten
tial MX missile test site today and about 100 of them were
promptly arrested.
Military police, backed up by California Highway Pa
trol officers and county sheriffs deputies, arrested pro
testers who either tried to block the gate or crossed onto
the base over a boundary wire.
About 300 demonstrators showed up to protest pos
sible future MX missile tests at the base, located 130 miles
northwest of Los Angeles. Many of the 300, however,
said they did not plan to obstruct the gate or enter the
base.
The demonstrators had intended to prevent workers
from getting to their jobs, but most base employees ar
rived long before the protesters tried to block the gate at
7:30 a.m.
"Get a job!" one emplovee yelled at the demonstrators
Fierce storms ravage country
At least 28 deaths have been blamed on the violent
weather that began last Thursday with an ice storm that
turned out the lights in more than 170,000 homes in the
South while a train of Pacific storms rumbling across Cal
ifornia with 70 mph winds and heavy rains sent mudslides
tumbling across highways yesterday as thousands of peo
ple lost power and many fled their flooded homes.
Fresh snow waist deep in the Sierra Nevada blocked
mountain routes and 15-foot waves pounded the beaches
of Southern California.
On the other side of the country, a coat of ice and heavy
fog hampered travel in much of New England and up
state New York.
Down South, residents of Key West, Florida, were
drying out from a weekend deluge of 12 inches of rain
that one police dispatcher described as "like a hur
ricane."
Winter storm warnings were posted in northeastern
California and the Lake Tahoe basin of western Nevada.

Snow also was scattered from northeast Montana across
North Dakota, northern Minnesota and the upper Great
Lakes region.
About 16 inches of snow fell during the night on In
terstate 80 at Donner Pass in California and three other
major roads across the Sierra were closed, including Cali
fornia Highway 70 through Feather River Canyon,
which was blocked by a snowslide.
Forecasters in California said the storm was the second
of four expected to hit the coast before the week is out.
Highway crews worked to keep the Pacific Coast High
way open between Malibu and Santa Monica, just up the
coast from Los Angeles, but the slides closed the Malibu
Canvon-Los Virgenes Road which connects with the
Veniura Freeway.
More than 80 people evacuated their homes in
Northern California, including 50 from an apartment
complex near San Jose. One vacant house tumbled down
a hillside at Oakland, and 5000 commuters were without
a train ride because of washouts on the Southern Pacific
Railroad between San Jose and San Francisco.
Market plummets
New York — The stock market took its sharpest drop
in three months yesterday, faced with worries about the
oil-price outlook and rising interest rates.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 22.81 to
1030.17, for its biggest one-day drop since it tumbled a
near-record 36.33 points last Oct. 25. In the last two ses
sions, the average has lost more than 40 points.
Today's weather
Increasing clouds today with a chance of light showers.
Rain beginning tonight with locally heavy rain late to
night or tomorrow. Increasing southerly winds tonight
and tomorrow morning. Tonight, lows from 50 to 57 and
highs between 58 and 66. Chance of measurable rain in
creasing to 40 percent today, then 80 percent tonight.

No agreement reached at OPEC meeting
Geneva, Switzerland — An emergency OPEC meeting col
lapsed yesterday in disagreement over production quotas — a
failure that could force down oil prices and prolong a worldwide
glut.
OPEC did not change its base price of $34 per barrel, several
ministers said.
"We could not agree on anything at all," said Mana Saeed
Oteiba, the oil minister of the United Arab Emirates.
Some oil ministers said there was a consensus that the Or
ganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries drop its overall
production ceiling bv I million barrels daily to 17.5 million,
about the current level of production by the 13 OPEC members.
But Oteiba and Saudi Arabian Oil Minister Ahmed Zaki
Yamani said there was no agreement on any point.
