# Reagan aid/registration link criticized

### KEVIN GROSS Staff writer 
University administrators and
students are critical of regula
tions proposed by the Reagan
administration Friday that would
tie the receipt of federally
funded financial aid for male col
lege students to draft registration
requirements.
Under the Reagan plan, which
is scheduled to take effect in
May, male college students
would have to show proof that
they have complied with draft
registration before receiving aid.
Currently, the University is in
the process of establishing a pol
icy to determine what it will do in
response to the proposed regula
tions, said Robert Huff, director
of financial aids. Since the offi
cial regulations won't be pub
lished in the federal register until
next week, administrators have
not yet had a chance to review

them.
It is likely, however, that the
regulations will require in
creased administrative costs to
be borne by the University. Ac
cording to Huff, "1 don't think
there is any question that it will
create an administrative incon
venience," Huff said.
When asked if he felt that the
new law might discriminate
against students who rely heavily
on federal money, Huff re
sponded that, "There is no ques
tion in my mind that this is a dis
criminatory regulation against
young males, especially low
income males."
The new regulations, which
will be administered by the De
partment of Education and the
Selective Service Administra
tion, are the result of Congres
sional legislation passed last
July, in a little publicized rider
tacked onto the $177.1 billion

1983 Defense Authorization
Bill.
At that time last summer, both
University President Donald
Kennedy and University Vice-
President of Public Relations
Bob Rosenzweig made several
public statements criticizing the
proposed regulations.
Rosenzweig, who is leaving
Friday for a new job in Washing
ton, said that "Universities
ought not to be the instrument to
enforce draft registration." By
doing so. the government "puts
the University in a position
where it becomes an adversary to
its students," he said.
Among those who disagree
with the current draft registra
tion laws is Hoover Senior Re
search Fellow Martin Anderson,
who characterized the proposed
regulations as a "classic example
of why we shouldn't have draft
registration." Anderson was

formerly the chief domestic pol
icy advisor in the Reagan admin
istration.
Although Anderson said that
it was likely the new rules for
financial aid would cause an ad
ditional amount of registration,
he cited the rules as proof that
the government will keep need
ing more programs to enforce
compliance with the registration
laws.
"Some people who are in a po
sition in Washington tend to be
lieve that if you have draft regis
tration, you will solve your ready
manpower problems," said An
derson. "But a strong all
volunteer-force is a better solu
tion. I think that registration is
unnecessary," he said.
Meanwhile, a spokesman for
the Air Force recruiting office in
San Jose said that the Air Force
was meeting their recruitment
quotas, and even turning people

away.
Colonel Barton, of the Air
Force ROTC program at San
Jose State University, said that
ROTC students are also re
quired to register under current
selective service law.
"Those people seeking to
serve their country will come in
anyway. I don't see that as pro
ducing more people," said Bar
ton, who felt the proposed regu
lations would have little effect on
recruitment.
Selective Service Administra
tion (SSA) officials were unsure
of the impact that the new regu
lations would have in increasing
awareness and compliance with
registration laws.
Figures obtained yesterday
from the SSA's region five office
in San Francisco show that regis
tration among those born from
1960 to 1963 is at 90 percent in
California â€” slightly below the
nationwide average of 95 per
cent reported by the Reagan
administration last year.
According to SSA official
Barbara McConaghy of the San
Francisco office, the regulations
were designed to make young
men aware, "that when they're
going into college, they have that
responsibility (to register)."
McConaghy added, "If they
don't want to do something for
their country, their country
doesn't want to do anything for
them .. . the regulations are just
another penalty if they don't re
gister. A monetary penalty, as
well as a legal penalty . . . We
intend to show that registration
is a serious thing. It's not a
game."
Sushma Govindarajulu, a
coordinator of Stanford Against
Conscription (SAC), disagrees.
She said their figures show that
there is only 60 percent registra
tion compliance among 18
year-olds nationwide, and that
there are "quite a few people at
Stanford" who haven't regis
tered.
"It's a very discriminatory en
forcement," she said, referring
to the new regulations. "We will
ask the University to submit
statements to comment on the
regulations." By law, proposed
regulations are published in the
Federal Register and individuals
and organizatins are allowed to
comment on them for 30 days.
The comments are then taken
into consideration by the agency
proposing the regulations.
