### LISA LYNCH Staff writer 
A member of the political
branch of the organization carry
ing on a revolution against the
government of El Salvador at
tacked the Reagan administra
tion's decision to continue aid to
that nation's government accus
ing the U.S. of, "giving a lot of
money so the government of El
Salvador can kill people."
Armado Armene, a former El
Salvadoran economist and
Christian Democrat is now in
volved in the political
diploinatic commission of the
FDR-FMLN, the political and
military arms of the revolutio
nary organization in El Salvador.
He spoke here yesterday at
CERAS in a special event spon
sored by the Center for Latin
American Studies.
Armene strongly condemned
the decision Reagan made last
Friday to certify continued
human rights improvement in El
Salvador. "There is an objective
interest for the people of the
United States to become in
volved in our conflict," he said.
Armene said that there was
one advantage to the certifica
tion program â€” it made Ameri

cans aware of the problems in El
Salvador and the corruption
within their own government.
"The only way for Reagan to
certify (human rights improve
ment) is to lie," Armene ex
plained. He claimed that if the
U.S. withdrew military aid from
El Salvador, the situation would
improve and not worsen as the
State Department claims. "Sus
pension of military aid is neces
sary for the government to be
willing to talk to us," he said.
The position of the FDR
FMLN, according to Armene, is
that only through agrarian re
form and national democracy
can the country's ills be al
leviated. He asserted that the El
Salvador government, despite
the claims of the U.S. govern
ment, has never been interested
in such a program.
Armene said that at present
there were two factions to the El
Salvadoran government. "The
repressive-regressive side is
headed by General Roberto
D'Aubisson, who has been
called 'a pathological killer by
former El Salvador Ambassador
Robert White," he explained.
