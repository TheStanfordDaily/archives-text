Although it dumped almost
three-and-a-half inches of rain
on the Bay Area by last night, the
weekend's storm caused only
minimal damage to the Stanford
area.
According to the U.S. Wea
ther Service station at the San
Francisco International Airport,
the Bay Area received a total of
3.43 inches of rain and wind
gusts up to 52 m.p.h.
The storm was only one in a
series of storms that will hit the
area approximately every 4H
hours between now and the end

of the month, said Duty Weather
Specialist Thornton Jeffries.
Due to the large amount of
rainfall, flooding was the major
problem on campus. "The
amount of water coming down
simply exceeded the (drainage)
systems' capacities," explained
James Horgan, director of Uni
versity Operations and Mainte
nance.
Eight crewmen worked
through the night Sunday to an
swer 33 calls for assistance, Hor
gan said.
Drains backed up in Hoover
Tower, causing some carpet
damage. They also backed up in

Cubberley Auditorium, the
Mudd Chemistry Building and a
photography lab in the Art
Building.
Although Operations and
Maintenance crews empty the
downspouts on all buildings
every two weeks during the rainy
season, Sunday's high winds
blew more leaves into the drain
age systems, causing problems at
Lagunita and Crothers Memo
rial dorms.
Students also reported flood
ing in Wilbur's basement, forcing
them to wade through six inches
of water to do their laundry.
