# 'I have a dream....'
## 
### 
Fifteen years ago, the dream was a visionary one of
cultural awareness and equal opportunity for all.
But when an assassin shot Martin Luther King on
April 4, 1968, the climate here and throughout the na
tion was violent, turbulent, emotionally charged.
Citizens launched protest marches in Washington, and
students here voiced forceful demands to the University
administration.
We do not want to reminisce about the political ac
tivism of the late '60s and early '70s, nor do we seek to
pass judgment on University policies or student at
titudes. But we do hope this issue of The Stanford Daily
Magazine stirs some thought in what many see as an
apathetic community here today.
A number of people deserve credit for helping to put
together this magazine and for giving ideas and moral
support: Richard Klingler and Douglas Jehl for giving us
the go-ahead, Dan Spiegelman and Tom Nelson for
giving us the pages, Tony Kelly for providing the cover
and graphic design, photo and the back-shop for "being
patient and Adam Goodman and Heather Millar for
sharing some of the most talented, enthusiastic writers
on campus with us.
And for the hundreds of people who will undoubtedly
call the Daily today, asking, "Where's the DailyT â€”
this is it!
