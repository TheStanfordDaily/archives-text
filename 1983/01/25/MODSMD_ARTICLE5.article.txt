# Obstacles impede affirmative action policies
## 
### JEFF BIDDULPH KAREN SPRINGEN 
The University has responded to
many minority demands since the
mid-1960s when officials first
discussed increasing the number of
"Negroes" and other minorities on
campus....

JL he struggle to improve the University's minor
ity relations since the 1960s has resembled Sisyphus'
struggle to push boulders uphill. The gods ordered
Sisyphus to push heavy stones up a hill for eternity, but
the boulders continuously tumbled down.
Each time the University accomplishes one task in its
effort to improve policy and add to cultural conscious
ness, minority relations or affirmative action, another
obstacle surfaces.
I he University has responded to many minority de
mands since the mid-1960s when officials first discussed
increasing the number of "Negroes" and other
minorities on campus, but progress has been slow. Now,
according to Affirmative Action Officer Santiago Rod
riguez, 'this University is basically governed by white
males."
But there has been some level of success. Before 1960
the University had "zero" discussion about minority
issues here, according to Robert Rosenzwcig, vice presi
dent of the Office of Public Affairs.
In 1960 the University received a total of six Chicano,
native American and black undergraduate applications.
It had only "a couple" minority faculty members in
1967, according to Rosenzwcig. The percentage of
minority faculty has increased from 4.1 percent in 1972
to 6.75 percent in 1982.
Still, Anthropology Prof. James Gibbs and other fac
ulty members claim the University must work to increase
the percentage of tenured faculty members who are
minorities. In fact, the percentage of black tenured fac
ulty has declined from 2 percent in 1973 to 1.82 percent
in 1982. Three of the University's seven schools have no
black professors, and the University no longer has any
native American faculty members. The University has
not had a minority as a high-level administrator since
Gibbs served as dean of undergraduate studies in the
19705.
Another problem stems from whom the University
considers minorities. Many students feel that University
administrators, because they feel that Asian-Americans
are not underrepresented, use the percentage of Orien
tals here to boost figures only when it improves the
University's image. The University does not officially
consider Asian-American students minorities, despite
the fact that they have many cultural differences.
It seems that the University's struggle to improve its
minority relations has reached a plateau. Apathy — on
the part of the University and many students — has
stalled accomplishments, many of which were the result
of sometimes-violent activism.
The civil rights era, begun by the Civil Rights Act in
1964 and an executive order in 1972 which demanded
affirmative action policies if the University were to re
ceive federal funds, contributed to the tremendous
evolution of the minority situation here.
Through protest speeches and meetings with Univer
sity administrators, the Black Student Union and radical
white groups spurred a situation in the late' 60s and early
'70s in which the University feverishly hired minority
faculty and admitted minority students. After 1970 the
University instituted theme houses and cultural centers.
Despite these tangible gains for minorities, several
questions remain: Will the University continue support
ing theme houses in their present form? The University
is questioning the merit of theme houses because of
segregation charges and the low desirability of these
houses in last spring's draw. And has the University
reached a plateau in minority faculty hiring — and in
ensuring that faculty, once recruited, receive tenure?
"The problem is increasing the number of people in
the pool of graduate students," Rosenzweig said. "Job
opportunities have diminished, so the brightest
graduates go to law or business school — not into Ph.D.
programs."
Much has changed since the late '60s. both in student
awareriess and policy direction. Minorities have been
integrated into campus life at a rapid pace. Black frater
nities and sororities, Chicano business societies, black
pre-law societies, theme houses and an affirmative ac
tion office now exist where none existed before.
But still the image of Sisyphus returns. Will the Uni
versity continue to push the boulders, will it decide that
they can't be pushed or will it decide to let them roll
down the hill unhampered?



Martin Luther King, who spoke here April 14,1967, said black power and riots may be the results of "white
backlash" Instead of Its cause. "We may have to repent In this generation not for the violent actions of bad
people but for the Inaction of good people who have the notion that time will cure all evil."

JL he struggle to improve the University's minor
ity relations since the 1960s has resembled Sisyphus'
struggle to push boulders uphill. The gods ordered
Sisyphus to push heavy stones up a hill for eternity, but
the boulders continuously tumbled down.
Each time the University accomplishes one task in its
effort to improve policy and add to cultural conscious
ness, minority relations or affirmative action, another
obstacle surfaces.
I he University has responded to many minority de
mands since the mid-1960s when officials first discussed
increasing the number of "Negroes" and other
minorities on campus, but progress has been slow. Now,
according to Affirmative Action Officer Santiago Rod
riguez, 'this University is basically governed by white
males."
But there has been some level of success. Before 1960
the University had "zero" discussion about minority
issues here, according to Robert Rosenzwcig, vice presi
dent of the Office of Public Affairs.
In 1960 the University received a total of six Chicano,
native American and black undergraduate applications.
It had only "a couple" minority faculty members in
1967, according to Rosenzwcig. The percentage of
minority faculty has increased from 4.1 percent in 1972
to 6.75 percent in 1982.
Still, Anthropology Prof. James Gibbs and other fac
ulty members claim the University must work to increase
the percentage of tenured faculty members who are
minorities. In fact, the percentage of black tenured fac
ulty has declined from 2 percent in 1973 to 1.82 percent
in 1982. Three of the University's seven schools have no
black professors, and the University no longer has any
native American faculty members. The University has
not had a minority as a high-level administrator since
Gibbs served as dean of undergraduate studies in the
19705.
Another problem stems from whom the University
considers minorities. Many students feel that University
administrators, because they feel that Asian-Americans
are not underrepresented, use the percentage of Orien
tals here to boost figures only when it improves the
University's image. The University does not officially
consider Asian-American students minorities, despite
the fact that they have many cultural differences.
It seems that the University's struggle to improve its
minority relations has reached a plateau. Apathy — on
the part of the University and many students — has
stalled accomplishments, many of which were the result
of sometimes-violent activism.
The civil rights era, begun by the Civil Rights Act in
1964 and an executive order in 1972 which demanded
affirmative action policies if the University were to re
ceive federal funds, contributed to the tremendous
evolution of the minority situation here.
Through protest speeches and meetings with Univer
sity administrators, the Black Student Union and radical
white groups spurred a situation in the late' 60s and early
'70s in which the University feverishly hired minority
faculty and admitted minority students. After 1970 the
University instituted theme houses and cultural centers.
Despite these tangible gains for minorities, several
questions remain: Will the University continue support
ing theme houses in their present form? The University
is questioning the merit of theme houses because of
segregation charges and the low desirability of these
houses in last spring's draw. And has the University
reached a plateau in minority faculty hiring — and in
ensuring that faculty, once recruited, receive tenure?
"The problem is increasing the number of people in
the pool of graduate students," Rosenzweig said. "Job
opportunities have diminished, so the brightest
graduates go to law or business school — not into Ph.D.
programs."
Much has changed since the late '60s. both in student
awareriess and policy direction. Minorities have been
integrated into campus life at a rapid pace. Black frater
nities and sororities, Chicano business societies, black
pre-law societies, theme houses and an affirmative ac
tion office now exist where none existed before.
But still the image of Sisyphus returns. Will the Uni
versity continue to push the boulders, will it decide that
they can't be pushed or will it decide to let them roll
down the hill unhampered?



Martin Luther King, who spoke here April 14,1967, said black power and riots may be the results of "white
backlash" Instead of Its cause. "We may have to repent In this generation not for the violent actions of bad
people but for the Inaction of good people who have the notion that time will cure all evil."
