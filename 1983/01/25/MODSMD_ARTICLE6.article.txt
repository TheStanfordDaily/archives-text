don't want to see your white faces. 1 don't
want to talk to you. You killed Martin Luther King, you,
people in front of me!"
Dolores Mack, a black activist, stepped down from the
microphone after addressing the crowd of over 100
whites and about 40 blacks, split into separate groups in
front of her. It was a few days after Martin Luther King, a
leader in the civil rights struggle and a preacher of non
violence, had been shot in the neck by a white man.
An Italian student went to the podium and questioned
why, during a rally of solidarity, the whites and blacks
were segregated. He invited the whites to cross over and
stand with the blacks, which they attempted to do.
Another black student seized the microphone and
shouted at the white people starting to move to "get your
mother fucking buns back on your side." The white
students stopped. "We'll tell you when we need you,"
the black student said.
The above scene, which took place on the Stanford
campus nearly 15 years ago, is not seen here today.
King's legacy has left us with relatively harmonious
relations between the races, but his assassination on
April 4, 1968, caused a tumult which shook the founda
tions of the University, bringing about the establishment
of the affirmative action program and causing funda
mental changes in administrators' attitudes about minor
ity issues.
Ten days after King's shooting, students began chal
lenging University policy toward minorties. Their ac
tions touched off a reactive student movement here
which would overshadow all campus events for the next
five years.
Spearheading the minority reform movement was the
Black Student Union (BSU), headed by student Ken

Washington. Through protests, demands and highly
publicized meetings, Washington called on the Univer
sity to change its attitude towards all minority students.
Events began on April 8, four days after King's assas
sination. Richard Lyman, then provost of the University,
announced an all-day colloquium entitled "Colloquium
and Plan for Action: Stanford's Response to White Ra
cism." Many classes were cancelled so that students
could attend the numerous films, lectures and discus
sions. The events, held in Memorial Auditorium, were
designed to educate students on the dangers of racism, as
well as to explore the University's responsibility in such
issues.
During Lyman's colloquium speech on the Memorial
Auditorium stage, 70 black students, led by Washington,
surrounded the provost. The students proceeded to read
a long list of demands regarding black admissions and
the role of minorities at the University. Washington,
who shouted at the stunned audience of 1700 people,
asked Lyman to reply to the demands by 7 p.m. on April
9 at an open meeting at Tresidder.
The BSU had demanded a doubling of minority en
rollment by the 1969-70 school year, doubling of the
proportion of University employees from minority
groups over the next year and the admittance of at least
10 minority students for the next academic year "who
did not meet the minimal academic requirements." The
BSU also called for the dismissal of Robert Rosenzweig,
associate provost for minority affairs, claiming that the
position should go to a minority group member.
After the list was read, Washington challenged the
capacity crowd, declaring "put your money and action
where your mouth is," and walked out of the auditorium,
followed by the other BSU members. He received a
standing ovation.
Student response to the interruption was swift. Ad hoc
groups of differnt races formed and circulated petitions
supporting the BSU demands. The Medical School fac
ulty urged Lyman to accept the proposals, and ASSU
President Cesare Massarenti called a noon rally in White
Plaza for the following day. Otero House in Wilbur Hall
said it would ask that $5000 slated for house im
provements be used to implement the BSU demands.
Seven hours later. University President Wallace Ster
ling issued a statement which pledged "the necessary
resources of time, thought and money," and agreed to
the above three demands. The statement, released at 10
p.m., called on students and faculty alike to work toward
minority rights, but did not commit the University to any
deadlines concerning the demands.
Sterling also cited blacks as "among the prime witnes
ses to racial injustice" and called upon them to work with
the University toward the outlined goals. He overlooked
the disruption of Lyman's speech, and requested that a

five-member commission meet with faculty and staff
members on April 11. Sterling did not promise to meet
with the BSU at Tresidder the next day.
But the next day, following a controversial noon rally,
the University sent Vice Provost Herbert Packer and
other representatives to the meeting, witnessed by
nearly 1000 students. The BSU's list of 10 demands was
discussed for three hours.
The University agreed "in substance" to all except
one of the BSU demands: the dismissal of Rosenzweig.
In addition to a commitment to increase monority en
rollment here, the representatives vowed to increase
minority participation in the selection process as well as
in other University affairs.
Washington emerged from the small room and an
nounced to a crowd of sympathizers that "all of our
demands have been met."
Two hours after the meeting, the Academic Council
unanimously endorsed a $ 1 million program to double
minority enrollment by 1969. Eight days after the mur
der of Martin Luther King in Memphis, the University
had solved its first major conflict with its minority stu
dents.
The 1968 Stanford Quad opened with a 45-page re
capitulation of the tumultuous events of the school year
and attempted to explain why students were feeling dis
satisfied. The text criticized the impersonality of institu
tions like Stanford. Further, citing the apathy of the
1950s generation that accepted war and racism, it said
that students no longer lacked interest in the course and
direction of the University.
For the next two years, the BSU continued to lead the
movement for minority reform here. Relations between
the BSU and the administration varied during this time,
with constant, quiet negotiations taking place. Nine of
the 10 students who did not meet "minimal academic
requirements" were in good academic standing, and the
BSU pressured the University to step up minority admis
sions for "academic underachievers."
Relations between the two groups changed because
the BSU began using violence to voice its demands. In
1969, after a University administrator failed to attend a
meeting scheduled with the BSU because of a misun
derstanding, 15 angry blacks caused more than $1000
worth of damage.
The BSU, however, eventually faded into the back
ground as radical white groups took the forefront of the
student movement. Dissatisfaction with the minority
student situation here gave way to broader concerns,
particularly American involvement in Southeast Asia.
Despite the change in student focus, the Univer
sity continued to work toward meeting many of the de
mands made by the BSU.


On April 8, 1968, four days after an assassin shot Martin Luther King, 70 Black
Student Union members — including D. Keith Naylor, assistant dean In the
graduate division, and Thorn Massey, associate dean of student affairs — sur-

Marshall Schwartz/Daily
rounded then Provost Richard Lyman on the Memorial Auditorium stage to read a
long list of demands on black admissions.
