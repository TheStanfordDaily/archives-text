# Admissions officers push for more minorities

officials here play the minority re
cruiting game and they play to win. But the game does
not have a time-limit, and victory is not readily defined.
Despite their efforts, Stanford admissions deans are
not optimistic about greatly increasing the percentage of
minorities here in the next 10 or 15 years.
The basic components of the undergraduate recruiting
system include searching out possible candidates, send
ing special literature in an attempt to get them to apply
and keeping in touch with them during the admissions
process. Affirmative action on the graduate level is ap
proached in a similar manner, but efforts appear more
extensive, possibly owing to lower percentages of minor
ity students in grad school.
Dean of Undergraduate Admissions Fred Hargadon
said he does not know how many minority students
would be the "perfect" number. But he said, "I can tell
you we're far from it. ..
"It really is a hard long process. You can clearly see
progress over the last 10 years, but I think that we won't
have achieved a point at which we could feel things are
working right for another 15."
Although the Office of Undergraduate Admissions
actively recruits minority students, Hargadon likened
being a member of a minority group to being an excellent
musician or having a good sense of humor.
"Since we do have affirmative action and do believe in
increasing the number of minority students that are en
rolled. . . certainly that's one of the things we take into
consideration, but it's a plus in the way that hundreds of
other things are," Hargadon said.
Students who possess that plus are located through
two main sources: the College Board Search Service and
recruiting trips to high schools.
The University purchases the names and addresses of
7000 to 8000 black, 4000 to 5000 Chicano and 500 to
600 American Indian students who have taken the SAT
in either spring or summer," Hargadon said. "Then we
mail them a special letter in September inviting them to
inquire further into the possibility of applying."
If a student responds, the Office of Undergraduate
Admissions then sends a booklet prepared specially for
his or her minority group.
Asked if the students must receive specified minimum
score to be contacted, Hargadon replied," What we do is
try and get a pretty broad slot from that because. . . we
don't specify individual SAT scores," meaning the ver
bal and math scores are not separated.
However, according to a report written by Hargadon
for the Committee on Admissions and Financial Aids
and reprinted in Campus Report, Nov. 1981, the Univer
sity receives only the names of students who have a
combined score of at least 900 and rank in the top 20
percent of their high school class.
Asked if there are separate statistics on average SAT
scores and GPAs for minority and non-minority stu
dents who enroll here, Hargadon replied, "Not that we
give out."

He said, " We don't do that for any student, you'll
never see anything out of our office. . . no, we just don't
believe that that's a very good way to profile the class."
Minority students would have some of the highest
scores in the class and non-minority students would have
some of the lowest scores, Hargadon said." But knowing
in general about test scores, not as many minority stu
dents score in the high ranges, but of those that do,
Stanford has some of them."
The College Board Search Service is not necessarily
the most effective way to attract minorities, Hargadon
said, because it is used by universities and colleges
nationwide. Minority students receive 200 or 300 let
ters. But, Hargadon said. "They don't even open all of
them."
Travel is the other primary method which admissions
officers use to identify and attract qualified minority
candidates. Admissions officers visit avout 600 high
schools in December — including parochial, private and
inner-city schools.

Currently, many minorities attend private schools
"because private schools started in '68 and '69 to do the
same thing that universities and colleges are doing,"
Hargadon said. These minority students are not neces
sarily wealthy because they may have been given a
scholarship, he added.
There are 25,000 high schools in the country, "so we,
vary about half the schools we visit every year," Harga
don said.
"If you look at the population, those students
(minorities) actually come from a fair number of states,
pretty much like the rest of the population at Stanford."
Asked if an admissions officer would ever visit a
"ghetto" school, Hargadon replied," We would only if in
fact it looked like we'd find some applicants there. We
can't afford to go to schools just for show."
"Initially we certainly would, but if after some time it's
clear that either candidates there aren't interested or
that they're not as well-prepared minimally to get in our
pool, then we won't." .
After admission, minority students receive letters
from minority members of the admissions staff, which
currently consists of three minority officers, two blacks
and a Chicano. In addition, they may vis»t campus on a
special weekend sponsored by a student group.
"Our policy is not to divide the staff by ethnicity;
affirmative action is the business of the whole
staff," Hargadon said.
The minority officers do read minority applications
first, however.
Although there are extensive efforts to encourage
minority students to apply, the Office of Admissions
does not pressure minority admitted students into at
tending. "They really have to make up their mind, we're
not trying to land minority students just to have num
bers."
"They have good choices among good schools, what
we want to do is we want to help them make up their
mind, but we don't necessarily want to grab them from
Harvard to show our number is better than Harvard's, so
there is a limit to what we do in that respect," Hargadon
said.
Asked why the Office of Undergraduate Admissions,
unlike some graduate schools, does not pay for admitted
minority students to visit the campus, Hargadon replied,
"They have more money than we do. . . they may have a
harder time achieving what they want to achieve."
