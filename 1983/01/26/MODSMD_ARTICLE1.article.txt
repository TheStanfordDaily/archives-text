"The utilities department has been looking for a
good way to fill it, Price said.
The recent rain apparently made the dumping
job a little messy ana caused some of the cement
pieces to slide into the creek. The rubble must be
removed because dumping in the creek is a code
violation, but Department of Fish and Game offi
cials told Price it should stay where it is until the
ground dries out. He said he expects it to be re
moved in a week or two. 1

Rubble trouble
The state Department of Fish and Game inspected
this pile of cement debris in San Francisquito Creek
and told the University Friday it has to be removed.
The rubble, left over from construction on the
Center for Integrated Systems, was meant to fill a
bank area that was caving in, according to Donald
Price, manager of construction here. He said that
contractors are required to remove materials from
the construction site, but in this case, a "secondary
agreement" was made with the University's utilities
systems for the cement to be put on the bank.
