# Scalpers: the silent partners of Stanford sports events
## 
### JULIANN ANDERSON 
Any football or basketball fan
has seen them. Bouncing from
group to group , aggressively re
peating. "Who's got extra tick
ets?" scalpers are part of the
pre-game turmoil as the crowds
surge toward the gates.

'The scalpers over there sold some people
tickets to games one, six, eighty nine and 11.
/ could only let 11 in.'
-A ticket taker

Oftentimes, however, these
masters of the quick line and the
quicker sell aren't scalpers at all.
According to Marvin Her
rington, director of the Stanford
Department of Public Safety,
"People don't understand the
definition of scalping."
He explained that scalping, as
defined by the California penal
code, occurs only when a ticket is
sold on the grounds of the event
for more than the printed price.
Herrington added that what usu
ally takes place at Stanford is
underselling, which is perfectly
legal.
Actual scalping depends on at
tendance; at the sold-out UCLA
game Saturday night, scores of
people stood looking for tickets
to buy. For a $6 reserved ticket
the going rate ranged from $20
to a desperate fan's $70 deal.

An exuberant scalper, after
predicting early in the evening
that he would clear "oh, a
hundred" grinningly announced
that he had done twice as well,
selling the ducats for $45 each.
Standing nearby was another
man who said he scalped just for

fun. "This here is nothing. At the
Washington Redskins game,
tickets were going for $300.
That's the big time."
Others, though, were much
more serious. The first one to ar
rive at Thursday's USC game
was a part-time gardener who
had resold or scalped tickets for
15 years.
"With no education, no skills
— you gotta do something. We're
just trying to make it. I've got a
family and stuff."
Thursday's second caller,
moving to an agitated "Any
extra tickets?" was an unem
ployed construction worker. He
angrily declared, "I've been out
of work for the past five years."
Making a living through odd
jobs and working all the Bay
Area games, he said that his
highest take was $1700 at the

49ers game against Dallas.
As for methodology, a third
seller stated,' I buy 'em cheap as
I can and turn around and sell
'em for face price."
Dave Merritt, a ticket taker or
"digger," as they call them
selves, said, "A lot of the tickets
the scalpers sell are season tick
ets. They get extra student I.D.
cards; one guy bought 28 sets
from my wife in the ticket of
fice."

Besides paying exorbitant
prices for scalped tickets at the
sold-out games, some customers
did not even receive what they
paid for.
According to Merritt, "The
scalpers over there sold some
people tickets to games one, six,
eight, nine and eleven. I could
only let eleven in." When asked
how much the four victims paid
he said, "From the way they
were running, it was a bit."

Bob Schlice, another digger,
said that deception is common at
football games, too. "The scal
pers misrepresent what they
have. They'll say 'I've got fifty
yard seats,' and they're not."

* With no education, no skills-you gotta do
something. We're just trying to make it.Pve

He added that football scalp
ing or reselling, as the case may
be, is really a much larger opera
tion than with basketball simply
because of the crowd size.
When queried as to how many
officers he assigned to watch the
resellers/scalpers, Herrington
replied, none. "I can't remember
an arrest for scalping," he said,
ing," he said.
However, law enforcement of
ficers did make their presence
felt Saturday night by standing
close to all of the gates and pa
trolling the asphalt strip in front,
as well as the parking lots.
Carl Miller, community ser
vice officer, spotted two un
iformed men walking deliber
ately toward a clustered group,
presumably a scalper and his po
tential customers.
" When two sergeants are after
one, you know it's the big time,"

he said while watching.
In general, the ticket-taking
staff saw the sellers as hindr
ances.
Said one worker: "The cure is

to move 'em off. This is private
property and there should be
only one source for ticket sales."
As to how much money Stan
ford actually loses to the sellers,
Vernon Hall, supervisor of the

cards; one guy bought 28 sets from my wife
in the ticket office

ticket-taking staff, said it would
be difficult to say.
He explained that it is impos
sible to know the number of tick
ets being resold or their prices, so
a loss figure cannot be given.

In reference to Los Angeles'
ordinance forbidding any resale
of tickets on the grounds of an '•
event, Hall stated," What I'd like
to see around here is for some
one to take a position and do the
same thing."
Spectators standing in line to
get into the UCLA game had
mixed feelings about scalpers.
One fan, Chuck Greitzer,
stated, "It's my own fault that I
didn't get a ticket. So, I should
pay more."
Kevin O'Boyle, a Stanford
student, said in contrast, "I don't
like it that every time I come to a
game, someone asks me if I want -

to sell a ticket."
Finally, an anonymous fan
summed up his opinion by say
ing, "It's supply and demand. It's
mutual — one guy wants to sell
and one guy wants to buy."
