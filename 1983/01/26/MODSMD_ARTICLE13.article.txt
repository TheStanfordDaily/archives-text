# Speaker says India suffering—paradoxes lead to decline

Raj Krishna, a visiting professor at the
Food Research Institute, opened his lecture
last Tuesday at the Bechtel International
Center by saying that he planned to deliver
"news about India, which as you can imag
ine, cannot be very good."
The lecture, entitled "Peculiarities of In
dia's Development Experience," was one of
a series of Tuesday Lecture/Lunches spon
sored by the International Center. Before a

'The government has not
found a way to put more
purchasing power in the
hands of the population

crowd of about 70, Krishna cited certain
unusual features of India's development
that have prevented the dismal economic
situation there from improving.
Although he sees the outlook for the im
mediate future in India as dark, Krishna
cited rural development programs and mass
organization of the poor as two promising

forces for future change. "I think that the
poor will organize," he said.
Krishna is a professor of economics at the
University of New Delhi and was also a
member of the Planning Commission there.
He received his doctorate from the Univer
sity of Chicago where he studied under Mil
ton Freidman. But, he does not necessarily
espouse Freidman's theories, according to
Lee Zeigler, director of the I-Center, who
introduced Krishna. He has also served as
an advisor to the World Bank. Both this
year and last year he has been teaching at
the Food Research Institute.
One unusual feature of India's develop
ment that Krishna mentioned is that there
has been little variation in the three and a
half percent rate of growth of national in
come, which is among the lowest in develop
ing countries. This is peculiar because "the
country has everything you need for
growth," he said. India is high in natural
resources and scientific manpower, which
has recenxly become exportable, he added.
Another peculiarity is that there is still
tremendous malnutrition in the country of
700 million people even though there is a
government surplus of 14 million tons. It is
no longer a problem of food shortage, but a

problem of purchasing power. "The gov
ernment has not found a way to put more
purchasing power in the hands of the popu
lation," he said.
The fact that inequalities have persisted

'The outlook for the
immediate future is very
dark. India is throwing up
worse and worse leaders
with every election

and the power of the poor has not increased
even though 200 million people now vote in
India's relatively liberal political system, is
another unusual feature that Krishna men
tioned.
He said that he had discovered at least 1 5
parameters of development that are usually
expected to change after time in developing
countries, which have not changed in India.
"I am amazed by the stability of growth in
parametric measures in India."
These parameters include the rate of
growth, the increase in the government
surplus during the "green revolution", the

benefit to the poor as a result of land reform
legislation, the distribution of investment
and the allocation of land among different
crops.
Krishna said that it is especially unusual
that the proportion of labor in agricultrue
vs. industry has not decreased. This shift has
taken place in many other Asian countries.
"The capacity of the modern sector to ab
sorb labor has never been more pitiful than
in India," he said.
He added that two important objectives
of the state — the use of state action as an
equalizing force, and the milking of state
enterprises in order to lessen taxes — have
not been reached. There has been no
surplus; in fact, the state enterprises are
losing nine billion rupees per year, which is
being paid out of the revenues from higher
and higher taxes. He said that secondly the
state has not been an equalizing force; the
wages at".the public have decreased, while
the wages of government employees have
risen.
"These are very striking phenomena," he
said. "The propensity for stability of the
Indian soul is amazing to me."
In regard to the outlook for the future,
Krishna sees two hopeful forces on the hori

zon. First, there are six schemes currently in
action to try to raise the poor above the
poverty line. They so far have been im
plemented in only a small part of the coun
try, but Krishna predicted that if they are
replicated all over India, that five to six
million people per year would be raised
above the poverty line using only one
quarter of India's development expendi
tures.
Secondly, Krishna mentioned that in over
100 places there have been attempts at
peaceful mass action of the poor by Mar
xists, Christians and Gandhi-ites.

sector to absorb labor has
never been more pitiful than '

"The out/ook for the immediate future is
very dark. India is throwing up worse and
worse leaders with every election. We now
have the most illiterate president that we
have ever had. . . Only mass action can pro
duce a different kind of leadership," he said.
