## The 						Stanford Daily The 						protectionist's panacea 
### 
For the short-sighted and short-memoried, pro
tectionist trade barriers are the cure-all for domes
tic economic ills. Big businessmen like such bar
riers: with less foreign competition, they think,
everyone will buy American and business will be
bolstered on the home front. Laborers like them
too: less competition from Tokyo, they have been
told, means more jobs and higher wages in Detroit.
A smaller but equally misguided group has re
cently joined the protectionist ranks: Democrats
who are running for president. Softly but firmly,
former Vice President Walter Mondale and
California Sen. Alan Cranston and others have
indicated that they too believe trade barriers could
be an elixir for the ailing economy.
We wish that they could see, as former Gov.
Jerry Brown has, that trade barriers are no more a
panacea than were the patent medicines and elixirs
of the 1800s, and indeed are far more dangerous.
Brown, in testimony last week to the Senate Fi
nance Committee, criticized proposals to restrict
imports, charging that "protectionism is the over
simplified expedient to deal with the obvious injus
tice" of unemployed American workers.
It is not only over-simplified — it is, in the long
run, counter-productive. Initiating trade barriers is
like firing the first shot in battle: it is quite likely
that, whether or not that one bullet hits home, the
other side will respond with a thunderous volley of
ammunition, and the resulting clash will be deadly.
In international trade that volley comes in the form
of trade barriers and the situation that follows, an
all-out trade war, can devastate all concerned.
What happens domestically is that although
American-initiated trade barriers boost businesses
and save jobs threatened by foreign imports, the
reduced competition removes the incentives for
the innovation and improvement so desperately
needed in many American industries. Far more

important, the retaliatory measures that angered
trade partners inevitably respond with deal a
crushing blow to export-dependent industries. The
same fate befalls the other nations; as Brown put it,
protectionist measures risk "damaging an alliance
essential to the whole Western prosperity."
The alliance, this open economic system, is de
sirable not only because it rewards efficiency, qual
ity and productivity and thus benefits consumers
everywhere, but because its diversity cushions the
world economy from jarring fluctuations in par
ticular industries and crises in individual nations. A
closed system, as we should have learned from the
Great Depression, lacks this built-in shock ab
sorber and is vulnerable to sudden and complete
collapse of the world economy.
We wonder if Mondale, Cranston and the rest
are truly sincere in their support of trade barriers.
Far more likely, they realize that only with labor
support do they stand a chance of political survival;
they wax enthusiastic over protectionism to save
not the economy but their own political careers.
It is easier for Brown to be candid and to assail
protectionism. Out of office, with no plans for a
presidential bid — this time, at least — he feels no
need to cater to the whims of the nation's voters
with every word and deed. Unfettered by the re
strictions of electoral politics, he is free to express
what he believes — which to us, makes good sense.
In the case of international trade, he is exhibiting
the kind of political insight that the man elected in
1984 will need to have.
The others, those who plan to challenge the
president, must realize that political pragmatism
has its limits, and that to overstep its bounds in the
realm of international trade could be fatal. They
must understand that the protectionist measures
they so ardently embrace could very well squeeze
the vitality out of the American economy.
