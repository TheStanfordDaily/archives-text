Secretary of the Interior James Watt has once
again made himself the focal point of controversy
with the latest in a series of irresponsible state
ments that reflect his irresponsible behavior since
beginning his term of office.
This time Watt warned that the goals of en
vironmentalists, which he claimed were "central
ized planning and control of society" could lead to
the totalitarianism of Nazi Germany and the Soviet
Union. In a separate statement earlier in the week,
Watt blamed "terrible socialism" for the problems
faced by native Americans living on reservations.
Watt said last week, "Look what happened to
Germany in the 19305, the dignity of man was
subordinated to the powers of Nazism. The dignity
of man was subordinated in Russia . . . Those are
the forces that this thing can evolve into."
After making this statement, Watt hurriedly de
nied drawing any connection between conser
vationists and Nazis. But even though he did not
make a clear connection between them, he did
make a comparison. And a comparison like that,
made by someone who holds a responsible public
office, is more than irresponsible â€” it is dangerous.
Dangerous because it removes debate on issues
from a discussion of the merit of the arguments of
contending factions, to an attempt by one side to
besmirch the reputation of the other.
Watt has abandoned political debate in favor of
insinuation, name-calling and oversimplification.
Instead of offering arguments to counter those of
his opponents, he has resorted to a strategy of
associating all of those who disagree with his views
with a horrible evil. With these statements, Watt's
already strained credibility has been reduced even
further.
But last week was not the first time Watt has
embarrassed the administration with rhetorical
blunders. Last summer Watt warned Israeli offi
cials that the prospects for further aid to their
nation would be enhanced if American Jews sup-

ported his policies.
Before that the record shows numerous exam
ples where Watt has made offhand, inappropriate
remarks. With such an ignominious record, one
can only wonder why the administration has not
yet fired Watt.
However, a study of Watt's public exaggerations
also reveals another disturbing fact: his contempt
for the environment he is supposed to manage and
protect. On a week-long rafting trip down the
Grand Canyon, Watt complained of being bored
after the first day.
Since taking office, Watt has attempted to im
plement his "sage brush rebellion" philosophy ad
vocating reducing federal protection of land so that
private corporations can exploit the environment
to its physical limits.
One area where economists clearly agree that
the free market is deficient is long-term protection
of the environment. The Interior Department is
one of the governmental bodies entrusted with this
task. However, to the extent possible under exist
ing regulations and laws, Watt has neglected this
responsibility.
His plans to open up vast environmentally
sensitive areas off the California Coast for oil dril
ling were not even enthusiastically endorsed by the
oil companies which they were supposed to be
nefit. The reason: those areas held out such a small
possibility of containing oil that the possible profits
from the oil did not justify the costs of exploration.
In his efforts to open federal lands to private
users, Watt has myopically pursued policies which
promise only short-term gains and could easily
lead to long-term, possibly irreversible damage to
the environment. In addition, his rhetoric indicates
his unwillingness or inability to discuss issues re
sponsibly. For these reasons it is clear that Watt is
incapable of holding office and should be replaced
immediately.
