## Guilty by 'geography,' 'Missing' in Hoover 
### 
I have now seen everything. I have
heard about "guilt by association" but
your contributor, Gordon Schemierer
(Daily, Jan. 20), has introduced a new
smear tactic — guilt by geography.
Since the Hoover Institution is "200
feet away" from the movie theatre
where he saw Missing and since the
Hoover, he says,"is involved in foreign
affairs decisions," Q.E.D. The impres
sion that your contributor is trying to
cultivate, I take it, is that whatever
happened to Charles Horman, the
young American counterculture jour
nalist in Chile, was the fault of the U.S.
Embassy there and, by c*iension, the
Hoover Institution.
You are probably unaware that a
$60 million libel suit has been filed
against the movie producers and dis
tributors and book publishers by the
former American Ambassador to
Chile, the former U.S. Consul in San
tiago and the former Commander of
the U.S. Military Group in Chile. The
three plaintiffs claim, according to The
New York Times (Jan. 11). that the film
and the book on which it was based had
falsely suggested that they had "or

dered or approved the order for the
murder of Charles Horman." The book
publishers, Harcourt Brace
Jovanovich, have noted that the book
did not make "flat allegations" con
cerning a U.S. role in the murder, al
though "it does discuss the implications
of some of the evidence."
I am ready to bet that the defendants
in the suit are going to lose or will settle
out of court with the plaintiffs. I know
none of this will make much difference
to Schemierer and people who are de
termined to believe in U.S. complicity
in Horman's tragic death and in keep
ing with the old smear tactic of "guilt by
co-existence" to blame this crime on
anybody who is ideologically handy.

Open letter
I congratulate you and Mrs. Ken
nedy on being about to receive into
your home the honorable Queen

Elizabeth II and Prince Phillip. Since I
am unable to refuse myself the sincere
hope of benefitting from your fortune,
of enjoying with such agreeable and
delightful guests, if quite convenient to
you and Mrs. Kennedy, I shall hope
within a few days to be introduced to
the Queen, whom I have so long de
sired to be acquainted with.
My kind friends here are most affec
tionately urgent with me to list my vir
tues, but their hospitable and cheerful
dispositions lead them too much into
society, and they view lunch with the
Queen in something less than the ex
traordinary light such an epochal event
occasions. But, since you know nothing
of me beyond what this thin paper con
veys, I am obliged to inform you of the
details which most truly render my
character, and which best afford you
with an idea as to whether I will be a
most agreeable house-guest.
I am reasonably well-bred, both par
ents having received private education.
Admittedly, no royal blood runs
through my family; although, I am
happy to confess, Abraham Lincoln is a
great great great great great great uncle

on one side of the family and Paul Re
vere a distant cousin on the other (it
crosses my mind that the Queen may
not find this second bit of information
entirely agreeable, considering her ob
vious ties to King George of that era,
whom Revere was so ardently pitted
against: perhaps it would be most
utilitarian if this volatile fact — over
which I have no control, clearly, and in
no way defend — were kept between
you and me). As a natural consequence
of my heritage, I have acquired all ap
propriate manners and disposition; my
countenance, furthermore, is cheerful
and bears all the appearances of proper
education.
I am determined, you see, to be of
fered invitation to your house. It would
indeed give me most painful sensations
to know that it were not your express
wish to receive me; therefore, I impa
tiently look forward to the hour when I
shall be received at your delightful
luncheon.
