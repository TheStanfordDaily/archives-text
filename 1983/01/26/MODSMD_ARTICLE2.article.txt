# Financial aid hearings
## Educators urge grad support 
### JULIE RYAN Staff writer 
University leaders, industry officials
and professional school representa
tives emphasized the need for federal
support of graduate education in tes
timony before a federal subcommittee
here yesterday.
"It is arithmetically impossible to
work your way through college today,"
New York University President John
Brademas said, "even if you work 20
hours a week and have a pretty good
summer job."
After the all-day hearing at Meyer
Forum Room, Subcommittee Chair
man Brademas told the Daily that the
Reagan administration used "bad
judgment" in suggesting cuts in
graduate student aid. "There was no
support (today) for the present admin
istration's effort to eliminate graduate
and professional students from guaran
teed student loan programs," he said.
Yesterday's hearing before the Na
tional Commission on Student Finan
cial Assistance's Subcommittee on
Graduate Education was the first in a
nationwide scries of hearings assessing
the need for continued financial aid.
The commission must make recom
mendations concerning student finan
cial aid to Congress and the president
before July 1983. Brademas said these
recommendations will be "very influ
ential."
"One thing that came out loud and

clear today was that in-school interest
subsidy should be maintained at the
graduate level," said commission
member David Irwin, executive vice
prsident of Washington Friends of
Higher Education. The interest subsidy
allows recipients to escape paying
interest on Guaranteed Student Loans
until after graduation.
After hearing testimony by repre
sentatives from Lockheed, Xerox,
Hewlett-Packard and CETUS Corpo
rations. Irwin said it encouraged him to
see the commitment that industry is
willing to make to education.
However, Harold Hall, vice presi
dent of corporate research at Xerox,
said, "Industry cannot absorb more
than a very small percentage of the re
sponsibility for graduate education.
The primary responsibility must be
borne by the society as a whole."
Electrical Engineering Prof. Thomas
Kailaph recommended tax credits for
corporate support of research at uni
versities as one way to get industry into
the act to a greater level. He testified
that fewer than 70 percent of the Stan
ford graduate students in engineering
are American and said the reasons are
basically economic.
Godon Schaber, dean of the Univer
sity of the Pacific Law School, and
UC-San Francisco Chancellor Julius
Kevans testified on the financial need
of students attending professional

schools. Both disagreed with a sugges
tion that perhaps these students need
less aid because they are training for
high paying jobs.

Schaber said that 91 percent of law
students depend on loans and said the
"continued ability of graduates to con
solidate their loans is necessary to in
sure that quality students have the op
portunity for advanced education in
law."
Krevans said almost one third of ac
cepted medical students have total fam
ily incomes of less than $25,000 while
the estimated cost of one year at
UC-San Francisco Medical School is
about $17,000.
At graduation, the average medical
student owes about $20,000. "There
has to be substantial financial aid of we
are to keep medical education from
being accessible only to the rich," he
said.
D. Keith Naylor, assistant dean of
graduate studies and research here, tes
tified that current federal programs to
support minorities in graduate educa
tion are not sufficient. "I see the fed
eral government as having a structural
responsibility to open closed doors, a
symbolic responsibility to articulate in
clusive principles, and a financial re
sponsibility to support those who are
financially disadvantaged, at least
partly because of past government
policies," Naylor said.
