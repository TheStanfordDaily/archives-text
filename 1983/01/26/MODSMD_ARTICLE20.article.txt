## Ethics distort goal of diplomacy 
### 
As I sat there drinking white wine
mixed with sparkling water in the Vie
nnese fashion, I felt quite comfortable
as the guest of an Austrian gentleman
who had served in the German army
during the Second World War. He
seemed to be just as I was — hardly like
the diabolical Nazi portrayed in Hol
lywood films.

Good diplomacy must lead nations to perceive
peace as being in their self-interest and must
make certain that the consequences of
diplomatic failure, war, appear more costly
than any conceivable gain.

Pensively I listened to his stories and
answered his questions about America.
How is it, I wondered, that this kind
and hospitable man who is now my
friend, was once an enemy? What pur
pose could there be to a conflict be
tween nations which causes potential
comrades to become sworn adver
saries? I gazed upon his son, the same
age as I, and cringed at the thought that
had it been another time and place this
good friend of mine would have been in
a different uniform and thus my mortal
enemy.
The idea of war had become per
sonalized for me, and it was awful. It no
longer meant defending oneself against
some nameless, faceless devil; it meant
fighting, and quite possibly killing,
some poor soul who in most cases is
motivated by the same loyalties as
many of us: nation, home and heritage.
1 thought to myself," Are not all people
everywhere basically the same, only
seeking to have sustenance, work, a
family and love?"
I began to think that war was indeed
insane and should be avoided at all
costs. Nothing could have justified my
taking my friend's life because of na
tional differences, I thought.
But then 1 wondered if Saint Au
gustine had been correct when he
wrote that some wars were "just" and
others were "unjust," that wars could
be waged and judged according to
principles of morality. I asked myself if
ethical principles could really be used
to govern international affairs, whether
or not there really were higher goals
which could be pursued through war,
whether any end could justify such a
means.

Perhaps the correct ethic can only be
ascertained on a case-by-case basis. If
Naziism was an evil which had to be
stopped by any means possible, then
the war against Adolph Hitler's Ger
many was certainly justified. But why
did the atrocities and genocide commit
ted by Pol Pot not make a war against
his Kampuchea equally justified?

If the difference is that Hitler was an
aggressor and attacked other nations
such as Poland, then why did we not
intervene on behalf of the Afghans
when they were attacked the
Soviets; or the Iranians when they were
initially attacked by the Iraqis? Why
have we not protected the PLO against
the attacking Israelis, or the Israelis
against various Arab lands in 1948,
1967 and 1973?
The answer, I believe, is that the
United States does and must, as is true

No consistent ethics can really be applied to
international relations. If relations between
states were governed strictly by rules of morality
then this country and others would be doomed to
a future of repeated crusades and holy wars.

for all nations, pursue a policy of calcu
lated self-interest. In the final analysis,
we entered World War II because we
felt threatened, not because of any
sympathy for the Poles, the Britons, or
even the Jews, sad as that fact may be.
No consistent ethics can really be
applied to international relations. If re
lations between states were governed
strictly by rules of morality then this
country and others would be doom
to a future of repeated crusades and

holy wars. Furthermore, there could be
no accurate consensus on what really
constituted a righteous causus belli.
One man's just intervention in Viet
nam is another man's imperialist inter
ference in the affairs of others. The
only possible policy path is the cautious
pursuit of self-interest, or Realpolitik.
Realpolitik was the term used to de
scribe Otto Von Bismark's pragmatic
diplomatic balancing act and cautious
Prussian policy of expansionism during
the latter half of the 19th century.
The problem with a pragmatic policy
based on self-interest, however, as
Bismark himself certainly realized, is
that it can also lead a nation to war, as
was the case with World War 11.
If an ethical approach to interna
tional relations would lead us into
crusades and holy wars and a Real
politik approach would also, at least on J
occasion, lead to wars, then wars, a<J
innately irrational as they are in themJ
selves, are inevitable. It seems we are im
a quandry from which no specific poiicfl
of international relations can rescue us?^
Even a cursory examination of his
tory clearly shows that wars have al
ways occurred, just as they do now. As
long as there have been humans, there
has been violent conflict among them.
Foreign policies, as careful as they may

be, can only postpone the inevitable.
But postpone we must; we cannot
change human nature but we can alter
men's perceptions of their interests.
Good diplomacy must lead nations to
perceive peace as being in their self
interest and must make certain that the
consequences of diplomatic failure,
war, appear more costly than any con
ceivable gain.

As I sat there drinking white wine
mixed with sparkling water in the Vie
nnese fashion, I felt quite comfortable
as the guest of an Austrian gentleman
who had served in the German army
during the Second World War. He
seemed to be just as I was — hardly like
the diabolical Nazi portrayed in Hol
lywood films.

Good diplomacy must lead nations to perceive
peace as being in their self-interest and must
make certain that the consequences of
diplomatic failure, war, appear more costly
than any conceivable gain.

Pensively I listened to his stories and
answered his questions about America.
How is it, I wondered, that this kind
and hospitable man who is now my
friend, was once an enemy? What pur
pose could there be to a conflict be
tween nations which causes potential
comrades to become sworn adver
saries? I gazed upon his son, the same
age as I, and cringed at the thought that
had it been another time and place this
good friend of mine would have been in
a different uniform and thus my mortal
enemy.
The idea of war had become per
sonalized for me, and it was awful. It no
longer meant defending oneself against
some nameless, faceless devil; it meant
fighting, and quite possibly killing,
some poor soul who in most cases is
motivated by the same loyalties as
many of us: nation, home and heritage.
1 thought to myself," Are not all people
everywhere basically the same, only
seeking to have sustenance, work, a
family and love?"
I began to think that war was indeed
insane and should be avoided at all
costs. Nothing could have justified my
taking my friend's life because of na
tional differences, I thought.
But then 1 wondered if Saint Au
gustine had been correct when he
wrote that some wars were "just" and
others were "unjust," that wars could
be waged and judged according to
principles of morality. I asked myself if
ethical principles could really be used
to govern international affairs, whether
or not there really were higher goals
which could be pursued through war,
whether any end could justify such a
means.

Perhaps the correct ethic can only be
ascertained on a case-by-case basis. If
Naziism was an evil which had to be
stopped by any means possible, then
the war against Adolph Hitler's Ger
many was certainly justified. But why
did the atrocities and genocide commit
ted by Pol Pot not make a war against
his Kampuchea equally justified?

If the difference is that Hitler was an
aggressor and attacked other nations
such as Poland, then why did we not
intervene on behalf of the Afghans
when they were attacked the
Soviets; or the Iranians when they were
initially attacked by the Iraqis? Why
have we not protected the PLO against
the attacking Israelis, or the Israelis
against various Arab lands in 1948,
1967 and 1973?
The answer, I believe, is that the
United States does and must, as is true

No consistent ethics can really be applied to
international relations. If relations between
states were governed strictly by rules of morality
then this country and others would be doomed to
a future of repeated crusades and holy wars.

for all nations, pursue a policy of calcu
lated self-interest. In the final analysis,
we entered World War II because we
felt threatened, not because of any
sympathy for the Poles, the Britons, or
even the Jews, sad as that fact may be.
No consistent ethics can really be
applied to international relations. If re
lations between states were governed
strictly by rules of morality then this
country and others would be doom
to a future of repeated crusades and

holy wars. Furthermore, there could be
no accurate consensus on what really
constituted a righteous causus belli.
One man's just intervention in Viet
nam is another man's imperialist inter
ference in the affairs of others. The
only possible policy path is the cautious
pursuit of self-interest, or Realpolitik.
Realpolitik was the term used to de
scribe Otto Von Bismark's pragmatic
diplomatic balancing act and cautious
Prussian policy of expansionism during
the latter half of the 19th century.
The problem with a pragmatic policy
based on self-interest, however, as
Bismark himself certainly realized, is
that it can also lead a nation to war, as
was the case with World War 11.
If an ethical approach to interna
tional relations would lead us into
crusades and holy wars and a Real
politik approach would also, at least on J
occasion, lead to wars, then wars, a<J
innately irrational as they are in themJ
selves, are inevitable. It seems we are im
a quandry from which no specific poiicfl
of international relations can rescue us?^
Even a cursory examination of his
tory clearly shows that wars have al
ways occurred, just as they do now. As
long as there have been humans, there
has been violent conflict among them.
Foreign policies, as careful as they may

be, can only postpone the inevitable.
But postpone we must; we cannot
change human nature but we can alter
men's perceptions of their interests.
Good diplomacy must lead nations to
perceive peace as being in their self
interest and must make certain that the
consequences of diplomatic failure,
war, appear more costly than any con
ceivable gain.
