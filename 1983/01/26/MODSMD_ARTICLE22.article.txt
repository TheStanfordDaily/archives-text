## 
### BOB ORTTUNG Staff writer 
Students here are often too preoccupied with
the normal functioning of their everyday lives
to worry about the suffering of political dis
sidents in foreign countries. But 50 people were
sufficiently moved last week to write letters on
the behalf of Anatoly Scharansky, a Soviet dis
sident who has been imprisoned for his work in
human rights, after hearing Yuri Yarim-
Agaev, another dissident studying here, speak
of the Soviet Union's treatment of Scharansky.
Yarim-Agaev's speech was sponsored by the
Urgent Action chapter of Amnesty Interna
tional (AI) based here. In a Daily interview
later last week, Yarim-Agaev sharply criticized
the Soviet Union's treatment of Scharansky.
Yarim-Agaev has known Scharansky since
high school. Thcv both studied at the Moscow

disarmament, of peace in
Europe, of trade, science and
so on are inseparable from the

countries of basic human

Helsinki Watch Group.
In March of 1977 Scharansky was arrested
tor his work in the Helsinki group. According
to Al. he was accused of treason and held for
16 months without a trial. Finally, in a closed
trial he was sentenced to three years in prison
followed by 10 years in a prison camp.
In 1 98 Ihe spent 185 days in solitary con
finement. Last January the government al
lowed his first family visit in one and a half
years. In September he started a hunger strike
and according to the last report is being force
fed.
Since arriving in the United States, Yarim-
Agaev has been working to gain freedom for
Scharansky and other politioal prisoners.
T here are two ways of working for the prison
ers' release from outside the Soviet Union, he
said.
One method entails sending letters not only
to Soviet authorities but to the people who live
in the same city that Scharansky was born in, or
who work in the same profession.

"According to our knowledge, a lot of these
letters are delivered so there is a big chance
that we can reach a large number of people in
the Soviet Union this way," Yarim-Agaev said.
The second method involves giving people
like Scharansky publicity in the West by mak
ing their cases known to the White House and
Congress. "It should be done permanently. If
you stop, everything will decline and condi
tions will get worse," Yarim-Agaev said.
The Moscow Helsinki Watch Group was
founded in 1976 to enforce the Declaration of
the European Security Conference ratified in
Helsinki in 1975. The agreement was signed by
35 European countries including the Soviet
Union in addition to the United States.
According to Yarim-Agaev, the treaty has
three basic goals. The first deals mainly with
disarmament and maintaining the status quo of
borders in Europe. The second deals with rela
tions between countries in the field of trade as
well as scientific and cultural exchange. The
last main provision stresses thcnecessity of pro
tecting human rig'its. The states involved will
respect "fundamental freedoms, including the
freedom of thought, conscience, religion or be
lief," according to the treaty.
The Soviet Union benefited from the treaty
because it formally proved the separation of
Germany, according to Yarim-Agaev. West
ern countries were interested mainly in the
human rights aspect of the agreement. The
question of disarmament, of peace in Europe,
of trade, science and so on are inseparable from
the implementation by all the countries of basic
human rights," Yarim-Agaev said.
Several dissidents formed the Helsinki
Watch Group in hopes of makingsure that the
government improved the human rights situa
tion. "The people of the Soviet Union, from
the beginning, had very big doubts that Soviet
officials were really going tofollow this agree
ment. The goal of the group was to promote
implementation of the Helsinki agreement; to
promote it in a real way not like the Soviet
government was going to do it," Yarim-Agaev
said.
The group feared that the Soviets had signed
the treaty as a "political trick" to get what it
wanted from the West.
When the group members learned about vio
lations of human rights of any kind, they pub
lished documents explaining what was going on
and circulated them within the country and also
gave them to correspondents of Western nevvs

papers.
During the six years it was alive, the group
published about 200 documents. Three months
ago the group ceased to exist because there
were only three members left in the Soviet
Union who were not in prison.
Yarim-Agaev said, "Most of my friends are
in Soviet prisons and labor camps. I was lucky
because I was offered a sad choice: either to
leave the country in one month or to be ar
rested. Most of mv friends were not offered the
sad choice. What are my feelings? My feelings
are very simple. I simply try to do the best being
here. All of us knew we could be arrested. I he
only thing I try to do is organize some activities

in defense of other people in the Soviet Union
and to explain what we did. I am one of the few
people who is here so 1 have to be a speaker, to
some extent, for the other people."
"Definitely each of us is kind and altruistic,
(or) we wouldn't be involved in such activity.
But still we are not sentimental. . . because,
you see, coming through so many years of such
tough situations and life you cannot stay senti
mental. For me the main thing is % to do the best
to relieve these people."
Although life in the Soviet Union has caused
many dissidents to lose their sentimentality,
these same dissidents have not lost their hu

manity.
"Scharansky had a very sharp mind. He was
a very active, very kind man. . . I would say he
had almost all the good qualities which a man
can have. He had a very good sense of humor,
he was very sociable, and could communicate
very well with all people. And at the same time
he was a very serious person who was thinking
very deeply, who read a lot. This is a problem
now because in prison he is having troubles
with his eyes. He almost cannot read. For him
this is one of the biggest troubles that could
happen to him," Yarim-Agaev said.
Scharansky is not the only one in prison now.
Yuri Orlov, who founded the Helsinki Watch
Group, was arrested one month before
Scharansky and was sentence to seven years of
labor camp and five years of internal exile.
Tanya Osipova and Ivan Kovalcv (husband
and wife) were arrested in 1980 and 1981 and

were each sentenced to 112 ive years of labor and
five years of internal exile. They are as impor
tant as Scharansky. as are many other members
of the group, yet they do not receive as much
attention.
To answer urgent action requests, the local
chapter of A 1 asks people to write letters on
behalf of individual prisoners, livery so often,
they sponsor a special speaker for a campaign.
Last week, almost 50 people wrote letters on
behalf of Scharansky.
"You sort of felt helpless. . . writing to Yuri
Andropov. You sort of feel like it's not going to
really ever do much, but 1 guess if you keep
trying, if you keep on persisting you've got to
have hope," said Ridley Wills, one of the letter
writers.

lowed his first family visit in one and a half
years. In September he started a hunger strike
and according to the last report is being force

Since arriving in the United States, Yarim-
Agaev has been working to gain freedom for
Scharansky and other politioal prisoners.
T here are two ways of working for the prison
ers' release from outside the Soviet Union, he
said.
One method entails sending letters not only
to Soviet authorities but to the people who live
in the same city that Scharansky was born in, or
who work in the same profession.

"According to our knowledge, a lot of these
letters are delivered so there is a big chance
that we can reach a large number of people in
the Soviet Union this way," Yarim-Agaev said.
The second method involves giving people
like Scharansky publicity in the West by mak
ing their cases known to the White House and
Congress. "It should be done permanently. If
you stop, everything will decline and condi
tions will get worse," Yarim-Agaev said.
The Moscow Helsinki Watch Group was
founded in 1976 to enforce the Declaration of
the European Security Conference ratified in
Helsinki in 1975. The agreement was signed by
35 European countries including the Soviet
Union in addition to the United States.
According to Yarim-Agaev, the treaty has
three basic goals. The first deals mainly with
disarmament and maintaining the status quo of
borders in Europe. The second deals with rela
tions between countries in the field of trade as
well as scientific and cultural exchange. The
last main provision stresses thcnecessity of pro
tecting human rig'its. The states involved will
respect "fundamental freedoms, including the
freedom of thought, conscience, religion or be
lief," according to the treaty.
The Soviet Union benefited from the treaty
because it formally proved the separation of
Germany, according to Yarim-Agaev. West
ern countries were interested mainly in the
human rights aspect of the agreement. The
question of disarmament, of peace in Europe,
of trade, science and so on are inseparable from
the implementation by all the countries of basic
human rights," Yarim-Agaev said.
Several dissidents formed the Helsinki
Watch Group in hopes of makingsure that the
government improved the human rights situa
tion. "The people of the Soviet Union, from
the beginning, had very big doubts that Soviet
officials were really going tofollow this agree
ment. The goal of the group was to promote
implementation of the Helsinki agreement; to
promote it in a real way not like the Soviet
government was going to do it," Yarim-Agaev
said.
The group feared that the Soviets had signed
the treaty as a "political trick" to get what it
wanted from the West.
When the group members learned about vio
lations of human rights of any kind, they pub
lished documents explaining what was going on
and circulated them within the country and also
gave them to correspondents of Western nevvs

papers.
During the six years it was alive, the group
published about 200 documents. Three months
ago the group ceased to exist because there
were only three members left in the Soviet
Union who were not in prison.
Yarim-Agaev said, "Most of my friends are
in Soviet prisons and labor camps. I was lucky
because I was offered a sad choice: either to
leave the country in one month or to be ar
rested. Most of mv friends were not offered the
sad choice. What are my feelings? My feelings
are very simple. I simply try to do the best being
here. All of us knew we could be arrested. I he
only thing I try to do is organize some activities

in defense of other people in the Soviet Union
and to explain what we did. I am one of the few
people who is here so 1 have to be a speaker, to
some extent, for the other people."
"Definitely each of us is kind and altruistic,
(or) we wouldn't be involved in such activity.
But still we are not sentimental. . . because,
you see, coming through so many years of such
tough situations and life you cannot stay senti
mental. For me the main thing is % to do the best
to relieve these people."
Although life in the Soviet Union has caused
many dissidents to lose their sentimentality,
these same dissidents have not lost their hu

manity.
"Scharansky had a very sharp mind. He was
a very active, very kind man. . . I would say he
had almost all the good qualities which a man
can have. He had a very good sense of humor,
he was very sociable, and could communicate
very well with all people. And at the same time
he was a very serious person who was thinking
very deeply, who read a lot. This is a problem
now because in prison he is having troubles
with his eyes. He almost cannot read. For him
this is one of the biggest troubles that could
happen to him," Yarim-Agaev said.
Scharansky is not the only one in prison now.
Yuri Orlov, who founded the Helsinki Watch
Group, was arrested one month before
Scharansky and was sentence to seven years of
labor camp and five years of internal exile.
Tanya Osipova and Ivan Kovalcv (husband
and wife) were arrested in 1980 and 1981 and

were each sentenced to 112 ive years of labor and
five years of internal exile. They are as impor
tant as Scharansky. as are many other members
of the group, yet they do not receive as much
attention.
To answer urgent action requests, the local
chapter of A 1 asks people to write letters on
behalf of individual prisoners, livery so often,
they sponsor a special speaker for a campaign.
Last week, almost 50 people wrote letters on
behalf of Scharansky.
"You sort of felt helpless. . . writing to Yuri
Andropov. You sort of feel like it's not going to
really ever do much, but 1 guess if you keep
trying, if you keep on persisting you've got to
have hope," said Ridley Wills, one of the letter
writers.

Students here are often too preoccupied with
the normal functioning of their everyday lives
to worry about the suffering of political dis
sidents in foreign countries. But 50 people were
sufficiently moved last week to write letters on
the behalf of Anatoly Scharansky, a Soviet dis
sident who has been imprisoned for his work in
human rights, after hearing Yuri Yarim-
Agaev, another dissident studying here, speak
of the Soviet Union's treatment of Scharansky.
Yarim-Agaev's speech was sponsored by the
Urgent Action chapter of Amnesty Interna
tional (AI) based here. In a Daily interview
later last week, Yarim-Agaev sharply criticized
the Soviet Union's treatment of Scharansky.
Yarim-Agaev has known Scharansky since

In March of 1977 Scharansky was arrested

to Al. he was accused of treason and held for
16 months without a trial. Finally, in a closed
trial he was sentenced to three years in prison
followed by 10 years in a prison camp.
