## Revelli travels to Washington for doubtful key conference clashes 
### MARK ZEIGLER 
Alter moving into filth
place in the Pacific-10 over
the weekend with a split
against the I os Angeles
schools. Stanford's men's
basketball team (2-3. 10-5)
heads north for crucial
match-ups against Washing
ton and Washington State.
The Cardinal takes on a fal
tering Washington Husky
squad (1-4. 10-S) Thursday
night in Seattle. Coach Marv
Harshman and his troops suf
fered an ego-deflating loss to
hapless Oregon Monday
night, and are in the thick of a
three-way race with the
Ducks and Arizona Wildcats
for Pac-10 doormat honors.
Despite Washington's re
cent problems, Stanford
coach Tom Davis hopes the
Card will not look past the
Huskies Saturday night's
game against Washington
State, whose 5-0 Pac-10 re
cord is bettered only b\
UCLA's a* 6-0.
One thing in Stanford's
favor is the scheduling of the
two Washington games,
which gives the Cardinal the
easier opponent, the Huskies,
first.

the road." Russell said. "If
you win on the first night, you
put yourself in the position to
make it a great trip" by win
ning the second game as well.
A question mark on the
Cardinal's roster is leading
scorer and rebounder John
Revclli, who was sidelined
last Thursday with a sprained
ankle in Stanford's victory
over USC. Although his
status for the weekend games
remains doubtful, he will
travel with the team to Wash
ington.
"It's hard to say right
now," trainer Jim Liukkonen
said last night. "1 would guess
he will not play, let alone suit
up. Thursday night (against
Washington)." Liukkonen
added that Revelli may suit
up Saturday, but probably

REACHING FOR THE TOP: Reserve center Dave Nussbaum, who saw action in place
of injured All-Conference center John Revelli in Stanford's 101-87 loss to No. 1 UCLA
Saturday will probably be called upon again in Washington as Revelli's playing
status for this weekend's games is doubtful.
