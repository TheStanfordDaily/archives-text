# Inside game stops Arizona as 'bench' finishes off 'Cats
## 
### LIBBY LEONARD 
Stanford's women's basketball
team pounced on its prey — the
Arizona Wildcats — and cap
tured a 74-61 win Monday night.
The Wildcats were underdogs
from the start, having lost five
conference games in a row.
Arizona's was like a doughnut —
centerless. Lacking a dominating
center. Arizona often played
with four fast guards who fa
vored outside shooting.
Against Stanford, however,
the run-and-gun Wildcats pulled
the trigger too quickly, misfired
too often and hit only 41 percent
from the field. Arizona's top
perimeter shooters, Leslie Mar
tin and Pat Broaden, combined
to sink just 14-of-37.
The Card shot a miserable 39
percent in the opening half, but
improved its accuracy in the sec
ond half, converting 62 percent.
From the opening tipoff, the
Card exploited its height advan
tage, working the ball inside to
post players Meg Metzger,
Jeanne Ruark-Hoff and Kim
Kupferer.
Stdnford should have pulled
away sooner but missed several
early shots from close range.
After seven minutes, the score
remained tied at six.
During an Arizona timeout,
Cardinal coach Dotty McCrea
told her team "to do something a
little more creative. We have the
mismatches inside, but the refs
aren't calling anything."
Taking McCrea's advice, Stan
ford players started to jab, pump
and fake near the basket, draw
ing apparent Arizona fouls. The
Cards held a slim four-point
edge with eight minutes left in
the half. Stanford's Metzger then
decided to give the young
Wildcats an offensive clinic, scor
ing a string of nine points to push
the Card ahead, 27-16.
Twice during Metzger's offen
sive surge, senior guard Angie
Paccione sent her lofting outlet
passes which resulted in breaka
way layins. Paccione leads the
Card in assists, averaging 4.5 a
game.
Met/ger was also active on de
fense. After intercepting an

Arizona pass, the All-America
candidate spotted teammate
Ruark-Hoff who scored yet
another uncongcsted layin for
the Card at the 4:30 mark.

Stanford applied pressure de
fense in its 2-3 /one, forcing 10
Arizona turnovers in the first
half. Arizona steadily became
