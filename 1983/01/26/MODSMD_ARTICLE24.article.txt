# Inside game stops Arizona as 'bench' finishes off 'Cats
## 
### LIBBY LEONARD 
Stanford's women's basketball
team pounced on its prey — the
Arizona Wildcats — and cap
tured a 74-61 win Monday night.
The Wildcats were underdogs
from the start, having lost five
conference games in a row.
Arizona's was like a doughnut —
centerless. Lacking a dominating
center. Arizona often played
with four fast guards who fa
vored outside shooting.
Against Stanford, however,
the run-and-gun Wildcats pulled
the trigger too quickly, misfired
too often and hit only 41 percent
from the field. Arizona's top
perimeter shooters, Leslie Mar
tin and Pat Broaden, combined
to sink just 14-of-37.
The Card shot a miserable 39
percent in the opening half, but
improved its accuracy in the sec
ond half, converting 62 percent.
From the opening tipoff, the
Card exploited its height advan
tage, working the ball inside to
post players Meg Metzger,
Jeanne Ruark-Hoff and Kim
Kupferer.
Stdnford should have pulled
away sooner but missed several
early shots from close range.
After seven minutes, the score
remained tied at six.
During an Arizona timeout,
Cardinal coach Dotty McCrea
told her team "to do something a
little more creative. We have the
mismatches inside, but the refs
aren't calling anything."
Taking McCrea's advice, Stan
ford players started to jab, pump
and fake near the basket, draw
ing apparent Arizona fouls. The
Cards held a slim four-point
edge with eight minutes left in
the half. Stanford's Metzger then
decided to give the young
Wildcats an offensive clinic, scor
ing a string of nine points to push
the Card ahead, 27-16.
Twice during Metzger's offen
sive surge, senior guard Angie
Paccione sent her lofting outlet
passes which resulted in breaka
way layins. Paccione leads the
Card in assists, averaging 4.5 a
game.
Met/ger was also active on de
fense. After intercepting an

Arizona pass, the All-America
candidate spotted teammate
Ruark-Hoff who scored yet
another uncongcsted layin for
the Card at the 4:30 mark.

Stanford applied pressure de
fense in its 2-3 /one, forcing 10
Arizona turnovers in the first
half. Arizona steadily became

unglued, which allowed the
Card's lead to stick.
McCrea called on her reserves
to close out the half. Sara Evans,
a powerful six-foot-two
t frcshman. was fouled while
muscling up the last shot in the
half. Evans hit both free throws
to give Stanford a seemingly in
surmountable 37-23 halftime
lead.
Arizona opened the second
half in a full court press which
failed to produce many Cardinal
turnovers. Stanford point guard

Virginia Sourlis dribbled her way
through the press in a foot race
with the quick Arizona guards.
After clearing the ball across half
court, Sourlis repeatedly hit her
teammates for easy baskets un
derneath. The fleet-footed floor
leader finished with seven assists
and four steals.
Stanford's lead swelled to 22
after junior Lee Ann Margerum
netted a 15-foot jumpshot with
7:41 left. Again McCrea
emptied her bench to give the
reserves more experience.

McCrea tried to give Sourlis a
rest down the stretch, but the
Cardinal backup guards had
trouble handling Arizona's full
court pressure. After four con
secutive Cardinal turnovers and
three baskets by Arizona's Mar
tin, Stanford's lead had slipped
to 68-55.
Moments later, McCrea had
Sourlis return to the game to re
store order.
"It's nice to have a game like
this," remarked McCrea.
"We've lost so many close ones
at home."

Playing time was distributed
among the entire Cardinal squad
in its first romp of the season. No
one finished scoreless.
Metzger led the balanced Card
attack with 13 points in just 20
minutes of play.
Monday's victory evened the
Card's conferencc record at 2-2.
According to McCrea, "The
league is up for grabs." No team
in the WCAA has maintained a
perfect record this season. The
Card faces a rebuilding Washing
ton State team at Maples on
Tuesday at 7:30 p.m.

Stanford's women's basketball
team pounced on its prey — the
Arizona Wildcats — and cap
tured a 74-61 win Monday night.
The Wildcats were underdogs
from the start, having lost five
conference games in a row.
Arizona's was like a doughnut —
centerless. Lacking a dominating
center. Arizona often played
with four fast guards who fa
vored outside shooting.
Against Stanford, however,
the run-and-gun Wildcats pulled
the trigger too quickly, misfired
too often and hit only 41 percent
from the field. Arizona's top
perimeter shooters, Leslie Mar
tin and Pat Broaden, combined
to sink just 14-of-37.
The Card shot a miserable 39
percent in the opening half, but
improved its accuracy in the sec
ond half, converting 62 percent.
From the opening tipoff, the
Card exploited its height advan
tage, working the ball inside to
post players Meg Metzger,
Jeanne Ruark-Hoff and Kim
Kupferer.
Stdnford should have pulled
away sooner but missed several
early shots from close range.
After seven minutes, the score
remained tied at six.
During an Arizona timeout,
Cardinal coach Dotty McCrea
told her team "to do something a
little more creative. We have the
mismatches inside, but the refs
aren't calling anything."
Taking McCrea's advice, Stan
ford players started to jab, pump
and fake near the basket, draw
ing apparent Arizona fouls. The
Cards held a slim four-point
edge with eight minutes left in
the half. Stanford's Metzger then
decided to give the young
Wildcats an offensive clinic, scor
ing a string of nine points to push
the Card ahead, 27-16.
Twice during Metzger's offen
sive surge, senior guard Angie
Paccione sent her lofting outlet
passes which resulted in breaka
way layins. Paccione leads the
Card in assists, averaging 4.5 a
game.
Met/ger was also active on de
fense. After intercepting an

Arizona pass, the All-America
candidate spotted teammate
Ruark-Hoff who scored yet
another uncongcsted layin for
the Card at the 4:30 mark.

Stanford applied pressure de

Arizona turnovers in the first
half. Arizona steadily became

Card's lead to stick.
McCrea called on her reserves
to close out the half. Sara Evans,
a powerful six-foot-two
t frcshman. was fouled while
muscling up the last shot in the
half. Evans hit both free throws
to give Stanford a seemingly in
