The Stanford women's gymnastics team traveled to Hayward on
Monday night and came away with an easy victory, defeating UC-
Hayward 160.65 to 152.00.
Although coach Homer Sardina left most of his top gymnasts at
home, his team still managed to compile one of their top scores of the
year. "We just hit one routine after another," said Sardina happily.
* Winning the all-around as well as the balance beam was sopho
" more Vicky Worden with her total score of 33.65. Junior Caryn
Lucido was second in the all-around with 32.8 out of a possible 40,
Karen Hall won the uneven parallel bars while Julie Bledsoe won the
vault.
Sardina also took the opportunity to use the team members who do
not always compete. He cited freshman Amy Plaut for doing an
outstanding job, while also being a spiritual leader for the team.
Junior Anne Friend also competed for the second time in two years
after recovering from an injury. She placed sixth in the all-around.
Although this year's squad is feeling the absence of stars Carolyn
Tarkington and Merilyn Chapman, they have compiled a 4-0 record.
"Our success shows that a good team is not just stars, it's chemistry,"
said Sardina. "And chemistry is definitely what we have now."
The women will head for Cal this weekend to take part in the
Berkeley invitational meet. There, they will face two of their toughest
opponents in Washington and California. The Bears will be looking
for revenge after falling to Stanford two weeks ago.
