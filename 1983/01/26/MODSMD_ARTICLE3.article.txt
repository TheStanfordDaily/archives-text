Reagan urges spending freeze, warns of deficits
Washington — President Reagan declared last night in a sobering State of
the Union message that runaway deficits pose "a clear and present danger"
to the Republic and called for a federal spending freeze and standby tax in
creases that could be imposed in two years.
Addressing a joint session of Congress, Reagan urged that the six-month
freeze in cost-of-living adjustments recommended by a bi-partisan Social Se
curity Commission also be applied to other government-related retirement
programs.
He said he would also propose to Congress a one-year freeze on a broad
range of domestic spending programs, and on pay raises for federal civilian
workers and military personnel.
"I know this is strong medicine," the president said of his proposed spend
ing freeze, "but so far we have only cut the rate of increase in federal spend
ing. The government has continued to spend more money each year, though
not as much as it did in the past.
"Taken as a whole, the budget 1 am proposing for the next fiscal year will
increase no more than the rate of inflation — in other words, the federal gov
ernment will hold the line on real spending.
The president also said in his nationally televised address that he would
ask Congress to adopt specific measures to deal with the growth of so-called
uncontrollable spending programs, such as food stamps. He said such pro
grams had grown bv more than 4(X) percent since 1 970 and were "the largest,
single cause of the built-in or "structural deficit problem.
Reagan exempted his huee defense spending program from the freeze pro
posal, declaring that "we will not gamble with our national survival." He
proposed a reduction of only $55 billion in his five-year, SI .6 trillion defense
spending plan. That would include a reduction in fiscal 1984, which starts
next Oct. I, of $11.3 billion, far less than cuts demanded by many Democrats
and some Republicans in Congress.
Reagan holds to budget
Washington — While reluctantly endorsing standby tax increases as an
"insurance policy" to check soaring federal deficits in the future. President
Reagan has staunchly held last to other basic elements of his economic pro
gram, demanding a virtual freeze on non-defense spending while insisting on
al4 percent expansion for the Pentagon. _
The president also served notice in his State of the Union
message last night that he will fight to retain the 10 percent tax
cut scheduled to take effect July I, as well as the provision to be
gin indexing taxes in 1985 to keep inflation from pushing tax
pavers into higher tax brackets.
But he tacitlv admitted failure in his effort to balance the feder
al budget bv 1984, the last year of his term. White House officials
said that the deficit will be more than $200 billion in the current
fiscal vear and is projected to reach $188 billion in the following
year even if all of Reagan's new austerity program should be
adopted bv Congress.
That flood of red ink, which reflects the severe recession and
the revenue-eroding impact of the $650 billion, three-year tax cut
enacted in 1981, would come on top of a record $110.7 billion
deficit for fiscal vear 1982, which ended last Sept. 30.
"The looming deficits that hang over us — and over America's
future — must be reduced," Reagan said in his address to a joint
session of Congress.
Both in his speech and in the proposal for standby taxes, Rea
gan demonstrated far deeper concern about the size of deficits
stemming from his budget than he did last year. In this he ap
peared to reflect the widespread apprehension among most econ
omists that deficits of the size now confronting the nation could
send interest rates climbing again and strangle hopes for eco
nomic recoverv.
While the president spoke of the standby tax increases as a last
resort, his advisers said that they were already counting on the
revenue — an estimated $120 billion to $150 billion over three
vears — to bring red-ink outlays down to the $100 billion range
by 1988.
"You could say that this is an insurance policy for the future
— a remedy that will be at hand if needed, but only resorted to if
absolutely necessary," Reagan told Congress.
Democrats push alternate plan
Washington — Democratic congressional leaders, brushing
aside President Reagan's plea for a bipartisan solution to the na
tion's economic crisis, said yesterday they would use their
strengthened position in the House and Republican re-election
jitters in the Senate to push for adoption of a Democratic alter
native to the Reagan plan.
Even before the president delivered his State of the Union
speech to Congress, two top Democratic leaders indicated that
Democrats would demand a major scaleback of the scheduled
July tax cut as the price for agreeing to delay Social Security cost
of-living increases and to freeze military pay.
The two leaders, Sen. Robert Byrd (D-W.Va.) and Rep. Jim
Wright (D-Tex.) suggested that Democrats would also press for
slower military growth and bigger jobs-creating programs than
contemplated bv Reagan and his congressional allies.
The stage is thus set for months of congressional confronta
tion and struggle over the course of the nation's fiscal policy —
an outlook that contrasts sharply with the blitzkreig effect
achieved bv the Reagan administration in previous years. And
challenges to Reagan's proposals will by no means be confined to
Democrats.
Republicans in both the House and the Senate are openly dis
agreeing with the president they once followed in almost perfect
unison. And Reagan's continued decline in the public opinion
polls is likely to increase the independence of congressional Re
publicans as the 1984 election draws closer.
Indeed, some Democrats discounted Reagan's call for
bipartisanship as a political necessity forced on the White House
by its weakened grip on Congress and the erosion of public sup
port for administration's economic program.
"The president has softened his partisan rhetoric," Rep. Vic
Fazio (D-Calif.) said. "The Republicans would like us to share
the blame with them now as they prepare for the next election."
Flexibility still possible in arms talks
Geneva, Switzerland — U.S. arms negotiator Paul Nitze said
yesterday the United States is "not locked into the zero option"
in talks with the Soviet Union on reducing intermediate-range
nuclear missiles in Europe.
His Soviet counterpart, meanwhile, warned that time was run
ning out for reaching a settlement at the Geneva talks, which are
to resume tomorrow after a two-month recess.
N itze, in response to a reporter's question, said he "certainly is
not locked into the zero option," under which the United States
has proposed the elimination of European-based nuclear mis
siles. "We are prepared to examine every kind of proposal that
secures the security interests of our NATO allies as well as
ourselves," he said.
But he said in prepared remarks on his arrival that in recent
talks with Reagan "the president reaffirmed his conviction that
the entire elimination of the most dangerous and destabilizing
class of intermediate range missiles on both the U.S. and Soviet
sides is the best way to achieve the peace and security which man
kind desires."
As recently as Friday in Washington, Nitze had refused to
speak about the negotiability of the zero option, which has been
the fundamental U.S. offer since the negotiations began Nov. 30,
1981.
Nitze privately explored a compromise on the zero option in
the summer with his counterpart, Yuli Kvitsinsky, but the pro
posal was rejected by Moscow and Washington. Nitze would not
say yesterday whether he would seek to resurrect that plan,
which reportedly would have set ceilings for U.S. and Soviet nu
clear missiles in Europe.
Summit hinges on Israeli withdrawal
Jerusalem —President Reagan is demanding an Israeli agree
ment to withdraw from Lebanon before he will settle on a date

lor his invitation to Prime Minister Menachem Begin to visit
Washington, a U.S. official said yesterday.
The Begin visit, which had tentatively been set for mid-Febru
arv, hinges not just on signs of progress in the troop withdrawal
talks with Lebanon but on achieving an agreement, said the of
ficial, who declined to be identified.
'The president said there is no purpose in meeting if the main
subject is going to be squabbling over minor details on Leba
non,' the official said, referring to a letter delivered to Begin
earlier this month. "He wants not just progress, but an agree
ment on withdrawal. .. . The president doesn't want to spend
time hashing out minor details."
The willingness of U.S. officials to confirm the content of the
Reagan letter also appeared to signal a deliberate decision by the
United States to step up the diplomatic pressure on Israel to re
duce its demands in the negotiations with Lebanon.
Asked about published reports that the administration is con
sidering economic and military aid sanctions against Israel, the
U.S. official said, "While people are not working in the language
of threats, persuasion does not seem to be working."
The official said that although U.S.-Israeli relations have gone
through a number of strains since the invasion of Lebanon last
June, the situation today is "far more serious than it was before."
The two countries, he said, "view the Lebanon negotiations from
very different perspectives."
Egypt tags Israel with "negative attitude"
Cairo, Egypt — Egypt yesteday accused Israel of deliberately
creating the impression that the process of normalization be
tween the two countries was not going well in order to extract
more concessions from Lebanon in the negotiations over the
withdrawal of Israeli forces.
Replying to Israeli accusations that Egypt was jeopardizing
the process by its negative attitude, Foreign Minister Kamal
Hassan Ali said both the United States and Israel knew the Egyp
tian government was implementing the 1979 Egyptian-Israeli
peace treaty "in a very honest way."
"But it is in the interest of Israel for the time being to show that
it is not going so well. Why? To show that the normalization with
Lebanon is a must and even to claim more agreements than was
had with Egypt in this respect. This is the main issue."
Ali's comments came in an interview with the Washington
Post on the eve of President Hosni Mubarak's state visit to
Washington for talks with President Reagan about the state of
U.S. efforts to get negotiations aimed at settlement of the Palesti
nian problem under way between Israel and Jordan.
The Egyptian leader is expected to urge President Reagan to
accelerate those efforts as well as to press harder for a speedy Is
raeli withdrawal from Lebanon before the next U.S. presidential
election campaign totally immobilizes his administration from
taking any decisive action.
Watt apologizes for remarks
Washington — Interior Secretary James Watt made a surprise
appearance before native American leaders yesterday to say he
was sorrv if he "caused hurt" when he pointed up the high rates
of alcolohism and other social ills among native Americans.
But he added, "I don't apologize for the message," and ad
vised the tribal leaders not to "muff the opportunity he had
created for native Americans to attack their problems.
Watt spoke at the opening session of the National Congress of
American Indians in an effort to set the record straight about a
controversial television interview which outraged many native
Americans.
In the interview. Watt said reservations showed the "failures
of socialism" and fostered the highest rates of joblessness,
divorce, alcoholism, drug addiction and social diseases in the
country.
Watt told the native Americans yesterday that his con
troversial comments had focused attention pn problems that
have been around for decades.
But Watt's attempt to make peace did not stop one group, the
National Tribal Chairmen's Association, from voting a short
time later to ask President Reagan to fire Watt, saying his com
ments indicated a "callous disregard" for native Americans.
Watt said he was making his appearance to clear up the "tre
mendous confusion" which he blamed on inaccurate news re
ports about his comments on the Satellite Program Network in
terview show.
"If mv words caused hurt, I apologize for that hurt, but I don't
apologize for the message," Watt said. "The Indian people have
been abused by the U.S. government for too many years and we
have got to bring about change."
Pope issues new church laws
Vatican City — Pope John Paul II gave Roman Catholics a
new code of church laws yesterday that probably lengthens the
process of marriage annulments for Americans, but opens more
administrative posts to women and requires attendance at Mass
on only two "holy days of obligation" instead of 10.
The first revision of the church's laws in 66 years also reduces
the grounds for automatic excommunication from 37 to seven,
including abortion, and incorporates the current pope's strong
views against the involvement of priests and nuns in politics.
The new code of 1752 canons, or laws, takes effect on Nov. 27,
the first Sundav of the Advent. Drafted by a 74-member com
mission over a 17-year period, it reflects the sweeping changes
called for bv the Second Vatican Council in 1962-65 and replaces
a 1917 code of 2,414 canons as the -ules for the 750 million fol
lowers of the Latin rite.
John Paul signed copies of the Sacrae Disciplinae Leges (Laws
of Sacred Discipline) in a 10-minute ceremony in the ornate Con
sistorv Hall of the Apostolic Palace on the 24th anniversary of
Pope John XXlll's announcement ordering the revision. There
were no speeches.
The code was in Latin and was not made available to the pub

lie. The Vatican said it could be months before translations are
released, but Vatican officials outlined key provisions at a news
conference.
A change pertinent to the rank and file allows Catholics to
choose cremation instead of burial.
The new code terminates an experiment in the United States
and Australia since 1970 that reduced the average time required
to obtain annulment of a marriage to about a year.
In another area, the revision recognizes the equality of laymen
and women and replaces the word "laymen" with "lay people."
France, U.S. sign treaty
Washington — Attorney General William Smith and Robert
Badinter, France's minister of justice, signed a treaty yesterday
that will permit Americans convicted of crimes in France and
Frenchmen convicted of violating U.S. laws to serve prison sen
tences in their homelands.
With 40 Americans currently serving sentences under French
law, mostly on narcotics charges on the Caribbean islands of
Martinique and Guadeloupe, Smith and other Department of
Justice officials said thev viewed the treaty as an important first
step toward updating the 1909 extradition pact that has strained
relations between the two countries.
Last summer, France refused to extradite to the United States
Vicken Tcharkhutian, sought bv the FBI in connection with two
Los Angeles-area bomb incidents last year. A French court ruled
that the 1909 treatv covers arson but not bomb-making, despite
U. S. protests that the devices allegedly linked to Tcharkhutian
were incendiarv bombs.
Infrared telescope soars
Vandenberg Air Force Base, Calif. — Like a 16th century ex
plorer setting out on a voyage of discovery to the New World, a
sophisticated astronomical observatory was sent into orbit last
night to survev a celestial landscape that is known to exist but has
vet to be completely mapped.
The observatory is the Infrared Astronomical Satellite, or
IRAS, a joint American-Dutch-British venture, and its goal is to
chart the realm of the infrared — basically low-temperature radi
ation.
At approximately 6:17 p.m. PST, the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration launched the satellite aboard a Delta
rocket. The skv was hidden by a thick deck of slate gray clouds
and darkness had fallen over this sprawling military base when
the first stage of the rocket ignited in dazzling flash of intense
white light.
The rocket rose quickly, piercing the clouds and backlighting
them in eerie kaleidoscopic patterns. In less than two minutes, it
was gone from the sight of a crowd of approximately 1000 special
visitors — many from Europe invited to witness the event at a
special viewing area just a few miles from the seaside launch com
plex.
The IRAS spacecraft was lofted into a 560-mile-high orbit
ringing the Earth's poles and preliminary indications from
NASA were that it was in good working order. The orbit was
chosen to preclude either the sun or the moon from shining their
light down into the super-cooled telescope at the core of the 12-
foot-long, 2400-pound observatory.
Soviets encircle Afghan city
Islamabad, Pakistan — Soviet and Afghan troops have sur
rounded the northern Afghan city of Mazar-I-Sharif where the
situation remains tense after some 15 Soviet civilian advisers
were captured there by rebels earlier this month, Western
diplomats disclosed here yesterday.
Citing information received from the Afghan capital, Kabul,
they said only known partisans of the regime are permitted to
leave Mazar-I-Sharif, while Soviet patrols have stepped up
searches of individual houses.
A number of women are reported to have been detained by So
viet authorities and held hostage in an effort to obtain informa
tion on the kidnapped advisers.
No precise details have been given on the fate of the captives,
who according to Soviet sources here were civilian technicians at
a large flour mill.
But reports of systematic house-to-house searches and the
strict control clamped on Mazar-I-Sharif suggest that Soviet au
thorities believe thev are still being held in the city.
Two resistance groups, the Jamiat Islami and the Haraqat,
have each claimed responsibility for the abductions.
Stocks rebound
New York — Computer and other technology issues led a
broad rise in stock prices in moderate trading yesterday that
helped the market recover quickly from its drubbing in the pre
vious session.
Airline, retail, auto, mining and drug issues also paced the ad
vance, but several energy stocks lost more ground.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which Monday fell
22.81 points for its worst decline since last October, climbed
11.86 points to 1042.03.
Gainers led losers 2 to I on the New York Stock Exchange,
whose composite index rose 0.90 to 81.82.
Big Board volume slowed to 79.74 million shares from 90.80
million on Monday.
Today's weather
High wind warning and rain today. Heavy at times, and gusty
southerly winds to 50 mph. Highs in the upper 50s to low 60s.
Rain diminishing tonight and tomorrow to scattered showers.
Decreasing winds. Lows in the upper 40s to low 50s and highs in
