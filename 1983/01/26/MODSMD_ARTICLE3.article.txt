Reagan urges spending freeze, warns of deficits
Washington — President Reagan declared last night in a sobering State of
the Union message that runaway deficits pose "a clear and present danger"
to the Republic and called for a federal spending freeze and standby tax in
creases that could be imposed in two years.
Addressing a joint session of Congress, Reagan urged that the six-month
freeze in cost-of-living adjustments recommended by a bi-partisan Social Se
curity Commission also be applied to other government-related retirement
programs.
He said he would also propose to Congress a one-year freeze on a broad
range of domestic spending programs, and on pay raises for federal civilian
workers and military personnel.
"I know this is strong medicine," the president said of his proposed spend
ing freeze, "but so far we have only cut the rate of increase in federal spend
ing. The government has continued to spend more money each year, though
not as much as it did in the past.
"Taken as a whole, the budget 1 am proposing for the next fiscal year will
increase no more than the rate of inflation — in other words, the federal gov
ernment will hold the line on real spending.
The president also said in his nationally televised address that he would
ask Congress to adopt specific measures to deal with the growth of so-called
uncontrollable spending programs, such as food stamps. He said such pro
grams had grown bv more than 4(X) percent since 1 970 and were "the largest,
single cause of the built-in or "structural deficit problem.
Reagan exempted his huee defense spending program from the freeze pro
posal, declaring that "we will not gamble with our national survival." He
proposed a reduction of only $55 billion in his five-year, SI .6 trillion defense
spending plan. That would include a reduction in fiscal 1984, which starts
next Oct. I, of $11.3 billion, far less than cuts demanded by many Democrats
and some Republicans in Congress.
Reagan holds to budget
Washington — While reluctantly endorsing standby tax increases as an
"insurance policy" to check soaring federal deficits in the future. President
Reagan has staunchly held last to other basic elements of his economic pro
gram, demanding a virtual freeze on non-defense spending while insisting on
al4 percent expansion for the Pentagon. _
