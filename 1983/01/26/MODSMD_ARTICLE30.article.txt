Med School funds research
The School of Medicine is now funding re
search in the areas of the effect of psy
chological stress on the immune system, the
molecular biology of sleeping sickness, the
physiology of epilepsy and other topics.
Each of the ten young scientists chosen for
the grants was awarded $5000 from the
Biomedical Research Support Grant, pro
vided by the National Institutes of Health
twice a year and administered by a Univer
sity faculty member.
The grants, which are awarded to young
scientists, are designed to help them estab
lish research programs in areas of basic and
clinical research.
The assistant professors and their projects
are:
•John Boothroyd, medical microbiology,
will study the parasites that cause sleeping
sickness in humans. Especially, he will look
at the genes that control the changing pro
tein pattern which is a result of the disease
and is responsible for the sickness.
•Jane Parnes, medicinemmunology, will
look at genes as they relate to the human im
mune system. Parnes will try to determine
the role the proteins play in enabling the
white blood cells that control the immune
system.to battle infections.
•Christopher Coe, psychiatry, will study
the effects of psychological stress on im
mune responses. Coe said, "Although it is
generally acknowledged that stress can com
promise resistance to disease, further in
vestigastion is still needed to determine how
different types of stress affect specific
aspects of immune responses.
•Barrv Connors, neurology, plans to in
vestigate the electrical impulses that trigger
epileptic seizures. He will also study the
smaller impulses that are found in the nerve
cells of epileptics but do not cause seizures.
He aims to find out more about the chemical
and electrical interactions that cause this dis
ease.
•Fredric Kraemer, nephrology, will con
sider the way that hormones regulate the
clogging of the arteries with fatty cells, a
condition called atherosclerosis.
• Edward Mocarski, medical micro
biology, will study the replication of DNA in
a variety of herpes that can cause severe
damage to people with suppressed immune
systems.
•Fred Mihm, anesthesia, plans to study a

new method of monitoring the level of ox
ygen in a patient's bloodstream in order to
aid respirarotv therapy.
• Kevin Fish, anesthesia, will investigate
the effects of other drugs given during
anesthesia.
•Paul Ponganis, anesthesia, will consider
the effects of anesthetic agents on muscle
contraction. He will investigate the effects of
volatile drugs on postoperative patients.
• Andrew Hoffman, medicine
ndocrinology, will look at the effects on the
pituitary gland of chemical messengers to
the brain. He said that he chose the pituitary
gland because of the reactions that it has to
stress.
Cohen endows fund
Stanley Cohen, the co-inventor of the new
gene splicing technique, has agreed to give
the royalties from his patent to a fund that
will help pay for postdoctoral fellowships.
Dominick Purpura, dean of the School of
Medicine, made the announcement on Jan.
19.
Named after Cohen's father, the Bernard
Cohen Fellowship Fund already has a
$150,000 endowment that is intended to
"provide long-term support for post-doc
toral trainees" at the University, according
to Cohen.
Students in both the School of Medicine
and the biologv department will be able to
apply for funds, which are controlled by the
liean's Fellowship Fund committee.
The 73 genetic engineering firms who are
authorized to use the techniques described in
the Cohen /Boyer patent have made $1.4
million in gross revenue since 1980 when the
patent was issued.
Cohen is contributing his personal share
for the seed monev for the endowment.

Cohen developed the technique with
Herbert Boyer of UC-San Francisco in or
der to rearrange the genes of common bac
teria.
Cohen and Bover were able to invent a
way to replicate genes that carry desired
traits within a microorganism.
This procedure also allows scientists to to
build "bacterial factories" which can mass
produce needed medical products, such as
insulin, human growth hormone or anti-vir
al drugs.
Although the Patent Office has yet to ap
prove a second patent, the decision by the of
fice will not affect the revenues from the first
patent.
Bernard Cohen, born in Perth Amboy,
New Jersey, was a merchant who was also
interested in science.
Kennedy defends schools
University President Donald Kennedy de
fended public service in front of the Califor
nia School Superintendents Association
Thursday, Jan. 20, in Monterey.
"It seems only yesterday that the very best
young people 1 taught at Stanford were com
mitting themselves to spend time in the
Peace Corps, thinking about working in
public health, and asking about the Foreign
Service examinations.
"On our campus, at least, that spirit isn't
dead, but I do have to confess that it's a lot
less visible."
He called teachers the most visible public
servants.
The defeat of school bond issues and pas
sage of measures like Proposition 13 reflect
widespread loss of public faith in the
schools.
"Bv punishing the schools for not doing
what we want, we make them worse," Ken

nedy said. "It is a strange system of dis
cipline."
Kennedy has launched a University study
with cooperation from several nearby school
districts, including Milpitas, Mountain
View-Los Altos, San Francisc, San Jose and
San Mateo.
In addition, UC-Berkeley and Yale are
moving to support the schools.
"I hope we can encourage stronger com
mitments on the part of the private com
mercial sector in the future of the schools."
Hospital considers cutbacks
Department heads at the University's
Hospital were told how they could help re
duce staffing costs by temporarily reducing
workdays or work weeks.
However, Sheldon King, executive vice
president and director of the hosital, said
that no employees are being laid off their
jobs. He said,"We want to do everything
possible to avoid layoffs."
A low patient census has caused the hospi
tal to enact these plans for reduction. King
also said that the ec&nomy has not helped
the Hospital because people needing elective
surgery are holding off or keeping hospital
stays as brief as possible.
The problems at the hospital reflect the
state-wide decrease in hospital use.This
trend started in 1980 according to a report
issued by the California Health Facilities
Commission. The number of patients dis
charged from hospitals in Santa Clara
County was down 3.3 percent from October
1981 to October 1982. The number of pa
tient days was down 9 percent for the same
time period.
These decreases have caused certain facil
ities at the Hospital to be shut down and
some employees have been asked to take off
additional days.
Although the hospital is still waiting to
find out whether or not it has been awarded
a contract to serve Medi-Cal patients, the
new reductions are not related to the out
come of these negotiations.
If the University does not receive more pa
tients or the Medi-Cal contract, there may
be further reductions necessary. These
would be in the form of specific monetary re
ductions, said King.
Some departments, such as housekeeping,
nursing, respiratory therapy and others,
have already began their cutbacks. Some of
the more than 1400 nurses have been asked
to take additional days off.
The new guidlines are designed to help
each department reduce jobs in a manner
that is suitable for each.
Employees will be given at least two weeks
notice before they are asked to reduce their
work schedule, according to King. They will
be abe to use their allotment of Paid Time
Off (PTO) as well as absent leave to cover the
additional days off.
Employee benefits will not be altered, al

though some employees will no longer be
technically eligible for the benefits.
Before any plans are officially introduced
to employees, the suggestions will be pre
sented to the Director of Personnel and oth
er administrators.
Ideas that could be implemented by de
partment directors include: extending job
vacancy periods, increased scheduling of
PTO or absent leave or alerting employees
before they come in if they will not be
needed.
If voluntary employee participation does
not work, directors may be forced to use
mandatory reductions, perhaps based on
seniority.
Researchers enter contest
The 1983 General Motors Business Un
derstanding Program will investigate the
"impact of increased technology on the roles
and responsibilities of labor and man
agement in industry."
The competition this year will be between
11 different schools with the University's re
search team led bv Prof. Michael Hannan.
The group of graduate students will be com
peting for a $10,000 prize.
The entries must include both an oral and
a written presentation. A major part of the
challenge will be constructing a discussion
on the "impact of high technology on corpo
rate and organizational structures and how
labor and management should adapt to this
trend.
Irving Bluestone, professor of industrial
relations at Wayne State University and
former United Auto Workers (UAW) vice
president; Dr Daniel Bell, professor of soci
ology at Harvard University; and David
Packard, co-founder and chairman of the
board of Hewlett Packard Corporation will
be judging the entries.
The oral presentation will be given on
campus in April and the written material will
be submitted later in Detroit.
The winning team will be allowed to send
representatives to Detroit in May where they
will present their ideas to GM management
and UAW representatives.
Other schools participating in the pro
gram are Boston College, Boston Univer
sity, Brown University, Indiana Univerisity,
Michigan State University, UC-Los Angel
es, University of Illinois, Champaign-Ur
bana, University of Michigan, University of
Minnesota and Vanderbilt University.

Dominick Purpura, dean of the School of
Medicine, made the announcement on Jan.
19.
Named after Cohen's father, the Bernard
Cohen Fellowship Fund already has a
$150,000 endowment that is intended to
"provide long-term support for post-doc
toral trainees" at the University, according
to Cohen.
Students in both the School of Medicine
and the biologv department will be able to
apply for funds, which are controlled by the
liean's Fellowship Fund committee.
The 73 genetic engineering firms who are
authorized to use the techniques described in
the Cohen /Boyer patent have made $1.4
million in gross revenue since 1980 when the
patent was issued.
Cohen is contributing his personal share
for the seed monev for the endowment.

Cohen developed the technique with
Herbert Boyer of UC-San Francisco in or
der to rearrange the genes of common bac
teria.
Cohen and Bover were able to invent a
way to replicate genes that carry desired
traits within a microorganism.
This procedure also allows scientists to to
build "bacterial factories" which can mass
produce needed medical products, such as
insulin, human growth hormone or anti-vir
al drugs.
Although the Patent Office has yet to ap
prove a second patent, the decision by the of
fice will not affect the revenues from the first
patent.
Bernard Cohen, born in Perth Amboy,
New Jersey, was a merchant who was also
interested in science.
Kennedy defends schools
University President Donald Kennedy de
fended public service in front of the Califor
nia School Superintendents Association
Thursday, Jan. 20, in Monterey.
"It seems only yesterday that the very best
young people 1 taught at Stanford were com
mitting themselves to spend time in the
Peace Corps, thinking about working in
public health, and asking about the Foreign
Service examinations.
"On our campus, at least, that spirit isn't
dead, but I do have to confess that it's a lot
less visible."
He called teachers the most visible public
servants.
The defeat of school bond issues and pas
sage of measures like Proposition 13 reflect
widespread loss of public faith in the
schools.
"Bv punishing the schools for not doing
what we want, we make them worse," Ken

nedy said. "It is a strange system of dis
cipline."
Kennedy has launched a University study
with cooperation from several nearby school
districts, including Milpitas, Mountain
View-Los Altos, San Francisc, San Jose and
San Mateo.
In addition, UC-Berkeley and Yale are
moving to support the schools.
"I hope we can encourage stronger com
mitments on the part of the private com
mercial sector in the future of the schools."
Hospital considers cutbacks
Department heads at the University's
Hospital were told how they could help re
duce staffing costs by temporarily reducing
workdays or work weeks.
However, Sheldon King, executive vice
president and director of the hosital, said
that no employees are being laid off their
jobs. He said,"We want to do everything
possible to avoid layoffs."
A low patient census has caused the hospi
tal to enact these plans for reduction. King
also said that the ec&nomy has not helped
the Hospital because people needing elective
surgery are holding off or keeping hospital
stays as brief as possible.
The problems at the hospital reflect the
state-wide decrease in hospital use.This
trend started in 1980 according to a report
issued by the California Health Facilities
Commission. The number of patients dis
charged from hospitals in Santa Clara
County was down 3.3 percent from October
1981 to October 1982. The number of pa
tient days was down 9 percent for the same
time period.
These decreases have caused certain facil
ities at the Hospital to be shut down and
some employees have been asked to take off
additional days.
Although the hospital is still waiting to
find out whether or not it has been awarded
a contract to serve Medi-Cal patients, the
new reductions are not related to the out
come of these negotiations.
If the University does not receive more pa
tients or the Medi-Cal contract, there may
be further reductions necessary. These
would be in the form of specific monetary re
ductions, said King.
Some departments, such as housekeeping,
nursing, respiratory therapy and others,
have already began their cutbacks. Some of
the more than 1400 nurses have been asked
to take additional days off.
The new guidlines are designed to help
each department reduce jobs in a manner
that is suitable for each.
Employees will be given at least two weeks
notice before they are asked to reduce their
work schedule, according to King. They will
be abe to use their allotment of Paid Time
Off (PTO) as well as absent leave to cover the
additional days off.
Employee benefits will not be altered, al

though some employees will no longer be
technically eligible for the benefits.
Before any plans are officially introduced
to employees, the suggestions will be pre
sented to the Director of Personnel and oth
er administrators.
Ideas that could be implemented by de
partment directors include: extending job
vacancy periods, increased scheduling of
PTO or absent leave or alerting employees
before they come in if they will not be
needed.
If voluntary employee participation does
not work, directors may be forced to use
mandatory reductions, perhaps based on
seniority.
Researchers enter contest
The 1983 General Motors Business Un
derstanding Program will investigate the
"impact of increased technology on the roles
and responsibilities of labor and man
agement in industry."
The competition this year will be between
11 different schools with the University's re
search team led bv Prof. Michael Hannan.
The group of graduate students will be com
peting for a $10,000 prize.
The entries must include both an oral and
a written presentation. A major part of the
challenge will be constructing a discussion
on the "impact of high technology on corpo
rate and organizational structures and how
labor and management should adapt to this
trend.
Irving Bluestone, professor of industrial
relations at Wayne State University and
former United Auto Workers (UAW) vice
president; Dr Daniel Bell, professor of soci
ology at Harvard University; and David
Packard, co-founder and chairman of the
board of Hewlett Packard Corporation will
be judging the entries.
The oral presentation will be given on
campus in April and the written material will
be submitted later in Detroit.
The winning team will be allowed to send
representatives to Detroit in May where they
will present their ideas to GM management
and UAW representatives.
Other schools participating in the pro
gram are Boston College, Boston Univer
sity, Brown University, Indiana Univerisity,
Michigan State University, UC-Los Angel
es, University of Illinois, Champaign-Ur
bana, University of Michigan, University of
Minnesota and Vanderbilt University.


Stanley Cohen
Med School funds research
The School of Medicine is now funding re
search in the areas of the effect of psy
chological stress on the immune system, the
molecular biology of sleeping sickness, the
physiology of epilepsy and other topics.
Each of the ten young scientists chosen for
the grants was awarded $5000 from the
Biomedical Research Support Grant, pro
vided by the National Institutes of Health
twice a year and administered by a Univer
sity faculty member.
The grants, which are awarded to young
scientists, are designed to help them estab
lish research programs in areas of basic and
clinical research.
The assistant professors and their projects
are:
•John Boothroyd, medical microbiology,
will study the parasites that cause sleeping
sickness in humans. Especially, he will look
at the genes that control the changing pro
tein pattern which is a result of the disease
and is responsible for the sickness.
•Jane Parnes, medicinemmunology, will
look at genes as they relate to the human im
mune system. Parnes will try to determine
the role the proteins play in enabling the
white blood cells that control the immune
system.to battle infections.
•Christopher Coe, psychiatry, will study
the effects of psychological stress on im
mune responses. Coe said, "Although it is
generally acknowledged that stress can com
promise resistance to disease, further in
vestigastion is still needed to determine how
different types of stress affect specific
aspects of immune responses.
•Barrv Connors, neurology, plans to in
vestigate the electrical impulses that trigger
epileptic seizures. He will also study the
smaller impulses that are found in the nerve
cells of epileptics but do not cause seizures.
He aims to find out more about the chemical
and electrical interactions that cause this dis
ease.
•Fredric Kraemer, nephrology, will con
sider the way that hormones regulate the
clogging of the arteries with fatty cells, a
condition called atherosclerosis.
• Edward Mocarski, medical micro
biology, will study the replication of DNA in
a variety of herpes that can cause severe
damage to people with suppressed immune
systems.
•Fred Mihm, anesthesia, plans to study a

new method of monitoring the level of ox
ygen in a patient's bloodstream in order to
aid respirarotv therapy.
• Kevin Fish, anesthesia, will investigate
the effects of other drugs given during
anesthesia.
•Paul Ponganis, anesthesia, will consider
the effects of anesthetic agents on muscle
contraction. He will investigate the effects of
volatile drugs on postoperative patients.
• Andrew Hoffman, medicine
ndocrinology, will look at the effects on the
pituitary gland of chemical messengers to
the brain. He said that he chose the pituitary
gland because of the reactions that it has to
stress.

workdays or work weeks.
However, Sheldon King, executive vice
president and director of the hosital, said
that no employees are being laid off their
jobs. He said,"We want to do everything
possible to avoid layoffs."
A low patient census has caused the hospi
tal to enact these plans for reduction. King
also said that the ec&nomy has not helped
the Hospital because people needing elective
surgery are holding off or keeping hospital
stays as brief as possible.
The problems at the hospital reflect the
state-wide decrease in hospital use.This
trend started in 1980 according to a report
issued by the California Health Facilities
Commission. The number of patients dis
charged from hospitals in Santa Clara
County was down 3.3 percent from October
1981 to October 1982. The number of pa
tient days was down 9 percent for the same
time period.
These decreases have caused certain facil
ities at the Hospital to be shut down and
some employees have been asked to take off
additional days.
Although the hospital is still waiting to
find out whether or not it has been awarded
a contract to serve Medi-Cal patients, the
new reductions are not related to the out
come of these negotiations.
If the University does not receive more pa
tients or the Medi-Cal contract, there may
be further reductions necessary. These
would be in the form of specific monetary re
ductions, said King.
Some departments, such as housekeeping,
nursing, respiratory therapy and others,
have already began their cutbacks. Some of
the more than 1400 nurses have been asked
to take additional days off.
The new guidlines are designed to help
each department reduce jobs in a manner
that is suitable for each.
Employees will be given at least two weeks
notice before they are asked to reduce their
work schedule, according to King. They will
be abe to use their allotment of Paid Time
Off (PTO) as well as absent leave to cover the
additional days off.
Employee benefits will not be altered, al

though some employees will no longer be
technically eligible for the benefits.
Before any plans are officially introduced
to employees, the suggestions will be pre
sented to the Director of Personnel and oth
er administrators.
Ideas that could be implemented by de
partment directors include: extending job
vacancy periods, increased scheduling of
PTO or absent leave or alerting employees
before they come in if they will not be
needed.
If voluntary employee participation does
not work, directors may be forced to use
mandatory reductions, perhaps based on
seniority.
Researchers enter contest
The 1983 General Motors Business Un
derstanding Program will investigate the
"impact of increased technology on the roles
and responsibilities of labor and man
agement in industry."
The competition this year will be between
11 different schools with the University's re
search team led bv Prof. Michael Hannan.
The group of graduate students will be com
peting for a $10,000 prize.
The entries must include both an oral and
a written presentation. A major part of the
challenge will be constructing a discussion
on the "impact of high technology on corpo
rate and organizational structures and how
labor and management should adapt to this
trend.
Irving Bluestone, professor of industrial
relations at Wayne State University and
former United Auto Workers (UAW) vice
president; Dr Daniel Bell, professor of soci
ology at Harvard University; and David
Packard, co-founder and chairman of the
board of Hewlett Packard Corporation will
be judging the entries.
The oral presentation will be given on
campus in April and the written material will
be submitted later in Detroit.
The winning team will be allowed to send
representatives to Detroit in May where they
will present their ideas to GM management
and UAW representatives.
Other schools participating in the pro
gram are Boston College, Boston Univer
sity, Brown University, Indiana Univerisity,
Michigan State University, UC-Los Angel
es, University of Illinois, Champaign-Ur
bana, University of Michigan, University of
Minnesota and Vanderbilt University.


Stanley Cohen
Med School funds research
The School of Medicine is now funding re
search in the areas of the effect of psy
chological stress on the immune system, the
molecular biology of sleeping sickness, the
physiology of epilepsy and other topics.
Each of the ten young scientists chosen for
the grants was awarded $5000 from the
Biomedical Research Support Grant, pro
vided by the National Institutes of Health
twice a year and administered by a Univer
sity faculty member.
The grants, which are awarded to young
scientists, are designed to help them estab
lish research programs in areas of basic and
clinical research.
The assistant professors and their projects
are:
•John Boothroyd, medical microbiology,
will study the parasites that cause sleeping
sickness in humans. Especially, he will look
at the genes that control the changing pro
tein pattern which is a result of the disease
and is responsible for the sickness.
•Jane Parnes, medicinemmunology, will
look at genes as they relate to the human im
mune system. Parnes will try to determine
the role the proteins play in enabling the
white blood cells that control the immune
system.to battle infections.
•Christopher Coe, psychiatry, will study
the effects of psychological stress on im
mune responses. Coe said, "Although it is
generally acknowledged that stress can com
promise resistance to disease, further in
vestigastion is still needed to determine how
different types of stress affect specific
aspects of immune responses.
•Barrv Connors, neurology, plans to in
vestigate the electrical impulses that trigger
epileptic seizures. He will also study the
smaller impulses that are found in the nerve
cells of epileptics but do not cause seizures.
He aims to find out more about the chemical
and electrical interactions that cause this dis
ease.
•Fredric Kraemer, nephrology, will con
sider the way that hormones regulate the
clogging of the arteries with fatty cells, a
condition called atherosclerosis.
• Edward Mocarski, medical micro
biology, will study the replication of DNA in
a variety of herpes that can cause severe
damage to people with suppressed immune
systems.
•Fred Mihm, anesthesia, plans to study a

new method of monitoring the level of ox
ygen in a patient's bloodstream in order to
aid respirarotv therapy.
• Kevin Fish, anesthesia, will investigate
the effects of other drugs given during
anesthesia.
•Paul Ponganis, anesthesia, will consider
the effects of anesthetic agents on muscle
contraction. He will investigate the effects of
volatile drugs on postoperative patients.
• Andrew Hoffman, medicine
ndocrinology, will look at the effects on the
pituitary gland of chemical messengers to
the brain. He said that he chose the pituitary
gland because of the reactions that it has to
stress.
Cohen endows fund
Stanley Cohen, the co-inventor of the new
gene splicing technique, has agreed to give
the royalties from his patent to a fund that
will help pay for postdoctoral fellowships.
Dominick Purpura, dean of the School of
Medicine, made the announcement on Jan.
19.
Named after Cohen's father, the Bernard
Cohen Fellowship Fund already has a
$150,000 endowment that is intended to
"provide long-term support for post-doc
toral trainees" at the University, according
to Cohen.
Students in both the School of Medicine
and the biologv department will be able to
apply for funds, which are controlled by the
liean's Fellowship Fund committee.
The 73 genetic engineering firms who are
authorized to use the techniques described in
the Cohen /Boyer patent have made $1.4
million in gross revenue since 1980 when the
patent was issued.
Cohen is contributing his personal share
for the seed monev for the endowment.

Cohen developed the technique with
Herbert Boyer of UC-San Francisco in or
der to rearrange the genes of common bac
teria.
Cohen and Bover were able to invent a
way to replicate genes that carry desired
traits within a microorganism.
This procedure also allows scientists to to
build "bacterial factories" which can mass
produce needed medical products, such as
insulin, human growth hormone or anti-vir
al drugs.
Although the Patent Office has yet to ap
prove a second patent, the decision by the of
fice will not affect the revenues from the first
patent.
Bernard Cohen, born in Perth Amboy,
New Jersey, was a merchant who was also
interested in science.
Kennedy defends schools
University President Donald Kennedy de
fended public service in front of the Califor
nia School Superintendents Association
Thursday, Jan. 20, in Monterey.
"It seems only yesterday that the very best
young people 1 taught at Stanford were com
mitting themselves to spend time in the
Peace Corps, thinking about working in
public health, and asking about the Foreign
Service examinations.
"On our campus, at least, that spirit isn't
dead, but I do have to confess that it's a lot
less visible."
He called teachers the most visible public
servants.
The defeat of school bond issues and pas
sage of measures like Proposition 13 reflect
widespread loss of public faith in the
schools.
"Bv punishing the schools for not doing
what we want, we make them worse," Ken

nedy said. "It is a strange system of dis
cipline."
Kennedy has launched a University study
with cooperation from several nearby school
districts, including Milpitas, Mountain
View-Los Altos, San Francisc, San Jose and
San Mateo.
In addition, UC-Berkeley and Yale are
moving to support the schools.
"I hope we can encourage stronger com
mitments on the part of the private com
mercial sector in the future of the schools."
