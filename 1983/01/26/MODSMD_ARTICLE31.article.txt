# Students collect refunds

### JASON COLE 
After one week of refunds, the
ASSU has returned more than $25,000
of approximately $164,000 in fee as
sessments, according to Student Finan
cial Manager Bob Brody.
At the present rate, the ASSU has
been refunding roughly 3 percent of
the total fee assessment revenues per
day. Brody projects that 31.5 percent
of the total will be reclaimed by stu
dents if this trend continues. Refunds
will end this Friday, Jan. 28.
Brody said that refunds were run
ning at a lower rate than last year, but
at a slightly higher rate than last quar
ter.
Brody indicated that thus far the
Chaparral seemed to be heading the list
of organizations hit by student refunds.
In reaction to this, Vincent Freda,
business manager for the Chaparral,
said, People evidently think we're
rich, probably because of the concerts.
They're not aware that we're not going
to go for another one if we get enough
from this one." Freda said that he
needed to see some figures before he
would become worried.
As usual, ASSU Legal Counseling
Office was the organization least af
fected by student refunds. The primary
reason for this, according to Brody, is
that students who take their fee as
sessment back forfeit their right to use
the service. Last quarter, the program
lost the least amount of any groups, 9
percent.
