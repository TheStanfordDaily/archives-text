# Despite some student protest
## ASSU approves McCloskey 
### STEVE TROUSDALE Staff writer 
Despite several students' objections and concern over his
academic qualifications, the ASSU Senate last night passed,
on a 13-2 vote with two abstentions, a resolution
giving the Guest Professorship Bureau approval to begin
negotiations to bring former Rep. Paul "Pete" McCloskey
here to teach this spring.
Criticism centered mostly on McCloskey's remarks con
cerning Jews.
"It's a slap in the face of the Jewish community here,"
Howard Goldberg told the senators.
Goldberg said he felt that the selection of McCloskey as a
guest professor "could be accepted as a legitimization" of
McCloskey's views.
As an example, Goldberg quoted McCloskey as saying
" 'It seems to me you can't have it two ways. You're either
an American for American policy or you're a Jew who puts
Israel ahead of the U.S.' " Such statements, he said, "cast
doubts on the ability of Jews to be loyal U.S. citizens."
However Seth Linfield, chairman of the Guest Professor
ship Bureau, defended the selection of McCloskey, who is
scheduled to teach a three-unit course tentatively titled The
Congressional Decisionmaking Process, 1964-1983.
"We think there is a real benefit in bringing a figure who
is controversial (to Stanford)," Linfield told the senators.
In answer to concern raised about McCloskey's accoun
tability in the classroom, Linfield said the senate could
withhold McCloskey's salary if necessary. Furthermore, he
commented that if a statement by McCloskey were consid
ered repugnant, its offensiveness would only strengthen the
force of the arguments of those opposed to McCloskey.
As undergraduate senator Mike Reeds said, "the worse
that (a repugnant remark) is, the better it will be (for
McCloskey's opponents)."

Questions were also raised about McCloskey's close ties
to the University.
"The Guest Professorship Bureau should not give an
honorarium to one of our more frequent visitors,"
Goldberg said, citing the fact that McCloskey had been on
campus to speak six times last quarter.
However, David Marks, a member of the bureau who has
been supportive of McCloskey, said that the senate should
not "penalize him for that."
Because concern existed, both among senators and the
students, about McCloskey's academic qualifications, Lin
field also discussed the criteria used by the bureau in select
ing guest professors and called it "so demanding and so
rigorous that there are perhaps 50 individuals in the U.S.
who can fulfill them."
According to Linfield. the three criteria include:
• The course should be a rigorous academic course. (L.in
field said that the class is "supposed to be and will be a
valuable learning experience for students at Stanford.")
• The guest professor should be recognized as an expert
in his area. (However, John Adelstein, one of those oppos
ing McCloskey's selection, said that he thought "we can do
a heck of a lot better" in the quality of teachers attracted to
campus through the guest professor program.)
• The guest professor should be well-known or popular.
Now that it has received preliminary senate approval, the
bureau will conduct negotiations with McCloskey on pay
ment and finishing the course's syllabus, which was pre
sented in its tentative form at the meeting last night.
Adelstein said that he would "try to get out most refer
ences to the Middle East and references to the Yom Kippur
War" from the syllabus, saying that in his opinions these are
areas in which McCloskey is not an expert.
