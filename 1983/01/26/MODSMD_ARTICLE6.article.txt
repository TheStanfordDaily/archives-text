# Job searching intensifies at CPPC
## 
### KIMBERLY BROWN Senior Staff Writer 
A two-foot-long metal bar slides into position behind the
main doors of the Career Planning and Placement Center
(CPPC) every day at closing time. As seniors plunge into
the job search and even underclassmen compete for sum
mer internship "experiences," one would assume the bar
barricades the CPPC against over-zealous students.
But according to associate director Ruth Schneider the
bar is left over from the days in the late '60s when the CPPC
was the most unpopular place on campus. "This was the
time when anyone interested in working for business whis
pered it,"Schneider said.
In contrast to their rebel predecessors, students today
place bids for corporate interviews in an orderly, systematic
manner and arrive for the appointments clean, confident
and eager to impress.
But many companies, badly clawed by the 1982 reces
sion, face the coming year with caution.
"I'd like to think there are jobs for everyone," said Chris
topher Shinkman, CPPC director, "but as a realist, I believe
students are going to have to be more aggressive in their job
searches."
"Students should keep in mind that they have a big edge
over the competition and arc eminently employable — but
they will have to invest more time in the job search." he
said.
There are numerous indications that students are adopt
ing a more competitive attitude toward the career-search
process. Attendance at the CPPCs various self-help work
shops on job hunting, resume writing and interviewing is up
over previous years. Career counselors now have to
schedule appointments with students days ahead of time,
and more people are registering earlier.
Shinkman attributes students' increased concern to the
state of the economy and to headlines which blast new
unemployment figures almost daily, predicting further
labor cuts at both the unskilled and middle-management
levels.

Both Shinkman and Schneider said they think this con
cern is healthy — and not a sign of paranoia sweeping the
campus. "It is simply a reality that people today know they
will have to prepare themselves for what comes next be
cause they aren't going to be here forever," Schneider said.
"This explains the increased interest in internships and in
gaining concrete experience."
Nonetheless, their healthy concern appears well founded.
Even though the CPPC is only half-way through the on
campus interviewing season, an "unusually large number of
companies have cancelled their interviews this year,"
Shinkman said.
At the same time, Stanford is one of the last places most
will strike from their interview schedules. Although some
banking firms have cancelled in recent weeks, most no
shows have been heavy-industry companies where hiring
freezes arc still taking their toll.
The bid system — in which students are allotted 1000
points to bid for space on interview schedules of their choice
— has required students to be more selective. Previously , it
was possible for a person to talk with almost any firm that
sounded interesting, though obtaining interviews with the
most prestigious companies was often a matter of being in
line at 4 a.m.
Shinkman said the new bid system has also benefited
students by making campus interviews more productive, as
students arc better prepared and more certain about their
reasons for talking to a particular employer.
Still. CPPC counselors said that many students have ex
pressed concern that companies may be interviewing just
for the sake of "saving face." They sense an underlying
anxiety among students that perhaps the jobs are not there
and that firms are collecting resumes without any intention
of hiring.
Robert Mac Lean, manager of college recruiting at
Hewlett-Packard, said that it is difficult for companies to
predict hiring targets this early in the year but assuming
business conditions remain constant, "the hiring picture
