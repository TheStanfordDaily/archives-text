### STEVE TROUSDALE Staff writer 
The ASSU Senate last night passed
an altered version of an election reform
hill that had failed to gain approval last
quarter because it did not allow for
write-in candidates.
The new version of the bill permits
write-in candidates with certain restric
tions. Those write-in candidates
notified by the ASSU elections com
mission of the possibility of their elec
tion must sign a declaration of intent
and a campaign practices code within
17 hours after the close of the election,
according to bill author Mike Reeds.
The bill also outlines the specific de
tails of the function of the elections
commission, defines the role of the
hearing committee for election griev
ances. directs that a campaign practices
code be written by the elections com
mission and details, step-by-step, the
actual process of voting from the open
ing and placement of polls to the vali
dation of the election and certification
of its results by the senate.
In other business, Rod Beckstrom,
member of the council of presidents
(COP), told the assembled senators
that an agreement had been reched
with William Massy, vice-president for
business and finance, declaring that
ASSU recycling did save the University
money on garbage removal costs and
setting the stage for the University to
pay the ASSU for disposal.
Previously, Jason Mavis, associate
vice-president of facilities and services,
had argued that recycling did not save
the University money because the Uni
versity would not have to pay extra
money to haul away the amount of gar
bage of which ASSU recycling pre
sently disposes.
Student Financial Manager Bob
Brody informed the senate that agree
ment had also been reached with the
University, subject to approval by Pro
vost Albert Hastorf, concerning the
amount of money they would give the
ASSU for costs associated with the
governance aspects of the ASSU. He
said that under this agreement the Uni
versity would pay between 75 to SO
percent of salaries for the COP and the
senate chair and deputy chair.
Beckstrom also informed the senate
that progress was continuing in obtain
ing a fee assessment for the Stanford
Committee on Political Education
(SCOPE), whose assessment was inad
vertently left off of a list of groups sub
mitted to the University listing organi
zations eligible to receive money this
year.
Beckstrom said that University offi
cials he had talked to considered
SCOPE'S plight unfortunate and dif
ficult; furthermore, he said that if the
University was not able to add the fee
assessment for spring quarter collec
tion "something would be done" to get
the money to the group The amount of
a fee assessment is approximately
$8000 to $10,000.
