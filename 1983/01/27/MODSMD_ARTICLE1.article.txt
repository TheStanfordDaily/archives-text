# Latest storm causes flooding, black-outs, shutdowns

### BOB COHN Staff writer 
A brutal Pacific storm struck North
ern California yesterday, dumping up
to a half-foot of rain and causing exten
sive flooding and other damages
throughout the Stanford area. Au
thorities said that more than half the
streets in Palo Alto and on campus
were closed at some point last night.
Power outages, downed trees and
rivers of rushing water in the streets
had both University and Palo Alto
crews working to clear the area in the
storm's wake. Don Shaw, batallion
chief at Palo Alto Fire Department,
estimated that clean-up "will take
days, especially the downed trees."
"We've got a full crew here to take
care of any emergency and as far as we
know there is nothing out of control,"
said Jason Mavis, associate vice presi
dent for University facilities and ser
vices. Mavis and Shaw each had 20 to
40 men working into the night.
The storm, the third in a string of six
slow-moving systems, prompted a wea
ther warning for the Sierras. Periods of
rain and showers are expected to con
tinue through Monday.
Shaw noted that "the high winds are
causing a lot of leaves and branches to
faii and plug up the (sewage) drains."
Additional flooding was caused by
"blockages down in the drainage sys
tem itself," he said.
A power failure closed Tresidder
Union until late today or tomorrow
morning, according to Ted Hoef, Tre
sidder's marketing coordinator. Power
went out just after 6 p.m. there and the
facility was immediately evacuated.
"We will not be able to open for busi
ness as usual until we get our main
power supply back," Hoef said, and he
stressed that there is a "strong possibil
ity" that power will not be totally re
stored until tomorrow.
"There was five feet of water in the
basement and it shorted out all the
fuses," said senior Dan Burgess, man
ager of Tresidder's Corner Pocket.
Hoef reported additional flooding in
the Recreation Center.
Tresidder expects to receive an
emergency generator this morning, at
which time repairs and clean-up can be
concluded. "To open back up and be
safe, we need all power bck," Hoef
said. "The building is not safe, espe
cially when you're not sure what can
happen with water and electrical
things."
Power outages also struck Roble
Hall and Lagunita Court for more than
two hours yesterday, between 2:50 and
4:55 p.m. "A branch from the trees by

Lake Lagunita dropped
on the power lines and
since it was so wet it blew
the circuit breakers,"
explained Roble Resi
dential Advisor Michael
Boennighausen.
A Great Works class
that meets in Roble con
tinued despite the lights
failure. Freshman Micka
Pike said, "We were dis
cussing the Dark Ages so
it was very appropriate."
Mavis said that the
drainage system is work
ing far beyond its normal
capacity. "We've had
four major storms now
and the earth is com
pletely saturated. The
storm sewers are clear
and open; there's just
too much water," he
said.
Flooding was reported
in a variety of campus
buildings, including
three inches of water in
the basement of Memo
rial Church. More than
six inchcs poured into
Wilbur Hall basement

for the second time this week.
"I was just putting my clothes in the
dryer when this wall of water rushed
into the laundry room," said sopho
more Stevo Anderson. "I ran back to
get my last load, but it came in really
fast. I was marooned by the washers."
Some took advantage of the abnor
mally heavy rains. Students were re
ported body surfing in fast-moving
water on Mayfield Ave. and swimming,
playing water polo, and even sailing in
waist-deep rainfall near Governor's
Corner.
Nobody has determined the financial
damages caused by the storm. "About
five engineers are out now assessing the
problems," said Mavis. "With 10 mil
lion square feet it will take some time."
Fallen trees destroyed a car. closed
Junipero Serra Blvd. along Lake
Lagunita between Campus East and
Campus West, and struck an Escon
dido low-rise. Workmen armed with
power chainsaws and high-liff'cherry
picker" trucks began clearing the de
bris immediately.
In Tresidder's parking lot a huge live
oak tree was blown over by the wind at
approximately 2 p.m., damaging three
unoccupied automobiles. A white Ford
Fairmont, rented at the airport only
two hours earlier by a man visiting the
University, received the brunt of the
weight and was nearlly totally ruined in
the accident.
In Escondido Village a grove of
eucalyptus trees swayed in the wind
and at least four fell at approximately 2
p.m. and thereafter. Kathy Plump, res
ident of Escondido 9D, said, "I just
heard a crack and came running out
and it (the tree) had landed on our
roof."
Plump was especially concerned be
cause some trees fell on the pathway
that the schoolchildren use, and school
was just letting out at the time of the
accident.
Elsewhere on campus, the wind tore
the aluminum siding from the south
side of Manzanita trailer 26Y, water
flooded many parking lots and nearly
every street, and countless window and
roof leaks were reported.
In the Bay Area, at least 100,000
homes lost power, according to Pacific
Gas and Electric Co. Pacific Telephone
reported 3000 phone circuits were out
due to the storm. High tides and heavy
winds combined with the rain to close
many bridges and streets, and many
area creeks were reported overflowing.

worked in the rain to remove the branches from the Tresidder parking
lot. Fallen trees elsewhere caused blackouts, telephone failures and road
blocks both on campus and throughout the Bay Area.

MAN THE OARS: Students last night
frolicked in a flooded field between the driving
range and Lake Lagunita. Activities included
water polo, sailing and swimming in the waist
deep water.
