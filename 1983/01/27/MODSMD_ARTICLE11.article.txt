## The 						Stanford Daily Once again: the semester 
### 
Like the growing number of presidential aspir
ants vying for election, several competitors crowd
the field to replace the aging and increasingly inef
fective semester system of scheduling the academic
year. And like an Adlai Stevenson to Ike, or
perhaps a Teddy Kennedy to nearly any Republi
can contender, the quarter system is the refined
candiate waiting in the wings to take on an en
crusted, aged and uncreative regime.
Barring some creative dark horse solution to the
scheduling conflict — a Mo Udall, say, in the form
of Colorado College's block system — the quarter
system is certainly the most attractive frontrunner.
The issues, however, concern course structure and
a Stanford education rather than national defense
or tears perhaps shed after primaries.
There are several issues of learning lodged bet
ween the layers of rehearsed argument. There are
very real advantages to having more than the 10-
week sprint from opening lecture to final exam,
with hurdles of a few books and a midterm or two
in between.
For courses concentrating upon reading and
writing, which are not as few and far between as the
research labs and talk of patents might suggest, the
semester system provides the chance for signific
antly more thorough treatment of subjects that
cannot be compressed into a handful of lectures or
discussions. Presentation of more material, and the
professor's ability to develop themes and original
interpretations more easily than under a quarter
system is only part of the semester system's advan
tage.
The greatest advantage of the semester schedule
is time for more than a cursory treatment of sub
jects often kicked around for decades, if not cen
turies. The educational ideal of students reacting

to material — of prodding and shaping ideas rather
than regurgitating them — cannot be realized
when students dwell on material only long enough
to master the facts and perhaps memorize a few
interpretations before confronting a series of pap
ers and examinations. While the weeks added by
the semester system will not turn gut reactions into
book award responses necessarily, they allow clas
ses to approach closer that ideal of critical thought.
Engineering classes could benefit from the
longer terms as much as humanities and social
science classes certainly would gain. Most of the
schools Stanford prefers to class itself with — and
which do as well in both sciences and humanities —
operate quite successfully on the semester system.
Only when education supercedes departmental
power struggles within the University can the ad
vantages of the semester system be recognized by
all disciplines.
Logistical concerns suggest that a semester sys
tem would be preferable to the current schedule.
Not only would substantial registration and book
keeping costs be reduced by switching to the
semester system (UC-Berkeley found this a per
suasive reason to change), but students could join
the rush for summer jobs on equal terms with the
hordes that finish in May.
Fundamentally, however, the choice of
schedules is a choice of how learning should take
place. Longer terms lend themselves to self
directed and extensive consideration of ideas,
while shorter terms — with their concentration of
tests and exposition — suggest a more coercive,
less reflective treatment of material to be mas
tered. Like the presidential sweepstakes, the issue
is before us again. But we have the choice: maybe
Stevenson would be better.
