# Food Service for thought

### 
University Food Service has faced criticism in
the past, with neither the food nor the system itself
missing the brunt of the attack. The complaints
about the food will probably never end, but maybe
something can be done to change the system.
Next fall's planned pay-for-what-you-eat exper
iment for residents of Sterling Quad will be a huge
step in the right direction. We hope to see con- ->
tinued experimentation within the food service
management to try to cut both wastes and costs.
We would hope to see even more initiatives
taken on the part of Food Service, especially re
garding row houses. The University reportedly
spent $140,000 subsidizing row houses operated
by Food Service last year. The University should
not shy away from trying to switch its row house
operations into more efficient self-ops.
To get these changes done, however, a new
philosophy is definitely needed on the part of Food
Service management. Last quarter both Food Ser
vice and an ASSU task force conducted surveys,
with each group coming up with differing results
concerning the pay-as-you-eat or "fee-for
service" plan.
The ASSU survey, which only reached 150 stu
dents, reports that students feel that they now eat
more than necessary and thus waste food and
money. They found student support for "fee-for
service."
The results of a University "responsiveness"
survey of 2000 students, which was conducted with
the aid of a paid professional consultant, have been
interpreted by Food Service personnel to show
that stqdents want to stay on their present plan in

which they pay one price for unlimited food. Ac
cording to Food Service Manager Maxine Ander
son, "surveys show that students don't want fee
for-seivice."
Anderson points to the Food Service survey in
which 88 percent of the respondents agreed that
"seconds should be continued" and 81 percent
disagreed that "individuals should pay extra for "
seconds."
If only such a conclusion were so easy to draw.
The wording differences between the two surveys
seem to have made the results a foregone conclu
sion.
The University survey question did not even
mention the pay-as-you-eat plan. It did not explain
that if such a plan were started students could be
paying less than their current plan. It never stated
that the seconds charge policy would be part of a
new plan and not an additional cost to the current
system.
On the subject of wording, admits Ed Scoles,
director of housing management," I think the Task
Force has a point that it could possibly be mis
construed. ... It might have been made more
clear."
The survey interpretation was not a step in the
right direction; the experimentation in Sterling
Quad will be. Currently Food Service seems to be
staggering about, taking a one-step forward, one
step backward approach. If its management would
only be willing consistently to seek change for the
better, improvement should not be far away.
