## Brutal oppression must be met with violence in South Africa 
### 
The views expressed in Jan Boyer's
column " Revolution no solution to
RSA" (Daily. Jan. 14). indicate a fun
damental misunderstanding of the na
ture of the white minority regime in
South Africa and of the practical means
available to bring about majority rule.
Bovcr recommends humanitarian
aid and foreign study programs as
methods of improving the economic
and educational status of black South
Africans. Presumably he believes such
efforts would eventually produce sig
nificant political change. In fact, pro
grams with these aims already exist
under the sponsorship of the United
Nations and other organizations. Un
fortunately. they alone cannot be ex
pected to overcome the entrenched ra
cism and the underlying social, political
and economic system which define
apartheid in South Africa.
The nature of the apartheid system is
best indicated by a look at recent
events in South Africa. State-owned
enterprises have refused to deal with
black labor unions. Hundreds of work
ers have been fired for attempting to
organi/c, their leaders have been jailed
and tortured. Detention without trial,
banning and banishment orders have
continued unabated; political prisoners
continue to die while in police custody.
Proposals aimed at limiting press free
dom are under consideration. En
forcement of laws designed to limit the
movement of blacks within so-called
white areas has been tightened. Defec
tions from the ruling National Party

signify a drift further to the right among
the white minority.
In recent years South Africa has
staged several raids into neighboring
black states. It has undertaken the
largest military build-up in its history,
and has gained nuclear capability. It
continues its occupation of the territory
of Namibia 12 years after the Interna
tional Court of Justice declared South
Africa's presence there to be illegal.
The above do not appear to represent
the actions of a regime paving the way
for dramatic, or even incremental, im
provement in the conditions faced by
black South Africans.
Boyer argues that efforts of the in
ternational black community — such as
opposition to a $1.1 billion Interna
tional Monetary Fund (IMF) loan —
aimed at economically isolating South
Africa are harmful. He paraphrases The
Wall Street Journal in saying that such
action is likely to hurt "the very people
it is intended to help" since without the
IMF loan domestic programs benefit
ing blacks probably would be cut. To
cite The Wall Street Journal, mouth
piece of corporate interests, as if the
well-being of the black majority is its
uppermost concern, is only slightly less
absurd than believing that the receipt
of IMF funds will have a significant
impact on the domestic program
priorities of the South African gov
ernment and the suffering it inflicts
upon the black majority.
Given the actions of the South Afri
can regime and its violation of interna
tional law and basic human rights, the

world community would be remiss if it
did not speak out in opposition to as
sistance which permits the smooth
functioning of that regime. Focusingat
tention on the activities of the South
African government and encouraging
corporate disinvestment (and tor that
matter, disinvestment of university en
dowment funds) impose international
pressures which can have a destabiliz
ing effect on the government.
Boyer bemoans the internationaliza
tion of South Africa's policies because
it may lead to these issues becoming em
broiled in broader East-West ideologi
cal disputes to the detriment of the par
ties directly concerned. A fundamental
error, so common in this Cold War era,
is made in linking the internationaliza
tion of any issue to the East-West con
flict. South African apartheid has been
internationalized, but not along
East-West lines. The socialist nations
of black Africa are not alone in believ
ing that the increasingly intransigent
stance of the white minority makes vio-

lent action the only viable option to
achieve majority rule — a wide range
of people representing views across the
political spectrum have come to this
conclusion.
While compromise in this situation is
desirable, it must be remembered that
a negotiated settlement was reached in
Zimbabwe only after a bitter seven
year war and the threat of further vio
lence made the alternative unpalata
ble. No one would deny that black
South Africans bear the greatest bur
den of suffering from any action, inter
nal or external, designed to bring about
majority rule. Well over 30 years of
diplomacy and negotiation on South
Africa's apartheid policies have
yielded little more than cosmetic
changes. If the international commu
nity regards seriously the struggle
against apartheid, the least it can do is
to support policies with some reason
able chance of success.
