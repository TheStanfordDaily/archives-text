# The 						sound and the fury
## Stylish president's disarray... 
### 
"I am not in disarray." So said Presi
dent Reagan last week, and comedians
and pundits across the country took up
the tune with an enthusiasm that has
not been seen since the caricature of
Richard Nixon's "1 am not a crook"
captured the imagination of the nation
as the perfect symbol of a beleaguered
president's ill-fated efforts to obscure
his role in Watergate from an inquisi
tive public. Once again, a president is
finding that his words fall on the ears of
an increasingly unreceptive audience
as it becomes ever more painfully obvi
ous that Reagan is indeed in disarray.
The recent accusations of disarray
leveled at Reagan stemmed from two
sets of events that highlight the two
most damaging failures of his administ
ration. The first of these is Reagan's
continuing failure to produce a viable
economic policy. Numerous news leaks

White House budget deliberations
prompted Reagan to claim that it was
the press, and not his presidency, that
was in disarray. At the same time, he
attempted once more to stop the flow
of unfavorable news leaks from within
his administration. Evidently, he found
these steps to cover up his floundering
budgetary process far simpler than the
alternative of actually coming up with a
credible budget without projecting a
deficit so large that it would shock the
economy into paralysis.
These efforts to escape responsibility
for the shortcomings of the budget that
Reagan will soon present to Congress
are merely the latest additions to what
has become an elaborate attempt to
evade responsibility for the worst
economic slump since the Great De
pression. The cornerstone of this effort
has been Reagan's repeated assertion
that he deserves credit for bringing
down inflation but that the recession is
entirely the fault of his predecessors.

This self-serving interpretation is wear
ing thin as it becomes obvious to the
public, as it has been to economists
from the very start, that the Federal
Reserve's tight money policy which in
fact brought down inflation has com
bined with Reagan's record-breaking
deficits to create the devastatingly high
interest rates that are behind the cur
rent recession. As Reagan's responsi
bility for the recession has become in
creasingly difficult to deny, he has in
itiated a new evasive tactic by claiming
that his economic program was never
fully implemented by Congress in the
first place. This assertion flies in the
face of the fact that Reagan has been
the most successful president with re
spect to passing programs through
Congress since Lyndon Johnson won
acceptance of Great Society programs
in the first two years of his presidency.
It also belies the optimistic pro-

nouncements of Reagan administra
tion officials in 1981 that he had won
"95 percent" of what he sought from
Congress. Clearly, Reagan's fight to
escape blame for the current recession
is a losing proposition.
The second set of events that
touched off the current debate over
Reagan's presidency relates to his
handling of arms control policy.
Reagan's dismissal of Eugene Rostow,
arms control and disarmament agency
director, came at a particularly inop
portune moment, renewing European
doubts over the seriousness of
Reagan's commitment to arms control
at a time when a critical election in
Germany is only a few weeks away.
Reports that Rostow was fired for pur
suing negotiations that would allow
both the Soviet Union and the United
States to retain some missiles in
Europe, an approach that has found
solid support from leaders in both Eng
land and Germany, instead of single

mindedly sticking to Reagan's prefer
red "zero-option," has created the im
pression that Reagan is an inflexible
and unrealistic negotiator who pre
sumes to know more about the security
needs of Europe than Europe does.
When the Soviet Union attempted to
capitalize on Reagan's erratic arms pol
icy by sending Foreign Minister
Gromyko to Germany, Reagan's re
sponse was predictably unenlightened
and inadequate. Rather than produc
ing a more flexible and reasonable
negotiating stance that Europe might
find acceptable, he put together a
commission headed not by an arms ex
pert but by a former advertising execu
tive, saying that the answer to Soviet
propaganda "is not propaganda. It's
public relations."
If the present state of affairs is any
indication, the historical judgment of
Reagan's presidency will be that it was
not an innovative and pragmatic ap
proach to the pressing issues of politics,
but an extended experiment in "public
relations." The emphasis on style over
substance pervades every action of the
Reagan administration — when Prime
Minister Nakasone of Japan came to
visit, Reagan initially scheduled only
two hours of talks with him to discuss*
the immensely complex trade and de
fense relations of the world's two
greatest economic powers Of the
Reagan-Nakasone talks, the most
memorable events were the photo ses
sions and Reagan's offer to send a
Japanese astronaut into space on an
American spaceship — a characteristi
cally Reaganesque form of "shuttle
diplomacy."
Such is the Reagan administration's
approach to complex political prob
lems that has led to the current sad
state of affairs. The statement of one
White House official is perhaps the
best summary of Reagan's presidency
halfway through his term: "There is
nothing wrong about our political dif
ficulties that an economic recovery and
an arms agreement with the Soviets
wouldn't solve." As The New York
Times recently noted, "That's like a
student saying, 'If I'd done the
homework I would have gotten an
A.' " Until and unless Reagan finally
does his homework, we can only give
him failing marks and hope that the
schoolhouse will survive until a better
student arrives in 1984
