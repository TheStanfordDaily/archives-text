# Save the Bay fighting landfill, developers
## 
### VICKI MOORE 
In the early 19605, the San
Francisco Bay had shrunk
dramatically, primarily because
developers and municipalities
had diked and subsequently fil
led about one-third of the origi
nal bay with earth. In addition,
the bay was polluted from
bayshore industries and solid
waste disposal dumps, while
large numbers of fish, shellfish,
birds and harbor seals had either
died out or had been forced to
abandon highly polluted areas.
" In 1960, there were 40 garbage
dumps around the Bay; it smel
led all the way from the Bay
Bridge to San Jose," said
Catherine Kerr, a founder of
Save the San Francisco Bay As
sociation.
In fact, Kerr and two other
women, all living in the Berkeley
hills, could look out their front
windows and literally see the
gradual disappearance of the
Bay. They decided to take action
by gathering public support for
an effort to save the Bay from
pollution and filling. They
founded Save the San Francisco
Bay, a citizen group currently
claiming 20,000 members.
After hearing of the City of
Berkeley's plans to double its
size by filling the Bay, and the
1960 Army Corps of Engineers'
report predicting that the Bay
would be little more than a river
if the filling trend of the 1950s
was to continue, these women
successfully fought the City of
Berkeley and then convinced
many state representatives of the
urgency of a regional plan for the
conservation and development
of the Bay. As a result, in 1965
the California legislature passed
the McAteer-Petris Act, forming
the San Francisco Bay Conserva
tion and Development Commis
sion (BCDC). "Save the San
Francisco Bay was our genesis;
they put pressure on politicians
and raised the consciousness of
people in the Bay area," said
Russell Abramson, assistant
executive director of the BCDC.
The Bay has been vulnerable
to filling because of its shallow
ness. About two-thirds of the
Bay is less than 18 feet deep at
low tide. In the South Bay and in
San Pablo Bay, the depth of the
water two or three miles offshore
is only five or six feet at low tide.
Diking and filling during the past

century have reduced the area of
the Bay from about 787 square
miles to about 548 square miles
today.
Pressures to fill also arose
from the divided ownership of
the Bay. Private owners claim 22
percent of the Bay, including ex
tensive parts of the South Bay,
while cities and counties own 23
percent and the federal govern
ment owns five percent, leaving
the state with ownership of about
one-half of the Bay. The parts of
the Bay that are closest to shore,
most shallow, and thus easiest to
fill, are held by many private
owners and local governments,
who were unhampered by any
state or federal restriction and
free to fill as much of their prop
erty as they wanted to — without
regard for the effects of filling on
the Bay as a whole, according to
the BCDC.

the depth of the water two or three miles

Diking and filling during the past century
have reduced the area of the Bayfrom about
787 square miles to about 598 square miles.

The BCDC was originally
given a four-year life span in
which to prepare a Bay plan. In
1969, after 19 technical studies
were completed, the plan was
submitted and approved by then
Gov. Ronald Reagan and
the California legislature, who
subsequently gave the Commis
sion permanent agency status to
carry out the plan.
This plan had two major ob
jectives: to protect the Bay,
which includes San Francisco,
San Pablo and Suisun Bays, for
current and future generations
and to develop both the Bay and
its shoreline with only minimum
filling and dredging. Its major re
sponsibilities were to regulate fil
ling and dredging, to protect,
within certain limitations, a
100-foot strip inland from the
Bay, and to have limited jurisdic
tion over the filling of salt ponds,
marshes and mudflats. The
BCDC must give permit ap
proval over land use changes af
fecting the Bay and its shoreline
within the Commission's juris
diction area.
The basic requirement, Ab
ramson said, of any development
permit, is the provision that de
velopers must create public ac
cess areas to the maximum ex
tent feasible. Public access is
usually in the form of parks,
landscaped areas, small beaches,
walkways, bicycle paths, and

fishing piers.
Although the BCDC allows
bayfill only in rare circumstances
and in very minimal amounts, a
bayfill developer must mitigate
for the fill either by buying land
and dedicating it to public agen
cies, or by crating new marshland
on his own land by breaking
dikes and returning it to tidal ac
tion, thus expanding the net area
of the Bay.
The BCDC must complete ac
tion on a permit application
within 90 days after filing or the
permit is automatically granted.
As a result, the BCDC has one of
the most expeditious regulatory
processes in state government,
Abramson said. A public hearing
must also be allowed for every
permit application.
The BCDCs 27 appointed
members include federal and
state agency members, local

elected officials, and private citi
zens. Such diversity "keeps the
politics to a minimum and fo
cuses each member's concern on
what is best for the Bay," Kerr
said.
Now, after fourteen years in
existence, the BCDC not only
reversed the bayfill trend of the
1950s and 19605, but it brought
about a sizable increase in wet
land acreage, public access areas,
and even in the water surface of
the Bay itself. During 1982, the
BCDC approved 26 permits
worth approximately $379 mill
ion and provided for 27 new
acres of public access and 262
new water acres.
The BCDC has also been
helped by three important deci
sions made in 1972: the creation
of the San Francisco Bay Na
tional Wildlife Refuge — 22,000
acres of open water marshlands
and salt ponds in the South Bay;
the opening of the Golden Gate
National Recreation Area,
which would eventually consist
of 34,000 acres, much of it prime
shoreline property; and the East
Bay Regional Park District's
purchase of 1000 acres at Point
Pinole in Contra Costa County.
The BCDC has also worked
with the California Water Qual
ity Control Board for the San
Francisco Bay Region (called the
Regional Water Quality Control

Board), to restore and maintain
a level of water quality high
enough to permit water sports
and provide a suitable habitat for
aquatic life.
"In granting permits for de
velopers, the BCDC' makes con
ditions that address water quality
impacts," said Bob Merrill of the
BCDC. The BCDC was instru
mental in forcing cities and in
dustries to initiate secondary
treatment of their effluent, and
worked with other agencies to
reduce pollution causing dis
charges into Bay water. In 1972,
the Federal Water Pollution
Control Act Amendments also
mandated a more thorough
cleanup of the Bay.
"A lot of progress has been
made cleaning up sewage
effluent and other organic
municipal waste which com
posed most of the noticeable,
smelly stuff," said Merrill. Such
organic pollutants have a high
biochemical oxygen demand,
and did not leave enough oxygen
for the aquatic life of the Bay,
thus driving down their popula
tions.
According to Dr. Teng Chung
Wu, supervising engineer at the
Regional Water Quality Control
Board, upgraded sewage treat
ment has removed about 90 per
cent of the sewage's organic
material, greatly improving the
Bay's supply of oxygen.
"Shrimp have been restored,
and fishing is coming back to the
South Bay," Wu said. Sewage
treatment has also reduced sub
stantially the harmful bacteria in
the Bay so that 85 percent of the
Bay is now safe for swimming,
whereas about 20 years ago. only
20 percent was as safe, according
to Wu.
However, "There is now con
cern that inorganic chemicals
such as heavy metals and oil are
having a harmful effect." warned
Merrill. Oil spills from ships
transferring oil to piers in the San
Pablo Bay, storm water urban
runoff from streets, and oil-based
pesticides used in the Central
Valley which run off into the San
Joaquin River and then into the
Bay are some of the major causes
of the Bay pollution, but their
overall impact is not yet known.
Other threats to the Bay, said
Abramson, include the continu
ing pressure to divert water from
the San Joaquin and Sacramento
Rivers for irrigation in Southern
California, and the extremely
high land value around the Bay.
"I think some form of the
Peripheral Canal Bill will be in
troduced every session as long as
southern California perceives
the need for water and as long as
the land here is of such high
value and the Bay water so shal
low, there will always be the
threat it will be filled." Abram
son added.

San Pablo Bay, the depth of the
water two or three miles offshore
is only five or six feet at low tide.
Diking and filling during the past

century have reduced the area of
the Bay from about 787 square
miles to about 548 square miles
today.
Pressures to fill also arose
from the divided ownership of
the Bay. Private owners claim 22
percent of the Bay, including ex
tensive parts of the South Bay,
while cities and counties own 23
percent and the federal govern
ment owns five percent, leaving
the state with ownership of about
one-half of the Bay. The parts of
the Bay that are closest to shore,
most shallow, and thus easiest to
fill, are held by many private
owners and local governments,
who were unhampered by any
state or federal restriction and
free to fill as much of their prop
erty as they wanted to — without
regard for the effects of filling on
the Bay as a whole, according to
the BCDC.

The Bay has been vulnerable to filling
because of its shallowness. About two-thirds
of the Bay is less than 18 feet deep at low
tide. In the south bay and in San Pablo Bay
the depth of the water two or three miles
offshore is only five or six feet at low tide.
Diking and filling during the past century
have reduced the area of the Bayfrom about
787 square miles to about 598 square miles.

The BCDC was originally
given a four-year life span in
which to prepare a Bay plan. In
1969, after 19 technical studies
were completed, the plan was
submitted and approved by then
Gov. Ronald Reagan and
the California legislature, who
subsequently gave the Commis
sion permanent agency status to
carry out the plan.
This plan had two major ob
jectives: to protect the Bay,
which includes San Francisco,
San Pablo and Suisun Bays, for
current and future generations
and to develop both the Bay and
its shoreline with only minimum
filling and dredging. Its major re
sponsibilities were to regulate fil
ling and dredging, to protect,
within certain limitations, a
100-foot strip inland from the
Bay, and to have limited jurisdic
tion over the filling of salt ponds,
marshes and mudflats. The
BCDC must give permit ap
proval over land use changes af
fecting the Bay and its shoreline
within the Commission's juris
diction area.
The basic requirement, Ab
ramson said, of any development
permit, is the provision that de
velopers must create public ac
cess areas to the maximum ex
tent feasible. Public access is
usually in the form of parks,
landscaped areas, small beaches,
walkways, bicycle paths, and

fishing piers.
Although the BCDC allows
bayfill only in rare circumstances
and in very minimal amounts, a
bayfill developer must mitigate
for the fill either by buying land
and dedicating it to public agen
cies, or by crating new marshland
on his own land by breaking
dikes and returning it to tidal ac
tion, thus expanding the net area
of the Bay.
The BCDC must complete ac
tion on a permit application
within 90 days after filing or the
permit is automatically granted.
As a result, the BCDC has one of
the most expeditious regulatory
processes in state government,
Abramson said. A public hearing
must also be allowed for every
permit application.
The BCDCs 27 appointed
members include federal and
state agency members, local

elected officials, and private citi
zens. Such diversity "keeps the
politics to a minimum and fo
cuses each member's concern on
what is best for the Bay," Kerr
said.
Now, after fourteen years in
existence, the BCDC not only
reversed the bayfill trend of the
1950s and 19605, but it brought
about a sizable increase in wet
land acreage, public access areas,
and even in the water surface of
the Bay itself. During 1982, the
BCDC approved 26 permits
worth approximately $379 mill
ion and provided for 27 new
acres of public access and 262
new water acres.
The BCDC has also been
helped by three important deci
sions made in 1972: the creation
of the San Francisco Bay Na
tional Wildlife Refuge — 22,000
acres of open water marshlands
and salt ponds in the South Bay;
the opening of the Golden Gate
National Recreation Area,
which would eventually consist
of 34,000 acres, much of it prime
shoreline property; and the East
Bay Regional Park District's
purchase of 1000 acres at Point
Pinole in Contra Costa County.
The BCDC has also worked
with the California Water Qual
ity Control Board for the San
Francisco Bay Region (called the
Regional Water Quality Control

Board), to restore and maintain
a level of water quality high
enough to permit water sports
and provide a suitable habitat for
aquatic life.
"In granting permits for de
velopers, the BCDC' makes con
ditions that address water quality
impacts," said Bob Merrill of the
BCDC. The BCDC was instru
mental in forcing cities and in
dustries to initiate secondary
treatment of their effluent, and
worked with other agencies to
reduce pollution causing dis
charges into Bay water. In 1972,
the Federal Water Pollution
Control Act Amendments also
mandated a more thorough
cleanup of the Bay.
"A lot of progress has been
made cleaning up sewage
effluent and other organic
municipal waste which com
posed most of the noticeable,
smelly stuff," said Merrill. Such
organic pollutants have a high
biochemical oxygen demand,
and did not leave enough oxygen
for the aquatic life of the Bay,
thus driving down their popula
tions.
According to Dr. Teng Chung
Wu, supervising engineer at the
Regional Water Quality Control
Board, upgraded sewage treat
ment has removed about 90 per
cent of the sewage's organic
material, greatly improving the
Bay's supply of oxygen.
"Shrimp have been restored,
and fishing is coming back to the
South Bay," Wu said. Sewage
treatment has also reduced sub
stantially the harmful bacteria in
the Bay so that 85 percent of the
Bay is now safe for swimming,
whereas about 20 years ago. only
20 percent was as safe, according
to Wu.
However, "There is now con
cern that inorganic chemicals
such as heavy metals and oil are
having a harmful effect." warned
Merrill. Oil spills from ships
transferring oil to piers in the San
Pablo Bay, storm water urban
runoff from streets, and oil-based
pesticides used in the Central
Valley which run off into the San
Joaquin River and then into the
Bay are some of the major causes
of the Bay pollution, but their
overall impact is not yet known.
Other threats to the Bay, said
Abramson, include the continu
ing pressure to divert water from
the San Joaquin and Sacramento
Rivers for irrigation in Southern
California, and the extremely
high land value around the Bay.
"I think some form of the
Peripheral Canal Bill will be in
troduced every session as long as
southern California perceives
the need for water and as long as
the land here is of such high
value and the Bay water so shal
low, there will always be the
threat it will be filled." Abram

A SKY-HIGH VIEW: The San Francisco Bay Area is shown in this high altitude shot, including
the San Pablo and Suison Bays. Environmentalists are disturbed by the development of the
shallow bay, a trend which, if continued, would reduce the bay to "little more than a river,"
according to an Army Corps of Engineers report.
In the early 19605, the San
Francisco Bay had shrunk
dramatically, primarily because
developers and municipalities
had diked and subsequently fil
led about one-third of the origi
nal bay with earth. In addition,
the bay was polluted from
bayshore industries and solid
waste disposal dumps, while
large numbers of fish, shellfish,
birds and harbor seals had either
died out or had been forced to
abandon highly polluted areas.
" In 1960, there were 40 garbage
dumps around the Bay; it smel
led all the way from the Bay
Bridge to San Jose," said
Catherine Kerr, a founder of
Save the San Francisco Bay As
sociation.
In fact, Kerr and two other
women, all living in the Berkeley
hills, could look out their front
windows and literally see the
gradual disappearance of the
Bay. They decided to take action
by gathering public support for
an effort to save the Bay from
pollution and filling. They
founded Save the San Francisco
Bay, a citizen group currently
claiming 20,000 members.
After hearing of the City of
Berkeley's plans to double its
size by filling the Bay, and the
1960 Army Corps of Engineers'
report predicting that the Bay
would be little more than a river
if the filling trend of the 1950s
was to continue, these women
successfully fought the City of
Berkeley and then convinced
many state representatives of the
urgency of a regional plan for the
conservation and development
of the Bay. As a result, in 1965
the California legislature passed
the McAteer-Petris Act, forming
the San Francisco Bay Conserva
tion and Development Commis
sion (BCDC). "Save the San
Francisco Bay was our genesis;
they put pressure on politicians
and raised the consciousness of
people in the Bay area," said
Russell Abramson, assistant
executive director of the BCDC.

ling and dredging, to protect,
within certain limitations, a
100-foot strip inland from the
Bay, and to have limited jurisdic
tion over the filling of salt ponds,
marshes and mudflats. The
BCDC must give permit ap
proval over land use changes af
fecting the Bay and its shoreline
within the Commission's juris
diction area.
The basic requirement, Ab
ramson said, of any development
permit, is the provision that de
velopers must create public ac
cess areas to the maximum ex
tent feasible. Public access is
usually in the form of parks,
landscaped areas, small beaches,
walkways, bicycle paths, and

fishing piers.
Although the BCDC allows
bayfill only in rare circumstances
and in very minimal amounts, a
bayfill developer must mitigate
for the fill either by buying land
and dedicating it to public agen
cies, or by crating new marshland
on his own land by breaking
dikes and returning it to tidal ac
tion, thus expanding the net area
of the Bay.
The BCDC must complete ac
tion on a permit application
within 90 days after filing or the
permit is automatically granted.
As a result, the BCDC has one of
the most expeditious regulatory
processes in state government,
Abramson said. A public hearing
must also be allowed for every
permit application.
The BCDCs 27 appointed
members include federal and
state agency members, local

elected officials, and private citi
zens. Such diversity "keeps the
politics to a minimum and fo
cuses each member's concern on
what is best for the Bay," Kerr
said.
Now, after fourteen years in
existence, the BCDC not only
reversed the bayfill trend of the
1950s and 19605, but it brought
about a sizable increase in wet
land acreage, public access areas,
and even in the water surface of
the Bay itself. During 1982, the
BCDC approved 26 permits
worth approximately $379 mill
ion and provided for 27 new
acres of public access and 262
new water acres.
The BCDC has also been
helped by three important deci
sions made in 1972: the creation
of the San Francisco Bay Na
tional Wildlife Refuge — 22,000
acres of open water marshlands
and salt ponds in the South Bay;
the opening of the Golden Gate
National Recreation Area,
which would eventually consist
of 34,000 acres, much of it prime
shoreline property; and the East
Bay Regional Park District's
purchase of 1000 acres at Point
Pinole in Contra Costa County.
The BCDC has also worked
with the California Water Qual
ity Control Board for the San
Francisco Bay Region (called the
Regional Water Quality Control

Board), to restore and maintain
a level of water quality high
enough to permit water sports
and provide a suitable habitat for
aquatic life.
"In granting permits for de
velopers, the BCDC' makes con
ditions that address water quality
impacts," said Bob Merrill of the
BCDC. The BCDC was instru
mental in forcing cities and in
dustries to initiate secondary
treatment of their effluent, and
worked with other agencies to
reduce pollution causing dis
charges into Bay water. In 1972,
the Federal Water Pollution
Control Act Amendments also
mandated a more thorough
cleanup of the Bay.
"A lot of progress has been
made cleaning up sewage
effluent and other organic
municipal waste which com
posed most of the noticeable,
smelly stuff," said Merrill. Such
organic pollutants have a high
biochemical oxygen demand,
and did not leave enough oxygen
for the aquatic life of the Bay,
thus driving down their popula
tions.
According to Dr. Teng Chung
Wu, supervising engineer at the
Regional Water Quality Control
Board, upgraded sewage treat
ment has removed about 90 per
cent of the sewage's organic
material, greatly improving the
Bay's supply of oxygen.
"Shrimp have been restored,
and fishing is coming back to the
South Bay," Wu said. Sewage
treatment has also reduced sub
stantially the harmful bacteria in
the Bay so that 85 percent of the
Bay is now safe for swimming,
whereas about 20 years ago. only
20 percent was as safe, according
to Wu.
However, "There is now con
cern that inorganic chemicals
such as heavy metals and oil are
having a harmful effect." warned
Merrill. Oil spills from ships
transferring oil to piers in the San
Pablo Bay, storm water urban
runoff from streets, and oil-based
pesticides used in the Central
Valley which run off into the San
Joaquin River and then into the
Bay are some of the major causes
of the Bay pollution, but their
overall impact is not yet known.
Other threats to the Bay, said
Abramson, include the continu
ing pressure to divert water from
the San Joaquin and Sacramento
Rivers for irrigation in Southern
California, and the extremely
high land value around the Bay.
"I think some form of the
Peripheral Canal Bill will be in
troduced every session as long as
southern California perceives
the need for water and as long as
the land here is of such high
value and the Bay water so shal
low, there will always be the
threat it will be filled." Abram
son added.

A SKY-HIGH VIEW: The San Francisco Bay Area is shown in this high altitude shot, including
the San Pablo and Suison Bays. Environmentalists are disturbed by the development of the
shallow bay, a trend which, if continued, would reduce the bay to "little more than a river,"
according to an Army Corps of Engineers report.
In the early 19605, the San
Francisco Bay had shrunk
dramatically, primarily because
developers and municipalities
had diked and subsequently fil
led about one-third of the origi
nal bay with earth. In addition,
the bay was polluted from
bayshore industries and solid
waste disposal dumps, while
large numbers of fish, shellfish,
birds and harbor seals had either
died out or had been forced to
abandon highly polluted areas.
" In 1960, there were 40 garbage
dumps around the Bay; it smel
led all the way from the Bay
Bridge to San Jose," said
Catherine Kerr, a founder of
Save the San Francisco Bay As
sociation.
In fact, Kerr and two other
women, all living in the Berkeley
hills, could look out their front
windows and literally see the
gradual disappearance of the
Bay. They decided to take action
by gathering public support for
an effort to save the Bay from
pollution and filling. They
founded Save the San Francisco
Bay, a citizen group currently
claiming 20,000 members.
After hearing of the City of
Berkeley's plans to double its
size by filling the Bay, and the
1960 Army Corps of Engineers'
report predicting that the Bay
would be little more than a river
if the filling trend of the 1950s
was to continue, these women
successfully fought the City of
Berkeley and then convinced
many state representatives of the
urgency of a regional plan for the
conservation and development
of the Bay. As a result, in 1965
the California legislature passed
the McAteer-Petris Act, forming
the San Francisco Bay Conserva
tion and Development Commis
sion (BCDC). "Save the San
Francisco Bay was our genesis;
they put pressure on politicians
and raised the consciousness of
people in the Bay area," said
Russell Abramson, assistant
executive director of the BCDC.
The Bay has been vulnerable
to filling because of its shallow
ness. About two-thirds of the
Bay is less than 18 feet deep at
low tide. In the South Bay and in
San Pablo Bay, the depth of the
water two or three miles offshore
is only five or six feet at low tide.
Diking and filling during the past

century have reduced the area of
the Bay from about 787 square
miles to about 548 square miles
today.
Pressures to fill also arose
from the divided ownership of
the Bay. Private owners claim 22
percent of the Bay, including ex
tensive parts of the South Bay,
while cities and counties own 23
percent and the federal govern
ment owns five percent, leaving
the state with ownership of about
one-half of the Bay. The parts of
the Bay that are closest to shore,
most shallow, and thus easiest to
fill, are held by many private
owners and local governments,
who were unhampered by any
state or federal restriction and
free to fill as much of their prop
erty as they wanted to — without
regard for the effects of filling on
the Bay as a whole, according to
the BCDC.

The Bay has been vulnerable to filling
because of its shallowness. About two-thirds
of the Bay is less than 18 feet deep at low
tide. In the south bay and in San Pablo Bay
the depth of the water two or three miles
offshore is only five or six feet at low tide.
Diking and filling during the past century
have reduced the area of the Bayfrom about
787 square miles to about 598 square miles.

The BCDC was originally
given a four-year life span in
which to prepare a Bay plan. In
1969, after 19 technical studies
were completed, the plan was
submitted and approved by then
Gov. Ronald Reagan and
the California legislature, who
subsequently gave the Commis
sion permanent agency status to
carry out the plan.
This plan had two major ob
jectives: to protect the Bay,
which includes San Francisco,
San Pablo and Suisun Bays, for
current and future generations
and to develop both the Bay and
its shoreline with only minimum
filling and dredging. Its major re
sponsibilities were to regulate fil
ling and dredging, to protect,
within certain limitations, a
100-foot strip inland from the
Bay, and to have limited jurisdic
tion over the filling of salt ponds,
marshes and mudflats. The
