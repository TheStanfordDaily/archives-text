# ASSU, University to finish '83-'84 budget
## 
### FELICIA LEE Staff writer 
The ASSU and the University will decide within
the next two weeks the amount of University fund
ing for the 1983-1984 ASSU budget, according to
ASSU Financial Manager Bob Brody.
The ASSU, which has been negotiating the
budget for 1 8 months, is expected to receive half of
its general operating money from the University.
ASSU officials said they would not disclose the
exact amount until the negotiations are completed.
According to Brody, the ASSU received about
$100,000 from the University in its 1981-1982
budget — about half of its general operating funds.
Thom Massey, associate dean of student ac
ivities, who served as an ASSU advocate, said that
here were few difficulties in the negotiation of the
1983-1984 budget. Margaret Fidler, assistant dean
of student affairs, who represented the University in
the negotiations, described the discussions as "very
cordial."
The delay in the negotiations, according to COP
member Mark Epstein, was the result of the Uni
versity and the ASSU each having a "different phil
osophical approach" to the problem of funding.

In previous years, the ASSU had striven for fi
nancial independence, but the poor ecnonomy — as
well as the failure of several ASSU projects, such as
the now-defunct travel service — now has forced
the ASSU to rely more on University support.
The 1983-1984 budget differs from those in re
cent years in that additional funds will be allotted
for ASSU governance itself. This year, the ASSU
will receive $10,000 for its executive and legislative
branches.
This fund, according to Epstein, will pay for part
of the salaries of the council of presidents and the
ASSU senate chair, and will help to open ASSU
participation to all students, regardless of income.
The ASSU governance fund, according to Fidler, is
expected to increase to $16,000 over the next two
years.
Both the ASSU and the University expect the
percentage of University funding for the ASSU to
increase over the next few years. Brody said he
expects University funding for the ASSU to in
crease to about 70 percent by 1984-1985.
Other changes in the 1983 ASSU budget include
an increase in funding to $10,000 for the Boathouse

and for Lake Lagunita safety.
The ASSU Recycling Center, which the Univer
sity does not view as a profitable project for the
ASSU, will continue to receive funds this year, ac
cording to Fidler, however, the $ 10,000 given to the
Recycling Center this year is not guaranteed to be
renewed and will be considered a "one time only"
fund. . .. -
An increase in the ASSU election fund is also
expected.
Epstein also said that the increase in University
funding makes the 1983 budget very different from
those of the past seven years and may help "legiti
mate the ASSU as an official University organiza
tion." The budget will only become final when it is
approved by the provost.
Financial support from the University is neces
sary for the general operating cost of the ASSU,
which receives no direct support from student fees.
Individual projects do get support. The ASSU,
however, does earn money from such enterprises as
the Sunday Flicks and the newly-organized ASSU
Advertising Service.
