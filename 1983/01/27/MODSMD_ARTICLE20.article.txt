# 'Cowboy' author proves maverick speaker
## 
### BARBARA SCHULER 
Richard Brautigan, an aging, hard-drinking cowboy
and author of many controversial novels and collections
of "alleged poetry," put on a performance January 19 in
Kresge Auditorium, the kick-off event of this year's
Speakers Bureau sponsored Winter Writers Series.
Brautigan read mostly from his book of poetry. Loading
Mercury With A Pitchfork, losing himself in gigglesagain
and again over his work. Much of Brautigan's writing is
sprinkled liberally with obscenities, and this amused him
as he read them out. He seems to enjoy the license that
he, as a writer, is allowed.
Midway through the reading, he took out a fifth of
Jack Daniels and poured himself a drink, mumbling
something and laughing nervously behind the podium.
Dressing the part of a working-class hero, he wore a light
blue t-shirt, blue jeans and snakeskin boots, and he
spoke of his admiration for that type in the question
and-answer part of his talk.
During an extended discussion, which occurred the
afternoon of his appearance, he spoke openly of his
views on literature, teaching. American domestic and
foreign policy, religion and death. A topic he returned to
again and again was his love for the Japanese people and
their culture; he is enthralled by them.
Born in Tacoma, Washington, Brautigan has lived all
his life in the west. Currently, he lives on a ranch, 12
miles outside of Livingston, Montana. When asked what
he ranches, he replied, "words. That's all, just words.
But I do have some horses out there." When asked if he
had ever spent any time back East, he said, "Yeah, I
lived in New York City for three weeks once."
Richard Brautigan did not finish high school and he
never went to college, but he has taught at numerous
colleges and universities in the United States. He was a
lecturer at Stanford in 1968, and again in 1970. He
taught a writing class last year in Montana, but he con
fessed that he does not like teaching, and he will not do it
again soon. "I don't want to teach any more because I
don't want to become a cynic. My friends who teach are
cynics," he said. "If 1 were to teach, I'd want every class
to be like my first, with the same enthusiasm I had then."

Brautigan has a surprising lack of interest in modern
American writing. "I don't read contemporary Ameri
can fiction. I haven't in 20 years." The only fiction he
reads now is Japanese — books by Dazai amd Tanizaki,
among others. He does read poetry published here. His
favorites are Robert Creeley and Robert Lowell. When
asked about influences on his writing, he mentioned T.S.
Eliot and Japanese haiku. He also spoke rev . cntly of
Isaac Babel, William Faulkner and John O'Hara.
Brautigan's own work, he said, was originally pub
lished "purely by luck." Trout Fishing in America was
rejected 20 times before it was finally accepted by Simon
and Schuster. Brautigan said, "I never would have ex
pected to be published. If I had wanted that first and
foremost, I would have written novels conventional for
my age. I did not." He spoke bitterly at his reading of the

censorship of his books. "My books are translated into
over 25 languages, and the only country I am censored in
is the country 1 live in. I find it very embar.assing." He
read a story being held up by those on a crusade to censor
his books in Texas. It is called the "Scarlatti Tilt", and it
reads: It's very hard to live in a studio apartment in San
Jose with a man who's learning to play the violin. That s
what she told the police when she handed them the
empty revolver."
Brautigan alternately took an angry and a boastful
stance concerning this censorship. At one point he said,
"I am one of the most censored writers in America." He
sounded proud of the accomplishment.
He talked about other aspects of politics in the United
States. He said that U.S. diplomatic policy is "played out
like a game of poker — relying purely on chance. The
Russians play chess, and the Japanese and the Chinese;
they play Go." He turned to me, and asked rhetorically,
"Who will we turn to when we've alienated everyone
else? Italy? Belgium?" Later he spoke of domestic prob
lems. He is convinced that by the end of 1984, the
United States will be in the midst of a "ruthless civil war
between the rich and the poor, fought with guerrilla
warfare," he said. He then stated that he considers him
self apolitical. "I do not act on these things I say. I simply
believe them."
Brautigan holds little regard even for Western relig
ion. "I am not a Christian," he said. "Even in their
religion, Westerners are materialistic. They place a
material value on their soul, and that is why they have to
believe that the soul goes some place after it has been
used. Like used furniture goes to used furniture stores,"
he laughed. He went back to the Japanese. "They be
lieve in honor, and they have no fear of death. They love
suicide," he said, "in a way that Westerners could never
understand."
He claimed to be akin to them in this: "Fear of death is
the least of my fears." He sounded sure of himself as he
went on, saying, "There is no life after this one. When
this world is gone, that's all she wrote. Perhaps if we did
not believe in some other, better place, this second world
called heaven, we'd do a better job of taking care of this
one."
