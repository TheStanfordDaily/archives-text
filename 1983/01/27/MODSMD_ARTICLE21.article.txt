## ACT finally finds itself 
### MARC FAJER 
The American Conservatory
Theatre has been wallowing
through an unexciting season
thus far this year. Their decision
to concentrate on "small" pro
ductions due to financial difficul
ties has resulted in some theater
that might be termed " nice," and
some that was fairly poor, like
last month's revival of A Christ
mas Carol. It was therefore a
very pleasant surprise to dis
cover that Uncle Vartya, which

opened last Tueday night, is a
fascinating and moving produc
tion. Under the talented gui
dance of a husband and wife
team of British guest directors,
Helen Burns and Michael Lan
gham, Chekhov's comedy, cer
tainly the finest play ACT has
attempted this season, receives
the best treatment as well, in
cluding a stunning performance
by Barbara Dirickson. The result
»s well worth seeing as it shows

off the company's finest actors
finally showing what ACT is
capable of doing.
Burns and Langham have pre
sented us, through Pam Gems'
translation, with a world that is
not composed of the gloomy col
lection of bored people usually
(and probably incorrectly) as
sociated with Chekhov in this
country. Careful work with the
comic sequences of the play,
especially the drunken encoun-

ters of Dr. Astrov (Peter Donat)
and Vanya (Dakin Matthews),
allowed the humor and intelli
gence of the characters to come
across. As a result, we always
care about what happens to these
people, and their realization of
the futility of their own lives is all
the more ironic to us.
Barbara Dirickson's portrayal
of Sonia, the plain, hard-working
daughter epitomizes the best of
this production. We are de

lighted with her girlish repetition
of Dr. Astrov's philosophies. It is
clear from the beginning that she
is in love with the doctor, and
hangs or. his every word. In the
second act, she charms us again
as she shares a midnight snack
with Astrov and manages to go
into raptures though he has given
her no real encouragement. This
is followed by a scene with her
young stepmother, Yelena (De
borah May), overflowing with
tears, dreams and laughter. They

pledge friendship, drinking from
the same cup of wine, and the
powr of Dirickson's acting brings
out the best even in May, who is
weak elsewhere in the show. By
the second act curtain, Dirickson
has totally captivated the audi
ence with youth, love and en
thusiasm, and her emotional de
scent is that much harder to bear.
She eventually discovers that her


Uncle Vanya
love is hopeless, and she is (rails
formed. From the sobbing on ho
Nanny's knees at the end of act
three through the Composed
final farewell to the doctor, we
watch her grow. The play's final
speech, in which she exhorts hei
uncle to go on living through the
bitterness and hopelessness until
finding the peace of death is hril
liant and devastating.
Most of the rest of the cast is
good even if not quite up to the
standard Barbara Pirickson
Peter Donat, as Astrov, brings
out the ironies of the character
very well; he is idealistic enough
to want to have some lasting ef
feet on the world and reaiisti
enough to know that ht does iv.t
He is especially convincing when
he gets involved with his pel pro
ject: reforesting. In the third act
when he brings out-maps to di -
monstratc the defoliation 01
Russia, his obvious passion for
his work and the care with which
he tries to brim; home its impor
tance are excellently portrayed,
fie is hysterical when drunk an 1
his scenes with Soma and Vanya,
under the influence, are superb.
The love scenes with Yelena fall
a bit flat; it often seems that he is
trying a bit too hard to make up
for her inadequacy on stage.
This is not really his fault De
borah May,as Yelena. is the only
big weakness in the show. She is
described as indolent, intcili
gent, beautiful and bortJd. lliis is
obviously a difficult combination
to port! ay, but the set of acti essy
poses with which we are pre
sented is certainly inadequate.
Aside from her scenes with
Sonia, she is never \ ery convinc
ing, and we have a hard rime un
derstandingthe infatuation she is
supposed to be inspiring The
rest of the cast does well in cover

are mainly noticeable when

around her.

The American Conservatory
Theatre has been wallowing
through an unexciting season
thus far this year. Their decision
to concentrate on "small" pro
ductions due to financial difficul
ties has resulted in some theater
that might be termed " nice," and
some that was fairly poor, like
last month's revival of A Christ
mas Carol. It was therefore a
very pleasant surprise to dis
cover that Uncle Vartya, which

opened last Tueday night, is a
fascinating and moving produc
tion. Under the talented gui
dance of a husband and wife
team of British guest directors,
Helen Burns and Michael Lan
gham, Chekhov's comedy, cer
tainly the finest play ACT has
attempted this season, receives
the best treatment as well, in
cluding a stunning performance
by Barbara Dirickson. The result
»s well worth seeing as it shows

off the company's finest actors
finally showing what ACT is
capable of doing.
Burns and Langham have pre
sented us, through Pam Gems'
translation, with a world that is
not composed of the gloomy col
lection of bored people usually
(and probably incorrectly) as
sociated with Chekhov in this
country. Careful work with the
comic sequences of the play,
especially the drunken encoun-

ters of Dr. Astrov (Peter Donat)
and Vanya (Dakin Matthews),
allowed the humor and intelli
gence of the characters to come
across. As a result, we always
care about what happens to these
people, and their realization of
the futility of their own lives is all
the more ironic to us.
Barbara Dirickson's portrayal
of Sonia, the plain, hard-working
daughter epitomizes the best of
this production. We are de

lighted with her girlish repetition
of Dr. Astrov's philosophies. It is
clear from the beginning that she
is in love with the doctor, and
hangs or. his every word. In the
second act, she charms us again
as she shares a midnight snack
with Astrov and manages to go
into raptures though he has given
her no real encouragement. This
is followed by a scene with her
young stepmother, Yelena (De
borah May), overflowing with
tears, dreams and laughter. They

pledge friendship, drinking from
the same cup of wine, and the
powr of Dirickson's acting brings
out the best even in May, who is
weak elsewhere in the show. By
the second act curtain, Dirickson
has totally captivated the audi
ence with youth, love and en
thusiasm, and her emotional de
scent is that much harder to bear.
She eventually discovers that her


Uncle Vanya
love is hopeless, and she is (rails
formed. From the sobbing on ho
Nanny's knees at the end of act
three through the Composed
final farewell to the doctor, we
watch her grow. The play's final
speech, in which she exhorts hei
uncle to go on living through the
bitterness and hopelessness until
finding the peace of death is hril
liant and devastating.
Most of the rest of the cast is
good even if not quite up to the
standard Barbara Pirickson
Peter Donat, as Astrov, brings
out the ironies of the character
very well; he is idealistic enough
to want to have some lasting ef
feet on the world and reaiisti
enough to know that ht does iv.t
He is especially convincing when
he gets involved with his pel pro
