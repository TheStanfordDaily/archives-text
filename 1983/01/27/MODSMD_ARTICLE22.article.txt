# 'New Breed': The Jam livens it up
## 
### LARRY NADLER 
"What have I learnt? BELIEF IS
ALL!" —so, Paul Weller, lead singer and
guitarist for the Jam and spiritual guru for
fans all over the world, proclaims on the
liner notes for his latest and final product,
Dig the New Breed. The Jam believe in the
power of music. It is a reaffirmation of the
Jam's commitment to the feeling and
spirit that marked the birth of rock 'n'
roll: youth, freshness, energy, idealism,
change, hope. In announcing their
break-up last October, at the prime of
their colossal popularity in Great Britain,
they've shown a stubborn conviction to
adhere to those principles. They have re
fused to become predictable and boring
like so many other bands by calling it quits
while they can be truly proud of all
they've accomplished, before they no
longer matter. Dig the New Breed is a
gathering of live performances dating
from 1977 up to 1982. It is a cherished
artifact of what can now only exist in the
memories of fans — a live Jam concert.
Emerging from England's revolutio
nary punk scene in 1977, the Jam com
bined the best of punk's energy and pas
sion with a flashy mod style borrowed
from one of the first punk bands, the Who
of the mid-'6os. The debut LP, In The
City, preached the need for constructive
change, not destruction. The title track is
captured here in all its ferocious live in
tensity: "We're gonna tell you about the
young idea, and if it don't work at least we
still tried!" An 18-year-old Paul spits
out the vocals as if fully aware that time is
running out, as youth begins to slip out of
his grasp. Bruce Foxton's skillful, melodic
bass lines and Rick Buckler's furious per
cussion never falter, the perfect comple
ment to Paul's searing power chords. The
Jam always sounds like a unit - every
piece fits perfectly in the structure, every
song sounds like it could be played no
other way.
The Jam's second album, This is the
Modern World, stressed individualism
amidst social pressure — the keeping
one's sanity in an insane world. "Stan
dards," included here, portrays social
standards as dictators in a nation of blind
sheep: "We have the power to control the
whole land/ You never must question our
motive or plans..lt is a subject that the
Jam emphasizes again and again, yet the
urgency of the message put across to the
listener never seems to diminish.
The third LP, All Mod Cons, (the
British abbreviation for "all modern con
veniences"), was the Jam's most
acclaimed album when it was released in
1979. Displaying a new maturity of lyrical
style and an increasingly original sound,
the Jam showed their consummate skill as
musiciams while Weller's vignette-like
songwriting.was compared to that of the
Kink's Ray Davies. From this collection,
Dig the New Breed includes live versions
of the title cut and "To Be Someone,"
unflinchingly looks at the backstabbing
business world and self-indulgent deca
dence that the rock 'n' roll lifestyle has
become. "It's Too Bad" is a fine example
of Weller's songs dealing with romantic
relationships. My favorite line is "All we

seem to do is talk about it/ We always end
up shouting about it." "In the Crowd" is
another look at conforming as the easy
way out: "Everyone seems like they're
acting a dream, 'cause they're just not
thinking about each other/ And they're
taking orders which are media spawned/
Now you should know better, you have
been warned —" Although well
performed, I miss the feedback-drenched
rev-up which usually finishes the number.
Surprisingly, only one number is in
cluded from the classic Setting Sons, the
Jam's fourth album. "Private Hell" de
picts the mid-life crisis as a mental night
mare that is no less than terrifying. It
never fails to send chills shooting down
my spine, as does "Going Underground,"
which, upon its 1980 release, was the first
UK single to enter the charts at number
one in 10 years. The ultimate plea for
pushing forward, causing change, not sit
ting complacently while the world crum-

bles around you, "Going Underground"
is delivered with such passion and force
that you can't help but listen up. "You'll
see kidney machines replaced by rockets
and guns/ The public wants what the pub
lic gets/ But I want nothing this society's
got!"
That single's flip-side was "Dreams of
Children," which may seem to be the
most pessimistic song included on Dig the
New Breed: "I got a glimpse of the dreams
of children/ I got a feeling of optimism/
But woke up to a grey and lonely picture/
The streets below left me feeling
dirty. .It is such honest, uncompromis
ing reflections of modern life, especially
the dim future of British youth, that has
led some to brand the Jam as a "depres
sing band." Isn't it more depressing to
ignore the problems of society and there
fore alleviate any hope for a change? This
is indeed music to make your blood boil
and your eyes open.
Sound Affects, the Jam's fifth album,
spawned three of the tracks included
here. The Beatlesque "Start!" deals again
with communication and mutual giving in
a relationship. The audience, singing
along with the lyrics, help convey the tre
mendous live excitement. "That's Enter
tainment" is possibly the Jam's most

beautiful song musically, with an acoustic
quitar accompanying a collage of sights,
sounds, smells, and impressions of every
day life, creating a shifting, cinematic
series of images. "Set the House Ablaze"
raps extremist groups like Britain's right
ist National Front that attempts to solve
national problems with racial hatred, vio
lence and closed minds: "I think we've
lost our perception/ 1 think we've lost
sight of the goals we should be working
for / I think we've lost our reason/ We
stumble blindly and that vision must be
restored!"
That theme of working toward improv
ing one'slot through openness, unity, and
positivism, instead of hiding behind un
iforms and negative rebellion, pervades
The Gift, the latest studio LP, (although a
five-song extended-play record, Beat Sur
render, was subsequently released.)
Though receiving mixed reviews, I found
The Gift, with its straightforward, call
to-arms lyrics and jubilant soul/R &
B-tinged sound (complete with a two
man horn section,) one of the most inspir
ing albums of the past year. "Ghosts,"
one of the most optimistically soul
stirring tracks on that album, is performed
here: "Why are you so frightened, can't

you see that is you?/ That ain't no ghost —
it'sa reflection of you/ Oh, don't live up to
your given roles/ There's more inside than
you will show." Also included is an
energetc version of Jackie Wilson's "Big
Bird."
The quality of the live recordings on
Dig the New Breed is very good through
out. Jam fans will be sure to quibble about
songs not included on the album (would a
triple-live album suffice?), but it is a good
sampler if you wish to acquaint yourself
with the Jam's sound. The drawback is the
absence of a lyric sheet, but who knows?
It may even tempt you to pick up one of
the studio albums — a potentially addic
tive practice. A poem by Percy Shelley
reprinted on the back cover of Sound Af
fects reads:" Rise like lions after slumber/
In unvanquishable number/ Shake your
chains to earth like dew/ Which in sleep
had fallen on you—/ Ye are many — they
are few. .Rise, America. It's not too
late to discover the Jam. Dig?

spirit that marked the birth of rock 'n'
roll: youth, freshness, energy, idealism,
change, hope. In announcing their
break-up last October, at the prime of
their colossal popularity in Great Britain,
they've shown a stubborn conviction to
adhere to those principles. They have re
fused to become predictable and boring
like so many other bands by calling it quits
while they can be truly proud of all
they've accomplished, before they no
longer matter. Dig the New Breed is a
gathering of live performances dating
from 1977 up to 1982. It is a cherished
artifact of what can now only exist in the
memories of fans — a live Jam concert.
Emerging from England's revolutio
nary punk scene in 1977, the Jam com
bined the best of punk's energy and pas
sion with a flashy mod style borrowed
from one of the first punk bands, the Who
of the mid-'6os. The debut LP, In The
City, preached the need for constructive
change, not destruction. The title track is
captured here in all its ferocious live in
tensity: "We're gonna tell you about the
young idea, and if it don't work at least we
still tried!" An 18-year-old Paul spits
out the vocals as if fully aware that time is
running out, as youth begins to slip out of
his grasp. Bruce Foxton's skillful, melodic
bass lines and Rick Buckler's furious per
cussion never falter, the perfect comple
ment to Paul's searing power chords. The
Jam always sounds like a unit - every
piece fits perfectly in the structure, every
song sounds like it could be played no
other way.
The Jam's second album, This is the
Modern World, stressed individualism
amidst social pressure — the keeping
one's sanity in an insane world. "Stan
dards," included here, portrays social
standards as dictators in a nation of blind
sheep: "We have the power to control the
whole land/ You never must question our
motive or plans..lt is a subject that the
Jam emphasizes again and again, yet the
urgency of the message put across to the
listener never seems to diminish.
The third LP, All Mod Cons, (the
British abbreviation for "all modern con
veniences"), was the Jam's most
acclaimed album when it was released in
1979. Displaying a new maturity of lyrical
style and an increasingly original sound,
the Jam showed their consummate skill as
musiciams while Weller's vignette-like
songwriting.was compared to that of the
Kink's Ray Davies. From this collection,
Dig the New Breed includes live versions
of the title cut and "To Be Someone,"
unflinchingly looks at the backstabbing
business world and self-indulgent deca
dence that the rock 'n' roll lifestyle has
become. "It's Too Bad" is a fine example
of Weller's songs dealing with romantic
relationships. My favorite line is "All we

seem to do is talk about it/ We always end
up shouting about it." "In the Crowd" is
another look at conforming as the easy
way out: "Everyone seems like they're
acting a dream, 'cause they're just not
thinking about each other/ And they're
taking orders which are media spawned/
Now you should know better, you have
been warned —" Although well
performed, I miss the feedback-drenched
rev-up which usually finishes the number.
Surprisingly, only one number is in
cluded from the classic Setting Sons, the
Jam's fourth album. "Private Hell" de
picts the mid-life crisis as a mental night
mare that is no less than terrifying. It
never fails to send chills shooting down
my spine, as does "Going Underground,"
which, upon its 1980 release, was the first
UK single to enter the charts at number
one in 10 years. The ultimate plea for
pushing forward, causing change, not sit
ting complacently while the world crum-

bles around you, "Going Underground"
is delivered with such passion and force
that you can't help but listen up. "You'll
see kidney machines replaced by rockets
and guns/ The public wants what the pub
lic gets/ But I want nothing this society's
got!"
That single's flip-side was "Dreams of
Children," which may seem to be the
most pessimistic song included on Dig the
New Breed: "I got a glimpse of the dreams
of children/ I got a feeling of optimism/
But woke up to a grey and lonely picture/
The streets below left me feeling
dirty. .It is such honest, uncompromis
ing reflections of modern life, especially
the dim future of British youth, that has
led some to brand the Jam as a "depres
sing band." Isn't it more depressing to
ignore the problems of society and there
fore alleviate any hope for a change? This
is indeed music to make your blood boil
and your eyes open.
Sound Affects, the Jam's fifth album,
spawned three of the tracks included
here. The Beatlesque "Start!" deals again
with communication and mutual giving in
a relationship. The audience, singing
along with the lyrics, help convey the tre
mendous live excitement. "That's Enter
tainment" is possibly the Jam's most

beautiful song musically, with an acoustic
quitar accompanying a collage of sights,
sounds, smells, and impressions of every
day life, creating a shifting, cinematic
series of images. "Set the House Ablaze"
raps extremist groups like Britain's right
ist National Front that attempts to solve
national problems with racial hatred, vio
lence and closed minds: "I think we've
lost our perception/ 1 think we've lost
sight of the goals we should be working
for / I think we've lost our reason/ We
stumble blindly and that vision must be
restored!"
That theme of working toward improv
ing one'slot through openness, unity, and
positivism, instead of hiding behind un
iforms and negative rebellion, pervades
The Gift, the latest studio LP, (although a
five-song extended-play record, Beat Sur
render, was subsequently released.)
Though receiving mixed reviews, I found
The Gift, with its straightforward, call
to-arms lyrics and jubilant soul/R &
B-tinged sound (complete with a two
man horn section,) one of the most inspir
ing albums of the past year. "Ghosts,"
one of the most optimistically soul
stirring tracks on that album, is performed
here: "Why are you so frightened, can't

you see that is you?/ That ain't no ghost —
it'sa reflection of you/ Oh, don't live up to
your given roles/ There's more inside than
you will show." Also included is an
energetc version of Jackie Wilson's "Big
Bird."
The quality of the live recordings on
Dig the New Breed is very good through
out. Jam fans will be sure to quibble about
songs not included on the album (would a
triple-live album suffice?), but it is a good
sampler if you wish to acquaint yourself
with the Jam's sound. The drawback is the
absence of a lyric sheet, but who knows?
It may even tempt you to pick up one of
the studio albums — a potentially addic
tive practice. A poem by Percy Shelley
reprinted on the back cover of Sound Af
fects reads:" Rise like lions after slumber/
In unvanquishable number/ Shake your
chains to earth like dew/ Which in sleep
had fallen on you—/ Ye are many — they
are few. .Rise, America. It's not too
late to discover the Jam. Dig?

"What have I learnt? BELIEF IS
ALL!" —so, Paul Weller, lead singer and
guitarist for the Jam and spiritual guru for
fans all over the world, proclaims on the
liner notes for his latest and final product,
Dig the New Breed. The Jam believe in the
power of music. It is a reaffirmation of the
