than anyone could have guessed
- il doesn't so much dissipate as
rot on the screen. Like many
other Pulitzer Prize winners (The

Gamma Rays on Man-in-the-
Monn Marigolds and The Gin
(lame are sonic other examples)
it rehashes die mainstream,
done-to-death themes so indi
genous to the plays ot O'Neill
and Williams and Arthur Miller:
the security of illusion and the
American way of business.
Twenty-four years after a
Scranton high school basketball

team's "championship season,"
four of its members reunite at the
home of their old coach for an
evening of revivified old
memories and bitter home
truths. (Where would Broadway
be without bitter home truths?)
George Sikowski (Bruce Dern),
Scranton's corrupt mayor, is
seeking re-election; James
Daley (Stacy Reach), a junior
high school principal, has joined
forces with him, as his campaign
manager; Phil Romano (Paul
Sorvino, repeating his stage per
formance), now a successful
businessman, has provided the

capital for this venture. All three
men have attained, according to
their proud old coach, Delaney
(Robert Mitchum), the zeniths
of their respective professions.
The fourth addition to the party
is James' kid brother Tommy
(Martin Sheen), a sometime wri
ter, full-time nomad, alcoholic
and cynic; the missing member is
Martin Rhodes, the fair-haired
boy of the team, who left town
after graduation and hasn't been
heard from since.
If the set-up isn't obvious to
you by this time, you probably
haven't seen any recent revivals

of Arthur Miller, whose spirit the
author of That Championship
Season has invoked (along with
his name). Delaney, the stal
wartly right-wing counselor/
father confessor — the men still
call him "coach" — who now suf
fers from a symbolic bleeding
ulcer, is the Willy Loman who
has taught his boys to pursue all
the wrong dreams. Even his dic
tion recalls Willy's weird phras
ing, sing-song, maudlin and un
specifically but undeniably
ethnic: "Don't come apart be
fore my very eyes, boys — not in

front of me, boys — because you
boys are my real trophies," he
admonishes them in one critical
moment. Jason Miller has a hell
of a nerve accepting credit for
this stuff — James' monologue
about caring for his dying father
is practically lifted out of Arthur
Miller's The Price (a play I'd
hoped never to encounter again
in any form), and is in the initial
campaign scenes, inserted to
"open up" the play for the sc
reen, I counted three steals from
Nashville. He's a democratic
horse thief, snatching from
everywhere without regard for
class or quality.
Even if you don't recognize
Jason Miller's sources, the
dialogue and the zigzag confes
sional structure are bound to
break you up. I counted a dozen
full-scale revelations in less than
90 minutes, and I lost track of the
nonsequiturs. Mitch um, advising
Dern to stand firm in his mar
riage despite his wife's infidelity,
has a long speech about his own
affair with the music teacher, a
certain Miss Morris, part of
which runs as follows: "She used
to make me honey biscuits. She
was very cultured . . . She could
hump like a hundred-dollar
whore. She dropped dead in the
street four years ago. You hold
on to your Marion." Mitchum
doesn't explain in what way
honey biscuits are a sign of "cul

ture," or why, exactly, Dern
should strive to keep his wife.
Because she is as sexually adept
as Miss Morris? Because if he
lets her go, she too might drop
dead in the street?
I don't know how anyone
could make this material work
except, possibly, by playing it for
laughs — ridiculing the fact that
these grown men still cry to their
high school coach when their
lives go awry. But Miller doesn't
want us to miss a single nuance of

'Delaney, the stalwartly right-wing
counselor/father confessor who now suffers
from a symbolic bleeding ulcer, is the Willy
Loman who has taught his boys to pursue all
the wrong dreams'

this masterly writing, so he slows
everything down; you can practi
cally see a highlighter pointing
up sections of his sacred text.
(Richard Halsey's editing
doesn't help.) And then, he's
gathered himself a crew of actors
who simply don't occupy the
same sphere. Robert Mitchum
has never looked worse or given
a more desicated performance;
straitjacketing him in Coach De
laney's endless, redundant
tirades seems like an act of
cruelty to an actor of impressive,
though limited, talent whose
specialty is laconic, frighteningly
sexual characters. If you want to
find out (painlessly) what Mitch
um's problem is in That Champ
ionship Season, watch him in
something like "The Night of the
Hunter or Cape Fear and then
imagine him playing Willy Lo
man. Sharing the screen with
Mitchum are Bruce Dern and
Stacy Keach, neither of whom
has ever shown much capacity
for sharing: in the scenes in
which they are asked to de
monstrate the power of
camaraderie, they practically
butt heads. Paul Sorvino's stage
timing works for him in the first
hour, when he's much more
amusing than usual, but when

Phil's lines slip into bathos, Sor
vino just drowns. The only really
decent performance is given by
Martin Sheen, whose extended
drunk scene gets funnier as it
goes along. Of course, since
Tommy is the play's Greek
chorus, undercutting all the
other characters (until the insuf
ferable last moments), Sheen has
a distinct advantage over his col
leagues. He manages to escape
this fiasco with relatively minor
injuries.
