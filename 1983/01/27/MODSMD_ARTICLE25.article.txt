than anyone could have guessed
- il doesn't so much dissipate as
rot on the screen. Like many
other Pulitzer Prize winners (The
Subject Was Roses, No Place lo
He Somebody, The Effect of
Gamma Rays on Man-in-the-
Monn Marigolds and The Gin
(lame are sonic other examples)
it rehashes die mainstream,
done-to-death themes so indi
genous to the plays ot O'Neill
and Williams and Arthur Miller:
the security of illusion and the
American way of business.
Twenty-four years after a
Scranton high school basketball

team's "championship season,"
four of its members reunite at the
home of their old coach for an
evening of revivified old
memories and bitter home
truths. (Where would Broadway
be without bitter home truths?)
George Sikowski (Bruce Dern),
Scranton's corrupt mayor, is
seeking re-election; James
Daley (Stacy Reach), a junior
high school principal, has joined
forces with him, as his campaign
manager; Phil Romano (Paul
Sorvino, repeating his stage per
formance), now a successful
businessman, has provided the

capital for this venture. All three
men have attained, according to
their proud old coach, Delaney
(Robert Mitchum), the zeniths
of their respective professions.
The fourth addition to the party
is James' kid brother Tommy
(Martin Sheen), a sometime wri
ter, full-time nomad, alcoholic
and cynic; the missing member is
Martin Rhodes, the fair-haired
boy of the team, who left town
after graduation and hasn't been
heard from since.
If the set-up isn't obvious to
you by this time, you probably
haven't seen any recent revivals

of Arthur Miller, whose spirit the
author of That Championship
Season has invoked (along with
his name). Delaney, the stal
wartly right-wing counselor/
father confessor — the men still
call him "coach" — who now suf
fers from a symbolic bleeding
ulcer, is the Willy Loman who
has taught his boys to pursue all
the wrong dreams. Even his dic
tion recalls Willy's weird phras
ing, sing-song, maudlin and un
specifically but undeniably
ethnic: "Don't come apart be
fore my very eyes, boys — not in
