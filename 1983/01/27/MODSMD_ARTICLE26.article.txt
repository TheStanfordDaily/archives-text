Kiss Me Goodbye, Charlie
Peters' Americanization of
Dona Flor and Her Two Hus
bands, was directed by Robert
Mulligan and stars Sally Field as
the widow of a Gower
Champion-type director

choreographer (James Caan)
who is about to remarry — an
Egyptologist (Jeff Bridges) —
when the ghost of her first hus
band reappears and causes all
sorts of trouble. I never saw
Dona Flor, but the roots of an
older property glare beneath
Kiss Me Goodbye's 1982 bleach:
Noel Coward's Blithe Spirit.
(There's even a role for Mildred
Natwick, who played the energe
tic medium, Madame Arcati, in
Blithe Spirit on Broadway.) All
of this film's distinctions are
negative ones: it contains Sally
Field's worst performance to
date, and neither of the two lead
ing men has ever been miscast
quite so abominably — Caan as a
raffish ghost and Bridges as a
single-minded nerd. When Jeff
Bridges made his first appear
ances on screen more than a de
cade ago, he demonstrated an
uncompromising commitment to
naturalism coupled with more
unstressed talent, perhaps, than
any other American actor of his
generation, but his only good re
cent work was in a movie few
people saw, Cutter's Way, and
accepting a role like this is artis
tically and commercially suici
dal. Basically, he's trying to play
Cary Grant in Bringing Up Baby,
just as Ryan O'Neal was in
What's Up, Doc?, and though
he's many times the actor O'Neal
is, this brand of farce is so far
beyond his capabilities that he
ends up looking just as bad. Kiss
Me Goodbye marks the first time
I've ever felt embarrassed for
Jeff Bridges.
