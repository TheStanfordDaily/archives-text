Whenever I see a movie by
Rainer Werner Fassbinder, I feel
somewhat inadequate, because
his celebrated genius has always
eluded me. Veronika Voss, one
of thee /idently perpetual supply
of posthumous Fassbinder
works, is full of the kind of
cinematic allusiveness and self
proclaiming flourishes that his
followers adore: the plot, about a
former movie queen (Rosel
Zech) now at the mercy of a pre
datory psychiatrist (Annemarie
Duringer) who supplies heroin
for her, is a variation of Sunset
Boulevard, and evry scene in it is
a hyperbolic version of Hol

'It rehashes the mainstream, done-to-death
themes so indigenous to the plays of O'Neill
and Williams and Arthur Miller: the
security of illusion and the American way of
business

lywood filmmaking of the '40s
and '50s. However, just making
these connections doesn't fill a
movie up. Veronika Voss is
neither moving nor funny, and
since everyone in it acts in the
same overwrought, emblematic
style, I had difficulty distinguish
ing performances and scenes in

my head two days after I'd seen
it.
