In Moonlighting, Jeremy Irons
plays Nowak, a Polish electrician
whose boss sends him to London
to supervise four other workers
preparing a house the boss plans
to move into (when and if he gets
out of Poland). The workers,

who gain temporary entry into
England by lying to the immigra
tion officer, represent a consid
erable saving for their employer:
he would have to pay British
electricians four times the wages
to perform the same job. In the
course of their month-long stay
in London, the coup occurs in

their native Poland. Nowak, the
only one of them who under
stands English, keeps the news
from them until the last possible
moment so that he can wring as
much labor out of them as possi
ble, and he even resorts to lock
ing them in the house so that they
won't stumble across any infor
mation. Nowak is a Marxist vil
lain, and since the movie (written
and directed by Jerzy
Skolimowski) is seen entirely
through his eyes, it is impossibly
arid and sour. So is Jeremy Irons'
performance, which seems to be
all about his Polish accent. It
takes the workers nearly an hour
and a half to rebel, and by that
time Skolimowski's wandering
camera and rigorous didacticism
have buried any interest we
might have had in what happens
to them.
