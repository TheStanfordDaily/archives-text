# Stomach flu hits campus
## 
### KAREN SPRINGEN 
Many students here are staying
home for more reasons than the rain
this week because of gastroenteritis, a
24- to 48-hour viral illness better
known as the stomach flu.
Cowell Student Health Center does
not keep track of specific numbers, but
gastroenteritis, characterized by fever,
nausea and diarrhea, is most prevalent
in the winter, according to James
McClenahan, director of student
health services.
The virus causes an inflammation of
the gastro-intestinal tract and the
bowel, which is manifested in the
stomach through nausea and vomiting.
Diarrhea results because the in
flamed colon is unable to absorb the
liquid from food.
"It's probably passed some through
the air and some through common kis
sing, drinking and oral contact,"
McClenahan said.
Treatment is symtomatic. "But you
can help things by putting the gastroin
testinal tract at rest," McClenahan
said. Stomach flu victims should drink
clear fluids, rest and cut down on in
take, avoiding fried foods and dairy
products and, initially, all food, he said.
Nausea and vomiting are usually fol
lowed by diarrhea within eight to 12
hours.
Because of the acute symptoms,
many people think they have food
poisoning. However, McClenahan
said,"lt's just very unusual to have true
food poisoning."
Junior Elizabeth Arnesen said, "I
just felt really nauseous all of the sud
den. I was really tired, I felt like I had a

fever ... 1 felt sick after I ate some
thing." Arnesen, who contracted gas
troenteritis immediately after return
ing from winter break, said several of
her friends have also gotten stomach
flu.
Senior Craig Warner said the one
day flu spread among his close friends.
"It seems to be a pattern that it lasts
one day. It's just severe stomach upset,
nausea, vomiting. It basically just in
capacitates you for one day."
Medical Prof. Bill Robinson said,
"Certainly it (gastroenteritis) is a
winter problem in this country."
Other illnesses, such as the respirat
ory disease influenza and the viral dis
ease chicken pox, are also more com
mon during the winter.
Gastroenteritis is "very contagious,"
Robinson said, which accounts for its
spread through dorms.
Epidemic diseases, which usually af
fect only adults, Robinson said, "are
actually outbreaks among populations
that are susceptible."
Robinson said, "It's brought in
probably by somebody who has
traveled in the East Coast." Gastroen
teritis viruses are usually spread by in
dividuals who travel, he said, pointing
out that the viruses are not found in
animals.
John Dorman, clinical coordinator at
Cowell, recommended a clear liquid
diet and tylenol.
