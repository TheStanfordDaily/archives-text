# Fraternities dismiss effect of new campus housing
## 
### MARK GILLIS Staff writer 
Although the recent opening of
Governor's Corner has led to specula
tion that the added housing will hurt
fraternities, fraternity members and
some Row Office employees remain
optimistic that the fraternity system
will continue to attract its share of the
University's students.
One cause for the speculation that
the new suites will take prospective
pledges away from fraternities is based
on the idea that fraternities are depen
dent upon unguaranteed students and
freshmen who draw poorly to fill their
quotas. Members of several houses
claim that that notion is a misconcep
tion.
Sigma Chi President Phil Ebling
said. " I think that the major attraction
that the fraternities have is not so much
in the kinds of rooms or the houses, it's
the people in the house. Regardless of
whether other modes of housing are

available, we're still going to be doing
all right."
Alpha Delt President Dave
Chenevert said he feels that the popu
larity of his house is rising. "We're op
timistic about rush this year. There are
lots more people coming to our house
this year and our parties are much more
crowded than last year."
Another cause for concern about the
future of some fraternities has been
that many houses have been taking
boarders.
Inter-Fraternity Council President
Andy Beal explained that houses with
boarders represent neither a new situa
tion nor a bad sign. "Having them is not
necessarily a problem with popularity.
Some members will want to live off
campus their senior year and others are
overseas, so you'll have open spaces
particularly in winter and spring quar
ters. However, I don't think the
number of people joining frats from
rush has gone down in the past couple

of years."
Reflecting this view of seasonal
shifts, Chenevert said, "We have some
open spaces for boarders because we
have a large house. But, last year was
our biggest pledge class in a long time
with 29 new members."
He also acknowledged that pledge
numbers go up and down. The pledge
class the last two years has been small
for them, Chenevert said. "We've been
over and under by large amounts some
times; the trouble is getting the right
amount."
Dean of Student Affairs Jim Lyons
has said in regard to the freeze on new
fraternity and sorority housing, "It's
time for us to look again at the propor
tion of the residential system that we
want to allocate to fraternal organiza
tions."
Beal denied that Lyons' statements
or the housing freeze indicates that the
administration would like to make
dramatic changes in the fraternity sys

tern. "In the past four years though the
administration allowed applications for
housing, they've let the people who've
applied know that the chance of getting
a house was very unlikely, and they
have not offered one in that time,"
Beal said.
Despite what he called some bad
press, Beal said he felt the administra
tion does not look unfavorably upon
fraternities. "They acknowledge that
we have positive aspects and are a good
housing alternative. Much of the press
is deserved because of bad behavior on
our part. They are understandably con
cerned about these problems."
He said the fraternities deserve but
do not get any good press even though
the administration approves of them.
Referring particularly to a letter to the
Daily written by a faculty member, he
said," It is the faculty that puts pressure
on the administration to change the
fraternity system because they feel that
uni icivir u nn L
frats do not contribute to the ideals of
residential education and are counter
productive. The administration has
been defending us."
Chenevert said that possible prob
lems peculiar to the fraternity do not
make them any worse than a dormi
tory.
Jim Cadena of the Row Office ex
pressed an equally positive view of
Stanford's fraternity system: "They are
another residential option and the only
difference is that they have the
privilege of choosing their own mem
bers. There is some worry about access
to them, but elitism is a charge based on
a personal opinion, one which I don't
think applies to them."
Responding to the housing freeze,
Cadena said that re-evaluation of the
entire University housing system is an
ongoing process and that fraternities
are not now the main concern. "We
have figures from the draw that indi
cate we need to look at co-ops and
theme houses because they are not fil
ling up," he said.
Theta Xi is one fraternity whose
members are uncertain about their fu
ture. Co-president Andy Chan said the
housing change will have an effect on
his house because the people who have
joined it the past two years have drawn
poorly. "Two years ago our group re
ally wanted to live together and
couldn't ensure it through the draw, so
we joined from necessity, but we've re
ally enjoyed living here," he said.
Row Director Diana Conklin said
she thought that some houses could
possible be in trouble because of the
new housing, but she said, "No matter

how much housing there is, there will
always be some frats that fill because
they are solid and are always doing ac
tivities."
Conklin, in response to the advent of
new housing, said each fraternity will
have to accentuate all the programs
and benefits unique to that house.
"They will now need to focus in their
rush activities on why someone would
want to join them beyond the assur
ance of housing," she said.
Conklin added that the fraternity
system as a whole has fallen well short
of its quota the past three years, mis
sing by 19.5 sophomore equivalency
points in 1982, by 8.5 in 1981, and by
16 in 1980. With 500 spaces, frater
nities make up 14 percent of the 3581
non-freshmen spaces for under
graduates, and must provide housing
for 14 percent of all non-freshmen stu
dents with two years of housing remain
ing. "Frats are required to take their
share of the males," she said.
Fraternities as a whole are expected
to pledge 195 sophomore equivalents
each year, with sophomores counting
as one and juniors or seniors with a
guaranteed year counting as one-half.
Conklin said that 19.5 was quite a large
margin by which to miss the quota.
"Some of that, however, may be pur
poseful, not a drop in popularity, be
cause frats often take many juniors that
they like and miss the quota for that
year."
By the Guaranteed Housing Plan
approved in 1975, if the fraternity sys
tem collectively misses the quota for
two consecutive years, the Office of
Residential Education can put the
house with the largest share deficit into
the draw.
"There is a problem, and, unless they
take some fairly immediate and effec
tive action to improve rush results,
we're going to have to look at the pos
sibility of placing a house in the draw,"
she said.
