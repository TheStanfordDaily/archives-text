Both parties rebuff Reagan
Washington â€” Less than 24 hours after his appeal for bipartisan coopera
tion on a program to pull the country out of recession, President Reagan was
rebuffed yesterday by some old allies as well as by many of his traditional
Democratic foes.
As a result, the president's defense spending proposals as well as his plan
for a standbv tax increase of up to $150 billion were in deep trouble.
In addition, Republicans in both the Senate and House planned to push
for a $2 billion job-creation program that would go far beyond the presi
dent's proposals for dealing with unemployment, now at 10.8 percent.
The resistance to key parts of Reagan's plan, as laid down in his State of
the I Inion address Tuesday night, was illustrated by a statement issued by
Alexander Trowbridge, president of the National Association of Manufac
turers. an allv of the president during his first two years in office,
"It troubles us that the president is proposing a 9 percent real (after adjust
ments lor inflation) increase in defense spending over the next five years,"
rrowbridge said. "In order to bring down the deficit, and in the interests of
fairness, we feel his proposed inreases in defense spending should be re
duced."
