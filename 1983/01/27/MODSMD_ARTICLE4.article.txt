Both parties rebuff Reagan
Washington — Less than 24 hours after his appeal for bipartisan coopera
tion on a program to pull the country out of recession, President Reagan was
rebuffed yesterday by some old allies as well as by many of his traditional
Democratic foes.
As a result, the president's defense spending proposals as well as his plan
for a standbv tax increase of up to $150 billion were in deep trouble.
In addition, Republicans in both the Senate and House planned to push
for a $2 billion job-creation program that would go far beyond the presi
dent's proposals for dealing with unemployment, now at 10.8 percent.
The resistance to key parts of Reagan's plan, as laid down in his State of
the I Inion address Tuesday night, was illustrated by a statement issued by
Alexander Trowbridge, president of the National Association of Manufac
turers. an allv of the president during his first two years in office,
"It troubles us that the president is proposing a 9 percent real (after adjust
ments lor inflation) increase in defense spending over the next five years,"
rrowbridge said. "In order to bring down the deficit, and in the interests of
fairness, we feel his proposed inreases in defense spending should be re
duced."
Trowbridge also referred to administration esti
mates that the budget deficit for fiscal year 1984
starting next Oct. I would be SI 89 billion, then rise
to 5194 billion in the following year and drop to
only SI 17 billion bv 1988.
"The most troubling aspect of the president's
speech is that, in spite of his proposals, projected
federal deficits will remain unacceptably high next
vear and for vears to come," Trowbridge said.
Meanwhile, a group of Senate Republican lead
ers met with Secretary of Defense Caspar Wein
berger to discuss possible reductions in the Pen
tagon's spending program even before it was for
mally sent to Capitol Hill. Emerging from that
closed session. Senate Majority Leader Howard
Baker (R-Tenn.) said, "We face a real donnybrook
on defense (spending) this year. It's going to be a
ferocious debate."
State may extend deficit
Sacramento — Assembly Democrats, faced with
paying state workers and creditors with IOUs,
gave in vesterdav to Republican Gov. George Deu
kmejian's demand that a large chunk of this year's
$ 1.5 billion deficit be carried over to next year.
"I suspect that whether anyone likes it or not, we
are in fact locked into some form of dealing with
the deficit beyond June 30," the end of the fiscal
year, said Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San
Francisco).
The Assembly Ways and Means Committee,
with reluctant Democratic votes, approved a bill
containing Deukmejian's plan, after removing $25
million in proposed welfare cuts.
The bill, which will be sent to the Assembly floor
lor a vote today, would make about $580 million in
cuts and fund transfers. It has no tax increases and
would leave nearly a $ 1 billion deficit to be paid by
somehow cutting the 1983-84 budget.
But the Assembly Democrats' capitulation did
not please Democrats in the Senate, where a simi
lar bill is scheduled to be heard Thursday in the Fi
nance Committee.
Finance Committee Chairman Alfred Alquist
(D-San Jose) said he doubted his committee would
approve the plan, saying he would not vote for
"any program that does not have a balanced
budget."
Senate President Pro Tem David Roberti (D-
Los Angeles) said Senate Democrats don't like the
plan because of the "huge deficit," but he wouldn't
say if the Senate would approve the bill.
The two parties had been stalemated since early
December, with Republican generally opposing
lax increases and insisting on large spending cuts,
and Democrats saving tax increases were in
evitable.
High unemployment to continue
Washington — Treasury Secretary Donald Re
gain said yesterday that unemployment will average
10.7 percent this year and remain in double digits
for several months into 1984, but he still insisted
the nation has "turned the corner" toward eco
nomic recovery.
Regan also told Congress' Joint Economic
Committee that interest rates must come down
further for a lasting recovery to take place.
"I would think they'll have to decline further foi
sustained recovery. They are down low enough to
permit the beginning of a recovery," he said.
The Reagan administration's economic fore
cast, scheduled to be released next week, calls for a
relatively weak recovery beginning later this year,
but with high unemployment hanging on.
Inflation is expected to inch up from last year's
3.9 percent rise in consumer prices, and interest
rates are expected to decline slowly under the fore
cast.
Regan said the official forecast is for joblessness
averaging 10.7 percent this year and 9.9 percent
next year — meaning it would be above 10 percent
for at least several months in 1984. He said the
forecast did not predict 11 percent joblessness for
any three-month period.
Current joblessness is 10.8 percent, and the
levels in the forecast are higher than anything the
country has experienced since it emerged from the
Great Depression.
The forecast also seems certain to rekindle de
mands from congressional Democrats for passage
of a public works jobs program. The House ap
proved such a measure last year, but Reagan
threatened to veto it and the plan was sidetracked.
Instead, Reagan is expected to propose several
other measures later this year to deal with un
employment. Thev include providing tax credits to
companies hiring the long-term unemployed, and
increasing spending on training programs for
workers who have been laid off.
Soviets say time running out
Ceneva, Switzerland — The United States hinted
at possible compromise, but the Kremlin's chief
delegate to the medium-range nuclear missiles re
duction talks said American and Soviet nego

tiators are running out of time for reaching an
agreement.
Soviet negotiator Yuli Kvitsinsky predicted a
"new round of the arms race" if the two sides fail to
reach an accord on reducing intermediate-range
nuclear arsenals in Europe.
In Washington, President Reagan hinted strong
ly in his State of the Union address Tuesday that he
is prepared to compromise at the negotiating table
if the terms are right.
U.S. negotiator Paul Nitze had signaled Rea
gan's new stance earlier, telling reporters here the
president "certainlv is not locked into" a nuclear
arms reduction plan repeatedly rejected bv the So
viets.
The talks resume here today after a two-month
recess and a stepped-up public relations drive by
the Soviets to influence opinion in Western Europe
— where 572 new U.S. nuclear missiles are slated
to be based.
Kvitsinskv told reporters Tuesday: "The time is
approaching when a choice will have to be made
between an agreement on joint steps to reduce the
level of nuclear confrontation, or a new round of
the arms race."
Kvitsinsky heads the delegation at the medium
range missile talks, which have been running par
allel to negotiations on strategic, or intercontinen
tal, nuclear forces. Those talks are scheduled to re
sume Keb. 2.
The Soviet delegate urged the United States to
show its willingness "to come to an accord" and
said the issue of nuclear arms in Europe "is becom
ing increasinglv urgent and accute."
He said the offer last month bv Soviet leader
Yuri Andropov "provides an opportunity" for ne
gotiated settlement.
Andropov offered to reduce the number of Sovi
et intermediate-range nuclear missiles aimed at
Western Europe to 162 if NATO scraps plans to
deploy new U.S. missiles. The United States has re
jected the plan as giving the Soviet Union a nuclear
edge.
Paul "Bear" Bryant dies •
Paul "Bear" Brvant, 69, who won more games
than anv other coach in the history of American
college football, died vesterdav at Druid City Hos
pital in Tuscaloosa, Ala., after a heart attack, less
than a month after he retired from active coaching.
On Nov. 28, 1981, Brvant became the winningest
coach in college historv when Alabama beat
Auburn, 28-17, for Bryant's 315 th career victory,
surpassing Amos Alonzo Stagg's record of 314
wins.
In an interview with The Washington Post that
month, Brvant was asked what he would do when
he retired from coaching. "I imagine I'll go straight
to the graveyard," he said.
In a 38-vear career, including 25 years at the
University of Alabama, Bryant's lifetime record
was 323-85-17. At Alabama he never had a losing
season, and his teams won five national cham
pionships. Under Bryant, the Crimson Tide partic
ipated in a record 24 consecutive postseason bowl
games.
Physicians said Bryant died after suffering a
massive heart attack while being X-rayed at the
hospital, where he had been admitted Tuesday af
ter suffering chest pains. His personal physician,
William Hill, said Bryant's heart stopped beating
at 12:24 p.m. CST and immediate efforts were
made to restore his heartbeat.
"We did put a pacemaker through his chest and
were able to restore a weak heartbeat," Hill said.
But he said Brvant was declared dead at about 1:30
p.m. Hill said Brvant had been on medication for
mild heart trouble during the past few years.
Bryant's death came as a surprise, because
earlier in the day he had been reported in good spir
its. "This morning he joked about going to Las
Vegas," Hill said. "He said one thing he wanted to
do was go back to Arkansas and do some duck
hunting."
A legend in the state of Alabama, Bryant's na
tional image was that of a craggy-faced man with a
houndstooth-checked hat and an accent straight
from his native Moro Creek, Ark., where he earned
his nickname as a teen-ager by wrestling with a
bear for a dollar at a country fair.
After his retirement-m Dec. 14, Bryant agreed to
remain at Alabama as director of athletics. Ray
Perkins, head football coach of the New York
Giants and one of Bryant's former players, was
named to succeed him as head coach.
Among the more notable NFL players to have
played under Brvant at Alabama were quarter
backs Ken Stabler, Joe Namath and Richard
Todd.
Troops may stay in Lebanon
Jerusalem — Defense Minister Ariel Sharon said
yesterday that Israeli troops should be allowed to
man "anti-terror supervision stations" in southern
Lebanon for an unspecified length of time because
only thev are capable of preventing the infiltration
of Palestinian guerrillas.

Speaking to a group of American and Canadian
Jews attending an Israel Bonds conference here,
Sharon provided new details on Israel's demand
for the creation of a "security zone" in southern
Lebanon as part of a troop withdrawal agreement
with the Lebanese. His remarks appeared to repre
sent Israel's response to the mounting U.S. com
plaints about Israel's demands in the negotiations
on troop withdrawal.
Sharon said Israel was asking to leave behind in
Lebanon a small number of troops to man stations
for a "limited period," although he did not specify
how long this would be.
He also vowed that in the negotiations Israel will
not abandon its Lebanese Christian ally in south
ern Lebanon, Saad Haddad, arguing that until the
Lebanese army is strengthened, Haddad's militia
will be the onlv "efficient troops" in the area.
"Haddad fought in the most loyal way together
with our forces, and Israel will not let down people
who fought with our forces," he said.
Sharon acknowledged that there is a dispute
with the United States over the security zone issue
but said it did not involve a looming "confronta
tion" between the countries.
In recent days, however, U.S. officials have
made clear their differences with the Israelis on this
issue. In the negotiations, the United States has
sided with Lebanon's demand that the Israeli troop
withdrawal be total and that any military installa
tions established in the security zone be operated
bv non-Israeli personnel.
On Sundav, U.S. special envoy Philip Habib re
portedlv suggested to Prime Minister Menachem
Begin and Sharon several options to do the job: an
expanded multinational force, the United Nations
force stationed in southern Lebanon, the Lebanese
army or a combination of all three. But the Israelis
rebuffed Habib's suggestions, apparently on the
grounds that Sharon voiced yesterday.
Mysterious disease strikes
Los Angeles — One patient died after he was
stricken bv an influenza-like illness at a veteran's
hospital and 19 other patients and hospital staff
members are showing symptoms of the disease.
Officials at Wadworth Veterans Administration
Hospital said eight staff members have come down
with symptoms of the same disease that struck 11
patients in the cardiology ward.
The hospital's chief of infectious diseases, Dr.
Sydney Finegold, said it was not certain whether
the patient's death Tuesday was due to the illness
or to an earlier heart attack.
The symptoms — temperatures of 102 to 104,
shaking chills, body aches, headache and cough —
are not like those of Legionnaires' disease, a type of
pneumonia that hit 200 patients at the hospital
from 1977 to 1981, said Dr. Earl Gordon, chief of
staff.
Shultz to visit Peking
Peking — Four years after the United States and
China established full diplomatic relations, Secre
tary of State George Shultz will visit Peking to find
out what went wrong in that relationship and how
it can be rebuilt.
Shultz, who arrives here next Wednesday for
four days of talks with Chinese leaders, will at
tempt to put Sino-American relations "back on the
track," according to U.S. officials, and to lay a
basis for resolving the problems that continue to
erode what was to be a special relationship between
the two countries.
Mutual confidence was lost during the pro
longed and bitter confrontation over U.S. arms
sales to Taiwan, a senior Western diplomat said.
China is even more disappointed than the United
States in the relationship and Chinese officials
stress that time will be needed to reestablish an at
mosphere of trust.
"We have questions, first of all, about the re
liability of the United States, on how close our
views actually come on international affairs and
what the realistic prospects are for our bilateral re
lations," a Chinese specialist on American affairs
said. "Mr. Shultz, we expect, will have some of the
answers, but we will have to judge the United
States primarily by its actions."
Market results mixed
The stock market turned in a mixed showing yes
terday in a listless response to President Reagan's
State of the Union speech.
But some individual stocks in high-technology
businesses gained ground. In his message Tuesday
night, Reagan spoke of high technology as a "vast
frontier of opportunity."
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, after
fluctuating in a narrow range all day, closed with a
4.04-point loss at 1037.99.
Today's weather
Storm warning. Showers today and tonight,
southwest 15 to 30 knots and becoming
southerly tonight.
