# New facilities planned for animal research

### EVA HENIN 
Research Animal Facility I (RAF I) will replace
half of the Medical School's existing animal
facilities which are currently not in compliance with
existing codes and guidelines, following approval
last month by the board of trustees.
The new facility, estimated to cost between $10
and $ 12 million, is scheduled to be built in 1984.
RAF I will be located underground, south of
Sherman Fairchiid Auditorium. It is the first stage
in the University's plans to overhaul completely its
existing animal facility network over the next de
caide and will help centralize animal research at the
Medical School by replacing many of the existing
facilities scattered in locations behind the Art
Museum and within the Med Center.
Placing a new. modernized facility closer to the
Med School will not only improve quality of animal
care, but will permit greater efficiency in animal
research, according to David Mendelow. associate
dean of administration at the Med School.
RAF I will improve the condition of Stanford's
animal facilities "from something adequate but in
efficient to very good." said Carolyn Reed, as

sociate director of the veterinary section of the Di
vision of Laboratory Animal Medicine.
The project will be funded by approximately $2
million from Med School reserves and $1 million
from University Facility reserves. Tax exempt
bonds through the California Educational Facilities
Authority are expected to finance the balance.
Planning for the new facility began with a site
inspection of Stanford's facilities in late 1980 by the
American Association for the Accreditation of
Laboratory Animal Care. The association reviews
primarily follow the NIH guide for the care and use
of laboratory animals.
Following the inspection, Stanford's accredita
tion was reduced from full to probationary in 1981
and withdrawn completely in 1982. Regarding con
ditions in those facilities. Reed saÂ»d that, among
other problems, the facilities "haven't been main
tained for long periods of time" and contain "air
ventilation systems that are old and probably out
dated."
Other deficiencies cited at the facility include:
- inadequate ventilation, temperature and

humidity control
- inadequate vermin control
- conditions that are not aseptic, and
- inadequate cleaning facilities for animal cages.
According to a study done by McLellan &
Copenhagen. Inc. an architectural and planning
firm contracted by the University to delineate exist
ing conditions. University officials maintain that
conditions within the facilities arc not serious. Reed
admits, however, "the conditions now are certainly
not desirable."
According to a Med School report, based on sev
eral 1980-81 studies"to achieve code and guideline
compliance, all research animal facilities (excepting
those in the Fairchiid Science building and those
planned in the Cardiovascular Research building
now under construction) must be replaced." RAF I
was proposed to replace those facilities in the worst
condition.
"Owing to the state of disrepair, or age, or un
suitability of the facilities proposed for replace
ment. it is not cost-effective to upgrade them." a
committee report to the board states.
