## U.S., Soviets square off as missile negotiations resume Missile support reviewed 
### 
Europeans question U.S. stance

Compiled from news reports and wire ser
vices
Unless some sort of break
through is achieved in the In
termediate-range Nuclear Forces
negotiations in Geneva, the Unit
ed States will start deploying 572
new nuclear missiles in Europe
bv the end of 1983. With Europe
ans sharply divided over the
prospect and over how much to
expect from the Soviets in ex
change for at least an interim
agreement that would delay mis
sile deployment, the issue is one
of the most explosive the NATO
allance has faced. Some fear that
it may cause deep rifts in the al
liance.
At the center of the con
troversy is West Germany, where
parliamentary elections are
scheduled for March 6. The Sovi
ets are particularly worried about

possible West German deploy
ment because the German mis
siles would be the closest to the
Soviet heartland and because the
Ciermans are to receive both Per
shing lis, which can hit Soviet
targets eight minutes after lift
off, and cruise missiles.
Last week Soviet Foreign Min
ister Andrei Gromvko visited
Bonn in an effort to sway public
opinion there against the missile
deployments. Next week Vice
President George Bush will also
visit the West German capital to
try to enhance support of the
American position on missile
deployment.
The idea behind the missile
deployment goes back to the
"two-track" approach originally
taken bv the Carter adminis

tration to arms-limitation talks.
The Carter administration prom
ised to put new missiles in
Western Europe in 1983 while at
the same time conducted nego
tiations with the Soviets in the
hope that the deployment would
not be necessary.
American negotiators in Gene
va are using Reagan's "zero op
tion" as the main negotiating
strategy. The idea is that the So
viets would dismantle all of their
SS-20 missiles in return for a
moratorium on the deployment
of any new American missiles in
Europe.
West Europeans, meanwhile,
have begun to question the
American take-it-or-leave-it
strategy. The Social Democratic
Party in West Germany, which
lost power to the Christian Dem
ocratic Union more than three
months ago, favors putting off
the deployment if an interim
agreement with the Soviets could

he reached, although thev also fa
vor going ahead with deployment
if the talks break down. But
Chancellor Helmut Kohl has re
fused to consider any com
promise, arguing that it would
undermine the U.S. negotiating
position in Geneva.
Public opinion in West Ger

many opposes new missile
deployments. A recent poll
showed that 54 percent of Kohl's
Christian Democratic supporters
favor some sort of delay in the
missile deployment, with 65 per
cent of the Social Democrats and
70 percent of the Free Democrats
supporting such a move.
