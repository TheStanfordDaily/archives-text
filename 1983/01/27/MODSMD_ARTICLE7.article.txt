# Missile pact prospects shaky

Compiled from news reports and wire services
In the effort to slow the arms race in Eu
rope, compromise may be the path for
U.S. arms negotiator Paul Nitze as meet
ings with Soviet representative Yuli
Kvitsinskv resume this week.
The talks, which re-open today after a
two-month recess, are aimed at reducing
intermediate-range nuclear missiles in Eu
rope. To date, however the debate which
began in November of 1981 with the un
veiling of Reagan's zero option has re
sulted in a standoff between the United
States and the Soviet Union.
Reagan's zero option would require the
Soviets to remove the SS-20s aimed at Eu
rope as well as their SS-20s in Asia and
older SS-4s and SS-5s in exchange for
NATO calling off its planned deployment
of the Tomohawk cruise missiles and Per
shing lis.
The Soviets responded with a zero op
tion of their own. The Kremlin argued
that there is already a balance in medium
range missiles in Europe and that each side
should freeze its forces. According to So
viet leader Yuri Andropov there would be
a reduction of 1000 missiles and 600
bombers by 1985. By 1990 the total would
fall to 300 and ultimately to zero.
Crucial to the Soviet proposal is a re
liance on including British and French nu
clear forces in their calculations. How

ever. Westerners contend the Soviets tally
is skewed and includes outmoded Europe
an weapons and doesn't account for their
own Backfire, one of the most potent
planes in the Soviet air force.
Andropov's December offering would
leave 162 SS-20s aimed at Europe to
match the Soviet-calculated 162 French
and British missiles. The Soviet proposal
would leave the United States with fewer
than 50 slots of its own none of which
could be filled with Tomahawks or Per
shing lis under another provision of the
plan.
The Reagan administration has rejected
the proposal on the basis that it would give
the Soviets a greater power capability thus
leaving Europe vulnerable to the Soviet
nation.
A chance to bridge the gap came in July
of 1982 when in Geneva Nitze and his So
viet counterpart, Kvitsinskv, both agreed
to ask their governments to consider a
compromise. The compromise called for
Moscow to shrink its European SS-20
force from 240 to 75. Each missile has
three warheads each. In exchange the
United States and NATO would cancel
the deployment of Pershing 11 missiles and
cut the number of missile launchers from
116 to 75. Each cruise missile has four war
heads.
In addition, the proposal would require

Soviets freeze about 90 SS-20s aimed at
Asia, but allow 150 medium-range bomb
ers in Europe.
The Nitze-Kvitsinskv approach, how
ever, was shortlived. Both the United
States and the Soviet Union rejected the
plan as unacceptable; the United States
because it feared the sacrifice of Pershing
II and the Soviets because they calculated
they could do better by holding out for no
American missiles at all.
In the six months that have followed
pressure from ally nations may however
have softened U.S. resolve to effect the
zero option. Nitze told reporters Tuesday
that the United States is "not locked into
the zero option" but that Reagan still be
lieves it to be the "bestway" to achieve
peace and security.
Nitze would not say whether or not he
hoped to resurrect his summer proposal
but did say the United States is "prepared
to examine every kind of proposal that se
cures the security interests of out NATO
allies as well as ourselves."
Kvitsinskv also urged that negotiators
"come to an accord" and indicated that
the opportunity to do so should not be ig
nored. "The time is approaching when a
choice will have to be made between an
agreement on joint steps to reduce the
level of nuclear confrontation, or a new
round of the arms race," Kvitsinsky said.

hoped to resurrect his summer proposal
but did say the United States is "prepared
to examine every kind of proposal that se
cures the security interests of out NATO
allies as well as ourselves."
Kvitsinskv also urged that negotiators
"come to an accord" and indicated that
the opportunity to do so should not be ig
nored. "The time is approaching when a
choice will have to be made between an
agreement on joint steps to reduce the
level of nuclear confrontation, or a new
round of the arms race," Kvitsinsky said.
