# U.S., Soviets confer; missile deployment dialogue deadlocked
## 
### 
Compiled from news reports and wire services
The deadlock between the United States and the Soviet Union on
the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) challenges one of
NATO's most important collective decisions — deployment of 572
new American missiles in Western Europe.
The talks, set to resume in Geneva today, are frenzied because the
issue is urgent and international.
When the Carter administration agreed in Dec. 1979 to place new
missiles in Europe bv 1983, it also promised to conduct arms-limita
tion talks with the Soviets, in hopes that the actual deployment would
not be necessary. The request for a NATO buildup originally came
from Western Europe.
Now, however, the U.S. missiles face a growing opposition from
West European nations such as West Germany and Britain.
If no arms agreement is reached, NATO is committed to begin
deployment of the Pershing II and Tomahawk cruise missiles through
out West Germany, Britain, Belgium, Italy and the Netherlands.
Basically, the United States operates from the zero-option idea,
which would require the Soviets to remove the SS-20s which presently
threaten Europe, along with the older SS-4 and SS-5 models. NATO,
in return, would call off its plans to deploy the Pershing lis and the
Tomahawks.
Specifically, the nuclear missiles which form the crux of contention
are intermediate-range, meaning that they are designed to fly no more
than 3000 miles. This puts almost all U.S. territory out of range but
leaves most of the Soviet Union and all of Europe vulnerable.
On the Soviet side, the SS-20 is a comparable missile to the U.S.
Pershing 11. Over the past six years Moscow has deployed some 340 ol
these as replacements for the outdated SS-4s and SS-ss.
The Soviets plainly just want the Americans out of Europe. The>
have, over the months, offered insubstantial "concessions" such as a
freeze on existing forces and a slow phasing out by 1985; the plan was
not agreeable to the United States because it rules out deployment ol
American missiles without a reduction in the Soviets'.
The problem stems from negotiations which concern Soviet missile*
already in service, as opposed to U.S. missiles not yet deployed. Given
the political troubles in Western Europe, Moscow is reluctant to dis
mantle its forces in exchange for "paper" reductions on the U.S. side
Moreover, the SS-20 is considered the pride of the Soviet Strategic
Rocket Forces; the care and funding which has gone into the projeci
makes it unlikely that the Soviets will give it up easily.
Meanwhile, the stalemate between the two countries makes tht
NATO proposition look like a bluff because at this point deployment
may not be politically possible in Europe.
With elections coming up, Germany and Britain are facing a bar
rage of parliamentary and popular hostility. The hope that actual
deployment will not be necessary accounts for the deadlock and the
exercise of another option — postponement.
