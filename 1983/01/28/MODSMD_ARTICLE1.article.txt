## Crews clean campus, new storm coming 
### GLEN ALLERHAND Staff writer 
University clean-up crews worked
late Wednesday night and all day yes
terday to restore the campus to order
after Wednesday's storm, which
flooded much of the campus, caused
power outages, slowed traffic and top
pled trees.
The cleanup is expected to be com
pleted by the middle of next week, ac
cording to James Horgan, director of
operations and maintenance. But Hor
gan said that he and his crew are brac
ing for another storm, predicted to hit
the area today.
Horgan estimated that storm-related
costs would total $10,000 to $20,000.
The estimate included overtime pay for
operations and maintenance workers
plus the costs of hiring a backhoe (a
bulldozer with a scorpion-type hoe on
the back) to help alleviate flooding
near Governor's Corner.
Tresidder Union, which lost its elec
tricity Wednesday after water flooded
the basement and shorted out the
transformer, regained power at 7:30
last night, according to Ellie Op
penheim, director of Tresidder Union.
Oppenheim said Tresidder was hooked
up to the transformer for the new
Braun Music Center. "We were very

lucky that the transformer for the new
Braun Music Center had arrived," she
said. ,
Oppenheim said that all Tresidder
services except the Coffee House will
be open during their normal business
hours today. The Coffee House will not
open until noon.
Tresidder lost its power at about 6
p.m. Wednesday and stayed closed all
day yesterday. Hoef said that Tresidder
food supplies were kept from spoiling
when employees placed dry ice in the
freezers. He said much of the food was
transferred to the University commis
sary.
Food was also being moved to a
freezer truck yesterday afternoon,
Hoef said. Food service at Tresidder
will be back to normal today although
some items will be missing from the
menu because Tresidder could not ac
cept its regular shipments yesterday.
Horgan said that in anticipation of
the storm forecast for today, the opera
tions and maintenance crew would not
do a full-scale clean-up until next
week. He said his crew, which he
termed the "war council," was well
prepared to handle any new rains.
Many crew members have said they
will be available to work should
