# The 						question Mark
## Packing for college: fruit-fly traps? 
### 
Thirty minutes. Socks, pants, shirts, shoes. Twenty-five
minutes. Jacket, gloves and umbrella. Twenty minutes.
Money, checkbook, credit cards. Fifteen minutes. Keys,
toothbrush, toothpaste. Ten minutes. Hairdryer, shaver,
slippers. Five minutes. The car speeds off to the airport. . . .
The trauma of last-minute packing. Symptoms: high
blood pressure, nervousness and anxiety. Classification:
potentially lethal.
If packing for a vacation is often hurried and spontane
ous, packing for college is clearly a totally different
phenomenon. 1 suppose it is nice that the process is longer,
and thus calmer, but, looking at the multifarious collection
of oddities that students bring, I can't help wondering why
some things were brought along.
Handcuffs, for example. Why do students need to bring
handcuffs? Assuming that they're not being used as a
"handy" bike lock, why would anyone possibly want a pair
of handcuffs here? To make a citizen's arrest? To chain
oneself to modern sculpture to protest nuclear prolifera
tion? Certainly not to lock oneself to a desk in Green
Library before midterms?
Or what about swords and foils (brought by non-fencers).
Are they for shiskkebab barbeques? Could they be for
slaying ferocious silverfish that reside in the bathrooms?
Along the same line, there are poeple who bring combi
nation safes, burglar alarms and fire extinguishers. Are the
safes for storing calculus notes? Are the fire extinguishers
for an anti-smoking crusade?

Then, of course, there is an endless list of appliances.
The range goes from ice makers to answering machines to
remote controlled robots and computers. Sometimes,
though, it is the quantity that is surprising. Why does any
one room need three popcorn machines, or three television
sets, or four stereos? Or individuals with two tape decks? Or
two electronic video arcade games?
Other things in great quantities seem equally unusual.
Two bicycles seems a little unnecessary . . . but 28 pairs of
shoes? Or the entire library of both Monarch and Cliff
notes?
And why do so many people bring all of those signs with
them? No, I don't mean the trigonometric type. There are
stop signs, "No Parking" signs, "Men at Work" signs (not
the music group) and "University of California ... No
Trespassing" signs. The University does offer courses in
sign language, but. . . .
Then there are some of us who just can't do without
certain luxuries. 1 am referring to modest items such as air
conditioners and waterbeds. On the other hand, some
things defy any form of categorization, such as busts of
Caesar, rocks (not brought by a budding geologist) and a
stuffed "hug".
To be sure, some things, like fruit-fly traps, are highly
practical. But I ask you this question: how well do you think
we would cope without the obscure objects with which we
so frequently surround ourselves?
