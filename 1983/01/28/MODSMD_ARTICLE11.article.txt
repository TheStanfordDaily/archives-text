## 20th century civilization discovered 
### 
In a fine anthropological and archaeological journal such
as this, I need not remind the reader of the lack of firm
evidence and information available to the scholar of Dark
Ages culture. The Great Catastrophe, which spread mil
lions of tons of dust and ice crystals into the atmosphere,
thus limiting the amount of sunlight reaching the surface of
the earth for over a thousand years, destroyed almost all
artifacts of the time, leaving us little more than speculation
and conjecture with which to study this barbaric age.
Many other archaeologists have constructed theories to
explain the cause of the Great Catastrophe. Most notably,
Cumberland's theory posits that a massive meteorite, of at
least 200 kilotonr,, struck the earth, raising dust and ice into
the atmosphere.
A new theory holds that the primitives themselves gener
ated abominable weapons, and unleashed them on each
other in a form of mass suicide. In either case the same
result followed: the entire civilization on the northern con
tinent known as America in the so-called twentieth century
was destroyed, and along with it, an entire culture, which we
are just now beginning to re-discover.
Our team's recent unearthing of an entire group of dwell
ings has greatly increased our knowledge of the culture of
the society of the Dark Ages. In one of the most intriguing
finds, we discovered that a group of narrow cables and
conduits ran to each dwelling in the group of dwellings that
we found. To some houses, as many as four of these curious
conduits ran. These cables are much too narrow to have
possibly carried food or water. With no other discernible
practical application, we can only assume that the primitives
found some religious value in these cables. One theory hold
that small particles ran through them. Since these cables run
directly to every room in each dwelling, it seems obvious
that they either used these charged particles in their daily
worship of some unknown god, or that they actually wor
shipped these charged particles themselves.
In each dwelling, at least one conduit inevitably ran to a
peculiar box with a glass screen. Another cable connected
this box to the roof of the dwelling. As it is a well
documented fact that many primitve societies associate up
or the sky with diety, clearly these people used this box as a
form of worship. We can only guess as to the actual ritual.
But since we have found many devices which allow the
people to comfortably rest around the box, we felt quite
sure that Americans sat for hours in front of it worshipping
the tiny charged particles which, through some unknown
process, would light up the glass portion of it. In this man
ner. they appeased the tiny gods. Perhaps the primitive
Americans would periodically kneel, for example every
fifteen minutes or so, or at least every half hour on the half
hour, when some more important form of deity appeared on
the screen.
The smooth, concrete monuments that run across the
plains clearly celebrate the glory of the gods of the harvest,
while the towering, grand monuments that run through the
remains of the giant cities must have been erected in honor

of a city god, or a god of wisdom.
The ritual consisted of filling their vehicles with a highly
flammable and expensive hydrocarbon liquid and traveling
over and over the sculptures at increasing speeds, until an
uncontrollable frenzy of the gods possessed the driver,
sometimes leading him to sacrifice his life and vehicle in the
name of the god. It was obviously an honorable death, for
the primitives persisted in this ritual.
In some of the literature of the time, we find an occasional
reference to an unnamed god. The frequent capitalization
of the term suggests a monotheistic or at least monoidolatric
deity with some transcendent existence and power. Often
mentioned with this God is someone named Jesus who
apparently was the son of the God.
One member of our party has attempted to show that the
primitives of the twentieth century not only believed in but
worshipped this God. As evidence, he cites the stickers on
many of the vehicles that portray a fish while others read," I
found it." He also supports his statement by saying that
some people went to a building once weekly for an hour,
and that many more went to this building twice yearly.
This God supposedly taught love of neighbors, compas
sion, sharing, caring, peace and hope. If each member of the
society could practice these, a new era would appear, the
doctrine states. Clearly, the theory that these people wor
shipped this god crumbles on this point. Because of our
knowledge of the rampant disregard for the environment,
the incredible warlike nature of the people, their natural
propensity toward violence and greed, the extreme stratifi
cation of wealth, and the solitary and lonely nature of their
lives; a few fish, crosses and beads, and an hour a week in a
building (especially viewed in contrast with hours per day
spent in front of the peculiar box,) we can only conclude
that this god was an anachronism from an earlier age, and
that his message was no longer heard or understood, let
alone practiced, by the vast majority of Americans in the
late 20th century.
At this point, conjecture will have to serve for the facts
that we lack. But, from the facts we do have, we can con
struct some valuable theories that can lead to a more full
understanding of the culture. Ostensibly, these people were
polytheistic in the sense that they worshipped at least two
gods: the tiny charged particle and the metallic vehicles,
among many others.
But, on a closer view, these people were monotheistic in
that they believed in and worshipped only things. Things
cluttered every room of every dwelling we found: things for
comfort, things to look at, things to hold, everything imag
inable with uses we canonly guess at. In conclusion, we can
only say that, in dealing with the fundamental problems that
face humanity, that face every civilization and from which
the values of every society spring, the barbarians of late
twentieth century America developed a cult of material
things that centered around tiny particles and giant cars.
