## McCloskey's experience qualifies him

Opposition to the appointment of

McCloskey has been one of the most
controversial members of Congress during the
15 years he served as representative of the
district that included, until recently, our
University. He was the first Republican
congressman to oppose the Vietnam War, one of
the few politicians that challenged then
President Nixon during the height of his power
and also was the main thrust behind U.S.
participation in the Law of the Sea Conference.

Before attempting to determine the
motives behind the controversy sur
rounding this class and its instructor,
one needs to assess some of the rele
vant facts regarding this appointment.
McCloskey's personal and academic
qualifications for the job are, to say the
least, adequate. His involvement with
the University community over the last
three decades and his previous law
school teaching experience at Stanford
and Santa Clara will enable him, unlike
many previous guest professors, to in
tegrate himself into the academic cli
mate of the campus and to interact
comfortably with students and faculty
members. McCloskey has been one of
the most controversial members of
Congress during the 15 years he served
as representative of the district that in
cluded, until recently, our university.
He was the first Republican Con
gressman to oppose the Vietnam war,
one of the few politicians that chal
lenged then-President Richard Nixon
during the height of his power and also

was the main thrust behind U.S. parti
cipation in the Law of the Sea Confer
ence.
Given his background .and experi
ence, it would seem illogical to oppose
his appointment as a guest professor.
Unless, of course, McCloskey's request

of a $4000 honorarium were consid
ered unreasonable. But this is hardly
the case considering that this fee must
cover most of the overhead costs in
volved in-teaching the class and since
the ASSU would probably be unable to
find anyone with similar qualifications
who would teach for less money.

McCloske/s opinions will undoubtedly shape
his lecture and class discussion. However, / am
convinced students would challenge him or
anyone else attempting to use the class for
propagandist purposes. Therefore, any serious
student who is confident of the value of his/her
beliefs and the strength of his/her positions need
not fear potential indoctrination.

But then, why all the controversy?
To answer this question one must be
acquainted with some of the views of
the former congressman. In particular,
his views on Israel and the political
power of Jewish people in the United
States. Simply stated, he strongly op
poses current levels of U.S. aid to the
state of Israel and most policies of the
Begin government. Further, he be

lieves that U.S. foreign policy towards
Israel is. to a large extent, the result of
the influence of Jewish lobbying groups
on American central decision-makers.
Some members of our community
are offended by McCloskey's views.
Hence, they oppose the ASSU provid
ing him with, what they judge to be, an
ideal forum in which he can continue to
promote what some call his "biased
and slanderous" positions. This notion
is an insult to both the intelligence of
Stanford students and the integrity of
McCloskey himself. Without arguing
the soundness of these claims, I
nevertheless feel they do not constitute
sufficient ground to request McClos
key to amend the syllabus of the course
or to deny students the opportunity to
listen to him and learn about Congress.
McCloskey's opinions will undoubt
edly transpire from lectures and class
discussion. However, I am convinced
students would challenge him or any
one else attempting to use the class for
propagandist purposes. Therefore, any
serious student who is confident of the
value of his beliefs and the strength of
his positions need not fear potential
indoctrination.
What is most disturbing about this
controversy is that it could create a
dangerous precedent. What if Senator
Jesse Helms or Defense Secretary Cas-

par Weinberger were willing to teach in
the future at Stanford? Should those
individuals that feel strongly in favor of
abortion or opposed to defense spend
ing be allowed to prevent these men
from sharing their experience and
knowledge? 1 would hope not.
