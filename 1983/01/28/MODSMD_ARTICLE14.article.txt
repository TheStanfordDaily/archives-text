## P.O. Box Blues 
### 
I've calmed down now!
I was somewhat ticked off at the Post
Office for blacking the window of my
P.O. box. Now everyone will have to
open his box, not just those who have
mail. I understand the postmaster in
Washington has decided that we all
need protection (whether we want it or
not!) from those who might want our
mail.
Well, I fixed them. I scraped off the
paint (being careful of the numbers)!
If you feel the postmaster general
should be demoted to private, sign the
petition I've put near my box.
