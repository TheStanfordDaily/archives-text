# More bending walls: Serra House creaks
## 
### DOUGLAS JEHL 
Stern Hall's Serra House has
joinedlhe ranks of University resi
dences with walls that bend and
make noise in the night.
Deflected bedroom walls in Serra
were brought to the attention of
University officials Wednesday
after creaking sounds awakened
two first-floor residents at 6 a.m.
After noticing that their wall was
deflected — bent from vertical —
they inspected walls in other rooms
and discovered that they too were
deflected. Resident Assistant
George Bengston then informed the
University's resident management
office.
The inspector. Bob Mibach, resi
dence halls manager, said the prob
lem resembled the one discovered
last Oct. 29 in Wilbur's Trancos
House. In both cases, the deflected
walls were non-bearing divider
walls between first-floor bedrooms.
At Trancos, residents were
evacuated for more than an hour
while police, firemen and a host of
University officials made a midnight
inspection to ascertain whether
there was structural damage. In
some rooms there, nearly the entire
wall was noticeably bowed.
The problem in Serra is less seri

ous, Mibach said. "There was less
deflection (in Serra). . . it was more
isolated to just one part of the wnll."
Because of flooding and other
problems associated with the recent
storm, Mibach said, a complete in
vestigation of the Serra walls has not
been made. However, he said, "I
fully intend to go ahead to find out
what is going on with these deflec
tions."
Other walls in Stern and Wilbur
are known to be deflected, and at
least one other deflected wall — this
one a second-floor wall in Wilbur —
has been reported since the Trancos
incident, Mibach said.
"This (deflection) seems to be a
characteristic of (this type of) wall
itself," Mibach said. He said the de
flections would be a problem the
housing office would have to deal
with in the coming years, and that
repairs would likely be made — al
though on a declining basis in which
only the most seriously deflected
wall would be replaced.
Serra resident Michael Marks,
one of the two Room 13 residents
who discovered the warped walls,
said he and his roommate weren't
concerned about the state of their
walls. "It didn't take us by sur
prise. . . we had read about Tran
cos," he said.
