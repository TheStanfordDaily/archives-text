# Revelli watches from bench
## Sloppy Stanford cagers blasted by Washington 84-65 
### MARK ZEIGLER 
Edmundson Pavilion, the site
of last night's Stanford-
Washington Pac-10 Conference
basketball game, sounded like a
World War II air raid warning
system.
Stanford coach Tom Davis
and his team did not take heed,
let alone cover, and were shelled
by the Huskies 84-65, before
2118 quiet fans.
The Huskies raced to a 17-3
lead seven minutes into the
opening period and never let the
Cardinal get closer than eight
points the rest of the way.
"Washington put a good
whippin' on us," said Davis,
whose team at one point trailed
31-12. "I just thought that they
clearly outplayed us in all techni
cal areas."
Coach Marv Harshman and
his Huskies, deploying a zone de
fense the entire game, forced 27
turnovers and claimed 17 steals
while holding the Cardinal to a
meager 41.2 field goal percent
age.
On offense, Washington

players assisted each other on 20
of their 35 baskets. Stanford had
just four assists and 21 field
goals.
Six-foot-ten center David

Nussbaum, who suffered an
ankle injury last night, became
the third Cardinal player to be
injured in as many games. A
half-time X-ray showed that the
ankle is probably broken, Davis
said. Nussbaum will fly back to
the Bay Area this morning with
Athletic Director Andy Geiger

for further examination.
Nussbaum is the second Stan
ford center to be sidelined with
an injury. Leading scorer and re
bounder John Revelli went down
a week ago with a sprained
ankle. Revelli, 6-8, donning
street clothes, sat on the bench
last night and took statistics on a
clipboard.
Forward Andy Fischer, the
third injured Stanford player,
wore a mask last night to protect
his broken nose.
Keith Jones led the Cardinal
with 22 points, but made only
eight-of-22 field goal attempts
and turned the ball over a team
leading six times.
Jones' 22 points were over
shadowed by Husky Brad Wat
son's 25. Watson hit 12-of-16
from the field. All five Washing
ton starters scored at least eight
points, including Darrell Tan
ner's 17. The Huskies shot 54.7
percent from the field and out
rebounded the Cardinal 37-32.
"I thought we did a very good
zone defensive job," said Har
shman. "We were trying to deny

the inside post play they've been
so good at."
So effective was Harshman's
2-3 zone that it was not until the
9:21 mark in the first half that
Stanford broke into double fig
ures. Davis called two time-outs
in the first five minutes.
"We buried ourselves in the
early going by getting so far be
hind," Davis said. Stanford, in an
attempt to get back into the
game, was forced to take outside
shots, not the team's forte this
season, Davis said.
Davis called his third time-out
with 7:35 remaining in the first
half and Washington ahead
29-12. After a Paul Fortier tur
naround jumper made the score
31-12, the Cardinal went into a
tough man-to-man defense and
outscored the Huskies 11-2.
Stanford was behind by only 10
points at the half, 39-29.
Stanford started the second
half just as slowly as it did in the
first. A Johnny Rogers baseline
jumper put the Cardinal on the
board for the first time in the
second period, but not until

three and one-half minutes had
elapsed and five Washington
points had been scored.
A three-point play by "Hans
Wichary and a pair of Fischer
free throws cut the lead to just
eight with 12:14 left. Stanford
had two chances to narrow
Washingtion's advantage to six,
but turned the ball over on both
occasions.
The Cardinal trailed by eight
with 7:27 left, but the Huskies
scored seven unanswered points
to ice the game.
Davis said he "would be really
surprised if he (Revelli) plays,"

Saturday night against Washing
ton State. "So it looks like
(little-used) Kent Seymour will
be playing (second string) center
against Washington State."

for further examination.
Nussbaum is the second Stan
ford center to be sidelined with
an injury. Leading scorer and re
bounder John Revelli went down
a week ago with a sprained
ankle. Revelli, 6-8, donning
street clothes, sat on the bench
last night and took statistics on a
clipboard.
Forward Andy Fischer, the
third injured Stanford player,
wore a mask last night to protect
his broken nose.
Keith Jones led the Cardinal
with 22 points, but made only
eight-of-22 field goal attempts
and turned the ball over a team
leading six times.
Jones' 22 points were over
shadowed by Husky Brad Wat
son's 25. Watson hit 12-of-16
from the field. All five Washing
ton starters scored at least eight
points, including Darrell Tan
ner's 17. The Huskies shot 54.7
percent from the field and out
rebounded the Cardinal 37-32.
"I thought we did a very good
zone defensive job," said Har
shman. "We were trying to deny

the inside post play they've been
so good at."
So effective was Harshman's
2-3 zone that it was not until the
9:21 mark in the first half that
Stanford broke into double fig
ures. Davis called two time-outs
in the first five minutes.
"We buried ourselves in the
early going by getting so far be
hind," Davis said. Stanford, in an
attempt to get back into the
game, was forced to take outside
shots, not the team's forte this
season, Davis said.
Davis called his third time-out
with 7:35 remaining in the first
half and Washington ahead
29-12. After a Paul Fortier tur
naround jumper made the score
31-12, the Cardinal went into a
tough man-to-man defense and
outscored the Huskies 11-2.
Stanford was behind by only 10
points at the half, 39-29.
Stanford started the second
half just as slowly as it did in the
first. A Johnny Rogers baseline
jumper put the Cardinal on the
board for the first time in the
second period, but not until

three and one-half minutes had
elapsed and five Washington
points had been scored.
A three-point play by "Hans
Wichary and a pair of Fischer
free throws cut the lead to just
eight with 12:14 left. Stanford
had two chances to narrow
Washingtion's advantage to six,
but turned the ball over on both
occasions.
The Cardinal trailed by eight
with 7:27 left, but the Huskies
scored seven unanswered points
to ice the game.
Davis said he "would be really
surprised if he (Revelli) plays,"

Saturday night against Washing
ton State. "So it looks like
(little-used) Kent Seymour will
be playing (second string) center
against Washington State."

■ THROUGH: Stanford guard Keith Jones scored 22 points in the Cardinal s
84-65 Pacific-10 Conference loss to Washington last night. Jones and the Cardinal travel to
Pullman to face Washington State tomorrow night.
Edmundson Pavilion, the site
of last night's Stanford-
Washington Pac-10 Conference
basketball game, sounded like a
World War II air raid warning
system.
Stanford coach Tom Davis
and his team did not take heed,
let alone cover, and were shelled
by the Huskies 84-65, before
2118 quiet fans.
The Huskies raced to a 17-3
lead seven minutes into the
opening period and never let the
Cardinal get closer than eight
points the rest of the way.
"Washington put a good
whippin' on us," said Davis,
whose team at one point trailed
31-12. "I just thought that they
clearly outplayed us in all techni
cal areas."
Coach Marv Harshman and
his Huskies, deploying a zone de
fense the entire game, forced 27
turnovers and claimed 17 steals
while holding the Cardinal to a
meager 41.2 field goal percent
age.
On offense, Washington

players assisted each other on 20
of their 35 baskets. Stanford had
just four assists and 21 field
goals.
Six-foot-ten center David

Nussbaum, who suffered an
ankle injury last night, became
the third Cardinal player to be
injured in as many games. A
half-time X-ray showed that the
ankle is probably broken, Davis
said. Nussbaum will fly back to
the Bay Area this morning with
Athletic Director Andy Geiger

for further examination.
