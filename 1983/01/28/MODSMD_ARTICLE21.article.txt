# Unbeaten Cougs poised for Card
## 
### MARK ZEIGLER 
Before leaving on a two-day
road trip to the Northwest, assis
tant Stanford basketball coach
Cory Russell said a split for the
Cardinal against the two
Pacific-10 Conference Washing
ton schools would be a realistic
goal.
But if Russell, head coach
Tom Davis and their Cardinal
squad wish to achieve it, they will
have to do what in the past few
years has been the impossible —
defeat conference co-leader
Washington state on the
Cougars' home court.
If Stanford plays against WSU
(6-0 in the Pac-10, 14-2 overall)
like it did last night against
Washington, the Cardinal will be
the Cougar's final prey before
WSU's match-up with UCLA
next Thursday in Los Angeles.
Washington State defeated
California last night 66-64.
The Cardinal has had nothing
but problems against Washing
ton State in the last few years,
especially on the Cougars' home
court in Pullman, Wash. — the
site of tomorrow night's game.
Stanford has not defeated
WSU at Friel Court since the

-1974-75 season, when the
Howie Dallmar-coached Card
downed the Cougars 71-58.
Former Stanford head coach
Dick Dißiaso never beat WSU in
Pullman during his seven-year
tenure at Stanford.
Playing WSU on Friel Court is
no picnic. Besides the very vocal
and large crowds, the court's tar
tan surface will be difficult to ad
just to for the young Stanford
squad, a large portion of whom
will be playing in Pullman for the
first time.
Making things worse for Tom
Davis' Cardinal will be the
Cougars' pair of 11-game win
streaks — they have won their
last 11 games overall as well as
their last 11 at home.
Both teams will probably play
without their leading scorer and
rebounder. Center John Revelli
did not suit up last night in the
84-65 loss to the Huskies and,
according to Cardinal coaches,
he is doubtful for tomorrow's
game.
The Cougars' top scorer and
rebounder, six-foot-nine senior
forward Guy Williams, under
went surgery Monday for cartil
age and ligament damage in his

left knee and is gone for the sea
son. Williams, who transferred
from USF three years ago,
seemed destined to claim first
team All Pac-10 honors this year
and go high in the NBA draft.
Before his injury, Williams
was averaging 18.9 rebounds per
game, including a school record
43 points against Idaho State, a
game in which he also had 14
rebounds. He also was the team's
third best free throw shooter,
while averaging over 32 minutes
of playing time each game.
Besides Williams. WSU is led
by three other seniors — Craig
Ehlo, Steve Harriel and Aaron
Haskins. The 6-6 Harriel has
come alive in Pac-10 play, av
eraging 20 points and 6.4 re
bounds in the first five confer
ence contests.
Both Ehlo and Craig Winker,
the other backcourt starter, are
scoring at a 10-point clip, while
Haskins, Steve Wurm, and
freshman Ricky Brown contri
bute as well. Ehlo is dealing out
4.6 assists and recording 1.8 ste
als a game.
WSU coach George Raveling,
like Washington's Marv Har
shman, is a firm believer in man

to-man defense. The Cardinal
may see a touch of zone uefense
from the Cougars, however,
since that seems to be the most
effective weapon against Stan
ford's inside passing attack.
As a team, WSU ranks high in
a number of Pac-10 statistical
categories. The Cougars lead the
league in margin of victory, out-'
scoring their opponents by an
average of 11.1 points. Raveling
and his troops also have stymied
the opposition while on defense,
allowing opponents to shoot just
45.7 percent from the field while
holding them to under 65 points.
The Cardinal leads the Pac-10 in
field goal percentage at 56.6 per
cent and is third in scoring at
74.6.
WSU is second to Cal in turn
over margin, forcing an average
of 4.3 more turnovers a game
than they give up. Heading into
last night's game, the Cougars
ranked fourth in the conference
in scoring behind UCLA,
Arizona State and Stanford.
The Cougars embarrassed
Oregon State last weekend on
the Beavers' home court 78-64,
but had trouble two days later
with Oregon, winning 54-51.

WSU coach George Raveling,
like Washington's Marv Har
shman, is a firm believer in man

to-man defense. The Cardinal
may see a touch of zone uefense
from the Cougars, however,
since that seems to be the most
effective weapon against Stan
ford's inside passing attack.
As a team, WSU ranks high in
a number of Pac-10 statistical
categories. The Cougars lead the
league in margin of victory, out-'
scoring their opponents by an
average of 11.1 points. Raveling
and his troops also have stymied
the opposition while on defense,
allowing opponents to shoot just
45.7 percent from the field while
holding them to under 65 points.
The Cardinal leads the Pac-10 in
field goal percentage at 56.6 per
cent and is third in scoring at
74.6.
WSU is second to Cal in turn
over margin, forcing an average
of 4.3 more turnovers a game
than they give up. Heading into
last night's game, the Cougars
ranked fourth in the conference
in scoring behind UCLA,
Arizona State and Stanford.
The Cougars embarrassed
Oregon State last weekend on
the Beavers' home court 78-64,
but had trouble two days later
with Oregon, winning 54-51.
Before leaving on a two-day
road trip to the Northwest, assis
tant Stanford basketball coach
Cory Russell said a split for the
Cardinal against the two
Pacific-10 Conference Washing
ton schools would be a realistic
goal.
But if Russell, head coach
Tom Davis and their Cardinal
squad wish to achieve it, they will
have to do what in the past few
years has been the impossible —
defeat conference co-leader
Washington state on the
Cougars' home court.
If Stanford plays against WSU
(6-0 in the Pac-10, 14-2 overall)
like it did last night against
Washington, the Cardinal will be
the Cougar's final prey before
WSU's match-up with UCLA
next Thursday in Los Angeles.
Washington State defeated
California last night 66-64.
The Cardinal has had nothing
but problems against Washing
ton State in the last few years,
especially on the Cougars' home
court in Pullman, Wash. — the
site of tomorrow night's game.
Stanford has not defeated
WSU at Friel Court since the

-1974-75 season, when the
Howie Dallmar-coached Card
downed the Cougars 71-58.
Former Stanford head coach
Dick Dißiaso never beat WSU in
Pullman during his seven-year
tenure at Stanford.
Playing WSU on Friel Court is
no picnic. Besides the very vocal
and large crowds, the court's tar
tan surface will be difficult to ad
just to for the young Stanford
squad, a large portion of whom
will be playing in Pullman for the
first time.
Making things worse for Tom
Davis' Cardinal will be the
Cougars' pair of 11-game win
streaks — they have won their
last 11 games overall as well as
their last 11 at home.
Both teams will probably play
without their leading scorer and
rebounder. Center John Revelli
did not suit up last night in the
84-65 loss to the Huskies and,
according to Cardinal coaches,
he is doubtful for tomorrow's
game.
The Cougars' top scorer and
rebounder, six-foot-nine senior
forward Guy Williams, under
went surgery Monday for cartil
age and ligament damage in his

left knee and is gone for the sea
son. Williams, who transferred
from USF three years ago,
seemed destined to claim first
team All Pac-10 honors this year
and go high in the NBA draft.
Before his injury, Williams
was averaging 18.9 rebounds per
game, including a school record
43 points against Idaho State, a
game in which he also had 14
rebounds. He also was the team's
third best free throw shooter,
while averaging over 32 minutes
of playing time each game.
Besides Williams. WSU is led
by three other seniors — Craig
Ehlo, Steve Harriel and Aaron
Haskins. The 6-6 Harriel has
come alive in Pac-10 play, av
eraging 20 points and 6.4 re
bounds in the first five confer
ence contests.
Both Ehlo and Craig Winker,
the other backcourt starter, are
scoring at a 10-point clip, while
Haskins, Steve Wurm, and
freshman Ricky Brown contri
bute as well. Ehlo is dealing out
4.6 assists and recording 1.8 ste
als a game.
