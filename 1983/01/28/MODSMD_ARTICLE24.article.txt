# Men's tennis team in intrasquad action
## 
### TOM MOORE 
The Stanford men's tennis
team finished out of the top 12 in
the nation for the first time in 12
years last season, but coach Dick
Gould is cautiously optimistic
about 1983.
Stanford, who will play in an
intrasquad mutch at the tennis
stadium here Sunday. finished
at 15-10 last year and ranked
No. 15 in the nation, but seven of
the 10 Kisses were by 5-4 scores.
Encouraged by these factors
and a bumper crop of recruits,
Gould feels the Cardinal is
"realistically a top eight team."
Stanford is young — nine of
the tope 13 players are freshmen
— but Gould calls his team a
"super group."
"We may be a little short on
collegiate match experience,"
Gould said " But we have the po
tential to be stronger at every po
sition on the team this year."
Scott Davis Will once again
achor the Cardinal squad at No.
1 singles. Davis, a two-time
All-America, is ranked as the
No. 2 player in the nation behind
Southern Methodist's Rodney
Harmon. Gould calls Davis "an
outstanding competitor who has
a fine season ahead of him."
Junior Mark McKeen, who
will captain the 1983 team, has
improved tremendously after a
solid season last year.

and Jeremy Semple are also ex
pected to see considerable action
this year and add depth to the
Card roster.
Freshmen include:
• Eric Rosenfeld and Dan
Goldie, both of whom were
ranked in the top four of their
