# Women host USC, UCLA
## 
### SHAILENDRA BHUMRALKAR 
The Stanford's women's
swimming team heads into a
tough weekend of competi
tion, but poor weather could
work to its advantage. The
Cardinal faces UCLA on Fri
day at 1:30 p.m. and USC on
Saturday at 1 p.m. at de-
Guerre Pool.
Head Coach George
Haines said, "UCLA has a
fairly good team, though
they've lacked a good pro
gram in the last two years."
Heading the list for the
Bruins will be Julie Williams,
racing in the freestyle events.
The Cardinals will counter
with Krissie Bush and Diana
Zock. Kathy Clarke is the top
breaststroker for UCLA,
while Kathy Smith and Patty
Spees will represent the Card
in those events. Other swim
mers for UCLA include

Diane Graner, Linda Placak,
Patrice Delaney and Tawny
Hood. Stanford will send
Jenny Rapp, Lisa Buese and
Patty Gavin to the line.
As for diving, Coach Rick
Schavone said, "We should
handle them." The Bruins
have veteran Julie Dehaven,
but Schavone is confident
that Stanford's Jean Meyer
and Kim Jones are stronger.
"If they're on, it could be
very interesting," Haines said
of USC. "They've got a lot of
good talent."
The trojans have an im
pressive lineup for the frees
tyle events. Sue Habernigg,
Karen Gould, Karen
Laberge, Jennifer Johnston
and Laura Campuzano will
provide stiff competition. The
Cardinal will send out an
equally impressive squad for
the freestyles, including
Marybeth Linzmeier, Sherri

Hanna, Isabel Reuss and
Zock.
Kelly Cox of USC and Kim
Carlisle of Stanford should
battle it out in the backstroke
races. The Trojans are also
strong in the breatstroke,
with Jacqueline Komrij and
Annette Fredrickson. Stan
ford will be ready with Smith
and Spees. The medley relay
teams from both schools will
be swimming neck-and-neck.
Schavone said about the
diving, "If we don't dive re
ally well, we'll get beat."
USC's top diver is Patty
Lewis. Stanford will have
Jean Meyer on its side.
Haines said, "We're going
to have to be at our best
against USC." If the weather
continues to be this bad, it
could help Stanford. Though
cold weather hurts both
teams, it could be worse for
the teams from the south,
since they both train indoors.
