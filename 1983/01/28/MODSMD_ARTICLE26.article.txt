### 
The Stanford women's rugby
team maintained its undefeated
season record by defeating the
San Francisco Women's Rugby
Club Saturday 4-0. The Cardinal
is now 9-0.
Wet and windy weather condi
tions led to a slow-moving
muddy game; there were many
set scrums and the ball was often
tied up in rucks and mauls.
Stanford's only score came
midway into the first half. Fly
half Belinda Kremer passed off
to Manley Williams then looped

outside to take the pass on the
overlap and drive in for the
score.
Forwards Kate Wade, Jen
niter Chue, Paula McNerney,
Estela Fernandez. Michelle
Shockey, Tricia Lambie, Erika
Sheimer and Ann Latham

consistently pushed the larger
and more experienced San Fran
cisco forwards off the ball. Stan
ford plays a strong UC-Qerkelev
