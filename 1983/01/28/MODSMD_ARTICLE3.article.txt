Storm continues to wreak havoc
Giant breakers pounded the coastline from Eureka to Monterey yester
day, smashing beachfront homes and isolating others in swirling, tidal moats
as the fourth storm in five days churned toward Northern California.
Six homes on Stinson Beach splintered and washed away in the surf, and
seawater surging over a mile-long spit of land threatened up to 30 others.
Nearly 100 beachfront homes were under seige in the Santa Cruz County
town of Aptos, as debris-laden waves punched out picture windows and
swamped living rooms.
The fourth storm in less than a week was set to hit today "like the crack of
a whip," and may be followed by two more, said meteorologist Dick Vander.
Inland flooding from storm No. 3 that hit Wednesday routed more than
100 people from Tehama Citv and a helicopter plucked a dozen stranded
workmen off a broken levee northeast of Woodland.
Record tides in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta reached 10.34
feet at 1: 15 p.m., the highest level in 58 years, and water topped levees around
the delta's farming islands in several locations. But no breaches were re
ported. A tractor driver plugged a break in the Golden Island levee by driv
ing his vehicle into the breach.
Hundreds of people sought refuge in Red Cross evacuation centers lo
cated in Sonoma, Humboldt. San Mateo, Marin and Santa Cruz counties.
Two houses slid down a Fitch Mountain hillside near Healdsburg without
causing anv injury, and a Novato hillside turned to mud and surprised a
sleeping household when it crashed indoors.
Just as the rain began to dissipate early yesterday, near-record tides rang
ing up to 10 feet rolled in with breakers 20 feet high in Humboldt Bay and
Santa Cruz, swelling rivers and creeks as it surged inland.
In Aptos, fierce waves broke on 75 to 100 beachfront homes, smashing
picture windows and eroding their foundations. "The water is going right
through them, said assistant fire chief Al Forbes. "They have swimming
pools in their living room.
Marin Countv was beset bv tides along both the Pacific coast and the bay
shores. Stinson and Muir beaches were closed after surf and debris clogged
roads.
Sections of twisting Highway I along the coast and nu
merous access ramps to inland Highway 101 also were
closed, and streets in low-lying areas of Tiburon. San
Rafael and Belsedere were impassable because of high
water.
\bout 50 floating docks at the San Francisco marina
were torn loose by the morning tide, and a fishing vessel
keeled over and sank in heavs surf near Alcatraz Wednes
day.
About 1600 San Francisco Peninsula residents were
ssuhout telephone service, and 10.0(H) people from Marin
County to the Santa Cruz Mountains had no electricity.
In Southern California, the coastline got its worst bat
tering in years yesterday from a vicious storm that swept
homes and historic piers into the churning sea, caused
widespread flooding and forced hundreds of residents to
flee for higher ground.
\l least three people died in sseather-related accidents
and three homes were destroyed by pounding surf de
scribed bs longtime residents as the worst in decades.
"I knew it was all over when 1 saw the hot tub sail by
into the ocean," said Becky llagan, who fled her
beachfront Malibu home just before it collapsed into the
rolling Pacific Ocean.
Because of the damage. Gov. George Deukmejian de
clared Los Angeles and San Diego counties disaster
areas. The governor s declaration entitles the counties to
money to repair damage to real public property, Deu
kmejian's press secretary. Larry Thomas, said in Los An
geles late yesterday.
\ formal request for disaster assistance for Orange
Counts, which earlier on Thursday had declared a local
stale of emergency, had not yet been received by the gov
ernor, Thomas said.
Another "vigorous" storm will hit the region tonight
or tomorrow morning, said Bob Grebe of the National
Weather Service.
Motorists and hillside residents were warned of mud
and rockslides. Heavy surf advisories were to be in effect
at least through todav
Volcker predicts recovery
Washington — Federal Reserve Chairman Paul
Volcker, backing President Reagan's plan for a standby
tax increase, said yesterday the economy is poised for an
enduring recovery although concern over huge projected
budget deficits "clouds the future."
Volcker said interest rates would come down further,
strengthening an upturn, if Congress promptly adopted
measures to reduce red-ink spending that is expected to
increase even in a period of expansion.
Referring to evidence of renewed economic growth, he
told the Joint Economic Committee of Congress: "We
can see some crocuses blooming."
He praised Reagan's proposal for a three-year tax in
crease of up to SI 50 billion that would be triggered if defi
cits did not drop below SlOO billion bv October 1985.
"But as things now stand, fear of growing deficits
clouds the future and contributes to market pressures and
inflationary uncertainties, adding to the burdens of mon
etary policy," Volcker said.

"Left unattended, the situation ssould pose a strong
potential for a clash between the need to finance the defi
cit and the rising financial requirements for housing and
the business investment that is crucial to a healthy re
covery," he added.
But Volcker opposed "indexing" of income tax rates
— making adjustments to prevent inflation from auto
matically pushing taxpayers into higher brackets — that
Reagan wants to preserve in the lass although it vsill not
take effect until 1985. "I congenitallv do not like index
ing," he explained.
Volcker. whose term as chairman of the nation's cen
tral bank expires next August, refused to sa\ whether he
wants to be reappointed bs Reagan for another four
years, telling a questioner: "At this point I only discuss
that with my wife."
O'Neill supports jobs bill
Washington — House Speaker Thomas "Tip" O'Neill
(D-Mass.) told the nation's mayors yesterday that Presi
dent Reagan will h;ive to boss to grossing pressure for an
emergency jobs bill, and two conservative Senate Re
publicans split with the administration by announcing a
jobs program of their ossn.
A top White House official, however, said Reagan re
mains staunchly opposed to public svorks or public ser
vice jobs as temporary and unproductive.
"We certainly can afford to have a $5 billion to $7
billion jobs program this year." O'Neill told a meeting of
the U.S. Conference of Mayors. "1 truly believe that by
March the White House will be sending in a (jobs) pro
gram." O'Neill added later that he was "confident the
president w ill break down" on the jobs proposal.
In a separate move. Sens. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, chair
man of the Labor and Human Resources Committee,
and Dan Quavle, R-lnd., who heads its employment sub
committee, proposed to spend S2 billion to create about
250.000 public service jobs this vear.
Lhev said the money would be channeled through ex
isting programs to create "needed" and "worthwhile"
jobs in fields ranging from dav-care centers to nursing
care at veterans hospitals.
Asked about the prospect for public works jobs. Rich
ard Williamson, Reagan's assistant for intergovernmen
tal affairs, said: "The president's position has not
changed in his opposition to that type of program. Jobs
bills of this sort ... have usually proven unproductive and
have not created jobs. The answer to unemployment lies
in long-term, private sector jobs."
Egyptian oil production to rise
Cairo, Egypt — The United Arab Emirates announced
Wednesav night that it is dramatically increasing its oil
production and warned that prices may be cut soon in an
oil war following the collapse of the OPEC meeting
earlier this week.
In making public the decision to boost output by 45
percent to 1.6 million barrelsa day, the emirates' Oil Min
ister Mana Saeed Oteiba said that he could "almost see
now in front of my eves" a price cut by Arab producers in
the Persian Gulf.
The action bv the emirates, an ally of leading world oil

producer Saucii Arabia, suggested thai the Saudi-led bloc
of Persian < iult" states was prepared to raise production
and reduce prices in an effort to pressure its rivals in
< >PI ( to stop truni> to encroach on its share of the mar
ket.
I he emirates previously had been curtailing their pro
duction to help the Saudis prop up OPEC's official price
ol SU a barrel, but the two now ma\ be changing policy
to tr\ to lorce their rivals to stop offering price discounts
and accept production ceilings.
Mubarak wants Israel out of Lebanon
Washington — Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak,
declaring there is a "golden opportunity" for peace in the
Middle l ast, urged President Reagan yesterday to force
Israel to withdraw its troops from Lebanon.
"I pon achieving that, other aspects of the problem
would be easier to solve," Mubarak said after a two-hour
meeting with Reagan at the White House.
There was no indication that Mubarak asked Reagan
to suspend U.S. military or economic aid to Israel, al
though such a move bv the United States is known to be
under consideration.
Mubarak appealed publicly to the president to "move
further in supporting the rights of the Palestinian people
to self-determination."
He implied in his statement that an Israeli withdrawal
from Lebanon might not be enough to persuade Kine
Hussein of Jordan and Palestinian leaders to join peace
talks.
He asked Reagan to go beyond his proposal for
Palestinian self-rule, "in association" with Jordan, on the
West Bank of the Jordan River and in Gaza. And
Mubarak called for a free/.e on Jewish settlements and
other "settlement activity."
Bush to meet with NATO leaders
Washington — Vice President George Bush will not be
carrying a new U.S. arms-control proposal when he
meets with leaders of NATO nations next week, and he is
not prepared to negotiate any changes in the U.S. posi
tion. he said yesterday.
Bush, who will leave Sunday on 11-day, seven-nation
European trip, said at a press conference that the agenda
of his meetings with the officials would include dis
cussions of the U.S. negotiating stance on the deploy
ment of missiles in Western Europe.
He maintained that the U.S. offer — to cancel deploy
ment plans for 572 Pershing 2 and cruise missiles if the
Soviets would eliminate their 600 or more ballistic mis
siles already installed in European Russia — would be the
best outcome of the ongoing arms-control negotiations in
Geneva, Switzerland.
Moscow has rejected that proposal, calling instead for
a common ceiling of 162 missiles for itself and for
Western European countries. The combined Erench and
British nuclear-missile arsenal totals 162, so the effect of
the Soviet offer would be to prohibit deployment of U.S.
missiles in Europe.
In this impasse, an increasing number of Europeans
and Americans have called for what they see as greater
realism in the U.S. position. These critics maintain that

Moscow will not trade itsemplaced missiles for U.S. mis
siles that now exist onlv on paper.
Bush said that the United States is prepared to be
somew hat flexible in the negotiations-. Ifthe Soviet Union
coir.u.t forward with "a meaningful proposal that offers
balance and equality." the United States is prepared to
seriously examine it, he said.
I he vice president will visit all the nations of the North
\tlantic I reatv Organization in which the new U.S. mis
siles are scheduled to be placed, starting late this year:
W est Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, Italy and
(ireat Britain. He will deliver major speeches in Berlin
and London and will address the U.N. Disarmament
C ommission in Geneva. He will meet with both Soviet
and I .S. representatives to the Kuromissile and strategic
arms talks in Geneva.
Bush also will visit France and Switzerland.
U.S. physics preeminence questioned
Washington — American physics has declined from a
position ol preeminence in the world a decade ago to a
point where leadership in kev areas has clearly nassed to
other countries, according to some leading physicists.
I he discovery announced this week of the elusive "W
particle, the carrier of one of the four fundamental
forces in the universe, was just one sign that America no
longer leads the world, said Wolfgang Panofsky, director
ol the Stanford Linear Accelerator. The W particle ex
periment was once planned for an American facility, but
was turned down for lack of funds.
I he best indication that the United States has slipped
behind European physics for the first time since the
World War 11 is not so much the discovery of the particle
a the performance of Americans at the last International
Conference on High Energy Phvsics in Paris. Panofsky
said.
"You have to say that, at that meeting, the U.S. con
tributions were severely lacking. I can say unequivocally
that for the first time, at that meeting, it wasclear that the
warnings we had sounded finally fit the facts," Panofsky
said.

cits did not drop below SlOO billion bv October 1985.
"But as things now stand, fear of growing deficits
clouds the future and contributes to market pressures and
inflationary uncertainties, adding to the burdens of mon
etary policy," Volcker said.

"Left unattended, the situation ssould pose a strong
potential for a clash between the need to finance the defi
cit and the rising financial requirements for housing and
the business investment that is crucial to a healthy re
covery," he added.
But Volcker opposed "indexing" of income tax rates
— making adjustments to prevent inflation from auto
matically pushing taxpayers into higher brackets — that
Reagan wants to preserve in the lass although it vsill not
take effect until 1985. "I congenitallv do not like index
ing," he explained.
Volcker. whose term as chairman of the nation's cen
tral bank expires next August, refused to sa\ whether he
wants to be reappointed bs Reagan for another four
years, telling a questioner: "At this point I only discuss
that with my wife."
O'Neill supports jobs bill
Washington — House Speaker Thomas "Tip" O'Neill
(D-Mass.) told the nation's mayors yesterday that Presi
dent Reagan will h;ive to boss to grossing pressure for an
emergency jobs bill, and two conservative Senate Re
publicans split with the administration by announcing a
jobs program of their ossn.
A top White House official, however, said Reagan re
mains staunchly opposed to public svorks or public ser
vice jobs as temporary and unproductive.
"We certainly can afford to have a $5 billion to $7
billion jobs program this year." O'Neill told a meeting of
the U.S. Conference of Mayors. "1 truly believe that by
March the White House will be sending in a (jobs) pro
gram." O'Neill added later that he was "confident the
president w ill break down" on the jobs proposal.
In a separate move. Sens. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, chair
man of the Labor and Human Resources Committee,
and Dan Quavle, R-lnd., who heads its employment sub
committee, proposed to spend S2 billion to create about
250.000 public service jobs this vear.
Lhev said the money would be channeled through ex
isting programs to create "needed" and "worthwhile"
jobs in fields ranging from dav-care centers to nursing
care at veterans hospitals.
Asked about the prospect for public works jobs. Rich
ard Williamson, Reagan's assistant for intergovernmen
tal affairs, said: "The president's position has not
changed in his opposition to that type of program. Jobs
bills of this sort ... have usually proven unproductive and
have not created jobs. The answer to unemployment lies
in long-term, private sector jobs."
Egyptian oil production to rise
Cairo, Egypt — The United Arab Emirates announced
Wednesav night that it is dramatically increasing its oil
production and warned that prices may be cut soon in an
oil war following the collapse of the OPEC meeting
earlier this week.
In making public the decision to boost output by 45
percent to 1.6 million barrelsa day, the emirates' Oil Min
ister Mana Saeed Oteiba said that he could "almost see
now in front of my eves" a price cut by Arab producers in
the Persian Gulf.
The action bv the emirates, an ally of leading world oil

producer Saucii Arabia, suggested thai the Saudi-led bloc
of Persian < iult" states was prepared to raise production
and reduce prices in an effort to pressure its rivals in
< >PI ( to stop truni> to encroach on its share of the mar
ket.
I he emirates previously had been curtailing their pro
duction to help the Saudis prop up OPEC's official price
ol SU a barrel, but the two now ma\ be changing policy
to tr\ to lorce their rivals to stop offering price discounts
and accept production ceilings.
Mubarak wants Israel out of Lebanon
Washington — Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak,
declaring there is a "golden opportunity" for peace in the
Middle l ast, urged President Reagan yesterday to force
Israel to withdraw its troops from Lebanon.
"I pon achieving that, other aspects of the problem
would be easier to solve," Mubarak said after a two-hour
meeting with Reagan at the White House.
There was no indication that Mubarak asked Reagan
to suspend U.S. military or economic aid to Israel, al
though such a move bv the United States is known to be
under consideration.
Mubarak appealed publicly to the president to "move
further in supporting the rights of the Palestinian people
to self-determination."
He implied in his statement that an Israeli withdrawal
from Lebanon might not be enough to persuade Kine
Hussein of Jordan and Palestinian leaders to join peace
talks.
He asked Reagan to go beyond his proposal for
Palestinian self-rule, "in association" with Jordan, on the
West Bank of the Jordan River and in Gaza. And
Mubarak called for a free/.e on Jewish settlements and
other "settlement activity."
Bush to meet with NATO leaders
Washington — Vice President George Bush will not be
carrying a new U.S. arms-control proposal when he
meets with leaders of NATO nations next week, and he is
not prepared to negotiate any changes in the U.S. posi
tion. he said yesterday.
Bush, who will leave Sunday on 11-day, seven-nation
European trip, said at a press conference that the agenda
of his meetings with the officials would include dis
cussions of the U.S. negotiating stance on the deploy
ment of missiles in Western Europe.
He maintained that the U.S. offer — to cancel deploy
ment plans for 572 Pershing 2 and cruise missiles if the
Soviets would eliminate their 600 or more ballistic mis
siles already installed in European Russia — would be the
best outcome of the ongoing arms-control negotiations in
Geneva, Switzerland.
Moscow has rejected that proposal, calling instead for
a common ceiling of 162 missiles for itself and for
Western European countries. The combined Erench and
British nuclear-missile arsenal totals 162, so the effect of
the Soviet offer would be to prohibit deployment of U.S.
missiles in Europe.
In this impasse, an increasing number of Europeans
and Americans have called for what they see as greater
realism in the U.S. position. These critics maintain that

Moscow will not trade itsemplaced missiles for U.S. mis
siles that now exist onlv on paper.
Bush said that the United States is prepared to be
somew hat flexible in the negotiations-. Ifthe Soviet Union
coir.u.t forward with "a meaningful proposal that offers
balance and equality." the United States is prepared to
seriously examine it, he said.
I he vice president will visit all the nations of the North
\tlantic I reatv Organization in which the new U.S. mis
siles are scheduled to be placed, starting late this year:
W est Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, Italy and
(ireat Britain. He will deliver major speeches in Berlin
and London and will address the U.N. Disarmament
C ommission in Geneva. He will meet with both Soviet
and I .S. representatives to the Kuromissile and strategic
arms talks in Geneva.
Bush also will visit France and Switzerland.
U.S. physics preeminence questioned
Washington — American physics has declined from a
position ol preeminence in the world a decade ago to a
point where leadership in kev areas has clearly nassed to
other countries, according to some leading physicists.
I he discovery announced this week of the elusive "W
particle, the carrier of one of the four fundamental
forces in the universe, was just one sign that America no
longer leads the world, said Wolfgang Panofsky, director
ol the Stanford Linear Accelerator. The W particle ex
periment was once planned for an American facility, but
was turned down for lack of funds.
I he best indication that the United States has slipped
behind European physics for the first time since the
World War 11 is not so much the discovery of the particle
a the performance of Americans at the last International
Conference on High Energy Phvsics in Paris. Panofsky
said.
"You have to say that, at that meeting, the U.S. con
tributions were severely lacking. I can say unequivocally
that for the first time, at that meeting, it wasclear that the
warnings we had sounded finally fit the facts," Panofsky
said.

Storm continues to wreak havoc
Giant breakers pounded the coastline from Eureka to Monterey yester
day, smashing beachfront homes and isolating others in swirling, tidal moats
as the fourth storm in five days churned toward Northern California.
Six homes on Stinson Beach splintered and washed away in the surf, and
seawater surging over a mile-long spit of land threatened up to 30 others.
Nearly 100 beachfront homes were under seige in the Santa Cruz County
town of Aptos, as debris-laden waves punched out picture windows and
swamped living rooms.
The fourth storm in less than a week was set to hit today "like the crack of
a whip," and may be followed by two more, said meteorologist Dick Vander.
Inland flooding from storm No. 3 that hit Wednesday routed more than
100 people from Tehama Citv and a helicopter plucked a dozen stranded
workmen off a broken levee northeast of Woodland.
Record tides in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta reached 10.34
feet at 1: 15 p.m., the highest level in 58 years, and water topped levees around
the delta's farming islands in several locations. But no breaches were re
ported. A tractor driver plugged a break in the Golden Island levee by driv
ing his vehicle into the breach.
Hundreds of people sought refuge in Red Cross evacuation centers lo
cated in Sonoma, Humboldt. San Mateo, Marin and Santa Cruz counties.
Two houses slid down a Fitch Mountain hillside near Healdsburg without
causing anv injury, and a Novato hillside turned to mud and surprised a
sleeping household when it crashed indoors.
Just as the rain began to dissipate early yesterday, near-record tides rang
ing up to 10 feet rolled in with breakers 20 feet high in Humboldt Bay and
Santa Cruz, swelling rivers and creeks as it surged inland.
In Aptos, fierce waves broke on 75 to 100 beachfront homes, smashing
picture windows and eroding their foundations. "The water is going right
through them, said assistant fire chief Al Forbes. "They have swimming
pools in their living room.
Marin Countv was beset bv tides along both the Pacific coast and the bay
shores. Stinson and Muir beaches were closed after surf and debris clogged
roads.
Sections of twisting Highway I along the coast and nu
merous access ramps to inland Highway 101 also were
closed, and streets in low-lying areas of Tiburon. San
Rafael and Belsedere were impassable because of high
water.
\bout 50 floating docks at the San Francisco marina
were torn loose by the morning tide, and a fishing vessel
keeled over and sank in heavs surf near Alcatraz Wednes
day.
About 1600 San Francisco Peninsula residents were
ssuhout telephone service, and 10.0(H) people from Marin
County to the Santa Cruz Mountains had no electricity.
In Southern California, the coastline got its worst bat
tering in years yesterday from a vicious storm that swept
homes and historic piers into the churning sea, caused
widespread flooding and forced hundreds of residents to
flee for higher ground.
\l least three people died in sseather-related accidents
and three homes were destroyed by pounding surf de
scribed bs longtime residents as the worst in decades.
"I knew it was all over when 1 saw the hot tub sail by
into the ocean," said Becky llagan, who fled her
beachfront Malibu home just before it collapsed into the
rolling Pacific Ocean.
Because of the damage. Gov. George Deukmejian de
clared Los Angeles and San Diego counties disaster
areas. The governor s declaration entitles the counties to
money to repair damage to real public property, Deu
kmejian's press secretary. Larry Thomas, said in Los An
geles late yesterday.
\ formal request for disaster assistance for Orange
Counts, which earlier on Thursday had declared a local
stale of emergency, had not yet been received by the gov
ernor, Thomas said.
Another "vigorous" storm will hit the region tonight
or tomorrow morning, said Bob Grebe of the National
Weather Service.
Motorists and hillside residents were warned of mud
and rockslides. Heavy surf advisories were to be in effect
at least through todav
Volcker predicts recovery
Washington — Federal Reserve Chairman Paul
Volcker, backing President Reagan's plan for a standby
tax increase, said yesterday the economy is poised for an
enduring recovery although concern over huge projected
budget deficits "clouds the future."
Volcker said interest rates would come down further,
strengthening an upturn, if Congress promptly adopted
measures to reduce red-ink spending that is expected to
increase even in a period of expansion.
Referring to evidence of renewed economic growth, he
told the Joint Economic Committee of Congress: "We

Bush to meet with NATO leaders
Washington — Vice President George Bush will not be
carrying a new U.S. arms-control proposal when he
meets with leaders of NATO nations next week, and he is
not prepared to negotiate any changes in the U.S. posi
tion. he said yesterday.
Bush, who will leave Sunday on 11-day, seven-nation
European trip, said at a press conference that the agenda
of his meetings with the officials would include dis
cussions of the U.S. negotiating stance on the deploy
ment of missiles in Western Europe.
He maintained that the U.S. offer — to cancel deploy
ment plans for 572 Pershing 2 and cruise missiles if the
Soviets would eliminate their 600 or more ballistic mis
siles already installed in European Russia — would be the
best outcome of the ongoing arms-control negotiations in
Geneva, Switzerland.
Moscow has rejected that proposal, calling instead for
a common ceiling of 162 missiles for itself and for
Western European countries. The combined Erench and
British nuclear-missile arsenal totals 162, so the effect of
the Soviet offer would be to prohibit deployment of U.S.
missiles in Europe.
In this impasse, an increasing number of Europeans
and Americans have called for what they see as greater
realism in the U.S. position. These critics maintain that

Moscow will not trade itsemplaced missiles for U.S. mis
siles that now exist onlv on paper.
Bush said that the United States is prepared to be
somew hat flexible in the negotiations-. Ifthe Soviet Union
coir.u.t forward with "a meaningful proposal that offers
balance and equality." the United States is prepared to
seriously examine it, he said.
I he vice president will visit all the nations of the North
\tlantic I reatv Organization in which the new U.S. mis
siles are scheduled to be placed, starting late this year:
W est Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, Italy and
(ireat Britain. He will deliver major speeches in Berlin
and London and will address the U.N. Disarmament
C ommission in Geneva. He will meet with both Soviet
and I .S. representatives to the Kuromissile and strategic
arms talks in Geneva.
Bush also will visit France and Switzerland.
U.S. physics preeminence questioned
Washington — American physics has declined from a
position ol preeminence in the world a decade ago to a
point where leadership in kev areas has clearly nassed to
other countries, according to some leading physicists.
I he discovery announced this week of the elusive "W
particle, the carrier of one of the four fundamental
forces in the universe, was just one sign that America no
longer leads the world, said Wolfgang Panofsky, director
ol the Stanford Linear Accelerator. The W particle ex
periment was once planned for an American facility, but
was turned down for lack of funds.
I he best indication that the United States has slipped
behind European physics for the first time since the
World War 11 is not so much the discovery of the particle
a the performance of Americans at the last International
Conference on High Energy Phvsics in Paris. Panofsky
said.
"You have to say that, at that meeting, the U.S. con
tributions were severely lacking. I can say unequivocally
that for the first time, at that meeting, it wasclear that the
warnings we had sounded finally fit the facts," Panofsky
said.

Storm continues to wreak havoc
Giant breakers pounded the coastline from Eureka to Monterey yester
day, smashing beachfront homes and isolating others in swirling, tidal moats
as the fourth storm in five days churned toward Northern California.
Six homes on Stinson Beach splintered and washed away in the surf, and
seawater surging over a mile-long spit of land threatened up to 30 others.
Nearly 100 beachfront homes were under seige in the Santa Cruz County
town of Aptos, as debris-laden waves punched out picture windows and
swamped living rooms.
The fourth storm in less than a week was set to hit today "like the crack of
a whip," and may be followed by two more, said meteorologist Dick Vander.
Inland flooding from storm No. 3 that hit Wednesday routed more than
100 people from Tehama Citv and a helicopter plucked a dozen stranded
workmen off a broken levee northeast of Woodland.
Record tides in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta reached 10.34
feet at 1: 15 p.m., the highest level in 58 years, and water topped levees around
the delta's farming islands in several locations. But no breaches were re
ported. A tractor driver plugged a break in the Golden Island levee by driv
ing his vehicle into the breach.
Hundreds of people sought refuge in Red Cross evacuation centers lo
cated in Sonoma, Humboldt. San Mateo, Marin and Santa Cruz counties.
Two houses slid down a Fitch Mountain hillside near Healdsburg without
causing anv injury, and a Novato hillside turned to mud and surprised a
sleeping household when it crashed indoors.
Just as the rain began to dissipate early yesterday, near-record tides rang
ing up to 10 feet rolled in with breakers 20 feet high in Humboldt Bay and
Santa Cruz, swelling rivers and creeks as it surged inland.
In Aptos, fierce waves broke on 75 to 100 beachfront homes, smashing
picture windows and eroding their foundations. "The water is going right
through them, said assistant fire chief Al Forbes. "They have swimming
pools in their living room.
Marin Countv was beset bv tides along both the Pacific coast and the bay
shores. Stinson and Muir beaches were closed after surf and debris clogged
roads.
Sections of twisting Highway I along the coast and nu
merous access ramps to inland Highway 101 also were
closed, and streets in low-lying areas of Tiburon. San
Rafael and Belsedere were impassable because of high
water.
\bout 50 floating docks at the San Francisco marina
were torn loose by the morning tide, and a fishing vessel
keeled over and sank in heavs surf near Alcatraz Wednes
day.
About 1600 San Francisco Peninsula residents were
ssuhout telephone service, and 10.0(H) people from Marin
County to the Santa Cruz Mountains had no electricity.
In Southern California, the coastline got its worst bat
tering in years yesterday from a vicious storm that swept
homes and historic piers into the churning sea, caused
widespread flooding and forced hundreds of residents to
flee for higher ground.
\l least three people died in sseather-related accidents
and three homes were destroyed by pounding surf de
scribed bs longtime residents as the worst in decades.
"I knew it was all over when 1 saw the hot tub sail by
into the ocean," said Becky llagan, who fled her
beachfront Malibu home just before it collapsed into the
rolling Pacific Ocean.
Because of the damage. Gov. George Deukmejian de
clared Los Angeles and San Diego counties disaster
areas. The governor s declaration entitles the counties to
money to repair damage to real public property, Deu
kmejian's press secretary. Larry Thomas, said in Los An
geles late yesterday.
\ formal request for disaster assistance for Orange
Counts, which earlier on Thursday had declared a local
stale of emergency, had not yet been received by the gov
ernor, Thomas said.
Another "vigorous" storm will hit the region tonight
or tomorrow morning, said Bob Grebe of the National
Weather Service.
Motorists and hillside residents were warned of mud
and rockslides. Heavy surf advisories were to be in effect
at least through todav
Volcker predicts recovery
Washington — Federal Reserve Chairman Paul
Volcker, backing President Reagan's plan for a standby
tax increase, said yesterday the economy is poised for an
enduring recovery although concern over huge projected
budget deficits "clouds the future."
Volcker said interest rates would come down further,
strengthening an upturn, if Congress promptly adopted
measures to reduce red-ink spending that is expected to
increase even in a period of expansion.
Referring to evidence of renewed economic growth, he
told the Joint Economic Committee of Congress: "We
can see some crocuses blooming."
He praised Reagan's proposal for a three-year tax in
crease of up to SI 50 billion that would be triggered if defi
cits did not drop below SlOO billion bv October 1985.
"But as things now stand, fear of growing deficits
clouds the future and contributes to market pressures and
inflationary uncertainties, adding to the burdens of mon
etary policy," Volcker said.

"Left unattended, the situation ssould pose a strong
potential for a clash between the need to finance the defi
cit and the rising financial requirements for housing and
the business investment that is crucial to a healthy re
covery," he added.
But Volcker opposed "indexing" of income tax rates
— making adjustments to prevent inflation from auto
matically pushing taxpayers into higher brackets — that
Reagan wants to preserve in the lass although it vsill not
take effect until 1985. "I congenitallv do not like index
ing," he explained.
Volcker. whose term as chairman of the nation's cen
tral bank expires next August, refused to sa\ whether he
wants to be reappointed bs Reagan for another four
years, telling a questioner: "At this point I only discuss
that with my wife."
O'Neill supports jobs bill
Washington — House Speaker Thomas "Tip" O'Neill
(D-Mass.) told the nation's mayors yesterday that Presi
dent Reagan will h;ive to boss to grossing pressure for an
emergency jobs bill, and two conservative Senate Re
publicans split with the administration by announcing a
jobs program of their ossn.
A top White House official, however, said Reagan re
mains staunchly opposed to public svorks or public ser
vice jobs as temporary and unproductive.
"We certainly can afford to have a $5 billion to $7
billion jobs program this year." O'Neill told a meeting of
the U.S. Conference of Mayors. "1 truly believe that by
March the White House will be sending in a (jobs) pro
gram." O'Neill added later that he was "confident the
president w ill break down" on the jobs proposal.
In a separate move. Sens. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, chair
man of the Labor and Human Resources Committee,
and Dan Quavle, R-lnd., who heads its employment sub
committee, proposed to spend S2 billion to create about
250.000 public service jobs this vear.
Lhev said the money would be channeled through ex
isting programs to create "needed" and "worthwhile"
jobs in fields ranging from dav-care centers to nursing
care at veterans hospitals.
Asked about the prospect for public works jobs. Rich
ard Williamson, Reagan's assistant for intergovernmen
tal affairs, said: "The president's position has not
changed in his opposition to that type of program. Jobs
bills of this sort ... have usually proven unproductive and
have not created jobs. The answer to unemployment lies
in long-term, private sector jobs."
Egyptian oil production to rise
Cairo, Egypt — The United Arab Emirates announced
Wednesav night that it is dramatically increasing its oil
production and warned that prices may be cut soon in an
oil war following the collapse of the OPEC meeting
earlier this week.
In making public the decision to boost output by 45
percent to 1.6 million barrelsa day, the emirates' Oil Min
ister Mana Saeed Oteiba said that he could "almost see
now in front of my eves" a price cut by Arab producers in
the Persian Gulf.
The action bv the emirates, an ally of leading world oil

producer Saucii Arabia, suggested thai the Saudi-led bloc
of Persian < iult" states was prepared to raise production
and reduce prices in an effort to pressure its rivals in
< >PI ( to stop truni> to encroach on its share of the mar
ket.
I he emirates previously had been curtailing their pro
duction to help the Saudis prop up OPEC's official price
ol SU a barrel, but the two now ma\ be changing policy
to tr\ to lorce their rivals to stop offering price discounts
and accept production ceilings.
Mubarak wants Israel out of Lebanon
Washington — Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak,
declaring there is a "golden opportunity" for peace in the
Middle l ast, urged President Reagan yesterday to force
Israel to withdraw its troops from Lebanon.
"I pon achieving that, other aspects of the problem
would be easier to solve," Mubarak said after a two-hour
meeting with Reagan at the White House.
There was no indication that Mubarak asked Reagan
to suspend U.S. military or economic aid to Israel, al
though such a move bv the United States is known to be
under consideration.
Mubarak appealed publicly to the president to "move
further in supporting the rights of the Palestinian people
to self-determination."
He implied in his statement that an Israeli withdrawal
from Lebanon might not be enough to persuade Kine
Hussein of Jordan and Palestinian leaders to join peace
talks.
He asked Reagan to go beyond his proposal for
Palestinian self-rule, "in association" with Jordan, on the
West Bank of the Jordan River and in Gaza. And
Mubarak called for a free/.e on Jewish settlements and

Six homes on Stinson Beach splintered and washed away in the surf, and
seawater surging over a mile-long spit of land threatened up to 30 others.
Nearly 100 beachfront homes were under seige in the Santa Cruz County
town of Aptos, as debris-laden waves punched out picture windows and
swamped living rooms.
The fourth storm in less than a week was set to hit today "like the crack of
a whip," and may be followed by two more, said meteorologist Dick Vander.
Inland flooding from storm No. 3 that hit Wednesday routed more than
100 people from Tehama Citv and a helicopter plucked a dozen stranded
workmen off a broken levee northeast of Woodland.
Record tides in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta reached 10.34
feet at 1: 15 p.m., the highest level in 58 years, and water topped levees around
the delta's farming islands in several locations. But no breaches were re
ported. A tractor driver plugged a break in the Golden Island levee by driv
ing his vehicle into the breach.
Hundreds of people sought refuge in Red Cross evacuation centers lo
cated in Sonoma, Humboldt. San Mateo, Marin and Santa Cruz counties.
Two houses slid down a Fitch Mountain hillside near Healdsburg without
causing anv injury, and a Novato hillside turned to mud and surprised a
sleeping household when it crashed indoors.
Just as the rain began to dissipate early yesterday, near-record tides rang
ing up to 10 feet rolled in with breakers 20 feet high in Humboldt Bay and
Santa Cruz, swelling rivers and creeks as it surged inland.
In Aptos, fierce waves broke on 75 to 100 beachfront homes, smashing
picture windows and eroding their foundations. "The water is going right
through them, said assistant fire chief Al Forbes. "They have swimming
pools in their living room.
Marin Countv was beset bv tides along both the Pacific coast and the bay
shores. Stinson and Muir beaches were closed after surf and debris clogged
roads.
Sections of twisting Highway I along the coast and nu
merous access ramps to inland Highway 101 also were
closed, and streets in low-lying areas of Tiburon. San
Rafael and Belsedere were impassable because of high
water.
\bout 50 floating docks at the San Francisco marina
were torn loose by the morning tide, and a fishing vessel
keeled over and sank in heavs surf near Alcatraz Wednes
day.
About 1600 San Francisco Peninsula residents were
ssuhout telephone service, and 10.0(H) people from Marin
County to the Santa Cruz Mountains had no electricity.
In Southern California, the coastline got its worst bat
tering in years yesterday from a vicious storm that swept
homes and historic piers into the churning sea, caused
widespread flooding and forced hundreds of residents to
flee for higher ground.
\l least three people died in sseather-related accidents
and three homes were destroyed by pounding surf de
scribed bs longtime residents as the worst in decades.
"I knew it was all over when 1 saw the hot tub sail by
into the ocean," said Becky llagan, who fled her
beachfront Malibu home just before it collapsed into the
rolling Pacific Ocean.
Because of the damage. Gov. George Deukmejian de
clared Los Angeles and San Diego counties disaster
areas. The governor s declaration entitles the counties to
money to repair damage to real public property, Deu
kmejian's press secretary. Larry Thomas, said in Los An
geles late yesterday.
\ formal request for disaster assistance for Orange
Counts, which earlier on Thursday had declared a local
stale of emergency, had not yet been received by the gov
ernor, Thomas said.
Another "vigorous" storm will hit the region tonight
or tomorrow morning, said Bob Grebe of the National
Weather Service.
Motorists and hillside residents were warned of mud
and rockslides. Heavy surf advisories were to be in effect

Volcker predicts recovery
Washington — Federal Reserve Chairman Paul
Volcker, backing President Reagan's plan for a standby
tax increase, said yesterday the economy is poised for an
enduring recovery although concern over huge projected
budget deficits "clouds the future."
Volcker said interest rates would come down further,
strengthening an upturn, if Congress promptly adopted
measures to reduce red-ink spending that is expected to
increase even in a period of expansion.
Referring to evidence of renewed economic growth, he
told the Joint Economic Committee of Congress: "We
can see some crocuses blooming."
He praised Reagan's proposal for a three-year tax in
crease of up to SI 50 billion that would be triggered if defi
cits did not drop below SlOO billion bv October 1985.
"But as things now stand, fear of growing deficits
clouds the future and contributes to market pressures and
inflationary uncertainties, adding to the burdens of mon
etary policy," Volcker said.

"Left unattended, the situation ssould pose a strong
potential for a clash between the need to finance the defi
cit and the rising financial requirements for housing and
the business investment that is crucial to a healthy re
covery," he added.
But Volcker opposed "indexing" of income tax rates
— making adjustments to prevent inflation from auto
matically pushing taxpayers into higher brackets — that
Reagan wants to preserve in the lass although it vsill not
take effect until 1985. "I congenitallv do not like index
ing," he explained.
Volcker. whose term as chairman of the nation's cen
tral bank expires next August, refused to sa\ whether he
wants to be reappointed bs Reagan for another four
years, telling a questioner: "At this point I only discuss
that with my wife."
O'Neill supports jobs bill
Washington — House Speaker Thomas "Tip" O'Neill
(D-Mass.) told the nation's mayors yesterday that Presi
dent Reagan will h;ive to boss to grossing pressure for an
emergency jobs bill, and two conservative Senate Re
publicans split with the administration by announcing a
jobs program of their ossn.
A top White House official, however, said Reagan re
mains staunchly opposed to public svorks or public ser
vice jobs as temporary and unproductive.
"We certainly can afford to have a $5 billion to $7
billion jobs program this year." O'Neill told a meeting of
the U.S. Conference of Mayors. "1 truly believe that by
March the White House will be sending in a (jobs) pro
gram." O'Neill added later that he was "confident the
president w ill break down" on the jobs proposal.
In a separate move. Sens. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, chair
man of the Labor and Human Resources Committee,
and Dan Quavle, R-lnd., who heads its employment sub
committee, proposed to spend S2 billion to create about
250.000 public service jobs this vear.
Lhev said the money would be channeled through ex
isting programs to create "needed" and "worthwhile"
jobs in fields ranging from dav-care centers to nursing
care at veterans hospitals.
Asked about the prospect for public works jobs. Rich
ard Williamson, Reagan's assistant for intergovernmen
tal affairs, said: "The president's position has not
changed in his opposition to that type of program. Jobs
bills of this sort ... have usually proven unproductive and
have not created jobs. The answer to unemployment lies
in long-term, private sector jobs."
Egyptian oil production to rise
Cairo, Egypt — The United Arab Emirates announced
Wednesav night that it is dramatically increasing its oil
production and warned that prices may be cut soon in an
oil war following the collapse of the OPEC meeting
earlier this week.
In making public the decision to boost output by 45
percent to 1.6 million barrelsa day, the emirates' Oil Min
ister Mana Saeed Oteiba said that he could "almost see
now in front of my eves" a price cut by Arab producers in
the Persian Gulf.
The action bv the emirates, an ally of leading world oil

producer Saucii Arabia, suggested thai the Saudi-led bloc
of Persian < iult" states was prepared to raise production
and reduce prices in an effort to pressure its rivals in
< >PI ( to stop truni> to encroach on its share of the mar
ket.
I he emirates previously had been curtailing their pro
duction to help the Saudis prop up OPEC's official price
ol SU a barrel, but the two now ma\ be changing policy
to tr\ to lorce their rivals to stop offering price discounts
and accept production ceilings.
Mubarak wants Israel out of Lebanon
Washington — Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak,
declaring there is a "golden opportunity" for peace in the
Middle l ast, urged President Reagan yesterday to force
Israel to withdraw its troops from Lebanon.
"I pon achieving that, other aspects of the problem
would be easier to solve," Mubarak said after a two-hour
meeting with Reagan at the White House.
There was no indication that Mubarak asked Reagan
to suspend U.S. military or economic aid to Israel, al
though such a move bv the United States is known to be
under consideration.
Mubarak appealed publicly to the president to "move
further in supporting the rights of the Palestinian people
to self-determination."
He implied in his statement that an Israeli withdrawal
from Lebanon might not be enough to persuade Kine
Hussein of Jordan and Palestinian leaders to join peace
talks.
He asked Reagan to go beyond his proposal for
Palestinian self-rule, "in association" with Jordan, on the
West Bank of the Jordan River and in Gaza. And
Mubarak called for a free/.e on Jewish settlements and
other "settlement activity."
Bush to meet with NATO leaders
Washington — Vice President George Bush will not be
carrying a new U.S. arms-control proposal when he
meets with leaders of NATO nations next week, and he is
not prepared to negotiate any changes in the U.S. posi
tion. he said yesterday.
Bush, who will leave Sunday on 11-day, seven-nation
European trip, said at a press conference that the agenda
of his meetings with the officials would include dis
cussions of the U.S. negotiating stance on the deploy
ment of missiles in Western Europe.
He maintained that the U.S. offer — to cancel deploy
ment plans for 572 Pershing 2 and cruise missiles if the
Soviets would eliminate their 600 or more ballistic mis
siles already installed in European Russia — would be the
best outcome of the ongoing arms-control negotiations in
Geneva, Switzerland.
Moscow has rejected that proposal, calling instead for
a common ceiling of 162 missiles for itself and for
Western European countries. The combined Erench and
British nuclear-missile arsenal totals 162, so the effect of
the Soviet offer would be to prohibit deployment of U.S.
missiles in Europe.
In this impasse, an increasing number of Europeans
and Americans have called for what they see as greater
realism in the U.S. position. These critics maintain that

Moscow will not trade itsemplaced missiles for U.S. mis
siles that now exist onlv on paper.
Bush said that the United States is prepared to be
somew hat flexible in the negotiations-. Ifthe Soviet Union
coir.u.t forward with "a meaningful proposal that offers
balance and equality." the United States is prepared to
seriously examine it, he said.
I he vice president will visit all the nations of the North
\tlantic I reatv Organization in which the new U.S. mis
siles are scheduled to be placed, starting late this year:
W est Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, Italy and
(ireat Britain. He will deliver major speeches in Berlin
and London and will address the U.N. Disarmament
C ommission in Geneva. He will meet with both Soviet
and I .S. representatives to the Kuromissile and strategic
arms talks in Geneva.
Bush also will visit France and Switzerland.
U.S. physics preeminence questioned
Washington — American physics has declined from a
position ol preeminence in the world a decade ago to a
point where leadership in kev areas has clearly nassed to
other countries, according to some leading physicists.
I he discovery announced this week of the elusive "W
particle, the carrier of one of the four fundamental
forces in the universe, was just one sign that America no
longer leads the world, said Wolfgang Panofsky, director
ol the Stanford Linear Accelerator. The W particle ex
periment was once planned for an American facility, but
was turned down for lack of funds.
I he best indication that the United States has slipped
behind European physics for the first time since the
World War 11 is not so much the discovery of the particle
a the performance of Americans at the last International
Conference on High Energy Phvsics in Paris. Panofsky
said.
"You have to say that, at that meeting, the U.S. con
tributions were severely lacking. I can say unequivocally
that for the first time, at that meeting, it wasclear that the
warnings we had sounded finally fit the facts," Panofsky
said.
