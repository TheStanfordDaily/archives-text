Storm continues to wreak havoc
Giant breakers pounded the coastline from Eureka to Monterey yester
day, smashing beachfront homes and isolating others in swirling, tidal moats
as the fourth storm in five days churned toward Northern California.
Six homes on Stinson Beach splintered and washed away in the surf, and
seawater surging over a mile-long spit of land threatened up to 30 others.
Nearly 100 beachfront homes were under seige in the Santa Cruz County
town of Aptos, as debris-laden waves punched out picture windows and
swamped living rooms.
The fourth storm in less than a week was set to hit today "like the crack of
a whip," and may be followed by two more, said meteorologist Dick Vander.
Inland flooding from storm No. 3 that hit Wednesday routed more than
100 people from Tehama Citv and a helicopter plucked a dozen stranded
workmen off a broken levee northeast of Woodland.
Record tides in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta reached 10.34
feet at 1: 15 p.m., the highest level in 58 years, and water topped levees around
the delta's farming islands in several locations. But no breaches were re
ported. A tractor driver plugged a break in the Golden Island levee by driv
ing his vehicle into the breach.
Hundreds of people sought refuge in Red Cross evacuation centers lo
cated in Sonoma, Humboldt. San Mateo, Marin and Santa Cruz counties.
Two houses slid down a Fitch Mountain hillside near Healdsburg without
causing anv injury, and a Novato hillside turned to mud and surprised a
sleeping household when it crashed indoors.
Just as the rain began to dissipate early yesterday, near-record tides rang
ing up to 10 feet rolled in with breakers 20 feet high in Humboldt Bay and
Santa Cruz, swelling rivers and creeks as it surged inland.
In Aptos, fierce waves broke on 75 to 100 beachfront homes, smashing
picture windows and eroding their foundations. "The water is going right
through them, said assistant fire chief Al Forbes. "They have swimming
pools in their living room.
Marin Countv was beset bv tides along both the Pacific coast and the bay
shores. Stinson and Muir beaches were closed after surf and debris clogged
roads.
