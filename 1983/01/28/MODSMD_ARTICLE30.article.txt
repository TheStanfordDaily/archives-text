ESTRELLITA RESTAURANT
971 N. San Antonio Rd.

• I've heard it said that you can
tell a good authentic Mexican
Restaurant by the calendars on
the wall — not that I've actually
understood that comment(?)
and I certainly doubt the credi
bility of such a statement. But La
Estrellita does have good au-
I thentic Mexican food and it also
has its share of calendars. (I
leave it to you to determine if
there actually is a direct relation
ship between the quality of food
and calendared

It was not your usual
Mexican dinner
fanfare. This was
actually authentic
and delicious. When
they say "grande"
they mean "grande!"

Located on San Antonio
Road, La Estrellita is tucked
away in a small, unnoticeable
corner. You wouldn't know it
was there if you weren't looking
for it. I had never noticed it be
fore nor had I ever dined there. It
was a new experience, so on
Saturday night at peak dining
Hours (6:30 p.m.), I was evasive
about arriving without dinner
reservations. But my fear (a fear
which intensifies as the hunger
pangs increase) of waiting end
less hours were quickly al
leviated. The main and only din
ing room had not yet been filled
to capacity. There were still quite
a few empty tables. Good sign, I
think? But then you start won
dering . . . why isn't it filled to
capacity, particularly at peak
dining hours? . .. hm . . . What's
wrong? . . . Inflation, people
can't afford to eat out? . . . or . . .
hm . . . but let's not jump to con
clusions.
As we entered, our hostess
greeted us. Nice and efficient

person thut she was, she seated
us immediately at a small, incon
spicuous table for two. From the
table I had access to a good over
all view of the restaurant. The
decor is done in early American
Pink. All four walls exude pink
ness (for all those who love the
color pink!). An assortment of
Mexican artifacts, the usual
sarapes and sombreros, and of
course, calendars, ranging from
ancient Aztec to the modern
Gregorian calendaV, cover the
walls. The atmosphere was relax
ing, a bit like home in what ap
pears to be this family-owned
restaurant.
Our waiter appeared just as
quickly and efficiently as our
hostess, and dinner began. We
decided to be adventurous and
try something new as opposed to
the usual Nachos, so we choose
the Ouesadilla Special. Well, I
must say we made a good choice!
The dish is a giant flour tortilla
filled with melted cheese,
chorizo (a spicy Mexican saus
age) and a spicy (but not too
spicy) green chile sauce. It was
wonderful, a welcome variation
to Nachos and a perfect way to
begin dinner.
I was about to order another
when the waiter appeared with
our dinner salads. 1 must say he
was a very competent fellow.
The service was excellent. The
salads weren't exceptional, vin
egar and oil, but my main con
cern was the coming attraction
— dinner.
I ordered the combination
plate — the biggest they had —
El Rancho Grande. This combi
nation plate allows you to choose
three out of five dishes plus rice,
beans and salad, all for $7.95. I,
myself, chose a chile relleno (just
love those green chiles!) which is
a great big green chile stuffed
with cheese and onions, dipped
in egg batter then fried (excel
lent); a tamale which is home
made corn dough with a beef fil
ling covered with red sauce,
wrapped in a corn husk and
steam-cooked, and an enchilada

which is a soft corn tortilla stuf
fed with chicken, cheese and
onion and covered with red
sauce. My friend ordered "The
Great Burrito." And, yes, it was
huge. It was topped with green
chile sauce and cheese, filled
with your choice of combinations
(my friend chose beef and beans)
and served with a dinner salad at
$5.95.
We weren't disappointed. The
food was great. It was just like
Mom's — even a little better and
my Mom can really dish out fan
tastic Mexican food! It was not
your usual Mexican dinner fan
fare. This was actually authentic
and delicious. Plus they bring
you plenty to feast upon. When
they say "grande" they mean
"grande." There was only one
exception, the rice. It wasn't
quite as tasty as the other dishes.
But this was minor in compari
son to our sheer enjoyment of
the other dishes.
Despite our obvious fulfill
ment and being stuffed to maxi
mum proportions, we could not
leave without ordering the one
and only dessert La Estrellita of
fers. Are you ready for the name
— Sopatillas. This dish consists
of deep fried flour batter, sprink
led with sugar and served with
maple syrup (the maple syrup
you can pour at your own discre
tion). They serve three large
pieces for $2.50. An absolute
Mexican pleasure. It tasted light
and crunchy, not too rich, and
pleasing to the taste buds. (A
must for those who are always on
the lookout for those genuine
Mexican dishes.)
And, oh yes, for any beer lov
ers out there, they have a great
selection of Mexican beer —
Carte Blanca, Dos Equis, Te
cate. Sorry no Margaritas, but
they do have a wine selection.
As our evening ended, I noted
joyfully that there wasn't an
empty table in the dining area.
No, for those who enjoy true, de
licious Mexican cuisine, this is
not a restaurant to overlook.
