APOSTOLIS OLD COUNTRY
RESTAURANT

When we parked outside
Apostolis my first thought was
"oh well, you win some, you lose
some." From the street the res
taurant doesn't look like much.
But two hours and one filling
meal later I came out feeling
much the winner from my ven
ture into the world of Greek
cuisine.
Once inside the restaurant my
partner and I were swept up in
the warmth of Apostolis. Simple
white walls are attractively deco
rated with Greek momentous,
including authentic Greek garb.
The dining area, though small by
most standards, serves its clien
tele well. A flight of stairs led to a
balcony dining room which over
sees the main floor.
Greek food, for the unini
tiated, must be approached with
an attitude of adventure. It is a
mixture of flavors, some spicy,
some bitter, some sweet. But
seldom is it ever bland. For this

reason the traditional palate is
forewarned.
More than a little intimidated
by the exotic choices before us,
we took some time to make out
selections from the extensive
menu. We deliberated over the
appetizers which included
saganaki, fried kasseri cheese
($2.50) and anginares, mari
nated artichoke hearts ($2.50)
and finally settled on oretakia an
assortment of specialty items
which included rice-stuffed
grape leaves and salty olives with
a side dish of Greek caviar
($2.75) and a variety of Greek
cheeses.
Apostolis serves 20 different
entrees in five different
categories so choosing a main
course is no easy matter. Lamb,
veal, chicken, seafood and spe
cialty dishes are equally tempt
ing and range in price from $7.95
for Kota Psiti, a half chicken
roasted and basted with butter,
lemon and herbs to $12.95 for
Brizoles, a serving of char
broiled loin lamb chops.
All meals are served with au
golemeno soup (a lemon fla

vored egg soup), grecian salad
made with spinach and a spiced
vinegar dressing, a fresh vegeta
ble and choice of potato or rice.
A complimentary Koulouda
bread which strongly resembles a
soft french sourdough is also
served.
For the main course we chose
Mosharaki Yemisti, a concoction
of veal, sausage and cheese and
Diaforetica, the chefs choice
combination plate. That evening
the chef s plate included layers of
sliced eggplant topped by ground
lamb and imported cheeses,
boneless chicken covered in a
cream sauce, cabbage and rice.
Each bite is bound to startle
your tastebuds. And sometimes
the awakening is none too gen
tle. The augolemeno soup has a
strong lemon base, so if lemons
make you pucker steer clear.
My main course, thin slices of
veal wrapped around locanico
sausage and a layer of feta
cheese, caught me by surprise if
only because of its spicy season
ing. I had little trouble however
adjusting to the new taste sensa
tion and soon polished off my

serving. My partner voiced ap
proval of his meal as well and
pronounced the accompanying
rice excellent.
If you can, save room to at
least sample one of the five
mouth watering greek pastries
Apostolis features. We tried the
baklava ($1.75) and were temp
ted to send for more. Layers of
chopped walnuts and filo (the
pastry) topped with a light honey
syrup gave rise to more than one
contented sigh. And for the
chocolate fanatic Apostolis pre
pared choclava (also $1.75), a
chocolate-coated version of the
baklava.
Only one waitress, Barbara,
was on duty during our visit, but
at no cost to efficiency. Barbara
chatted amiably with diners,
most of whom appeared to be
regulars. Though we were seated
without a reservation calling
ahead is recommended for
weekend seating. Available for
catering and banquets the res
taurant requires a minimum ser
vice charge of $K per person.
