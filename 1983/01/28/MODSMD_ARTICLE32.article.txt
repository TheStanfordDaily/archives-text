# Toots and the Maytals mash down Babylon

### JOHN NORDELL 
From the moment he hit the
stage, reggae star "Toots" Hib
bert began dancing, prancing
and singing with non-stop fervor.
His uplifting vocals and joyous
air immediately got the crowd
dancing, and Toots welcomed
the energy from the enthusiastic
crowd, as it was his third per
formance in two nights.

sional Maytals command respect
as they provide music ranging
from rock steady, to reggae, to
soul, mirroring and complement
ing the diversity of Toots' voice.
The performers opened with
"Pressure Drop," widely
popularized from the Maytals
appearance in "The Harder
They Come" and more recently
a version by the Clash. From this
start, as throughout the show,
the audience joined Toots in
singing, especially on the chorus:
"When it drops/ You're gonna
feel it." The Maytals cranked out
a backing rock steady beat, simi

lar to reggae yet faster. Rock
steady evolved from ska. popular
in and native to Jamaica in the
early and mid '60s. Reggae in
turn, evolved from rock steady.
After " Pressure Drop," was a
rendition of the classic "Country
Roads," followed by a song con
cerning Jamaica's early history: a
description of the native Arawak
indians and the "discovery" by
Columbus. In contrast to this
song's explanation of Jamaicans'
roots, the lead guitarist screamed
the first of his flashy rock and
roll solos to the delight of the
non-strictly reggae members of
the crowd and Toots, who ap
provingly urged the young musi
cians on.
Following several more songs
in the rock steady style, the
Maytals took the rhythm way
down on "Careless Ethiopians,"
a track from Toots and the
Maytals latest LP: Knock Out.
Though Toots does not sport the
dreadlocks associated with Ras
tafarians, this song captured yet
another aspect — the spiritual —
of reggae music. Near the end of
the song, the bass player and
drummer dubbed it out. As the
drummer accented the second
and fourth counts in the one drop
reggae fashion. Toots' body fol
lowed the beat up and down.
Other highlights included
"5436 That's My Number," and
"Monkey Man," recently copied
by The Specials, which inspired
the crowd to nearly the pogo
level."Give You Some More," is
a funk tune, complete with
scratchy James Brown evoking
rhythm guitar, played by Axe
Brown. Then with a beautiful,
gospel-like tribute to Bob Mar
ley, Toots recounted the events
surrounding Marley's death.
"Marley's gone away but his
songs live on today." True.
"Reggae Got Soul" was the

final number. It extended on and
on, with the call and response
chant passing from Toots to the
audience and back: "You got
soul And 1 got soul/ Everybody
got soul/ Got so much
soul."Toots introduced his band,
letting the spotlight shine on
their talents, including the lead
guiiarist who played a solo with
his teeth. Of special note were
the wailing back-up singers, Pam
and Audrey Hall, who skanked
in sync. When Toots presented
Pam, she went into the toasting
Jamaican D.J. style, the Carib
bean forerunner of rap.
It was a polished act by vete
ran performers. Yet even so, the
demands of touring were man
ifest as halfway through the
show. Toot's voice almost gave
out. Though slightly hoarse, he
made it through the evening, al
lowing the faithful crowd to
sometimes sing the words of his
hits while he rested his vocal
chords.
Toots and the Maytals were
one of the first reggae bands to
tour through the Bay Area in the
seventies and proved they can
still mash down Babylon in the
eighties.
