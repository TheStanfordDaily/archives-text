The Last Supper (1978)
Zapata Lounge
Tomas Gutierrez Alea, the
Cuban filmmaker, made this
brilliant parable on the themes of
hypocrisy and betrayal. The pro
tagonist is a count (Nelson Vil
lagra, in a witty, subtle per
formance), owner of a sugar plan
tation in the late 18th century.
During taster Week, he stages a
Last Supper, casting himself as
Christ and inviting 12 slaves
chosen at random, whose feet he
washes and whose stomachs he
fills. When one of them, a failed
runaway recovering from the tor
ture he received on his return,
spits in the count's face, the count
strikes a pose of offended right
eousness and, likening the slave to
Judas Iscariot, recites solemnly,
"I washed you, but there is one
among you who is not vet clean."
Alea collaborated with Maria
Eugenia Hova and Tomas
Gonzalez on the script, and
Mario Garcia Jova's photogra
phy suggests, alternately, Italian
Renaissance frescoes and the
paintings of Rembrandt.
Plavs Thursday evening.
Little Women (1933) ★
Krege Auditorium
George Cukor filmed Louisa
May Alcott's story the same year
he made Dinner at Eight, and
though it has been given other
productions on film and tele
vision, this is easily the best. It is a
terrific example of how good the
Hollywood studio system could
be: what used to be called the
"production values" (i.e., art
direction and costumes) are ex
ecuted with great care, the nar
rative is reassuringly strong, and
the cast (except for insipid Jean
Parker as Beth) works together
beautifully. Joan Bennett is Amy,
Frances Dee is Meg, Spring By
ington is Marmee, Edna Mav Ol
iver is Aunt March, Douglass
Montgomery is Laurie, Paul
Lukas is Professor Baer, Henrv
Stephenson is Mr. Laurence, and,

in only her second vear in movies,
Katharine Hepburn plavs Jo.
You feel that Alcott must have
created Jo fully believing that one
day an actress just like Hepburn
would come along to plav her. No
one else could have brought such
heartbreaking intensity to the
scene in which Jo bemoans Meg's
being drawn awav from the fami
ly into a romance, or another in
which she rejects Laurie's pro
posal and then tells Marmee, "I
feel as if I'd stabbed my best
friend." It's a great performance,
and one of the few that truly
shows a character's ascension to
maturity.
Plays tonight.
Kamouraska (1973)
International Center
The Quebecois director Claude
Jutra was responsible for the best
film ever made bv a Canadian —
My (Jncle Anloine — but all of his
other features have been disap
pointments. This big-budget
melodrama was based on a popu
lar historical novel by Anne
Hebert, and it's not bad, really,
though when it's over you may
wonder exactly why it was made.
In 19th-century Quebec, Gen
evieve Bujold is wretchedly mar
ried to a boor, played by Philippe

Leotard, so she has a passionate
affair with Richard Jordan, the
new doctor in town. In the most
lively scene, she and her lover ar
rive at a party very late and soak
ing wet because their sleigh over
turned in the snow; without bat
ting an eve, she stalks up to the
punch bowl, downs a glass, and
proclaims, "This is the best punch
of my life" (which sounds better
in French). Michel Brault did the
breathtaking cinematography.
Plays Thursday evening.

Absence of Malice (1981)
Memorial Auditorium
The story, an indictment of ir
responsible journalism and in
sidious methods of criminal in
vestigation, is perfectly plausible:
when the leader of the long
shoremen's union disappears, the
Justice Department's organized
crime strike force chief (Bob
Balaban), convinced that the son
of the missing man's arch-enemy
(Paul Newman) is somehow im
plicated, lets a crime beat journal
ist (Sally Field) do his investigat
ing for him. Her story about the
son sets off a disastrous chain of
events — and he happens to be in
nocent. Kurt Luedtke's script has
the virtue of straightforwardness;
what is missing is the possibility
of contradiction. He and the di
rector, Sydney Pollack, don't ask
us to weigh the issues — they've
already decided who's to blame
and how everyone should have
behaved. Paul Newman's per
formance is the only real sub
stance in the movie.
Plays Sunday evening.

The Bicycle Thief (1948) ★
Kresge Auditorium
Vittorio De Sica's fable about a
man driven to stealing in the pov
erty-stricken Rome of the post-
World War II epoch appears on
every list of all-time great movies.
Like the two other neo-realist
masterpieces De Sica made with
screenwriter Cesare Zavattini,
Shoeshine and Umberto D, this
movie touches one so intimately
that it is almost an invasion of
privacy; it is shocking, shattering
and finally exhilarating. De Sica
takes us to the deepest reaches of
despair and out the other side.
With Lamberto Maggiorani,
Lianella Carell and Enzo Staiola.
Plays Monday evening.

Psycho (1960) ★
Terman Auditorium
Alfred Hitchcock's most
lauded picture. It will scare the
hell out of you if you're seeing it
for the first time; the initiated re
turn again and again to marvel at
the intricate design of the sus
pense sequences, and the in
terplay between George
Tomasini's editing and Bernard
Herrmann's jangling, expressive
music (scored solely for strings
during the shower scene). Watch
ing this Grand Guignol comedy,
with its motel office full of stuffed
birds and its extravagant, aber
rant sexual psychology, is a per
verse pleasure: no movie until
Jaws was so wittily sadistic in its
treatment of the audience. An
thony Perkins is marvellous as the

creepy motel owner, Norman
Bates: the supporting cast is
headed by Janet Leigh, Vera
Miles, Martin Balsam, John
(iavin, John Mclntire and Simon
Oakland. Psycho turned out to be
Hitchcock's summit achieve
ment: none of his subsequent
half-dozen movies can even be
discussed in the same breath.
Plays tonight.
Apocalypse Now (1979)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Francis Ford Coppola's ver
sion of Heart of Darkness, set in
the jungles of Vietnam. Vittorio
Storaro has shot the film in Con
rad's colors — deep greens with a
heavy white mist — and the sound
recording, designed by Walter
Murch and executed in Dolby
Stereo, is awesome; the best se
quences are surreal, nightmarish.
Unfortunately, during the three
years of shooting Coppola must
have lost his hold on his ideas.
The movie lacks focus and its

hero. Captain Wil lard (inex
pressively played bv Martin
Sheen), is such a zombie from the
beginning that there's nowhere
for him to go. Kurtz is plaved by
Marlon Brando, who reads "The
Hollow Men" aloud and gives an
opaque performance. If crazy Lt.
Kilgore (Robert Duvall), who
bombs islands so that he can surf
off them, had been used as the
symbol for this war rather than
Kurtz, the movie might have
made more sense. However, the
helicopter attack sequence is
worth seeing the movie for: it is
just about the best war footage in
any movie.
Plavs tomorrow and Sunday
with Taxi Driver.

★ Highly recommended
Taxi Driver (1976) ★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
In this unforgettable movie,
Martin Scorsese gets closer to
Dostoevski than anv American
director ever has. Robert De
Niro, in a classic performance, is
Travis Bickle, the Underground
Man as cabbie, and New York is
his private hell — New York,
where steam rises from the sub
way gratings like smoke off
brimstone, and where the rain
drenched pavement has a glitter
ing, slimv surface. Scorsese and
his cameraman, Michael Chap
man, manage to make this urban
nightmare citv seductive and re
pellent at the same time. Paul
Schrader wrote the script, which
includes terrific parts for Cybill
Shepherd (as the object of
Bickle's adoration), Jodie Foster
(as a 12-year-old hooker), Peter
Boyle (as another cab driver), and
Harvey Keitel (as a pimp). On a
smaller scale, Keitel's per
formance is almost as effective as
De Niro's — his flickering, ner
vous energy plavs against the
time-bomb tension of the movie.
Plavs tomorrow and Sunday
with Apocalypse Now.
Key Largo (1948)
Festival, Palo Alto
This is often referred to as a
Bogart classic, but actually he is
upstaged bv Edward G. Rob
inson, playing a sadistic hood,
and the abrasive theatrics of
Claire Trevor in the role of his al
coholic mistress. She is so revved
up that you can feel her just plead
ing for the Oscar that, of course,
she received; the scene in which
she sings "Moanin' Low" in a
woozv tremolo in order to earn a
drink from Robinson is memo
rably bad. The cast also includes
Lauren Bacall, Lionel Barrvmore
and Thomas Gomez. John
Huston directed, with so much
energy that he successfully dis
guises some of the hokum in the
script that he and Richard Brooks
worked up (from a best-forgotten
plav by Maxwell Anderson).
Plavs through Wednesday with
The Big Sleep.

George Cukor filmed Louisa
May Alcott's story the same year
he made Dinner at Eight, and
though it has been given other
productions on film and tele
vision, this is easily the best. It is a
terrific example of how good the
Hollywood studio system could
be: what used to be called the
"production values" (i.e., art
direction and costumes) are ex
ecuted with great care, the nar
rative is reassuringly strong, and
the cast (except for insipid Jean
Parker as Beth) works together
beautifully. Joan Bennett is Amy,
Frances Dee is Meg, Spring By
ington is Marmee, Edna Mav Ol
iver is Aunt March, Douglass
Montgomery is Laurie, Paul
Lukas is Professor Baer, Henrv
Stephenson is Mr. Laurence, and,

in only her second vear in movies,
Katharine Hepburn plavs Jo.
You feel that Alcott must have
created Jo fully believing that one
day an actress just like Hepburn
would come along to plav her. No
one else could have brought such
heartbreaking intensity to the
scene in which Jo bemoans Meg's
being drawn awav from the fami
ly into a romance, or another in
which she rejects Laurie's pro
posal and then tells Marmee, "I
feel as if I'd stabbed my best
friend." It's a great performance,
and one of the few that truly
shows a character's ascension to
maturity.
Plays tonight.
Kamouraska (1973)
International Center
The Quebecois director Claude
Jutra was responsible for the best
film ever made bv a Canadian —
My (Jncle Anloine — but all of his
other features have been disap
pointments. This big-budget
melodrama was based on a popu
lar historical novel by Anne
Hebert, and it's not bad, really,
though when it's over you may
wonder exactly why it was made.
In 19th-century Quebec, Gen
evieve Bujold is wretchedly mar
ried to a boor, played by Philippe

Leotard, so she has a passionate
affair with Richard Jordan, the
new doctor in town. In the most
lively scene, she and her lover ar
rive at a party very late and soak
ing wet because their sleigh over
turned in the snow; without bat
ting an eve, she stalks up to the
punch bowl, downs a glass, and
proclaims, "This is the best punch
of my life" (which sounds better
in French). Michel Brault did the
breathtaking cinematography.
Plays Thursday evening.

Absence of Malice (1981)
Memorial Auditorium
The story, an indictment of ir
responsible journalism and in
sidious methods of criminal in
vestigation, is perfectly plausible:
when the leader of the long
shoremen's union disappears, the
Justice Department's organized
crime strike force chief (Bob
Balaban), convinced that the son
of the missing man's arch-enemy
(Paul Newman) is somehow im
plicated, lets a crime beat journal
ist (Sally Field) do his investigat
ing for him. Her story about the
son sets off a disastrous chain of
events — and he happens to be in
nocent. Kurt Luedtke's script has
the virtue of straightforwardness;
what is missing is the possibility
of contradiction. He and the di
rector, Sydney Pollack, don't ask
us to weigh the issues — they've
already decided who's to blame
and how everyone should have
behaved. Paul Newman's per
formance is the only real sub
stance in the movie.
Plays Sunday evening.

The Bicycle Thief (1948) ★
Kresge Auditorium
Vittorio De Sica's fable about a
man driven to stealing in the pov
erty-stricken Rome of the post-
World War II epoch appears on
every list of all-time great movies.
Like the two other neo-realist
masterpieces De Sica made with
screenwriter Cesare Zavattini,
Shoeshine and Umberto D, this
movie touches one so intimately
that it is almost an invasion of
privacy; it is shocking, shattering
and finally exhilarating. De Sica
takes us to the deepest reaches of
despair and out the other side.
With Lamberto Maggiorani,
Lianella Carell and Enzo Staiola.
Plays Monday evening.

Psycho (1960) ★
Terman Auditorium
Alfred Hitchcock's most
lauded picture. It will scare the
hell out of you if you're seeing it
for the first time; the initiated re
turn again and again to marvel at
the intricate design of the sus
pense sequences, and the in
terplay between George
Tomasini's editing and Bernard
Herrmann's jangling, expressive
music (scored solely for strings
during the shower scene). Watch
ing this Grand Guignol comedy,
with its motel office full of stuffed
birds and its extravagant, aber
rant sexual psychology, is a per
verse pleasure: no movie until
Jaws was so wittily sadistic in its
treatment of the audience. An
thony Perkins is marvellous as the

creepy motel owner, Norman
Bates: the supporting cast is
headed by Janet Leigh, Vera
Miles, Martin Balsam, John
(iavin, John Mclntire and Simon
Oakland. Psycho turned out to be
Hitchcock's summit achieve
ment: none of his subsequent
half-dozen movies can even be
discussed in the same breath.
Plays tonight.
Apocalypse Now (1979)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Francis Ford Coppola's ver
sion of Heart of Darkness, set in
the jungles of Vietnam. Vittorio
Storaro has shot the film in Con
rad's colors — deep greens with a
heavy white mist — and the sound
recording, designed by Walter
Murch and executed in Dolby
Stereo, is awesome; the best se
quences are surreal, nightmarish.
Unfortunately, during the three
years of shooting Coppola must
have lost his hold on his ideas.
The movie lacks focus and its

hero. Captain Wil lard (inex
pressively played bv Martin
Sheen), is such a zombie from the
beginning that there's nowhere
for him to go. Kurtz is plaved by
Marlon Brando, who reads "The
Hollow Men" aloud and gives an
opaque performance. If crazy Lt.
Kilgore (Robert Duvall), who
bombs islands so that he can surf
off them, had been used as the
symbol for this war rather than
Kurtz, the movie might have
made more sense. However, the
helicopter attack sequence is
worth seeing the movie for: it is
just about the best war footage in
any movie.
Plavs tomorrow and Sunday
with Taxi Driver.

★ Highly recommended
Taxi Driver (1976) ★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
In this unforgettable movie,
Martin Scorsese gets closer to
Dostoevski than anv American
director ever has. Robert De
Niro, in a classic performance, is
Travis Bickle, the Underground
Man as cabbie, and New York is
his private hell — New York,
where steam rises from the sub
way gratings like smoke off
brimstone, and where the rain
drenched pavement has a glitter
ing, slimv surface. Scorsese and
his cameraman, Michael Chap
man, manage to make this urban
nightmare citv seductive and re
pellent at the same time. Paul
Schrader wrote the script, which
includes terrific parts for Cybill
Shepherd (as the object of
Bickle's adoration), Jodie Foster
(as a 12-year-old hooker), Peter
Boyle (as another cab driver), and
Harvey Keitel (as a pimp). On a
smaller scale, Keitel's per
formance is almost as effective as
De Niro's — his flickering, ner
vous energy plavs against the
time-bomb tension of the movie.
Plavs tomorrow and Sunday
with Apocalypse Now.
Key Largo (1948)
Festival, Palo Alto
This is often referred to as a
Bogart classic, but actually he is
upstaged bv Edward G. Rob
inson, playing a sadistic hood,
and the abrasive theatrics of
Claire Trevor in the role of his al
coholic mistress. She is so revved
up that you can feel her just plead
ing for the Oscar that, of course,
she received; the scene in which
she sings "Moanin' Low" in a
woozv tremolo in order to earn a
drink from Robinson is memo
rably bad. The cast also includes
Lauren Bacall, Lionel Barrvmore
and Thomas Gomez. John
Huston directed, with so much
energy that he successfully dis
guises some of the hokum in the
script that he and Richard Brooks
worked up (from a best-forgotten
plav by Maxwell Anderson).
Plavs through Wednesday with
The Big Sleep.

most careful and visual

The Last Supper (1978)
Zapata Lounge
Tomas Gutierrez Alea, the
Cuban filmmaker, made this
brilliant parable on the themes of
hypocrisy and betrayal. The pro
tagonist is a count (Nelson Vil
lagra, in a witty, subtle per
formance), owner of a sugar plan
tation in the late 18th century.
During taster Week, he stages a
Last Supper, casting himself as
Christ and inviting 12 slaves
chosen at random, whose feet he
washes and whose stomachs he
fills. When one of them, a failed
runaway recovering from the tor
ture he received on his return,
spits in the count's face, the count
strikes a pose of offended right
eousness and, likening the slave to
Judas Iscariot, recites solemnly,
"I washed you, but there is one
among you who is not vet clean."
Alea collaborated with Maria
Eugenia Hova and Tomas
Gonzalez on the script, and
Mario Garcia Jova's photogra
phy suggests, alternately, Italian
Renaissance frescoes and the
paintings of Rembrandt.

Kamouraska (1973)
International Center
The Quebecois director Claude
Jutra was responsible for the best
film ever made bv a Canadian —
My (Jncle Anloine — but all of his
other features have been disap
pointments. This big-budget
melodrama was based on a popu
lar historical novel by Anne
Hebert, and it's not bad, really,
though when it's over you may
wonder exactly why it was made.
In 19th-century Quebec, Gen
evieve Bujold is wretchedly mar
ried to a boor, played by Philippe

Leotard, so she has a passionate
affair with Richard Jordan, the
new doctor in town. In the most
lively scene, she and her lover ar
rive at a party very late and soak
ing wet because their sleigh over
turned in the snow; without bat
ting an eve, she stalks up to the
punch bowl, downs a glass, and
proclaims, "This is the best punch
of my life" (which sounds better
in French). Michel Brault did the
breathtaking cinematography.
Plays Thursday evening.

Absence of Malice (1981)
Memorial Auditorium
The story, an indictment of ir
responsible journalism and in
sidious methods of criminal in
vestigation, is perfectly plausible:
when the leader of the long
shoremen's union disappears, the
Justice Department's organized
crime strike force chief (Bob
Balaban), convinced that the son
of the missing man's arch-enemy
(Paul Newman) is somehow im
plicated, lets a crime beat journal
ist (Sally Field) do his investigat
ing for him. Her story about the
son sets off a disastrous chain of
events — and he happens to be in
nocent. Kurt Luedtke's script has
the virtue of straightforwardness;
what is missing is the possibility
of contradiction. He and the di
rector, Sydney Pollack, don't ask
us to weigh the issues — they've
already decided who's to blame
and how everyone should have
behaved. Paul Newman's per
formance is the only real sub
stance in the movie.
Plays Sunday evening.

The Bicycle Thief (1948) ★
Kresge Auditorium
Vittorio De Sica's fable about a
man driven to stealing in the pov
erty-stricken Rome of the post-
World War II epoch appears on
every list of all-time great movies.
Like the two other neo-realist
masterpieces De Sica made with
screenwriter Cesare Zavattini,
Shoeshine and Umberto D, this
movie touches one so intimately
that it is almost an invasion of
privacy; it is shocking, shattering
and finally exhilarating. De Sica
takes us to the deepest reaches of
despair and out the other side.
With Lamberto Maggiorani,
Lianella Carell and Enzo Staiola.
Plays Monday evening.

Psycho (1960) ★
Terman Auditorium
Alfred Hitchcock's most
lauded picture. It will scare the
hell out of you if you're seeing it
for the first time; the initiated re
turn again and again to marvel at
the intricate design of the sus
pense sequences, and the in
terplay between George
Tomasini's editing and Bernard
Herrmann's jangling, expressive
music (scored solely for strings
during the shower scene). Watch
ing this Grand Guignol comedy,
with its motel office full of stuffed
birds and its extravagant, aber
rant sexual psychology, is a per
verse pleasure: no movie until
Jaws was so wittily sadistic in its
treatment of the audience. An
thony Perkins is marvellous as the

creepy motel owner, Norman
Bates: the supporting cast is
headed by Janet Leigh, Vera
Miles, Martin Balsam, John
(iavin, John Mclntire and Simon
Oakland. Psycho turned out to be
Hitchcock's summit achieve
ment: none of his subsequent
half-dozen movies can even be
discussed in the same breath.
Plays tonight.
Apocalypse Now (1979)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Francis Ford Coppola's ver
sion of Heart of Darkness, set in
the jungles of Vietnam. Vittorio
Storaro has shot the film in Con
rad's colors — deep greens with a
heavy white mist — and the sound
recording, designed by Walter
Murch and executed in Dolby
Stereo, is awesome; the best se
quences are surreal, nightmarish.
Unfortunately, during the three
years of shooting Coppola must
have lost his hold on his ideas.
The movie lacks focus and its

hero. Captain Wil lard (inex
pressively played bv Martin
Sheen), is such a zombie from the
beginning that there's nowhere
for him to go. Kurtz is plaved by
Marlon Brando, who reads "The
Hollow Men" aloud and gives an
opaque performance. If crazy Lt.
Kilgore (Robert Duvall), who
bombs islands so that he can surf
off them, had been used as the
symbol for this war rather than
Kurtz, the movie might have
made more sense. However, the
helicopter attack sequence is
worth seeing the movie for: it is
just about the best war footage in
any movie.
Plavs tomorrow and Sunday
with Taxi Driver.

★ Highly recommended
Taxi Driver (1976) ★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
In this unforgettable movie,
Martin Scorsese gets closer to
Dostoevski than anv American
director ever has. Robert De
Niro, in a classic performance, is
Travis Bickle, the Underground
Man as cabbie, and New York is
his private hell — New York,
where steam rises from the sub
way gratings like smoke off
brimstone, and where the rain
drenched pavement has a glitter
ing, slimv surface. Scorsese and
his cameraman, Michael Chap
man, manage to make this urban
nightmare citv seductive and re
pellent at the same time. Paul
Schrader wrote the script, which
includes terrific parts for Cybill
Shepherd (as the object of
Bickle's adoration), Jodie Foster
(as a 12-year-old hooker), Peter
Boyle (as another cab driver), and
Harvey Keitel (as a pimp). On a
smaller scale, Keitel's per
formance is almost as effective as
De Niro's — his flickering, ner
vous energy plavs against the
time-bomb tension of the movie.
Plavs tomorrow and Sunday
with Apocalypse Now.
Key Largo (1948)
Festival, Palo Alto
This is often referred to as a
Bogart classic, but actually he is
upstaged bv Edward G. Rob
inson, playing a sadistic hood,
and the abrasive theatrics of
Claire Trevor in the role of his al
coholic mistress. She is so revved
up that you can feel her just plead
ing for the Oscar that, of course,
she received; the scene in which
she sings "Moanin' Low" in a
woozv tremolo in order to earn a
drink from Robinson is memo
rably bad. The cast also includes
Lauren Bacall, Lionel Barrvmore
and Thomas Gomez. John
Huston directed, with so much
energy that he successfully dis
guises some of the hokum in the
script that he and Richard Brooks
worked up (from a best-forgotten
plav by Maxwell Anderson).
Plavs through Wednesday with
The Big Sleep.

"... The Last Sup
per (is) perhaps the

The Last Supper (1978)
Zapata Lounge
Tomas Gutierrez Alea, the
Cuban filmmaker, made this
brilliant parable on the themes of
hypocrisy and betrayal. The pro
tagonist is a count (Nelson Vil
lagra, in a witty, subtle per
formance), owner of a sugar plan
tation in the late 18th century.
During taster Week, he stages a
Last Supper, casting himself as
Christ and inviting 12 slaves
chosen at random, whose feet he
washes and whose stomachs he
fills. When one of them, a failed
runaway recovering from the tor
ture he received on his return,
spits in the count's face, the count
strikes a pose of offended right
eousness and, likening the slave to
Judas Iscariot, recites solemnly,
"I washed you, but there is one
among you who is not vet clean."
Alea collaborated with Maria
Eugenia Hova and Tomas
Gonzalez on the script, and
Mario Garcia Jova's photogra
phy suggests, alternately, Italian
Renaissance frescoes and the
paintings of Rembrandt.
Plavs Thursday evening.
Little Women (1933) ★
Krege Auditorium
George Cukor filmed Louisa
May Alcott's story the same year
he made Dinner at Eight, and
though it has been given other
productions on film and tele
vision, this is easily the best. It is a
terrific example of how good the
Hollywood studio system could
be: what used to be called the
"production values" (i.e., art
direction and costumes) are ex
ecuted with great care, the nar
rative is reassuringly strong, and
the cast (except for insipid Jean
Parker as Beth) works together
beautifully. Joan Bennett is Amy,
Frances Dee is Meg, Spring By
ington is Marmee, Edna Mav Ol
iver is Aunt March, Douglass
Montgomery is Laurie, Paul
Lukas is Professor Baer, Henrv
Stephenson is Mr. Laurence, and,

in only her second vear in movies,
Katharine Hepburn plavs Jo.
You feel that Alcott must have
created Jo fully believing that one
day an actress just like Hepburn
would come along to plav her. No
one else could have brought such
heartbreaking intensity to the
scene in which Jo bemoans Meg's
being drawn awav from the fami
ly into a romance, or another in
which she rejects Laurie's pro
posal and then tells Marmee, "I
feel as if I'd stabbed my best
friend." It's a great performance,
and one of the few that truly
shows a character's ascension to
maturity.
