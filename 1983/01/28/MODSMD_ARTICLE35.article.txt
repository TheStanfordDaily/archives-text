Bay Area concert producer Bill
Graham charged "millionaire simple
tons" with trying to break into the con
cert business without any real experi
ence during his talk last night, spon
sored by Stanford Hillel.
"Half the agents in this business 1
would not acknowledge as human be
ings," he said. "This is the best sugges
tion I have if you want to get into the
business: get up early."
Graham, one of country's leading
entertainment producers, told about
100 audience members of his attempts
to stage concert on the University
campus. He has tried to get a permit to
use the stadium here "about once a
year for 1 7 years." he said.
"It has to go through the athletic de
partment. Enough said," he joked.
The producer said the Grateful Dead
would probably return to the Univer
sity. "What I would love to do." he
said, is hold a free concerts in the

stadium here with bands such as Jeffer
son Starship. Santana and the Dead.
"I've been asked to discuss the pre
rock-and-roll part of my life," Graham
told the audience, refering to his invita
tion to discuss "anecdotes from his
life."
Graham, born in Germany, fled to
the United States during World War 11.
He talked about his adventures in that
wai saying that although he wished to
discuss his life as a Jew during the
Holocaust, he did not have the per
sonal experience he felt necessary
The producer said he emigrated to
America with a group of Jewish or
phans when he was 11 years old. He
was adopted by a family in Long Island,
where he lived until he was drafted into
the army at age 19. In 1955, he came to
California to visit one of his sisters who
had survived the Holocaust, and "fell
in love with the Bay Area."
Graham came to live in California in
the early '60s. He held various jobs,
including one with the San Francisco


Bill Graham
Mime Company, for whom he staged a
benefit concern and was thus initiated
into the producing business.
"The first show I ever staged by my
self was at the Fillmore, with Jefferson
Airplane," Graham said. "I've been
going strong ever since." He empha
sized that working up from the bottom
was necessarv for success.
