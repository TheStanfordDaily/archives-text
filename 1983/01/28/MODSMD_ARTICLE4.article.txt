# Representing incorporation foes
## McCloskey urges East PA vote delay 
### JEFF BIDDULPH Senior Staff writer 
Former Rep. Paul "Peje" McCioskliy. approved
Tuesday by the ASSU Senate as a guest professor for
this spring, has made a seeming reversal in policies he
held as a congressman by asking that a vote on the
incorporation of East Palo Alto be postponed until
1984.
Many East Palo Alto residents who had been
strong supporters of the Republican congressman be
fore redisricting took him out of the area in 1981
were disillusioned by McCloskey's opposition to an
early vote on cityhood.
McCloseky, now a lawyer representing opponents
of the incorporation, submitted a 15-page memo to
San Mateo County officials Tuesday which recom
mends that the vote on cityhood be postponed be
cause the area does not the financial viability to be
come an independent city.
Despite McCloskey's memo, the San Mateo Coun
ty's Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO)
voted by a 3-2 margin Wednesday that the incorpora
tion vote should take place June 7, 1983.
Residents of East Palo Alto have been attempting
to incorporate for almost 20 years, and McCloskey
has had "an eminent record for being responsive to
the needs of the East Palo Alto community," accord
ing to Omowale Satterwhite, president of the Com
munity Development Institute. McCloskey said he
has supported cityhood for the area since 1976.
Satterwhite claimed that while in Congress
McCloskey had supported an early vote for cityhood.
He questioned McCloskey's sudden change in opin
ion, saying that McCloskey was hired to "represent
an interest" opposed to incorporation.
McCloskey was hired by a group composed primar
ily of homeowners in East Palo Alto living in the
more affluent area west of the Bayshorc freeway who
oppose incorporation because they fear their com
munity will become less desirable. The West of
Bayshore Committee for Annexation to Menlo Park
(WBCAMP) wants instead to becomc part of Menlo

Park.
McCloskevsaid he had not changed his view on the
question of cityhood for East Palo Alto, and that he
still felt that "it's not a question of incorporation —
it's a question of when."
McCloskey said incorporation is not viable now
because the city does not have its own tax base and
would be financially dependent on the county.
"It is my belief that they (East Palo Alto residents)
could face a disaster" if it becomes an independent
city, McCloskey said.

He said, for example, that the city would not have
the financial base to recover by itself if the San Fran
cisquito Creek near the city flooded. The creek
flooded in 1955 and 1 958, according to McCloskey.
Satterwhite called McCloskey's reasoning "speci
ous," and said that a city should not be stopped from
incorporation because of "unbudgeted events."
"His conclusions are not accurate," Satterwhite
said. 'The evidence demonstrates that East Palo Alto
has the fiscal viability to incorporate. If there is a
disaster the city will have to disincorporate and the
county will have to take care of the area."
Satterwhite also said that he saw no reason why
East Palo Alto should wait until 1984 to vote on
incorporation.
"We've been asked to wait for the last decade" for
incorporation, he said.
Both Satterwhite and McCloskey discounted racial
conflict as a cause for WBCAMP's opposition to
incorporation, despite the fact that the area west of
the Bayshore freeway is only 20 percent black and the
rest of East Palo Alto is mostly black.
"There are some rednecks in Atherton who said
that they don't want to be connected with the blacks,
but most people west of the Bayshore aren't con
cerned about that," McCloskey said.
East Palo Alto's struggle for incorporation
climaxed in April last year when a measure that
would have granted cityhood lost by 41 votes. Dis
tricts were determined by sanitation boundaries in
stead of city lines, however, and 1900 voters in East
Palo Alto were not allowed to cast ballots. 1300
Menlo Park voters were allowed to vote, and Satter
white said most of them voted against incorporation.
The ASSU Senate approved McCloskey on Tues
day despite the protests of members of the Jewish
community who had complained about what they
considered McCloskey's antisemitic remarks about
American Jews. Pending negotiations with the Guest
■Professorship Bureau, McCloskey will teach a politi
cal science course this spring tentatively titled The
Congressional Decisionmaking Process, 1964-1983.

Former Rep. Paul "Peje" McCioskliy. approved
Tuesday by the ASSU Senate as a guest professor for
this spring, has made a seeming reversal in policies he
held as a congressman by asking that a vote on the
incorporation of East Palo Alto be postponed until
1984.
Many East Palo Alto residents who had been
strong supporters of the Republican congressman be
fore redisricting took him out of the area in 1981
were disillusioned by McCloskey's opposition to an
early vote on cityhood.
McCloseky, now a lawyer representing opponents
of the incorporation, submitted a 15-page memo to
San Mateo County officials Tuesday which recom
mends that the vote on cityhood be postponed be
cause the area does not the financial viability to be
come an independent city.
Despite McCloskey's memo, the San Mateo Coun
ty's Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO)
voted by a 3-2 margin Wednesday that the incorpora
tion vote should take place June 7, 1983.
Residents of East Palo Alto have been attempting
to incorporate for almost 20 years, and McCloskey
has had "an eminent record for being responsive to
the needs of the East Palo Alto community," accord
ing to Omowale Satterwhite, president of the Com
munity Development Institute. McCloskey said he
has supported cityhood for the area since 1976.
Satterwhite claimed that while in Congress
McCloskey had supported an early vote for cityhood.
He questioned McCloskey's sudden change in opin
ion, saying that McCloskey was hired to "represent
an interest" opposed to incorporation.
McCloskey was hired by a group composed primar
ily of homeowners in East Palo Alto living in the
more affluent area west of the Bayshorc freeway who
oppose incorporation because they fear their com
munity will become less desirable. The West of
Bayshore Committee for Annexation to Menlo Park
(WBCAMP) wants instead to becomc part of Menlo

Park.
McCloskevsaid he had not changed his view on the
question of cityhood for East Palo Alto, and that he
still felt that "it's not a question of incorporation —
it's a question of when."
McCloskey said incorporation is not viable now
because the city does not have its own tax base and
would be financially dependent on the county.
"It is my belief that they (East Palo Alto residents)
could face a disaster" if it becomes an independent
city, McCloskey said.

He said, for example, that the city would not have
the financial base to recover by itself if the San Fran
cisquito Creek near the city flooded. The creek
flooded in 1955 and 1 958, according to McCloskey.
Satterwhite called McCloskey's reasoning "speci
ous," and said that a city should not be stopped from
incorporation because of "unbudgeted events."
"His conclusions are not accurate," Satterwhite
said. 'The evidence demonstrates that East Palo Alto
has the fiscal viability to incorporate. If there is a
disaster the city will have to disincorporate and the
county will have to take care of the area."
Satterwhite also said that he saw no reason why
East Palo Alto should wait until 1984 to vote on
incorporation.
"We've been asked to wait for the last decade" for
incorporation, he said.
Both Satterwhite and McCloskey discounted racial
conflict as a cause for WBCAMP's opposition to
incorporation, despite the fact that the area west of
the Bayshore freeway is only 20 percent black and the
rest of East Palo Alto is mostly black.
"There are some rednecks in Atherton who said
that they don't want to be connected with the blacks,
but most people west of the Bayshore aren't con
cerned about that," McCloskey said.
East Palo Alto's struggle for incorporation
climaxed in April last year when a measure that
would have granted cityhood lost by 41 votes. Dis
tricts were determined by sanitation boundaries in
stead of city lines, however, and 1900 voters in East
Palo Alto were not allowed to cast ballots. 1300
Menlo Park voters were allowed to vote, and Satter
white said most of them voted against incorporation.
The ASSU Senate approved McCloskey on Tues
day despite the protests of members of the Jewish
community who had complained about what they
considered McCloskey's antisemitic remarks about
American Jews. Pending negotiations with the Guest
■Professorship Bureau, McCloskey will teach a politi
cal science course this spring tentatively titled The
Congressional Decisionmaking Process, 1964-1983.
