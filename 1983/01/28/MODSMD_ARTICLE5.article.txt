# Kennedy soothes Stanford West critics
## 
### DAVID SANCHEZ Staff writer 
University President Donald Ken
nedy met with Menlo Park representa
tives today to discuss the city's con
cerns over the proposed Stanford West
housing project. Andy Doty, director
of community relations here, charac
terized the meeting as a "friendly ex
change of views."
City Councilwoman Peg Gunn. City
Manager Michael Bedwell and Di
rector of Community Development
Leon Pirofalo met this afternoon with
Kennedy and other University ad
ministrators. as well as with the board
of trustees to voice the city's apprehen
sion over the project's size and impact
on the city.
The Menlo Park City Council re
quested the meeting two weeks ago.
after city residents living near the de
velopment site compliancd that the
proposed project could urbanize their
neighborhood and reduce the amount
of open space.
Gunn said the city representatives
were well received at the meeting and
called the meeting "a good exchange.

Although no agreement was reached,
the University did promise to review
the city's case, she said.
"They (the city) presented their case
strongly and well." said Doty, "and
Stanford presented its case strongly
and well."
The City's main complaint is that the
proposed density for the project, which
would sit next to San Francisquito
Creek, is too high. Gunn noted that the
proposed density would be equal to
taking 11 percent of the Menlo Park
population and squeezing it into 46
acres. According to Gunn. this high
density woud create problems with
traffic, drainage and noise and sight
pollution.
Menlo Park has no jurisdiction in the
matter, however, because the project is
proposed for Palo Alto. The size and
scope of Stanford West will be deter
mined by the Palo Alto Planning
Commission and City Council, though
most of the residents effected by the
project live in Menlo Park.
Doty said the city's concerns "will be
entered into the final equation" and
that the University plans to figure in

the city's concerns as well as it can.
"We are caught between two
values," Doty said, "the values ex
pressed across the creek . . . and the
value for more housing in Palo Alto."
Asked whether she thought Ken
nedy had agreed to meet with the city
representatives solely for the sake of
promoting a good public image. Gunn
disagreed. She said she felt the Univer
sity representatives were "socially re
sponsible people."
The University originally proosed
building 1275 units on the 46 acres it
owns near the Children's Hospital.
However, the Palo Alto Planning
Commission decided last week to rec
ommend to the City Council that this
part of the project be reduced by al
most a fourth unless the University
agrees to provide more lower-cost
units and designate certain University
lands as open space.
Gunn said today that a density re
duced by this much "would be a very
good figure to arrive at " However.
Doty said the board of trustees strongly
opposes the notion of designating Uni

versity lands as permanent open space
gain city approval of a project.
Doty said the main benefit that woud
accrue to Menlo Park from the project
woud he a reduction in commuter traf
fic going through Menlo Park. He ex
plained that with more Stanford fac
ulty, staff and students living on cam
pus, fewer people will be going through
Menlo Park on their way to the Univer
sity.
Gunn said, however, that there is no
way of knowing whether people who
normally commute through Menlo
Park will in fact move into the new
housing project.
Although in the future one third of
the residents at Stanford West will not
be affiliated with the University, the
proposed housing will be primarily for
Stanford. Doty said. A system of
priorities will be followed whereby
priority will be given first to University
and Medical CcnUrr faculty and staff,
then to graduate students and post
doctoral fellows, and finally to persons
employed on University lands. Doty
said if there is any space left, it will be
available to others who want housing.

proposed housing will be primarily for
Stanford. Doty said. A system of
priorities will be followed whereby
priority will be given first to University

employed on University lands. Doty
said if there is any space left, it will be
available to others who want housing.
