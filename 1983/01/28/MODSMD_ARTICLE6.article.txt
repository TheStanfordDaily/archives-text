SEEM FAMILIAR?: Up
perclassmen and students na
tive to the area may re
member that there is another
side to the "Stanford Experi
ence," one that has nothing to
do with heavy rainfall and
electricity outages. There is
also spring quarter, a time of
sunshine and outdoor classes
such as Anthropology 91,
which is held in Jasper Ridge
Biological Preserve. Students
take the course to learn ar
chaeological field research
method and lab technique â€”
in addition to getting some
sunshine Saturday mornings.
