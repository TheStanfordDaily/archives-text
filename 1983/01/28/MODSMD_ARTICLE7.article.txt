# KZSU moves toward 'professionalism'
## 
### STEVE TOUTONGHI DAVID FANN 
KZSU, Stanford radio, until
recently has stayed away from
the limelight. However, the sta
tion's difficulty with the Com
mittee On Contemporary Enter
tainment (COCE) has been
much publicized of late. Despite
this controversy, the fact remains
that KZSU is still a radio station.
The station, found at 90.1 FM,
is entirely run by students, with
the exception of the post of chief
engineer, which is held by Stan
ford alumnus Mark Laurence.
KZSU offers current students
the opportunity to gain experi
ence in broadcasting as well as
the opportunity to entertain a di
verse audience.
This year's budget is approxi
mately $35,000, 80 percent of
which comes from the Universi
: ty's fee assessment system. Al-
L most 20 percent of the budget
comes from underwriting, but a
substantial portion of this is allo
cated to the sports department,
which is entirely self-sufficient
• financially. This year's budget, as
a result of last year's deficit and a
decrease in fee assessments, is 40
percent less than last year's.
Consequently, KZSU has
sought other alternatives to
make up for the budget cuts,
turning toward an expansion in
its underwriting efforts and
exploring the possibility of spon
soring concerts for the Stanford
community.
"We need the money," said
station manager, Jim Mooney,
"Concerts are a natural out
growth for KZSU."
To boost their effort to find
new sources of money, the sta
tion has hired their financial di
rector from outside station ranks
for the first time in its history.
Financial director Andy Midler

holds one of two paid positions at
KZSU. A senior, he has had ex
tensive experience with ASSU
and hopes to apply his knowl
edge of the University's financial
system and an increased empha
sis on underwriting in an effort to
save the station from a financial
situation like last year's. "I re
fuse to be under a deficit this
year," Midler said.
"Most of the people in the fi
nancial department right now
are people who are working on
the air and are also interested in
what's going on down here," said
Mooney. Most of the people cur

department do not have a great
deal of prior experience and
there is opportunity for people
who are looking for practical ex
perience in business, particularly
underwriting.
Even with the financial dif
ficulties, KZSU has maintained a
full schedule of programming.
D.J.s are allowed a wide latitude
with their shows, which are gen
erally four hours long and fit into
a larger schedule devised by
Ralph Greene, programming di
rector at KZSU.
"You have to do what the stu
dents who come down here want
to do. We can't tell someone who
comes down here 'hey, you're

gonna do jazz,"' said Mooney.
This has led to a very diverse
schedule which has been
criticized for inconsistancy. But
the station is not trying to please
all the pt.'jple all of the time." At
some point during the week we
have something that everyone
would want to hear," said
Mooney.
KZSU also publishes a weekly
schedule of programs to inform
its listeners of what is on. The
station's programming, in gen
eral terms, offers jazz in the
mornings, mellow rock and jazz
in the late mornings and after
noon, new wave and rock in the
evenings and assorted genres on
weekends.
Local and international news
are presented in small segments
at various times of the day. Pub
lic Affairs, the educational
branch has one half to one hour
of air time each day.
For organizational purposes
KZSU is divided into several de
partments: news, public affairs,
traffic, programming, sports,
business and music, and the sta
tion is staffed by over 100 stu
dent volunteers. News, public af
fairs and the station's other de
partments that do not deal di
rectly with the D.J.s are easier to
become involved with and each
quarter spent working for the
station helps one accumulate
points under a system instituted
winter quarter.
The new system is designed to
give people who have worked for
the station in other capacities an
advantage when applying for a
position as D.J. and is part of
what Mooney sees as an overall
improvement in the level of
competency to be found at the
station.
Mooney feels that four years
ago when he started at KZSU it

had a reputation for being irres
ponsible but over the years the
station has been " moving to
ward professionalism. The Uni
versity expects more and we ex
pect more of ourselves."
Though KZSU's license is
held by the University, the sta
tion is still independent, with its
only non-staff guidance coming
from the recently established
Board of Directors who are ap
pointed by University President
Don Kennedy. Their duty is to
oversee the general policy of the
station to insure that it remains
within the guidelines for non
commercial stations.
Information about quarterly
organizational meetings is
posted at the beginning of each
quarter and a good time to con
tact the staff at the station is at
lunch.

full schedule of programming.
D.J.s are allowed a wide latitude
with their shows, which are gen
erally four hours long and fit into
a larger schedule devised by
Ralph Greene, programming di
rector at KZSU.
"You have to do what the stu
dents who come down here want
to do. We can't tell someone who
comes down here 'hey, you're

gonna do jazz,"' said Mooney.
This has led to a very diverse
schedule which has been
criticized for inconsistancy. But
the station is not trying to please
all the pt.'jple all of the time." At
some point during the week we
have something that everyone
would want to hear," said
Mooney.
KZSU also publishes a weekly
schedule of programs to inform
its listeners of what is on. The
station's programming, in gen
eral terms, offers jazz in the
mornings, mellow rock and jazz
in the late mornings and after
noon, new wave and rock in the
evenings and assorted genres on
weekends.
Local and international news
are presented in small segments
at various times of the day. Pub
lic Affairs, the educational
branch has one half to one hour
of air time each day.
For organizational purposes
KZSU is divided into several de
partments: news, public affairs,
traffic, programming, sports,
business and music, and the sta
tion is staffed by over 100 stu
dent volunteers. News, public af
fairs and the station's other de
partments that do not deal di
rectly with the D.J.s are easier to
become involved with and each
quarter spent working for the
station helps one accumulate
points under a system instituted
winter quarter.
The new system is designed to
give people who have worked for
the station in other capacities an
advantage when applying for a
position as D.J. and is part of
what Mooney sees as an overall
improvement in the level of
competency to be found at the
station.
Mooney feels that four years
ago when he started at KZSU it

had a reputation for being irres
ponsible but over the years the
station has been " moving to
ward professionalism. The Uni
versity expects more and we ex
pect more of ourselves."
Though KZSU's license is
held by the University, the sta
tion is still independent, with its
only non-staff guidance coming
from the recently established
Board of Directors who are ap
pointed by University President
Don Kennedy. Their duty is to
oversee the general policy of the
station to insure that it remains
within the guidelines for non
commercial stations.
Information about quarterly
organizational meetings is
posted at the beginning of each
quarter and a good time to con
tact the staff at the station is at
lunch.

ON THE AIR: Jose Hernandez, a disc jockey for KZSU's Hispanicprogram Voz De La Gente,
reaches to set controls at his station. Voz De La Gente is one ofKZSU's attempts to deal with the
problem of programming for the diverse Stanford audience. In addition to the preferences of
the audience, the station must also work around the likes and dislikes of its announcers.
KZSU, Stanford radio, until
recently has stayed away from
the limelight. However, the sta
tion's difficulty with the Com
mittee On Contemporary Enter
tainment (COCE) has been
much publicized of late. Despite
this controversy, the fact remains
that KZSU is still a radio station.
The station, found at 90.1 FM,
is entirely run by students, with
the exception of the post of chief
engineer, which is held by Stan
ford alumnus Mark Laurence.
KZSU offers current students
the opportunity to gain experi
ence in broadcasting as well as
the opportunity to entertain a di
verse audience.
This year's budget is approxi
mately $35,000, 80 percent of
which comes from the Universi
: ty's fee assessment system. Al-
L most 20 percent of the budget
comes from underwriting, but a
substantial portion of this is allo
cated to the sports department,
which is entirely self-sufficient
• financially. This year's budget, as
a result of last year's deficit and a
decrease in fee assessments, is 40
percent less than last year's.
Consequently, KZSU has
sought other alternatives to
make up for the budget cuts,
turning toward an expansion in
its underwriting efforts and
exploring the possibility of spon
soring concerts for the Stanford
community.
"We need the money," said
station manager, Jim Mooney,
"Concerts are a natural out
growth for KZSU."
To boost their effort to find
new sources of money, the sta
tion has hired their financial di
rector from outside station ranks
for the first time in its history.
Financial director Andy Midler

and hopes to apply his knowl
edge of the University's financial
system and an increased empha
sis on underwriting in an effort to
save the station from a financial
situation like last year's. "I re
fuse to be under a deficit this
year," Midler said.
