## The 						Stanford Daily Editor's farewell 
### 
Ours is an amazing time. We have inherited
institutions and ideals of education undergoing in
credible pressure to change: from economic
pressures upon administrators and students, from
changing demands upon scholarship and from the
university's meshing with nearly every other aspect
of our society. Universities, particularly this uni
versity, confront challenges affecting our vision of
government, business, education and the role of
scholars in their community. It is we who have a
hand in these changes, who leave institutions and
decisions for others to inherit.
For its staff members and readers, the Daily is
part of those transformations. In its small way, the
newspaper succeeds when by informing or chal
lenging it lifts people from a timeless present and
thrusts them into great changes about us. When the
newspaper allows communion with a vital past to
engage the thoughts and passions of a living pre
sent in shaping consciously a common future, it
marks success.
I have met no group of students who engage
themselves in their world more than do Daily staff
members. I am still astonished that so many people
spend so much of their Stanford lives striving to
bring you a better understanding of your world —
by informing you of issues you might shape, of
what present you confront and of their and others'
ideas of what our future mignt b^
For this effort, for this thought, I thank you, my
colleagues. You should be proud, for you largely
succeed in your task. Av an outgoing editor, I
appreciate your allowing and helping me to contri
bute my thought and my time through the Daily. I
cannot thank enough Ron Lillejord and Sam
Howe, for introducing me to the issues and poten
tial of journalism, Jan Mireles and Heather Millar,
for their thoughtful dedication, Doug Jehl and
Adam Goodman, for exploring the assumptions
and consequences of our work, and especially Ann

Southworth, for her intelligence and uncanny in
sight.
Frustration matches challenge at the Daily. and
both are great. Newspapers are charged with tasks
too great: presenting the right snippets of the
world, as completely as possible — much less
suggesting their significance and outlining forces
that not even hindsight will reveal — can always be
accomplished much, much better. Yet the readi
ness is all: we have chosen to participate, and strive
to meet our responsibilities.
Each day you see our successes and failures.
What appears on these pages are honest attempts
by honest people to fulfill their ideals. In finances
and experience, the Daily is a sound organization,
and an enthusiastic advertising and editorial crowd
readies to continue the improvement in coverage
and education I have witnessed during my years
here.
This is an exciting time for journalism, too. A
newspaper speaks to an undefined audience with
an uncertain intent. Its print affects decisions with
out understanding what forms decisions, accords
importance through the slippery term "news"
without clear definitions of what is important, and
attempts to inform without full information. But
the great challenge becomes making each decision
as explicit and self-conscious as possible.
The crucial task remains carving out our bit of
the present with as great an understanding of the
past and challenges of the future as we can bring to
the printed word. Whether this attempt comes
through a news article, an entertainment review or,
my favorite, the editorial, that goal continues. To
the extent we conduct this exploration with intelli
gence and dignity, we succeed.
