## The 						Stanford Daily Editor's note Gearing up for spring season 
### 
It's difficult to express my feelings about the
Daily without sounding corny, but the new
editor traditionally writes an introduction for
the first issue of the new volume, so I'll give it a
try.
I've had some of the best moments of my life
in the less-than-plush Daily office, thanks to the
talented, sincere people who inhabit it.
Former editor Sam Howe said, "The Daily was
my varsity sport." And many Daily staffers, like
athletes here, put out an incredible effort of
time and energy each day.
I hope that all Daily staffers gain as much from
the Daily as they put in. The Daily tries to edu
cate and train its staff members in addition to
providing fair, comprehensive coverage of the
University community. The change of staff
duties twice a year is part of the continuing
process of improving the Daily, an indepen
dent, non-profit corporation.
Our goal, of course, is to provide accurate,
aggressive,professional coverage of the com
munity.
Previous volumes have provided us with a
strong foundation — and tough acts to follow.
But I have confidence in the abilities of this new
staff, and in my opinion (admittedly biased), it's
the best ever.
All editors undoubtedly enter with idealism
and enthusiasm, only to find that not
ever\ thing can be perfect.
We aren't proposing any changes that will
make you think vou've picked up the wrong

paper in the morning. But we do want to make
some graphic changes that will — hopefully —
make the paper easier to read, and at the same
time provide a forum for the many creative stu
dents here.
We want to stimulate discussion, as well, con
tinuing to run thought-provoking editorials in
this space each day. We hope you will contri
bute to this page as well. The Daily is your
newspaper, and yet, we receive amazingly few
letters to the editor.
We also hope to make our deadlines so you
can read the Daily at breakfast rather than at
lunch.
Internally, we will increase the individual at
tention given to new staffers, fulfilling our edu
cational role and training top-notch journalists
for tuture volumes. We will reinstate the sci
ence and environment pages to provide in
creased depth to our coverage.
Write us, call us, let us know if you see a story
in the making — we need your ideas and con
tributions.
On this day of the first paper, I am looking
forward to the privilege of working with an im
mensely talented, dedicated staff, and of get
ting little sleep during the next five months.
P.S. Please recycle your Daily - unless you're
saving it'
