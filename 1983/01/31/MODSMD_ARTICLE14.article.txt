## God and man: an agnostic's view 
### 
It is frequently argued that God
cannot be known by rational means.
Both religious and non-religious
thinkers revert to the mystical expe
rience, of one form or another, to
know and believe in Cod. It is quite
clear that, if anything, the existence
of Cod is an article of faith. For the
believer the "experience" of God is
so overwhelming that there is no
room for questions or doubts. I am
not trying to "convert" anyone. But
the idea of God has permeated and
influenced human behaviour to
great extents, and that is what I'd like
to refer to.
But since the mystical experience
seems to be so important, I'd like to
say something about it first. Faith is
supposed to be supra-rational, a way
of knowing superior to any other
form of understanding known to
human beings. Unfortunately, noth
ing very logical can be said about this
form ot epistemology; we have to
have faith that faith is a superior
method.
Besides that, the mystical experi
ence means something different to
each one. One cannot help but think
that either the "experience" is an
imagined one, or that there are many
gods, each manifesting itself
differently. And before I am accused
of being incapable of the experience,
why would God want to be so dif
tic ult to be discovered by some of us.
He could have prevented that.
Nevertheless, one should not con
fuse mysticism and aesthetics. It's
quite true that we can be touched by
the beauty of nature and be moved
by the music of Bach, Dvorak and
Beethoven. One can admire with
emotion the paintings of Monet and

Renoir, and so on. But the concep
tions of what is beautiful differ
among ourselves, which should be
an indication that this type of emo
tion as all others is a cultural acquisi
tion, a learned skill.
And one should not stop with aes
thetics. After all one should admire
human ingenuity in all its forms, as
well as that of other forms of life. As a
species we have had many achieve
ments. But it is "unfair" to credit God
for all these good things and, at the
same time, clear him of any respon
sibility for our wrongdoings.
Since it was mentioned by "my cri
tics," to those that marvel at the
"miracle of life" I'd like to remind
that "miracles" are only historical
(i.e. temporary) definitions for
phenomena that we haven't man
aged to explain. I would suggest that
we should be more modest and ac
cept our ignorance more willingly.
The idea of God has helped human
societies in numerous ways. It has
unified peoples, creating a certain
sort of solidarity. It has served as a
tool for the imposition of laws and
provided an effective threat for the
compliance with them. Fven in the
"modern" judiciary system of this
country one finds Bibles in the court
rooms. God has served as an inspira
tion to poets, composers and pain
ters, and he has guided" some
politicians, and social reformers.
But one woud have to be blind not
to see that we have religious wars:
one God fighting another, both of
them equally just and almighty. God
has also helped the Inquisition, the

Crusades, slavery and Khomeini, to
name only a few of the "holy"
causes. God has been used to tell
women to remain virgins for mar
riage, and to discriminate against
them, to prohibit divorce, and to en
gage in racist practices.
I realize how comfortable it must
be to have a Cod so compassionate
that he has nochoice but forgiving us
everything. But the danger involved
in this type of belief is quite obvious:
it does not matter what we do down
here, we'll be sharing heaven with St.
Thomas, Hitler and R. Hess.
Of course, Cod is not to blame.
The responsibilities for all the at
rocities that we, as a species, are cap
able of committing, rests on ourse
lves. Even the splitting of the atom is
our doing and, consequently, the
privileges and dangers that come
with it. Instead of praying, we'd bet
ter start thinking what we want our
future to be.
It is quite clear that the idea of God
has been used to promote and justify
both good and evil. It has also pro
vided us with a route of escape from
the hard work of finding intelligent
and workable solutions to the prob
lems that we face, most of which are
man-made. As a result, the problems
remain alive.
I write from an agnostic position.
The problem of the existence of
something God-like is, to my under
standing, beyond our epistemologi
cal capabilities. It is the use and mis
use of the belief in God that bothers
me, particularly when it is used to
justify our passive response to acts of
injustice, or to commit such an act.
