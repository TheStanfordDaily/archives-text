## AAP copyright rules restrict education process 
### 
Congratulations on addressing the issues in
volved in the lawsuit recently brought against
New York University (NYU) by the American As
sociation of Publishers (AAP). I would, however,
like to correct a misconception which appeared
in an article by senior staff writer David Azrin
("Classroom copying challenged," Daily, Jan.
'4). He reported that the manager of Kinko's
< opies in Palo Alto, Bob VanDeWeerd, follows
AAP guidelines for judging whether copying a
portion of a copyrighted work for educational
purposes is fair use.
This is inaccurate. All Kinko's Copies maintain
standards for this type of copying separate from
those suggested in the AAP's guidelines. Our
standards for c opying from portions of copyrigh
ted material are patterned after four sections of
the fair use provisions of the copyright law. The
AAP's guidelines are based on how they would
like to see the law altered.
We believe the guidelines proposed by the
NAP are too restrictive (particularly with respect
to multiple < opying in < lassroom situations at the
university and graduate school levels). The fair
use lav\ was intentionally designed without any
numerical boundaries to benefit the public's
interests and to promote education.
I he AAP is, in my opinion, unjustly characteriz
ing fair use of copyrighted materials as "piracy"
and is seeking, by issuance of their guidelines
.ind b> instituting their present suit against NYU,
to prevent the public from engaging in activities
whu h the law permits.
It is distressing to see that the AAP's publicity
campaign has had a chilling effect on the
at ademic < ommunity. An example of this c an be
found in .1 quote in the artu le by Stanford Assoc.
Prof. Carolyn lougee of the History Dept., who
expressed that she now feels no copying is per
mitted unless the material is in the public do

main. There is a specific provision in the law
which allows educators to make multiple copies
of portions of copyrighted materials for class
room use. This is the law!
I believe the copyright law as it now stands
already achieves the proper balance between the
interests of copyright holders and the needs of
the public, including educators.

Korematsu's revenge
In 1944 the U.S. Supreme Court decided one of
the most painfully difficult cases in its history.
One Fred Korematsu, an American citizen, stood
accused of being Japanese-descended and un
willing to enter a World War II internment camp.
On one side of the issue was the timeless ques
tion of equal justice and due process under law
for all Americans; on the other side was the war
fueled clamor to take revenge on japanese-
Americans.
The Supreme Court, in a bitterly divided opin
ion, upheld Korematsu's conviction and con
signed him to a concentration camp, thus placing
its seal of approval on this infamous wartime
program. The decision was not unanimous, as
stated. Three of the nine justices dared to speak
out against the wartime hysteria and excoriate
this tlagrant violation of all Americans' constitu
tional rights.
lustice I rank Murphy concluded his impas
sioned opinion by dec Taring: "I dissent therefore
trom this legalization of racism." Justice Robert
Jackson declared: A military commander may
overstep the bounds of constitutionality, and it is

an incident. But if we review and approve, that
passing incident becomes the doctrine of the
Constitution. There it has a generative power of
its own, and all thai it creates will be in its own
image."
lackson's fears were realized, as the Supreme
Court did "review and approve," stating essen
tially that in wartime the opinions of the generals
supersede those of the highest court of the land.
For 39 years now, this decision, Korematsu v.
United States, has remained on the law books
like an ugly blot â€” the most notoriously bad,
even infamous, Supreme Court precedent still
standing. And because it has never been over
ruled, it is still, incredibly, valid law. But now,
according to recent news reports, Fred
Korematsu, still alive and well in San Leandro,
Ca, is suing in Federal court to overturn his 40-
year-old conviction.
Korematsu claims the U.S. government lied in
order to "prove" he posed a threat to the na
tional security. He is almost certainly right, for
historical records yield no evidence whatsoever
during all of World War II that even a single
lapanese-American conspired against the gov
ernment to do anything.
If the rule of law had prevailed during those
war-hysteria years, the government would have
been unable to muster sufficient probable cause
for one single warrent of arrest for one single
lapanese-American, far less enough evidence to
incarcerate thousands of people for four years.
More power to Fred Korematsu. May he win his
case, and may the Supreme Court have an oppor
tunity to redeem itself as the guarantor of justice
under law by wiping off the precedent-books
one of the worst decisions it ever handed down.
