## Coping with life after Stanford 
### 
There is something unique about
leaving Stanford which most of us
never think about until we encounter
it. When we go home on vacations
we rarely have enough time to read
just to our old surroundings. We say
to ourselves, "maybe if I lived here
again I could meet more people and I
wouldn't be so bored when I go
home for more than a week." We
may pass by the high school hang
outs, but we rarely go in. We tend to
spend more time with our families
and a few old friends than touring
around the city.
Nevertheless, there is a feeling
that creeps up like a shadow upon
those who go back home after col
lege. The surroundings look the
same, but we cease to consider the
pizza joint the vital part of our

The fact is, Stanford has provided us with an
education, and in doing so has helped to isolate us
from those in our home town or countries. The
immersion into new sets of ideas and ideologies is an
experience which not everyone in the world has the
fortune to go through.

weekends. Our family is still impor
tant, but it can no longer be the core
of our activities, all of which used to
have to be reported to mom. Even
our little brothers and sisters are no
longer little.
This new feeling is what comes
from our inability to adjust to a way of
life which may have ceased to be our
way of life. Is the feeling due to
maturity? In part it is, but it's not all
due to having grown up a little. The
feeling is more inclined to be part of
our growing independence from the
place from which we came. It is also a
result of the changes that we have
undergone during our college expe
rience.

Have you ever wondered why
Stanford is sometimes referred to as
"The Farm?" Did you ever think that
maybe it has something to do with
the fact that most traditional farms
are usually away from urban areas,
apart from the general population,
and that farmers tend to have a spe
cial way of life? Well, think of your
self as a farmer. Students, for genera
tions, have had a way of life which
reflects their independence.
Whether you are from Wichita or
from Chagrin Falls makes no
difference. As a student you tend to
feel that what you do is essentially
right; after all, it's certainly no one
else's business. So, if you don't feel
like doing laundry this month, it's
your privilege to abstain from doing
so.

But what happens when you go
home, not just for a couple of days,
but for an undefined period of time
after graduation? Most people will
readily adapt to having mom wash
their clothes. But will we be able to
be as willing to adapt to daily family
living in a community very different
from Manzanita Park and Stern Hall?
If you are like some people, you
will feel funny telling Mom that you
are going over to a friend's house
and that you don't expect to be back
till late . . . very late . . . perhaps to
morrow morning. And so, the central
questions seem to be how to re
adapt to family living, and how to fit
into a place which we have outgrown

culturally? (Obviously if you arefrom
New York and you have this problem
you also have some other problems.
The feeling that has been de
scribed is particularly acute in
foreign students. If you think some
one from Wichita might have prob
lems understanding your DNA re
search on rabbits, how doyou think a
student from Pakistan or Guatemala
would explain his late night at LOTS?
Will his friends be able to relate to his
experience? The fact is, Stanford has
provided us with an education, and
in doing so has helped to isolate us
from those in our home town or
countries. The immersion into new
sets of ideas and ideologies is an ex
perience which not everyone in the
world has the fortune to go through.
If given the choice, wouldn't you
rather talk to dorm companions here
than fellow home-towners?
Yes, Virginia, this is cultural shock
for you (and you don't even have to
leave the country to experience it).
The personal change, for better or
for worse, that we undergo while we
are in college may be something
which we understand. They may also
be something which those around us
cannot understand because their ex
periences have not yielded the same
outlooks . . . the same scope.
If you don't believe a word I've
said, go to Gilroy one of these day's
and try talking to someone about
your roommate problems, about
how great it was to move from Man
zanita to the new Suites, and about
how one can get easily tired of food
service? Clearly our experience has
been unique, because we are in a
unique place. The Farm will bring us
great memories. We will never forget
that we were once "farmers." But
will we let those around us forget it?
Will we continue to isolate ourselves
from others by living in a memory?
