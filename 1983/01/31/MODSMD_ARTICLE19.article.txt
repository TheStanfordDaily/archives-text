## WSU at 7-0 in Pac-10, rolls past Stanford 67-63 
### MARK ZEIGLER 
Pullman, Wash. â€” Stanford
was supposed to lose to
George Raveling and his Wash
ington State Cougars Saturday
night. All odds pointed to it.
The Cardinal had not de
feated WSU in Pullman in the
past seven seasons. The
Cougars had also won 11
straight games as well as their
last 11 at home. They were 6-0
and tied for first in the Pacific
-10 Conference, 14-2 overall
and ranked nationally. Plainly
and simply, Stanford coach
Tom Davis and the Card were
not supposed to win.
They didn't.
WSU overcame an early
Stanford lead with perimeter
shooting and held on for a
67-63 victory before 7113 vocal
and partisan fans.
"That's a nice team," Davis
said. "They play just well
enough to win."
Winning however, did not
come quite as easy as Raveling
might have wanted. WSU first

had to rebound from a 12-2 def
icit and then, once it had the
lead, hold off a Stanford team
that refused to roll over and
die.
"We haven't played anybody
this year who works harder or
plays to their ability better than
Stanford," Raveling said.
"They are well-coached. Davis
does a magnificent job."
Neither team played with its
top scorer and rebounder.
Stanford's John Revelli sat on
the bench in a uniform of
slacks and a sweater. WSU's
Guy Williams, who underwent
surgery on his left knee earlier
in the week, was on crutches.
Cougar players wore wrist
bands with Williams' number
(3) on them and had dedicated
the remainder of the season to
him.
Although WSU led by 10
points four times in the second
half and by nine as late as the
4:28 mark, Stanford still had a
realistic shot at an upset with
three minutes left.

A Hans Wichary 12-footer,
followed by a five-second in
bound violation on Washing
ton State and a Steve Brown
20-foot jump shot, cut the
Cougar lead to 61 -56.
After a pair of Steve Harriel
free throws for WSU with 2:12
left, Cougar 6-foot-6 guard
Craig Ehlo picked Brown clean,
coming up with a crucial steal.
Less than a minute later,
Wichary was forced to foul
WSU forward Mike Wurm to
stop the clock. Wurm con
nected on both ends of the
one-and-one and WSU led
65-56 with 1:08 remaining.
Keith (ones and Wichary
picked up the slack in the ab
sence of Revelli, scoring 17 and
14 points, respectively.
Wichary's 11 rebounds were
tops for both teams.
WSU's Chris Winkler kept
the Cougars in front through
out the second half with long
range corner jumpers over the
Cardinal zone. He tallied 12 of

STEPPING IN: Stanford's Hans Wichary scored 14 points and grabbed a season-high 11
rebounds in the Cardinal's 67-63 Pacific-10 Conference basketball loss to Washington State
Saturday night in Pullman, Wash. Wichary started at center in place of an injured John
Revelli.
his 16 points after intermission,
hitting on five-of-eight second
half shots.
A third Cougar in double fig
ures was Ehlo (11 points), who
had a miserable shooting
night, hitting on just four-of-11
field goal attempts, but a spec
tacular one passing as he dis
hed out nine assists.
"I think it's (WSU) a team in
every sense of the word,"
Davis said. "They deserve to be
nationally-ranked. They're re
ally an experienced ball club,
and more often than not, were
in control."
One time WSU was not in
control was the opening min
utes of the game. The Cardinal
began in exactly the opposite
fashion they did Thursday
night against Washington,
when Stanford fell behind 17-3.
Although it took just four
seconds and two passes for the
Cougars to score their first
hoop, they did not connect

again until nearly four minutes
later. Iri the meantime, Stan
ford ran off 12 unanswered
points, and, with 14:43 left in
the first half, led 14-4.
But before the Card knew
what hit them, WSU had
exploded for eight points in 64
seconds and trailed by only
two.
A minute later, WSU erupted
again for eight points, this time
in 1:25, and went in front 20-18.
The spree included an alley
oop one-handed slam dunk by
sophomore forward Bryan Pol
lard. Although just 6-5, Pollard
has a 43-inch vertical leap, a
skill he demonstrated in the
second half in the form of a
flying dunk tip-in over three
Stanford defenders.
The Cardinal went in front
for the last time on a pair of Earl
Koberlein free throws at the
7:59 mark of the opening
period. A six-point spurt in less
than a minute gave WSU the
lead for good, however.
