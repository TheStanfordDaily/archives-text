# SLAC anticipates collider construction

With the discovery of the subatomic W particle
in Europe, physicists at the Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center (SLAC) are increasingly anxious
for the construction of the Stanford Linear Col
lider (SI C i, which they plan to use to search for a
related subatomic particle.
A representative from CERN, the European
Organization tor Particle Physics, presented evi
dence of the discovery before SLAC scientists
Friday afternoon.
Three subatomic particles are believed to carry
the so-called "weak force," one of the funda
mental forces in nature. The CERN laboratories
produced two of the three types: positively
charged and negatively-charged W particles.
The third type, the Z-naught, was not dis
covered SLAC teams hope to produce the
Z-naught using the linear collider, designed by
Prof. Burton Richter, technical director of SLAC.
it is quite possible that the CERN laboratories
will lie able to produce a few Z-naughts," said
Sidney Drell deputy director of SLAC. "How
ever, the goals at SLAC remain the same: to pro

duce copiously the Z-naught and study in detail
its properties." The SLC will be able to produce
Z-naught particles at a rate of thousands per day.
In reaction to the discovery, Robert Hol
lebeek, a member of one of the research groups
currently designing the first experiment to be
done using SLC, said that U.S. physicists are dis
appointed that a lack of funding for U.S. labs
prevents the U.S. from gaining any major leads in
particle physics. Nevertheless, this disappoint
ment is overshadowed by the excitement of the
find and its significance, he added.
The existence of the Wand Z-naught particles
is predicted by a theory that unifies two funda
mental forces the weak — responsible for beta
decay, a common form of radioactivity — and the
electromagnetic, to result in an electroweak
force." This in turn supports a Grand Unification
Theory which postulates that all of nature's basic
forces are derived from one force.
"It is only within the last ten years that the
theories have been refined enough to predict the
particles' existence," said William Ash, a
member of the research staff at SLAC. "Thus the

discovery that the W particles do indeed exist is a
solid indication that the theories are going in the
right direction."
The CERN experiments involved the produc
tion of collisions between beams of protons and
anti-protons revolving in a ring structure four
miles in circumference. At CERN laboratories,
540 billion electron volts were produced in colli
sion. It was the first time enough interaction en
ergy was created to produce the W particle.
From the millions of collision "events
studied, only five offer clear evidence for the W
particle. Interference from other particles
created in collision often confuse the results.
Scientists at SLAC will use the linear collider to
induce collisions between electrons and posit
rons. Such collisions will produce less scatter
and will permit a closer and more detailed study
of the weak force-bearing particles, said Drell.
CERN plans to construct a new ring structure
that will also study collisions between electrons
and positrons. Called LEP (Large Electron-
Positron), the collider is expec ted to cost more
than $500 million.
