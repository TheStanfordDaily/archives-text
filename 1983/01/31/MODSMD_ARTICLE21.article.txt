# Women swimmers splash USC, UCLA

### SHAILENDRA BHUMRALKAR 
The Stanford's women's
swimming team simply
overpowered its southern
rivals this weekend as the
Cardinal demolished UCLA
100-40, and highly-rated
USC 109-40.
On Friday, Stanford faced
UCLA, which was missing its

best freestyler, Julie Wil
liams. But even if Williams
had been at the meet, it
would not have made any
difference in the final out
come. Stanford swam well
and met many NCAA qual
ifying time standards.
The 200 medley relay
team opened the meet by
qualifying with a time of
1:47.47. Marybeth
Linzmeier swam her best
200 freestyle of the year and
qualified with a 1:50.75. Kim
Carlisle accomplished the

same feat in the 100
backstroke in 57.47. Kathy
Smith also qualified in the
50 breaststroke in 30.23.
Both Patty Gavin and
Jenny Rapp qualified in the
200 IM with times of 2:05.23
and 2:06.09, respectively.
Diana Zock swam a lifetime
best 4:54.90 in the 500 frees-

tyle, but narrowly missed
the qualifying time.
Coach George Haines
was understandably
pleased with the effort. He
singled out Linzmeier,
Smith, Zock and Carlisle as
having the better swims of
the day.
Stanford also captured
the diving events. Tori
Pulskamp won in the one
meter event while Jean
Meyer won the three meter
board. Coach Rick
Schavone praised both

Pulskamp and Meyer and
was happy that the Card was
able to handily defeat its top
competitor on the West
Coast.
Both Haines and his USC
counterpart expected a
close meet on Saturday, but
Stanford's depth was just
too much for the talented

Trojans. This time, just
about everyone met NCAA
time standards.
The 200 medley relay
team opened the meet on a
good note for the Card in a
race that Haines said set the
momentum in Stanford's
favor. The team bettered its
previous effort by setting a
deGuerre pool record of
1:44.03.
Linzmeier and Sherri
Hanna qualified in the 1000
freestyle with clockings of
9:45.83 and 9:48.08 respec

tively. Smith qualified in the
100 breaststroke in 1:03.35.
All four Stanford entrants in
the 400 IM — Gavin, Anne
Tweedy, Rapp and Lisa
Haven — met the NCAA
time standard.
The diving events went
equally well. Meyer won
both boards. Teammate Kim

Jones took second in the
one meter and third in the
three meter.
Haines was overjoyed
with the result. "We just
swam great," he said. He
did not want to single out
any one swimmer since
everyone did well. "They all
did their part."
The Cardinal women will
travel to the University of
Texas next weekend for a
showdown between two of
the top teams in the coun
try.
