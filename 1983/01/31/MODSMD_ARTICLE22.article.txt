# Barnes wins all-around at Berkeley
## 
### SARAH CARREL 
Although the Stanford
women gymnastics team
placed only third in Saturday
night's Berkeley Invitational at
C al, the meet was one of the
season's best for individual
performances.
The University of Washing
ton won the meet with a score
of 174.70, while Cal was second
with 173.45. Stanford tallied
172.20, and fourth place Long
Beach followed with 168.95.
The closeness of the top three
scores shows just how com
petitive the meet was.
The Cardinal's own Angie
Barnes won all-around honors
with a top score of 35.85 out of
a possible 40. Barnes also
walked away with a first place
in the uneven parallel bars, and
a tie for first in the floor exer
cise with Cal's Polly Rogers.
The versatile sophomore was
fourth in the balance beam
with a strong 9.10. Barnes' flex
ibility in this event usually
permits her to finish near the
top, and her performances are
real crowd pleasers.
Last spring, Barnes took a
break from gymnastics to study
at Stanford's overseas campus
in Vienna. Her strong com
eback this year exemplifies her
hard work. "It's only going to
get better for Angie," said
Stanford coach Homer Sar
dina. "She's on a roll now."
Another bright individual
performance came with Kim
Strauss' 9.20 in the beam. Al
though Strauss fell once, she
was able to score well because
of the aggressiveness and orig
inality with which she ap
proaches this event. An exam
ple is her forward walkover on
her elbows, which she just in
corporated into the routine.
The great misfortune of the
meet was freshman Pam
Blom's injury in the floor exer
cise. She strained a knee while
landing off a double twisting
somersault, preventing her
from competing in the remain
der of the meet.
