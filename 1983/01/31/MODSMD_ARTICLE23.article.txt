Pasadena — The Washington Redskins rode
lohn Riggins' record-breaking 166 yards rushing
yesterday to their first National Football League
championship in 40years, finishing off this mag
ical season by overpowering the Miami Dol
phins, 27-17, in Super Bowl XVII.
Moving behind the Hogs, his surging offen
sive linemen, Riggins was magnificent, scoring
the winning touchdown on a 43-yard run in the
tourth quarter. Carrying a Super Bowl record 38
times, he disrupted Miami's No. 1-rated defense
with his relentless runs, rallying the Redskins
from a 17-10 halftime deficit to only their third
NFL title in history.
"I'm very happy," Riggins said "At least for
tonight. Ron's the president, but I'm the king."
Some little people contributed too. They are
the "Smurfs", wide receivers Alvin Garrett (5-7,

178) and Charlie Brown (5-10, 179).
Garrett scored Washington's first touchdown
on a four-yard pass from quarterback Joe
Theismann and Crown accounted for the final
touchdown by catching Theismann's six-yard
scoring throw.
The Redskins shut down the Dolphins' run
ning game, holding Miami to 34 total yards in the
second half. The Redskins were so dominant in
the last two periods that the Dolphins didn't
complete any of 11 passes.
Once Riggins became dominant, it made
Theismann's passing that much more effective.
Theismann threw two interceptions, but he also
completed 15 of 23 passes for 143 yards and two
touchdowns. In addition, he prevented a Miami
touchdown knocking away a batted pass that
had found its way into the hands of the Dol
phin's Kim Bokamper in the second half.
