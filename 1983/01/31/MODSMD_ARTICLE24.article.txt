# Rested Card wins two
## 
### SID SPAETH 
After watching his team lose
successive dual meets last
week, Stanford wrestling
coach Chris Horpel did what
few coaches would do — he
gave his team a day off.
The Cardinal wrestlers re
bounded from their brief re
spite to thrash Claremont 54-0
and Long Beach State 46-5 in
Friday night duals. Stanford
also took fourth place in the
All-California wrestling tour
nament held at San Francisco
State Saturday. Horpel said the
tournament was optional for
his team so ony six Stanford
wrestlers competed.
"We got a little stale after Cal
Poly and Fresno State," Horpel
said. "Instead of working them
harder, I gave them a day off. I
think they were mentally
fatigued. They really re
sponded well."
If the Cardinal was fatigued
before, attitudes were better
Friday.
"Everyone knew it was our
last home meet," Horpel said.
They came out and wrestled
very well."
Claremont was not sup
posed to pose much of a threat
to Stanford and it did not.
Stanford scored falls in half
of the ten weight classes, re
ceived forfeits in three others
and had to wrestle only two
matches to the finish.
The Cardinal picked up pins
by Bert Fukunaga (with 5:31
elapsed), Jeff Bradley (2:28),
Scott Wiggen (2:00), Pete Ro
gers (2:27) and Doug Perkins
(5:29).
Jeff Hazard had to go the dis
tance with Jim Ashford, but
came up with a 11-5 win and
Karl Bazin, wrestling at 177
pounds for an injured Jeff Wil
son, scored a 9-6 decision over
Eric Prokopakis.
That Long Beach State was to
pose much more of threat was
never evident. Captain Perkins
devoted his pre-match concen
tration to trying to make Hor
pel laugh in front of a video
camera recording the huddle.
Later Perkins would roll to his
ninth pin of the year.
Fukunaga started the rout
with an almost instantaneous

takedown of Jonathan
Kaneshiro after the referee
whistled the start of the match.
Fukunaga easily rode out his
lead to a 14-0 shutout at 118
pounds.
The Card lead grew to 11-0
when Bill George was awarded
a forfeit at 126.
Bradley had a little more dif
ficulty at 134. The match was
scoreless for most of the first
period until with 21 seconds
remaining, Bradley apparently
had a rolling takedown. But
Roger Blackshear rolled one
extra time and onto Bradley for
a takedown.
Blackshear increased his
lead to 5-1 before injuring his
leg. After a brief rest, Bradley
came back on the offensive
and scored with an escape,
three near-fall points, a
takedown and two near-fall
points to come back to a 9-6
win.
Wiggen roared to his second
pin of the day at 142 pounds,
locking Tim Mattos in a cradle
and scoring the fall with seven
seconds left in the first period.
Rogers did everything but
pin Gary Aldrich at 150 pounds.
Scoringearlyandoften, Rogers
pressed for a pin all the way to
the final buzzer, but could not
put Aldrich away and settled
for a 21-4 major decision.
Kelly Boyd scored what
would be the only points
against Stanford all day, rout
ing Hazard 17-4 at 158.
The match started out close
— tied 4-4 at the end of the first
period when Hazard appar
ently scored a reversal, but the
referee ruled it was after his
whistle and the score stood
tied. Boyd regrouped to domi
nate the final periods, rolling
to his major decision.
Co-captain Tom Mullen
jumped out to a 3-0 lead against
Steve Haxby at 167 pounds, but
Haxby fought back. Haxby
scored an escape in the third
period and both wrestlers
moved and counter-moved for
a takedown.
Haxby got the important
takedown, tying the match at
3-all with 15 seconds left. Mul
len struggled so fiercely for the
escape, Haxby was forced to

clasp his hands around Mul
len's waist — an illegal hold for
the man in control — giving
one penalty point and the win
to Mullen.
"He (Haxby) didn't want
Tom (Mullen) to get away so
bad, he locked his hands,"
Horpel said. "He made a men
tal error."
Stanford closed out the
match easily, picking up a for
feit at 177 pounds and getting
pins from Perkins at 190
pounds — his second of the
day — and from Ed Katz at
heavyweight —39 seconds into
the match.
On the opposite mat, UC-
Davis beat Claremont 51-3 and
Long Beach State 31-18.
In Saturday's tournament,
Stanford took fourth behind
winner San Francisco State,
Fresno State and San Jose
State.
Perkins won the 190-pound
weight class, his champ
ionship in the All-Cal tourney.
He finished second one other
year.
Wiggen won the 142-pound
division and Katz placed sec
ond at heavyweight.

Tom (Mullen) to get away so
bad, he locked his hands,"
Horpel said. "He made a men
tal error."
Stanford closed out the
match easily, picking up a for
feit at 177 pounds and getting
pins from Perkins at 190
pounds — his second of the
day — and from Ed Katz at
heavyweight —39 seconds into
the match.
On the opposite mat, UC-
Davis beat Claremont 51-3 and
Long Beach State 31-18.
In Saturday's tournament,
Stanford took fourth behind
winner San Francisco State,
Fresno State and San Jose
State.
Perkins won the 190-pound
weight class, his champ
ionship in the All-Cal tourney.
He finished second one other
year.
Wiggen won the 142-pound
division and Katz placed sec
ond at heavyweight.
After watching his team lose
successive dual meets last
week, Stanford wrestling
coach Chris Horpel did what
few coaches would do — he
gave his team a day off.
The Cardinal wrestlers re
bounded from their brief re
spite to thrash Claremont 54-0
and Long Beach State 46-5 in
Friday night duals. Stanford
also took fourth place in the
All-California wrestling tour
nament held at San Francisco
State Saturday. Horpel said the
tournament was optional for
his team so ony six Stanford
wrestlers competed.
"We got a little stale after Cal
Poly and Fresno State," Horpel
said. "Instead of working them
harder, I gave them a day off. I
think they were mentally
fatigued. They really re
sponded well."
If the Cardinal was fatigued
before, attitudes were better
Friday.
"Everyone knew it was our
last home meet," Horpel said.
They came out and wrestled
very well."
Claremont was not sup
posed to pose much of a threat
to Stanford and it did not.
Stanford scored falls in half
of the ten weight classes, re
ceived forfeits in three others
and had to wrestle only two
matches to the finish.
The Cardinal picked up pins
by Bert Fukunaga (with 5:31
elapsed), Jeff Bradley (2:28),
Scott Wiggen (2:00), Pete Ro
gers (2:27) and Doug Perkins
(5:29).
Jeff Hazard had to go the dis
tance with Jim Ashford, but
came up with a 11-5 win and
Karl Bazin, wrestling at 177
pounds for an injured Jeff Wil
son, scored a 9-6 decision over
Eric Prokopakis.
That Long Beach State was to
pose much more of threat was
never evident. Captain Perkins
devoted his pre-match concen
tration to trying to make Hor
pel laugh in front of a video
camera recording the huddle.
Later Perkins would roll to his
ninth pin of the year.
Fukunaga started the rout
with an almost instantaneous

takedown of Jonathan
Kaneshiro after the referee
whistled the start of the match.
Fukunaga easily rode out his
lead to a 14-0 shutout at 118
pounds.
The Card lead grew to 11-0
when Bill George was awarded
a forfeit at 126.
Bradley had a little more dif
ficulty at 134. The match was
scoreless for most of the first
period until with 21 seconds
remaining, Bradley apparently
had a rolling takedown. But
Roger Blackshear rolled one
extra time and onto Bradley for
a takedown.
Blackshear increased his
lead to 5-1 before injuring his
leg. After a brief rest, Bradley
came back on the offensive
and scored with an escape,
three near-fall points, a
takedown and two near-fall
points to come back to a 9-6
win.
Wiggen roared to his second
pin of the day at 142 pounds,
locking Tim Mattos in a cradle
and scoring the fall with seven
seconds left in the first period.
Rogers did everything but
pin Gary Aldrich at 150 pounds.
Scoringearlyandoften, Rogers
pressed for a pin all the way to
the final buzzer, but could not
put Aldrich away and settled
for a 21-4 major decision.
Kelly Boyd scored what
would be the only points
against Stanford all day, rout
ing Hazard 17-4 at 158.
The match started out close
— tied 4-4 at the end of the first
period when Hazard appar
ently scored a reversal, but the
referee ruled it was after his
whistle and the score stood
tied. Boyd regrouped to domi
nate the final periods, rolling
to his major decision.
Co-captain Tom Mullen
jumped out to a 3-0 lead against
Steve Haxby at 167 pounds, but
Haxby fought back. Haxby
scored an escape in the third
period and both wrestlers
moved and counter-moved for
a takedown.
Haxby got the important
takedown, tying the match at
3-all with 15 seconds left. Mul
len struggled so fiercely for the
escape, Haxby was forced to

clasp his hands around Mul
len's waist — an illegal hold for
the man in control — giving
one penalty point and the win
to Mullen.
"He (Haxby) didn't want
Tom (Mullen) to get away so
bad, he locked his hands,"
Horpel said. "He made a men
tal error."
Stanford closed out the
