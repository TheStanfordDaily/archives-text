### 
The Stanford men's vol
leyball team finished seventh
in the UCSB Collegiate Invita
tional Volleyball Tournament
this weekend, regarded as the
top pre-season tourney in the
nation. Five of the top ten
teams in the nation competed
in the 16-team event, including
eighth-ranked Cardinal.
No. 1 UCLA won the tour
nament by beating second
ranked and host UC-Santa Bar
bara in the finals. The Cardinal
beat Cal State-Northridge 15-8,
9-15, 15-10 in its last match to
claim seventh.
"It was a good showing for
us," said Stanford assistant
coach Don Shaw. "We took a
look at a lot of guys, and con
sidering who was there, we
hung in there pretty tough."
Stanford was in a four-team
pool that included UCLA,
Brigham Young University and
UC-San Diego. The Cardinal
fell to the top-rated Bruins, but
then defeated both BVU and
UCSD to reach the champion
ship bracket as the second
team in its pool. Once there,
Stanford lost to the University
of Manitoba, the top Canadian
team and Long Beach State, in
two-game matches.
"We use this tournament as
kind of a measuring stick," said
Shaw. "It lets us know how
much we have to work to get to
where we want to be."
Finishing ahead of Stanford
were USC in third place, Man
itoba, Long Beach State and
the University of Winnipeg
finished sixth.
The Card plays No. 9 San
Diego State Wednesday at 4:30
p.m. in Maples Pavilion.
