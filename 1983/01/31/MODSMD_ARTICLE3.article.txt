# University to discuss dorm alcohol policy
## 
### JENNIFER SEYMOUR 
Most social functions include it,
cTnd many people en|oy it. Tew see it
<is an issue But alcohol use among
students lias raised concern among
many administrators here.
Thf Mcohol Policy Committee, a
group formed to examine policies
concerning alcohol use in the dor
mitories, recently produced an
eight-point working draft of policy
change ideas including the sugges
tion that resident assistants he specif
ic.iHv prohibited from buying liquor
for under-age students.
Ilic\ plan to hold an open forum
disc ussion later this month to discuss
the polic y suggestions. Students will
be able to sneak as representatives of

student groups or as individuals.
"This draft is simply for discussion
purposes about what the University's
role should be," said |im Lyons, dean
of the Office of Student Affairs,
which formed the committee. "It will
not be recommended for policy," he
added.
Lyons said the only difference be
tween the policy suggestions and the
c urrent policies is their specification
of the role of the RA.
The draft also encourages a de
emphasis of alcohol in campus
events, advertising and dorms, I yons
said.
' We've had a small committee
within the Office Of Student Affairs
for two or three years which has con

sidered the issue of alcohol abuse
and use. It includes representatives
from Cowell, Res Ed, Tresidder and
student residences," he said.
According to Alice Supton, a
committee representative from Res
idential Fducation, the committee
members are "simply participating in
a discussion about alcohol use. We
ask ourselves, 'Are there any prob
lems in the policy?' and 'What can we
do?' We are still in the stage of con
sulting with students to get percep
tions of potential problems with the
existing policy."
Doryn Davis, head of the commit
tee and director of health promo
tions at Cowell, said the committee is
sponsoring the open forum because

"we see omissions in the current pol
icy and want to get the opinions of
others on the subject to see if we
could improve the policy . . We are
not even going to propose our work
ing draft alcohol policy at the meet
ing," she said.
The current liquor polic v as stated
in the University's Information /9SJ
requires that non-alcoholic alterna
tives be included at social functions
and it allows for self-regulation
within residences, warning that "the
legal status ot those students who arc
not yet 21 years ot age shall be ac
corded recognition and appropriate
protection."
However, Chestnut said that it is
difficult to know how much freedom
to give to each student. "We as RAs
have a responsibility to non-drinkers
and an accountability for drinkers
that make our situation difficult,
even scary. We've tried de
emphasizing alcohol in dorm func
tions by promoting strong themes,
but the stricter you get, the more you
turn people away. People won't
show up if you limit a party too
much."
Lyons said the "dual role" of RAs
— University representatives and as
students — makes their situation dif
ficult.
Prohibiting RAs from buying liquor
for students may make it impossible
for them to have any control over a
chronic alcohol abuser, according to
Lyons.
"We don't want to cut them off
completely," he said. "RAs have al
ways been in a troublesome posi
tion."
According to Supton, "RAs are
educators and hosts but also must
take responsibility for aspects of stu
dents' personal behavior."
She added, "We are concerned
with their situation. How would they
respond to regulation from Res Ed?"
Supton also said she was con
cerned about the policy changes:
"We want to avoid a situation where

there are prohibitions made with a
negative response."
She added, "We want dorms to
have attractive, imaginative parties
and of course refreshments are a part
of this. But we are also concerned
with the position of RAs. We are try
ing to decide if there is a problem or a
need for changes in our policy."
Chestnut said the policy changes
may make the job of RAs easier.
Every dorm staff approaches the
alcohol issue in a different way,
Chesnut said. "In Roble, no staff
member can buy alcohol for any
dorm member. Other dorms do not
have this rule though."
But Tom Castellano, an RA in
Toyon, said that Residential Educa
tion would not be able to enforce the
policy change. "The way Res Ed en
forces things is not an issue because
they can't do it. It's up to RAs to do
what they feel is right in each circum
stance. That's the RAs power, and at
least in Toyon we haven't had any
problems dealing positively with
situations."
Some policy change related to
driving and drinking is needed, Cas
tellano added. "The one policy I wish
they'd set down is about drinking
and driving. I really think there
should be strong rules to crack down
on this danger."
"We are interested in a non
alcoholic atmosphere for dorms, and
in ensuring the health and safety of
students. We are not taking a legalis
tic stance," Supton said.
