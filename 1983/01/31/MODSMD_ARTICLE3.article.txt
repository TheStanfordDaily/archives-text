## 
### JENNIFER SEYMOUR 
Most social functions include it,
cTnd many people en|oy it. Tew see it
<is an issue But alcohol use among
students lias raised concern among
many administrators here.
Thf Mcohol Policy Committee, a
group formed to examine policies
concerning alcohol use in the dor
mitories, recently produced an
eight-point working draft of policy
change ideas including the sugges
tion that resident assistants he specif
ic.iHv prohibited from buying liquor
for under-age students.
Ilic\ plan to hold an open forum
disc ussion later this month to discuss
the polic y suggestions. Students will
be able to sneak as representatives of

student groups or as individuals.
"This draft is simply for discussion
purposes about what the University's
role should be," said |im Lyons, dean
of the Office of Student Affairs,
which formed the committee. "It will
not be recommended for policy," he
added.
Lyons said the only difference be
tween the policy suggestions and the
c urrent policies is their specification
of the role of the RA.
The draft also encourages a de
emphasis of alcohol in campus
events, advertising and dorms, I yons
said.
' We've had a small committee
within the Office Of Student Affairs
for two or three years which has con

sidered the issue of alcohol abuse
and use. It includes representatives
from Cowell, Res Ed, Tresidder and
student residences," he said.
According to Alice Supton, a
committee representative from Res
idential Fducation, the committee
members are "simply participating in
a discussion about alcohol use. We
ask ourselves, 'Are there any prob
lems in the policy?' and 'What can we
do?' We are still in the stage of con
sulting with students to get percep
tions of potential problems with the
existing policy."
Doryn Davis, head of the commit
tee and director of health promo
tions at Cowell, said the committee is
sponsoring the open forum because

"we see omissions in the current pol
icy and want to get the opinions of
others on the subject to see if we
could improve the policy . . We are
not even going to propose our work
ing draft alcohol policy at the meet
ing," she said.
The current liquor polic v as stated
in the University's Information /9SJ
requires that non-alcoholic alterna
tives be included at social functions
and it allows for self-regulation
within residences, warning that "the
legal status ot those students who arc
not yet 21 years ot age shall be ac
corded recognition and appropriate
protection."
However, Chestnut said that it is
