CIA links assassin to Bulgaria
Washington — The Central Intelligence
geney has concluded — with what is said to be
> percent certainty — that officials of the Bul
g tri.in government had advance knowledge of
the issassination attempt against Pope John
Paul II by Turkish terrorist Mehmet Ali Agca,
with whom Bulgarian intelligence agents were

if direct Soviet involvement in an attack on the
pope had been established.
Andropov was head of the Soviet secret po

Pope John Paul was shot. Thus Andropov would

have had the ultimate responsibiliity for the at
tack if — as some have alleged — the KGB had

in Warsaw.
