CIA links assassin to Bulgaria
Washington — The Central Intelligence
geney has concluded — with what is said to be
> percent certainty — that officials of the Bul
g tri.in government had advance knowledge of
the issassination attempt against Pope John
Paul II by Turkish terrorist Mehmet Ali Agca,
with whom Bulgarian intelligence agents were
working in Rome.
But the CI A is also convinced that neither the
Bulgaria/is nor the Soviet Union instigated the
attack that occurred 20 months ago, agency of
" ials have said in reports within the U.S. gov
ernment
No smoking gun," or absolute proof of Bul
arian complicity has been found by U.S. in
■'liK'.'nce officials Nonetheless, the The An
ies has learned, CIA specialists believe

that Bulgarian intelligence agents knew Agca
was bent on killing the pope but regarded him
as an unstable person who probably would be
captured.
Thus, CI A analysts have reasoned, the Bulgar
ians would not have actively involved them
selves in Agca's plotting, even if they had been
interested in such an assassination.
If this CIA assessment of the still-simmering
controversy is adopted by the White House,
President Reagan probably still would feel free
to take part in a summit meeting with Soviet
leader Yuri Andropov — something an Ameri
can president would have found difficult to do
if direct Soviet involvement in an attack on the
pope had been established.
Andropov was head of the Soviet secret po
lice and intelligence network, the KGB. when
Pope John Paul was shot. Thus Andropov would

have had the ultimate responsibiliity for the at
tack if — as some have alleged — the KGB had
ordered the murder of the Polish pope because
of his support of the Polish independent trade
union Solidarity against the communist regime
in Warsaw.
Lebanese tensions heightened
Beirut — The level of tension in the Lebanese
capital increased sharply yesterday with the ear
Iv-morning ambush of an Israeli patrol after a
night in which the Christian section of the city
was bombarded with artillery fire.
The ambush, one of a series of attacks against
the Israelis in recent weeks, struck at a convoy
driving near Galerie Semaan, the southernmost
crossing between Christian East Beirut and
mostly Moslem West Beirut. Two rocket-pro
pelled grenades fired by guerrillas struck an ar
mored personnel carrier, killing one Israeli sol
dier and wounding four others.
The Israelis returned the fire, but the guer
rillas escaped, although two of them may have
been wounded, Israeli military spokesmen here
said. That section of the city was immediately
sealed off, but a sweep of the area turned up
nothing.
The ambush occurred after a night of shelling
in which artillery fire fell for two hours in the
Christian sector.
The shelling represented the first time since
September that the Lebanese capital has come
under artillery attack, and it led to fears that
Beirut could once again be heading for a period
of violence, despite the presence in the city of a
multinational peace-keeping force made up of
U.S. Marines and French and Italian troops.
Polish Church urges amnesty
Warsaw — Poland's Roman Catholic Church
called yesterday on the country's Communist
leadership to grant amnesty to those im
prisoned under martial law to create favorable
conditions for a planned visit here in June by
Pope John Paul 11.
Though appearing to stop short of making
the amnesty a condition for the papal visit, the
church letter represented a challenge to the
government of Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski to
meet the request or risk new rifts with the clergy
in this overwhelmingly Catholic country.
In private talks with state authorities, church
officials have repeatedly protested the im
prisonment and harassment of former mem
bers and leaders of the outlawed independent
trade union Solidarity, apparently to little avail.
The letter confirmed plans for the pontiff to
arrive June 18 for his second visit to his home
land since assuming leadership of the church in
1978.
The pope's dramatic 1979 trip to Poland
strengthened popular political resistance and
set off a wave of nationalistic feeling that is cred
ited with setting the stage for the worker revolts
that produced Solidarity a year later.
Nevertheless, Polish Primate Jozef Glemp
said as he left for a trip to the Vatican last week
that he was confident the pope would come.
Glemp is in Rome for a ceremony affirming his
recent nomination to the College of Cardinals.
Shultz faces arms issue in Asia
Tokyo — On his first mission to Asia, Secre
tary of State George Shultz is heading into an
unexpected controversy here arising out of
arms control in Europe.
Strategists here are concerned that the Gene
va medium-range missile talks, under West Eu
ropean pressure, could produce an agreement
pushing Soviet SS-20s out of Europe into Asia,
where they would threaten Japan, China and
South Korea.
A Foreign Ministry spokesman confirmed

Saturday that Shultz would be pressed for as
surances on the issue when he confers today
with Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone and
Foreign Minister Shintaro Abe.
Shultz arrived in Tokyo yesterday to begin a
three-nation swing aimed at refurbishing U.S.
relationships after Washington's long preoc
cupation with events in the Mideast, Europe
and Moscow.
At each stop, the secretary is faced with
frazzled relations:
—In Japan the ballooning U.S. trade deficit
and slow pace of defense spending remain irri
tants despite Nakasone's positive stance.
—In China a miniature trade war erupted af
ter the U.S. imposed unilateral quotas on im
ports of Chinese textiles. Probably more signifi
cant in the long run, the Deng Xiaoping regime
remains suspicious of continuing U.S. support
for Taiwan.
—In South Korea, at least, relations with
Washington appear excellent, although Presi
dent Chun Doo Hwan did send a message to
President Reagan via Nakasone expressing con
cern over protectionist sentiment in Congress.
Shortly before Shultz left Washington, a
fourth stop was added at Hong Kong, the British
colony on China's south coast.
Hussein wants direct talks now
Amman; Jordan — King Hussein, concerned
about stability in the Middle East and fearful
that a final opportunity is passing, wants to ne
gotiate a political settlement for the West Bank
in direct talks with Israel, according to officials
here in the Jordanian capital.
From the PLO, he wants a mandate to speak
for the Palestinians in negotiations with the Is
raelis. Hussein could get his answer on that
point from the Palestine National Council, the
PLO's so-called parliament in exile, which
meets Feb. 14 in Algiers.
Such a mandate would publicly signal a fun
damental change for the PLO. Yasser Arafat's
organization has always insisted on direct par
ticipation in any talks regarding the West Bank.
What Hussein wants from Israel is a freeze on
West Bank settlements and at least a timetable
for the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Leba
non. And he is counting on the United States to
influence Menachem Begin's government to
meet those conditions.
Shultz discusses Mideast plans
Tokyo — Secretary of State George Shultz ar
rived here yesterday to begin an important
Asian trip, but the intractable problems of the
Middle East lingered on his mind during a day
long flight across the Pacific.
Speaking to reporters traveling with him,
Shultz said: "I wish I could say there is a break
through in the offing."
Middle East problems occupied most of a 40-
minute exchange Shultz had with reporters in
the private office of his official plane. Shultz

made clear his frustration over lack of progress
in the withdrawal talks and in the Reagan ad
ministration's Sept. 1 peace initiative, but he
also expressed a strong belief that Israel should
not be subjected to direct U.S. pressure to make
concessions.
He explained that the United States is cur
rently paying more attention to the problem of
Israel's withdrawal from Lebanon than to that of
the Syrian and Palestinian forces because the
Syrians have promised to pull out as soon as the
Israelis do. "It takes a plan for an Israeli with
drawal to apply the acid test to the Syrian
statement (that they will follow suit)," Shultz
said.
Tax increase approval unlikely
Washington — Congress appears unlikely to
adopt President Reagan's proposal for standby
tax increases beginning in 1986 and will find
some other way to raise extra revenue, possibly
by repealing the provision to index the income
tax that it voted in 1981, congressional leaders
said yesterday.
Under indexation, tax brackets and other
provisions would be adjusted automatically
each year to offset inflation and avoid tax in
creases that otherwise occur as wages rise and
people move into higher tax brackets.
Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D-lll.) of the
House Ways and Means Committee predicted
that Congress will not approve the standby tax
es — an income surtax and excise tax on oil —
which would take effect in 1986 if the deficit
seemed unlikely to come down by then to stipu
lated levels.
Instead of proposing new tax increases,
Rostenkowski suggested, the administration
should consider rescinding cuts made earlier.
Navon may run against Begin
Jerusalem — Israeli President Yitzhak Navon,
probably the most popular member of the op
position Labor Party, disclosed his future politi
cal plans to Prime Minister Menachem Begin
during a 40-minute meeting at the presidential
mansion yesterday.
Navon is expected to announce at a news
conference this week whether he will seek a
new five-year term in the largely ceremonial
presidency or campaign for the Labor Party's
nomination to challenge Begin for the prime
minister's office.
It is widely believed that Navon will run for
prime minister, a step down on the protocol
ladder from his present post but a position of far
greater power. His term as president ends May
4.
Begin's term as prime minister does not ex
pire until November 1985.
Today's weather
Partly cloudy with a chance of showers. Lows
in the 40s and highs in the 50s.
