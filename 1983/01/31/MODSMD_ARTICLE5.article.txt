# State Republican convention
## Reagan gets party support 
### KEVIN GROSS Staff Writer 
Sacramento — U.S. Senator Pete
Wilson i R-( alit.) asked the 1000 state
Republican leaders gathered here to
rally behind President Reagan by
passing a resolution asking Reagan to
seek a second term in office.
Wilson told the delegates at the
annual state party convention that
the president has not lost control of
his administration, although, "it has
been fashionable to describe the
president in disarray in the media.
The people of the Republican party
of California who know him best
ought to say bunk."
A m a jo r portion of Wilson's
speech addressed the nation s eco
nomic problems. "Everyone is obvi
ously preoccupied with the deficit,"
said Wilson, who criticized House
Speaker Thomas (Tip) O'Neill (D-
Mass.) for exaggerating the nation's
economic woes. "Tip has predicted
seven of the last two recessions," he
said.
While Wilson endorsed Reagan's
proposed increase in defense spend
ing of approximately $35 billion, he
reiterated the president's notion
that, "Peace can only be achieved
through strength ....
"Keeping shot-putters out ot the
Olympics did not keep the Red Army
out of Afghanistan," said Wilson. He
rejected a nuclear freeze as "risky."
He said, "The only way we have got
ten the Soviet's to the bargaining
table in Geneva is by doing some
thing that they didn't want the U.S. lo
do."
Later, in a D.iily interview, Wilson
expressed concern over the number
of engineering students graduating
from U.S. universities. "I was very
much heartened by the mention

given in the President's speech to the
need for engineers."
Wilson stressed the need for em
ployment in new areas of technol
ogy-
He favored the plan tor an educa
tional savings account, proposed by
Reagan in his "State of the Union'
speech. Wilson ( haracterized it as a
"mechanism for saving for a child's
college education," in which the first
$1000 of interest would be tax-free.
The freshman senator was unwil
ling to comment, however, on the
new federal regulations linking dratt
registration to financial aid.
In his address to the convention,
California's newly-inaugurated Gov.
George Deukmejian accused legis
lators of frightening citizens with the
prospect of using registered war
rants and IOUs to balance this year s
state budget.
Earlier in the day, Wilson c riticized
a proposal by State Senator Alfred
Alquist (D-San lose) that Calitorna
IOLJs should bear the likeness and
signature oi Deukmejian. Rather, he
said, they should bear the likeness of
former Gov. lerry Brown, whom he
claimed left the new governor with
an antic ipated $l billion state budget
deficit tor the current fiscal
year.
According to Deukmejian, the
state is c urrently spending $4 million
a day more than it is receiving in rev
enue . Noting, however,
"economists agree . . . that a major
tax increase during a recession is bad
economic policy," Deukmejian af
firmed his commitment to avoid rais
ing taxes. "We can and we should
c lean up this mess without imposing
a major net tax increase on the
people."

Deukmejian emphasized that his
proposed budget does not take a
meat axe to social programs. For
example, he said that the budget
provides a b percent increase lor
elementary through high school
public education.
The governor drew loud applause
from the fiscally-coriser. ative iuri.
erne by recommending elimination
of Brown's Council on Wellness and
Physical Fitness.
He added, "The rule regarding my
predecessor's appointments is very
simple: there will be few survivors.'
After the governor's speech, As
sembly Minority Leader Robert
Naylor (R-Menlo Park) expressed op
timism about future budgeting tor
student financial aid.
"Once we get the budget back in
balance, the revenue growth should
give us opportunity to play catch up
in some programs,' said Naylor, re
ferring to the Cal-Grant program.


Pete Wilson
Naylor favored Deukmejian's pro
posed increases in the fees for stu
dents at state universities, adding
that more equity between costs at
public and private institutions is in
order.
Naylor, a Stanford graduate and
former Daily editor, also expressed
optimism for the creation of a tax
exempt state bond issue for financ
ing more student loans, once the
state is back onto a "fiscally sound
posture."

Freshman Congressman Ed Zschau
(R-Los Altos), who represents part of
Palo Alto and most of Silicon Valley,
doubted that there would be further
budget cutbacks in federally
sponsored financial aid programs.
He said he was pleased that "re
search and education are two areas
where they are proposing in
creases." Last week he attended a
Reagan-Stockman briefing on the
president's upcoming budget.
Zschau said, "The technology
issue is 'red hot' these days — even in
Washington."
Like Wilson, he emphasized that
"a major point of the president's is
that basic research is fundamental to

having a foundation for developing
high technology .... If we short
change this area — we can't maintain
our leadership."
To reduce the shortage of
technically-trained people, Zschau
encouraged students to consider
careers in technology.
While Zschau questioned the wis
dom of draft registration without a
plan to utilize it, he said, "It seems a
small price to pay."
In regard to the new regulation
sponsored by Reagan that links fi
nancial aid to draft registration,
Zschau, who favors the regulation,
said that it would be difficult to justify
a loan to someone who had not regis
tered.

On Saturday afternoon two or
ganizations for younger members of
the Republican Party held caucuses.
Representatives of the Young Repub
licans, an organization for party
members under 40, and College Re
publicans, met and discussed vari
ous resolutions. The organizations
suffer, however, from internal
ideological bickering.
One important convention event
was the election of former California
Lt. Gov. Ed Reinecke as the new state
party chairman for the next two
years. Reinecke, who served during
Reagan's second term as governor,
told the convention, "Our first goal
is to re-elect the president of the
United States."
