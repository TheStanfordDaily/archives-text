# IRS cracks down on non-registrants
## 
### TIM GRIEVE Staff writer 
In a massive attempt to increase
draft registration compliance, the
Internal Revenue Service (IKS)
sent out 175,000 letters on behalf
of the Selective Service System
earlier this month in 112 or m in g
non-registrants that their names
would be sent to the lustice De
partment for prosecution il they
failed to register within 15 davs.
Barbara McConaghy, the regis
tration management officer for
the Selei tive Service in San Fran
cisco, said that 14,800 young men
had used the business reply en
velopes sent with the letters to re
gister during the week of lan.
10-14.
McCognaghy claims the letter
campaign has been "extremely ef
fective." In the 1960 to 196}
group, registration compliance is
close Io 95 percent. For some
months, McConaghy said com
pliance has reached 97 to 98 per
cent.
The IKS agreed last summer to
mail the letters for the Elective Se
rive, using tax return information
to find addresses for the names
the Selective Service gave them.
However, the IKS did refuse to
give the addresses to the Selective

In some states the department
of motor vehicles has used
driver's license lists to mail Selec
tive Sevice letters also. The
California Department ot Motor
Vehicles has so far refused to help
the Selective Service.
If prosecuted, non-registrants
have contacted Stanford Against
Conscription (SAC) about the let
ters during the last two weeks.
"There are a few who said they
would like to register, especially
those where their parents got the
letter and are pressuring them to
do it. There are also some that
have come in and said, Is this
itr,' said SAC director Sushma
Govindaraiulu.
Govindarajulu said she feels
that the letters are "|ust another
scare tactic from the Selective
Service."
But some Stanford students
aren Iso sure that the letter Im
paign is just another scare tac
tic."
One student, who received a
Selective Service letter, said he
believes the lustice Department
will soon start prosecuting a large
number ot cases. The student,
who did not want to be identified,

said "I think eventually they will
(start prosecuting). Even if they
don't, there's still that doubt in your
mind."
Freshman Laurence Hughes dis
agrees. "I would have to admit that I
think that not registering is not going
to put me in any danger. It's not as if
they had sent me a subpoena," he
said.
Although Hughes said he is not
going to register at this point, he ad
mits that if the Justice Department
decides to prosecute him he will
have a more difficult decision to
make. "I don't think of myself as the
martyr type, but I would feel very bad
about backingdown. It's not a matter
of pride; it would just bother me that
I had compromised myself," he said.
Hughes said he thinks that his not
registering now can make a
difference in the fight to stop regis
tration.
"I think that the more people that
don't register will make a stronger
statement. If people realize that
enough people don't want it (regis

tration), I think it will help to tight
against it. Also, the more people who
haven't registered, the harder it is for
them (the Justice Department) to
prosecute people," Hughes ex
plained.
However, a student who wished to
remain anonymous said he believes
that not registering will do little
good. "They (the justice Depart
ment) are making examples of
people. You'll have your little say in
court, but no one will read the trial
transcript. The newspaper will say
Draft resister arrested for three
years,' and they (the public) will read
what fits into the news summary.
"I'm ready to protest if I think it's
going to get anything done, but I'm
not going to tilt at windmills. For
example, can you remember the first
guy who was convicted? His name
has been completely forgotten by
the American people," the student
said.
He said that were he not to register
and then be convicted, "nothing
would change. So why do it? Why
waste my life? If I stay clear of the law,
if I lean back far enough so the wind
will rush over me, then I can go
somewhere with my career and get
to the top and change something
then. You have to work within the
system."
