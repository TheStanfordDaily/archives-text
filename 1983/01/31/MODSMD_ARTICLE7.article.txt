## Senate chambers produce many presidential hopefuls The 						California Democratic Convention in retrospect 
### RICHARD DECK 
Syndicated columnist George Will
wrote last December that "there is a
statue in every stone and a presiden
tial candidate in every senator." It
appeared that Will was not too far off
the mark when the California Demo
crats held their convention in Sac
ramento two weekends ago, an
event that attracted seven possible
presidential candidates, six U.S.
senators and one member of the U.S.
House of Representatives.
National political pundits and cel
ebrated media soothsayers had de
creed that the 1983 California Demo
cratic Convention was to be the site
of the opening skirmish in the 1984
presidential campaign. The battle
continued last weekend in the
California Republican Convention
when Pete Wilson (R-Calif.) intro
duced and helped pass a resolution
endorsing President Reagan's re
nomination.
Cranston
Two weeks ago the main celebrity
at the Democratic convention was
California's senior senator, Alan
Cranston (D-Calif.). Cranston suc
cessfully peddled his "favorite son"
statusand cashed-in enough political
1.0.U.'s to win the convention's
presidential "straw ballot" — a non
binding advisory vote. In a deft polit
ical stroke, the Cranston forces
pushed through a resolution that
made the straw ballot possible. None
of the other potential presidential
contenders were alerted to the pos
sibility of a straw ballot in their invita
tions; only media reports made most
of them aware of this political threat.
Cranston astutely placed at least one
of his supporters in each Assembly
District delegation on the floor of the
convention. California State Chair
person Carmen Warshaw (D-Los
Angeles), who originally introduced
the motion for the vote, asked the
delegates a most provocative ques
tion: "Do you want the Washington
media to tell you whom you want for
the Democratic presidential
nominee?" The Cranston enthusiasts
led the massive chorus of "No."
Even though his candidacy is a
long-shot, many party professsionals
reluctantly admit that he may be just
the candidate to break the traditional
Republican stranglehold on the 120
electoral votes of the West.
Mondale
When a politician has been desig
nated a presidential frontrunner, the
eyes of the world are always focused
upon the candidate. Former Vice-
President Walter Mondale walked in
the glare of this limelight at the Sac
ramento convention.
A Gallup Poll released three weeks
ago revealed that Mondale was the

first-choice for the presidential
nomination of 32 percent of national
Democratic voters; his nearest com
petitor, Senator John Glenn (D-
Ohio), fell far behind at 14 percent.
Early front-runners have often tasted
the political kiss-of-death as hap
pened to Senator Edmund Muskie
(D-Maine) in 1972, and Senator
"Scoop" Jackson (D-Washington) in
1976. While running strong at the
present time, Mondale may yet suf
fer this fate.
Mondale was easily the most popu
lar candidate at the convention.
Everywhere he went, he was mobbed
by potential supporters, especially at
the reception in the Capitol's
Rotunda. Delegates enthusiastically
received his finely honed speech.
As of this moment, the general
evaluation among party profession
als is that Mondale greatly
strengthened his grasp on the nomi
nation by his performance in Sac
ramento. If the former vice
president wins the AFL-ClO's en
dorsement for the presidency next
October, an endorsement that may
be obtained with only 50 percent of
the delegates' votes at the next labor
union convention, then Mondale
will probably be unbeatable in the
major primaries, thus wrapping-up
the nomination.
Glenn
Senator John Glenn (D-Ohio), an
ex-astronaut, was introduced at his
Sacramento press conference as
"the first American who must have
met E.T." during his 1962 space mis
sion in the Freedom 7 space capsule.
His campaign logo includes a large
white star, an appropriate symbol for
a Marine superstar who was Ameri
ca's first man in orbit.
Glenn has come a long way to
achieve his present prominence.
During the Korean War, the Marine
fighter-pilot achieved "ace" status by
shooting down more than five North
Korean MIG jets. In the late 1950s he
was selected as one of the seven orig
inal Project Mercury astronauts.
But disappointment haunted
Glenn when he first entered the
Ohio political arena. When he first
attempted to run for the Senate in
the mid-19605, he was forced to
withdraw from the race when he
slipped on a bar of soap in his
bathtub; the fall injured his inner
ear. He also lost his second Senate
race. Glenn was finally successful in
this third electoral attempt, and he
was overwhelmingly re-elected by

the voters of Ohio in 1980.
At the convention, Glenn proved
to be popular with the delegates and
possessed enormous quantities of
"presence," but very little charisma
tic "pizazz." The Ohioan had to tield

several very tough questions at his
press conference, and the delivery of
his speech to the convention was
rather flat.
Udall
Rep. Morris Udall (D-Ariz.) is a vet
eran of the 1976 presidential primary
campaign against Jimmy Carter. A
strong environmentalist, Udall
finished second to Carter in more
primaries than he would care to re

member. Udall is suffering from Par
kinson's Disease, and will release a
report on his medical condition in
two or three weeks. At that time, he
will make a final decision concerning
the presidential race. Judging from

the crowd reaction, Udall was the
sentimental favorite of the conven
tion delegates. The media, however,
were very hard on Udall. When one
boorish Los Angeles television re
porter continued to goad Udall with
questions about his illness, the
former professional basketball
player retorted: "I feel fine — want
to go out back and shoot some
hoop?" Udall's dry wit is probably his

most famous trademark. In a future
Mondale administration, he might
be appointed Secretary of the Inte
rior, a successor to James Watt.
Hart
Colorado Senator Gary Hart is
both handsome and young, but
these are no guarantees of electoral
success in the jaded America of the
'80s. The Coloradan has an amazing
personal history: Vale Divinity stu
dent turned Yale Law student, cam
paign manager/mastermind behind
George McGovern's grassroots drive
to the Democratic presidential
nomination in 1972, elected a
freshman Senator in the post-
Watergate landslide of 1984, and
emerged as the only liberal survivor
of the New Right's PAC onslaught in
the 1980 senatorial elections. As a
human personality, he does tend to
be a little cool, distant and aloof. At
his reception, he smiled and nodded
and said a few mumbled words of
thanks, but he never really talked to
anyone who came to greet him.
Hart truly does have a head on his
shoulders. He was the only candi
date to offer a position paper to re
porters, the only candidate to hold
an "Issues Workshop." He rejected
the ideology of "boomtimes in Bel
Air and bad times in Vallejo." He is a
different sort of candidate — and a
puzzlement.
Two southerners rounded out the
field: Senator Ernest "Fritz" Hollings
(D-S.C.) and Senator Dale Bumpers
of Arkansas. If political experts are
on the mark, these two men may well
compete for a "Southern vice
presidential slot" on the 1984 Demo
cratic ticket.
Hollings
Senator Hollings, referred to as the
"South Carolina Hybrid" by political
columnist George Will, has earned a
national reputation for advocating a
federal government "spending
freeze" more than a year before the
Reagan Administration chose to pick
up this particular cudgel in the State
of the Union address. In national
party circles, South Carolina's
then-Governor Hollings achieved
media attention when he became the
first Southern governor to endorse
Northeastern Catholic John Kennedy
for the Democratic presidential
nomination in 1960. Hollings en
joyed the power of a chief executive,
and only reluctantly moved up to a
Senate seat. Hollings believes that
the media make Southerners re

spectable, part of "the Middle
American mainstream" as he put it at
his press conference in Sacramento.
The goal of Hollings' campaign is to
"prove my acceptability up North/' a
task he may achieve by a "back to
basics" campaign theme and an em
phasis on revitalizing smokestack in
dustries and agriculture, rather than
pursuing an Atari Democrat's em
phasis on new high-technology in
dustries.
Even though Hollings is a long
shot dark horse candidate, he should
not be underestimated. He has taken
on a very arduous campaign
schedule over the next few months;
speaking in a jocular tone, the
senator claimed that his "ears were
closed up" from "bouncing up and
down in New Hampshire." The
South Carolina senator may surprise
the nation, for as he self-confidently
put his chances: "If I can only get on
the Space Shuttle, then maybe I can
catch up with |ohn Glenn."
Bumpers
Senator Dale Bumpers almost stole
the show from Mondale, Glenn and
Cranston at the convention. His pas
sionate speech to the convention,
sonorous with resonating
delegates. The Capitol Hill
heavyweight deeply moved his audi
ence when he thanked Californians
for providing a haven to the refugees
of another generation, the "Okies"
and "Arkies" of the 1930s Dust Bowl.
Taking on the New Right, Bumpers
won a standing ovation when he ac
cused North Carolina Senator Jesse
Helms of being "the greatest threat
to constitutional government that
the United States has ever faced." A
lifelong environmentalist, the
Senator drove the delegates to a
frenzied, feverish pitch of excite
ment when he uttered a truly novel
and remarkable statement: "I want
only one epitaph — I led a long,
lonely, losing fight to keep lames
Watt from being confirmed in the
first place."
Bumpers has the reputation of a
"giant slayer," the man who ended
the political careers of segregationist
Governor Orval Faubus and Gover
nor Winthrop Rockefeller, the
brother of David and Nelson. After
serving in the statehouse for two
terms, Bumpers won the U.S. Senate
seat that he has held since 1975.
Bumpers has earned his political
sobriquet of "Mr. Upset." Even
though he came to Sacramento with
a staff of only four workers, he may
yet live up to his reputation in the
presidential sweepstakes.


CAMPAIGN POSTER: An entrepreneur with political savvy sold
these posters at the California Democratic Convention, held two
weeks ago. Clockwise from the upper left the presidential hopefuls
are: Sen. Gary Hart (D-Colo.), Sen. Ernest Hollings (D-S.C.), Sen.

(D-Ohio), Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) and former vice-president

Cranston at the convention. His pas
sionate speech to the convention,
sonorous with resonating
delegates. The Capitol Hill
heavyweight deeply moved his audi
ence when he thanked Californians
for providing a haven to the refugees
of another generation, the "Okies"
and "Arkies" of the 1930s Dust Bowl.
Taking on the New Right, Bumpers
won a standing ovation when he ac
cused North Carolina Senator Jesse
Helms of being "the greatest threat
to constitutional government that
the United States has ever faced." A
lifelong environmentalist, the
Senator drove the delegates to a
frenzied, feverish pitch of excite
ment when he uttered a truly novel
and remarkable statement: "I want
only one epitaph — I led a long,
lonely, losing fight to keep lames
Watt from being confirmed in the
first place."
Bumpers has the reputation of a
"giant slayer," the man who ended
the political careers of segregationist
Governor Orval Faubus and Gover
nor Winthrop Rockefeller, the
brother of David and Nelson. After
serving in the statehouse for two
terms, Bumpers won the U.S. Senate
seat that he has held since 1975.
Bumpers has earned his political
sobriquet of "Mr. Upset." Even
though he came to Sacramento with
a staff of only four workers, he may
yet live up to his reputation in the
presidential sweepstakes.


CAMPAIGN POSTER: An entrepreneur with political savvy sold
these posters at the California Democratic Convention, held two
weeks ago. Clockwise from the upper left the presidential hopefuls
are: Sen. Gary Hart (D-Colo.), Sen. Ernest Hollings (D-S.C.), Sen.
Dale Bumpers (D-Ark.), Sen. Morris Udall (D-Arz.), Sen. John Glenn
(D-Ohio), Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) and former vice-president
Fritz Mondale.
Syndicated columnist George Will
wrote last December that "there is a
statue in every stone and a presiden
tial candidate in every senator." It
appeared that Will was not too far off
the mark when the California Demo
crats held their convention in Sac
ramento two weekends ago, an
event that attracted seven possible
presidential candidates, six U.S.
senators and one member of the U.S.
House of Representatives.
National political pundits and cel
ebrated media soothsayers had de
creed that the 1983 California Demo
cratic Convention was to be the site
of the opening skirmish in the 1984
presidential campaign. The battle
continued last weekend in the
California Republican Convention
when Pete Wilson (R-Calif.) intro
duced and helped pass a resolution
endorsing President Reagan's re
nomination.
Cranston
Two weeks ago the main celebrity
at the Democratic convention was
California's senior senator, Alan
Cranston (D-Calif.). Cranston suc
cessfully peddled his "favorite son"
statusand cashed-in enough political
1.0.U.'s to win the convention's
presidential "straw ballot" — a non
binding advisory vote. In a deft polit
ical stroke, the Cranston forces
pushed through a resolution that
made the straw ballot possible. None
of the other potential presidential
contenders were alerted to the pos
sibility of a straw ballot in their invita
tions; only media reports made most
of them aware of this political threat.
Cranston astutely placed at least one
of his supporters in each Assembly
District delegation on the floor of the
convention. California State Chair
person Carmen Warshaw (D-Los
Angeles), who originally introduced
the motion for the vote, asked the
delegates a most provocative ques
tion: "Do you want the Washington
media to tell you whom you want for
the Democratic presidential
nominee?" The Cranston enthusiasts
led the massive chorus of "No."
Even though his candidacy is a
long-shot, many party professsionals
reluctantly admit that he may be just
the candidate to break the traditional
Republican stranglehold on the 120
electoral votes of the West.
Mondale
When a politician has been desig
nated a presidential frontrunner, the
eyes of the world are always focused
upon the candidate. Former Vice-
President Walter Mondale walked in
the glare of this limelight at the Sac
ramento convention.
A Gallup Poll released three weeks
ago revealed that Mondale was the

first-choice for the presidential
nomination of 32 percent of national
Democratic voters; his nearest com
petitor, Senator John Glenn (D-
Ohio), fell far behind at 14 percent.
Early front-runners have often tasted
the political kiss-of-death as hap
pened to Senator Edmund Muskie
(D-Maine) in 1972, and Senator
"Scoop" Jackson (D-Washington) in
1976. While running strong at the
present time, Mondale may yet suf
fer this fate.
Mondale was easily the most popu
lar candidate at the convention.
Everywhere he went, he was mobbed
by potential supporters, especially at
the reception in the Capitol's
Rotunda. Delegates enthusiastically
received his finely honed speech.
As of this moment, the general
evaluation among party profession
als is that Mondale greatly
strengthened his grasp on the nomi
nation by his performance in Sac
ramento. If the former vice
president wins the AFL-ClO's en
dorsement for the presidency next
October, an endorsement that may
be obtained with only 50 percent of
the delegates' votes at the next labor
union convention, then Mondale
will probably be unbeatable in the
major primaries, thus wrapping-up
the nomination.
Glenn
Senator John Glenn (D-Ohio), an
ex-astronaut, was introduced at his
Sacramento press conference as
"the first American who must have
met E.T." during his 1962 space mis
sion in the Freedom 7 space capsule.
His campaign logo includes a large
white star, an appropriate symbol for
a Marine superstar who was Ameri
ca's first man in orbit.
Glenn has come a long way to
achieve his present prominence.
During the Korean War, the Marine
fighter-pilot achieved "ace" status by
shooting down more than five North
Korean MIG jets. In the late 1950s he
was selected as one of the seven orig
inal Project Mercury astronauts.
But disappointment haunted
Glenn when he first entered the
Ohio political arena. When he first
attempted to run for the Senate in
the mid-19605, he was forced to
withdraw from the race when he
slipped on a bar of soap in his
bathtub; the fall injured his inner
ear. He also lost his second Senate
race. Glenn was finally successful in
this third electoral attempt, and he
was overwhelmingly re-elected by

the voters of Ohio in 1980.
At the convention, Glenn proved
to be popular with the delegates and
possessed enormous quantities of
"presence," but very little charisma
tic "pizazz." The Ohioan had to tield

several very tough questions at his
press conference, and the delivery of
his speech to the convention was
rather flat.
Udall
Rep. Morris Udall (D-Ariz.) is a vet
eran of the 1976 presidential primary
campaign against Jimmy Carter. A
strong environmentalist, Udall
finished second to Carter in more
primaries than he would care to re

member. Udall is suffering from Par
kinson's Disease, and will release a
report on his medical condition in
two or three weeks. At that time, he
will make a final decision concerning
the presidential race. Judging from

the crowd reaction, Udall was the
sentimental favorite of the conven
tion delegates. The media, however,
were very hard on Udall. When one
boorish Los Angeles television re
porter continued to goad Udall with
questions about his illness, the
former professional basketball
player retorted: "I feel fine — want
to go out back and shoot some
hoop?" Udall's dry wit is probably his

most famous trademark. In a future
Mondale administration, he might
be appointed Secretary of the Inte
rior, a successor to James Watt.
Hart
Colorado Senator Gary Hart is
both handsome and young, but
these are no guarantees of electoral
success in the jaded America of the
'80s. The Coloradan has an amazing
personal history: Vale Divinity stu
dent turned Yale Law student, cam
paign manager/mastermind behind
George McGovern's grassroots drive
to the Democratic presidential
nomination in 1972, elected a
freshman Senator in the post-
Watergate landslide of 1984, and
emerged as the only liberal survivor
of the New Right's PAC onslaught in
the 1980 senatorial elections. As a
human personality, he does tend to
be a little cool, distant and aloof. At
his reception, he smiled and nodded
and said a few mumbled words of
thanks, but he never really talked to
anyone who came to greet him.
Hart truly does have a head on his
shoulders. He was the only candi
date to offer a position paper to re
porters, the only candidate to hold
an "Issues Workshop." He rejected
the ideology of "boomtimes in Bel
Air and bad times in Vallejo." He is a
different sort of candidate — and a
puzzlement.
Two southerners rounded out the
field: Senator Ernest "Fritz" Hollings
(D-S.C.) and Senator Dale Bumpers
of Arkansas. If political experts are
on the mark, these two men may well
compete for a "Southern vice
presidential slot" on the 1984 Demo
cratic ticket.
Hollings
Senator Hollings, referred to as the
"South Carolina Hybrid" by political
columnist George Will, has earned a
national reputation for advocating a
federal government "spending
freeze" more than a year before the
Reagan Administration chose to pick
up this particular cudgel in the State
of the Union address. In national
party circles, South Carolina's
then-Governor Hollings achieved
media attention when he became the
first Southern governor to endorse
Northeastern Catholic John Kennedy
for the Democratic presidential
nomination in 1960. Hollings en
joyed the power of a chief executive,
and only reluctantly moved up to a
Senate seat. Hollings believes that
the media make Southerners re

spectable, part of "the Middle
American mainstream" as he put it at
his press conference in Sacramento.
The goal of Hollings' campaign is to
"prove my acceptability up North/' a
task he may achieve by a "back to
basics" campaign theme and an em
phasis on revitalizing smokestack in
dustries and agriculture, rather than
pursuing an Atari Democrat's em
phasis on new high-technology in
dustries.
Even though Hollings is a long
shot dark horse candidate, he should
not be underestimated. He has taken
on a very arduous campaign
schedule over the next few months;
speaking in a jocular tone, the
senator claimed that his "ears were
closed up" from "bouncing up and
down in New Hampshire." The
South Carolina senator may surprise
the nation, for as he self-confidently
put his chances: "If I can only get on
the Space Shuttle, then maybe I can
catch up with |ohn Glenn."
Bumpers
Senator Dale Bumpers almost stole
the show from Mondale, Glenn and
Cranston at the convention. His pas

presidential slot" on the 1984 Demo
cratic ticket.
Hollings
Senator Hollings, referred to as the
"South Carolina Hybrid" by political
columnist George Will, has earned a
national reputation for advocating a
federal government "spending
freeze" more than a year before the
Reagan Administration chose to pick
up this particular cudgel in the State
of the Union address. In national
party circles, South Carolina's
then-Governor Hollings achieved
media attention when he became the
first Southern governor to endorse
Northeastern Catholic John Kennedy
for the Democratic presidential
nomination in 1960. Hollings en
joyed the power of a chief executive,
and only reluctantly moved up to a
Senate seat. Hollings believes that
the media make Southerners re

spectable, part of "the Middle
American mainstream" as he put it at
his press conference in Sacramento.
The goal of Hollings' campaign is to
"prove my acceptability up North/' a
task he may achieve by a "back to
basics" campaign theme and an em
phasis on revitalizing smokestack in
dustries and agriculture, rather than
pursuing an Atari Democrat's em
phasis on new high-technology in
dustries.
Even though Hollings is a long
shot dark horse candidate, he should
not be underestimated. He has taken
on a very arduous campaign
schedule over the next few months;
speaking in a jocular tone, the
senator claimed that his "ears were
closed up" from "bouncing up and
down in New Hampshire." The
South Carolina senator may surprise
the nation, for as he self-confidently
put his chances: "If I can only get on
the Space Shuttle, then maybe I can
catch up with |ohn Glenn."
Bumpers
Senator Dale Bumpers almost stole
the show from Mondale, Glenn and
Cranston at the convention. His pas
sionate speech to the convention,
sonorous with resonating
delegates. The Capitol Hill
heavyweight deeply moved his audi
ence when he thanked Californians
for providing a haven to the refugees
of another generation, the "Okies"
and "Arkies" of the 1930s Dust Bowl.
Taking on the New Right, Bumpers
won a standing ovation when he ac
cused North Carolina Senator Jesse
Helms of being "the greatest threat
to constitutional government that
the United States has ever faced." A
lifelong environmentalist, the
Senator drove the delegates to a
frenzied, feverish pitch of excite
ment when he uttered a truly novel
and remarkable statement: "I want
only one epitaph — I led a long,
lonely, losing fight to keep lames
Watt from being confirmed in the
first place."
Bumpers has the reputation of a
"giant slayer," the man who ended
the political careers of segregationist
Governor Orval Faubus and Gover
nor Winthrop Rockefeller, the
brother of David and Nelson. After
serving in the statehouse for two
terms, Bumpers won the U.S. Senate
seat that he has held since 1975.
Bumpers has earned his political
sobriquet of "Mr. Upset." Even
though he came to Sacramento with
a staff of only four workers, he may
yet live up to his reputation in the
presidential sweepstakes.


CAMPAIGN POSTER: An entrepreneur with political savvy sold
these posters at the California Democratic Convention, held two
weeks ago. Clockwise from the upper left the presidential hopefuls
are: Sen. Gary Hart (D-Colo.), Sen. Ernest Hollings (D-S.C.), Sen.
Dale Bumpers (D-Ark.), Sen. Morris Udall (D-Arz.), Sen. John Glenn
(D-Ohio), Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) and former vice-president
Fritz Mondale.
Syndicated columnist George Will
wrote last December that "there is a
statue in every stone and a presiden
tial candidate in every senator." It
appeared that Will was not too far off
the mark when the California Demo
crats held their convention in Sac
ramento two weekends ago, an
event that attracted seven possible
presidential candidates, six U.S.
senators and one member of the U.S.
House of Representatives.
National political pundits and cel
ebrated media soothsayers had de
creed that the 1983 California Demo
cratic Convention was to be the site
of the opening skirmish in the 1984
presidential campaign. The battle
continued last weekend in the
California Republican Convention
when Pete Wilson (R-Calif.) intro
duced and helped pass a resolution
endorsing President Reagan's re
nomination.
Cranston
Two weeks ago the main celebrity
at the Democratic convention was
California's senior senator, Alan
Cranston (D-Calif.). Cranston suc
cessfully peddled his "favorite son"
statusand cashed-in enough political
1.0.U.'s to win the convention's
presidential "straw ballot" — a non
binding advisory vote. In a deft polit
ical stroke, the Cranston forces
pushed through a resolution that
made the straw ballot possible. None
of the other potential presidential
contenders were alerted to the pos
sibility of a straw ballot in their invita
tions; only media reports made most
of them aware of this political threat.
Cranston astutely placed at least one
of his supporters in each Assembly
District delegation on the floor of the
convention. California State Chair
person Carmen Warshaw (D-Los
Angeles), who originally introduced
the motion for the vote, asked the
delegates a most provocative ques
tion: "Do you want the Washington
media to tell you whom you want for
the Democratic presidential
nominee?" The Cranston enthusiasts
led the massive chorus of "No."
Even though his candidacy is a
long-shot, many party professsionals
reluctantly admit that he may be just
the candidate to break the traditional
Republican stranglehold on the 120
electoral votes of the West.
Mondale
When a politician has been desig
nated a presidential frontrunner, the
eyes of the world are always focused
upon the candidate. Former Vice-
President Walter Mondale walked in
the glare of this limelight at the Sac
ramento convention.
A Gallup Poll released three weeks
ago revealed that Mondale was the

first-choice for the presidential
nomination of 32 percent of national
Democratic voters; his nearest com
petitor, Senator John Glenn (D-
Ohio), fell far behind at 14 percent.
Early front-runners have often tasted
the political kiss-of-death as hap
pened to Senator Edmund Muskie
(D-Maine) in 1972, and Senator
"Scoop" Jackson (D-Washington) in
1976. While running strong at the
present time, Mondale may yet suf
fer this fate.
Mondale was easily the most popu
lar candidate at the convention.
Everywhere he went, he was mobbed
by potential supporters, especially at
the reception in the Capitol's
Rotunda. Delegates enthusiastically
received his finely honed speech.
As of this moment, the general
evaluation among party profession
als is that Mondale greatly
strengthened his grasp on the nomi
nation by his performance in Sac
ramento. If the former vice
president wins the AFL-ClO's en
dorsement for the presidency next
October, an endorsement that may
be obtained with only 50 percent of
the delegates' votes at the next labor
union convention, then Mondale
will probably be unbeatable in the
major primaries, thus wrapping-up
the nomination.
Glenn
Senator John Glenn (D-Ohio), an
ex-astronaut, was introduced at his
Sacramento press conference as
"the first American who must have
met E.T." during his 1962 space mis
sion in the Freedom 7 space capsule.
His campaign logo includes a large
white star, an appropriate symbol for
a Marine superstar who was Ameri
ca's first man in orbit.
Glenn has come a long way to
achieve his present prominence.
During the Korean War, the Marine
fighter-pilot achieved "ace" status by
shooting down more than five North
Korean MIG jets. In the late 1950s he
was selected as one of the seven orig
inal Project Mercury astronauts.
But disappointment haunted
Glenn when he first entered the
Ohio political arena. When he first
attempted to run for the Senate in
the mid-19605, he was forced to
withdraw from the race when he
slipped on a bar of soap in his
bathtub; the fall injured his inner
ear. He also lost his second Senate
race. Glenn was finally successful in
this third electoral attempt, and he
was overwhelmingly re-elected by

the voters of Ohio in 1980.
At the convention, Glenn proved
to be popular with the delegates and
possessed enormous quantities of
"presence," but very little charisma
tic "pizazz." The Ohioan had to tield

several very tough questions at his
press conference, and the delivery of
his speech to the convention was
rather flat.
Udall
Rep. Morris Udall (D-Ariz.) is a vet
eran of the 1976 presidential primary
campaign against Jimmy Carter. A
strong environmentalist, Udall
finished second to Carter in more
primaries than he would care to re

member. Udall is suffering from Par
kinson's Disease, and will release a
report on his medical condition in
two or three weeks. At that time, he
will make a final decision concerning
the presidential race. Judging from

the crowd reaction, Udall was the
sentimental favorite of the conven
tion delegates. The media, however,
were very hard on Udall. When one
boorish Los Angeles television re
porter continued to goad Udall with
questions about his illness, the
former professional basketball
player retorted: "I feel fine — want
to go out back and shoot some
hoop?" Udall's dry wit is probably his

most famous trademark. In a future
Mondale administration, he might
be appointed Secretary of the Inte
rior, a successor to James Watt.
Hart
Colorado Senator Gary Hart is
both handsome and young, but
these are no guarantees of electoral
success in the jaded America of the
'80s. The Coloradan has an amazing
personal history: Vale Divinity stu
dent turned Yale Law student, cam
paign manager/mastermind behind
George McGovern's grassroots drive
to the Democratic presidential
nomination in 1972, elected a
freshman Senator in the post-
Watergate landslide of 1984, and
emerged as the only liberal survivor
of the New Right's PAC onslaught in
the 1980 senatorial elections. As a
human personality, he does tend to
be a little cool, distant and aloof. At
his reception, he smiled and nodded
and said a few mumbled words of
thanks, but he never really talked to
anyone who came to greet him.
Hart truly does have a head on his
shoulders. He was the only candi
date to offer a position paper to re
porters, the only candidate to hold
an "Issues Workshop." He rejected
the ideology of "boomtimes in Bel
Air and bad times in Vallejo." He is a
different sort of candidate — and a
puzzlement.
Two southerners rounded out the
field: Senator Ernest "Fritz" Hollings
(D-S.C.) and Senator Dale Bumpers
of Arkansas. If political experts are
on the mark, these two men may well
compete for a "Southern vice
presidential slot" on the 1984 Demo
cratic ticket.
