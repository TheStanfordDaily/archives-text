# Convention mirrors crises
## 
### RICHARD DECK 
Much of the heat and
anger loose in the country
were reflected at the Demo
cratic convention in Sac
ramento. The convention's
hard undertone was estab
lished at the outset by State
Chairperson Nancy Pelosi:
"The Reagan Administra
tion's contempt . . . betrays
a lack of faith in the Ameri
can people and a near bar
baric mentality about the
role of government in a
civilized society."
Various groups picketed
the convention site, each
espousing a different cause.
The National Democratic
Policy Committee, the or
ganizational vehicle for
former antiwar activist and
Democratic presidential
contender Lyndon
Laßouche, was out in full
force in Sacramento. The
Laßouche supporters car
ried placards with messages
such "Cranston is the Mar
cos of the U.S." and "Don't
Give the Democratic Party
to the Slumlords and
Bankers — Let Laßouche
Speak!"
Numerous peace, anti
war, anti-nuclear, and pro
freeze groups also set up
camp at the convention: the
Alliance for Survival, the
Mid-Peninsula Conversion
Project, the Democrats for
Peace Conversion, and the
Peacemakers Coalition of
the San Francisco Area were
counted among their
number.
The Southern Californa
Harvey Milk Lesbian and
Gay Democratic Club urged
delegates not to support
former Florida Governor
Reuben Askew, who did not
attend the convention, be
cause of his alleged anti-gay
record. Askew supported
Anita Bryant in her various
anti-homosexual crusades
in southern Florida during
the 19705.
Freshman Assemblyman
Tom Hayden (D-Calif.), ac

tress Jane Fonda, and their
Campaign for Economic
Democracy also constituted
influential forces at the
California State Democratic
Convention. The CED's
Convention Dinner, which
was ironically held in Sac
ramento's Odd Fellows
Hall, was packed to over
flowing capacity; large
numbers of people were re
luctantly turned away.
Speakers at the dinner in
cluded presidential aspir
ants Alan Cranston and Gary
Hart. After observing this
crowded scene, Marc
Litchman, director of the
University of California's
Student Lobby, wearily re
marked that "... in hard
times, people are always
pushed to the Left."
The convention was a
study in contrasts, particu
larly in relation to its setting
in Sacramento. Throughout
the convention, the Demo
crats ate very well: a break
fast honoring Cranston, a
Jefferson/Jackson Dinner
Dance honoring State Chair
Nancy Pelosi and the CED
Convention Dinner. All of
these great feasts took place
in the same week that Sac
ramento opened a shelter
for the homeless, a
"poorhouse," for the first
time since the Great De
pression of the 19305.
Caucus mania ruled the
convention, particularly in
the early stages of its devel
opment.
Even within the context of
this liberal party's conven
tion, at times it appeared
that the democratic system
was overloaded: two many
demands, some conflicting,
were made by the different
groups — it was obvious
that not all of these pro
posed positions would be
aproved by all of the con
vention delegates.
