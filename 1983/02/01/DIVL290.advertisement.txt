Announcing —
the return of an old favorite.
Beginning Friday, Bug Me will fly back into the Daily
after a two-year hibernation. Bug us with your ques
tions — anything that's been bugging you about Stan
ford, we'll try to answer, from whatever happened to
such and such to why on earth are they doing so and
so. Send questions to Bug Me, c/o Stanford Daily,
Stanford, C 4 94305, or bring them by the Daily office
in the Storke Publications Building.
