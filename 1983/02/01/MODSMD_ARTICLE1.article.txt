### KRISTEN CHRISTOPHER 
A female student here was at
tacked by four men who tried to rape
her at the Stanford Shopping Center
Saturday evening, according to Stan
ford Police Chief Marvin Herrington.
The men approached the student
as she headed toward her bicycle in a
loading dock area around 6 p.m.,
closing time for the shopping center.
They made sexual comments and
then grabbed her, Harrington said.
They held the student for 15 min
utes, keeping a hand over her mouth
so she could not attract attention.
"One was acting as a lookout," Her
rington said.
The coincidental appearance of a
shopping center uniformed security
guard allowed the student to get
away. She told her attackers she saw
the £uard in the distance, Herrington
said. Three of the men fled im
mediately, but the other held her be
fore joining the rest of the group in
an early 19605, two-door sedan.
Herrington said the guard "didn't
even see what happened."
The student returned to her dorm
room and then called the police.
Palo Alto Police are investigating
the case, since they are responsible
for the shopping center area.
Palo Alto Detective |im Coffman
said, "We will talk with the victim . . .
about maybe coming up with a com
posite sketch."
The victim told police that three of
the men are Caucasian and one is
Hispanic. All are approximately 20
years old.
The white men are 6-foot-2, 190
pounds, with short, slightly curled,
brown hair and a moustache; 5-11,
170 pounds, with shoulder length
blond hair and acne scars on his face;
and 6-0, 200 pounds, with "kind of
stringy" red hair, a beard and mous
tache, Herrington said.
The student also provided detailed
descriptions of the clothing the men
were wearing and said that three of
the suspects had cuts on their hands
or lips.
Police have issued a bulletin on the
car the men were driving, which is
jacked-up and painted a dark color
over tan.
"My concern is that people on the
campus know about this," Her
rington said. He reminded students
to be cautious, to use the escort ser
vice and to call the police if they see
anything suspicious.
