## Course examines origin of human nature 
### KRISTEN BROWN 
Prof. Robert Ornstein, a Stanford
graduate and now an associate profes
sor of medical psychology at UC-San
Francisco, had often felt that the one
thing lacking in his undergraduate life
was a class that puts together what it
means to be human.
"Everyone comes to school with
questions about human nature," he
said. "Is there a 'human nature'? Are we
naturally aggressive? Are men more ag
gressive than women? Can the brain
grow and change?. . . University clas
ses tend to focus on specitic things."
In response to Ornstein's idea, the
Human Biology Department is offering
a new course this quarter: Human Na
ture: The Human Animal.
"It should be a broad, general intro
duction to human nature — more de
signed to intrigue people than give
easy, multiple-choice answers," Orns
tein said.
Originally, Ornstein had only
planned toadministera final, bypassing
a midterm. But a midterm has since
been added to the course outline to
provide the professors with feedback
about the students' progress.

The course begins with a exploration
of people s origins, and the process of
evolution. Then it will progress to the
evolution of human sexuality, the two
brain hemispheres, brain growth po
tential and basic human emotions.
What has made the class c ome alive is
the prominent guest lecturers, most of
whom are authors of books in the
course's required reading list.

The Jan. 17 lecture featured Donald
Johansen, a paleoanthropologist and
author of Lucy, a book about the dis
covery of 40 percent of a prehistoric
skeleton dubbed "Lucy." Lucy's joints
provide considerable evidence that
three and one half million years ago,
before people's brain size had devel
oped, Lucy stood up rather than walk-

ing on all fours. This notion altered
people's view of evolution.
Donald Symons, author of Evolution
of Human Sexuality, will give lectures
on Feb. 7 and 10. Prof. Ornstein said,
"Symons holds one of the more in
teresting but controversial views" on
biological reasons for differences be
tween male and female sexual be
havior.

Other guest lecturers include
Stephen Gould, author of The Panda's
Thumb, David Barash, author of
Socio-Biology and Behavior, Marion
Diamond, an authority on "how the
brain grows with experience," and Paul
Ekman, author of Emotions in the
Human Race."
Ornstein, who will speak at approxi

mately four of the nine class lectures,
wrote The Psychology ofConscious
ness. •
"Consciousness is probably the most
important and most hidden part in
mind/brain/'Ornstein explained.
"Many recent developments have
made consciousness more under
standable, for instance; our growing
knowledge about the brain's two parts
and the distinctness of their functions."
The lecture series will be highlighted
March 11 with a one-day symposium in
San Francisco on psychoimmunology:
a burgeoning area of study on how
people's minds can affect the course ot
a disease. The symposium will feature
several of the field's foremost experts.
Most students interviewed by the
Daily are enthusiastic about the class
and particularly appreciate Ornstein's
effort to bring in leading experts to dis
cuss their work in person. This aspect
adds an exciting dimension to the study
materials.
A few students complain that the
creationist view is not considered dur
ing section discussions. But for the
most part, the course succeeds as an
interesting exploration into human na
ture, they said.
