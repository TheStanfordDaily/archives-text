## The 						Stanford Daily Yes to Prof. McCloskey 
### 
Quite a brouhaha took place last week over
the initial ASSU approval of former U.S. Rep.
Paul "Pete" McCloskey to a guest professorship
here this spring.
Despite the sincere objections raised by
members of the lewish community, the ASSU
senate's verdict — a 13-2 initial approval of the
appointment — was sound.
Most of the criticism directed at McCloskey
centered around his remarks concerning Jews.
We agree that McCloskey's statement, "You're
either an American for American policy or
you're a Jew who puts Israel ahead of the U. 5.,"
is harsh, out of place and unpardonable.
Critics also claim that the former representa
tive is too controversial and liable to interject
strong personal views into his proposed class,
The Congressional Decisionmaking Process,
1964-1983. This criticism neglects the concept of
academic freedom. One of the University's
greatest benefits is the diversity of opinion each
student encounters here.

The selection of McCloskey is not a legitimi
zation of his views. Instead, McCloskey's ap
pointment should be considered in the same
light as all other appointments and hirings. The
criterion for his selection was his ability to teach
a specific subject, and on this criterion alone is
the most constructive evaluation made.
With 15 years in the House of Representatives
serving California's 12th Congressional dis
trict, and teaching stints at both Stanford and
Santa Clara law schools, McCloskey presents
impressive credentials. He also has valuable
first-hand experience with his subject.
We should not condone McCloskey's ill
considered remarks. Yet his qualifications must
not be overlooked. His classroom, as any other,
should be an animated forum for the exchange
of ideas, and if his performance in Congress is
any indication, it will be lively. A suggestion to
his critics — take the class. For when well
argued but opposing views clash in a vigorous
academic setting, we all benefit.
