## Life is tough for new teachers 
### 
I was a member of the 1981-82 Stan
ford Teacher Education Program.
The reasons someone like me can't
get a job in the teaching profession
appear to be numerous.
Maybe above all, our country's
economic woes are responsible.
Given a failing economy, few new
programs in education are being im
plemented and almost no educa
tional programs presently existing
are being expanded — this limits new
openings rather directly.
Further, in light of the times, older
teachers who might otherwise retire
are hanging onto their jobs as long as
possible. This creates two problems:
1) obviously, this limits new open
ings, and 2) these older teachers are
at the top of the wage scale. Hence,
their staying on creates a financial
burden for school districts (one
$30,000 tenured teacher equals two
$15,000 first-year teachers, money
wise).
It you'll allow this digression, I'd
like to comment further on this
phenomenon. The average age of
teachers has gone up significantly in
the last decade. Students thus have

Is a student more likely to adopt a grey-haired\
60 year-old lady as a role model or a person
under 40 years of age. Also, consider the student
with a highly personal problem. Do you think
(s)he will feel comfortable discussing this
problem with old Mr. X?

more and more trouble relating (in a
positive way) to their teachers; these
days the generation gap in the class
room widens every year.
A teacher can also influence a stu
dent as a role model; (s)he can show
the students the nature of proper
and responsible action and the result
of hard work. I pose the question: Is
a student more likely to adopt a
grey-haired, 60year-old lady as a role
model or a person under 40 years of
age?

Also, consider the student with a
highly personal problem. Do you
think (s)he will feel comfortable dis
cussing this problem with old Mr. X?
Maybe, but shouldn't (s)he be able to
go to some younger person if (s)he
so desires?
Don't get mewrong! Many, maybe
most, older teachers do a fine job.
Some have grown and learned with
the times and possess a seemingly
unending wealth of creative ideas.
But, to have school faculties filled
almost exclusively by such older
teachers is a mistake and a disservice
to the students.
Varying the age of teachers will
help the students gain exposure to
different perspectives arising from
different generations, and that sort
of life-training is one of the vital and
essential tasks our educational in
stitutions should perform.
Of course, unemployment now
exists on a more widespread basis
than at any other time in the recent
past. In such times, job areas fi
nanced by public funds and tax reve
nue suffer greatly; education is one
area that has fared rather poorly in

the last decade. Consequently, few
new teachers are being hired and the
competition for existing positions is
rather intense.
I was told that more than 60 applic
ants applied for one of the jobs for
which I was granted an interview;
you know at least a few of those can
didates had to have more experience
than I do. So, while the man who
interviewed me claimed to like me
and predicted a bright future for me
in teaching, he could not hire me

because I lacked experience and
thus was automatically an unaccept
able candidate. Well, life isn't easy
for anyone, prospective teachers in
cluded.
What, then, can we or should we
conclude about the plight of the
newly certified teacher and his/her
quest for a way to break into the
teaching game?
Certainly, we affirm that his/
her road to a secure professional lite
is not an easy one. Gaining a footh
old or entryway into the field is a
highly difficult task; new openings
are few, competition for jobs is in
tense, educational programs re
duced in size and scope, publicfund
ing for education at an all-time low,
older teachers staying in the profes
sion longer — it all adds up to great
frustration and hardship for the pro
spective teacher.
I believe, the frustration of young
teachers is mirrored in many, maybe
most, of the older professional sec
tors of our society; individuals who
have devoted themselves to a par
ticular field and thus are forced to
work at menial jobs because their
specialized skills and knowledge are
not in demand at this time.
Such individuals can become
highly disillusioned with the state of
the society and become disenfranch
ised with and openly critical of the
systems that support that social
structure. A society where many of
the skilled laborers and trained pro
fessionals feel alienated and cast out
from the mainstream of contribut
ing, working citizens clearly stands
as a society in trouble.
Ours is indeed a troubled society,
and the situation of the prospective
teacher evidences and reveals this
fact. If we are to remain a prosperous
land, the land of opportunities, we
must find ways to reverse these de
structive trends and put our citizens
to work in their chosen fields.

I was a member of the 1981-82 Stan
ford Teacher Education Program.
The reasons someone like me can't
get a job in the teaching profession
appear to be numerous.
Maybe above all, our country's
economic woes are responsible.
Given a failing economy, few new
programs in education are being im
plemented and almost no educa
tional programs presently existing
are being expanded — this limits new
openings rather directly.
Further, in light of the times, older
teachers who might otherwise retire
are hanging onto their jobs as long as
possible. This creates two problems:
1) obviously, this limits new open
ings, and 2) these older teachers are
at the top of the wage scale. Hence,
their staying on creates a financial
burden for school districts (one
$30,000 tenured teacher equals two
$15,000 first-year teachers, money
wise).
It you'll allow this digression, I'd
like to comment further on this
phenomenon. The average age of
teachers has gone up significantly in
the last decade. Students thus have

Is a student more likely to adopt a grey-haired\
60 year-old lady as a role model or a person
under 40 years of age. Also, consider the student
with a highly personal problem. Do you think
(s)he will feel comfortable discussing this
problem with old Mr. X?

more and more trouble relating (in a
positive way) to their teachers; these
days the generation gap in the class
room widens every year.
A teacher can also influence a stu
dent as a role model; (s)he can show
the students the nature of proper
and responsible action and the result
of hard work. I pose the question: Is
a student more likely to adopt a
grey-haired, 60year-old lady as a role
model or a person under 40 years of
age?

Also, consider the student with a
highly personal problem. Do you
think (s)he will feel comfortable dis
cussing this problem with old Mr. X?
Maybe, but shouldn't (s)he be able to
go to some younger person if (s)he
so desires?
Don't get mewrong! Many, maybe
most, older teachers do a fine job.
Some have grown and learned with
the times and possess a seemingly
unending wealth of creative ideas.
But, to have school faculties filled
almost exclusively by such older
teachers is a mistake and a disservice
to the students.
Varying the age of teachers will
help the students gain exposure to
different perspectives arising from
different generations, and that sort
of life-training is one of the vital and
essential tasks our educational in
stitutions should perform.
Of course, unemployment now
exists on a more widespread basis
than at any other time in the recent
past. In such times, job areas fi
nanced by public funds and tax reve
nue suffer greatly; education is one
area that has fared rather poorly in

the last decade. Consequently, few
new teachers are being hired and the
competition for existing positions is
rather intense.
I was told that more than 60 applic
ants applied for one of the jobs for
which I was granted an interview;
you know at least a few of those can
didates had to have more experience
than I do. So, while the man who
interviewed me claimed to like me
and predicted a bright future for me
in teaching, he could not hire me

because I lacked experience and
thus was automatically an unaccept
able candidate. Well, life isn't easy
for anyone, prospective teachers in
cluded.
What, then, can we or should we
conclude about the plight of the
newly certified teacher and his/her
quest for a way to break into the
teaching game?
Certainly, we affirm that his/
her road to a secure professional lite
is not an easy one. Gaining a footh
old or entryway into the field is a
highly difficult task; new openings
are few, competition for jobs is in
tense, educational programs re
duced in size and scope, publicfund
ing for education at an all-time low,
older teachers staying in the profes
sion longer — it all adds up to great
frustration and hardship for the pro
spective teacher.
I believe, the frustration of young
teachers is mirrored in many, maybe
most, of the older professional sec
tors of our society; individuals who
have devoted themselves to a par
ticular field and thus are forced to
work at menial jobs because their
specialized skills and knowledge are
not in demand at this time.
Such individuals can become
highly disillusioned with the state of
the society and become disenfranch
ised with and openly critical of the
systems that support that social
structure. A society where many of
the skilled laborers and trained pro
fessionals feel alienated and cast out
from the mainstream of contribut
ing, working citizens clearly stands
as a society in trouble.
Ours is indeed a troubled society,
and the situation of the prospective
teacher evidences and reveals this
fact. If we are to remain a prosperous
land, the land of opportunities, we
must find ways to reverse these de
structive trends and put our citizens
to work in their chosen fields.
