## Medicine: the enemy within 
### 
During the last few years, Ameri
cans have begun to realize the in
sidious effects of the modern welfare
state. Thanks to true intellectual,
moral, and political leaders such as
Milton Friedman, Jerry Falwell, and
Ronald Reagan; we have come to see
the real causes of America's decline.
No longer do we blame things like
corporate mismanagement: We now
know that the actual cause of our
woes is Big Government.

The greatest value of capitalism is that it forces
one to take responsibility for one's condition. If
you are poor, then it is up to you to better
yourself. Analogously, if you are ill, it is your
responsibility to do something about it. Having
doctors around saps the will, decreases
incentive, and robs us of our self-reliance.

Although we are back on the road
towards getting the type of govern
ment that best suits our rugged indi
vidualist needs, there is one form of
creeping socialism that is still escap
ing the wrath it deserves. This vile
institution has existed for centuries
and remarkably retains the blessings
of nearly all Americans. I am speak
ing, of course, about medicine.
The medical profession has some
how gained respect and prestige in
our society. How any group that pur
ports to narrow the gap between the

sick and the healthy (and carries out
its aims) in this bastion of free enter
prise can survive for over two
hundred years is beyond belief.
Capitalism rewards the more indus
trious man for efforts: Whether his
abilities are due to his genetic
makeup or his upbringing makes lit
tle difference. What counts is that
the innovative, hard-working person
will rise above the shiftless, unimag
inative one and thus create incentive

for others to follow suit. Any good
American clearly sees the value in
such an arrangement.
The very ideals of medicine, on the
other hand, run contrary to these be
liefs. Without medicine, a sick per
son would suffer through a long and
strenuous illness, keeping him out of
work for extended periods of time. A
healthy person, however, would be
rewarded for his resistance to illness
by 1) not having to endure physical
suffering; and 2) an income higher
than that of his bedridden co
worker.

By making a sick man well (and by
continually making it cheaper and
easier to make him well), we elimi
nate a great deal of incentive for a
person to stay healthy. Whether a
man's illness is caused by his hered
ity or some flaw in his behavior is not
of importance. It is obvious that a
sick man is not as productive as a
healthy one, and it is unfair to the
healthy one for the two to be re
warded equally.
The greatest value of capitalism is
that it forces one to take responsibil
ity for one's condition. If you are
poor, then it is up to you to better
yourself. Analogously, if vou are ill, it
is your responsibility to do some
thing about it. Having doctors
around saps the will, decreases in
centive, and robs us of our self
reliance.
The tax revolt taught us that only
citizen action can return our free
dom and put a stop to the sprawling,
bureaucratic jungle that calls itself
government. Stopping medicine is
going to require at least as much re
solve as did the tax revolt. We are
facing a centuries-old establishment
that most Americans don't even
realize is inherently un-American.
The battle won't be swift; nor will it
be easy. But we will in the end
emerge victorious. After all, we have
God on our side.
