## McCloskey's politics misinterpreted by his foes 
### 
Although I support the decision to
appoint Pete McCloskey as a guest
professor, I feel compelled to point
out that Jan Boyer's column concern
ing the McCloskey controversy
(Daily, Jan. 28) was an unfortunate
misrepresentation of the facts bear
ing on the issue.
For example, Boyer asserts that the
main reason why Jews on campus (all
lews?) have been opposing McClos
key's appointment is that McCloskey
understands and talks about the in
fluence of Jewish lobbying groups on
U.S. policy toward the Middle East.
I his assertion, however, is simply
untrue for two main reasons.
First, the fact that U.S. policy to
ward the Middle East is greatly influ
ent ed by Jewish groups and Jewish
voting is common knowledge to
anybody who knows anything about
U.S. foreign policy. McCloskey is not
exposing some "hidden truth" that
Jews are trying to cover up.
However, Boyer made the same
mistake that McCloskey has made
when he inferred in his column that
Jewish people in the United States
and Israel all line up behind Begin to
give the "green light" to his govern
ment's oppressive policies. A vast
percentage of Jews in the United
States and Israel are disgusted by the
actions of the current Israeli regime,
ami many want no part in aiding such
policies — financially or otherwise.
Second, the real reason why many
people on campus oppose McClos

key's professorship stems from an in
terpretation of some of his public
comments as "slanderous." For
example, in March 1982, he said, "It
seems to me you can't have it two
ways. You're either an American for
American policy, or you're a lew who
puts Israel ahead of the U.S." Admit
tedly, this comment could hardly
serve any purpose other than slan
der, as it has no factual legitimacy at
all.
Similarly, in light of the obvious
lack of factual legitimacy behind
Boyer's analysis of the McCloskey
controversy, I am led to wonder
about his motivation for writing that
column, as well. The Daily itself can
be a "slanderous" weapon if used in
an irresponsible fashion.

Stop fee rebate
I would like to express my disgust
at the current practice of allowing
students to collect fee assessment
rebates. A fundamental tenet of de
mocracy is the majority rule; we can
not avoid a jail term for a law we
deem unjust, nor collect a rebate on
a tax we deem misspent.
The benefits of a diverse and well
financed set of student-run organiza
tions accrue to the University as a

whole. These benefits improve the
quality of life here; each individual
receives a part of this improvement
irrespective of whether they directly
participate in any fee-assessed or
ganization. However high the price
of education is, the quarterly fee as
sessment must be seen as a neces
sary part of that price and be insus
ceptable to "cost-cutting."
Seeing students lining up for a few
dollars back is an indignity which the
University community should no
longer allow.

Note of thanks
Since April 1980, when the Stan
ford University Blood Bank first held
a blood drive on campus, students
and staff have given countless hours
of their time in helping to coordinate
all of the logistics involved in holding
blood drives for their Student Living
Groups and their departments, and
in donating blood themselves. The
Stanford University Blood Bank
thanks all the members of the com
munity for their support in this work
to "give life's most precious gift."
On lan. 17 the residents of the
newly opened Governor's Corner
hosted their first blood drive. True to
the Stanford spirit, this blood drive

was met with much enthusiasm and
great support. We at the Stanford
University Blood Bank applaud the
residents of Governor's Corner and
we thank the Daily for the publicity
given to this event.
We would, however, like to cor
rect the caption under the picture
(Daily, Jan. 19) and point out that it
was the Stanford University Blood
Bank, and not a neighboring blood
bank to the south, which sponsored
this drive.
The Stanford University Blood
Bank provides most of the blood and
blood products needed by the pa
tients at the Stanford University
Hospital and the Children's Hospital.
Together these institutions are one
of the largest users of blood and
blood products in the United States,
and require unique and specialized
products only available through a
university-affiliated blood bank such
as ours. Stanford University Blood
Bank is currently receiving 18,000
donations a year from volunteer
donors who are community and
campus residents and employees of
nearby industries.
The superb participation of the
University community permits us to
meet the unique needs of Stanford
Medical Center patients. Again, our
thanks and appreciation to Gover
nor's Corner, the Daily, and you, the
community.

seems to me you can't have it two
ways. You're either an American for
American policy, or you're a lew who
puts Israel ahead of the U.S." Admit
tedly, this comment could hardly
serve any purpose other than slan
der, as it has no factual legitimacy at
all.
Similarly, in light of the obvious
lack of factual legitimacy behind
Boyer's analysis of the McCloskey
controversy, I am led to wonder
about his motivation for writing that
column, as well. The Daily itself can
be a "slanderous" weapon if used in
an irresponsible fashion.

Stop fee rebate
I would like to express my disgust
at the current practice of allowing
students to collect fee assessment
rebates. A fundamental tenet of de
mocracy is the majority rule; we can
not avoid a jail term for a law we
deem unjust, nor collect a rebate on
a tax we deem misspent.
The benefits of a diverse and well
financed set of student-run organiza
tions accrue to the University as a

whole. These benefits improve the
quality of life here; each individual
receives a part of this improvement
irrespective of whether they directly
participate in any fee-assessed or
ganization. However high the price
of education is, the quarterly fee as
sessment must be seen as a neces
sary part of that price and be insus
ceptable to "cost-cutting."
Seeing students lining up for a few
dollars back is an indignity which the
University community should no
longer allow.

Note of thanks
Since April 1980, when the Stan
ford University Blood Bank first held
a blood drive on campus, students
and staff have given countless hours
of their time in helping to coordinate
all of the logistics involved in holding
blood drives for their Student Living
Groups and their departments, and
in donating blood themselves. The
Stanford University Blood Bank
thanks all the members of the com
munity for their support in this work
to "give life's most precious gift."
On lan. 17 the residents of the
newly opened Governor's Corner
hosted their first blood drive. True to
the Stanford spirit, this blood drive

was met with much enthusiasm and
great support. We at the Stanford
University Blood Bank applaud the
residents of Governor's Corner and
we thank the Daily for the publicity
given to this event.
We would, however, like to cor
rect the caption under the picture
(Daily, Jan. 19) and point out that it
was the Stanford University Blood
Bank, and not a neighboring blood
bank to the south, which sponsored
this drive.
The Stanford University Blood
Bank provides most of the blood and
blood products needed by the pa
tients at the Stanford University
Hospital and the Children's Hospital.
Together these institutions are one
of the largest users of blood and
blood products in the United States,
and require unique and specialized
products only available through a
university-affiliated blood bank such
as ours. Stanford University Blood
Bank is currently receiving 18,000
donations a year from volunteer
donors who are community and
campus residents and employees of
nearby industries.
The superb participation of the
University community permits us to
meet the unique needs of Stanford
Medical Center patients. Again, our
thanks and appreciation to Gover
nor's Corner, the Daily, and you, the
community.

Although I support the decision to
appoint Pete McCloskey as a guest
professor, I feel compelled to point
out that Jan Boyer's column concern
ing the McCloskey controversy
(Daily, Jan. 28) was an unfortunate
misrepresentation of the facts bear
ing on the issue.
For example, Boyer asserts that the
main reason why Jews on campus (all
lews?) have been opposing McClos
key's appointment is that McCloskey
understands and talks about the in
fluence of Jewish lobbying groups on
U.S. policy toward the Middle East.
I his assertion, however, is simply
untrue for two main reasons.
First, the fact that U.S. policy to
ward the Middle East is greatly influ
ent ed by Jewish groups and Jewish
voting is common knowledge to
anybody who knows anything about
U.S. foreign policy. McCloskey is not
exposing some "hidden truth" that
Jews are trying to cover up.
However, Boyer made the same
mistake that McCloskey has made
when he inferred in his column that
Jewish people in the United States
and Israel all line up behind Begin to
give the "green light" to his govern
ment's oppressive policies. A vast
percentage of Jews in the United
States and Israel are disgusted by the
actions of the current Israeli regime,
ami many want no part in aiding such
policies — financially or otherwise.
Second, the real reason why many
people on campus oppose McClos

key's professorship stems from an in
terpretation of some of his public
comments as "slanderous." For
example, in March 1982, he said, "It
seems to me you can't have it two
ways. You're either an American for
American policy, or you're a lew who
puts Israel ahead of the U.S." Admit
tedly, this comment could hardly
serve any purpose other than slan
der, as it has no factual legitimacy at
all.
