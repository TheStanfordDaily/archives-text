## Self-effacement as style: the career of George Cukor 
### STEVE VINEBERG 
"I'm full of curiosity! And I have an
almost mystic respect for other
people's talent." - George Cukor,
1970
George Cukor, who died last week
at the age of 83, had an impeccable
reputation among actors: Five of
them won Academy Awards in movies
he directed, and many more gave
their most memorable performances
under his guidance. He directed
Greta Garbo in Camille, Cary Grant in
Holiday and The Philadelphia Story,
Rosalind Russell in The Women, In
grid Bergman and Charles Boyer in
Gaslight, )udy Holliday in Adam's Rib
and Born Yesterday, Spencer Tracy in
Adam's Rib and Pat and Mike, )udy
Garland and lames Mason in A Star Is
Born, and over and over again,
Katharine Hepburn.
Playwrights loved him, too, be
cause the movies he made of Broad
way successes like Dinner at Eight,
Holiday, The Women, The Philadel
phia Story, Born Yesterday and My Fair
Lady displayed (certainly by Hol
lywood standards) a surprising fidelity
to the original scripts. "When you do
a play or a novel," he once said, "you
should try to know why you are doing
it; what is the strength of this thing;
what is its point of view? ... If you
slick this up, if you smooth it out . . .
you rob the thing of its vitality and the
reason for doing it." He was the
apotheosis ot American filmmaking as
craft, placing his considerable talents
entirely at the service of the material
and taking obstacles out of the paths
of the gifted actors and actresses per
forming it (who often requested the
privilege of working with him).
Cukor's long career — he began as
co-director on Grumpy in 1930 and his
last picture, Rich and Famous, came
out in the fall ot 1981 — fell off in the
mid-'sos: his last first-rate movie was
Pat and Mike in 1952
And he had his share of bombs, par
ticularly in the '60s and '70s. But his
errors were almost invariably on the
side of the angels. Remarkably few of
his pictures seem sloppy or
haphazard — in Travels with My Aunt,
for example, though it's fairly tepid,
the camera movement is elegant and
the flashback sequences are deli
cately nostalgic. When Warner
Brothers hired him to transfer Lerner
and Loewe's My Fair Lady (at that point
Broadway's longest-running show) to
the screen, they knew he could be
trusted not to tamper with the stage

play. In this case Cukor's reverence
for the material turned out to be a
serious drawback: the film waltzed on
interminably, and except for the
touching late parts of Audrey Hep
burn's performance, it resembled a
museum piece more than a movie.
(Typically, the Motion Picture
Academy awarded Cukor an Oscar for
his work.)
Actually, Cukor had no real feeling
for musicals, although he directed
several, including the 1954 remake of
A Star Is Born, which has a strong cult
following because of Judy Garland's
fascinating (and often masochistic)
performance. The numbers in that
movie lack a corresponding rhythm in
the editing, yet in nonmusicals Cukor
often provided the kind of fluidity one
wants to call choreography. His
Gothic thriller Gaslight, a 1944 adapta
tion of theold matinee chestnut Angel
Street, is a stunning example in one
genre, and the Tracy-Hepburn com
edies Adam's Rib and Pat and Mike, in
another genre, are equally beautifully
paced and assembled.
Some of Cukor's '30s and '40s pic
tures seem better than they really are,

because of their speed and the excel
lence of what used to be called their
"production values" (art direction,
costumes and to some extent photog
raphy and editing came under this
category). I'm thinking of a movie like
The Women, which is based on a
dubious stage property by Claire
Boothe Luce and has that nobly suffer
ing drip Norma Shearer (the wife of
M-G-M guru Irving Thalberg) at its
center.
Cukor's collaboration with
Katharine Hepburn is legendary. It
began in 1932, when she played )ohn
Barrvmore's daughter in A Rill of Di
vorcement (it was ner debut picture),
and in the '70s he directed her twice in
made-for-TV movies (Love Among the
Ruins and The Corn Is Creen). In be
tween she made seven other films
with him, five of which —Little
Women, Holiday, Ihe Philadelphia
Story, Adam's Rib and Pat and Mike —
are among her finest. He discovered
the depth of her talent in Little
Women, in which she gives one of the
tew demonstrations in movies of a
character's ascension to maturity.
Hepburn made four films in her first

year and a half in Hollywood, hut only
in Little Women does she control the
eccentric style that was so unlike what
other actresses were showing in
movies of that period — that weird
combination of aristocratic anguish
and toughminded idealism. I think it
is safe to say that Cukor taught her
how to read lines. That may sound
insulting to Hephurn, but when you
think about Little Women weeks or
months after you've seen it, you're
likely to remember the exact intona
tion she used when, confessing that
she has rejected a marriage proposal
by her neighbor Laurie, Hepburn's |o
cries, "I feel as if I'd stabbed my best
friend!" There are moments like this
one in Holiday and The Philadelphia
Story, too.
Perhaps The Philadelphia Story ia~
the most beloved of Cukor's films, but ■
marvelous as it is, my personal
ence is for the earlier adaptation of a-
Philip Barry high comedy, Holiday.?.
(Barry didn't write the stage play
day for Hepburn — in fact, there had
already been a film version in 1930,
starring Ann Harding — but when he -
saw her in it, he wrote The Philadel
phia Story especially for her. She
played the leading role on Broadway
and it provided her with a ticket back
to Hollywood in 1940; she had left ig
nominiously two years before after
she was labeled "box office poison.")
Holiday may be the warmest comedy
of its period. In form it is a variation of
a familiar type of film, in which the
vivacious hero, engaged to a dully
conventional woman, discovers his
true match often in her sister or best
friend. (Sometimes the sex roles were
reversed, as in His Girl Friday, wherein
Rosalind Russel ditches Ralph Bellamy
for Cary Grant.) And, fulfilling a re
quirement of Depression comedy
(though the play was actually written
in the '20s), it takes place among the
very rich. But the movie's themes of
the value of self-assertiveness and the
primacy of adventure over secunty
have survived the foour and-a-half
decades since its initial release:
viewed today, Holiday is as affecting
as it must ever have been.
But you have to look very carefully
for George Cukor's fingerprints on
the lens, because the movie comes
across as a celebration of Philip Bar
ry's talents, and Hepburn's and Cary
Grant's. Cukor's talent is evident,
though, in the graceful, unstressed
production — in the deference he
pays his collaborators

Cukor's long career — he began as
co-director on Grumpy in 1930 and his
last picture, Rich and Famous, came
out in the fall ot 1981 — fell off in the
mid-'sos: his last first-rate movie was
Pat and Mike in 1952
And he had his share of bombs, par
ticularly in the '60s and '70s. But his
errors were almost invariably on the
side of the angels. Remarkably few of
his pictures seem sloppy or
haphazard — in Travels with My Aunt,
for example, though it's fairly tepid,
the camera movement is elegant and
the flashback sequences are deli
cately nostalgic. When Warner
Brothers hired him to transfer Lerner
and Loewe's My Fair Lady (at that point
Broadway's longest-running show) to
the screen, they knew he could be
trusted not to tamper with the stage

play. In this case Cukor's reverence
for the material turned out to be a
serious drawback: the film waltzed on
interminably, and except for the
touching late parts of Audrey Hep
burn's performance, it resembled a
museum piece more than a movie.
(Typically, the Motion Picture
Academy awarded Cukor an Oscar for
his work.)
Actually, Cukor had no real feeling
for musicals, although he directed
several, including the 1954 remake of
A Star Is Born, which has a strong cult
following because of Judy Garland's
fascinating (and often masochistic)
performance. The numbers in that
movie lack a corresponding rhythm in
the editing, yet in nonmusicals Cukor
often provided the kind of fluidity one
wants to call choreography. His
Gothic thriller Gaslight, a 1944 adapta
tion of theold matinee chestnut Angel
Street, is a stunning example in one
genre, and the Tracy-Hepburn com
edies Adam's Rib and Pat and Mike, in
another genre, are equally beautifully
paced and assembled.
Some of Cukor's '30s and '40s pic
tures seem better than they really are,

because of their speed and the excel
lence of what used to be called their
"production values" (art direction,
costumes and to some extent photog
raphy and editing came under this
category). I'm thinking of a movie like
The Women, which is based on a
dubious stage property by Claire
Boothe Luce and has that nobly suffer
ing drip Norma Shearer (the wife of
M-G-M guru Irving Thalberg) at its
center.
Cukor's collaboration with
Katharine Hepburn is legendary. It
began in 1932, when she played )ohn
Barrvmore's daughter in A Rill of Di
vorcement (it was ner debut picture),
and in the '70s he directed her twice in
made-for-TV movies (Love Among the
Ruins and The Corn Is Creen). In be
tween she made seven other films
with him, five of which —Little
Women, Holiday, Ihe Philadelphia
Story, Adam's Rib and Pat and Mike —
are among her finest. He discovered
the depth of her talent in Little
Women, in which she gives one of the
tew demonstrations in movies of a
character's ascension to maturity.
Hepburn made four films in her first

year and a half in Hollywood, hut only
in Little Women does she control the
eccentric style that was so unlike what
other actresses were showing in
movies of that period — that weird
combination of aristocratic anguish
and toughminded idealism. I think it
is safe to say that Cukor taught her
how to read lines. That may sound
insulting to Hephurn, but when you
think about Little Women weeks or
months after you've seen it, you're
likely to remember the exact intona
tion she used when, confessing that
she has rejected a marriage proposal
by her neighbor Laurie, Hepburn's |o
cries, "I feel as if I'd stabbed my best
friend!" There are moments like this
one in Holiday and The Philadelphia
Story, too.
Perhaps The Philadelphia Story ia~
the most beloved of Cukor's films, but ■
marvelous as it is, my personal
ence is for the earlier adaptation of a-
Philip Barry high comedy, Holiday.?.
(Barry didn't write the stage play
day for Hepburn — in fact, there had
already been a film version in 1930,
starring Ann Harding — but when he -
saw her in it, he wrote The Philadel
phia Story especially for her. She
played the leading role on Broadway
and it provided her with a ticket back
to Hollywood in 1940; she had left ig
nominiously two years before after
she was labeled "box office poison.")
Holiday may be the warmest comedy
of its period. In form it is a variation of
a familiar type of film, in which the
vivacious hero, engaged to a dully
conventional woman, discovers his
true match often in her sister or best
friend. (Sometimes the sex roles were
reversed, as in His Girl Friday, wherein
Rosalind Russel ditches Ralph Bellamy
for Cary Grant.) And, fulfilling a re
quirement of Depression comedy
(though the play was actually written
in the '20s), it takes place among the
very rich. But the movie's themes of
the value of self-assertiveness and the
primacy of adventure over secunty
have survived the foour and-a-half
decades since its initial release:
viewed today, Holiday is as affecting
as it must ever have been.
But you have to look very carefully
for George Cukor's fingerprints on
the lens, because the movie comes
across as a celebration of Philip Bar
ry's talents, and Hepburn's and Cary
Grant's. Cukor's talent is evident,
though, in the graceful, unstressed
production — in the deference he
pays his collaborators

1970
George Cukor, who died last week
at the age of 83, had an impeccable
reputation among actors: Five of
them won Academy Awards in movies
he directed, and many more gave
their most memorable performances
under his guidance. He directed
Greta Garbo in Camille, Cary Grant in
Holiday and The Philadelphia Story,
Rosalind Russell in The Women, In
grid Bergman and Charles Boyer in
Gaslight, )udy Holliday in Adam's Rib
and Born Yesterday, Spencer Tracy in
Adam's Rib and Pat and Mike, )udy
Garland and lames Mason in A Star Is
Born, and over and over again,
Katharine Hepburn.
Playwrights loved him, too, be
cause the movies he made of Broad
way successes like Dinner at Eight,
Holiday, The Women, The Philadel
phia Story, Born Yesterday and My Fair
Lady displayed (certainly by Hol
lywood standards) a surprising fidelity
to the original scripts. "When you do
a play or a novel," he once said, "you
should try to know why you are doing
it; what is the strength of this thing;
what is its point of view? ... If you
slick this up, if you smooth it out . . .
you rob the thing of its vitality and the
reason for doing it." He was the
apotheosis ot American filmmaking as
craft, placing his considerable talents
entirely at the service of the material
and taking obstacles out of the paths
of the gifted actors and actresses per
forming it (who often requested the
privilege of working with him).
