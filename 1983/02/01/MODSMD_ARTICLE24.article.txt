# Computer age – irresistable force vs. Neil Young
## 
### JEFF BIDDULPH KRISTEN CHRISTOPHER 
Both the old and the new Neil Young were at
the Cow Palace last week. A quick analysis might
have pointed to schizophrenia, but the final
diagnosis would conclude that the man —
though not completely sane — is smart enough
to know the best way he can express his an
noyance with the computer age is through its
instruments.
And this is why he amazed us for 90 minutes
with the acoustic songs which brought him
fame, only to pull out his pocket computer pro
grammer, don dark glasses with a microphone
attached to the front and transform before us
into a manifestation of our worst nightmares
about the de-personalized future.
It was all planned very carefully: Young sat in
front of the microphone with nothing but a
guitar, a harmonica and a banjo for most of the
show, singing in his strong but clear nasal
twang. Hints that songs from Trans, Young's
newest album which features him on the syn
thesizer, may be coming later were obvious.
A large television screen stood silently but
ominously on the stage waiting to be used.
When it was used for the first time, as Young
sang "Don't Be Denied," a historical song from
one of his earlier albums, Time Fades Away, it
showed pictures of Young as he progressed in
the rock world: pictures of his year-long tour
with Crosby, Stills and Nash, shots of him with
hair to his waist when he was making Tonight's
The Night and a few shots of him touring with
Crazy Horse. Young's use of the screen here was
innovative and appreciated by the crowd, who
stood cheering at the end of the first half of the
concert.
But then these shots faded, as the intermis
sion came, into a slick man named Dan Clear,
who looked like a conglomeration of every used
car dealer in Redwood City and Wink Martin
dale, who provided commentary on everything
from Young's past to the weather and tides.
Clear interviewed Young during the intermis
sion in a mocking portrayal of the times when
interviewers on the sidelines interrupt action to

talk with the performers at every possible time.
These scenes with Clear sharply contrasted to
the beauty and energy of Young at his best. In
the first half he sang songs from the angry
"Don't Let It Bring You Down" to the uplifting
"Old Man." His images of an anonymous old
blind man dying in a gutter in the former com
plimented his cheerful admonitions in the latter
of a friendly old man to "take a look at my life/
I'm a lot like you/ I need someone to love me/
the whole day through."
The crowd's response early in the show to
"Don't Be Denied" was matched post
intermission by "Powderfinger," a Dylan—like
ballad from Rust Never Sleeps, followed by the
classic "Ohio."
Both his voice and the pictures on the giant
T.V. screen changed radically after "Ohio."
Electronics muffled the voice, patterns of col
ored lines moved on the screen and dark,
punk-style glasses hid the characteristicallly tel
ling eyes. When Young played "Transformer
Man, he had been transformed. He seemed
stiff and angry; if there was a smile on his face, it
was sarcastic.
From that point on, Young taunted us by play
ing some of his best songs — only to revert to
electric mutations from Trans. After "Trans
former Man," he gracefully (and fortunately)
took off the shades and played "My, my, hey,
hey (out of the blue)." Even though the song was
written about Elvis Presley, it seemed Young was
trying to tell us something about himself: "Hey
hey, my my/Rock and roil can never die/There's
more to the picture/ Than meets the eye."
Young's new electronic album, and his tour,
will doubtlessly be called "courageous." He has
already been praised for his "innovation" be
cause he is able to conform to the times and
create electronic music while remaining true to
his style. The only "courageous" thing about
this concert was the fact that Young was able to
take the stage and captivate a crowd by himself.
But he didn't do it through dark sunglasses and
synthesized music; he did it by singing the gen
tle poetry which brought him fame.

electric mutations from Trans. After "Trans
former Man," he gracefully (and fortunately)
took off the shades and played "My, my, hey,
hey (out of the blue)." Even though the song was
written about Elvis Presley, it seemed Young was
trying to tell us something about himself: "Hey
hey, my my/Rock and roil can never die/There's
more to the picture/ Than meets the eye."
Young's new electronic album, and his tour,
will doubtlessly be called "courageous." He has
already been praised for his "innovation" be
cause he is able to conform to the times and
create electronic music while remaining true to
his style. The only "courageous" thing about
this concert was the fact that Young was able to
take the stage and captivate a crowd by himself.
But he didn't do it through dark sunglasses and
synthesized music; he did it by singing the gen
tle poetry which brought him fame.
