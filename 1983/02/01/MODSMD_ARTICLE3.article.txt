# Students chosen for the queen's lunch guest list
## 
### JULIE RYAN Staff writer 
Students who are hoping to lunch
with the queen can stop checking
their post office boxes and start lis
tening for a phone call, although
University officials have telephoned
most of the 16 students and 12 alter
nates who were chosen to attend the
lunch.
The group includes Rhodes Schol
ars, student politicians and one pair
of freshmen who lobbied for an invi
tation with scones, poems and a
telegram.
President Donald Kennedy and a
small group of advisors made the
final choice, said Marlene Wine, as
sistant to the president. She said they
tried to invite a diverse and balanced
group of students.
Almost 200 students wrote letters
requesting an invitation, Wine said.
All of them will receive a letter by the
end of the week informing them of
the Kennedys' decision.
According to Donald Stokes,
academic writer with University
News and Publications, no official list
will be out until people respond.
"You don't announce a guest list
until you find out if the people can
come or not," he said.
According to Council of Presi
dent's (COP) member Mark Epstein,
the COP was told last Friday that two

of the four COP members could at
tend the lunch.
The group decided that Epstein
and Yolanda Townsend would at
tend. Although Epstein said the
selection process .they used was
"confidential," he said it followed a
long discussion and was partly ran
dom. When asked for his reaction to
the invitation, Epstein said "I'm
easygoing about it to tell you the
truth."
Richard Klingler, former Daily
editor and Rhodes Scholar, was con
tacted this Saturday. Klingler said he
is "looking forward to it."
Bill Halter, another Rhodes Schol
arship winner, also reportedly re
ceived an invitation.
Andy Messing, an ASSU senator,
said he received an invitation over
the phone last Friday. He said he
"scribbled" a letter to Kennedy a half
hour before the deadline, "They told
me I'd be getting a lot of information
in the mail about protocol; how to
sit, how to stand (etc.)."
The 12 students chosen as alter
nates will attend the lunch "if for
some reason more spaces become
available or if some students aren't
able to attend," according to Wine,
although "so far no one has said no."
Freshman Karen Adams was in
formed that she is number two on
the alternate list and Ridley Wills,
also a freshman, is number three.
"We bothered President Kennedy
for 10 days," she said. "We sent him a
cake, a telegram, poems, and an En
glish breakfast. ... It was satisfying
to see that our persistence paid off in
the long run."
Adams said that Mrs. Kennedy told
her that she has "a good chance to
move up."
