# Pub Board refuses to enact ASSU guidelines
## 
### KIMBERLY BROWN Senior staff writer 
Publications Board members last night voted unani
mously against the senate's recommendation that they
formulate regulations governing student publications'
endorsements of ASSU candidates during elections.
The senate had requested the Pub Board to draw up
rules which would at least ensure that all candidates
were interviewed and specify the length of the inter
views.
The issue involves basic questions of government
control and editorial policy — and triggered heated reac
tion from representatives of the various publications
present.
The senate's suggested policy stemmed from dissatis
faction among some senate members who felt they were
treated unfairly during endorsement interviews, accord
ing to COP representative Mark Epstein.
Epstein said "several irregularities" were reported to
the election commission last year. The main incident
involved the Stanford Independent, which he said,

failed to interview all the candidates and cover all the
issues. In addition, those who were interviewed were
reportedly not given equal time.
Basically, the senate recommended that the Pub
Board enforce "open-ended guidelines," Epstein said.
"We wanted to ensure that publications would be re
sponsible fo," certain sorts of rules and regulations when
endorsing candidates."
The actual form the rules were to take was to be left to
the discretion of the Pub Board itself — an arm of the
ASSU, although its representatives come from the vari
ous student publications which receive ASSU funding.
In the eyes of the editors present last night, however,
the senate's suggestion was threatening to their basic
editorial autonomy.
The endorsement guidelines would imply that "politi
cians would have control over how publications rate
politicians," said former Daily editor Richard Klingler.
"Since the Daily plays a major role in the endorsement
process, it is unfortunate that other
publications would be caught in the
middle," he said.
In response to the assertion that he
was "imposing a legalistic system of
control and subservience" over pub
lications, Epstein said, "We are not
telling you who to nominate, just
how to go about nominating."
"We are not attempting to bias the
endorsement process," Epstein con
tinued, "all we are trying to do is to
ensure that publications police
themselves to conform."
But according to Jordan Bender of
Up Front magazine, "once the senate
starts regulating any editorial policy
— who is to say that the senate
shouldn't be allowed to dictate all
editorial content?"
Other editors also expressed the
concern that certain members of the
senate were tryingto exert more than
their due authority. Former editor of
the Progressive Larry Ausubel said,
"Certain people in the ASSU seem to
have a desire to control other things
as much as they can."
"Basically, they like to impose a lot
of rules," Ausubel said.

The money allocated to publica
tions by the Pub Board is given to the
Pub Board by the ASSU. According to
Epstein, "When the ASSU gives
money to a publication, we give it on
the basis that the publication will be
somehow worthy of students' fund
ing," Epstein said.
Therefore, as far as editorial policy
goes, "the ASSU does assume some
responsibility," he said.
There is a general concern among
senate members, Epstein said, that
some publications may try to sway
segments of the University in their
election decisions. Specifically,
smaller publications with political
slants may favor those candidates
whose views coincide more with
their general editorial views.
"What we're afraid of is somebody
endorsing progressives and some
body endorsing conservatives," Eps
tein said.
In response to the accusation that
some conservatives or progressives
could be slighted by publications,
David Eisner, editor of the Stanford
Review said, "I don't think that they
should bar candidates from seeking
the help of student publications.
Certainly every group on campus has
their own bias, just as every candi
date does."
