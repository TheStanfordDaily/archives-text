# Frosh deface Zapata mural
## 
### JEFF BIDDULPH Senior staff writer 
Residents of Casa Zapata found an
unwelcome addition to a mural in
their dining hall Saturday morning —
crude features had been drawn on
the formerly blank face of a white
woman depicted in the painting.
Their reaction was primarily one of
anger.
"They (the people who defaced
the mural) don't understand what it
means," said Sylvia Scan lon, a theme
associate at Zapata. "For Chicanos
here it's like defacing a Picasso."
Two Donner freshmen, Ted Davis

and Tom Murray, later admitted they
painted eyes, a nose and a mouth on
the mural which shows the faceless
white woman between two Hispanic
women, one young and one old.
But for two days no one in Zapata
knew who had vandalized the mural.
It was the third time the large, con
troversial work, titled "A Reaction to
Violence and Institutional Racism in
the Media," had been altered, and
many residents were disturbed by
the vandalism, according to Resident
Assistant Michael Lighty.
Davis and Murray said at the time
they didn't think anybody would be

upset by their alteration of the mural.
"It was just a spur of the moment
thing to do," Davis said. "We weren't
trying to offend anyone, it was a
stupid thing to do."
"It was just a harmless prank,"
Murray said. "We didn't understand
the implications of it."
At first, Murray denied partici
pating in the prank, but last night
both told the Daily they had altered
the mural.
Davis said there was "no feminist
or racial slur" behind the deface
ment of the mural, and they offered

to paint over the markings they had
made. Davis also said he and Murray
would talk to the Resident Fellow
(RF) at Zapata, Arturo Pacheco, about
the incident.
Scanlon said that many whites —
both in the dorm and outside of it —
are offended by the mural because
they misinterpret its message. "I'm
white and I'm not offended by it,"
she said.
