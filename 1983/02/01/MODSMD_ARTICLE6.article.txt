# ASSU bill restricts elections, refunds and fee assessments
## 
### DOUGLAS JEHL Senior staff writer 
The 25-page election reform measure re
cently enacted by the senate is the most sig
nificant part of a concerted ASSU effort to
ensure that this spring's election is free of
the chaos and recriminations that charac
terized last year's contest.
It is also representative of a growing trend
toward increasing ASSU restrictions on stu
dent groups in the name of "accountability"
to the student government.
Drawn up in response to a senate resolu
tion and student comments expressing dis
satisfaction with the way last spring's elec
tion was conducted, the bill, after some revi
sions, was approved unanimously last Tues
day.

Nearly four times longer than the by-laws
section it replaces, the measure details
nearly everything about how an ASSU elec
tion is to operate. Together with a constitu
tional amendment approved last spring and
the fee assessment implementation bill
likely to be approved next month, the re
form bill will change the shapeof ASSU elec
tions this April and in years to come.
Senators and representatives of groups
interviewed by the Daily agree that the most
important changes will come in the follow
ing areas:
• Fee assessments. No longer must groups
request funding on a "dollar-per student
per quarter basis." Assessments can be
granted for any amount greater than $4000.
• Refunds. As a result of a constitutional

amendment last spring, only students who
vote — or are unable to vote — will be enti
tled to refunds of fee assessments granted
this spring.
• Ballot access for fee assessment groups.
In a change from previous practice, all
groups will be required to circulate peti
tions. Those who submit to the senate peti
tions containing 10 percent of the signatures
of the student body will have their budgets
subject to senate approval; those groups
gathering 20 percent must still submit
budgets, but they will go only to the elec
tions commission to ensure that they are
sufficiently "detailed."
• Ballot access for candidates. All candi
dates will be required to gather more signa
tures on their petitions with the exception of

graduate senators, who will have to submit
either 10 or none, depending on their de
partment affiliation. (The purpose is to get
more graduate students to declare them
selves to be candidates, according to Joseph
Hughes, one of four reform-bill authors). All
candidates, however, will now be required
to sign a declaration of intent to become
eligible for election.
• Slates. Senate candidates must run indi
vidually; they will no longer be permitted to
run as members of slates.
• Announcement of results. Because the
more complicated ballot will require a more
sophisticated scanner for counting, and be
cause declarations of candidacy for those
receiving write-in votes will be solicited until
9 p.m. the day after the election, results will

not be announced until that time.
• Grievances. A newly established Hearing
Committee will listen to charges of viola
tions of election rules and can recommend
disqualification to the senate.
Supporters said this vast array of changes
is necessary because "last year's election
was a fiasco."
"We need to ensure that we never have
that problem again . . . and I don't think we
can have a bad election if we follow these
guidelines," said senator Hughes.
Elections commissioner Craig Spearman
echoed Hughes' opinions. "It's very impor
tant that the student body be assured that an
election can be handled . . . it's very impor
tant that nothing go wrong."
