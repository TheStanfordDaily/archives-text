Reagan presents 1984 budget
Washington — President Reagan today unveiled a
deficit-choked $848.5 billion budget plan for 1984 in
which the entire spending increase would be ab
sorbed by the military and higher interest charges on
the national debt.
Reagan, lamenting eye-popping budget deficits to
talling $590 billion over the next three years, invited
Congress yesterday to join in politically painful
bipartisan measures to keep red-ink spending from
soaring even further and wrecking an "imminent" ec
onomic recovery.
In sending his new $848.5 billion spending plan to
Capitol Hill, however, the president appeared to em
bark on a collision course with many lawmakers. He

did so by standing firm on his proposed $30 billion in
crease in Pentagonspendingwhilecallingforafreeze
or reduction in spending for many social programs
and opposing any new jobs programs. He said he re
mains "adamantly opposed" to a public jobs bill, the
first order of business on Capitol Hill.
In contrast to last year, the president cultivated
Congressional goodwill by not seeking again to re
duce programs that the legislators have protected in
the past, such as student loans and special education
programs for the handicapped.
Despite a $189 billion deficit projection for fiscal
1984, the year he once pledged would show a surplus,
the president declared: "The stage is set; a recovery
to vigorous, sustainable, noninflationary economic
growth is imminent.

"Steadily and unmistakably, our national economy
is completing the transition from recession to re
covery," he said.
Reagan held out some hope for a balanced budget
by 1988, saying that a slightly stronger economic
growth rate would put the federal government in the
black in that year for the first time since 1969.
Reagan proposed to increase spending in the new
fiscal year by $43.3 billion — or a modest 5.4 percent
from fiscal 1983, which ends Sept. 30.
The increase, an amount adequate only to cover
the expected rate of inflation, equaled the combined
rise devoted to defense and interest on the national
debt. That left all domestic spending — on balance —
frozen at or below this year's levels.
Programs for the poor — including food stamps,

welfare and child nutrition — woulH be i educed. An
nual cost-of-living raises for Social Security and other
pension and disability programs would be delayed six
months. Overall spending on farm programs, energy
and the environment, education and job training
would fall.
Government and military salaries and pensions
would be frozen for a year.
