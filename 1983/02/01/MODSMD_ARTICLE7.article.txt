Reagan presents 1984 budget
Washington — President Reagan today unveiled a
deficit-choked $848.5 billion budget plan for 1984 in
which the entire spending increase would be ab
sorbed by the military and higher interest charges on
the national debt.
Reagan, lamenting eye-popping budget deficits to
talling $590 billion over the next three years, invited
Congress yesterday to join in politically painful
bipartisan measures to keep red-ink spending from
soaring even further and wrecking an "imminent" ec
onomic recovery.
In sending his new $848.5 billion spending plan to
Capitol Hill, however, the president appeared to em
bark on a collision course with many lawmakers. He

did so by standing firm on his proposed $30 billion in
crease in Pentagonspendingwhilecallingforafreeze
or reduction in spending for many social programs
and opposing any new jobs programs. He said he re
mains "adamantly opposed" to a public jobs bill, the
first order of business on Capitol Hill.
In contrast to last year, the president cultivated
Congressional goodwill by not seeking again to re
duce programs that the legislators have protected in
the past, such as student loans and special education
programs for the handicapped.
Despite a $189 billion deficit projection for fiscal
1984, the year he once pledged would show a surplus,
the president declared: "The stage is set; a recovery
to vigorous, sustainable, noninflationary economic
growth is imminent.

"Steadily and unmistakably, our national economy
is completing the transition from recession to re
covery," he said.
Reagan held out some hope for a balanced budget
by 1988, saying that a slightly stronger economic
growth rate would put the federal government in the
black in that year for the first time since 1969.
Reagan proposed to increase spending in the new
fiscal year by $43.3 billion — or a modest 5.4 percent
from fiscal 1983, which ends Sept. 30.
The increase, an amount adequate only to cover
the expected rate of inflation, equaled the combined
rise devoted to defense and interest on the national
debt. That left all domestic spending — on balance —
frozen at or below this year's levels.
Programs for the poor — including food stamps,

welfare and child nutrition — woulH be i educed. An
nual cost-of-living raises for Social Security and other
pension and disability programs would be delayed six
months. Overall spending on farm programs, energy
and the environment, education and job training
would fall.
Government and military salaries and pensions
would be frozen for a year.
Reagan wants Andropov meeting
West Berlin — In "an open letter to the people of
Europe," President Reagan has offered to meet with
Soviet leader Yuri Andropov "wherever and when
ever he wants in order to sign an agreement banning
U.S. and Soviet intermediate-range, land-based nu
clear missile weapons from the face of the earth."
Vice President George Bush unexpectedly read the
letter at the end of a televised dinner speech here last
night, and the 600 invited guests, including West Ger
man Chancellor Helmut Kohl, rose in applause.
Praising Reagan's letter as "a testimony of the de
sire for peace of our American friends," Kohl said he
thought he could speak for a majority of West Ger
mans and many in East Germany in hoping that Rea
gan's offer will find "an open ear and outstretched
hand" in Moscow.
The Soviet Union has flatly dismissed Reagan's
"zero-zero" plan, which he proposed in November
1981 for banishing medium-range nuclear missiles on
both sides in Europe. With his letter, Reagan is again
inviting Andropov to sign something he has rejected.
But the dramatic revelation here of Reagan's letter
and Bush's visit to six North Atlantic Treaty Organiza
tion countries that began Monday are part of a major
new U.S. effort to seize the initiative from the Soviets
in the battle for public opinion in Western Europe.
NATO officials believe Andropov has been skillful
ly playing on fears about 572 new U.S. missiles to be
deployed in Western Europe to balance about6oo So
viet missiles already in place. Western officials believe
Moscow still hopes to halt deployment of U.S.
missiles through pressure of public opinion rather
than through a negotiated agreement.
Striking truckers protest fuel tax
Washington — Independent truckers protesting in
creases in federal fuel taxes and highway user fees
began a nationwide strike yesterday by pulling their
rigs off the highways.
There were scattered reports of violence, from
gunshots fired at moving trucks to smashed wind
shields and nails strewn on highways, in almost a
dozen states from Oregon to Alabama.
Mike Parkhurst, president of the Van Nuys, Califor
nia-based Independent Truckers Association, pre
dicted at a Washington press conference that 50,000
to 75,000 of the nation's 100,000 independent owner
operators had parked their trucks since the strike,
which officially began at midnight Sunday.
But Parkhurst's figures were challenged by Secre
tary of Transportation Drew Lewis, who said his re
ports showed that only 20 percent of the independent

truckers had heeded the strike call by midday yester
day.
The independent truckers' protest — not sup
ported by the regulated truckers or the Teamsters
Union — centers on a law passed last year that im
poses a 5-cents-per-gallon hike in fuel taxes on April
1, and increases highway user fees for heavy trucks
beginning July 1985.
The independent operators, who comprise about
15 percent of the nation's truckers, haul 90 percent of
the country's food and cattle, 85 percent of its long
haul household goods and about half of the steel that
moves by truck, according to the Independent
Truckers Association. The independents contend that
the new federal taxes will raise their operating costs
and force many of them out of business.
The administration, on the other hand, believes
that truckers will be the biggest beneficiaries of high
ways improved with funds from the higher taxes, and
that they should in turn pay a larger share of taxes and
user fees because they do the most damage to the
roads.
Reagan proposes military buildup
Washington — President Reagan yesterday guaran
teed a continued national debate about defense
spending by asking Congress to appropriate a sizable
downpayment on a new five-year military buildup. It
would require $1.77 trillion in budget authority and
$1.55 trillion in actual spending from fiscal 1984
through 1988.
Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger and Gen.
John Vessey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said
in separate reports that the United States must spend
such record-high, peacetime amounts in response to
a relentless Soviet military buildup.
Soviet forces have grown so strong, Weinberger
said in his annual report to Congress, that "they now
seem capable of mounting roughly concurrent of
fensives against Western Europe and southwest Asia.
"If Soviet conventional forces attacked or tied
down allied forces in these two critical theaters," he
said, "North Korea might then take advantage of the
situation and launch an offensive with their numer
ically superior ground and tactical air forces against
the Republic of Korea."
While stressing that the Reagan rearmament pro
gram calls for bolstering non-nuclear weaponry of
the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps — partly
to forestall any inclination to engage in nuclear war —

Weinberger also outlined an $18.2 billion program to
beef up the strategic forces for waging nuclear war if
deterrence fails.
About one-third of that total would go for the MX
intercontinental ballistic missile, for which a basing
plan is to be recommended this month.
Weinberger's rhetoric about waging nuclear war
was softened markedly in comparison with his public
report last year and his secret guidance to the military
services. The guidance included statements about
preparing to fight a "protracted" nuclear war, a con
cept that critics said was dangerous and unsound.
Reagan requests tax increases
Washington — President Reagan's new budget
continuesthe tax turnaround he began last year,seek
ing tax increases that would add up to $11.2 billion in
1984, $11.3 billion in 1985 and $61.3 billion in 1986.
The largest of these in the first two years would
come in Social Security taxes; employer-paid health
insurance premiums over certain amounts would also
be treated as income and taxed for the first time. And
in the third year, unless the deficit falls in the mean
time more than predicted, there would be an income
surcharge and new excise tax on oil.
The tax increases are a reversal of the drive to re
duce tax burdens that the administration brought to
office. In 1981 Reagan pushed to passage a bill reduc
ing tax liabilities a total of $609 billion from 1982 to
1986. Last year, however, he supported two bills rais
ing taxes a total of $163.1 billion over the same period,
in effect taking back 27 percent of the 1981 cut.
If Reagan wins approval of all the new increases
called for in the current budget, he will have raised
taxes by a total of $246.9 billion for 1982 through 1986.
In effect, he would have taken back 40.5 percent of his
1981 cut.
This take-back percentage would also rise as the
years go on. Thus if all the new increases in the budget
were to take effect, the net Reagan tax cut by fiscal
1986 would bejust42 percent of what was promised in
the 1981 bill.
Federal revenues this fiscal year will be an esti
mated 18.7 percent of Gross National Product, one of
the lower figures in recent years. But by fiscal 1986
they are projected to move back to 20.3 percent,
which is about where they were when Reagan took
office and the third highest level since 1969 when
Congress at Lyndon Johnson's behest approved a 10
percent income surtax to help finance the Vietnam

war. That surtax lifted revenues to 20.5 percent of
GNP. In fiscal 1981 and 1982, they were 20.9 and 20.4
percent.
EPA threatens sanctions
Washington — The Environmental Protection
Agency put 144 counties in 31 states on notice yester
day that violations of clean air rules could cost them
millions of federal dollars for highway, sewer and new
construction projects.
The notice — the first stage in a lengthy process of
imposing federal sanctions — was immediately
criticized by some members of Congress as an effort
to push them into revamping the Clean Air Act, a
prime target for industry and Reagan administration
officials this session.
Rep. Henry Waxman (D-Calif.), chairman of the
Energy and Commerce health and environment sub
committee, which would initiate any rewriting of the
law in the House, accused EPA Administrator Anne
Gorsuch of "grossly distorting the Clean Air Act in an
attempt to pressure Congress into weakening the
law."
However, EPA officials, including Gorsuch, said
that the agency had no choice but to begin imposing
thesanctionson communitiesthat have failed to meet
deadlines for cleaning up the air.
"The imposition of these sanctions will be in
credibly disruptive, both economically and environ
mentally," Gorsuch said. "It is a very distasteful func
tion to me."
EPA's assistant administrator for air quality,
Kathleen Bennett, said that the EPA "is not at liberty to
look the other way" and not enforce sanctions while
Congress is considering amendments to the clean air
law.
But Bennett said the agency would proceed
cautiously in imposing the sanctions, giving states 45
days to respond to the list of violations and then pro
viding a liberal "analysis" period when the agency
would decide if the areas had provided suitable rea
sons for not losing federal funds or suffering a con
struction ban.
