## Student financiers investing the Blyth Fund money 
### COLLEEN GILLARD 
Oblivious to the music blaring outside,
the 11 around the table study charts and
exchange suggestions:
"What about placing a stop at 27 to cover
ourselves?"
"No, too high, if the market takes another
correction we'll get bounced out. Let's hold,
I think this company has potential."
If the conversation sounds like a meeting
of the board, then that is as it should.

Although the average age in
the room appears to be 20,
those present are, as presiding
directors of the Charles Blyth
Fund, responsible for the wise
and profitable investment of
nearly $90,000.

Although the average age in the room ap
pears to be 20, those present are, as presid
ing directors of the Charles Blyth Fund, re
sponsible for the wise and profitable in
vestment of nearly $90,000.
The fund was set up three years ago as an
educational experience for undergraudates
in investments and finance. Each year a new
group of students applies for directorships
on the fund, with applications for next year
due Friday.

Since its inception in lanuary 1979, the
original $75,000 fund has grown by around
$15,000. The fund was created by an
anonymous donor in honor of Blyth, who
was an investment broker and trustee of the
University.
Alan Ballweg, senior in economics/
industrial engineering and chairman of the
board, is enthusiastic about the fund: "As
far as giving you a practical opportunity to
play the market," he said, "it can't be beat. I
think we've become more knowledgeable
about how the stock market works. We're
playing with a sizable amount of money
here. This is an unquestionable learning ex
perience."
Ballweg estimates about half the group in
vests their personal savings on the side. "Of
course we're all making money," he said.
"The market is fantastic right now."
Investment decisions for the fund are
made through the give-and-take of weekly
meetings. "We share our knowledge of the
market through a group decision-making
process. Because we all have such different
backgrounds, interests and majors, we have
different things to contribute," Ballweg said.
At the request of the fund's donor, the
11-member board of directors is entirely au
tonomous from University control. If, for
example, the board runs into bad luck and
the fund shrinks to zero, then that would be
it. The University does, however, provide
advisers to the group who occasionally re
view the fund's financial statements. Advis
ers are: Rod Adams, director of finance;
Margaret Ann Fidler, assistant dean of stu

dent affairs; and David Stone, retired busi
nessman.
A sister Blyth Fund was set up at Occiden
tal College a year betore Stanford's. Ballueg
said the Occidental group actually lost a
sizeable amount their first year. The foun
der, in reimbursing them, warned that
would be the last time. Although Stanford
lost $51 last year, Ballweg continued, they
actually beat the market, since the market
was down 25 percent over that same period.
The fund's income is split between the
University, the board and the fund, with 50
percent going to board-authorized ex
penses, 25 percent going to the University as
a scholarship donation and 25 percent being
plowed back into the fund.

The fund is not fully invested.
'If you have cash as part of it,
you have flexibility as well as
stability and conservatism/

Investment ideas are generated by mem
bers, who prepare proposals for meetings.
Sometimes, Ballweg said, individuals come
in with ideas and advice from their own
brokers. The Wall Street Journal provides
additional leads. The group also consults
brokers Jon Krass and Susan Klar of E.F. Hut
ton, Palo Alto, and William Husa of Emmet
Larkin, Chico.
Members bring in speakers from the fi
nancial community, brokers, investment

managers, University financial adminis
trators and professors from the Business
School, to their meetings on Mondays at
noon and Thursdays at 7 p.m. in Tresidder.
Meetings are open to the public.
The group is proud ot its sophistication.
Computerized summaries of the fund's
status report declare that the group has ac
crued an annualized yield of 34 percent. Al
though good, it still trails the Dow Jones
Industrial Average by 20 percent.
"Although we haven't been getting as
much from our interest-bearing accounts as
we had in the past, and although we sus
tained losses from other stock options, our
real problem was Warner Communica
tions," Ballweg explained. "If you re
member, Warner Communications just got
nailed. Warner owns Atari, which has been
accused of misrepresenting their prof
itability. When security analysts found out
they drastically lowered their earning proj
ects. Atari's stock prices plummeted. We
just got blown away. We didn't sell . . . we
were reluctant to sell, because we figured it
couldn't go any lower. It did. I guess you'd
have to call it a learning experience. Vou
learn from losses as well as gains."
One important thing, according to
Ballweg is that the fund is not fully invested.
The fund presently has 17 positions in its
portfolio. "If you have cash as part of it, you
have flexibility as well as stability and con
servatism/'Ballweg said. This also means you
won't beat the market â€” but then again it
won't beat you."
Fidler said board members come from all
backgrounds, but share a common interest

in business: "Some, in the past, have ownet
their own businesses, others merely inves
their savings. We had one native Americar
woman trom Alaska whose tribe had finan
rial interests that needed management. Sht
needed the skills she was learning in the
Blyth Fund to help her tribe when she re
turned."
The idea of an investment club is new. Tht
University did not solicit the gift that startec
the Blyth Fund, the donor approached tht
University with the idea. The conditions o
the gift limit the opportunity to under
graduates.
It is a honor, Fidler adds, to be elected t(
the board. She is pleased that the high stan
dards of responsibility required by such ar
undertaking, have been honored.
