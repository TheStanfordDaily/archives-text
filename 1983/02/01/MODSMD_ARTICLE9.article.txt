### JAN BENJAMIN 
A night at the Waldorf As
toria. Tickets to a Broadway
play. Dinner at Sardi's Not
to mention a round trip air
li< ket San Francisco-New
Vork. All this tor $2? Sound
too incredible? Maybe just
optimistic.

More than 400 Big
Apple-hound hopefuls,
some sporting tuxedos,
packed their bags and
brought them to last Fri
day's Suitcase Party, spon
sored by Tresidder Union
and Sequoia Travel Agency.
The party, part of the cele
bration honoring Tresid
der s 20th anniversary, was
the inspiration of Nancy
Howe, assistant director of
Tresidder.
"Everyone coming to the
party had the chance to be
leaving for New York at the
end of the night," Ted Hoef,
marketing coordinator of
Tresidder said. "The real
k'i ker to the thing was that
they leave immediately."
Other prizes awarded in
i luded free weekend rental
ol outdoor equipment,
tickets to a Graduate Stu
dents Association film
series and tickets to a Lively
Arts performance. These
prizes and others were raf
fled prior to the New Vork
trip drawing.
"Ail week long, we kept
laying we were going to
win," said junior Jenny
lohnson, co-winner of the
New York trip

But she and and junior
Ted Hopper did not bring
suitcases to the party. Not to
worry. A chauffeur-driven
limo escorted the two lucky
winners back to their resi
dences to collect their be
longings, then brought
them to San Francisco Air
port. Unfortunately, flights
were postponed due to bad
weather, and the two stu
dents had to spend the
night at the airport Sheraton
— where they registered as
Mr. and Mrs. S. (for
Sequoia) Prize.
"We did get some funny
looks," Hopper said.
An early morning flight
brought them into JFK air
port that evening, but too
late to make the opening
curtain of "Good," the
Broadway show included in
the trip.
Registration at the Wal
dorf Astoria was another af
fair.
"Everything was pre
paid," Hopper said. "But
when we got to the Waldorf,
where we registered again
as Mr. and Mrs. Prize, they
asked for a credit card — to
cover the room occupation
tax — $1.17. We finally had
to explain the situation."
They arrived for dinner at
Sardi's in time to catch
glimpses of the "beautiful
people" just coming from
the theater, according to
Hopper. A walk around
Times Square culminated
the two Californians' first
night in New Vork.
"Anything could have
happened on that trip, and
it wouldn't have mattered. It
was amazing," said Hopper.
Hoef said he was pleased
with the response to the
party. Asked about repeat
performances, he said, "the
opportunity is there to do
something like this in the fu
ture."
