# Labor dispute settled
## 
### ALAN TRIPP Senior staff writer 
Another chapter in the long history
of dispute between United Stanford
Workers and the University
came to an end last week when USW
agreed to post notices reminding
members not to participate in illegal
picketing of construction sites.
USW agreed to post the notices for
60 days as part of a settlement with
the National Labor Relations Board
following a University complaint.
The complaint, which would have
been heard by an administrative law
judge March 24, claimed that USW
picketing during last fall's strike
against the University "was not only
directed against the primary
employer, the University, but also
against secondary neutral employers
in hopes of enmeshing them into the
conflict and coercing the University
into succumbing to the union's ob
jectives."
"At this point a settlement was in
the best interests of everyone," said
Susan De Jongh-Kearl, University as
sociate staff counsel, who handled
the case. "It's best to go forward with
the relationship without the possibil
ity of a trial hanging over our heads."
Michael Baratz, USW president,
had a different perspective on the
notices: "Sure, the outcome is fine.
Still, as far as we're concerned, what
we did was legal." USW would en
gage in secondary picketing again,
Baratz added, "if it was necessary."
Another NLRB complaint, this one
protesting University conduct, will
be heard March 3. The complaint re
sulted from USW charges that hospi
tal management "unlawfully interro
gated an employee concerning the
filing of a grievance and that the Uni
versity maintained a discriminatory
rule concerning the posting of union
materials."
Baratz said this complaint will not
be withdrawn.
