# Students apply principles to civilian life

### 
The quiet and safe atmosphere of the Univer
sity seems very removed from the prisons of
North Vietnam, yet students have found that
Vice Admiral James Stockdale's class, "Combat
ting Manipulation and Coercion," does have
some practical applications to everyday life.
Sophomore Scott Vitt, a class member,
said,"The class has made me more aware of
coercion and manipulation around me, maybe
not on the same scale that Stockdale faced, but
on a different level, for example the living situa
tions here. In the dorms there are pressure situ
ations where others are trying to get you to give
in. It's important to hold onto what you be
lieve."
Other students said they have found the class
to be a unique and different way of learning.
Sophomore Garin Veris said, "It is a class where

we can see what Stock dale s done and apply it to
our own lives as we experience similar things
around us." Susan Compton said the class is
interesting and practical. "Stockdale's first
hand experiences prove more interesting than
some courses here because of his validity . . .
We are learning how to deal with certain pres
sures in the outside world in such situations as
athletics and business," she said.
The combination of practical ideas, academic
setting and Stockdale's fascinating experience
make the seminar a success Sophomore Kevin
Solliday said, "The reason I took the class is
because I like the idea of sitting around with
someone addressing the big issues. You can sit
around a lot here and address philosophy and
the humanities but Stockdale has actually been
through it."
