## The
						Stanford Daily Election bill needs reform 
### 
On Jan. 25 the ASSU Senate passed a long
awaited and long-overdue bill reforming the en
tire ASSU elections process. While we applaud
the ASSU's efforts in the complex task of design
ing an immense piece of legislation, we also find
problems with several aspects of the new elec
tion system.
For example, the new regulations direct all
student organizations wishing to apply for fee
assessments to submit a detailed line-item
budget to the ASSU elections commission for
approval. This is an unnecessarily stringent in
terpretation of the ASSU constitution, which
specifies that a detailed budget, rather than a
detailed line-item budget, be approved by the
Council of Presidents (COP), not by the elec
tions commission. Instead of the senate de
legating the COP's responsibility in this area to
the elections commission, it should give this
authority to the people who will pay for a part of
these budgets, the students.
Further, the senate should interpret more
broadly the part of the constitution regarding
the type of budget to be used. Instead of forcing
student groups to submit detailed line-item
budgets, the senate shoud accept a budget that
explains an organization's revenues and expen
ditures and not each individual item of that
budget. We believe that giving students the
chance to see a group's general budget guide

lines is sufficient for election purposes.
The new regulations are especially harsh be
cause the budget is due almost six months be
fore the fiscal year for which it is written. This is
an overly burdensome task for many groups
because even the ASSU has had trouble fore
casting its own budget so far in advance.
Another clause of the bill directs the Publica
tions Board, which is an ASSU body, to formu
late guidelines for student publications that
want to endorse any person or organization in
an election. We applaud the Pub Board's refusal
to do this, but we fear that somehow the senate
will institute the rules over the unanimous ob
jection of the Pub Board.
That this board, or any other body, should be
allowed to interfere in a student publication's
editorial process is objectional and offensive to
us both as journalists and as subscribers to the
notion of the freedom of the press.
Despite these problems, this bill is a good
step toward reforming the ASSU's elections
process which, after last spring's poorly run
election, was in desperate need of reform.
Many parts of the bill will make for efficiently
run elections. However, we see serious prob
lems in attempts by the ASSU to extend its influ
ence over independent student organizations.
The ASSU should try to run elections and not
other student groups.
