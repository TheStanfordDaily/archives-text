## MNCs harm less developed nations 
### 
I would like to comment on prof.
Melvyn Krauss' article, "MNCs en
courage LDC development" (Daily,
lan. 19).
Krauss initiates his article by stat
ing that "the multinational corpora
tion (MNC) is the key institution in the
world economy facilitating the trans
fer of prosperity from industrialized
countries to less developed ones
(LDCs)." This, he adds, in virtue of
the technology that MNCs transfer to
the LDCs that can later be used to
produce exports; the transfer of cap
ital to the LDCs that provides em
ployment for local labor; together
with the increase in North-South
trade MNCs generate.
This is an overriding simplification.
Even in theory and under particular
assumptions it is uncertain whether
one could hold such a "transfer of
prosperity" notion. In practice,
however, a much better case can be
made for exactly the opposite argu
ment; because the technology into
duced in LDCs by multinational cor
porations tends to be highly capital
intensive and thus incredibly expen
sive. It is embedded in a vertically
integrated multinational company
that invests in an LDC not with the
aim of transferring any know-how,
but rather as a means of consolidat
ing a profitable intermediate produc
tion link within the several that con
stitute its production chain from the
raw material to the manufactured
product (as is particularly the case
with extractive industries).
Let me emphasize that a "profita
ble intermediate production link" or
base is an LDC where MNCs extract,
manufacture, or just assemble in
termediate products (in most cases
never the final product which is sold
back at X price) while at the same
time "shifting profits from high to
low-tax countries and getting around
exchange and price controls, as well
as customs duties," to do so, and I
am quoting Krauss, "constitutes the

legitimate concern of private com
panies".
Also, Krauss states that the transfer
of capital to LDCs as a result of
MNCs' direct investments provides
employment for LDC labor. I would
argue that the amount of capital in
vested in the host less-developed
country is only a fraction of what that
country eventually loses both in capi
tal and in jobs as a consequence of
the MNCs tax and price controls eva
sion, custom duties evasion, lack of
pollution and environmental restric
tions, etc., not to mention the enor
mous rates of return on investment
that are responsible for a consider
able percentage of the company's
overall profits that are never refun
neled into the LDC.
Furthermore, the most important
consequence of the multinational
corporation, says Krauss, is that the
"otherwise fragmented labor mar
kets, commodity markets and capital
markets in the south are unified with
their northern counterparts by the
multinationals to provide true world
markets for products and factors of
production."
This is preposterous. One of the
main concerns of some of the best
Latin American, U.S. and European
social scientists today has been pre
cisely the disintegrating effects
MNCs have had within developing
countries, particularly regarding
domestic labor markets, and access
by local producers and exporters to
the international markets. Further
more, concepts such as "true world
markets"and "unified" certainly re
quire some sort of qualification.
Does this mean perfectly competi
tive world markets? Is there any such
thing as a perfectly competitive
world market? If so, where?
Finally, I can't help but pause and
comment on two other assertions
that Krauss makes. The first one is
clearly a contradiction yet it also re

nects a disturbing political stance.
Within the context of criticizing
the Brandt Commission report for
raising the question of whether the
"legitimate business concerns" of
MNCs (transfer pricing, exchange
and price control evasion, customs
duties evasion) are in harmony with
the legitimate concerns of (LDC) so
ciety, Krauss takes the liberty of say
ing that "the first point to be made is
that the interest of the (LDC) gov
ernment and those of (LDC) society
do not come to the same thing."
The contradiction is obvious: the
MNC investing in an LDC has a
"legitimate business concern" to
evade all the controls the host gov
ernment may attempt to impose on it
(environmental, taxes, etc.). Fur
thermore, we all need to be re
minded, Krauss adds, that "the first
obligation of the directors and man
agers of a private corporation is to
their stockholders, and this obliga
tion would not be legitimately dis
charged if they did not take full ad
vantage of any and all legal means to
minimize taxes and avoid profit
reducing interferences with proper
commerce."
Krauss' conclusion is that the tax
hungry, profit-interfering, environ
ment-protecting LDC government is
the enemy that the country's society
must vanquish since it obstructs the
latter's well-being. Not only does this
not make sense, but what is worse is
that it leads me to conclude that
LDC's would be better off if instead
of having a democratically elected
government safeguarding the ideals
and interests of themajority of its in
habitants, they should strive to ob
tain the tutelage of EXXON, ITT,
Coca-Cola or any other MNC willing
to "take charge."

not make sense, but what is worse is
that it leads me to conclude that
LDC's would be better off if instead
of having a democratically elected
government safeguarding the ideals
and interests of themajority of its in
habitants, they should strive to ob
tain the tutelage of EXXON, ITT,
Coca-Cola or any other MNC willing
to "take charge."

I would like to comment on prof.
Melvyn Krauss' article, "MNCs en
courage LDC development" (Daily,
lan. 19).
Krauss initiates his article by stat
ing that "the multinational corpora
tion (MNC) is the key institution in the
world economy facilitating the trans
fer of prosperity from industrialized
countries to less developed ones
(LDCs)." This, he adds, in virtue of
the technology that MNCs transfer to
the LDCs that can later be used to
produce exports; the transfer of cap
ital to the LDCs that provides em
ployment for local labor; together
with the increase in North-South
trade MNCs generate.
This is an overriding simplification.
Even in theory and under particular
assumptions it is uncertain whether
one could hold such a "transfer of
prosperity" notion. In practice,
however, a much better case can be
made for exactly the opposite argu
ment; because the technology into
duced in LDCs by multinational cor
porations tends to be highly capital
intensive and thus incredibly expen
sive. It is embedded in a vertically
integrated multinational company
that invests in an LDC not with the
aim of transferring any know-how,
but rather as a means of consolidat
ing a profitable intermediate produc
tion link within the several that con
stitute its production chain from the
raw material to the manufactured
product (as is particularly the case
with extractive industries).
Let me emphasize that a "profita
ble intermediate production link" or
base is an LDC where MNCs extract,
manufacture, or just assemble in
termediate products (in most cases
never the final product which is sold
back at X price) while at the same
time "shifting profits from high to
low-tax countries and getting around
exchange and price controls, as well
as customs duties," to do so, and I
am quoting Krauss, "constitutes the

legitimate concern of private com
panies".
Also, Krauss states that the transfer
of capital to LDCs as a result of
MNCs' direct investments provides
employment for LDC labor. I would
argue that the amount of capital in
vested in the host less-developed
country is only a fraction of what that
country eventually loses both in capi
tal and in jobs as a consequence of
the MNCs tax and price controls eva
sion, custom duties evasion, lack of
pollution and environmental restric
tions, etc., not to mention the enor
mous rates of return on investment
that are responsible for a consider
able percentage of the company's
overall profits that are never refun
neled into the LDC.
Furthermore, the most important
consequence of the multinational
corporation, says Krauss, is that the
"otherwise fragmented labor mar
kets, commodity markets and capital
markets in the south are unified with
their northern counterparts by the
multinationals to provide true world
markets for products and factors of
production."
This is preposterous. One of the
main concerns of some of the best
Latin American, U.S. and European
social scientists today has been pre
cisely the disintegrating effects
MNCs have had within developing
countries, particularly regarding
domestic labor markets, and access
by local producers and exporters to
the international markets. Further
more, concepts such as "true world
markets"and "unified" certainly re
quire some sort of qualification.
Does this mean perfectly competi
tive world markets? Is there any such
thing as a perfectly competitive
world market? If so, where?
Finally, I can't help but pause and
comment on two other assertions
that Krauss makes. The first one is
clearly a contradiction yet it also re

nects a disturbing political stance.
Within the context of criticizing
the Brandt Commission report for
raising the question of whether the
"legitimate business concerns" of
MNCs (transfer pricing, exchange
and price control evasion, customs
duties evasion) are in harmony with
the legitimate concerns of (LDC) so
ciety, Krauss takes the liberty of say
ing that "the first point to be made is
that the interest of the (LDC) gov
ernment and those of (LDC) society
do not come to the same thing."
The contradiction is obvious: the
MNC investing in an LDC has a
"legitimate business concern" to
evade all the controls the host gov
ernment may attempt to impose on it
(environmental, taxes, etc.). Fur
thermore, we all need to be re
minded, Krauss adds, that "the first
obligation of the directors and man
agers of a private corporation is to
their stockholders, and this obliga
tion would not be legitimately dis
charged if they did not take full ad
vantage of any and all legal means to
minimize taxes and avoid profit
reducing interferences with proper
commerce."
Krauss' conclusion is that the tax
hungry, profit-interfering, environ
ment-protecting LDC government is
the enemy that the country's society
must vanquish since it obstructs the
latter's well-being. Not only does this
not make sense, but what is worse is
that it leads me to conclude that
LDC's would be better off if instead
of having a democratically elected
government safeguarding the ideals
and interests of themajority of its in
