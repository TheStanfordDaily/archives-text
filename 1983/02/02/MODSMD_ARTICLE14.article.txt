## Students say Freedman qualifies for tenure 
### 
In his letter (Daily, )an. 9), Norman
Wessells, dean of humanities and
science, stated that the main criteria
for tenure at Stanford is the candi
date's "quality of mind." The meas
ure of quality of mind," however, is
not a science, but a subjective judg
ment in which the judges sometimes
err We believe that the deans erred
in their decision to deny History Prof.
Estelle Freedman tenure.
As Wessells wrote in his letter, the
deans used a large body of diverse
evidence in making their decision.
Interestingly, the tenured faculty of
the History Department used the
same body of evidence to draw the
opposite conclusion, that Freedman
deserves tenure. In fact, during the
long process of decision-making and
appeal, the scholars of the history
department voted on two separate
occasions that Freedman's "quality
of mind" merits tenure. The history
department's support for Freed
man's tenure calls into question the
dean's decision for denial.
As graduate students familiar with
recent writings in American history,
we know that Freedman's schol
arship is excellent. Her work ex
plores uncharted territories. Her
latest article, a review essay solicited
bv Reviews in American History, is an
important synthesis and reconcep
tualization of the literature about
I9th century sexuality. In her path
breaking article, "Separatism as
Strategy," 112 reedman c hallenges trad

itional interpretations of the decline
of American feminism in the early
20th century. And Freedman's
award-winning book, Their Sisters'
Keepers, also provides new evidence
and insights into the nature of 19th
and early 20th century feminism.
Reviews in two major American
history journals, The lournal of
American History and Reviews in
American History, and in Signs, a
prestigious journal of feminist schol
arship, have praised the book highly.
Gerald Grob, a noted traditional
American historian, wrote: "Their
Sisters' Keepers is a significant and
important contribution to the history
of prisons and prison reform as well
as to the history of women. Well
researched, clearly written and logi
cally organized, Freedman's book
should remain the standard work on
the subject for years to come." (Re
views in American History, March
1982.)
Given the widely recognized excel
lence of Freedman's "quality of
mind" the question remains: Why
have the deans denied Freedman te
nure? Perhaps they are less familiar
than historians with Freedman's field
of research. And perhaps they do not
yet understand the importance of
feminist scholarship, the contrib
ution it makes and the challenge it
poses, to the field of American his
tory as well as to other disciplines.
As students of women's history,
we are concerned that the Stanford

History Department is suffering in
comparison with other first-rate uni
versities which have chosen to de
vote more of their resources to the
field of women's history. We are fre
quently contacted by prospective
graduate students who express con
cern about this tenure decision. One
of the top candidates for this year's
entering class rejected Stanford's
offer upon learning that Freedman
might not continue to work here. An
important fact in these prospective
students' decisions about which
school to attend is the willingness of
that University to hire and promote
feminist historians.
We sincerely believe that the
deans have erred. We urge the Uni
versity to reverse this decision.

Hats off to the Daily for its bold
suggestion that scholarship would
best be served by bringing the
wheels of instruction to a grinding
halt. I refer of course to your inspired
editorial "Copying without thought"
(Daily, |an. 19).
As you so acutely observe, when a
professor goes to the trouble of

copying 30, 50 or even 100 pieces for
a class without the paltry extra effort
of checking with each author and
paying each publisher, there is a hid
den message: "the very thoughts of
their field. . . are not worthy enough
of protection or important enough to
command the respect accorded
other efforts."
Some have said that imitation is the
sincerest form of flattery. Many have
noticed that ideas have an inherently
public quality. A few truly demented
souls have even suggested that the
free exchange of ideas is the best
thing for scholarship! But the Daily
knows better. Scholarship, like all
good things, is best served by private
ownership. Nothing has value unless
it is owned, controlled and paid for.
My only objection is that you don't
take such a brilliant idea to its logical
conclusion. Why limit your attention
to the printed word? A teacher who
quotes an author to 20 students in
lecture is doing basically the same
thing as a teacher who distributes
copies of that author's work.
In the name of scholars
everywhere, the Daily must take a
clear stand: reproduction in any
form, even speech, of an author's
work without prior payment is
wrong. Only by insisting on this can
we stop the daily rape of thousands
of authors in lecture halls across the
country.

ment in which the judges sometimes
err We believe that the deans erred
in their decision to deny History Prof.
Estelle Freedman tenure.
As Wessells wrote in his letter, the
deans used a large body of diverse
evidence in making their decision.
Interestingly, the tenured faculty of
the History Department used the
same body of evidence to draw the
opposite conclusion, that Freedman
deserves tenure. In fact, during the
long process of decision-making and
appeal, the scholars of the history
department voted on two separate
occasions that Freedman's "quality
of mind" merits tenure. The history
department's support for Freed
man's tenure calls into question the
dean's decision for denial.
As graduate students familiar with
recent writings in American history,
we know that Freedman's schol
arship is excellent. Her work ex
plores uncharted territories. Her
latest article, a review essay solicited
bv Reviews in American History, is an
important synthesis and reconcep
tualization of the literature about
I9th century sexuality. In her path
breaking article, "Separatism as
Strategy," 112 reedman c hallenges trad

itional interpretations of the decline
of American feminism in the early
20th century. And Freedman's
award-winning book, Their Sisters'
Keepers, also provides new evidence
and insights into the nature of 19th
and early 20th century feminism.
Reviews in two major American
history journals, The lournal of
American History and Reviews in
American History, and in Signs, a
prestigious journal of feminist schol
arship, have praised the book highly.
Gerald Grob, a noted traditional
American historian, wrote: "Their
Sisters' Keepers is a significant and
important contribution to the history
of prisons and prison reform as well
as to the history of women. Well
researched, clearly written and logi
cally organized, Freedman's book
should remain the standard work on
the subject for years to come." (Re
views in American History, March
1982.)
Given the widely recognized excel
lence of Freedman's "quality of
mind" the question remains: Why
have the deans denied Freedman te
nure? Perhaps they are less familiar
than historians with Freedman's field
of research. And perhaps they do not
yet understand the importance of
feminist scholarship, the contrib
ution it makes and the challenge it
poses, to the field of American his
tory as well as to other disciplines.
As students of women's history,
we are concerned that the Stanford

History Department is suffering in
comparison with other first-rate uni
versities which have chosen to de
vote more of their resources to the
field of women's history. We are fre
quently contacted by prospective
graduate students who express con
cern about this tenure decision. One
of the top candidates for this year's
entering class rejected Stanford's
offer upon learning that Freedman
might not continue to work here. An
important fact in these prospective
students' decisions about which
school to attend is the willingness of
that University to hire and promote
feminist historians.
We sincerely believe that the
deans have erred. We urge the Uni
versity to reverse this decision.

Hats off to the Daily for its bold
suggestion that scholarship would
best be served by bringing the
wheels of instruction to a grinding
halt. I refer of course to your inspired
editorial "Copying without thought"
(Daily, |an. 19).
As you so acutely observe, when a
professor goes to the trouble of

copying 30, 50 or even 100 pieces for
a class without the paltry extra effort
of checking with each author and
paying each publisher, there is a hid
den message: "the very thoughts of
their field. . . are not worthy enough
of protection or important enough to
command the respect accorded
other efforts."
Some have said that imitation is the
sincerest form of flattery. Many have
noticed that ideas have an inherently
public quality. A few truly demented
souls have even suggested that the
free exchange of ideas is the best
thing for scholarship! But the Daily
knows better. Scholarship, like all
good things, is best served by private
ownership. Nothing has value unless
it is owned, controlled and paid for.
My only objection is that you don't
take such a brilliant idea to its logical
conclusion. Why limit your attention
to the printed word? A teacher who
quotes an author to 20 students in
lecture is doing basically the same
thing as a teacher who distributes
copies of that author's work.
In the name of scholars
everywhere, the Daily must take a
clear stand: reproduction in any
form, even speech, of an author's
work without prior payment is
wrong. Only by insisting on this can
we stop the daily rape of thousands
of authors in lecture halls across the
country.
