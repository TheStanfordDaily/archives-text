## AA plan here is inadequate 
### 
A review of the recently distri
buted Affirmative Action Plan (AAP)
causes more concern about the re
port itself and the University's per
formance. The contents of the report
and the University's lack of progress
in affirmative action are affronts to
those concerned about institutional
ethics and to those for whom the
plan was intended.
The University's lack of progress
comes as no surprise, however, in
that it is a reflection of what is occur
ring nationwide. The Chairman of
the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights
recently stated that despite a genera
tion of civil rights legislation, dis
crimination persists at an "alarming
level among women and black and
Hispanic men. . . Note that this
statement was made by a Reagan ap
pointee, which suggests that the
situation is probably far worse than
alarming.
There is one complimentary aspect
about the AAP: it does admit the fact
that the University's performance is
noticeably poor at middle and upper
management levels. An institution's
true commitment to affirmative ac
tion can only be measured by what it
does at these levels.
But here the compliments cease.
Although the AAP is beautifully out
lined and written in eviable and care
fully chosen prose, there is some
thing fundamentally lacking in its
content: there are no numbers. Fora
report like this to be meaningful, and
honest, it must contain quantitative
data, and not just discussions and
conclusions. Data must be provided
over prior years also so that trend
assessments can be made. And the
data should be further broken down
by race and sex.
Attention in this article is directed
toward the black exempt employ
ment situation because they have
lost considerable ground at Stanford
in hirings, promotions and salaries.
(Editors Note: Exempt employees re
fers to University employees hired on
a salaried basis.)
It is suspected that women and
other racial minorities have prob
lems at Stanford as well, but indi
viduals within those ranks can best
address them. On this score, how
ever, it should be noted that benign
neglect as originally coined by Con

gressman Daniel Patrick Moynihan
(D-New York) is very much in evi
dence at Stanford.
Instead of the AAP providing data
and revealing the actual status of
black exempt employment at Stan
ford, it contains euphemisms of
black people being "underutilized."
However the gravity and tragedy of
the problem is much better ex
pressed by the fact that there are
probably fewer than ten black
exempt employees in the whole of
the University who hire and fire
(other than clericals) and are respon
sible for a budget.
This is not underutilization, and it
is more than negligence. For these
voids in middle and upper manage
ment positions to exist for such long
periods of time can only be attrib
uted to design, nothing less. The ex
cuse presented by one of the offices
of the University that it cannot im
prove its performance because of
few opportunities is unacceptable.
Let us not ignore the many instances
in which positions are created at
middle and upper management
levels, only to be filled by majority
employees.
Nor is the excuse persuasive that
some black appointees are lost be
cause of competitive salaries and
cost of living, etc. If it takes addi
tional funds to bring black appoin
tees to Stanford, then allocate the
funds necessary to do so. Quite
probably this has been done for
majority appointees. It never should
have been surmised that an AAP
could be implemented at middle and
upper management levels without
additional expenses being incurred.
There are a number of critical is
sues that impact the hiring, promo
tion and salaries of black exempt
employees at Stanford. But first, at
tention should be drawn to the na
ture of many of the positions that
comprise middle and upper man
agement. If one examines the 100 or
so executive, non-faculty positions
listed in the Faculty/Staff Directory it
would be found that most of them
require mere generalists, for exam
ple, not requiring particular or highly
specialized skills.
One would be hard pressed to as

sume that there are no black people
available in quantity who could suc
cessfully fill these positions. Compe
tence levels observed among major
ity workers in these positions are cer
tainly present in abundance in black
employees. Particularly offensive,
therefore, is the following statement
by the President/Provost's office of
the University: "Comparative data
appear to indicate that some prog
ress was made toward achieving af
firmative action hiring goals estab
lished for 1981-82, despite on-going
problems encountered with the re
cruitment of qualified comptetitive
minorities for most job groups and
women for middle and senior man
agement. (Emphasis added.)
The real issue is that the University
will not hire them, and this is a
slightly different definition of the
problem. A related and equally im
portant problem to hiring black
applicants is the advancement of
black exempt employees. In most in
stances, the failure of black employ
ees to advance is due to four
phenomena. First, usually majority
employees are given privileged ac
cess to information, often referred to
as "networking." Second, rarely are
black employees given new and spe
cial opportunities that might even
tuate in advancement. Third, often
black employees are isolated in posi
tions that would otherwise require
considerable interaction, coordina
tion and teamwork.
The last phenomena is probably
the most serious. Black employees
are subjected to the whims,
stereotypes and biases of their man
agers and colleagues. How a black
employee will "fit in" or whether
they "belong" in middle and upper
managerial positions is probably
thought about and discussed more
than some might want to acknowl
edge.
Considering these phenomena,
the principle concern might not be
whether black employees ever gain
equal opportunity, but whether
majority employees will be willing to
settle for equal opportunity, and no
more, for themselves.
