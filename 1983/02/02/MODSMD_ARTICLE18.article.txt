Help Wanted
There are those of us who were a bit unnerved this week by the ad
that's been running in the Daily classified section for "paid volunteers
to give skin to aging study." "If the study's that old, why not just forget
it and start all over?" mused one Manzanita resident. However, those
students anxious to pick up a few bucks (and who are willing to relo
cate) might want to check out the help wanted section of the Daily
Texan:
Mad Dog &Beans is looking for part-time cooks for weekends
and nights.
You can "MAKE MONEY selling "Ever Fresh" food preserver,
natural honey bee pollen, bee slim weight release supplement — must
be aggressive, own car, phone, meet people."(You also must bee-hive
yourself in public, this is Texas after all )
And finally, there's another job simply advertised, "PART-TIME.
$4-$6 hr. Easy, fun atmosphere indoors. Any schedule. Apply after 1
p.m.." (You see, there are lots of positions available in Texas.)
Different Beat
It looks like the CAL-zonies attempted to drum out their frustrations
over the great post-Big Came prank with Zildjian Day, an all-day studio
drumming seminar held on campus a couple of weeks ago. (0.K., now
put the paper down and try to spell Zildjian.) Anyway, about 1500
people showed up to hear "percussion clinics" by a series of jazz
greats. No doubt the day's most revealing insight came from jazz
percussionist Tony Williams, who told an audience "as eager as he to
eliminate the drummer's second-place status," according to the Daily
Cal, "I think the drums are as beautiful as the violin. There's so much
romance on the drums."
Hang on to your card
Misuse of credit cards goes up as the economy goes down say credit
companies, as a USC fraternity has learned first-hand. The Daily Trojan
reports that a 21-year-old university student has been arrested for
forgery at the Tau Kappa Lpsilon fraternity after two house members
accused him of stealing credit cards and running up a hefty bill.
"The suspectclaimed tobea member of the fraternity, butthe others
in the house denied this and said that he is only a 'hanger on' who was
allowed to live in the house," the DT reports.
. . . Reminiscent of another 'hanger on' who last year attempted to
lure members of a fraternity here into a drug extortion scheme.

GOSH
Decrying "creeping careerism, of the sort that makes visions of
MBAs dance in an econ major's head, a student leader at Indiana
University has some pretty tough words for his colleagues who he
fears, are going into only those academic areas promising high paying
jobs.
"People come here and all they want to do is get good grades and get
the heck out of here to make the big bucks," the Indiana Daily Student
quotes a student government vice president as saying
When asked for comments on this well-documented trend in college
student attitudes, however, one student here surmised. "Holy Cow,
what a rotten thing to do. You gotta be true to yourself or you might as
well ship out. That guy really hit the nail right on the head in a big way."
Clearly, this trend is not without its harsh critics and is not likely to sit
easy in a lot of guys' craws.

Brother can you spare a. . .
Also in the latest issue of IDS comes the headline "Birth of test tube
baby facility still uncertain; officials sav plans are 'on hold' because of
lack of funds to buy the necessary equipment."
If you want to help out, don't forget to scour them thoroughly and
mark "fragile" on the mailer.
Morzart too?
UCSB students are rather vocal in expressing their preferences for
campus art. Take for instance, Robert Stahl of the university's "Campus
Beautification Coalition," who suggests a way to prevent student fee
increases.
Stahl says his campus art is "leftover scrap metal from various build
ings thrown by the bike paths" and causes "numerous bike accidents
by causing people to turn their heads to avoid their revolting glare."
"If we sold those statues to the highest paying scrap metal yards, the
funds could be used to prevent our fee increases," he writes in the
Daily Nexus.

You thought you had it bad?
"Imagine moving hundreds, maybe thousands of miles from your
home to a strange environment whereyou don't know a soul. Everyone
in your new milieu has lived there for at least four months. They have
made new friends and have adjusted to their place of residence You.
on the other hand, are alone."
To mind comes E.T., the homely yet lovable extra-terrestial, left on
earth by mistake with only a grubby handful of Reese's Pieces and a
little boy named Elliot for comfort.
But no, says page one of the Daily Pennsylvanian, "This is the plight
of the lanuary transfer student."
The squeaky floor gets the grief
Harvard's hallowed halls have harbored a hellacious hardwood
demon of late, according to the Harvard Crimson; it seems Lamont
Hall's floors are so squeaky that one anonymous plaintiff wrote on the
comment board, "I can't take it much longer. From an academic view
point, squeaky floors disturb my sensibilities. When some innocent
cretin squeaks by, my concentration level drops appreciably."
The University's head librarian, meanwhile, says the floors are
squeaky because the school can't afford to carpet them.
Well never know.. .
Page ore of the Jan. 19 Harvard Crimson shows a snowy scene in
Cambridge, Mass. and offers some helpful advicefor students wonder
ing just where they should put the white stuff:
"1) Give your roommate a present; put a shovelful in his/her bed. 2)
Leave the ice trays empty; put a fistful in your Black Russian. 3) Forget
the Union food; eat a mouthful. 4) Get a thrill; shove some snow down
your pants."
Yes, page one. I double-checked.

UCSB students are rather vocal in expressing their preferences for
campus art. Take for instance, Robert Stahl of the university's "Campus
Beautification Coalition," who suggests a way to prevent student fee
increases.
Stahl says his campus art is "leftover scrap metal from various build
ings thrown by the bike paths" and causes "numerous bike accidents
by causing people to turn their heads to avoid their revolting glare."
"If we sold those statues to the highest paying scrap metal yards, the
funds could be used to prevent our fee increases," he writes in the
Daily Nexus.

You thought you had it bad?
"Imagine moving hundreds, maybe thousands of miles from your
home to a strange environment whereyou don't know a soul. Everyone
in your new milieu has lived there for at least four months. They have
made new friends and have adjusted to their place of residence You.

To mind comes E.T., the homely yet lovable extra-terrestial, left on

little boy named Elliot for comfort.
But no, says page one of the Daily Pennsylvanian, "This is the plight
of the lanuary transfer student."
The squeaky floor gets the grief
Harvard's hallowed halls have harbored a hellacious hardwood
demon of late, according to the Harvard Crimson; it seems Lamont
Hall's floors are so squeaky that one anonymous plaintiff wrote on the
comment board, "I can't take it much longer. From an academic view
point, squeaky floors disturb my sensibilities. When some innocent
cretin squeaks by, my concentration level drops appreciably."
The University's head librarian, meanwhile, says the floors are
squeaky because the school can't afford to carpet them.
Well never know.. .
Page ore of the Jan. 19 Harvard Crimson shows a snowy scene in
Cambridge, Mass. and offers some helpful advicefor students wonder
ing just where they should put the white stuff:
"1) Give your roommate a present; put a shovelful in his/her bed. 2)
Leave the ice trays empty; put a fistful in your Black Russian. 3) Forget
the Union food; eat a mouthful. 4) Get a thrill; shove some snow down
your pants."
Yes, page one. I double-checked.



Help Wanted
There are those of us who were a bit unnerved this week by the ad
that's been running in the Daily classified section for "paid volunteers
to give skin to aging study." "If the study's that old, why not just forget
it and start all over?" mused one Manzanita resident. However, those
students anxious to pick up a few bucks (and who are willing to relo
cate) might want to check out the help wanted section of the Daily
Texan:
Mad Dog &Beans is looking for part-time cooks for weekends
and nights.
You can "MAKE MONEY selling "Ever Fresh" food preserver,
natural honey bee pollen, bee slim weight release supplement — must
be aggressive, own car, phone, meet people."(You also must bee-hive
yourself in public, this is Texas after all )
And finally, there's another job simply advertised, "PART-TIME.
$4-$6 hr. Easy, fun atmosphere indoors. Any schedule. Apply after 1
p.m.." (You see, there are lots of positions available in Texas.)
Different Beat
It looks like the CAL-zonies attempted to drum out their frustrations
over the great post-Big Came prank with Zildjian Day, an all-day studio
drumming seminar held on campus a couple of weeks ago. (0.K., now
put the paper down and try to spell Zildjian.) Anyway, about 1500
people showed up to hear "percussion clinics" by a series of jazz
greats. No doubt the day's most revealing insight came from jazz
percussionist Tony Williams, who told an audience "as eager as he to
eliminate the drummer's second-place status," according to the Daily
Cal, "I think the drums are as beautiful as the violin. There's so much
romance on the drums."
Hang on to your card
Misuse of credit cards goes up as the economy goes down say credit
companies, as a USC fraternity has learned first-hand. The Daily Trojan
reports that a 21-year-old university student has been arrested for
forgery at the Tau Kappa Lpsilon fraternity after two house members
accused him of stealing credit cards and running up a hefty bill.
"The suspectclaimed tobea member of the fraternity, butthe others
in the house denied this and said that he is only a 'hanger on' who was
allowed to live in the house," the DT reports.
. . . Reminiscent of another 'hanger on' who last year attempted to
lure members of a fraternity here into a drug extortion scheme.

Decrying "creeping careerism, of the sort that makes visions of
MBAs dance in an econ major's head, a student leader at Indiana
University has some pretty tough words for his colleagues who he
fears, are going into only those academic areas promising high paying
jobs.
"People come here and all they want to do is get good grades and get
the heck out of here to make the big bucks," the Indiana Daily Student
quotes a student government vice president as saying
When asked for comments on this well-documented trend in college
student attitudes, however, one student here surmised. "Holy Cow,
what a rotten thing to do. You gotta be true to yourself or you might as
well ship out. That guy really hit the nail right on the head in a big way."
Clearly, this trend is not without its harsh critics and is not likely to sit
easy in a lot of guys' craws.
