# Reagan budget offers funds for SLAC's linear collider
## 
### JENNIFER SEYMOUR 
The Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center (SLAC) has so far escaped the
many research cutbacks included In
President Reagan's 1984 budget
proposal. In fact, Prof. Wolfgang
Panofsky, director of SLAC, an
nounced in his State of SLAC speech
yesterday that Reagan has recom
mended $40 million be appropriated
for construction of the Stanford
Linear Collider (SLC.)
Speaking in the SLAC auditorium
yesterday morning and afternoon,
Panofsky described funding and cur
rent planning for the SLC construc-

tion as well as the continued func
tioning of current SLAC projects. Al
though he emphasized that the final
budget is undecided, Panofsky said,
"Should the Congress follow the
President's recommendations, we
can say that the speed with which we
can get SLC construction underway
will be limited mainly by our ability to
perform."
SLAC is Stanford's two-mile-long
high energy physics research center.
Although it is part of the University, it

is dependent on the government for
allofits funding. TheSLC, scheduled
for turn-on in 1986, will allow physi
cists to conduct particle research at
higher energy levels than ever be
fore, according to Panofsky.
"With SLC we are innovating a
whole new approach to getting high
energy particles," Panofsky said.
"SLC will make it possible to do the
tremendously exciting physics which
we think awaits us at this next step."
Despite the advances represented
by SLC, Panofsky stressed the impor
tance of maintaining SLAC's primary
functionsaswell: "Neitherthescien
tific community nor SLAC can afford
to have the entire research program
of the laboratory funnel into this
single area of experimentation. We
are determined that many of the
other activities of the laboratory shall
continue or be supplemented."
Panofsky's address outlined
SLAC's involvement in the PEP and
SPEAR projects, and also described
two new projects which Reagan's
budget provides funding for, con
struction of the off-axis injector and
substantial growth in the facilities at
the Stanford Synchroton Radiation
Laboratory (SSRL.)
SSRL is another independent lab
which also reports to the University.
It depends on SLAC, however, for
technical support in many areas, ac
cording to Panofsky.
SLAC will be assisting SSRL in up
grading SPEAR, SSRL's project in syn
chroton radiation work. Funding will
also be available for an off-axis injec
tor, said Panofsky, "that will make it
possible to generate low energy
beams for use of nuclear-structure
physicists and others."
Panofsky was less encouraging
about the future of SLAC's PEP prog
ram. 'The PEP program is healthy.
(But) the region of energies accessi
ble to PEP has thus far not shown up
anything truly unsuspected. . . I can
not forecast how long the PEP prog
ram will continue once the SLC is
fully operational."
Panofsky also depicted a tight
budget for continuing programs. He

stressed uncertainties involving ex
pense evaluation due to inflation,
unknown electricity costs for SLAC,
unknown construction costs for
parts of SLC and the difficulties in
knowing how Congress will respond
to Reagan's proposed budget.
He said that these uncertainties
make it difficult to predict how staf
fing at SLAC will be affected by the
new construction activities com
bined with the heavy load on con
tinuing programs. He added it was
unlikely staffing would be de
creased.
Electricity is one of SLAC's greatest
expense uncertainties, according to
Panofsky. Due to rising electricity
costs, SLAC estimates a 9.2 percent
inflation factorfor this year's budget.
"SLAC's electric power costs are
expected to increase substantially
during this period. In addition, our
access to public power will diminish
in the future."
Panofsky also discussed the de
sign, the technical challenges and
the potential finds of SLC. He em
phasized that while a core of people
will organize SLC as several sub
projects, it will involve the laborat
ory. "The answer to the question
'Who?' is 'All of us.' "
When asked to comment on the
recent particle discovery in Geneva,
Panofsky responded, "five residual
events were identified that are com
patible with a charged particle which
has been predicted to exist. This
negatively charged particle is the
counterpart of a known neutral par
ticle. . . Since it confirmed what was
expected, fewer objections have
been raised to the experiments.
More work is necessary, however,
the total verdict is not quite in."
Panofsky summarized the state of
SLAC for 1984 by saying, "all this
means is that SLAC will be involved in
three major construction activities —
the SLC, the off-axis injector and
whatever help we can give SSRL in
connection with the SPEAR upgrad
ing program. . . . Nonetheless, the
ongoing particle physics program
will continue with highest priority."

It depends on SLAC, however, for
technical support in many areas, ac
cording to Panofsky.
SLAC will be assisting SSRL in up
grading SPEAR, SSRL's project in syn
chroton radiation work. Funding will
also be available for an off-axis injec
tor, said Panofsky, "that will make it
possible to generate low energy
beams for use of nuclear-structure
physicists and others."
Panofsky was less encouraging
about the future of SLAC's PEP prog
ram. 'The PEP program is healthy.
(But) the region of energies accessi
ble to PEP has thus far not shown up
anything truly unsuspected. . . I can
not forecast how long the PEP prog
ram will continue once the SLC is
fully operational."
Panofsky also depicted a tight
budget for continuing programs. He

stressed uncertainties involving ex
pense evaluation due to inflation,
unknown electricity costs for SLAC,
unknown construction costs for
parts of SLC and the difficulties in
knowing how Congress will respond
to Reagan's proposed budget.
He said that these uncertainties
make it difficult to predict how staf
fing at SLAC will be affected by the
new construction activities com
bined with the heavy load on con
tinuing programs. He added it was
unlikely staffing would be de
creased.
Electricity is one of SLAC's greatest
expense uncertainties, according to
Panofsky. Due to rising electricity
costs, SLAC estimates a 9.2 percent
inflation factorfor this year's budget.
"SLAC's electric power costs are
expected to increase substantially
during this period. In addition, our
access to public power will diminish
in the future."
Panofsky also discussed the de
sign, the technical challenges and
the potential finds of SLC. He em
phasized that while a core of people
will organize SLC as several sub
projects, it will involve the laborat
ory. "The answer to the question
'Who?' is 'All of us.' "
When asked to comment on the
recent particle discovery in Geneva,
Panofsky responded, "five residual
events were identified that are com
patible with a charged particle which
has been predicted to exist. This
negatively charged particle is the
counterpart of a known neutral par
ticle. . . Since it confirmed what was
expected, fewer objections have
been raised to the experiments.
More work is necessary, however,
the total verdict is not quite in."
Panofsky summarized the state of
SLAC for 1984 by saying, "all this
means is that SLAC will be involved in
three major construction activities —
the SLC, the off-axis injector and
whatever help we can give SSRL in
connection with the SPEAR upgrad
ing program. . . . Nonetheless, the
ongoing particle physics program
will continue with highest priority."

The Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center (SLAC) has so far escaped the
many research cutbacks included In
President Reagan's 1984 budget
proposal. In fact, Prof. Wolfgang
Panofsky, director of SLAC, an
nounced in his State of SLAC speech
yesterday that Reagan has recom
mended $40 million be appropriated
for construction of the Stanford
Linear Collider (SLC.)
Speaking in the SLAC auditorium
yesterday morning and afternoon,
Panofsky described funding and cur
rent planning for the SLC construc-

tion as well as the continued func
tioning of current SLAC projects. Al
though he emphasized that the final
budget is undecided, Panofsky said,
"Should the Congress follow the
President's recommendations, we
can say that the speed with which we
can get SLC construction underway
will be limited mainly by our ability to
perform."
SLAC is Stanford's two-mile-long
high energy physics research center.
Although it is part of the University, it

is dependent on the government for
allofits funding. TheSLC, scheduled
for turn-on in 1986, will allow physi
cists to conduct particle research at
higher energy levels than ever be
fore, according to Panofsky.
"With SLC we are innovating a
whole new approach to getting high
energy particles," Panofsky said.
"SLC will make it possible to do the
tremendously exciting physics which
we think awaits us at this next step."
Despite the advances represented
by SLC, Panofsky stressed the impor
tance of maintaining SLAC's primary
functionsaswell: "Neitherthescien
tific community nor SLAC can afford
to have the entire research program
of the laboratory funnel into this
single area of experimentation. We
are determined that many of the
other activities of the laboratory shall
continue or be supplemented."
Panofsky's address outlined
SLAC's involvement in the PEP and
SPEAR projects, and also described
two new projects which Reagan's
budget provides funding for, con
struction of the off-axis injector and
substantial growth in the facilities at
the Stanford Synchroton Radiation
Laboratory (SSRL.)
SSRL is another independent lab
which also reports to the University.
It depends on SLAC, however, for
