# 1983 women's tennis A repeat of '82 will do
## 
### MARK ZEIGLER 
If you believe in omens,
Stanford's women's tennis
team will repeat last season's
NCAA Championship per
formance in 1983.
Coach Frank Brennan's 1982
squad, the same one that rec
orded a 20-0 dual match record
and a victory over UCLA in the
NCAA finals last spring, was
ranked fourth in the pre-sea
son polls. The 1983 team is No.
4 in the pre-season rankings as
well.
Such omens aside, the
Cardinal women netters still
might repeat as NCAA champs
based on the return of ex
perienced and improved team
members.
"I think everyone has
progressed," Brennan said of
his present squad, who de
feated Santa Clara yesterday
7-2 at Stanford Tennis Stadium.
"Everyone's picked up a bit
and that doesn't always hap
pen."
Brennan is making no prom
ises, however. Gone from last
year's squad are No. 1 Alycia
Moulton, the 1982 NCAA sin

gles champ and No. 3 Kate
Gompert, who gave up three
years of elgiblity to turn pro.
Brennan called Moulton
"probably the wom
en's player in the collegiate
ranks of all-time".
Super-subs Sue
Rasmussen and Gayle Chan
were also lost to graduation.
Nonetheless, a good portion
of the championship team is
back. The top returnee is Elise
Burgin, who was ranked No. 1
for most of last season although
she played at No. 2 behind
Moulton. Burgin sported a 10-1
dual match record in the 1982
regular season, but is rated
only fourth nationally this sea
son.
Sophomore Linda Gates will
play in the second position,
moving up from her No. 4 spot
of a year ago. Seniors Caryn
Copeland and Michelle Weiss
fill the No. 3 and No. 4 places in
a preliminary line-up, accord
ing to Brennan.
The final two singles spots
are up for grabs at the present
time. The most likely can
didates to fill them are Alison

Hardey, Jackie Joseph and
Alyce Werdel.
Burgin and Gates will make
up the No. 1 doubles team,
while Copeland and Weiss will
most likely play at No. 2. The
third doubles team is yet to be
chosen, according to Brennan,
but will probably comprise
Hardey and either Joseph or
Werdel.
Stanford competes in the
newly formed Western Col
legiate Athletic Association
(WCAA) this season, a league
which consists of both Los An
geles schools, three California
state schools — Long Beach,
San Diego and Fullerton — as

well as Arizona and Arizona
State.
Brennan said the Card's
schedule is conducive with his
philosophy of improving with
each match. Stanford faces its
easier opponents at the begin
ning of the season and plays
the toughest teams at the end.
"We sort of build with each
match," he explained.
The Cardinal began the 1983
season yesterday just where it
left off in 1982 — with a win.
The victory over the Broncos
extended Stanford's dual
match winning streak to 22.
The Cardinal won all 20
matches last season.
