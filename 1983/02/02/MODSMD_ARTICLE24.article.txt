## Swimmers win big in Texas 
### SHAILENDRA BHUMRALKER 
In what Head Coach Skip
Kenney described as a "high
light of Stanford swimming,"
the men's swimming team
proved this weekend that it is
poised to make a run at the
NCAA Championship.
On Friday and Saturday,
Stanford swam against the top
six teams in the nation at the
SMU Swimming Classic in Dal
las. SMU won the meet with
275 points, but Stanford
finished a strong second with
264.5.
In a Sunday dual meet, the
Cardinal edged out host Texas,
the top-ranked team in the na
tion, by a score of 58-55.
At the SMU Swimming Clas
sic, the Cardinal was picked to
finish fourth. "We couldn't
have won because SMU is re
ally strong, especially at
home," Kenney said. "But we
swam and raced as well as any
body."
A highlight in the competi
tion for the Card was the 800
Freestyle Relay, where Stan
ford beat UCLA with a 6:39.93
clocking. In individual races,
Dave Bottom swam well in the
100 Backstroke, finishing sec
ond to the nation's top
backstroker in 50:76. Jon De
nney also swam well in the 200
Butterfly, finishing second
with a time of 1:48.94.
Kenney was overjoyed with
Sunday's victory over the Lon
ghorns. "Beating Texas at
home was a hell of an ac
complishment," he said. "The
enthusiasm and momentum
generated by this weekend is
the best I've ever seen, and it
should carry over into the
NCAA's."
The Card 400 Medley Relay
opened the meet in spectacu
lar fashion, winning in 3:19.01,
the best time in the nation this
year by more than two sec
onds. The relay team also met

the NCAA qualifying standard.
John Simons also bettered
the NCAA standard in the 400
IM, winning in 3:57.74. Dave
Sims and Bari Weick placed 1-2
in the 500 Freestyle with times
of 4:25.24 and 4:25.89, respec
tively.
John Moffet clinched the
meet for Stanford in the 200
Breaststroke, qualifying with a
2:02.23.
The divers did well, consid
ering they were facing the best
diving team in the nation. Tom
Rothenbucher took third on
the one-meter board and sec
ond on the three-meter, the
latter finish setting up Moffet's

clinching race. "It was pleasing
to have such great support
from the diving team," Kenney
said.
Kenney said the team spirit
was exemplified by Dave Sims,
who sacrificed himself in the
1000 Freestyle by serving as a
rabbit, yet came back in the
very next race, the 200 Frees
tyle, to take third.
Though he was happy, Ken
ney warned that beating Texas
now means nothing come
March and the NCAA Champ
ionships. But as Kenney said,
"We know where we are and
where we are going."
