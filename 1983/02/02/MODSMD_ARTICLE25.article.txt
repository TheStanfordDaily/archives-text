The Stanford women's gym
nastics team gained a bit of re
venge for the football team's
controversial loss to UC-
Berkeley in the Big Game.
Officials discovered yester
day that a two-point error in
tallying the score at a four-team
meet Saturday at Berkeley val
uted the Cardinal into second
place, ahead of their cross-Bay
rivals in the team results.
Monday's Daily reported
that Cal finished second and
Stanford third in a four-team
met, with Cal scoring 173.45
points to Stanford's 172.20.
But the Berkeley officials had
a problem with their arithem
tic. Cal received two extra
points in the uneven parallel
bars, an error that allegedly oc
curred through faulty addition
of the individual scores.
This slight change was
enough toputtheCardinal one
point ahead of the Bears in the
final score. The new, official

score can now be reported as
the University of Washington
first at 174.70, Stanford second
at 172.20 and Cal third at
171.45.
Cal's two-point drop was not
enough to lower them into
fourth place, as Long Beach
State only scored 168.95.
