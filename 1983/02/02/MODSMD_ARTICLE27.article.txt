## Women's badminton star Joy Kitzmiller 
### BETH KLEID 
For freshman Joy Kitzmiller badminton is
more than the backyard sport most people think
it is â€”it is a way of life. As the top woman player
on Stanford's Club Sport badminton team and
the No. 2 junior in the nation, Kitzmiller can
shatter people's misconceptions about
badminton.
"Badminton is tougher than you think," she
said. "I hate when I tell someone that I play
badminton and they say, 'Oh, I used to play it
too, in my backyard on Sundays.' They don't
even know what competitive badminton is like.
Studies done at Washington University have

shown that badminton is the fastest racket
sport. It really is a strenuous game."
To stay in top condition for the physical
demands of badminton, Kitzmiller skips rope,
lifts weights, runs and does court drills. She
works out with the Club Sport team here for two
or three hours three nights a week, but life
hasn't always been this easy for Kitzmiller. "I
used to work out three hours a day seven days a
week. I was in intensive training, and had a
private coach," she remarked, referring to her
high school days.
Kitzmiller began her badminton career at the
age of eight. Her parents were members of the
Manhattan Beach Badminton Club in
Manhattan Beach, California, and they enrolled
her in group lessons. "My parents were always
very supportive of my badminton," she said.
"They never pushed me, which was the key to
my enthusiasm for the sport. I was
self-motivated."
Once the badminton bug had bitten
Kitzmiller there was no stopping her. At age 11
she started to play in tournaments. "I lost badly
in my first tournament, but that got me fired up
to work even harder," she said.
When only 13, Kitzmiller won the girl's
double division in the U.S. junior National
Badminton Championships, but fell short of
winning the singles title. "I used to always lose
singles, which is funny because it was what I
wanted to win the most. I like singles better than
doubles because I have only myself to rely on."
Kitzmiller got what she wanted in 1981, when
she won the girl's single division at the junior
Nationals. "That was my very favorite win. After
I won I was in shock. It took hours before it
really hit me, and then I beamed for days," she
said.
In addition to her No. 2 junior girl's singles
ranking, Kitzmiller ranks ninth among women
and second in the girl's doubles and mixed
doubles division nationally.
"Badminton has enhanced my life," she said.
"It has allowed me to travel all over the United

States and to other countries like Canada,
Mexico and Peru.
Kitzmiller did have to make sacrifices as a
result of her devotion to badminton. "I had
absolutely no social life in high school. Here I
am able to balance my sport with my social life
and my schoolwork much better," she said.
Kitzmiller said she plans to major in
mathematics. She said jokingly that what she
would really like to be is a "badminton bum."
Unfortunately, Kitzmiller said it is difficult to
make a living playing badminton in the United
States. "In Europe and Asia a professional
badminton player can earn $80,000 a year, which
is good for any athlete."
If Kitzmiller lived in Indonesia she would be

comparable to a Tracy Austin, butin this country
she is surrounded by people who are unfamiliar
with badminton. "I would love badminton to be
more popular here. In Indonesia it is the No. 1
sport. They have grandstands tor 20,000 fans,
and badminton is on TV regularly. I do think the
sport is growing in the United States, though.
Southern California is a hotspot and more
badminton facilities are being built in the
Midwest."
Kitzmiller said badminton opened
opportunities for her. "Well, for one thing,
badminton got me into Stanford," she said. "It
has all been very worthwhile and, most
importantly, I'm the happiest when I'm
smacking that birdie around."
