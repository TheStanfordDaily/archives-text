basketball team blew open a
•Close contest against the Lady
ffcougars last night to post a
WB-64 non-conference win.
i'. With eight minutes remain
ing in the game, a Washington
State foul upset the Couger's
ijjfcoach enough to draw a tech
nical foul and sent Stanford
junior Lee Ann Margerum to

the free throw line. Margerum
hit two crucial free throws to
boost the Card's lead to 54-47.
Senior Jeanne Ruark-Hoff,
the nation's eighth best free
throw shooter, connected on
the technical foul. Stanford re
tained possession and
freshman Virginia Sourlis
chipped in an open set shot
from 15 feet.
The Card's four-point advan
tage had suddenly stretched to
10 points in less than a minute.

Washington State was down
but not dead. The Cougers
clawed back, scoring on two
perimeter prayers following a
pair of Cardinal turnovers.
Stanford still nursed a 57-51
lead at the 5:45 mark, but
Washington was unable to
break the six-point barrier
from then on.
Despite the Couger's
double-teaming pressure de
fense, the Card scored three
unanswered baskets in the
final minute.
Margerum, a reserve guard,
"had the best game of her
career," according to Stanford
coach Dotty McCrea. "Lee Ann
handled the ball well, made
her freethrows and was ex
tremly poised."
Margerum scored a season
high 13 points, while sinking
nine of 10 free throws. She
also finished with four assists
and two steals.
Ruark-Hoff was another
standout. She scored 21
points, grabbed nine rebounds
and dished out six assists.
"We got pushed around a lot
in the beginning," said
McCrea, whose team faced a
34-33 deficit at halftime. "In the
second half, we got some calls
that turned the game's
momentum in our favor."
The Card's victory improved
its overall record to 14-7. It was
the Cougers' tenth consecu
tive loss.
