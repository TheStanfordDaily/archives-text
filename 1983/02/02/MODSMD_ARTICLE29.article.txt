Baseball in Olympics?
Los Angeles — The Los Angeles
Dodgers have been assisting efforts by
the International Association of
Amateur Baseball to make baseball an
Olympic sport at the 1984 games.
Dodger President Peter O'Malley
said in an interview that last fall he sent
an assistant, Akihiro Ikuhara, to Interna

tional Olympic Committee head
quarters in Lausanne, Switzerland, and
to Moscow, to gain support.
Two years ago the IOC agreed to
make baseball a demonstration sport at
the 1984 games in Los Angeles, marking
the sixth time baseball has received the
designation. But the IOC has resisted at
tempts to upgrade the four-team tour
nament to an official Olympic sport.
Runner says bribes used
New York — Alberto Salazar, upset
with what he considers the hypocritical
policies of The Athletics Congress, has
charged officials of the national govern
ing body of track and field of offering
him a bribe of $50,000 to $60,000.
Salazar, whose time of 2 hours 8
minutes 13 seconds is the fastest in mar
athon history, said Monday "they were
willing to pay" him that amount of
money for competing in the inaugural
Los Angeles Marathon on May 14. He
said he rejected the offer.
For track and field athletes to accept
money outright is considered illegal
under regulations of the International
Amateur Athletic Federation, the world
governing body of the sport. TAC is a
