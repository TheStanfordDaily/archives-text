A massive retraining effort by government and private
industry could alleviate the problem of job skill obsoles
cencecreated by the expanding computer industry, Ste
ven jobs, chairman of the board of Apple Computer,
Inc. told a standing-room-only crowd in Bishop Au
ditorium yesterday.
But the current administration's military policies
might obstruct this goal, Jobs said. "The money that we
could be spending retraining people, we're spending
paying soldiers and building MX missiles."
Society and computers in the 1980s are on their first
date, and the computer industry's response to the pub
lic's needs will determine "how that first date goes and if
there will be any offspring or not," Jobs said.
lobs, a college dropout who was raised in Silicon
Valley and audited Stanford classes as a high school
student, was optimistic about the potential of comput
ers in the '80s as improvements in software and
hardware push the computer industry into unexplored
areas.
"Computers, in general, when they do what people
have done before, result in really boring things. What is
really exciting is when they do things that people didn't
do before," he said.
He said Apple's newest computer, called "Lisa," uses
programs that are more visual â€” veritable "electronic
canvasses" that enable the user to produce all kinds of
visual aids in formerly routine memos. These software
developments can revolutionize the public's perception
of computers, Jobs said.
"Let's use the power of these tools to inject a liberal
arLs flavor into a traditionally pretty sterile discipline,"
he said.
Drawing a comparison between the young computer
industry and the fledgling television industry of 30 years
ago, Jobs said the computer software technology today
is about at the level of the Milton Berle Show"We aren't

even at I Love Lucy yet," he said.
Jobs also emphasized the changing quality of compu
ter programmers. "The people that go into computers
now aren't computer nerds," he said. People who
"would've been poets in the '60, (who) would've been
out there in that line at Berkeley being tear gassed" are
the modern computer programmers, and they are a
"much more interesting class of people," he said.
Jobs also discussed the potential role that computers
can play in education especially for children who first
perceive computer programs as challenging games.
"Somewhere along this line of games versus real-life
simulations, you cross a boundary where you start to call
it an educational experience, yet before you crossed this
boundary it was a game," he said. "What computers are
doing is very rapidly accelerating a lot of these experi
ences from the game side of the boundary to the educa
tional side of the boundary."
The possibilities for interactive computers to improve
the quality of education are virtually endless, Jobs said.
"If the programs get better. . . thecomputer's willingto
spend a lot more interactive time with you than probably
most universities today," he said.
But the real goal of computers is to "emulate some of
the things that people do," Jobs said. "No matter how
fast we build our computers, they don't do some very
important things that we want to do," he said. "You can
take all these computers and put them together and (the
computers) still don't know how to recognize . . . con
tinuous speech."
The human brain is still much more complex than
computers in this respect, he said, and it needs to be
examined by computer designers before its intricacies
can be reproduced in integrated circuits. "What is it
inside this cavity which can outperform the most giant
computer we can build?" he asked.
