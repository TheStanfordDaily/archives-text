Six graduate students and two undergraduates were
recognized for "exceptional service to Stanford Univer
sity and its students" when they were named last week
as the latest recipients of the Dean's Award for Service.
Graduate students Jonathan Siegel, Ana Marcovich,
Mary Crouter, Bernie Mehl, Erin Moore and Nicholas
Zirpolo and undergraduates Thomas Wu and Meg
Donovan were named by Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons.
Sally Cole, director of research for the dean of stu
dents, said the students were chosen on the basis of
recommendations submitted by faculty, alumni and
other students.
Wu, who was cited for "responding to a competitive
environment by sharing his knowledge and skills in
many settings," said his selection came as a surprise.
"I hadn't even thought of receiving it (the award).
What I received it for, I didn't even think of as what I'd
ordinarily call 'service,' but I guess my professors did,"
Wu said.

Wu, a senior majoring in electrical engineering and
biology, was praised for his "many long nights at LOTS
and CIT, helping fellow communications students en
dure both personal and technological downtimes,
crashes and bugs."
"Essentially, I was just helping other people with their
computer work," he said. "It was just something I
thought I should do."
Zirpolo, a disabled student, was awarded for his ef
forts to make the University more physically and
psychologically accessible to students with disabilities.
He was told of the award during a meeting with
Lyons. "I thought Jim Lyons had called me into his office
to tell me about changes in some programs I had some
thing to do with . . .1 was really surprised when he said
the meeting was really about the award," Zirpolo said.
During the meeting, Lyons told Zirpolo a medal with a
likeness of Old Union went with the award. When he
asked why Zirpolo was examining it so intently, "I told
him I was looking to see whether the drawing of Old
Union showed the old stairs or the ramps we worked to
have put in," Zirpolo said.
