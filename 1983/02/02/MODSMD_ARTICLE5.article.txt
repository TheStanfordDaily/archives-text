sula area could be attributed to the O'Connors over the

when they arrested the O'Connors. Herrington said,
"We seized two 50-foot by 10-foot trailers of the stuff
parked in front of his and a girlfriend's house." Other

he added.
"Everything in their house was stolen — I mean every
thing — right down to the rugs; even a rocking chair was
stolen property," Herrington said.
About 600 burglary victims have examined the prop
erty, and about half of it has been identified, he said.
