Andropov denies summit request
Moscow — Soviet leader Yuri Andropov last night
rejected President Reagan's call for a summit meeting
by asserting that Reagan's conditions were "patently
unacceptable" to the Soviet Union.
Responding to the 1 president's letter to the people
of Europe, the new Soviet leader said Reagan's offer
to sign an accord banning all U.S. and Soviet land
based medium-range nuclear missiles was merely a
restatement of his "zero option" proposal at the Ge
neva arms talks.
Andropov, in an interview with the Communist Par
ty newspaper Pravda, said Reagan's proposal was not
"serious" and suggested that it was a part of "a propa
ganda game" to influence public opinion in western
Europe.

It was "precisely this unrealistic position of the
United States that has blocked" progress in the Gene
va talks on medium-range nuclear weapons in Eu
rope, Andropov said. By reiterating it one more time,
he added, Washington indicated that it "does not
want to look for a mutually acceptable accord with
the Soviet Union and thereby (it) deliberately dooms
the Geneva talks to failure."
Andropov said he still believes "that summit meet
ings have special significance" for resolving com
plicated international problems. "For us," he added,
"this is not a matter of a political or a propaganda
game."
"But when the U.S. president makes the meeting
conditional on the Soviet Union's consent to the pat
ently unacceptable solution to the problem of nucle

ar armaments in Europe proposed by him, this by no
means testifies to the seriousness of the American
leadership's approach to the whole of this issue. This
can only be regretted."
Andropov reiterated earlier Soviet warnings that
Moscow would "answer in the appropriate way" if
the United States actually deploys its new nuclear
arms in western Europe, but gave no details.
The United States has no medium-range land
based nuclear missiles deployed at present while the
Soviet Union has several hundreds of them aimed
both at western Europe and China. Under a 1979
NATO decision, the United States intends to deploy
572 Pershing II and cruise missiles in western Europe
starting next December.
Reagan's "zero option" proposal would require

Moscow to dismantle nearly 600 of its medium-range
nuclear missilesin the European theater. In exchange,
the United States would abandon plans to deploy its
new missiles.
Budget draws fire on Capitol Hill
Washington — President Reagan's call for a $35.4
billion increase in defense spending ran into
bipartisan opposition yesterday as the first con
gressional hearing on his new budget produced de

the Treasury Donald Regan and Budget Director
