Andropov denies summit request
Moscow — Soviet leader Yuri Andropov last night
rejected President Reagan's call for a summit meeting
by asserting that Reagan's conditions were "patently
unacceptable" to the Soviet Union.
Responding to the 1 president's letter to the people
of Europe, the new Soviet leader said Reagan's offer
to sign an accord banning all U.S. and Soviet land
based medium-range nuclear missiles was merely a
restatement of his "zero option" proposal at the Ge
neva arms talks.
Andropov, in an interview with the Communist Par
ty newspaper Pravda, said Reagan's proposal was not
"serious" and suggested that it was a part of "a propa
ganda game" to influence public opinion in western
Europe.

It was "precisely this unrealistic position of the
United States that has blocked" progress in the Gene
va talks on medium-range nuclear weapons in Eu
rope, Andropov said. By reiterating it one more time,
he added, Washington indicated that it "does not
want to look for a mutually acceptable accord with
the Soviet Union and thereby (it) deliberately dooms
the Geneva talks to failure."
Andropov said he still believes "that summit meet
ings have special significance" for resolving com
plicated international problems. "For us," he added,
"this is not a matter of a political or a propaganda
game."
"But when the U.S. president makes the meeting
conditional on the Soviet Union's consent to the pat
ently unacceptable solution to the problem of nucle

ar armaments in Europe proposed by him, this by no
means testifies to the seriousness of the American
leadership's approach to the whole of this issue. This
can only be regretted."
Andropov reiterated earlier Soviet warnings that
Moscow would "answer in the appropriate way" if
the United States actually deploys its new nuclear
arms in western Europe, but gave no details.
The United States has no medium-range land
based nuclear missiles deployed at present while the
Soviet Union has several hundreds of them aimed
both at western Europe and China. Under a 1979
NATO decision, the United States intends to deploy
572 Pershing II and cruise missiles in western Europe
starting next December.
Reagan's "zero option" proposal would require

Moscow to dismantle nearly 600 of its medium-range
nuclear missilesin the European theater. In exchange,
the United States would abandon plans to deploy its
new missiles.
Budget draws fire on Capitol Hill
Washington — President Reagan's call for a $35.4
billion increase in defense spending ran into
bipartisan opposition yesterday as the first con
gressional hearing on his new budget produced de
mands for more government actions to relieve un
employment.
Reagan's top budget aides, including Secretary of
the Treasury Donald Regan and Budget Director
David Stockman, encountered mockery, ridicule and
little encouragement as they testified on the
budget before the powerful House Appropriations
Committee.
The clash foreshadowed a rough time ahead forthe
president's $848.5 billion spending plan despite his
appeal for bipartisan backing to reduce projected
deficits of nearly $200 billion in each of the next two
fiscal years.
Meantime, Secretary of Defense Caspar Wein
berger stood firmly behind his department's budget
request, declaring that projected deficits were largely
irrelevant to the size of military spending.
'We simply cannot reduce defense spending any
further without undermining the security of the Unit
ed States," Weinberger told the Senate Armed Ser
vices Committee.
But even such good supporters of the Pentagon as
Sen. Henry Jackson (D-Wash.) and Sen. Sam Nunn (D-
Ga.) warned that the Pentagon would face "very sub
stantial cuts" this year.
Stockman conceded at the outset of the unusually
stormy House hearing that Congress would revise the
budget, but he appealed for an agreement in advance
to hold the line at $131 billion on spending for major
non-defense programs under the committee's juris
diction, as the budget calls for.
"You will find some very tough medicine in this
budget, but I think we have to agree that tough medi
cine is unavoidable," Stockman said. "We can do
nothing less; we have to draw a line."
But Democrats and Republicans shot back that
Congress would not go along with further reductions
in federal benefits for the poor or other Reagan pro
posals unless the defense buildup is trimmed.
Salvador responds to rebel victory
Berlin, El Salvador — About 1500 government
troops were reported advancing yesterday to try to
roll back the biggest rebel victory so far in the 39-
month-old civil war.
About 500 guerrillas of the leftist Farabundo Marti
National Liberation Front took over Berlin, an agricul
tural center of 30,000 people in southeast El Salvador,
Monday evening after rebel snipers prevented rein
forcements reaching less than 100 national
guardsmen, national police and local militiamen de
fending the town.
Forty civilians were reported killed by air force
bombing runs and rebel bazooka and mortar attacks.
Seven square blocks including the town market were
burned to the ground, and many other buildings
were set afire.
The government force made its last stand Monday
afternoon in the national police headquarters in the
center of the town. After those inside rejected re
peated calls to surrender, the rebels fired a barrage of
bazookas and rocket-propelled grenades that set the
building on fire.
Berlin, 70 miles east of San Salvador, is the biggest
town taken by the rebels, but the local commander
indicated they might not try to hold it.
"It will be the decision of the FMLN Command

whether we stay in Berlin," Ernesto Martinez told a
rally of some 1500 people yesterday morning.
About 1200 government troops with artillery were
reported advancing by foot on a mountain road from
Mercedes Umana, seven miles north of Berlin, while
army sources said about 300 more had been sent from
Usulutan, the provincial capital 20 miles to the
northwest.
Martinez said one guerrilla was killed and six were
wounded in the fighting. There was no estimate of
casualties among the government forces, but rebels
were seen burying the bodies of four national po
licemen.
Defense urged to cut budget
Washington — Members of both parties on the
Senate Armed Services Committee called on Defense
Secretary Caspar Weinberger yesterday to suggest
cuts in President Reagan's new $238.6 billion defense
budget, and Sen. John Warner (R-Va.) floated as one
possibility reducing the active duty military force by 5
to 7 percent.
Sen. Dan Quayle (R-lnd.) warned the resisting sec
retary that "these reductions are going to take place"
whether he helps or not and that "we're going to get
ourselves in a dangerous situation" if the Defense De
partment refuses to proffer cuts and leaves it to Con
gress to impose them.
But Weinberger said as he has repeatedly, "We sim
ply cannot reduce defense spending any further
without endangering the security of the United
States."
The secretary said he was "reluctant to concede on
Day One" that a carefully structured defense budget
must be reduced.
The budget that Reagan sent Congress on Monday
has increases for defense but not for most domestic
programs, and would produce a $189 billion deficit
next fiscal year. Many members of both parties have
vowed to moderate the defense increase.
Warner, fourth-ranking Republican on the com
mittee, received no encouragement from either
Weinberger or Gen. John Vessey, chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff, when he suggested that the best
way to bring down Pentagon spending quickly might
be to reduce the active duty military force by 5 to 7
percent.
In an interview afterward, Warnersaid he is looking
at a 5 percent reduction in the 2.1 million active duty
force, which would mean taking 105,000 service men
and women off the Pentagon payroll. Warner added
that he has been consulting with National Guard of
ficials to see how people discharged for economy rea
sons could be enticed to join reserve units near their
homes where they would be on call for emergency
duty.
The senator said that the 5 percent manpower cut
would save between $3 billion to $4 billion, and more
if related economies are counted.
Warner, like Quayle, warned Weinberger that con
gressional cuts in the defense budget are inevitable
this year. "Nothing is certain but death and taxes and
a cut by Congress in defense spending," Warner told

Weinberger.
Begin won't abandon settlement
Jerusalem - Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Be
gin, ignoring American calls, made clear yesterday
that he is not willing to halt Jewish settlement of oc
cupied Palestinian areas in the interests of peace ne
gotiations with Jordan.
In a speech here before the Knesset, the Israeli par
liament, on the political state of affairs, Begin de
clared, "We will continue without any restraint with
this national project." Every Jew has the right to settle
in the (biblical) "land of Israel," which included the
occupied areas of Jordan's West Bank and the Gaza
Strip, he said.
Begin said the Middle East accords concluded at
Camp David were the "only signed agreements" and,
in an evident reference to the Middle East plan put
forward by President Reagan, said all other plans and
proposals had "cropped up somewhere and then
faded again into oblivion."
Begin recalled his invitation to King Hussein of Jor
dan to enter "without preconditions" into nego
tiations with Israel over the West Bank region and the
Gaza Strip. "I would be very happy if he comes," Be
gin added.
The prime minister also made clear, however, that
there would be no advance concessions by Israel.
The leader of the opposition Labor Party, Shimon
Peres, said in a speech following Begin's that Israel
must now decide what it can do to persuade Jordan to
take part in the peace efforts.
For its part, Israel ought not set preconditions and
not insist that the Camp David accords be the basis of
negotiations with Jordan, Peres said.
Domestic oil cuts price per barrel
Washington — Eight major oil companies yesterday
cut prices they pay for domestic oil by $1 a barrel, and
others are expected to follow suit as pressures con
tinue to batter the oil industry.
Industry economists and analysts said the price cuts
were a reaction to a continuing weak market and con
fusion over the course of the Organization of Petrole
um Exporting Countries(OPEC). Many analysts pre
dicted a $2 to $4-a-barrel reduction in OPEC prices,
but said they did not view the events as the beginning
of a free fall in world oil prices.
The round of price cuts, which appear to pave the
way for further reductions in gasoline prices — al
ready at their lowest level in three years — began
Monday when Gulf Oil Corp said it was lowering the
price it would pay for domestic crudes by $1 a barrel.
Yesterday, Texaco Inc., Shell Oil Co., Phillips Petro
leum Co., Marathon Oil Co., Conoco Inc., Cities Ser
vice Co., Standard Oil of California and Standard Oil
Co. of Indiana matched the reduction by Gulf. While
some analysts said the U.S. oil companies' price cuts
were in anticipation of a drop in the OPEC
benchmark price, at least one company denied that.
"The Shell posting decrease is in response to the
softening products market, in particular the U.S.
products market," the company said in a statement

about its price reduction. "It is not in anticipation of
any future OPEC price reduction or other foreign
crude price reduction."
Anticipation of oil price reductions began last
month when OPEC was unable to reach production
and price agreementsduring its meeting in Geneva. A
tentative agreement on production ceilings fell apart
when the Saudis and their allies demanded that
African countries raise their prices slightly and stop
trying to undercut other OPEC members.
The Kuwaiti news agency reported yesterday that
major oil-producing nations in the Persion Gulf area
were prepared to drop prices by $4 a barrel within a
week unless OPEC oil ministers reach an agreement.
If the price of OPEC's benchmark Saudi Arabian
light crude falls from $34 to $30, such a price could be
sustained for as long as the Saudis were willing to hold
it, said Steve Brown, an economist with the Federal
Reserve Bank in Dallas.
"The spot market shows that $34 for Saudi light is
too high and that $30 is more reasonable," he said.
"Price-cutting that falls in that range is something that
simply reflects market conditions."
"Obviously there's a very serious problem, but the
magnitude of the problem is being compounded by
negotiations through the press and the media" by
OPEC members, said Sanford Margoshes, an oil in
dustry analyst with Shearson-American Express.
Review of national forests halted
Washington — The Reagan administration yester
day canceled its wilderness-review process for na
tional forests, a move that puts in limbo millions of
acres of roadless lands nationwide.
Assistant Secretary of Agriculture John Crovvell said
at a press conference that the reevaluation of 28.7 mil
lion acres of forest lands was necessary because of a
recent court decision that held that the environmen
tal-impact study for the previous review was inade
quate.
Crowell said the new review, which is certain to stir
immediate controversy in Congress, would take six
months to two years to complete, at a cost of $15 mil
lion to $30 million. It will be the third time in the last 10
years that the federal government has reviewed
roadless areas in national forests for wilderness
potential.
Rising interest curbs market
New York — Stock prices staged a broad retreat in a
late sell-off yesterday amid concern over prospects
for rising interest rates and falling oil prices.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which rose
10.95 points Monday, fell 15.91 points to close at
1059.79.
