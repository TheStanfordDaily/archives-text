# Former P.O.W. relates experiences
## Stockdale teaches sophs 
### 
A Hanoi prison camp was the
setting for the most valuable
and harshest education Vice
Admiral lames Stockdale has
ever received.
Stockdale was shot down
over North Vietnam on his
second combat tour. He was
the senior naval service pris
oner of war in Hanoi. Held
prisoner by the North Viet
namese for eight years, he
spent two years in legironsand
a total of four years in solitary
confinement.
Now a senior research fellow
at the Hoover Institution,
Stockdale is teaching a
sophomore seminar, "Combat
ting Manipulation and Coer
cion." Although students have
learned about the tapping
code the prisoners used to
communicate and the kinds of
torture they were subjected to,
Stockdale said he does not in
tend the class to be a series of
lectures on the horrors of
being a prisoner of war. "This
course deals with human dig
nity," he said to his students on
the first day of class. Stockdale
uses his experiences in Viet
nam to examine and identify
human reactions to and de
fenses against manipulation
and coercion in any situation.
"I think that there are certain
personality traits that are vul
nerable to manipulation . . .
one example is the person who
needs to be loved, who needs
to interact continuously. He's
not whole, not self-sufficient,
or self-confident," Stockdale
said. "Another debilitating trait
is obsession with hatred.
Someone who becomes ob
sessed with hatred to the point
where he loses all spontanaeity
and flexibility in dealing with
his own tactical defense be
comes iron-clad and frozen
into position," he added.
"I don't put up as good a
shield as many people I know
do . . . there are some people
who can't be had," he said.
What Stockdale emphasizes in
the class is resistance to mental
manipulation, not resistance to

physical pain. "On the matter
of pain everyone in hindsight
— and I'm one — wishes he'd
committed to pain earlier . . .
once you get in its not so bad.
Never once did I sort out heros
or bums on the basis of their
threshold to paid," he said.
The torture Stockdale and
his colleagues faced was ac
companied bymental coercion
in an effort to get the prisoners
to act as propaganda agents for
their captors. "Compulsion
and free will can coexist as Aris
totle said. You have to exist in
this bond between compulsion
and free will," he said.
Stockdale stressed that he is
not a crusader for the cause of
the Vietnam War. "My course
is not about public policy. It's
about human behavior," he
said. When questioned about
his political view of the war
Stockdale said, "It (the Viet
nam War) just doesn't translate
into a noble or ignoble cause
. . . the poor soldier in the
trenches seldom has time or it
seldom occurs to him to pass
judgment. ... It was the sad
dest chapter in American his
tory for the reason that we
were put into a predicament by
a government that never level
led with the American
people."
While Stockdale was in a
Hanoi prison camp his wife
Sybil Stockdale was fighting
the American government on
the issue of telling the truth to
the American people and to
the families of prisoners of
war.
"I was organizing the Ameri
cans in prison and she, un
known to me, was organizing
their wives in America,"
Stockdale said. Sybil Stockdale
founded the National League
of Families of Prisoners and
Missing in South East Asia.
"She was fighting govern
ment opposition to her insis
tence that the mutilation and
torture of American prisoners
known to her and the govern
ment to be true, shoud be kept
secret from the American

people. She finally got it
turned around but it cost her
four years of $500 telephone
bills," Stockdale said.
"I was most proud when I
came out of prison not know
ing anything about all this and
hearing a cabinet-level official
telling a large group of people
that this is still a country where
an individual with a good idea
can single-handedly turn the
government around. It was
done in 1969 and the person
who had done it was Sybil
Stockdale."
Stockdale said his wife be
came an important leader for
hundreds of American
families. "She achieved the
status of being an authoritative
spokeswoman for an impor
tant segment of American so
ciety. She was given quarterly
briefings by Henry Kissinger
and had meetings with the
president," he said.
Stockdale just completed
the first chapter of a book that
he and his wife are co
authoring. The newly com
pleted chapter reports some
politically significant events
that have never been pub
lished, he said. "It's not a tale
of dishonest reporting or of
conspiracy," he said, but
rather "a tale of the distortion
of truth wrought from com
mand directing from afar."
A graduate student here be
fore he went to Vietnam,
Stockdale credits his Stanford
education with giving him
many of the valuable tools he
needed as a prisoner of war.
Speaking particularly fondly of
the humanities, Stockdale said
they taught him about human
morals and character.
The value of Stockdale's
seminar may seem somewhat
nebulous to present-day stu
dents here but he is careful to
stress the importance of apply
ing the ideas he teaches to
everyday life.

telling a large group of people
that this is still a country where
an individual with a good idea
can single-handedly turn the
government around. It was
done in 1969 and the person
who had done it was Sybil
Stockdale."
Stockdale said his wife be
came an important leader for
hundreds of American
families. "She achieved the
status of being an authoritative
spokeswoman for an impor
tant segment of American so
ciety. She was given quarterly
briefings by Henry Kissinger
and had meetings with the
president," he said.
Stockdale just completed
the first chapter of a book that
he and his wife are co
authoring. The newly com
pleted chapter reports some
politically significant events
that have never been pub
lished, he said. "It's not a tale
of dishonest reporting or of
conspiracy," he said, but
rather "a tale of the distortion
of truth wrought from com
mand directing from afar."
A graduate student here be
fore he went to Vietnam,
Stockdale credits his Stanford
education with giving him
many of the valuable tools he
needed as a prisoner of war.
Speaking particularly fondly of
the humanities, Stockdale said
they taught him about human
morals and character.
The value of Stockdale's
seminar may seem somewhat
nebulous to present-day stu
dents here but he is careful to
stress the importance of apply
ing the ideas he teaches to
everyday life.
A Hanoi prison camp was the
setting for the most valuable
and harshest education Vice
Admiral lames Stockdale has
ever received.
Stockdale was shot down
over North Vietnam on his
second combat tour. He was
the senior naval service pris
oner of war in Hanoi. Held
prisoner by the North Viet
namese for eight years, he
spent two years in legironsand
a total of four years in solitary
confinement.
Now a senior research fellow
at the Hoover Institution,
Stockdale is teaching a
sophomore seminar, "Combat
ting Manipulation and Coer
cion." Although students have
learned about the tapping
code the prisoners used to
communicate and the kinds of
torture they were subjected to,
Stockdale said he does not in
tend the class to be a series of
lectures on the horrors of
being a prisoner of war. "This
course deals with human dig
nity," he said to his students on
the first day of class. Stockdale
uses his experiences in Viet
nam to examine and identify
human reactions to and de
fenses against manipulation
and coercion in any situation.
"I think that there are certain
personality traits that are vul
nerable to manipulation . . .
one example is the person who
needs to be loved, who needs
to interact continuously. He's
not whole, not self-sufficient,
or self-confident," Stockdale
said. "Another debilitating trait
is obsession with hatred.
Someone who becomes ob
sessed with hatred to the point
where he loses all spontanaeity
and flexibility in dealing with
his own tactical defense be
comes iron-clad and frozen
into position," he added.
"I don't put up as good a
shield as many people I know
do . . . there are some people
who can't be had," he said.
What Stockdale emphasizes in
the class is resistance to mental
manipulation, not resistance to

physical pain. "On the matter
of pain everyone in hindsight
— and I'm one — wishes he'd
committed to pain earlier . . .
once you get in its not so bad.
Never once did I sort out heros
or bums on the basis of their
threshold to paid," he said.
The torture Stockdale and
his colleagues faced was ac
companied bymental coercion
in an effort to get the prisoners
to act as propaganda agents for
their captors. "Compulsion
and free will can coexist as Aris
totle said. You have to exist in
this bond between compulsion
and free will," he said.
Stockdale stressed that he is
not a crusader for the cause of
the Vietnam War. "My course
is not about public policy. It's
about human behavior," he
said. When questioned about
his political view of the war
Stockdale said, "It (the Viet
nam War) just doesn't translate
into a noble or ignoble cause
. . . the poor soldier in the
trenches seldom has time or it
seldom occurs to him to pass
judgment. ... It was the sad
dest chapter in American his
tory for the reason that we
were put into a predicament by
a government that never level
led with the American
people."
While Stockdale was in a
Hanoi prison camp his wife
Sybil Stockdale was fighting
the American government on
the issue of telling the truth to
the American people and to
the families of prisoners of
war.
"I was organizing the Ameri
cans in prison and she, un
known to me, was organizing
their wives in America,"
Stockdale said. Sybil Stockdale
founded the National League
of Families of Prisoners and
Missing in South East Asia.
"She was fighting govern
ment opposition to her insis
tence that the mutilation and
torture of American prisoners
known to her and the govern
ment to be true, shoud be kept
secret from the American

people. She finally got it
turned around but it cost her
four years of $500 telephone
bills," Stockdale said.
"I was most proud when I
came out of prison not know
ing anything about all this and
hearing a cabinet-level official
telling a large group of people
that this is still a country where
an individual with a good idea
can single-handedly turn the
government around. It was
