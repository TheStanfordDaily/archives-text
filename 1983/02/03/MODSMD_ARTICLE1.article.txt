# Facelift for Quad proposed
## 
### BOB COHN Staff writer 
A $1 million plan the
rocky surface and otherwise improve
the inner Quad will go before the
Board of Trustees Monday.
The money, which comes from
anonymous donations, will help ful
fill plans originally drawn up by
noted architect Frederick Law Olm
sted, according to the University's
Planning Office.
Campus Planner )udy Chan said
that the proposal emphasizes
changes in the traffic circulation,
paving, seating, lighting and planting
areas of the Quad. She said the Plan
ning Office's report, which was writ
ten last month, stresses "restoration
and enhancement" of the Quad.
"It will be restored to be histori
cally accurate," said Director of
Planning Philip Williams. "His (Olm
sted's) plan was never quite com
pleted." Olmsted, chief campus de
signer, was also responsible for New
York's Central Park and San Francis
co's Golden Gate Park.
Williams said that the plans, if ef
fected, will "make the seating more
gracious and the pavement nicer,"
among other things.
He explained that the University
had been considering restoration of
this area for more than 70 years, but
lack of funds has prevented such
renovations.
"The opportunity suddenly pre
sented itself," said Williams. Dona

tions recently received were ear
marked for Quad restoration by the
donors themselves. "The money is
for this in particular — not instead of
something else," he stressed.
The proposal recommends replac
ing the loose gravel floor with fine or
coarse-grained gravel in concrete,
tile, asphalt paving or grass. Williams
said that the final decision will prob
ably not be grass, although that is the
option many students favor, "It was
not the designer's (Olmsted's) in
tent."
The report claims that planting
grass would conflict with Olmsted's
original concept — "planting irri
gated lawns in the inner Quad is in
appropriate because of our semi-arid
climate." In addition, grass is seen as
an unfavorable alternative because
the Quad is so heavily travelled.
Students and planners have been
unhappy with the gravel for years.
Olmsted's son visited the campus in
1914, and the report quotes him as
saying, "The present gravel surface is
so loose that it is disagreeable to walk
on and is apparently avoided as
much as possible by students. . .the
whole surface should be covered
with a smooth, hard, good-looking
pavement."
Subsequent attempts to pave or
plant grass in the Quad went unfulfil
led on five separate occasions in the
last 35 years.
Adding seating along the arcade or
in the interior of the planting circles

should "encourage use rather than
'hurrying through,' " according to
the report. Planners, who compare
today's Quad to the fast lane of the
Bayshore Freeway, foresee the new
Quad as a "place for pausing, for set
tling one's body and thoughts for a
few moments, for stepping to talk
and finding it comfortable to stay a
while longer."
"We are trying to encourage more
of a 'people' kind of space," said
Chan.
The Planning Office's proposal
"respects the original plan — cros
sed axes and eight planning circles,"
said Williams. It is likely, however,
that the size and content of these
planting circles will change, perhaps
to include seating and lighting inside
the circles themselves.
Other plans concerning these
planting areas include the construc
tion of rimmed planters whit h would
function as seating, another idea that
Olmsted proposed almost 100 years
ago.
"They apparently finished it in a
hurry to make the deadline for dedi
cation," said Williams, referring to
the rushed completion of the Quad
almost a century ago.
Assuming that the proposals pass
the Board of Trustees, Williams said
that the plans could be designed in
time to be constructed this summer,
though next summer is "more
likely."



HIGH NOON IN THE QUAD: The quad as it stands

chitect's plans. However, anonymous donors have
contributed $1 million for the Quad's completion.
"It would be desirous to get it
done by Stanford's centennial," Wil
liams continued. "That would be
somewhere between 1985 and 1991,
depending on whether you consider
the year of ground breaking or first
classes," he joked. The donors,
however, are hoping the project will
be completed by 1984.
The report says that "minimal re

storation" would cost $650,000 while
a "more elaborate enhancement
scheme" could run $1.35 million.
The Planning Office reported that
"the project of completing the cour
tyard appears to be underway, after
90 years." Perhaps not too long from
now, when a senior turns a freshman
into a Stanford man or woman under
a full moon at midnight, they will be
surrounded by carefully clipped
shrubbery, smooth paving blocks,
plentiful seating and, as planners
foresee, "a more appealing 'people
space'."
