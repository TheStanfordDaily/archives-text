Beta Theta Pi members watch the CBS-produced movie loosely based on the book
describing the heart transplant experience of fraternity brother, Sam Poole, Class of '82
Poole received a heart transplant at the Stanford Hospital at age 17 and died last
December because his body was unable to fight infection. The Hallmark Hall of Fame
presented the made-for-television movie, "Thursday's Child," on Feb. 1.
