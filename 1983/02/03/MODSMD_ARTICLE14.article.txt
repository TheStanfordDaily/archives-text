## The 						Stanford Daily The 						postal-paint complex 
### 
Talk of the existence of a military-industrial
complex does not raise many eyebrows nowa
days, but we have stumbled upon a different
sort of government-business relationship which
is certain to raise a few. Acting on an anonym
ous tip late last week, we sent a Daily photo
grapher to the Postmaster General's office in
Washington, D.C. She photographed visitors to
the office as they entered and departed.
Analysis of the photographs has revealed that
one visitor entered the office with a large black
briefcase and left empty-handed 10 minutes la
ter. This man was identified as Harvey
Blackpaint, chairman of the board of doo Punt
Chemical Corp. Our worst fears were con
firmed; we had uncovered the postal-paint
complex.
Our suspicions had first been aroused last
week when queries to postal employees about
why they were painting the boxes black resulted
in the ambiguous "orders from Washington."
Still, we put up with the chaos which resulted
from the fact that students could no longer just
glance at their boxes as they breezed by on their
bikes between classes. Every time we struggled
through the crowds and finally succeeded in
turning the combination, we smiled and shrug
ged: "Surely the postmaster knows be<;t."

It wasn't until we were told the box windows
had been painted for "security reasons" that we
really began to be suspicious. The explanation
that Social Security checks were being stolen in
large numbers from letter boxes because their
distinctive brown envelopes were easy to spot
through the windows seemed ludicrous, be
cause we quickly deduced that any reasonable
government decision-maker would have simply
ordered the checks sent in less distinctive or
even randomly colored envelopes.
It was at this point that we received the
anonymous tip and put two and two together.
Further investigation revealed that doo Punt's
black paint mixing center in Porkbarrel, 111. has
more than doubled production levels in recent
weeks and that Blackpaint has visited Post Of
fice Headquarters five times during the past
month.
Perhaps most ominous are reports we re
ceived today from some New England states. It
seems that entire post offices there are now
being painted black. The postmaster claims that
the offices are being painted to make it more
difficult for thieves to find post offices at night.
But we know the real reason: the postal-paint
complex.
