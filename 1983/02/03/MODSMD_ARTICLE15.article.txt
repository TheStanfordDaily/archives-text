## Long live the artificial heart 
### 
On Dec. 2, 1982, doctors at the
University of Utah succeeded in im
planting an artifical heart in Barney
Clark, a man otherwise doomed to
imminent heart failure and death.
The relative success of the operation
has led predictably, to a somewhat
heated debate as to whether or not
the surgery should have been per
formed, and in the larger context, as
to whether the search for a means of
replacement of a failing heart is
worthwhile and justifiable.
The controversy, as I see it, ranges
around two basic issues: that of dis
tinguishing a productive and worth
while life from a mere prolongation
of biological existence and of how
much money we as a society are wil
ling to spend for the treatment of
disease.
The predominant opinion expres
sed by the media was that the /e*
place of Clark's heart was a
triumph of technology and medical
entrepreneurism over the better as
pects of human sense, particularly
compassion and concern for the
quality of life. The New York Times
was first: within days of the surgery,
the Times editorial page accused the
Salt Lake City doctors of using
Clark as a guinea pig for an as yet
unperfected mechanical heart, and
questioned whether their concern
for Clark had perhaps been over
shadowed by concern for the ad
vancement of their careers. The
Progressive, a left-leaning news
magazine, concentrated on the cost
of the operation (the mechanical de
vice itself cost $16,000), raising ques
tions regarding who would have ac
cess to this rare and expensive form
of treatment. Implicit in their argu
ment was the assertion that the med
ical establishment, "grown fat on
chemicals and technological wizar
dry," had chosen to pursue "frantic
and costly" treatment rather than
preventive medicine.
A similar theme dominated The
Nation, (Jan. 22), in which Stanford
History Prof. Barton Bernstein ques
tioned the validity not only of Clark's
operation but indeed of the entire
artificial heart research program.
His argument asked the right ques
tions, regarding both the cost and
implicit desirability of developing an
artificial heart. Hefailed, however, to
examine these issues with imagina

tion and hence produced somewhat
banal answers.
Bernstein attacks the idea of the
artificial heart primarily on the basis
of its cost. Lstimating that the device,
the operation and hospital care
would cost $100,000 per recipient in
the first year after implantation,
Bernstein arrives at the incredible fi
gure of $1.6 billion to $6.6 billion to
provide the artifical heart to between
16,000 and 66,000 people a year.
He rightly argues that we cannot
afford this type of expenditure, but
his reasoning is shortsighted — quite
obviously, the artifical heart is still an
experimental device and would not
be used in anywhere near the
number of cases hesuggests unlessit
could be made more inexpensive.
On that subject, an analogy with
the pocket calculator is enlighten
ing: 10 years ago, a simple calculator
cost $100; now it can be had fors7.
Clark's heart is merely a prototype —
he is living testimony to the fact that
the heart can work, and it is now
merely an engineering problem to
design a more inexpensive pros
thesis.
Bernstein criticizes the allotment
of resources to the artificial heart
program on two grounds — that too
much money was spent on develop
ing an exotic form of treatment, and
that the money would have been bet
ter spent on preventive medicine.
Certainly the development of the
heart cost quite a bit more (and took
longer) than was first predicted, but
such is the situation with all research
and development projects. (One
need only look to the Pentagon for
innumerable examples of cost over
runs.)
Furthermore, referring to the de
vice as "exotic treatment" merely
underlines the shortsightedness of
all who do so — all inventions seem
exotic at first (imagine public re
sponse to the first automobile or, for
that matter, to the first antibiotic
drug) but as a result of technological
progress become both practical and
common.
On the question of preventative
medicine, there is no doubt that a
vast majority of the heart disease in
this country is of a preventable na
ture, but the primary responsibility
for prevention lies not in the physi
cian's hands, but the patients'. It is

the job of the doctor to educate and
persuade the patient regarding pre
ventive measures, and to investigate
the causes of the various forms of
heart disease in the hope of under
standing the processes that lead to
disease and how these may be stop
ped at their inception.
In any case, it is nonsense to be
lieve that physicians can succeed in
persuading everyone in the general
population to avoid risk factors as
sociated with heart disease (i.e.
smoking, drinking,obesity). Shall we
say "to hell with the others" who did
not follow the doctors' advice and
deny them treatment? Furthermore,
just as we investigate new forms of
chemotherapy without really under
standing the causes of cancer, it is
justifiable to investigate and develop
new forms of treatment for heart dis
ease as we work toward an under
standing of the process.
Finally, Bernstein addresses issues
regarding the quality of life, issues a
physician deals with almost every
day. Certainly being tethered to
hoses is not the way to lead a produc
tive and worthwhile life: in the opin
ion of many, Clark woud be better off
dead. Indeed, the artificial heart at
present is not unlike the respirator
which maintains "alive" the body of a
patient whose brain is dead and
hence will never recover normal
function.
The essential difference is the
question of permanence —while the
brain-dead patient has no hope, the
artificial heart patient does — should
an implantable power source be
come a reality. The quality of life that
would thus be made possible is at
tested to by the experience of previ
ous heart transplant patients, some
of whom, having been seized from
the brink of death, now lead fairly
normal lives.
This as I see it is the goal of
medicine: not only to cure disease,
but to cure it in such a way as to
insure a worthwhile life for the pa
tient. The artificial heart holds much
promise for saving lives. I commend
Clark for his courage, and the doc
tors in Salt Lake City for their
foresight in attempting to provide a
new treatment for what is truly a de
vastating and widespread disease.
