## Faculty-student interaction requires emphasis 
### 
The students residing at 353 Cam
pus Drive would like to express our
extreme dissatisfaction with the lack
of faculty participation in the Resi
dential Education program.
Recently, we invited several faculty
members to an informal sherry hour
in our house lounge, which was to be
followed by a "special dinner" to be
prepared by University food service.
Through Res. Fd., we invited six pro
fessors to our faculty day.
By the fateful day a week ago, four
of these professors on the guest list
had failed to respond, and when con
tacted again, declined our invitation.
A fifth professor showed up an hour
and a half late, saying he had gotten
lost. (We realize our location is
rather out of the way, being at the top
of the lake on Campus Drive.) The
sixth professor didn't even bother to
show up after his RSVP.
lo lop u ail off, University food
service failed to provide a "special
dinner" for the now aborted sherry
hour. Perhaps they had prior know

ledge of the no-shows.
Of course, we realize that profes
sors have very busy social lives and
might not have the time for student
activities. Thus these actions speak
for themselves. Apparently, the six
professors and the University food
service management hold the Res.
Ld. program in low esteem.
Vet clearly one of the inherent
facets of residential education is
faculty/student interaction in an in
formal setting.
It is our hope that the University
wi II do more to promote this concept
in its Res. Id. program, and exact a
commitment to the program from
faculty members.

The 197b law on copyright repre
sents the outcome of prolonged
.political battles, debates and com
promises. Perhaps the law contains

ambiguities, some of which may
even have been known by its draf
ters. The current lawsuits may settle
something.
Regardless of the state of the law, it
is worthwhile to think about what
kind of system of payment for copies
would benefit the country. The pub
lic, including students, should be
able to use excerpts from books, ar
ticles, etc. at reasonable cost and au
thors and publishers should be paid
for their efforts so that the incentive
to produce good textual material will
be increased. These incentives are
important; the American Mathemat
ical Society has greatly increased the
number of high quality research
expository articles by paying for
them, and the Russians produce
good quality mathematical and sci
entific texts, because the financial
rewards of publishing these are sub
stantial relative to the regular salary
of a scientist.
In my opinion all cop\ ing, even for
classroom use, should be paid for.
However, the standard copying »ees,
printed on articles are uiually much

too high; they will almost never be
paid. A rule of thumb is needed. I
would suggest that for paper copy
ing, the price be 50 percent of the
physical cost of the copying. Thus if
someone uses the University Library
copying machines at 10 cents per
page, five cents per page would go to
the publisher. How much goes to the
author should be part of the contract
between the author and publisher,
but scientific journals, which ordi
narily don't pay authors, should pay
them part of the copying fee.
This rulp of thumb has nothing
special to recommend it other than
the fact that those who copy can af
ford 50 percent more, and the
amount so collected would be very
substantial to publishers. Since pub
lishing is a competitive business,
substantial collections from copying
would eventually make the price of
books less than they would other
wise be.
