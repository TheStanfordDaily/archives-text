## Cure dooms Social Security

Presented with 97 options to pre

Commission on Social Security Re

The bipartisan "solution" features

the self-employment tax and for the
first time; levying a benefits tax. All
included, these taxes will bring in $88
billion in revenue over the next six
years.
Butin noway does this qualify as a
life preserver for the sinking system.

than their lifetime contributions.

theory but encounter a diminishing
stream of cash paid in. Remember
that the substantial tax increase pac
kage of 1977 was accompanied by
promises that those hikes would
keep Social Security solvent — but
sluggish growth soon exhausted the
Trust Fund.
Tax increases will also aggravate
unemployment and prices.
Employers will have to kick in more
money for each employee, thus the
cost of labor will rise. That rise trans
lates into unemployment and higher
prices.
Clearly, the huge sums that would
be extracted from this planned tax
boost make it mighty appealing to
politicians who thrive on plump,
simple figures. A slightly more
sophisticated review of the proposal
reveals its flaws.

Currently, the payroll tax requires
that workers and employees pay 6.7
percent each. If left undisturbed, this
would reach 7.65 percent by 1990.
Yet the commission proposes to
move the tax increase to the present,
thus generating $135 billion of what
the Commission has mysteriously
named "savings," rather than the
correct term "revenues," by 1990. As
for self-employed workers, the tax
rate would be bumped up from 75
percent to 100 percent of the com
bined payroll tax — though these
workers would later receive a tax
credit of 50 percent. These "savings"
are estimated at $65 billion.
This blast-off in taxes has frightful
effects on capital investment, hence

productivity, and personal income,
hence consumer spending and sav
ing. Slower growth is painful in a
robust economy, but during our
shaky recovery from recession, we
may find the added burden simply
unbearable. Also, why tax retirement
savings — why discourage savings at
all? Taxing benefits above certain in
come levels increases taxes on a re
tiree's savings. And so, it follows, if
you tax savings, you'll get less of it.
Weakening the recovery triggers
upward pressure on the budget de
ficit, at the same time bleeding the
savings pool from which the gov
ernment must borrow to reduce the
deficit.
Labeled a "devastating one-two
punch" for the economy, it is doubt
ful whether the recommended legis
lation can close the funding gap es

The only option that makes sense
— and was absent from the commis
sion's discussion — is cutting be
nefits. The present system can attri
bute its difficulties to the fact that
average retirees can expect to re
ceive benefits greater than their
lifetimecontributions. (Thisincludes
both employer and employees con
tributions.)
A recent study by the Federal Re
serve Bank of New York estimates
that an average single wage earner
retiring in 1982 will recover his or her
lifetime contributions in only 13
months. If a retiree is married with an
unemployed spouse, the payback
period is reduced to nine months.;
Even if lifetime contributions are ad
justed to account for the interest the
contributions would have earned
had they been saved by the worker,
the time it takes to recover them (five
years, four months for a single
worker) is still less than the number
of years the worker is likely to live
beyond retirement.
Using the CPI, which overstates
the rate of inflation, has resulted in a
windfall gain to pensioners. The
commission should find a more'ap
propriate indexing method. Instead,
however, they chose to move back
the benefit adjustment date from July
to January. This will save the fund
from immediate disaster, but the
long term looks bleak.
The commission's only smart re
form, to raise the retirement age
(from 65 to 66,) will not begin until
the turn of thecentury. Too little, too
late.
We can only complain loudly to
seek reform. This system cannot sur
vive indefinitely as a self-financed
program if the imbalance, caused by
paying out more than accrues, per
sists.
