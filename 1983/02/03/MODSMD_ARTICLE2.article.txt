# LOTS faces problems
## 
### FFLICIA LEE Staff writer 
With about 5000 users this quarter
and an increasing student interest in
computer science, the LOTS com
puter facility here has become
"chronically overloaded," according
to director Ralph Corin.
The heavy use of the facility has
created problems such as stringent
limits on the size of computer sci
ence classes and long waits — some
times up to four hours — for free
terminals.
The overload on the computer sys
tem also has had the unpleasant side
effects of slowing down the system's
reaction time and increasing the
likelihood of crashes, according to
Stuart Reges, assistant to the chair
man of the computer science de
partment.
Students using the facility seem to
have grown accustomed to its weak
nesses. When the svstem went down
for about five minutes on Monday

afternoon, students using the system
appeared annoyed, but not sur
prised.
Several of the students using the
system at the time said the crashes
are frequent but not long, and the
system generally starts working again
within 15 minutes of the crash.
According to Reges, the LOTS staff
is aware of the problem and is pre
sently working with several pro
posed solutions. A new computer
was purchased early this fall to re
place a smaller one borrowed from
the Graduate School of Business,
and 63 additional terminals were
added to the LOTS facility.
One of the proposed solutions,
according to Corin, would be the
addition of smaller, personal com
puters to the facility. Personal com
puters, however, may be too small to
handle more complex programs, he
said.

LOTS OF WAITING TIME: Students stand around the entrance to the
LOTS terminal room waiting for an open space. The increased popular
ity of computer classes has led to constant overcrowding and computer
crashes. Some students have had to wait up to four hours to get access to
a terminal.
