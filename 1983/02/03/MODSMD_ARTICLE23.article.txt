## Ursula Oppens and the joy of technical achievement 
### Marc Vincenti 
Ursula Oppens, a young American pianist who is es
pecially devoted to contemporary music, appeared |an.
22 at Herbst Theatre in San Francisco, in a recital that
ranged from 19th-century romanticism to the most up
to-date creation by Elliot Carter. Her playing exhibited
robust and youthful exuberance, natural and unaffected
high spirits, taste, a careful ear, and pleasure in technical
achievement.
Oppens is poised at ease on stage; she smiles and
appears to be enjoying herself. Her frank, direct gaze
emerges owlishly from behind large, wire-rimmed glas
ses, and is complemented by rosy cheeks and honey
coloreo hair. At tense moments during her playing, she
hunches up her shouders and tucks down her chin.
If she is prone to any fault as a pianist, it is one for
which we amateurs may envy her. In the study of a
technically difficult piece, there is an exhilarating mo
ment that happens when, after hours of arduous prac
tice, you finally conquer the work's difficulties. You
have a rush of good feeling, and you play the piece
through with a high-kicking sense of triumph, as if to say
"There! Take that!" In due course, however, you must
come down from this high, and fix your attention upon
matters of interpretation.
Oppens was in such terrific form on Saturday night
that she was entitled to a little of that pure delight that
attends technical triumph — and she certainly needed
every last bit of skill to cope with the Carter piece.

However, when it came to playing Chopin, her virtuosity
sometimes led her into the delicious temptations of
mere bravura.
Her choice of pieces was both historically and musi
cally satisfying. She played eight of Chopin's preludes
and his ballade No. 4, Schumann's "Kreisleriana",
"Night Fantasies" by Carter, and the Sonata No. 1 by
Roger Sessions. Chopin's preludes were beloved by
Schumann, and indeed they partake of Schumann's feel
ing for piano sonority and his rich, muddy, slightly off
key tonal palette. Schumann dedicated his "Kreis
leriana" to Chopin, and, in turn Carter was partly
inspired b\ Kreisleriana' in composing "Night Fan
tasies". The sonata bv Sessions opened the program
with a dose of sanity and clarity; it had the same freshen
ing effect as leading off with a major-key sonata by
Haydn or Mozart.
Sessions' Sonata No. 1 (1927) is a real beauty. It begins
\\ ith quiet simplicity, with a single melodic strand in the
right hand, gentK supported by a strolling bass. The
melody wanders and meditates, with the improvisatory
air of someone who hums idly while performing some
homespun From this plaintive beginning, the
music becomes by turns angry and declamatory, lumin
ous and warm, quizzical and tinkly, and at times unable
to contain itself sheer joy.
The second part ot the sonata is a playful allegro. The
right hand scurries and skitters around like a puppy let
loose for romp, and the left hand skips up and down in
contrary, contrapuntal motion.
Oppen s performance of the piece was sterling: mod
est, unforced, and respectful of the music. She admira
bly sustained the long melodic lines with gently-shaded
dynamics; she shaped the many moods into a meaning
ful whole; and the allegro was as crisp and sparkling as
spring water.
At first glance, Schumann's "Kreisleriana" can seem to
be a puzzling, diffuse composition. The picture is
further clouded by the fact that, even though Schumann
told his wife that she was the main "character" repre
sented in the music, he nevertheless named "Kreis

leriana" after a fictional character from the work of
E.I.A. Hoffmann.
Call them what you will — "fantasies" or "character
sketches" Oppens played these pieces with a flu
ency and coherence that indicated longtime familiarity
withfhe work. The episodes of repose and energy were
dearly contrasted, and an essentially good-natured feel
ing pervaded the whole. Agitation and angst were
downplayed, in favor of an underlying stability. That
strain of fervency that i> uniquely Schumann's was not
allowed to sound like hand-wringing. Instead, it had the
ring of courage.
Oppens played the opening eight measure phrase — a
mounting rush of triplets marked "agitatissimo" — very
fast, so that it emerged as a single forward lunge. The
notes were played evenly, minus their accents. In part
two, she nicely delineated the four interwoven voices,
balancing them with the same attentiveness that one
woud give to a Bach fugue. The melody in part two was
spacious and restful, but, as ever throughout the work,
Oppens did not dwell on it over-luxuriantly. Likewise, in
the middle interlude of part three, the scales that echo
back and forth from treble to bass were solid and hearty.
In fact, throughout the evening, Oppens' lyricism was
much more of the bold and blooming variety than of the
shy and delicate kind. Coyness, languor, hesitation —
these are foreign to Oppens' musical sensibility.
Also in part three of "Kreisleriana", Oppens well con
veyed the meaning of the unfinished cadence, which
breaks the music oft the unresolved dominant and then,
like a dam bursting, unleashes a torrent of triplets in
both hands — a passionate outpouring that dispels itself
by returning to the tonic.
Following "Kreisleriana", as the audience dispersed
for intermission, I heard a man grumble "It sounds like
Beethoven with no point to it." To each his own. But he
couldn't have blamed Oppens, who gave a convincing
performance.
After intermission, Oppens presented "Night Fan
tasies", a major new work by the contemporary com
poser Carter. Oppens herself is one of the four pianists
who joined forces to commission this work from Carter,
and it was she who first performed the work, two years
ago. "Night Fantasies" has four main expressive indica
tions — Tranquillo, Fantastico, Apassionato, and Cap
riccioso — which are said to reflect the personalities of
the four performers who commissioned the work. Car
ter has also described the peice as one which suggests
"the fleeting thoughts that pass through the mind dur
ing a period of wakefulness at night".

To describe "Night Fantasies" as mercurial would be
an understatement. The musical ideas arrive and depart
with such alacrity and unpredictability that they are al
most impossible to recall following the first hearing,
kept wanting to catch the music by its tail, to pin it down,
to make it sit still so I could take its picture. Another
writer has described "Night Fantasies' thusly: rjn "
quility alternates spasmodically with flying Fantastico
gyrations. Rest is never the rule, only the exception in an
increasingly anxious work. In the many subtly shitting
fantasies all registers are constantly sounding. Much of
the writing uses huge expanses of keyboard for two
'voices' moving in contrary motion, constantly dovetail
ing, rarely relaxed, never predictable.
I'm unable to give anything remotely like a definitive
reaction to this piece after a single hearing. I enjoyed it
and wanted to hear it again. In listening to recordings of
Carter's other works, I've found that my second hearing
was always quite a different experience from my first.
Could Oppens have given the work more shape, more
delineation, to help the first-time listener find his/her
way? It's impossible to say. I could only admire her
surpassing dexterity; at times Oppens seemed, in a
single panther-like leap, to strike notes across the entire
range of the keyboard.
Oppens concluded the program with C hopin, and it
was here, especially in the ballade No. 4 in T minor, that
Oppens let her exhilarating virtuosity get the better ot
her musical judgement. No matter how you interpret the
details of the 4th ballade, the piece as a whole must
make dramatic sense. The journey from the brief, sweet,
introductory fragment to the tragic denouement must
seem, for all its digressions, inevitable and unavoidable.
Oppens seemed in a hurry to get through the ballad.
The F-minor theme was played with so much momen
tum that it achieved more the lightness of a waltz than
the gravity of a sicilienne. This was hardly the proper
opening scene for so serious a drama. Fhe massive
c hords of the penultimate climax, marked "stretto, were
so speeded-up and smoothed-over that they lost their
punch. The subsequent coda was played so hurriedly
that there was scarcely time for accent or rhythm; the
ending became a featureless turmoil.
In Davies Hall last year, pianist Shura Cherkassky
worked wonders with this ballade. His version of the
coda was all the more effective for being played with
great clarity and matter-of-factness, without straining for
a tempest of noise. And in his interpretation, the frag
mentary introduction emerged as a single, restful sigh —
as though it were the tail-end of a previous thought,
rather than the prologue to a new drama.
But it's unfair to compare the youthful Oppens with
the venerable Cherkassy — a man who is well over
seventy and brings a lifetime to his music making. Op
pens promises to keep us on our musical toes by unveil
ing more brand-new works.
