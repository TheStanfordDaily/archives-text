# The 						Dream Syndicate's night of wine and feedback
## 
### TERRI SUTTON 
Last Friday's journey up to
San Francisco — through rain,
sleet and too many U-turns —
constituted a traumatic test.
Somehow, though, we found
ourselves inside the Stone,
ready to forget all in the face of
Dream Syndicate's neo
psychadelic blare. Luckily,
they made forgetting easy.
Sometimes criticized for
their extended "jams" ("Who
was that horrible band that
opened lor the Furs?"), Dream
Syndicate apparently decided
to tighten up their show — at
least for one night. As vocalist
Steve Wvnn commented to
one heckler: "This isn't Los
Ang6les . . . we're going to

play a San Francisco set."
Now, I don't know what
Wynn's idea of a San Francisco
set entails (probably differs
from Jerry Garcia's definition),
but Dream Syndicate has been
known to go three hours in Los
Angeles. At the Stone, they
managed a mere hour or so,
finishing off the last encore at
about 1:45 a.m. — plenty late
for the Palo Alto contigent.
Truncated set or no, an hour
was enough to play most of the
gems off their impressive tirst
album, The Days of Wine and
Roses, without sliding into
meandering improvisation.
We could probably argue for
days about the merits of ex
tended guitar feedback, but

personally, I phase out after
two or three minutes. Fortu
nately, on Friday — save for an
interminable version of "Days
of Wine and Roses" — Dream
Syndicate found a marvelous
balance between the melodic
structure of their songs and
guitarist Karl Precoda's ten
dency to wander off (physically
and spiritually) into oblivion.
Propelled by Dennis Duck's
rolling drums and Kendra
Smith's unobtrusive but essen
tial presence on bass, the
songs swept past: not a small
achievement at 1:30 a.m.
However, probably the pri
mary ingredients for Dream
Syndicate's distinctive sound
are Precoda's wild guitarwork
and Wynn's Lou Reedish vocals
— both very much present Fri
day night,
"Then She Remembers," for
instance, attained a blasting
immediacy through Wynn's
straining, frantic vocals, while
"That's What You Always Say"
rumbled moodily with the ten
sion between Synn's under
stated singing and Precoda's
abrasive guitary.
On "Until Lately," Precoda
and Wynn kept building and
developing the sound through
the interplay between their
guitars and Wynn's voice — fi
nally reaching an exhilarating
resolution in the surprisingly
melodious chorus.

Throughout, the two
guitarists const iously balanced
each other: Wynn's wide-open
face and relaxed bantering
with the audience set off the
other-worldly (read: spacev)
self-absorption of the gangly
Precoda, face almost com
pletely obscured by long dark
hair and sunglasses.
At one point, Wynn tried to
get Precoda to snap his fingers
with the beat. Trick ac
complished, Precoda beamed
at the audience, justifiably
proud of his — momentary —
grasp of order and rhythm.
Applause received, he drifted
off once again to his amplifier.

By far the high point of the
evening, though, came at the
second encore, as Wynn in
vited an anonymous individual
from the audience to brave the
stage and sing. Who would that
person be but Stanford's own
Phil Moeller, senior and K/SLJ
music director.
Quickly introduced by
Wynn, Moeller started a bit
raggedly, but found his voice
by the end, singing all the
choruses of "When You Smile"
and exhibiting a properly
psychadelic style of dance.
Questioned after the show
Moeller admitted the early un
evenness was a result of not

remembering the words as
well as being a bit worse for
drink.
Certainly the two opening
bands prior to Dream Syndi
cate excused any excessive
drinking; both incredibly shal
low beneath their fashionable
gloss. I've forgotten the first
band's name, actually the sec
ond band of the evening, but
they symbolized the worst in
dulgences of the Duran Duran
school of Europop. As Elvis
Costello once said of Styx, I'd
like to know the band's name if
only to avoid them in the fu
ture.

one heckler: "This isn't Los
Ang6les . . . we're going to

play a San Francisco set."
Now, I don't know what
Wynn's idea of a San Francisco
set entails (probably differs
from Jerry Garcia's definition),
but Dream Syndicate has been
known to go three hours in Los
Angeles. At the Stone, they
managed a mere hour or so,
finishing off the last encore at
about 1:45 a.m. — plenty late
for the Palo Alto contigent.
Truncated set or no, an hour
was enough to play most of the
gems off their impressive tirst
album, The Days of Wine and
Roses, without sliding into
meandering improvisation.
We could probably argue for
days about the merits of ex
tended guitar feedback, but

personally, I phase out after
two or three minutes. Fortu
nately, on Friday — save for an
interminable version of "Days
of Wine and Roses" — Dream
Syndicate found a marvelous
balance between the melodic
structure of their songs and
guitarist Karl Precoda's ten
dency to wander off (physically
and spiritually) into oblivion.
Propelled by Dennis Duck's
rolling drums and Kendra
Smith's unobtrusive but essen
tial presence on bass, the
songs swept past: not a small
achievement at 1:30 a.m.
However, probably the pri
mary ingredients for Dream
Syndicate's distinctive sound
are Precoda's wild guitarwork
and Wynn's Lou Reedish vocals
— both very much present Fri
day night,
"Then She Remembers," for
instance, attained a blasting
immediacy through Wynn's
straining, frantic vocals, while
"That's What You Always Say"
rumbled moodily with the ten
sion between Synn's under
stated singing and Precoda's
abrasive guitary.
On "Until Lately," Precoda
and Wynn kept building and
developing the sound through
the interplay between their
guitars and Wynn's voice — fi
nally reaching an exhilarating
resolution in the surprisingly
melodious chorus.

Throughout, the two
guitarists const iously balanced
each other: Wynn's wide-open
face and relaxed bantering
with the audience set off the
other-worldly (read: spacev)
self-absorption of the gangly
Precoda, face almost com
pletely obscured by long dark
hair and sunglasses.
At one point, Wynn tried to
get Precoda to snap his fingers
with the beat. Trick ac
complished, Precoda beamed
at the audience, justifiably
proud of his — momentary —
grasp of order and rhythm.
Applause received, he drifted
off once again to his amplifier.

By far the high point of the
evening, though, came at the
second encore, as Wynn in
vited an anonymous individual
from the audience to brave the
stage and sing. Who would that
person be but Stanford's own
Phil Moeller, senior and K/SLJ
music director.
Quickly introduced by
Wynn, Moeller started a bit
raggedly, but found his voice
by the end, singing all the
choruses of "When You Smile"
and exhibiting a properly
psychadelic style of dance.
Questioned after the show
Moeller admitted the early un
evenness was a result of not

remembering the words as
well as being a bit worse for
drink.
Certainly the two opening
bands prior to Dream Syndi
cate excused any excessive
drinking; both incredibly shal
low beneath their fashionable
gloss. I've forgotten the first
band's name, actually the sec
ond band of the evening, but
they symbolized the worst in
dulgences of the Duran Duran
school of Europop. As Elvis
Costello once said of Styx, I'd
like to know the band's name if
only to avoid them in the fu
ture.
