# The
						low-key return of Chet Baker
## 
### TED GIOIA 
For an artist so closely af
filiated with the "West Coast"
school of jazz, Chet Baker has
made surprisingly few Califor
nia appearances over the past
decade. That is, until La
Boheme, Saratoga's jazz nit
ery, gave local fans an oppor
tunity to savor Baker's distinc
tive trumpet stylings by bring
ing his trio in for a week stand.
Baker's low profile is by no
means a sign of public in
difference; rather, it has been
the trumpeter's long struggle
with drug and health.problems
that has often curtailed his
public visibility. Most recently,
Baker was forced into a brief
respite from playing when an
encounter with hoodlums left
him without a number of teeth.
Vet after adapting himself to
dentures, Baker re-emerged
on the jazz scene, and his play
ing, at least in my opinion, was
better than it had been in
years.
Baker's strength has always
been as a melodicist. His early
work with baritone saxiphonist
Gerry Mulligan was notewor
thy for the trumpeter's sparse
and thoughtful solos. His re
cording of "My Funny Valen
tine," recorded at this time,
was both a commercial and ar

tistic success, and established
Baker as one of the most im
portant exponents of "cool
jazz."
Yet, the successful career,
which "My Funny Valentine"
seemed to promise never fully
materialized. Baker recorded
extensively, both as a trumpe
ter and a vocalist, but with few
exceptions the albums were
quite poor. At the same time
Baker was struggling with a
host of problems, both legal
and medical, stemming from
his drug addiction.
His playing during the late
'60s and early '70s often
seemed to find Baker in the
midst of an identity crisis. At
times he would play in the lyri
cal and evocative manner that
had characterized his work
with Mulligan; yet more often
his trumpet work would be
fiery, dynamic and uncomfort
ably verbose. His reunion with
Mulligan, recorded and made
available on two separate al
bums, bore little resemblance
to the work the two had done
years before; one sensed that
Baker saw the "cool" label as a
stigma to be overcome rather
than as an accurate description
of his work.
But with his most recent re
turn to jazz, Baker has dis

played a firmer knowledge of
what he wants to achieve in
music; not surprisingly, the
trumpeter has returned to the
melodic and thoughtful ap
proach to improvisation which
has always characterized his
best work.
Whether due to the awk
wardness of his dentures or
simply to age, Baker plays with
extreme restraint. He blows
from a sitting position, and his
sound is so soft that, even in a
small club such as La Boheme,
it must be amplified by a mike
placed virtually inside the bell
of the trumpet. The resulting
tone is warm and breathy, even
when Baker is negotiating a dit
ficult string of sixteenth notes.
At La Boheme, Baker was
joined by bassist Frank Tusa
and guitarist Bddie Duran.
Baker, always eclectic, moved
from trumpet to drums to
piano and back again; occa
sionally he would sing a
number in his husky and vib
ratoless voice. The trio was at
its best when Baker kept to his
trumpet; the lack of a drum
mer gave the group's melodic
lines added clarity and depth.
Both Duran and Tusa played
with more restraint than one
typically finds in their work.
Duran in particular, brought

out more of the lim Hall and
Wes Montgomery elements in
his playing than is usually the
case.
The group worked its way
through a variety of originals
and standards. Baker sang a
chorus of "My Funny Valen
tine," before playing a trumpet
solo which sounded surpris
ingly fresh when one considers
how often he has performed
that piece in the past.
Richie Beirach's composi
tion "Leaving" was the most
successful peice of the even
ing. Here bassist Tusa, no
doubt impressed by Baker's
practice of playing musical
chairs, moved to piano for a
stately introductory chorus,
before racing back to his bass
to complete the tune. Baker
followed with a slightly
Spanish-tinged solo which was
quite pretty.
La Boheme, which seats no
more than 50 or 60 people, was
packed for the performance.
Usually a venue for local musi
cians this tine restaurant/club
has proven that non-Bay Area
musicians do have followings
on the Peninsula. In this regard
La Boheme has taken more ot a
chance than any number of
local clubs.
