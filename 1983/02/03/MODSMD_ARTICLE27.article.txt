### LISA LYNCH Staff writer 
Stanford junior Neil MacAvoy
pleaded not guilty to c harges of pos
session and importation of con
trolled substances at his San lose
Municipal Court arraignment Mon
day afternoon.
MacAvoy, who was arrested on
Oct. 7 for possession of hashish, was
charged on three felony counts:
possession with intent to sell of
marijuana, possession with intent to
sell of cocaine, and importation of a
controlled substance.
A pre-trial hearing is scheduled for
April 25 and MacAvoy will be tried
May 3.
lohn Conneely, MacAvoy's lawyer,
said that the defense would attempt
to establish MacAvoy's good reputa
tion.
"There's more involved here than
just facts," said Conneelv. "Neil's

never been in trouble before. The
courts are |ust trying to make an
example out of him."
MacAvoy's room was searched
during his Oct. 7 arrest, after he al
legedly accepted a package of hash
ish mailed to him from China. Sev
eral bags of marijuana, slightly less
than one half-ounce of cocaine, and
scales coated with cocaine residue
were seized as evidence.
A felony charge is punishable by a
jail sentence, but Conneely said he
thought it doubtful that MacAvoy
would go to jail. "He could conceiv
ably be sentenced to the state prison,
but I find this unlikely," he said. Ac
cording to Conneely, MacAvoy, if
convicted, would not be sentenced
until early )une.
"I cio feel confident he'll be able to
finish his junior year at Stanford,"
Conneely said.
