Israelis, Marine stand off
Beirut, Lebanon — A U.S. Marine captain
drew his pistol and climbed uponanlsraelitank
'.o prevent it and two others from
moving through an American checkpoint here.
In Washington, the Reagan administration
reacted sharply to the incident. Acting Secre
tary of State Kenneth Dam called in the Israeli
charge d'affaires "to discuss this incident and
the gravity with which wo view it," State Depart
ment spokesman Alan Romberg said.
He said that "the recurrence of challenges to
the Marines by Israeli Defense Forces is unac
ceptable" and "hampers the peacekeeping ef
forts" of the multinational force. "We don't un

derstand the motivation for this action," he
said.
Col. Tom Stokes, commander of the Marines
in Lebanon, identified the officer involved as
Capt. Charles Johnson, 30, of Rock Island, 111.
He said that when Johnson saw the tanks
moving at battle speed toward his checkpoint,
which is manned by Lebanese army troops as
well as Marines, he feared that a serious inci
dent might develop, so he moved several hun
dred vards down the road and waited.
Cranston to run in '84
Washington — Calling for an end to "the in
credibly dangerous, shamefully expensive arms

race," Sen. Man Cranston yesterday formally
became the first 1984 presidential candidate.
Getting a brief jump on his better known
Democratic rivals, the California senator
opened his campaign in the marble-columned
Senate Caucus Room before a cheering crowd
of supporters. He then flew to Manchester,
New Hampshire, to repeat his announcement
in the state which will hold 1984's first presiden
tial primarv.
The 68-vear-old Cranston was regarded as a
longshot prospect for the Democratic nomi
nation. Most polls show him trailing Vice Presi
dent Walter Mondale and Sen. John Glenn of
Ohio.
