Israelis, Marine stand off
Beirut, Lebanon — A U.S. Marine captain
drew his pistol and climbed uponanlsraelitank
'.o prevent it and two others from
moving through an American checkpoint here.
In Washington, the Reagan administration
reacted sharply to the incident. Acting Secre
tary of State Kenneth Dam called in the Israeli
charge d'affaires "to discuss this incident and
the gravity with which wo view it," State Depart
ment spokesman Alan Romberg said.
He said that "the recurrence of challenges to
the Marines by Israeli Defense Forces is unac
ceptable" and "hampers the peacekeeping ef
forts" of the multinational force. "We don't un

derstand the motivation for this action," he
said.
Col. Tom Stokes, commander of the Marines
in Lebanon, identified the officer involved as
Capt. Charles Johnson, 30, of Rock Island, 111.
He said that when Johnson saw the tanks
moving at battle speed toward his checkpoint,
which is manned by Lebanese army troops as
well as Marines, he feared that a serious inci
dent might develop, so he moved several hun
dred vards down the road and waited.
Cranston to run in '84
Washington — Calling for an end to "the in
credibly dangerous, shamefully expensive arms

race," Sen. Man Cranston yesterday formally
became the first 1984 presidential candidate.
Getting a brief jump on his better known
Democratic rivals, the California senator
opened his campaign in the marble-columned
Senate Caucus Room before a cheering crowd
of supporters. He then flew to Manchester,
New Hampshire, to repeat his announcement
in the state which will hold 1984's first presiden
tial primarv.
The 68-vear-old Cranston was regarded as a
longshot prospect for the Democratic nomi
nation. Most polls show him trailing Vice Presi
dent Walter Mondale and Sen. John Glenn of
Ohio.
Asked how he planned to overcome the leads
of such rivals, Cranston said his strategy con
sisted of "my message, organization, raising
money" and expanding his base in California
into other states of the West and the Sunbelt.
The senator's message clearly was that he is
the candidate committed to negotiating an end
to the nuclear arms race.
President cautions Fed
Washington — President Reagan, fearful that
an overly stringent monetary policy could keep
interest rates high and choke off recovery,
urged the Federal Reserve Board yesterday to
pursue a "moderate rate" of growth in the na
tion's money supply this year to help restore ec
onomic vitality.
Although acknowledging the importance of
a tight-money policy to his administration's
fight against inflation, the president never
theless cautioned that too tight a grip on the
money supply could reduce the financial re
sources needed to lift the economy out of its
doldrums.
In his annual economic report to Congress,
which projects a slow upturn in 1983 that will
gain more momentum by year's end, Reagan
said that the Federal Reserve plays a critical role
in attaining a "sound and sustainable" econom
ic recovery.
The report was issued as the Fed was prepar
ing its growth targets for the money supply in
1983. Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker
will formally present the new targets in testi
mony later this month before the Senate Bank
ing Committee.
Volcker is expected to encounter trouble in
holding to last year's narrow growth ranges.
With unemployment at a post-Depression high
of 10.8 percent and the first signs of recovery
only faintly detected, pressure is mounting on
the Fed to boost the economy by permitting the
money stock to grow faster.
Shultz opens talks
Peking — Secretary of State George Shultz
opened a round of talks with Chinese leaders
yesterday, hoping to restore some balance to
what has become a shaky relationship and call
ing publicly for a "serious, constructive, re
sponsible" exchange.

Shultz and Foreign Minister Wu Xueqian
brushed past the customary celebration of the
U.S.-China strategic relationship in a per
functory 30 minute opening round of meetings,
U.S. officials said, then began a lengthy ex
change on two subjects of disagreement be
tween China and the United States: the Middle
East and southern Africa.
But the emphasis on both sides was plainly on
conducting the talks in an atmosphere divorced
not only of the dispute over U.S. arms sales to
Taiwan, which was grudgingly solved only last
August, but also from the euphoria of excessive
expectations that marked the relationship in
the immediate aftermath of the 1979 nor
malization agreement, when the Carter admin
istration saw China as a quasi-ally against the So
viet Union.
Reagan may alter budget
Washington — Under bipartisan pressure in
Congress, administration officials dropped the
first hints yesterday they may compromise on
President Reagan's new budget by accepting
cuts in the proposed $35 billion defense in
crease and by going along with a jobs program
aimed at the nation's worst-off areas.
One of the hints came from Secretary of the
Treasury Donald Regan, who told the House
Budget Committee that he may compromise —
after Democrats present alternative spending
or taxation plans.
Another came from Budget Director David
Stockman who, facing Republican critics on the
Senate Budget Committee, said of the adminis
tration's military spending plan: "If you can find
things in there you can persuade the adminis
tration we don't need, I'm sure the people are
going to listen."
Reagan meets with Jews
Washington — President Reagan, meeting
with Jewish leaders from 66 nations, called
upon the Israelis and Arabs yesterday to show
"negotiating flexibility" and "take the neces
sary risks" to achieve a permanent peace in the
Middle East.
Two of the leaders later told reporters that
Reagan had indicated during a private meeting
that Jordan's King Hussein would enter the
Mideast peace process — something the United
States has been pressing for — once Israeli and

other foreign troops begin to leave war-torn
Lebanon and if Israel gave assurances it would
not add to its West Bank settlements during
Palestinian autonomy talks.
But White House spokesman Larry Speakes
said that this report of Reagan's private com
ments was not "entirely accurate." And two
other administration officials, who declined to
be identified, said that Hussein had made no
commitment to begin bargaining with the Is
raelis. Hussein's involvement is generally re
garded as necessary to break the long stalemate
in the Middle East peace process, which began
with the 1978 Camp David accords.
Terrorists may mar Olympics
Washington — Sen. Jeremiah Denton (R-
Ala.) chairman of the Senate Judiciary subcom
mittee on terrorism, said yesterday the panel
has received information from various sources
that "terrorist groups may be preparing to ex
ploit" the 1984 Olympic Games in Los Angeles.
Denton did not elaborate, but a subcommit
tee source said the panel received the informa
tion about two months ago from"the Los An
geles police community and federal law en
forcement."
"There is information about people going to
Lebanon for (terrorist) training and then com
ing back to the United States," the subcommit
tee source said. He said the subcommittee had
no information to show that these people are
now in Los Angeles. "You're not going to get a
road map" from terrorists, the source said.
Denton cited the possibility of terrorist out
breaks at the Olympics in his opening statement
at an FBI oversight hearing.
Market; trading steady
The stock market showed scattered gains to
day, steadying after Tuesday's sharp decline.
Trading was moderate.
Analysts said many investors were convinced
that a recovery from the recession was at hand,
if not already under,way, but the rise in interest
rates in the credit markets and the federal defi
cit raised concern.
Today's weather
Chance of showers. Lows in the mid 50s. 40 per
cent chance of rain.
