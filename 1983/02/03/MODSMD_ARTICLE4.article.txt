# Shultz to speak at graduation
## 
### DOUGLAS JEHL Senior staff writer 
Secretary of State George Shultz
will he the featured speaker at the
University's 92nd annual com
mencement this June.
Shultz, who maintains a home on
campus, is on leave from the
Graduate School of Business here.
He had been a part-time professor
for eight years when President Re
agan chose him to replace Alexander
Haig in the State Department.
In a letter received Tuesday by
University President Donald Ken
nedy, Shultz said he would be "hon
ored to speak at Stanford," accord
ing to Marlene Wine, special assis
tant to the president. Kennedy ex
tended the invitation in a letter to
Shultz around Christmas after the
commencement speakers panel had
recommended him unanimously.
The letter was "very brief," Wine
said. "He just apologized for the
delay and said he had been traveling
a lot."
Shultz, in Peking to open a round
of talks with Chinese leaders, was
unavailable for comment. He spoke
yesterday with Foreign Minister Wu
Xuequian. The State Department had
no prepared statement from Shultz.
He headed a list submitted to Ken
nedy by the advisory group made up
of Wine, two senior class presidents
and faculty and staff members, ac
cording to member Katy Dore, a
senior class president.
Among others on the list were Wil
liam Hewlett and David Packard,
founders of Hewlett-Packard;

Richard Lyman, former University
president now president of Rockefel
ler Foundation; and Robert
Rosenzweig, former University vice
president for public affairs now pres
ident of the American Association of
Universities, according to Wine and
Kevin O'Beirne, a senior class presi
dent.
They and other panel members
said they were pleased with Shultz's
acceptance. "It's wonderful news,"
said Robert Hamerton-Kelly, dean of
the chapel. "I think he's probably the
most interesting person in the ad
ministration, and certainly its most
responsible statesman.
O'Beirne and Wine both ex
pressed concern that State Depart
ment duties of the secretaryship
might prevent Shultz from speaking
here. "There's always some danger
in appointing someone that impor
tant," O'Beirne said. He cited as an
example British Prime Minister Mar
garet Thatcher, the first choice in
1980, who originally planned to
speak but finally had to decline the
invitation.
Shultz, former president of the
Bechtel Group and former dean of
the University of Chicago's Graduate
School of Business, is also the only
person in U.S. history to hold three
different Cabinet posts in the same
administration. He served as secre
tary of labor, director of the office of
management and budget and secre
tary of treasury under President
Richard Nixon.
He is the fifth major U.S. govern
ment official tapped as commence

ment speaker here in the last six
years. Supreme Court lustice Sandra
Day O'Connor spoke last year; Dep
uty Secretary of State Warren Christ
opher in 1981; U.N. Ambassador An
drew Young in 1979; and then-Food
and Drug Administration commis
sioner Donald Kennedy in 1978. Dr.
Lewis Thomas, author of Lives of a
Cell was the featured speaker in
1980.
Commencement is scheduled this
year for 10 a.m. Sunday, June 12. The
program, to be held in the 12,000-
person capacity Frost Amphitheater,
is open to ticket-halders only.
