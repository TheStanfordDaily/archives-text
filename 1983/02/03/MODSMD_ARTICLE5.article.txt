# University may fund COP salaries
## 
### TIM GRIEVE Staff writer 
The ASSU and the Office of the
Dean of Student Affairs will ask the
University for $"17,000 to pay three
<ourths of the salaries of top
officials next year.
Robert Brody, the ASSU's financial
manager, said he believes the Uni
versity should help pay the salaries
because the University wants the
students to have a government.
The organization will request the
money to pay 75 percent of the
salaries for the Council of Presidents,
the senate chair, and the deputy sen
ate chair, according to COP member
Mark Epstein.
"The ASSU receives no funds from
the student body. The University
feels the student body should have a
government. Therefore, the Univer
sity should pay for it, just as it pays for
the faculty senate," Brody said.
Brody said the ASSU is also re
questing the money because the
group is "less willing to live in a less
stable financial atmosphere than it
was in the past. It wants to be more

stable, and the way to achieve long
term stability is to be more financially
stable."
The ASSU will continue to pay the
remaining 25 percent, Epstein said,
as an incentive to keep the ASSU
from raising salaries. COP members
and the senate chair each receive
salaries equal to roughly half the cost
of tuition, while the deputy senate
chair receives $900 per year.
Associate Provost Tim Warner said
he did not know if the ASSU's re
quest would be approved because
he has not seen the complete propo
sal. He did say, however, that "new
expenditures in the budget are
under a lot of pressure because of
the budget strain."
If the provost's office approves the
request, it will not be the first time
that the University has paid the
salaries of the association's top offi
cers; up until 1975, the University did
fund some ASSU salaries.
But in the budget negotiations that
year, University budget cutbacks and
ASSU profits led the two groups to
agree to end the practice.

Fpslein said that in 1975 the ASSU's
travel service made $35,000 and the
ASSU's special events program
earned $50,000. However, both pro
grams have since been discontinued.
He said that fear of conflict of
interest also influenced the group's
decision to stop taking University
funds. "The leaders thought if would
be best not to accept the money be
cause they (the University) might
have used it as leverage," Epstein ex
plained.
"In 1975 a lot of the activities the
ASSU was involved in were emo
tional, angry, and hostile, and an
emotional, angry, and hostile thing
to do would have been to take away
the money. That isn't a fear we have
anymore. It's not a fear we can afford
to have anymore in dollars and
cents," he said.
Epstein and Brody both claim that a
conflict of interest could not occur
now because the University is unable
to fire COP members.
While the University could
threaten to stop paying the salaries,
Epstein said the ASSU could pay the
salaries with some budget changes.
ASSU Senator lames McGrath
agreed that a conflict of interest is
not likely. "Half of Bob's (Brody) sal
ary is paid by the University, and I
don't think he's ever been under
University pressure. Their (ASSU of
ficials') loyalties are to the students
because the students elected them.

The salary doesn't make that much
difference," McCrath said.
Margaret Ann Fidler, assistant
dean of student affairs, said that as
part of the agreement to give the
ASSU money, the University may
want to establish a University-run fi
nancial advisory board for the ASSU.
Although Epstein said he had not
heard about it, he welcomed the idea
of an advisory board.
"I have no problem with that as
long as it (the board) doesn't have
any power. Consultation is a healthy
thing," he said.
