# Air Force head visits Hoover
## Orr blasts social funds 
### ALAN TRIPP Senior staff writer 
Spending on social programs, not
defense expenditures, is responsible
for the record-breaking deficit proj
ected by the Reagan administration's
1984 budget, the secretary of the air
force said yesterday.
Following a closed meeting with
Hoover Institute fellows, Verne Orr
commented on mounting defense
costs, the MX missile, the administra
tion's approach to arms talks and the
effects of freezing military salaries at
current levels.
"Under President Carter defense
funding fell to a low of 5.5 percent of
the GNP, half of what it was under
another democrat, President Ken
nedy — before the Vietnam War,"
Orr told the Daily. "If we get our
budgets for the next three years, we
will be spending 7 percent of the
GNP on defense."
Contradicting recent news re
ports, Orr said that government so
cial programs would not suffer as a
result of the defense build-up. He
predicted that the "real costs of so
cial and domestic programs will in
crease in 1984 as well."
Still, he said that "readjustment"
was needed, and compared a 217
percent real increase in social spend
ing over the past 20 years with an
increase of 12 percent in defense
spending during the same period.
Additional defense spending will
be concentrated on strategic
weapons and defenses. The B-1
Bomber, the Trident submarine,
sophisticated communications sys
tems and the MX missile will soak up
most of the new funding, according
to Orr.
Orr emphasized the importance of

the MX and denied reports of dissen
sion among the joint chiefs of staff
regarding the dense-pack proposal.
"The joint chiefs have always sup
ported the concept of dense-pack.
The MX is absolutely necessary. We
must maintain the three legs of the
triad: the bombers, the submarines
and the ICBMs (Inter-Continental
Ballistic Missiles.)
"Without the triad, we will not be
able to maintain deterrence. The
heart of the triad is deterrence. We
must have sufficient forces to say to
the Soviets don't attack us'," he
said.
On the sub|ect of arms control,
Orr emphasized the importance of
bargaining from a "position of
strength."
"You are not going to bring them
to the table unless you can convince
them that you are for real. The
Soviets are now talking arms control
— why? — because we are getting
ready to put Pershings and ground
launc hed cruise missiles in F urope. If
we back away from that, they won't
be interested in arms con
trol.They've got a tremendous
superiority," he said.
Orr's evaluation of the Soviet per
spective on the nuclear balance did
not differ substantially from that of
other administration members. "We
have 1000 minutemen missiles in
silos. They have enough ICBMs to
target every minuteman silo that we
have and take them out on a first
strike basis. Now you haven't got
much deterrent left as far as that leg
(of the triad) is concerned. In World
War II the Soviets absorbed 20 mil
lion deaths and didn't think a thingof
it. They are not concerned about the
loss of civilian manpower."
In addition to forcing arms negoti
ations, Orr said that the function of
the military was to "keep us strong."
He said that the relative peace of the
past 40 years is a direct result of U.S.
military strength.
Orr refuted criticism of the de

fense budget's emphasis on pro
curement and denial of pay hikes for
personnel, something which could
cause problems for the highly tech
nical military which depends on re
enlistments to keep it running.
"There would be a problem with the
military pay-freeze if it went on for a
couple of years. You can't go on
forever without a pay increase but for
one year it isn't going to be signifi
cant." Orr said he expected to make
up the loss in next year's budget.
