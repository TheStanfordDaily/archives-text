## OPEC meeting encounters obstacles, ends in failure Local profs, warn of problems ahead 
### KEVIN GROSS 
Local experts warn lower oil
prices will he advantageous to
some countries, but will spell
trouble for others, according
to several professors here who
were asked to analyze the ef
fects of the OPEC summit col
lapse.
According to Economics
Prof. Bert Hickman, it is gener
ally true that lower oil prices
will be good for nations which
import large quantities of oil.
"One direct effect is that a re
duction in oil prices will tend to
reduce prices here; and that
can then have indirect favor
able effects here," Hickman
said. With economic recovery
beginning, lower oil prices
could help stimulate the
economies of several industrial
nations, including Japan,
which is heavily dependent on
oil.
On theotherhand. Hickman
said, "It is obvious that a sub
stantial decline in prices could
impact against oil-producing
nations. . . this can adversely
affect our exports to oil pro
ducers, and we do a lot of ex
porting to Mexico.
In addition to the industri
alized nations, many develop
ing nations import large quan
tities of petroleum. With the
substantial rise in oil prices in
recent years, some of the Third
World nations have tried to
rely less on oil and more on
alternative sources of energy.
"For these countries, I think
it would be a mistake to start
depending on oil and import
ing a lot of oil," said Economics
Prof. Debra) Ray. "A lot of im
porters may feel that it is good

to import more oil to use as
energy in production. When
the prices go up later on, it will
be more difficult to adjust. . .
Thev will have problems it they
depend too much on the glut."
Over the past two years,
many countries have benefited
from the gradual decline in oil
prices, and the main purpose
of the now-aborted cartel
meeting was to set new pro
duction level to stop the price
slide. The real question in
breaking the OPEC price is:
"What will this mean for the
long-term price relationships
and the long-term supply rela
tionships?" said Clarke
Reynolds, professor at the
Food Research Institute.
It will cause rethinking on
both sides, he said. "You are
going to get a world reaction. If
the world economy gets mov
ing again, it will be on a
different track. More units of
growth, but using less oil. You
will see a recovery in prices."
Part of the recent decline in
oil prices is due to the adjust
ment by importing nations to
the price rises of the seventies.
The net importers have ad
justed through inflation (and
the current recession) and by
shifting to alternative forms of
energy.
"The oil producing countries
raised the price very signifi
cantly in the early seventies
and it gave them a huge edge in
liquidity," said Reynolds.
"The increase in the price of
oil from 1973 to 1979 is one
tourth of the entire value of
world trade during that
period."
