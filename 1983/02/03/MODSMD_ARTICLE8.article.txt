Compiled from news reports and wire services
It almost succeeded. A tentative agreement
on petroleum production quotas had been
worked out in Geneva by the 13 OPEC oil minis
ters. Even Venezuela had approved the new
agreement, despite earlier rumors that it would
reject lower quotas tor its oil production.
On Monday morning, newspapers around the
world reported that OPEC had approved a new
pricing and production agreement. The oil
world was shocked 24 hours later when Sheik
Ahmed Yamani, Saudi Arabia's oil minister an
nounced that the meeting "was a total failure."
Unexpected, the meetings' breakdown is said
to be connected to Saudi displeasure with other
OPEC nations suspected of secretly cutting oil
prices.
Since 1981, Saudi Arabian oil production had
dropped from a peak level of 11 million barrelsa
day to its current level of 5 million barrels a day.
The Saudis, who have maintained the OPEC
benchmark price ot $34 a barrel, wanted to stop
other OPEC producers who are accused of giv
ing under-the-table discounts which served to
undermine the Saudi market and to increase
their own production levels.

Saudi Arabia suggested in early January that
some of the other CSPEC nations should meet in
Bahrain to save OPEC and preserve world oil
prices. At this earlier meeting, ministers had
reached an accord which would have main
tained the current OPEC oil price at $34 barrel,
and would have set production quotas for all
OPEC members.
Although he had publicly forecasted success
for the Geneva conference a few days earlier,
Yamani reported privately that he believed the
talks would fail over production quotas.
The delegates surprised everyone, including
Yamani, when they quickly reached agreement
on the new quotas which would limit OPEC pro
duction to 17 to 17.5 million barrels a day.
Among those in agreement was Iran, which has
irritated other OPEC members in recent weeks
by ignoring its production quotas and discount
ing its oil. Iranians said they were willing to cut
back on production and eliminate discounting.
When Venezuela agreed to cut back current
production of 1.9 to 1.7 million, the Saudis then
then demanded the Nigeria, Libya and Algeria
effectively raise their prices for their superior
grade of crude oil. The nations balked and the
meeting dissolved in chaos.
