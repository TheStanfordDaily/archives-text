Th e b r e a k d o w no 112 the
emergency OPEC meeting in
Geneva last week has set the
stage tor a decline in oil prices
and further cutbacks in pro
duction for Saudi Arabia and its
allies on the Arabian Peninsula.
Yet, while a worldwide reces
sion continues to sustain an oil
glut, a price drop might
undermine conservation ef
forts and intensify the interna
tional debt c risis.
The failure of the cartel to
agree on reductions in produc
tion should lead to a decline in
the price of oil over the next
few weeks. Economists have
forecast a possible drop of $2
to $10 a barrel from the current
world average of about $33 for
a 42-gallon barrel.
For American consumers
this translates into a price re
duction of two cents per gallon
for every $1 drop in the price
per barrel. More importantly, a
price reduction for petroleum
oroducts could help pull the

U.S. economy out ot the cur
rent recession. One Wharton
economist predicted that a $5
per barrel drop in oil prices
could create 400,000 new jobs
by the end of 1983.
Reduced import fuel hills
will also be welcomed overseas
by other industrialized coun
tries. The Japanese rely on im
ported oil to supply b4 percent
of their energy needs and the
British are confident that lost
oil income will be offset by ris
ing exports.
Although several analysts
feel that fears of major financial
disasters from loan detaults
have been overstated, most
agree that price reductions will
create problems for Mexico.
Nigeria, Venezuela and other
oil producing countries with
large foreign debts, lust a $2
reduction in the price oil could
leave Mexico without enough
money to service its foreign
debt, despite the $8.9 billion
financial aid package put to
gether by world bankers last
year.
