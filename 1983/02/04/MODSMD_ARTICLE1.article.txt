# Reagan budget cuts aid
## 
### JOHN KLEINHEINZ 
President Reagan's proposed 1984
budget went to Congress this week
with changes that could shrink finan
cial aid available to Stanford students
while substantially increasing re
search funding here.
In actual dollar amounts federal
student aid will probably not de
crease, yet certain changes may
make it tougher for students here to
get aid.
While funding for Basic Educa
tional Opportunity Grants (BEOG)
would increase by $295 million in
1984, "the catch is these funds will he
available to fewer students, in par
ticular those at private schools with
high tuitions," according to lonathan
Brown, assistant director of the As
sociation of Independent California
Colleges and Universities.
Brown and several Stanford offi
cials are in Washington lobbying
against changes in federal student
aid programs and talking with mem
bers of Congress about the proposed
budget.
"The 1984 budget is the opening
salvo in a bargaining battle — it could
never get through as it is now,"
Robert Freelen, associate vice
president for public affairs, said.
"What Reagan would like to do is
just lop some off the top," Freelan
said.
While student aid is getting leaner,
research money should increase in
1984, according to Gerald Lieber
man, dean of graduate studies and
research.
The University relies on the gov
ernment for much of its graduate re
search money and generally ranks
among the top five universities in
federally funded research volume.
Last year the University received $136
million in research money.
"All of the numbers are not in yet
but from what we've seen so far re
search funding should fair well,"
Lieberman said.
Funding for the National Science
Foundation (NSF) is up 18 percent in
the 1984 budget. The University gets
roughly a quarter of its research
money from the NSF. Lieberman said
he has not seen the figures for the
National Institute of Health (NIH),
which provides Stanford with 40 per
cent of its research money, but ex
pects the NIH budget to increase.
Student loan programs could fair
badly if the new budget is passed in
its present form. The National Direct
Student Loan (NDSL) program is to
receive no funding in the 1984 plan
while Guaranteed Student Loans
(GSL) are to be slashed by $153 mil
lion.
The 1984 federal budget will not
aid programs until the 1984-85 school
year.
Congress still has to approve
Reagan's budget and historically stu
dent loan programs have held high
priority on Capitol Hill.
"It's unlikely that we will see major
changes in these programs for a
couple of years," Robert Huff, di
rector of financial aids, said.
"All of the student aid programs

will go to Congress for 'reauthoriza
tion' in 1986. They (Congress) will
decide what sort of changes to make
at that time. Until then it's doubtful
that substantial changes will occur,"
Huff said.
According to Freelen, lobbyists on
behalf of higher education are going
to try to convince Congress that
maintaining a well-trained reservoir
of technical talent requires providing
some mechanism to pay for their
education. "It's the same argument
we've used the last two years — and
it's worked," he said.
Money given directly to the Uni
versity for student aid in the form of
Supplementary Educational Oppor
tunity Grants (SEOG) could be en
tirely eliminated under the proposed
federal budget.
SEOG funds would be switched in
stead to the Work-Study program.
Work-Study would receive $850 mil
lion in 1984, up almost $310 million.
