President Reagan's proposed 1984
budget went to Congress this week
with changes that could shrink finan
cial aid available to Stanford students
while substantially increasing re
search funding here.
In actual dollar amounts federal
student aid will probably not de
crease, yet certain changes may
make it tougher for students here to
get aid.
While funding for Basic Educa
tional Opportunity Grants (BEOG)
would increase by $295 million in
1984, "the catch is these funds will he
available to fewer students, in par
ticular those at private schools with
high tuitions," according to lonathan
Brown, assistant director of the As

Colleges and Universities.
Brown and several Stanford offi

against changes in federal student
aid programs and talking with mem

budget.
"The 1984 budget is the opening
salvo in a bargaining battle â€” it could
never get through as it is now,"
Robert Freelen, associate vice
president for public affairs, said.
"What Reagan would like to do is
just lop some off the top," Freelan
said.
While student aid is getting leaner,
research money should increase in
1984, according to Gerald Lieber
man, dean of graduate studies and
research.
The University relies on the gov
ernment for much of its graduate re
search money and generally ranks
among the top five universities in
federally funded research volume.
Last year the University received $136
million in research money.
"All of the numbers are not in yet
but from what we've seen so far re
search funding should fair well,"
Lieberman said.
Funding for the National Science
Foundation (NSF) is up 18 percent in
the 1984 budget. The University gets
roughly a quarter of its research
money from the NSF. Lieberman said
he has not seen the figures for the
National Institute of Health (NIH),
which provides Stanford with 40 per
cent of its research money, but ex
