# Hargadon criticizes need
## 
### DOUGLAS JEHL Senior staff writer 
In what was otherwise a rosy
portrayal of "the state of ad
missions" here, Dean of Ad
missions Fred Hargadon had
critical words yesterday tor fi
nancial aid need-calculations
and new NCAA legislation re
garding athletic eligibility.
During remarks before
members of the Academic
Council — the faculty — Har
gadon praised the Financial
Aids Office here for ottering
"the most comprehensive and
sensitively administered finan
cial aids policy in the country."
But he said, "The basis for
calculating need (using the
College Scholarship Service)
seems to me to too often re
ward spendthriftiness and
penalize frugality."
He lamented the fact that
even with computer resources,
a system that could develop a
comprehensive record of a
family's income history has not
been developed anywhere.

"The (present) system takes a
one-year snapshot of a family's
financial situation. If that fam
ily has conscientiously saved
for their children's college
education, so be it. If. on the
other hand, thev have chosen
to spend it on other luxuries
rather than save it, they may
well, under the present sys
tem, be eligible for financial
aid.
"On occasion, the contrasts
between families eligible for
financial aid and those not elig
ible. . .can be quite startling,"
Hargadon said.
Regarding the recently
enacted NCAA legislation,
which sets minimum high
school grade point average and
SAT score requirements for
college athletic eligibility, Har
gadon said, "Lord knows, they
needed to do something in this
area." The 2.0 CPA require
ment, he said, was a "minimal
step in the right direction."
But he called the 700 total
SAT requirement "the wrong

step taken tor the right rea
son." The concern, Hargadon
said should be that no college
enrolls a student to play athle
tics unless his academic cre
dentials were within the range
of that college s student bodv
as a whole and could help him
pursue that college's academic
program.
"Surely that will mean some
colleges can enroll students
with lower academic creden
tioal than can other colleges.
That is now the case for all stu
dents, regardless of whether
they participate in athletics,"
Hargadon said.
Hargadon insisted that his
speech was neither lofty nor
comprehensive enough to be a
"State of Admissions' address,
but in content it was just that.
The talk, though interspersed
with the sort of witticisms Har
gadon is well-known for, was
in essence a sober discussion
of the admissions process
here.
Among topics discussed were:
The changing nature of admissions
here. Fifty-two percent of applicants
were accepted in 1953, Hargadon
said; only 17 percent will be admitted
this year.
A comparison with Harvard Uni
versity. Hargadon used charts to
argue that Stanford's student body
was just as geographically diverse at
Harvard's.
Transfer admissions. The percent
age of transfer students admitted has
dropped from 23 to eight percent in
the past 10 years while the number of
applicants has declined just slightly.
