## 
### USA LYNCH Staff writer 
College students should
realize they are living in an iso
lated, unreal society, accord
ing to singer and political ac
ti\ ist loan Baez. Baez discussed
human rights and the power of
the individual with Brannerites
yesterday afternoon and de
si ribed her own short, disastr
ous college experience.
"I spent about a week at Bos
ton University," Baez said,
and then I went around to cot
tee houses and tried to learn
how to sing." She said she felt
living .n a college atmosphere
led students to develop an un
real picture of society. "I'm
glad I didn't bother finishing
school," she explained. "I was
brainwashed enough by six
teen " She added later that as
far as attitudes towards human
rights were concerned, "col
lege does more harm than
good in that respect. I think it
trnds to coarsen your sensitiv
itv to issues." She commented,
I think a lot of people do what
they do because they're afraid
to do anything else. T hat's why
people go to college."
Instead of a formal talk, Baez
•-aid she would prefer that stu

dents ask her questions, be
cause she was "too old" to
know exactly what they were
thinking and what they wanted
to discuss. When questioned,
she related her history of polit
ical involvement.
"My parents became Quak
ers when I was about five years
old," she said. "I went to
Quaker meetings and hated
every one of them until I met
Ira Sandperl, who saved me."
She said that she and Sandperl
used to leave the meetings and
talk, and it was about this time
she developed many of her
political ideals.
"I became involved with
Amensty International about
12 years ago," she said,
and added that in 1979 she
founded her own political or
ganization called Humanitas,
which is based in Menlo Park
and has an office in London.
"We began by writing an open
letter to Hanoi," she said, ad
ding that the letter was written
to express the organization's
disapproval of post-Vietnam
politics. "You could probably
call us a human rights educa
tional organization," Baez
said.
The organization is funded

by donations and occasional
Baez concerts, although Baez
said she tried to deemphasize
her role as a musician support
ing a political organization.
"As it stands, my music
career is nonexistent in the
U.S. anyhow," Baez said. "At
least it still exists in Europe . . .
You see, I refused to do the
sort of things one has to do to
be a 'hit' in the United States.
Musically, I'd say that I'm
about to find my niche, and I
don't know where it is yet."
Baez mentioned that discus
sions such as the Branner talk
were important in the educa
tion of politically unaware stu
dents. Education, according to
Baez, is a process where people
openly discuss ideas of real
concern to them, and focus on
contemporary issues rather
than on the archetypal forms of
instruction.
Baez said that as far as her
politics were concerned, she
was interested in promoting a
non-violent solution to politi
cal problems. She said that
only through the non-violent
efforts of a great number of in
dividuals could society be al
tered in any way. "Most people
function from a position that

they're not anybody, that
they're only one person and
they couldn't possibly ac
complish anything meaning
ful," she said. "The genius ot
Ghandi is that he made people
feel their own power."
Baez described what she
meant by non-violence, saying
"Non-violence is not just
something you use until it be
comes not quite efficient
enough." She said that she did
not know if peace could ever
be achieved this way, but ad
ded, "I hate the word peace.
The army drops bombs tor
peace. Peace is something
we're going to have some day
and everybody's killing every
body to get there."
Defending her position as a
pacifist, Baez described a talk
with a U.S. government official
who designed human rights
policy. "We were discussing
human rights, and at the end of
the discussion he said to me,
'Now, I think I've found the
one point on which we differ.
You think the biggest evil in the
world today is violence, and I
think,' Baez continued with a
cynical smile, 'I think that the
biggest evil in the world today
is the Soviet threat."

Baez described what she
meant by non-violence, saying
"Non-violence is not just
something you use until it be
comes not quite efficient
enough." She said that she did
not know if peace could ever
be achieved this way, but ad

The army drops bombs tor
peace. Peace is something
we're going to have some day
and everybody's killing every
body to get there."
Defending her position as a
pacifist, Baez described a talk
with a U.S. government official
who designed human rights
policy. "We were discussing
human rights, and at the end of
the discussion he said to me,
'Now, I think I've found the
one point on which we differ.
You think the biggest evil in the
world today is violence, and I
think,' Baez continued with a
cynical smile, 'I think that the
biggest evil in the world today
is the Soviet threat."
College students should
realize they are living in an iso
lated, unreal society, accord
ing to singer and political ac
ti\ ist loan Baez. Baez discussed
human rights and the power of
the individual with Brannerites
yesterday afternoon and de
si ribed her own short, disastr
ous college experience.
"I spent about a week at Bos
ton University," Baez said,
and then I went around to cot
tee houses and tried to learn
how to sing." She said she felt
living .n a college atmosphere
led students to develop an un
real picture of society. "I'm
glad I didn't bother finishing
school," she explained. "I was
brainwashed enough by six
teen " She added later that as
far as attitudes towards human
rights were concerned, "col
lege does more harm than
good in that respect. I think it
trnds to coarsen your sensitiv
itv to issues." She commented,
I think a lot of people do what
they do because they're afraid
to do anything else. T hat's why
people go to college."
Instead of a formal talk, Baez
•-aid she would prefer that stu

dents ask her questions, be
cause she was "too old" to
know exactly what they were
thinking and what they wanted
to discuss. When questioned,
she related her history of polit
ical involvement.
"My parents became Quak
ers when I was about five years
old," she said. "I went to
Quaker meetings and hated
every one of them until I met
Ira Sandperl, who saved me."
She said that she and Sandperl
used to leave the meetings and
talk, and it was about this time
she developed many of her
political ideals.
"I became involved with
Amensty International about
12 years ago," she said,
and added that in 1979 she
founded her own political or
ganization called Humanitas,
which is based in Menlo Park
and has an office in London.
"We began by writing an open
letter to Hanoi," she said, ad
ding that the letter was written
to express the organization's
disapproval of post-Vietnam
politics. "You could probably
call us a human rights educa
tional organization," Baez
said.
The organization is funded

by donations and occasional
Baez concerts, although Baez
said she tried to deemphasize
her role as a musician support
ing a political organization.
"As it stands, my music
career is nonexistent in the
U.S. anyhow," Baez said. "At
least it still exists in Europe . . .
You see, I refused to do the
sort of things one has to do to
be a 'hit' in the United States.
Musically, I'd say that I'm
about to find my niche, and I
don't know where it is yet."
Baez mentioned that discus
sions such as the Branner talk
were important in the educa
tion of politically unaware stu
dents. Education, according to
Baez, is a process where people
openly discuss ideas of real
concern to them, and focus on
contemporary issues rather
than on the archetypal forms of
instruction.
Baez said that as far as her
politics were concerned, she
was interested in promoting a
non-violent solution to politi
cal problems. She said that
only through the non-violent
efforts of a great number of in
dividuals could society be al
tered in any way. "Most people
function from a position that

they're not anybody, that
they're only one person and
they couldn't possibly ac
complish anything meaning
