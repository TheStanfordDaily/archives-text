# Faculty kids strive for anonymity, independence

It's hell growing up in the
ghetto.
But some 200 students who
grew up in the area of campus
known as the "faculty ghetto"
liked it so much they decided
to stay on and go to school
here.
They are the children of
Stanford professors and staff,
more often known as the "fac
ulty brats."
Sophomore Phil Wessells,
son of Dean of Humanities and
Sciences Norm Wessells, said,
"It was fun growing up here. I
wouldn't have wanted to live
anywhere else."
Faculty children live in
dorms throughout campus,
though most prefer to remain
anonymous. Having a father or
mother with a big name on
campus does not always bring
positive reactions from fellow
students.
Junior David "Burge"
Burgess, son of former Univer
sity Cash Management Man
ager lohn Burgess, said,
When you're in high school,
(he fact that your father works
it Stanford gets you respect,

but once you re at Stanford,
people mostly wonder about
how you got in."
In fact, faculty and staff chil
dren receive the same amount
of preferential treatment in
admissions as alumni children,
according to Dean of Admis
sions Fred Hargadon. "We
treat it like alumni preference,
meaning if a candidate is as
qualified as the two or three
you have to turn down for him
to come here, than he or she
will be accepted," he said.
There is no reason to believe
that faculty children as a group
perform any better or worse
here than any other students,
Hargadon said. "Most of them
would have gotten in anyway,"
he said.
"I don't know of a university
in the nation that doesn't have
a policy giving faculty and staff
preference in admissions,"
Hargadon said. When asked
why such policies exist, he re
plied, "It comes down to an
issue of loyalty."
Hargadon's two sons, Steve
and Andrew, are currently en
rolled at Stanford. "I think it's
gredf that they're here. First of
all, it's a great university, and

secondly, I bet a lot of parents
wouldn't mind being around
their kids when they're be
tween the ages of 18 and 22,"
he said.
Sophomore Andrew Harga
don, a transfer from Swar
thmore, said, "I still have a
good relationship with Dad. I
don't think it has changed
much since I enrolled here."
Still, neither Andrew nor
Steve, also a transfer from the
East Coast, use their last name
when introducing themselves.
Andrew said he has toned
down his behavior some since
enrolling here. "I realized that
I wasn't the only person on the
campus with the name Harga
don," he said.
Junior Mike Lieberman, son
of Gerald Lieberman, vice pro
vost and dean of graduate re
search and studies, also said he
does not volunteer that he is a
dean's son who grew up at
Stanford. "But I don't tell
people I'm from Minnesota
either," he said.
Most faculty and staff chil
dren attend Stanford at half tui
tion, according to Benefits
Representative Chris Rogers.
Some, whose parents were in

the University in 1969, receive a
full ride due to a special option
in effect at the time.
"In 1969 faculty and staff
members were given a choice
of plans. They could (hoose
the plan saying that if their
children would definitely at
tend Stanford they would re
ceive full tuition discounted.
This came with the understand
ing that if the student did not
get into Stanford, they would
forfeit the entire benefit," Ro
gers said.
The current plan, in effect
since 1970, allows faculty and
staff children to attend any
university in the United States
or abroad for one halt of the
University's current tuition.
This year the grant is worth a
maximum of $4100.
The University does not de
lineate between staff and fac
ulty with regards to the be
nefits, except that staff mem
bers must have five years of full
time service to be eligible, Ro
gers said.
Despite the possibility of a
greater tuition break, many
Stanford faculty children opt to
go away for college. Rogers
said there are 750 students on
the benefit program but esti
mated that only 200 attend
Stanford.
Some faculty children re
ported that they were weary of
the environment here. Burgess
said, "At times, I wish I would
have gone to school
elsewhere. You do get a little
bored of the same campus
after 21 years."
Phil Wessells said he tries to
get off campus as many
weekends as possible. "I'm de
finitely going overseas next
year too — I have to get out of
here," he said.
Even though most faculty
children have escaped the
"ghetto" for the relative secu
rity of the dorms, some said
they still feel their parents' pre
sence.
Mike Lieberman said he felt
embarrassed in front of his
parents during a dorm play
freshman year. "My part in
"Best Little Whorehouse in
Texas" had some fairly explic

ity lines like 'I'm coming, I'm
coming — thank you, Jesus'
that I was supposed to say with
a girl wrapped around me. lust
before I went on stage I
noticed that my mom, dad and
all the neighbors were in the
audience. Now that's the kind
of thing I wouldn't mind doing
at all in a normal college envi
ronment, but with everybody
around. . . ."
Dean Lieberman, however,
said that by having all four of
his children attend school
here, he has learned to keep
the proper distance from his
kids' lives.
His daughter Joanne agreed:
"We've got him pretty well
trained by now," she said.
Dean Wessells said he rarely
sees his son except when he
needs the car or money. "I
don't find it awkward at all that
we're on the same campus.
The place is so big that we re
ally don't run into each other
that often."
Phil Wessells told of a time
when they did:
"I was riding a friend's
motorcycle behind Tresidder
one dav because I was late for

lab and wanted to grab some
food in a hurry. Dad had
threatened me before that if I
didn't quit riding that bike he
wasn't going to pay my tuition
anymore. Well, as I was com
ing up on the Faculty Club,
there he was about 100 yards
away riding his bike down the
hill.
"I stopped right there, got
off the bike, and bent over like
I was fixing something. I didn't
dare look up until he was long
gone," Phil Wessells said.
Faculty children do worry
about the unexpected campus
encounter, but many are also
concerned about the impres.-
sion they make on their own
professors.
Joanne Lieberman said that if
she is struggling in a class, she
never wants the professor to
know her last name.
Dean Lieberman said he

realizes this is a major concern
of most faculty children. But
most professors really do not
notice, he said.
He told of one incident
where the situation was re
versed:
"When I was a young junior
professor, I had (former pro
vost) Fred Terman's son in one
of my classes. At that time Fred
Terman was a pretty big name
on campus, and I was always
worried that his son would go
home and tell his father that I
was a rotten professor,"
Lieberman said.
Both faculty and faculty chil
dren said they feel awkward
occasionally. But Mike
Lieberman said he and his
freshman advisor found a solu
tion: "He told me that he
wouldn't tell my dad about me
if I didn't tell my dad about
him."

Lieberman's office. The dean, who has sent all four of his children to Stanford, said he has
learned to keep his distance. "We have him well trained," Joanne said.
