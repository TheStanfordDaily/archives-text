It is fairly certain that almost every person
who drives the freeway in California breaks the
law consistantly and intentionally by driving fas
ter than the speed limit. Now suppose that the
state legislature finally decides to do something
about it and purchases second-hand radar
equipment to catch speeders. Assume further
that the equipment is defective and can only
identify speeding cars which were manufac
tured from 1960 to 1963 and painted blue. As
sume further that the state legislature is so con
cerned with doing something" about the situa
tion that it instructs the highway patrol to go
ahead and ticket as many speeders as possible,
even though the only ones who are caught drive
blue cars that rolled off the assembly line some
time between 1960 and 1963. Question: Is this
justice?
A basic principle of justice in our society is
that all laws must be enforced uniformly. Selec
tive enforcement encourages contempt for the
law and can lead to social unrest. With this
common-sense principle in mind, it is hard to
believe that anyone would propose to tie the
receipt of federally tunded student aid to the
draft registration process.

Inexplicably, this is exactly what the Reagan
administration has done. Starting in May, male
students will have to show proof of registration
before receiving financial aid here and across
the nation. That time-worn expression "May
Day" could take on new meaning for many stu
dents who have yet to register.
Perhaps it makes little difference to the ad
ministration that only "blue cars" will be forced
into either registration or the courts as a result
of a process which will systematically discrimi
nate against low-income male college students.
As one student so aptly put it, "only a fraction of
a fraction" of all males aged 18 to 21 are being
forced to comply with registration statutes. It
doesn't take a J.D. to see that the law is not
being enforced uniformly.
In addition to important moral objections to
the enforcement procedure, other adverse ef
fects can be foreseen. Colleges will be forced
into a quasi-governmental role as they take on
the task of recording the registration standings
of students. Not only will administrative costs
increase, the Reagan plan will make adversaries
out of colleges and students.
