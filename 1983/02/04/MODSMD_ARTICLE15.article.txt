# No subsidy for ASSU salaries
## 
### 
The ASSU, in asking the University for salary
subsidies, is failing to consider the negative
long-term consequences of student govern
ment financial dependence.
If the ASSU is to achieve its long-term goal of
independence from the University, it should
not pursue stop-gap funding solutions.
The University can dissolve the ASSU but
cannot fire any individual member. Thus Coun
cil ot Presidents (COP) member Mark Epstein
claims that "it (the salaries) gives them no lever
age over us. This is a weak justification for the
request made merely in order to gain financial
stability.
It students want a student government, they
will support one. University subsidies of COP
and ASSU salaries are unnecessary.
COP members claim that the salary subsidy
request is justified because most of their func
tion involves interacting with the University.
Perhaps something is wrong with the priorities
ot the student government if its primary deal

ings are with the administration.
We also question the size of salaries given to
members of the student governement. The
ASSU is asking the University for $17,000 to pay
75 percent of the salaries of top officials next
year. COP members and the senate chair cur
rently receive about $3600 — or the equivalent
of half tuition — per year and the deputy chair
receives about $900.
The ASSU also points to past funding by the
University as a reason for the subsidy request.
The University funded ASSU with about $40,000
per year in the early '70s. However, past policy
does not justify reinstating this type of financial
dependence.
We believe it will be difficult for top ASSU
officials to represent the student body if the
University is funding them. We fear that ASSU
members might grow more responsive to the
"hand that feeds them" and less attentive to the
needs of the students.
