## Some teachers can find jobs 
### 
One's employability on the secon
dary teaching market depends on at
least.two factors not mentioned in
Leonard Magier's column, "Life is
tough for new teachers" (Daily. Feb.
! suh| ct area of preparation and
geographic mobility of the candi
date.
Mathematics, science and com
puter science teachers are in high
demand In fact, the Reagan adminis
tration recently asked Congress to
tunci . jiO million scholarship pro
gram to prepare people to teach
mathematics and science in high
schools Secretary of Education Ter
rel Bell recently noted a "growing
shortage" of math and science
teachers and said "the declining
ondition of science and mathemat
ic ■ education has become serious
enough to compromise the nation's
future ability to develop and advance
our traditional industrial base, and to
compete in international market
places "
Thus, not all beginning teachers
re finding it difficult to secure a po
tion. In fact, some are being re
< ruited and wooed by districts anxi
ous to find qualified math and sci
ence and computer science
teachers. The older teachers men
tioned in Magier's letter, will, of
course retire and make this shortage
even ni' >re keenly felt. Some are tak
ing advantage of early retirement
programs offered by various dis
tricts.
Teachers pre pared to teach in
>ther subject areas such as English
(as Magier was) may well have to
prepare themselves to relocate ge
ographic ally out of the Hay Area into
more rural California settings or into
bowing growth in school-aged
population, such as parts of Los
\ngeles county. Moving to another
ill is also possible. A California

Preliminary results show that over HO
pen ent >t the class are in teaching
id itions in public or private

schools. Others were offered posi
tions, but decided on further
graduate study or other life pursuits.
We would like to be able to report
100 percent placement of all those
who are trained and wish to teach.
Until that day comes, weonly wanted
to point out some of the complexities
involved with the total picture of the
secondary education teacher mar
ket.

Trade restrictions
I read with apprehension the
editorial ridiculing former Vice Pres
ident Walter Mondale and Sen. Alan
Cranston (D-Calif.) and praising
former Gov. Jerry Brown for their
stands on the issue of free trade.
{Daily, lan 26.) I visited Japan several
times in the past several years on
business trips, and as I walked on the
streets of Tokyo I always noticed a
very interesting price structure.
American products, such as
Hewlett-Packard calculators, Kodak
Instamatic cameras, automobiles,
liquors, American oranges, etc. were
selling at prices two to 10 times the
price sold in the United States,
whereas the price of lapanese prod
ucts, such as Sonys, Canons,
Toyotas, Nissans and Hondas were
20 to 100 percent higher in Tokyo
than in the Bav Area!
The LJnited States has a $20 billion
yearly trade imbalance with lapan.
Brown thinks that the problem can
be solved by increasing American
productivity and improving the qual
ity ot products alone. The price struc
ture mentioned above has very little
to do with technology and thus we
need more than technological im
provement to solve the problem.
Before World War 11, the United
States was a protectionist country.
Probably industry was not strong
enough to fit against foreign compe
tition. After World War II the eco
nomy of the United States became so
strong and dominant that it could af
ford to promote free trade. Since
most other countries could not af
ford to practice free trade, it very
soon became a one-sided free trade
with the United States letting foreign
countries sell their products freely in
the United States whereas the
foreign countries protected their

domestic market trom American
competition.
Now the situation has changed.
United States companies are no
longer dominant and the United
States is having more than $40 billion
annual trade deficit every year. The
U.S. auto industry is on the verge of
collapse. The steel, rubber, ma
chinery, glass, batteries, fabrics,
paint, etc. industries which depend
closely on the U.S. auto industry are
also on the verge of collapse. Mil
lions of people's livelihoods depend
on these industries.
Clearly the United States can no
longer afford the luxuries of unilat
eral free trade. On the other hand I
don't believe the United States
should force other countries to open
up their market for American prod
ucts by means of a tariff war. As you
pointed out, this may backfire and
put the world economy in chaos.
Also for most countries it is not in
their national interest to have free
trade. For example, if Japan let
America sell its farm products freely I
believe the majority of Japanese
farmers would go bankrupt im
mediately. No country can allow it
self to be totally dependent on
foreign countries for its food supply.
So what is the solution? I would
like to propose a very simple solution
which has the following advantages:
It is guaranteed to work.
No lobbyists from domestic in
dustries or foreign countries can use
corruptive methods to influence its
working.
No recriminating negotiations
with foreign countries are necessary.
No trade wars.
No huge bureaucracies are re
quired to handle the problem. It
takes only a couple of statisticians
and a cheap computer to handle the
whole thing.
It even helps reduce the federal
deficit.
My proposal is as follows: all
foreign goods are subject to a un
iform rate of duties. The rate is de
termined once a year by an indepen
dent agency appointed by Congress.
The rate is determined by the trade
balance ol the previous year. The
higher the deficit in trade balance,
the higher the custom rate. The rate
must bo adjusted so that the balance
of payment averaged over five years
stays within 1 percent of the total
volume of trade.
