## Test methods need correction 
### 
Very few people will argue when I
say that anxiety is counterproductive
while taking tests. The nervousness
many feel while studying for tests is
also unfortunate because students
can come to associate learning with
the negative pressures and uncer
tainties that current methods of test
ing produce.
No matter who you are, you have
probably taken a test that you have
felt prepared for and been very dis
appointed to find questions that 1)
don't represent the material you
have covered accurately, 2) are
phrased ambiguously so there is un
necessary confusion by the question
or 3) test ingenuity — creative appli
cation — rather than how well you
understand the problem solving
method being tested.
Teachers in the introductory hard
sciences are kidding themselves if
they think they should, or can, test
students' ingenuity on tests. Save
those exams for classes that were de
veloped to improve that faculty.
Problem sets are an excellent forum
for working on the ability to apply
what we know to new situations, but
a test is the wrong environment for
judging ingenuity.
The nervousness we fee) during a
test and the unproductive uncer
tainty we go through, in geometric
stages as the test approaches, re
ducesouractual ability to solve novel
problems on a test. In other words, a
time-limited, competitive midterm
or final should not be designed to
test an ability which that class is not
for.
The argument "that is what it is like
in the real world" is fallacious and
lazy: tests in introductory classes are
not good measurements of how our
personalities will react in the "real"
world. Also, it won't be news to you
that some professors don't have a
wonderful understanding of their
students' cognitive levels either, so
the teachers' intuition is often mis
guided when composing new prob
lems for their tests that we "should
be able to do if we've done our
homework." Science professors are
not psychologists.
We do not want to discourage po
tential doctors, engineers or even
social science students looking to
broaden their background in the ob

jective sciences by imposing doubts
about how material will be tested.
Those insecurities, which every stu
dent handles differently, are what
induce procrastination and frustra
tion for lack of a clear guideline. It is
true that some fields are overflowing
with candidates, but there are less
severe ways of "weeding" students
out, than by testing their ability to
deal with frustration and pressure.
Perhaps quantity of work would be a
variable deterrence, accomplishing
the same effect with a more tangible
and less depressing message.

This column is aimed at the follow
ing classes; engineering 3,11 and 32,
statistics 60 and 116, physics 20 and
50, calculus 20 and 40 and the
chemistry 30 and 130 series. Classes
where subjective knowledge, pure
theory or intuitive application (high
level sciences and social sciences)
are the focus will not be able to use
the following outline for im
provements.
An instructor will deliver his sub
ject and assign reading to aid stu
dents' mastery of the material in
whatever manner suits him best. The
way problem sets and tests work to
gether, however, can conform to a
guideline that will simplify and or
ganize the way students work while
alleviating the mystery that creates
their anxiety:
This problem set will contain, as
it does now, a variety of questions
that cover every area in a unit to be
tested. The difference is that this
problem set will have a much higher
degree of redundancy for each kind
of problem. The set will be more ex
tensive and repetitive because the
tests will have a predetermined
number of questions from each of
the various areas, and reproduce
them verbatim or with only the num

bers changed from the problem set
questions.
Problem sets can be organized in a
very clear outline. Each unit might
have A, B, C, . . . various fields of
problems and each field will have 1,
2, 3 . . . variations on that subject
field. Section A-1 might have five orit
might have fifty very similar prob
lems and the professor will be ob
liged to decide, before the test, that
x number of that kind of problem will
appear on the exam.

for the test. No surprises. With thi,s
method, more material can be
covered than is now, because thert>
is no wasted study time without tns
efficient and obvious study pfarf:
know everything on the problem
sets. If the teacher assigns fifteen
weak acid problems and says two of
them will beon the test, the students
knows what to do.
Concern for lack of creativity on
the students' part is misplaced be
cause, first they get the chance to
apply their creativity to the degree
that the problem sets demand, and
second, in introductory hard sci
ences the emphasis is on learning
fundamental principles, becoming
familiar with formulas, and not on
judging spontaneous application.
Concern for students who memorizp
the problems is also misplaced be
cause students who spend that timt 1
will know it, though not any better
than students who have just done the
problems.
As simple as the whole idea is, it
hasn't been adopted here, and it is
worth talking to your friends and
professors about the merits of this
method.
