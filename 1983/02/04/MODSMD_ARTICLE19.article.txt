The Daily opinion page
will begin a new feature
on alternating Wednes
days, printing two oppos
ing viewpoints on a single
issue.
Recently the federal
government has taken
steps to withhold federal
financial aid to students
who have not registered
for the draft. How do you
feel? What is your view?
Bring your submissions
by the Daily office this
Sunday at 5 p.m. We will
select two submissions:
one for the withholding
of federal financial aid on
the basis of non
registration and one
against this position.
Editorial comment on
other subjects is also
welcome, if you have a
view you would like to
express, bring your let
ter, column or cartoon by
the Daily after 2 p.m. Let
ters and columns should
be typed, double
spaced, on a 57-character
line.
