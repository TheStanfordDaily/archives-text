# Profs, say Reagan budget faces opposition
## 
### ALAN TRIPP Senior staff writer 
Facing bipartisan congressional opposition to increased de
fense spending, the Reagan administration will be forced to
compromise on its recent budget proposal, according to sev
eral political scientists and economists here.
Political Science Prof. Hubert Marshall said, "Congress is far
more critical of Reagan this year than last. He will ultimately
have to sign the budget bill that Congress is willing to pass." He
added, "He'll fight for the budget that represents his prefer
ence in terms of public policy but he'll have to settlefor the best
he can get."
Nearly every economist contacted by the Daily expressed
concern over the long-term effects of increasing budget defi
cits. Economics Prof. Ronald McKinnon said, "The deficit is far
too big. An increase in the current deficit simply portends
future deficits and makes, the likelihood of inflation much
greater."
Economics Prof. Robert Hall saw the deficit in a different light
although he too warned against a trend toward increasing defi
cits. "The budget deficit comes as no surprise during a reces
sion. What is needed is a responsible policy which will see uf;
through this period of deficit to something approaching a bal

anced budget."
On the other hand, Thomas Moore, senior fellow at the
Hoover Institution, said the administration has probably over
estimated twc* «rr**Yic»t in an tO "scare democrats into re
ducing spending,"
Planned increases in military spending were generally not
seen in a favorable light. "The most urgent need is to reduce
the deficit by cutting inflationary military spending," Marshall
said.
Among those contacted, only Economics Prof. Michael Bos
kin fully supported the defense spending increase, though he
cautioned against the speed of the build-up. "The military had
been neglected in terms of spending and domestic programs
often grew beyond their original target levels. I think we need a
defense build-up, but the proposals call for too large and too
rapid a change."
Prof, of Economics Bert Hickman said the economy would
benefit more from a lower rate of increase in defense spending
only if the funds were shifted into domestic programs. But he
added, "questions of equity and social trade-off must also
come into consideration."
Marshall, in particular, emphasized what he called the disas
trous social effects" of Reagan's fiscal policy. "With this year's

cuts added to last year's cuts, we are to the point of imposing
genuine hardship on the poor in America, For example, in
recent months many California families have lost their homes
and now live out of their cars. Meanwhile. Reagan is going
ahead with every weapons system that has been seriously pro
posed by any recent administration."
The economists contacted were split on the question of
whether to raise or lower taxes. Hall said, "Reagan is sticking to
his tax cut policy, something which is importannt during a
recession."
By contrast, Hickman said tax increases might be the best way
to bring the deficit under control. "Increasing taxes and cutting
expenditures would bring down interest rates and the deficit at
the cost of reduced output and unemployment. Nonetheless,
the volume of tax receipts would increase and at the same time
you would have downward pressure on prices, reducing inter
est on the national debt."
McKinnon emphasized the growing effect of Social Security
payments on the budget."The highly publicized social security
compromise was a cop-out. The deficit problem is a very pre
sent strain on the economy. The Social Security problem will be
a heavy future strain. Total Social Security expenditures are

already almost half of the budget —
more than twice as big as defense."
Long-term reconstruction of the sys
tem was needed to make it self
supporting, he said.
Despite disagreement over most
aspects of the administration's pro
posals, nearly every economist con
tacted by the Daily expected eco
nomic recovery to be underway by
the time the budget goes into effect.
Hickman said, "A three percent in
crease in real GNP is possible but
there is a large degree of uncer

tainty; it could be an even stronger
recovery than currently predicted by
the administration."
Marshall, by contrast, said he ex
pects a "slow, mild recovery im
peded by federal borrowing at a level
preempting half of the nation's an
nual savings."
Moore predicted that the eco
nomy will be "picking up strongly
while interest rates remain stable."
Both Boskin and Hickman said
they were concerned that monetary
policy did not hold a central position
in the current debate over the eco
nomic situation.
"We need an easier money policy
during the coming recovery period,"
Hickman said.

Political Science Prof. Hubert Marshall said, "Congress is far
more critical of Reagan this year than last. He will ultimately
have to sign the budget bill that Congress is willing to pass." He
added, "He'll fight for the budget that represents his prefer
ence in terms of public policy but he'll have to settlefor the best
he can get."
Nearly every economist contacted by the Daily expressed
concern over the long-term effects of increasing budget defi
cits. Economics Prof. Ronald McKinnon said, "The deficit is far
too big. An increase in the current deficit simply portends
future deficits and makes, the likelihood of inflation much
greater."
Economics Prof. Robert Hall saw the deficit in a different light
although he too warned against a trend toward increasing defi
cits. "The budget deficit comes as no surprise during a reces
sion. What is needed is a responsible policy which will see uf;
through this period of deficit to something approaching a bal

anced budget."
On the other hand, Thomas Moore, senior fellow at the
Hoover Institution, said the administration has probably over
estimated twc* «rr**Yic»t in an tO "scare democrats into re
ducing spending,"
Planned increases in military spending were generally not
seen in a favorable light. "The most urgent need is to reduce
the deficit by cutting inflationary military spending," Marshall
said.
Among those contacted, only Economics Prof. Michael Bos
kin fully supported the defense spending increase, though he
cautioned against the speed of the build-up. "The military had
been neglected in terms of spending and domestic programs
often grew beyond their original target levels. I think we need a
defense build-up, but the proposals call for too large and too
rapid a change."
Prof, of Economics Bert Hickman said the economy would
benefit more from a lower rate of increase in defense spending
only if the funds were shifted into domestic programs. But he
added, "questions of equity and social trade-off must also
come into consideration."
Marshall, in particular, emphasized what he called the disas
trous social effects" of Reagan's fiscal policy. "With this year's

cuts added to last year's cuts, we are to the point of imposing
genuine hardship on the poor in America, For example, in
recent months many California families have lost their homes
and now live out of their cars. Meanwhile. Reagan is going
ahead with every weapons system that has been seriously pro
posed by any recent administration."
The economists contacted were split on the question of
whether to raise or lower taxes. Hall said, "Reagan is sticking to
his tax cut policy, something which is importannt during a
recession."
By contrast, Hickman said tax increases might be the best way
to bring the deficit under control. "Increasing taxes and cutting
expenditures would bring down interest rates and the deficit at
the cost of reduced output and unemployment. Nonetheless,
the volume of tax receipts would increase and at the same time
you would have downward pressure on prices, reducing inter
est on the national debt."
McKinnon emphasized the growing effect of Social Security
payments on the budget."The highly publicized social security
compromise was a cop-out. The deficit problem is a very pre
sent strain on the economy. The Social Security problem will be
a heavy future strain. Total Social Security expenditures are

already almost half of the budget —
more than twice as big as defense."
Long-term reconstruction of the sys
tem was needed to make it self
supporting, he said.
Despite disagreement over most
aspects of the administration's pro
posals, nearly every economist con
tacted by the Daily expected eco
nomic recovery to be underway by
the time the budget goes into effect.
Hickman said, "A three percent in
crease in real GNP is possible but
there is a large degree of uncer

tainty; it could be an even stronger
recovery than currently predicted by
the administration."
Marshall, by contrast, said he ex
pects a "slow, mild recovery im
peded by federal borrowing at a level
preempting half of the nation's an
nual savings."
Moore predicted that the eco
nomy will be "picking up strongly
while interest rates remain stable."
Both Boskin and Hickman said
they were concerned that monetary
policy did not hold a central position
in the current debate over the eco
nomic situation.
"We need an easier money policy
during the coming recovery period,"
Hickman said.
