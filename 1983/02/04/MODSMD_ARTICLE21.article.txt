# BUG ME
## 
### 
Back by popular demand
(or so I'm told) is "Bug Me,"
your chance to find out ev
erything you ever wanted to
know about Stanford, or the
Bay Area or life in general.
(My qualifications get better
as the topic gets broader.)
I'll buzz through here every
week or so to answer your
questions about anything
that's been bugging you,
either because you didn't
know how to find the an
swer yourself or didn't want
to take the trouble. So
please, ask me questions —
I may get tired of making
half of them up. Why isn't
the fountain in front of
Green Library ever on? And
when it is, why in the middle
of the night?
— Sandra from Twain
A better question, Sandra,
might be how often do you
walk out of Green in the
middle of the night? Any
way, I picked this one for
starters because it's easy.
According to Donald Piana,
grounds supervisor for Uni
versity Operations and
Maintenance, the Shumway
Fountain (a free answer
there) is currently off be
cause of an equipment
malfunction in the "pump
rooms." Several other foun
tains on campus are dry for
the same reason.
Piana went on to say that
campus fountains are gen
erally turned on by timers,
and run for eight to 10 hours

during the morning and af
ternoon. He speculated that
temporary power outages
such as we've had recently
could throw off the foun
tains' timers, causing them
to come on at the wrong
time.
Yesterday's Daily carried a
story detailing the proposed
renovation of the Quad
courtyard, which will have a
nostalgiacelement: accord
ing to Planning Director
Philip Williams, an effort
will be made to carry out de
signer Frederick Law
Olmsted's original plan for
the Quad. This news leads
me to bring up one of my
pet peeves:
What about the
"arboretum"? Didn't
Olmsted and Senator
Leland Stanford want the
University to have a real
arboretum, and wasn't one
planted on the land be
tween the Quad and El
Camino, where the great
Eucalyptus Wasteland now
stands? Will this aspect of
Olmsted's plan ever be car
ried out?
A little reading in Assoc.
Art Prof. Paul Turner's book
The Founders and the
Architects, and calls to the
University Archives and the
Planning Office, turned up
the following.
From the beginning,
Leland Stanford Sr. said he
wanted his university to
have an arboretum.
Olmsted (best known as the
designer of New York's
Central Park) was more than
happy togive itone, particu
larly as his control over the
layout of the rest of the cam
pus shrank. Olmsted ori
ginally wanted the campus
to nestle in the foothills,
with detached buildings
scattered among the trees in
an English garden manner.
Stanford, who had more
magnificent things in mind,
wanted the campus built on
the flatlands, where it could
be symmetrical and impos
ing. Stanford won, of
course, and as a com
promise of sorts Olmsted
decided to plant a vast
arboretum/forest in the
hills above the campus.
It's not clear exactly what
happened at this point. At
the time Olmsted's design
for a foothill arboretum was

complete, Stanford still said
(publicly) that he wanted
one. But apparently his in
terest flagged (it was hard
enough getting the build
ings built), and the project
was delayed. When the
arboretum was finally
planted, it didn't go where
Olmsted wanted, either. It
was put in between the
campus gates and the quad,
in the area now roughly
bounded by El Camino Real,
Galvez and Serra Streets and
Quarry Road.
Even so, it must have been
impressive. According to
Kevin Starr in Americans
and the California Dream,
Stanford and Olmsted
planted 12,000 trees in the
arboretum: "Chinese
palms, Japanese cedars, East
and West Indian flowering
plants, orange trees, in
digenous oak and
redwood." It wasn't long af
ter this that Olmsted
stopped doing any real
work at Stanford, although
he continued on the payroll
as a consultant.
So what happened to all
this arboreal splendor?
Here Williams picks up the
story. Apparently it was
feared that many of the
young trees that were
planted wouldn't survive
the hot, dry California sum
mers, so eucalyptus trees
were planted to give the
saplings shade. The assump
tion was that the eucalyptus
would be removed in a few
years when their job was
done. Instead, as has hap
pened all over California,
the eucalyptus thrived and
"jammed out the other
plants."
There is some hope for a
revived arboretum, though.
According to Williams, the
eucalyptus are now mature
and "we'll have to think a lot
more seriously about how
to replace the eucalyptus,
and whether to put in a real
arboretum." He said the
idea has been discussed
before, but funds have nev
er been raised and "it's nev
er gotten far towards being
a project."
Well, another week, an
other $3.33 for your bug. If
you have a question you'd

the time Olmsted's design
for a foothill arboretum was

complete, Stanford still said
(publicly) that he wanted
one. But apparently his in
terest flagged (it was hard
enough getting the build
ings built), and the project
was delayed. When the
arboretum was finally
planted, it didn't go where
Olmsted wanted, either. It
was put in between the
campus gates and the quad,
in the area now roughly
bounded by El Camino Real,
Galvez and Serra Streets and
Quarry Road.
Even so, it must have been
impressive. According to
Kevin Starr in Americans
and the California Dream,
Stanford and Olmsted
planted 12,000 trees in the
arboretum: "Chinese
palms, Japanese cedars, East
and West Indian flowering
plants, orange trees, in
digenous oak and
redwood." It wasn't long af
ter this that Olmsted
stopped doing any real
work at Stanford, although
he continued on the payroll
as a consultant.
So what happened to all
this arboreal splendor?
Here Williams picks up the
story. Apparently it was
feared that many of the
young trees that were
planted wouldn't survive
the hot, dry California sum
mers, so eucalyptus trees
were planted to give the
saplings shade. The assump
tion was that the eucalyptus
would be removed in a few
years when their job was
done. Instead, as has hap
pened all over California,
the eucalyptus thrived and
"jammed out the other
plants."
There is some hope for a
revived arboretum, though.
According to Williams, the
eucalyptus are now mature
and "we'll have to think a lot
more seriously about how
to replace the eucalyptus,
and whether to put in a real
arboretum." He said the
idea has been discussed
before, but funds have nev
er been raised and "it's nev
er gotten far towards being
a project."
Well, another week, an
other $3.33 for your bug. If
you have a question you'd
like answered, drop it by the
Daily or mail it to Bug Me,
The Stanford Daily, Stan
ford, CA 94305.

Back by popular demand
(or so I'm told) is "Bug Me,"
your chance to find out ev
erything you ever wanted to
know about Stanford, or the
Bay Area or life in general.
(My qualifications get better
as the topic gets broader.)
I'll buzz through here every
week or so to answer your
questions about anything
that's been bugging you,
either because you didn't
know how to find the an
swer yourself or didn't want
to take the trouble. So
please, ask me questions —
I may get tired of making
half of them up. Why isn't
the fountain in front of
Green Library ever on? And
when it is, why in the middle
of the night?

A better question, Sandra,
might be how often do you
walk out of Green in the
middle of the night? Any
way, I picked this one for
starters because it's easy.
According to Donald Piana,
grounds supervisor for Uni
versity Operations and
Maintenance, the Shumway
Fountain (a free answer
there) is currently off be
cause of an equipment
malfunction in the "pump
rooms." Several other foun
tains on campus are dry for
the same reason.
Piana went on to say that
campus fountains are gen
erally turned on by timers,
and run for eight to 10 hours

during the morning and af
ternoon. He speculated that
temporary power outages
such as we've had recently
could throw off the foun
tains' timers, causing them
to come on at the wrong
time.
Yesterday's Daily carried a
story detailing the proposed
renovation of the Quad
courtyard, which will have a
nostalgiacelement: accord
ing to Planning Director
Philip Williams, an effort
will be made to carry out de
signer Frederick Law
Olmsted's original plan for
the Quad. This news leads
me to bring up one of my
pet peeves:
What about the
"arboretum"? Didn't
Olmsted and Senator
Leland Stanford want the
University to have a real
arboretum, and wasn't one
planted on the land be
tween the Quad and El
Camino, where the great
Eucalyptus Wasteland now
stands? Will this aspect of
Olmsted's plan ever be car
ried out?
A little reading in Assoc.
Art Prof. Paul Turner's book
The Founders and the
Architects, and calls to the
University Archives and the
Planning Office, turned up
the following.
From the beginning,
Leland Stanford Sr. said he
wanted his university to
have an arboretum.
Olmsted (best known as the
designer of New York's
Central Park) was more than
happy togive itone, particu
larly as his control over the
layout of the rest of the cam
pus shrank. Olmsted ori
ginally wanted the campus
to nestle in the foothills,
with detached buildings
scattered among the trees in
an English garden manner.
Stanford, who had more
magnificent things in mind,
wanted the campus built on
the flatlands, where it could
be symmetrical and impos
ing. Stanford won, of
course, and as a com
promise of sorts Olmsted
decided to plant a vast
arboretum/forest in the
hills above the campus.
It's not clear exactly what
happened at this point. At
the time Olmsted's design
for a foothill arboretum was

complete, Stanford still said
(publicly) that he wanted
