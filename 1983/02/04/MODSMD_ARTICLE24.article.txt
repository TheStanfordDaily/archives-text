# Flooding causes delays
## Health Policy Building opened 
### DANA RATCLIFF 
Despite delays caused by last
week's flooding, dispersed
members of the Consortium
on Health Research are cur
rently moving into a renovated
building designed to centralize
the activities of the two year
old program. The move should
be completed by next Friday.
Called the Health Research
Policy Building, the new facility
will support the Consortium —
medical school faculty and
members who, with colleagues
from other Stanford depart
ments focus on the study of na
tional health policy and service
— as well as other medical pro
fessors and staff. The new
building will serve as an effec
tive interdisciplinary research
center bringing together the
now dispersed members of the
group.
"The new facilities are
necessary to bring together the
Medical School and the de
partmental faculty into a single
group area," said Prof. John
Bunker, director of the division
of health services research in
department of family, commu
nity and preventive medicine.
"This central core will facilitate
research and learning in the
Consortium." The interdiscip
linary program encompasses
the fields of medicine, eco
nomics, sociology, psychol
ogy, communications, as well
as other social sciences.
Some of the research in
cludes cost effectiveness, pre
ventive medicine and experi
mental studies such as a public
education program designed

to teach people how to live
healthier lifestyles, according
to Bunker.
The board of trustees ap
proved the $1.5 to 2 million
remodeling project in October
of '81, moving many of the
Consortium's kev members

into a single office complex.
The entire department of fam
ily, community and preventa
tive medicine is included in the
move.
The renovated building was
originally part of the Stanford

Museum. After the 1906
earthquake, the facility was
approved tor use by the basic
medical sciences. According to
Bunker, the building was one
of the first in the United States
to be built with reinforced
steel.

COMMUNITY HEALTH: Faculty from all over campus are in the process of moving into this
new Health Research Policy Building across from the Med Center. The building will soon
house the Consortium for Health Research, an interdisciplinary program aimed at solving
community health problems.
