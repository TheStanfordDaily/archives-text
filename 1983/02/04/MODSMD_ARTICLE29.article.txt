# at more and weigh less: Exercising is the key
## 
### ALEX TARG 
Dieting has become the foundation of a huge
American diet industry.
The average T r >-(>4 year-old American woman
lonsumes only 1360 calories each day, a level
which would be cause for concern if found in an
underdeveloped country, according to Prof.
Peter Wood, deputy director of the University
Heart Disease Prevention Program and veteran
of over 70 marathons.
Hut Wood said, "Despite the plethora of diets
thrust upon us from the pages of magazines and
slickly marketed books, dieting alone is not the
most effective way to lose weight; it treats the
symptoms but may leave the underlying cause
unremedied. In the long run, diets by them
selves work rather poorly to achieve permanent
weight loss."
Instead, Wood said diet and exercise are
synergistic, in that the combination of the two is
more effective that the sum of its parts. When
used together the pair is remarkably efficient at
reducing and then controlling weight.

' Most popular diets, without an
accompanying increase in
exercise, are futile as a means of
long-term weight control.
People who are overweight in
general do not over-eat, they
under-exercise."

The problem of being overweight afflicts
more than 30 percent of the adult population in
the United States, despite dieting fads. This
condition can increase risk from related prob
lems such as elevated cholesterol levels and
susceptibility to heart disease, hypertension
and diabetes, according to Wood. In add tion,
overweight people are to some extent hand
i< apped in their movements and many feel that
their bulk detracts from their appearance, he
said.
Wood describes the benefits of an exercise
oriented lifestyle in his book, Run To Health. In
the past, leading a sedentary lifestyle was con
sidered a sign of prosperity, Wood said. Now
although this status is gone, many people still do
not exercise.
"We are left with a population that eats less
and is fatter than that of 100 years ago," said
Wood.
"One factor contributing to the dieter's hesi
tancy to exercise is their feeling that they need
to do a tremendous amount of exercise to burn a
small amount of fat," Wood said. Refuting this
popular belief, Wood has concluded partially as
a result of studies at the Heart Disease Preven
tion Program that the net calorie expenditure of
an exercise severly underestimates its efficiency
in promoting weight loss.

A popular model of weight gain and loss is to
treat the body as an energy reservoir in which
the available energy level rises when food is
consumed arid its energy level falls as it uses
energy for bodily functions. When more energy
is put into the system than is used, the excess is
stored as fat. Conversely when output exceeds
input, the fat is used up and weight is lost. Tradi
tionally, exercise is considered to only use en
ergy while actually in progress, Wood said, l he
amount of energy used when the body is not
exercising is determined by a complex system
which precisely controls the body's tempera
ture and metabolic processes. This rate of en
ergy consumption is very stable and is kept close
to a rate called the setpoint. The setpoint is
much like a thermostat setting in a home's heat
ing system.
Wood said he believes that one can raise the
energy use setpoint by simply sending more
energy through the body each day: by eating
more and exercising, the body is maintained at a
significantly higher level of energy use, causing
the person to use extra energy and burn fat even
when resting. Studies show that eating less food
actually decreases the rate at which a person's
body uses energy, said Wood, "as it banks down
its fires to become more efficient."
In one study, Wood compared middle-aged
women who played singles tennis for 10 hours a
week with sedentary women and found that the
tennis players' food intake was close to 2400
calories a day, while the overweight women ate
only 1400, indicating that the exercisers must be
operating at an elevated metabolic rate.
In another experiment, 48 men who were
quite sedentary initially were assigned exercises
over the course of a year. The men who did the
most exercising lost the most weight but were
also the ones who increased the amount they
ate the most over the course of the study. The
men who significantly increased their caloric in
take were the same men who decreased their
body fat to the greatest extent. Wood said he
believes as a result of ihese and other studies
that most popular diets, without an accompany
ing increase in exercise, are poor choices as a
means of long-term weight control. People who
are overweight tri general do not over-eat; they
under-exercise.
"Although weight can be lost and kept off by
subsisting on a low-calorie diet and doing little
exercise," said Wood, "this type of diet is ex
ceedingly diffucult for people to stick to for a
lifetime. It almost invariably results in a rapid
climb back up to the original weight when the
regimen is relaxed."
Low-calorie diets do aid rapid weight loss, but
to raise the body's setpoint and automatically
maintain the new desired weight requires sup
plementary exercise. According to Wood, "after
the weight loss, the person can usually return to
eating as much as if not more than before and
weight control will be easy if not effortless."

used together the pair is remarkably efficient at
reducing and then controlling weight.

The problem of being overweight afflicts
more than 30 percent of the adult population in
the United States, despite dieting fads. This
condition can increase risk from related prob
lems such as elevated cholesterol levels and
susceptibility to heart disease, hypertension
and diabetes, according to Wood. In add tion,
overweight people are to some extent hand
i< apped in their movements and many feel that
their bulk detracts from their appearance, he
said.
Wood describes the benefits of an exercise
oriented lifestyle in his book, Run To Health. In
the past, leading a sedentary lifestyle was con
sidered a sign of prosperity, Wood said. Now
although this status is gone, many people still do
not exercise.
"We are left with a population that eats less
and is fatter than that of 100 years ago," said
Wood.
"One factor contributing to the dieter's hesi
tancy to exercise is their feeling that they need
to do a tremendous amount of exercise to burn a
small amount of fat," Wood said. Refuting this
popular belief, Wood has concluded partially as
a result of studies at the Heart Disease Preven
tion Program that the net calorie expenditure of
an exercise severly underestimates its efficiency
in promoting weight loss.

A popular model of weight gain and loss is to
treat the body as an energy reservoir in which
the available energy level rises when food is
consumed arid its energy level falls as it uses
energy for bodily functions. When more energy
is put into the system than is used, the excess is
stored as fat. Conversely when output exceeds
input, the fat is used up and weight is lost. Tradi
tionally, exercise is considered to only use en
ergy while actually in progress, Wood said, l he
amount of energy used when the body is not
exercising is determined by a complex system
which precisely controls the body's tempera
ture and metabolic processes. This rate of en
ergy consumption is very stable and is kept close
to a rate called the setpoint. The setpoint is
much like a thermostat setting in a home's heat
ing system.
Wood said he believes that one can raise the
energy use setpoint by simply sending more
energy through the body each day: by eating
more and exercising, the body is maintained at a
significantly higher level of energy use, causing
the person to use extra energy and burn fat even
when resting. Studies show that eating less food
actually decreases the rate at which a person's
body uses energy, said Wood, "as it banks down
its fires to become more efficient."
In one study, Wood compared middle-aged
women who played singles tennis for 10 hours a
week with sedentary women and found that the
tennis players' food intake was close to 2400
calories a day, while the overweight women ate
only 1400, indicating that the exercisers must be
operating at an elevated metabolic rate.
In another experiment, 48 men who were
quite sedentary initially were assigned exercises
over the course of a year. The men who did the
most exercising lost the most weight but were
also the ones who increased the amount they
ate the most over the course of the study. The
men who significantly increased their caloric in
take were the same men who decreased their
body fat to the greatest extent. Wood said he
believes as a result of ihese and other studies
that most popular diets, without an accompany
ing increase in exercise, are poor choices as a
means of long-term weight control. People who
are overweight tri general do not over-eat; they
under-exercise.
"Although weight can be lost and kept off by
subsisting on a low-calorie diet and doing little
exercise," said Wood, "this type of diet is ex
ceedingly diffucult for people to stick to for a
lifetime. It almost invariably results in a rapid
climb back up to the original weight when the
regimen is relaxed."
Low-calorie diets do aid rapid weight loss, but
to raise the body's setpoint and automatically
maintain the new desired weight requires sup
plementary exercise. According to Wood, "after
the weight loss, the person can usually return to
eating as much as if not more than before and
weight control will be easy if not effortless."
Dieting has become the foundation of a huge
American diet industry.
The average T r >-(>4 year-old American woman
lonsumes only 1360 calories each day, a level
which would be cause for concern if found in an
underdeveloped country, according to Prof.
Peter Wood, deputy director of the University
Heart Disease Prevention Program and veteran
of over 70 marathons.
Hut Wood said, "Despite the plethora of diets
thrust upon us from the pages of magazines and
slickly marketed books, dieting alone is not the
most effective way to lose weight; it treats the
symptoms but may leave the underlying cause
unremedied. In the long run, diets by them
selves work rather poorly to achieve permanent
weight loss."
Instead, Wood said diet and exercise are
synergistic, in that the combination of the two is
more effective that the sum of its parts. When
used together the pair is remarkably efficient at
reducing and then controlling weight.
