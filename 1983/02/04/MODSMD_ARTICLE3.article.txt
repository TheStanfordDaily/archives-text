# Kennedy: Stanford to forgo $20 million
## 
### DOUGLAS JEHL Senior staff writer 
President Donald Kennedy has
recommended that the board of trus
tees temporarily abandon the Uni
versity policy of full recovery of indi
rect research costs — an action that
would mean forgoing some $20 mil
lion in cost recovery in the next three
years.
If the University were to recover all
costs to which it was entitled, inves
tigators here might very well be
priced out of the market for research
funding and the federal government
might further restrict research fund
ing, Kennedy said yesterday in an af
ternoon address to the Academic
Council and in a background paper
circulated to members of the board.
If accepted by the board in its
meeting next week — as is likely —
the recommendation would mark a
significant change in policy for the
University, which has long been
committed to recovering fully all
costs associated with research.
It would also mean a sharp blow to
the University operating budget —
Kennedy called it "a significant
budgetary sacrifice for our academic
enterprise" — which will already be
subject to a $10 million belt
tightening program in the next three
years.
The action would be taken by set
ting the indirect cost rate at an artifi

cally low level. The rate, which cur
rently stands at 69 percent, is being
pushed inexorably forward by a
number of forces, Kennedy said. To
recover all justifiable costs, the Uni
versity would need to move the rate
to 82 percent for the coming fiscal
year, he said.
This justifiably high rate would
cause faculty members "to suffer a
competitive penalty in the allocation
of (research) awards," Kennedy told
the council.
In addition, "the executive branch
agencies and the Congress are both
distressed by the rate of increase" in
indirect cost rates. "Further in
creases in rates are likely to fuel the
claim . . . that indirect costs have
risen to unacceptable levels and
must be contained," Kennedy said.
The indirect cost recovery rate, a
percentage of direct costs, is used to
charge sponsors of research for costs
and benefits that cannot be firmly as
sociated with a particular project.
To determine the indirect cost
rate, the University adds up all indi
rect costs and, through complicated
cost-accounting, determines the
percentage figure that it is eligible to
recover.
Even the current 69 percent figure
— up from 58 percent a year ago — is
too low to recover all costs. "The rate
that actually results from the cost
