# Telescope to view space phenomena

A new telescope being constructed here
has won Stanford reservations for 1987
aboard science's hottest new flight, the
Space Shuttle. The gamma ray telescope is
being built by cooperating groups of sci
entists at Stanford, NASA, Grumman
Aerospace Corporation and the Max Plank
Institute in Germany. It will be one of five
instruments contained in the world's first
gamma ray satellite. And the satellite with
its five instruments will be launched into
space by a Space Shuttle.
The telescope should allow scientists to
discover and record phenomena in space
which are now only hypothesized. "We're
examining the physics of quazars, pulsars
and black holes," said Physics Prof. Robert
Hofstadter, a Nobel laureate here.
Hofstadter is the principle investor for the
gamma ray telescope project.
"We hope to uncover processes that
have never been seen before. They occur
now in our laboratories, but we don't
know if they actually exist. We would like
to observe them in nature," said Hofstad
ter.
Gamma rays are the most energetic in
the electromagnetic spectrum. In space,
gamma rays come directly from their ori
gin as a straight line. Thus, finding the
source star of the rays is not difficult if the
rays can be recorded and traced back
along their path.
The telescope will listen for and record
these gamma rays as "scintillations"
within sodium iodide crystals. These very
heavy synthesized crystals, first invented
by Hofstadter in 1948, are extremely dense
blocks of sodium iodide which have been
contaminated with thallium. "When you
add thallium to them, the crystals become
what we call 'scintillation counters',"

Hofstadter said. "When some radiation
hits a crystal, it lights up. That's a scintilla
tion."
Robert Parks, project engineer and
senior research assistant here added, "It
was the same type of sodium iodide crys
tals that found the Russian satellite when it
crashed down in Canada some years ago.

They picked up on the radiation, which
was traced back up to the source."
The gamma ray telescope will be
equipped with photomultiplier tubes to
record the scintillations, or gamma ray
penetrations. The record, scientists hope,
will give evidence of processes occuring in
distant galaxies.

"We are especially interested in nuclei
standing how a pulsar works," I lolsl.idt i
said. "These objects are neutrons 01 A
lapsed stars. They emit beams ot radiation
like a search light, in a straight line We
don't know exactly how these pulsar*
work. We hope the telest ope will show ie
processes within the atomic panicles ot
pulsars."
Parks added, "1 he telescope is l> i >11 ally
a platform in space to look toi radiation
There's no atmosphere up here to internp!
the gamma rays."
"The absence of radiation may turn out
to be significant as well," Paiks said
"People have theorized about blac I; holes.
These "would-be" collapsed stars ate so
dense they absorb even light I hey l< i
nothing escape. Our (rystals would dei« i
this too."
The telescope will house U> eight inc li
thick crystals, each weighing pound-
The crystals are rectangular in shape ind
will be shielded from c osmic ray:, by .1 ■ pc
cial plastic dome. This dome is undei 1 on
struction at the Max Plank Institute.
The entire telescope configuration will
rest in the Gsamma Kay Obseivalor)
along with four other high energy gamma
ray instruments. I he event is heralded b\
scientists as the birth of gamma ray as
tronomy, a new branch of science.
"Gamma ray astronomy promises to bt
come one of the most vigorous branches
of astronomy," said Hofstadler. light
from the atomic processes in the stars and
galaxies tells us what is going on in theii
outer atmosphere, X-rays tell us ahoul
what happens deeper within their sui lac es
and gamma rays will tell us what goes on at
even greater depths."
The satellite, once launched, is ex
pected to function two years.
