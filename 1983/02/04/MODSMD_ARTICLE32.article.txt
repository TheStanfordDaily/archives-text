# Music makers look to computers to synthesize new sounds
## 
### BILL BEYDA 
To most people, computer
music is the noise made by a
video game when you break
10,000 points. But in reality,
"it's a lot more than bleeps and
bloops," said John Chowning,
director of the Music Depart
ment's Center for Computer
Research in Music and Acous
tics (CCRMA) at Stanford.
The CCRMA staff is com
prised of members of the
music, electrical engineering
and computer science depart
ments, speech and hearing ex
perts from the Medical Center,
and others. The research is
being funded by the University
as well as several outside
sources including the National
Science Foundation, the Sys
tem Development Foundation
and the National Endowment
of the Arts.
"We've held concerts here
and had about 1000 people,
and they really enjoy the
music," he said. "It's rich, en
ticing and compelling — it ex
poses people to sounds
they've never before experi
enced."
"What most people think of

as computer music is really
electronic music," Chowning
said. "Most people have never
heard digitally synthesized
music."
Examples of electronically
synthesized music can be
found by simply turning on an

FM radio. The theme from
Chariots of Fire, by Vangelis,
and hit songs "Don't Vou Want
Me" by the Human League,
and "Tainted Love" by Soft Cell
are examples of "analog" syn
thesis, sound exists as variable
voltage and current levels in
side of a piece of equipment.

This is very different from
computer music, which uses
digital synthesis. The sound is
represented by numbers in
side the computer, which are
in turn represented by discrete
voltage levels.
As an example, a graph of a

simple sine wave is an analog
representation of the values of
the sine function. For every
possible angle, one simply
reads the correct value of the
sine function off of the graph.
A digital representation of the
sine function would be a chart.
We only have the value of the

function for the angles that our
chart has.
In the same way, sound pro
cessed by digital means is actu
ally broken down into num
bers inside the computer. The
sound of an oboe can there
fore be represented numeri
cally and can be refined or ad
justed inside the computer.
"Computers can make any
sound that can be produced by
a loudspeaker," Chowning
said. "The medium certainly
does not restrict the sound."
With the revoultion in com
puter technology, the pos
sibilities for computer music
are endless.
Computers can produce the
sound of any instrument, or
any combination of instru
ments, Chowningsaid. In addi
tion, any sound, such as a can
non or a dog barking, can be
produced by computers.
"There are several applica
tions for computers in music,"
Chowning said. "One is in syn
thesis and processing. The
computer generates music
based on the composer's spe
cific waveform."
"High level languages can be

used to help in I he proi t >oi
composition," Chowning said.
A "high level language ' would
allow the user to com eiilrali
more on the art of oe.uing
music than on the details (.1
computer generated sound.
"Another application i . as a
recording and piocessing de
vice," Chowning said. In this
case the computet digiiw o•• tIn
sound, processes it and stores
it. It can later be mixed or
changed and reprodiu t il
"Computers 1 an also be
used as the means of generat
ing a musical score," he said.
For example, one v ould play a
record to the computet and it
could print the sheet music
"The best of these programs
will produce enguvvi qualily
output."
Outdoor computer musi
concerts are already >>( heduled
at Stanford for the summer,
and there are tentative plans
for one early next fall quarter,

computer music, which uses
digital synthesis. The sound is
represented by numbers in
side the computer, which are
in turn represented by discrete
voltage levels.
As an example, a graph of a

simple sine wave is an analog
representation of the values of
the sine function. For every
possible angle, one simply
reads the correct value of the
sine function off of the graph.
A digital representation of the
sine function would be a chart.
We only have the value of the

function for the angles that our
chart has.
In the same way, sound pro
cessed by digital means is actu
ally broken down into num
bers inside the computer. The
sound of an oboe can there
fore be represented numeri
cally and can be refined or ad
justed inside the computer.
"Computers can make any
sound that can be produced by
a loudspeaker," Chowning
said. "The medium certainly
does not restrict the sound."
With the revoultion in com
puter technology, the pos
sibilities for computer music
are endless.
Computers can produce the
sound of any instrument, or
any combination of instru
ments, Chowningsaid. In addi
tion, any sound, such as a can
non or a dog barking, can be
produced by computers.
"There are several applica
tions for computers in music,"
Chowning said. "One is in syn
thesis and processing. The
computer generates music
based on the composer's spe
cific waveform."
"High level languages can be

used to help in I he proi t >oi
composition," Chowning said.
A "high level language ' would
allow the user to com eiilrali
more on the art of oe.uing
music than on the details (.1
computer generated sound.
"Another application i . as a
recording and piocessing de
vice," Chowning said. In this
case the computet digiiw o•• tIn
sound, processes it and stores
it. It can later be mixed or
changed and reprodiu t il
"Computers 1 an also be
used as the means of generat
ing a musical score," he said.
For example, one v ould play a
record to the computet and it
could print the sheet music
"The best of these programs
will produce enguvvi qualily
output."
Outdoor computer musi
concerts are already >>( heduled
at Stanford for the summer,
and there are tentative plans
for one early next fall quarter,
according to Chowning sin
