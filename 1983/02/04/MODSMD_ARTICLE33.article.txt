## Card baseball outlook Pitch, no hit in '83 
### SID SPAETH Senior sports writer 
Two consecutive playoff
teams and a single trip to the
College World Series are not
the kind of legend that made
Arizona State the nation's col
lege powerhouse or that re
minds us what pro team wears
pin stripes.
But Cardinal baseball coach
Mark Marquess said some
thing is catching on at the
Farm.
"We feel we have a quality
program now," Marquess said.
"Numbers (depth) has always
been a problem at Stanford,
yet we've had two outstanding
recruiting years in a row — and
we feel that our trend for im
provement will only continue.
We would like to return to the
World Series."
Stanford's main strength, at
least until outfielders Mike
Dotterer and Darryl Stephens
can recover from injuries, will
be on the pitcher's mound.
The Cardinal opens a three
game series at Cal State-
Fullerton today at 2 p.m.
Cardinal ace of last season,
Brian Mignano, was lost to
graduation, but the rest of the
rotation appears strong, lunior
Brian Myers (8-2, 4.01 last sea
son) heads the staff that also
returns sophomore left Ballard
(7-4, 4.24), sophomore David
Harris (7-0, 3.25) and junior
Steve Cottrell (2-1, 2.13) will
handle most of the relief work.
Offensively, the Cardinal
will rely on veterans Mike Al
drete, Creg Lorenzetti and Eric
Hardgrave while the younger
players develop against con
ference pitching.
With thegraduation of ASU's
Alvin Davis, Aldrete could be
the premiere first baseman in
the Six-Pac. He batted .354 last
year and wields an exceptional
glove in the field.
Lorenzetti made the move
from outfield to third base in
the fall and Marquess said the
transition went very well.
Hardgrave will return as the
designated hitter and will bac
kup Aldrete at first base.
Stanford's main weakness
lies in the heart of its ball club.

The Cardinal defense of a
year ago has seen its middle —
catcher, second baseman,
shortshop and centerfielder —
stripped away.
Defense was the Cardinal's
downfall in last season's World
Series, Marquess said, "al
though that was somewhat
ironic since that was our strong
suit last season." Now the Car
dinal must rebuild it from
scratch, at least until key veter
ans Dotterer and Stephens can
return from injuries.
"I must admit that my main
concern as we enter this sea
son is team defense — espe
cially up the middle where we
will be so young," Marquess
said.
Gone from the heart of the
Cardinal defense is catcher
Bob Hausladen, second base
man Steve Buechele and
shortstop Bob DeCosta — all to
graduation. Centerfielder
Stephens is recovering from li
gament damage to his right
knee and will be lost for at least
half the season.
Leftfielder Dotterer, a First
Team All-Pac-10 player last
year, underwent surgery on his
shoulder last fall. Dotterer
(.359, 24 stolen bases) hit safely
in 53 out of 60 games last sea
son and has a career batting
average of .352. Dotterer
should also return at mid
season.
Freshman Mike Deßenon
will start in right field, replac
ing a graduated Mike Tooth
man. Deßenon is a power hit
ter and possesses a strong arm.
Mark Warren, a junior col
lege transfer, will start in left
until Dotterer returns and
freshman Mike Davis will hold
down center field until
Stephens is back.
Pete Stanicek, a speedy run
ner who may bat lead-off, is
vying for the second base spot
while Craig Verducci (.333 last
year) is battling for the
shortstop position. One or
both may start depending on
where Marquess plays untility
infielder Vince Sakowski, who
played backup for all infield
positions last year.
