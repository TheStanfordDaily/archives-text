### SARAH CARREL 
Both of Stanford's gymnas
tics teams travel south this
weekend to take on tough op
ponents.
The men's team battles
Arizona State and the Univer
sity of New Mexico at a tri-meet
in Tempe, Arizona, while the
women will come head-to
head with the University of
Southern California in Los
Angeles.
Arizona State can now boast
being one of the five top teams
in the nation. Although they
are not a group of outstanding
individual performers, it is
their depth and consistency
that has gotten themtothetop.
In a recent me<>t against UCLA,
ASU scored an amazing 276 out
of a possible 300 points.
Vet the Cardinal will counter
with its own depth, promising

one of the toughest and closest
matches of the season. Al
though the Cardinal already
lost to ASU earlier in the sea
son at Maples Pavilion,it is now
scoring well above what the
Sun Devils scored in that meet.
For once, Stanford is boasting a
healthy team Even junior )im
Campanelli, who has been
plagued with a knee injury
most of the year, will be able to
compete in the pommel horse
and rings.
"It is very important to beat
them (ASU), because if we do,
it's almost certain that we'll go
to the NCAA championships,"
said head coach Sadao
Hamada. Stanford is gunning
for its first-ever trip to the na
tionals, this season, which
looks entirely possible if the
team continues to score above
270, as it has in recent meets.
The University of New
Mexico will also provide stiff
Competition fortheCard
Meanwhile, the women take
on USC, one of the top 15
teams in the nation. The Cardi
nal has been plagued with in
juries this season, which will
keep top gymnast Carolyn Tar

kington out of action.
Despite all this, head coach
Homer Sardina is still optimis
tic. We've lost our number
one all-arounder (Tarkington)
and Merilyn Chapman, and
we're still scoring better and
better each meet," he said.
"I'm looking for us to score
right around 177 or 178 (out of
200)."
