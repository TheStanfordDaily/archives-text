# Revelli to return against Sun Devils
## 
### STEVE ODELL Senior sports writer 
Former NBA stars Doug Col
lins; Henry Bibby and Garfield
Heard are heading to Maples
Pavilion Saturday at 3:30 p.m.
with the Arizona State basket
ball team for a Pacific-10 con
ference basketball game with
Stanford, but mercifully for
Cardinal coach Tom Davis,
they will be on the bench.
Collins; Bibby and Heard
are in their first year as assis
tants for ASU coach Bob
Weinhauer, whose team is 5-3
(4-4) in the Pac-10 and 11-10
(10-11) overall after last night's
victory (loss) over (to) Califor
nia in Berkeley.
Someone who will be off the
bench, however, and for the
first time in over two weeks is
Cardinal center John Revelli.
Stanford's leading scorer and
rebounder, Revelli injured his
ankle midway through the sec
ond half of Stanford's 92-74 vic
tory over USC on Jan. 20.
Stanford fell to 2-5 in the
conference and 10-7 overall
with road losses to Washington
and Washington Sate last
weekend, while Arizona State
lost to Oregon State and beat
Oregon in the final seconds at
home.
Although Hans Wichary will
start at center, Revelli is ex
pected to log quite a few min

utes of playing time against the
Sun Devils. He has been prac
ticing with the team in drills
since Tuesday; gradually put
ting more weight and pressure
on the ankle every day.
Wichary has responded well
in Revelli's absence, scoring 40
points in the last three games
and pulling down a season
high 11 rebounds against the
Cougars.
Other recent newcomers to
the Cardinal starting line-up
are 6-1 junior guard Ricky
Lewis, who has replaced Keith
Ramee, and 6-2 sophomore
Steve Brown, who will play at
small forward for Andy Fischer.
Lewis started his first game
against WSU and played 29
minutes without a turnover.
Brown, who is starting to look
for his soft jumper with more
frequency, scored 12 points
against both Washington and
Washington State.
Second-leading scorer Keith
Jones, who is loading up the
nets for 17.0 points a game will
start at the other guard posi
tion, and freshman Earl Kober
lein will stay at his starting for
ward post.
Arizona State is basically a
two-man show offensively,
with guard Byron Scott and
forward Paul Williams combin
ing for over half of the team's
