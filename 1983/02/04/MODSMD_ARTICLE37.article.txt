# SC, Miller invade SU
## 
### LIBBY LEONARD 
It's hard for the USC women
hoopsters of Troy to stage a
surprise attack. They simply
have too many big weapons to
conceal.
The Cardinal women's bas
ketball team has already been
forewarned about the Trojans'
Palo Alto arrival. And tonight
the Card must battle No. 2 USC
at 7:30 p.m. in Maples Pavilion.
The Card will have its hands
full. USC is a high-caliber club
that consistently attracts
thousands of spectators. Draw
ing a crowd is a unique feat in
women's basketball. Stanford
seldom has more than 200 fans
in attendance.
The Trojans, however, fea
ture a star-studded lineup that
has gained national recogni
tion and the press spotlight.
USC's main attraction is
6-foot-2 freshman Cheryl Mil
ler. Last year, Miller scored 105
points in one game and was the
most sought-after prep pros
pect in the country.
Statistics reveal that Miller is
a threat on both ends of the
court. In her first collegiate
season, she is averaging 20.8
points and 9.3 rebounds a
game. The gifted athlete also
leads her team with 63 steals
and 30 blocked shots.
But what makes Miller such
an attraction is her leaping abil
ity — s he is the only woman
ever to slam dunk in formal
competition.
Freshman Rhonda Win
dham, a swift point guard, de
ftly runs USC's fast break.
Windham has tallied 93 assists
with her pin-point passing.
Ail-American juniors Pam
and Paula McGee join Miller to
anchor the USC front court.
The twin-sister act averages 37
points and 18 boards each out
ing.
According to Cardinal coach
Dotty McCrea, the Cardinal
must play tough defense, re
bound well and deny the ball to
Miller and the McCees inside.
Otherwise, the taller Trojans
could have a field day.
The Trojans are good but not
invincible. After compiling 13
early wins, they have been
upset twice in the past two
weeks. One loss was against
defending NCAA Champion
Louisana Tech and the other
was against Long Beach State.
Stanford will not have much
time to reset after tonight's
Trojan war. Tomorrow the
Card faces Fullerton State at
5:45 p.m. following the men's
game at 3:30 p.m.
