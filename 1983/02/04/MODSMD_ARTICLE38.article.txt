# Swimmers in for test against UCLA

### SHAILENDRA BHUMRALKAR 
Coming off a big dual
meet victory over Taxas, the
men's swimming team
wants to keep the ball roll
ing.
But the Cardinal will have
a tough time doing so this
weekend, with defending
NCAA champ UCLA and
arch rival USC invading the
Farm. Stanford faces UCLA 1
p.m. today and USC Satur
day at 1 p.m.
UCLA is definitely the
tougher of the two. "We've
never beaten UCLA, and
they're favored again on

paper Coach Skip Kenney
said." The stroke races,
those other than freestyle,
will be extremely important,
Kenny said since the Bruins
have a lot more speed.
UCLA will be led by Tom
Jager and Chris Silva in the
50 and 100 freestyle races.
The Cardinal will match up
with Sam Worden, Ricky
Bodor and Dave Bottom.
Bruin Stu Mac Donald will
battle Bodor and Worden in
the 200 freestyle. In what
could be the best race of the
day, Stanford will send Bari
Weick and Dave Sims to the

line in the 500 free against
UCLA's Bruce Haye.
The 200 butterfly will also
be a key event. Bruce Dor
man will compete for the
Bruins and Jon Denney and
Charlie Johnson for the
Cardinal.
Kenney predicted that
UCLA is now the only obsta
cle in Stanford's path to an
undefeated dual meet sea
son. But he cautioned, "If
we lose to UCLA now, it's
not that important." The
NCAA Championships in
March are most important
to the team, Kenney said.
