Bowling

The men's bowling team hosted
the annual Cardinal Classic last
weekend. San Jose State won the
eight-team invitational while the
Card finished in a disappointing
last place. Rob Wood, Ron Clockvin
and Gordon Battaile hold top posi
tions on the bowling ladder.
Skiing
The ski team, a member of the Na
tional Collegiate Ski Association,
competes against seven other
schools in slalom and giant slalom
races each weekend. Last month,
Stanford finished second in one
race, fourth in another. Sierra Col
lege is hosting a race tomorrow and
Sunday at Soda Springs.
Rugby
The women's rugby club boasts a
9-0-1 record. Last Saturday, Stanford
tied Berkeley, 4-4. The Card takes on
the Sacramento women's rugby
team tomorrow. Jean Sanders and
Jennifer Crawford lead Stanford in
scoring with 28 and 16 points, re
spectively.

Squash
After beating Parnassus Heights,
5-0, Wednesday night, the men's
squash club stands 4-1 in league
play. Stanford will host the Bay Club
next Wednesday. Graduate students
Andy Michaels, Trevor Hastie,
Michael Fine, Steven Park and Steve
Wolders hold the first five spots on

Stanford's competitive ladder.
Swimming
The synchronized swimming team
will participate in its first meet of the
quarter this Sunday at 10 a.m. Ber
keley, Fresno State and Davis will be
competing against host Stanford.
The meet features two events â€” a
seven-women team routine and a

duet.
Sailing
Stanford's sailors show promise
for the future. Stanford hosted the
Hangover Bowl, named because it is
traditionally the first regatta of the
New Year. Stanford won the regatta
with Long Beach and UCSB in sec
ond and third places.
