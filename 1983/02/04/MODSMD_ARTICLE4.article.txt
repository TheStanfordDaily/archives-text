# ASSU blasts Pub Board action
## 
### KIMBERLY BROWN Senior staff writer 
The Publications Board's decision
not to adopt new ASSU Senate guide
lines for election endorsements is
being interpreted by the senate as an
act of defiance.
Intended as a request that the
ASSU reconsider its demands, the
Pub Board voted Monday to "not
take any regulatory action."
According to ASSU senator |im
McGrath, "the Pub Board directly de
fied an order of the senate —
everyone I've talked to is outraged."
McGrath said the senators with
whom he had discussed the issue
were "dismayed" that "an inferior
body had deliberately defied an or
der."
"This regulation was not intended
as an act of defiance," said Pub Board
chair Doug Fine. "In the eyes of most
of the publications, having a student
government board regulating their
editorial policies is a form of censor
ship."

The Pub Board's response to the
senate's request has not yet been
formally considered by the senators.
It will be discussed Tuesday night, in
addition to the Pub Board's winter
quarter allocations.
"It was ironic that the Pub Board
refused a direct order of their
superior body and also asked for
winter quarter allocations at the
same time," said McGrath.
According to McGrath, there is a
good chance the allocations request
— funding given to the various pub
lications by the ASSU via the Pub
Board fee assessment — may be sus
pended. "I don't think the senate is
going to be very sympathetic," he
said.
The allocations are usually given a
"red stamp approval," he said, "and
the entire process takes less than 3D
seconds. I expect there will be some
debate this time around."
