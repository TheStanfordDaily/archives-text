# ASSU blasts Pub Board action
## 
### KIMBERLY BROWN Senior staff writer 
The Publications Board's decision
not to adopt new ASSU Senate guide
lines for election endorsements is
being interpreted by the senate as an
act of defiance.
Intended as a request that the
ASSU reconsider its demands, the
Pub Board voted Monday to "not
take any regulatory action."
According to ASSU senator |im
McGrath, "the Pub Board directly de
fied an order of the senate —
everyone I've talked to is outraged."
McGrath said the senators with
whom he had discussed the issue
were "dismayed" that "an inferior
body had deliberately defied an or
der."
"This regulation was not intended
as an act of defiance," said Pub Board
chair Doug Fine. "In the eyes of most
of the publications, having a student
government board regulating their
editorial policies is a form of censor
ship."

The Pub Board's response to the
senate's request has not yet been
formally considered by the senators.
It will be discussed Tuesday night, in
addition to the Pub Board's winter
quarter allocations.
"It was ironic that the Pub Board
refused a direct order of their
superior body and also asked for
winter quarter allocations at the
same time," said McGrath.
According to McGrath, there is a
good chance the allocations request
— funding given to the various pub
lications by the ASSU via the Pub
Board fee assessment — may be sus
pended. "I don't think the senate is
going to be very sympathetic," he
said.
The allocations are usually given a
"red stamp approval," he said, "and
the entire process takes less than 3D
seconds. I expect there will be some
debate this time around."
According to business manager of
the Stanford Independent Tom
Counts, the ASSU is trying to "send a
signal that they really do mean busi
ness."
By postponing the vote on the al
locations until the next meeting —
two weeks from Tuesday — the pub
lications would be placed in the
awkward position of having to for
mulate some sort of election guide
lines during the interim or face pos
sible bankruptcy.
The publications receiving money
from the Pub Board are in a precari
ous situation because their funding
is contingent upon the Pub Board's
relations with the senate.
Rumors of the senate's possible
suspension of the allocations as a re
primand of the Pub Board's decision
have already elicited responses from
the Pub Board and its members.
Fine said he believes it will be pos
sible to compromise and address the
concerns of both the senators and
the publications. In a letter ad
dressed to the senate, he suggested
that the Pub Board require each pub
lication to submit its internal guide
lines for election coverage. The
Board would make no judgment on
these guidelines, but they would be
available for the public.
The senate will probably expect
the Pub Board to approve the guide
lines, Fine said. "But knowing the
sentiments of the members of the
board, I think the furthest they will
agree to is submitting individual en
dorsement guidelines."
In response to rumors that the
senate will not approve the alloca
tions until the guidelines are
adopted, Fine said the action would
only antagonize the publications and
complicate the situation.
"The allocations are funded by
students who gave a dollar believing
that their money would be distri

buted in a fair manner to campus
publications, not that it would be
used as a bargaining tool by the sen
ate," Fine said.
"In addition, without their alloca
tions, some publications will not be
able to pay their bills of the quarter
and will have to cease publication,"
he said.
The editors of the Independent
have written an editorial supporting
the Pub Board's refusal to comply
with the senate's endorsement re
quests. "The ASSU should not vio
late the rights of the Stanford com
munfty to read uncensored stories
and editorials," they contend.
