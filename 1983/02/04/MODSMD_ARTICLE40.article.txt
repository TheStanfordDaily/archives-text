# Crew rows around the clock
## 
### BETH KLEID 
The Club Sports women's crew
team is rowing its way to more
funding, but this rowing is being
done on land.
Yesterday at noon the team
began its annual row-a-thon in
White Plaza, which ends today at
noon. With rowing machines in
stead of boat oars, the crew
women expect to use their muscles
to raise $4000 for their team.
In the row-a-thon, team mem
bers work the rowing machines for
24 hours continuously. The 35
women row in 20 minute shifts
throughout the day and night in
order to raise funds for their up
coming racing season.
Team captain Margi Fetter said,
"We have always had money prob
lems. We get some money from
Club Sport funding, but it isn't very
much. We have to raise a lot of
money on our own."

This winter's stormy weather has
caused a greater need for extra
funding for the crew teagn than in
the past. "Docks need to be re
placed because of damage from
high tides. We have to repair boats,
which are fragile and expensive.
The money we raise will go to these
basic operational expenses," Fet
ter said.
The winter row-a-thon and the
stadium clean-ups after football
games serve to raise a sufficient
amount of money for the team. For
the row-a-thon each team member
solicits sponsors to give a specific
amount of money for each mile
they row. "Usually people get five
and 10 cent donations per mile
from friends in their dorms," Fetter
said.
Occasionally, the crew team re
ceives large donations from
alumni. This year a woman alum
nus made a deal with the team: if
members can raise $4000, she will

match it.
"We really hope to mate h her so
we can buy a new boat which will
cost from $HOOO to $10,000," Fetter
said. "We all had to really buckle
down and get a lot of sponsors
The women who rowed shifts in
the early morning should have had
no trouble functioning at that time
as a result of habit. The wee hours
of the morning are not unfamiliar
to the crew team member. Crew
practice begins at 6 a.m. Team
members wake up at about 5:15
a.m. before the drive to Redwood
City for workout.
The team works out year round.
Their racing season is in the spring,
and they try to finish raising money
by that time. In addition to their
White Plaza rowing exhibition on
land, this quarter brings with it in
tensive work-outs on the water to
get the team in top condition for
the spring season.
