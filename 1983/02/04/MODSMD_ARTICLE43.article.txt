# Women win, too
## Netters win in LA 
### MARK ZEIGLER 
Surprise, surprise.
That's what went through
Men's Tennis Coach Dick
Gould's head after his
freshman-dominated team
routed Clemson 8-1 yesterday
in the first round of the Na
tional Team Championships in
Los Angeles.
It wasn't so much that Stan
ford, seeded eighth in the 16-
teani tournament, beat the No.
10 Tigers, but that it beat them
so convincingly without the
singles play of junior Scott
Davis, the Cardinal's No. 1 net
ter.
Davis, who faced Ivan Lendl
(and lost 6-4, 6-4) in Philadel
phia at the U.S. Pro Indoor
Championships Wednesday
night, was unable to catch
planes that put him in Los
Angeles in time for yesterday
morning's single matches.
As a result, Stanford was
forced to forfeit the No. 1 sing
les match to Clemson and
began the morning's match al
ready behind 1-0.
But the youthful Card ladder
captured all eight of the other
matches in cold, windy wea
ther to record the team's first

victory in as many tries this sea
son.
"That was just a spectacular
way to start the season," Gould
said. "Those damn rookies
(freshmen) are just great."
Stanford takes on No. 2 seed
Pepperdine today, following
the Wave's victory over Miami
yesterday afternoon.
"Pepperdine this early in the
year is probably too strong for
us," Gould said yesterday from
his hotel room. "We're a long
shot tomorrow."
Gould's ''rookies,''
freshmen Eric Rosenfeld, Dan
Goldie and John Letts, led the
charge for the Cardinal in the
singles competition, all win
ning in straight sets while play
ing in the number two, three
and four spots, respectively.
Coach Frank Brennan and
his women's team also were
victorious yesterday, defeating
San lose State at Stanford Ten
nis Stadium.
The win ran the Cardinal's
winning streak to 23 matches.
The defending NCAA champs
went 20-0 last year, won their
final match of 1981 and have
been victorious in both tries
this season.
