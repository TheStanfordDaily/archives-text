which every film buff can recite
from memory ("You're Norma

j "I am big. It's the pictures that

travagance with an insider's
view of Hollywood, and main
tains a cynical tone that dist

Ife&i'rves up about itself. Gloria

Tbe World According to
Carp
Memorial Auditorium
Inevitably any film of John
Irving's dense, fulfilling novel
would seem thin, and so de-
I I spite the clear-headedness of
Steve Tesich's script and the
seamless manner in which
George Roy Hill has assembled
it, this movie doesn't fill you up.

But it is admirably intelligent,
and a lot of sequences stick with
you. Unfortunately, Robin Wil
liams doesn't offer us a Garp
with much depth; with his
marvellous baby face and en
dearing apple-cheeked grin,
he's often very funny, and he's
terribly good at conveying
childlike hurt, but he can't con
vince us that he's really a writer.
However, the supporting cast is
impressive: John Lithgow,
Glenn Close, Mary Beth Hurt,
Swoosie Kurtz, and in cameos,
Amanda Plummer, Jessica Tan
dy and Hume Cronyn.
Plays Sunday evening.
Love and Death (1975)
Kresge Auditorium
This is a funny Woody Allen
movie, but its snob appeal is a
put-off: you can't help being
conscious of the bewilderment
of moviegoers not conversant
with Dostoevsky and Chekhov
and Tolstoy at many of his jokes.
This is the closest filmic
equivalent to Allen's New
Yorker stories (or a play like
Tom Stoppard's Travesties).
With Diane Keaton, Jessica
Harper and talented young
Alfred Lutter, who played Ellen
Burstyn's son in Alice Doesn't
Live Here Anymore.
Plays tomorrow evening.

Double Indemnity (1944) ★
Kresge Auditorium
Barbara Stanwyck, in a sensa
tional blond wig, and Fred Mac-
Murray, giving easily the best
performance of a generally un
distinguished career, are Phyllis
Dietrichson and Walter Neff,
the quintessential film noir
couple, in this startlingly witty
film of James Cain's novel,
adapted by Raymond Chandler
and Billy Wilder and directed
by Wilder. Stanwyck plays the
femme fatale at the heart of all
of Cain's fiction: she persuades
Mac Murray, an insurance
agent, to help her kill her hus
band and collect the financial
benefits, and Wilder trains his
camera on her face while Mac-
Murray commits the murder.
Besides Stanwyck (who is
fabulous), Mac Murray, and Ed
ward G. Robinson as the claims
investigator, the cast is insipid,
but the dialogue really sparks.
(It's vintage Raymond
Chandler.) Based (loosely) on a
1927 murder case in Queens.
Plays Monday evening with
To Have and Have Not.
To Have and Have Not
(1944) ★
Kresge Auditorium
Warner Brothers bought the
title of an Ernest Hemingway
novella, but the crackling Jules
Furthman-William Faulkner
script has virtually nothing to
do with the book. In thh first of
four movies Humphrey Bogart
and Lauren Bacall made togeth
er, she teaches him how to
whistle and seems far too sexy
to turn into the dried-up, stri
dent trouper she would be
come after his death. They play
together marvellously in this

immensely enjoyable romantic
adventure melodrama, super
bly crafted by Howard Hawks
and co-starring Walter Bren
nan, Hoagy Carmichael,
Sheldon Leonard, Dolores
Moran, Dan Seymour and even
Marcel Dalio (of Renoir's
Grand Illusion and Rules of the
Came).
Plays Monday with Double
Indemnity.
The Kid (1921)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Chaplin at his most sen
timental. Luckily, the film has
enough humor and charm to
save at least the first two-thirds
of it. Chaplin plays The Tramp,
who finds a baby abandoned by
its unmarried mother (Edna
Purviance); he raises the boy
(Jackie Coogan), while the
mother, who has become a star,
haunts the slums, giving favors
to the street children in memo
ry of her loss. The melodrama,
■borrowed in part from Griffith's
Intolerance, is lumbering and
fairly shameless, but the slum
scenes have a surprising
authenticity. (Some of the at
mospheric detail recalls Ste
phen Crane's Maggie, A Girl of
the Streets.) The funniest se
quence involves the labor col
laboration of The Tramp and
The Kid: The Kid breaks win-

dows so that The Tramp, a '
glazier who carries panes of I
glass on his back, can find em- <
ployment replacing them. i
(Cocteau quoted this scene in
his 1949 Orpheus.) The worst
thing in the film is The Tramp's
dream, in which a demon flits
about tempting winged citizens
on a cleaned-up version of the
slum street.
Plays Thursday only with The
Circus and Shoulder Arms.

Vincent, Francois, Paul and
the Others (1974) ★
Cubberley Theater, 4000 Mid
dlefield Rd., Palo Alto
This drama about the friend
ship of three middle-aged men
hasn't a great deal of inner life
— it stays pretty much on the
level of literate soap opera —
but it's mysteriously touching.
The director, Claude Sautet,
keeps his camera in almost con
stant motion, and he is prodi
giously attuned to the rhythms
of nuance, so the movie seems
orchestrated. The elegant
fluidity of the camerawork (su
pervised by Jean Boffety) keeps
us at some remove from the
characters, yet the magnificent
cast — Yves Montand, Michel

Piccoli, Serge Reggiani, Gerard
Depardieu, Stephane Audran,
Marie Dubois, Ludmilla Mikael
and Antonella Lualdi — draws
us in; perhaps it is the tension
thus created, along with the vis
ual beauty of the film, that lends
it a saddening, tar-away glow.
As the salesman Vincent, whose
marriage and business go un
der, Montand gives'one of his
best performances; in some
ways it's a variation on the role
he played for Sautet in Cesar
and Rosalie two years earlier,
but it's far richer (and less com
ic).
Plays Wednesday evening.

Dietrichson and Walter Neff,
the quintessential film noir
couple, in this startlingly witty
film of James Cain's novel,
adapted by Raymond Chandler

by Wilder. Stanwyck plays the
femme fatale at the heart of all
of Cain's fiction: she persuades
Mac Murray, an insurance
agent, to help her kill her hus
band and collect the financial
benefits, and Wilder trains his
camera on her face while Mac-
Murray commits the murder.
Besides Stanwyck (who is

The Kid (1921)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Chaplin at his most sen

enough humor and charm to
save at least the first two-thirds

who finds a baby abandoned by
its unmarried mother (Edna
Purviance); he raises the boy
(Jackie Coogan), while the
mother, who has become a star,
haunts the slums, giving favors
to the street children in memo
ry of her loss. The melodrama,
■borrowed in part from Griffith's
Intolerance, is lumbering and
fairly shameless, but the slum
scenes have a surprising
authenticity. (Some of the at
mospheric detail recalls Ste
phen Crane's Maggie, A Girl of
the Streets.) The funniest se
quence involves the labor col
laboration of The Tramp and
The Kid: The Kid breaks win-

dows so that The Tramp, a '
glazier who carries panes of I
glass on his back, can find em- <
ployment replacing them. i
(Cocteau quoted this scene in

thing in the film is The Tramp's

haunts the slums, giving favors
to the street children in memo
ry of her loss. The melodrama,
■borrowed in part from Griffith's
Intolerance, is lumbering and
fairly shameless, but the slum
scenes have a surprising
authenticity. (Some of the at
mospheric detail recalls Ste
phen Crane's Maggie, A Girl of
the Streets.) The funniest se
quence involves the labor col
laboration of The Tramp and
The Kid: The Kid breaks win-

dows so that The Tramp, a '
glazier who carries panes of I
glass on his back, can find em- <
ployment replacing them. i
(Cocteau quoted this scene in
his 1949 Orpheus.) The worst
thing in the film is The Tramp's
dream, in which a demon flits
about tempting winged citizens
on a cleaned-up version of the
slum street.
Plays Thursday only with The
Circus and Shoulder Arms.

Vincent, Francois, Paul and
the Others (1974) ★
Cubberley Theater, 4000 Mid
dlefield Rd., Palo Alto
This drama about the friend
ship of three middle-aged men
hasn't a great deal of inner life
— it stays pretty much on the
level of literate soap opera —
but it's mysteriously touching.
The director, Claude Sautet,
keeps his camera in almost con
stant motion, and he is prodi
giously attuned to the rhythms
of nuance, so the movie seems
orchestrated. The elegant
fluidity of the camerawork (su
pervised by Jean Boffety) keeps
us at some remove from the
characters, yet the magnificent
cast — Yves Montand, Michel

Piccoli, Serge Reggiani, Gerard
Depardieu, Stephane Audran,
Marie Dubois, Ludmilla Mikael
and Antonella Lualdi — draws
us in; perhaps it is the tension
thus created, along with the vis
ual beauty of the film, that lends
it a saddening, tar-away glow.
As the salesman Vincent, whose
marriage and business go un
der, Montand gives'one of his
best performances; in some
ways it's a variation on the role
he played for Sautet in Cesar
and Rosalie two years earlier,
but it's far richer (and less com
ic).
Plays Wednesday evening.
