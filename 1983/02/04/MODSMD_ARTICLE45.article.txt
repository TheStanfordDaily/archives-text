# Faculty delays vote
## Some oppose quarter system 
### DOUGLAS JEHL Senior stuff writer 
The Faculty Senate again left unre
solved the issue of the academic
calendar when a tight meeting and
vocal oppostion to the quarter sys
tem forced adjournment of the meet
ing yesterday before a vote could be
taken.
It appears certain, however, that
the senate will vote at its next meet
ing to accept an ad hoc committee
report recommending retention of
the quarter system.
The report also encourages deans
and departments to consider exper
imenting with (he calendar to create
continuing courses lasting longer
than one quarter. Religious Studies
Prof. Edwin Good, committee chair
man, cited this as indicative of the
committee's openness to alterna
tives to the quarter system.
But Fnglish Prof. Ronald Rebholz
called that section "window dres
sing" for the committee's failure to
placate backers of the semester sys
tem. Rebholz, known as a resolute
supporter of semesters, said the con
tinuing courses would inevitably last
20 weeks, which he said was far too
long.
Calling the present system obnox
ious, Rebholz resisted proposals to

cut off debate and put the matter to a
vote. Paraphrasing William Shake
speare, Rebholz said, "I have much
to say on behalf of semesters, and
cynically threatened to filibuster
until the meeting was adjourned. Be
cause a meeting of the entire
academic council had been sched
uled in the same room, the senate
session was limited to one hour.
Others — chiefly professors in the
humanities and sciences — also
criticized the committee report, and
some recommended sending it back
to the committee to further investi
gate alternatives to the quarter sys
tem.
But none was as ardent as Rebholz,
and most seemed willing to vote on
the report, which has been in the
works for more than a year. James
Adams, associate dean of engineer
ing, said, "Mv feeling is that people
tend to vote on this issue on values
and what is said here can't convince
anyone very much.
But senate chairman Alexander
Fetter, professor of physics, called
for adjournment before a vote was
taken. "I want to make sure that
there's an appearance that justice
has been done," Fetter said, and
asked that debate be continued at
the next meeting two weeks hence.
