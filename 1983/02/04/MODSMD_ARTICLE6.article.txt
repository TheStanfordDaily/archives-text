Gorsuch appeal denied
Washington — A federal judge yesterday re
jected the Reagan administration's attempt to
sidestep a contempt of Congress case against
EPA chief Anne Gorsuch. That sent the Justice
Department scurrying for compromise in the
constitutional confrontation.
U.S. District Judge John Smith said he would
not intervene, for now, in the historic battle be
tween the executive branch and the House,
where Gorsuch was cited for contempt on Dec.
16.
That was bad news for the administration,
which had petitioned the court tothrow out the
case so the Justice Department would not be

obliged to present the House charge to a grand
jury for indictment. But Smith dismissed that
appeal.
The House voted 259 to 105 to cite the En
vironmental Protection Agency administrator
for contempt after she refused to give sensitive
law enforcement documents on hazardous
waste dumps to a House subcommittee. Just af
ter the vote, the justice Department filed its first
suit ever against the Congress, naming the
House, Speaker Thomas O'Neill, committee
chairmen and the chamber's officers as defen
dants.
Smith ruled in favor of the Congress two days
after oral argument on the House's motion to
dismiss the lawsuit.

"When constitutional disputesarise concern
ing the respective powers of the legislative and
executive branches, judicial intervention
should be delayed until all possibilities for set
tlement have been exhausted," Smith wrote.
Alternative budget surfaces
Washington — The first comprehensive alter
native to President Reagan's three-day-old
budget surfaced in Congress yesterday, a GOP
plan to trim the defense buildup, boost energy
taxes and spread this year's 10 percent income
tax cut over two years.
Sen. Slade Gorton of Washington called also
for a sharp reduction in Reagan's proposed $30
billion defense buildup while, separately, presi
dential aides attempted to fend off even heavier
criticism from Democratic members of Con
gress.
Democratic leaders from the House and Sen
ate, often at odds last year, vowed to work to
gether on "emergency legislation" costing $5
billion to $10 billion and providing food, shelter
and jobs to victims of the recession.
Gorton's plan is the first of several expected
to appear in the coming weeks. He proposed a
$14 billion cut in Reagan's proposed defense
buildup, a one-year freeze in cost-of-living in
creases for Social Security and other benefit
programs, and an overall freeze in hundreds of
domestic programs.
Bush talks hard-line
Brussels, Belgium — Vice President George
Bush expressed confidence here yesterday that
the United States would go ahead with the
deployment of nuclear missiles in North Atlan
tic Treaty Organization countries at the end of
this year if the Soviet Union continued to reject
the American "zero option" proposal in the
Geneva arms talks.
Following a two-hour meeting with NATO's
permanent ambassadors on the third stop in his
seven-nation European tour, Bush was ques
tioned sharply by European reporters about
possible compromises in the zero option pro
posal. He was also asked whether some NATO
countries might refuse to deploy the U.S. mis
siles if no compromise agreement emerged in
Geneva.
"I learned a long time ago not to answer
hypothetical questions," Bush said. He then
added, "The alliance is together. The alliance is
determined to go forward with what it has
agreed to go forward with. I come out of this
meeting today feeling good about the alliance

being together and strong from countries that
are basing countries for the missiles and coun
tries that are not but are supporting the pro
gram."
Under the zero option proposal, NATO's
plans to deploy 572 new cruise and Pershing II
missiles in Western Europe would be scrapped
— provided that the Soviet Union would at the
same time dismantle more than 300 SS-20 mis
siles that it has already deployed and targeted
against NATO. Bush, in fending off off a variety
of questions about the zero option, said the
proposal was "a strong moral position for the al
liance." But also said that he would take back to
Washington suggestions from the allies for a
shift or a compromise.
Truckers' strike heats up
Bushwhackers who have attacked more than
500 trucks during a violent truckers strike re
newed their assaults yesterday, and food bro
kers from St. Louis to Boston began feeling the
pinch of shortages.
Shipments of fresh fruit and vegetables
dwindled, shipping costs went up, and officials
warned consumers to be prepared to pay more
at the checkout counter. A Milwaukee brewery
cut back operations.
"The truckers are trying to get a little more
since they are out there ducking bullets now,"
said Bernie Kastor, a buyer at the Louisville Pro
duce Terminal Association in Kentucky, where
food distributors said they were paying up to 30
percent more for freight which was taking up to
twice as long to arrive.
Rebels retreat, American hurt
San Salvador, El Salvador — An army battalion
regained control of Berlin with little fighting
yesterday, after leftist guerrillas pulled out of
the biggest city they have captured and claimed
they fulfilled their objectives. They held it for

two days.
Col. Jaime Flores, who commanded the oper
ation, said about 1600 troops entered the city 70
miles east of San Salvador just before dawn,
then moved south to retake the small towns of
San Agustin and San Francisco Javier.
At least two government soldiers and 60 guer
rillas were reported killed as the rebel force of
some 500 men retreated from the city of 30000
in the southeast part of the country.
Drug habits change
Washington — Young Americans have cut
down their use of drugs such as marijuana and
methaqualone (Quaaludes), but more over
doses of cocaine and heroin are showing up in
hospital emergency rooms because of changes
in the ways these drugs are being used, accord
ing to government officials.
"The rapidly increasing epidemic of drug use
in this country in the 1960s and 1970s has finally
begun to recede, particularly among young
people," Dr. Edward Brandt, assistant secretary
for health at the Department of Health and Hu
man Services, said yesterday at a press con
ference. "However, while there may be fewer
illicit drug users in our population, we know
from the people who show up in emergency
rooms that the health consequences of drug
use have not abated."
Stocks gain, volume up
The stock market posted a moderate gain to
day amid continuing hopes for a recovery from
the recession.
Transportation issues were particularly
strong.
Today's weather
Sunny after patchy morning fog. Light winds.
Highs in mid-50s.
