Gorsuch appeal denied
Washington — A federal judge yesterday re
jected the Reagan administration's attempt to
sidestep a contempt of Congress case against
EPA chief Anne Gorsuch. That sent the Justice

executive branches, judicial intervention
should be delayed until all possibilities for set
tlement have been exhausted," Smith wrote.
