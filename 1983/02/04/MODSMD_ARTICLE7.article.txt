### JASON COLE 
The results of a survey of nearly
1200 Stanford freshmen have shown
that Stanford financial aid policies
are working well, that more students
describe themselves as "liberal"
than last year, and that interest in
education as a major field of study
has almost disappeared.
The survey, which is conducted
every fall for the American Council
on Education by Prof. Alexander
Astin of UCLA, questioned 188,692
freshman entering 350 colleges arid
universities. The results were re
leased this Monday by Director of
News and Publications Robert Be
yers.
The proportion of Stanford stu
dents expressing "major concern"
about financing college this year was
11.4 percent, compared to 11.9 per
cent in 1978. But the proportion cit
ing financial aid as a "very impor
tant" factor in selecting Stanford
rose from 23.1 to 31.3 percent in the
same period, according to Beyers.
The survey results indicated that
both the racial background and fam
ily income of Stanford students are
more diverse than those of freshmen
at other "highly selective private uni
versities".
Thus, according to Beyers, the Uni
versity's continuing policy to admit
students regardless of their financial
situation and then to meet their cal
culated financial need, appr trs to be
alleviating students' concerns over

financing college.
The survey also indicated that stu
dents entering Stanford this year are
somewhat more likely to describe
themselves as "liberal" than last year
(32.0 vs. 29.5 percent). The "middle
of the road" category remained sta
ble at 42.0 percent, while the "con
servative" category dropped to 24.1
percent, from 26.6 percent the year
before.
However, Stanford students re
mained more politically polar then
students at other private universities.
Nationally, students calling them
selves "liberal," "conservative" and
"middle of the road" numbered 27.0,
26.6 and 43.8 percent respectively.
Astin said that 1982 was the first time
in 10 years that the number of liberals
in the survey has grown on a national
level.
Some of the other results of the
survey were:
Engineering became the number
one '"intended major field of study "
for freshmen here. The field has
grown sharply, from 14.7 percent
in 1978 to 22.9 percent in 1982. En
gineering also came close to
medicine as the number one pre
ferred career. Astin indicated that
this trend towards engineering has
been happening for six or seven
years now.
One in five freshmen (20.6 per
cent) said they had taken computer
assisted courses prior to college and
