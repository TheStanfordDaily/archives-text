# Faculty, staff oppose SLAC nuclear weapons research

### JEFF BIDDULPH Senior staff writer 
About 15 faculty and 280 staff members at the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) have signed petitions
opposing the proposed construction of beam lines at
the Stanford Synchrotronic Radiation Laboratory (SSRL)
which would aid in the development of nuclear
weapons.
If the beam lines were built it would be the first time
scientists had openly used SSRL for nuclear weapons
research, according to Arthur Bienenstock, SSRL's direc
tor.
Construction of the beam lines, which was proposed
by the nation's three largest nuclear weapons research
labs in conjuction with the University of California,
would be funded primarily by the Dept. of Energy's
Office of Military Applications.
SSRL is administratively independent from SI AC, but
it uses the accelerator center's storage ring for its re
search program. The Department of Energy funds SLAC

entirely and is the principal funding source for SSRL.
Research that would take place under the proposal
would not be classified, according to Gerald Lieberman,
dean of graduate studies and research. The University
prohibited classified research on campus as a result of
student protests in the late 'bOs.
Faculty and staff members at SLAC said they oppose
construction of the beam lines because they feel "it is
inappropriate for us to be involved in the SSRL's nuclear
weapons research," according to Greg Loew, the deputy
director of the technical division at SLAC. Loew co
authored a letter which was sent to the Committee on
Research and signed by 15 faculty members at SLAC.
"People are going to feel tainted if it's constructed,"
said Mary James, an engineering physicist and the au
thor of the petition which was signed by 280 staff mem
bers and sent to Wolfgang Panofsky, the director of
SLAC. "There was a tacit understanding when we came
to work here that that kind of work wasn't going to be
done."

We have to decide what is morally right and what is
mi i rally wrong, lames said. "We're not going to actively
pa r t icipate in nuclear weapons — that's not why we're
hete."
nhn Harris, the director of the Stanford Positron-
El* iron Accelorator Ring, the storage ring at SLAC, said
th :t the? petition represents the feelings "of about 60
percent of the people at SLAC."
'lAC attracts many top-level physicists who aren't
interested in weapons research and is one of the few
pi ices these physicists can work, according to
Bi nenstock. He noted that SSRL is theonly laboratory in
th United States capable of providing the radiation
net essary for the weapons research.
loyd Multhauf, spokesman for those who are propos
irt , construction emphasized the importance of SSRL's
position as the sole facility of this kind.
It's in our interests to build them (the beam lines),"
M ilthauf said. "If they aren't approved we'll have to

'People are going to feel tainted
if it's constructed. There was a tacit
understanding when we came to
work here that that kind of work
wasn't going to be done/
look for other ways to meet the needs of our facilities."
He said that SSRL is presently so crowded that many
don't get time" to perform their research. The construc
tion of the beam lines would alleviate the problem, he
said.
The construction of the beam lines would detect
X-rays caused by the radiation emitted from accelerated
electrons and positrons from SLAC. They could also be
used in many other studies other than nuclear weapons
research, Bienenstock said, such as research on how
atoms rearrange themselves in biological materials.
lames, whose job is to bunch electrons so that they
can be accelerated, said that she is concerned that most
of the research will be on weapons because most of the
money is coming from weapons groups.
The construction, which would be funded by $5.2
million from the Dept. of Energy and $1 million from
U.C., is now in the discussion stages. The weapons
research laboratories — Lawrence Livermore, Los
Alamos, and Sandia National Laboratories — and U.C.
proposed the beam line construction in December,

prompting immediate verbal protests from staff mem
bers. lames wrote up the petition three weeks ago.
Separate proposals from the research laboratories and
U.C. were presented to SSRL as a package. But, accord
ing to Multhauf, "nothing from the U.C. side of the
proposal has anything to do with weapons."
The U.C. proposal only concerns research in biology,
chemical materials sciences and physical sciences, ac
cording to Multhauf.
SSRL's proposal review panel is now considering the
proposal. They will eventually make a recommendation
to Bienenstock, and he will have to make the decision
whether ornot to build the beam lines. It could take
several months for the proposal review panel to report
to Bienenstock, however.
Bienenstock said he does not have enough informa
tion now to say whether he would favor construction of
the beam lines. He said he has written a letter to the
proponents of the construction saying that the proposal
could not be approved without more information. They
are in the process of sending him more information, he
said.
Bienenstock said that construction, if approved,
would begin in September at the very earliest.
