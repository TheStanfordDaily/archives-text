# Faculty, staff oppose SLAC nuclear weapons research

About 15 faculty and 280 staff members at the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) have signed petitions
opposing the proposed construction of beam lines at
the Stanford Synchrotronic Radiation Laboratory (SSRL)
which would aid in the development of nuclear
weapons.
If the beam lines were built it would be the first time
scientists had openly used SSRL for nuclear weapons
research, according to Arthur Bienenstock, SSRL's direc
tor.
Construction of the beam lines, which was proposed
by the nation's three largest nuclear weapons research
labs in conjuction with the University of California,
would be funded primarily by the Dept. of Energy's
Office of Military Applications.
SSRL is administratively independent from SI AC, but
it uses the accelerator center's storage ring for its re
search program. The Department of Energy funds SLAC

entirely and is the principal funding source for SSRL.
Research that would take place under the proposal
would not be classified, according to Gerald Lieberman,
dean of graduate studies and research. The University
prohibited classified research on campus as a result of
student protests in the late 'bOs.
Faculty and staff members at SLAC said they oppose
construction of the beam lines because they feel "it is
inappropriate for us to be involved in the SSRL's nuclear
weapons research," according to Greg Loew, the deputy
director of the technical division at SLAC. Loew co
authored a letter which was sent to the Committee on
Research and signed by 15 faculty members at SLAC.
"People are going to feel tainted if it's constructed,"
said Mary James, an engineering physicist and the au
thor of the petition which was signed by 280 staff mem
bers and sent to Wolfgang Panofsky, the director of
SLAC. "There was a tacit understanding when we came
to work here that that kind of work wasn't going to be
done."

We have to decide what is morally right and what is
mi i rally wrong, lames said. "We're not going to actively
pa r t icipate in nuclear weapons â€” that's not why we're
hete."
nhn Harris, the director of the Stanford Positron-
El* iron Accelorator Ring, the storage ring at SLAC, said
th :t the? petition represents the feelings "of about 60
percent of the people at SLAC."
'lAC attracts many top-level physicists who aren't
interested in weapons research and is one of the few
pi ices these physicists can work, according to
Bi nenstock. He noted that SSRL is theonly laboratory in
th United States capable of providing the radiation
net essary for the weapons research.
loyd Multhauf, spokesman for those who are propos
irt , construction emphasized the importance of SSRL's
position as the sole facility of this kind.
It's in our interests to build them (the beam lines),"
M ilthauf said. "If they aren't approved we'll have to
