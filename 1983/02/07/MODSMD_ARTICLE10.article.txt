# Students gain insight from the elderly
## 
### MARISSA QUIROZ 
It's tough to "sell" companionship, but that's what
graduate student fom Robinson and sophomore
Todd Kerr intend to do.
Robinson and Kerr are in the final stages of organiz
ing ASSU Friends and Helpers, a volunteer organiza
tion designed to help retired faculty and staff mem
bers and their families. As participants in the pro
gram, students will be paired up with a senior citizen
and perform tasks such as shopping, cooking, and
driving.
There is a need for this in the (Stanford) commu
nity,, Robinson said. "It. . . provides a learning expe
rience outside of the classroom." Kerr and Robinson
said they do not view the program as solely a service
for the elderly, but as something that may benefit
students as well.
Senior citizens provide a view to "a side of life
everyone will go through" Robinson said.
Both directors have had experience working with

senior citizens and are currently involved with private
senior citizen programs in the area. Three years ago,
Robinson organized a SWOPSI course entitled The
Baby Boom Cone Gray which required students to do
volunteer work at senior centers in the area. Volun
teering experiences add to knowledge of not only the
aging process but promote interaction with another
generation, according to Kerr and Robinson.
Recruiting for the program has just started. To date,
the two organizers are the only people definitely
committed, although 15 students have signed up and
filled out general applications.
Kerr suggested that personal experience inspired
this response "It could be that they were thinking
about their own grandparents," he said. "Enthusiasm
is personally related."
ASSU Friends and Helpers have sent 150 letters to
retired faculty and staff memhers and tfyeir families.
The program will begin within two weeks*, contingent

on requests from senior citizens. Robinson said the
effort will stay small until the feedback from seniors
and volunteers warrants expansion.
Carol Yanofsky, director of the Seniors Center in
Palo Alto, said she believes that Friends and Helpers
will receive "a favorable response" from students
and senior citizens. She said the program will allow
older people an alternative to entering care facilities
and provide a situation where they can remain inde
pendent.
Though it carries the ASSU name — both Kerr and
Robinson work for ASSU — Friends and Helpers is an
independent organization which currently relies on
unsolicited donations and gifts. But the directors plan
to try to get money from both the ASSU and the
University. The Board of the Faculty Club, Dean of
Student Affairs Jim Lyons and leanne Kennedy, di
rector of public relations for the Hospital have ex
pressed interest in the program.
