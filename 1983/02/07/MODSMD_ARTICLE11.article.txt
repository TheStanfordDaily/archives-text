# Meyer enforces food policy
## 
### STEPHANIE SANDBERG 
It seems easy enough:
just slip a Coke and an apple
into your backpack and flip
casually through the
turnstiles at Meyer Libary.
Hundreds of students do it.
But not enough students
who study at Meyer seem to
know they cause damage by
eating, according to the
staff, and so the library has
launched a tougher cam
paign against the smuggling
in of food and drink.

"Our aim is to inform the
students of the real danger
to the books that bringing
food into the library poses,"
said Elizabeth Salzar, head
of Meyer Library. "We have
janitorial service only every
other day, and leftover food
attracts vermin, which dam
age the books and cost us all
a lot of money."
The campaign is being
launched on many different
levels: a new logo of food
and drink behind a slash bar
has been designed and put
up around the library. The
library has printed leaflets
with information about the
damaging effects of food.
Offenders are being asked
to leave the library when
caught with food. A display

will begin Feb. 18 in the
Meyer lobby which will
demonstrate what happens
when food and books mix.
Sally Buchana, conserva
tion officer for University li
braries who will help Meyer
with the lobby exhibit, has
previously successfully
done such exhibits in both
Meyer and Green. "When
students see the effect of
their negligence, they tend
to respect the rule more,"
she said. "One Coke can
doesn't hurt anything, but
when they start coming in
by the hundreds, a real
problem exists."
The problem is especially
acute in Meyer, one staffer
said. Because Meyer stays
open longer than other li
braries and because stu
dents must go there to do
reserve reading, it is gener
ally the most popular libary.
The space is not as con
densed as in other libraries.
"Students can go off to their
corners and eat, nap, or
whatever, unobserved,"
the staffer said.
Winter quarter has tradi
tionally been the time when
the garbage problem wors
ens in libraries. Salzars said,
"We though we'd nip it in
the bud. With the bad wea
ther, more students start
coming into the libraries,
staying longer, and conse
quently bringing in their
'supplies,' making the gar
bage even more of a prob
lem."
The informational flyers
give a detailed explanation
of the consequences of
food in the library.
"I didn't know that mice
got in there,' one student
said.
The campaign is still inthe
early stages, so it is difficult
to measure its success as of
yet. But one Meyer staff
member said, "with all the
flyers out and the signs
around, people should
begin to take more notice.
But it's too early to tell if
they are."
