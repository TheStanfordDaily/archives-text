## The 						Stanford Daily Press rights jeopardized

Last week's Publications Board decision not to
adopt ASSU Senate guidelines for election en
dorsements outraged senators who have since
interpreted the move as an act of defiance.
We maintain that the Pub Board's statement
was not a "defiance of a superior body," but
rather a responsible attempt by Pub Board
chairman Doug Fine and committee members
to serve the interests of students by protecting
campus publications from censorship.
We support the Pub Board's action advising
against guidelines on endorsement procedures
which would give the senate undue control of
the election process. The committee members'
decision rightly recognizes the necessary divi
sion between student government and publica
tions funded by students. To a large extent the
Pub Board exists to provide publications with
expertise and with a certain protection from
political game-playing. Because of its additional
role as an advisory committee, the Pub Board
acted properly when it requested that the ASSU
reconsider its recommendations.
The potential for political interference — cen
sorship — is the source of opposition to the
guidelines. Senate control of election en
dorsement proceedings violates a fundamental
separation of student government and publica
tions. It threatens theautonomy of campus pub
lications by intimating a governmental right to
control the content and choice of any published

material.
The target of the guidelines is particularly dis
turbing. Comments about ASSU officers or
candidates for office should be the last area
subject to ASSU review. Arguments that the
ASSU doesn't intend to dictate who publica
tions nominate, just, "how to go about nominat
ing," miss the point. In this case, control over
determination of content differs little from con
trol over content itself.
The guidelines as worded are a piece of legis
lation unworthy of the senate. We urge them to
reconsider the wisdom of placing endorsement
procedure requirements at the discretion of a
government body, particularly one directly af
fected by the election's outcome.
Guidelines, however well-intended, would
bring campus publications under the senate
arm and damage publication credibility with the
reader by seemingly placing the publications in
the government's pocket. For this reason the
ASSU should disqualify itself from judging the
merits of campus publications' endorsement
proceedings.
The Pub Board's response to the senate's rec
ommendation may be formally discussed to
morrow night. While we approve of the ASSU's
efforts to serve the student community respon
sibly, we hope the ASSU will realize it can serve
the community best by refraining from action
which would result in any form of censorship.
