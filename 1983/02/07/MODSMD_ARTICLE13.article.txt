# Part-time prof: part II
## 
### 
"Part-time prof, named Sec. of State" read an
admittedly parochial Daily headline June 29,
1982. Now that he's made a name for himself in
Washington, favorite-son and former part-time
professor Secretary of State George Shultz will
be returning to campus June 12 as the featured
speaker at the University's 92nd annual com
mencement.
We agree with Dean of the Chapel Robert
Hamerton-Kelly, a member of the commence
ment speaker advisory group: "It's wonderful
news." Whatever reservations one might har
bor about current administration policy — a few
come to mind — Shultz is one of its most effec
tive and responsible members.
Before we jump for joy, however, we want to
take a minute to consider exactly why news of
Shultz's acceptance is "wonderful." Shultz will
be the fifth major U.S. government official to
speak at commencement in the last six years. Of
these five, he is also the fourth to have signifi
cant ties with the University. In fact, Shultz will
be the first commencement speaker in three
years who has no children currently enrolled
here.

Are we then merely congratulating ourselves
on the relative success of people with "Stanford
connections" and on the additional recognition
which Shultz's appearance will lend to the Uni
versity? Or will his presence here indicate ap
proval of administration foreign policy? Upon
further consideration, we think not.
With their words, commencement speakers
are not supposed to inspire an audience simply
to go forth and do exactly as they have done;
rather, by the example of their active engage
ment in human events, their task is to encour
age graduates to take their lives and do some
thing with them.
Those who have reached high places in gov
ernment are generally individuals who have
tried to shape the world rather than live from it.
We find this a reasonable qualification for
commencement speaker. As for "Stanford con
nections," we see no evil here. It seems only
natural that people to whom the University is in
some way meaningful are more likely to end up
behind the podium on June 12.
Barring some international crisis or diploma
tic breakthrough, we look forward to seeing our
former "part-time prof." there on that day.
