# Immigrating from liberal arts
## 
### 
This year, I am a first-year econom
ics graduate student here. Last year I
was a senior at Haverford College, a
small liberal arts institution on the
Main Line of Philadelphia. (I only at
tend schools with "-ford" in their
names.) At both schools, various
people want the school to be various
different things, with the result that
at least someone wants each school
to be practically anything you can
imagine. But just as a Haverford can't
be a Stanford, Stanford can't be a
Haverford, and it is important to un
derstand why. Examine a few as
sorted differences between the
schools.
At Haverford, many people wor
ried about upgrading the computer
facilities from outdated to semi
modern. Then, they worried about
attracting students to computer
courses. At Stanford, people worry
about getting students to leave the
security of their computer terminals
and take a few courses in the
humanities.
Stanford has nationally-ranked
teams and Nobel-prize-winning pro
fessors. Haverford doesn't have a
football team, and at the big soccer
games spectators sit or stand by the
side of the field to watch. The faculty
devotes most of its time to working
with students or preparing to work
with students, activities for which
Nobel prizes are not given.
Without running through com
parisons in odious, intricate detail,
all these differences have good and
bad sides. Haverford was right for me
as an undergraduate, but it was
surely not right for everyone. I was
enthusiastic about the idea of a lib
eral arts education, something that
Haverford tan do far better than
Stanford.
As I dodge brickbats from the Stan
ford humanities departments, I
should explain what I mean by that
assertion. A liberal arts education
operates on the premise that, al
thou each person has special
academic fascinations, the primary

goal of education is to relate that
specialty to other academic subjects
and to the world around the student.
As the dictionaries will tell you, a lib
eral arts education tries to provide "a
broad cultural background rather
than any specific cultural training."
Or as I have argued in the past, a
liberal arts education is aimed at
making you a better person, rather
than a better wage earner, or a better
information mill, or a better test
taker, or a better anything limited to
the particular.
A goal does not assure its own suc
cess, and I would not argue that
Haverford has created a production
line for saints and humanitarians.
Haverford graduates have at least
their share of warts and flaws. (Talk
to me if you can't believe this.) I'm
also confident that it is possible to
experience something close to my
idea of a liberal arts education at
Stanford. Most things are possible.
But take a look at the two institutions
and consider what they tend to do
and what they make possible.
An average Haverford department
would have four or five professors,
so every student is forced by the
sheer necessity of filling their class
schedule to explore their interests in
other fields. If you stayed in one de
partment, you could exhaust what
that departments had to offer you. At
Stanford, although you can be forced
to take a few courses outside your
major, one could effectively live
within a department.
Haverford is all undergraduates.
Stanford is half single-tracked
graduate students like myself,
people who are devoted (or trying
hard to be devoted), to a limited
academic specialty. At Haverford the
general feeling was that economics
was a tairiy applied field, oriented
more than most departments to fu
ture employment.
But at my new 'ford, after meeting
mechanical engineers and business
students and civil engineers and law
students and electrical engineers

and pre-medical students and chem
ical engineers and computer science
students, I am beginning to see eco
nomics as hypothetical and de
tached. When half the students (and
all the professors) are specialists, the
feeling rubs off a little on everyone
else.
At Haverford you were likely to
know someone from practically
every department and dormitory.
There weren't that many. As a
graduate student I am unqualified to
speak about the social life at Stan
ford, but it seems much harder to
meet a broad range of people. How
many people have good friends at
Stanford that they met outside of
classtime or dormitory?
Some other day, I will define
human goodness and scholarly vir
tue and how institutions can nurture
it. For the moment, it should be clear
that Stanford and Haverford have
different strengths. Stanford can at
tract brilliant professors, pay them to
write and think and research, and
give students a chance to follow
closely what these great minds are
doing and planning. That is a good
thing. Haverford offers a special
closeness and stresses the students'
original thoughts and ideas. That is a
good thing. "You pays your money
(and pays and pays, at either school),
and makes a choice."
In this world of declining enroll
ment and fiscal pressure, every edu
cational institution must define what
it is good at, what it can be good at,
and that special character it wants to
achieve. Stanford can be a superla
tive research university; Haverford
can be a superlative liberal arts col
lege. But the two schools cannot
switch places, and should not con
sider switching, even just a little.
Haverford cannot be a major univer
sity. Stanford cannot be a liberal arts
institution.

know someone from practically
every department and dormitory.
There weren't that many. As a
graduate student I am unqualified to
speak about the social life at Stan
ford, but it seems much harder to
meet a broad range of people. How
many people have good friends at
Stanford that they met outside of
classtime or dormitory?
Some other day, I will define
human goodness and scholarly vir
tue and how institutions can nurture
it. For the moment, it should be clear
that Stanford and Haverford have
different strengths. Stanford can at
tract brilliant professors, pay them to
write and think and research, and
give students a chance to follow
closely what these great minds are
doing and planning. That is a good
thing. Haverford offers a special
closeness and stresses the students'
original thoughts and ideas. That is a
good thing. "You pays your money
(and pays and pays, at either school),
and makes a choice."
In this world of declining enroll
ment and fiscal pressure, every edu
cational institution must define what
it is good at, what it can be good at,
and that special character it wants to
achieve. Stanford can be a superla
tive research university; Haverford
can be a superlative liberal arts col
lege. But the two schools cannot
switch places, and should not con
sider switching, even just a little.
Haverford cannot be a major univer
sity. Stanford cannot be a liberal arts
institution.

The view from normaley
This year, I am a first-year econom
ics graduate student here. Last year I
was a senior at Haverford College, a
small liberal arts institution on the
Main Line of Philadelphia. (I only at
tend schools with "-ford" in their
names.) At both schools, various
people want the school to be various
different things, with the result that
at least someone wants each school
to be practically anything you can
imagine. But just as a Haverford can't
be a Stanford, Stanford can't be a
Haverford, and it is important to un
derstand why. Examine a few as
sorted differences between the
schools.
At Haverford, many people wor
ried about upgrading the computer
facilities from outdated to semi
modern. Then, they worried about
attracting students to computer
courses. At Stanford, people worry
about getting students to leave the
security of their computer terminals
and take a few courses in the
humanities.
Stanford has nationally-ranked
teams and Nobel-prize-winning pro
fessors. Haverford doesn't have a
football team, and at the big soccer
games spectators sit or stand by the
side of the field to watch. The faculty
devotes most of its time to working
with students or preparing to work
with students, activities for which
Nobel prizes are not given.
Without running through com
parisons in odious, intricate detail,
all these differences have good and
bad sides. Haverford was right for me
as an undergraduate, but it was
surely not right for everyone. I was
enthusiastic about the idea of a lib
eral arts education, something that
Haverford tan do far better than
Stanford.
As I dodge brickbats from the Stan
ford humanities departments, I
should explain what I mean by that
assertion. A liberal arts education
operates on the premise that, al
thou each person has special
academic fascinations, the primary

goal of education is to relate that
specialty to other academic subjects
and to the world around the student.
As the dictionaries will tell you, a lib
eral arts education tries to provide "a
broad cultural background rather
than any specific cultural training."
Or as I have argued in the past, a
liberal arts education is aimed at
making you a better person, rather
than a better wage earner, or a better
information mill, or a better test
taker, or a better anything limited to
the particular.
A goal does not assure its own suc
cess, and I would not argue that
Haverford has created a production
line for saints and humanitarians.
Haverford graduates have at least
their share of warts and flaws. (Talk
to me if you can't believe this.) I'm
also confident that it is possible to
experience something close to my
idea of a liberal arts education at
Stanford. Most things are possible.
But take a look at the two institutions
and consider what they tend to do
and what they make possible.
An average Haverford department
would have four or five professors,
so every student is forced by the
sheer necessity of filling their class
schedule to explore their interests in
other fields. If you stayed in one de
partment, you could exhaust what
that departments had to offer you. At
Stanford, although you can be forced
to take a few courses outside your
major, one could effectively live
within a department.
Haverford is all undergraduates.
Stanford is half single-tracked
graduate students like myself,
people who are devoted (or trying
hard to be devoted), to a limited
academic specialty. At Haverford the
general feeling was that economics
was a tairiy applied field, oriented
more than most departments to fu
ture employment.
But at my new 'ford, after meeting
mechanical engineers and business
students and civil engineers and law
students and electrical engineers

and pre-medical students and chem
ical engineers and computer science
students, I am beginning to see eco
nomics as hypothetical and de
tached. When half the students (and
all the professors) are specialists, the
feeling rubs off a little on everyone
else.
