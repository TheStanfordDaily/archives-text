## Extremists set American mood 
### 
The recent debate about feminism
on "Firing Line" featured distin
guished speakers on both sides of
the question and was good fun to
watch. Let us say it ended in a sort of
tie. Any reasonable person should
realize that this is one of those deep
eternal controversies that are never
finally resolved, such as
environment/heredity, freedom/
determinism and all fundamental
polarities. One does well to throw up
one's hands in a characteristic Italian
gesture, expressing a resigned "SO
SO," down-the-middle humanity.
Of course, there is room for push
ing this way or that in specific cir
cumstances. But that is a "play it by
ear" situation which cannot be
blanket-legislation. Any decent
human knows when there is a case of
unfairness or exploitation. He may
not do anything about it. But there
are some things you can't do any
thing about wholesale; the shotgun
remedy is usually worse than the ill.
There have been 20 waves of
feminism historically and all ended. I
will not press the point Maury de
Riencourt made about each accom
panying a decadence but merely ob
serve that certain limits are implied
here which only illiterate or willfully
blind people would ignore. This

helps explain the relative lack of
interest in feminism in France and
otheroldercultures. Grim existential
realities like unemployment help to
put the matter in perspective.
The one-sided liberal and ideolog
ical approach you will find on most
campuses in America illustrates our
immaturity and faddishness if not
plain silliness. It is like other such
cults, for example thinness. You see
these compulsively scrawny types
around who look like hell on the one
hand and on the other there are 30
million Americans who are obese.
You tend not to find either extreme
in France.
"Pluralism" is another case in
point.
Ever si nee Plato's comments on the
one-many problem — referring for
example to the opposing views of
Heraclitus and Parmenides — we
have little excuse for not knowing
that reality is based on a constant
dialectical relation of these two polar
principles of unity and multiplicity.
When someone calls himself a
"pluralist," we can see the dialectical
swing immediately in the singleness
of the affirmation. (Aristotle drew at
tention to this bit of sophistry in his
comment on exclusive propositions
of truth.)
A person who so identifies himself
may indeed emphasize various ap
proaches, rather than one, but his
program soon jells into a specific
mishmash, and like everyone else he
has his preferences, prejudices and
intolerances. Moreover, like the
hippies who claimed unconven
tionally and became monotonously
similar, walking cliches and fair game
for New Yorker cartoons, pluralists
constitute a clique, one which has
done considerable damage to intel
lectual institutions.
Naturally, one is for tolerance in
our country, but wisdom says that
you have to be reasonable about that
as about most other things — "we
must be wise with sobriety," the
good Moliere noted — and go
roughly down the middle. That's why
Camus was against fanatic religion

and fanatic anti-religiousness ("the
anti-religious attitude is vulgar"). So
it is with pluralism. You have to bal
ance one principle with the other
most of the time. A great creator will
balance extreme openness with ex
treme closedness — that is Mal
larme's case, for example, seeming
to follow Pascal's dictum about
touching both extremes at the same
time.
But most people need milder
doses of the two most of the time.
That is why Camus berated Sartre for
putting his essence only after exis
tence: it unbalances your life and
deprives it of any sort of deep per
sonality, beauty, unity, and har
mony, day by day. Politically, it
leaves too much leeway to obses
sively teleological drives and ruthless
pragmatism.
Again, there is room for a loose
meaning to the word "pluralism,"
implying a tendency to tolerate vari
ous views (which is a specific bent, a
non-pluralist entity, I repeat), but
there is merit in knowing what is be
hind the buzzword because in the
long run there are better ways than
that and in the short run it has abet
ted a general amorality, emptiness
and confusion on campuses.
The other day a thoughtful and
candid student criticized my saying
these things the blunt way I do as
"counterproductive" and an ego
trip. Well, it is hard to keep the ego
out of anything but if you feel you are
telling the truth you'll just let that
pass. Surely he is right that I "turn
people off" or lots of them. They
don't like to have their mass assump
tions questioned. And if I have
learned anything in my many
academic years it is that almost no
one is interested in plain truth. If it
goes against interests or comfort
forget it. Power is far more appeal
ing. But truth has its own corrosive
long-range value, and I decided long
ago that that was what I had to offer,
cost what it may.

blanket-legislation. Any decent
human knows when there is a case of
unfairness or exploitation. He may
not do anything about it. But there
are some things you can't do any
thing about wholesale; the shotgun
remedy is usually worse than the ill.
There have been 20 waves of
feminism historically and all ended. I
will not press the point Maury de
Riencourt made about each accom
panying a decadence but merely ob
serve that certain limits are implied
here which only illiterate or willfully
blind people would ignore. This

helps explain the relative lack of
interest in feminism in France and
otheroldercultures. Grim existential
realities like unemployment help to
put the matter in perspective.
The one-sided liberal and ideolog
ical approach you will find on most
campuses in America illustrates our
immaturity and faddishness if not
plain silliness. It is like other such
cults, for example thinness. You see
these compulsively scrawny types
around who look like hell on the one
hand and on the other there are 30
million Americans who are obese.
You tend not to find either extreme
in France.
"Pluralism" is another case in
point.
Ever si nee Plato's comments on the
one-many problem — referring for
example to the opposing views of
Heraclitus and Parmenides — we
have little excuse for not knowing
that reality is based on a constant
dialectical relation of these two polar
principles of unity and multiplicity.
When someone calls himself a
"pluralist," we can see the dialectical
swing immediately in the singleness
of the affirmation. (Aristotle drew at
tention to this bit of sophistry in his
comment on exclusive propositions
of truth.)
A person who so identifies himself
may indeed emphasize various ap
proaches, rather than one, but his
program soon jells into a specific
mishmash, and like everyone else he
has his preferences, prejudices and
intolerances. Moreover, like the
hippies who claimed unconven
tionally and became monotonously
similar, walking cliches and fair game
for New Yorker cartoons, pluralists
constitute a clique, one which has
done considerable damage to intel
lectual institutions.
Naturally, one is for tolerance in
our country, but wisdom says that
you have to be reasonable about that
as about most other things — "we
must be wise with sobriety," the
good Moliere noted — and go
roughly down the middle. That's why
Camus was against fanatic religion

and fanatic anti-religiousness ("the
anti-religious attitude is vulgar"). So
it is with pluralism. You have to bal
ance one principle with the other
most of the time. A great creator will
balance extreme openness with ex
treme closedness — that is Mal
larme's case, for example, seeming
to follow Pascal's dictum about
touching both extremes at the same
time.
But most people need milder
doses of the two most of the time.
That is why Camus berated Sartre for
putting his essence only after exis
tence: it unbalances your life and
deprives it of any sort of deep per
sonality, beauty, unity, and har
mony, day by day. Politically, it
leaves too much leeway to obses
sively teleological drives and ruthless
pragmatism.
Again, there is room for a loose
meaning to the word "pluralism,"
implying a tendency to tolerate vari
ous views (which is a specific bent, a
non-pluralist entity, I repeat), but
there is merit in knowing what is be
hind the buzzword because in the
long run there are better ways than
that and in the short run it has abet
ted a general amorality, emptiness
and confusion on campuses.
The other day a thoughtful and
candid student criticized my saying
these things the blunt way I do as
"counterproductive" and an ego
trip. Well, it is hard to keep the ego
out of anything but if you feel you are
telling the truth you'll just let that
pass. Surely he is right that I "turn
people off" or lots of them. They
don't like to have their mass assump
tions questioned. And if I have
learned anything in my many
academic years it is that almost no
one is interested in plain truth. If it
goes against interests or comfort
forget it. Power is far more appeal
ing. But truth has its own corrosive
long-range value, and I decided long
ago that that was what I had to offer,
cost what it may.

The recent debate about feminism
on "Firing Line" featured distin
guished speakers on both sides of
the question and was good fun to
watch. Let us say it ended in a sort of
tie. Any reasonable person should
realize that this is one of those deep
eternal controversies that are never
finally resolved, such as
environment/heredity, freedom/
determinism and all fundamental
polarities. One does well to throw up
one's hands in a characteristic Italian
gesture, expressing a resigned "SO
SO," down-the-middle humanity.
Of course, there is room for push
ing this way or that in specific cir
cumstances. But that is a "play it by
ear" situation which cannot be
blanket-legislation. Any decent
human knows when there is a case of
unfairness or exploitation. He may
not do anything about it. But there
are some things you can't do any
