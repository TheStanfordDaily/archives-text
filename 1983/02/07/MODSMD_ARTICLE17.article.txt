Mural lacks faces
This letter is in regard to comments
made about Casa Zapata's mural. In
the article about its defacement
(Daily, Feb. 1), itwas stated that many
whites were offended by the mural
because they misinterpret it mes
sage. I often wonder how many
"people" in general find the mural
offensive.
I am of Hispanic background and
have spent close to half of my life in
Latin America. From living there, I
feel that I can safely say the Latin
Americans are of all races, just the
same as in the United States. If
people are to work toward a society
where a person is valued simply for
being a person, regardless of their
background and heritage, then the
portrayal of ethnic racism in our so
ciety as a simple "black and white"
issue does not make a positive con
tribution.
How are blond-haired, blue-eyed
Hispanics supposed to identify with
the mural? It would be a more posi
tive statement to have a mural depict
ing all the different peoples of Latin
America, not just one type.
This letter is not a justification of
the defacement of the mural. There
is no justification for the defacement
of a work of art.

. . . or features
Tuesday's paper reported that the
Zapata mural was defaced by the
painting of a face. (Daily, Feb. 1) In
fact, it was the mural that disenvis
aged a human image.
The mural affirms a sense of worth
that was denied, and expresses a
deep anger in the dripping blood.
But a blank head calls for a face, re
gardless of its color. Without seeing
any more than this simple truth, two
Donner freshmen took the approp
riate action. In the words of Albert
Camus, "Like great works, deep feel
ings always mean more than they are
conscious of saying."
A paint brush is no license to eter
nally proclaim a lie. Once a faceless
statement has been considered, a
time comes to assert that each
human is a person.
