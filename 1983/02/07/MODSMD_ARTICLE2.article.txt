# Hospital receives Medi-Cal
## 
### HILLARY EARNEST 
The Stanford Hospital is one of six
area hospitals to receive a contract
enabling it to continue treatment of
Medi-Cal patients, William Guy,
chief negotiator for the state, an
nounced Friday.
This means that the 15 percent of
Hospital patients who pay through
Medi-Cal will not be forced to seek
medical care elsewhere.
The hospitals submitted bids for
Medi-Cal contracts in November.
Under a new system that takes affect
March 1, the state will pay hospitals a
flat rate per Medi-Cal patient, regard
less of care received. Previously hos
pitals were reimburesed for a per
centage of the services performed
for Medi-Cal patients.
James Silverman, chief of staff at
the Hospital, said the change to a flat
rate per patient places hospitals in a
risky position because they are un
able to control the number of pa
tients they will receive and the types
of treatments that each will require.
"With the flat rate there is a fear
that some hospitals may start playing
games and might stop taking patients
who are really sick and require a lot
of expensive care," Silverman said.
"It has been my experience that
this medical staff will always admit a
sick patient," he added. "We won't
turn anyone away."
Lawrence Crowley, vice-president
for medical affairs, said the contract
is renegotiahle after one year and
"that should give us enough time to
determine if a different mix of pa
tients might change things with re
spect to our bid."
State law prohibits disclosure of
the amount of the hospital's bids for
Medi-Cal contracts, but according to
Ed Leibson, the state Medi-Cal of
ficer handling the University's case,
"We did not automatically award
contracts to the hospitals that sub
mitted the lowest bids."
"Stanford is generally a more ex
pensive hospital, but it also offers a
wide array of tertiary services. We
recognize that we must expect to pay
a higher rate per patient in order to
have those services available to
Medi-Cal patients," Leibson said.
The reason for the change in sys
tems lies in the state's inability to
keep up with rapidly intlating costs of
medical treatment.
"With the old system, the hospitals
could bill us for every little piece of
treatment they administered," leib
son said. "We hope this new system
will produce a different set of incen
tives for hospitals to keep their costs
down."
The decision on the contract was
expected |an. 1, but Leibson said that
negotiating activities which con
tinued during the month of January

prevented an earlier announcement.
"In the annals of government activ
ity, I would say our actions have been
lightning fast," Leibson said. He said
that 70 percent of the contract deci
sions throughout the state have al
ready been made.
The late announcement caused
some budgeting problems for the
Hospital. "Whether or not we would
be able to treat Medi-Cal patients
makes a big difference in the amount
of money we receive from the state.

We've had to formulate two budgets
so that we could be prepared for
either decision," Silverman said.
Other Peninsula hospitals
awarded contracts, according to the
state negotiator's office, are Sequoia
Hospital, Community Hospital of Los
Gatos, O'Connor Hospital of San
Jose, Santa Clara Valley Medical Cen
ter and Alexian Brothers Hospital in
San lose. Children's Hospital at Stan
ford is exempt from the Medi-Cal
negotiations.
