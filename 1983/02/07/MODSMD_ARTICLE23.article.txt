## Star center out for season? Card beats ASU, loses Revelli 
### STEVE ODELL Senior sports writer 
Stanford iced an 86-80 vic
tory over Arizona State with
some cool foul shooting down
the stretch in a Pacific-10 Con

ference basketball game at
Maples Pavilion Saturday af
ternoon.
Guard Keith Ramee led the
way at the line forthe Cardinal,
hitting on 11 of 14 free throws,
including nine of 11 in the final

2:08 to stave off numerous Sun
Devil charges.
Although the Cardinal won
the game, it may have lost
something far more important
in the process.
Center lohn Revelli, the

Cardinal's leading scorer and
rebounder, who had |ust come
back from a three-game ab
sence due to an ankle injury,
fell to the floor in pain with
10:50 remaining.
He later limped to the locker
room and the early diagnosis
was that he damaged ligaments
in his right knee. It the diag
nosis is correct, the injury will
require surgery that will prob
ably keep the six-toot-eight
lunior out of action for the re
mainder of the season.
"The news on lohn does not
look good," Stanford coach
Tom Davis admitted. "They
suspect ligament damage, and
if that is the case, some sort of
operation would be in order."
Basketball trainer Jim Liuk
konen did not sound overly
optimistic about Revelli's
chances. "He's probably torn
the medial collateral ligaments
in his right knee," he said.
But Liukkonen noted that
nothing will be known for fact
until Revelli undergoes an ar
throscopic examination of his
knee today or tomorrow to de
termine the extent of the in
jury.
Arizona State sliced Stan
ford's lead to two points four
times in the final four minutes,
but the Cardinal connected on
16 of its last free throw at
tempts to break a three-game
losing streak.
For the game, Stanford, now
11-7 overall and 3-5 in the con
ference, sunk a school-record
40 foul shots in a school-record
51 attempts. Arizona State,
which tell to 11-11 overall and
4-4 in the Pac-10, made just
eight of 13 attempts from the
line including just one point
from the foul stripe at halftime.
ASU scored 13 more field goal
in the game.
"He (Ramee) was incredible
coming down the stretch,"
Davis said. "He was calming
guvs down and really taking
charge. In the off-season, if he
works on his quickness and
strength, he's got a very fine
future ahead of him in the
Pac-10."


IN AND OUT: This first quarter jumper by
Stanford center John Revelli went in, but
there is an 80 to 90 percent chance that
Revelli will be out for the rest of the season.

Revelli suffered an injury to his right knee
during the second half of Saturday night's
victory over Arizona State and may need
surgery to correct torn ligaments.
Ramee, a freshman, came off
the bench and was fouled six
times in the final minutes. He
finished with 13 points.
"After the first two or three
(free throws) kind of rattled in,
I wanted the ball," Ramee said.
"I got my confidence up. I
knew if I got fouled I could put
them in. Luckily, it worked out
that way."
The best and worst came for
the Cardinal midway through
the second half.
Ironically, Stanford went on
a six-point spurt after Revelli's
departure and never trailed
again. The Cardinal assumed
the lead for good with 10:43
remaining when, trailing 51-50
after a Byron Scott 20-foot
jump shot, forward lohnny Ro
gers took matters into his own
hands.
Rogers hit a turnaround
jumper, guard Keith Jones took
Scott to the basket for a lay-in
on a one-on-one fastbreak,
and after an ASU turnover
against intense Cardinal
backcourt pressure, Rogers
went inside again for a tur
naround jump shot on a feed
from center Hans Wichery to
give the Card a 56-51 lead with

9:59 left.
Rogers, who led all Stanford
scorers with 17 points on seven
of nine field goal shooting, hit
his third straight rainbow after
a Chris Beasley bomb to keep
the five-point Cardinal lead in
tact.
All-America candidate Scott
led all scorers with 26 points
before fouling out with 1:37
left. Scott left the crowd in a
hush with a two-handed slam
dunk off a Beasley missed
lay-in with 8:21 left in the first
half.
"He's obviously a terrific
player," Davis said of Scott.
"They're just a fine, fine team. I
would not be surprised to see
them in a post-season tourna
ment."
"They really have three of
fensive forces with Scott, Beas
ley and then (Paul) Williams in
side. I would not be shocked if
they were the best team in the
league by March."
The Sun Devils were called
for 34 personal fouls in the
game while Stanford commit
ted just 19, an imbalance that
did not surprise Davis.
"That's our game, we like to
go inside," he said. "We are
not as good an outside shoot
ing team as Arizona State, so as
a result, we have to grind it out
more than a lot of teams."
The Cardinal also took ad
vantage of a lot of the little
things to come up with the big
win. Arizona State was called
for lane violations twice on
missed front ends of one
and-one opportunities. The
Cardinal then proceeded to
connect on both ends, both
times, to give them four for
gone points.
Another faux pas was com
mitted by ASU coach Bob
Weinhauer when he inserted

Kenny Vaughns into the game.
Vaughns, who was wearing a
No. 31 jersey, was not listed on
the official game roster, and as
a result, the Sun Devils were
whistled for a technical foul,
which Jones converted.
Stanford again most keenly
felt Revelli's absence on the
windows allowed them to get
off 36 more field goal attempts
than the Cardinal, but they
converted on only 49 percent
while Stanford hit home on a
sizzling 62.
The three conference wins
surpasses the total for the en
tire season last year when the
Cardinal went 2-16 in the Pac
-10, and the 11 victories is the
most overall since 1978-79.
The old record for foul shot
attempts was set in 1972 in a
game with Washington State
when Stanford went to the line
46times. The previous mark for
foul shots made was 40 versus
California in 1981.
