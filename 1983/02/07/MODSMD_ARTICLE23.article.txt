## Star center out for season? Card beats ASU, loses Revelli 
### STEVE ODELL Senior sports writer 
Stanford iced an 86-80 vic
tory over Arizona State with
some cool foul shooting down
the stretch in a Pacific-10 Con

ference basketball game at
Maples Pavilion Saturday af
ternoon.
Guard Keith Ramee led the
way at the line forthe Cardinal,
hitting on 11 of 14 free throws,
including nine of 11 in the final

2:08 to stave off numerous Sun
Devil charges.
Although the Cardinal won
the game, it may have lost
something far more important
in the process.
Center lohn Revelli, the

Cardinal's leading scorer and
rebounder, who had |ust come
back from a three-game ab
sence due to an ankle injury,
fell to the floor in pain with
10:50 remaining.
He later limped to the locker
room and the early diagnosis
was that he damaged ligaments
in his right knee. It the diag
nosis is correct, the injury will
require surgery that will prob
ably keep the six-toot-eight
lunior out of action for the re
mainder of the season.
"The news on lohn does not
look good," Stanford coach
Tom Davis admitted. "They
suspect ligament damage, and
if that is the case, some sort of
operation would be in order."
Basketball trainer Jim Liuk
konen did not sound overly
optimistic about Revelli's
chances. "He's probably torn
the medial collateral ligaments
in his right knee," he said.
But Liukkonen noted that
nothing will be known for fact
until Revelli undergoes an ar
throscopic examination of his
knee today or tomorrow to de
termine the extent of the in
jury.
Arizona State sliced Stan
ford's lead to two points four
times in the final four minutes,
but the Cardinal connected on
16 of its last free throw at
tempts to break a three-game
losing streak.
For the game, Stanford, now
11-7 overall and 3-5 in the con
ference, sunk a school-record
40 foul shots in a school-record
51 attempts. Arizona State,
which tell to 11-11 overall and
4-4 in the Pac-10, made just
eight of 13 attempts from the
line including just one point
from the foul stripe at halftime.
ASU scored 13 more field goal
in the game.
"He (Ramee) was incredible
coming down the stretch,"
Davis said. "He was calming
guvs down and really taking
charge. In the off-season, if he
works on his quickness and
strength, he's got a very fine
future ahead of him in the
Pac-10."


IN AND OUT: This first quarter jumper by
Stanford center John Revelli went in, but
there is an 80 to 90 percent chance that
Revelli will be out for the rest of the season.

Revelli suffered an injury to his right knee
during the second half of Saturday night's
victory over Arizona State and may need
surgery to correct torn ligaments.
