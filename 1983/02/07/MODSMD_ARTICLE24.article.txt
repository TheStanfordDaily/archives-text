# Swimmers drown No. 1 UCLA
## 
### SHAILENDRA BHUMRALKAR 
The men's swimming
team continued its spec
tacular roll this weekend.
On Friday, the Cardinal
knocked off the second No.
1 ranked team in as many
weeks by routing defending
NCAA champion UCLA
66-47.
On Saturday, Stanford
defeated rival (JSC by an
identical 66-47 tally. "To my
knowledge, it's the first
time Stanford has beaten
both UCLA and USC in the
same weekend," Head
Coach Skip Kenney said.
Before a partisan crowd at
DeCuerre pool, Stanford's
400 medley relay team once
again came through in the
opening race by winning in
a NCAA qualifying time of
3:20.86 and setting the tone
for the rest of the meet.
Card swimmers swept the
200 IM, with junior John Si
mons winning in 1:51.61.
Sophomore Jon Denney
won the 200 buterfly with
the second best time in the

country, a 1:48.49 clocking.
UCLA then crept back into
the meet by winning the 100
freestyle. In fact the Bruins
won every freestyle event in
the meet, but it was not
enough.
The Cardinal pulled away
for good by sweeping the
200 backstroke, with
sophomore Mike Conaton
winning in 1:51.65.
"We've always lost be
cause of the diving, but now
we have the strongest pro
gram on the West Coast,"
Kenney said. Diving was de
finitely the key on Friday.
With UCLA just three
points back, freshman Tom
Rothenbucher and
freshman Thor Johnson
placed 1-2 in the one meter
event to open up a comfort
able ten point lead for the
Cardinal. It was appropriate
that the divers clinched the
meet in the three meter
event, with Johnson win
ning and Rothenbucher
scoring second.
An overjoyed Kenney said

after the meet, "It's great to
beat the No. 1 team and de
fending champ." Kenney
was pleased to see such
strong support from the
stands. "The crowd and the
Dollies were worth points,"
he said.
Stanford had an easier
time on Saturday as an un
usually weak USC team vis
ited DeCuerre. Kenney
changed the lineup a bit to
give more people a chance
to swim.
There were a few stand
out events. Dave Bottom
won the 200 IM in 1:53.64.
Conaton won the 200
backstroke in 1:52.63.
Johnson made a weekend
sweep of the three meter
board by winning that event
as he did against UCLA.
The Cardinal will travel to
Berkeley in two weeks. Cal
should be ranked No. 1
then, so Stanford will be
aimingtoadd Cal toits listof
top-ranked teams that it has
beaten, a list that includes
Texas and UCLA.


DROWNING THE COMPETITION:
junior swimmer John Simons led the
Cardinal to victory in the 200 meter In
dividual Medley against USC, on Satur-

Rowland Burno/Dally
day, with a time of 1:51.61. The Cardinal
