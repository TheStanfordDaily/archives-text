# Miller, McGees massacre Cardinal
## 
### LIBBY LEONARD 
USC's sensational six-foot
two Cheryl Miller is the cham
pagne of women's basketball.
And when it's Miller time on
the court, most opponents get
swallowed up.
Friday night was no excep
tion. USC, under the influence
of Miller, left Stanford stagger
ing, 92-64, in front of 3376 fans
— a record crowd for the Lady
Card.
Stanford was not equipped
to handle the No. 2-ranked Tro
jans. USC outmatched the
Cardinal in every phase of the
game, including rebounds, as
sists, blocked shots and steals.
Stanford tried to shut down
the devastating inside game of
Miller and the six-foot-three
twins, Paula and Pam McGee.
The Card's tight zone defense
was effective for most of the
first half. USC had some trou
ble feeding the ball inside and
was kept off the offensive
board. Stanford led 15-10, and
19-14, behind the shooting of
senior Meg Metzger and
sophomore Mary Bradach.
But, USC scored five unan
swered driving layins to push
the Trojans ahead 26-22, with
7:53 left in the half. After climb
ing to within one at 29-28, the
Card was buried 12-2 in less
than four minutes. Paula
McCee was responsible for 10
of those points which dug the
Card's early grave and put USC
on top 51-38 at the break.
Cardinal coach Dotty
McCrea said her team got
scared after its lead vanished.
"We got a bit intimidated," she
said. "If you give USC a little
daylight, they'll blow you right
out of the game."
The Card opened the second
half in a man-to-man defense.
USC had too much speed,
however, and Stanford's
players were often caught a
few steps behind.

Stanford could not buy a
basket in the half's first three
minutes. Meanwhile, USC
knocked in 12 straight points to
lead 63-38 with 16:40 remain
ing. Miller and the McCees re
peatedly drove inside for easy
baskets. No single Card could
stop them, and Stanford sel
dom provided weakside help.
The Card could not shave the
Trojan lead which never dip
ped below 25 points down the
stretch. Cardinal reserves
Sarah Evans, Leigh Pederson
and Bradach played well in the

final minutes, but the game
had already been decided at
halftime.
This was USC's third con
secutive win over the Card; the
other two games were also
routs — 20 and 19-point wins.
The Cardinal has not defeated
the Trojans since 1979.
Stanford's WCAA record
slipped to 2-3, while the Tro
jans are now 5-1, losing only to
Long Beach State.
"I'm wondering how any
body beat them," McCrea said.
"No question USC deserves its
ranking."
What does it take to beat the
women of Troy? McCrea says
the Card "would have to play a
perfect game and USC would
have to make a lot of mistakes
for us to win."
Stanford's performance was
anything but flawless. Poor
shooting — 36 percent from
the field — and 15 turnovers
marred the Card. USC con
nected on 47 percent and had
just six turnovers.
USC's Miller was the crowd
favorite and finished with 19
points in 23 minutes of play.
However, the twin sister tan
dom actually led the point
producing Trojans with 45
markers. Paula McCee col
lected 24 points, 13 boards and
nine assists.
"Miller really compliments
the McCees," said McCrea.

"Everyone concentrates on
Cheryl and they (the twins)
quietly go about getting their
40 points and 20 rebounds."
Metzger topped Stanford's
suffering offense with 17.
Bradach sunk six of seven from
the floor and tallied 13 points.
Pederson chipped in eight
second-half points for the
Card.
Despite the loss, McCrea
was enthusiastic about the fan
support. "I just hope some of
these people will come back,"
she said. "I think it (the record
attendence) shows the poten
tial this game has."
On Saturday night, the Card
avenged a pre-season one
point loss to Fullerton State
and won, 80-68.
Stanford pressured Fuller
ton's guards, forcing several
costly turnovers. The Card also
took away Fullerton's strong
outside shooting game, which
had hurt Stanford before.
"Our man-to-man defensive
effort was the best of the year,"
McCrea said. "We played
every girl like she had already
given up her dribble."
Metzger paced Stanford with
22 points. Bradach had another
impressive game, scoring a
season-high 15. The six-foot
center has replaced senior Kim
Kupferer in the starting line up.
The Card will host San Diego
State next Saturday at 5:45 p.m.

IT'S MILLER TIME: Star attraction Cheryl
Miller puts up a shot over the reach of the
Card's Meg Metzger in USC's 92-84 victory
Friday night. Miller, who was swamped by

Greg Webb/Daily
admiring autograph-hounds after the game,
collected 19 points, 12 rebounds and three
blocked shots.
USC's sensational six-foot
two Cheryl Miller is the cham
pagne of women's basketball.
And when it's Miller time on
the court, most opponents get
swallowed up.
Friday night was no excep
tion. USC, under the influence
of Miller, left Stanford stagger
ing, 92-64, in front of 3376 fans
— a record crowd for the Lady
Card.
Stanford was not equipped
to handle the No. 2-ranked Tro
jans. USC outmatched the
Cardinal in every phase of the
game, including rebounds, as
sists, blocked shots and steals.
Stanford tried to shut down
the devastating inside game of
Miller and the six-foot-three
twins, Paula and Pam McGee.
The Card's tight zone defense
was effective for most of the
first half. USC had some trou
ble feeding the ball inside and
was kept off the offensive
board. Stanford led 15-10, and
19-14, behind the shooting of
senior Meg Metzger and
sophomore Mary Bradach.
But, USC scored five unan
swered driving layins to push
the Trojans ahead 26-22, with
7:53 left in the half. After climb
ing to within one at 29-28, the
Card was buried 12-2 in less
than four minutes. Paula
McCee was responsible for 10
of those points which dug the
Card's early grave and put USC
on top 51-38 at the break.
Cardinal coach Dotty
McCrea said her team got
scared after its lead vanished.
"We got a bit intimidated," she
said. "If you give USC a little
daylight, they'll blow you right
out of the game."
The Card opened the second
half in a man-to-man defense.
USC had too much speed,
however, and Stanford's
players were often caught a
few steps behind.

Stanford could not buy a
basket in the half's first three
minutes. Meanwhile, USC
knocked in 12 straight points to
lead 63-38 with 16:40 remain
ing. Miller and the McCees re
peatedly drove inside for easy
baskets. No single Card could
stop them, and Stanford sel
dom provided weakside help.
The Card could not shave the
Trojan lead which never dip
ped below 25 points down the
stretch. Cardinal reserves
Sarah Evans, Leigh Pederson
and Bradach played well in the

final minutes, but the game
had already been decided at
halftime.
This was USC's third con
secutive win over the Card; the
other two games were also
routs — 20 and 19-point wins.
The Cardinal has not defeated
the Trojans since 1979.
Stanford's WCAA record
slipped to 2-3, while the Tro
jans are now 5-1, losing only to
Long Beach State.
"I'm wondering how any
body beat them," McCrea said.
"No question USC deserves its
ranking."
What does it take to beat the
women of Troy? McCrea says
the Card "would have to play a
perfect game and USC would
have to make a lot of mistakes
for us to win."
Stanford's performance was
anything but flawless. Poor
shooting — 36 percent from
the field — and 15 turnovers
marred the Card. USC con
nected on 47 percent and had
just six turnovers.
USC's Miller was the crowd
favorite and finished with 19
points in 23 minutes of play.
However, the twin sister tan
dom actually led the point
producing Trojans with 45
markers. Paula McCee col
lected 24 points, 13 boards and
nine assists.
"Miller really compliments
the McCees," said McCrea.

"Everyone concentrates on
Cheryl and they (the twins)
quietly go about getting their
40 points and 20 rebounds."
Metzger topped Stanford's
suffering offense with 17.
Bradach sunk six of seven from
the floor and tallied 13 points.
