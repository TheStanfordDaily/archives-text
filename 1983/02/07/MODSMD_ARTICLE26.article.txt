# Card nine swept
## 
### 
Stanford's baseball team
spent a weekend at Cal-
State Fullerton they would
probably like to forget.
Fullerton swept the Car
dinal in their three-game
weekend series, winning by
scores of 9-5, 3-2 and 8-5.
Stanford dropped the first
game Friday night and, after
being rained out Saturday,
lost a pair yesterday.
Card junior Brian Myers
was the losing pitcher Friday
night in the 9-5 debacle
while Steve Cottrell was
pinned with the loss in the
first game yesterday.
In Sunday's opening con

test, Stanford drew first
blood, scoring a single run
in the top of the third. Ful
lerton came right back with
a tally of its own in the bot
tom half of the inning. The
Card was able to score only
once more, a one-run effort
in thesixth, despitefourFul
lerton errors.
In the second bill of yes
terday's doubleheader, Ful
lerton jumped to a 6-0 lead
before Stanford could
counter with three runs of
its own.
The Cardinal could only
muster seven hits in each
game yesterday.
