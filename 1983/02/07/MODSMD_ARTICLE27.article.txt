# Netters gain experience in LA

The Stanford men's tennis team was on its way
to defeating cross-bay rival UC-Berkeley and
led the Bears 4-2 Saturday in the National Team
Championships in Los Aneeles when a rain
storm forced the match and much of the tour
nament to be cancelled.
The rain cancelled play again yesterday and
both teams left Los Angeles without completing
the match.
The preseason tournament, sponsored by the
Intercollegiate Tennis Association, included
nine of the 10 top-ranked teams in the nation.
Tournament officials said that all matches
were cancelled yesterday due to rain but that if
the weather is acceptable today, the semi-final
match, which pits No. 4 UCLA against No. 1
Southern Methodist University, will be played
this morning. Pepperdine beat Texas in the
other semi-final match.
Last Thursday, No. 8 seed Stanford beat No. 10
Clemson soundly, 8-1, giving it the right to face
No. 2 Pepperdine. But the Wave was too much
for the Cardinal, who lost to Pepperdine in a
defeat that was not as close as the 5-4 score
indicates. Two of Stanford's wins were the result
of second set defaults by Pepperdine once the
Wave had clinched the match.
After sweeping the top four singles spots, the
Wave needed a victory injust one of the three
doubles matches to clinch the win. And once
Glen Michibata and Mike White downed Stan
ford's Dan Goldie and Jeremy Semple 6-1, 6-2,
Pepperdine forfeited the other two doubles
matches.
Nonetheless, Coach Dick Gould was pleased
with his freshman-dominated team's perfor
mance in Los Angeles. "It was a very good
weekend for a very young team," he said. "We
really have the potential to be a really good
team.
"I didn't see any team down there that we
can't beat (in the future) if the freshmen con
tinue to improve," Gould continued.

Michibata, ranked third among the collegiate
community, downed No. 2 rated Davis in singles
7-5,7-5. John Van Nostrand edged freshman Eric
Rosenfeld 6-4, 5-7, 6-3 while Rich Gallien beat
Goldie, another freshman, 6-1, 7-5.
At the No. 4 spot, Pepperdine's Kelly ]ones
defeated Card frosh John Letts 7-5, 6-4, in what
was a rematch of last year's National Junior
Championships, a title won by Letts in five sets.
Against Cal, Davis lost again, as he was still in
the throes of jetlag after playing Ivan Lendl last
week in Philadelphia in the National Pro Indoor
Championships. Davis was narrowly defeated
by Cal's Randy Nixon 7-6, 6-7,6-3 in a match that
included two tie-breakers. The Bears' Harold
Hecht beat Rosenfeld 3-6, 6-3, 6-0, although the
Card swept the final four singles matches.
To clinch the match against the seventh
seeded Bears, all the Cardinal needed to do was
to win one of the three doubles matches, none
of which were able to be played due to the rain.
This week's schedule includes two home
matches which both startat 1:30 p.m. Tomorrow
the Cardinal takes on San Diego State and on
Friday Stanford meets UC-lrvine.
