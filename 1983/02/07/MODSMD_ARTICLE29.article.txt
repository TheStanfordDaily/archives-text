# Cardinal to face Pac-10 doormat
## 
### STEVE ODELL Senior sports writer 
Arizona, invading Maples
Pavilion tonight for an 8
p.m. Pacific-10 basketball
clash with Stanford, is ad
ding new meaning to the
word inept.
The Wildcats are 3-15
overall, 0-9 on the road, and
0-8 in the Pac-10 following a
two-point loss at Cal Satur
day night.
But Stanford coach Tom
Davis thinks UA is better
than its record bespeaks.
"They're really struggl
ing," he said, "but I'm not
sure they should be. They
have one of the best JC
players in the country from
a year ago in Puntus Wilson,
and Frank Smith is a fine
player.
"I think it's a combination
of factors that are holding
them back and I would not
be surprised to see them
improve. There is still defi
nite hope for them this year.
Davis also realizes the
game takes on considerable
importance due to the fact it
is being televised as the
Pac-10's Monday Night

Came of the Week.
"There is no question that
this game takes on added
significance because of
television," he said. "The
circles are just that much
more wide. More and more
people will be exposed to
our program."
Smith is the Wildcats'
leading scorer, averaging
14.2 points and 8.5 re
bounds per game from his
center position. Stanford
center Hans Wichary will be
tested on defense as John
Revelli, the Cardinal's lead
ing scorer and rebounder,
will not play due to a knee
injury.
Davis has been pleased
with the way Wichary has
responded in the absence
of Revelli and Dave
Nussbaum, who will also
not play because of a bro
ken foot and is most likely
out of the season.
Wilson is a first team
junior College All-America
guard from Midland (Texas)
College, and is averaging
12.6 points a game. The
other UA starting guard is
sophomore Brunk Brun

khorse, who runs the of
fense.
The starters at torward for
the Wildcats are senior john
Belobraydic and another )C
transfer, Morgan Taylor.
The Cardinal will con
tinue to go with its recently
revamped starting line-up
whereby Steve Brown starts
at a small forward, giving
Stanford a three-guard look
and improving its quickness
on the fullcourt press.
Ricky Lewis is also a rela
tive newcomer to the start
ing five and has not commit
ted a turnover in the last two
games. Keith jones, the
second-leading Cardinal
scorer averaging 16.8 points
per game, will start at the
other guard. Earl Koberlein
will be the fifth starter at
forward.
Davis continues to re
ceive excellent play from his
bench. Cuard Keith Ramee
and forwards Johnny Rogers
and Andy Fischer all had ex
cellent games against
Arizona State and should
see just about as much play
ing time as the starters.
Arizona coach Ben

Lindsay is in his first year at
Tucson. He spent the previ
ous 16 years as head coach
at Grand Canyon College in
Phoenix, compiling a 317-
137 record in leading his
teams to two NAIA national
championships.
