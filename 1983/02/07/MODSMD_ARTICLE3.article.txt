Shultz arrives in South Korea
Seoul, South Korea — Secretary of State George
Shultz left Peking yesterday for a brief symbolic show
of support for South Korea, but on his way here he
made clear that his thoughts were still fully occupied
by his first meeting with China's leaders.
Conceding that the U.S.-China relationship con
tains serious policy differences as well as a decade-old
strategic balancing off against Moscow, Shultz told
reporters traveling with him that he was encouraged
by his four days of intensive talks in Peking.
Shultz said he was impressed by the willingness of
the Chinese leaders with whom he met to get down to
substantive issues right after the departure of cameras
and microphones for whose benetit trivial chit chat

was exchanged before meetings. And he was im
pressed that the Chinese havea genuinely global view
of the world.
State Department spokesman John Hughes said
that Shultz, during a 90-minute session late yesterday
with Korean Foreign Minister Lee Bum Suk, briefed
Lee on the Peking visit and reasserted the U.S. com
mitment to both South Korea and — a key analogy in
Asia — to Taiwan, within the limits imposed by recent
U.S. agreements with Peking limiting arms sales to the
Nationalist Chinese.
Shultz also assured Lee that the Reagan adminis
tration intends to press the U.S. Congress to restore
$70 million in militarv aid to South Korea
