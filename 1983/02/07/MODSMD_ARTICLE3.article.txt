Shultz arrives in South Korea
Seoul, South Korea — Secretary of State George
Shultz left Peking yesterday for a brief symbolic show
of support for South Korea, but on his way here he
made clear that his thoughts were still fully occupied
by his first meeting with China's leaders.
Conceding that the U.S.-China relationship con
tains serious policy differences as well as a decade-old
strategic balancing off against Moscow, Shultz told
reporters traveling with him that he was encouraged
by his four days of intensive talks in Peking.
Shultz said he was impressed by the willingness of
the Chinese leaders with whom he met to get down to
substantive issues right after the departure of cameras
and microphones for whose benetit trivial chit chat

was exchanged before meetings. And he was im
pressed that the Chinese havea genuinely global view
of the world.
State Department spokesman John Hughes said
that Shultz, during a 90-minute session late yesterday
with Korean Foreign Minister Lee Bum Suk, briefed
Lee on the Peking visit and reasserted the U.S. com
mitment to both South Korea and — a key analogy in
Asia — to Taiwan, within the limits imposed by recent
U.S. agreements with Peking limiting arms sales to the
Nationalist Chinese.
Shultz also assured Lee that the Reagan adminis
tration intends to press the U.S. Congress to restore
$70 million in militarv aid to South Korea
that was chopped from the foreign aid
budget in the lame-duck session last Decem
ber, thereby appropriating the full $210 million
sought bv the administration during fiscal 1983.
U.S. rejects Soviet draft
Washington — The Soviet Union proposed a
"draft treaty" last week at the Geneva nego
tiations on medium-range nuclear weapons in
Europe that was based on an offer announced
publicly last December by Soviet leader Yuri
Andropov, according to Reagan administration
officials.
It was quickly rejected by the United States,
according to one official, who said it contains
only the "bare essentials" of an agreement and
"makes no mention of verification."
The official said the U.S. delegation in Gene
va will concentrate its initial efforts in the next
few weeks on "discussing verification pro
cedures, definitions and data exchanges."
However, at the same time, a major behind
the-scenes bureaucratic argument is expected
about whether a U.S. counterproposal could
and should be hammered out here, accepted
by the NATO allies and approved by President
Reagan before national elections in West Ger
many on March 6.
An issue in those elections is NATO's plan to
deploy new U.S. Pershing II and cruise nuclear
missiles in western Europe beginning in De
cember if no agreement is reached with the So
viets.
The Soviets, this official said, have not come
up with a "serious response, because they are
not at all persuaded (that U.S.) deployment will
take place," given the situation in western Eu
rope.
At the State Department, at the Arms Control
and Disarmament Agency and in the U.S. nego
tiating team in Geneva, some officials believe a
modification now in the "zero option" ap
proach could defuse the missile issue as a key
factor in the West German elections.
They want to propose an interim agreement
on equal numbers of missiles on both sides at
"the lowest possible levels" before eventually
going to zero on both sides.
Burger wants new court
New Orleans — Chief Justice Warren Burger
yesterday proposed a new appeals court to tem
porarily ease the burden of the Supreme Court,
which he says is so overworked that a break
down of the system — or its justices — is threat
ened.
The new court, Burger said, could last for five
years and handle up to one-third of the approx
imately 150 cases now given a full Supreme
Court hearing. It could be made up of federal
appeals court judges, he said.
The chief justice has expressed concern
before over the Supreme Court's workload, but
this was the first time he has endorsed a tem
porary specific solution.
"Only fundamental changes ... will avoid a
breakdown of the system — or of some of the

justices," Burger said in a speech prepared for
the mid-winter convention of the American Bar
Association.
Burger, who at age 75 is one of five of the
court's nine members over 70, said the mount
ing caseload since he became chief justice in
1969 "has become almost a tidal wave."
He said justices work an average 60-hour
week and that their three-month summer re
cess is no vacation because they must read hun
dreds of legal briefs to prepare for the fall ses
sion.
Beirut battle continues anew
Beirut — Christian and Druse militiamen bat
tled with grenades, artillery and rockets during
a blizzard in Lebanon's central mountains yes
terday, killing at least five people and setting
several houses afire, police said.
A few stray rounds of small-arms bullets
landed near U.S. Marine peacekeepers
deployed in the Beirut airport area, but caused
no injuries. But an Italian member of the multi
national force had a leg amputated Saturday af
ter a cluster bomb he thought was inert ex
ploded while he was taking it to demolition ex
perts, an Italian spokesman said.
In other developments, the death toll
climbed to 22 in the bombing of a PLO building
in Beirut.
Police said renewed Christian-Druse battles
flared during heavy snowfall in the central
mountain towns of Aley, Souk el-Gharb and
Aitat, about eight miles southeast of Beirut.
The Christian Phalange Party, political arm of
the militia which cooperated with Israel's in
vasion army against the Palestine Liberation Or
ganization last summer, accused Israel for the
first time publicly of supporting the Phalangists'
Druse opponents.
The Progressive Socialist Party militia of Leba
non's top leftist leader, Walid Jumbiatt, is the
bulwark of the nation's 200,000-strong popu
lation of Druse, a breakaway Islamic sect. The
Socialists sided with the PLO in last summer's
war.
U.S. need not apologize
Jerusalem — The Israeli Cabinet voted yester
day not to demand a formal apology from the
United States over last week's confrontation in
Beirut, Lebanon, between a U.S. Marine captain
and an Israeli tank patrol.
"Governments don't go very fast in apologiz
ing," a Cabinet source told reporters after the
regular weekly meeting. The source, who asked
not to be identified, said that Israel wanted to
put an end to the recrimination between Wash
ington and Jerusalem that resulted from the in
cident.
However, neither the Cabinet source nor
other officials could quite let go of the con
troversy.
The source said that some officials in Wash
ington "played it up almost to the dimensions
of belligerent forces fighting each other." He
that said Secretary of Defense Caspar Wein
berger was one of those officials, although
"he's not the only one."

Archbishop protests bombing
San Salvador — The acting archbishop of El
Salvador declared from his pulpit yesterday that
"indiscriminate bombing" caused many of the
258 civilian deaths that occurred in fighting last
week.
In his weekly sermon, Msgr. Arturo Rivera y
Damas also called on both sides in the civil war
raging across this tiny central American nation
to declare truce during the visit of Pope John
Paul II early next month.
"At the bottom of it all is social injustice," the
acting archbishop told the standing room only
crowd in the Metropolitan Cathedral. His ser
mon was also broadcast on nationwide radio.
The archbishop's reference to "in
discriminate bombing" is likely to heighten a
debate over the killing of civilians during an
aerial attack around the rebel-held town of Ber
lin last week.
Civilians who remained in Berlin told re
porters Thursday, after it had been recaptured
by the armed forces, that the city had been at
tacked by airplanes and helicopters. Although
they used the word "bombed," the pattern of
destruction and lack of bomb craters indicated
that rocket attacks had been more likely, at least
in the city itself.
Officially, the military command has made no
comment, but Col. Jaime Flores, the com
mander of the armed forces in the area, denied
that the city had been bombed. A Western mili
tary source told reporters that it was probable
that some sort of aerial attack took place.
Three U.S. advisers relieved
San Salvador — Three U.S. military advisers
have been relieved of their duties for partici
pating in a combat operation in which another
adviser, Staff Sgt. Jay Stanley of Towson, Md.,
was wounded Wednesday, according to a
statement issued Saturday by the U.S. Embassy
here.
The incident comes as the pace of El
Salvador's civil war is stepping up dramatically
and a series of apparent rebel successes have
raised questions here and in Washington about
the extent to which the Salvadoran army is will
ing or able to make this fight on its own.
The Reagan administration is asking for an in
crease in military aid from $26.3 million to $86.3
million in fiscal 1983 to make sure the forces it
backs here are adequately supplied.
Although embassy officials remain cryptic
about the exact circumstances of Stanley's
wounding on Wednesday, and Saturday re
versed some of their earlier statements on the
case, such information as has been made avail
able about the incident suggests that at least
some U.S. advisers here come a great deal
closer to active combat than the Reagan admin
istration or the embassy had previously ac
knowledged.
Today's weather
Increasing clouds bring chance of rain. Tem
peratures with highs in the upper 50s to lower
60s. Lows expected from mid-30s through the
40s.

Burger wants new court
New Orleans — Chief Justice Warren Burger
yesterday proposed a new appeals court to tem
porarily ease the burden of the Supreme Court,
which he says is so overworked that a break
down of the system — or its justices — is threat
ened.
The new court, Burger said, could last for five
years and handle up to one-third of the approx
imately 150 cases now given a full Supreme
Court hearing. It could be made up of federal
appeals court judges, he said.
The chief justice has expressed concern
before over the Supreme Court's workload, but
this was the first time he has endorsed a tem
porary specific solution.
"Only fundamental changes ... will avoid a
breakdown of the system — or of some of the

justices," Burger said in a speech prepared for
the mid-winter convention of the American Bar
Association.
Burger, who at age 75 is one of five of the
court's nine members over 70, said the mount
ing caseload since he became chief justice in
1969 "has become almost a tidal wave."
He said justices work an average 60-hour
week and that their three-month summer re
cess is no vacation because they must read hun
dreds of legal briefs to prepare for the fall ses
sion.
Beirut battle continues anew
Beirut — Christian and Druse militiamen bat
tled with grenades, artillery and rockets during
a blizzard in Lebanon's central mountains yes
terday, killing at least five people and setting
several houses afire, police said.
A few stray rounds of small-arms bullets
landed near U.S. Marine peacekeepers
deployed in the Beirut airport area, but caused
no injuries. But an Italian member of the multi
national force had a leg amputated Saturday af
ter a cluster bomb he thought was inert ex
ploded while he was taking it to demolition ex
perts, an Italian spokesman said.
In other developments, the death toll
climbed to 22 in the bombing of a PLO building
in Beirut.
Police said renewed Christian-Druse battles
flared during heavy snowfall in the central
mountain towns of Aley, Souk el-Gharb and
Aitat, about eight miles southeast of Beirut.
The Christian Phalange Party, political arm of
the militia which cooperated with Israel's in
vasion army against the Palestine Liberation Or
ganization last summer, accused Israel for the
first time publicly of supporting the Phalangists'
Druse opponents.
The Progressive Socialist Party militia of Leba
non's top leftist leader, Walid Jumbiatt, is the
bulwark of the nation's 200,000-strong popu
lation of Druse, a breakaway Islamic sect. The
Socialists sided with the PLO in last summer's
war.
U.S. need not apologize
Jerusalem — The Israeli Cabinet voted yester
day not to demand a formal apology from the
United States over last week's confrontation in
Beirut, Lebanon, between a U.S. Marine captain
and an Israeli tank patrol.
"Governments don't go very fast in apologiz
ing," a Cabinet source told reporters after the
regular weekly meeting. The source, who asked
not to be identified, said that Israel wanted to
put an end to the recrimination between Wash
ington and Jerusalem that resulted from the in
cident.
However, neither the Cabinet source nor
other officials could quite let go of the con
troversy.
The source said that some officials in Wash
ington "played it up almost to the dimensions
of belligerent forces fighting each other." He
that said Secretary of Defense Caspar Wein
berger was one of those officials, although
"he's not the only one."

Archbishop protests bombing
San Salvador — The acting archbishop of El
Salvador declared from his pulpit yesterday that
"indiscriminate bombing" caused many of the
258 civilian deaths that occurred in fighting last
week.
In his weekly sermon, Msgr. Arturo Rivera y
Damas also called on both sides in the civil war
raging across this tiny central American nation
to declare truce during the visit of Pope John
Paul II early next month.
"At the bottom of it all is social injustice," the
acting archbishop told the standing room only
crowd in the Metropolitan Cathedral. His ser
mon was also broadcast on nationwide radio.
The archbishop's reference to "in
discriminate bombing" is likely to heighten a
debate over the killing of civilians during an
aerial attack around the rebel-held town of Ber
lin last week.
Civilians who remained in Berlin told re
porters Thursday, after it had been recaptured
by the armed forces, that the city had been at
tacked by airplanes and helicopters. Although
they used the word "bombed," the pattern of
destruction and lack of bomb craters indicated
that rocket attacks had been more likely, at least
in the city itself.
Officially, the military command has made no
comment, but Col. Jaime Flores, the com
mander of the armed forces in the area, denied
that the city had been bombed. A Western mili
tary source told reporters that it was probable
that some sort of aerial attack took place.
Three U.S. advisers relieved
San Salvador — Three U.S. military advisers
have been relieved of their duties for partici
pating in a combat operation in which another
adviser, Staff Sgt. Jay Stanley of Towson, Md.,
was wounded Wednesday, according to a
statement issued Saturday by the U.S. Embassy
here.
The incident comes as the pace of El
Salvador's civil war is stepping up dramatically
and a series of apparent rebel successes have
raised questions here and in Washington about
the extent to which the Salvadoran army is will
ing or able to make this fight on its own.
The Reagan administration is asking for an in
crease in military aid from $26.3 million to $86.3
million in fiscal 1983 to make sure the forces it
backs here are adequately supplied.
Although embassy officials remain cryptic
about the exact circumstances of Stanley's
wounding on Wednesday, and Saturday re
versed some of their earlier statements on the
case, such information as has been made avail
able about the incident suggests that at least
some U.S. advisers here come a great deal
closer to active combat than the Reagan admin
istration or the embassy had previously ac
knowledged.
Today's weather
Increasing clouds bring chance of rain. Tem

Shultz arrives in South Korea
Seoul, South Korea — Secretary of State George
Shultz left Peking yesterday for a brief symbolic show
of support for South Korea, but on his way here he
made clear that his thoughts were still fully occupied
by his first meeting with China's leaders.
Conceding that the U.S.-China relationship con
tains serious policy differences as well as a decade-old
strategic balancing off against Moscow, Shultz told
reporters traveling with him that he was encouraged
by his four days of intensive talks in Peking.
Shultz said he was impressed by the willingness of
the Chinese leaders with whom he met to get down to
substantive issues right after the departure of cameras
and microphones for whose benetit trivial chit chat

was exchanged before meetings. And he was im
pressed that the Chinese havea genuinely global view
of the world.
State Department spokesman John Hughes said
that Shultz, during a 90-minute session late yesterday
with Korean Foreign Minister Lee Bum Suk, briefed
Lee on the Peking visit and reasserted the U.S. com
mitment to both South Korea and — a key analogy in
Asia — to Taiwan, within the limits imposed by recent
U.S. agreements with Peking limiting arms sales to the
Nationalist Chinese.
Shultz also assured Lee that the Reagan adminis
tration intends to press the U.S. Congress to restore
$70 million in militarv aid to South Korea
that was chopped from the foreign aid
budget in the lame-duck session last Decem
ber, thereby appropriating the full $210 million
sought bv the administration during fiscal 1983.
U.S. rejects Soviet draft
Washington — The Soviet Union proposed a
"draft treaty" last week at the Geneva nego
tiations on medium-range nuclear weapons in
Europe that was based on an offer announced
publicly last December by Soviet leader Yuri
Andropov, according to Reagan administration
officials.
It was quickly rejected by the United States,
according to one official, who said it contains
only the "bare essentials" of an agreement and
"makes no mention of verification."
The official said the U.S. delegation in Gene
va will concentrate its initial efforts in the next
few weeks on "discussing verification pro
cedures, definitions and data exchanges."
However, at the same time, a major behind
the-scenes bureaucratic argument is expected
about whether a U.S. counterproposal could
and should be hammered out here, accepted
by the NATO allies and approved by President
Reagan before national elections in West Ger
many on March 6.
An issue in those elections is NATO's plan to
deploy new U.S. Pershing II and cruise nuclear
missiles in western Europe beginning in De
cember if no agreement is reached with the So
viets.
The Soviets, this official said, have not come
up with a "serious response, because they are
not at all persuaded (that U.S.) deployment will
take place," given the situation in western Eu
rope.
At the State Department, at the Arms Control
and Disarmament Agency and in the U.S. nego

U.S. need not apologize
Jerusalem — The Israeli Cabinet voted yester
day not to demand a formal apology from the
United States over last week's confrontation in
Beirut, Lebanon, between a U.S. Marine captain
and an Israeli tank patrol.
"Governments don't go very fast in apologiz
ing," a Cabinet source told reporters after the
regular weekly meeting. The source, who asked
not to be identified, said that Israel wanted to
put an end to the recrimination between Wash
ington and Jerusalem that resulted from the in
cident.
However, neither the Cabinet source nor
other officials could quite let go of the con
troversy.
The source said that some officials in Wash
ington "played it up almost to the dimensions
of belligerent forces fighting each other." He
that said Secretary of Defense Caspar Wein
berger was one of those officials, although
"he's not the only one."

Archbishop protests bombing
San Salvador — The acting archbishop of El
Salvador declared from his pulpit yesterday that
"indiscriminate bombing" caused many of the
258 civilian deaths that occurred in fighting last
week.
In his weekly sermon, Msgr. Arturo Rivera y
Damas also called on both sides in the civil war
raging across this tiny central American nation
to declare truce during the visit of Pope John
Paul II early next month.
"At the bottom of it all is social injustice," the
acting archbishop told the standing room only
crowd in the Metropolitan Cathedral. His ser
mon was also broadcast on nationwide radio.
The archbishop's reference to "in
discriminate bombing" is likely to heighten a
debate over the killing of civilians during an
aerial attack around the rebel-held town of Ber
lin last week.
Civilians who remained in Berlin told re
porters Thursday, after it had been recaptured
by the armed forces, that the city had been at
tacked by airplanes and helicopters. Although
they used the word "bombed," the pattern of
destruction and lack of bomb craters indicated
that rocket attacks had been more likely, at least
in the city itself.
Officially, the military command has made no
comment, but Col. Jaime Flores, the com
mander of the armed forces in the area, denied
that the city had been bombed. A Western mili
tary source told reporters that it was probable
that some sort of aerial attack took place.
Three U.S. advisers relieved
San Salvador — Three U.S. military advisers
have been relieved of their duties for partici
pating in a combat operation in which another
adviser, Staff Sgt. Jay Stanley of Towson, Md.,
was wounded Wednesday, according to a
statement issued Saturday by the U.S. Embassy
here.
The incident comes as the pace of El
Salvador's civil war is stepping up dramatically
and a series of apparent rebel successes have
raised questions here and in Washington about
the extent to which the Salvadoran army is will
ing or able to make this fight on its own.
The Reagan administration is asking for an in
crease in military aid from $26.3 million to $86.3
million in fiscal 1983 to make sure the forces it
backs here are adequately supplied.
Although embassy officials remain cryptic
about the exact circumstances of Stanley's
wounding on Wednesday, and Saturday re
versed some of their earlier statements on the
case, such information as has been made avail
able about the incident suggests that at least
some U.S. advisers here come a great deal
closer to active combat than the Reagan admin
istration or the embassy had previously ac
knowledged.

Shultz arrives in South Korea
Seoul, South Korea — Secretary of State George
Shultz left Peking yesterday for a brief symbolic show
of support for South Korea, but on his way here he
made clear that his thoughts were still fully occupied
by his first meeting with China's leaders.
Conceding that the U.S.-China relationship con
tains serious policy differences as well as a decade-old
strategic balancing off against Moscow, Shultz told
reporters traveling with him that he was encouraged
by his four days of intensive talks in Peking.
Shultz said he was impressed by the willingness of
the Chinese leaders with whom he met to get down to
substantive issues right after the departure of cameras
and microphones for whose benetit trivial chit chat

was exchanged before meetings. And he was im
pressed that the Chinese havea genuinely global view
of the world.
State Department spokesman John Hughes said
that Shultz, during a 90-minute session late yesterday
with Korean Foreign Minister Lee Bum Suk, briefed
Lee on the Peking visit and reasserted the U.S. com
mitment to both South Korea and — a key analogy in
Asia — to Taiwan, within the limits imposed by recent
U.S. agreements with Peking limiting arms sales to the
Nationalist Chinese.
Shultz also assured Lee that the Reagan adminis
tration intends to press the U.S. Congress to restore
$70 million in militarv aid to South Korea
that was chopped from the foreign aid
budget in the lame-duck session last Decem
ber, thereby appropriating the full $210 million
sought bv the administration during fiscal 1983.
U.S. rejects Soviet draft
Washington — The Soviet Union proposed a
"draft treaty" last week at the Geneva nego
tiations on medium-range nuclear weapons in
Europe that was based on an offer announced
publicly last December by Soviet leader Yuri
Andropov, according to Reagan administration
officials.
It was quickly rejected by the United States,
according to one official, who said it contains
only the "bare essentials" of an agreement and
"makes no mention of verification."
The official said the U.S. delegation in Gene
va will concentrate its initial efforts in the next
few weeks on "discussing verification pro
cedures, definitions and data exchanges."
However, at the same time, a major behind
the-scenes bureaucratic argument is expected
about whether a U.S. counterproposal could
and should be hammered out here, accepted
by the NATO allies and approved by President
Reagan before national elections in West Ger
many on March 6.
An issue in those elections is NATO's plan to
deploy new U.S. Pershing II and cruise nuclear
missiles in western Europe beginning in De
cember if no agreement is reached with the So
viets.
The Soviets, this official said, have not come
up with a "serious response, because they are
not at all persuaded (that U.S.) deployment will
take place," given the situation in western Eu
rope.
At the State Department, at the Arms Control
and Disarmament Agency and in the U.S. nego
tiating team in Geneva, some officials believe a
modification now in the "zero option" ap
proach could defuse the missile issue as a key
factor in the West German elections.
They want to propose an interim agreement
on equal numbers of missiles on both sides at
"the lowest possible levels" before eventually
going to zero on both sides.
Burger wants new court
New Orleans — Chief Justice Warren Burger
yesterday proposed a new appeals court to tem
porarily ease the burden of the Supreme Court,
which he says is so overworked that a break
down of the system — or its justices — is threat
ened.
The new court, Burger said, could last for five
years and handle up to one-third of the approx
imately 150 cases now given a full Supreme
Court hearing. It could be made up of federal
appeals court judges, he said.
The chief justice has expressed concern
before over the Supreme Court's workload, but
this was the first time he has endorsed a tem
porary specific solution.
"Only fundamental changes ... will avoid a
breakdown of the system — or of some of the

justices," Burger said in a speech prepared for
the mid-winter convention of the American Bar
Association.
Burger, who at age 75 is one of five of the
court's nine members over 70, said the mount
ing caseload since he became chief justice in
1969 "has become almost a tidal wave."
He said justices work an average 60-hour
week and that their three-month summer re
cess is no vacation because they must read hun
dreds of legal briefs to prepare for the fall ses
sion.
Beirut battle continues anew
Beirut — Christian and Druse militiamen bat
tled with grenades, artillery and rockets during
a blizzard in Lebanon's central mountains yes
terday, killing at least five people and setting
several houses afire, police said.
A few stray rounds of small-arms bullets
landed near U.S. Marine peacekeepers
deployed in the Beirut airport area, but caused
no injuries. But an Italian member of the multi
national force had a leg amputated Saturday af
ter a cluster bomb he thought was inert ex
ploded while he was taking it to demolition ex
perts, an Italian spokesman said.
In other developments, the death toll
climbed to 22 in the bombing of a PLO building
in Beirut.
Police said renewed Christian-Druse battles
flared during heavy snowfall in the central
mountain towns of Aley, Souk el-Gharb and
Aitat, about eight miles southeast of Beirut.
The Christian Phalange Party, political arm of
the militia which cooperated with Israel's in
vasion army against the Palestine Liberation Or
ganization last summer, accused Israel for the
first time publicly of supporting the Phalangists'
Druse opponents.
The Progressive Socialist Party militia of Leba
non's top leftist leader, Walid Jumbiatt, is the
bulwark of the nation's 200,000-strong popu
lation of Druse, a breakaway Islamic sect. The
Socialists sided with the PLO in last summer's
