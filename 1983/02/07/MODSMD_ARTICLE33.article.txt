Kite flies to Crosby win
Pebble Beach, Calif. — Tom Kite
struggled to a final round 1-over-par
73 yesterday, yet held on in the rain
and wind to post a two-stroke victory
in the 42nd Bing Crosby National
Pro-Am.
Kite, so frequently a challenger
and so rarely a winner, captured the
fifth title of his 12-year PGA Tour ca
reer with a 12-under-par total of 276.
Rex Caldwell and Cal Peete tied
for second at 278. It was Caldwell's
third second place finish in as many
weeks, a period during which he has
won $95,233.
The victory was worth $58,500
from the total purse of $325,000.
Meanwhile, Jack Nicklaus, who

birdied four of his last five holes for a
72 and a 280 total, finished sixth and
won $11,700. That made him the first
man to go past $4 million in career
winnings.
Tom Watson, who beat Nicklaus
for the U.S. Open title on this course
six months ago, had a 69, the best
round of the day, and was at 281.
McEnroe beats Lendl
Philadelphia — Top-seeded John
McEnroe snapped a string of seven
straight losses to Czechoslovakia's

prize with a 4-6, 7-6, 6-4, 6-3 victory
in the final of the week-long,
$375,000 tournament.
McEnroe, who started slowly and
continuously berated himself with
vocal and physical gestures of dis
gust, came on with a net-attacking
strategy that confused the baseline
playing Lendl, the N0.2 seed and vic
tor over Stanford's Scott Davis
Wednesday night.
