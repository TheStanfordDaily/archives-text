# Ex-dean reflects on student trends
## 
### KIMBERLY BROWN Senior staff writer 
The golden era syndrome will un
doubtedly strike us .ill one day. It
hung heavy in the air, along with a
generous sprinkling ot talcum pow
der, at Sunday's gathering of the
Stanford Historical Society.
Rixford Snyder, emeritus profes
sor of history and dean of admissions
from 1950 to 1969, spoke on the
changing profiles of the student
body in terms of both student life
and demographic trends.
According to Snyder, "The close
community spirit and warmth has
been absent during the last 40 years.
The freshmen come eager to partici
pate but later blend into attitudes of
indifference."
Nonetheless, he said, "students
still seem to think that the University
is great and perhaps that is the im
portant thing — regardless of how
they go about showing it."
Illustrating how "it was a simpler,
more innocent way of life" back
then, the former dean of admissions
recounted various class activities and
pranks which have gone down in his
tory.
Apparently, the Class of '17 char
tered two Southern Pacific railway
cars for their senior ball. The railway
lines extended as far as the
Bookstore then, and the seniors
were able to board somewhere in the
vicinity of today's Claw. The revelers
rode the train to San Jose, where they
disembarked for the ball itself.
"Today, no senior class would
unite to go anywhere for anything —
much less to a senior ball. They are
much too interested in doing their
own thing or in doing things in small
groups," Snyder said.
Apparently, Snyder had not been
informed of the Senior Casino Night
last Friday. Casino Night was sold out
a full week in advance. But no seniors
were reported to have taken the train
to the event.
Snyder said, "1926 was an era
when football and prohibition were
the most important things." Snyder
told of students swarming down
Mayfield Avenue, singing "Come
loin the Band" on their way to the Big
Game Gaieties.
"Today students do not even know
the words, much less the tune," he
said.
Stanford won the Big Game 49-0
that year, Snyder said.
Snyder, also a demographics ex
pert, explained Stanford's evolution
from its initial state as a primarily re
gional institution to its present status

as one of the most prestigious uni
versities in the nation.
At the time of its opening day in
1891, one-third of the University's
student population came from
southern California, Snyder said
He said this phenomenon was the
result of two factors — location in
what was then the state's most
populated and urban area, plus its
being a "private university."
By sending their offspring up north
to Stanford, parents could say they
"had a child away at school," Snyder
quipped.
By the 1930s and President Wallace
Sterling, the national brain-drain to
Stanford was well under way.
"Nearly two-thirds of the entering
students came from states other
than California," Snyder said.
He also commented upon the
overall effect of the increasing
graduate student population on un
dergraduates. "The graduate student
population has changed the charac
ter of undergraduates," he said.
"Since the early '50s, our freshmen
have develped more sohisticated
and serious attitudes."
Another major difference between
the University today and in its early
days is the ratio of men to women in
each entering class. Leland Stan
ford's founding grant was intended
"to afford equal facilities and award
equal opportunities to both sexes."
But only 23 percent of the
freshman class of 1891 was female,
Snyder said. In contrast, the entering
class of 1981 was 58 percent male and
42 percent female, he said.
This equality has not been attained
without some effort, however. Even
lane Stanford, Leleand's wife, was
hesitant to admit women to the Uni
versity, Snyder said. Apparently, she
was so obsessed with the idea of
creating a memorial for her son, Le
land Stanford Jr., that she hindered
the admission of women for a
number of years following the death
of her husband.
Also encouraging is the number of
students managing to graduate at all,
Snyder said. In 1921 only 53 percent
of the entering freshmen managed to
graduate, whereas 96 percent
graduated in 1981.
Snyder attributed this significant
improvement in academic survival to
three factors. Better academic cre
dentials of entering classes, in
creases in financial aid and the im
portant of degrees for future careers
have all contributed to today's al
most guaranteed rate of academic
success, Snyder said.

Snyder said. In contrast, the entering
class of 1981 was 58 percent male and
42 percent female, he said.
This equality has not been attained
without some effort, however. Even
lane Stanford, Leleand's wife, was
hesitant to admit women to the Uni
versity, Snyder said. Apparently, she
was so obsessed with the idea of
creating a memorial for her son, Le
land Stanford Jr., that she hindered
the admission of women for a
number of years following the death
of her husband.
Also encouraging is the number of
students managing to graduate at all,
Snyder said. In 1921 only 53 percent
of the entering freshmen managed to
graduate, whereas 96 percent
graduated in 1981.
Snyder attributed this significant
improvement in academic survival to
three factors. Better academic cre
dentials of entering classes, in
creases in financial aid and the im
portant of degrees for future careers
have all contributed to today's al
most guaranteed rate of academic
success, Snyder said.
The golden era syndrome will un
doubtedly strike us .ill one day. It
hung heavy in the air, along with a
generous sprinkling ot talcum pow
der, at Sunday's gathering of the
Stanford Historical Society.
Rixford Snyder, emeritus profes
sor of history and dean of admissions
from 1950 to 1969, spoke on the
changing profiles of the student
body in terms of both student life
and demographic trends.
According to Snyder, "The close
community spirit and warmth has
been absent during the last 40 years.
The freshmen come eager to partici
pate but later blend into attitudes of
indifference."
Nonetheless, he said, "students
still seem to think that the University
is great and perhaps that is the im
portant thing — regardless of how
they go about showing it."
Illustrating how "it was a simpler,
more innocent way of life" back
then, the former dean of admissions
recounted various class activities and
pranks which have gone down in his
tory.
Apparently, the Class of '17 char
tered two Southern Pacific railway
cars for their senior ball. The railway
lines extended as far as the
Bookstore then, and the seniors
were able to board somewhere in the
vicinity of today's Claw. The revelers
rode the train to San Jose, where they
disembarked for the ball itself.
"Today, no senior class would
unite to go anywhere for anything —
much less to a senior ball. They are
much too interested in doing their
own thing or in doing things in small
groups," Snyder said.
Apparently, Snyder had not been
informed of the Senior Casino Night
last Friday. Casino Night was sold out
a full week in advance. But no seniors
were reported to have taken the train
to the event.
Snyder said, "1926 was an era
when football and prohibition were
the most important things." Snyder
told of students swarming down
Mayfield Avenue, singing "Come
loin the Band" on their way to the Big
Game Gaieties.
"Today students do not even know
the words, much less the tune," he
said.
Stanford won the Big Game 49-0
that year, Snyder said.
Snyder, also a demographics ex
pert, explained Stanford's evolution
from its initial state as a primarily re
gional institution to its present status

as one of the most prestigious uni
versities in the nation.
At the time of its opening day in
1891, one-third of the University's
student population came from
southern California, Snyder said
He said this phenomenon was the
result of two factors — location in
what was then the state's most
populated and urban area, plus its
being a "private university."
By sending their offspring up north
to Stanford, parents could say they
"had a child away at school," Snyder
quipped.
By the 1930s and President Wallace
Sterling, the national brain-drain to
Stanford was well under way.
"Nearly two-thirds of the entering
students came from states other
than California," Snyder said.
He also commented upon the
overall effect of the increasing
graduate student population on un
dergraduates. "The graduate student
population has changed the charac
ter of undergraduates," he said.
"Since the early '50s, our freshmen
have develped more sohisticated
and serious attitudes."
Another major difference between
the University today and in its early
days is the ratio of men to women in
each entering class. Leland Stan
ford's founding grant was intended
"to afford equal facilities and award
equal opportunities to both sexes."
But only 23 percent of the
freshman class of 1891 was female,
Snyder said. In contrast, the entering
class of 1981 was 58 percent male and
42 percent female, he said.
This equality has not been attained
without some effort, however. Even
lane Stanford, Leleand's wife, was
hesitant to admit women to the Uni
versity, Snyder said. Apparently, she
