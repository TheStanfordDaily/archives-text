Students, alumni and a potential professor here are
involved on both sides of East Palo Alto's incorporation
question, which may beanswered |une7 when residents
vote for or against cityhood.
As many as 20students here have been "involved on a
daily basis" helping educate East Palo Alto peopleabout
incorporation, according to Keith Archuleta, a business
student and the program coordinator of Tresidder Un
ion. Omowale Satterwhite, the president of the Com
munity Development Institute, a primarygroup working
for incorporation, is a Stanford graduate. And former
Rep. Paul "Pete" McCloskey, who may be approved by
the ASSU Senate as a guest professor here this spring,
was hired by a group of landowners who oppose incor
poration two weeks ago.
At least eight of the 20-25 members of the East Palo
Alto Citizens Committee for Incorporation (EPACCI), a
group which meets weekly to plan the cityhood battle,
are related to the University in some way. The Black
Student Union (BSU), the Native American Indian Or
ganization, the Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de
Atzlan, the Stanford Progressive Alliance, the Chicano
Graduate Student Organization, the Asian Student As
sociation and the African Student Association all have
endorsed incorporation, according to Pete Escobedo,
organizer of the Concerned Student Coalition.
The San Mateo County Local Agency Formation
Commission (LAFCO) twoweeksagoclearedthewayfor
the cityhood vote this June. It also said last week that the
ballot for the vote will only contain one measure, incor
poration. The San Mateo County Board of Supervisors is
expected to approve the ballot constraints at a hearing
later this month, according to Ruben Abrica, a member
of the East Palo Alto Municipal Council.
The most recent incorporation vote, which took place
last April, aroused controversy because four measures
appeared on the ballot and many voters confused the
measures. Incorporation lost by only 41 votes.

Students involved in the incorporation struggle are
trying to make sure that incorporation is not rejected in
the June vote. Besides offering members for EPACCI,
the student groups are canvassing the community pro
viding information and trying to raise money for incor
poration. The students have also started a massive voter
registration drive which has been "very successful," ac
cording to Escobedo.
The area which is now East Palo Alto ranks 13th in San
Mateo County in the percentage of registered voters, up
from 19th in April 1981, according to Escobedo.
"This is largely the result of students spending two or
three hours on Saturdays at supermarkets registering
voters," Escobedo said.
Escobedo was also involved in a movement to get the
ASSU to approve Satterwhite as a guest professor here.
Satterwhite, who received a doctorate in education from
the University, would have taught a course called
"Community Development Workshop," which would
have educated students on East Palo Alto's incorpora
tion battle.
The Guest Professorship Bureau refused to propose
the course to the ASSU Senate, according to Escobedo,
because it was "too political."
A group of Stanford students who live in East Palo Alto
and favor incorporation have started a group called the
East Palo Alto Information Committee. The committee is
attempting to search out students who live in the area
and encourage them tovotefor incorporation. Thereare
approximately 350 University students living in the area,
according to Satterwhite.
Stanford students have been involved in East Palo
Alto's attempts to become a separate entity since the
late-19605, according to Archuleta. And blacks and
Chicanos from the East Palo Alto area, along with the
BSU, were instrumental in bringing about substantial
changes in the University's policies toward minority hir
ing and student recruitment after Martin Luther King's
death in 1968.
