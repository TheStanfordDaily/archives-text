# Research may help avert heart attacks

### JENNIFER SEYMOUR 
A group of cardiologists at Stan
ford Medical Center, headed by Dr.
William Clusin and Dr. Maurice
Buchbinder, has discovered a possi
ble preventative for fatal heart at
tacks.
Heart fibrillation is a heart attack
which occurs when abnormal elec
trical currents prohibit the ventricle
from pumping blood. This sudden
and usually fatal type of heart attack
currently claims a half million Ameri
cans each year. Its cause has been
unknown to heart specialists.
But Stanford researchers Clusin
and Buchbinder have shown that ac
cumulation of calcium in the cells of
the heart may cause these abnormal
electrical currents. Furthermore,
they hypothesize that beta blockers,
now frequently used to relieve chest
pain, will be effective at preventing
these heart fibrillations.
It further studies confirm these
findings, cardiologists may someday
be able to administer beta blockers
or similar drugs to people who are
likely heart fibrillation victims. Beta
blockers have been recognized and
used for more than 10 years to al
leviate chest pains. Fatigue and
shortness of breath are the only
known side effects.
"A previous heart attack, or evi
dence trom tests that someone could
suffer this kind of heart attack, would
be warning enough. By providing
them with beta blockers we would
hopefully be able to prevent the
heart attack before any symptoms
even occurred," Clusin said.
Buchbinder explained, "Normally,
the heart needs calcium to beat, and
the amount is regulated by the heart.
But it the heart's energy supply is

suddenly cut for even a brief period,
if a part of the muscle gives way, the
heart loses control of its calcium
supply and the calcium moves freely
in the heart's cells."
Clusin said, "We've found that this
calcium reacts with heart cell walls to
set up an electric potential." It is this
potential which the group believes is
responsible for the heart fibrilla
tions, or injury currents, doctors
hope to some day prevent.
"Some years ago, a Swedish de
mographic study showed that people
who had had heart attacks and then
began taking beta blockers lived
longer than those who were not tak
ing the medication," Clusin said.
"And it was known that beta blockers
block calcium accumulation in the
heart cells. These undocumented
facts became impetus for research "
According tc Clusin and Buchbin
der, their research has demonstrated
that beta adrenergic blockers act as
antifibrillators by reducing the cal
cium flow in cells, and by slowing
down the heart so that pumping de
mands are not so great.
"We were first able to show in our
experiments that calcium does relate
to heart fillibration. Once this was
demonstrated we were pretty confi
dent about our ideas on beta bloc
kers. Then all of the pieces of the
puzzle came together. All aspects of
our findings are pretty much in ac
cord.
"The really exciting part of this re
search is discovering whether or not
similar drugs will do this better.
We're pretty sure they will," Clusin
said. "Calcium blockers have been
tested and are shown to be incredi
bly effective in preventing abnormal

electrical currents. So far we aren't
sure exactly what drug will be
themost effective at preventing heart
fibrillation, but we are very op
timisitc about the potential of cal
cium antagonists."

The findings of Clusin, Buchbin
der, Harrison and Bistrow are sched
uled for immediate publication in
Lancet, a British scientific journal. Al
though it is too early to know what
the full response to their work will
be, the group is optimistic: "There
are other groups working on the
same general topic, but they've
tended to approach it from only one
angle. We came at it from all angles,
to get a broader picture. But our re

sults are in accord with theirs, and
reactions to our work seems to be
very positive."
The cardiologists hope that publi
cation of their findings will generate
some "major peer studies." Large
scale clinical tests are necessary be
fore a hypothesis can be applied to
people. "You don't want to be giving
asymptomatic people beta blockers
until you're reasonably sure they will
be effective," Buchbinder said.
