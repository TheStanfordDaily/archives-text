# Profs testify in criminal trials
## 
### KATHY OLMSTED Senior staff writer 
The defense claimed it was "di
minished capacity." The prosecution
claimed it was first degree murder. In
the end, the jury believed former San
Francisco Supervisor Dan White's
defense — including testimony by
Stanford psychiatrist Donald Lunde
— and convicted him of the lesser
charge of voluntary manslaughter.
The practice of engaging mental
health experts to testify in criminal
trials is common in the U.S. legal sys
ti'm, Here at Stanford, many
psychology and psychiatry profes
sors offer their expertise by testifying

in cases involving insanity defenses,
hypnosis, eyewitness identification
and other areas.
Lunde, clinical associate professor
of psychiatry and former senior re
sear( h assistant in law, has testified
in several celebrated trials, including
the Dan White, Patty Hearst and Hill
side Stranglrr cases. Lunde said he
testifies because he enjoys it.
"It's an area of research interest tor
me," he said. It's a case of practic
ing what I preach about."
Lunde said he also feels a profes
sional obligation to testify. When a
plea of insanity is entered by a dt>-
fendent in a criminal trial, the law

requires that the court appoint a psy
chiatrist to examine the defendent. If
either the defense or prosecuting at
torneys wish to call additional ex
perts, they are permitted to do so.
lunde said he serves as a court
appointed psychiatrist in the major
ity of his cases.
David Spiegel, associate psychiatry
professor and a well-known expert in
hypnosis, also testifies for enjoy
ment and out of a sense of civic duty.
"I enjoy it, but it's tough," he said.
"They (the opposing lawyers) really
go at you." Spiegel said he is usually
involved in cases in which he either
hypnotizes victims or witnesses, or
in which they have already been
hynotized.
In contrast, Psychology Prof.
Phoebe Ellsworth said she testifies
"as little as possible."
"I don't really like it very much,"
she said. But Ellsworth said she felt
an obligation to give testimony in
cases in which she had "somethings
to say" — cases involving eyewitness
identifications, or the possibly unfair
composition of the jury in capital
cases due to the exclusion of jury
members who oppose capital
punishment.
Psychology Prof. Philip Zimbardo
said he testifies in cases in which his
research on the conditions of prison
life are relevant. "In some selected
cases. . . I think the knowledge that
I have can help the judge or jury
make a more reasonable or equitable
decision," he said. Two weeks ago.
Zimbardo gave a videotaped deposi
tion on "the nature of prison condi
tions" to be used in the trial concern
ing the murder ofayouthinanldaho
jail last spring.
According to University Counsel
)ohn Schwartz, professors who testfy
in criminal trials are only subject to
general University regulations con
cerning outside consulting: full-time
faculty members may engage in con
sulting activities up to 13 days per
academic quarter. T here is no limit to
the amount a faculty member may
earn through consulting.
While most psychologists and psy
chiatrists are paid an hourly wage for
their testimony — Zimbardo esti
mated a typical amount to be $50 to
$100 an hour — Ellsworth said she
refused to take money for her tes
timony.
"I don't like to feel like I am offer
ing a product to the lawyers," she
said, adding that such an arrangment
might make her feel less indepen
dent in her testimony. But she said
she would not recommend abolish
ing payment for expert testimony
because "there are some very good
psychologists who probably
wouldn't do it if they weren t paid for
it."

Professors here often testify be
cause they feel they have a duty to
clarify an issue. Spiegel said he felt an
obligation to explain hypnosis to the
public. "Hypnosis is very widely
misunderstood by both the public
and the courts," he said. Spiegel's
work has been curtailed since the
Shirley decision by the California
Supreme Court in March prohibiting
victims and witnesses who have been
hypnotized to testify. Spiegel said
the court made this decision because
it believed that the hypnotist may
"program" the person under hyp
nosis with the wrong information.
But he said this view represented a
"worse-case scenario" and could
only occur with an "inept, stupid,
vicious" hypnotist.
Spiegel said the "bad joke" of this
decision is that a defendent who has
been hynotized may testify even
though the victim or witnesses may
not.
"The California Supreme Court
has gone off the deep end with this
decision," Spiegel said. Although
the Shirley decision might appear to
end his court affiliations, he said he
still hypnotizes victims and witnesses
in order to get clues in criminal
cases, as long as the patient and the

attorneys involved understand that
the patient may not testify.
Lunde's court appearances would
also seem to be affected by a recent
event: two weeks ago, the American
Psychiatric Association (APA) rec
ommended that psychiatrists not be
asked to render conclusive judg
ments as to the legal sanity or insan
ity of detendents in criminal trials.
According to Lunde, the recom
mendations don't change the pro
cess of psychiatric testimony in any
significant way. Lunde said 95 per
cent of a psychiatrist's time in court is
spent describing his or her examina
tion of the detendent, offering a
diagnosis of the state of the defen
dent's mental health and finally ren
dering an opinion as to whether the
defendent's mental illness was a fac
tor in the crime.
All of these procedures would re
main unchanged by the APA guide
lines: only the last question usually
asked by the attorney — if the psy
chiatrist believed that the defendent
was legally sane or insane — would
be eliminated. "That question would
be left to the jury," Lunde said.
Prof. Thomas Gonda, chairman of
the Psychiatry Department, agreed
that legal questions should not be

addressed by psychiatrists. "Sanity
or insanity is purely a legal term," he
said. "Judges and juries are much
better for determining sanity or in
sanity. Psychiatrists don't have that
role at all." But Gonda did say he
thought psychiatrists should be able
to render judgments on the mental
status of the individual.
Law Prof. John Kaplan criticized
the often contradictory nature of
psychiatric testimony. "Every time
you get one guy to say one thing, you
get another to say the opposite," he
said.
But Law Prof. Michael Wald said
such conflict is the nature of the legal
process. "If all the experts agree as to
the cause" of a particular piece of
litigation, Wald said, there would be
no litigation.
Lawyers try to obtain testimony
that will support their cases, Wald
said, but he denied that this practice
is unique to psychiatric testimony.
"Lawyers shop around for experts
that will support their viewpoint," he
said, but he added this was no more
true for lawyers seeking psychiatric
experts than for anti-trust lawyers
who utilize economic experts, or any
other type of trial in which experts
testify.
The opinions rendered by various
psychiatrists in court cases are often
controversial, even among psychia
trists themselves. Spiegel said he
disagreed with the verdict in the Dan
White case — in which White was
found guilty of voluntary manslaugh
ter, rather than first degree murder,
in the killing of San Francisco Mayor
George Moscone and Supervisor
Harvey Milk. Lunde testified for the
defense in that case.
"I think there was insufficient evi
dence of serious mental illness on
White's part," Spiegel said, adding
that White was angry but not men
tally ill at the time of the crime. But
Spiegel emphasized that he had not
personally examined White.
Lunde said White was suffering
from mental illness, and was "pro
foundly depressed" and even suici
dal at the time of the crime. Lunde
blamed the many misunderstandings
about the crime on the journalists
who covered the trial, saying it had
the "worst reporting of any case I've
ever been involved in."
