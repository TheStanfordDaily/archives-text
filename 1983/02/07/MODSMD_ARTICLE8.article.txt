East Palo Alto's struggle for
incorporation has engendered
political tactics and name
calling which rival in nastiness
last year's debates between
U.S. Senate candidates Jerry
Brown and Pete Wilson.
Former Rep. Paul "Pete"
McCloskey, who favored im
mediate incorporation for East
Palo Alto as a Congressman but
is now representing interests
opposed to incorporation, as
serts that "those people in East
Palo Alto love me." But
Omowale Satterwhite, the
president of the Community
Development Institute, which
is one of the main forces be
hind incorporation, said,
"somebody bought him
(McCloskey) to oppose incor
poration."
Satterwhite has also called
McCloskey's reasons for post
poning a vote for incorpora
tion for two years "spacious."
Henry Anthony, the unoffi

cial mayor of Fast Palo Alto, is
trying to add another measure
to the June 7 vote for incorpo
ration which would ask voters
if they want a new name for
East Palo Alto.
"That, quite frankly, is a
political ploy to confuse the
ballot," Satterwhite said.
And Ruben Abrica, one of
only two members of the five
person East Palo Alto Munici
pal Council who favors im
mediate incorporation, called
Anthony and the other council
members who oppose the June
incorporation vote "irrespon
sible."
"They don't want to lose
their privileged positions of
power. They don't want any
change unless it's on their
terms," Abrica said.
A vote on incorporation
which took place last April —
and lost by 41 votes — had four
complicated ballot measures,
and voters were not sure which
measure they were voting for.
