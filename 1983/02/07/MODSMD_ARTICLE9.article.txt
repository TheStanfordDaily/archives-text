### JENNIFER SEYMOUR 
I he University has alvyays had its
share of entrepreneurs, and student
ventures have includedeverything
from hamburgers to small busi
nesses. But sophomore Peter Kip
linger is producing a Stanford first:
Kiplinger begins marketing his Men
of Stanford calendar thisispring.
"I had seen the calendars that USC
and Arizona State put out and was
curious about Stanford's;" Kiplinger
said. "So last spring I waited for a
Men of Stanford calendar to come
out. When I realized Stanford didn't
have a calendar, I got the idea to do
one myself."
Men at Stanford is ndw well be
yond the idea stage. Kiplipger's pho
tographer has shot all the pictures
and printing has been negotiated,
fhe calendar should appear in col
lege bookstores across the country
this spring.
"The Calendar should be out by
early May, so that the seniors will
have time to buy them, then they'll
go on sale again next fall/' Kiplinger
said.
Kiplinger sees the calendar as a
chance to make some profit and as a
"first attempt at a small business ven
ture." His father has provided fund
ing tor the calendar costs, "My father
put up the money willingly," Kip
linger said. "Both my dad and I think
we will make a profit; I hope we do."
Others are unsure about the prof
itability of Men at Stanford. Sopho
more David Bottom, one of the stu

dents participating in the
said, "i'm'not sure how the calendar
will sell; the market's pretty satu|
rated right now. But Kiplinger hasn't
put the whole thing together yet. If
it's a little|different, he could do rel
ally well.'-

Junior Peter Spivack, who declinec|
an invitation to be in Men at Stan
ford, is also unsure: "it will be inj
teresting to see how this calendar
does," he said. "It's worked well a|
other schools, but I don't know
about here; Stanford's a little
different, 112
•Others are more opttmistte. Senior
Joe Delartey, another student parti|
cipating fn the calendar, said he
thinks it will sell well. "I don't thinly
the calendar is catering to the Stanl
ford campus. I think he'll market it at
other schools." Delaney, a Phi Delt|
sees the calendar as different than
the Phi Delt calendar he tried to or*
ganize. "it never really got off the
ground. We had problems with out
calendar, and the market was too lim|
ited. But ICiplinger's calendar is very
professional. I think it'll do well."
Kiplinger began the project byj
compilinga list of suggested models
for the calendar. He then ap*
proacheds the individuals with his
idea. "A majority of the guys thought
it was a big joke at first," he said. "But
when I assured them that the calen

dar was for real, many were flattered
and were willing to* get involved.
Some didn't think it vfas their sort of
thing."
Bottom said, "I v|as really sur
prised when he first" called me. At
first I thought it wasl't something I
wanted to do. But Sien I thought
'Why not? It might be|fun.'" Bottom,
who'd never done 'jnythlng like it
before," said he wajs eager to see
how it would turn ouland how famiy
and friends would reject.
"My first reaction?" said sopho
more Bob March, another student
who will be in the c|lendar, "I was
really surprised and amazed at first. I
was really flattered."! He added, "It
turned out to be a pretty fun thing to
do."
Others were less enthusiastic.
Spivak said, "When he first asked
me, I didn't know how to react. But I
knew I didn't want to do it. I think I
resented the idea of being objec
tified. It's the same thing as the
women's calendar, thlere's the same
objections involved.'|
First-year law student Rich
Brkigetord said, ' Tbe caJcndar was
going to have nothing to do with any
of the men's activities here."
Bridgeford, a Stanfprd graduate,
said, "I don't feel pictures are de
humanizing, but in this instance I
didn't think that the;picture would
portray me as a person. I objected to
it on those grounds! He added, "I
was also sure they wouldn't have any
problems finding pepple to partici

pate. J
Indeed, Kiplinger came up with
more thajp enough potential men at
Stanford. Kiplinger had preliminary
shots taken by a friend, arid these
were evaluated by Kiplinger and a
professional photographer from a
modeling agency. From this pool of
snapshots, Kiplinger selected his
models.
"Beyond that stage, everything has
beendoqp professionally," Kiplinger
said. He worked with a modeling
agency 4nd professional photo
grapher to come up with the right
"look" fqr eachmodel.

Kiplinger is highly optimistic about
the outcome of the calendar. "I've
seen ths pictures, and they're
good," Kiplinger said. "The pictures
of our guys are much better than the
USC guys. I think USC's calendar is
currently the best one out, and after
seeing our pictures, I can honestly
say that going to give USC
competition. ***»■■
He added, "I initially expected to
sell in the thousands." Kiplinger will
market thje color calendars for $7.95.
"But, talking to people who've done
this befole, they say they've sold in
the tens of thousands. At this point,
I'd say this isn't really a small busi
ness venture anymore, it's a big
one."
