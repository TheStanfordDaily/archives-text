Pacific Telephone, now undergoing perhaps the most dramatic changes
ever experienced in the history of telecommunications, is now seeking
dynamic, highly motivated individuals for a variety of challenging posi
tions in data processing, engineering, operations and sales Our most
competitive candidates are those who have demonstrated superior
scholastic achievement (preferably in technical disciplines), as well as
successful leadership experience For those who enjoy pressing to the
limits of their potential, we also offer an excellent manager-development
program —a fast-paced, no-norisense, high-risk/high -reward program
designed for people who wouldn't have it any other way Because this
accelerated program exists to enrich our middle and upper management
source pools, we select only the most competitive candidates—those
who have sustained top-guarter grades throughout college, and who
have demonstrated a substantial amount of leadership either on campus,
in the community or on the job. These positions are supervisory in nature
all are results-oriented and designed to demonstrate potential for further
advancement.
So, if meeting challenges is a way of life for you, then we have something
in common, and we're prepared to not only recognize your talents, but
to reward them handsomely We offer exceptional career opportunities.
