## The
						Stanford Daily Concerns about Medi-Cal 
### 
Fear that the Stanford University Hospital
would no longer be able to accept Medi-Cal
patients was assuaged when the state officially
granted the Hospital a contract Friday, but con
cerns about health care in the area should not
cease.
The University had been waiting for a verdict
on the proposed Medi-Cal contract since lan. 1.
The state govern ment, hindered by the "holiday
season," was a bit slow in making decisions
about the new functioning of Medi-Cal.
The delay caused some problems at the Hos
pital, officials have commented on the incon
venience of writing up two budgets, but we
imagine nervous stomachs and tension
headaches were more bothersome.
Fortunately, it wasn't worth the worry â€” Stan
ford Hospitai can still admit Medi-Cal patients.
We just hope that the Hospital and others in the
area will be able to provide the same quality of
care to Medi-Cal patients after March 1, when
changes in the health care system become ef
fective.
Two results of the new system have to be
considered: fewer hospitals will be able to treat
Medi-Cal patients in other than emergency situ
ations and those that can may not always be

willing to do so.
Seven Santa Clara County hospitals were not
as lucky as Stanford and four other area hospi
tals that received contracts. While the non
contracted hospitals will be hurt by loss in re
venue and some of their employees will sub
sequently be out of work, those most affected
may be Medi-Cal patients who will have only
four, rather than 11, hospitals to service them.
The hospitals that are able to accept Medi-Cal
patients tor any type of treatment may turn
around and accept them for only certain treat
ments. Since the state pays a specified amount
for each Medi-Cal patient, regardless of the
treatment or length of hospitalization, some
hospitals may be tempted to turn away serious
cases as a means of expressing disapproval of
the new system.
The state decided to make changes in Medi-
Cal primarily to save money, but if resultant
economic problems for the Hospital hinder pa
tient care, the policy of frugality should be
reexamined.
But hopefully state Medi-Cal officials took
some extra time in making decisions so that the
new system will run healthfully and keep the
county healthy^
