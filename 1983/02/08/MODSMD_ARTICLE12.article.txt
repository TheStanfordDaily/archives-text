Both the Viennese Ball Committee and the
Senior Class Presidents deserve congratulations
for sponsoring the Viennese Ball and Senior
Casino Night respectively. For many the Vien
nese Ball and the Senior Casino Night represent
the highlights of winter quarter.
Unfortunately, however, it is the very popu
larity of these two events which leads to prob
lems. Tickets to Senior Casino Night sold out so
rapidly, that a great number ot seniors were
turned away
It was only 9 a.m. when students began lining
up to purchase tickets for the Viennese Ball
which weretobesold at noon. Bvll:3oa.m. the
line stretched trom the Post Office al! the way
down to "I residder. By the time the ticket supply
had been exhausted, scalped pairs were being
sold for as much as $50, almost twice the original
price.
We believe an event such as Senior Casino
Night, sponsored by the Senior Class Presi
dents, should be made more accessible to

seniors. We suggest, first of all, that a larger
facility be found in which to hold the event. We
recognize, however, that as distance from the
campus increases, so also do problems as
sociated with drinking and driving. Clearly a
iarge hall a long way from Staniord would not be
a satisfactory solution. We also suggest that
Casino Night tickets be sold on a one-ticket
per-senior I.D. basis.
Certainly the Viennese Ball Committee has no
designated or explicit responsibility to serve a
certain limited constituency. We also recognize
that the committee was required by fire de
partment regulations to reduce and to limit the
number of tickets soid this year, perhaps the
ball could take place on consecutive Friday and
Saturday nights.
We thank both the Viennese Ball Committee
and the Senior Class Presidents tor their efforts
and hard work in organizing these two occa
sions, but we only wish more of us could be
there to thank them personally.
