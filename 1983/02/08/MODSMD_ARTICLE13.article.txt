## Mental health should be everyone's business 
### 
The week of leb. 7-11 has been
designated Mental Health Week
I his week reflects the work of many,
primarily the members of the B idgp
community and Residential Fdina
tion. I would like the readers of the
Daily to know why we at Counseling
and Psychological Services of the
Cowell Health Center think it impor
tant.
When a week is set aside in this
fashion, it rs to underline the impor
tance of some purpose. The relation
ship of stress to health, work and
human relationship is such a pur
pose. Menial health, one definition
ot which is the ability to work, to love
and to be optimistic, cannot be taken
for granted. It requires attention and
effort.
This is true for us as individuals and
as a community. As individuals each
of us must tend to our emotional and
physical states and deal with them.
This mav require more attention for
some than for others or more atten
tion at a certain rime in a person's life
than othei periods of that life. How
ever, the fact remains, each person
living a life will confront and need to
cope with stress as well as disap
pointment, anger and sadness along
with the more positive and sought
atter human feelings and states
To be able to cope with these in
tense feelings, to mairiiain physical
and men'.a! health, we need to know
ourselves, oik strengths and limita
tions and to know and be able to
use our own resources effectively
Mental Health Week aims to remind
everyone on the campus o* this and
to offer j range ot presentations and
discussions locused on mental
health.
Stanford students are neither im
mune from noi particularly vulnera
ble to stress. In the large group ot
students who are at Standford thnre
is no particular pattern of stress. One
thing which does characterize Stan
ford students is a high level of liveli
ness and creativity I hough not im
mune "to the problems of living'
they can as individuals and as a
community attempt new explora
tions and solutions.
Every person of the campus has o
contribution to make to his/her own
well being, the well being of friends,
colleagues or family members and to
the community as a whol#-. There
should be something in the program
of Mental Health Week which ap
peals to every interest. Mental
Health, caring tor ourselves and
others, creating and maintaining a
social environment which is sustain
ing and supportive is the job tor all of
us.

Those who have organized Mental
Health Week deserve the thanks of
*he pntire community. We need to
lejrn from others and with openness
we can learn. It is in the best spirit of
this institution that those who have
gone before and those who have
something special to say attempt to
illuminate the path for others. Men
tal Health Week is a reminder of our
common task, loin in the activities.

Changes in Quad
As reported bv the Daily ("Facelift
tor Quad Proposed," Feb. 3), those
responsible for the "facelift" have
srressed "historical accuracy" and
making this space more congenial
They consider grass surfaces "un
likely" because in the 1880s Fre
derick Law Oimsted didn't want it as
Stanford ts in a semi-arid region. The
planners worrv about too many per
sons taking short cuts across Quad
lawns. Favored by the planners are
coarse grained gravel in concrete
and, not surprisingly, asphalt. How
these hard surfaces would make the
Quad more congenial, cooler in
summer, and inhibit vehicular traffic
while slowing down pedestrians has
yet to be explained in public.
As Olmsted never indicated his
desired surfacing, much less its de
sign historical accuracy is irrelevant
to this aspect of the Quad's redesign.
In view of the acres of irrigated lawns
that ihe Planning Office keeps instal
ling, Olmsted's once-reasonable
idea now seems outmoded or even
quaint ludging from pre-1906
photos,*fhe sunken oval north of the
Quad seems to have originally been
left bare ot grass by Olmsted, but the
same office that planted it with an
irrigated lawn now worries about
"historical accuracy" for the inner
Quart. Is the giass in Memorial Court
an inaccuracy*
We have gravel set into concrete
panels on the outer walls of certain
campus buildings and it is far from
pleasant. The prospect of the Plan
ning Office designing an asphalted
Quad after the vulgar fiasco of the
History Corner Courtya r d is depres
sing to anyone with taste. Why add
benches to the perimeters of the
oasis it people will be forced to gaze
on yards of asphalt or pebbles?
Where in the world have these mate
rials ever slowed a pedestrian or bike
rider? Student preference for grass in

the Quad is well founded from the
stand point ot color, texture, effect
on temperature in hot weather, and
visual attractiveness. Either design is
lands of grass with pathways bet
ween, or let students make paths in
the grass as they do elsewhere on
campus. Governor Stanford wanted
grass tor the Quad and since he often
overruled Olmsted, there is an his
torical precedent.

Medicine rebuttal
I hope that, in responding to
Shirish Date's "Viewpoint" concern
ing medicine in the United States
(Daily, Feb. 1), I'm playing a straight
man to a terrible joke. Nevertheless,
such a column can and must be ques
tioned whenever it appears in a pub
lication with the readership of the
Daily.
Date mistakenly contends two
things: first, that America has some
how declined as a result of socialism
and, second, that American
medicine is a socialist institution.
The first thought seems quite silly,
particularly given Date's declared
major in political science. The author
manages to completely ignore a fea
ture of English government obvious
tor several hundred years. Represen
tative rule in a broad public interest
was well outlined by Locke during
the late 1600 sand by our own
"Founding Fathers" of the 1700s. It is
an idea which, one hopes, extends to
the present in this country. This trad
ition of equality didn't seem to stifle
the development of the "rugged in
dividualist" America Date values so
much
The second idea, of medicine as an
evil socialist entity, appears even
more comic. One needn't look any
farther than the ledgers of the
American Medical Association
(AMA) to document practicing
physicians' lobbying efforts against
such programs as Medicare. It also
seems difficult to imagine why
dangerous, un- American surgeons at
Georgetown would labor to treat one
of Date's conservative gurus, Presi
dent Reagan, after a gunshot wound
22 months ago.
As a medical student, i cannot ob
viously claim objectivity concerning
this subject. Equal access lo health
care and tne sanctity of life are ideals
to which we must remain committed,
even during times of economic ad
versity. The Reagan administration
has dedicated 25 to 30 percent of its
recently submitted budget to
weaponry, hardware which if used

might well end life on this planet. To
spend less than half that amount on
health care is to ignore our very sur
vival.

Social Security
Presently, Social Security solvency
is very much in the forefront of pub
lic thought. There have been many
singular and composite proposals for
resolving present and future deficits.
The one change that presently ap
pears wholly unobtainable is a gen
eral cut in benefits, as it seems to be
politically unthinkable.
I am concerned that in all the
proposal rhetoric I have heard, there
has not been a suggestion for making
a direct appeal to Social Security re
cipients, who have grown to have lit
tle or no need for benefits, to volun
tarily propose to accept a lesser
amount or rescind their participation
entirely. I believe there are presently
large numbers who are ebulliently
thankful for our country who are
now being deprived of the excite
ment of direct helps to their govern
ment. We all tend to go along habitu
ally accepting financial benefits as it
just seems to be our due. I suggested
this thought to a person I know who
has far more than usable income
from investments. He was at first ap
paiied and said, "Why I need Social
Security money to pay all my direct
living expenses each month." After a
double-take he opinioned that a les
ser amount, or even none at all, was
not senseless in his case.
The following specific proposal is
made — All present Social Security
recipients should be officially chal
lenged to voluntarily forego the regu
lar July 1 cost of living increase and
take at least a 10 percent cut in the
amount they rece>ve. Further, as an
alternate, they should be challenged
to voluntarily decline the total they
now receive. Simultaneously, they
should be assured that there will be a
renewed and continuing effort to
eliminate chiselers from the prog
ram.
Of course, those in real need
would not be expected to take part in
this voluntary program.
The response could very well go a
long way toward bringing about sol
vency. It can be a stimulating chal
lenge to many for objective examina
tion of their true needs and of their
personal goodwill toward their coun
try's welfare.

Medicine rebuttal
I hope that, in responding to
Shirish Date's "Viewpoint" concern
ing medicine in the United States
(Daily, Feb. 1), I'm playing a straight
man to a terrible joke. Nevertheless,
such a column can and must be ques
tioned whenever it appears in a pub
lication with the readership of the
Daily.
Date mistakenly contends two
things: first, that America has some
how declined as a result of socialism
and, second, that American
medicine is a socialist institution.
The first thought seems quite silly,
particularly given Date's declared
major in political science. The author
manages to completely ignore a fea
ture of English government obvious
tor several hundred years. Represen
tative rule in a broad public interest
was well outlined by Locke during
the late 1600 sand by our own
"Founding Fathers" of the 1700s. It is
an idea which, one hopes, extends to
the present in this country. This trad
ition of equality didn't seem to stifle
the development of the "rugged in
dividualist" America Date values so
much
The second idea, of medicine as an
evil socialist entity, appears even
more comic. One needn't look any
farther than the ledgers of the
American Medical Association
(AMA) to document practicing
physicians' lobbying efforts against
such programs as Medicare. It also
seems difficult to imagine why
dangerous, un- American surgeons at
Georgetown would labor to treat one
of Date's conservative gurus, Presi
dent Reagan, after a gunshot wound
22 months ago.
As a medical student, i cannot ob
viously claim objectivity concerning
this subject. Equal access lo health
care and tne sanctity of life are ideals
to which we must remain committed,
even during times of economic ad
versity. The Reagan administration
has dedicated 25 to 30 percent of its
recently submitted budget to
weaponry, hardware which if used

might well end life on this planet. To
spend less than half that amount on
health care is to ignore our very sur
vival.

Social Security
Presently, Social Security solvency
is very much in the forefront of pub
lic thought. There have been many
singular and composite proposals for
resolving present and future deficits.
The one change that presently ap
pears wholly unobtainable is a gen
eral cut in benefits, as it seems to be
politically unthinkable.
I am concerned that in all the
proposal rhetoric I have heard, there
has not been a suggestion for making
a direct appeal to Social Security re
cipients, who have grown to have lit
tle or no need for benefits, to volun
tarily propose to accept a lesser
amount or rescind their participation
entirely. I believe there are presently
large numbers who are ebulliently
thankful for our country who are
now being deprived of the excite
ment of direct helps to their govern
ment. We all tend to go along habitu
ally accepting financial benefits as it
just seems to be our due. I suggested
this thought to a person I know who
has far more than usable income
from investments. He was at first ap
paiied and said, "Why I need Social
Security money to pay all my direct
living expenses each month." After a
double-take he opinioned that a les
ser amount, or even none at all, was
not senseless in his case.
The following specific proposal is
made — All present Social Security
recipients should be officially chal
lenged to voluntarily forego the regu
lar July 1 cost of living increase and
take at least a 10 percent cut in the
amount they rece>ve. Further, as an
alternate, they should be challenged
to voluntarily decline the total they
now receive. Simultaneously, they
should be assured that there will be a
renewed and continuing effort to
eliminate chiselers from the prog
ram.
Of course, those in real need
would not be expected to take part in
this voluntary program.
The response could very well go a
long way toward bringing about sol
vency. It can be a stimulating chal
lenge to many for objective examina
tion of their true needs and of their
personal goodwill toward their coun
try's welfare.

The week of leb. 7-11 has been
designated Mental Health Week
I his week reflects the work of many,
primarily the members of the B idgp
community and Residential Fdina
tion. I would like the readers of the
Daily to know why we at Counseling
and Psychological Services of the
Cowell Health Center think it impor
tant.
When a week is set aside in this
fashion, it rs to underline the impor
tance of some purpose. The relation
ship of stress to health, work and
human relationship is such a pur
pose. Menial health, one definition
ot which is the ability to work, to love
and to be optimistic, cannot be taken
for granted. It requires attention and
effort.
This is true for us as individuals and
as a community. As individuals each
of us must tend to our emotional and
physical states and deal with them.
This mav require more attention for
some than for others or more atten
tion at a certain rime in a person's life
than othei periods of that life. How
ever, the fact remains, each person
living a life will confront and need to
cope with stress as well as disap
pointment, anger and sadness along
with the more positive and sought
atter human feelings and states
To be able to cope with these in
tense feelings, to mairiiain physical
and men'.a! health, we need to know
ourselves, oik strengths and limita
tions and to know and be able to
use our own resources effectively
Mental Health Week aims to remind
everyone on the campus o* this and
to offer j range ot presentations and
discussions locused on mental
health.
Stanford students are neither im
mune from noi particularly vulnera
ble to stress. In the large group ot
students who are at Standford thnre
is no particular pattern of stress. One
thing which does characterize Stan
ford students is a high level of liveli
ness and creativity I hough not im
mune "to the problems of living'
they can as individuals and as a
community attempt new explora
tions and solutions.
Every person of the campus has o
contribution to make to his/her own
well being, the well being of friends,
colleagues or family members and to
the community as a whol#-. There
should be something in the program
of Mental Health Week which ap
peals to every interest. Mental
Health, caring tor ourselves and
others, creating and maintaining a
social environment which is sustain
ing and supportive is the job tor all of
us.

Those who have organized Mental
Health Week deserve the thanks of
*he pntire community. We need to
lejrn from others and with openness
we can learn. It is in the best spirit of
this institution that those who have
gone before and those who have
something special to say attempt to
illuminate the path for others. Men
tal Health Week is a reminder of our
common task, loin in the activities.

versity. The Reagan administration
has dedicated 25 to 30 percent of its
recently submitted budget to
weaponry, hardware which if used

might well end life on this planet. To
spend less than half that amount on
health care is to ignore our very sur
vival.

Social Security
Presently, Social Security solvency
is very much in the forefront of pub
lic thought. There have been many
singular and composite proposals for
resolving present and future deficits.
The one change that presently ap
pears wholly unobtainable is a gen
eral cut in benefits, as it seems to be
politically unthinkable.
I am concerned that in all the
proposal rhetoric I have heard, there
has not been a suggestion for making
a direct appeal to Social Security re
cipients, who have grown to have lit
tle or no need for benefits, to volun
tarily propose to accept a lesser
amount or rescind their participation
entirely. I believe there are presently
large numbers who are ebulliently
thankful for our country who are
now being deprived of the excite
ment of direct helps to their govern
ment. We all tend to go along habitu
ally accepting financial benefits as it
just seems to be our due. I suggested
this thought to a person I know who
has far more than usable income
from investments. He was at first ap
paiied and said, "Why I need Social
Security money to pay all my direct
living expenses each month." After a
double-take he opinioned that a les
ser amount, or even none at all, was
not senseless in his case.
The following specific proposal is
made — All present Social Security
recipients should be officially chal
lenged to voluntarily forego the regu
lar July 1 cost of living increase and
take at least a 10 percent cut in the
amount they rece>ve. Further, as an
alternate, they should be challenged
to voluntarily decline the total they
now receive. Simultaneously, they
should be assured that there will be a
renewed and continuing effort to
eliminate chiselers from the prog
ram.
Of course, those in real need
would not be expected to take part in
this voluntary program.
The response could very well go a
long way toward bringing about sol
vency. It can be a stimulating chal
lenge to many for objective examina
tion of their true needs and of their
personal goodwill toward their coun
try's welfare.

The week of leb. 7-11 has been
designated Mental Health Week
I his week reflects the work of many,
primarily the members of the B idgp
community and Residential Fdina
tion. I would like the readers of the
Daily to know why we at Counseling
and Psychological Services of the
Cowell Health Center think it impor
tant.
When a week is set aside in this
fashion, it rs to underline the impor
tance of some purpose. The relation
ship of stress to health, work and
human relationship is such a pur
pose. Menial health, one definition
ot which is the ability to work, to love
and to be optimistic, cannot be taken
for granted. It requires attention and
effort.
This is true for us as individuals and
as a community. As individuals each
of us must tend to our emotional and
physical states and deal with them.
This mav require more attention for
some than for others or more atten
tion at a certain rime in a person's life
than othei periods of that life. How
ever, the fact remains, each person
living a life will confront and need to
cope with stress as well as disap
pointment, anger and sadness along
with the more positive and sought
atter human feelings and states
To be able to cope with these in
tense feelings, to mairiiain physical
and men'.a! health, we need to know
ourselves, oik strengths and limita
tions and to know and be able to
use our own resources effectively
Mental Health Week aims to remind
everyone on the campus o* this and
to offer j range ot presentations and
discussions locused on mental
health.
Stanford students are neither im
mune from noi particularly vulnera
ble to stress. In the large group ot
students who are at Standford thnre
is no particular pattern of stress. One
thing which does characterize Stan
ford students is a high level of liveli
ness and creativity I hough not im
mune "to the problems of living'
they can as individuals and as a
community attempt new explora
tions and solutions.
Every person of the campus has o
contribution to make to his/her own
well being, the well being of friends,
colleagues or family members and to
the community as a whol#-. There
should be something in the program
of Mental Health Week which ap
peals to every interest. Mental
Health, caring tor ourselves and
others, creating and maintaining a
social environment which is sustain
ing and supportive is the job tor all of
us.

Those who have organized Mental
Health Week deserve the thanks of
*he pntire community. We need to
lejrn from others and with openness
we can learn. It is in the best spirit of
this institution that those who have
gone before and those who have
something special to say attempt to
illuminate the path for others. Men
tal Health Week is a reminder of our
common task, loin in the activities.

Changes in Quad
As reported bv the Daily ("Facelift
tor Quad Proposed," Feb. 3), those
responsible for the "facelift" have
srressed "historical accuracy" and
making this space more congenial
They consider grass surfaces "un
likely" because in the 1880s Fre
derick Law Oimsted didn't want it as
Stanford ts in a semi-arid region. The
planners worrv about too many per
sons taking short cuts across Quad
lawns. Favored by the planners are
coarse grained gravel in concrete
and, not surprisingly, asphalt. How
these hard surfaces would make the
Quad more congenial, cooler in
summer, and inhibit vehicular traffic
while slowing down pedestrians has
yet to be explained in public.
As Olmsted never indicated his
desired surfacing, much less its de
sign historical accuracy is irrelevant
to this aspect of the Quad's redesign.
In view of the acres of irrigated lawns
that ihe Planning Office keeps instal
ling, Olmsted's once-reasonable
idea now seems outmoded or even
quaint ludging from pre-1906
photos,*fhe sunken oval north of the
Quad seems to have originally been
left bare ot grass by Olmsted, but the
same office that planted it with an
irrigated lawn now worries about
"historical accuracy" for the inner
Quart. Is the giass in Memorial Court
an inaccuracy*
We have gravel set into concrete
panels on the outer walls of certain
campus buildings and it is far from
pleasant. The prospect of the Plan
ning Office designing an asphalted
Quad after the vulgar fiasco of the
History Corner Courtya r d is depres
sing to anyone with taste. Why add
benches to the perimeters of the
oasis it people will be forced to gaze
on yards of asphalt or pebbles?
Where in the world have these mate
rials ever slowed a pedestrian or bike
rider? Student preference for grass in

the Quad is well founded from the
stand point ot color, texture, effect
on temperature in hot weather, and
visual attractiveness. Either design is
lands of grass with pathways bet
ween, or let students make paths in
the grass as they do elsewhere on
campus. Governor Stanford wanted
grass tor the Quad and since he often
overruled Olmsted, there is an his
torical precedent.

Medicine rebuttal
I hope that, in responding to
Shirish Date's "Viewpoint" concern
ing medicine in the United States
(Daily, Feb. 1), I'm playing a straight
man to a terrible joke. Nevertheless,
such a column can and must be ques
tioned whenever it appears in a pub
lication with the readership of the
Daily.
Date mistakenly contends two
things: first, that America has some
how declined as a result of socialism
and, second, that American
medicine is a socialist institution.
The first thought seems quite silly,
particularly given Date's declared
major in political science. The author
manages to completely ignore a fea
ture of English government obvious
tor several hundred years. Represen
tative rule in a broad public interest
was well outlined by Locke during
the late 1600 sand by our own
"Founding Fathers" of the 1700s. It is
an idea which, one hopes, extends to
the present in this country. This trad
ition of equality didn't seem to stifle
the development of the "rugged in
dividualist" America Date values so
much
The second idea, of medicine as an
evil socialist entity, appears even
more comic. One needn't look any
farther than the ledgers of the
American Medical Association
(AMA) to document practicing
physicians' lobbying efforts against
such programs as Medicare. It also
seems difficult to imagine why
dangerous, un- American surgeons at
Georgetown would labor to treat one
of Date's conservative gurus, Presi
dent Reagan, after a gunshot wound
22 months ago.
As a medical student, i cannot ob
viously claim objectivity concerning
this subject. Equal access lo health
care and tne sanctity of life are ideals
to which we must remain committed,
even during times of economic ad
versity. The Reagan administration
has dedicated 25 to 30 percent of its
recently submitted budget to
weaponry, hardware which if used

might well end life on this planet. To
spend less than half that amount on
health care is to ignore our very sur
vival.
