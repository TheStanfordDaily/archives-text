# Arkansas has done it again
## 
### 
Now let me make it perfectly clear
that I have nothing against Arkansas
orArkansans. I've driven through the
state a few times myself and it's quite
beautiful. But when it come to mak
ing laws, the Arkansas State Legisla
ture simply has no peer in the United
States for making itself look like a
horse's posterior.
Last year we had the famous — or
infamous — 'Equal Time For Creation
Science-Evolution Science Act." By
this law Arkansas' hapless legislators
attempted to get the Biblical story of
Genesis taught in the public schools
as a valid and competing theory of
biology . The American Civil Liberties
Union, with the help of a few of the
world's most celebrated biologists,
managed to get Federal District
ludge William Ray Overton to strike
down the law as a flagrant attempt to
use the public schools to dissemi
nate frankly sectarian religious doc
trines, which indeed it was.
Rest assured, however, that forAr-

Kansas' legislators,, the battle to de
fend the Bible from all enemies, real
and imagined, continues. The latest
target perceived by the Arkansas
State House is not Charles Darwin,
but rock groups. By an 86-0 vote, the
House recently passed a bill that
would require tapes and records
of rock music to carry warning labels
if they are suspected of containing
"satanic messages" when played in
reverse.
The bill is the product of a cam
paign by an Arkansas minister who
believes that the nation's youth is
being subliminally influenced by
satanic messages in iock music. The
question of whether Led Zeppelin
and Styx are doing the work of the
devil aside, this bill (it will become
law if passed by the State Senate and
signed by Governor Clinton) is
clearly unconstitutional.
Even supposing there were
genuine satanic messages on the re
cords, satanism is a bona fide religi
ous belief, however abhorrent it may
be to Arkansans (and the rest of us).
Before allowing the issue to degen
erate into the inevitable jokes and

religious putdowns, it would be well
to consider that this proposed law
gives the police in Arkansas power to
seize without warning and destroy
any unlabeled recordings. To ap
preciate just how derogatoiv this is
of the First Amendment's guarantees
of freedom of speech and religion,
consider the hypothetical case of de
voutly Christian Arkansas requiring
all copies of the Moslem Koran to
carry "warning labels."
Surely the State Legislature of Ar
kansas has better things to do with its
time than pass these ridiculous laws.
There must be more immediately
pressing issues altering Arka ic?s
than the cosmic stiuggle between
God and the Devil. You might almost
think they passed this kind of legisla
tion just to keep the ACLU on its
toes. I can't help wondering whether
this anti-rock music bill has the back
ing of an Arkansas interest group
equally as powerful as the Christian
fundamentalists: the country music,
industry.
