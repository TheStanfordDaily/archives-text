## Jones scores 28 Stanford blasts lethargic Wildcats 
### STEVE ODELL Senior sports writer 
An aggressive Stanford bas
ketball team, led by Keith
Jones' career-high 28 points,
trounced lifeless, hapless and
winless Arizona 86-69 in a
Pacific-10 Conference game at
Maples Pavilion last night.
Jones made 10 of 13 shots
from the field, most of them
short jump shots in the lane fol
lowing penetrating drives
against a timid Wildcat zone
defense. He also had three ste
als in the tenacious Stanford
fullcourt press in 25V2 minutes
of playing time.
"We've done pretty good
against zones all year," Jones
said. "Our primary goal is al
ways to penetrate. They played
tough in the first half. We were
hoping to wear them down. In
the second half, our press
started taking its toll.
"I can't carry this team by
myself," he responded when
asked about the loss of leading
Cardinal scorer and rebounder
John Revelli for the season.
"We'll need four or five guys to
carry us. It'll probably be a dif
ferent guy every night. Tonight
it just happened to be me."
Stanford, now 4-5 in the con
ference and 12-7 overall, blew
open a tight game with an
eleven-point streak in four mi
nutes, taking advantage of five
Wildcat turnovers. The run
gave Stanford a 15-point advan
tage over UA, nowo-9 in Pac-10
play and 3-16 overall.
For the first time in recent
memory. Stanford dominated
the boards. Hans Wichary pul
led down 11 rebounds to lead
the surge underneath as the
Card outmuscled the Wildcats
40-21 under the glass. Wichary
also pumped in 15 points and
continued his fine play at the
center position since Revelli's
departure from the starting
line-up.
What was a familiar result
was Stanford's domination at
the foul line. While both teams
scored 30 field goals, the Card
made 26 of 34 free throws to
just nine of 17 for Arizona.
Wildcat coach Ben Lindsay,

who was called for two con
secutive technical fouls in the
first half, was upset with the
imbalanceatthefoul line, "We
had a chance to play and a
chance to win, but the officials
took us out of it," hesaid. "The
technicals were correct, but
the lack of calls were apparent.
Stanford has a fine coach. His
kids hustled and they show a
lot of aggressiveness on their
press. I don't want to take any
thing away from their fine
play."
Arizona guard Brock Brun
khorst, who led the Wildcats
with 16 points on howitzer
style jump shots, had just con

verted the first of two tech nical
foul shots to make the score
51-47 with 14:29 left in the
game when Stanford went on
its run.
Cardinal guard Keith Ramee
started the blitz when he inter
cepted the halfcourt inbounds
pass following Brunkhorst's
free throw and drove for a lay
in. After the teams traded
fouls, Jones stole a pass at mid
court and put in another lay-in
to make the score 55-47.
Steve Brown stole the ensu
ing inbounds pass and made
two foul shots after being
fouled while shooting by
Donald Mellon. Brunkhorst

was called for traveling against
the press and Earl Koberlein
put in the last of four free
throw attempts before Brun
khorst stepped out-of-bounds
on the sideline.
After Jones missed the first
of a one-and-one opportunity,
Rogers was fouled on Stan
ford's next possession by
Brunkhorst. Rogers netted
both foul shots, and then a
chalkboard fast break was
created following an Arizona
miss when Brown rebounded,
threw an outlet pass to Ricky
Lewis, who in turn dished
ahead to a driving Jones, who
converted the lay-in to give the

Card its 15-poin* lead.
"We were doing a good job
getting out on the break,"
Jones said. "I like my chances
in the open court."
The closest the Wildcats
could come the rest of the way
was 12 points, the last time at
the 10:00 mark when Brun
khorst nailed in an 18-foot
jump shot from the right side
to make the score 64-52.
The Cardinal forged its
biggest lead of 22 points with
5:35 remaining after Koberlem
cashed in on two free throws to
give Standord a 79-57 lead.
Forward Frank Smith, the
Wildcats' leading scorer and
rebounder, was bottled up in
side by the Cardinal zone de
fense, but was also hurt by lack
of vision inside by the UA
guards. "I don't know what
happened," said Smith, who
finished with 14 points and was
effective when he got the ball,
converting on six of seven field
goal attempts. "When I got the
ball, I did pretty well, but they
said they couldn't make the

passes.
The technical preceding the
Cardinal's 11-point streak was
called on Stanford coach Tom
Davis, and itfiredupthecrowd
as well as the Cardinal, a por
tion of the 2552 fans signaling
in the stands to
snow their disgust.
The call was made when
Davis rushed onto the court
after Mellon delivered a shot to
Andy Fischer's nose, which
was broken just two weeks ago
in a game. Fischer was also de
cked with an elbow to the back
of his head by Temple's B.J.
Jones in the finals of the Stan
ford Invitational in December.
"FHecaught me with hisfistin
the nose," said Fischer of his
latest blow. "I was disgusted. I
couldn't believe it was happen
ing, I can't believe my luck, the
ball hits me in the face in shoot
ing practice." Fischer finished
with 10 points on five of six
shooting from the field.
The Cardinal matched the
Wildcats' sloppi ness in the first
half,converting 12 turnovers to

equal UA's halftime total and
led by just six, 47-41. Jones had
15 at halftime.
