# Revelli lost for season
## 
### MARK ZEIGLER 
Stanford basketball coach Tom Davis will
not have to worry about fielding anymore
questions about the status of John Revelli and
his injuries. Revelli is gone.
Dr. Gordon Campbell pronounced Revel
li's 1983 basketball season dead this after
noon at Stanford Medical Center, two days
after the 6-foot-7 bull of a player was floored
with a knee injury against Arizona State.
Campbell said Revelli tore the "medial col
lateral ligament in his right knee," an injury
that will require surgery.
However, the Cardinal's top player is ex
pected to make a complete recovery and re
turn to action next season. As Stanford's lead
ing scorer and rebounder, Revelli averaged
19.1 points and 7.8 boards a game. He also
shot at a 67.1 percentage from the field and a
72.9 clip from the free throw line.
"At first, it's kind of like a bad dream," said
Revelli, who was returning from an ankle in
jury for the first time when he was felled
Saturday with the torn knee ligaments. "But
I'm starting to realize that it's just one of
those things you can't do anything about."
For Davis, it's not "kind of like," but is an
honest-to-god nightmare. "With John being
so important to this program, it (his injury)
has caused all kinds of problems."
One of those problems is finding a re
placement at center. With 6-10 David
Nussbaum also gone for the season with a

broken foot, Davis must feel like taking out
want-ads in local papers.
"I'm going to have to play (6-5 Earl) Kober
lin at center," Davis announced reluctantly
after last night's game. "I think he's my best
available center."
Hans Wichary, a 6-9 junior, will remain at
forward, where he has helped pick up the
slack for the Card in the absence of Revelli.
Davis said Steve Brown would probably fill in
for Koberlin at his now vacant short forward
position. Brown is on the shorter side of 6-1.
"You take a guy like Revelli out of the line
up and you get smaller at two positions," the
Card coach lamented.
At least Davis cannot blame himself for en
ding Revelli's season. Both Davis and Revelli
agree the fall was not caused by over
compensating for his injured left ankle.
"It was just a pure cross borly block that
john never saw," Davis said, describing how
ASU's Paul Williams unintentionally "clip
ped" Revelli at the 10:43 mark in the second
half. "It was a freak thing. There was nothing
you could do to prevent it."
"It was a rebound and a pile-up under
neath," Revelli said. "And then someone
from their team fell back on my knee."
Despite the freakishness of the injury and
its possibly devastating effects on the team,
Davis has no choice but to take a Revelli-less
season in stride. "We've just got to play."
