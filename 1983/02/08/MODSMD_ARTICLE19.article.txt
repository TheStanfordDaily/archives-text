## ACT's version of Loot perverse – but not in right sense 
### LAURENCE MASLON 
loe Orton was committed to
s hocking people who had a
more genteel sensibility than
his own — a group which
would comprise roughly 99
percent of the world's
Populace.
Orton was a British playw
right who wrote a trio of plays
in the mid-sixties which have
since found a secure place in
the repertoire of world drama.
Entertaining Mr. Sloan, Loot
and What the Butler Saw are
the works of a major satirist, an
outrageous but perceptive
young man whose aim was to
devastate society's pretensions
by hitting them full force with a
combination of shocking mor
bidity and shattering humor.
He was no less clever with
the plots of his black com
edies. Sloane is about the at
tempts of a brother and a sister
to seduce the young man who
is their father's murderer. Or
ton's own life read like a similar
scenario. Beginning with the
imprisonment of himself and
his homosexual lover for
lewdly defaming 83 library
books, Orton revelled in any
notoriety that came his way, a
notoriety which grew to en
compass international fame,
an unfilmed screenplay of the
Beatles and a tragic end at 34,
when he was bludgeoned to
death by his lover, who was
jealous of Orton's fame. As
Oscar Wilde, Orton's true pre
decessor said, "Life imitates
art."
Loot may well be Orton's
masterpiece. A spoof of
whodunnits on the surface, it

manages to lacerate religion, fi
lial piety, the police, the law,
love and respectability while
carrying out the complex
mechinations of its plot. Hal
and Dennis are a pair of amoral
18 years olds ("Dennis: I was
innocent until I met you. Hal:
Vou met me when you were
three days old.") who besides
being bank robbers, are also
lovers. They attempt to hide
the considerable gains ot a re
cent heist in the coffin of Hal's
recently deceased mother.
The "Freudian Nightmare"
of getting rid of the corpse is
complicated by two characters
who keep sticking their noses
— and who knows what else —
into the action. There is Fay,
the pious, erotic, gold-digging
nurse of Hal's mum, and In
spector Truscott, a hyperboli
cally corrupt officer of the
yard, who hides beneath the
lame disguise of a member of
the Water Board. The play al
ternates between the comic
business of disposing the
corpse — not easy, as glass
eyes and false teeth keep flying
around the set — and the
pointed hilarity of the paradox
ical dialogue and blissfully
amoral characterizations.
Not the usual fair for ACT,
whose season this year is so full
of old chestnuts and tepid of
ferings that the Geary Theater
threatens to turn into one large
marron glacee. When one third
of the audience audibly gasps
at hearing the "F — word", you
know you're in for trouble.
Alas, the production of an in
cendiary play failed to fan any
needed flames, tor although all
the shocking words were

there, the play was not. There
are some plays that can get
away with being only outrage
ous, or only farcical, but Loot is
not one of them. It is not really
a farce, but a comedy of man
ners. The truth and humor of
this play — or of any decent
comedy of manners — comes
from the frisson between the
way people want to act and the
way society wants them to act.
Respectability and social
mores are ninepins that must
first be set up before they can
be knocked down.
Orton makes his characters
— scoundrels all — behind
such cloaks as religion (as Fay
says, "Had euthenasia not
been against my religion, I
would have practiced it. In
stead, I decided to murder
her.") or the law (Truscott:
"We have a saying down at the
station: 'Waste time on the
truth and you'll be pounding
the beat until the day you re
tire.' ") In order for the satire
of the play to work, the charac
ters must believe in their
bizarre morals, not make fun of
them.
Unfortunately, Ken Ruta's
direction violates this basic
rule. Although some of his
comic business is good, he di
rects the play for every cheap
laugh rather than for its wit and
sophistication. As a result, in
the middle of the already con
fusing second act, the audi
ence gives up — they have no
thing to hold onto. It may seem
hard to believe that a scene in
which someone is trundling
their dead mother about as a
sewing dummy could be bor
ing, but it was.

All the actors were abused by
this approach, and were forced
to deliver most of their witty
lines straight out to the house,
without regard to what they
mean. The worst offender is
Sydney Walker, ordinarily a
brilliant comic, who contri
butes buffoonery to Truscott
when wit and intelligence are
called for. Sally Smythe as Fay
has some suitable slinky mo
ments, but cannot muster up
Fay's religious monomania.
Only Ray Reinhart, as Hal's
long-suffering father, comes
close to the proper playing
style, but as his fellow actors
plunge deeper into the depths
of buffoonery, he throws in the
towel in the act and dives in
himself.
Two questions puzzle me.
Why wasn't the play updated to
1982 instead of keeping it in the
never-never land of 1966, the
year of the play's creation? This
could have been done without
changing a line and would have
made the play more accessible.
The more puzzling and disturb
ing question is why no one
read the long program note
about Orton in which he is
quoted: "Unless Loot is acted
seriously, the play will fail."?
As most deceased playwrights
rarely leave any guidelines
about their productions, direc
tors have to use their instinct
and some research in order to
find the proper style for a play.
But not to listen to common
sense, or the playwright's crys
tal clear printed intentions is
simply perverse. And this is
one kind of perversity tha joe
Orton would not have been in
terested in.

rarely leave any guidelines
about their productions, direc
tors have to use their instinct
and some research in order to
find the proper style for a play.
But not to listen to common
sense, or the playwright's crys
tal clear printed intentions is
simply perverse. And this is
one kind of perversity tha joe
Orton would not have been in
terested in.

loe Orton was committed to
s hocking people who had a
more genteel sensibility than
his own — a group which
would comprise roughly 99
percent of the world's
Populace.
Orton was a British playw
right who wrote a trio of plays
in the mid-sixties which have
since found a secure place in
the repertoire of world drama.
Entertaining Mr. Sloan, Loot
and What the Butler Saw are
the works of a major satirist, an
outrageous but perceptive
young man whose aim was to
devastate society's pretensions
by hitting them full force with a
combination of shocking mor
bidity and shattering humor.
He was no less clever with
the plots of his black com
edies. Sloane is about the at
tempts of a brother and a sister
to seduce the young man who
is their father's murderer. Or
ton's own life read like a similar
scenario. Beginning with the
imprisonment of himself and
his homosexual lover for
lewdly defaming 83 library
books, Orton revelled in any
notoriety that came his way, a
notoriety which grew to en
compass international fame,
an unfilmed screenplay of the
Beatles and a tragic end at 34,
when he was bludgeoned to
death by his lover, who was
jealous of Orton's fame. As
Oscar Wilde, Orton's true pre
decessor said, "Life imitates
art."
Loot may well be Orton's
masterpiece. A spoof of
whodunnits on the surface, it

manages to lacerate religion, fi
lial piety, the police, the law,
love and respectability while
carrying out the complex
mechinations of its plot. Hal
and Dennis are a pair of amoral
18 years olds ("Dennis: I was
innocent until I met you. Hal:
Vou met me when you were
three days old.") who besides
being bank robbers, are also
lovers. They attempt to hide
the considerable gains ot a re
cent heist in the coffin of Hal's
recently deceased mother.
The "Freudian Nightmare"
of getting rid of the corpse is
complicated by two characters
who keep sticking their noses
— and who knows what else —
into the action. There is Fay,
the pious, erotic, gold-digging
nurse of Hal's mum, and In
spector Truscott, a hyperboli
cally corrupt officer of the
yard, who hides beneath the
lame disguise of a member of
the Water Board. The play al
ternates between the comic
business of disposing the
corpse — not easy, as glass
eyes and false teeth keep flying
around the set — and the
pointed hilarity of the paradox
ical dialogue and blissfully
amoral characterizations.
Not the usual fair for ACT,
whose season this year is so full
of old chestnuts and tepid of
ferings that the Geary Theater
threatens to turn into one large
marron glacee. When one third
of the audience audibly gasps
at hearing the "F — word", you
know you're in for trouble.
Alas, the production of an in
cendiary play failed to fan any
needed flames, tor although all
the shocking words were

there, the play was not. There
are some plays that can get
away with being only outrage
ous, or only farcical, but Loot is
not one of them. It is not really
a farce, but a comedy of man
ners. The truth and humor of
this play — or of any decent
comedy of manners — comes
from the frisson between the
way people want to act and the
way society wants them to act.
Respectability and social
mores are ninepins that must
first be set up before they can
be knocked down.
Orton makes his characters
— scoundrels all — behind
such cloaks as religion (as Fay
says, "Had euthenasia not
been against my religion, I
would have practiced it. In
stead, I decided to murder
her.") or the law (Truscott:
"We have a saying down at the
station: 'Waste time on the
truth and you'll be pounding
the beat until the day you re
tire.' ") In order for the satire
of the play to work, the charac
ters must believe in their
bizarre morals, not make fun of
them.
Unfortunately, Ken Ruta's
direction violates this basic
rule. Although some of his
comic business is good, he di
rects the play for every cheap
laugh rather than for its wit and
sophistication. As a result, in
the middle of the already con
fusing second act, the audi
ence gives up — they have no
thing to hold onto. It may seem
hard to believe that a scene in
which someone is trundling
their dead mother about as a
sewing dummy could be bor
ing, but it was.

All the actors were abused by
this approach, and were forced
to deliver most of their witty
lines straight out to the house,
without regard to what they
mean. The worst offender is
Sydney Walker, ordinarily a
brilliant comic, who contri
butes buffoonery to Truscott
when wit and intelligence are
called for. Sally Smythe as Fay
has some suitable slinky mo
ments, but cannot muster up
Fay's religious monomania.
Only Ray Reinhart, as Hal's
long-suffering father, comes
close to the proper playing
style, but as his fellow actors
plunge deeper into the depths
of buffoonery, he throws in the
towel in the act and dives in
himself.
Two questions puzzle me.
Why wasn't the play updated to
1982 instead of keeping it in the
never-never land of 1966, the
year of the play's creation? This
could have been done without
changing a line and would have
made the play more accessible.
The more puzzling and disturb
ing question is why no one
read the long program note
about Orton in which he is
quoted: "Unless Loot is acted
seriously, the play will fail."?
As most deceased playwrights
