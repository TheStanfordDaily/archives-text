# Room rates to increase 14.5 percent
## Tuition hike less than expected 
### KAREN SPRINGEN 
The basic room rate for 1983-84 will
rise a hefty 14.5 percent largely be
cause of costs incurred from con
struction of Governor's Corner, but
tuition for next year will increase
only percent — less than the 12
percent forecasted and less than the
15.1 percent hike last year, pending
approval by the board of trustees to
day.
The reason for the smaller than ex
pet ted increase in tuition was the
decline in the inflation rate.
According to Tim Warner, as
sociate provost for the Office of
Management and Budget, if the Uni
versity had not built the new dor
mitories, the average room rate hike
would have been 6 or 7 percent
rather than 14.5 percent.
The Office of Management and
Budget and Housing and Food Ser
vices announced their recommenda
tions yesterday, coinciding with the
board of trustees meeting this after
noon. Traditionally the board ap
proves all tuition, room and board
recommendations from those two
offices.
Tuition, room and board rates for
1985-84 will rise an average of 10.3
percent, according to Warner.
Next year tuition will rise from
$8220 to $9027. In the Med School,
tuition will rise from $9591 to $10,530,
an increase of 9.8 percent, and in the
Law School it will go up by 9.7 per
cent, from $8370 to $9178.
"This increase will allow us to
maintain the fundamental program
and support services," Warner said.
The University borrowed $36 mill
ion to finance Governor's Corner, As
a result room rates reflect a nearly $4
million annual debt service, which
will create planned operation budget
deficits through 1985. However, $2
million in accumulated reserves will
finance the first two years of deficits.
This year the deficit is estimated to
be $646,000 and next year the
shortfall will grow to about

$1,258,000. In 1984-85 the deficit will
be reduced to about $46,000.
The University will raise room and
board rates an average of 11.4 per
cent. The basic room rate will in
crease from $3812 to $4423, and the
board rate for 19 meals will increase
8.9 percent — from $1729 to $2083.
In response to the room rate in
crease announced yesterday, nine
graduate students, including Eric
Berg, a member of the Task Group on
Housing Rates, blasted the Universi
ty's inequitable treatment of
graduate students in a statement of
the 1983-84 increase in campus hous
ing rates.
Meanwhile, Warner said cost in
creases for students should diminish
in the future, because of the antici
pated decrease in the inflation rate,
budget reductions and lower salary
and utility growth rates.
The tuition increase will not affect
the number of applicants, Warner
said. As evidence he pointed to the
record 14,500 people who applied for
undergraduate admission this year
despite an overall increase of slightly
more than 15 percent.
Warner said that the University's
continued commitment to aid-blind
admissions policy is one ot the
reasons the increase in expenses has
not reduced the number of applic
ants. Because of the hike in ex

penses, Warner estimated that the
University will have to contribute an
additional $1.9 million to financial aid
fund.
Studies show that students who
are accepted and then decide to at
tend other schools, go to universities
with comparable expenses rather
than to lower-cost institutions.
The University's increase, in rela
tion to similar institutions, is in the
"middle of the pack" nationally,
Warner said. But he added, "We
don't compare planning notes with
other universities. . . basically it's an
internal decision."
Combined expenses at Harvard
will rise by 8.7 percent from $12,000
t0513,150, the smallest percentage in
four years.
Increases at comparable institu
tions such as Brown, Columbia, Cor
nell, Dartmouth, MIT, the University
of Pennsylvania, Princeton and Yale
range from 8.4 to 12.6 percent.
Housing and Food Services is cur
rently setting only one room and
board rate.
The Task Force on Housing Rates,
which has been meeting for the past
seven months, just finalized its re
port last week, according to Ed
Stoles, director ot housing and food
service.
He said the 1983-84 food service

food service task force recommenda

Quadrangle will probably offer a
pay-for-what-you-eat meal plan on a
volunteer basis next year when it
opens.
The housing office is considering
increasing the $50 housing deposit
here, which Scoles said is small rela
tive to other universities.

Housing and Food Services will re
duce its base expenditures 2.5 per
cent or about $400,000, Scoles said.
He declined to speculate on the
specific areas where reductions
would be made, only saying that the
"area of services" might be cut.
Linda Mclntyre, financial analyst
for Facilities and Services, said the
University would attempt to reduce
its electricity use — the rates for
which are estimated to grow by 17.9
percent above inflation.
"A lot is just so dependent on ex

The reason for the smaller than ex
pet ted increase in tuition was the
decline in the inflation rate.
According to Tim Warner, as
sociate provost for the Office of
Management and Budget, if the Uni
versity had not built the new dor
mitories, the average room rate hike
would have been 6 or 7 percent
rather than 14.5 percent.
The Office of Management and
Budget and Housing and Food Ser
vices announced their recommenda
tions yesterday, coinciding with the
board of trustees meeting this after
noon. Traditionally the board ap
proves all tuition, room and board
recommendations from those two
offices.
Tuition, room and board rates for
1985-84 will rise an average of 10.3
percent, according to Warner.
Next year tuition will rise from
$8220 to $9027. In the Med School,
tuition will rise from $9591 to $10,530,
an increase of 9.8 percent, and in the
Law School it will go up by 9.7 per
cent, from $8370 to $9178.
"This increase will allow us to
maintain the fundamental program
and support services," Warner said.
The University borrowed $36 mill
ion to finance Governor's Corner, As
a result room rates reflect a nearly $4
million annual debt service, which
will create planned operation budget
deficits through 1985. However, $2
million in accumulated reserves will
finance the first two years of deficits.
This year the deficit is estimated to
be $646,000 and next year the
shortfall will grow to about

$1,258,000. In 1984-85 the deficit will
be reduced to about $46,000.
The University will raise room and
board rates an average of 11.4 per
cent. The basic room rate will in
crease from $3812 to $4423, and the
board rate for 19 meals will increase
8.9 percent — from $1729 to $2083.
In response to the room rate in
crease announced yesterday, nine
graduate students, including Eric
Berg, a member of the Task Group on
Housing Rates, blasted the Universi
ty's inequitable treatment of
graduate students in a statement of
the 1983-84 increase in campus hous
ing rates.
Meanwhile, Warner said cost in
creases for students should diminish
in the future, because of the antici
pated decrease in the inflation rate,
budget reductions and lower salary
and utility growth rates.
The tuition increase will not affect
the number of applicants, Warner
said. As evidence he pointed to the
record 14,500 people who applied for
undergraduate admission this year
despite an overall increase of slightly
more than 15 percent.
Warner said that the University's
continued commitment to aid-blind
admissions policy is one ot the
reasons the increase in expenses has
not reduced the number of applic
ants. Because of the hike in ex

penses, Warner estimated that the
University will have to contribute an
additional $1.9 million to financial aid
fund.
Studies show that students who
are accepted and then decide to at
tend other schools, go to universities
with comparable expenses rather
than to lower-cost institutions.
The University's increase, in rela
tion to similar institutions, is in the
"middle of the pack" nationally,
Warner said. But he added, "We
don't compare planning notes with
other universities. . . basically it's an
internal decision."
Combined expenses at Harvard
will rise by 8.7 percent from $12,000
t0513,150, the smallest percentage in
four years.
Increases at comparable institu
tions such as Brown, Columbia, Cor
nell, Dartmouth, MIT, the University
of Pennsylvania, Princeton and Yale
range from 8.4 to 12.6 percent.
Housing and Food Services is cur
rently setting only one room and
board rate.
The Task Force on Housing Rates,
which has been meeting for the past
seven months, just finalized its re
port last week, according to Ed
Stoles, director ot housing and food
service.
He said the 1983-84 food service

food service task force recommenda
tions. He added that the Sterling
Quadrangle will probably offer a
pay-for-what-you-eat meal plan on a
volunteer basis next year when it
opens.
The housing office is considering
increasing the $50 housing deposit
here, which Scoles said is small rela
tive to other universities.

Housing and Food Services will re
duce its base expenditures 2.5 per
cent or about $400,000, Scoles said.
He declined to speculate on the
specific areas where reductions
would be made, only saying that the
"area of services" might be cut.
Linda Mclntyre, financial analyst
for Facilities and Services, said the
University would attempt to reduce
its electricity use — the rates for
which are estimated to grow by 17.9
percent above inflation.
"A lot is just so dependent on ex
ternal events," Warner said.
The basic room rate for 1983-84 will
rise a hefty 14.5 percent largely be
cause of costs incurred from con
struction of Governor's Corner, but
tuition for next year will increase
only percent — less than the 12
percent forecasted and less than the
15.1 percent hike last year, pending
approval by the board of trustees to
day.
