# Look backwards in your record collection: the Squeeze break-up album
## 
### STEFAN MALMOLI 
Whenever a band breaks up, it causes much sorrow
for the fans of that band. Whether it was the Beatles in
1970 or the Eagles in 1981, it is a time to reflect upon the
worth of the band's musical output. No matter how
successful the individual members become, it still
brings much sadness to the band's loyal following.
Therefore, when the English band Squeeze announced
that its "horse had run its course," I was deeply disap
pointed. As a resident of New York City where Squeeze
had a huge following (large enough to sell out Madison
Square Gardens), I always hoped that they would break
out nationally.
However, although the group occasionally garnered
some airplay with "Tempted" and "Black Coffee in
Bed," they never really succeeded in attracting a

nationwide popularity. The most ironic sadness though,
is that with this final album release of Squeeze's greatest
hits, called Singles. 45's and Under, Squeeze may have
finally won over an audience that hadn't been open to
accepting the band.
But why was Squeeze a band deserving of national
popularity and what exactly was Squeeze's musical
worth? To start off, there must have been some reason
why Squeeze's songwriting partnership of Glenn Til
brook and Chris Difford was continually being com
pared to the partnership of Lennon and McCartney.
Basically, Squeeze's songs were as catchy and poppy,
yet still as noteworthy, original and exciting as any early
Beatles' tune. Squeeze came across as a vibrant, energe
tic, young band whose musical mission was to represent
the carefree, exuberant qualities of rock and roll.
Through their fine musicianship and excellent fusion of

varied musical styles (as diverse as from the Beatles to
Motown to British electro-pop), Squeeze was one of the
brightest bands to emerge from the New Wave explo
sion. Their albums continually improved as they gained
touring confidence (especially after opening up for Elvis
Costello's 1980 U.S. tour), and they soon grew to be
come a favorite of both critics and fellow musicians (Paul
McCartney, Dave Edmunds, and Elvis Costello have all
praised the band). However, the band felt it had ac
complished all that it could. Therefore, all we are left
with is this excellent (often brilliant) synopsis of the
music and life of a Squeeze.
The album's first side consists of some early Squeeze
tracks that reflect the English punk movement with a
humor and lightness that was quite unique. On.such
early, lusty tracks as A "Slap and Tickle," "Take Me, I'm

Yours" and "Cool for Cats," thick English accents are set
against appealing musical rhythms. It was from these
initial effervescent and witty tunes that the band ex
panded and matured into wider and more diverse styles
of music.
This more mature style is confidently displayed on the
tracks that are culled from Squeeze's breakthrough 1980
album, Argy Bargy. This album contained the definitive
Squeeze tracks "Pulling Mussels (From a Shell)," "If I
Didn't Love You," and "Another Nail in My Heart,"
which are included on Singles, 45's and Under. These
songs represent the style and excellence that was to
continue in Squeeze's music up to the present. These
songs show the band's exuberance and jocularity.
