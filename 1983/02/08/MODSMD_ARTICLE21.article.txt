# Ellen Sebastian's sentimental journey
## 
### LUKE COLE 
Imaginative. Innovative. In
triguing. Ellen Sebastian's play,
Your /'/ace is No Longer witt.
Us, is all ot these and more — a
fascinating journey through
the world of a 10-year-old girl
caught between the glamour
and excitement of her fantasies
and the practicality and sensi
bility of her mother.
When I arrived at the old Vic
torian house in the Haight dis
trict of S;in Francisco last Friday
night, atter a iong search for a
parking spot and a run through
the ra<n, I did not know whatto
expect. • was ushered into the
living room — the play takes
place in a private house, the
location ot which is a closely
guarded secret — and took my
seat along with about 30 other
oeopie, most of whom looked
as curious and bewildered as I
was. I had heard a little about
the play, that it was "Apart
ment Theater," each scene tak

ing place in a different part of
the house with the audience
following the actors and ac
tresses from one room to the
next. Admittedly, I was a little
skeptical of the whole idea.
I was more than pleasantly
surprised. From the first scene
on I was captivated as we trek
ked Trom room to room, each
new locale unfolding another
facet and perplexity, both en
lightening the audience and
drawing them further into the
play.
Zorana Edun, as Dee, the
young black girl who is the
focus of the work, is superb; at
ten years old, she is already a
mature actress. Her poise and
presence are fantastic, and one
can feel her inner conflict bet
ween the sophisticated world
presented to her in her fan
tasies and the down-home real
ity of life with Mama.
The play opens with the con

frontation of these two worlds,
as Dee argues offstage in the
kitchen with her mother over a
radio show. "But Mama, it's
Shakespeare!" pleads Dee,
and Mama replies, "You just
shake it right off, then." As Dee
leaves the kitchen, and comes
onstage for the first time, she
leaves the sheltered and pre
dictable world of her mother to
explore the exciting and some
times frightening realm of her
imagination. She has help in
this from two other actresses
and a young actor, all white,
who tempt her with the forbid
den fruits of opera singing,
dressing up, and Shakespeare,
among others.
Mark Gorney gives a strong
performance as the bright and
somewhat mischievous boy,
one of Dee's playmates. His
best scene is one in which he
imitates a variety ot windshield
wipers, complete with sound

effects; though he looks like
heis about 13 (heis 16), Gorney
is as good as or better than
many actors with twice his age
and experience. Jan Zvaifler
plays a demented and malevo
lent character, who in one
scene in the "Lingerie Maze"
ties Dee up in lingerie,
blindfolding her with a bra as
the final touch. Zvaifler's
character fits very well with the
bizarre and dramatic sets, de
signed by jack Carpenter, and
both serve to complement
each other and add depth to
the play.
In a stunning entrance, Ja
neen Wyatt as the opera singer
also shows off the marvelous
effects generated by Car
penter: she is singing in a
bathtub full of bubbles, with
musical notes flashed on her
face and surroundings from a
slide projector. The effect is
striking, and the rest of Car

penter's additions to the show,
which include the Eno-esque
soundtrack, are equally
superb.
Throughout her forays into
the upstairs rooms of the
house, which symbolize her
forbidden fantasies, Dee is ch
ased by her mother's voice ("I
can't see what you're doin','
but God can! '). In the final
scene, which takes place in the
kitchen and in which we finally
see Mama, Dee tries to explain
what she has seen, but Mama
will have nothing of it. The play
concludes with Mama's ser
mon on common sense, with a
gospel tape playing in the
background. As Mama, played
by Adilah, is talking to Dee, she
is also preparing a dinner of
black-eyed peas and
cornbread, which turns out to
be for the audience — another
twist which makes one come
away feeling impressed with
the production.
Ellen Sebastian started the
production about a year ago,
after similar experiments she
had seen done in France.
"Apartment Theatre" gives a
play a great deal of flexibility
with relatively complex sets, as
the audience, not the sets, is
moved between acts and
scenes.
According to Sebastian, Your
Place is No Longer Wi(h Us is
"autobiographical in sensibil
ity but not in reality" — she was
the daughter of a white mother
and a black father, and spent
the first 13 years of her life liv
ing with her black grand
mother, who provided the
basis for the character of
Mama. The sophisticated/
practical dichotomy in the play
mirrored the meeting of the
two world in Ellen Sebastian's
life, and the play is a resuit of
her own journey of discov
ery.
Whatever its background, it
is well worth seeing. I admire
Sebastian's courage to attempt
"Apartment Theatre," which <s
an exciting innovation, and I
applaud her first rate produc
tion — it is easily the best play I
have seen in recent years. Your
Place is no Longer With Us is
sold out through the rest of its
run at its present iocation, but
Sebastian and Assistant to the
Director Pam Nissley are
searching tor another private
house to usurp toi another run
in the Ray Area. I wish them
luck.
