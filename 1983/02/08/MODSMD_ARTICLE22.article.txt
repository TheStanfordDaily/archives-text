# Still zing in Count's swing

### LUKE COLE 
Cigars and fur coats
abounded in the Fairmont's
Venetian Room last Thurs
day night, as the legendary
Count Basie rolled back into
town. The plush Venetian
Room provided an ideal
showcase, lending a sophis
ticated air to the evening as
the Count and his 17-man
orchestra played new tunes
and old favorites for an ap
preciative audience
I he arrival of Count Basie
is just part of the sequence
of jazz greats who are ap
pearing at the I airmont this
spring: Dizzy Gillespie, The
Kingston Trio, and Ella
Fitzgerald are all scheduled
for shows in the coming
months.
The Count Basie Or
chestra began in 1936, and
"made it big'' in the early
'40s, becoming the first
black band to play New York
City's Roxy Theater. Over
the years, Basie has built his
band's reputation, winning
numerous awards and
acclaims and recording over
twenty albums. Though he
is in his late 70s, the Count
continues to tour the Un
ited States and the world,
most recently returning
from Japan.
The Count showed his
age as he had to be helped
up the stairs to the stage and
onto the piano bench, but
he was still lively and iucid.
The orchestra opened with
the perennial favorite
"Sweet Georgia Brown,"
which featured a solo by Eric
Schneider on saxophone.
"This one we recorded 40
years ago," said Basie as the
band broke into "Ja Da,"
with Eric Dixon playing a
soulful flute number. J J.
Johnson's "Lament" was
next, and one could quickly
pick out the orchestra's
style: one or more soloists
per song, with the Count
providing a running com
mentary from behind his
piano.
"Warm Breeze" was the
first song in which we heard
the Count's kevboard ex
pertise, as he delicately
maneuvered through this

rousing number. Bob
Summers rampaged
through a trumpet solo as
the band picked up thepace
with a tune dedicated to the
audience: "They'll Never Be
Another You."
"Good Time Blues" was a
duel between Basie on the
piano and Cleveland Eaton
on the bass, with the
drummer keeping time.
Eaton's pizzicato furor eli
cited great facial expres
sions from the Count, much
to the amusement of the
crowd.
Basie kept up his antics as
he introduced guitarist
Freddie Green, a veteran of
68 years with the Count.
"Freddie here has never
played a solo in all those
years, but maybe if I get the
intro just right," said the
Count, as Green played the
straight man and sat expres
sionless in front of the
piano. After several more
minutes of build-up and
banter, Freddie finally
played his "solo" — one
sweeping chord, which
drew him great applause
from the audience.
The vocalist, Dennis Row
land, now joined the band
The supreme showman,
strutting and sporting a red
bow-tie, Rowland first sang
"On the Street Where You
Live" and then swung into
"Watch What Happens."
"Lucky so and so" showed
off the depth and richness
of Rowland's voice, as he
weaved in and out of the
first few tables of admiring
listeners. After getting the
whole audience clapping in
time for "Every Day," Row
land left and the orchestra
went into its last tune, their
theme song, "One O'Clock
Jump."
The encore, "Jumping at
the Woodside," showcased
different band members in
short solos and was gener
ally an all out grand slam
finale — a fitting end to an
evening of great jazz.
And though the show was
short — only a little over an
hour — it was most deti
nitely sweet, and proved
that at 78, the Count still has
zing in his swing.
