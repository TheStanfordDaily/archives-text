# Books — not just for classwork anymore
## 
### 
Books - everybody reads them! Books -
broaden your horizons! Books - brighten
your dinner conversation! Books - fill those
lonely nights! Books - help you level out
your coffee table's legs!

Yes, I know all that, you say, but what
can I do to help? I'm no world-famous
author, you know! Well, you may not be
the toast of the literary circuit, but you can
do something even better — you can
criticize their work! The Stanford Daily is
looking for a few good — well, a lot of
good, but we'll settle for a few — book
reviewers for it's newly moribund books
department. If you've recently read a book
you think deserves comment, why not do

it in print, where one of the largest com
munities of intellectuals ever gathered in
one place can read what you think and
systematically destroy your insights. Also,
you get to see your name at the end of the
article
IN PRINT THIS BIG
so why not stop by the Daily and see Chris
Butchko and say "Hey, I want to be a Daily
book critic." He'll be glad you did.
