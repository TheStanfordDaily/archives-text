### ALAN TRIPP Senior staff writer 
Following a critical evaluation made by a
national regulatory agency, the manager of
the Stanford Federal Credit Union has been
fired and four members of the board of di
rectors have resigned.
Theshake-up, prompted by a report made
by the National Credit Union Administration
(NCUA), will not affect the security of the
union's more than 31,000 accounts accord
ing to Lucile Marabilla, president of the cre
dit union board. "What you're seeing is a

reorganization," she said. "I do want to af
firm that the membership's money is not in
any danger."
Former manager Ray Braithwaite, sus
pended from his post Dec. 22, was formally
relieved of his post Feb. 3. He could not be
reached for comment.
Both Marabilla and Joe Melchione, attor
ney for the board of directors and the
NCUA, were reluctant to comment on the
termination. According to Marabill the deci
sion to fire Braithwaite may be contested in
court.

Melchione said that Braithwaite's suspen
sion was a result of the NCUA report. How
ever he added, "We don't wish to try
Braithwaite's termination in the press."
Marabi lla's only comment was that there had
been "management problems."
According to a newsletter published by
Credit Union Information Service of Silver
Springs, Md., the credit union's books were
six toseven months behind and reserves had
been drained bya series nfbad investments.
Barry Jollett, regional director of the
NCUA said that the board of directors had

simply acted to remedy some difficulties
with the credit union.
According to the San lose Mercury News,
one former board member, Elwood Pierce,
director of operations at the School of
Medicine, said, "We wereasked to resign by
the NCUA â€”it was done very coldly. I guess
they felt it (the board) didn't have the proper
leadership. We were given an ultimatum.
They could have closed down the credit un
ion."
Neither Pierce nor the other former board
members could be reached for comment by

the Daily.
Melchione, by contrast, said, "The board
had several alternatives at the time. I don't
understand his (Pierce's) perspective."
According to one employee at the credit
union, who declined to be identified, prob
lems started when the controller was absent
with a prolonged illness. After that some of
the credit union's investments went bad.
Even before Braithwaite took charge three
years ago, over $12 million of the credit un
ion's assets had been invested in long-term
