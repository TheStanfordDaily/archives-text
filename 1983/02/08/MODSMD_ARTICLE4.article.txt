David Packard, chairman of the
board of Hewlett-Packard, and his
wife Lucile pledged gifts totalling $20
million to the new Children's Hospi
tal at Stanford, University President
Donald Kennedy announced yester
day.
The Packard's donation will pro
vide approximately half the cost of
construction for the new facility.
Plans for the new hospital are the
result of an agreement between the
University and existing Children's
Hospital at Stanford (CHAS), an in
dependent organization, to consoli
date the Medical Center's depart
ment of Pediatrics and CHAS.
Thegifts, tobe known as the David
and Lucille Packard New Children's
Hospital Fund, comprise the largest
personal pledge ever received by
either institution.
"I think it's a truly magnificant, al
most unparalled gift, and it will go a
long, long way towards making the
dream of a consolidated Children's

Hospital a reality," said Dr. Lawrence
Crowley, University vice-president
for medical affairs and chairman of
the new CHAS governing board.
Asked why the Packards would de
cide to donate such a large sum of
money to the new facility, Kenneth
Sayre, chairman of the original CHAS
board and tresurer of the new board,
said, "Lucile has been working with
us for 15 years.
"They're very generous people
and do lots of good things for the
community. I just think that's the
kind of people they are," he added.
Lucile Packard, a Stanford alumna,
is vice-chairman of both the original
and new CHAS boards. Her husband
David, is alsoa Stanford alumnus and
former trustee.
Under the conditions of the
pledge, the University will supply the
remainder of the $40 million neces
sary for construction, primarily
through fund-raising.
