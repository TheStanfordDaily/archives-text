# Stadium facelift due
## 
### KRISTEN BROWN 
The Stanford Stadium will gain
about a $1 million in long needed
renovations in return for hosting the
National Football League's Super
Bowl XIX rent-free in 1985. Half of the
improvements, an estimated
$500,000, will be paid for by the NFL
and the other half will be raised by a
team of Bay Area fundraisers includ
ing a representative from Stanford.
Shortly after the NFL formally an
nounced Super Bowl XlX's playing
site, University Athletic Director
Andy Geiger said, "It gives u.i a
chance to accelerate our deferred
maintenance program for the
stadium."
According to Allen Cummmgs,
senior associate director of athletics,
the University is in the beginning
stages of deciding exactly what im
provements need to be made.
Cummings said the tentative list of
improvements includes improving
the upper level restrooms, the con
cession area, the directional signs,
the sound system and adding a per

manent ticket facility at the stadium's
south end. The NFL will also arrange
tor temporary light installations be
cause the game will be played in the
late afternoon.
Quentin Kopp, a member of the
San Francisco Board of Supervisors,
who was instrumental in bringing the
Super Bowl to Stanford, said about
the NFL's contribution to the
Stadium in an earlier Daily interview,
"They don't want it to be a one-time
expenditure."
According to Kopp, the league will
likely include Stanford in its informal
"rotation" of Super Bowl sites.
When asked whether or not the
NFL would prefer regular seats to the
current stadium benches, CUM
MINGS STRESSED, "Weare under no
commitment to —and have nointen
tion of — replacing the seating."
Cummings also said that the cur
rent field is considered one of the
best in the country and that the athle
tic department has no intention of
replacing it with artificial turf.
The new locker room, press room
and bathroom facilities will probably
be the most visible stadium addi
tions.
Senior cornerback Kevin Baird
drew a typical half-time picture:
"The defensive team goes to the
track storage room — moves pole
vaults and hurdles aside. On a cold,
rainy day we freeze at half-time. We
don't even have any heating."
The inadequate shack size, cur
rently used as the half-time meeting
room, also causes discomfort, espe
cially when both the offensive and
defensive teams crowd into the same
shack for the last few half-time mo
ments.
"A lot of guys have to stand and
peer in from around corners," said
sophomore team member Jeff Arril
laga.
The new facility will do more than
simply make the football team's

half-time more comfortable, accord
ing to some players.
"As far as recruiting goes, the facil
ity will help a whole lot," explained
junior defensive lineman Kevin
Lamar. Lamar visited other University
stadiums before coming to Stanford.
He found that Stanford's stadium
shacks detracted from his opinion of
the Stanford football program —
especially when he compared them
to the South Eastern Conference and
Big 10 schools which build their
stadiums specifically for football.
The University's track program
may also gainfrom the newfacilities.
Geiger has met with Brooks
Johnson, Stanford's track coach, to
find out how the new facility can be
nefit the track team, which has need
for a storage room and team room.
Freshman track runner Ryan Stoll
said, "The way it is now, it's real in
formal, we just dress in our rooms
and meet down at the stadium."

Marty Headland, senior discus
thrower, said having a locker room
would "add to the comraderie when
you can have a place to congregate."
