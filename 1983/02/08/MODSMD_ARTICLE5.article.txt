## 
### KRISTEN BROWN 
The Stanford Stadium will gain
about a $1 million in long needed
renovations in return for hosting the
National Football League's Super
Bowl XIX rent-free in 1985. Half of the
improvements, an estimated
$500,000, will be paid for by the NFL
and the other half will be raised by a
team of Bay Area fundraisers includ
ing a representative from Stanford.
Shortly after the NFL formally an
nounced Super Bowl XlX's playing
site, University Athletic Director
Andy Geiger said, "It gives u.i a
chance to accelerate our deferred
maintenance program for the
stadium."
According to Allen Cummmgs,
senior associate director of athletics,
the University is in the beginning
stages of deciding exactly what im
provements need to be made.
Cummings said the tentative list of
improvements includes improving
the upper level restrooms, the con
cession area, the directional signs,
the sound system and adding a per

manent ticket facility at the stadium's
south end. The NFL will also arrange
tor temporary light installations be
cause the game will be played in the
late afternoon.
Quentin Kopp, a member of the
San Francisco Board of Supervisors,
who was instrumental in bringing the
Super Bowl to Stanford, said about
the NFL's contribution to the
Stadium in an earlier Daily interview,
"They don't want it to be a one-time
expenditure."
According to Kopp, the league will
likely include Stanford in its informal
"rotation" of Super Bowl sites.
When asked whether or not the
NFL would prefer regular seats to the
current stadium benches, CUM
MINGS STRESSED, "Weare under no
commitment to —and have nointen
tion of — replacing the seating."
Cummings also said that the cur
rent field is considered one of the
best in the country and that the athle
tic department has no intention of
replacing it with artificial turf.
