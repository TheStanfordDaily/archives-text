Reagan fires EPA official
Washington — President Reagan, in an unusual move
yesterday aimed at calming turmoil at the Environ
mental Protection Agency, formally fired EPA assis
tant administrator Rita Lavelle, a Californian who had
worked on his personal staff when he was governor
°112 California.
Reagan's announcement that Lavelle had been
terminated" from her position in charge of enforc
mg toxic waste laws came after a weekend of top-level
mternal bickering at the agency over whether EPA ad
ministrator Anne Gorsuch could technically dismiss
' a presidential appointee who was under fire
both in Congress and at EPA. The argumpnt so in-
' p nsified yesterday that Gorsuch ordered two guards

armed with billy clubs to stand watch over tavelle's
offices to make certain neither lavelle nor three
members of her staff who have also been fired do not
remove any "sensitive documents," as EPA spokes
man Chris Rice said. He said use of such guards was a
"standard procedure to ensure an orderly transition
when someone leaves this abruptly."
An official familiar with the details of the incident
said that when Lavelle left Gorsuch's office last Friday
she gathered her staff and, already in tears, told them
that she was out. Some staff members began arguing
that Lavelle's dose ties with the Reagans and her
friendship with White House counselor Edwin Meese
might help spare her job. "These people convinced
her to fight back," the source said
However, the official said Gorsuch had already dis

cussed the need to oust Lavelle at a meeting at the
White House Thursday with President Reagan's cabi
net council on environment and natural resources, a
sub-cabinet group headed by Interior Secretary
lames Watt
Gorsuch reportedly explained to the council that
Lavelle's difficulties included an investigation con
cerning whether Lavelle had lied about trying to fire
an EPA whistleblower
Rep. John Dingell (D-Mich.) chairman of the House
Energy and Commerce Committee, had also warned
Gorsuch last week that "we are reviewing allegations
that the distribution of the Superfund money has
been manipulated for political purposes, and we are
investigating allegations of misconduct and unethical
behavior by an agency official."

Deportation immunity cancelled
An estimated 100,000 Mexican immigrants now living
in the United States have lost their temporary im
munity from deportation.
Although Immigration and Naturalization Service
officials say that they expect no immediate or massive
increases in the number of deportations, the agency's
action, which took effect Feb. 1, has sent shock waves
through the Latino community, particularly since per
sons most drastically affected by the situation are
long-term residents who have had time to put down
roots in the communities where they live.
"The immunity was extended originally last year on
the grounds these people would be covered by legis
lation that had just been passed by the Senate," an im
migration service spokesman in Washington said.
"The immunity ran out on Jan. 31, and to extend it
now, when new legislation has not even been in
troduced, did not seem proper."
Latino leaders said yesterday that they expect to
seek reinstatement of the immunity from deportation
once the immigration bill is reintroduced in the Con
gress this session, possibly within a month's time.
Truce ends mountain fighting
Khalde, Lebanon — An Israeli general said yesterday
that his army would put an end to the factional fight
ing that has turned the mountains near Beirut into a
battlefield for the last four months and that both sides
have agreed to a truce.
Brig. Gen. Amnon Lifkin, summoned to the Leba
nese-lsraeli negotiations at suburban Khalde, said
Christian and Druze leaders signed a pact calling for
an end to the fighting in the Shouf Mountains.
At the time he made the statement, the strategic
mountain town of Aley was quiet after a night of
heavy fighting in which the Druze gained the upper
hand and drove the Christian Falangists out of the
area. Just before nightfall, however, there was an ex
change of rocket and artillery fire between two
nearby villages, one of them Christian, the other
Druze.
It was too early to tell whether the fighting would
escalate, but Lifkin said the Israelis would stop what
ever fighting takes place on the Lebanese territory
they occupy.
"We are doing our best to keep the situation as
calm as possible," Lifkin said. "I don't know if the
agreement is going to be fulfilled. We are going to do
our best to enforce it in the area."
China trip: problems linger
Peking — U.S. Secretary ot State George Shultz ap
parently succeeded in easing Sino-U.S. tensions on
his trip to Peking but pressing bilateral problems re
main unsolved.
After his departure Sunday for South Korea, the of
ficial Chinese news agency Xinhua said Shultz' trip
was successful only "to some extent." It denounced
U.S. arms sales to Taiwan and said China demands
"actual deeds rather than empty words" to improve
relations.
Foreign diplomatic analysts said the talks appeared
to have been very tough but suggested that relations
now might settle on a sound, realisticfooting, without
great expectations or grand strategic designs.
U.S. officials had cautioned in advance that no ma

jor agreements or breakthroughs were expected
from the four days of talks with Chinese leaders who
have accused the United States of unreliability and
seeking to dominate other nations.
Instead, the Americans said, the focus would be on
the overriding, intangible problem of mutual suspi
cion and the blurred relationship between Washing
ton and Peking.
Before Shultz came, one well-informed Chinese
source said the political realtionship had "gone
sour."
But the political air cleared by Saturday night and
Shultz told his farewell banquet: "While problems do
exist, I leave our discussions more convinced of the
real opportunties for enhanced cooperation ... We
depart having set the stage for renewed advances
built on a stronger foundation of confidence and
mutual trust."
Iran hurls largest drive
Nicosia, Cyprus — Iran launched its "final offensive"
against Iraq before dawn yesterday, retaking 100
square miles of Iranian territory and hurling tens of
thousands of troops across the border in its biggest
drive yet.
Iraq confirmed the offensive, but said it completely
crushed two Iranian divisions that crossed into Iraq at
Fakeh, about 180 miles southeast of Baghdad and 100
miles north of Basra.
Iraq said its forces killed 6894 Iranians and took
large numbers of prisoners. Baghdad communiques
claimed that Iraqi warplanes and helicopter gunships
flew 129 missions, "securing complete control of the
skies over the battlefront, inflicting very heavy losses
on enemy tanks and armor, and returning safely to
their bases."
Iraqi leaders said recently that Iran had massed
150,000 troops in the southern sector of the 300-mile
long front line in preparation for the offensive. But
the Saudi newspaper Al-Madina said Saturday as
many as 1 million Iranian troops had been deployed
to invade Iraq's southern Missan province.
Salvadorans use rockets in attack
San Salvador, El Salvador — U.S. officials believe that
the Salvadoran air force used rockets and machine
guns in an aerial attack on the guerrilla-occupied city
of Berlin, U.S. Ambassador Deane Hinton said yester
day.
"We do not believe that bombs fell within the city.
The evidence on this is very good," the envoy as
serted.
"There is evidence, on the other hand, that some
rocket fire, certainly machine gun fire, was delivered

into the city when the air force was flying and trying to
hold off the attackers," he continued. "Probably
shouldn't have been done that way, but it was."
In an interview that focused on military aspects of
the civil war, Hinton also charged that the reluctance
of Congress to fully support Reagan administration
policy has helped prolong the war.
"We need for the Congress to appropriate the
funds that the President requests," the 59-year-old
diplomat insisted.
One of the reasons, I think, the guerrillas took
heart after the sort of down period they had after the
elections last year was when the president asked for
supplementary funds for training another battalion or
two, the Congress didn't give it to him, and I think this
works to prolong the war," Hinton said.
Reagan criticizes Israelis
Washington — Reflecting his frustration over the
stalemate in Middle East negotiations, President Rea
gan said yesterday that Israel was unnecessarily delay
ing removal of its troops from Lebanon and is now
"technically in the position of an occupying force."
The president's comments to a group of Washing
ton-area television reporters were unusual in that he
focused his criticism on the continued presence of
foreign troops in Lebanon on Israel, without the usual
mention of Palestinian and Syrian forces.
Noting the need to get foreign forces out of Leba
non as a prelude to broadened Arab-Israeli peace ne
gotiations, Reagan remarked that "Israel is delaying,
we believe, unnecessarily in that."
A moment later he expanded on the remark saying
". . .There's a certain moral point that we think the Is
raelis are neglecting or not observing. And that is the
new government of Lebanon, after all these years of
revolution and upheaval, has asked all the foreign
forces to leave.
"Forthem notto leave now putsthem technically in
the position of an occupying force, that they are there
by force in this country that has said to them, 'We now
want you to depart.' "
Special U.S. envoy Philip Habib was en route back
to the area yesterday to join in negotiations between
Israeli and Lebanese representatives.
One of the chief hang-ups in the Israeli-Lebanese
talks has reportedly been Israeli insistence upon a
permanent presence at outposts in southern Lebanon
in order to assure security of the border area.
Deukmejian struggles with deficit
Sacramento — Gov. George Deukmejian called for
direct talks with legislative leaders yesterday because
of the "terribly disappointing" legislative impasse on

the deficit.
Deukmejian issued his call after the second in
decisive meeting late yesterday of the conference
committee charged with finding a solution to the $1.5
billion problem.
The Republican governor said that unless the con
ference committee acts on a budget plan by today,
"the state will be forced to pay its bills, tax refunds and
most pay and benefit checks, in registered warrants
by the end of the month."
He said he asked Assembly Speaker Willie Brown
(D-San Francisco) and Senate President Pro Tern
David Roberti (D-Los Angeles) to meet with him this
morning, "to try to resolve this crisis without using
IOUs."
Mt. St. Helens erupts again
Vancouver, Wash. — Mount St. Helens erupted again
yesterday, building a new mound of lava on the 700-
foot high dome in the volcano's crater.
There were no reports of explosions, mudflows or
ash. Officials said they did not know when the erup
tion began.
The eruption was confirmed at about noon yester
day by geologists who flew over the southwest Wash
ington volcano, said Thom Corcoran of the U.S. For
est Service.
Corcoran said a geologist in a fixed-wing airplane
saw a new lobe of lava growing on the east side of the
dome, but that ground crews had yet to confirm it.
On Saturday, the U.S. Geological Survey and the
University of Washington warned that movement
within the crater and gas emissions indicated Mount
St. Helens would erupt within two weeks.
They said an eruption might be accompanied by ex
plosive activity, rapid snow melt and mudflows that
could cascade into Spirit Lake and the Toutle River
drainage. However, the scientists said they foresee no
danger to Spirit Lake or communities downstream.

Reagan criticizes Israelis
Washington — Reflecting his frustration over the
stalemate in Middle East negotiations, President Rea
gan said yesterday that Israel was unnecessarily delay
ing removal of its troops from Lebanon and is now
"technically in the position of an occupying force."
The president's comments to a group of Washing
ton-area television reporters were unusual in that he
focused his criticism on the continued presence of
foreign troops in Lebanon on Israel, without the usual
mention of Palestinian and Syrian forces.
Noting the need to get foreign forces out of Leba
non as a prelude to broadened Arab-Israeli peace ne
gotiations, Reagan remarked that "Israel is delaying,
we believe, unnecessarily in that."
A moment later he expanded on the remark saying
". . .There's a certain moral point that we think the Is
raelis are neglecting or not observing. And that is the
new government of Lebanon, after all these years of
revolution and upheaval, has asked all the foreign
forces to leave.
"Forthem notto leave now putsthem technically in
the position of an occupying force, that they are there
by force in this country that has said to them, 'We now
want you to depart.' "
Special U.S. envoy Philip Habib was en route back
to the area yesterday to join in negotiations between
Israeli and Lebanese representatives.
One of the chief hang-ups in the Israeli-Lebanese
talks has reportedly been Israeli insistence upon a
permanent presence at outposts in southern Lebanon
in order to assure security of the border area.
Deukmejian struggles with deficit
Sacramento — Gov. George Deukmejian called for

Deukmejian issued his call after the second in

committee charged with finding a solution to the $1.5
billion problem.
The Republican governor said that unless the con

"the state will be forced to pay its bills, tax refunds and
most pay and benefit checks, in registered warrants

He said he asked Assembly Speaker Willie Brown

Mt. St. Helens erupts again
Vancouver, Wash. — Mount St. Helens erupted again
yesterday, building a new mound of lava on the 700-
foot high dome in the volcano's crater.
There were no reports of explosions, mudflows or
ash. Officials said they did not know when the erup
tion began.
The eruption was confirmed at about noon yester
day by geologists who flew over the southwest Wash
ington volcano, said Thom Corcoran of the U.S. For

Corcoran said a geologist in a fixed-wing airplane
saw a new lobe of lava growing on the east side of the
dome, but that ground crews had yet to confirm it.
On Saturday, the U.S. Geological Survey and the
University of Washington warned that movement
within the crater and gas emissions indicated Mount
St. Helens would erupt within two weeks.
They said an eruption might be accompanied by ex
plosive activity, rapid snow melt and mudflows that
could cascade into Spirit Lake and the Toutle River
drainage. However, the scientists said they foresee no
danger to Spirit Lake or communities downstream.

Reagan fires EPA official
Washington — President Reagan, in an unusual move
yesterday aimed at calming turmoil at the Environ
mental Protection Agency, formally fired EPA assis
tant administrator Rita Lavelle, a Californian who had
worked on his personal staff when he was governor
°112 California.
Reagan's announcement that Lavelle had been
terminated" from her position in charge of enforc
mg toxic waste laws came after a weekend of top-level
mternal bickering at the agency over whether EPA ad
ministrator Anne Gorsuch could technically dismiss
' a presidential appointee who was under fire
both in Congress and at EPA. The argumpnt so in-
' p nsified yesterday that Gorsuch ordered two guards

armed with billy clubs to stand watch over tavelle's
offices to make certain neither lavelle nor three
members of her staff who have also been fired do not
remove any "sensitive documents," as EPA spokes
man Chris Rice said. He said use of such guards was a
"standard procedure to ensure an orderly transition
when someone leaves this abruptly."
An official familiar with the details of the incident
said that when Lavelle left Gorsuch's office last Friday
she gathered her staff and, already in tears, told them
that she was out. Some staff members began arguing
that Lavelle's dose ties with the Reagans and her
friendship with White House counselor Edwin Meese
might help spare her job. "These people convinced
her to fight back," the source said
However, the official said Gorsuch had already dis

cussed the need to oust Lavelle at a meeting at the
White House Thursday with President Reagan's cabi
net council on environment and natural resources, a
sub-cabinet group headed by Interior Secretary
lames Watt
Gorsuch reportedly explained to the council that
Lavelle's difficulties included an investigation con
cerning whether Lavelle had lied about trying to fire
an EPA whistleblower
Rep. John Dingell (D-Mich.) chairman of the House
Energy and Commerce Committee, had also warned
Gorsuch last week that "we are reviewing allegations
that the distribution of the Superfund money has
been manipulated for political purposes, and we are
investigating allegations of misconduct and unethical
behavior by an agency official."

Deportation immunity cancelled
An estimated 100,000 Mexican immigrants now living
in the United States have lost their temporary im
munity from deportation.
Although Immigration and Naturalization Service
officials say that they expect no immediate or massive
increases in the number of deportations, the agency's
action, which took effect Feb. 1, has sent shock waves
through the Latino community, particularly since per
sons most drastically affected by the situation are
long-term residents who have had time to put down
roots in the communities where they live.
"The immunity was extended originally last year on
the grounds these people would be covered by legis
lation that had just been passed by the Senate," an im
migration service spokesman in Washington said.
"The immunity ran out on Jan. 31, and to extend it
now, when new legislation has not even been in
troduced, did not seem proper."
Latino leaders said yesterday that they expect to
seek reinstatement of the immunity from deportation
once the immigration bill is reintroduced in the Con

Truce ends mountain fighting
Khalde, Lebanon — An Israeli general said yesterday
that his army would put an end to the factional fight
ing that has turned the mountains near Beirut into a
battlefield for the last four months and that both sides
have agreed to a truce.
Brig. Gen. Amnon Lifkin, summoned to the Leba
nese-lsraeli negotiations at suburban Khalde, said
Christian and Druze leaders signed a pact calling for
an end to the fighting in the Shouf Mountains.
At the time he made the statement, the strategic
mountain town of Aley was quiet after a night of
heavy fighting in which the Druze gained the upper
hand and drove the Christian Falangists out of the
area. Just before nightfall, however, there was an ex
change of rocket and artillery fire between two
nearby villages, one of them Christian, the other
Druze.
It was too early to tell whether the fighting would
escalate, but Lifkin said the Israelis would stop what
ever fighting takes place on the Lebanese territory
they occupy.
"We are doing our best to keep the situation as
calm as possible," Lifkin said. "I don't know if the
agreement is going to be fulfilled. We are going to do
our best to enforce it in the area."
China trip: problems linger
Peking — U.S. Secretary ot State George Shultz ap
parently succeeded in easing Sino-U.S. tensions on
his trip to Peking but pressing bilateral problems re
main unsolved.
After his departure Sunday for South Korea, the of
ficial Chinese news agency Xinhua said Shultz' trip
was successful only "to some extent." It denounced
U.S. arms sales to Taiwan and said China demands
"actual deeds rather than empty words" to improve
relations.
Foreign diplomatic analysts said the talks appeared
to have been very tough but suggested that relations
now might settle on a sound, realisticfooting, without
great expectations or grand strategic designs.
U.S. officials had cautioned in advance that no ma

jor agreements or breakthroughs were expected
from the four days of talks with Chinese leaders who
have accused the United States of unreliability and
seeking to dominate other nations.
Instead, the Americans said, the focus would be on
the overriding, intangible problem of mutual suspi
cion and the blurred relationship between Washing
ton and Peking.
Before Shultz came, one well-informed Chinese
source said the political realtionship had "gone
sour."
But the political air cleared by Saturday night and
Shultz told his farewell banquet: "While problems do
exist, I leave our discussions more convinced of the
real opportunties for enhanced cooperation ... We
depart having set the stage for renewed advances
built on a stronger foundation of confidence and
mutual trust."
Iran hurls largest drive
Nicosia, Cyprus — Iran launched its "final offensive"
against Iraq before dawn yesterday, retaking 100
square miles of Iranian territory and hurling tens of
thousands of troops across the border in its biggest
drive yet.
Iraq confirmed the offensive, but said it completely
crushed two Iranian divisions that crossed into Iraq at
Fakeh, about 180 miles southeast of Baghdad and 100
miles north of Basra.
Iraq said its forces killed 6894 Iranians and took
large numbers of prisoners. Baghdad communiques
claimed that Iraqi warplanes and helicopter gunships
flew 129 missions, "securing complete control of the
skies over the battlefront, inflicting very heavy losses
on enemy tanks and armor, and returning safely to
their bases."
Iraqi leaders said recently that Iran had massed
150,000 troops in the southern sector of the 300-mile
long front line in preparation for the offensive. But
the Saudi newspaper Al-Madina said Saturday as
many as 1 million Iranian troops had been deployed
to invade Iraq's southern Missan province.
Salvadorans use rockets in attack
San Salvador, El Salvador — U.S. officials believe that
the Salvadoran air force used rockets and machine
guns in an aerial attack on the guerrilla-occupied city
of Berlin, U.S. Ambassador Deane Hinton said yester
day.
"We do not believe that bombs fell within the city.
The evidence on this is very good," the envoy as
serted.
"There is evidence, on the other hand, that some
rocket fire, certainly machine gun fire, was delivered

into the city when the air force was flying and trying to
hold off the attackers," he continued. "Probably
shouldn't have been done that way, but it was."
In an interview that focused on military aspects of
the civil war, Hinton also charged that the reluctance
of Congress to fully support Reagan administration
policy has helped prolong the war.
"We need for the Congress to appropriate the
funds that the President requests," the 59-year-old
diplomat insisted.
One of the reasons, I think, the guerrillas took
heart after the sort of down period they had after the
elections last year was when the president asked for
supplementary funds for training another battalion or
two, the Congress didn't give it to him, and I think this
works to prolong the war," Hinton said.

After his departure Sunday for South Korea, the of

Foreign diplomatic analysts said the talks appeared

U.S. officials had cautioned in advance that no ma

Instead, the Americans said, the focus would be on
the overriding, intangible problem of mutual suspi

Before Shultz came, one well-informed Chinese

But the political air cleared by Saturday night and

Iran hurls largest drive
Nicosia, Cyprus — Iran launched its "final offensive"
against Iraq before dawn yesterday, retaking 100
square miles of Iranian territory and hurling tens of
thousands of troops across the border in its biggest
drive yet.
Iraq confirmed the offensive, but said it completely
crushed two Iranian divisions that crossed into Iraq at
Fakeh, about 180 miles southeast of Baghdad and 100
miles north of Basra.
Iraq said its forces killed 6894 Iranians and took
large numbers of prisoners. Baghdad communiques
claimed that Iraqi warplanes and helicopter gunships
flew 129 missions, "securing complete control of the
skies over the battlefront, inflicting very heavy losses
on enemy tanks and armor, and returning safely to
their bases."
Iraqi leaders said recently that Iran had massed
150,000 troops in the southern sector of the 300-mile
long front line in preparation for the offensive. But
the Saudi newspaper Al-Madina said Saturday as
many as 1 million Iranian troops had been deployed
to invade Iraq's southern Missan province.
Salvadorans use rockets in attack
San Salvador, El Salvador — U.S. officials believe that
the Salvadoran air force used rockets and machine
guns in an aerial attack on the guerrilla-occupied city
of Berlin, U.S. Ambassador Deane Hinton said yester
day.
"We do not believe that bombs fell within the city.
The evidence on this is very good," the envoy as
serted.
"There is evidence, on the other hand, that some
rocket fire, certainly machine gun fire, was delivered

into the city when the air force was flying and trying to
hold off the attackers," he continued. "Probably
shouldn't have been done that way, but it was."
In an interview that focused on military aspects of
the civil war, Hinton also charged that the reluctance
of Congress to fully support Reagan administration
policy has helped prolong the war.
"We need for the Congress to appropriate the
funds that the President requests," the 59-year-old
diplomat insisted.
One of the reasons, I think, the guerrillas took
heart after the sort of down period they had after the
elections last year was when the president asked for
supplementary funds for training another battalion or
two, the Congress didn't give it to him, and I think this
works to prolong the war," Hinton said.
Reagan criticizes Israelis
Washington — Reflecting his frustration over the
stalemate in Middle East negotiations, President Rea
gan said yesterday that Israel was unnecessarily delay
ing removal of its troops from Lebanon and is now
"technically in the position of an occupying force."
The president's comments to a group of Washing
ton-area television reporters were unusual in that he
focused his criticism on the continued presence of
foreign troops in Lebanon on Israel, without the usual
mention of Palestinian and Syrian forces.
Noting the need to get foreign forces out of Leba
non as a prelude to broadened Arab-Israeli peace ne
gotiations, Reagan remarked that "Israel is delaying,
we believe, unnecessarily in that."
A moment later he expanded on the remark saying
". . .There's a certain moral point that we think the Is
raelis are neglecting or not observing. And that is the
new government of Lebanon, after all these years of
revolution and upheaval, has asked all the foreign
forces to leave.
"Forthem notto leave now putsthem technically in
the position of an occupying force, that they are there
by force in this country that has said to them, 'We now
want you to depart.' "
Special U.S. envoy Philip Habib was en route back
to the area yesterday to join in negotiations between
Israeli and Lebanese representatives.
One of the chief hang-ups in the Israeli-Lebanese
talks has reportedly been Israeli insistence upon a
permanent presence at outposts in southern Lebanon
in order to assure security of the border area.

The Republican governor said that unless the con

Mt. St. Helens erupts again
Vancouver, Wash. — Mount St. Helens erupted again
yesterday, building a new mound of lava on the 700-

There were no reports of explosions, mudflows or
ash. Officials said they did not know when the erup

The eruption was confirmed at about noon yester

Corcoran said a geologist in a fixed-wing airplane

within the crater and gas emissions indicated Mount
St. Helens would erupt within two weeks.
They said an eruption might be accompanied by ex

Reagan fires EPA official
Washington — President Reagan, in an unusual move
yesterday aimed at calming turmoil at the Environ
mental Protection Agency, formally fired EPA assis
tant administrator Rita Lavelle, a Californian who had
worked on his personal staff when he was governor
°112 California.
Reagan's announcement that Lavelle had been
terminated" from her position in charge of enforc
mg toxic waste laws came after a weekend of top-level
mternal bickering at the agency over whether EPA ad
ministrator Anne Gorsuch could technically dismiss
' a presidential appointee who was under fire
both in Congress and at EPA. The argumpnt so in-
' p nsified yesterday that Gorsuch ordered two guards

armed with billy clubs to stand watch over tavelle's
offices to make certain neither lavelle nor three
members of her staff who have also been fired do not
remove any "sensitive documents," as EPA spokes
man Chris Rice said. He said use of such guards was a
"standard procedure to ensure an orderly transition
when someone leaves this abruptly."
An official familiar with the details of the incident
said that when Lavelle left Gorsuch's office last Friday
she gathered her staff and, already in tears, told them
that she was out. Some staff members began arguing
that Lavelle's dose ties with the Reagans and her
friendship with White House counselor Edwin Meese
might help spare her job. "These people convinced
her to fight back," the source said
However, the official said Gorsuch had already dis

cussed the need to oust Lavelle at a meeting at the
White House Thursday with President Reagan's cabi
net council on environment and natural resources, a
sub-cabinet group headed by Interior Secretary
lames Watt
Gorsuch reportedly explained to the council that
Lavelle's difficulties included an investigation con
cerning whether Lavelle had lied about trying to fire
an EPA whistleblower
Rep. John Dingell (D-Mich.) chairman of the House
Energy and Commerce Committee, had also warned
Gorsuch last week that "we are reviewing allegations
that the distribution of the Superfund money has
been manipulated for political purposes, and we are
investigating allegations of misconduct and unethical
behavior by an agency official."

Deportation immunity cancelled
An estimated 100,000 Mexican immigrants now living
in the United States have lost their temporary im
munity from deportation.
Although Immigration and Naturalization Service
officials say that they expect no immediate or massive
increases in the number of deportations, the agency's
action, which took effect Feb. 1, has sent shock waves
through the Latino community, particularly since per
sons most drastically affected by the situation are
long-term residents who have had time to put down
roots in the communities where they live.
"The immunity was extended originally last year on
the grounds these people would be covered by legis
lation that had just been passed by the Senate," an im
migration service spokesman in Washington said.
"The immunity ran out on Jan. 31, and to extend it
now, when new legislation has not even been in
troduced, did not seem proper."
Latino leaders said yesterday that they expect to
seek reinstatement of the immunity from deportation
once the immigration bill is reintroduced in the Con
gress this session, possibly within a month's time.
Truce ends mountain fighting
Khalde, Lebanon — An Israeli general said yesterday
that his army would put an end to the factional fight
ing that has turned the mountains near Beirut into a
battlefield for the last four months and that both sides
have agreed to a truce.
Brig. Gen. Amnon Lifkin, summoned to the Leba
nese-lsraeli negotiations at suburban Khalde, said
Christian and Druze leaders signed a pact calling for
an end to the fighting in the Shouf Mountains.
At the time he made the statement, the strategic
mountain town of Aley was quiet after a night of
heavy fighting in which the Druze gained the upper
hand and drove the Christian Falangists out of the
area. Just before nightfall, however, there was an ex
