Reagan fires EPA official
Washington — President Reagan, in an unusual move
yesterday aimed at calming turmoil at the Environ
mental Protection Agency, formally fired EPA assis
tant administrator Rita Lavelle, a Californian who had
worked on his personal staff when he was governor
°112 California.
Reagan's announcement that Lavelle had been
terminated" from her position in charge of enforc
mg toxic waste laws came after a weekend of top-level
mternal bickering at the agency over whether EPA ad
ministrator Anne Gorsuch could technically dismiss
' a presidential appointee who was under fire
both in Congress and at EPA. The argumpnt so in-
' p nsified yesterday that Gorsuch ordered two guards

armed with billy clubs to stand watch over tavelle's
offices to make certain neither lavelle nor three
members of her staff who have also been fired do not
remove any "sensitive documents," as EPA spokes
man Chris Rice said. He said use of such guards was a
"standard procedure to ensure an orderly transition
when someone leaves this abruptly."
An official familiar with the details of the incident
said that when Lavelle left Gorsuch's office last Friday
she gathered her staff and, already in tears, told them
that she was out. Some staff members began arguing
that Lavelle's dose ties with the Reagans and her
friendship with White House counselor Edwin Meese
might help spare her job. "These people convinced
her to fight back," the source said
However, the official said Gorsuch had already dis

cussed the need to oust Lavelle at a meeting at the
White House Thursday with President Reagan's cabi
net council on environment and natural resources, a
sub-cabinet group headed by Interior Secretary
lames Watt
Gorsuch reportedly explained to the council that
Lavelle's difficulties included an investigation con
cerning whether Lavelle had lied about trying to fire
an EPA whistleblower
Rep. John Dingell (D-Mich.) chairman of the House
Energy and Commerce Committee, had also warned
Gorsuch last week that "we are reviewing allegations
that the distribution of the Superfund money has
been manipulated for political purposes, and we are
investigating allegations of misconduct and unethical
behavior by an agency official."

Deportation immunity cancelled
An estimated 100,000 Mexican immigrants now living
in the United States have lost their temporary im
munity from deportation.
Although Immigration and Naturalization Service
officials say that they expect no immediate or massive
increases in the number of deportations, the agency's
action, which took effect Feb. 1, has sent shock waves
through the Latino community, particularly since per
sons most drastically affected by the situation are
long-term residents who have had time to put down
roots in the communities where they live.
"The immunity was extended originally last year on
the grounds these people would be covered by legis
