## Developing venture supplies credentials verification 
### BOB DUGONI 
There are reported cases of doctors who
never went to medical school performing
surgery, pilots who were never certified
flying airplanes and supervisors of five
persons claiming they supervise 15.
It is called credential falsification, pad
ding the resume or "telling a little white
lie." Some say it is becoming a serious
problem, others disagree. At Stanford, the
need for a strong resume and credentials
to get a job is no mystery, though the prob
lem of falsification is less severe on univer
sity campuses.
John Gannon, founder of National Cre
dential Verification Service (NCCVS), is
one of the people who believes credential
falsification is on the upswing.
"It's an extremely serious problem, ag
gravated in this economy because so many
people are out of jobs," he said.

7tis becoming very tempting
for a person to fudge his
credentials. I'm sympathetic
toward the person who
really needs a job so he says
he has a masters, but I'm also
sympathetic toward people
who do have that masters
and are getting screwed out
of a job.'

"It is becoming very tempting for a per
son to fudge his credentials. I'm sym
pathetic toward the person who really
needs a job so he says he has a masters,
but I'm also sympathetic toward people
who do have that masters and are getting
screwed out of a job."
Last September, Gannon's company de
veloped a national credential registration
service. For a $20 fee, a person can place
official credentials on file at the company
for a year.
Cannon said that the service provides
the person with a safe and permanent lo
cation for credentials, and claims it can
save up to four weeks verification time
because employers can get an immediate
check on a prospective employee.
"(Verification) is the next logical step for
a person who wants to stand out from the
crowd," Cannon said. ' A person tries to
paint his picture so that the focus is on
him. He tries to put toward his best foot,
and the more ammunition he brings the
more lines of convergence he can construct.
"The applicant is saying, 'Not only am I
qualified, I am a bonafide applicant.' He is

telling the employer he can be verified
right there."
NCVS verities its applicants file mate
rials and charges employers $25 to release
credential information. However, Cannon
said the service is more convenient for a
company than hunting down credentials
through other sources and would save
money on postage and telephone calls.
NCVS is a 24-hour toll free service.
Though he would not release figures,
Cannon said interest in the idea is about
what he expected. The company already
serves Nestle, Hartford Insuranceand ITT.
Most of the applicant interest, however,
is from persons already in the job market
and not from college students — the target
area.
One reason for this lack of enthusiasm
may be because of placement services av
ailable on college and university cam
puses, according to Cannon.
The Career Planning and Placement
Center (CPPC) maintains student resumes
and credentials on tile for free. More than
400 organizations send recruiters directly
to the center to interview job applicarts
each year.
"I'd like to believe the lack of interest is
because of services such as the ones we
offer here," CPPC Director Chris
Shinkman said.
Employers do not ask the center toverify
student credentials, he said. Although
written materials are important, they are
not necessarily the reason applicants get
jobs, he added.
"Written materials are a means to an
end, and the end is getting the interview.
You want to have good materials, but you
want to look good in an interview. That's
going to get the job.
Gary Williams, assistant dean of student
affairs at the Graduate School of Business
and MBA program director, agreed.
"The real issue ot someone applying is
not credentials but the person behind the
credentials. Sometimes we get asked to
verify credentials, but much more fre
quently we're asked to evaluate a person,
William said.
Many students here develop business
connections before they graduate, he
said. Therefore, their abilities and creden
tials are already established with an
employer.
Robert Simon, CSB director of corpo
rate relations for the past 12 years, said he
has never heard of credential falsification
being a serious problem.

"I honestly don't think it happens that
often, and a person will get tripped up
along the way. Besides, unless you're
peripatetic you don't change employers
more than half a dozen in life any
way." It seems that a person could be
doing something better with that $20."

company at risk.

Alza Corporation and Syntex USA also
check prior work records but do not use
verification services.
Verification at Syntex is done through
individual recruiters and senior scientists,
and Alza employs a manager to check
applicants under consideration.
"I would want to know what are these

There are reported cases of doctors who
never went to medical school performing
surgery, pilots who were never certified
flying airplanes and supervisors of five
persons claiming they supervise 15.
It is called credential falsification, pad
ding the resume or "telling a little white
lie." Some say it is becoming a serious
problem, others disagree. At Stanford, the
need for a strong resume and credentials
to get a job is no mystery, though the prob
lem of falsification is less severe on univer
sity campuses.
John Gannon, founder of National Cre
dential Verification Service (NCCVS), is
one of the people who believes credential
falsification is on the upswing.
"It's an extremely serious problem, ag
gravated in this economy because so many
people are out of jobs," he said.

7tis becoming very tempting
for a person to fudge his
credentials. I'm sympathetic
toward the person who
really needs a job so he says
he has a masters, but I'm also
sympathetic toward people
who do have that masters
and are getting screwed out
of a job.'

"It is becoming very tempting for a per
son to fudge his credentials. I'm sym
pathetic toward the person who really
needs a job so he says he has a masters,
but I'm also sympathetic toward people
who do have that masters and are getting
screwed out of a job."
Last September, Gannon's company de
veloped a national credential registration
service. For a $20 fee, a person can place
official credentials on file at the company
for a year.
Cannon said that the service provides
the person with a safe and permanent lo
cation for credentials, and claims it can
save up to four weeks verification time
because employers can get an immediate
check on a prospective employee.
"(Verification) is the next logical step for
a person who wants to stand out from the
crowd," Cannon said. ' A person tries to
paint his picture so that the focus is on
him. He tries to put toward his best foot,
and the more ammunition he brings the
more lines of convergence he can construct.
"The applicant is saying, 'Not only am I
qualified, I am a bonafide applicant.' He is

telling the employer he can be verified
right there."
NCVS verities its applicants file mate
rials and charges employers $25 to release
credential information. However, Cannon
said the service is more convenient for a
company than hunting down credentials
through other sources and would save
money on postage and telephone calls.
NCVS is a 24-hour toll free service.
Though he would not release figures,
Cannon said interest in the idea is about
what he expected. The company already
serves Nestle, Hartford Insuranceand ITT.
Most of the applicant interest, however,
is from persons already in the job market
and not from college students — the target
area.
One reason for this lack of enthusiasm
may be because of placement services av
ailable on college and university cam
puses, according to Cannon.
The Career Planning and Placement
Center (CPPC) maintains student resumes
and credentials on tile for free. More than
400 organizations send recruiters directly
to the center to interview job applicarts
each year.
"I'd like to believe the lack of interest is
because of services such as the ones we
offer here," CPPC Director Chris
Shinkman said.
Employers do not ask the center toverify
student credentials, he said. Although
written materials are important, they are
not necessarily the reason applicants get
jobs, he added.
"Written materials are a means to an
end, and the end is getting the interview.
You want to have good materials, but you
want to look good in an interview. That's
going to get the job.
Gary Williams, assistant dean of student
affairs at the Graduate School of Business
and MBA program director, agreed.
"The real issue ot someone applying is
not credentials but the person behind the
credentials. Sometimes we get asked to
verify credentials, but much more fre
quently we're asked to evaluate a person,
William said.
Many students here develop business
connections before they graduate, he
said. Therefore, their abilities and creden
tials are already established with an
employer.
Robert Simon, CSB director of corpo
rate relations for the past 12 years, said he
has never heard of credential falsification
being a serious problem.

"I honestly don't think it happens that
often, and a person will get tripped up
along the way. Besides, unless you're
peripatetic you don't change employers
more than half a dozen in life any
way." It seems that a person could be
doing something better with that $20."

company at risk.
"I encourage employers to verify and

Personnel directors for companies in
the Industrial Park did not rate credential
falsification as a serious problem, but do
check prior work experience.
"From time to time we do find some
discrepancies, but we don't put ourselves
in a position of saying it was falsified, we
just sayitcouldn't beveritied," Steve Bartz
of IBM said.
"We do give the applicant a chance to
respond. We rely on the honesty of the
individual. We're not operating on the
premise that people are lying. We're
operating on the premise that people are
telling the truth."
Alza Corporation and Syntex USA also
check prior work records but do not use
verification services.
Verification at Syntex is done through
individual recruiters and senior scientists,
and Alza employs a manager to check
applicants under consideration.
"I would want to know what are these
peoples' abilities," Alza personnel direc
tor Harold Fethe said. "What can they do
that my company employment manager
can't do thatwill evidence greater credibil
