# Kennedy reviews finances with ASSU
## 
### KIMBERLY BROWN Senior staff writer 
Last night's ASSU Senate meeting
focused repeatedly upon current
economic realities facing both stu
dents and the University administra
tion.
In a formal address to senate
members, University President
Donald Kennedy spoke on tuition
levels and indirect cost rates — top
ics which will ultimately affect the en
tire University.
Kennedy acknowledged that
1982-83 has been fiscally difficult for
the University. Nonetheless, he said,
"We're raising tuition significantly
less than we originally planned to in
our long-term forecast."
Tuition for 1983-84 will increase 9.8
percent.
The new rate is more than he
"would be comfortable with in an
ideal world, but less than compara
tive institutions will raise their tui
tion," Kennedy said.
The tuition discussion was ironi
cally relevant to last night's meeting
as one undergraduate senator an

nounced he would be taking a leave
of absence from the senate due to
financial hardships necessitating his
finding a job.
Kennedy said the tuition hike will
not affect the number of applicants
choosing to the attend the Univer
sity. Most students who decline ac
ceptance opt for other private uni
versities rather than less expensive
public institutions.
"Of those we lose, most go to Har
vard, Yale or Princeton, not Ber
keley," Kennedy said.
The University has a record-high
number of students on financial aid
this year, Kennedy said.
The University is conscious of fi
nancial considerations facing pro
spective students and is especially
aware of those applicants falling just
below minimum financial aid levels
nationally, he said.
Kennedy reminded the senate that
students, in actuality, "pay nothing
close to the full cost of their educa
tion, since it is subsidized in large
part by the federal government and

the University endowment.
The endowment associated with
the institution is a "private trustee
ship," Kennedy said. University offi
cials are "legally bound" to maintain
assets and opportunities for "those
people in the fifth grade in New Jer
sey right now."
As a result, Kennedy said, "we
don't buy our way out of a temporary
budget crunch or live beyond the
means of our endowment."
In regard to the ongoing debate
over the discrepancy between un
dergraduate and graduate housing
and possible subsidy transfers, Ken
nedy said the University has a
"different character of obligation
towards undergraduate housing
than graduate housing."
The University regards under
graduate housing as an essential part
of residential education.

According to graduate senators,
"there seems to be no progress
being made toward graduate student
housing in comparison to those
made for undergraduates."
Graduate students did not desire
on-campus housing in the past, Ken
nedy said. But the University is cur
rently caught in a period of extremely
rapid historic change, where due to
the phenomenon of escalating rent
costs, graduate students actually de
sire to live on campus.
"If you look back at the history of
student housing, no graduates
wanted it — they were insulted by
the very idea," Kennedy said. "Now,
with rising rental markets, the Uni
versity is having to scramble to catch
up."
The entire University is contend
ing with today's economic realities as
well. Even the President and Pro
vost's office, Kennedy quipped, "is
cutting back five percent this year."
He added, "We've really put
everyone right on the mark to make
deep cuts."
