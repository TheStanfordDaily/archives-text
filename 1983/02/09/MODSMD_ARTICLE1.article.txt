### KIMBERLY BROWN Senior staff writer 
Last night's ASSU Senate meeting
focused repeatedly upon current
economic realities facing both stu
dents and the University administra
tion.
In a formal address to senate
members, University President
Donald Kennedy spoke on tuition
levels and indirect cost rates â€” top
ics which will ultimately affect the en

keley," Kennedy said.
The University has a record-high
number of students on financial aid
this year, Kennedy said.
The University is conscious of fi
nancial considerations facing pro
spective students and is especially
aware of those applicants falling just
below minimum financial aid levels
nationally, he said.
Kennedy reminded the senate that
students, in actuality, "pay nothing
close to the full cost of their educa
tion, since it is subsidized in large
part by the federal government and
