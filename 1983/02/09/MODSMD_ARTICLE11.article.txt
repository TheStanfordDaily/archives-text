# Mental Health adds to awareness
## 
### FELICIA LEE Staff writer 
For the second year in a row
I he Bridge, along with several
other university and student
organizations, is presenting a
week of workshops and dis
cussions geared towards in
creasing students' awareness
of their emotional health.
This year, the general theme
ot the week is that of "Stress
and the Stanford Student."
Though seemingly limited, the
theme of stress, according to
Bridge manager Bruce
Campbell, was chosen be
cause stress has always been "a
background issue common to
a lot of problems." While some
ot the discussions and work
shops being presented, such
as those on relaxation and time
management, deal directly
with the problem of stress,

others deal with it only indi
rectly.
According to Campbell, the
idea for sponsoring a week
centered around mental health
issues came about last year
during a retreat for Bridge
workers. During the retreat, he
said, the Bridge workers were
trying to think up ways to pro
mote discussion about mental
health on campus One of
these ideas was that of Mental
Health Week.
Although the initial idea for
Mental Health Week came
from the Bridge, several other
organizations also played large
roles in its formation this year.
Residential Education, Cowell,
and CAPS provided provided
speakers and financial assist
ance for the project, a.id the*
ASSU provided partial funding
as well. The bulk of the costs,

however, went to printing and
advertising costs; according to
Campbell, only two of the
speakers will be paid for their
presentations.
last year, the program was
entirely funded by the Bridge.
One ol the goals of Mental
Health Week, according to
Alice Supton, assistant dean ol
Residential fcdu< ation, is to en
courage discussion of mental
health issues beyond the week
itself. Most of the discussion
sessions will be held in student
residences in order to provide
as comfortable an atmosphere
for discussion as possible. RAs
were asked to suggest specific
workshops to be held in their
residences so that students
would be able to discuss topics
particularly related to their
lives.
According to Campbell,

curiosity and person al < one < rn
with the subject of di . us,ion
are the factors which < ,iw stu

attending a worksh< n their
own dorm.
While discussions concern
ing topics of widespnad int." -
est such as academic stress
were popular last v< w. how
ever, the most wide!\ attended
discussion sessions < interned
more unusual topn \ such as
eating disorders. The most
popular presentation last year,
Campbell said, was ne enti
tled "Love or M image:
Choose One." This discus
sion, he said, drew ibout I>oo
people.
Although most of lite discus
sions will be held in under
graduate residences one of
the concerns of the week's
sponsors is that of reaching
graduate students. These stu
dents, according to ( ampbell,
often suffer from separation
anxiety (fear or reluctance to
leave school), and ac < -rding to
Darg's, are "more stressed"
than undergrads ( ampbHl

graduate student participation.
This year, however one pre
sentation, a discussion on
physicians -tnr! alcc'io' ah-.'se,
will be aimed towards the
interests of graduate students.
Campbell sees the role ot the
Bridge in the produc 'ion of
Merita! Health vVeck as a sort
of "role reversal." Instead of
waiting for student - to come to
them for help, h< said the
week gives the counseling ser
vices an opportun tv to reach
out to the students
