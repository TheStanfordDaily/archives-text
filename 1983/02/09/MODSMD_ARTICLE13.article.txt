## The 						Stanford Daily Renovation: yes, asphalt: no 
### 
After 70years of delay, it looks as if planning is
finally underway for a renovation of one of the
most visible and least attractive spots on cam
pus â€” the Quad.
Although we are heartened by this recent ef
fort, spurred on by $1 million in anonymous
donations, we question some of the proposals
being made by the University's Planning Office.
In an attempt to improve the aesthetic environ
ment here, we can only hope that campus
planners will emphasize student preferences
in their proposals rather than a dogmatic and
inconsistent loyaltv to "historical accuracy."
At the heart of the University, the Quad is a
spot where students should gather to talk, ex
change thoughts, read and relax. If the atmos
phere were right, one might expect a class or
two to be held there in the spring.
It is hard for us to imagine either students or

classes flocking to the Quad no matter how
nicely landscaped, if the current desert of loose
gravel is simply replaced by a desert of coarse
grained gravel in concrete, tile or asphalt pav
ing, as the Planning Office suggests.
The fact that grass "was not the designer's
intent" does not strike us as especially relevant.
We wonder if the original designer would have
us bind ourselves to his original concepts more
than 70 years after thev were conceived.

To us, grass is the obvious answer. It is frag
rant, cool and refreshing after a morning of clas
ses. Most important, it is inviting. Students and
faculty will want to spend time on a grass
covered Quad. We find the Planning Office's
claim that "planting irrigated lawns in the inner
Quad is inappropriate because of our semi-arid
climate" perplexing. It is only in the desert that
one can appreciate an oasis.
