# Thinking about the homeless
## 
### 
On |an. 14 and 15, a group of stu
dents (including myself) from the
Stanford Committee on Hunger
traveled to San Jose to see several
"facilities' for homeless p< >ple. In
visiting an emergency shelter to* -
ramiliej., a Christian "Rescue Mis
sion" for single men, and the "tent
citv" that was there until the most
recent storms, we met a wide variety
of the real people who are without a
p!a< e to live It was an unset*!ing ex
perience.
We all began the trip afraid ot
being resented, of being seen as
"Stanford indents on a trip to see
the poor people. After ali, that's
what we were !t was very encourag
ing to find out hat people
eager to talk with us, and glad that we
cared enough to come. The difficult
part was convincing ourselves tha*
we were not just spectator*-.
When we wanted to go home, we
s.mply got in our nes an * drove
home. The peoplr we had se*»n —
met — were miles away. Vet wh J n
the storms continued the night we
came back, it was hard not to think of
the people at the tenr city, who were
camped ;r, the mud beside a creek
that was already running high when
we left. It occured to me that, if I had
wanted to, I could have driven to San
lose, picked up six people and
brought them back to my warm dry
trailer.
But, needless to say, I didn't
There are a lot of reasor s why I
didn't. It's obvious that it wculd have
been inappropriate there wasn t
even a real question in mv mind that
it might be the right thing to do. And
when ! that I was under
strong pressure '» :>{ to help people, it
made <ne angry.
Among other things, I'm not free
to briny 3cm?one home because ',
like a!! students on campus, have no
control over jTarr where I live
Ant', for reasons that ! can find no
real fault with, my three trailermates
surely would not want to put up a
person I didn t reclly know and
cou'dn t vouch for no less two or

three. Which leads to the second
level: what we think and feel about
homeless people.
Our culture has such an irdi
vdua! itc ideology., with a strong
emphasis on the strength ot virtue
and industriousness, that we are
naturally led to assume that people
are only poor, homeless, hungrv
because they aren't "good enough"
to make it Poverty ib a character flaw
— people get what they deserve. And
the fact that a large portion of the
people or the streets arc people with
setious problems — drunk-; if we
wish to objectify them — reinforces
cur belief in the "justice" of poverty.
What is more, there is also justifi
cation to our fears that if we take
homeless people into our own
houses, we vviil be taken advantage
of, "ripped off.' People with no way
of earning a living are more likely to
steal. Any person who has thought
about their own survival --houid bp
able to understand.
It is the tart that wr are able to
write off homeless peopie as drunks
and criminals that we fee! comforta
ble ignoring them. I talked to my
father in Houston after I had gone to
San jose, and he told me that he had
become concerned about, and had
almost gotten involved with, a tent
city in Houston similar to the one ir.
San lose. But he had heard (in the
local media; about drug and alcohol
ah .ise in the camp, and that turned
h'rTi off — so when he heard that
'o'her people were helping out ' he
lost interest.
And although I would argue that
even those people who do fall into
the category of "drunks arid crimi
ials" should not be written off th<
tart is that that category does not
begin toaccojntfortheva't increase
in homeless people in this a r ea and
abound the rountry. Agencies
everywhere that neet emergency
needs are finding that the number of
people they see* has gone up greatly
in the last two years. Here around
Stanford, the Ecumenical Hunger

Program (an emergency food pro
gram) has served between two and
three times as many families in tho
last months as a year ago.
The immediate cause is not h?rd to
discern. Unemployment is at 10 per
cent (using the government estimate
that discounts discouraged and in
voluntary part-time workers), and
government services are being cut
back No job, no money, no house
no food. This accounts for a very
large part of the people on the
streets.
Coming from the intellectual
background that I do, it is easy for me
to s»'f the problem in structural, and
hence political terms. But the work I
have done expressing my displea
sure with the Reagan Administra
tion s politics doesn't seem to have
helped; the new Reagan budget,
with its 2 percent real cuts in social
spending and 9 percent real increase
in military spending, makes me just
plain angry. And while I wait for the
next elections in 1984 people are liv
ing in tents (and not by choice!)
around the country. (Excuse the
dramatics — I guess I'm trying to
convince myself.)
Seef The thing is that I have to try
to convince myself that things are
bad enough that I should want to do
something — lhat I'm not just on a
"field trip " There is so much
pressure to simply say "the best
thing for me to do is simply to do
what I'm doing here at Stanford "
And its very reasonable — after all ,
helping people is hard work, and we
ail feel we're working hard enough
already.
\t the same time, of course, I feel
Strongly that the problem is struc
tural and political, and must be dealt
with <n thit way as well It's not even
<? case of teaching the person to fish
so they can eat for a lifetime; it's a
case of looking at the course of the
stream.

Is that all there is?
On |an. 14 and 15, a group of stu
dents (including myself) from the
Stanford Committee on Hunger
traveled to San Jose to see several
"facilities' for homeless p< >ple. In
visiting an emergency shelter to* -
ramiliej., a Christian "Rescue Mis
sion" for single men, and the "tent
citv" that was there until the most
recent storms, we met a wide variety
of the real people who are without a
p!a< e to live It was an unset*!ing ex
perience.
We all began the trip afraid ot
being resented, of being seen as
"Stanford indents on a trip to see
the poor people. After ali, that's
what we were !t was very encourag
ing to find out hat people
eager to talk with us, and glad that we
cared enough to come. The difficult
part was convincing ourselves tha*
we were not just spectator*-.
When we wanted to go home, we
s.mply got in our nes an * drove
home. The peoplr we had se*»n —
met — were miles away. Vet wh J n
the storms continued the night we
came back, it was hard not to think of
the people at the tenr city, who were
camped ;r, the mud beside a creek
that was already running high when
we left. It occured to me that, if I had
wanted to, I could have driven to San
lose, picked up six people and
brought them back to my warm dry
trailer.
But, needless to say, I didn't
There are a lot of reasor s why I
didn't. It's obvious that it wculd have
been inappropriate there wasn t
even a real question in mv mind that
it might be the right thing to do. And
when ! that I was under
strong pressure '» :>{ to help people, it
made <ne angry.
Among other things, I'm not free
to briny 3cm?one home because ',
like a!! students on campus, have no
control over jTarr where I live
Ant', for reasons that ! can find no
real fault with, my three trailermates
surely would not want to put up a
person I didn t reclly know and
cou'dn t vouch for no less two or

three. Which leads to the second
level: what we think and feel about
homeless people.
Our culture has such an irdi
vdua! itc ideology., with a strong
emphasis on the strength ot virtue
and industriousness, that we are
naturally led to assume that people
are only poor, homeless, hungrv
because they aren't "good enough"
to make it Poverty ib a character flaw
— people get what they deserve. And
the fact that a large portion of the
people or the streets arc people with
setious problems — drunk-; if we
wish to objectify them — reinforces
cur belief in the "justice" of poverty.
What is more, there is also justifi
cation to our fears that if we take
homeless people into our own
houses, we vviil be taken advantage
of, "ripped off.' People with no way
of earning a living are more likely to
steal. Any person who has thought
about their own survival --houid bp
able to understand.
It is the tart that wr are able to
write off homeless peopie as drunks
and criminals that we fee! comforta
ble ignoring them. I talked to my
father in Houston after I had gone to
San jose, and he told me that he had
become concerned about, and had
almost gotten involved with, a tent
city in Houston similar to the one ir.
San lose. But he had heard (in the
local media; about drug and alcohol
ah .ise in the camp, and that turned
h'rTi off — so when he heard that
'o'her people were helping out ' he
lost interest.
And although I would argue that
even those people who do fall into
the category of "drunks arid crimi
ials" should not be written off th<
tart is that that category does not
begin toaccojntfortheva't increase
in homeless people in this a r ea and
abound the rountry. Agencies
everywhere that neet emergency
needs are finding that the number of
people they see* has gone up greatly
in the last two years. Here around
Stanford, the Ecumenical Hunger

Program (an emergency food pro
gram) has served between two and
three times as many families in tho
last months as a year ago.
The immediate cause is not h?rd to
discern. Unemployment is at 10 per
cent (using the government estimate
that discounts discouraged and in
voluntary part-time workers), and
government services are being cut
back No job, no money, no house
no food. This accounts for a very
large part of the people on the
streets.
Coming from the intellectual
background that I do, it is easy for me
to s»'f the problem in structural, and
hence political terms. But the work I
have done expressing my displea
sure with the Reagan Administra
tion s politics doesn't seem to have
helped; the new Reagan budget,
with its 2 percent real cuts in social
spending and 9 percent real increase
in military spending, makes me just
plain angry. And while I wait for the
next elections in 1984 people are liv
ing in tents (and not by choice!)
around the country. (Excuse the
dramatics — I guess I'm trying to
convince myself.)
Seef The thing is that I have to try
to convince myself that things are
bad enough that I should want to do
something — lhat I'm not just on a
"field trip " There is so much
pressure to simply say "the best
thing for me to do is simply to do
what I'm doing here at Stanford "
And its very reasonable — after all ,
helping people is hard work, and we
ail feel we're working hard enough
already.
\t the same time, of course, I feel
Strongly that the problem is struc
tural and political, and must be dealt
with <n thit way as well It's not even
<? case of teaching the person to fish
so they can eat for a lifetime; it's a
case of looking at the course of the
