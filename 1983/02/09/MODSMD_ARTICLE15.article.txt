Regulations implementing Kep.
Ceraid Solomon's (R-NA.) amend
ment to deny federal educational as
sistance to nonregistrants were pub
lished recently by the Department of
Education. A 30-day public comment
period provides for groups and indi
viduals to express their concerns
about the regulations.
The new regulations are geared
toward repressing civil disobedi
ence, or direct challenge of the low.
Nonregistrants.. it is charged, have
not fulfilled an obligation to their
country and should therefore be de
nied benefits.
A severe penalty for nonregistra
tion already exists, and is one that
those who have chosen to disobey
the law are prepared for, with the
knowledge that their views will re
ceive public hearing. The Solomon
amendment imposes penalties with
out allowing the nonregistrant to ex
press his opinion, and without any
provision of a trial by jury. The non
registrant is effectively considered
guilty until proven innocent.
Thus the amendment removes that
avenue of impact fundamental to
civil disobedience. There is not even
a conscientious-objector type of
exemption provided in the regula
tions.
The regulations stipulate that the
Statement of Educational Purpose,
already required by all Title IV reci
pients, will be expanded to include a
Statement of Registration Com
pliance. The burden of proof is on
the student, who must provide ap
proved documentation (preferably
his Registration Acknowledgement
Letter) to back up his certification on
the form.
Several institutions have ex
pressed their opposition to the
amendment and its accompanying
regulations. Yale, Earlham, Haver
ford and Northwestern universities

have already declared their ntent to
make up aid their nonregistrant stu
dents would lose due to the legisla
tion. Statements made by Stanford
administrators indicate that they are
also opposed to this legislation but
have not yei decided on ? '.ourse of
action.
The Minnesota Public Interest Re
search Group (MPIRG) has advanced
a lawsuit challenging the constitu
tionality of the amendment on the
following four grounds:
The law denies equal protection
under the law by discriminating on
the basis of sex, age, and income,
and enforcement will have a dispro
portionate impact on racial and
ethnic minorities.
The law violates applicants' Fifth
Amendment rights against self
incrimination by requiring them to
disclose their draft registration
status.
"I he statute constitutes a Bill of
Attainder, violating Article 1, Section
9, of the U.S. Constitution. A citizen
would be determined guilty of a
crime and punished by a legislative
act without being provided a court
trial and other protections guaran
teed criminal defendents.
The sharing of confidential in
formation with the Selective Sen/ire
violates an individual's protection
under the Privacy Act of 1974. Stu
dents will be forced to share with
school administrators draft registra
tion information relevant to the dis
tribution of Federal educational aid,
but which nevertheless becomes a
permanent part of their record with
the university.
The legal arguments advanced by
the MPIRG lawsuit reflect the way in
which the Solomon amendments
were pushed through Congress with
little or no public or congressional
debate and without expert testimony
given regarding their constitutional

ity.
Solomon intends to attach tuitht-i

The Minnesota Public Interest Re
search Group (MPIRG) has advanced
a lawsuit challenging the constitu
tionality of the amendment on the
following four grounds:
The law denies equal protection
under the law by discriminating on
the basis of sex, age, and income,
and enforcement will have a dispro
portionate impact on racial and
ethnic minorities.
The law violates applicants' Fifth
Amendment rights against self
incrimination by requiring them to
disclose their draft registration
status.
"I he statute constitutes a Bill of
Attainder, violating Article 1, Section
9, of the U.S. Constitution. A citizen
would be determined guilty of a
crime and punished by a legislative
act without being provided a court
trial and other protections guaran
teed criminal defendents.
The sharing of confidential in
formation with the Selective Sen/ire
violates an individual's protection
under the Privacy Act of 1974. Stu
dents will be forced to share with
school administrators draft registra
tion information relevant to the dis
tribution of Federal educational aid,
but which nevertheless becomes a
permanent part of their record with
the university.
The legal arguments advanced by
the MPIRG lawsuit reflect the way in
which the Solomon amendments
were pushed through Congress with
little or no public or congressional
debate and without expert testimony
given regarding their constitutional

ity.
Solomon intends to attach tuitht-i

Regulations implementing Kep.
Ceraid Solomon's (R-NA.) amend
ment to deny federal educational as
sistance to nonregistrants were pub
lished recently by the Department of
Education. A 30-day public comment
period provides for groups and indi
viduals to express their concerns
about the regulations.
The new regulations are geared
toward repressing civil disobedi
ence, or direct challenge of the low.
Nonregistrants.. it is charged, have
not fulfilled an obligation to their
country and should therefore be de
nied benefits.
A severe penalty for nonregistra
tion already exists, and is one that
those who have chosen to disobey
the law are prepared for, with the
knowledge that their views will re
ceive public hearing. The Solomon
amendment imposes penalties with
out allowing the nonregistrant to ex
press his opinion, and without any
provision of a trial by jury. The non
registrant is effectively considered
guilty until proven innocent.
Thus the amendment removes that
avenue of impact fundamental to
civil disobedience. There is not even
a conscientious-objector type of
exemption provided in the regula
tions.
The regulations stipulate that the
Statement of Educational Purpose,
already required by all Title IV reci
pients, will be expanded to include a
Statement of Registration Com
pliance. The burden of proof is on
the student, who must provide ap
proved documentation (preferably
his Registration Acknowledgement
Letter) to back up his certification on
the form.
Several institutions have ex
pressed their opposition to the
amendment and its accompanying
regulations. Yale, Earlham, Haver
ford and Northwestern universities

have already declared their ntent to
make up aid their nonregistrant stu
dents would lose due to the legisla
tion. Statements made by Stanford
administrators indicate that they are
also opposed to this legislation but
have not yei decided on ? '.ourse of
action.
