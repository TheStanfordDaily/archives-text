## ASSU salaries should be student-paid 
### 
lr response to the ASSU's request
f.;r University fundingfor the salaries
of ASSU top officials, »t appears to be
the logical conclusion tc the fit am '.a!
circus 'hai has been taking plao wilh
our se: ate's finances, it seems ironic
that the captains of our financial
mc s ,ue asking 'Father Leland" "o
set ure their salaries because of that
very mess.
The ASSU now turns to the deep
pot ke» o< Stanford University and
for subsidies in order to make
up tor 'hr onlv h'ghlv profitable hut
now bankrupt and disbanded Spec ial
Fvents program a°d ASSU travel ?>er-
Perhaps one should question
why these and other monevmakrrs
have plunged into the red and been
subsequently disbanded W. hy could
the ASSU make monev in the pas*
while now it begs for subsidies? I
guess we've |ust been hard-hit by the
recession.
Why should the University sub
sidize the salaries of the managers of
our government's financial mess?
Well, tha* question was answered in
true ASSU style by our financial man
ager Rob Brody: "The University
feels tne student body should have a
government. Therefore, the Univer
s>ty should pay for it." Simple
enough.
Hut alas, there remains those of us
neo-classical economics major who
learned complex economic models
like, you don't spend money you
don't have" and 'there's no such
thing as a tree lunch." Mv feeling is

that if we cannot meet our expenses,
then we should increase our income
or decrease the level of spending To
me. a balanced and self-sufficient
senate budgets the way to achieve
this "long term stability" Brody
wants.
I cannot help but feel like we're
back in high school running to our
principal asking for more money to
oav tor the prom because "the high
st hool thinks we shou'd have a prom
. . therelore they should pay for it."
How about this, "the students feel
we should have a government, there
fore we should pay tor it." Why can't
we tap the genius of the Stanford
student body enough to establish a
financially-independent senate that
addresses the needs of the student
bod.' to the extent that the students
arp willing to pay for these services
We need to stop begging for money
for recycling because the University
saves a httle money in trash-hauling
or justifying a crumbled concern
program because Bill Graham is re
ally a mean guy who pushed us
a r ound.
I hope that the University denies
subsidizing the salaries of our senate
leaders. It's our job to support ou r
own govei nment. If we're not willing
to do that then I guess the ASSU
doesn't mean too much to us. If thev
do deny the subsidy, and our "top
ASSU officials" become unem
ployed, they need not worry, I'm
quite certain that Reagan would hire
them as advisors to the Reaganomic

budget

Future of EPA
Were the people of East Palo Alto
(EPA) given the option of joining Palo
Aito, Menlo Pa-k or incorporating as
a citv, they would vote overwhelm
ingly for Palo Alto, with Menlo Parka
poor second and incorporation an
insignificant third. We are not stupid
— we know op which side our bread
is buttered. figures show that ser
vices in Menlo Park are far superior
than would be possible in a poor in
corporated city.
Apparently the East PaJo Alto Citi
zens C jmmittee for Incorporation
(FPACX !) has convinced the Board of
Supervisors, the various city coun
cils the Stanford students and other
outsiders rhat i* represents the views
of the people in EPA and that they
want incorporation
The Aprd election proved that,
didr.'f it? Nonsense' Despite rPAC
CI s intensive 'wo yesr campaign
costing $100,000, incorporation won
bv oni. J SO votes. Had the east side
been organized, had leaders hke
Gertrude vVilks and Henrv Anthony
come out against incorporation
sooner than three weeks before the
electior incorporation would have
been soundly defeated
EPA »>«iongs in the sphere of
Menlo Park which surrounds it.

Menlo Park annexed EPA's choicest
industrial land On 53 acres of this
land it plans to build a warehouse
complex. Menlo Park gets all the tax
benefits. EPA gets all the truck traffic.
It is the quintessence of chutzpah
for Menlo Park to p-otest Stanford's
irresponsibility for planning to build
lovely landscaped housing facing
Menlo Park, while denying its re
sponsibility towards EPA from which
it has taken valuable property and
given nothing in return.
EPACCI shares the major blame for
Menlo Park's rejection of EPA. It
gathered statistics to prove EPA a lia
bility. It convinced Menlo Park that
only west side racists opposed in
corporation. Appearing before the
city council, it induced it to adopt a
resolution supporting incorporation
in order to help EPACCI in its drive to
form a city of its own in EPA. Menlo
Park eagerly complied with incorpo
ration, enabling it to wash its hands
of all responsibility in helping to
create a poor, segregated commun
ity from which it had taken the tax
oase.
A coalition of all groups opposing
incorporation has been formed. In
corporation will solve no problems
but make them far worse. EPA as a
city, can survive on a subsistance
level only if subsidies continue inde
finitely. Citizens will see through the
demagoguerv of slogans. They will
reject incorporation in the next elec
tions.
