# Anonymous donor funds clock tower
## 
### BOB ORTTUNG 
This year April showers will
bring more than the usual May
flowers to studeriis and faculty
here. At least that is what plan
ners are expecting as the con
struction of a 45-foot clock
tower by the Career Planning
and Placement Center nears
completion.
An anonymous alumnus
provided the $250,000 neces
sary for the building. When he
was a student here, he met his
present wife under the old
tower which stood behind
Memorial Church until 1967.
As a result, the construction of
a new tower ' has special sig
nificance to them," according
to Phil Williams, director of
planning.
The donor chose a classical
design for the new tower. The
four clock faces will be
mounted in a reinforced
stucco tower under a red tile
roof. Windows at the base of
the tower will provide a view of
the clockwork inside.
The plans also include trel
lises and benches. A tower
standing by itself would be too
dominating, Shirley Chen, a
facilities project manager said.

"I he benches and trellises are
a major factor in the planner's
attempt to make the area a so
cial gathering place, Chen said.
The tower will be located be
tween the CPPC and the old
engineering corner of the
Quad. The planners chose this
site because it was as close as
possible to Memorial Church.
The clock was housed in the
tower of memorial Church
until the 1906 earthquake sent
it crashing through the roof.
For the next 50 years a tempo
rary wooden tower housed the
clock behind the church.
When the tower was razed to
ease pedestrian travel between
the inner Quad and Tressider
area, Fuchs made sure the
clock work was saved. Most re
cently, Terman library has dis
played some of the clock work.
The intersection is also a cir
culation and social focal point,
so people will naturally be
there, Williams said.
The construction of the
tower will improve traffic flow
at this intersection. The
planners removed one of the
planters that was actually in the

way of traffic to make space for
the tower and benches which
will be to the side of the traffic
flow, Williams said.
Some students who used the
intersection said they felt the
addition of the clocktower
would be an improvement.

Junior Kerry Stuhr said,
"Oncejhe fence (surrounding
the construction site) is gone it
will be fine. This intersection is
busy no matter what You just
get resigned to the far t."
Freshman Rowen Bensch
said, "The bench< will be

popular because cross sections
are a great place to watch
people. Europeans have a ten
dency to sit down in squares; it
gives them a tamily atmos
phere. This used to be just an
intersection; now it will be
much more than that."

Memorial Church and was destroyed in the 1906 earthquake, are currently
being restored for use in the new tower.
