# Finances solid despite gov't funds drop

Concerned about declining federal support
for research and financial aid, yet optimistic
about gift and investment possibilities for the
future, the University's annual financial report
for 1982 concluded that Stanford has the financial
ability to maintain its current strength and
momentum.
"We. . . can demonstrate the great financial
strength of this University. We expect this
strength to persist into the future," William
Massy, vice president for business and finance,
concluded in the report released yesterday.
"Yet it would be wrong to say that Stanford is
'affluent' — the financial pressure that shows up
in the long range forecast is sufficient to belie
that impression," Massy said.
The report expressed concern about the fed
eral government's lessening commitment to uni

versity research funding.
"Federal support for university research is
under very great pressure. . . and it may well
decline faster than the private sector can or will
pick up the slack," the report said. "Hence spon
sored research must be regarded as an area of
serious financial vulnerability."
Controller Keith Creighton emphasized this
concern over federal funding of research. "The
research volume had not grown in real dollars"
over the past few years, he said. Creighton ad
mitted that the private sector has given increas
ing support to research activities, but he said this
"relatively small dollar amount" couldn't make
up for loss of public funds.
Vice provost Raymond Bacchetti agreed that
the private sector will not "increase its support at
a rate that would offset the decline in public
support."
The projected reductions in federal funding

luld force cuts in the University's budget, the
report said.
"It is likely th.it a new round of budget reduc
tions will be necessitated as a result of shifts in
government funding priorities for student aid
and sponsored research," it said.
"We're in a cutback period," Creighton ex
plained, adding that the University is meeting the
financial hard times by reducing its budget base.
According to the report, $94.7 million in re
search funds were expended by faculty members
here during the last fiscal year. Of this amount,
$83.7 million came from the federal government,
$5.8 million fr >m private foundations; and $5 mil
lion from private businesses Ihe Department of
Energy also supported the Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center with $64.1 million. Stanford
ranks among the top five universities in the re
ceipt of federal research funds, the report said.

Forecasters predicted another major storm will hit
the area early today. See story below.
The report also warned of the re
newed burden that changes in gov
ernmental student financial aid
policies will place on the university.
"The recent changes in govern
mental student aid policies have
reinstated the burden on colleges
and universities to assure that access
remains open to all regardless of
economic background," the report
said. "Hence, we are having to plan
for increased student aid expendi
tures trom the operating budget."
Despite this concern about possi
ble decreases in federal support, the
report was optimistic about the po
tential financial assistance available
from gifts, endowments and invest
ment returns.

"Stanford closed this recession
year with a gift total of $77 million.

This was second in size only to last
year's record-breaking performance
of $79.5 million, and it kept us as a
leader among universities nation
wide," the report said.
Endowment income increased
about 4.5 percentage points faster
than the Consumer Price Index dur
ing the last decade. In addition, total
investment return for the period was
8.2 percent per year, compounded.
In comparison, Standard and Poor's
index of common stocks increased at
an annual rate of 4.8 percent.
The report noted that the Universi
ty's current funds operating expendi
tures increased about 11 percent on
the decade endingAugust3l,l9B2 —
about 2 percent more than the rate of
inflation for the period.
According to the report, this in
crease occurred because of rises in
energy costs, government regulation
expenses, the operation and main
tenance of new facilities and de
ferred maintenance.
