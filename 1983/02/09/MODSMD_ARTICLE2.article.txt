# Finances solid despite gov't funds drop

Concerned about declining federal support
for research and financial aid, yet optimistic
about gift and investment possibilities for the
future, the University's annual financial report
for 1982 concluded that Stanford has the financial
ability to maintain its current strength and
momentum.
"We. . . can demonstrate the great financial
strength of this University. We expect this
strength to persist into the future," William
Massy, vice president for business and finance,
concluded in the report released yesterday.
"Yet it would be wrong to say that Stanford is
'affluent' â€” the financial pressure that shows up
in the long range forecast is sufficient to belie
that impression," Massy said.
The report expressed concern about the fed
eral government's lessening commitment to uni

versity research funding.
"Federal support for university research is
under very great pressure. . . and it may well
decline faster than the private sector can or will
pick up the slack," the report said. "Hence spon
sored research must be regarded as an area of
serious financial vulnerability."
Controller Keith Creighton emphasized this
concern over federal funding of research. "The
research volume had not grown in real dollars"
over the past few years, he said. Creighton ad
mitted that the private sector has given increas
ing support to research activities, but he said this
"relatively small dollar amount" couldn't make
up for loss of public funds.
Vice provost Raymond Bacchetti agreed that
the private sector will not "increase its support at
a rate that would offset the decline in public
support."
The projected reductions in federal funding

luld force cuts in the University's budget, the
report said.
"It is likely th.it a new round of budget reduc
tions will be necessitated as a result of shifts in
government funding priorities for student aid
and sponsored research," it said.
"We're in a cutback period," Creighton ex
plained, adding that the University is meeting the
financial hard times by reducing its budget base.
According to the report, $94.7 million in re
search funds were expended by faculty members
here during the last fiscal year. Of this amount,
$83.7 million came from the federal government,
$5.8 million fr >m private foundations; and $5 mil
lion from private businesses Ihe Department of
Energy also supported the Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center with $64.1 million. Stanford
ranks among the top five universities in the re
ceipt of federal research funds, the report said.
