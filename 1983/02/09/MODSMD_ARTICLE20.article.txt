# Student writes, produces play

### CURTIS GRUENLER 
"It's very hard to write a
play," said junior David
Schemlzer, author of "Even
the Best of Wings." Writing
is only the beginning of the
difficulties in putting on an
original play, as he and co
producer and director
junior |ohn McDonough
have discovered this year.
Nonetheless, "Even the
Best of Wings" will go on
stage March 26 at the Little
Theatre. "It looks like it will
fly," Schmelzer joked.

'/ wanted to write
something that you
would not only
see, enjoy and clap
at, something that

dream/

Schmelzer had been con
sidering the idea of writing a
p! ty since high school. "The
parodies I wrote in High
school were pure fun, but
my friends encouraged me
to try something more am
bitious," he said. "I wanted
to write something that you
would not only see, enjoy
and clap at, something that
would encourage people
around here to dream."
He wrote the play last
summer, intending to sub
mit it to Ram's Head fortheir
Original Winter One-acts
productions, traditionally
the only forum for original
student drama on campus.
But as he wrote it, the play
soon grew into a rather
long, 125-page, two-and-a
half hour, two act drama
with music," he said.
"That's as opposed to a
musical," Schmelzer said.
"I saw a possibility to really
rivet poeple with music."
Byt three original songs,
composed with the aid of
Ann Hesterman, Chris
Knepper and |im Kurtzman,
along with several adapta
tions, are not used to ad
vance the plot. Rather,
Schmelzer said , "The
characters are musicians, so
music sets the mood and
makes comments."
In any case, Schmelzer
and McDonough had a
weighty script by neither a
production company nor
theater. They first obtained

the support of The Com
pany, a group that previ
ously produced "Equus"
and ''Jesus Christ
Superstar."
Next they needed a thea
ter, "We wanted either
Cubberly or the Little I hea
ter," said Schmelzer," and
Cubberly is being remod
eled." This left the Little
Theatre, which has been
used only by the Dram.i De
partment so far this year. By
grace of the people at
Events and Serv ices we were
able to get the single open
spot in the best theater on
campus," continued
Schmelzer, "exactly what
we had hoped for."
"We wanted to do it at the
end of the winter quarter
because it is the most dismal
time of what is historically
the most dismal quarter,''
he said "We would like to
serve the viewers purposes
reconvincing them that
what they're doing is
worthwhile."
Other aspects of the show
such as financial backing, a
technical crew and a jazz/
rock band, are coming to
gether, "in spite of our
naivete in not planning far
enough in advance,"
Schmelzer said. Despite
funding from program ads,
individuals and on-campus
sources, he said, "We stand
to lose about $1000, even if
the show sells out. But we
are much more interested in
the effect it could have."

'Even the best of
wings can't keep a
bird aloft in a
storm/

The story is about a family
of performers, Schmelzer
said. In the beginning of the
play the father, a retired ac
tor, has a mystical vision
that plagues him through
out the rest of the show. "So
it's about how this experi
ence affects the family, es
pecially the children," ex
plained the authoi.
"The title comes from a
line in the play: 'Iven the
best of wings can't keep a
bird aloft in a storm',"
McDonough said. "The
main issues are what is sui
cess?' and 'where does it
come from?' "

he said "We would like to
serve the viewers purposes
reconvincing them that
what they're doing is
worthwhile."
Other aspects of the show
such as financial backing, a
technical crew and a jazz/
rock band, are coming to
gether, "in spite of our
naivete in not planning far
enough in advance,"
Schmelzer said. Despite
funding from program ads,
individuals and on-campus
sources, he said, "We stand
to lose about $1000, even if
the show sells out. But we
are much more interested in
the effect it could have."

The story is about a family
of performers, Schmelzer
said. In the beginning of the
play the father, a retired ac
tor, has a mystical vision
that plagues him through
out the rest of the show. "So
it's about how this experi
ence affects the family, es
pecially the children," ex
plained the authoi.
"The title comes from a
line in the play: 'Iven the
best of wings can't keep a
bird aloft in a storm',"
McDonough said. "The
main issues are what is sui
cess?' and 'where does it
come from?' "
