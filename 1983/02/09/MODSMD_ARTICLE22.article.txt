# Row sponsors Mardi Gras celebration
## 
### JULIE HAGEN 
The festival of Mardi Gras
will not pass unnoticed here
this year. Floats, dance troops,
mimes, jugglers and the infa
mous Leland Stanford junior
University Marching Band will
convene at noon on Friday,
Feb. 11, to begin the first an
nual Stanford Mardi Gras
Parade.
The parade will begin at
Governor's Corner and travel
down Santa Teresa St. through
White Plaza and down Escon
dido Road to Wilbur Field.
There the event will culminate
in an afternoon party, com
plete with music from the
Druids and free pepsi and
beer.
A raffle will also be held at
Wilbur Field following the
parade, with the winner receiv
ing a trip for two to Mazatlan
over spring break. Proceeds
from the raffle will go to the
Stanford Special Olympics.

floats/

The parade is being spon
sored by the row houses and
the Stanford Special Olympics,
under the direction of Gordon
Hecker, French House Resi
dent Assistant. According to
Hecker, the idea struck him at a
meeting for row resident ad
visors. "They (the RAs)
suggested we do something
for the Mardi Gras. I just took
off on the idea. The idea of hav
ing a parade struck me and I
said, "Hell, why not?" If we're
going to do something, it
might as well be something
major."

The parade is being funded
largely by the row houses, each
donating about $20. Their re
ward may come in the form of
"a sense of unity which may
otherwise be lacking,"
brought about by working to
gether on a joint project,
Flecker said.
"It's nice to have an oppor
tunity to show that the row can

function as a unit,'' said Di
rector Diana Conklin. "It's a
great antidote for winter quar
ter blahs." She provided row
program funds for the advertis
ing of the parade. "We're hop
ing that we can really tap stu
dents' energies and imagina
tions with the floats," Hecker
said.
The upcoming housing draw

may serve as an incentive to
enter a float, he said. Resi
dences could establish their
identities in students minds by
way of their float. "It gives an

'It's a great antidote
for winter quarter
blahs/

opportunity for the houses to
present themselves arid give a
flavor of what the people in the
house are like through the
floats/' said Kairos R.A. Dave
Swan. He added that a little
sunshine could help, but
members of his house are
"pretty excited aboul it."
Floats from the French
House, the Grove Houses,
Branner, Toyon, the Big Way
Yacht Club and the Alpha Phi
sorority are among those al
ready registered.
The use of the words first
annual in publicity posters
displayed around campus con
vey Hecker's hope that this
may be the beginning of a trad
ition. Hecker "estimates con
servatively" to have spent 100
hours on the planning of the
parade. "February is such a
lousy month anyway,' he said.
"What do people need more
than to be outside, and see the
band and have fun?''
Raffle tickets for the trip to
Mazatlan cost $1, and can be
bought in White Pla/a through
Thursday or from row house
R.A.s. The drawing will be held
at the close of the party at Wil
bur Field and the winner must
be present to win.
There will be a meeting for
all who have registered or wish
to register floats Thursday
evening at 5 p.m. at the French
House. In the event of rain, the
parade may take place on
March 4.
