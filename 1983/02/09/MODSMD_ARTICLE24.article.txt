## Netmen blank SDS, play Irvine Friday 
### MARK ZEIGLER 
"I thought we played very
well overall. It was a good,
solid match," said men's tennis
coach Dick Could after his
team had defeated San Diego
State here yesterday.
Gould's troops couldn't have
won in any more "good" or
"solid'' fashion, though, as the
Cardinal blanked the Aztecs
9-0.
Stanford netters swept all six
matches in straight sets except
for freshman )ohn Lett's 6-3,
3-6, 6-2 triumph at the No. 4
spot. At No. 1, junior Scott
Davis blasted San Diego State's
Troy Collins two and one,
while No. 2 Eric Rosenfeld got
off to a shaky start, but then
regained his usual form in beat
ing Ned Eames 7-5, 6-1.
Freshman Dan Coldie won
over Aztec Chris lochen by de
fault in the second set when
Jachon experienced wrist
problems. Coldie captured the
first set 6-3.
"I've been very pleased at
five and six," Could said, re
ferring to junior Mark McKeen
and freshman )im Crabb's
dominance over their oppo
nents so far this season. Both
McKeen, at No. 5, and Crabb,
at six, won handily again, by
scores of 6-1, 6-1 and 6-2, 6-2,
respectively.
The Cardinal had a bit more
trouble in the doubles depart
ment. Two of the three
matches went thrt e sets and
freshmen Geordie \VKee and
Rod Coull at No. 3 were the
only team that cruised to vic
tory, beating Steve Wellington
and Blake Cairney 6-3, 6-1.
"Our doubles still have a
long way to go," Gould said.
"We spent all fall getting our
singles line-up together."
At No. 1 doubles, the
freshmen pair of Letts and
Rosenfeld played erratically
and won 7-6, 1-6, 6-1. In the
afternoon's most exciting
match, Goldie and sophomore

leremy Semple downed Col
lins and Andv Volkert 6-4, 3-6,
6-4.
In the final set, each doubles
team held their serve until
Goldie/Semple broke Collins
Volkert in the tenth game. The
San Diego State pair staved off
two match points in that game
before a Goldie volley went for
a winner to cinch the set and
the match for Stanford.
The Cardinal takes on UC-
Irvine Friday at 1:30 p.m. on
the varsity couris. According
to Could, Irvine is about the
20th best team in the nation
and should give Stanford its
first test at home, especially
since the Card will play without
Davis, who will be in La Quinta,
Calif., for a singles tourna
ment.
The Anteaters feature two
players rated in the top 40 na
nationally, as well as the No. 19
ranked doubles team.
