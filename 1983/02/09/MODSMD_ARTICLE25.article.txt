# Eric Rosenfeld: Short in age, long in talent
## 
### BETH KLEID 
Most 17 year-olds are still
in high school. Freshman
Eric Rosenfeld, the No. 2
player on the men's tennis
team here, is an exception.

"I did 11th and 12th
grades in one year," Rosen
feld said, "so I could get out
here early and play tennis."
For Rosenfeld, who is from a
small town ot Media, Penn

sylvania, the competition in
the East Coast was just not
tough enough.
"The competition in the
East is very, very bad. I really
felt I could gain from com
ing out to the West Coast,"
he said.
Another reason that
Rosenfeld moved westward
was the weather. The blus
tery eastern winters did not
help his tennis game. "It
was hard for me to get a lot
of practice time in the
winter. In the winter, tennis
becomes an indoor sport.
Court time gets really ex
pensive and harder to get
because many people want
to play," he said.
At Friends Central High
School in Media, Rosenfeld
found tennis too easy. He
played the No. 1 position on
the team but was plagued by
the lack of competition. "I
had a great time playing
high school tennis. It was
fun because there was no
pressure on me at all," he
said.
"I've really found the
competition I've been look
ing for, and I have improved
so much since I've been out
here. Stanford tennis is
great."
But Rosenfeld may have
rushed things a bit to find
that competition he
wanted. He admitted that
he did miss out on social life
in high school as a result of
tennis. And combining 11th
and 12 grades was no easy
task.
Rosenfeld committed
himself to tennis, and he
had to take the conse
quences. "I did not have a
regular high school life, but
it was my decision. High
school tennis is not like high
school football or basket
ball. To make a name for
yourself you have to get
away from school and go
out and play tournaments —

and you become less in
volved in high school lite."
Rosenfeld's commitment
to tennis began when he
was 10 years-old. His father
started him in tennis, and
young Rosenfeld really en
joyed the sport.
After only five months of
playing local tournaments,
Rosenfeld qualified for the
national tournament in the
12-year and under division.
Since then tennis has be
come a passion for him —
and it has paid off.
Last year he was ranked
fourth in the 16 and under
division. This year he is
ranked 11th in the 18 and
under division. "I'm happy
with my ranking — it's good
for my first year in a new
division.''
As for the tennis team
here, Rosenfeld is pleased.
"We have a great team. It's a
young team; there are four
freshman playing in the top
six positions. I think we're
tough — I hope we can
make it to the top five.
"I would love for us to go
for the N.C.A.A. champion
ships," continued Rosen
feld. "Our coach, Dick

Could, is great. He has
helped me so much. He
helps us all individually and
as a team."
If the opportunity arises,
Rosenfeld would like to play
in some professional tour
naments during his stay
here. "College students can
play in pro tournaments as
long as they don't accept
any money — like our No. 1
player Scott Davis does.
When Davis is away at these
tournaments I get to play
No. 1," Rosenfeld said.
Things are running
smoothly for Rosenfeld in
all areas. "I am really happy
here. My tennis and my
schoolwork are both going
well. I have learned to handle
both pretty easily — you just
have to be able to space out
your time."
Rosenfeld is interested in
psychology, but he wants to
experiment with many types
of c lasses before he decides
on a major.
But the freshman tennis
phenom does have one de
finite goal for the future. "I
want to be a pro; I want to
be the No. 1 tennis player in
the world," he said.
