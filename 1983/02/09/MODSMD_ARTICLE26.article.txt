# Card gets back on track
## Volleyballers beat Bears 
### NORRIE CAVALLERO 
The Stanford men's vol
levball team defeated UC-
Uerkelev last night, 15-4, 9-15,
15-J, 15-6, at Maples Pavillion.
It was a non-conference
match so the victory does not
affect league standing, but
does raise the overall record to

5-3.
Craig lauthner, Peter Shap
iro and Jon Root combined to
make Stantord unbeatable
with their sets and spikes.
Lauchner also made some key
blocks of Cal's spikes. Root
pulled through with some
amazing saves and excellent
serving.

Head coach Fred Sturm said
that, in some ways, this was the
team's best performance of the
year, and singled out Craig
Lauchner's performance and
the recoveries and net play by
Jon Root.
"It is an inexperienced team
with a lot to learn, but they
work hard and have definite
moments of brilliance," Sturm
said. There are those lapses in
concentration, organization,
and execution which still need
to be ironed out. The future of
this team is only a function of
time, he added.
The Bears are first in their
Northern California league. It
is always nice to beat Cal, but it
is especially sweet when it
points the Cardinal in the
direction of being the best in
Northern California.
Stanford showed its
superiority clearly in the first
game, not giving Cal even a
point until the Card had 13.
Cal's coach made three sub
stitutions in an effort to stop
Stanford's rampage. The
Lauchner-Shapiro duo pro
vided the sets and spikes to nail
down the victory.
Stanford temporarily lost its
concentration in the second
game, however. Shapiro-
Lauchner hit a few and Root
was replaced by Bob March for
a time. Cal won the game with a
blitz of fine serving and spiking
after they pulled ahead 8-10.
Stanford revitalized itself in
the third game. Dan Parr and
lon Roofs serving was strong.
Mark Reagan made two extt:!
lent blocks.
The highlight of the game
was when Brett Monello deli
cately placed a ball just behind
two Cal blockers to push Stan
ford ahead 6-1. Stanford al
lowed Cal a total of only three
points.
In the fourth game, Cal put
up a fight, but Jon Root
thwarted the effort with three
superb saves and a clean spike
at the turning point of the
game. Lauchner had an ace at
10-6, and Parr pulled off an ace
at match point
