## Lindsey drowning 'Cats in despair 
### 
Stanford and Arizona passed each
other on an escalator the other day.
Stanford was g"mg up, led by fiery
coach Tom Davis, who showed how a
team that starts it six-foot-one forward
and shoots only marginally from out
side 10 feet ran wmin a conference that
Arizona State c<mc h Rob Weinhauer
thinks is becomii ; one of the nation's
best.
Arizona was going down, dragged by
coach Bob Lindse who showed how a
spirited, talented team could alienate
itsolf so far from motion and place it
self in such a ba: of (onfusion that it
would lose in an. conference in the
nation.
Davis and Lin«i ey showed they are
different, both in qyle and results.

The Sporting Muse

While Stanford battled to a 86-80 win
over ASU Saturday night, Davis and
Weinhauer staged Q feud on the
sidelines that be' ame so hot the refer
ees stepped in
"If your team going to play with
intensity, you ha> e to < oach with inten
sity " said Davis following Saturday
night s game.
But Davis and Weinhauer knew what
the> were doing 1 hey paraded up and
down the sidelines. tip-toeing that fine
line before refoiees start slapping
down tec hnical touls
Davis and Weinhauer respect each
other because there is a little bit of
themselves in the other.
When they are not fuming, they are
sitting with their players or kneeling in
front of them. Davis does not sit down
during basketball games. There isn't
even a chair n .erved for fvm if he
wa; is to. He > op and do»vri the
bench, crouching, talking, teaching
and inspiring.
If there is an opposite, Lindsey is it.
Lindsey left his chair twice during the
Wildcat s 86-69 tell-tale loss to the Car
dinal Monday mgni He stormed onto
the court both times and drew tec hnical
fouls.
It was a big sac rifice, but his team
came to life — or. |u:,t before half
rime, they narrowed a large lead to
seven and cam* 'jut roaring in the sec
ond half.
But it wore «' i
When Lindsey sat back down, he sat

down for good. He sat two chairs away
from his players who showed the to
getherness of a recent OPEC confer
ence.
The rag-tag Stanford bunch, whose
motto should be "We may be small. but
we're slow," whirled by the lethargic
Wildcats so blatantly that superstar
forward Frank Smith could't even ex
plain it.
"I don't know what happened,"
Smith said. "We just don't know what
happened."
Smith is an exceptional player — one
of the conference's best when he is in
spired and a standout even when he is
not.
When he plays you can tell more
about the basketball game by his simple
facial expressions than by looking at the
scoreboard.
In years past, Smith was the leader.
He would yell and his teammates would
hustle. He would raise his hands and
Arizona fans would come to their feet.
He would feel his team in trouble and
he would reach back for a roundabout
slam dunk that would turn the tide. He
could do it. He could always find it in
himself to lead his team through the
storm
tindsev changed all that. He came
from tiny Grand Canvon College last
year with an impressive record. He
brought his tiny college offense with
him.
The leadership role was taken from
Smith and so was the ball
Lindsey's offense is powered by a
pair of guards who have such a free
hand at shot selection that reckless,
off-balance jumpers are some of their
better choices.
The guaids are not an optical illusion,
but they do m-rror each other Br -<-k
Brunkhorst and Trov Cooke have
fashionably-cut blond hair and wear
wristbands but that is about all the
charisma they can muster.
They attack the land and then retreat
while Smith stands underneath spori
ing the grimace that has become his
favorite face.
"They (Arizona guards) said they
couldn't get the ba!l to me" Smith said
"When I got the ball, I thought I dto
pretty well."
Was Smith open?
"I thought so, but they said they
couldn t make the passes."

Once Smith received the ball, he
usually directed it to the hoop with
such a graceful turnaround ease that
the ball seemed to be suspended in
midair. Siv-of-seven shots were good
and so were two-of-three free throws.
Rut the magic in his face was gone
and the team looked lost and the team
looked like it didn't care.
Stanford's swooping, trapping press
had Arizona guards bouncing balls off
of their own legs or throwing them
away. Smith waited for the chances that
would never come, while Lindsey
pouted on the sidelines.
"We had a chance to play and a
chance to win, but the officials took us
out of it, ' Lindsey said.
To be tair, there were close calls and
some close no-calls, but while Smith
and a few substitutes continued on.
Lind>tv pouted.
He was as beaten as the look of de
spair in Smith's eyes.
"We didn't have a plan," said Smith,
finally describing the feeling of playing
tor a coach who gave up before game
time.
"We practiced against the press this
week, but we didn't have a plan."
Still, Arizona showed hope. A pair of
substitutes — John Belobravdic and
Ken F.nsor — looked the spitting image
of Vogi Bear and 800 800 and played
only slightlv better, but they cared and
they tried.
"The talen' is there," said Stanford
guard Keith ]ones, who scored a
career-high 28 points Monday night.
"They just haven't been in a groove.
They remind me of another team last
year. They remind me ot Stanford avear
ago."
Davis took that building block and
c rented what he c alls .♦ "struggling, ?r> •
mg team that plays great basketball
sometimes."
l indsey showed how far off that same
track he is. Lindsey showed how class
less of a man he is, leaving a premier
player like Smith in the final seconds ot
Monday's whitewash to taca Stanford's
"shock troops" — a group of hustling
walk-ons that play with an emotion that
has long left the eyes of Smith.
Frank Smith is a c lass act. He doesn't
deserve to play for a coach who doesn't
give a damn. No one does.

Stanford's swooping, trapping press
had Arizona guards bouncing balls off
of their own legs or throwing them
away. Smith waited for the chances that
would never come, while Lindsey
pouted on the sidelines.
"We had a chance to play and a
chance to win, but the officials took us
out of it, ' Lindsey said.
To be tair, there were close calls and
some close no-calls, but while Smith
and a few substitutes continued on.
Lind>tv pouted.
He was as beaten as the look of de
spair in Smith's eyes.
"We didn't have a plan," said Smith,
finally describing the feeling of playing
tor a coach who gave up before game
time.
"We practiced against the press this
week, but we didn't have a plan."
Still, Arizona showed hope. A pair of
substitutes — John Belobravdic and
Ken F.nsor — looked the spitting image
of Vogi Bear and 800 800 and played
only slightlv better, but they cared and
they tried.
"The talen' is there," said Stanford
guard Keith ]ones, who scored a
career-high 28 points Monday night.
"They just haven't been in a groove.
They remind me of another team last
year. They remind me ot Stanford avear
ago."
Davis took that building block and
c rented what he c alls .♦ "struggling, ?r> •
mg team that plays great basketball
sometimes."
l indsey showed how far off that same
track he is. Lindsey showed how class
less of a man he is, leaving a premier
player like Smith in the final seconds ot
Monday's whitewash to taca Stanford's
"shock troops" — a group of hustling
walk-ons that play with an emotion that
has long left the eyes of Smith.
Frank Smith is a c lass act. He doesn't
deserve to play for a coach who doesn't
give a damn. No one does.
The Sporting Muse appears every
Wednesday in the Dailv.
Stanford and Arizona passed each
other on an escalator the other day.
Stanford was g"mg up, led by fiery
coach Tom Davis, who showed how a
team that starts it six-foot-one forward
and shoots only marginally from out
side 10 feet ran wmin a conference that
Arizona State c<mc h Rob Weinhauer
thinks is becomii ; one of the nation's
best.
Arizona was going down, dragged by
coach Bob Lindse who showed how a
spirited, talented team could alienate
itsolf so far from motion and place it
self in such a ba: of (onfusion that it
would lose in an. conference in the
nation.
Davis and Lin«i ey showed they are
different, both in qyle and results.

The Sporting Muse

While Stanford battled to a 86-80 win
over ASU Saturday night, Davis and
Weinhauer staged Q feud on the
sidelines that be' ame so hot the refer
ees stepped in
"If your team going to play with
intensity, you ha> e to < oach with inten
sity " said Davis following Saturday
night s game.
But Davis and Weinhauer knew what
the> were doing 1 hey paraded up and
down the sidelines. tip-toeing that fine
line before refoiees start slapping
down tec hnical touls
Davis and Weinhauer respect each
other because there is a little bit of
themselves in the other.
When they are not fuming, they are
sitting with their players or kneeling in
front of them. Davis does not sit down
during basketball games. There isn't
even a chair n .erved for fvm if he
wa; is to. He > op and do»vri the
bench, crouching, talking, teaching
and inspiring.
If there is an opposite, Lindsey is it.
Lindsey left his chair twice during the
Wildcat s 86-69 tell-tale loss to the Car
dinal Monday mgni He stormed onto
the court both times and drew tec hnical
fouls.
It was a big sac rifice, but his team
came to life — or. |u:,t before half
rime, they narrowed a large lead to
seven and cam* 'jut roaring in the sec
ond half.
But it wore «' i
When Lindsey sat back down, he sat

down for good. He sat two chairs away
from his players who showed the to
getherness of a recent OPEC confer
ence.
The rag-tag Stanford bunch, whose
motto should be "We may be small. but
we're slow," whirled by the lethargic
Wildcats so blatantly that superstar
forward Frank Smith could't even ex
plain it.
"I don't know what happened,"
Smith said. "We just don't know what
happened."
Smith is an exceptional player — one
of the conference's best when he is in
spired and a standout even when he is
not.
When he plays you can tell more
about the basketball game by his simple
facial expressions than by looking at the
scoreboard.
In years past, Smith was the leader.
He would yell and his teammates would
hustle. He would raise his hands and
Arizona fans would come to their feet.
He would feel his team in trouble and
he would reach back for a roundabout
slam dunk that would turn the tide. He
could do it. He could always find it in
himself to lead his team through the
storm
tindsev changed all that. He came
from tiny Grand Canvon College last
year with an impressive record. He
brought his tiny college offense with
him.
The leadership role was taken from
Smith and so was the ball
Lindsey's offense is powered by a
pair of guards who have such a free
hand at shot selection that reckless,
off-balance jumpers are some of their
better choices.
The guaids are not an optical illusion,
but they do m-rror each other Br -<-k
Brunkhorst and Trov Cooke have
fashionably-cut blond hair and wear
wristbands but that is about all the
charisma they can muster.
They attack the land and then retreat
while Smith stands underneath spori
ing the grimace that has become his
favorite face.
"They (Arizona guards) said they
couldn't get the ba!l to me" Smith said
"When I got the ball, I thought I dto
pretty well."
Was Smith open?
"I thought so, but they said they
couldn t make the passes."

Once Smith received the ball, he
usually directed it to the hoop with
such a graceful turnaround ease that
the ball seemed to be suspended in
midair. Siv-of-seven shots were good
and so were two-of-three free throws.
Rut the magic in his face was gone
and the team looked lost and the team
looked like it didn't care.
