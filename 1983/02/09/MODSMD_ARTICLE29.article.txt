# Over the weekend....
## Gymnasts fall on the road 
### SARAH CARREL 
The Cardinal gymnastics team had a tough trip
south last weekend. They came away without
victories, but with lots of resolution and experi
ence.
The women fell to USC with a score of 177.15
to 167.0. The men met with fourth-ranked
Arizona and eighth-ranked New Mexico and
finished third. The score of the Tempe, Arizona
meet was Arizona 278.20, New Mexico 272.90
and Stanford 263.85.
The turning point of the women's meet was
the loss of the fifth all-around gymnast of the
year to injuries, junior karen Hall was dismount
ing from the uneven parallel bars when she
struck her toot in mid-swing, possibly fracturing
the bone.
Filling her place for the rest of the meet were
junior Caryn Lucido and sophomore Vicky
Worden, who did outstanding jobs considering
the short notice they had to prepare for their
events, according to head coach Homer Sar
dina.
Sardina cited two bright spots to the other
wise dismal weekend: freshman Dell Wilkinson
was not scheduled to compete in the floor exer
cises, but came through in the clutch to score an
8.45. Junior Anne Friend was not even sched
uled to go on the trip, but completed an out
standing bar routine of 8.40.
Sardina said the relaxed approach of the USC
officials was detrimental to his team. "There was
no indication that we were in a competition," he
said. "It wasn't handled in a professional way."
The equipment was not set up in time for the
meet, some of it was in bad condition and the
judging was erratic, he said.
Nevertheless, the trip was a good opportunity
to pull together his iniury-ridden team, Sardina
said. "We learned a lot. It was a positive trip in
that we know we have to bear down."
The men had a major problem with the un
familiar equipment, resulting in about 20 major
mistakes. "It takes an inexperienced gymnast a
long time to adjust his body to new equipment,"
said head coach Sadao Hamada. "So it is very
difficult to do the best job at away meets."
The Cardinal was more affected than usual in
Saturday's meet, resulting in one of the lowest
scores they have recently tallied. Hamada also
cited unpredictable judging as another factor in
the low score.
