Two more storms are expected to
hit the Stanford area this week,
bringingeven more rain and winds to
an already saturated campus.
Forecasters at the San Francisco
Airport predicted a new storm this
morning will bring 15-35 mile-per
hour winds and more than one-third
inch of rain, while another weaker
storm is expected to hit the area to
night.
The series of winter storms that
have pelted the University duringthe

past two months has already cost the
University an estimated $75,000 in
damages and extra cleaning, accord
ing to lames Horgan, head of opera
tions and maintenance.
"This has been a pretty tough year.
And it's beginning to become kind of
a major problem keeping the plant
going with one storm after another,"
Horgan said.
Horgan said his major concern has
been the flooding of buildings, in
cluding the suites, Seeley G. Mudd
chemistry building and Braun Hall.

Minor flooding also occurred last
night in the basements of Dinkelspiel
Auditorium and the Law School,
Horgan said.
"Fortunately, none of the prob
lems have been major. Tresidder was
the only shutdown we've had," Hor
gan said.
Rain has fallen here during 17 of
the past 24 days. Rainfall at the San
Francisco airport has already totalled
29.4 inches since July 1 compared to a
normal 12.93 inches.
