Mantle barred from baseball
New York — Hall of Fame slugger Mickey
Mantle, like Willie Mays before him, was
barred yesterday from coaching or front-of
fice positions in baseball for accepting a pro
motional job with a hotel-casino.
Commissioner Bowie Kuhn ordered
Mantle, the former New York Yankees great,
to give up his part-time coaching position
with the team because he took the $100,000-
a-year promotions job with Claridge Hotel
and Casino, Atlantic City, N.J., as the director
of sports promotions.
"I got a hand-carried letter today from the
commissioner," said Mantle. "I'm gone ...
I'm out of baseball."
Kuhn's decision followed the precedent he
set 3V2 years ago when he told Mays to give
up his long-term, $50,000-a-year post with the
New York Mets after he accepted a casino
promotions job at Bally's Park Place.
"I have told Mickey that I have no choice,"
Kuhn said in a prepared statement. "His situ
ation is like Willie Mays'. Baseball and casino
employment are inconsistent."
Mantle said he had gotten a letter from
Kuhn trying to persuade him to turn down
the casino job, which he will hold on an an
nual renewal basis.
"I wasn't much involved in baseball any
how. I just went to spring training and helped
the hitters," said Mantle, who had worked as
a Yankees batting coach. "I won't miss what I
was doing. I was just standing around signing
autographs."
Raiders suit filed
Los Angeles — A taxpayers' lawsuit was
filed in Superior Court on Monday asking for
an injunction invalidating the Coliseum
Commission's agreement to bring the Raid
ers' football team to Los Angeles.
The suit, filed by attorney Dana Cole of
Century City, Calif., and UCLA law student
John Shur of Marina del Rey, Calif., also asked
the return of $675,000 in rent credits ad
vanced to the Raiders.
Cole said he is a fan of the Raiders, but has
become convinced that $6.7 million to be giv
en to the National Football League team in
the first four years of its tenancy # in rent cred
its and outright payments constitutes an illicit
giveaway of public funds.
The suit also charged that in allowing Davis
to construct luxury boxes on the Coliseum
rim, the commission has violated the Los An
geles City Charter requiring public bidding
for such projects.

No more violations for USF
Mission, Kan. — Reviews of past violations
in the men's basketball programs at the Uni
versity of San Francisco and the University of
California-Irvine have been completed, and
no further penalties will be imposed, the
NCAA announced Monday.
The University of San Francisco, hit with
penalties in 1979 and 1980 by the NCAA,
dropped its men's basketball program after
the school discovered more violations last
summer and reported them to the NCAA.
"The Committee on Infractions wishes to
express its support of the prompt and de
cisive action by the University of San Francis
co in this case," said Charles Alan Wright,
committee chairman. "It appears that in this
case, the misguided athletic interests of a few
individuals created a situation in which the
educational values and goals of the institu
tion were being set aside."
