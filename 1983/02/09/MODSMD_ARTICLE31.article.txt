The women's swimming team suffered
its first dual meet loss on Saturday to a tough
Texas squad. 78-71.
"We swam better than in any meet we've
been in all year," head coach George Haines
said. But it was Texas' best meet of the year as
well, he added.
It was an afternoon in which the Longhorns
did just a little bit better than the Cardinal.
The opening race, the 400 medley relay, set
the tone for the meet. The Cardinal swam a
school record 3:44.89. But Texas bettered
that time and set its own school record of
3:43.49.
Freshman Patty Gavin also set a school re
cord of 1:59.14 in the 200 buttertly, but Texas
once again edged out the Card in 1:58.18.
kathy Smith set a school record in the 100
breaststroke with 1:03.15. Sophomore
Marybeth Linzmeier won the 200 freestyle in
1:46.77. Freshman Diana Zock captured the
100 freestyle in 50.72. All of these clockings
bettered NCAA qualifying standards.
The diving, usually a strength, failed to
provide the necessary support. Sophomore
lean Meyer placed third in the one meter and
second in the three meter boards. But Texas
outscored the Cardinal 14-4 in the diving
events.
The Cardinal made a brilliant attempt at a
comeback in the last two races, sweeping the
400 IM, Gavin winning in 4:16.12, to tie the
score at 71.
In the final race, the 400 freestyle relay,
Stanford swam an excelent 3:20.52, but Texas

Haines said, "Losing is hard, but you gain a
lot by losing this type ot meet." Gavin and
Libby kinkead, coming off an injury, had an
especially fine meet, he said.
The diving coach Rick Schavone, was un
able to accompany them to Texas due to ill
ness.
Haines said he was satisfied overall. The
Cardinal still has a strong c hance at the NCAA
Championships. "We have a shot at the
NCAA's because of our depth, he said.
The Cardinal travels across the Bay Satur
day to fare UC-Berkeley.
