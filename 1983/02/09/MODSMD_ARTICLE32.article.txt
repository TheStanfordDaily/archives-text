University graduate ]immy jett, 26,
remembered by students for his role
as drum major of the Leland Stanford
Junior University Marching Band
(LS)UMB), was killed Sunday when
he was struck by cars and a truck on
Highway 99 in Bakersfield.
Lett was on his way back from a
basketball game at a nearby park at
about 6 p.m. He was struck by a
semi-trailer and at least two cars and
died at the scene of the accident, his
family said.
"He was one of the best drum
majors the band has ever had. He
was musically talented, dynamic and
a really nice guy," said Alex Jar
detsky, LS)UMB assistant manager in
1977. Jett was drum major in 1976-77
and 1977-78.
After graduation, Jett pursued his
interest in music, playing with the
punk band Raw Meat and, on one

occasion, the Fab Mab Band. He also
worked for Failure Analysis As
sociates.
Rich Johnson, the LSJUMB man
ager in 1977, said that in the past Jett
had experienced some petty ciime
and mental problems. But he said, "it
appeared that he had gotten his act
together and was back to the person
we all know and loved." Bob Moog,
Class of '78, added, "The memories
are very, very good."
A graduate of Hoover High School
in Fresno, Jett was a member of the
Theta Xi fraternity here.
Jett is survived by his parents,
James and Aretha Jett, of Bakersfield,
and three brothers, Matthew, of
Bakersfield, and Christopher and
Jordon, both of Fresno. The family
has asked that contributions be sent
to the LSJUMB or to a charity of the
donor's choice. Services will be held
at the Hobson funeral home in
Bakersfield.
