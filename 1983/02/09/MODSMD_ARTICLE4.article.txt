# Indirect costs significant
## 
### DOUGLAS JEHL Senior staff writer 
In common language, they're
known as overhead. In a university,
they include constructing buildings,
lighting labs and administrating de
partments. At a university the size of
Stanford, they add up to big bucks.
Asa result, indirect cost recovery is
a key concern of administrators here.
Because indirect costs are substantial
— in research, their total is more
than two-thirds of net direct research
costs — the University has histori
cally devoted substantial amounts of
money and time to recovering every
cent to which it was entitled. Yet
apart from those who work with
them directly — researchers and
some administrators — most mem
bers of the community are befuddled
by the notion of indirect costs.
These costs are different from di
rect costs in that they can not be as
sociated with a particular research
project. Associate controller Frank
Kiddle, an expert on indirect costs
and their recovery, has written a
chapter on the subject for a book
entitled College and University Busi
ness Administration. Indirect costs,
Riddle writes, "are those that have
been incurred for purposes common
to a number or all of the specific
projects, programs or activities of an
institutionm, but which cannot be
identified and charged directly to
such projects, programs or activities
