# Indirect costs significant
## 
### DOUGLAS JEHL Senior staff writer 
In common language, they're
known as overhead. In a university,
they include constructing buildings,
lighting labs and administrating de
partments. At a university the size of
Stanford, they add up to big bucks.
Asa result, indirect cost recovery is
a key concern of administrators here.
Because indirect costs are substantial
— in research, their total is more
than two-thirds of net direct research
costs — the University has histori
cally devoted substantial amounts of
money and time to recovering every
cent to which it was entitled. Yet
apart from those who work with
them directly — researchers and
some administrators — most mem
bers of the community are befuddled
by the notion of indirect costs.
These costs are different from di
rect costs in that they can not be as
sociated with a particular research
project. Associate controller Frank
Kiddle, an expert on indirect costs
and their recovery, has written a
chapter on the subject for a book
entitled College and University Busi
ness Administration. Indirect costs,
Riddle writes, "are those that have
been incurred for purposes common
to a number or all of the specific
projects, programs or activities of an
institutionm, but which cannot be
identified and charged directly to
such projects, programs or activities
relatively easily with a reasonable
degree of accuracy. . ."
"Examples include such items as
heating, lighting, air conditioning
and janitorial services of buildings
and administrative services such as
accounting, purchasing, personnel
and library services."
These indirect costs are added up
— pooled — and then allocated to
the individual research projects ac
cording to an indirect cost recovery
rate. This rate — a percentage of di
rect costs — is calculated according
to cost-accounting procedures and
recovery principles set out in an Of
fice of Management and Budget
manual, Circular A-21. It is estab
lished as part of the budgetary pro
cess through negotiations between
the university, represented here by
Riddle, and the federal government.
The current rate at Stanford is 69

percent of net total direct costs. This
ranks at the top end of the spectrum
of universities nationwide — some
public universities have cost re
covery rates nearing 30 percent —
but is far lower than in much of pri
vate industry.
The actual direct cost recovery rate
is rarely entirely accurate because
rates are based on predictions. Ac
tual experience — what the costs re
ally are and what the research vol
ume really is — usually differs from
the prediction. This variance —
either positive or negative — is called
a "carryforward" and is either cred
ited to or charged against a university
in recovery rate negotiations two or
three years hence.
The University currently carries a
positive carryforward from the past
two years totaling nearly $18 million.
This substantial carryforward is one
of the many factors that threatens to
push the indirect cost recovery rate
here to a level researchers and ad
ministrators find unacceptable.
