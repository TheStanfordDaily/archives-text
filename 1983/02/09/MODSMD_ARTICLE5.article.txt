Sharon blamed for massacre
Jerusalem — In a stunning rebuke to the govern
ment of Prime Minister Menachem Begin, the Israeli
commission that investigated the Beirut massacre of
Palestinian refugees declared yesterday that Israel
bears clear "indirect responsibility" for the slaughter
and called for the ouster of Defense Minister Ariel
Sharon.
The report, which said Sharon had "disregarded
the danger of acts of vengeance and bloodshed ...
against the population of the refugee camps,"
plunged the Begin government into turmoil and pro
duced intense pressure for Sharon to resign. The Is
rae'' Cabinet met in emergency session for more than
an hour yesterday to discuss the findings but reached

no decisions and is to meet again today.
Sharon reportedly was initially defiant of the calls
for his ouster, indicating that he did not intend to
leave the government without a fight. Speaking to po
litical supporters in Tel Aviv tonight, the defense min
ister said it was unimportant what the commission de
cided and called on Israelis to overcome man
ifestations of "weakness of resolve" in the country.
It was widely expected last night that today's Cabi
net meeting would produce the first concrete de
cisions by the Begin government in response to the
commission report. A senior official said after yester
day's Cabinet meeting that there was near unanimous
support for following the commission's recommen
dations and noted pointedly that they include two
possible alternatives for Sharon — resignation or dis
missal by Begin.
But Avraham Shapira, head of the ultra-orthodox
Agudat Israel Party that is part of the government
coaltion, quoted Begin as saying at a meeting yester
day afternoon that he would neither dismiss Sharon
nor ask for his resignation. Israel radio reported that
the prime minister took the same position during the
Cabinet meeting.
It appeared that many members of the Begin gov
ernment hoped the defense minister would take it
upon himself to resign, relieving some of the pressure
on the government.
Bush reassures French
Paris — Vice President George Bush assured France
yesterday that under no circumstances wiil the United
States accept a Soviet demand to include French and
British missiles in the Geneva negotiations on in
termediate nuclear forces.
"There is no flexibility in the U.S. position on this.
We concur fully with the position taken by the
French," Bush said at a news conference at the end of
a day of discussions with President Francois Mitter
rand and other top French government ministers.
The Soviets have offered, without giving details, to
reduce their deployment of SS-20 intermediate-range

missiles targeted against Western Europe to the same
total as that of the independent British and French de
terrent forces combined —162 missiles. However, the
Soviet offer is conditional on the United States aban
doning its plans to deploy 572 new cruise and Per
shing 2 missiles in North Atlantic Treaty Organization
countries.
"The French and British forces are strategic de
terrents and they cannot substitute for the U.S. nucle
ar guarantee to all of NATO," Bush said.
"We insist on Soviet-U.S. equality in arms control
and I would simply ask what's wrong with equality?
Taking into account these French and British systems
as the Soviets propose would lead to a Soviet
monopoly of intermediate missiles, thus decoupling
the U.S. forces from Europe. So there is no flexibility
in the U.S. position."
House eyes defense cuts
Washington — Chairman Joseph Addabbo (D-
N.Y.), of the House Appropriations subcommittee on
defense said yesterday he will try to cut $30 billion
from President Reagan's new defense budget.
He set his target after Defense Secretary Caspar
Weinberger told the subcommittee that cutting the
fiscal 1984 military budget "would do severe damage
to the security of the country."
The $30 billion would be in spending authority
rather than money actually to be spent by the Pen

tagon in the year beginning Oct. 1. Addabbo esti
mated it would translate into a spending cut of about
$15 billion for the year.
The part of the Pentagon budget before Addabbo's
subcommittee totals $265 billion, which includes the
big-ticket items but not military construction.
Addabbo said his cutting would zero in on Army
Pershing II missiles, Navy nuclear-powered aircraft
carriers, Air Force MX intercontinental missiles and
B1 bombers.
Asked what his chances were of making a $30
billion cut, Addabbo replied: "In the subcommittee,
questionable. On the floor, pretty good possibility."
EPA under fire
Washington — The embattled Environmental Pro
tection Agency was accused yesterday by a House
committee chairman and by three EPA officialsof ma
nipulating for political purposes the agency's $1.6-
biilion fund for cleaning up the nation's most danger
ous hazardous waste dumps.
The EPA officials, who requested anonymity, said
that several toxic waste dumps were placed on an
"election track" last fall, preventing any money from
being spent on cleaning them up or prosecuting il
legal dumping for fear it might help Democrats run
ning in surrounding areas.

Hitachi pleads guilty
San Francisco — Hitachi Ltd., Japan's largest in
dustrial company, pleaded guilty yesterday along
with two employees to charges that they conspired to
send computer secrets stolen from IBM to Japan.
In exchange for the company's plea and a $10,000
fine, the federal government said there would be no
further criminal charges against Hitachi, its officers or
employees stemming from the highly controversial
industrial espionage case.
Hitachi's board of directors had authorized the
guilty pleas, company lawyer Peter Fleming said.
The two employees who pleaded guilty under an
agreement with the federal government, Kenji Hay
ashi and Isao Ohnishi, must pay $10000 and $4000 tines
respectively. Hayashi also faces five years' probation,
and Ohnishi two years.

a day of discussions with President Francois Mitter
rand and other top French government ministers.
The Soviets have offered, without giving details, to
reduce their deployment of SS-20 intermediate-range

missiles targeted against Western Europe to the same
total as that of the independent British and French de
terrent forces combined —162 missiles. However, the
Soviet offer is conditional on the United States aban
doning its plans to deploy 572 new cruise and Per
shing 2 missiles in North Atlantic Treaty Organization
countries.
"The French and British forces are strategic de
terrents and they cannot substitute for the U.S. nucle
ar guarantee to all of NATO," Bush said.
"We insist on Soviet-U.S. equality in arms control
and I would simply ask what's wrong with equality?
Taking into account these French and British systems
as the Soviets propose would lead to a Soviet
monopoly of intermediate missiles, thus decoupling
the U.S. forces from Europe. So there is no flexibility
in the U.S. position."
House eyes defense cuts
Washington — Chairman Joseph Addabbo (D-
N.Y.), of the House Appropriations subcommittee on
defense said yesterday he will try to cut $30 billion
from President Reagan's new defense budget.
He set his target after Defense Secretary Caspar
Weinberger told the subcommittee that cutting the
fiscal 1984 military budget "would do severe damage
to the security of the country."
The $30 billion would be in spending authority
rather than money actually to be spent by the Pen

tagon in the year beginning Oct. 1. Addabbo esti
mated it would translate into a spending cut of about
$15 billion for the year.
The part of the Pentagon budget before Addabbo's
subcommittee totals $265 billion, which includes the
big-ticket items but not military construction.
Addabbo said his cutting would zero in on Army
Pershing II missiles, Navy nuclear-powered aircraft
carriers, Air Force MX intercontinental missiles and
B1 bombers.
Asked what his chances were of making a $30
billion cut, Addabbo replied: "In the subcommittee,
questionable. On the floor, pretty good possibility."
EPA under fire
Washington — The embattled Environmental Pro
tection Agency was accused yesterday by a House
committee chairman and by three EPA officialsof ma
nipulating for political purposes the agency's $1.6-
biilion fund for cleaning up the nation's most danger
ous hazardous waste dumps.
The EPA officials, who requested anonymity, said
that several toxic waste dumps were placed on an
"election track" last fall, preventing any money from
being spent on cleaning them up or prosecuting il
legal dumping for fear it might help Democrats run
ning in surrounding areas.

Hitachi pleads guilty
San Francisco — Hitachi Ltd., Japan's largest in
dustrial company, pleaded guilty yesterday along
with two employees to charges that they conspired to

further criminal charges against Hitachi, its officers or
employees stemming from the highly controversial
industrial espionage case.
Hitachi's board of directors had authorized the
guilty pleas, company lawyer Peter Fleming said.
The two employees who pleaded guilty under an
agreement with the federal government, Kenji Hay
ashi and Isao Ohnishi, must pay $10000 and $4000 tines
respectively. Hayashi also faces five years' probation,
and Ohnishi two years.

Sharon blamed for massacre
Jerusalem — In a stunning rebuke to the govern
ment of Prime Minister Menachem Begin, the Israeli
commission that investigated the Beirut massacre of
Palestinian refugees declared yesterday that Israel
bears clear "indirect responsibility" for the slaughter
and called for the ouster of Defense Minister Ariel
Sharon.
The report, which said Sharon had "disregarded
the danger of acts of vengeance and bloodshed ...
against the population of the refugee camps,"
plunged the Begin government into turmoil and pro
duced intense pressure for Sharon to resign. The Is
rae'' Cabinet met in emergency session for more than
an hour yesterday to discuss the findings but reached

no decisions and is to meet again today.
Sharon reportedly was initially defiant of the calls
for his ouster, indicating that he did not intend to
leave the government without a fight. Speaking to po
litical supporters in Tel Aviv tonight, the defense min
ister said it was unimportant what the commission de
cided and called on Israelis to overcome man
ifestations of "weakness of resolve" in the country.
It was widely expected last night that today's Cabi
net meeting would produce the first concrete de
cisions by the Begin government in response to the
commission report. A senior official said after yester
day's Cabinet meeting that there was near unanimous
support for following the commission's recommen
dations and noted pointedly that they include two
possible alternatives for Sharon — resignation or dis
missal by Begin.
But Avraham Shapira, head of the ultra-orthodox
Agudat Israel Party that is part of the government
coaltion, quoted Begin as saying at a meeting yester
day afternoon that he would neither dismiss Sharon
nor ask for his resignation. Israel radio reported that
the prime minister took the same position during the
Cabinet meeting.
It appeared that many members of the Begin gov
ernment hoped the defense minister would take it
upon himself to resign, relieving some of the pressure
on the government.
Bush reassures French
Paris — Vice President George Bush assured France
yesterday that under no circumstances wiil the United
States accept a Soviet demand to include French and
British missiles in the Geneva negotiations on in
termediate nuclear forces.

French," Bush said at a news conference at the end of
