# Animal facility approved approved
## Trustees hike tuition 
### HEATHER MILLAR 
In what participants called a
"smooth . . . more routine than
usual" meeting, the board of trus
tees yesterday placed its final stamp
of approval on tuition/board rates for
next year.
The board also approved plans to
resurface the inner Quad and con
struct a Research Animal Facility at
the Medical Center.
The 9.8 percent tuition increase
approved yesterday fell short of the
12 percent forecast last year. This
welcome reprieve is a function of the
lowered national inflation rate and
University efforts to cut costs, ac
cording to Raymond Bachetti, vice
provost and director of University
budgets.
While tuition is the University's
largest source of income, Bachetti
said the smaller increase will affect
the '83-'B4 budget indirectly rather
than directly.
"It's our job to control expenses so
as to not drive tuition up," said Pro
vost Al Hastorf, reiterating the prem
ise he outlined at a tuition briefing
Monday.
Hastorf said he could not predict
how long the administration could
hold the line on tuition though he
said he would like to see the rate of
increase remain constant. "We're
desperately trying to control ex
penses," he said.
The '83-'B4 budget, to be pre
sented to the board next month, may
be cut by as much as $2.2 million
Bachetti said.
Reflecting this conservation effort,
the money allotted for general plant
improvements (CPI) approved by the
board suffered a cut of $5 million,

from $8 million in '82-'B3 to $3 million
in '83-'B4.
This fund — which covers con
struction and maintenance of
facilities such as roads which benefit
the whole campus — has fluctuated
from year to year. But this cut is at
tributable to concern over the
budget, according to Gene Ker
shner, associate director of project
management.
Of the many areas covered by the
GPI, the planning department may
have to defer or reduce services in
bike parking, lighting and traffic
management, said campus planner
Judy Chan.
With a projected budget of $12 mil
lion, the Research Animal Facility was
easily the largest project approved by
the board. In a fairly unusual move,
partial debt financing was approved
to help pay for the building. Adminis
trators attributed this concession —
debt financing is usually avoided —
the urgent need for the building.
"It (the facility) is extremely
necessary. The research program is
currently in jeopardy because of the
condition of the animals," said Ker
shner. "We simply had to go this
route."
The animal research facility is a
high priority, said Gerald Lieberman,
dean of graduate studies and re
search. "In order to do good
biomedical research, you need good
and humane facilities for the ani
mals. Our current facilities are old
and outmoded."
The facility has been under con
sideration by the board since last
June. Work should begin on the
project this summer.
Construction of a new building for
the Center for Integrated Systems
was also approved.
The board granted concept ap
proval to an array of other construc
tion proposals. Further exploration
of the extension of Willow Road, the
restoration of the Red Barn, a
steam/electricity cogeneration
plant, and an extension of the Stan
ford Synchroton Radiation Labora
tory were all approved.
