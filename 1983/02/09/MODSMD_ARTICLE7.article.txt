# University faces tough choice on cost recovery
## 
### DOUGLAS JEHL Senior staff writer 
Confronted by skyrocketing over
head costs for research, adminis
trators here are enmeshed in a trying
dilemma — to find a way to maintain
full recovery of research costs with
out pricing investigators out of the
market or alienating federal funding
agencies.
No decisions have yet been made,
but it is certain that the University
will choose actions that will keep the
indirect cost recovery rate lower than
projected — and might even choose
to abandon the policy of full recovery
to which they have long been com
mitted.
Although these would mean deep
budget cuts and the possible forgo
ing of millions of research dollars,
administrators consider them fiscally
responsible — and politically neces
sary — moves.
Prohibitively complicated, the
issue — presented to the Academic
Council last week and the board of
trustees yesterday — is one of pro
found concern for nearly everyone
associated with the University. Ad
ministrators know backing away
from full recovery will lead to signifi
cant budgetary sacrifice. But they,
like investigators, worry that indirect
costs have become prohibitively
high.
Both are afraid that continued full
recovery would force research spon
sors to allocate money elsewhere
and might drive the federal govern
ment to impose crippling restrictions
on research funding.
The focus of the problem is the
indirect cost recovery rate the Uni
versity charges government spon
sors of research. The rate currently
stands at 69 percent — one of the
highest in the nation.
And it threatens to climb even
higher: because indirect costs con
tinue to rise, and because even the 69

percent rate has failed to cover all the
costs to which the University is enti
tled, Stanford could up the rate to
about 82 percent for the coming
year.
That, it is commonly agreed, is far
too high. Rates at public universities
which compete with Stanford for re
search funds are as low as 30 percent.
Based on this comparison, proposals
have already been made in Washing
ton to put government ceilings on
indirect rates. This, according to a
background paper circulated to the
board last week, "would be catas
trophic for the privates."

But the question of how to reduce
the recovery rate is by no means re
solved, although a combination of
budget reductions and changes in
accounting procedures to spread out
costs will clearly be a central part of
the final plan.
Some believe that alone will be
sufficient. "It may very well be possi
ble that with (those measures) we
may be able to maintain a rate close
to the current rate and still maintain
the principle of full recovery," said
Gerald Lieberman. vice provost and
dean of graduate studies and re
search.
President Donald Kennedy is more

skeptical. "If all of these different
mechanisms succeeded very well,
we might be OK," he said. "My own
guess is that it's going to be hard to
do that much budget cutting."
In his address last week to the
Academic Council and in the back
ground paper, Kennedy said it was
likely that the University would have
to back away from full recovery. But
yesterday he shied away from com
mitting the University to such an ac
tion, and emphasized that no final
decisions have been made.
The purpose of yesterday's pre
sentation to the board was educa
tional, according to Kennedy; no
policy decision was made.
"They (board members) are saying
it's a tough call," Kennedy said.
No decision need be made until
the University and the Office of Naval
Research, the government's auditor
for Stanford research, meet later this
year to negotiate a new rate for the
coming year. The University will
likely enter negotiations committed
to full recovery, Lieberman said. But
both Kennedy and Lieberman said
the rate for next year would most
probably be at or near the current 69
percent.
The problem is far less murky than
the potential solution. Adminis

trators and faculty here agreethat the
indirect cost recovery rate must re
main as low as possible because of
the growing competition with other
universities and increasing animosity
from the federal government.
They cite the fact that research
volume here declined last year for
the first time in University history,
and mention the ceiling proposal in
troduced by the National Institute of
Health.
"I worry about that rate because
you got to worry about that rate . . .
you just can't have that continuing
increase without realizing that there
will be repercussions. Vou got to
worry. We're going to do all we can
to really keep that rate down,"
Lieberman said.
Lieberman described an elastic
economic market in explaining the
situation. "You have to understand
that you don't just turn a crank and
say 'here's the money.' The faculty
has to get the research contracts and
grants. You could argue very well
that there exists a point at which if
you increase the indirects you'll de
crease the volume."
According to Lieberman, there are
naive people in Washington wonder
ing why Berkeley can do research at
an indirect cost rate of 40 percent
while Stanford charges 69 percent.
"They don't understand that what
the argument is that what the federal
government doesn't pay is picked up
by the state government — there's
no incentive for the university to go
out and get full recovery."

market or alienating federal funding
agencies.
No decisions have yet been made,
but it is certain that the University
will choose actions that will keep the
indirect cost recovery rate lower than
projected — and might even choose
to abandon the policy of full recovery
to which they have long been com
mitted.
Although these would mean deep
budget cuts and the possible forgo
ing of millions of research dollars,
administrators consider them fiscally
responsible — and politically neces
sary — moves.
Prohibitively complicated, the
issue — presented to the Academic
Council last week and the board of
trustees yesterday — is one of pro
found concern for nearly everyone
associated with the University. Ad
ministrators know backing away
from full recovery will lead to signifi
cant budgetary sacrifice. But they,
like investigators, worry that indirect
costs have become prohibitively
high.
Both are afraid that continued full
recovery would force research spon
sors to allocate money elsewhere
and might drive the federal govern
ment to impose crippling restrictions
on research funding.
The focus of the problem is the
indirect cost recovery rate the Uni
versity charges government spon
sors of research. The rate currently
stands at 69 percent — one of the
highest in the nation.
And it threatens to climb even
higher: because indirect costs con
tinue to rise, and because even the 69

percent rate has failed to cover all the
costs to which the University is enti
tled, Stanford could up the rate to
about 82 percent for the coming
year.
That, it is commonly agreed, is far
too high. Rates at public universities
which compete with Stanford for re
search funds are as low as 30 percent.
Based on this comparison, proposals
have already been made in Washing
ton to put government ceilings on
indirect rates. This, according to a
background paper circulated to the
board last week, "would be catas
trophic for the privates."

But the question of how to reduce
the recovery rate is by no means re
solved, although a combination of
budget reductions and changes in
accounting procedures to spread out
costs will clearly be a central part of
the final plan.
Some believe that alone will be
sufficient. "It may very well be possi
ble that with (those measures) we
may be able to maintain a rate close
to the current rate and still maintain
the principle of full recovery," said
Gerald Lieberman. vice provost and
dean of graduate studies and re
search.
President Donald Kennedy is more

skeptical. "If all of these different
mechanisms succeeded very well,
we might be OK," he said. "My own
guess is that it's going to be hard to
do that much budget cutting."
In his address last week to the
Academic Council and in the back
ground paper, Kennedy said it was
likely that the University would have
to back away from full recovery. But
yesterday he shied away from com
mitting the University to such an ac
tion, and emphasized that no final
decisions have been made.
The purpose of yesterday's pre
sentation to the board was educa
tional, according to Kennedy; no
policy decision was made.
"They (board members) are saying
it's a tough call," Kennedy said.
No decision need be made until
the University and the Office of Naval
Research, the government's auditor
for Stanford research, meet later this
year to negotiate a new rate for the
coming year. The University will
likely enter negotiations committed
to full recovery, Lieberman said. But
both Kennedy and Lieberman said
the rate for next year would most
probably be at or near the current 69
percent.
The problem is far less murky than
the potential solution. Adminis

trators and faculty here agreethat the
indirect cost recovery rate must re
main as low as possible because of
the growing competition with other
universities and increasing animosity
from the federal government.
They cite the fact that research
volume here declined last year for
the first time in University history,
and mention the ceiling proposal in
troduced by the National Institute of
Health.
"I worry about that rate because
you got to worry about that rate . . .
you just can't have that continuing
increase without realizing that there
will be repercussions. Vou got to
worry. We're going to do all we can
to really keep that rate down,"
Lieberman said.
Lieberman described an elastic
economic market in explaining the
situation. "You have to understand
that you don't just turn a crank and
say 'here's the money.' The faculty
has to get the research contracts and
grants. You could argue very well
that there exists a point at which if
you increase the indirects you'll de
crease the volume."
According to Lieberman, there are
naive people in Washington wonder
ing why Berkeley can do research at
an indirect cost rate of 40 percent
while Stanford charges 69 percent.
"They don't understand that what
the argument is that what the federal
government doesn't pay is picked up
by the state government — there's
no incentive for the university to go
out and get full recovery."
Confronted by skyrocketing over
head costs for research, adminis
trators here are enmeshed in a trying
dilemma — to find a way to maintain
full recovery of research costs with
out pricing investigators out of the
market or alienating federal funding
agencies.
No decisions have yet been made,
but it is certain that the University
will choose actions that will keep the
indirect cost recovery rate lower than
