# University faces tough choice on cost recovery
## 
### DOUGLAS JEHL Senior staff writer 
Confronted by skyrocketing over
head costs for research, adminis
trators here are enmeshed in a trying
dilemma — to find a way to maintain
full recovery of research costs with
out pricing investigators out of the
market or alienating federal funding
agencies.
No decisions have yet been made,
but it is certain that the University
will choose actions that will keep the
indirect cost recovery rate lower than
projected — and might even choose
to abandon the policy of full recovery
to which they have long been com
mitted.
Although these would mean deep
budget cuts and the possible forgo
ing of millions of research dollars,
administrators consider them fiscally
responsible — and politically neces
sary — moves.
Prohibitively complicated, the
issue — presented to the Academic
Council last week and the board of
trustees yesterday — is one of pro
found concern for nearly everyone
associated with the University. Ad
ministrators know backing away
from full recovery will lead to signifi
cant budgetary sacrifice. But they,
like investigators, worry that indirect
costs have become prohibitively
high.
Both are afraid that continued full
recovery would force research spon
sors to allocate money elsewhere
and might drive the federal govern
ment to impose crippling restrictions
on research funding.
The focus of the problem is the
indirect cost recovery rate the Uni
versity charges government spon
sors of research. The rate currently
stands at 69 percent — one of the
highest in the nation.
And it threatens to climb even
higher: because indirect costs con
tinue to rise, and because even the 69

percent rate has failed to cover all the
costs to which the University is enti
tled, Stanford could up the rate to
about 82 percent for the coming
year.
That, it is commonly agreed, is far
too high. Rates at public universities
which compete with Stanford for re
search funds are as low as 30 percent.
Based on this comparison, proposals
have already been made in Washing
ton to put government ceilings on
indirect rates. This, according to a
background paper circulated to the
board last week, "would be catas
trophic for the privates."

But the question of how to reduce
the recovery rate is by no means re
solved, although a combination of
budget reductions and changes in
accounting procedures to spread out
costs will clearly be a central part of
the final plan.
Some believe that alone will be
sufficient. "It may very well be possi
ble that with (those measures) we
may be able to maintain a rate close
to the current rate and still maintain
the principle of full recovery," said
Gerald Lieberman. vice provost and
dean of graduate studies and re
search.
