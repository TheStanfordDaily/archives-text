A newly developed vaccine for hepatitis B is being
tested at Cowell Student Health Center for people who
are at "high risk" for catching the virus.
Homosexual males, users of injected drugs and lab
technicians who work with blood samples appear to be
particularly susceptible to hepatitis B. The Center for
Disease Control in Atlanta has recommended the vac
cine for people who fall into these categories, according
to Dr. James McClenahan, director of Cowell.
Cowell tests the blood of people in the high risk
categories to determine if they have had hepatitis B. If
the results are negative, meaning they have not been
previously exposed, then the patient is given the option
of receiving the vaccine at cost price.
Asked if there were possible side effects from the
vaccine, McClenahan said, "The dangers, we think, are

low."
However, "There is an issue with the vaccine itself,"
he added.
Acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), a re
cently widely publicized disease that was first found in
homosexual males, is suspected to be transmitted
through blood transfusions. Questions have arisen as to
the possibility that this vaccine — made from human
serum — has transmitted or generated the disease.
McClenahan said since extensive studies have not yet
been conducted on either the vaccine or AIDS, Cowell is
not making "blanket recommendations" on whether
the vaccine should be administered.
He predicted the vaccine will turn out to be safe.
Only a few cases of hepatitis B are reported to Cowell
each year, according to M< Clenahan The disease differs
from hepatitis A in severity and its tendency to become a
chronic condition.
