## Howard exchange offers new location, perspective 
### LISA LYNCH Staff writer 
Many students here take it as
a given that they will spend a
year overseas at one of the
University's 12 foreign cam
puses. Vet the University offers
only one domestic exchange
program.
A semester or a year at How
ard University, a predomi
nantly black university located
in the heart of Washington
D C., is the only Stanford
sponsored option offered.
Through the exchange, a
student pays Stanford tuition
and exchanges his place at the
University with a Howard stu
dent paying Howard tuition.

The student pays room and
board fees to the exchange
school. Undergraduate Spe
cials Director Laura Selznick,
who works with Howard-
Stanford exchange students
here, said the exchange works
in many ways like the overseas
program. "These students are
still matriculated at Stanford,
and the exchange is part of
tneir Stanford education," she
said.
It is important that the same
number of students from each
school participate in the ex
change. "In this way we aren't
exchanging any money, only
bodies," Selznick said.
Usually fewer Stanford stu
dents are interested in the ex

change program than Howard
students. "Howard has a highly
developed domestic exchange
program, and students there
are very aware of and in
terested in the opportunity to
try out other schools. But at
Stanford, the program doesn't
get much publicity," Selznick
said.
Although students here
must apply for eligibility to the
program, Selznick maintained
that they have not had to turn
any students away. "Since
there is a greater demand from
Howard than there is a supply
of Stanford students, basically
anyone who has been in
terested has gone," she said.
The University had an ex-

change program in the early
'70's with Morehouse-
Spellman College in Atlanta,
which ran into many problems.
Stanford students were not
prepared for the social atmos
phere there, because Stanford
is far more progressive so
cially. After the Morehouse-
Spellman exchange, we con
sidered working with How
ard," she said. After a student
named Kim Loo stopped out of
the University and attended
Howard for a semester, a pro
posal was submitted to start an
official exchange. The program
began four years ago, and two
to five student participate each
year.
Both sophomores and

juniors have participated in the
exchange, but Selznick most
highly recommends the ex
change for students in their
junior year. "We like when
students are just beginning
their major, even though in the
past we have allowed sopho
mores into the program," she
said, lunior Jamie Terry, a stu
dent here who spent fall
semester at Howard, is a pre
med majoring in sociology.
Sophomore Tony Cappelli, a
Howard student who wili be
here during winter quarter and
spring quarter, has already de
clared a chemistry major.
Cappeli said, "I was not en
tirely satisfied with Howard; I
had problems with the social

and academic atmosphere" he
said. "Here theatmosphere is a
little more carefree, and the
people seem just a little bit
nicer." Capelli said that the
Stanford campus also appealed
to him. "There's no compari
son, as far as the school set
ting," he said. "Howard is right
in the middle of the city and
has a compact campus. Stan
ford is spread out, and has
more of a country atmosphere.
Some people may like city life
better, but I like the country."
Capelli said the only drawback
to the program was the lack of
research program in his major,
chemistry. Hefound hedid not
have the experience. "They
want people with more than

one and-a-hali years of train
ing," he said.
Cjpelli is taking calculus,
physics, English and tennis. He
said the courses were basically
the same as their Howard
counterparts, though physics
seemed to be more difficult.
Cappelli said he hoped that
in the future white students
would try the exchange pro
gram as well. I think whites
should participate — to see
what it's like, he said. "We
have a few v\hite students at
Howard on exchange from
Reed College and that pro
gram has worked out well." he
said.
Terry agreed. "The program
is by no means appealing to
black students only. While I
was at Howard there are white
students there on exchange,
and they began to appreciate
issues and problems that they
thought they already under
stood."

During her semester at
Howard, Terry said she had a
chance both to experience a
dynamically different envi
ronment to reflect on the ad
vantages and disadvantages of
Stanford. "I went to Howard
because I wanted a change of
academic scenery," Terrv said.

"I wanted to be in a university
that was in the city, and not
isolated from the community.
San Francisco seems very far
away from Stanford. I also was
getting a little tired of what I
think is an extremely high
teacher-student ratio." Terry
said even though her experi
ence at Howard was positive,
she learned to appreciate some
of the conveniences here.
"This school is basically
self-sufficient; it has thingslike
a post office, a bank, a store. I
missed that aspect of the envi
ronment," she said.
A sorority named Alpha
Kappa Alpha, of which Terry is
a member, was founded at
Howard. Terry said this influ
enced her decision to go. "I
wanted to see how my sorority
functioned in an all-black envi-

ronment and to see the origins
of the sorority."
Terry said her courses at
Howard were smaller and the
atmosphere was less competi
tive. "Here, the emphasis is
'How much better can I do than
the other person?'" There,
students are more concerned
with how much they can learn,
and professors are concerned

with helping the students mas
ter basic concepts. I found the
faculty gave me a lot of sup
port," she said.
Terry said the Stanford stu
dent wound up spending al
most four quarters' worth of

time at school. "Basically, you
wind up spending moretime in
school than anyone else; a
semester and two quarters.
I've been in school since Au
gust, and I have classes until
June."

with helping the students mas

faculty gave me a lot of sup

Terry said the Stanford stu
dent wound up spending al
most four quarters' worth of

time at school. "Basically, you
wind up spending moretime in
school than anyone else; a
semester and two quarters.
I've been in school since Au
gust, and I have classes until
June."
Many students here take it as
a given that they will spend a
year overseas at one of the
University's 12 foreign cam
puses. Vet the University offers
only one domestic exchange
program.
A semester or a year at How
ard University, a predomi
nantly black university located
in the heart of Washington
D C., is the only Stanford
sponsored option offered.
Through the exchange, a
student pays Stanford tuition
and exchanges his place at the
University with a Howard stu
dent paying Howard tuition.

The student pays room and
board fees to the exchange
school. Undergraduate Spe
cials Director Laura Selznick,
who works with Howard-
Stanford exchange students
here, said the exchange works
in many ways like the overseas
program. "These students are
still matriculated at Stanford,
and the exchange is part of
tneir Stanford education," she
said.
It is important that the same
number of students from each
school participate in the ex
change. "In this way we aren't
exchanging any money, only
bodies," Selznick said.
Usually fewer Stanford stu
dents are interested in the ex

change program than Howard
students. "Howard has a highly
developed domestic exchange
program, and students there
are very aware of and in
terested in the opportunity to
try out other schools. But at
Stanford, the program doesn't
get much publicity," Selznick
said.
Although students here
must apply for eligibility to the
program, Selznick maintained
that they have not had to turn
any students away. "Since
there is a greater demand from
Howard than there is a supply
of Stanford students, basically
anyone who has been in
terested has gone," she said.
The University had an ex-

change program in the early
'70's with Morehouse-
Spellman College in Atlanta,
which ran into many problems.
Stanford students were not
prepared for the social atmos
phere there, because Stanford
is far more progressive so
cially. After the Morehouse-
Spellman exchange, we con
sidered working with How
ard," she said. After a student
named Kim Loo stopped out of
the University and attended
Howard for a semester, a pro
posal was submitted to start an
official exchange. The program
began four years ago, and two
to five student participate each
year.
Both sophomores and

juniors have participated in the
exchange, but Selznick most
highly recommends the ex
change for students in their
junior year. "We like when
students are just beginning
their major, even though in the
past we have allowed sopho
mores into the program," she
said, lunior Jamie Terry, a stu
dent here who spent fall
semester at Howard, is a pre
med majoring in sociology.
Sophomore Tony Cappelli, a
Howard student who wili be
here during winter quarter and
spring quarter, has already de
clared a chemistry major.
Cappeli said, "I was not en
tirely satisfied with Howard; I
had problems with the social

and academic atmosphere" he
said. "Here theatmosphere is a
little more carefree, and the
people seem just a little bit
nicer." Capelli said that the
Stanford campus also appealed
to him. "There's no compari
son, as far as the school set
ting," he said. "Howard is right
in the middle of the city and
has a compact campus. Stan
ford is spread out, and has
more of a country atmosphere.
Some people may like city life
better, but I like the country."
Capelli said the only drawback
to the program was the lack of
research program in his major,
chemistry. Hefound hedid not
have the experience. "They
want people with more than

one and-a-hali years of train
ing," he said.
Cjpelli is taking calculus,
physics, English and tennis. He
said the courses were basically
the same as their Howard
counterparts, though physics
seemed to be more difficult.
Cappelli said he hoped that
in the future white students
would try the exchange pro
gram as well. I think whites
should participate — to see
what it's like, he said. "We
have a few v\hite students at
Howard on exchange from
Reed College and that pro
gram has worked out well." he
said.
Terry agreed. "The program
is by no means appealing to
black students only. While I
was at Howard there are white
students there on exchange,
and they began to appreciate
issues and problems that they
thought they already under
stood."

During her semester at
Howard, Terry said she had a
chance both to experience a
dynamically different envi
ronment to reflect on the ad
vantages and disadvantages of
Stanford. "I went to Howard
because I wanted a change of
academic scenery," Terrv said.

"I wanted to be in a university
that was in the city, and not
isolated from the community.
San Francisco seems very far
away from Stanford. I also was
getting a little tired of what I
think is an extremely high
teacher-student ratio." Terry
said even though her experi
ence at Howard was positive,
she learned to appreciate some
of the conveniences here.
"This school is basically
self-sufficient; it has thingslike
a post office, a bank, a store. I
missed that aspect of the envi
ronment," she said.
A sorority named Alpha
Kappa Alpha, of which Terry is
a member, was founded at
Howard. Terry said this influ
enced her decision to go. "I
wanted to see how my sorority
functioned in an all-black envi-

ronment and to see the origins
of the sorority."
Terry said her courses at
Howard were smaller and the
atmosphere was less competi
tive. "Here, the emphasis is
'How much better can I do than
the other person?'" There,
students are more concerned
with how much they can learn,
and professors are concerned
