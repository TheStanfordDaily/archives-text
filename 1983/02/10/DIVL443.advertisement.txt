This supplementary issue is designed to get students thinking about
career options available to them and to shed some light on the recruiting
process. Most want a job that will utilize both their talents and education. It
is important to know what companies look for and how to find hidden
opportunities. The Career Planning and Placement Center (CPPC) has re- j
sources and counselors to help all students set up and achieve their career I
goals.
