# Soviet denied podium
## 
### KEVIN GROSS Staff writer 
For the second time in a year, a
member of the Soviet consul was de
nied permission to deliver a sched
uled speech here.
Consul Gennaudy Gurkin's
speech was delivered in absentia at
Bechtel International Center by
Father Joe Frazier, an Episcopalian
minister, who had anticipated the
State Department action and re
quested a copy of the prepared text.
Gurkin was also denied permis
sion to travel to Stanford last year. At
that time, the speech was resched
uled to be delivered at the College of
San Mateo, following the State De
partment's denial of Gurkin's re
quest to travel outside a 25-mile
radius of the embassy, according to
Frazier, the president of the Stanford
Centerbury Association.
Laura Kennedy, a former State De
partment official who was stationed
in Moscow, said that the State De
partment's actions were probably in
response to similar actions by the
Soviet government. "It's done for
strictly reciprocal reasons, to give the
diplomats some sort of leverage,"
she said.
"I'm not aware of any situation in
the past 30 years where any American
diplomat has been granted permis
sion to speak on U.S. views, in any
public forum (in the Soviet Union)."
Kennedy added that the Soviet re
strictions apply to all diplomats, even
those representing Eastern European
nations.
Under federal law, any foreign di
plomat who wishes to travel into a
"closed area" cht-Â«o area more than
25 miles from his embassy or
consulate office must obtain permis
sion from the U.S. State Department.
In addition to being more than 25
miles from San Francisco, Stanford
might also be considered a closed
area due to its proximity to Moffet
Naval Air Station in Sunnyvale.
The subject of Gurkin's speech
was the Soviet position on the nu
clear arms race.
Gurkin was critical of President
Reagan's contention that the Soviets
have a superior position in the nu
clear arms race.
Fie advocated the current Soviet
proposal for a verifiable freeze of
U.S. and USSR nuclear weapons at
current levels.
