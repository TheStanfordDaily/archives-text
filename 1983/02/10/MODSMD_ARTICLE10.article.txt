# Students observe high fashion in Florence
## 
### PAUL ORTEGA 
Florence,ltaly — The center of
the Renaissance, Florence con
tinues its artistic tradition by
presenting the internationally
famous series of fashion exhi
bitions, the Pittis. This past
january saw the presentation
of the 23rd Pitti Uomo, the
premiere showcase of what Ita
lian high fashion has to offer
the male world for the fall/
winter season of 1983- 84.
Echos of the past mixed with
images of the future as the
cream of Italian designers
gathered for four days in this
classic city of Dante,
Michiavelli, da Vinci and
Michelangelo, which is also
"home" to some 60 Stanford
students attending the over
seas program in Florence. The
big names like Armani, Fer
ragamo, Valentino and Er
menegildo Zegna were there
as well as dozens of the
lesser-known but equally
deserving designers.
So what can we expect for
the male fashion in the coming
year? First off expect subdued
colors: grays of all sorts;
brown with touches of red;
dark reds; tan; navy; mauve
and dark purple tones; combi
nations of neutral and brights.
And the "look"? The trend is
toward a heavy and layered
"look", which makes sense in
winter. We'll see large
amounts of material in jackets,
sweaters, pants and such. Ex
pect large, puffy sleeves on
jackets, large necks on sweat
ers and jackets, hoods arid fins
on the back of jackets, borders
on sportcoats. Marked shoul
ders on a square look with
large armholes has returned to
the traditional suits and coats.
Expect also lots of "extras"
such as belts and metal clasps
on pant cuffs and at the hips of
jackets as well as zippers on
pant pockets, jacket sleeves

and such.
In jackets and sweaters as
well as pants expect lots of fab
ric combinations suqh as cor
duroy on leather jackets,
leather patches on bulky wool
sweaters etc.
While most of the big names
can be found in large depart
ment stores in the City such as
Saks or Macys the promoters of
Italian fashion are attempting
to bring to the attention of the
American buyers the lesser
known lines. One such de
signer, Regina Schrecker of
Florence, created quite a sen
sation among the Americans at
the ever-spectacular Fashion
Show is her '83-'B4 line. She
describes it as a cross between
country gentleman and parti
san of the Spanish Civil War
but there's also an obvious in
fluence from tne pioneering
era of the American North
west; a heavy use of leathers,
reptile, furs, wools, metals and
camouflage topped with a mili
tary beret. Anxious to follow
up on her success among the
Americans she's now planning
to show her line in San Fran
cisco sometime in late Febru
ary or March.
After a hard day of examining
racks and racks of clothes
where does one go? Many a
Stanford student here in Flor
ence has asked the same ques
tion when in search of a study
break and has discovered the
delights of what Florence has
to offer. In terms of where to
go for nourishment the city is a
gem, offering some of the best
of Italian cuisine from 112 ount
less family-run restaurants. Fol
low this up with a cup of the
infamous Italian gelato (that
puts Bud's and Swenson's to
shame), bars and cafes, night
clubs and discotheque and of
course the "passeggiata", the
social sport of watching fash
ionable Italians stroll by.
