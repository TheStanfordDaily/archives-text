## The 						Stanford Daily Increase research and aid 
### 
President Reagan presented the 1984 budget
last week which contained substantial cuts in
social programs, large increases in defense
spending and a record deficit. Democrats and
Republicans alike are gearing up for a long con
gressional battle over the proposal.
Reagan's request for substantial reductions in
financial aid funding is of major concern to col
lege students here and across the nation. The
president has proposed real cuts in education of
approximately $700 million, including dramatic
cuts in Guaranteed Student Loans and the com
plete abolishment of both Supplementary Edu
cational Opportunity Grants and National Di
rect Student Loans.
At the same time, Reagan has proposed fairly
large increases in research funding. National
Science Foundation grants, which make up
about 25 percent of research monies here, is
expected to increase by at least 18 percent.
Funding from the National Institute of Health
and the Department of Defense, which together
make up another 65 percent of research funds,
are expected to show moderate increases or at
least to remain the same.
We praise these proposed increases in re
search funding. It is encouraging to see that
Reagan has intelligently assessed universities'
crucial role in developing our nation's science
and technology and has placed his budget
priorities accordingly.
It is, however, ditficuit for us to understand
Reagan's eagerness to cut educational funding.
Millions of students rely upon those programs

which are set to be axed, and they would be
forced to cut short their education if these pro
posed reductions were to go into effect. The
brunt would be felt by middle-income students,
who would be priced out of a college education.
For universities, the ensuing congressional
battle is more than just a political game. It is a
matter of survival, as research and financial aid
funding are vital to maintaining high standards
of excellence in education.
Stanford stands in a much better position
than most. Our top-notch faculty and general
prestige have helped maintain the flow of
funding here despite Reagan's already deep
cuts. Other universities have not fared so well,
and many have been forced to cut programs and
faculty, hike tuition, and restrict financial aid.
We encourage the University community to
make its voice heard on this issue. Con
gressmen Ed. Zschau (D-Calif.) and Tom Lantos
(D-Calif.) both pledged strong support for Stan
ford interests during the 1982 election cam
paign. Let's hold them to their promise. As
Congress bargains and bickers over every as
pect of our nation's budget, we must make sure
that educational interests are not denied atten
tion.
The consequences of remaining silent were
api./ stated by Robert Freelen, vice-president
for public affairs and one of Stanford's strongest
lobbyists in the nation's capital. "If it passes as it
was proposed, the affects would be alarming."
Go get 'em Bob.
