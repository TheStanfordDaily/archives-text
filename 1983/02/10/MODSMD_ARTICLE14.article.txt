# Mural deserves respect

The defacement of the mural in Casa Zapata
entitled "A Reaction to Violence and Institu
tional Racism in the Media" on Jan. 28 was seen
as a "harmless prank" by its perpetrators, two
freshmen in Donner, but the vandalization of
any form of expression, be it a mural, as in this
case, a statue or a building is never "harmless."
The reaction of one Zapata resident, "For
Chicanos here it's like defacing a Picasso," ex
presses our opinion as well. Its artistic merits
aside, the work is a statement of opinion which
should be neither censored nor ridiculed.
What concerns us most is that this is the third
time the mural has been defaced. Although we
are unsure of the intent of the previous vandals,
we hope that students will refrain from defacing
something merely because they disagree with
the statement it makes or because they can

think of nothing better to do on a Friday night.
Claims that the mural itself is a racist repre
sentation of whites are disputed by Zapata resi
dents, who have said that the mural is a state
ment on the media exploitation of Latinos in
Latin America and the United States.
The mural, they say, represents three phases
in a Latina's life, and the middle face, which has
been mistaken for simply that of a white
woman, is instead a representation of the
media's portrayal of the ideal woman.
Although the defacement disturbs us, we see
some hope in the fact that the two freshmen
have spoken with the Zapata resident fellow
about their act and its consequences. Also, we
hope that some good will come out of this inci
dent, as students of all races seek to better un
derstand the divisions which separate them.
