# Stanford athletics born again
## 
### 
The Stanford board of trustees set
tled an age old dispute last night. The
question was, "Is the Stanford mas
cot a bird or a color?" The answer is
neither: the Stanford Cardinal is a
priest.
Speaking after the board of trus
tees meeting, President Donald
Kennedy remarked that he was
pleased with the selection of the new
Cardinal mascot since it reflects the
religious significance which athletic
competitions have assumed in this
country.
Kennedy referred to two com
ments made about the recent death
of Alabama's Bear Bryant as evidence
of the American tendency to deify
sports. The first comment was made
by Steadman Shealy, quarterback on
Alabama's 1979 national champion
ship football team. Shealy said, "The
Bear was a winner here on earth and I

am convinced now that he is a winner
with God." The other comment was
made by a long-time admirer of
Bryant. The admirer said, "There was
just always Bear, just like there was
always jesus."
Other trustees referred to the film
"Chariots of Fire" and to Big Game as
reasons for revising the Stanford
Cardinal mascot. After last year's Big
Game several Berkeley players cited
God as Berkeley's reason for win
ning; some Trustees believe now
that with the new Cardinal mascot,
God will be forced to favor Stanford
in future competitions.
Stanford Athletic Director Andy
Geiger has been meeting with offi
cials from Stanford's Divinity School
in an effort to redesign next year's
athletic uniforms with the new reli
gious motif. Geiger told the Daily,
"Obviously God hasn't hurt Notre

Dame's athletic programs any, and I
think that He can achieve the same
great results here, given the
chance." Ceiger also revealed plans
to show inspirational films of the
Pope's visit to Yankee Stadium to the
football team as part of Stanford's
born-again athletic program.
One trustee has already suggested
a new motto for Stanford athletics; it
reads, "Cod is first, sports are sec
ond, and education is nice, too."
So far football coach Paul Wiggin
foresees only one problem with
Stanford's new religion/sports pro
gram (now called "Theoletics"): he
refuses to play Arizona State's Sun
Devils unless they repent.
