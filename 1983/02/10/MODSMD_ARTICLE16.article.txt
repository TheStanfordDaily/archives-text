## Army volunteer system is more discriminatory 
### 
Both your recent editorial (Daily,
Feb. 4) and the open letter to the
Director of the Selective Service re
peat a rommonly made mistake in
the discussion of the draft and draft
registration. In both statements, an
assertion was made that various as
pects of the process discriminate
against low-income male college
students. Unfortunately, you have
failed to see that the current volun
teer system contains a much greater
form of discrimination. The greater
discrimination is that of the middle
and upper classes towards the lower
classes within the economic system.
According to the San Francisco
Chronicle, "One in three Army re
cruits in fiscal 1981 was black, even
though they comprise only 14 per
cent of the population aged 18to 23."
This is no accident. One major impli
cation of the draft is that the com
paratively well-off college students
will not be able to buy their way out

of national service.
I wonder if many people ever
stopped to wonder why such a large
portion of the draft objectors have
traditionally been upper and middle
class white males. While the objec
tors argue over their freedom to go
to school, receive financial aid, etc.,
many of the poor people in this
country are busy trying to find work
and food. The predominance of poor
males in the services is a direct reflec
tion of the lack of alternative job op
portunities for them. I would argue
that a broader perspective on the
problem should be taken and that
there are bigger battles to be fought.

In their letter {Daily, Feb. 3), the
residents of 353 Campus Drive ex

pressed disappointment that faculty
members invited to the house for
Faculty Day were not able to attend.
Overall, the participation by faculty
was impressive. We extended 265 in
vitations and 125 faculty members
had dinner with students in various
campus residences.
Faculty Day highlights an activity
we hope is going on all the time —
visits by faculty members to resi
dences. The point of a single Faculty
Day is to foster additional faculty
student interaction. Faculty Days,
and other occasions when faculty
members are hosted by students in
their homes, provide informal op
portunities for faculty to share their
academic and avocational interests
with students and for students to get
to know their teachers outside the
classroom.
The Office of Residential Educa
tion coordinated Faculty Day. Invita
tions were extended on behalf of the

residence staff to faculty members
the houses said they would like to
host. The RSVPs were taken by the
Res Ed office and the information
passed on to the RAs and Resident
Fellows.
It was up to the individual house to
confirm arrival times and other ar
rangements. In many houses all
worked smoothly. Expected faculty
guests arrived on time and were
greeted by students at house recep
tions or at small gatherings in stu
dent's rooms. Many houses had sign
ups so students who wanted to have
dinner with particular faculty guests
could do so. This is the second year
of Faculty Day, and I'm sure some
details still need to be worked out.
I urge the residents of 353 Campus
Drive to extend invitations to their
favorite professors and to provide a
warm welcome for the faculty guests.
