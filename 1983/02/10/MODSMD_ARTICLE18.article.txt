## Revolution is the only solution 
### 
On a few occasions, the Daily has
published items on South Africa
which show the interest taken on
this issue of vital importance to Afri
cans and peace-loving people all over
the world. However, the quality, ac
curacy and analytical rigor of most of
the material published is very ques
tionable.
This article attempts to rectify the
bigotry and ignorance characterizing
most of these contributions which
reflect the ideological stance of many
so called "Africanists" at Hoover In
stitution and other departments of
Stanford. Such clarification is neces
sary because a sizable American au
dience might be susceptible to such
argumentations.
First, historically U.S. and African
relations have been of antagonistic
nature since the days of slavery in
which millions of Africans were ab
ducted and sold as slaves in this
country.
Second, more than a hundred
years after the abolition of slavery,
the great majority of the African de
scendants continue to remain under
subjugation, virtually strangers in a
country they continue to help build
with blood, sweat and tears. Africans
are under no illusion that the U.S.
government will apply fairer norms
to Africans on the continent while
the system continues to oppress and
disregard the majority of black
Americans.
Third, in a fundamental sense,
South Africa and the United States
have common unjust beginnings.
The pioneers of this country set out
and largely succeeded in physically
exterminating the native peoples.
The violent and barbaric acts of the
Dutch Boers succeeded in eliminat
ing the Khoisan people of the Cape.
Thanks to the heroic resistance of the
other African peoples, we can still
speak of a South Africa in which the
original and rightful owners of the
land are still the majority.
Fourth, and most important at the
present, U.S. multinationals are par
ticipating in the exploitation of the
natural resources of South Africa.
The system of labor control in South
Africa assures high profits for West
ern companies operating in the re
gion. South Africa has huge reserves
of rare strategic minerals in which
the U.S. is keenly interested. This is

the confrontation between the Afri
cans and the oppressive white sup
remacist state. The United States is a
"neutral broker" but a collaborator
with a fascist regime.
Why is a revolution inevitable in
South Africa?
The imperialist conquest of Africa
did not go unchallenged by the Afri
can people. All over the continent a
bloody resistance to the European
invaders was put up by the local
population. The current struggles
are but a continuation of a long
heroic history of protracted struggle
against foreign subjugation. Every
tactic of fighting for freedom has
been used in South Africa. The Afri
can National Congress (ANC) was
formed in 1912 and used peaceful
means and negotiation to attain polit
ical rights. The peaceful attempts for
political change did not bring politi
cal rights for Africans. Indeed Afri
cans had more civil rights in the 1920s
and 1930s than at the present. After
the end of the Second World War,
the Nationalist Party which was a
staunch supporter of Hitler took over
power and systematically deprived
Africans of all civil rights. The State
adopted racism as the official and
guiding ideology. They introduced
the notorious passes which dictate
where and when Africans can go and
not go. They created Bantustans
which are concentration camps in
which cheap labor can be drawn
when needed. They deprived Afri
cans of citizenship in their own coun
try, on their own continent.
Peacful demonstrations by Afri
cans opposing Pass Laws was met by
indiscriminate shootings by the
police in Sharpville. African leaders
opposing the regime were either
murdered or put in jail. The brutality
of the State has been increasing over
time, as witnessed by the massacre
of Soweto students in 1976. How can
one expect the 20 million Africans to
continue to accept the terror and
humiliation they are being subjected
to by four million whites?
The current constitutional change
in South Africa, which has been
applauded by the U.S. government,
incorporates Mulattoes and Indians
as junior partners of the State and
totally excludes Africans even as
puppets to the regime. The African
masses, after trying all peaceful

methods, have decided to wage a
protracted armed struggle. The suc
cess of Mozambique, Angola,
Guinea Bissau, and Zimbabwe have
inspired the black people in south
Africa. The ANC has succeeded in
penetrating and bombing the highly
protected, synfuel plant of Sasol and
the nuclear reactor. Both the Pan Af
ricanist Congress and the ANC have a
network of political and military
cells operating inside South Africa.
Internationally, South Africa is iso
lated and condemned by all govern
ments except the United States. The
Reagan policy of "constructive en
gagement" has encouraged South
Africa to increase terrorist invasions
of bordering independent African
states. The campaign has included
South African occupation of south
ern Angola, invasion of Mozam
bique, terror bombing in Zimbabwe,
and the raiding and murdering of
South African refugees in Lesotho.
The American government is fond
of blaming the Russians and Com
munists whenever oppressed people
take arms to fight for their legitimate
rights. It partly reflects the racist at
titude that Africans will not fight
against oppression unless Russians
and Communists tell them to do so.
Needless to say, Africans have ap
preciated the moral and
support given by the Soviet Union,
Cuba, China, and other Socialist
countries but the struggle for free
dom and dignity, which started even
before the October Revolution, will
continue regardless of whether the
Soviet Union supports it.
Non-violence is a good wish that
we, as peace loving peole, can only
but highly regard. But the modalities
of the liberation struggles are rarely
dictated by good wishes, but by the
circumstances. The intransigence
and mercilessness of the oppressors
are what makes the use of violence a
matter of legitimate self-defense for
the oppressed.
We do wish things could always be
resolved non-violently, but history
teaches us this sad lesson that, "Lib
eration is never a concession by the
oppressor but always a conquest by
the oppressed."
