# Grad students: housing unfair
## 
### FELICIA LEE Staff writer 
A group of graduate students here
are launching a formal protest
against what they say are unfair room
rates for graduate housing.
According to University policy,
graduate students and under
graduates pay similar room rates. As
a result, graduate students share the
cost of the new undergraduate hous
ing complex, Governor's Corner.
Room rates for 1983-84 will in
crease an average of 14.5 percent for
both graduate students and under
graduates, according to Ed Scoles,
director of housing and food ser
vices.
Several graduate students said
they agree with the University's un
ified housing policy in theory. But
they said the University has failed to
adequately support the housing
needs of graduate students living on
campus.
ASSU Senator Joseph Hughes, a
member of the Graduate FHousing
Advisory Committee, said graduate
students are "concerned not so
much with the payment but with the
lack of graduate housing."
Graduate student John Siegel es
timated that 1000 graduate students
are currently on the waiting list for
campus housing.
Yearly rent for Escondido Village
generated about $1 million beyond

the cost of maintenance, according
to graduate student Eric Pv>arson, a
member of the University's task
group on housing rates.
The University defended its posi
tion on the issue. Roger Whitnev, as
sistant dean of residential education,
said that the construction of new un
dergraduate housing actually opens
more spaces for graduate students
on campus.
Because abut 800 undergraduates
will be living in Governor's Corner,
about 350 graduate students will be
able to live in Manzanita Park, for
merly an undergraduate residence.
Undergraduates will continue to live
in Manzanita as well.
In addition, Whitney said, 54 addi
tional spaces in Mirrielees will be re
served for graduate students, and a
plan is being drawn up to allow
graduate students to live along with
undergraduates in the six co-ops
here.
Pearson said he was pleased with
the University's move to allow
graduate students to live in Man
zanita, saying that it was the "only
significant spot" of change on the
part of the University.
Siegel also said he was pleased by
the move. He added that he liked the
idea of putting graduates and under
graduates together.
Some graduate students, how

ever, said that the differences in
interests and lifestyles between
graduate and undergraduate stu
dents are what make the University's
unified housing policy impractical.
Hughes said that though many
graduate students would live off
campus if it were affordable, the high
cost of housing in this area, as well as
the fact that the departmental
stipends paid to graduate students
often do not cover the high cost of
living off campus, make the issup of
on-campus housing an important
one. Other students pointed out that
the fact that many graduate students
have families adds to the importance
of having affordable graduate hous

ing.
Another major difference between
the housing systems for graduates
and undergrads is that graduate resi
dences do not have RAs or elaborate
residential education programs, so
certain graduate residences are actu
ally less expensive than under
graduate residences, Scoles said.
The board rate for Crothers Hall is
currently $1427, while the basic rate
for undergraduate residences is now
$1510.
No immediate plans are being
made for the construction of new
graduate student housing. Accord
ing to Whitney, a committee for new
graduate student housing will soon
submit a leport outlining the number
and type of housing units wanted.
No new construction will be consid
ered, however, until 1985 or 1986.
