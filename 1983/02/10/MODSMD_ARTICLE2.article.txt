# Grad students: housing unfair
## 
### FELICIA LEE Staff writer 
A group of graduate students here
are launching a formal protest
against what they say are unfair room
rates for graduate housing.
According to University policy,
graduate students and under
graduates pay similar room rates. As
a result, graduate students share the
cost of the new undergraduate hous
ing complex, Governor's Corner.
Room rates for 1983-84 will in
crease an average of 14.5 percent for
both graduate students and under
graduates, according to Ed Scoles,
director of housing and food ser
vices.
Several graduate students said
they agree with the University's un
ified housing policy in theory. But
they said the University has failed to
adequately support the housing
needs of graduate students living on
campus.
ASSU Senator Joseph Hughes, a
member of the Graduate FHousing
Advisory Committee, said graduate
students are "concerned not so
much with the payment but with the
lack of graduate housing."
Graduate student John Siegel es
timated that 1000 graduate students
are currently on the waiting list for
campus housing.
Yearly rent for Escondido Village
generated about $1 million beyond

the cost of maintenance, according
to graduate student Eric Pv>arson, a
member of the University's task
group on housing rates.
The University defended its posi
tion on the issue. Roger Whitnev, as
sistant dean of residential education,
said that the construction of new un
dergraduate housing actually opens
more spaces for graduate students
on campus.
Because abut 800 undergraduates
will be living in Governor's Corner,
about 350 graduate students will be
able to live in Manzanita Park, for
merly an undergraduate residence.
Undergraduates will continue to live
in Manzanita as well.
In addition, Whitney said, 54 addi
tional spaces in Mirrielees will be re
served for graduate students, and a
plan is being drawn up to allow
graduate students to live along with
undergraduates in the six co-ops
here.
Pearson said he was pleased with
the University's move to allow
graduate students to live in Man
zanita, saying that it was the "only
significant spot" of change on the
part of the University.
Siegel also said he was pleased by
the move. He added that he liked the
idea of putting graduates and under
graduates together.

the residences in the Governor's Corner (below); but

graduate students, living in the trailers, do not relish
"subsidizing" the new facilities.
