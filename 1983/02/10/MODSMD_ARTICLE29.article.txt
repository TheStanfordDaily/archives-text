It may seem a little late for
"best" lists, but unless you live
in New York or Los Angeles
you can never count on seeing
all the movies you want to be
fore the end of the year. With
the opening of Frances, the last
of the Christmas releases
seems finally to have reached
the Bay Area. I regret not hav
ing seen a handful of promis
ing movies that have not yet
played here and show no im
mediate signs of doing so: The
Escape Artist, a directorial
debut for the gifted photo
grapher Caleb Deschanel;
Split Image, Ted Kotcheff's pic
ture about cults, with Michael
O'Keefe, Karen Allen and Peter
Fonda; and Leap into the Void,
by the amazing Italian director
Marco Bellochio. However, of
the 83 new films I did see, here
are the twelve I would select
for special honors:
1. Shoot the
Moon
The closest equivalent in
American movies to Eugene
O'Neill's great American family
play, Long Day's Journey into
Night. Alan Parker directed Bo
Goldman's script about the
split-up of a model family from
Marin County: a successful,
prize-winning author (Albert
Finney) leaves his wife (Diane
Keaton) and their four
daughters. The acting by Fin
ney, Keaton and Dana Hill as
their eldest daughter is fright
eningly authentic. The film is
such a wrenching experience
that it seems to have scared
people off; it sank at the box
office.
2. E.T. the
Extra-Terrestrial
Steven Spielberg's blissful
fantasy about the relationship
between a child and a visitor
from another planet. Spiel
berg's wizardry has a solid,
compassionate base in Melissa
Mathison's sweet-souled,
satisfying screenplay, and the
domestic comedy has the sort
of cozy wit he has been aiming
for (but not achieving) since
Jaws. A near-masterpiece of a
very unusual kind.

3. Diner
Barry Levinson's autobiog
raphical comedy-drama about
a quintet of young men kissing
the '50s goodbye may be the
most sensuous, complexly
funny rites of passage movie
ever made in this country.
Mickey Rourke, Daniel Stern,
Steve Guttenberg, Timothy
Daly, Kevin Bacon, Ellen Barkin
and others in smaller roles
bring the kind of verisimilitude
to their performances that we
normally associate with docu
mentaries.
4. Three
Brothers
A beautifully wrought agra
rian drama by Francesco Rosi,
in which three remarkably
different brothers — a judge
(Philippe Noiret), the super
visor of a correctional institute
for boys (Vittorio Mez
zogiorno), and a fervently
anti-management auto worker
(Michele Placido) — join their
old father (Charles Vanel), in
the village where they grew up,
to mourn their mother's death.
The film's theme is connection
— broken, recovered, lost.
Rosi is an elegant image-maker
with a superb architectural
sense; his compositions are
suffused with feeling.
5. Personal Best
Robert Towne, a gifted
screenwriter on his first time
out as a director, conceived
this higltiy unconventional film
about the coming of age of a
pentathlete entirely in terms of
body language: how the
characters move is far more
important that what they say —
more expressive and more
precise. His cast is a mixture of
professional actors (Mariel
Hemingway, Scott Glenn) and
professional athletes (Patrice
Donnelly, Kenny Moore), yet
they all act in the same low
key, naturalistic style. A small
gem.
6. Tootsie
Perhaps a great American
comedy. Dustin Hoffman gives
a remarkably clever perform

ance as Michael Dorsey, a "dif
ficult" actor who dresses as a
woman and lands a plum part
in a daytime soap. Sydney Pol
lack's movie, from a script writ
ten (mostly) by Larry Gelbart
and Murray Schisgal, cele
brates the human capacity for
growth. It's hard not to ap
preciate human beings when
you're watching a movie that
features jessica Lange, Bill
Murray, Charles Durning, Teri
Garr, George Gaynes, Dabney
Coleman and Sydney Pollack.
7. Come Back to
the Five and
Dime, Jimmy
Dean, Jimmy
Dean
A great director (Robert
Altman) and a trio of extra
ordinary actresses (Sandy De
nnis, Cher, Karen Black) trans
form a preposterously deriva
tive script by Ed Graczyk into
Tennessee Williams, O'Neill,
Chekhov. This tribute to the
power of actors was originally a
stage play, but the film version
has a unique, suspended qual
ity: the wall-size mirror behind
the counter of the five and
dime becomes a flashback de
vice as well, and the play be
comes a movie without ceasing
to be a play.

8. Smash Palace
Roger Donaldson wrote and
directed this deeply moving
picture from New Zealand,
which bears a resemblance to
Shoot the Moon but has its
own distinctive sensibility.
Bruno Lawrence and Anna
Jemison play a couple whose
marriage is bound to break up
because they are classically
different types: she, educated
in Europe, has no patience with
the life she must lead with him
in the New Zealand backwater.
When she leaves him and re
fuses him access to their child
(Greer Robson), he moves
from anger and pain to obses
sion to a particularly modern
brand of insanity.
9. Lonely Heart
This terrific Japanese film, by
Kon Ichikawa, has played
(briefly) in New York but not
here, so far; I was lucky
enough to catch it at the
Montreal Film Festival in Sep
tember. Two police detectives
collaborate on a murder case,
and their common loneliness
draws them together: one is
striving to raise his two kids
without their mother, who
walked out on him because he

failed to understand her lonel
iness; the other was in love
with one of the murder victims.
As the film goes on, and the
characters multiply, Ichikawa's
theme expands and deepens,
until you realize that everyone
on the screen is a lonely heart.
10. Diva
Jean-Jacques Beinix directed
this dazzling high-tech New
Wave thriller. The ingenious
two-pronged plot involves a
pair of tapes — the confession
of a murdered whore, implicat
ing a highly respected figure,
and an illegal recording of a
concert singer. It's a very light
entertainment, full of horn
mages to other movies (and
other forms of pop culture),
but a tour de force for Beinix.
11. The Border
Since Tony Richardson's film
came out early in the year (in
February) and faded quickly,
too few people have seen it.
Jack Nicholson, giving his best
full-length performance in
years, plays an El Paso border
patrolman — a decent man
stuck in a crummy job where
he has to contend with the cor
ruption of his colleagues and
the contempt of the poor Mex
icans he picks up for illegal en
try. Richardson lets us see the
border situation through this
man's eyes; the movie is a
compassionate chronicle of
hopeless lives.
12. My Favorite
Year
Peter O'Toole is, of course,
the best reason to see this
comedy about an Erroll Flynn
style movie actor working on a
TV comedy revue show in the
'50s; but he's not the only rea
son. The director, Richard Ben
jamin (making his debut),
shows a gift for working with
actors — almost everyone in
the large cast (and especially
Joseph Bologna, Lainie Kazan,
Bill Macy and Cameron Mitch
ell) gives a sharply honed, witty
performance. The script, by
Dennis Palumbo and Norman
Steinberg, has its sentimental
moments (which O'Toole sails
through), but overall it's a joy.

TV comedy revue show in the

shows a gift for working with
actors — almost everyone in

It may seem a little late for
"best" lists, but unless you live
in New York or Los Angeles
you can never count on seeing
all the movies you want to be
fore the end of the year. With
the opening of Frances, the last
of the Christmas releases
seems finally to have reached
the Bay Area. I regret not hav
ing seen a handful of promis
ing movies that have not yet
played here and show no im
mediate signs of doing so: The
Escape Artist, a directorial
debut for the gifted photo
grapher Caleb Deschanel;
Split Image, Ted Kotcheff's pic
ture about cults, with Michael
O'Keefe, Karen Allen and Peter
Fonda; and Leap into the Void,
by the amazing Italian director
Marco Bellochio. However, of
the 83 new films I did see, here
are the twelve I would select
for special honors:
1. Shoot the
Moon
The closest equivalent in
American movies to Eugene
O'Neill's great American family
play, Long Day's Journey into
Night. Alan Parker directed Bo
Goldman's script about the
split-up of a model family from
Marin County: a successful,
prize-winning author (Albert
Finney) leaves his wife (Diane
Keaton) and their four
daughters. The acting by Fin
ney, Keaton and Dana Hill as
their eldest daughter is fright
eningly authentic. The film is
such a wrenching experience
that it seems to have scared
people off; it sank at the box
office.
2. E.T. the
Extra-Terrestrial
Steven Spielberg's blissful
fantasy about the relationship
between a child and a visitor
from another planet. Spiel
berg's wizardry has a solid,
compassionate base in Melissa
Mathison's sweet-souled,
satisfying screenplay, and the
domestic comedy has the sort
of cozy wit he has been aiming
for (but not achieving) since
Jaws. A near-masterpiece of a
very unusual kind.

3. Diner
Barry Levinson's autobiog
raphical comedy-drama about
a quintet of young men kissing
the '50s goodbye may be the
most sensuous, complexly
funny rites of passage movie
ever made in this country.
Mickey Rourke, Daniel Stern,
Steve Guttenberg, Timothy
Daly, Kevin Bacon, Ellen Barkin
and others in smaller roles
bring the kind of verisimilitude
to their performances that we
normally associate with docu
mentaries.
4. Three
Brothers
A beautifully wrought agra
rian drama by Francesco Rosi,
in which three remarkably
different brothers — a judge
(Philippe Noiret), the super
visor of a correctional institute
for boys (Vittorio Mez
zogiorno), and a fervently
anti-management auto worker
(Michele Placido) — join their
old father (Charles Vanel), in
the village where they grew up,
to mourn their mother's death.
The film's theme is connection
— broken, recovered, lost.
Rosi is an elegant image-maker
with a superb architectural
sense; his compositions are
suffused with feeling.
5. Personal Best
Robert Towne, a gifted
screenwriter on his first time
out as a director, conceived
this higltiy unconventional film
about the coming of age of a
pentathlete entirely in terms of
body language: how the
characters move is far more
important that what they say —
more expressive and more
precise. His cast is a mixture of
professional actors (Mariel
Hemingway, Scott Glenn) and
professional athletes (Patrice
Donnelly, Kenny Moore), yet
they all act in the same low
key, naturalistic style. A small
gem.
6. Tootsie
Perhaps a great American
comedy. Dustin Hoffman gives
a remarkably clever perform

ance as Michael Dorsey, a "dif
ficult" actor who dresses as a
woman and lands a plum part
in a daytime soap. Sydney Pol
lack's movie, from a script writ
ten (mostly) by Larry Gelbart
and Murray Schisgal, cele
brates the human capacity for
growth. It's hard not to ap
preciate human beings when
you're watching a movie that
features jessica Lange, Bill
Murray, Charles Durning, Teri
Garr, George Gaynes, Dabney
Coleman and Sydney Pollack.
7. Come Back to
the Five and
Dime, Jimmy
Dean, Jimmy
Dean
A great director (Robert
Altman) and a trio of extra
ordinary actresses (Sandy De
nnis, Cher, Karen Black) trans
form a preposterously deriva
tive script by Ed Graczyk into
Tennessee Williams, O'Neill,
Chekhov. This tribute to the
power of actors was originally a
stage play, but the film version
has a unique, suspended qual
ity: the wall-size mirror behind
the counter of the five and
dime becomes a flashback de
vice as well, and the play be
comes a movie without ceasing
to be a play.

8. Smash Palace
Roger Donaldson wrote and
directed this deeply moving
picture from New Zealand,
which bears a resemblance to
Shoot the Moon but has its
own distinctive sensibility.
Bruno Lawrence and Anna
Jemison play a couple whose
marriage is bound to break up
because they are classically
different types: she, educated
in Europe, has no patience with
the life she must lead with him
in the New Zealand backwater.
When she leaves him and re
fuses him access to their child
(Greer Robson), he moves
from anger and pain to obses
sion to a particularly modern
brand of insanity.
9. Lonely Heart
This terrific Japanese film, by
Kon Ichikawa, has played
(briefly) in New York but not
here, so far; I was lucky
enough to catch it at the
Montreal Film Festival in Sep
tember. Two police detectives
collaborate on a murder case,
and their common loneliness
draws them together: one is
striving to raise his two kids
without their mother, who
walked out on him because he

failed to understand her lonel
iness; the other was in love
with one of the murder victims.
As the film goes on, and the
characters multiply, Ichikawa's
theme expands and deepens,
until you realize that everyone
on the screen is a lonely heart.
10. Diva
Jean-Jacques Beinix directed
this dazzling high-tech New
Wave thriller. The ingenious
two-pronged plot involves a
pair of tapes — the confession
of a murdered whore, implicat
ing a highly respected figure,
and an illegal recording of a
concert singer. It's a very light
entertainment, full of horn
mages to other movies (and
other forms of pop culture),
but a tour de force for Beinix.
11. The Border
Since Tony Richardson's film
came out early in the year (in
February) and faded quickly,
too few people have seen it.
Jack Nicholson, giving his best
full-length performance in
years, plays an El Paso border
patrolman — a decent man
stuck in a crummy job where
he has to contend with the cor
ruption of his colleagues and
the contempt of the poor Mex
icans he picks up for illegal en
try. Richardson lets us see the
border situation through this
man's eyes; the movie is a
compassionate chronicle of
hopeless lives.
12. My Favorite

patrolman — a decent man
stuck in a crummy job where
he has to contend with the cor
ruption of his colleagues and
the contempt of the poor Mex
icans he picks up for illegal en
try. Richardson lets us see the
border situation through this
man's eyes; the movie is a
compassionate chronicle of
hopeless lives.
12. My Favorite
Year
Peter O'Toole is, of course,
the best reason to see this
comedy about an Erroll Flynn
style movie actor working on a
TV comedy revue show in the
'50s; but he's not the only rea
son. The director, Richard Ben
jamin (making his debut),
shows a gift for working with
actors — almost everyone in
the large cast (and especially
Joseph Bologna, Lainie Kazan,
Bill Macy and Cameron Mitch
ell) gives a sharply honed, witty
performance. The script, by
Dennis Palumbo and Norman
Steinberg, has its sentimental
moments (which O'Toole sails
through), but overall it's a joy.
