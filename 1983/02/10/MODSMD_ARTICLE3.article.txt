# Troubled economy forces more students to seek aid
## 
### STEVE KAUFMAN Staff writer 
The national economic slowdown is finally
affwffng Stanford, "as-mow untjergnKkrate-s
are turning to the financial Aids Ofice to help
defray the high cost of education here.
According to Robert Huff, director of finan
cial aids, more than 70 percent of the under
graduate population is currently receiving
some form of support towards their college
costs.
"There is a greater need this year for finan
cial assistance than we've seen in the past,"
said Huff. "The state of the economy is causing
concern among many parents and students
with regards to meeting college costs."
Most of the student aid cutbacks have come
at the federal and state level. Traditional
sources of grant money left the Financial Aids
Office more than $250,000 short this year, forc
ing the office to seek $200,000 in additional
budget funding from the University.
These cuts came at a critical time. Besides
cuts in government aid, which about 40 per
cent of students here receive, the economic

slowdown has placed extra financial strain on
many parents. jjr
Huff said that parents in m;ma»ieriaKnosin.«
ttonsare among the hardest tiv thesieiw
down.
"We are seeing families earning $50,000-
70,000 per year demonstrating financial need,"
explained Huff. "As family sizes grow largei
and more children enter college, it become
very difficult for parents to meet the costs of a
university education." Financial aid includes
loans and work-study employment, as well as
grant money.
Huff blamed the state of the economy tot
many of the current problems, claiming that
many parents have come up short when trying
to liquidate assets or receive bonuses. "The
buyers' market just isn't there now, and many
parents are earning substantially less than they
had estimated on the financial aid forms "
He cited the increase in mid-year financial
aid package revisions as an indicator of eco
nomic difficulty.
"We've never seen such <1 large volume ot
student requests before," said Roberta

lohnson, assistant director for awarding and
advising. "It's really putting a strain on our
already small staff."
*"•"1" rrM<WA<i k >rr the heavy cutbacks
forms or student aid, Stanford received an in
crease of National Direct Student Loan monies

for the school year. " This is due to the very low
default rate by students on their repayment
schedule," explained lohnson. With some
schools having default rates as high as 25 per
cent, Stanford's i to 4 percent per year looks
good
Manv students also laced economic difficul
ty last .ummer when temporary jobs became

a scarce commodity. Many small businesses,
as well as larger firms, were not as able to hire
students on a short-term basis, leaving many
-~wWv«mpty pocket books at the start ot aut umt
quarter. Stanford currently expects a $700- ItXXi
contribution towards college costs from stu
dents summer earnings.
To fill this gap, the 112 inancial Aids Office is
allowing students to lake alternate jobs on
campus, or is helping met the need with some
form of student loan. No grant aid. however, is
awarded in place of the summer earnings
Despite the cutbacks in federal .irid -.fate aid
Huff does not envision any change in the Uni
versity's "aid-blind" admission policy. Cur
rently, students are admitted solelv on tin
basis ot merit, not financial ability. "We fee!
very strongly about our commitment to provid
ing an educational opportunity to qualified
applicants regardless of their financial status
said Huff.
As evidence for this, Huff said that financial
aid was one of the few University department"-
which was not required to cut its budget back
by 5 percent tor this year
