# Barry Manilow Drooling Society, Bay Area Chapter
## 
### DAVID SCHMELZER 
The facade around most teen
idols perversely seems to work
against their purposes. By not
letting us see any of them
selves except a cultivated,
well-rehearsed, "I'm a won
derful guy" posture, we not
only have no stake in their suc
cess, but feel as if we're being
treated with disdain. While
most people have played the
"Joe Cool" game as they kid
around with their friends,
when it becomes a serious mat
ter it loses its playfulness and
becomes odd and distancing.
In many ways Barry Manilow
seems almost a further ex
treme of the ways of Donny
Osmond or David Cassidy or
Rick Springfield. While he
doesn't play to the crowd quite
as shamelessly as they do (or
did), the game is still the same.
By most social norms, Manilow
can't be considered especially
handsome, yet from all his al
bums and publicity photos we
see a man gazing soulfully at
us, as if daring us not to drool.
This absolute invulnerability,
this complete unwillingness to
trust his audiences by showing
them something of himself,
continues in his concerts (or at
least in last Thursday's), where
even his cute, "revealing" pat
ter has a feel of well-packaged
insincerity to it. His press pack
gives a list of "not so vital statis
tics" such as that his "top two
heroes" are Raul Wollenberg
and John Kennedy and that his
"personal pet peeve" is
"people reading his magazines
or newspapers before he
does." Certainly these could
be seen as an attempt to show
some of himself to his public,
but, like his stage comments,
they are so laundered and slick
that we see not a man relaxing
and sharing his music with us,
but rather one "honoring" us
with this glimpse of his human
ity and wit, and moments like
kthis are where a touch of con

tempt can creep into one's
view of him, simply because
that seems to be his view of us.
Also included in the press park
was a roster of the songs he
would sing for the evening,
which effectively ruled out any
spontaneity on his p.trt.
That these trappings so di
minish him is a shame, because
Manilow is more than a Donny
Osmond or a David Cassidy.
While he hasn't revolutionized
the music world, he has added
to its craft, particularly in his
manner of bringinga Uroadway
feel to pop music. His crafted
emotionalism (clearly distinct
from "raw passion") can be
stirring in much the same way
as can a play's show-stopper.
His decision to record
"Memory," the memorable
number from Cats, was an un
surprising one, and he gave a
moving performance of it last
Thursday (admittedly a less dif
ficult task with that song than
with most others). It got his
Broadway best as ho brought
on stage a streetlamp a bench,
and a fire hydrant and re
minisced about "the old
neighborhood." His version of
the song is a very controlled,
understated one until his in
evitable big finish, and that
seems to be a good choice. His
crashing finishes strike me as a
bit forced, but his emotion
comes through in his quieter
moments, where, on Thurs
day, we saw him in a dim spot
at the piano, finally appearing
to take his music seriously.
He captured this same mood
with "The Old Songs." The
song hadn't particularly struck
me before, but he played with
very little accompaniment and
kept it soft, singing clearly but
hesitantly and pulling back
whenever the song threatened
to build, which all crafted a
touching effect.
It was much more difficult to
take him seriously during his
more upbeat numbers (one

hesitates to call them "rock
ing"), however. The sight of a
frail little guy in a red pullover
sweater dashing over to his
piano to play two or three
chords, then leaping back up
(with the sound of the piano
often mysteriously continu
ing), grabbing a microphone
and making suggestive move
ments while singing songs like
"I Wanna Do It With You," as
four back-up singers dressed
in purple pullover sweaters
and doing disco moves behind
him, struck me as a bit comic,
though unquestionably
energetic.
There were a few stand-out
moments, though. He made
"Copacabana" into a produc
tion number as stagehands
dressed in flamenco costumes
ran onto the revolving stage
with potted palm trees and he
did a rousing dance with his
two female backup singers At
another point he stopped the
concert for a bit to take a vote
on whether he should do one
of his old songs or a newer
one. The old one received the
biggest ovation, so he did a
nice, quiet version of
"Weekend In New England."
Then, upsetting the crowd, he
didn't do the new song. (Fven
that "spontaneous" moment

was scheduled on the roster in
the press pack. Had he done
the new one it would have
been "Some Kind of Friend.")
Probably the most vibrant
section, though, came in the
middle of "Can't Smile With
out You," when he stopped to
ask for a volunteer to come up
and finish the song with him.
About 2000 hands went up and
spotlights flew around the au
dience and he picked the
friend I'd gone to the show
with. After her understandable
initial surprise she was es
corted to the stage by a security
guard and met on the ramp by
Manilow, who really was very
sensitive toward her, smiling
and getting her name and
where she was from and
whether or not she knew the
words to the song. Then they
strolled across the stage and
sang the thing, ending with a
kiss and with his calling up a
security guard to present her
with an autographed "I Sang
With Barry Manilow" t-shirt as
an item of proof for her
friends. While the event was a
part of the "Manilow re
pertoire," it was the one time
during the show where we saw
him ad-lib, where we seemed
to be seeing something of who
he was, and that's why it trans

cended the rest. (My friend did
get the satisfaction of getting
interviewed by one newspaper
and spoken of by another. The
Chronicle hated Manilow, but
called her "sweet as daylight"
and the Peninsula Times-
Tribune called her "breath
less" and used a quote where
she said he wore a lot of
makeup. Score it one out of
two.)
He finished with "One
Voice," apparently a meaning
ful song for him (though it only
ranked number five on the
press pack's list of "favorite
songs that he's written"). It was
impressive in logistics alone, as
he was joined by a choir of
about 30 (do these people
travel with him?), and he did
use them beautifully.
It was a short show (no more
than an hour and 15 minutes
for the $20 ticket) and it wasn't
a rock concert by any means
(the age spectrum must have
ranged from seven to a consid
erable group of people in their
50s). But it was a Barry Manilow
production in the ways one
might expect: namely polish;
good-quality sound; emo
tional, if usually hollow,
music; and, perhaps, a linger
ing impression of condescen
tion on his part.



Man How can't be
considered espe
cially handsome, yet
from all his albums
and publicity photos
we see a man gazing
soulfully at us, as if
daring us not to
drool.
