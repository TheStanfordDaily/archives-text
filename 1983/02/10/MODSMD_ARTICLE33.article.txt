# 'The House on Sorority Row': pithy existentialism
## 
### KEVIN KELLY 
Far too many films made
in recent years have been
little more than overt at
tempts to use sen
sationalism and shock-value
to make a fast buck at the
box office (Gandhi and E. 7.
are particularly notorious
examples). At a time when
directorial artistry and
thematic significance have
become a thing of the past,
it is immensely relieving to
see that Hollywood is still
capable of occasionally
producing a film charac
terized by thought and intel
ligence. Such a film is The
House on Sorority Row.
Not since Eisenstein's
Potemkin have I seen such a
solid piece of film-making.
Like Eisenstein's master
piece, Sorority Row demon
strates that a prolonged (if
pointless) juxtaposition of
violently contrasting visual
images can be a more than
adequate substitute for a
plot. It is an undeniably
pithy film which establishes

its enticingly threadbare
plot in the opening min
utes, then allows the bulk of
the screen time to be filled
with an enduring and en
grossing denouncement of
the type fount! in Fassbin
der's best films.
The plot of Sor >rity Row is
deceptively simnle: seven
sorority sisters decide to
play a harmless prank on
their nagging housemother
— they plan to scare her wit
less with a 45 automatic
loaded with blanks. Cer
tainly the old "threaten
the-housemother-with-a-
gun" gag is a favorite of col
lege campuses across the
nation, but it takes on new
! life in this film. In a classi
: cally Hitchcockian twist, a
i real bullet somehow finds
its way into the gun and the
housemother is shot.
A film of lower caliber
would undoubtedly have
the girls call an ambulance
or at least check to see that
she is dead, but Sorority
Row rises above such banal

considerations. The girls,
dismayed that their prank
has gone awry but not wish
ing to get in trouble, quickly
decide to dump the body in
their sewage-laden swim
ming pool where no one
will find it. Unfortunately,
the girls are so absorbed in
discussing the laws of
physics and trying to deter
mine whether or not the
body will float that they fail
to notice that the old lady is
still breathing when they
put her in a sack and toss
her in the pool The re
mainder of the film is de
voted to the grisly murders
of the sorority sisters as a
result of their mistreatment
of their housemother.
Contrary to what one
might expect, there is al
most a complete absence of
sexual titillation in the film
Empty orgasmic rumblings
deliberately brought on by
the misleadingly erotic ad
campaign for the movie
feed a gnawing frustration

in the viewer's gut that aids
the stomach-churning ob
jective of the film.
The killer in this film in
spires as much sympathy as
any character in recent film
history since Jimmy Stewart
in Capra's It's a Wonderful
Life. He is a fascinating fig
ure who treads the fine line
between existentialism and
nihilism as he demonstrates
that life — and, of course,
death — can only be truly
expressed through action.
Well, it isn't my wish to
reveal the ending of the film
(all but one of the seven
girls die, and the killer is
stopped in a way that leaves
room for a sequel), but
there are a few marvelous
images in the film which I
feel obliged to applaud : The
way in which one girl's pure
white dress is symbolically
stained by a few drops of the
dead housemother's blood
cannot help but evoke
memories of Bergman's The

Seventh Seal even in the
minds of those who have
never seen the film.
The film also boasts sev
eral scenes of surrealistic
hallucinatory images that
blend reality and nightmare
in a manner reminiscent of
Fellini. One such scene
shows two of the sorority
girls lying dead in an open
grave. This scene is so
suggestive of Finnegan's
Wake that )oyce must have
had a substantial influence
on the director.
One image that I found
particularly effective comes
when the heroine finds the
decapitated head of her
best friend looking up at her
out of a toilet. This might
have come across as a cliche
if attempted by someone
like Scorcese, but somehow
becomes a profound poetic
statement in this director's
capable hands.
The film is a gem.
