### TIM GRIEVE Staff writer 
The ASSU has corrected an error it
made last year which denied the
Stanford Committee on Political
Education (SCOPE) approximately
$10,000.
The mistake kept SCOPE off tht>
winter quarter fee assessment. How
ever, SCOPE will now appear on the
spring quarter fee assessment and
receive its money then, according to
ASSU Financial Manager Robert
Brody.
Students ratified a tee assessment
for SCOPE in last spring's election,
but the ASSU elections commission
failed to have the vote certified by
the ASSU senate, a necessary step in
the fee assessment process. The
Council of Presidents therefore did
not notify the University to plan to
collect the money during registra
tion.
ASSU senator James McGrath said
earlier this quarter that the $10,(100
represented approximately all of
SCOPE'S budget. But Brody ex
plained that the error should not dis
rupt any of SCOPE'S activities since
groups applying for fee assessments
often do not receive them until
winter quarter anyway.
According to Brody, the ASSU is
taking steps to prevent a similar error
from happening in the future.
"We've discussed the (fee assess
ment) process and tried to put some
checks into our system," Brody said
However, Brody said the ASSU
"won't execute anybody" for the
error since the ASSU is unsure
where, or bv whom, the error
made.
