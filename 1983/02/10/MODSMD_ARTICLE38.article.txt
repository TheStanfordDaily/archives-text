# Company recruiter reveals hiring strategy
## 
### JASON COLE 
Except for a notice describ
ing the job openingand a' short
interview with a company rep
resentative, students don't get
much opportunity to discover
what qualifications businesses
look for when hiring.
Understanding the com
pany's perspective can be a
tremendous asset to students
seeking employment, accord
ing to Robert Mac Lean, head of
college recruiting for
Hewlett-Packard. Mac Lean
said that if students know what
the company needs, they can
more accurately assess what
they have to offer.
"We do a needs analysis to
determine who, how many and
what kind of person we are
going to hire. If a student could
go through a sort of marketa
bility analysis, he or she would
be much better able to sell

themselves to a company,"
Mac Lean said.
This self-analysis may be es
pecially helpful to students
who are applying now. With
high unemployment and hard
economic times, many com
panies are cutting back on hir
ing.
Mac Lean has noted the ef
fect of the present economic
troubles. "What we thought
would be a short-lived de
crease in hiring is now a real
ity," he said.
Hewlett-Packard has had to
cut back on hiring somewhat.
This year they have approxi
mately 1200 openings, accord
ing to Mac Lean.
Because of economics woes,
Hewlett-Packard will be unable
to hire as many liberal arts
majors or people without an
extensive technical back
ground. "We need someone

who can go to a big company,
find out what they need, and
find out if we can help them
out," Mac Lean said. "This per
son needs the technical back
ground to understand what
each company needs.
"In previous years we could
afford to hire a larger group of
management-oriented people.
But now that's just not possi
ble, at least not for a little
while."
Of the 1200 people that
Hewlett-Packard will hire this
year, between 700 and 800 will
be engineers, about 200 will be
students with extensive com
puter science backgrounds and
the rest will be comprised of
some MBAs with engineering,
physics or math backgrounds,
some MBAs with economics
background and a handful of
people with a BA or BS for
management positions, ac

cording to Mac Lean.
He stressed, however, that
the company is not excluding
humanities students from their
hiring lists.
"If we come across a classics
major who is also a computer
science whiz, for example, we
may be tempted to offer him a
job," he said.
Mac Lean, a former professor
of economics, does not want to
discourage anyone from
majoring in liberal arts, but
does caution their hopes of
getting a job at Hewlett-
Packard or other similar firms.
"If someone believes that it
is best for their life for them to
study Zen, then they should do
it. As a former professor I'm all
for it, but they've also got to
realize that we are looking for a
person with a somewhat
different background," Mac-
Lean said.

While Hewlett-Packard and
other similar companies are
looking for people who have
an extensive technical back
ground, they are also looking
for people who can learn,
Mac Lean said. "We don't ex
pect a new employee to know
everything about what we do,
but they must be able to learn
quickly. We can't take two or
three years to teach them ev
erything," he explained.
As for the actual interview
process, Mac Lean said that al
though there are some firms
that send professional inter
viewers, Hewlett-Packard has a
team of people from each de
partment perform the inter
views. Primarily they, as other
firms, are looking for people
who can do the work, who are
willing and able to learn and
who can function in a team at
mosphere.
