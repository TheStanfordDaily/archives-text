# Students hunt for jobs in technical market

### TIM GRIEVE Staff writer 
With the growing popularity
of math, engineering and
applied science careers, many
students find themselves won
dering if there is any chance for
a career with an undergraduate
degree in humanities.
Kathy Campbell, the di
rector of liberal arts for the
Career Planning and Place
ment Center (CPPC), is telling
humanities and social science
students not to worry. They
may have to work harder to
find it, but a good career is still
within the reach of students
with humanities degrees. The
key is to transfer skills learned
in humanities and the social

sciences to careers in the
applied sciences.
"Anything you major in here
can give you transferable skills.
You just have to be creative in
your ability to transfer your
skills," Campbell said. As an
example, she said, many com
puter firms are hiring English
and journalism majors to be
technical writers to make com
puter software understandable
to its users.
French Prof. Robert Cohn
agrees with Campbell that
humanities majors can still
find careers, even in science
related fields, because good
writers and speakers are always
in demand. "It's been said in
print by top executives that

they look for people who can
express themselves well,"
Cohn said.
But the availability of careers
isn't the only thing that con
cerns humanities majors; they
also worry about how much
money they will be earning if
they do find jobs after gradua
tion. According to Campbell,
starting salaries in the applied
sciences, math, and engineer
ing careers are generally
higher than those in careers
traditionally reserved for the
humanities student.
Campbell noted, however,
that in many cases salaries for
those working in humanities
related careers may meet and
exceed those in science and

math related careers after sev
eral years.
"Entry level salaries (for
non-humanities majors) are
pretty much higher. But I think
as they go along that they catch
each other. Maybe it just takes
them (humanities-related
salaries) a little longer,"
Campbell explained.
Although it may be more dif
ficult to find a career in
humanities, Cohn said he be
lieves there is an important
reason for studying the liberal
arts. "You have to live with
yourself for the rest of your
life, and you are likely to
change careers often. You
can't slight yourself by not
studying humanities," he said.
