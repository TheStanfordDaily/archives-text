## 
### TIM GRIEVE Staff writer 
Citing recent instances of
academic fraud at Harvard and other
universities, University Provost Al
bert Hastorf has released a
memorandum outlining procedures
to deal with accusations of miscon
duct against faculty members here.
Academic fraud is difficult to de
fine. However, examples include de
liberate distortion of research data,
falsification of research results and
plagarism in research publications,
Hastorf explained in the memo to the
deans of schools.
According to Vice Provost Gerald
Lieberman, who helped formulate
the new procedures, the guidelines
do not come as a result of any cases
of academic fraud here. Rather, the
guidelines were prompted by cases
of fraud at other schools which have
attracted national attention.
"There have been cases of falsify
ing research data — one at New York
medical school last month, and Har
vard had one — andthis has created a
sense of awareness here, but not be

cause of any imminent cases here.
It's more of a case of what we would
do if this did happen here," Lieber
man said.
"We wanted to be sure that if
something like this happened here,
that we would be ready. But to my

knowledge there have been no cases
of proven fraud here," he said.
Until now, University guidelines in
the area have provided procedures
for dealing with academic fraud
cases only atter the president had
brought formal charges against the
faculty member involved. The new
guidelines define procedures which
should be taken before the allega
tions go to the president to deter
mine if there are sufficient grounds
for a formal charge of misconduct.
The memo stressed the impor
tance of confidentiality in inquiries
into instances of misconduct. "It is
essential to protect the professional
reputation of the faculty member in
volved, as well as the interests of the
public and those who might be
harmed by the alleged fraud. Accord
ingly, the initial investigation must
be conducted as quickly as possible
and every effort must be made to
maintain confidentiality," Hastorf
wrote.
The guidelines state that anyone
suspecting misconduct should con


Gerald Lieberman
tact the dean of the school in which
the alleged fraud occurred. Hastort
will then begin an inquiry into the
allegations, contacting the faculty
member involved and consulting
with others on a confidential basis
The dean is to complete this inquiry
no later than four weeks after thr
allegations are brought to h,s dtten
tion
The results of investigation then go
to the provost, and the president will
decide if the accusations warr-ini
formal charges.
If the president decides lormal
charges are warranted, existing pro
cedures in the Statement on Facultv
Discipline take effect.
