# Graduates find novel careers

### SCOTT LELAND 
Despite the crunch of the
current recession, many recent
Stanford graduates said they
have found rewarding em
ployment— rangingfrom mak
ing computers think like hu
mans to making hundreds of
people smile while enjoying
company-sponsored picnics.
Making computers reason
like people has been the focus
of work by civil engineer Gary
Retelny, class of '81, who is
currently a second-year busi
ness student. Together with
two partners, his younger
brother Jose Retelny and Gary
Esserman, Retelny co-founded
Exemplary Software, a com
puter company which markets
"Rank Master," a software
program that allows computers
to make qualitative decisions
based on peoples' prefer
ences.
For example, the elder Re
telny said the program could
be used by an employer to de
cide on whom to hire. The de
fined criteria might include re
levant experience, education,
age and background. The pro
gram then leads the user
through a series of compari
sons between each of the can
didates and each criterion,
then extrapolates the weights
and rankings that are implicit in
the comparisons. The result is
a decision which optimizes the
assigned values and selects the
best candidate on the basis of
the employer's personal pref
erences.
Asked about his under
graduate career, Retelny said
that he looks back very favor
ably upon it and that he con
siders Stanford to offer "the
best all around package." He
also encouraged others to con
sider an engineering major. "If
you have a technical back
ground and come out of Stan
ford, you can pretty much
write your own ticket."
Not everyone agreed with
Retelny's assessment, how
ever. Karl Knapper, a jour
nalism major who graduated
last quarter, said he knows
several engineering graduates
who haven't been able to find
the job they wanted, and one
chemical engineer who Knap
per said is working at Payless in
order to make ends meet.
"A lot of people I know are
sort of shook up after gradua
tion," said Knapper. "Some
how you get the impression
that you'll be handed a job on a
silver platter when you get out,
but that's not always true. . . .
Stanford will open the door a
little more and it'll impress
some people, but mostly get
ting the job you want is a mat
ter of who you know and of
being in the right place at the
right time."

Throwing the "perfect
party" is the job of Mark Breier,
class of '81, who began a com

pany called Amazing Events
Unlimited with two other Stan
ford students while an under
graduate here. The company is
well known for its elaborate,
attention-getting events, in
cluding appearances by pro
tagonists dressed in gorilla
suits, feigned bicycle attacks in
the middle of White Plaza, and,
most recently, the appearance
of a "pregnant" senior going
into labor in the office of stu
dent affairs while complaining
about the lack of maternal care
services. The occasion? It was
Dean of Student Affairs Jim
Lyons' bon voyage party.
Breier highly recommended
the experience of starting your
own company while an under
graduate or immediately upon
graduation. "There's no other
point in your life when you
have less to lose and every
thing to gain — if all fails, you
still wind up with a great busi
ness experience."

Brett Kingstone, a class of '81
graduate in economics, is co
founder of Gekee Fiber Optics
in Palo Alto, a company which
reported sales of $1 million in
1982 and predicts a leap to $5
million this year. Kingstone's
list of accomplishments in
clude beginning his own bed

Money Market Investment
Fund, cofounding the Dupie
Book Press with Dupie car
toonist Gil Morales, and writ
ing a book, The Student Entre
preneur's Guide: How to Start
and Run Your Own Small Busi
ness — all while he was an un
dergraduate here.
Clients of Gekee Fiber Op
tics have included Disneyland
in Tokyo and the Epcott Center
in Florida, and its products
have allowed for new research
on early detection of blood
clots.
Reflecting on his college
years, Kingstone said that "no
school is going to put the en
trepreneurial instinct in you,
but I do think that Stanford —
and the west coast in general —
has an excellent environment
for the entrepreneur."

Gil Morales, best known as
the author of the Dupie comic
strip, recently published his
second book of Dupie car
toons, Wake Me When the
Semester Is Over. The former
economics major is currently
working on a new comic strip.
Morales said that he is "fairly
confident" that he wants to be
a syndicated cartoonist,
though currently he is working
as an accountant to provide
needed income.
His years here, Morales said,
"could have been improved
upon. When you graduate you
can see all the missed oppor
tunities that you had." He ad
ded, "Contacts were the best
things that I got out of Stan
ford."

can see all the missed oppor
tunities that you had." He ad
ded, "Contacts were the best
things that I got out of Stan
ford."
Despite the crunch of the
current recession, many recent
Stanford graduates said they
have found rewarding em
ployment— rangingfrom mak
ing computers think like hu
mans to making hundreds of
people smile while enjoying
company-sponsored picnics.
Making computers reason
like people has been the focus
of work by civil engineer Gary
Retelny, class of '81, who is
currently a second-year busi
ness student. Together with
two partners, his younger
brother Jose Retelny and Gary
Esserman, Retelny co-founded
Exemplary Software, a com
puter company which markets
"Rank Master," a software
program that allows computers
to make qualitative decisions
based on peoples' prefer
ences.
For example, the elder Re
telny said the program could
be used by an employer to de
cide on whom to hire. The de
fined criteria might include re
levant experience, education,
age and background. The pro
gram then leads the user
through a series of compari
sons between each of the can
didates and each criterion,
then extrapolates the weights
and rankings that are implicit in
the comparisons. The result is
a decision which optimizes the
assigned values and selects the
best candidate on the basis of
the employer's personal pref
erences.
Asked about his under
graduate career, Retelny said
that he looks back very favor
ably upon it and that he con
siders Stanford to offer "the
best all around package." He
also encouraged others to con
sider an engineering major. "If
you have a technical back
ground and come out of Stan
ford, you can pretty much
write your own ticket."
Not everyone agreed with
Retelny's assessment, how
ever. Karl Knapper, a jour
nalism major who graduated
last quarter, said he knows
several engineering graduates
who haven't been able to find
the job they wanted, and one
chemical engineer who Knap
per said is working at Payless in
order to make ends meet.
"A lot of people I know are
sort of shook up after gradua
tion," said Knapper. "Some
how you get the impression
that you'll be handed a job on a
silver platter when you get out,
but that's not always true. . . .
Stanford will open the door a
little more and it'll impress
some people, but mostly get
ting the job you want is a mat
ter of who you know and of
being in the right place at the
right time."

Throwing the "perfect
party" is the job of Mark Breier,
class of '81, who began a com

pany called Amazing Events
Unlimited with two other Stan
ford students while an under
graduate here. The company is
well known for its elaborate,
attention-getting events, in
cluding appearances by pro
tagonists dressed in gorilla
suits, feigned bicycle attacks in
the middle of White Plaza, and,
most recently, the appearance
of a "pregnant" senior going
into labor in the office of stu
dent affairs while complaining
about the lack of maternal care
services. The occasion? It was
Dean of Student Affairs Jim
Lyons' bon voyage party.
Breier highly recommended
the experience of starting your
own company while an under
graduate or immediately upon
graduation. "There's no other
point in your life when you
have less to lose and every
thing to gain — if all fails, you
still wind up with a great busi
ness experience."

Morales said that he is "fairly

as an accountant to provide
needed income.
