# JD/MBAs: Learning the best of both worlds
## 
### LISA LYNCH 
For many University under
graduates, a degree from the
Graduate School of Business or
the Law School is the ultimate
scholastic goal. But about 30
Stanford graduate students,
who go by the cryptic code
JD/MBA, are striving for a de
gree from both schools at
once.
Students choose to pursue
degrees in business and law at
the same for reasons ranging
from idealism to practicality.
"I'm a deviant," said David
Lempert, a Vale graduate and
third year juris doctor/masters
in business administration
candidate here. "I still believe
you can change the world, but
you have to work within the
system," he said. "The sys
tem," he added, "includes
both lawmakers w ho make pol
icy and businessmen who con
trol monev."
Timothy Reckart, a graduate
of Massachusetts Institute of
Technology and former assis
tant to the commissioner of the
Nuclear Regulatory Commis
sion, had a more pragmatic
reason for joining the pro
gram. "I was bored with my
profession, and I tried to find
the best way to use my en
gineering background," he
said.
Initially Reckart's career
goals were business-oriented
— "I wanted to become presi
dent of General Motors or

something" — but he has since
decided to become a tax
lawyer. "Tax law is a lot like
engineering," he explained.
Charles Hadley, a graduate
of George Washington Univer
sity and a former research as
sociate for the National Health
Policy Forum, admitted his
career goals had changed dur
inghisthreeyearsasa JD/MBA.
"Originally I was going to go
into public policy, but I've
since become involved in the
market and finance end of a
high-tech medical imaging
firm," he said. Hadley added
that even though he is pre
sently content with a business
career, he might eventually re
turn to public policy.
JD/MBAs are not officially
recognized by the University.
"Neither school wants a part of
the JD/MBA program," Lem
pert said. He explained that
)D/MBAs typically spend their
first year in the law school,
their second year in the busi
ness school, and their third
and fourth years taking courses
from both.
"While I was at business
school, the law school consid
ered me on leave of absence,"
Lempert continued, "and
when I was at law school, the
business school sent me a pile
of forms asking what I was
doing on my year off. Each
school has a separate file on
me."
Lempert became so disil

lusioned with the program that
he decided to take a year off.
Reckart, on the other hand,
called the technical problems
"minimal" and said he was ba
sically satisfied with the pro
gram.
"I'd do it again," Reckart
said. Calling his business train
ing "indispensable," he said,
"it gave me an excellent under
standing of the financial
world."
Problems with the JD/MBA
program included juggling the
quarter and semester system
and trying to avoid course
overlap. Hadley, Lempert and
Reckert mentioned that they
often found themselves taking
business school mid-terms
soon after law school finals,
and studyingduringthe breaks
scheduled by each school.
They also said that the law
school has a writing require
ment which JD/MBAs do not
really need, as the business
school c lasses assign frequent
papers.
Both Hadley and Lempert
complained about the cost of a
four-year graduate program.
Lempert said that among other
things he disconnected his
room phone in order to cut
costs.
"Another reason I'm taking
time off is so that I can earn
money for the fourth year," he
said.
The combination of a busi

ness and law degree does not
necessarily guarantee prestigi
ous and high-salaried positions.
"The problem isn't over
qualification, but that people
(employers) don't understand
the degrees," Lempert said.
Hadley agreed, saying "if
you apply for a career in busi
ness, they think you're going
to leave and become a lawyer.
They wonder 'how long are
you going to stay with us?' "
Lempert added a final note

of caution; many students, he
said, come into the program
expecting it to do something it
simply cannot do. "If you ex
pect the program to give you
leadership qualities, it won't. If
you expect to learn how to be
come an entrepreneur or
politician, you won't. If you
expect to learn how to become
a dillitante, you can't. ... Ba
sically the program trains you
to sit behind a desk at a corpo
ration and earn a lot of
money."
