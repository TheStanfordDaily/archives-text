# FDA okays human trials
## Cancer drug to be tested here 
### ALEX TARG 
A drug developed bv researchers at Stanford and
SRI International which helps radiation shrink can
cerous tumors received the green light from the Food
and Drug Administration this week to start the first
tests on humans.
According to Assoc. Prof Martin Brown of the Med
School, the new drug is still unnamed and is iden
tified only by the code SR-2508.1 he drug belongs to a
class of "radiosensitizers" so called because thev
make cancer cells especially vulnerable to damage
from radiation
X-ray beams are used under a therapist's direction
to kill cancer cells by tearing holes in their DNA, the
genetic material responsible for reproduction and
organization ot life processes.
The drug works by mimicking oxygen, which plays
an important role in radiation therapy, said Brown.
Both oxvgen and SR-2508 art} electron-affinic sub
stances which lock onto damaged portions of DNA
and prevent repair by chemical restitution, the cell's
natural repair mechanism, said Brown
"When you are dealing with cancer, killing 99 per
cent of the tumor is not enough." Brown said, "you
have to get it all "

The drug was discovered in 1979 by Dr. William Lee
of SRI International in Menlo Park and Brown as a
result of a systematic search for a radiosensitizer
without serious side-effects, said Lee
About 150 volunteers from across the country are
slated to participate in the first clinical trials of SR
-2508 over the next 12 month*. Sixty to 70 will be
treated at the Stanford Medical Center, said Brown.
"Although most drugs sent to the FDA lor approval
require a two to three year waiting period SR-2508
was approved for use with humans after only two
months. Drugs which look like promising cancer
treatments are often processed rapidly," said Brown.
The clinical trials, which will he led by Norman
Coleman, assistant professor at the Med School, will
involve two phases: the first to determine the optimal
therapeutic dose and the second to measure the ef
fectiveness of the treatment, said Brnwn.
The subjects used will be taken from a list ot volun
teers who suffer from advanced cancer and have not
responded to other treatments. They will be given
increasing doses until they respond positively or dis
play adverse reactions to elevated drug doses, he
said.
