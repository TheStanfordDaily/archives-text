New Salvadoran strategy proposed
Washington — The State Department official in
charge of Latin American policy has proposed a "two
track" strategy in El Salvador in which the United
States would promote negotiations with leftist guer
rillas there while continuing to support the
Salvadoran government's military efforts to suppress
the rebels, administration officials said yesterday.
The proposal, by Thomas Enders, assistant secretary
of state for inter-American affairs, touched off a lively
policy battle within the administration that may re
quire resolution by the National Security Council and
ultimately by President Reagan.
Contained in a working paper yet to be formally
submitted to the NSC, the Enders idea received what

one official described as a "less than enthusiastic re
sponse" from national security adviser William Clark
and U.N. Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick, who is cur
rently on a Central American trip one purpose of
which is to reassure pro-U.S. governments in the re
gion
Kirkpatrick is known to be skeptical of Enders' plan,
which calls for negotiations through a third country,
probably Spain, aimed at resolving the protracted
conflict in El Salvador
Meanwhile, frustration is rising in Congress over
the political and military stalemat- in El Salvador, in
creasing the pressure on the Reagan administration to
insist on talks between the guerillas and the
Salvadoran government.

Key members of the Senate foreign Relations and
House Foreign Affairs committees say Congress may
attach new conditions to the administration's 1984
military-aid request for El Salvador, perhaps requiring
the Salvadoran government initiate talks with the lef
tist opposition in order to receive U.S. assistance.
Sharon refuses to resign
Jerusalem — Defense Minister Ariel Sharon, ac
cused of "personal responsibility" in the Beirut
massacre, refused to resign yesterday, touching off a
government search for a face-saving formula that
would allow him to stay on without openly defying
the investigating commission.
Prime Minister Menachem Begin and his Cabinet

ministers mf»t for three hours, their second crisis
meeting in as many days, without making a final de
cision on the commission's explosive report. Another
meeting was scheduled for this afternoon
Sharon told top army commanders earlier in the
day,"I will not volunteer to resign. If the prime mm
ister wants (to fire me), he can do it and I won't com
plain."
After the Cabinet adjourned, a senior official told
reporters that the three-member commission had
used ambiguous language in its recommendation
concerning Sharon, leaving room for an interpreta
tion that would allow the burly former general to con
tinue as defense minister.
