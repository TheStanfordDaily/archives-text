New Salvadoran strategy proposed
Washington — The State Department official in
charge of Latin American policy has proposed a "two
track" strategy in El Salvador in which the United
States would promote negotiations with leftist guer
rillas there while continuing to support the
Salvadoran government's military efforts to suppress
the rebels, administration officials said yesterday.
The proposal, by Thomas Enders, assistant secretary
of state for inter-American affairs, touched off a lively
policy battle within the administration that may re
quire resolution by the National Security Council and
ultimately by President Reagan.
Contained in a working paper yet to be formally
submitted to the NSC, the Enders idea received what

one official described as a "less than enthusiastic re
sponse" from national security adviser William Clark
and U.N. Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick, who is cur
rently on a Central American trip one purpose of
which is to reassure pro-U.S. governments in the re
gion
Kirkpatrick is known to be skeptical of Enders' plan,
which calls for negotiations through a third country,
probably Spain, aimed at resolving the protracted
conflict in El Salvador
Meanwhile, frustration is rising in Congress over
the political and military stalemat- in El Salvador, in
creasing the pressure on the Reagan administration to
insist on talks between the guerillas and the
Salvadoran government.

Key members of the Senate foreign Relations and
House Foreign Affairs committees say Congress may
attach new conditions to the administration's 1984
military-aid request for El Salvador, perhaps requiring
the Salvadoran government initiate talks with the lef
tist opposition in order to receive U.S. assistance.
Sharon refuses to resign
Jerusalem — Defense Minister Ariel Sharon, ac
cused of "personal responsibility" in the Beirut
massacre, refused to resign yesterday, touching off a
government search for a face-saving formula that
would allow him to stay on without openly defying
the investigating commission.
Prime Minister Menachem Begin and his Cabinet

ministers mf»t for three hours, their second crisis
meeting in as many days, without making a final de
cision on the commission's explosive report. Another
meeting was scheduled for this afternoon
Sharon told top army commanders earlier in the
day,"I will not volunteer to resign. If the prime mm
ister wants (to fire me), he can do it and I won't com
plain."
After the Cabinet adjourned, a senior official told
reporters that the three-member commission had
used ambiguous language in its recommendation
concerning Sharon, leaving room for an interpreta
tion that would allow the burly former general to con
tinue as defense minister.

The Chinese declaration, handed to Secretary of State
George Shultz during his visit here last week, was published
in full yesterday bv the official New China News Agency in a
way that underlined the sharp and unresolved differences
between China and the United States.
So shrill was the tone of the Chinese protest, which was
also unusual in its formal publication by the government
news agency, that many diplomatic observers here
speculated that it must reflect very serious problems in Sino-
American relations and perhaps an equally serious diver
gence of opinion within the Chinese leadership over ties
with the United States.
EPA denies charges
Washington — Under increasingly broad attack from
House Democrats, Environmental Protection Agency Ad
ministrator Anne Corusch denied charges yesterday her
agency had been playing politics with the $1.6 billion "super
fund" created by Congress to clean up toxic waste dumps
around the country.
Gorsuch also denied that she is trying to obstruct a con
gressional investigation into EPA s handling of the cleanup
program — including its treatment of the Stringfellow Acid
Pits near Riverside, Calif., a 24-acre chemical dump steeped
in toxic wastes since the mid-1950s
The congressional inquiry, spearheaded by Rep. John
Dingell (D-Michigan), chairman of the House Energy and
Commerce Committee, is investigating whether superfund
grants for cleaning up hazardous chemical dump sites were
delayed — or, in some cases, speeded up — before last No
vember's elections to help Republican candidates.
Reagan gets freeze initiative
Washington — The "nuclear freeze" message that nearly 4
million Californians voted last Nov. 2 to send to President
Reagan finally was delivered to the White House yesterday
after weeks of political jockeying over who would be the of
ficial messenger.
The voters' formal request for an end to the U.S.-Soviet
nuclear arms race ultimately was delivered by the chairman
of the California freeze initiative campaign, Harold Willens,
who jokingly told the president upon leaving the Oval Of
fice: "Thanks for not chopping off the messenger's head."
Willens also suggested that Reagan and Soviet leader Yuri
Andropov hold a summit conference in Hiroshima, the
Japanese city hit by a U.S. atomic bomb, to symbolize their
commitment to avoiding a nuclear holocaust. "He listened
with interest and said he would think about it," Willens said.
But the rest of the 10-minute, publicly unannounced
meeting amounted to "verbal Ping Pong," Willens said, with
the men arguing their "deeply felt convictions" — Willens
contending that each superpower already has enough mega
tonage to destroy civilization and Reagan countering that
the United States cannot freeze itself into nuclear inferiority.
Iran launches offensive
Washington — Iranian tanks and infantry launched a "ma
jor attack" against entrenched Iraqi forces yesterday, accord
ing to U.S. intelligence officials who said Iran's "human
wave" offensives were leaving extremely heavy casualties on
both sides.
yesterday's attack, a new phase in the offensive begun by

Iran Monday, so far appeared to leave neither side with the
upper hand, the U.S. officials said, despite claims by Iran to
have retaken 120 square miles of Iranian territory and claims
by Baghdad that 15,000 Iranians had been slain
Adding to signs that the renewed fighting could bespread
ing, Baghdad said yesterday that its air force had left three
Iranian ships burning and sinking at the entrance to a water
way leading to the Persian Gulf.
The Iranian offensive, among the biggest in the 28-month
old war, began before dawn Monday on the plains between
Dezful, at the foot of the Zagros Mountains 300 miles
southwest of Tehran, and the Iraqi provincial capital of
Amarah, 200 miles southeast of Baghdad.
The Iranians attacked at both ends of a front estimated at
20 to 40 miles wide, but these first attacks apparently were
feints designed to draw the massed Iraqi forces away from
the center.
State may issue IOUs
Sacramento — Gov. George Deukme,ian toid a statewide
television audience yesterday that a "small handful" of state
Senate Democrats have brought the state to the brink of hav
ing to pay its bills with IOUs.
Senate Democrats, who have rejected his plan to carry
overat least half the state's $1.5 billion deficit beyondthis fis
cal year, "want to raise your taxes so badly that they are will
ing to impair California's image here and around the world,"
Deukmejian said.
The governor's proposal includes $600 million in spending
cuts, fund transfers and tax collection accelerations now,
with the rest of the deficit carried beynd the June 30 end of
the current fiscal year.
The Assembly has agreed, but Senate Democrats are insist
ing on a balanced budget this year and proposing a one-cent
sales tax increase, along with budget cuts.
Reagan against minimum wage
Washington — President Reagan said yesterday the feder
al minimum wage "should never have been applied to
young people" seeking summer and after-school jobs, and
"the right thing to do" would be to eliminate the minimum
wage for them. But he called it "hopeless" to send such a
proposal to Congress.
Reagan's minimum wage remark was the second off-the
cuff suggestion he has made in recent weeks about major
policy shifts not yet specifically endorsed by his own admin
istration. Previously, Reagan called for elimination of the
corporate income tax; the White House then backed away
from the idea.
On the minimum wage, the administration plans to ask
Congress to reduce the $3.35-an-hour rate to $2.50 from May
1 to Sept. 30 each year for everyone younger than 22.
Truckers strike nears end
Strong signs appeared yesterdav that the independent
truckers strike had nearly ended, as shippers and the Reagan
administration contended thatthe 10-daystrike'simpact had
virtually disappeared and some truckers voted to return to
the highways.
A spokesman for the Independent Truckers Association
insisted that the stoppage is still on, at least until tomorrow
afternoon, when strike leaders will assemble in Washington
to decide whether to formally end the job action that began
Jan. 31

Strike leaders will consider a proposal by four con
gressmen that calls on Congress to review the fairness of
sharp increases in road user fees and excise taxes on trucks,
trailers, parts and tires which prompted the walkout.
The increases — which boost some fees by up to 700 per
cent — take effect between this April and 1985. They are part
of the 1982 Highway Revenue Act, signed into law by Presi
dent Reagan last month, which also increases the federal gas
oline and diesel fuel tax by 5 cents a gallon April 1.
Social Security may fall short
Washington — Social Security reserves will be razor thin
from 1985 to 1987 and could fall a bit short even if Congress
approves a proposed bipartisan rescue plan, experts yester
day warned the House Ways and Means Social Security sub
committee.
"The real danger is that the thing won't fly in 1985 and
1986," said Dwight Bartlett, former chief actuary of Social Se
curity, after testifying for the American Academy of Ac
tuaries, which supports the plan with some qualifications. „
The plan proposed by a bipartisan presidential com
mission provides $168 billion over the next seven years to
meet Social Security's short-run crisis. It also recommends
steps to eliminate about two-thirds of its long-range deficit,
which is estimated at 1.8 percent of taxable payroll over the
next 75 years.
Bartlett said new estimates by Social Security actuaries,
based on economic assumptions not originally available to
the commission, could show the plan will not produce quite
enough money to keep the system solvent from 1985 to 1987
because the major new revenue source — advancing a por
tion of the scheduled 1990 Social Security tax increase —
won't kick in until 1988.
Udall not to seek nomination
Washington — Rep. Morris Udall announced yesterday
that he would not actively seek the Democratic Presidential
nomination "at this time" — but said he hoped to be a favor
ite-son candidate from his home state of Arizona and would
accept a draft.
In a speech to the National Press Club, Udall attributed his
decision in large part to the difficulty of raising the necessary
funds and establishing a political organization in the time re
maining before the delegate selection process begins next
year.
Udall also said he was concerned about meeting the ob
ligations of his congressional seat, which he has held since
1961, while seeking the nomination, and about the possibility
that his candidacy might splinter liberal support in the Dem
ocratic party.
Market experiences more losses
The stock market declined moderately yesterday, adding
to its losses of the previous session.
The Dow jones average of 30 industrials, off 11.77 Tuesday,
fell another 7.91 to 1067.42.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange reached 84.52
million shares, up from 76.58 million Tuesday.

of the 1982 Highway Revenue Act, signed into law by Presi

oline and diesel fuel tax by 5 cents a gallon April 1.
Social Security may fall short
Washington — Social Security reserves will be razor thin
from 1985 to 1987 and could fall a bit short even if Congress
approves a proposed bipartisan rescue plan, experts yester
day warned the House Ways and Means Social Security sub
committee.
"The real danger is that the thing won't fly in 1985 and
1986," said Dwight Bartlett, former chief actuary of Social Se
curity, after testifying for the American Academy of Ac
tuaries, which supports the plan with some qualifications. „
The plan proposed by a bipartisan presidential com
mission provides $168 billion over the next seven years to
meet Social Security's short-run crisis. It also recommends
steps to eliminate about two-thirds of its long-range deficit,
which is estimated at 1.8 percent of taxable payroll over the
next 75 years.
Bartlett said new estimates by Social Security actuaries,
based on economic assumptions not originally available to
the commission, could show the plan will not produce quite
enough money to keep the system solvent from 1985 to 1987
because the major new revenue source — advancing a por
tion of the scheduled 1990 Social Security tax increase —
won't kick in until 1988.
Udall not to seek nomination
Washington — Rep. Morris Udall announced yesterday
that he would not actively seek the Democratic Presidential
nomination "at this time" — but said he hoped to be a favor
ite-son candidate from his home state of Arizona and would
accept a draft.
In a speech to the National Press Club, Udall attributed his
decision in large part to the difficulty of raising the necessary
funds and establishing a political organization in the time re
maining before the delegate selection process begins next
year.
Udall also said he was concerned about meeting the ob
ligations of his congressional seat, which he has held since
1961, while seeking the nomination, and about the possibility
that his candidacy might splinter liberal support in the Dem
ocratic party.

New Salvadoran strategy proposed
Washington — The State Department official in
charge of Latin American policy has proposed a "two
track" strategy in El Salvador in which the United
States would promote negotiations with leftist guer
rillas there while continuing to support the
Salvadoran government's military efforts to suppress
the rebels, administration officials said yesterday.
The proposal, by Thomas Enders, assistant secretary
of state for inter-American affairs, touched off a lively
policy battle within the administration that may re
quire resolution by the National Security Council and
ultimately by President Reagan.
Contained in a working paper yet to be formally
submitted to the NSC, the Enders idea received what

one official described as a "less than enthusiastic re
sponse" from national security adviser William Clark
and U.N. Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick, who is cur
rently on a Central American trip one purpose of
which is to reassure pro-U.S. governments in the re
gion
Kirkpatrick is known to be skeptical of Enders' plan,
which calls for negotiations through a third country,
probably Spain, aimed at resolving the protracted
conflict in El Salvador
Meanwhile, frustration is rising in Congress over
the political and military stalemat- in El Salvador, in
creasing the pressure on the Reagan administration to
insist on talks between the guerillas and the
Salvadoran government.

Key members of the Senate foreign Relations and
House Foreign Affairs committees say Congress may
attach new conditions to the administration's 1984
military-aid request for El Salvador, perhaps requiring
the Salvadoran government initiate talks with the lef
tist opposition in order to receive U.S. assistance.
Sharon refuses to resign
Jerusalem — Defense Minister Ariel Sharon, ac
cused of "personal responsibility" in the Beirut
massacre, refused to resign yesterday, touching off a
government search for a face-saving formula that
would allow him to stay on without openly defying
the investigating commission.
Prime Minister Menachem Begin and his Cabinet

ministers mf»t for three hours, their second crisis
meeting in as many days, without making a final de
cision on the commission's explosive report. Another
meeting was scheduled for this afternoon
Sharon told top army commanders earlier in the
day,"I will not volunteer to resign. If the prime mm
ister wants (to fire me), he can do it and I won't com
plain."
After the Cabinet adjourned, a senior official told
reporters that the three-member commission had
used ambiguous language in its recommendation
concerning Sharon, leaving room for an interpreta
tion that would allow the burly former general to con
tinue as defense minister.

The Chinese declaration, handed to Secretary of State
George Shultz during his visit here last week, was published
in full yesterday bv the official New China News Agency in a
way that underlined the sharp and unresolved differences
between China and the United States.
So shrill was the tone of the Chinese protest, which was
also unusual in its formal publication by the government
news agency, that many diplomatic observers here
speculated that it must reflect very serious problems in Sino-
American relations and perhaps an equally serious diver
gence of opinion within the Chinese leadership over ties
with the United States.
EPA denies charges
Washington — Under increasingly broad attack from
House Democrats, Environmental Protection Agency Ad
ministrator Anne Corusch denied charges yesterday her
agency had been playing politics with the $1.6 billion "super
fund" created by Congress to clean up toxic waste dumps
around the country.
Gorsuch also denied that she is trying to obstruct a con
gressional investigation into EPA s handling of the cleanup
program — including its treatment of the Stringfellow Acid
Pits near Riverside, Calif., a 24-acre chemical dump steeped
in toxic wastes since the mid-1950s
The congressional inquiry, spearheaded by Rep. John
Dingell (D-Michigan), chairman of the House Energy and
Commerce Committee, is investigating whether superfund
grants for cleaning up hazardous chemical dump sites were
delayed — or, in some cases, speeded up — before last No
vember's elections to help Republican candidates.
Reagan gets freeze initiative
Washington — The "nuclear freeze" message that nearly 4
million Californians voted last Nov. 2 to send to President
Reagan finally was delivered to the White House yesterday
after weeks of political jockeying over who would be the of
ficial messenger.
The voters' formal request for an end to the U.S.-Soviet
nuclear arms race ultimately was delivered by the chairman
of the California freeze initiative campaign, Harold Willens,
who jokingly told the president upon leaving the Oval Of
fice: "Thanks for not chopping off the messenger's head."
Willens also suggested that Reagan and Soviet leader Yuri
Andropov hold a summit conference in Hiroshima, the
Japanese city hit by a U.S. atomic bomb, to symbolize their
commitment to avoiding a nuclear holocaust. "He listened
with interest and said he would think about it," Willens said.
But the rest of the 10-minute, publicly unannounced
meeting amounted to "verbal Ping Pong," Willens said, with
the men arguing their "deeply felt convictions" — Willens
contending that each superpower already has enough mega
tonage to destroy civilization and Reagan countering that
the United States cannot freeze itself into nuclear inferiority.
Iran launches offensive
Washington — Iranian tanks and infantry launched a "ma
jor attack" against entrenched Iraqi forces yesterday, accord
ing to U.S. intelligence officials who said Iran's "human
wave" offensives were leaving extremely heavy casualties on
both sides.
yesterday's attack, a new phase in the offensive begun by

Iran Monday, so far appeared to leave neither side with the
upper hand, the U.S. officials said, despite claims by Iran to
have retaken 120 square miles of Iranian territory and claims
by Baghdad that 15,000 Iranians had been slain
Adding to signs that the renewed fighting could bespread
ing, Baghdad said yesterday that its air force had left three
Iranian ships burning and sinking at the entrance to a water
way leading to the Persian Gulf.
The Iranian offensive, among the biggest in the 28-month
old war, began before dawn Monday on the plains between
Dezful, at the foot of the Zagros Mountains 300 miles
southwest of Tehran, and the Iraqi provincial capital of
Amarah, 200 miles southeast of Baghdad.
The Iranians attacked at both ends of a front estimated at
20 to 40 miles wide, but these first attacks apparently were
feints designed to draw the massed Iraqi forces away from
the center.
State may issue IOUs
Sacramento — Gov. George Deukme,ian toid a statewide
television audience yesterday that a "small handful" of state
Senate Democrats have brought the state to the brink of hav
ing to pay its bills with IOUs.
Senate Democrats, who have rejected his plan to carry
overat least half the state's $1.5 billion deficit beyondthis fis
cal year, "want to raise your taxes so badly that they are will
ing to impair California's image here and around the world,"
Deukmejian said.
The governor's proposal includes $600 million in spending
cuts, fund transfers and tax collection accelerations now,
with the rest of the deficit carried beynd the June 30 end of
the current fiscal year.
The Assembly has agreed, but Senate Democrats are insist
ing on a balanced budget this year and proposing a one-cent
sales tax increase, along with budget cuts.
Reagan against minimum wage
Washington — President Reagan said yesterday the feder
al minimum wage "should never have been applied to
young people" seeking summer and after-school jobs, and
"the right thing to do" would be to eliminate the minimum
wage for them. But he called it "hopeless" to send such a
proposal to Congress.
Reagan's minimum wage remark was the second off-the
cuff suggestion he has made in recent weeks about major
policy shifts not yet specifically endorsed by his own admin
istration. Previously, Reagan called for elimination of the
corporate income tax; the White House then backed away
from the idea.
On the minimum wage, the administration plans to ask
Congress to reduce the $3.35-an-hour rate to $2.50 from May
1 to Sept. 30 each year for everyone younger than 22.
Truckers strike nears end
Strong signs appeared yesterdav that the independent
truckers strike had nearly ended, as shippers and the Reagan
administration contended thatthe 10-daystrike'simpact had
virtually disappeared and some truckers voted to return to
the highways.
A spokesman for the Independent Truckers Association
insisted that the stoppage is still on, at least until tomorrow
afternoon, when strike leaders will assemble in Washington
to decide whether to formally end the job action that began
Jan. 31

Strike leaders will consider a proposal by four con
gressmen that calls on Congress to review the fairness of
sharp increases in road user fees and excise taxes on trucks,
trailers, parts and tires which prompted the walkout.
The increases — which boost some fees by up to 700 per
cent — take effect between this April and 1985. They are part
of the 1982 Highway Revenue Act, signed into law by Presi
dent Reagan last month, which also increases the federal gas

southwest of Tehran, and the Iraqi provincial capital of
Amarah, 200 miles southeast of Baghdad.
The Iranians attacked at both ends of a front estimated at
20 to 40 miles wide, but these first attacks apparently were
feints designed to draw the massed Iraqi forces away from
the center.
State may issue IOUs
Sacramento — Gov. George Deukme,ian toid a statewide
television audience yesterday that a "small handful" of state
Senate Democrats have brought the state to the brink of hav
ing to pay its bills with IOUs.
Senate Democrats, who have rejected his plan to carry
overat least half the state's $1.5 billion deficit beyondthis fis
cal year, "want to raise your taxes so badly that they are will
ing to impair California's image here and around the world,"
Deukmejian said.
The governor's proposal includes $600 million in spending
cuts, fund transfers and tax collection accelerations now,
with the rest of the deficit carried beynd the June 30 end of
the current fiscal year.
The Assembly has agreed, but Senate Democrats are insist
ing on a balanced budget this year and proposing a one-cent
sales tax increase, along with budget cuts.
Reagan against minimum wage
Washington — President Reagan said yesterday the feder
al minimum wage "should never have been applied to
young people" seeking summer and after-school jobs, and
"the right thing to do" would be to eliminate the minimum
wage for them. But he called it "hopeless" to send such a
proposal to Congress.
Reagan's minimum wage remark was the second off-the
cuff suggestion he has made in recent weeks about major
policy shifts not yet specifically endorsed by his own admin
istration. Previously, Reagan called for elimination of the
corporate income tax; the White House then backed away
from the idea.
On the minimum wage, the administration plans to ask
Congress to reduce the $3.35-an-hour rate to $2.50 from May
1 to Sept. 30 each year for everyone younger than 22.
Truckers strike nears end
Strong signs appeared yesterdav that the independent
truckers strike had nearly ended, as shippers and the Reagan
administration contended thatthe 10-daystrike'simpact had
virtually disappeared and some truckers voted to return to
the highways.
A spokesman for the Independent Truckers Association
insisted that the stoppage is still on, at least until tomorrow
afternoon, when strike leaders will assemble in Washington
to decide whether to formally end the job action that began
Jan. 31

Strike leaders will consider a proposal by four con
gressmen that calls on Congress to review the fairness of
sharp increases in road user fees and excise taxes on trucks,
trailers, parts and tires which prompted the walkout.
The increases — which boost some fees by up to 700 per
cent — take effect between this April and 1985. They are part
of the 1982 Highway Revenue Act, signed into law by Presi
dent Reagan last month, which also increases the federal gas
oline and diesel fuel tax by 5 cents a gallon April 1.
Social Security may fall short
Washington — Social Security reserves will be razor thin
from 1985 to 1987 and could fall a bit short even if Congress
approves a proposed bipartisan rescue plan, experts yester
day warned the House Ways and Means Social Security sub
committee.
"The real danger is that the thing won't fly in 1985 and
1986," said Dwight Bartlett, former chief actuary of Social Se
curity, after testifying for the American Academy of Ac
tuaries, which supports the plan with some qualifications. „
The plan proposed by a bipartisan presidential com
mission provides $168 billion over the next seven years to
meet Social Security's short-run crisis. It also recommends
steps to eliminate about two-thirds of its long-range deficit,
which is estimated at 1.8 percent of taxable payroll over the
next 75 years.
Bartlett said new estimates by Social Security actuaries,
based on economic assumptions not originally available to
the commission, could show the plan will not produce quite
enough money to keep the system solvent from 1985 to 1987
because the major new revenue source — advancing a por
tion of the scheduled 1990 Social Security tax increase —
won't kick in until 1988.
Udall not to seek nomination
Washington — Rep. Morris Udall announced yesterday
that he would not actively seek the Democratic Presidential
nomination "at this time" — but said he hoped to be a favor
ite-son candidate from his home state of Arizona and would
accept a draft.
In a speech to the National Press Club, Udall attributed his
decision in large part to the difficulty of raising the necessary
funds and establishing a political organization in the time re
maining before the delegate selection process begins next
year.
Udall also said he was concerned about meeting the ob
ligations of his congressional seat, which he has held since
1961, while seeking the nomination, and about the possibility
that his candidacy might splinter liberal support in the Dem
ocratic party.

New Salvadoran strategy proposed
Washington — The State Department official in
charge of Latin American policy has proposed a "two
track" strategy in El Salvador in which the United
States would promote negotiations with leftist guer
rillas there while continuing to support the
Salvadoran government's military efforts to suppress
the rebels, administration officials said yesterday.
The proposal, by Thomas Enders, assistant secretary
of state for inter-American affairs, touched off a lively
policy battle within the administration that may re
quire resolution by the National Security Council and
ultimately by President Reagan.
Contained in a working paper yet to be formally
submitted to the NSC, the Enders idea received what

one official described as a "less than enthusiastic re
sponse" from national security adviser William Clark
and U.N. Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick, who is cur
rently on a Central American trip one purpose of
which is to reassure pro-U.S. governments in the re
gion
Kirkpatrick is known to be skeptical of Enders' plan,
which calls for negotiations through a third country,
probably Spain, aimed at resolving the protracted
conflict in El Salvador
Meanwhile, frustration is rising in Congress over
the political and military stalemat- in El Salvador, in
creasing the pressure on the Reagan administration to
insist on talks between the guerillas and the
Salvadoran government.

Key members of the Senate foreign Relations and
House Foreign Affairs committees say Congress may
attach new conditions to the administration's 1984
military-aid request for El Salvador, perhaps requiring
the Salvadoran government initiate talks with the lef
tist opposition in order to receive U.S. assistance.
Sharon refuses to resign
Jerusalem — Defense Minister Ariel Sharon, ac
cused of "personal responsibility" in the Beirut
massacre, refused to resign yesterday, touching off a
government search for a face-saving formula that
would allow him to stay on without openly defying
the investigating commission.
Prime Minister Menachem Begin and his Cabinet

ministers mf»t for three hours, their second crisis
meeting in as many days, without making a final de
cision on the commission's explosive report. Another
meeting was scheduled for this afternoon
Sharon told top army commanders earlier in the
day,"I will not volunteer to resign. If the prime mm
ister wants (to fire me), he can do it and I won't com
plain."
After the Cabinet adjourned, a senior official told
reporters that the three-member commission had
used ambiguous language in its recommendation
concerning Sharon, leaving room for an interpreta
tion that would allow the burly former general to con
tinue as defense minister.
r-o-
The Chinese declaration, handed to Secretary of State
George Shultz during his visit here last week, was published
in full yesterday bv the official New China News Agency in a
way that underlined the sharp and unresolved differences
between China and the United States.
So shrill was the tone of the Chinese protest, which was
also unusual in its formal publication by the government
news agency, that many diplomatic observers here
speculated that it must reflect very serious problems in Sino-
American relations and perhaps an equally serious diver
gence of opinion within the Chinese leadership over ties
with the United States.
EPA denies charges
Washington — Under increasingly broad attack from
House Democrats, Environmental Protection Agency Ad
ministrator Anne Corusch denied charges yesterday her
agency had been playing politics with the $1.6 billion "super
fund" created by Congress to clean up toxic waste dumps
around the country.
Gorsuch also denied that she is trying to obstruct a con
gressional investigation into EPA s handling of the cleanup
program — including its treatment of the Stringfellow Acid
Pits near Riverside, Calif., a 24-acre chemical dump steeped
in toxic wastes since the mid-1950s
The congressional inquiry, spearheaded by Rep. John
Dingell (D-Michigan), chairman of the House Energy and
Commerce Committee, is investigating whether superfund
grants for cleaning up hazardous chemical dump sites were
delayed — or, in some cases, speeded up — before last No
vember's elections to help Republican candidates.
Reagan gets freeze initiative
Washington — The "nuclear freeze" message that nearly 4
million Californians voted last Nov. 2 to send to President
Reagan finally was delivered to the White House yesterday
after weeks of political jockeying over who would be the of
ficial messenger.
The voters' formal request for an end to the U.S.-Soviet
nuclear arms race ultimately was delivered by the chairman
of the California freeze initiative campaign, Harold Willens,
who jokingly told the president upon leaving the Oval Of
fice: "Thanks for not chopping off the messenger's head."
Willens also suggested that Reagan and Soviet leader Yuri
Andropov hold a summit conference in Hiroshima, the
Japanese city hit by a U.S. atomic bomb, to symbolize their
commitment to avoiding a nuclear holocaust. "He listened
with interest and said he would think about it," Willens said.
But the rest of the 10-minute, publicly unannounced
meeting amounted to "verbal Ping Pong," Willens said, with
the men arguing their "deeply felt convictions" — Willens
contending that each superpower already has enough mega
tonage to destroy civilization and Reagan countering that
the United States cannot freeze itself into nuclear inferiority.
Iran launches offensive
Washington — Iranian tanks and infantry launched a "ma
jor attack" against entrenched Iraqi forces yesterday, accord
ing to U.S. intelligence officials who said Iran's "human
wave" offensives were leaving extremely heavy casualties on
both sides.
yesterday's attack, a new phase in the offensive begun by

Iran Monday, so far appeared to leave neither side with the
upper hand, the U.S. officials said, despite claims by Iran to
have retaken 120 square miles of Iranian territory and claims
by Baghdad that 15,000 Iranians had been slain
Adding to signs that the renewed fighting could bespread
ing, Baghdad said yesterday that its air force had left three
Iranian ships burning and sinking at the entrance to a water
way leading to the Persian Gulf.
The Iranian offensive, among the biggest in the 28-month
old war, began before dawn Monday on the plains between
Dezful, at the foot of the Zagros Mountains 300 miles
southwest of Tehran, and the Iraqi provincial capital of
Amarah, 200 miles southeast of Baghdad.
