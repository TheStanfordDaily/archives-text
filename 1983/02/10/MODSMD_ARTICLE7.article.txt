## Shultz visits China Japan; guerrillas attack Phillipines China trip brings mixed results 
### 
Compiled from news reports and
wire services
During his visit to Peking last
week, Secretary of State
George Shultz sought to reas
sure China of the U.S. com
mitment to developing
stronger relations. While
Shultz was successful in
eliminating an increasing
communication gap that had
developed in recent weeks be
tween the United States and
China, he was unable to pla
cate Chinese demands for a
date of curtailment on arms
shipments to Taiwan.
The Chinese were highly crit
ical of U.S. actions with regard
to South Korea and Taiwan.
After Shultz departed for South
Korea, China's Foreign Minis
try condemned the United
States for conducting joint mil
itary maneuvers in South Korea
and categorically denied that
Prime Minister Zhao Ziyang
had decided to visit Washing

ton in December. The word of
Zhao's intention had come
from an authoritative Chinese
source last week.
U.S. officials expressed puz
zlement over Peking's sharp
change in tone so soon after
what they characterized as a
friendly and constructive re
ception during the secretary of
state's four days of top-level
talks. By coincidence or not,
the strident responses came as
Peking was preparing to re
sume normalization talks with
Moscow.
The U.S. â€” South Korean
maneuvers, which began Feb.
2, had been discussed by
Chinese Vice Foreign Minister
Han Xu and the secretary in an
informal conversation Friday.
U.S. officials said Shultz told
Han that the United States in
formed the North Koreans in
advance of the exercise and as
sured them it was a routine op
eration with no aggressive in
tentions.
Taiwan had been the major
topic in Shultzs' talks here,
along with trade and technol
ogy transfer. The Chinese have
been unhappy with President
Reagan's continuing expres
sions of support for the anti-
Communist regime of Taiwan,
the slow issuance of licenses
for promised technology sales,
and restrictions imposed un
ilaterally last month on
Chinese textile exports.
Schultz repeatedly assured
the Chinese that the United
States would strictly observe its
commitment last August to
gradually decrease the sale of
arms to the Taiwanese.
Xinhua's statement charged
that "The ceiling set by the U.S.
for its arms sales to Taiwan far
exceeded the maximum an

nual figures established by
U.S. government depart
ments."
The accusation puzzled
American officials, who said no
ceiling had been specified in
the negotiaions leading up to
last August's joint com
munique. The commitment
was simply to reduce sales
below the level prevailing at
the normalization of relations
with Peking in 1979.
While Shultz was here, State
Department officials insisted
that the talks were candid and
cordial. Immediately after his
nearly two hours with advisory
chiarman Deng Xiaoping
Saturday, a Chinese observer
who was present said Deng
told Shultz that he hopes their
talks would be "the start of a
new beginning" in Sino-
American relations.
President Reagan's invitation
was conveyed to Zhao last Fri
day by Shultz. An unofficial
source said at the time that
Zhao opted for September so
he could combine a U.S. tour
with the annual session of the
U.N. General Assembly. There
was some belief the Chinese
had decided to go public with
their critical comments be
cause of disappointment that
the United States did not im
mediately cut off arms ship
ments to Taiwan after the Au
gust communique.
Shultz had assured the
Chinese, a U.S. source said,
that the reduction in ship
ments would become evident
in the months ahead. He ex
plained no base level had been
specified in the talks leading
up to the August communique,
nor had either side defined
precisely what was meant by
"arms."
