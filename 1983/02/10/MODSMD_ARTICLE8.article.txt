# Communists challenge Phillipine government
## 
### 
Compiled from news reports and wire services
Communist guerrillas are stepping up their challenge to the
government of Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos, attacking
targets in greater numbers than ever before and increasing their
recruitment, according to western diplomats and Philippine
sources.
The campaign by the New People's Army (NPA), the armed
wing of the Communist Party of the Philippines, is forcing the
government to devote more resources to its counterinsurgency
effort at a time of severe economic straits.
In a meeting with military leaders Monday, Marcos ordered the
deployment ot more troops and helicopters in the southern
Philippines, where communist guerrillas killed 24 people in
three attacks over the previous weekend, news agencies re
ported. The Philippine leader called for an "intensified peace and
order campaign" in northern and eastern Mindanao the island
that has become the scene of some of the heaviest rebel activity.
While the NPA still is considered a long way from its goal ot
toppling the government, analysts see the organization as stead
ily gaining ground. Lately the guerrillas' recruiting efforts have
been taking advantage of hard economic times in the Philippines,
where more than half the population lives below the poverty line.
A Defense Ministry spokesperson put the group's strength at
4000 to 6000 fighters, but insisted that only about only about 2500
were armed and that they relied on a "mass base" of only 50,000
supporters and sympathizers. However, a well-informed western
diplomat quoted a provincial governor as telling him privately
that there are at least 12,000 NPA guerrillas in the country, about
half of them in Mindanao.
"Up to last month the NPA had not really done much," this
diplomat said, but in January an unusual number of incidents
were reported — at least 28 guerrilla attacks — with some of the
rebel units consisting of up to 200 fighters instead of 10 or 12 as
before.
In the small coastal town of Mabini, the guerrillas captured the
municipal hall and the local police station without a fight, seizing
weapons, ammunition and other supplies. Other recent inci
dents include the raiding of a government installation near the
town of Tagum, in which 18 persons were killed, 10 of whom were
civilians.
In response to the communists, the Philippine army last month
moved three battalions out of the Moslem area of West Mindanao
to fight the rebels in the northern and eastern parts of the island.
The result of the guerrilla actions, according to former Philip
pine president Diosdado Macapagal, is that the country — the
most important U.S. ally in Southeast Asia — is drifting the way of
Nicaragua, whose U.S.-backed authoritarian government was
overthrown by leftist rebels.
