# Japan boosts defense
## 
### 
Compiled from news reports and
wire services
Before visiting China last
week, Secretary of State
George Shultz stopped by
Tokyo to discuss defense is
sues with Japanese leaders.
This followed a January visit to
Washington by Japanese Prime
Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone,
who met with Reagan to dis
cuss free trade and military
spending.
While Shultz reassured the
Japanese that the United States
would not conclude an arms
control agreement with ihe
Soviet Union at the expense of
the security of Japan, he also
pushed for an expansion of Ja
pan's self-defense forces.
One immediate result of
Shultz's push for greater coop

eration on defense issues is
that U.S. aircraft carriers will be
able to return to Japanese
ports. The last port entry of a
U.S. nuclear-powered carrier
was when the USS Enterprise
docked into Sasebo in 1968 and
triggered widespread rioting
Nonetheless, U.S. defense
officials are still disappointed
with Nakasone's defense
budget. A recent battle be
tween Nakasone and his Fi
nance Ministry resulted in a
compromise of a 6.5 percent
increase in defense expendi
tures. Nakasone had been hop
ing for a boost of 7.75 percent,
which would still leave Japan's
defense budget at less than
one percent of its C.NP. By con
trast, the United States is
spending over six percent of its
GNP on national defense.
