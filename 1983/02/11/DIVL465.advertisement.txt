You've never
seen anything
like it . . .
A nocturnal animal, ir
has seven terminal
arms and occasionally
short hands, goes to
bed late five nights a
week, writes heads,
lays pages, makes
odlines, deadlines,
cutlines and pics, eats
pizza at night and
sometimes its own
words Its the Daily,
your newspaper.
You could love it!
