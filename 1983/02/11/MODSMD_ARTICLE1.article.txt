# Stanford West may be reduced
## PA raps housing plan 
### JASON COLE Staff writer 
The Palo Alto Planning Commis
sion made its final recommendations
Wedriesday to the Palo Alto City
Council on the Stanford West hous
ing project But University officials
objected to the amount of time taken
and the type of recommendations
made, according to Planning Di
rector Phi I Williams
Specifically, the commission ad
vised the council to decrease the
number of units in the housing proj
ect from 1275 to 910 unless the Uni
versity follows a set of zoning guide
lines. The counc il will begin hearings
next month.
Williams called the five months of
deliberations by the commission
"one of the most frustrating events
of my planning career."
Williams said he had originally
hoped that "things would move
quickly enough that construction
would get started this summer."
But Frank Morrow, the University
director ot real estate, said, "We're
not going to be able to start building
until the spring of next year."
Commissioner Jack Sutorius said,
"this is the largest single oroiect that

the commission has had to look at in
20years and the biggest environmen
tal impact report to go along with it.
It was just a long process."
University officials said they are
also worried about the commission's
recommendations, which have
; aused much disagreement between
the two factions.
The? commission's recom
mendations primarily call for more
open space to prevent density and
crowding. But University officials
said the recommendations, if
adopted, will drive the cost of the
project out of the realm of possibil
ity.
I he project is designed to provide
"affordable" housing to a "cross
section of Stanford faculty and staff,"
Morrow said. "It's not in our own
self-interest to create units that are
not affordable in our own back
yard," he added.
"It they (the council) adopt all of
the recommendations, we will have
to go back to the drawing board,"
Morrow said.
But Sutorius, who developed the
formula in the Commissions' rec
ommendations, said there is a dispar

ity in the definition of "affordable."
In keeping with a board of trustees
action taken last spring, units in Stan
ford West will be priced at the local
per-square-foot "market rate" for
both sale and rental.
Sutorius criticized this policy. "I
disagree with the view that to not
include the value of the land would
be like giving away stock in AT&T.
They should view it as an investment
in improving the University by help
ing professors be able to afford to
live here. Especially since they (the

University) are retaining the rights to
land," he said.
Morrow said that although the
board of trustees had not yet formu
lated a position on the recom
mendations, he felt that it would be a
bad precedent to set. "To set aside
large amount of land fora contracted
period of time could be dangerous
for the future."
Despite these differences,
Sutorius said, "If there is any sense of
acrimony, I hope I haven't been a
part of it. Our (the commission's) let
ter will be very supportive of the
values that the university is trying to
bring to the community. We don't
want a residue of mistrust between
the commission and the University."
