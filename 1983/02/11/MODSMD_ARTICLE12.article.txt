## The
						Stanford Daily LOTS: not enough 
### 
Last December, Time magazine named the
computer the "Man of the Year." Although it is
not likely that University President Donald Ken
nedy and Dean Fred Hargadon will be replaced
with adding machines in the near future, com
puters are occupying an increasingly central po
sition in campus life.
One might expect the increasing interest in
computers to center around the Computer Sci
ence Department, recently ranked first in the
nation. To be sure, this is a great achievement.
The Computer Science faculty deserve a con
gratulatory pat on the back. It is a shame, how
ever, that much of the campus' computer
related discussion stems from the frustrations
of would-be programmers in their dealings with
our "largely over-worked" LOTS computer sys
tem.
It is the surging popularity of computer
oriented classes that has caused their recent fall
into popular disfavor. LOTS is currently sup
porting 5000 users who must share just over 100
terminals and two central processing units (the
brains of the operation). Adding to the confu
sion is the fact that at least 10 percent of the
users are taking introductory classes and as
such are unfamiliar with the esoteric demands
of these forbidding machines.
The end result of this situation seems to be
extended waits for available terminals (four

hours?!), frequent "crashes" as the computers
find they can't cope with the heavy work-load
and a general (albeit often friendly) voice of
dissatisfaction with the computer facility.
The ultimate solution is expansion: double
the capacity of LOTS, or even better, triple it.
Better still, install a terminal in every dorm
room. In fact, the new Governor's Corner hous
ing was especially and optimistically wired an
ticipating just such a future development.
The obvious reply which quickly extinguishes
such pipe-dreams is the present lack of re
sources. There is no sign that either floor space
or funding will appear in the near future to ac
commodate LOTS and LOTS of big, shiny, new
computers. At any rate, the staff undoubtedly
had its hands full coping with the two LOTS
systems currently in operation.
The situation as it stands now, however, de
fies restriction by such limitations. The contem
porary importance of, and campus-wide de
mand for adequate computer facilities is a need
which must be answered. We feel that the de
velopment of a computer facility capable of
handling the heavy demands of the University
should be a top priority in the coming years. The
'70s brought the option of the computer to the
education process at Stanford; in the '80s it has
become a necessity.
