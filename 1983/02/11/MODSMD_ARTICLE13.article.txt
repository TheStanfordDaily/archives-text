## Housing rates unfair to grads 
### 
Last Tuesday's announcement of
an average 14.5 percent rent increase
for on-campus housing in 1983-84 is
the latest manifestation of a set of
University policies which are unfair
and contrary to the best interests of
the University's graduate student
community. For the fourth straight
year, rents in graduate student hous
ing are increasing faster than can be
justified by increases in actual costs,
in order to help finance the construc
tion of new undergraduate housing.
We believe that the very idea that
graduate students living on-campus
should help to pay for new under
graduate housing is unfair, given the
University's decision to provide for
undergraduate housing needs rather
than for those of graduate students.
At a time when the unmet housing
needs of graduate students ex
ceeded those of undergraduates, the
University proceeded to build 800
new units of undergraduate housing
and, rather than asking those stu
dents eligible to live in them to pay
for the new housing, the University
chose to spread the burden over all
students living on-campus, including
graduate students.
The final rent increases, when they
are announced, will probably be
slightly below 14.5 percent in many
Escondido Village apartments. This is
because the Task Group on Housing
Kates found the current rents to be
higher than could be justified, so that
Escondido Village residents are cur
rently paying more than their "fair
share" of housing system costs (in
cluding the costs of the new under
graduate complex Governor's
Corner) even by the University's
standards.
Without part of the costs of Gov
ernor's Corner included in their rent,
graduate students would not be fac
ing rent increases of approximately
28 percent over the next two years.
We are of course aware that the Uni
versity defends the current financial
arrangements, and the resulting rent
increases, as necessary to permit the
eventual financing of new graduate
housing.
However, assuring an adequate
housing supply for graduate stu
dents remains a distant and perhaps
unattainable dream. Instead of pro
ceeding briskly and surely to plan
new graduate housing, the Univer
sity has proceeded all too slowly: a
report on new graduate housing re
mains incomplete after almost a year
of effort, and only in 1990 does the
preliminary capital budget forecast
include money for new housing.
More important, the University
has yet to make any firm commit
ment to the construction of new
graduate housing. If the current fi
nancial arrangements are to be de
fended to graduate students as lead
ing to the construction of such hous
ing, there must be an unequivocal
commitment from the highest levels
of the University administration that
,i substantial amount of new perma
nent graduate housing will be under
< onstruc tion no later than the end of
this decade, <ind that such housing
will !><> tinan< ed out of both graduate
.uhl undergraduate housing rates,
using approximately the same
criteria for a "fair" distribution of
costs as guided the work of the cur
rent lask Group. In our opinion, no
lesser statement can even remotely
begin to defend the current arrange
ments.
Meanwhile, the University retains
today, as it has for the past 25 years,
two student housing systems, sepa
rate and unequal. Promises of a bet
tei hut distant future which may
never arrive, and expressions of per
sonal sympathy and concern cannot
( orrect this. It is time for the leaders
of this great institution to publicly
commit themselves to meeting the
housing needs of the graduate com

munity. Until they do so we, as rep
resentatives of that community, can
not condone by our silence policies
which impose burdens on the
graduate student population without
providing fully compensating be
nefits.

Zapata's mural
A photo of the Zapata dining hall
mural appeared in the article "Minor
ity houses: awareness of segrega
tion" (Daily, Jan. 25). In the article,
comments on the mural focused on
what was referred to as a "faceless
white woman." Yet, no explanation
of the artist's meaning of the mural
was given in the article, even though
an explanation can be found to one
side of the painting.
Friday night, |an. 28, the Zapata
dining hall mural was defaced. The
front page headline read "Frosh de
face Zapata mural" (Daily, Feb. 1).
The "faceless white woman" was
shown disfigured by crude facial fea
tures. This article focused on the
"pranksters," gave the title of the
mural, "A Reaction to Violence and
Institutional Racism in the Media,"
but again, failed to give the explana
tion of the mural despite the fact that
a Zapata T A had referred a Daily
reporter to the explanation posted to
one side of the mural and had later
explained the meaning to the repor
ter over the telephone.
Perpetuating ignorance, or worse,
false beliefs is inexcusable for a
newspaper, especially when facts are
readily available. Therefore, we have
taken it upon ourselves to explain
the meaning the artist gave the mural
and also dispell.a myth about Zapata
house meetings. The dining hall
mural is a statement on the Media
exploitation of Latinos both in Latin
America and in the U.S. Multina
tional corporations advertise prod
ucts through the mass media that
propagate narrowly defined stan
dards or models for Latinos, and in
particular for Latina women, to fol
low. These American or European
standards are unobtainable for the
majority of the Latino population.
The phenomena perhaps can be
better understood by looking at the
portrayal of all women, regardless of
race, by the mass media. Women are
subjected to the "ideal-model-type"
throughout their lives with little
chance of obtaining it, and as a re
sult, often develop low self-esteems.
This important message is depicted
in the mural.
The red drops that streak across
the mural top represent the passing
of time, violence, and the life-cycle.
To the left, ayoung Latina is pictured.
She then enters a period of her life
where her identity is lost in images of
mannequins with blonde wigs pre
sented by the mass media. To the
right, the woman is seen in the last
stage of life, that of a self-assured old
age. The three images are not
different individuals but rather one
person passing through three phases
in her life.
The second issue of clarification
regards Zapata house meetings.
Contrary to an assumption that was
reported without question, Zapata
house meetings are not, nor have
they ever been, conducted in
Spanish.
As Zapata staff, we realize that
many misconceptions exist about
Zapata, theme houses in general and
other ethnic-related issues. We are
doing our best to dispell them; how
ever, we are limited in time, energy

and numbers. It is everyone's re
sponsibility, especially a newspa
per's, to seek out the truth or at least
obtain the facts.
It is with this understanding that
we view the third defacement of the
mural. The act itself is inexcusable.
Art is an expression and people have
a right to dislike it but not a right to
destroy it. Perhaps such "pranks" are
not malicious in intent; however,
their repetition should cause great
concern.

Backmasking
I am writing this letter in response
to Bryan Wildenthal's column (Daily,
Feb. 8) entitled "Arkansas has done it
again." Having lived in Arkansas for
24 years prior to enrolling in the
Graduate School of Business this
past fall, I felt obligated to come to
the defense of the Arkansas State
Legislature.
In Wildenthal's column he
criticizes the legislature for propos
ing a bill that would require warning
labels on records or tapes that con
tain subliminal suggestions. The bill
is the result of findings by Eagle Nest
— a California organization — that
has documented several cases of
backmasking on musical recordings.
Backmasking is recording a message
backwards so that the message is
"masked" or disguised. Some exam
ples of their findings on popular re
cordings follow:
Led Zeppelin, in everyone's favo
rite, "Stairway to Heaven:" "I sing
because I live with Satan ... I live for
Satan."
Styx in "Snowblind:" "Oh Satan
move in our voices."
Electric Light Orchestra (ELO)
from their album El Dorado: "You are
crazy. You are the nasty one. He's
there on the cross nailed and dead.
Yes oh serve me yet. Goodby, Christ
is dead. Sorry to see all to de
ath. . .
These suggestions are audible to
the conscious mind only when the
record is played back at slow speeds.
Under normal operating conditions
the message can not be heard by the
conscious mind. The bill before the
legislature contends that these
suggestions may pass directly into
the subconscious mind without first
being interpreted by the conscious
mind. This mental process has been
proven and has led to the ban of sub
liminal advertising by video (on tele
vision, at motion picture theaters,
etc.).
The bill would warn consumers
that they may be subjecting them
selves to subliminal suggestions. It
would place a warning on all sugges
tions whether the message be "I sing
because I live with Satan," "Coke Is
It" or "Jesus Saves." The bill leaves
the decision to purchase or not to
purchase with the consumer.
Wildenthal contends that this
warning label is a violation of the First
Amendment right of free speech.
Subliminal suggestion is n,ot speech.
It is an attempt (successful or not) to
influence the mind by aiming a mes
sage directly at the subconscious. It
is a form of brainwashing. The bill
educates the public of a potential
danger. There are some, Wildenthal
among them, that believe that indi
vidual liberty is enhanced if individu
als are forced to make their own de
cisions without all available informa
tion. I believe we have the right to
know when someone is trying to in
fluence our minds. I also believe that
a state legislature that has the cour
age to act to protect those rights de
serves a better fate than to be labeled
a "horse's posterior."

than for those of graduate students.
At a time when the unmet housing
needs of graduate students ex
ceeded those of undergraduates, the
University proceeded to build 800
new units of undergraduate housing
and, rather than asking those stu
dents eligible to live in them to pay
for the new housing, the University
chose to spread the burden over all
students living on-campus, including
graduate students.
The final rent increases, when they
are announced, will probably be
slightly below 14.5 percent in many
Escondido Village apartments. This is
because the Task Group on Housing
Kates found the current rents to be
higher than could be justified, so that
Escondido Village residents are cur
rently paying more than their "fair
share" of housing system costs (in
cluding the costs of the new under
graduate complex Governor's
Corner) even by the University's
standards.
Without part of the costs of Gov
ernor's Corner included in their rent,
graduate students would not be fac
ing rent increases of approximately
28 percent over the next two years.
We are of course aware that the Uni
versity defends the current financial
arrangements, and the resulting rent
increases, as necessary to permit the
eventual financing of new graduate
housing.
However, assuring an adequate
housing supply for graduate stu
dents remains a distant and perhaps
unattainable dream. Instead of pro
ceeding briskly and surely to plan
new graduate housing, the Univer
sity has proceeded all too slowly: a
report on new graduate housing re
mains incomplete after almost a year
of effort, and only in 1990 does the
preliminary capital budget forecast
include money for new housing.
More important, the University
has yet to make any firm commit
ment to the construction of new
graduate housing. If the current fi
nancial arrangements are to be de
fended to graduate students as lead
ing to the construction of such hous
ing, there must be an unequivocal
commitment from the highest levels
of the University administration that
,i substantial amount of new perma
nent graduate housing will be under
< onstruc tion no later than the end of
this decade, <ind that such housing
will !><> tinan< ed out of both graduate
.uhl undergraduate housing rates,
using approximately the same
criteria for a "fair" distribution of
costs as guided the work of the cur
rent lask Group. In our opinion, no
lesser statement can even remotely
begin to defend the current arrange
ments.
Meanwhile, the University retains
today, as it has for the past 25 years,
two student housing systems, sepa
rate and unequal. Promises of a bet
tei hut distant future which may
never arrive, and expressions of per
sonal sympathy and concern cannot

Zapata's mural
A photo of the Zapata dining hall
mural appeared in the article "Minor
ity houses: awareness of segrega
tion" (Daily, Jan. 25). In the article,
comments on the mural focused on
what was referred to as a "faceless
white woman." Yet, no explanation
of the artist's meaning of the mural
was given in the article, even though
an explanation can be found to one
side of the painting.
Friday night, |an. 28, the Zapata
dining hall mural was defaced. The
front page headline read "Frosh de
face Zapata mural" (Daily, Feb. 1).
The "faceless white woman" was
shown disfigured by crude facial fea
tures. This article focused on the
"pranksters," gave the title of the
mural, "A Reaction to Violence and
Institutional Racism in the Media,"
but again, failed to give the explana
tion of the mural despite the fact that
a Zapata T A had referred a Daily
reporter to the explanation posted to
one side of the mural and had later
explained the meaning to the repor
ter over the telephone.
Perpetuating ignorance, or worse,
false beliefs is inexcusable for a
newspaper, especially when facts are
readily available. Therefore, we have
taken it upon ourselves to explain
the meaning the artist gave the mural
and also dispell.a myth about Zapata
house meetings. The dining hall
mural is a statement on the Media
exploitation of Latinos both in Latin
America and in the U.S. Multina
tional corporations advertise prod
ucts through the mass media that
propagate narrowly defined stan
dards or models for Latinos, and in
particular for Latina women, to fol
low. These American or European
standards are unobtainable for the
majority of the Latino population.
The phenomena perhaps can be
better understood by looking at the
portrayal of all women, regardless of
race, by the mass media. Women are
subjected to the "ideal-model-type"
throughout their lives with little
chance of obtaining it, and as a re
sult, often develop low self-esteems.
This important message is depicted
in the mural.
The red drops that streak across
the mural top represent the passing
of time, violence, and the life-cycle.
To the left, ayoung Latina is pictured.
She then enters a period of her life
where her identity is lost in images of
mannequins with blonde wigs pre
sented by the mass media. To the
right, the woman is seen in the last
stage of life, that of a self-assured old
age. The three images are not
different individuals but rather one
person passing through three phases
in her life.
The second issue of clarification
regards Zapata house meetings.
Contrary to an assumption that was
reported without question, Zapata
house meetings are not, nor have
they ever been, conducted in
Spanish.
As Zapata staff, we realize that
many misconceptions exist about
Zapata, theme houses in general and
other ethnic-related issues. We are
doing our best to dispell them; how
ever, we are limited in time, energy

and numbers. It is everyone's re
sponsibility, especially a newspa
per's, to seek out the truth or at least
obtain the facts.
It is with this understanding that
we view the third defacement of the
mural. The act itself is inexcusable.
Art is an expression and people have
a right to dislike it but not a right to
destroy it. Perhaps such "pranks" are
not malicious in intent; however,
their repetition should cause great
concern.

Backmasking
I am writing this letter in response
to Bryan Wildenthal's column (Daily,
Feb. 8) entitled "Arkansas has done it
again." Having lived in Arkansas for
24 years prior to enrolling in the
Graduate School of Business this
past fall, I felt obligated to come to
the defense of the Arkansas State
Legislature.
In Wildenthal's column he
criticizes the legislature for propos
ing a bill that would require warning
labels on records or tapes that con
tain subliminal suggestions. The bill
is the result of findings by Eagle Nest
— a California organization — that
has documented several cases of
backmasking on musical recordings.
Backmasking is recording a message
backwards so that the message is
"masked" or disguised. Some exam
ples of their findings on popular re
cordings follow:
Led Zeppelin, in everyone's favo
rite, "Stairway to Heaven:" "I sing
because I live with Satan ... I live for
Satan."
Styx in "Snowblind:" "Oh Satan
move in our voices."
Electric Light Orchestra (ELO)
from their album El Dorado: "You are
crazy. You are the nasty one. He's
there on the cross nailed and dead.
Yes oh serve me yet. Goodby, Christ
is dead. Sorry to see all to de
ath. . .
These suggestions are audible to
the conscious mind only when the
record is played back at slow speeds.
Under normal operating conditions
the message can not be heard by the
conscious mind. The bill before the
legislature contends that these
suggestions may pass directly into
the subconscious mind without first
being interpreted by the conscious
mind. This mental process has been
proven and has led to the ban of sub
liminal advertising by video (on tele
vision, at motion picture theaters,
etc.).
The bill would warn consumers
that they may be subjecting them
selves to subliminal suggestions. It
would place a warning on all sugges
tions whether the message be "I sing
because I live with Satan," "Coke Is
It" or "Jesus Saves." The bill leaves
the decision to purchase or not to
purchase with the consumer.
Wildenthal contends that this
warning label is a violation of the First
Amendment right of free speech.
Subliminal suggestion is n,ot speech.
It is an attempt (successful or not) to
influence the mind by aiming a mes
sage directly at the subconscious. It
is a form of brainwashing. The bill
educates the public of a potential
danger. There are some, Wildenthal
among them, that believe that indi
vidual liberty is enhanced if individu
als are forced to make their own de
cisions without all available informa
tion. I believe we have the right to
know when someone is trying to in
fluence our minds. I also believe that
a state legislature that has the cour
age to act to protect those rights de
serves a better fate than to be labeled
a "horse's posterior."

Last Tuesday's announcement of
an average 14.5 percent rent increase
for on-campus housing in 1983-84 is
the latest manifestation of a set of
University policies which are unfair
and contrary to the best interests of
the University's graduate student
community. For the fourth straight
year, rents in graduate student hous
ing are increasing faster than can be
justified by increases in actual costs,
in order to help finance the construc
tion of new undergraduate housing.
We believe that the very idea that
graduate students living on-campus

rently paying more than their "fair
share" of housing system costs (in
cluding the costs of the new under
graduate complex Governor's
Corner) even by the University's
standards.
Without part of the costs of Gov
ernor's Corner included in their rent,
graduate students would not be fac
ing rent increases of approximately
28 percent over the next two years.
We are of course aware that the Uni
versity defends the current financial
arrangements, and the resulting rent
increases, as necessary to permit the
eventual financing of new graduate
housing.
However, assuring an adequate
housing supply for graduate stu
dents remains a distant and perhaps
unattainable dream. Instead of pro
ceeding briskly and surely to plan
new graduate housing, the Univer
sity has proceeded all too slowly: a
report on new graduate housing re
mains incomplete after almost a year
of effort, and only in 1990 does the
preliminary capital budget forecast
include money for new housing.
More important, the University
has yet to make any firm commit
ment to the construction of new
graduate housing. If the current fi
nancial arrangements are to be de
fended to graduate students as lead
ing to the construction of such hous
ing, there must be an unequivocal
commitment from the highest levels
of the University administration that
,i substantial amount of new perma
nent graduate housing will be under
< onstruc tion no later than the end of
this decade, <ind that such housing
will !><> tinan< ed out of both graduate
.uhl undergraduate housing rates,
using approximately the same
criteria for a "fair" distribution of
costs as guided the work of the cur
rent lask Group. In our opinion, no
lesser statement can even remotely
begin to defend the current arrange
ments.
Meanwhile, the University retains
today, as it has for the past 25 years,
two student housing systems, sepa
rate and unequal. Promises of a bet
tei hut distant future which may
never arrive, and expressions of per
sonal sympathy and concern cannot
( orrect this. It is time for the leaders
of this great institution to publicly
commit themselves to meeting the
housing needs of the graduate com

munity. Until they do so we, as rep
resentatives of that community, can
not condone by our silence policies
which impose burdens on the
graduate student population without
providing fully compensating be
nefits.

Zapata's mural
A photo of the Zapata dining hall
mural appeared in the article "Minor
ity houses: awareness of segrega
tion" (Daily, Jan. 25). In the article,
comments on the mural focused on
what was referred to as a "faceless
white woman." Yet, no explanation
of the artist's meaning of the mural
was given in the article, even though
an explanation can be found to one
side of the painting.
Friday night, |an. 28, the Zapata
dining hall mural was defaced. The
front page headline read "Frosh de
face Zapata mural" (Daily, Feb. 1).
The "faceless white woman" was
shown disfigured by crude facial fea
tures. This article focused on the
"pranksters," gave the title of the
mural, "A Reaction to Violence and
Institutional Racism in the Media,"
but again, failed to give the explana
tion of the mural despite the fact that
a Zapata T A had referred a Daily
reporter to the explanation posted to
one side of the mural and had later
explained the meaning to the repor
ter over the telephone.
Perpetuating ignorance, or worse,
false beliefs is inexcusable for a
newspaper, especially when facts are
readily available. Therefore, we have
taken it upon ourselves to explain
the meaning the artist gave the mural
and also dispell.a myth about Zapata
house meetings. The dining hall
mural is a statement on the Media
exploitation of Latinos both in Latin
America and in the U.S. Multina
tional corporations advertise prod
ucts through the mass media that
propagate narrowly defined stan
dards or models for Latinos, and in
particular for Latina women, to fol
low. These American or European
standards are unobtainable for the
majority of the Latino population.
The phenomena perhaps can be
better understood by looking at the
portrayal of all women, regardless of
race, by the mass media. Women are
subjected to the "ideal-model-type"
throughout their lives with little
chance of obtaining it, and as a re
sult, often develop low self-esteems.
This important message is depicted
in the mural.
The red drops that streak across
the mural top represent the passing
of time, violence, and the life-cycle.
To the left, ayoung Latina is pictured.
She then enters a period of her life
where her identity is lost in images of
mannequins with blonde wigs pre
sented by the mass media. To the
right, the woman is seen in the last
stage of life, that of a self-assured old
age. The three images are not
different individuals but rather one
person passing through three phases
in her life.
The second issue of clarification
regards Zapata house meetings.
Contrary to an assumption that was
reported without question, Zapata
house meetings are not, nor have
they ever been, conducted in
Spanish.
As Zapata staff, we realize that
many misconceptions exist about
Zapata, theme houses in general and
other ethnic-related issues. We are
doing our best to dispell them; how
ever, we are limited in time, energy

and numbers. It is everyone's re
sponsibility, especially a newspa
per's, to seek out the truth or at least
obtain the facts.
It is with this understanding that
we view the third defacement of the
mural. The act itself is inexcusable.
Art is an expression and people have
a right to dislike it but not a right to
destroy it. Perhaps such "pranks" are
not malicious in intent; however,
their repetition should cause great
concern.

Backmasking
I am writing this letter in response
to Bryan Wildenthal's column (Daily,
Feb. 8) entitled "Arkansas has done it
again." Having lived in Arkansas for
24 years prior to enrolling in the
Graduate School of Business this
past fall, I felt obligated to come to
the defense of the Arkansas State
Legislature.
In Wildenthal's column he
criticizes the legislature for propos
ing a bill that would require warning
labels on records or tapes that con
tain subliminal suggestions. The bill
is the result of findings by Eagle Nest
— a California organization — that
has documented several cases of
backmasking on musical recordings.
Backmasking is recording a message
backwards so that the message is
"masked" or disguised. Some exam
ples of their findings on popular re
cordings follow:
Led Zeppelin, in everyone's favo
rite, "Stairway to Heaven:" "I sing
because I live with Satan ... I live for
Satan."
Styx in "Snowblind:" "Oh Satan
move in our voices."
Electric Light Orchestra (ELO)
from their album El Dorado: "You are
crazy. You are the nasty one. He's
there on the cross nailed and dead.
Yes oh serve me yet. Goodby, Christ
is dead. Sorry to see all to de
ath. . .
These suggestions are audible to
the conscious mind only when the
record is played back at slow speeds.
Under normal operating conditions
the message can not be heard by the
conscious mind. The bill before the
legislature contends that these
suggestions may pass directly into
the subconscious mind without first
being interpreted by the conscious
mind. This mental process has been
proven and has led to the ban of sub
liminal advertising by video (on tele
vision, at motion picture theaters,
etc.).
The bill would warn consumers
that they may be subjecting them
selves to subliminal suggestions. It
would place a warning on all sugges
tions whether the message be "I sing
because I live with Satan," "Coke Is
It" or "Jesus Saves." The bill leaves
the decision to purchase or not to
purchase with the consumer.
Wildenthal contends that this
warning label is a violation of the First
Amendment right of free speech.
Subliminal suggestion is n,ot speech.
It is an attempt (successful or not) to
influence the mind by aiming a mes
sage directly at the subconscious. It
is a form of brainwashing. The bill
educates the public of a potential
danger. There are some, Wildenthal
among them, that believe that indi
vidual liberty is enhanced if individu
als are forced to make their own de
cisions without all available informa
tion. I believe we have the right to
know when someone is trying to in
fluence our minds. I also believe that
a state legislature that has the cour
age to act to protect those rights de
serves a better fate than to be labeled
a "horse's posterior."

Last Tuesday's announcement of
an average 14.5 percent rent increase
for on-campus housing in 1983-84 is
the latest manifestation of a set of
University policies which are unfair
and contrary to the best interests of
the University's graduate student
community. For the fourth straight
year, rents in graduate student hous
ing are increasing faster than can be
justified by increases in actual costs,
in order to help finance the construc
tion of new undergraduate housing.
We believe that the very idea that
graduate students living on-campus
should help to pay for new under
graduate housing is unfair, given the
University's decision to provide for
undergraduate housing needs rather
than for those of graduate students.
At a time when the unmet housing
needs of graduate students ex
ceeded those of undergraduates, the
University proceeded to build 800
new units of undergraduate housing
and, rather than asking those stu
dents eligible to live in them to pay
for the new housing, the University
chose to spread the burden over all
students living on-campus, including
graduate students.
The final rent increases, when they
are announced, will probably be
slightly below 14.5 percent in many
Escondido Village apartments. This is
because the Task Group on Housing
Kates found the current rents to be
higher than could be justified, so that
Escondido Village residents are cur
rently paying more than their "fair
share" of housing system costs (in
cluding the costs of the new under
graduate complex Governor's
Corner) even by the University's
standards.
Without part of the costs of Gov
ernor's Corner included in their rent,
graduate students would not be fac
