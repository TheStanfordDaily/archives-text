# Advice from adults abounds
## 
### 
There have been three times in my
life when adults have been willing to
talk to me. When I was 12 years old
and had just grown four inches in six
months, an adult would see me and
say, "You're really getting to be a big
one, aren't you kid?" My parents,
who were invariable standing nearby
smiling, would nod in agreement.
The second time adults were wil
ling to speak to me occurred when I
was a senior in high school. An adult
would say something like, "Going to
college already? I can't believe it. I
remember when you were just a little
kid with a dirty shirt and a runny
nose." My parents, who were still
standing nearby smiling, would
again nod in agreement.
This last summer, as I looked for
ward to my last year of college, I
found that adults were again willing
to talk with me. The discussions were
much more interesting this summer,
though, and I was able to make
categories for the different types of
advice I received.
First, there is the "be a profes
sional" advice. This comes from
businessmen. It comes with a serious
look on an adult's face and a firm
handshake. It usually goes some
thing like this: "There are too many
kids coming out of school today with
no direction. If you don't go to
graduate school, you don't have a
chance. It isn't like when I was a kid.
You have to specialize.
"But even if you do go to graduate
school, you're going to have trouble
getting a job. I know lawyers who are
still looking for work. And I know
other lawyers who are making 15
thousand a year. And what's that?
Nothing. You can't even live on that
much. Butifyou don'tgotograduate
school, you'll do even worse, so go
to graduate school.
"And don't go for that silly 'trip
to-Europe' business. My kids did it,
and it's a waste. You go to Europe,
and then you come back and all the
jobs are gone. You should be smart.
Go to medical school, find a nice girl,

become a doctor, and make your
parents happy. But even doctors
aren't making that much these days. I
have a friend who's a doctor and he's
only making2ogrand. You can't even
raise a family on that. I don't know
what to tell you to do. But just go to
graduate school. Make your parents
happy."
Then there is the advice that comes
from successful lawyers. I'm talking
about the ones who have offices on
Park Avenue in New York and on
Wilshire Boulevard in Beverly Hills. I
call it the "look at my tax statement"
advice. It goes like this: "The thing

. . If you don't go to graduate school, you don't
have a chance. It isn't like when I was a kid. You
have to specialize. But even if you do go to
graduate school, you're going to have trouble
getting a job. I know lawyers who are still
looking for work. And I know other lawyers who
are making 15 thousand a year. And what's that?
Nothing. You can't even live on that much.'

that is so great about this business,
kid, is that a jerk like mecanmakeso
much money in it. Come over here
kid. Look at my tax statement from
last year. Have you ever seen so
many zeros."
The next type of advice is that
which comes from a doctor. It goes
something like this: "lust make sure
you do what makes you happy, son.
That's what you'll do best in. Roll up
your sleeve, please, so I can take
your blood pressure. Yes, you have a
great future ahead of you. Try to
meet a nice girl. Cough twice and
stick out your tongue, please. Re
member, this is the last time you'll
make such an important decision.
Now take this glass and give me a
specimen please. If you want a rec
ommendation to medical school,
just give me a call." While the doc
tor's advice may seem like the best, it

may be that the doctor feels just like
the lawyer, but doesn't say the same
things because he has to practice
bedside manners.
Finally, there is what is definitely
the best advice of all. It comes at tin
end of the weekend, when youi
grandfather calls you into a roorr
away from all the nieces ant
nephews, and fathers and mothers
and tells you, "Son, I have $500 hen
for you. I want you to take this mone\
after you graduate from college, arte
spend it any way you want. You'ri
only young once. Don't forget that.'
That sums up the advice that I've

been receiving from adults during
this past summer, which is the last
summer that I'll be able to consider
myself a genuine kid. I still haven t
decided which advice to take, al
though I'll probably use my grand
father's gift to put off thinking about
it. When the money runs out, maybe
I'll just travel and collect more ad
vice. Then maybe I'll write a book
about advice to 21-year-olds. But I
should stay away from book writers it
I do that. A writer would undoubt
edly tell me something like, "If you
were smart, you'd go into business.
That's where the real money is." And
then I would talk to a businessman
and the whole cycle would happen
all over again.

are making 15 thousand a year. And what's that?
Nothing. You can't even live on that much.'

that is so great about this business,
kid, is that a jerk like mecanmakeso
much money in it. Come over here
kid. Look at my tax statement from
last year. Have you ever seen so
many zeros."
The next type of advice is that
which comes from a doctor. It goes
something like this: "lust make sure
you do what makes you happy, son.
That's what you'll do best in. Roll up
your sleeve, please, so I can take
your blood pressure. Yes, you have a
great future ahead of you. Try to
meet a nice girl. Cough twice and
stick out your tongue, please. Re
member, this is the last time you'll
make such an important decision.
Now take this glass and give me a
specimen please. If you want a rec
ommendation to medical school,
just give me a call." While the doc
tor's advice may seem like the best, it

may be that the doctor feels just like
the lawyer, but doesn't say the same
things because he has to practice
bedside manners.
Finally, there is what is definitely
the best advice of all. It comes at tin
end of the weekend, when youi
grandfather calls you into a roorr
away from all the nieces ant
nephews, and fathers and mothers
and tells you, "Son, I have $500 hen
for you. I want you to take this mone\
after you graduate from college, arte
spend it any way you want. You'ri
only young once. Don't forget that.'
That sums up the advice that I've

been receiving from adults during
this past summer, which is the last
summer that I'll be able to consider
myself a genuine kid. I still haven t
decided which advice to take, al
though I'll probably use my grand
father's gift to put off thinking about
it. When the money runs out, maybe
I'll just travel and collect more ad
vice. Then maybe I'll write a book
about advice to 21-year-olds. But I
should stay away from book writers it
I do that. A writer would undoubt
edly tell me something like, "If you
were smart, you'd go into business.
That's where the real money is." And
then I would talk to a businessman
and the whole cycle would happen
all over again.

A word from the Weiss

There have been three times in my
life when adults have been willing to
talk to me. When I was 12 years old
and had just grown four inches in six
months, an adult would see me and
say, "You're really getting to be a big
one, aren't you kid?" My parents,
who were invariable standing nearby
smiling, would nod in agreement.
The second time adults were wil
ling to speak to me occurred when I
was a senior in high school. An adult
would say something like, "Going to
college already? I can't believe it. I
remember when you were just a little
kid with a dirty shirt and a runny
nose." My parents, who were still
standing nearby smiling, would
again nod in agreement.
This last summer, as I looked for
ward to my last year of college, I
found that adults were again willing
to talk with me. The discussions were
much more interesting this summer,
though, and I was able to make
categories for the different types of
advice I received.
First, there is the "be a profes
sional" advice. This comes from
businessmen. It comes with a serious
look on an adult's face and a firm
handshake. It usually goes some
thing like this: "There are too many
kids coming out of school today with
no direction. If you don't go to
graduate school, you don't have a
chance. It isn't like when I was a kid.
You have to specialize.
"But even if you do go to graduate
school, you're going to have trouble
getting a job. I know lawyers who are
still looking for work. And I know
other lawyers who are making 15
thousand a year. And what's that?
Nothing. You can't even live on that
much. Butifyou don'tgotograduate
school, you'll do even worse, so go
to graduate school.
"And don't go for that silly 'trip
to-Europe' business. My kids did it,
and it's a waste. You go to Europe,
and then you come back and all the
jobs are gone. You should be smart.
Go to medical school, find a nice girl,

become a doctor, and make your
parents happy. But even doctors
aren't making that much these days. I
have a friend who's a doctor and he's
only making2ogrand. You can't even
raise a family on that. I don't know
what to tell you to do. But just go to
graduate school. Make your parents
happy."
Then there is the advice that comes
from successful lawyers. I'm talking
about the ones who have offices on
Park Avenue in New York and on
Wilshire Boulevard in Beverly Hills. I
call it the "look at my tax statement"
advice. It goes like this: "The thing
