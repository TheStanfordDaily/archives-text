# History professor criticizes University and U.S. politics
## 
### NANCY RAFF 
A self-declared "radical
about America and liberal
about education," History
I'rof. Barton Bernstein, a re
visionist historian, remains
one of the most controversial,
popular and intriguing profes
sors here.

He sees the role of
undergraduate
education as being
more intellectual
than pragmatic,
giving a general
education and
allowing graduate
school to train in a
specific area.

Attempting to challenge stu
dents' beliefs and previously
held views of American history
through widely diverse reading
lists and probing lectures,
Bernstein said he has "no de
sire to create disciples of his
students," but to instead get
them to view America from
another perspective.
In his "America Since 1945"
class the topical survey in
cludes controversial issues
concerning the Vietnam War,
Civil Rights and other major is
sues about which students care
deeply. This results, in Berns
tein's opinion, in the extreme
popularity of the class.
As well as being a critic of
national politics and the pre
sent administration, Berkstein
is also critical of the role that
politics play in the University.
Decisions as widely varied as
who receives grant money, the
hiring and promotion of pro
fessors, as well as the more
subtle basis of which values are
emphasized, are influenced by
University politics, Bernstein
said. This is reflected by the
fact that he received tenure
just last year, after teaching
here for 17 years. He said this
shows how he paid the price
for his political beliefs, actions
and other's perceptions of his
opinions. He said that politics
have played a role in the tenure
decision regarding Estelle
Free dm an. However, he
said,the decision was also
greatly influenced by the as
sessment of Freedman's book,

which he described as not
being a ''major or overwhelm
ing" work.
He would also like to see
universities do less defense re
search. He views this as un
likely because it would be per
ceived as a violation of
academic freedom, as well as
of the values held by many
trustees. Unlimited knowledge
may not be good, Bernstein
said. An important goal should
be to restrain certain harmful
knowledge, but the problem is
deciding which restraints
should be imposed as well as
who should impose them. The
allocation of funding effec
tively serves the purpose of
deciding which knowledge
gets furthered, with no moral
justification.
Concerning national de
fense, Bernstein said he
would "like to see disarma
ment, but that would require
the belief that life is better than
death, andachangein ideolog
ical beliefs about the Soviets,"
which he said is extremely un
likely. Instead, he would find a
substantial arms control satis
factory if it included a nuclear
test ban, an arms cutback of 10
percent and possibly removing
arms located in Europe. The
time to negotiate with the
Soviets is "not when the
United States has just con
cluded a series of nuclear
tests," he added.

get students away
from a policy of
ignorance to realize
that the U.S. has

things overseas/

Bernstein views today's Stan
ford students as being less
political and more concerned
with their careers, futures, and
private lives. The major prob
lems which concern them tend
to be the arms race and abor
tion rather than the larger is
sues of the 1960's such as war in
general and race relations,
Bernstein said. He said this re
sults from a sense of 'not know
ing where to go after the 1960s'
as well as factors such as un
employment and inflation
which make the choice of a
profession a major considera
tion.

He said that the 1960s raised
questions as to peoples' role in
society, gender/race relations,
the role and power of the fam
ily, the constitutionality of
government and ethical ques
tions of foreign policy. One of
the most important move
ments, he said, was the fact
that the personal suddenly be
came political, removingafeel
ing of isolation and unaccepta
bility from feelings of dissatis
faction.
Today he said he worries
about the trend toward prepro
fessionalism that he sees in
students, as well as a shift away
from liberal arts. He sees the
role of undergraduate educa

tion as being ideally more intel
lectual than programatic, giv
ing a general education and al
lowing graduate s< hool to train
in a specific area. He urges un
dergraduates to major in what
ever area interests them the
most. Pointing to his own ex
perience, he said that he took
only one class in American his
tory as an undergraduate at
Queen's College before at
tending graduate school at
Harvard and yet still became a
history professor. He strongly
supports the Western Cultures
Program because it gives all
students an opportunity to
have some experience in the
liberal arts, he s.iid.
Bernstein combines his

interest in history with an avid
interest in the effects of
technology. He teaches a

seminar entitled "Technology
in American Society," and is
active in the Values, Technol
ogy and Society Program and
the American Studies and In
ternational Relations depart-

said will divert funds from
less-glamourous, preventative

evaluated by the same group of

His other current projects

Oppenheimer, who was di
rector of the Los Alamos Labo
ratory, a book on the larger
origins of the Cold War and a
project on the Korean War. Al
though he has edited numer
ous volumes, these will be the
first full-length books that he
has written. He said that many
books would be more effective
as articles and that the time
spent cosmetically readying a
book for press could be better
spent investigating new and
different areas. During his
years at Stanford he estimates
that he has written 70 articles,
50 to 60 reviews, as well as de
livered 400 lectures outside of
classes. His time is aiso spent
on the editorial board of In
quiry, USA Today, Peace and
Change and Congress and the
Presidency.
Prof, lames Sheehan, choir
man of the history department,
described Bernstein as being
"unusual and admirable, with a

range of subjects that is re

variety of problems in foreign
policy, science and social
problems." Having a mastery

from 1975-80 for a Stockholm

fact that Bernstein "tries to get
students away from a"policy of
ignorance — to realize that the
United States has done many
bad things overseas." He said
that Bernstein's view reflects a
dominant viewpoint in Europe,
especially among the Liberals
and the Social Democrats.

Barton Bernstein
A self-declared "radical
about America and liberal
about education," History
I'rof. Barton Bernstein, a re
visionist historian, remains
one of the most controversial,
popular and intriguing profes
sors here.

He sees the role of
undergraduate
education as being
more intellectual
than pragmatic,
giving a general
education and
allowing graduate
school to train in a
specific area.

Attempting to challenge stu
dents' beliefs and previously
held views of American history
through widely diverse reading
lists and probing lectures,
Bernstein said he has "no de
sire to create disciples of his
students," but to instead get
them to view America from
another perspective.
In his "America Since 1945"
class the topical survey in
cludes controversial issues
concerning the Vietnam War,
Civil Rights and other major is
sues about which students care
deeply. This results, in Berns
tein's opinion, in the extreme
popularity of the class.
As well as being a critic of
national politics and the pre
sent administration, Berkstein
is also critical of the role that
politics play in the University.
Decisions as widely varied as
who receives grant money, the
hiring and promotion of pro
fessors, as well as the more
subtle basis of which values are
emphasized, are influenced by
University politics, Bernstein
said. This is reflected by the
fact that he received tenure
just last year, after teaching
here for 17 years. He said this
shows how he paid the price
for his political beliefs, actions
and other's perceptions of his
opinions. He said that politics
have played a role in the tenure
decision regarding Estelle
Free dm an. However, he
said,the decision was also
greatly influenced by the as
sessment of Freedman's book,

which he described as not
being a ''major or overwhelm
ing" work.
He would also like to see
universities do less defense re
search. He views this as un
likely because it would be per
ceived as a violation of
academic freedom, as well as
of the values held by many
trustees. Unlimited knowledge
may not be good, Bernstein
said. An important goal should
be to restrain certain harmful
knowledge, but the problem is
deciding which restraints
should be imposed as well as
who should impose them. The
allocation of funding effec
tively serves the purpose of
deciding which knowledge
gets furthered, with no moral
justification.
Concerning national de
fense, Bernstein said he
would "like to see disarma
ment, but that would require
the belief that life is better than
death, andachangein ideolog
ical beliefs about the Soviets,"
which he said is extremely un
likely. Instead, he would find a
substantial arms control satis
factory if it included a nuclear
test ban, an arms cutback of 10
percent and possibly removing
arms located in Europe. The
time to negotiate with the
Soviets is "not when the
United States has just con
cluded a series of nuclear
tests," he added.

range of subjects that is re
markable. He has examined a
variety of problems in foreign

popular lecture classes in the

fact that Bernstein "tries to get
students away from a"policy of
ignorance — to realize that the
United States has done many
bad things overseas." He said
that Bernstein's view reflects a
dominant viewpoint in Europe,
especially among the Liberals

the most popular and talked
about professors, with a repu
tation that extends throughout
Stanford and beyond.
