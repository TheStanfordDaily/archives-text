# Schmidt may visit Stanford
## 
### BILL AINSWORTH 
7he New York Times said this
week that former West German
Chancellor Helmut Schmidt is
planning to stay at the campus
home of Secretary of State George
Shultz for an extended visit dur
ing a scheduled trip to the United
States in mid-March.
However, a secretary in
Shultz's office, Shirley Deonne,
said there "was nothing like that
(Schmidt's visit) on the
schedule." Other offices within
the State Department also would
not confirm Schmidt's planned
visit.
Phillip Cailey, the author of the
Times article, told the Daily that
sources close to Schmidt
suggested his visit may last

"weeks, maybe months."
Schmidt, who became close
personal friends with Shultz when
the latter was serving as Secretary
of the Treasury under former Presi
dent Richard Nixon, has visited
Shult/ twice before at his campus
residence. Last summer Schmidt
stayed with Shultz in late July at the
same time that former Secretary of
State Henry Kissinger was visiting
Shultz.
According to sources close to
Schmidt, one of the main pur
poses of his stay at the Shultz
home will be to work on a book.
He will also be available to give
speeches through the Harry
Walker Agency, which handles
the speaking engagements of

other prominent figures such as
Kissinger and former Secretary of
State Alexander Haig.
Officials in the West German
embassy in Washington, D.C. also
refused to comment about the
former head of state's planned
visit to the United States, saying
that such a visit would be a matter
of private concern since Schmidt
is now a private citizen.
During Schmidt's and Kissing
er's visits with Shultz last summer.
the State Department and Secret
Service set up a security and in
formation center at a local Palo
Alto hotel.
Don Morris, regional security
officer for the State Department's
San Francisco office, said he >vas
unaware of the Schmidt visit and
that he was doubtful that his otfice
would have any security role in
such a visit.
"I'm sure he's not entitled to
any federal protection because
he's a private citizen," Morris
said. However, he added that on
some occasions his otfice is
asked to become involved in pro
viding security.
Shultz's son Alex, who lives in
the family's campus home, said he
was unaware of Schmidt's
planned visit, but added that hi
had not spoken to his father since
the Secretary of State's trip to
China.
Alex, who was here during
Schmidt's last visit over the sum
mer, said such visits are "really
exciting, but the thing you realize
is that they're just regular
people."
