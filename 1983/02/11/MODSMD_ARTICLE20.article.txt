# New center to aid innovators
## Entrepreneurs here forge new paths 
### STEVE PHILLIPS 
How would you like to be
the owner of a business at 20
years-old? You won't find this
job listing at the CPPC. The re
quirements are an innovative
idea, a willingness to work
hard and the desire to see
dreams come true.
Sound impossible? It's not.
For years, Stanford students
have been turning their skills,
from baking cookies to build
ing computers, into profitable
business ventures. In fact, as a
result of last spring's student
run Conference on Entrepre
neurship, the University has
provided funds for a Center for
Entrepreneurship.
With $500 grants from the
dean of graduate studies and
research, engineering and
business and the dedication of
several Stanford students, the

center was launched to pre
serve the spirit that prompted
last year's conference. "They
thought it would be worth
while to get some sort of a cen
ter together to help students
make contacts with entrepre
neurs in the community and
make contacts among them
selves," said David Gleba, a
junior in electrical engineering
and a member of the Student
Management Committee.
Gleba said the center offers a
"new perspective" on post
graduation employment. "In
stead of students asking when
they graduate, 'which com
pany will be waiting and have a
job for me?'. . . they're now
thinking, 'Well, gee, what can I
do innovative, creative and
maybe enjoy myself?' " Gleba
said entrepreneurship pro
vides special personal rewards.

"Entrepreneurship is a kind of
creative self-mastery," he said,
"It's being able to pursue ideas
that you have and also sort of
the idea of personal autonomy.

thing."
Stanford alumna Marcia
Hadeler is her own boss. Moti
vated by her love of baking

cookies and inspired by the
success of a cookie store in Los
Angeles, she and her sister,
Marlowe Savelle, founded
Cookie Habit in Stanford Shop
ping Center. A communica
tions major, Hadeler decided
between her sophomore and
junior years, in 1979, to open
her own shop. After two years
that involved submitting a pro
posal to the Shopping Center,
getting advice from Bank of
America about starting a small
business, preparing a profit
loss statement, securing vari
ous permits and obtaining an
architect, the store finally
opened in May of 1979.
Looking back, Hadeler said
she feels that the process of
getting established was "pretty
smooth." At the time, how
ever, trying to finish school
and start a business made the
day seem very short. "As the
store came closer and closer
together, it was real hard trying
to graduate, complete any in
completes and open the
store," she said. She was able
to juggle everything because
her "mom came up and took
over half my hours so I could
graduate."
Despite the problems,
Hadeler said she believes any
one can succeed on their own.
"If you have the determination
and the goal to see your
dreams true, you'll be able to
do it. There's no reason why
you shouldn't."
The determination of senior
John Halamka, a public policy
and medical microbiology
major, has enabled him to see a
number of his dreams come
true. Halamka founded, owns
and runs Colossus Computers.
Halamka said "I have to be
Colossus 24 hours a day."
At the same time, he is carry
ing 20 units. With a fascination
for putting things together that
dates back to his grade school
fondness for tinker toys,
Haiamka's knowledge of com
puters landed him a job writing
programs for TRW his sopho
more year in high school.
Here, he found parts from the

Silicon Valley "so readily avail
able and so cheap that (he) just
got involved with putting parts
together."
The combination of rising
Stanford tuition and the prof
itability of building computers
led to the formation of Colos
sus, "and computers started
going out of Manzanita
Park. . . where I lived with the
guys who put together the
M.B.A.s album," Halamka
said. Specializing in building
computers to order, Halamka
said he "tried to be like Burger
King. I made the computers
their way."
The introduction of the per
sonal computer into the mar
ketplace has forced Colossus
to switch its focus to writing
software for the new comput
ers. He said that this new em
phasis has turned out to be
"even more profitable" than
building computers.
Despite the success of Col
ossus, Halamka said he does
not intend to keep the com
pany together long after
graduation. While he has al
ready participated in a wide
panorama of activities from
writing programs for econon
mists Arthur Laffer and Milton
Friedman to being staff editor
for the Chaparral and former
provost Frederick Terman's
personal assistant, he still has
plans. He wants to go to
the medical school in the Med
ical Scientist Training Program
which yields a concurrent
M.D. â€” Ph.D., and then do re-

'If you have the
determination and
the goal to see your
dreams true, you'll
be able to do it/

search. "Besides," Halamka
said, "computers you can un
derstand. Vou can take apart a
computer and figure out how it
works. But the human body,
no one's quite done that."
Halamka said "the fact that

you're a student and 20 years
old is your biggest obstacle. . .
Once you've made yourself
legitimate and can really prove
that your product is a good
one, then your business really
takes off." To get established,
however, "is certainly not
easy. If they (Stanford stu
dents) want to commit the
time, the energy, the effort,
the complete frustration, the
headaches and the madness to
it, I think they can still suc
ceed."
Terman's idea of mixing
academics to provide theory
and industry to provide prac
tice enhances innovative think-

ing, Halamka said. "Bee ause >t
his work, that's why Stanford is
one of the best places in the
world to be involved in re
search."
Without question, the paths
of students have led in several
different directions. Many take
the well travelled road ot an
entry-level position in a big
name firm. Some, however,
hear a different calling, disre
gard th e sec u ri t y of wo rk ing for
an established firm, and gam
ble on themselves. With a litlk
luck and a lot of work, they may
one day be the big names. It
can happen. Ask Messrs. Hew
lett and Packard.
