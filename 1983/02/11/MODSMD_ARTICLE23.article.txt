## Take the bait at two seafood cafes Fanny's food sailing at half-mast 
### 
FANNY'S
9949 Edgewater Blvd.
Foster City
570-7444
One day, we got a letter here at the Daily
from somebody named "Fanny," inviting us
up to sample her fixins at a fish restaurant in
Foster City — the town that grew out of a
mound of landfill and seems like it should be
on the other side of the bay even though it
isn't.
Fver tearless, we decided to go in search of
the 82-year-old Fanny and her combination
fish market and restaurant.
Fanny is apparently quite an old gal (even
though the restaurant's manager acted like
she'd never heard of her). Fanny's youth was
spent trying to disguise herself as a man and
go to sea, according to a fascinating tale told
on a placemat. Then, she married a fisherman
after having opened a fish restaurant on San
Francisco's waterfront. Her love was lost at
sea and her restaurant closed.
"And all was just a dream, until her friends
constructed this replica of her old San Fran
cisco cafe at the location in Foster City."
Some dreams are better when they're just in
your mind, or in the case of Fanny's, just on
the chatty placemats, for dinner for two there
proved to be less than a return to the days of
old.
The place is now owned by former San
Francisco '49er Ted Connelly, we sub
sequently learned, after a call requesting
some background information revealed that
the place had gone through four managers
since October.
Upon entering the place, which is a combi
nation fish market/restaurant, you're not sure
whether you're supposed to buy your dinner
and take it to the kitchen to be cooked or
whether you should walk back outside and
find another entrance.
The squeamish are advised not to face the
iced squigglies and wigglies in the counter
case, as you may be tempted to turn right
around and opt for a batter-covered H. Salt
special, sans the guilt.
Or, on second thought, maybe you might as
well look at the squigglies and avoid the din
ner.
I'll go out on a limb and describe the decor
as reminiscent of a New York nouvelle cuisine
parlor (lily graphics, lots of track lighting,
woodwork, tables close together, somewhat
stark) but it just doesn't quite work. The tables
look great, until you rest your elbows on a
plastic cover; the track lights belong on a

sound set, not a dining room; the ceiling i'
painted that color you get in grammar si hoo
when you're trying to make purple out of ret
and blue poster paint.
Blah.
The manager asked us if we were the peopk
who had asked to sit near the window. W<
hadn't, specifically, but it might have beoi
nice, considering there were only about fou
other parties in the restaurant when we go
thereat 7p.m. (It was pretty mm h filled byB).
Still, it took 10 minutes to get a menu.
The wine list is good and relatively cheap
Ihe bread was cool and relatively stale. Tin
steamed clam appetizer ($6.99 for 1.1) w.i
wisked in; the clams looked bleached, in no
quite enough sauce. And it was wisked ,hv,i\
before we finished.
Our entrees were attractively presented, il
though the noodles looked better than the\
tasted in a bland butter sauce; the cottage
fries were adequate but unexceptional;
mayonaise dollop probably buzzed tin
mound of cole slaw but thought better <>
landing, giving it a watery, slushy taste.
The score was one and one when it came h
the main course — the fresh trout ($8.95) v\,i
quite nice, broiled with a crumb and buttor\
crisp crust. The scallops ($12.95) sufferer
somewhat from a strong, overpowering
sauce.

Some dreams are better when
they're just in your mind, or in
the ease of Fanny's, just on the
chatty placemats, for dinner fot
two there proved to be less than <i
return to the days of old.

Dessert was uninspired as well — a choco
late mousse and a piece of cappuchii:
cheesecake were too Sara Lee-esque.
The place seems to have potential but righ
now it's overpriced for the quality of food aru
it suffers from an overall lack of organization
and style. The photocopied menu betrays tin
as much as anything, not to mention wail <
and waitresses who ignore you during you
meal, then refill your coffee cup half a doz«n
times after the check arrives.
It may just take someotherold gal who tried
to go to sea to snap the place into shipshape,
but for now, our recommendation is against
going aboard.
