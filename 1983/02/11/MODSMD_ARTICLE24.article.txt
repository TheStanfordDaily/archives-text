It was a bit unfair to arrive at the Captain's
Cabin at 5:15 p.m., but still, we should not
have had to peek into the kitchen to get
someone to seat us. When the waiter
emerged, we were told we could sit any
where; fortunately, after getting settled, our
first impression was changed for the better.
The restaurant specializes in seafood and
the fish was overwhelmingly the best part of
the meal. A special, the broiled shark, was
fresh, tender and cooked exactly right. The
two nice-sized pieces were well worth the
$9.50, and the shrimp at $10.95, was competi
tive with comparable dishes at other restau
rants. The shrimp was billed as Mexican,
"laced with bacon, onion and bell pepper."
However, it seemed like your average scampi
shish-kabob.
Since it was a chilly evening, we opted for
soup, rather than one of several seafood
cocktails, louis or salads. The shrimp bisque
and New England clam chowder were good
— they had nice textures and contained
chunks of seafood — but were undeniably
flavored primarily with garlic. If you like soup
and don't mind garlic, you may want to con
sider getting soup to go, a feature offered by
the Captain's Cabin.
The half-loaf of sourdough bread accom
panying the soup and main course was warm
and delicious, complimenting the dry white
wine which was cool and intoxicating.
With the main course came a vegetable of
the day — tasty broccoli — and a baked
potato, potatoes au gratin or rice pilaf. The
foil-covered baked potato was not hard or
over-cooked as at many other restaurants,
and generous amounts of sour cream and
butter were provided.
The rice, however, was a disappointment.
It was not pilaf, just a sticky scoop of flavored
white rice next to the shrimp.

Slugging down wine and coffee, we or
dered cheesecake and pecan pie. The latter
was the "dessert du jour" and it was a tough
choice between that and the chocolate or
strawberry mousse.
The pie had a good crust, but the filling was
too watery — it lacked the molasses texture
of top quality pecan pie. The cheesecake was
a real disappointment, as it was reminiscent
of food service. (No offense, Maxine!) It had
no real cheese taste and seemed to be com
prised of cheap-grade cream cheese and
sugar.
Our meal at the Captain's Cabin was noth
ing to rave about. But the restaurant did offer
some of the best fish to be found close to
campus. The waiter was pleasant and the ser
vice, superb when we first arrived and there
was only one other party at the restaurant,
remained good throughout the meal.
The menu offers a wide variety of seafood
delicacies, grilled, deep-fried or mesquite
wood charcoal-broiled. Several dishes
labeled "Captain's Favorites" sound particu
larly good.
For non-fish eaters, the menu also lists
chicken-kabob for $7.95, and New York steak
and butterflied filet mignon, both at $13.95. If
you are really hungry or feel rich, you might
opt for the combination plates with filet mig
non and Alaskan king crab legs or Australian
lobster tails, both at $18.50.
The ambience at Captain's Cabin reminded
us of a typical harborfront restaurant.
Fishnets, cork buoys and Japanese net
weights decorated the medium-sized dining
room. These things were not offensive, but
the fact that each table had a view of the
kitchen through the wide-open doorway was
disturbing.
But still, there is not very much fresh,
well-prepared seafood in the area — so if
you're looking for it, it's at the Captain's Ca
bin.
