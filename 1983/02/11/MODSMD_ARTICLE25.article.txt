—lean Cocteau
l.es Parents Terribles (1949)
★
Cubberley I heater, 4000 Mid
dlefield Rd., Palo Alto
Jean Cocteau's play (usually
titled Intimate Relations in Eng
lish translation) bears some re
semblance to the smart drawing
room comedies of the '20s and
early '30s, but the characters are
true originals and the
astonishing dialogue uncovers
layer beneath ironic layer. He
diiected the film version, and
it's a masterpiece. (Shot by
Michel Kelber, it doesn't look
like filmed theater, either.) Jean
Marais plays the hero, who
deserts his crazy, suffocating
family (Yvonne de Bray and
Marcel Andre are his parents,
Gabrielle Dorziat his aunt) for a
young woman (Josette Day).
I he acting is uniformly brilliant.
Plays Wednesday evening.
Oliver! (1968) ★
Kresge Auditorium
A great movie musical. In
adapting the hit Lionel Bart
show, screenwriter Vernon
Harris wisely returned to
Dickens: the dialogue is right
out of Oliver Twist. And the di
rector, Carol Reed, somehow
managed to capture both the
Dickensian spiiit and the es
sence of musical comedy;
when you think of how many
wrong turns the movie could
have made, the results seem mi
raculous. (Just compare it to
most of the big-budget musi
cals Hollywood was putting out
in the same era.) The magnif
icent cast features Ron Moody
as Fagin, Oliver Reed as Bill
Sykes, Shani Wallis as Nancy,
Harry Secombe as Mr. Bumble,
Mark Lester as Oliver, and Jack
Wild as the Artful Dodger;
Onna White did the spectacular
choreography and John Box the
lovely designs. This deserving
popular success, probably
Carol Reed's best movie after
The Third Man, was also his last
blaze of glory; though he lived
until 1976, he never again rose
to such heights.
Plays tonight.

THX 1138 (1970)
Kresge Auditorium
George Lucas directed this
science fiction fantasy before
American Graffiti had made
him famous. (As an in-joke, he
stuck a license plate reading
"TUX 138" on one of the cars in
American Graffiti) The plot,
about a rebellious citizen in an
emotionless society, is a vari
ation 0n1984 There is definitely
talent in this movie, but it's so
single-minded and humorless,
and the photography (by Dave
Meyers and Albert Kihn) is so
glaringly white-on-white, that
you may feel physically uncom
fortable watching it. Written by
Lucas and Walter Murch; star
ring Robert Duvall, Donald
Pleasance, Pedro Colley, Mag
gie McOmie and lan Wolfe.
Plays tomorrow evening.
The African Queen (1951)
Bishop Auditorium ★
John Huston's comedy-ad
venture, set in Africa in 1914,
stars Katharine Hepburn and
Humphrey Bogart as the most
outlandish romantic couple im
aginable: a prim missionary and
a tippling tugboat captain. Per
haps no one could have
guessed how beautifully they'd
work together — both give clas
sic comic performances. This
marvelous film has a screenplay
by James Agee, John Collier
and Huston, out of a C.S. For
ester novel, and Jack Cardiff
shot it; in a small but memo
rable appearance, Robert
Morley plays Hepburn's
brother. Not to be missed.
Plays tonight.
Hiroshima Mon Amour
(1959)
Kresge Auditorium
A French woman tells her
Japanese lover all that she has
seen in Hiroshima — the
museums, the monuments to
the 1945 atrocities — and he re
plies, repeatedly and in an un
varying monotone, "You
haven't seen anything in
Hiroshima. You haven't seen
anything." Watching this pic
ture is about as interesting as lis
tening to an hour and a half of

traffic noises — except that the
dialogue has considerably loss
vitality than traffic. Alain
Kesnais directed, Marguerite
Duras wrote the screenplay,
and Emmanuelle Riva gives a
remarkably modulated per
formance — all things con
sidered — as the woman.
Plays Monday evening.
The Harder They Come
(1973) *
Terman Auditorium
This Jamaican picture should
have made reggae singer Jimmy
Cliff a movie star: in his leopard
shirt, shimmering black vest,
white cap and shades, he gives
rock decadence an irresistibly
seductive veneer. During the*
first half, the director, Perry
Henzell, and his co-writer,
Trevor D. Rhone, want to show
us how pop music and violence
are connected, but they can't
even manage to tell the plot
straight; the much cleverer sec
ond half spinsout amusing vari
ations on the joke from Bonnie
and Clyde about the celebrity
of underworld figures. (When
Cliff hits the "most wanted" list,
his single climbs to the top of
the charts.) Even when the film
making is unintelligible, how
ever, Cliff and the music save it:
Henzell is smart enough to let
the movie pick up the infec
tious rhythms of the score
(which is one of the best ever
heard in a film).
Plays tomorrow evening.
Fiddler on the Roof (1971)
New Varsity, Palo Alto ★
Norman Jewison made this
magnificent film of the long
running Broadway musical by
Joseph Stein, Jerry Bock and
Sheldon Harnick, from Stein's
screenplay. The setting is a
small village in Russia during
the time of the anti-Jewish po
groms; the protagonist, Tevyne
(wonderfully played by the Is
raeli actor Topol), is struggling
to hold onto the traditions of
his people while the modern
world insists on eating away at
them. Not all of Jewison's de
cisions were the ideal ones —
there are some irritating, literal

minded momeni and he
should never hav< ,ist Molly
Picon as Yente the matchmaker
— but the most imp. -r 'ant ones
come pretty close. With Norma
Crane as Golde, Leonard frey as
Motel Kamzoil, Haul vlann as
Lazar Wolf, Rosalind Harris as
Tzeitel, Michele Marsh as
Model and Neva Small as
Chava; shot by Osv. Id Morris;
Isaac Stern plays the violin
theme; Tom Abbott adapted
Jerome Robbins choreo
graphy. (N. 8.: 32 minutes have
been hacked off the original re
lease prints.)
Plays Sunday with Came/of.

Luther (1974)
Lagunita & Larkin Dining
Rooms
John Osborne's play takes
Etfkson's famous psychological
study of Martin Luther (Young
Man Luther) to an absurd
degree: Luther's constipation is
seen as the force behind all his
actions. Guy Green filmed this
grim, prolix stage piece pretty
much froin third row center,
and that vigorous, hollow actor
Stacy Keach plays the title role,
it's hard to know which is the
greater irritant: the dialogue or
keach's performance. With Pa
trick Magee (acting with his
eyes in the manner of a bad si
• i nt <creeri villain). Hugh Grif
fith, Robert Stephens, Alan
Bad el and Judi Dench.
Plays Monday (Lagunita) and
V\ fdnesday (Lark in).

A Midsummer Sex
Comedy
Memorial Auditorium
In a bucolic setting, Woody
Allen and hi<- sexually reticent
wife, Mary Steenburgen, gather
together a small party of friends
a pompous professor (Jose
Ferrer), his fiancee (Mia Far
row), a randy physician (Tony
Roberts), and a delectably sexy
nurse (Julie Flagerty). Woody
Allen's comedy evokes
Shakespeare, Chekhov, Renoir
and (especially) Ingmar
Bergman, but it's a difficult
movie to get a handle on — it's
neither serious nor parodistic,
neither period nor contem
porary. Bi/airely ill-at-ease, it's
a sex farce for anhedonics.
Plays Sunday evening.

The Third Man (1950) *
Fox, Redwood City
Graham Greene laid his su
perb screenplay in post-war Vi
enna, divided into British,
French, American and Russian
zones. Poor Viennese struggle
for black market goods — in
cluding passports — and ludi
crous attempts are made to re
capture the lyrical innocence of
the mythic, Strauss-drenched
pre-war city. The themes are
identity, responsibility and dis
enchantment: Holly Martins
(joseph Cotten), a writer of
tawdry westerns, comes to Vi
enna to work for his boyhood
chum, Harry Lime (Orson
Welles), and finds he has ar
rived just in time for his funeral.
From Inspector Calloway
(Trevor Howard), who is in
vestigating Lime's death, Holly
learns that Lime was more and
less than he had imagined.
(Greene gives the David Cop
perfield-Steerforth story a new
twist here.) The four central
performances (Alida Valli plays
Lime's mistress Anna) are im
peccable — and Welles makes
what is likely the most sensa
tional (and most ingeniously
prepared for) entrance in mov
ies. Carol Reed's masterly direc
tion draws heavily on German
Expressionist techniques.
Plays tomorrow and Monday
with Citizen Kane.
A Night at the Opera (1935)
Festival, Palo Alto ★
The Marx Brothers moved
from Paramount to M-G-M
with this movie; they lost Zep
po but they gained the dubious
distinction of having Irving
Thalberg supervise the produc

George Kaufman-Morrie
Ryskind script with musical in

shooting, ihe Marxes Override
this preposterous intrusion, of

Directed by Sam Wood, and co
starring Margaret Dumont, Sig

Cubberley I heater, 4000 Mid
dlefield Rd., Palo Alto
Jean Cocteau's play (usually
titled Intimate Relations in Eng
lish translation) bears some re
semblance to the smart drawing
room comedies of the '20s and
early '30s, but the characters are
true originals and the
astonishing dialogue uncovers
layer beneath ironic layer. He
diiected the film version, and
it's a masterpiece. (Shot by
Michel Kelber, it doesn't look
like filmed theater, either.) Jean
Marais plays the hero, who
deserts his crazy, suffocating
family (Yvonne de Bray and
Marcel Andre are his parents,
Gabrielle Dorziat his aunt) for a
young woman (Josette Day).
I he acting is uniformly brilliant.
Plays Wednesday evening.
Oliver! (1968) ★
Kresge Auditorium
A great movie musical. In
adapting the hit Lionel Bart
show, screenwriter Vernon
Harris wisely returned to
Dickens: the dialogue is right
out of Oliver Twist. And the di
rector, Carol Reed, somehow
managed to capture both the
Dickensian spiiit and the es
sence of musical comedy;
when you think of how many
wrong turns the movie could
have made, the results seem mi
raculous. (Just compare it to
most of the big-budget musi
cals Hollywood was putting out
in the same era.) The magnif
icent cast features Ron Moody
as Fagin, Oliver Reed as Bill
Sykes, Shani Wallis as Nancy,
Harry Secombe as Mr. Bumble,
Mark Lester as Oliver, and Jack
Wild as the Artful Dodger;
Onna White did the spectacular
choreography and John Box the
lovely designs. This deserving
popular success, probably
Carol Reed's best movie after
The Third Man, was also his last
blaze of glory; though he lived
until 1976, he never again rose
to such heights.
Plays tonight.

THX 1138 (1970)
Kresge Auditorium
George Lucas directed this
science fiction fantasy before
American Graffiti had made
him famous. (As an in-joke, he
stuck a license plate reading
"TUX 138" on one of the cars in
American Graffiti) The plot,
about a rebellious citizen in an
emotionless society, is a vari
ation 0n1984 There is definitely
talent in this movie, but it's so
single-minded and humorless,
and the photography (by Dave
Meyers and Albert Kihn) is so
glaringly white-on-white, that
you may feel physically uncom
fortable watching it. Written by
Lucas and Walter Murch; star
ring Robert Duvall, Donald
Pleasance, Pedro Colley, Mag
gie McOmie and lan Wolfe.
Plays tomorrow evening.
The African Queen (1951)
Bishop Auditorium ★
John Huston's comedy-ad
venture, set in Africa in 1914,
stars Katharine Hepburn and
Humphrey Bogart as the most
outlandish romantic couple im
aginable: a prim missionary and
a tippling tugboat captain. Per
haps no one could have
guessed how beautifully they'd
work together — both give clas
sic comic performances. This
marvelous film has a screenplay
by James Agee, John Collier
and Huston, out of a C.S. For
ester novel, and Jack Cardiff
shot it; in a small but memo
rable appearance, Robert
Morley plays Hepburn's
brother. Not to be missed.
Plays tonight.
Hiroshima Mon Amour
(1959)
Kresge Auditorium
A French woman tells her
Japanese lover all that she has
seen in Hiroshima — the
museums, the monuments to
the 1945 atrocities — and he re
plies, repeatedly and in an un
varying monotone, "You
haven't seen anything in
Hiroshima. You haven't seen
anything." Watching this pic
ture is about as interesting as lis
tening to an hour and a half of

traffic noises — except that the
dialogue has considerably loss
vitality than traffic. Alain
Kesnais directed, Marguerite
Duras wrote the screenplay,
and Emmanuelle Riva gives a
remarkably modulated per
formance — all things con
sidered — as the woman.
Plays Monday evening.
The Harder They Come
(1973) *
Terman Auditorium
This Jamaican picture should
have made reggae singer Jimmy
Cliff a movie star: in his leopard
shirt, shimmering black vest,
white cap and shades, he gives
rock decadence an irresistibly
seductive veneer. During the*
first half, the director, Perry
Henzell, and his co-writer,
Trevor D. Rhone, want to show
us how pop music and violence
are connected, but they can't
even manage to tell the plot
straight; the much cleverer sec
ond half spinsout amusing vari
ations on the joke from Bonnie
and Clyde about the celebrity
of underworld figures. (When
Cliff hits the "most wanted" list,
his single climbs to the top of
the charts.) Even when the film
making is unintelligible, how
ever, Cliff and the music save it:
Henzell is smart enough to let
the movie pick up the infec
tious rhythms of the score
(which is one of the best ever
heard in a film).
Plays tomorrow evening.
Fiddler on the Roof (1971)
New Varsity, Palo Alto ★
Norman Jewison made this
magnificent film of the long
running Broadway musical by
Joseph Stein, Jerry Bock and
Sheldon Harnick, from Stein's
screenplay. The setting is a
small village in Russia during
the time of the anti-Jewish po
groms; the protagonist, Tevyne
(wonderfully played by the Is
raeli actor Topol), is struggling
to hold onto the traditions of
his people while the modern
world insists on eating away at
them. Not all of Jewison's de
cisions were the ideal ones —
there are some irritating, literal

minded momeni and he
should never hav< ,ist Molly
Picon as Yente the matchmaker
— but the most imp. -r 'ant ones
come pretty close. With Norma
Crane as Golde, Leonard frey as
Motel Kamzoil, Haul vlann as
Lazar Wolf, Rosalind Harris as
Tzeitel, Michele Marsh as
Model and Neva Small as
Chava; shot by Osv. Id Morris;
Isaac Stern plays the violin
theme; Tom Abbott adapted
Jerome Robbins choreo
graphy. (N. 8.: 32 minutes have
been hacked off the original re
lease prints.)
Plays Sunday with Came/of.

Luther (1974)
Lagunita & Larkin Dining
Rooms
John Osborne's play takes
Etfkson's famous psychological
study of Martin Luther (Young
Man Luther) to an absurd
degree: Luther's constipation is
seen as the force behind all his
actions. Guy Green filmed this
grim, prolix stage piece pretty
much froin third row center,
and that vigorous, hollow actor
Stacy Keach plays the title role,
it's hard to know which is the
greater irritant: the dialogue or
keach's performance. With Pa

Memorial Auditorium
In a bucolic setting, Woody

together a small party of friends
a pompous professor (Jose

Roberts), and a delectably sexy
nurse (Julie Flagerty). Woody
Allen's comedy evokes
Shakespeare, Chekhov, Renoir
and (especially) Ingmar
Bergman, but it's a difficult
movie to get a handle on — it's
neither serious nor parodistic,
neither period nor contem

a sex farce for anhedonics.

The Third Man (1950) *
Fox, Redwood City
Graham Greene laid his su
perb screenplay in post-war Vi
enna, divided into British,
French, American and Russian
zones. Poor Viennese struggle
for black market goods — in
cluding passports — and ludi
crous attempts are made to re
capture the lyrical innocence of
the mythic, Strauss-drenched
pre-war city. The themes are
identity, responsibility and dis
enchantment: Holly Martins
(joseph Cotten), a writer of
tawdry westerns, comes to Vi
enna to work for his boyhood
chum, Harry Lime (Orson
Welles), and finds he has ar
rived just in time for his funeral.
From Inspector Calloway
(Trevor Howard), who is in
vestigating Lime's death, Holly
learns that Lime was more and
less than he had imagined.
(Greene gives the David Cop
perfield-Steerforth story a new
twist here.) The four central
performances (Alida Valli plays
Lime's mistress Anna) are im
peccable — and Welles makes
what is likely the most sensa
tional (and most ingeniously
prepared for) entrance in mov
ies. Carol Reed's masterly direc
tion draws heavily on German
Expressionist techniques.

l.es Parents Terribles (1949)
★
Cubberley I heater, 4000 Mid
dlefield Rd., Palo Alto
Jean Cocteau's play (usually
titled Intimate Relations in Eng
lish translation) bears some re
semblance to the smart drawing
room comedies of the '20s and
early '30s, but the characters are
true originals and the
astonishing dialogue uncovers
layer beneath ironic layer. He
diiected the film version, and
it's a masterpiece. (Shot by
Michel Kelber, it doesn't look
like filmed theater, either.) Jean
Marais plays the hero, who
deserts his crazy, suffocating
family (Yvonne de Bray and
Marcel Andre are his parents,
Gabrielle Dorziat his aunt) for a
young woman (Josette Day).
I he acting is uniformly brilliant.
Plays Wednesday evening.
Oliver! (1968) ★
Kresge Auditorium
A great movie musical. In
adapting the hit Lionel Bart
show, screenwriter Vernon
Harris wisely returned to
Dickens: the dialogue is right
out of Oliver Twist. And the di
rector, Carol Reed, somehow
managed to capture both the
Dickensian spiiit and the es
sence of musical comedy;
when you think of how many
wrong turns the movie could
have made, the results seem mi
raculous. (Just compare it to
most of the big-budget musi
cals Hollywood was putting out
in the same era.) The magnif
icent cast features Ron Moody
as Fagin, Oliver Reed as Bill
Sykes, Shani Wallis as Nancy,
Harry Secombe as Mr. Bumble,
Mark Lester as Oliver, and Jack
Wild as the Artful Dodger;
Onna White did the spectacular
choreography and John Box the
lovely designs. This deserving
popular success, probably
Carol Reed's best movie after
The Third Man, was also his last
blaze of glory; though he lived
until 1976, he never again rose
to such heights.
Plays tonight.

THX 1138 (1970)
Kresge Auditorium
George Lucas directed this
science fiction fantasy before
American Graffiti had made
him famous. (As an in-joke, he
stuck a license plate reading
"TUX 138" on one of the cars in
American Graffiti) The plot,
about a rebellious citizen in an
emotionless society, is a vari
ation 0n1984 There is definitely
talent in this movie, but it's so
single-minded and humorless,
and the photography (by Dave
Meyers and Albert Kihn) is so
glaringly white-on-white, that
you may feel physically uncom
fortable watching it. Written by
Lucas and Walter Murch; star
ring Robert Duvall, Donald
Pleasance, Pedro Colley, Mag
gie McOmie and lan Wolfe.
Plays tomorrow evening.
The African Queen (1951)
Bishop Auditorium ★
John Huston's comedy-ad
venture, set in Africa in 1914,
stars Katharine Hepburn and
Humphrey Bogart as the most
outlandish romantic couple im
aginable: a prim missionary and
a tippling tugboat captain. Per
haps no one could have
guessed how beautifully they'd
work together — both give clas
sic comic performances. This
marvelous film has a screenplay
by James Agee, John Collier
and Huston, out of a C.S. For
ester novel, and Jack Cardiff
shot it; in a small but memo
rable appearance, Robert
Morley plays Hepburn's
brother. Not to be missed.
Plays tonight.
Hiroshima Mon Amour
(1959)
Kresge Auditorium
A French woman tells her
Japanese lover all that she has
seen in Hiroshima — the
museums, the monuments to
the 1945 atrocities — and he re
plies, repeatedly and in an un
varying monotone, "You
haven't seen anything in
Hiroshima. You haven't seen
anything." Watching this pic
ture is about as interesting as lis
tening to an hour and a half of

traffic noises — except that the
dialogue has considerably loss
vitality than traffic. Alain
Kesnais directed, Marguerite
Duras wrote the screenplay,
and Emmanuelle Riva gives a
remarkably modulated per
formance — all things con
sidered — as the woman.
Plays Monday evening.
The Harder They Come
(1973) *
Terman Auditorium
This Jamaican picture should
have made reggae singer Jimmy
Cliff a movie star: in his leopard
shirt, shimmering black vest,
white cap and shades, he gives
rock decadence an irresistibly
seductive veneer. During the*
first half, the director, Perry
Henzell, and his co-writer,
Trevor D. Rhone, want to show
us how pop music and violence
are connected, but they can't
even manage to tell the plot
straight; the much cleverer sec
ond half spinsout amusing vari
ations on the joke from Bonnie
and Clyde about the celebrity
of underworld figures. (When
Cliff hits the "most wanted" list,
his single climbs to the top of
the charts.) Even when the film
making is unintelligible, how
ever, Cliff and the music save it:
Henzell is smart enough to let
the movie pick up the infec
tious rhythms of the score
(which is one of the best ever
heard in a film).
Plays tomorrow evening.
Fiddler on the Roof (1971)
New Varsity, Palo Alto ★
Norman Jewison made this
magnificent film of the long
running Broadway musical by
Joseph Stein, Jerry Bock and
Sheldon Harnick, from Stein's
screenplay. The setting is a
small village in Russia during
the time of the anti-Jewish po
groms; the protagonist, Tevyne
(wonderfully played by the Is
raeli actor Topol), is struggling
to hold onto the traditions of
his people while the modern
world insists on eating away at
them. Not all of Jewison's de
cisions were the ideal ones —
there are some irritating, literal

minded momeni and he
should never hav< ,ist Molly
Picon as Yente the matchmaker
— but the most imp. -r 'ant ones
come pretty close. With Norma
Crane as Golde, Leonard frey as
Motel Kamzoil, Haul vlann as
Lazar Wolf, Rosalind Harris as
Tzeitel, Michele Marsh as
Model and Neva Small as
Chava; shot by Osv. Id Morris;
Isaac Stern plays the violin
theme; Tom Abbott adapted
Jerome Robbins choreo
graphy. (N. 8.: 32 minutes have
been hacked off the original re
lease prints.)
Plays Sunday with Came/of.
★ Highly recommended

Luther (1974)
Lagunita & Larkin Dining
Rooms
John Osborne's play takes
Etfkson's famous psychological
study of Martin Luther (Young
Man Luther) to an absurd
degree: Luther's constipation is
seen as the force behind all his
actions. Guy Green filmed this
grim, prolix stage piece pretty
much froin third row center,
and that vigorous, hollow actor
Stacy Keach plays the title role,
it's hard to know which is the
greater irritant: the dialogue or
keach's performance. With Pa
trick Magee (acting with his
eyes in the manner of a bad si
• i nt <creeri villain). Hugh Grif
fith, Robert Stephens, Alan
Bad el and Judi Dench.
Plays Monday (Lagunita) and
V\ fdnesday (Lark in).

A Midsummer Sex
Comedy
Memorial Auditorium
In a bucolic setting, Woody
Allen and hi<- sexually reticent
wife, Mary Steenburgen, gather
together a small party of friends
a pompous professor (Jose
Ferrer), his fiancee (Mia Far
row), a randy physician (Tony
Roberts), and a delectably sexy
nurse (Julie Flagerty). Woody
Allen's comedy evokes
Shakespeare, Chekhov, Renoir
and (especially) Ingmar
Bergman, but it's a difficult
movie to get a handle on — it's
neither serious nor parodistic,
neither period nor contem
porary. Bi/airely ill-at-ease, it's
a sex farce for anhedonics.
Plays Sunday evening.

The Third Man (1950) *
Fox, Redwood City
Graham Greene laid his su
perb screenplay in post-war Vi
enna, divided into British,
French, American and Russian
zones. Poor Viennese struggle
for black market goods — in
cluding passports — and ludi
crous attempts are made to re
capture the lyrical innocence of
the mythic, Strauss-drenched
pre-war city. The themes are
identity, responsibility and dis
enchantment: Holly Martins
(joseph Cotten), a writer of
tawdry westerns, comes to Vi
enna to work for his boyhood
chum, Harry Lime (Orson
Welles), and finds he has ar
rived just in time for his funeral.
From Inspector Calloway
(Trevor Howard), who is in
vestigating Lime's death, Holly
learns that Lime was more and
less than he had imagined.
(Greene gives the David Cop
perfield-Steerforth story a new
twist here.) The four central
performances (Alida Valli plays
Lime's mistress Anna) are im
peccable — and Welles makes
what is likely the most sensa
tional (and most ingeniously
prepared for) entrance in mov
ies. Carol Reed's masterly direc
tion draws heavily on German
Expressionist techniques.
Plays tomorrow and Monday
with Citizen Kane.
