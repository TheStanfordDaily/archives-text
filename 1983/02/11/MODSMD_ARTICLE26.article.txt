# Proposed golf course threatens rare habitat, species
## 
### JULIANN ANDERSON 
Gold course nature trails or both? Ihe
development Edgewood Park is pitting
environmentalists — uic luding some Stan
ford biologists against the County of
San Mateo, which owns the site. The park
itselt is 4b7 acres of gentle hills, just off
Highway 280 in Woodside and about IS
minutes from campus.
One of the last remaining serpentine
grassland on the West Coast grows at the
park. This grassland is inhabited by the Bay
Checkerspot butterfly, a candidate for the
national endangered species list. How
ever, a 150-iii re golf course approved by
the San Matt > Board of Supervisors may
eliminate 30 percent of the serpentine
grassland.
In response to the development plan,
the California Native Plant Society filed a
lawsuit on km 14, asking that San Mateo
County set aside its acceptance of the mas
ter plan and the Environmental Impact Re
port.
Bob Dering, conservation co-chairman
for the Bay Area chapter of the society, said
the County Planning Commission had re
jected the report, but the board of super
visors went ahead and approved it anyway.
He said, "It is glaringly deficient ... it
(Edgewood) is a very precious thing and
we feel the analysis wasn't adequate to
make a decision."
When askt'd about the lawsuit, San
Mateo Environmental Management Di
rector Paul Koenigsaid, "I don't think their
suit has merit. I think the Environmental
Impact Report is adequate." He added,
"VVe re going to do some additional
studies of the Bay Checkerspot butterfly to
make sure that we're taking its needs into
account."
The park is the largest of only three Bay
Checkerspot habitats on the Peninsula.
The other two are the Jasper Ridge Biolog
ical Preserve and San Bruno Mountain.
Dennis Murphy, research associate in

the biology department, said Edgewood
has the potential to support an immense
population" of the butterflies. Bvcontrast,
lasper Ridge and San Bruno are suscepti
ble to droughts, which in turn cause
periodic extinctions ot Checkerspots.
Stuart Weiss, Class of '82, who spent
four years doing research in the par k, said,
"California grasslands have really taken a
beating. One of the last places you can
find thrm is in serpentine." He added that
serpentine, which happens to be the state
rock of California, is perhaps the final re
tuge for native grasses and other rare
species of insects and plants which prolif
erate at Edgewood.
Weiss said the butterfly and other mem
bers ot the ecosystem will be "strongly
affected" by the golf course's construc
tion. "When you fragment like that you
start losing species," he said. "There's ev
erything that the butterflies need right
there, so they don't move around. You'll
tind the plants in other areas, but at
Edgewood they overlap — there's nectar
for the adults and food for the caterpil
lars."
The Bay Checkerspot butterfly has been
studied for 23 years by Biology Prof. Paul
Ehrlich. In his book, Extinction, Ehrlich
wrote, "Colonies of the Bay Checkerspot
are now by far the best-known natural
populations of any invertebrate — possi
bly of any non-human organism."
The National Science Foundation has
granted Ehrlich between $20,000 and
$50,000 annually tor the past two decades
to study the insect.
Bob Emerit, chief of maintenance and
operations for San Mateo County, said, "I
think that it will be an exciting park no
matter what happens. I have very, very
mixed feelings — I don't play golf and I'm
excited about serpentine and wildflowers,
but I can see both sides."
Homeowners in the area had mixed feel
ings about the issue. Woodside resident

Thalia Lubin said, "I think there are
enough golf courses around. I love to go
on wildflower walks up there, but I < an see
the pressures on the c ounty tor a multi-use
park."
Another Woodside resident, Dorothy
Babcock, said, "It's okay with me. I'm a
golf fiend."
Commenting on Babcock's opinion,
Weiss said, "That's the number one prob
lem — people don't know what's going on
out there."
To generate publicity and support, he is
circulating a petition which asks the board
of supervisors to leave Edgewood "as .1
natural area to be enjoyed by the present
and future residents of the Bay Area."
David Christy, director of the San Mateo
Parks and Recreation Department, pre
dicted that the golf course would have
60,000 rounds of play annually.
Edgewood would be the tirst county
owned golf course, and it could be one of
the finest in the country, according to
Emerit. "There aren't a whole lot of golf
courses for this poulation," he said.
Because the greens and fairways would
take up less than half of the parkland, othei
facilities could also be built, Christy said.
These would include a youth day camp lor
such groups as the boy and Girl Scouts,
equestrian and hiking trails on the perime
ter of the course, and a golt clubhouse,
which could be used for social activities in
the evenings such as proms.
As the issue stands, grading and filling
would begin on the park in a year to IB
months, if the lawsuit against the county
fails. However, Dering said his organiza
tion was prepared to fight to the end.
Summarizing his view of the situation,
Emerit said, "Ten years ago we would have
bulldozed the whole thing. Now we're
thinking of preservation. We'd like to see
the maximum preservation of the serpen
tine and the optimm use of the golf
course."

$50,000 annually tor the past two decades
to study the insect.
Bob Emerit, chief of maintenance and
operations for San Mateo County, said, "I
think that it will be an exciting park no
matter what happens. I have very, very
mixed feelings — I don't play golf and I'm
excited about serpentine and wildflowers,
but I can see both sides."
Homeowners in the area had mixed feel
ings about the issue. Woodside resident

Thalia Lubin said, "I think there are
enough golf courses around. I love to go
on wildflower walks up there, but I < an see
the pressures on the c ounty tor a multi-use
park."
Another Woodside resident, Dorothy
Babcock, said, "It's okay with me. I'm a
golf fiend."
Commenting on Babcock's opinion,
Weiss said, "That's the number one prob
lem — people don't know what's going on
out there."
To generate publicity and support, he is
circulating a petition which asks the board
of supervisors to leave Edgewood "as .1
natural area to be enjoyed by the present
and future residents of the Bay Area."
David Christy, director of the San Mateo
Parks and Recreation Department, pre
dicted that the golf course would have
60,000 rounds of play annually.
Edgewood would be the tirst county
owned golf course, and it could be one of
the finest in the country, according to
Emerit. "There aren't a whole lot of golf
courses for this poulation," he said.
Because the greens and fairways would
take up less than half of the parkland, othei
facilities could also be built, Christy said.
These would include a youth day camp lor
such groups as the boy and Girl Scouts,
equestrian and hiking trails on the perime
ter of the course, and a golt clubhouse,
which could be used for social activities in
the evenings such as proms.
As the issue stands, grading and filling
would begin on the park in a year to IB
months, if the lawsuit against the county
fails. However, Dering said his organiza
tion was prepared to fight to the end.
Summarizing his view of the situation,
Emerit said, "Ten years ago we would have
bulldozed the whole thing. Now we're
thinking of preservation. We'd like to see
the maximum preservation of the serpen
tine and the optimm use of the golf
course."

Gold course nature trails or both? Ihe
development Edgewood Park is pitting
environmentalists — uic luding some Stan
ford biologists against the County of
San Mateo, which owns the site. The park
itselt is 4b7 acres of gentle hills, just off
Highway 280 in Woodside and about IS
minutes from campus.
One of the last remaining serpentine
grassland on the West Coast grows at the
park. This grassland is inhabited by the Bay
Checkerspot butterfly, a candidate for the
national endangered species list. How
ever, a 150-iii re golf course approved by
the San Matt > Board of Supervisors may
eliminate 30 percent of the serpentine
grassland.
In response to the development plan,
the California Native Plant Society filed a
lawsuit on km 14, asking that San Mateo
County set aside its acceptance of the mas
ter plan and the Environmental Impact Re
port.
Bob Dering, conservation co-chairman
for the Bay Area chapter of the society, said
the County Planning Commission had re
jected the report, but the board of super
visors went ahead and approved it anyway.
He said, "It is glaringly deficient ... it
(Edgewood) is a very precious thing and
we feel the analysis wasn't adequate to
make a decision."
When askt'd about the lawsuit, San
Mateo Environmental Management Di
rector Paul Koenigsaid, "I don't think their
suit has merit. I think the Environmental
Impact Report is adequate." He added,
"VVe re going to do some additional
studies of the Bay Checkerspot butterfly to
make sure that we're taking its needs into
account."
The park is the largest of only three Bay
Checkerspot habitats on the Peninsula.
The other two are the Jasper Ridge Biolog
ical Preserve and San Bruno Mountain.
Dennis Murphy, research associate in

the biology department, said Edgewood
has the potential to support an immense
population" of the butterflies. Bvcontrast,
lasper Ridge and San Bruno are suscepti
ble to droughts, which in turn cause
periodic extinctions ot Checkerspots.
Stuart Weiss, Class of '82, who spent
four years doing research in the par k, said,
"California grasslands have really taken a
beating. One of the last places you can
find thrm is in serpentine." He added that
serpentine, which happens to be the state
rock of California, is perhaps the final re
tuge for native grasses and other rare
species of insects and plants which prolif
erate at Edgewood.
Weiss said the butterfly and other mem
bers ot the ecosystem will be "strongly
affected" by the golf course's construc
tion. "When you fragment like that you
start losing species," he said. "There's ev
erything that the butterflies need right
there, so they don't move around. You'll
tind the plants in other areas, but at
Edgewood they overlap — there's nectar
for the adults and food for the caterpil
lars."
The Bay Checkerspot butterfly has been
studied for 23 years by Biology Prof. Paul
Ehrlich. In his book, Extinction, Ehrlich
wrote, "Colonies of the Bay Checkerspot
are now by far the best-known natural
populations of any invertebrate — possi
bly of any non-human organism."
The National Science Foundation has
granted Ehrlich between $20,000 and
$50,000 annually tor the past two decades
to study the insect.
