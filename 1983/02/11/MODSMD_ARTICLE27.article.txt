# University land, developed or left open, is a valuable resource

With 8180 acres of land to its
name, Stanford is one of the
largest universities in the coun
try. Vet the central campus ac
counts for slightly less than
one-fourth of Stanford land,
and less than half of its acres
are currently used for
academic purposes.
Until 1950, virtually all Stan
ford property was unincorpo
rated, and most of the land
outside the main campus area
was grazing land. However,

beginning in the 19505, as the
surrounding communities be
came more urbanized, the
taxes on the University-owned
grazing land exceeded the in
come it received from leasing
the land lor such agricultural
purposes. The board of trus
tees then resolved that it was
legitimate academic use to
lease some of its land for com
mercial purposes to pay the
taxes and earn income.
Although all University lands
are ultimately intended to be
used for educational purposes,
the Stanford Land Use Policy
provides for the development

of interim uses on land parcels
for which academic needs are
not anticipated in the near fu
ture.
The first commercial devel
opment to take place on Uni
versity land was the Stanford
Industrial Park. Frederick Ter
man, former provost and dean
of the School of Engineering,
acted on his idea of turning
Stanford s land endowment
into an asset that could attract
faculty. The University could
use revenues from the leases

to hire outstanding professors.
The high-caliber teaching at
Stanford led to the kinds of in
dustries which settled in the
Industrial Park, according to
Planning Director Phil Wil
liams. For example, Stanford
faculty were instrumental in
the birth of Hewlett-Packard
and Varian Labs.
The Industrial Park was orig
inally intended for businesses
demonstrating an academic in
volvement. But after several
years, the need for the income
from new businesses surpas

sed the academic relation, ac
cording to Williams. However,
in 1974, the trustees modified
their pro-development/
investment policy and resolved
that they would from then on
restrict commercial and indus
trial development to existing
commercial areas or to those
uses strictly related to the
academic program. Some en
gineering faculty members and
students are currently involved
in research and development
at Hewlett-Packard and Xerox
and other Silicon Valley firms.
The early Industrial Park
leases were sold for 50 years at
the equivalent cost of the land
value, whereas lately, with the

land values increasing, leases
are given out on a yearly basis
and can be adjusted upward
each year, according to Andy
Doty, director of community
relations. The University has
earned around $22 million
from Industrial park leases and
their investment since 1955,
Doty said.
The next major commerical
development included the
Stanford Shopping and Profes
sional Centers which began in
1955 and 1957, respectively.
Major department stores own
their buildings but lease the
land form the University. By
contrast, small stores rent their
buildings from the University.
Stanford netted about $5 mil
lion last year from the shop

ping center, according to Doty.
Other income property for
the University includes Palo
Alto Square, Oak Creek
Apartments and Stanford Hills.
"A Stanford student's tuition
pays less than half of the cost of
education here," Doty said,
"so the remainder must be
made up in various ways and
land development is one of
them."
I he University, although in a
separate unincorporated area,
is not isolated from the influ
ence of surrounding com
munities. Its land falls under
the jurisdiction of two counties
— Santa Clara and San Mateo,
two cities — Palo Alto and
Menlo Park, and two towns —
Woodside and Portola Valley.
The University falls within the
"sphere of influence" of these
four communities. A sphere of
influence is an area within the
growth pattern of a city five to
25 years in the future, which
the city is prepared to annex,
accommodate development
and provide municipal ser
vices.
All commercial and housing
developments, excluding fac
ulty housing, have been an
nexed to the respective sphere
of influence community. Palo
Alto has annexed about MOO
aires of Stanford land, while
the other three communities
have annexed about 100 acres
each. The University itself,
however, is exempt from an
nexation under a special
agreement because it has
existed longer than the sur
rounding communities, ac
cording to Williams.
In addition, the Local Agency
Formation Commission
(LAFCO), formed in 1963, gives
sphere of influence com
munities planning responsi
bility" for the unincorporated
lands within their spheres.
Sphere of influence com
munities can place and have
placed their own land use de
signations on Stanford prop
erty, even though the designa
tions are not legally binding on

University lands unless they
are adopted in the county's
general plan.
Doty criticized the designa
tion of Stanford lands under
spheres of influence. "Stan
ford provides its own munici
pal services at the cost of the
University . . . we are self
sufficient, so it doesn't follow
that a sphere of influence
community can determine
those uses," Doty said. "If a
community can dictate land
use without financial respon
sibility, that is like taxation
without representation," he
continued.
The University, which Doty
called a "quasi-city," provides
its own police services and
< ontracts for fire services with
Palo Alto — unique among
university campuses.
Palo Alto has received a large
portion of its land develop
ment income from sales tax,
property tax and net utility in
come. In 1980, Palo Alto reaped
$8.1 million or 36 percent of its
income from Stanford land.
Bruce Freeland, chief plan
ning official of the Palo Alto
Planning Department, said
Stanford lands have had an
"extraordinarily positive im
pact" on Palo Alto.
During the past decade,
local concerns have been fo

cused on the issue of open
space land preservation. Stan
ford owns over 4000 acres of
undeveloped property, the
largest open space in the re
gion. Surrounding com
munities have looked to the
University to retain its land in
open space to the greatest ex
tent possible.
In 1972, Palo Alto designated
about 3200 acres of Stanford
land, including Piers Ranch
and Webb Ranch, west of
lunipero Serra Blvd., as "per
manent open space and con
servation lands." The Univer
sity protested this designation
and a year later, the city revised
its plan, showing the foothills
areas as "open space
controlled development," or
land upon which some devel
opment can be allowed, pro
viding the open space
amenities are maintained.
Stanford has designated the
2678-acre Piers and Webb
Ranches as "academic re
serve" lands, available for fu
ture needs and in which only
restricted development would
be allowed.
"It is hard to respond to con
cerns about the preservation of
open space," Doty said.
"There is a clash between the
University's national and in
ternational educational objec

tives and the concerns of
neighboring jurisdictions
which are narrower yet still im
portant. It is a constant tug of
war between educational ob
jectives and the preference ot
neighbors," he added.
According to Freeland, the
open space issue could be the
cause of potential future con
flict because Palo Alto views it
as permanent.
Another controversy over
open space arose in 1969 when
the Palo Alto City Council ap
proved the Coyote Hill Indus
trial Park subdivision. The
Committee for Green Footh
ills, a small citizens group who
viewed Coyote Hill as "The
Gateway to the Foothills," filed
suit to halt development there.
The University then struck an
agreement with the Commit
tee and placed Coyote Hill
under open space designation
for 25 to 50 years. Much of the
Coyote Hill area was leased out
in 1971 and is currently used as
grazing land for horses.
Piers Ranch, 2087 acres of
land surrounding the popular
"dish" jogging path, was
leased by Manual Piers over 50
years ago and has been in the
family ever since. The Piers
family have raised beef cattle
on their land for the past 30
years.
