## Card hopes to avenge loss to Cal 
### STEVE ODELL Senior staff writer 
Stanford will be looking for
its third straight win and a
chance to raise its conference
record to the .500 level for the
first time in over three weeks
when it plays host to California
in an 8 p.m. Pacific-10 Confer
ence basketball game tomor
row night at Maples Pavilion.
The Cardinal, 4-5 in the
Pac-10 and 12-7 overall, was at
.500 after it defeated USC on
)an. 20, increasing its mark to
2-2. After that win, Stanford
went on a three-game losing
streak, but has since bounced
back to win two in a row last
weekend.
The Bears, conversely, have
lost six of their last seven
games and are 3-6 in the con
ference and 9-9 overall. The
Bears' only win since it beat
Stanford on Jan. 20 was a 59-57
win over last place and winless
Arizona last weekend.
Cal walked on the Cardinal
75-61 at Harmon Cym in Ber
keley )an. 17, the key to the
Bear rout being an aggressive
and quick halfcourt zone de
fense which effectively bottled
up Cardinal center )ohn Re
velli.
Stanford has progressed
steadily as a team since, espe
cially in its zone offense, hav
ing to play without Revelli the
majority of the time. Revelli
first injured his ankle and mis
sed three games, all confer
ence losses, and then came
back briefly only to be lost for
the season due to torn liga
ments in his knee. Revelli, the
Card's leading scorer and re
bounder, ended up the na
tion's No. 1 field goal shooter,
connecting on 67.1 percent of
his shots.
The Bears are led by center
Michael Pitts, averaging 16.2
points and 6.3 rebounds per
game. Pitts, a six-foot-eleven
center, dominated inside the
last time the two clubs clashed,
and with Revelli out, could be
even more dominating.
Center Hans Wichary did an
excellent job on Arizona post
man Frank Smith in the Cardi
nal's victory Monday night,

however, and got a lot of help
in the Cardinal zone. He will
need to have a similar per
formance tomorrow.
Stanford coach Tom Davis
has said he will move starting
forward Earl Koberlein, who is
just six-foot-five, to the center
position, when Wichary has to
leave the game for a breather.
With six-foot-one Steve Brown
starting at forward, the Cardi

nal features one of t he smallest
line-ups in major college bas
ketball .
But it is also one of the
scrappiest. The Cardinals have
been playing hustling and ag
gressive basketball, especially
at Maples Pavilion, where its
only conference loss has been
to undefeated and league
leading UCLA.

The majority of sr oring slat k
has been picked up by guard
Keith Jones, who scored a
career-high 28 points against
the Wildcats. Jones will have to
penetrate the Be.i /one the
way he did UA's in order to
open it up and allow the Cardi
nal to get inside an ! to free up
for midrange jum| rrs.
Brown has beei Stanford's
main outside threat along with
forward Johnny Rogers, al
though the Card rarely shoots
from farther than I'i feet. I hat's
one reason they ar> leading the
conference in field goal per
centage, however, tickling
twine on 55.6 percent of its
tries.
Kicky lewis has played
steady as the other starting
guard, and has been given ex
cellent relief help from Keith
Ramee, who scored a career
high 13 points on 11 of-14 foul
shooting versus ASU. Andy
Fischer has also continued to
make major contributions
since moving out of the start
ing line-up.
The Bears' little big gun is
guard Michael Chavez, who
has always given the Cardinal
fits. Chavez has a fine outside
shot and has directed the Cal
offense from point guard posi
tion since his freshman year.
The five-foot-eight senior is
averaging 12.4 points a game
and is leading the conference
in his free throw percentage,
finding the cords on 87.2 per
cent of his attempts. As Chavez
goes, so goes Cal
The other half of Cal's vete
ran backcourt is junior Butch
Hayes, who is third in the
league in assists, with 4.9 a
game.
At the corners is where the
Bears are the most explosive or
destructive â€” in short, they are
inconsistanf at forward.
Freshman Dave Butler per
formed brilliantly against Stan
ford the first time, scoring 16
points and grabbing 13 re
bounds, but it was <i rarity. Ihe
other forward is senior Darrell
Haley, who is averaging 7.5
points a game.
