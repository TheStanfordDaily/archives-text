# Letters of intent
## Wiggin signs 20 recruits 
### MARK ZEIGLER 
The recruiting efforts of Stanford football
coaches climaxed Wednesday with 20 high
school players signing letters of intent to at
tend Stanford.
The Cardinal's biggest prize, quarterback
John Paye, announced his commitment to
Stanford nearly three weeks ago in a press
conference. Paye holds numerous national
and California state high school records and
"is probably recognized as the most out
standing quarterback in the country," ac
cording to Offensive Coordinator Jim Fassel.
Joining Paye will be a host of other prep
stars, with biggest name recruits coming in
the offensive area. Fourteen of the 20 signees
are from California but only Paye, an Ather
ton resident, is from the immediate area.
With such a heralded quarterback as Paye,
the Cardinal needed a pair of running backs
to complete the back field. They got them in
Marshall Dillard and Tom Henley.
Dillard, from Bakersfield, Calif., has been
called the No. 1 back in the state, as he
rushed for 2091 yards on 315 carries in his
senior season. His 40 touchdowns were tops
in the state in the 1982 season.
Fassel described the six-foot-three, 210
pound Dillard as a "big, strong, power back,"
while he said Henley, at five-foot-eleven, 180,
is in the "mold of a (former Card star Darrin)
Nelson, (Vincent) White type player."
Fassel said both Dillard and Henley could

contribute immediately to the Cardinal's
wide-open offensive attack. "I think they fit
into what we are trying to do," he explained.
"I think Dillard and Henley could line-up in
the same backfield (in the future) and com
pliment one another."
The two running backs, both heavily re
cruited by USC and UCLA, were among four
Stanford recruits that have been named to
the Long Beach Press-Telegram "Best in the
West" squad. Paye and six-foot-one, 200
pound safety ]oe Cain, who averaged 14 tack
les a game, also made the squad.
"There are always highs and lows in recruit
ing and tec hnically perhaps you always think
you could have done better," Head Coach
Paul Wiggin said. "I must say,however,that I
feel we did an exceptional job this time
around."
The Cardinal landed three offensive line
men, with six-foot-seven, 270 pound Tony
DeTomaso heading the list. Although only
one wide receiver, Jeff lames, signed Wed
nesday, Tassel expects to get two more, one
of which he hopes will be Quentin Smith
from Washington, D.C.
On the defensive side of the field, Stanford
recruited two defensive linemen, four
linebackers and three defensive backs. The
Card also landed two new tight ends, a
punter and a third running back form
California — Brad Muster, from San Martin
High in Novato.
