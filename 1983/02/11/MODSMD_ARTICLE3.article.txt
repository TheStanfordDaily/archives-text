# Students fake financial need forms
## 
### STEVE KAUFMAN Staff writer 
As the cost of education continues
to rise here, many students are suc
cumbing to the temptation to c heat
on their financial aid forms, accord
ing to officials in Ihe Financial Aids
Office.
"Student financial aid has become
a paper jungle," Robert Huff, di
rector of financial aids, said. "With
so many figures to contend with,
there most certainly is room lor dis
honesty."
Fie said students find many ways to
alter information submitted to the
College Scholarship Service, the firm

which handles the Financial Aid Form
each year. The result is a financial
picture whit h portrays the student as
being poorer than he actually is.
Cheating is accomplished in sev
eral ways through the forms, accord
ing to Huff. One common method is
for parents not to disclose income
earned in other countries. Another is
to underestimate income for the fol
lowing year, and hope the financial
aid advisors will not notice.
However, several safegards are
written into the awards process
which enable the Financial Aids Of
fice to spot inc consistencies in the in
tormation submitted by parents.

"The Financial Aid Form is writte
is such a way that we can double
check certain kinds of information
for accuracy," Roberta lohnson, as
sistant director for awarding and ad
vising, said. She explained that th>
office is equipped with an effective
screening procedure for the forms
by which they can spot suspicious
figures.
In addition to carefully reviewing
the forms, the Financial Aids Office
asks a 10 percent random sampling of
parents for copies of their tax returns
for the year. This is done to check for
discrepancies between estimated in
come submitted to the University,
and the actual amount earned. Cur
rent regulations require that parents
notify the office if they earn more
than $2000 in excess of their esti
mated income for the year.
"We have considered asking all
parents for a copy of their tax return
but are unsure if this is necessary,"
Huff said. He added that the inci
dence of actual cheating discovered
through tax returns is relatively low.
If the aids advisor finds an incon
sistency after reviewing a tax return,

a letter is sent to the parents request
ing an explanation of the problem.
"In nearly every instance, we are
able to account for the difference,"
Huff said, adding that 20 percent of
the families sampled are $1000 to
$2000 more than their estimates.
It parents are discovered to have
misrepresented their financial pic
ture to the University, they either
asked to return any scholarship
funds already accepted or are billed
for the amount and, in some cases,
denied financial aid in future years.
"Some might call it harassment,
but we are simply trying to make sure
aid goes to those students who truly
deserve it," Huff said.

Cases also exist of student polic
ing, where a student will approach
the Financial Aids Office with a com
plaint against other students.
"These are relatively rare, but they
do occur," Johnson said. "If a stu
dent feels that another is trying to
take advantage of the system they
will sometimes come and tell us,
either is person or anonymously."
She added that the office will always
investigate student claims of dishon
esty.
"We have developed a certain de
gree of sophistication in the way we
administer financial aids," Huff said.
"Our senior staff has over 100 years
of financial aids experience between
them."
