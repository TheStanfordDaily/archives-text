Stanford fencers end their
dual meet season today when
they visit arch-rival San Jose
State.
Both the men's team (8-1)
and the women's team (7-1)
have won their last six con
tests, rolling over traditional
powers Air Force and Long
Beach State along the way.
The one blemish on the Car
dinal record came from their
last meeting with San Jose,
when the Spartan men walked
away with a 16-11 victory while
the Lady Spartans were posting
an 11-5 tally.
"Ihe men's team has been
growing stronger with each
succeeding meet,"said head
coach Buzz Hurst. "They've
gained in poise as well as tech
nical ability and are as ready as

they're going to be."
"The women have had a re
markable season, although
BVU put a good scare into us
last Saturday," Flurst said.
"Unfortunately, Alison Reid,
the leading fencer, suffered a
knee injury which may cost her
the rest of the season and defi
nitely will keep her out against
San Jose."
Elliot Cheu (27-0) will pace
the men's foil team backed by
Dave Sherman with an 18-6 re
cord. Nik Blevins (20-2) and
Harvey Cain (12-2) lead the
epee squad, while sabremen
Howard Cash (18-2) and Andy
Goorno (18-4) head that team.
The meet starts at 4 p.m. in
the fencing room of the San
Jose State Physical Education
Building.
