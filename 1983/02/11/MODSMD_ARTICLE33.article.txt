# Synchronized swimming

### BETH KLEID 
What in the world is synchronized
swimming? Most people compare it to
water ballet seen in old Esther Wil
liams movies, but "don't you dare" say
that to the synchronized swimmers of
the Club Sport team here.
"That comparison is really what we
are trying to get away from," said
Andrea Wilson, team captain. "Most
people think that we just flop around
in the water. Synchronized swimming
is a lot more difficult than it looks."
Synchronized swimming combines
grace with skill and endurance. In syn
chronized swim meets, the swimmers
execute certain previously deter
mined patterns in the water. The
swimmers are judged on the difficulty
of the patterns, the precision in which
they are executed and by their grace
fulness.
"The set patterns have names — like
the heron and the swordfish for exam
ple," said Laura Lopez, a team
member. "At meets we draw out of a
hat to see which ones we are going to
have to execute."
The synchronized swim team here is
composed of seven women. They
practice three times a week for two
hour sessions at deGuerre pool.
"Synchronized swimming in itself is
really strenuous," said Lopez. "To
work on cultivating endurance we do
laps and breathing exercises. We have
to be able to last for the entire five
minutes it takes to do a routine. Some
of the routines we do are really dif
ficult."

There are three divisions for syn
chronized swimmers: novice, juniors
and seniors. Ihese divisions indicate
level of difficulty. Most of us on the
team here are second-year novices.
We do have two seniors on the team,
and they are both freshmen," said
Wilson.
"I joined the team because I
enjoy swimming, and I like the variety
that synchronized swimming has to of
fer," said Lopez.
Wilson said that she had always
wanted to participate in synchronized
swimming. "The team is not hard to
make, and we encourage anyone to try
out. We really have a good time," she
said.
Lopez said synchronized swimming
combines serious swimming with
grace. "It really is the best of both
worlds — it is not quite as demanding
as a swim team, but it is a challenge
anyway."
The team competes during the
winter quarter. Altogether, it has four
meets. One of its meets is with UC—
Berkeley, one is with Arizona and then
comes the regionals and the nationals.
"There aren't that many schools
with sync hronized swim teams, so it's
hard to find people to compete against
who are close by," said Wilson. "Ohio
State and other schools in the Midwest
have big teams, but we don't have
enough money to go the distance to
compete against them."
Last Sunday, the synchronized swim
team had their meet here against Ber
keley and were victorious.
