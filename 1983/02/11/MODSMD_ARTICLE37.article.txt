$15 million horse stolen
Dublin, Ireland — A firm $3 million
ransom demand has been received for
missing racehorse Shergar, it was re
vealed here yesterday.
At $15 million, Shergar is rated the
most valuable thoroughbred in the
world. Shegar retired at the end of the
1981 season after collecting six victories
in eight races and winning more than
half a million dollars.
The search for the thoroughbred,
missing since Tuesday night from the
Ballaway stud farm at Newbridge, con
tinued yesterday on both sides of the
Irish border as a massive police opera
tion moved into top gear.
Meanwhile, fears were expressed
that the Aga Khan's wonder horse
could have been taken by Irish ter
rorists.

Early this morning telephone callers
informed Irish police and the BBC that
Shergar is dead. No further details were
available.
