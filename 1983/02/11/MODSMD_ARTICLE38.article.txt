# Big weekend for gymnasts
## 
### SARAH CARREL 
Maples Pavilion will be a
hum of activity tonight as the
Stanford gymnastics teams
take on two opponents at 7:30
p.m. The women will face
long-time rivals UC-Berkeley,
while the men are hosting San
Jose State.
For head coach Homer Sar
dina's women, this is not the
first meetingof the season with
Cal. Only two weeks ago, the
two teams met in Berkeley, and
Stanford came away with a vic
tory of less than a point.
"We have an unblemished
record with Cal so far,"
Hamada said, "and we plan to
keep it that way." Stanford will
have the advantage of familiar

equipment and a home crowd.
The Cardinal has also had
more than its share of injuries.
Unable to compete in the meet
will be freshmen Carolyn Tar
kington and Pam Blom, both
all-around gymnasts who ap
pear to be out for the season.
Senior Karen Hall is still re
covering from a foot injury re
ceived at last weekend's meet
at USC, and it is only a hope
that she will be able to com
pete in two of the four events
tonight. With a limited field of
athletes left to chose from, the
meet should be a trying one.
The men will face a less for
midable opponent in San Jose
State, especially since two of
the Spartan's top gymnasts

were injured earlier this sea
son.
San jose State features Ron
Palassou, a superstar gymnast
who was ranked number eight
in the nation last year. Stanford
coach Sadao Hamada has cho
sen to rest freshman pow
erhouse Gary Smith in antici
pation of tough upcoming
away meets, making tonight's
meet that much more even.
Without Smith, Hamada is
hoping for a score of 265 plus,
rather than his usual goal of 270
plus.
"I'm not really looking for a
team score, but more for indi
vidual scores this meet,"
Hamada said.
