# Berg lauds new gene research

"Industry is suddenly beginningto
perceive the power of developing
basic knowledge first," Nobel
Laureate Paul Berg, a biochemistry
professor here, said to more than 75
people last night in Roble Hall.
Speaking on "Genetic Engineer
ing: Boon or Bane?" Berg made clear
that his answer is "boon."
"In some areas my colleagues and I
speculate that the best basic research
will be done in the industrial labs,"
he said. "It's interesting and excit
ing" that industries are coming up
with large amounts of money for this
purpose.
"The time period between a dis
covery in a basic research lab and its
immediate applications has become
unusually short," he said. Although
he said he sees "no intrjpsic risks"
with researchers entering industry,
"What worries me the most is the
extent to which people will change
the direction of their research,"
knowing that many industries are an
xiously awaiting new developments.
Berg said he wanted to "take the
opportunity to spread the gospel and

teach a little." Referring to the gbl
den age of genetic engineering re
search that began in the last decade
and was greeted by a public furor, he
said, "The media had a field day try
ing to scare the public."
He explained that the media tried
to create concern rather than edu
cate, and showed a slide of a maga
zine cover which depicted a DNA
molecule spiraling into the head of a
vipor. The caption read, "Playing
Cod with DNA."
Berg discussed health field appli
cations stemming from the fact that
knowledge of gene expression can
have a direct influence on the diag
nosis and treatment of a disease.
"It's now possible to make diag
noses for a large number of genetic
diseases," he said, citing sickle cell
anemia as an example. Soon "it
could be possible to literally diag
nose any genetic defect, which
means virtually all human disease.
"It is now possible to make any
human protein cheaply and
quickly," he said, in reference to the
opportunities in the pharmaceutical
field. Examples are the production of

human insulin for diabetics, growth
hormones and substances like in
terferons which have potential for
inhibiting cancer and the common
cold.
Addressing the issue of ethics, he
said there may be points when soci
ety will say, "We're not comfortable
with what you're opening the door
to." He added that he sees no prob
lem when things like the correction
of fatal diseases are involved.
Berg said he does not foresee mis
guided medical adventurism under
present conditions because of tight
regulations requiring every experi
ment to be described in great detail
and reviewed extensively.
The facilities needed for genetic
research and development are com
plex and sophisticated and Berg
therefore dismissed scenarios such
as that of a small town doctor with an
array of genes laid out on his shelves.
The research that Berg is currently
working on at the Stanford Medical
Center involves trying to insert genes
that have been isolated into cells.
Berg said more knowledge is re
quired before this may be success
fully accomplished.
