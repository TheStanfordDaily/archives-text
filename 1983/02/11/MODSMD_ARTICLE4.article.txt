# Profs reject new court proposal
## 
### JEFF BIDDULPH Senior Staff Writer 
Chief lustice of the Supreme Court
Warren Burger should look at inter
nal changes within the court itself
rather than asking for major changes
in the federal court system, accord
ing to Law School Profs. Gerald
Gunther and William Cohen.
Both professors commented in re
sponse to Burger's address Sunday
before the American Bar Association
in which he asked Congress to re
duce the work load on Supreme
Court justices by setting up a panel of
judges to decide many of the cases
which are now handled by the Su
preme Court.
"They (Supreme Court justices)
should put their own house in order
rather than running to Congress,"
Gunther said. "They're barking up
the wrong tree."
Burger's address was the latest in a
series of proposals — dating from the
early 1970s — by justices to make
changes in the Supreme Court be
cause of the increasing amount of
appeals filed. Burger said that in 1981

i ncre wt're ii c ases uri i ru' uu< m-i
compared to 1463 in 1953 and that
there were only 65 signed opinions in
1953 compared to 141 last year.
Gunther said, however, that al
though there has been a significant
increase in the number of cases and
opinions, these figures are mislead
ing.
The year "1953 was the low point in
modern history for cases and opin
ions in the Supreme Court,
Gunther said.
And Cohen said "the problem is
not as serious as some have
thought."
Gunther said the increased work
load problem could be solved by
greater communication among the
justices and greater discretion in
choosing cases.
"There's a real lack of communica
tion within the court," Gunther said.
"They're not talking a lot to each
other."
He said the court is producing
more opinions because of this lack of
communication, justices have been
writing more separate opin
ions instead of collaborating
on them, Cunther said.
Cohen said the court should
be more selective in deciding
which cases to hear.
"The court has been taking
many cases it shouldn't take
and ignoring cases it should
take," he said.
Cohen also questioned

whether Burger's plan would
reduce the amount of work for
each justice.
"If the court used Burger's
plan it would just fill in the vac
uum with new cases," he said.
Cohen also said the justices
should produce shorter opin
ions. He said that if the justices
wrote the opinions themselves
instead of relying extensively
on clerks the opinions would
be shorter. The heavy use of
clerks — most justices hire five
now; until the '60s most used
two — has contributed to the

length of the opinions, hesaid
"The opinions have been
bloated," he said. "You no
longer have the feeling that the
justice is writing the opinion.
Burger asked Congress to set
up a temporary panel com
posed of judges from various
circuits which would decide
many of the cases which now
involve conflicting circuit
courts. He said 45 of the 141
cases decided by the Supreme
Court last year involved such
conflicts.
