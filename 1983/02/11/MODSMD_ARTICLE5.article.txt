# Food Service to try changes

Residents of Sterling Quad and two row houses will be
> 'ing differently next year following implementation of
a experimental food service program designed to save
money and perhaps improve quality.
It will probably be another week and a half before
iv (the University) have a plan ready to be reviewed by
st idents," said Mark Kalkus, co-chair of the ASSU Food
Si ice Task Force, whose report last year gave impetus
to the changes.
I he new system for Sterling Quad would almost cer-
Inly be some sort of free-for-service plan, he said. Two
( <»w houses, Storey House and 353 Campus Drive, were
given the go-ahead Wednesday to experiment with
sell op plans.
"We're still in the formulating stage," Ed Scoles, di
recto 1 of housing and food service, said. "We are trying
to reo ice net costs for the average customer."
According to Gordon Flecker, co-chair of the task
force, the two experiments reflect the remarkable
progress made this year. In the task force report two of
the most urgent recommendations were that the Uni
versity should begin as soon as possible an experiment
with a fee tor-service plan and that row houses should
be allowed to pursue independent self-op plans.
"judging from what has happened at other colleges, I
wouldn't he surprised if in the long run we saw savings
of up to 15 percent with the fee-tor-service plan,'' Kalkus
said.
Hecker emphasized the significance of allowing row

houses to go self-op. "Last year University-run fooc
service on the row ran a defitit of over $140,000 ht
said, "which was subsidized by all toot! servi( e custom
ers. The row houses are an incredible burden. Ht
added that switching to self-op is also in the best inn-res
of row houses, making it possible for residents to de
velop a sense of community and learn through the man
agement of their own facilities.
Row Manager Diana Conklin said the task Urn e repor
was largely responsible for the move toward sell-ops
"Some houses were saying that they might be interestet
(in going self-op). I talked about it with Norm Robinsoi
(dean of residential education) and Maxine Anderso
(food service director) and everyone agreed that w
should do something.
"We gave all nine row houses the opportunity to writ
proposals but only two (proposals) were submitted b
the |an. 31 deadline . . . These houses (353 Campus ant
Story) made excellent proposals. The teeling I get tron
the other houses is that they're pretty happy with thei
food service.
"I have every reason to believe that the row experi
ment will work out," Kalkus said.
Scoles said the task force was not playing a key role ir
the development of the Sterling Quad plan. But h<
added that the University's decision to experiment wit I
food service alternatives "indicates our responsiveness
to their (the task force) input. After we've tilled out wh.v
the new system might be, we will want their comment'
as well as those of other students. We'll start off with at
idea and amend it as we go along."

Hecker said he believed the task
force should be playing a more active
role at this point. "The task force
feels that it has a responsibility to the
students to insure that they get the
best food service possible. As a re
sult, we expect to have a great deal of
input into the actual designing of the
experiment at Sterling Quad."
Kalkus, by contrast, said the Scoles
plan was "probably a more efficient
way to do it." Efforts by a large com
mittee of students and University
representatives to implement a fee
for-service plan at Roble ended in
chaos earlier this year, he added.
Student complaints were also an
important factor in the University's
decision to go ahead with some sort
of fee-for-service plan, Scoles said.
"There've been a lot of complaints
from students who believe that they
pay for more than they get." He said
the new system might be "auto
mated or use coupons" to keep track
of the food each student eats.
