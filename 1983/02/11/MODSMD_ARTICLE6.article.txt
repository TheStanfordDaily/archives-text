President plans new job package
Washington — President Reagan bowed to pres
sure from Congress yesterday and offered Democrat
ic: leaders a $4 3 billion jobs and recession relief pack
age that includes new federal construction projects
and a sizable amount of humanitarian relief for the
jobless.
House Speaker Thomas "Tip" O'Neill (D-Mass.)
hailed the package as "progress in meeting the coun
try's economic emergency" and promised totake it to
House commitee chairmen and Senate Democrats in
the next few (days before reporting back to the presi
dent.
The package was offered at a secret meeting yester
day afternoon in O'Neill's office that included the

speaker, Office of Management and Budget Directo
David Stockman, White House chief of staff Jame
Baker, House Majority Leader James Wright (D-Texas
and House Democratic Whip Thomas Foley (D
Wash.).
In a carefully worded statement suggesting tha
Keagan and Democrats are near agreement on tin
package, O'Neill said it moves "significantly in the
same direction" as the $5.4 billion anti-retession pro
posal that Reagan threatened to veto during th<
lame-duck session of Congress last year.
How much of the $4.3 billion is new money anc
how much is a speedup of existing programs was no
immediately clear. Sources said the package include
a sizable amount of humanitarian aid, such as food
and shelter, for those hurt by the recession, including
new money for child nutrition. It also would ac
celerate some federal construction projects and pos
sibly provide money for new projects.
The sources said the package does not contain the
kind of public works jobs that Reagan has objected to
as "make work," but would provide additional mon
ey for community development block grants, which
go to cities for housing and urban development
needs.
The White House had no comment on the package,
but one administration official, referring to the initial
congressional reaction, said, "From what they say, it
looks good."
The proposal was greeted warmly by the House
Democratic leaders. Wright said he was "very en
thusiastic" and "agreeably surprised at the distance
the administration has come to embrace and accept
the major components of our jobs initiative last De
cember."
Foley, who has been coordinating recession relief
efforts for the House Democratic leadership, said the
package was a "very constructive and positive de
velopment." But he cautioned thatit might not please
everyone, including Democrats who want to go
further.
Truckers' strike ends
Washington — The Independent Truckers Associa
tion (ITA) called off its 11-day-old strike yesterday,
several days after it became obvious that the some
times-violent shutdown had failed to interrupt com
merce in any significant way.

ITA President Mike Parkhurst, surrounded by loyal
followers and accompanied by three congressmen,
said during a sometimes raucous news conference
that the strike had accomplished "more than we ha\e
ever been able to in the past."
When Parkhurst called for the shutdown, he said
truckers were demanding repeal of new federal taxes
on diesel fuel and truck use, a ceiling on state trucking
taxes and "meaningful discussion" of the 55 mph
speed limit.
What Parkhurst got was a page-long "Expression of
Concern," signed by about 40 members of Congress,
according to Rep. Peter Kostmayer (D-Pa.). The
statement said that "a thriving, diverse trucking in
dustry is an interest we all share" and that "the review
of these tax and user fee increases is definitely in or
der, in our opinion."
There is nothing in the statement about state taxes
or the 55 mph speed limit. Kostmayer, asked about
them, responded, "That does not mean we do not
share (Parkhurst's) concern," and predicted that
many more members of Congress will sign the
statement in days to come.
Transportation Secretary Elizabeth Hanford Dole
said later, "We are pleased by today's announcement
calling for an end to the attempted shutdown of high
way commerce," and said Department of Transporta
tion officials are "ready and willing" to discuss various
trucking issues with "responsible representatives of
the industry."
During the shutdown, one trucker, a North Caroli
na Teamsters union member, was shot and killed and
at least 97 people were injured in various incidents.
There were reportedly more than 650 shooting inci
dents and almost 2000 other acts of vandalism against

truckers.
Violence decreased markedly in recent days as state
police stepped up patrols and truckers formed con
voys. Many drivers undoubtedly stopped working for
a time last week, but with excess capacity in the truck
ing industry estimated at 30 to 40 percent, shippers
were able to move goods. Railroads reported signifi
cant increases in traffic.
Despite a few spot shortages, particularly in pro
duce, the strike was generally ineffective, according
to monitors from the Agriculture and Transportation
departments.
By the time Parkhurst called for an end to the shut
down yesterday, many of those who had stopped driv
ing were back on the road.
The independent drivers own and operate their
rigs, often leasing their services to larger companies.
It is estimated that they account for one-fifth to one
third of all truck drivers.
Bush works for missile ban
London — Vice President George Bush said yester
day that allied leaders in western Europe have told
him they are interested in interim agreements with
the Soviet Union that could lead to President Rea
gan's goal of a ban on medium-range nuclear missiles
in Europe.
Bush, ending a 12-day trip through western Europe,
stressed, however, that western alliance support re
mains solid for trying to achieve Reagan's "zero
zero" plan. Under it the Soviets would remove all mis
siles aimed at western Europe in return for cancella
tion of U.S. deployment of new Pershing II and cruise
missiles in NATO countries.

In an interview here before he returned to Wash
ington yesterday, Bush said, "I am not saying what
(the U.S.) position might or might not be" on any pos
sible interim step. "That won't be determined until
we assess all this information" in Washington, he said.
His comments are the first official confirmation that
the White House will be informed of western Europe
an desire for an interim agreement with the Soviets,
which presumably would leave both sides with an
equal, reduced number of missiles until a ban could
be negotiated.
U.S. and western European officials said the allied
leaders did not press Bush and in most cases were
vague about what they wanted. They appeared will
ing to leave the details and the timing up to the Amer
icans.
Stocks close at highest this month
Falling interest rates helped touch off a strong rally
in the stock market yesterday, carrying the Dow Jones
industrial average close to the record highs it reached
last month.

which had fallen 19.68 points Tuesday and Wednes
day, rebounded 20.33 to 1087.75. That marked the
Dow's highest close since it hit its all-time closing high
of 1092.35 on Jan. 10.
Today's weather
Wind south increasing today. Chance of rain by this
afternoon. Wind shifting to westerly and decreasing.
