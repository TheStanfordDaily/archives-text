## MCI head says company growing fast 
### BOB DUGONI 
A revolution is taking place,
but not in a foreign country
and no government is in threat
of being overthrown. This re
volution, according to William
McCowan, founder and
chairman of the board of MCI
Communications Corporation,
is in the telecommunications
industry.
McCowan told a crowd at
Bishop Auditorium last night
that the telecommunications
and data processing industries
are in a revolution and are be
coming "the most exciting,
dynamic and fastest growing
businesses of this century."
Participating in the "View
from the Top" speaker series
sponsored by the Business
School Placement Committee,
McGowan said the computer
has replaced the factory as the
most important element of the
American economy. He added
that society needs telecom
munications "to make it
work."
"What you are observing is a
major trauma," he said.
"People and every basic tenet
of their operation are going to
have to change."
"Change was inevitable. The
MCls of this world are not

going to be denied," McGo
wan said.
Change began for MCI in
1979 when the Supreme Court
ordered the breakup of Ameri
can Telephone and Telegraph
(AT&T) as a result of MCl's $ l .8
million anti-trust suit.
Since then, the communica
tions company's revenue has
increased 100 percent annu
ally. As of lune 1, 1982, MCI
serves about 850,000 domestic
customers with an $800 million
network. The success of the
company prompted McGowan
to tell a stockholder at a recent
meeting that MCI stood for
"Money Coming In."
The grey-haired entrepre
neur said MCl's success was
due to it founders' ability to
target goals and to take one
step at a time in founding the
company. These steps in
cluded raising $5 million in
venture capital, lobbying the
government for permission to
go into the business, raising
$115 million to get started, and
winning the anti-trust suit.
Most important, however,
was MCl's obedience to what
McGowan called the funda
mental rule of entrepreneurial
business.
"There is one thingyou can't

do in business, and if you ever
do, you're gone. Never run out
of cash. You can do a lot of
things, but never run out of
cash," he added.
He added that his company
never doubted its ability to
survive.
"We have great confidence
in ourselves and we're on a
roll. A roll works. Don't go
against anyone on a roll," he
said.
McGowan said his com
pany's willingness to pour mil
lions of dollars into the indus
try for information and
technology sets it apart from
AT&T.
"I don't see how they're
going to stay around," he said.
"They're not investing. We are.
We're investing $70 million a
month, they haven't invested
$70 million in five years."
He said the failure of AT&T to
invest has led to an outdated
telephone service.
"It is an industry of copper
wire. It is archaic. Bell's (Bell
Telephone) biggest challenge
is to develop new services,
new ways of communication.
AT&T hasn't let them use their
money to do this," he said.
"Bell operations will survive
and do very well despite them

selves," he said, "but if they
don't start spending money on
high technology, they are
going to be hurt."
Although McGowan cred
ited the local telephone indus
try with allowing MCI to grow
and become a factor in the
telecommunications industry,
the company plans to bypass
local telephone operating ser
vices. McGowan said his pri
mary interest is long distance.
"I want local telephone to
become more efficient, and
they (Bell Telephone) better
realize that if they don't I can
go around them. But I don't
want to be in the local tele
phone business," he said. "I
want to be in the long distance
business."
The divestiture of AT&T must
begin by January 1, 1984 and
Pacific Bell Telephone must
provide to MCI by September
1985 connection lines and ser
vices equivalent to those it
provides to AT&T.
"This window into the tele
communications industry is
going to close one of these
days, and when I get in, I'm
going to reach back and close it
up," he said.
