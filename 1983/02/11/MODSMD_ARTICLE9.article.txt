## BUG ME 
### 
First-week response to "Bug Me" having
been overwhelmingly positive (i.e., no one
complained), I'll now be appearing weekly.
As long as you keep asking questions, any
way. So here we go:
The Daily, like other local newspapers, car
ried several stories last quarter about local
residents coming in to identify and reclaim
their property from the several million dollars
of stolen belongings recovered from Robert
O'Connor.
I'd be very interested to hear an author
itative answer as to what will happen with the
probably rather large fraction of O'Connor's
loot that will not be reclaimed by any owners.
My memory from a news story on another
burglary earlier last year is that unclaimed
property will have to be returned to
O'Connor, and then will become legally his
property. Is this true?

My second week, and already author
itative.
According to Captain Raoul Niemeyer of
the Stanford Police Department, there is a
chance that, in the normal course of events,
unclaimed property would be returned to
O'Connor. The decision will rest with the
judge in the case. However, there are several
complicating factors in this already rather
Byzantine affair.
First, according to Niemeyer, the Stanford
Police Department is planning to make a spe
cial request to the judge that any property
O'Connor obtained illegally be returned to
the people of Santa Clara County. They
would ask that the property be sold and the
proceeds given to the county. The depart
ment is also going to ask to be reimbursed for
their storage costs — the Stanford police will
be responsible for storing the property until
there is a result in the O'Connor trial, and
Niemeyer said those costs are quite a burden
for the department. He hopes they could be
repaid out of the sale of the property.
Second, several of the victims may decide
to file a class action suit against O'Connor, on
more or less the same grounds — that he
should not have stolen property returned to
him.
No one knows exactly how much of the
property has been reclaimed so far, but
Niemeyer said about one-third would be his
guess. People are still coming in to examine
the goods, both burglary victims the depart
ment missed the first timearound and people
who came in before and couldn't see ev
erything because, in Niemeyer's words, "it
was such a mess in there." Now that some of
the property has been removed, he said, the
department has been able to spread things
around for better viewing.
Burglary victims will be able to claim prop
erty until O'Connor is acquitted or con
victed, according to Niemeyer. The trial is

scheduled to begin next month.
Moving on to a really big issue:
What kind of cheese is in the Food Service
bleu cheese dressingf And how can they call
it bleu cheese?
Raster Beaton
I of course checked this question out with
reliable sources before lowering myself to
asking it. A fellow Daily editor claimed that
when people in the dorms want bleu cheese,
they use the "Ranch Style" dressing instead.
The bleu cheese is a bit too "tangy," he said.
With that in mind, I called Food Service.
Office Assistant Janet Pratt in the central of
fice provided me with the following informa
tion: the bleu cheese dressing used by Food
Service is made by Kraft, and it's called
Crumbled Bleu Cheese Dressing. The same
brand is served in all the halls (apparently this
isn't true of all foods). She said the com
missary has received no other complaints re
garding the dressing (not that I was really
complaining, you understand — I guess guilt
is the journalist's burden) and, according to
the commissary, "usually a lot of the dressing
is eaten up."
So who do I believe? Keep an eye on the
Daily next week for more developments in
the bleu cheese dressing controversy.
Did you know that the Daily Califomian
[UC-Berkeley's student newspaper - Ed.] is
selling copies of your fake issue of the Daily
Cal for $5 each?
Anonymous Weenie
No, we didn't. (A Cal student really did call
us up with this tip.) With suitably righteous in
dignation, I placed a call to the Daily Califor
nian offices and demanded satisfaction.
Actually, the first thing I did was simply ask
whether copies were being sold. I was told
they were, that the price was $5, and that I
should go to the second floor of 46 Shattuck
Square in Berkeley (the Daily Cal business of
fice).
Next stop was Dan Woo, Daily Cal editor.
He confirmed that copies of the fake issue
had been sold, but wasn't sure if there were
any left. (He said there weren't that many to
begin with.) To the crucial question of wheth
er or not new copies were printed by the Dai
ly Cal, he replied no, they only had copies
they had managed to collect around campus
last November after we distributed them.
The next crucial question was, what did
they plan to do with the money? Well, you
may not believe this. I sure didn't at first. But
apparently it's true: the entire proceeds from
the sale will be donated tocharity in the name
of the Stanford Daily. There's egg in our face,
all right. Woo said that when all the copies
have been sold, the Daily Cal will be calling us
to ask what charity we prefer.
Don't forget: on this side of the Bay, you
can get your copy of the fake Daily Cal for $1
in the business office of the Stanford Dally.
