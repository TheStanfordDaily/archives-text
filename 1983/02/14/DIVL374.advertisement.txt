AMAZING
NEW CANCER
OPERATION
UNVEILED.
The doctor doesn't
cutout anything. You
cut out cigarettes.
This simple surgery is
the surest way to save
you from lung cancer.
And the American
Cancer Society will help
you perform it.
We have free clinics
to help you quit
smoking. So, before
you smoke another
cigarette, call the A.C.S.
office nearest you.
And don't put it off.
The longer you keep
smoking, the sooner it
can kill you.
