# Research overhead debated
## 
### 
The issue of indirect cost recovery -government pay
ment of the overhead costs of research - is both ex
tremely complicated and tremendously significant to the
University. Administrators must weigh the benefits of
recovering fully all costs associated with research against
the danger that an increase in the overhead recovery rate
could have negative repercussions on research here.
This is the first in a three-part series on the subject.

Almost from the beginning, the issue of indirect cost
recovery rates here has pitted researchers against ad
ministrators.
Provost Albert Hastorf recalls his days as a newly ar
rived professor of psychology — and a principal inves
tigator tor federally sponsored research projects. Then,
Hastorf said, he and his colleagues had another name for
indirect cost recovery — "profit," the University's profit.
Others tell of the stormy meetings that seem to follow
nearly every announcement of an increase in the cost
recovery rate. At those meetings, they say, researchers
have habitually ranted and raved about the increases to
administrators who tried to explain why the University
was entitled to recover more money from the federal
government.
Although the anger was seldom long-lasting, re
searchers' frustration was, and continues to be, very
real. They see the University assessing an increasingly
larger tax on their research money, which, they say,
leaves them with less direct federal funding and thus a
lessened capacity for significant research. Most re
cently, as the indirect cost recovery rate has reached 69
percent and threatens to climb substantially higher,
some have worried that researchers here may be priced
out of the market for federal research monies.
The battle has abated a bit this year: among both
faculty and administrators the consensus is that indirect
cost recovery rates cannot increase — not this year, at
least. Top-level administrators are invoking the maxi
mum that "the mission of our faculty is research and
teaching," and it is clear that in next year's operating
budget, for the first time in University history, the indi
rect cost recovery rate will be intentionally held at a level
too low to allow full recovery.
But still there is dissension.
According to a professor here, the University will have
to take further, more all-encompassing action if it wants
to serve the interests of its researchers and keep indirect
cost recovery rates at an acceptably low level.
The problem, says Electrical Engineering Prof. An
thony Siegman, is that only researchers feel the burden
of the high indirect cost recovery rate, even though

spending decisions elsewhere in ihe University affect
that rate. This leaves researchers helpless to bring the
cost recovery rate down and, because non-researchers
have little incentive to cut indirect costs, contributes to
the rapid increase in the rate.
"You've got to pay overhead to really be concerned
about it," Siegman said. Someone studying "low
temperature linguistics" has little notion of what indi
rect costs are and what an increase in the cost recovery
rate means to researchers in engineering and the sci
ences, he said.
On the other hand, according to Siegman, re
searchers become concerned when the Department of
Defense, for example, decides to allocate a lump sum of
$150,000 to a project here, and then more than one-third
of that must go directly to the University to cover indi
rect costs.
"It's a matter of frustration as to what you can get
done," he said.
Siegman, director of the Ginzton Laboratory here, is
the leading advocate of an "overhead for all" approach
to indirect costs. He originally made his proposal in a
lengthy report to the Faculty Senate last November, be
fore the administration made apparent its decision to
hold the cost recovery rate at 69 percent.
The indirect costs in the University, Siegman said in
the proposal, must be covered "entirely be an overhead
rate which is imposed, uiformly, and without exception,
on every direct-cost expenditure in the University ....
"In other words, we must have a policy of 'overhead
forall'inwhich every expenditure of funds would either
be overhead or bear overhead."
Siegman proposes that next year's budget for the En
glish Department, for example, would be immediately
increased by 69 percent. "But every time the department
paid a professor or bought a ream of paper, that expen
diture would be taxed with exactly the same overhead as
comparable expenditures on a sponsored research
project."
Because everyone would have a stake in the system,
Siegman believes, many more people would become
directly aware that if the indirect costs in the University
could be reduced, they would have more money to
spend as they wished.
Without exception, top-level administrators here
praise the intentions behind Siegman's proposal but call
it unworkable.
Hastorf, for one, said he believed there was a much
greater consciousness of the effects of spending deci
sions among those not involved in direct research than
Siegman supposes. "It's a good proposal in what it re
minds us of," he said, "but I don't think enacting it is a
good idea."
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, he said,
considered a similar proposal seriously but did not
adopt it.
