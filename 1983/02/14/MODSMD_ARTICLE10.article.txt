## The 						Stanford Daily Massacre and Israeli report 
### 
What distinguishes Israel from its neighbors is
not that the Israelis or their leaders can do no
wrong but that Israeli democratic processes are
sufficiently strong and the democratic institu
tions of the country are sufficiently well
grounded to allow an independent commission
to investigate wrongdoings and to recommend
the resignation of cabinet-level ministers. Al
though Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin
initially resisted the prospect of an independent
inquiry into the September massacre of Palesti
nian civilians at the Sabra and Chatila refugee
camps, he soon acquiesced to the will of his
cabinet, and the independent commission was
formed.
The Israeli commission released its report last
week, causing an emergency meeting of Begin's
cabinet. The report placed "direct responsibil
ity" for the massacre on the Christian Phalangist
militiamen who attacked the camp, but it gave
"indirect responsibility" to four Israeli generals
and three cabinet members for authorizing the
operation and for not forseeing the possibility
of a massacre. Although Begin and others were
criticized, Defense Minister Ariel Sharon and
army chief of staff Lt. Gen. Rafael Eytan were
singled out for "personal responsibility." The

report called on Sharon either to resign or to be
fired.
The Begin Cabinet voted to accept the judg
ment of the tribunal, voting 16 to one in favor
with only Sharon dissenting. Sharon had re
signed his position as defense minister last
week but is expected to remain in the Cabinet as
a minister without portfolio.
We hope massacres such as those that took
place last September in the Palestinian refugee
camps of West Beirut will never be repeated.
We also would hope the Lebanese government
undertakes an investigation of its own to find
and to punish those individuals who are directly
responsible for the massacre of hundreds of
men, women and children.
We do not desire, however, to see world rec
ognition of the integrity of Israeli institutions
undermined by Begin's lexical sidestepping in
keeping Sharon in the Cabinet as a minister
without portfolio. Perhaps the Israeli invasion
of Lebanon has shown that Israel is no longer
the military underdog of the Middle East, but
the Israeli feeling of remorse over the killings
and the successful dealing with responsibility
has shown that Israel remains a bastion of de
mocracy in a region full of turmoil.
