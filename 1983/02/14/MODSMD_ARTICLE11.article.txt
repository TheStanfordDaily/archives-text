# The
						Hoover mystery solved
## 
### 
Everyone at Stanford is, no doubt,
aware of the existence of the Hoover
Institute. Not everyone, however,
knows a great deal about it. In fact,
it's likely that a great number of
people know nothing more about it
than that it has something to do with
Hoover Tower and that is conserva
tive.
This, until a few days ago, was the
extent of my familiarity. Sure, I knew
that there was such a thing as a
Hoover fellow, but all I knew for cer
tain was that it was someone who
submitted articles to the Daily prais
ing Reagan or condemning Russia. I
believed that the stores of elderly
men running around smoking pipes
and shouting "Leave it to the mar
ket!" and "Creeping socialism!"
were myths.
One day I saw that a Hoover fel
low, Arnold Beichman, was to give a
talk (one in a series of "Tower Talks")
regarding the nine lies about
America. I was curious about these
lies and was also interested in seeing
what a Hoover fellow was like in per
son.
When Beichman entered the
room, I began suspecting that the
Hoover image vyas completely
fraudulent. He looked like an ordi
nary person, not in the least like the
mean-spirited monster that I had
been expecting. As he began to
speak, however, my deepest tears
were confirmed: the stereotype had
validity.
The nine lies that he set out to dis
prove ranged from"America is a fas

cist state" to "America needs a vio
lent revolution," but mainly they
were variations on the"America is a
fascist state" theme. Some of the ar
guments he used are given below.
Beichman first claimed that fas
cism and communism were actually
the same thing. We see here the clas
sical knee-jerk response to the word
"communist." Not only does he
freely interchange the term "com
munism" (an economic idea) with
"totalitarianism" (a political one; the
two do not necessarily co-vary), but
he uses "communist" with the same
connotation that you or I would use
"murdering-sadist-killer-fiend." In
this same vein, he rejects any propo
sals for mutual recognition and co
existence. In fact, although the lec
ture was ostensibly on lies about
America, Beichman spent over half
the time discussing the rottenness of
Yuri Andropov.
He acknowledged that the U.S.
government committed genocide in
its Indian Removal program, but then
pointed out that Stalin had done the
same thing.
He claimed that the protest groups
of the '60s were categorically
anarchists, and that the Weathermen
were heroes among their genera
tion. He criticized these groups be
cause they questioned the aesthetic
and cultural norms of society.
Without explaining why he
thought so, he rejected the positive
feedback theory of arms buildup
(that each country builds more
weapons to counter the other's ad

vantage, thus creating a vicious cy
cle) as ludicrous.
He believed that the academic
community and today's media were
not liberal, but truly leftist, he
thought that "we" were losing the
battle for these cultural institutions.
When asked who he meant by "we,"
Beichman replied, "democracy."
Although he flatly denied that
America was the least bit imperialist,
he acknowledged that Locke's
guaranty of lite, liberty and property
(but especially property), extended
to property "owned" by American
businesses in foreign nations.
If Beichman is not an anomaly,
and the majority of Hoover fellows in
fact share common political and
economic ideologies, then the fact
that Hoover is one of the most "re
spected" of such institutions is in
deed frightening. After realizing that
many Hoover fellows are in the Rea
gan administration (indeed, Ronald
Reagan is an honorary fellow), ques
tions that previously appeared unan
swerable (e.g. why is Reagan escalat
ing the arms race?; why are 12 million
people out of work?; why is Secre
tary of the Interior lames Watt giving
away public lands?; why isn't the En
vironmental Protection Agency
doing its job?; why is ketchup con
sidered a vegetable?) now become
less baffling.
