## Students responsible for personal alcohol use 
### 
Some aspects of the article about
alcohol at Stanford ("University to
discuss dorm alcohol policy," Daily,
lan. 31) were confusing, and we
would like to clarify the views of the
Dean of Student Affairs Committee
on Alcohol:
Concern about the role of alcohol
at events has been expressed by
many students as well as those of us
in staff roles who feel responsible for
the health and safety of Stanford stu
dents.
The article focuses on alcohol in
residences and the role of RAs. The
Committee is looking at the use and
abuse of alcohol by graduate and
undergraduate students, in and out
of residences.
The Daily story said that Residen
tial Education sees RAs as responsi
ble for aspects of students' behavior.
This is not the case. To the contrary,
students are responsible for their
own decisions and behaviors. It is
the RA's job to provide an atmos
phere that supports students'
choices to drink moderately or not to
drink at all.
The University expects students
and staff to know that California state
law prohibits the sale or supply of
alcohol to or consumption by those
under 21. RAs are not expected to be
enforcers of the law or to regulate
students' drinking behavior. RAs are
educators and in that role are ex
pected to increase students' aware
ness of the issues involving the use of
alcohol.
While the article discussed policy
changes, we must underscore the

fact that the committee is not prop
osing any policy changes at this time.
We are still in the process of deter
mining what the issues are regarding
alcohol use at Stanford. Before any
policy changes can be suggested, we
need to know how members of the
Stanford community view alcohol
use.

Cuckoo clock
As a resident of the Cubberley
building I am horrified that the glori
ous vista I enjoyed outside our por
tals has been destroyed by the
placement of a large clock tower and
an accompanying maze of columns.
However, it is an ill-wind that
blows nobody some good. As an ex
patriate Australian I do have a
suggestion about how something
positive could come from this un
pleasantness. The University should
make a concerted effort to raise the
funds needed to import one of our
giant native birds, the emu. It could
be housed in the ample space in the
tower above the timepiece. Stanford
would then make the Guinness Book
of Records as the possessor of the
world's largest cuckoo clock.

Defacing art
Yeah, Brian Sayre, I agree with
you. It's about time someone
painted a face on the Zapata mural.
After all, the artist had a chance to
make his point — why should
people have to look at the head
without a face anymore? While we're
at it, why don't we fix up some of
Picasso's stuff? Didn't he sometimes
put both eyes on the same side of the
nose (if you could even tell it was a
nose)? OK, so he might even tell it was a
on purpose, but most of his paintings
have been reproduced in lots of
books. If anyone is perverse enough
to want to see a distorted face they
can check the book out of the library.
And that's the thing that gets rne
about poetry too. Sure it sounds
pretty, but you have to fill in ideas for
yourself. Why doesn't someone who
knows what they're doing go
through and put in all the words and
ideas the poet misguidedly left out?
Brian Sayre, I think you're just the
man for the job. just do what comes
naturally.

Zero option
Your decision to print the "Zt;ro
Option" cartoon {Daily, Eeb. 9)
demonstrates your ignorance and

your inherent bias against the Rea
gan administration which per
meates your publication. Granted it
is popular to criticize President Re
agan, and it might even increase your
student following. However, occa
sionally you should think before you
print.
The Zero Option would remove all
American and Soviet intermediate
range nuclear missiles from Europe,
and as such it represents an earnest
effort at disarmament on the part of
the Reagan Administration. The
Soviet counter-offer is not one of
disarmament but of deception. They
offer to move their SS-20s away from
Europe if we agree not to deploy the
Pershing Two and Cruise Missiles.
Yet they fail to mention in their pub
lic statements that the SS-20 can hit
Europe from across the Urals, and
would be targetable at lapan and our
Asian allies. Additionally, being a
mobile missle, the SS-20 could be
moved back to Soviet Europe at a
later date, subjecting the West to nu
clear blackmail.
The Reagan proposal does more
than freeze — it reduces. Therefore,
the Zero Option deserves respectful
consideration. I know that expand
ing your circulation facilitates adver
tising and criticizing the Reagan ad
ministration sells well with students,
but won't you for once give the devil
his due?
