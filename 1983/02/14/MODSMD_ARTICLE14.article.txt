## U.S. devastating Nicaragua 
### 
I and a group of 28 persons of di
verse backgrounds and experience
just completed a study tour in the
Caribbean and Central America
under the auspices of Oxfam
America. We spent eight days in the
cities and countryside of Nicaragua,
talking with a cross section of its
people — members of professional
and business sectors, peasants, reli
gious, journalists and representa
tives of neighborhopd associations.
We wish to share our experience be
cause the economic, political and
especially moral well-being of the
United States is jeopardized by
Washington's policies in regard to
Nicaragua.
The devastating impact on
Nicaragua of the 1972 earthquake,
the human and economic cost of the
war against Somoza, the destructive
floods of 1982, the acute drought, the
debt inherited from Somoza and
U.S. action to deny loans or credits
have all created serious hardships.
But we see these adverse factors as
outweighed by the convictions of the
people as a whole that for the first
time in history they control their own
destiny, experience their life in free
dom, are confident in their revolu
tion and determined to see it prog
ress.
The "triumph" occurred in 1979
with the ouster of Somoza, yet the
revolution is being remade daily. Its
problems and errors are visible and
worrisome and are quite candidly
admitted. But our contact with hun
dreds of Nicaraguans has made us
share the people's hopes in their fu
ture. The poor are eating better and
an astonishing 88 percent of them are
now literate. The peasants have free
health care. They have dignity and
confidence. Much as it would help
them they have not asked the United
States to aid them recently, but only
to stop encouraging their enemies
and let them complete the revolution
that has brought them hope of a bet
ter life. Several small sectors are
complaining. The many benefits for
the poor have constrained their
power. Unable to generate wide
spread support at home, they receive
the greatest hearing outside
Nicaragua, especially in the United
States.
Allying itself with the most back
ward and violent sectors, the United
States has concentrated on de

stabilizing the Nicaraguan govern
ment. Thousands of Somoza's
guards and other mercenaries, fi
nanced and trained directly or indi
rectly by the United States, wage a
border war from Honduras. Instead
of encouraging Nicaragua's efforts to
maintain a strong private sector in
the face of economic and natural dis
asters, the United States has coordi
nated a financial blockade. De
stabilization is the direct goal, but
what shocked us was the cost in
human terms. While we were in
Nicaragua, more than 25 armed con
frontations occurred at the Hondu
ran border with both youth volun
teers and army members killed.
The day our group arrived in Es
telli, a city whose stuccoed walls are
pockmarked with spots of white plas
ter that fill bullet holes from strafing
by Somoza's planes, the community
was receiving the corpses of two of
its youth. Nicaraguan army members
killed at the border. "We struggle
against the Yankee, enemy of Hu
manity," go the words of the San
dinista hymn. Yet we were welcomed
to Estelli with applause and embrace
s."We know the people of the
United States are not the same as its
government," they told us.
The counterrevolutionaries seek
to stop harvesting of the coffee crop
that earns scarce dollars, to force
hundreds of families to migrate from
this rich agricultural region, and to
demoralize the army. The response,
however, is quite different.
Thousands of Nicaraguans have
headed north to defend their revolu
tion. High school children have
foregone vacations to bring in the
coffee crop, farmers continue to har
vest, guns strapped to their backs.
They can do so because in all of Cent
ral America this is the only govern
ment that does not fear to let its
people carry arms.
The military threat from the north
is not only a source of daily grief but
economic loss as well. The need to
maintain an armed militia and the
obstruction of the coffee and to
bacco harvesting have created
enormous strains. We in the United
States are all too familiar with the
burden an outsized military budget
imposes on the poor. In Nicaragua,
80 percent of the people are poor.
Nicaragua is at a crossroads, and
U.S. policy will strongly influence

the direction in which it moves. It still
has one of the most stable
economies in that region. It has not
defaulted on any foreign debt since
the revolution, and it is committed to
maintaining a private sector that ac
counts for 60 percent of the eco
nomy. It is U.S. provocation that
forces Nicaragua to increase its de
fense spending. The recently an
nounced 6000 man joint Honduran-
U.S. military exercises on the Hon
duran border constitute a clear
statement about current U.S.
stategy. It is both immoral and coun
terproductive.
As the time for our visit drew near
some of us had reservations about
visiting Nicaragua, given the escalat
ing tensions along the Honduran
border and the widely reported
paramilitary training of Somocistas in
the United States. This was a countr\
after all, which the U.S. government
viewed as unstable, revolutionary,
Marxist-leaning pawn in the Last
West chess game. But as we traveled
in Nicaragua, we lost our sense of
personal risk. What is at risk here is
America's own self-interest.
U.S. policy in this region is incon
sistent with the principles for which
we as a nation stand, a threat to our
national security, and contrary to our
long-term economic interests. The
insertion of an economic or militjrv ,
presence does not promote out
political goals. Rather than criticizing
those who aid Nicaragua, the United
States should join other nations of
the world in encouraging self
directed development. Rather than
working to destabilize Nicaragua,
the U.S. government must finally
recognize that only stability through
self-determination serves long-term
U.S. interests.
As concerned citizens with a first
hand experience in Nicaragua, we
call on the U.S. government to cease
all support of the counterrevolu
tionaries, to cancel its war game in
Honduras, and transfer its influence
and financial support from the pro
motion of destabilization to the
promotion of a stable pluralistic eco
nomy capable of fulfilling the needs
of the people of Nicaragua.

viewed as unstable, revolutionary,
Marxist-leaning pawn in the Last
West chess game. But as we traveled
in Nicaragua, we lost our sense of
personal risk. What is at risk here is
America's own self-interest.
U.S. policy in this region is incon
sistent with the principles for which
we as a nation stand, a threat to our
national security, and contrary to our
long-term economic interests. The
insertion of an economic or militjrv ,
presence does not promote out
political goals. Rather than criticizing
those who aid Nicaragua, the United
States should join other nations of
the world in encouraging self
directed development. Rather than
working to destabilize Nicaragua,
the U.S. government must finally
recognize that only stability through
self-determination serves long-term
U.S. interests.
As concerned citizens with a first
hand experience in Nicaragua, we
call on the U.S. government to cease
all support of the counterrevolu
tionaries, to cancel its war game in
Honduras, and transfer its influence
and financial support from the pro
motion of destabilization to the
promotion of a stable pluralistic eco
nomy capable of fulfilling the needs
of the people of Nicaragua.

I and a group of 28 persons of di
verse backgrounds and experience
just completed a study tour in the
Caribbean and Central America
under the auspices of Oxfam
America. We spent eight days in the
cities and countryside of Nicaragua,
talking with a cross section of its
people — members of professional
and business sectors, peasants, reli
gious, journalists and representa
tives of neighborhopd associations.
We wish to share our experience be
cause the economic, political and
especially moral well-being of the
United States is jeopardized by
Washington's policies in regard to
Nicaragua.
The devastating impact on
Nicaragua of the 1972 earthquake,
the human and economic cost of the
war against Somoza, the destructive
floods of 1982, the acute drought, the
debt inherited from Somoza and
U.S. action to deny loans or credits
have all created serious hardships.
But we see these adverse factors as
outweighed by the convictions of the
people as a whole that for the first
time in history they control their own
destiny, experience their life in free
dom, are confident in their revolu
tion and determined to see it prog
ress.
The "triumph" occurred in 1979
with the ouster of Somoza, yet the
revolution is being remade daily. Its
problems and errors are visible and
worrisome and are quite candidly
admitted. But our contact with hun
dreds of Nicaraguans has made us
share the people's hopes in their fu
ture. The poor are eating better and
an astonishing 88 percent of them are
now literate. The peasants have free
health care. They have dignity and
confidence. Much as it would help
them they have not asked the United
States to aid them recently, but only
to stop encouraging their enemies
and let them complete the revolution
that has brought them hope of a bet
ter life. Several small sectors are
complaining. The many benefits for
the poor have constrained their
power. Unable to generate wide
spread support at home, they receive
the greatest hearing outside
Nicaragua, especially in the United
States.
Allying itself with the most back
ward and violent sectors, the United
States has concentrated on de

stabilizing the Nicaraguan govern
ment. Thousands of Somoza's
guards and other mercenaries, fi
nanced and trained directly or indi
rectly by the United States, wage a
border war from Honduras. Instead
of encouraging Nicaragua's efforts to
maintain a strong private sector in
the face of economic and natural dis
asters, the United States has coordi
nated a financial blockade. De
stabilization is the direct goal, but
what shocked us was the cost in
human terms. While we were in
Nicaragua, more than 25 armed con
frontations occurred at the Hondu
ran border with both youth volun
teers and army members killed.
The day our group arrived in Es
telli, a city whose stuccoed walls are
pockmarked with spots of white plas
ter that fill bullet holes from strafing
by Somoza's planes, the community
was receiving the corpses of two of
its youth. Nicaraguan army members
killed at the border. "We struggle
against the Yankee, enemy of Hu
manity," go the words of the San
dinista hymn. Yet we were welcomed
to Estelli with applause and embrace
s."We know the people of the
United States are not the same as its
government," they told us.
The counterrevolutionaries seek
to stop harvesting of the coffee crop
that earns scarce dollars, to force
hundreds of families to migrate from
this rich agricultural region, and to
demoralize the army. The response,
however, is quite different.
Thousands of Nicaraguans have
headed north to defend their revolu
tion. High school children have
foregone vacations to bring in the
coffee crop, farmers continue to har
vest, guns strapped to their backs.
They can do so because in all of Cent
ral America this is the only govern
ment that does not fear to let its
people carry arms.
The military threat from the north
is not only a source of daily grief but
economic loss as well. The need to
maintain an armed militia and the
obstruction of the coffee and to
bacco harvesting have created
enormous strains. We in the United
States are all too familiar with the
burden an outsized military budget
imposes on the poor. In Nicaragua,
80 percent of the people are poor.
Nicaragua is at a crossroads, and
U.S. policy will strongly influence

the direction in which it moves. It still
has one of the most stable
economies in that region. It has not
defaulted on any foreign debt since
the revolution, and it is committed to
maintaining a private sector that ac
counts for 60 percent of the eco
nomy. It is U.S. provocation that
forces Nicaragua to increase its de
fense spending. The recently an
nounced 6000 man joint Honduran-
U.S. military exercises on the Hon
duran border constitute a clear
statement about current U.S.
stategy. It is both immoral and coun
terproductive.
As the time for our visit drew near
some of us had reservations about
visiting Nicaragua, given the escalat
ing tensions along the Honduran
border and the widely reported
paramilitary training of Somocistas in
the United States. This was a countr\
after all, which the U.S. government
viewed as unstable, revolutionary,
Marxist-leaning pawn in the Last
