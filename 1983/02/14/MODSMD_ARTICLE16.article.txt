# Interview tensions mount
## 
### BRUCE FINLEY 
In a relaxed college environment, job inter
viewing with business tirms seems particularly
tense. During the recruiting season, waiting
rooms at the Career Planning and Placement
Center and the Business School Placement Cen
ter are full Job seekers anxiously review
planned responses to anticipated questions.
Seriousness prevails. There are aggressive
stare-downs. Competition is great for limited
opportunities. It is a flourishing world of ap
pearances, of the traditional blue suit, the re
sume and the first impression. Those who
triumph in this rigorous process of selection
become part of an annual harvest of young ex
ecutives. There are some, however, who abstain
from the competition altogether. Stanford
senior Mike Mulcahy stated flatly, "Looking for
a job is a full-time job. I don't have time for it."
Howard Sewell, a senior economics major
seeking employment iri business, commented
on the interviewing process. "I'm confident,"
he said, "but the competition here on campus is
immense." Especially for "popular positions
like investment banking," explained Sewell,
"there are a lot of good people interviewing."
It is widely accepted that earning an MBA de-

gree dramatically enhances both the quality and
quantity of jobs available in business. In spite of
a generally sluggish economy, Stanford MBA
graduates typically can choose from numerous
interested firms. In 1981, 202 firms completed
over 3600 campus interviews. "I think that most
people find that the degree has been really help
ful for them," said Rick Johnson, director of
placement for the Business School. Johnson
stressed that the real advantage of the MBA de
gree is a greater potential for advancement to
higher level positions "three or four years down
the line."
But Chris Shinkman, director of the Career
Planning and Placement Center, is optimistic
about the extent of jobs available for those
without the MBA. "Some employers have said
that they would just as soon hire somebody with
just the B.A. degree, because they can hire them
for less money," said Shinkman.
Whatever are their chances of success, hun
dreds of senior and MBA's are taking interviews
very seriously. A generation earlier, when
forced into formal attire, Mick Jagger lamented
"creases as sharp as knives." Today such for
malities are accepted as a necessary part of get
ting ahead in the world.
