Relations between a man and a
ivoman are always strange: No
thing can be for seen, they have no
predictable direction, no law.
Sometimes you come to a dead end,
where there is nothing to do but sit
down and weep; All the words have
been said, and to nn purpose; All
the Arguments have been thought
of, ana shattered. But then some
times, at a chance look or word, the
wall doesn't start to crack, but sim
ply melts away. And where there
was nothing but darkness, a clear
path appears again, where two
people can walk. Just a path -
perhpas only for a moment.
-Aleksandrl. Solzhenitsyn

Michael B. Cox,
The mustache-rider strikes again
with a Valentine poem for you
Because you are such a deviant
and so damn good at what you do!
You're a lover, teaser, apleaser.
You bring out the beast in me!
And what you do with the velvet
rope
Is what kinky was meant to be
So tonight when we get together
To play with rubber and plastics
Remember, a mustche riae is
Pari of our bedroom gymnastics!

T'was 2 am at CF.RAS, when I spied
three carrels down;
Struggling with F.macs, the cutest
hacker in this town.
We set a date, it ivas our fate, and
I've never looked back since.
You sure knew what buttons to
push;
falling in loi'e was just a cinch.
That was long ago - our love's still
strong, ever thickening.
We are such a happy couple, it is
almost sickening
But seriously John, I couldn't func
tion without you.
you're in my heart anil in my soul,
you 're even in my CPU.
and for all you lonely hackers,
here's a lesson for you all:

Our love still endures
We've had fun times,

Through it all you still stand
As my only sweet Pooky.
Your devotion to me
i don't mean to taint
But I do have one
Unanswered complaint
Although you joke
And brand me as loose,
That still is no reason
To call me a "moose"

From a land that's 6 foot under
Or yelling Swami in Morocco
Real jerks love rock and plunder
Ready to RFZ the world and go
Over to D-wing for bedtime tales
Below we go for status w/swing
Loving nuns, missing the whales
Enchanted by male aing-a-lings
Hailing to Frisco, dancing tea
All women on top and on bottom
Laying in the middle is to be
Like ... it just doesn't matter

To the beach, just you and me,
we traveled one warm winter day.
Casting our cars to the wind,
splashing about in the bay
Like the sea my love runs deep,
my heart is lost within you
Your soft brown eyes inside me
burn,
a fire Jorever will keep
I try to say how I feel
a task mere words annol do
Instead a touch, a tender kiss,
a caress yes. I line you -JB

perched under the mistletoe in

first kiss from me. Now some things
are different, some are the same as
before. I still kiss you though there's
no flower above the door. But for all

Relations between a man and a
ivoman are always strange: No
thing can be for seen, they have no
predictable direction, no law.
Sometimes you come to a dead end,
where there is nothing to do but sit
down and weep; All the words have
been said, and to nn purpose; All
the Arguments have been thought
of, ana shattered. But then some
times, at a chance look or word, the
wall doesn't start to crack, but sim
ply melts away. And where there
was nothing but darkness, a clear
path appears again, where two
people can walk. Just a path -
perhpas only for a moment.

Because you are such a deviant
and so damn good at what you do!
You're a lover, teaser, apleaser.
You bring out the beast in me!
And what you do with the velvet

Is what kinky was meant to be
So tonight when we get together
To play with rubber and plastics
Remember, a mustche riae is

Relations between a man and a
ivoman are always strange: No
thing can be for seen, they have no
predictable direction, no law.
Sometimes you come to a dead end,
where there is nothing to do but sit
down and weep; All the words have
been said, and to nn purpose; All
the Arguments have been thought
of, ana shattered. But then some
times, at a chance look or word, the
wall doesn't start to crack, but sim
ply melts away. And where there
was nothing but darkness, a clear
path appears again, where two
people can walk. Just a path -
perhpas only for a moment.
-Aleksandrl. Solzhenitsyn

Michael B. Cox,
The mustache-rider strikes again
with a Valentine poem for you
Because you are such a deviant
and so damn good at what you do!
You're a lover, teaser, apleaser.
You bring out the beast in me!
And what you do with the velvet
rope
Is what kinky was meant to be
So tonight when we get together
To play with rubber and plastics
Remember, a mustche riae is
Pari of our bedroom gymnastics!

T'was 2 am at CF.RAS, when I spied
three carrels down;
Struggling with F.macs, the cutest
hacker in this town.
We set a date, it ivas our fate, and
I've never looked back since.
You sure knew what buttons to
push;
falling in loi'e was just a cinch.
That was long ago - our love's still
strong, ever thickening.
We are such a happy couple, it is
almost sickening
But seriously John, I couldn't func
tion without you.
you're in my heart anil in my soul,
you 're even in my CPU.
and for all you lonely hackers,
here's a lesson for you all:
Bejore you search too fat for love,
first check out the nearby stall.

After more than two years
Our love still endures
We've had fun times,
A nd many a shooky.
Through it all you still stand
As my only sweet Pooky.
Your devotion to me
i don't mean to taint
But I do have one
Unanswered complaint
Although you joke
And brand me as loose,
That still is no reason
To call me a "moose"

Relations between a man and a
ivoman are always strange: No
thing can be for seen, they have no
predictable direction, no law.
Sometimes you come to a dead end,
where there is nothing to do but sit
down and weep; All the words have
been said, and to nn purpose; All
the Arguments have been thought
of, ana shattered. But then some
times, at a chance look or word, the
wall doesn't start to crack, but sim
ply melts away. And where there
was nothing but darkness, a clear
path appears again, where two
people can walk. Just a path -
perhpas only for a moment.

The mustache-rider strikes again
with a Valentine poem for you
Because you are such a deviant
and so damn good at what you do!
You're a lover, teaser, apleaser.
You bring out the beast in me!
And what you do with the velvet
rope
Is what kinky was meant to be
So tonight when we get together
To play with rubber and plastics
Remember, a mustche riae is
Pari of our bedroom gymnastics!

T'was 2 am at CF.RAS, when I spied
three carrels down;
Struggling with F.macs, the cutest
hacker in this town.
We set a date, it ivas our fate, and
I've never looked back since.
You sure knew what buttons to
push;
falling in loi'e was just a cinch.
That was long ago - our love's still
strong, ever thickening.
We are such a happy couple, it is
almost sickening
But seriously John, I couldn't func
tion without you.
you're in my heart anil in my soul,
you 're even in my CPU.
and for all you lonely hackers,
here's a lesson for you all:
Bejore you search too fat for love,

We've had fun times,

Through it all you still stand
As my only sweet Pooky.

i don't mean to taint
But I do have one
Unanswered complaint
Although you joke
And brand me as loose,
That still is no reason
To call me a "moose"

Relations between a man and a
ivoman are always strange: No
thing can be for seen, they have no
predictable direction, no law.
Sometimes you come to a dead end,
where there is nothing to do but sit
down and weep; All the words have
been said, and to nn purpose; All
the Arguments have been thought
of, ana shattered. But then some
times, at a chance look or word, the
wall doesn't start to crack, but sim
ply melts away. And where there
was nothing but darkness, a clear
path appears again, where two
people can walk. Just a path -
perhpas only for a moment.
-Aleksandrl. Solzhenitsyn

Because you are such a deviant
and so damn good at what you do!
You're a lover, teaser, apleaser.
You bring out the beast in me!
And what you do with the velvet

Is what kinky was meant to be
So tonight when we get together
To play with rubber and plastics
Remember, a mustche riae is

Or yelling Swami in Morocco
Real jerks love rock and plunder
Ready to RFZ the world and go
Over to D-wing for bedtime tales
Below we go for status w/swing

Enchanted by male aing-a-lings
Hailing to Frisco, dancing tea

To the beach, just you and me,
we traveled one warm winter day.
Casting our cars to the wind,
splashing about in the bay
Like the sea my love runs deep,
my heart is lost within you
Your soft brown eyes inside me
burn,
a fire Jorever will keep
I try to say how I feel
a task mere words annol do
Instead a touch, a tender kiss,
a caress yes. I line you -JB

before. I still kiss you though there's
no flower above the door. But for all

Relations between a man and a
ivoman are always strange: No
thing can be for seen, they have no
predictable direction, no law.
Sometimes you come to a dead end,
where there is nothing to do but sit
down and weep; All the words have
been said, and to nn purpose; All
the Arguments have been thought
of, ana shattered. But then some
times, at a chance look or word, the
wall doesn't start to crack, but sim
ply melts away. And where there
was nothing but darkness, a clear
path appears again, where two
people can walk. Just a path -
perhpas only for a moment.

Because you are such a deviant

You're a lover, teaser, apleaser.
You bring out the beast in me!
And what you do with the velvet

Is what kinky was meant to be
So tonight when we get together
To play with rubber and plastics
Remember, a mustche riae is

That was long ago - our love's still
strong, ever thickening.
We are such a happy couple, it is
almost sickening
But seriously John, I couldn't func

So sweet and so pure.
After more than two years
Our love still endures
We've had fun times,
A nd many a shooky.
Through it all you still stand
As my only sweet Pooky.

But I do have one
Unanswered complaint
Although you joke
And brand me as loose,
That still is no reason
To call me a "moose"

Relations between a man and a
ivoman are always strange: No
thing can be for seen, they have no
predictable direction, no law.
Sometimes you come to a dead end,
where there is nothing to do but sit
down and weep; All the words have
been said, and to nn purpose; All
the Arguments have been thought
of, ana shattered. But then some
times, at a chance look or word, the
wall doesn't start to crack, but sim
ply melts away. And where there
was nothing but darkness, a clear
path appears again, where two
people can walk. Just a path -
perhpas only for a moment.

Michael B. Cox,
The mustache-rider strikes again
with a Valentine poem for you
Because you are such a deviant
and so damn good at what you do!
You're a lover, teaser, apleaser.
You bring out the beast in me!
And what you do with the velvet
rope
Is what kinky was meant to be
So tonight when we get together
To play with rubber and plastics
Remember, a mustche riae is
Pari of our bedroom gymnastics!

T'was 2 am at CF.RAS, when I spied
three carrels down;
Struggling with F.macs, the cutest
hacker in this town.
We set a date, it ivas our fate, and
I've never looked back since.
You sure knew what buttons to
push;
falling in loi'e was just a cinch.
That was long ago - our love's still
strong, ever thickening.
We are such a happy couple, it is
almost sickening
But seriously John, I couldn't func
tion without you.
you're in my heart anil in my soul,
you 're even in my CPU.
and for all you lonely hackers,
here's a lesson for you all:
Bejore you search too fat for love,
first check out the nearby stall.

After more than two years
Our love still endures
We've had fun times,
A nd many a shooky.
Through it all you still stand
As my only sweet Pooky.
Your devotion to me
i don't mean to taint
But I do have one
Unanswered complaint
Although you joke
And brand me as loose,
That still is no reason
To call me a "moose"

Relations between a man and a
ivoman are always strange: No
thing can be for seen, they have no
predictable direction, no law.
Sometimes you come to a dead end,
where there is nothing to do but sit
down and weep; All the words have
been said, and to nn purpose; All
the Arguments have been thought
of, ana shattered. But then some
times, at a chance look or word, the
wall doesn't start to crack, but sim
ply melts away. And where there
was nothing but darkness, a clear
path appears again, where two
people can walk. Just a path -
perhpas only for a moment.

The mustache-rider strikes again

Because you are such a deviant
and so damn good at what you do!
You're a lover, teaser, apleaser.
You bring out the beast in me!
And what you do with the velvet
rope
Is what kinky was meant to be
So tonight when we get together
To play with rubber and plastics
Remember, a mustche riae is
Pari of our bedroom gymnastics!

T'was 2 am at CF.RAS, when I spied
three carrels down;
Struggling with F.macs, the cutest

We set a date, it ivas our fate, and
I've never looked back since.
You sure knew what buttons to
push;
falling in loi'e was just a cinch.
That was long ago - our love's still
strong, ever thickening.
We are such a happy couple, it is
almost sickening
But seriously John, I couldn't func
tion without you.
you're in my heart anil in my soul,
you 're even in my CPU.

We've had fun times,

Through it all you still stand
As my only sweet Pooky.

But I do have one
Unanswered complaint
Although you joke
And brand me as loose,
That still is no reason
To call me a "moose"
