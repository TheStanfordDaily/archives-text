Chavez scored 24 points, 18
in the second half, hitting his
last eight shots trom the floor
in keying the Cal comeback.
The Bears, now 4-6 in the
conference and 11-9 overall,
led 63-58 with 37 seconds re
maining before Brown almost
pulled off another miracle Big
Came finish. Cal's Butch Hays
missed the front end of a one
a n d - on e opportunity and
Brown came down and cooly
fired in a 20-footer from the
right side to bring Stanford to
within three with 28 seconds
left.
Brown stole the ensuing in
bounds pass and laid it in to
make the score 63-62. Chavez
then rattled in two toul shots
after being fouled intentionally
b\ lones, giving Cal a 65-62 ad
vantage with 13 seconds left.
Brown pumped in a 21-
footer from almost the same
spot as before five seconds
later to make the deficit one
again, but the Cardinal did not
foul Darrell Haley until just two
seconds showed on the c lock.
Haley missed the second free
throw after making his first,
Kent Sevmour grabbed the re
bound and hurled a long pass
intended tor Keith (ones over
his head and out of bounds as
the final horn sounded.
"*sfeve hit two nice lumpers
down the stretch, Davis said
of Brown. He's to be con
gratulated for hitting those
shots. It he keeps working,
he's going to become a very
fine player. He is still making

the transition to guard.'
Chavez, just two-of-nine at
halttime, caught tire after in
termission, and alter missing
his first two shots in the second
half, did not miss again as the
Bears turned a Ib-il halttime
deficit into a 41-40 lead with
12:54 remaining.
He's really a nice player
Stanford coach Tom Davis said
of Chavez. "I like him a lot. He
showed his class by sticking
with it and getting his shots
down the stretch when they
took control of the game
"We were trying, we were
trying," Davis said about the
effort to increase defensive
pressure on Chavez. "Rut he's
awfully quick We would have
liked to have given him much
more pressure than we did.
Butch Hays, the other Cal
guard, also had a hand in the
Bears' reversal of fortune in the
second period, and finished
with 1b points, five assists and
four steals.
"Hays made some crucial
shots in the stretch when thev
turned it around, too Davis
said. Chavez and Havs might
be as fine a pair of defensive
guards in the league, in the way
that they get up and get after
you."
The Cardinal was plagued bv
turnovers throughout the
game, committing 25 on the
night, including two crucial
ones within ten seconds which
allowed Cal to attain its five
point lead with just over a min
ute remaining.
Stanford also missed the
front ends of one-and-one foul
shot opportunities two con
secutive times v\hen the Bears
were assuming control.
"We're just trying to think of
the positive things." Davi
said. We know we re not
there vet. We gave a good et
fort, and we have to think
about what we're going to have
to do to get better.'
Despite being shorter at
every front line position the
Cardinal outrebounded the
Bears bv a 32-24 margin. And
center Michael Pitts, the Bears
leading scorer and rebounder,

was held in check bv a tough
collapsing Cardinal zone,
finishing with just eight points.
Cal shot just i2 percent in
the first hall and fell behind
24-I4 with 5:51 left in the first

range on 56 percent ot their

A heroic effort by Steve
Brown was offset b\ the deadly
outside shooting of Cal guard
Michael C havez in the second
halt as the Bears hung on for a
thrilling come-from-behind
66-b4 Pacific-10 Conference
basketball victory over Stan
ford at Maples Pavilion.
Brown scored a career-high
16 points on seven-of-eight
shooting from the floor, in
cluding three field goals in the
final 30 seconds that almost
won it lor the Cardinal, nov\ 4-6
in the Pac-10 and 12-8 overall.
Chavez scored 24 points, 18
in the second half, hitting his
last eight shots trom the floor
in keying the Cal comeback.
The Bears, now 4-6 in the
conference and 11-9 overall,
led 63-58 with 37 seconds re
maining before Brown almost
pulled off another miracle Big
Came finish. Cal's Butch Hays
missed the front end of a one
a n d - on e opportunity and
Brown came down and cooly
fired in a 20-footer from the
right side to bring Stanford to
within three with 28 seconds
left.
Brown stole the ensuing in
bounds pass and laid it in to
make the score 63-62. Chavez
then rattled in two toul shots
after being fouled intentionally
b\ lones, giving Cal a 65-62 ad
vantage with 13 seconds left.
Brown pumped in a 21-
footer from almost the same
spot as before five seconds
later to make the deficit one
again, but the Cardinal did not
foul Darrell Haley until just two
seconds showed on the c lock.
Haley missed the second free
throw after making his first,
Kent Sevmour grabbed the re
bound and hurled a long pass
intended tor Keith (ones over
his head and out of bounds as
the final horn sounded.
"*sfeve hit two nice lumpers
down the stretch, Davis said
of Brown. He's to be con
gratulated for hitting those
shots. It he keeps working,
he's going to become a very
fine player. He is still making

the transition to guard.'
Chavez, just two-of-nine at
halttime, caught tire after in
termission, and alter missing
his first two shots in the second
half, did not miss again as the
Bears turned a Ib-il halttime
deficit into a 41-40 lead with
12:54 remaining.
He's really a nice player
Stanford coach Tom Davis said
of Chavez. "I like him a lot. He
showed his class by sticking
with it and getting his shots
down the stretch when they
took control of the game
"We were trying, we were
trying," Davis said about the
effort to increase defensive
pressure on Chavez. "Rut he's
awfully quick We would have
liked to have given him much
more pressure than we did.
Butch Hays, the other Cal
guard, also had a hand in the
Bears' reversal of fortune in the
second period, and finished
with 1b points, five assists and
four steals.
"Hays made some crucial
shots in the stretch when thev
turned it around, too Davis
said. Chavez and Havs might
be as fine a pair of defensive
guards in the league, in the way
that they get up and get after
you."
The Cardinal was plagued bv
turnovers throughout the
game, committing 25 on the
night, including two crucial
ones within ten seconds which
allowed Cal to attain its five
point lead with just over a min
ute remaining.
Stanford also missed the
front ends of one-and-one foul
shot opportunities two con
secutive times v\hen the Bears
were assuming control.
"We're just trying to think of
the positive things." Davi
said. We know we re not
there vet. We gave a good et
fort, and we have to think
about what we're going to have
to do to get better.'

A heroic effort by Steve
Brown was offset b\ the deadly
outside shooting of Cal guard
Michael C havez in the second
halt as the Bears hung on for a
thrilling come-from-behind
66-b4 Pacific-10 Conference
basketball victory over Stan
ford at Maples Pavilion.
Brown scored a career-high
16 points on seven-of-eight
shooting from the floor, in
cluding three field goals in the
final 30 seconds that almost
won it lor the Cardinal, nov\ 4-6
in the Pac-10 and 12-8 overall.
Chavez scored 24 points, 18
in the second half, hitting his
last eight shots trom the floor
in keying the Cal comeback.
The Bears, now 4-6 in the
conference and 11-9 overall,
led 63-58 with 37 seconds re
maining before Brown almost
pulled off another miracle Big
Came finish. Cal's Butch Hays
missed the front end of a one
a n d - on e opportunity and
Brown came down and cooly
fired in a 20-footer from the
right side to bring Stanford to
within three with 28 seconds
left.
Brown stole the ensuing in
bounds pass and laid it in to
make the score 63-62. Chavez
then rattled in two toul shots
after being fouled intentionally
b\ lones, giving Cal a 65-62 ad
vantage with 13 seconds left.
Brown pumped in a 21-
footer from almost the same
spot as before five seconds
later to make the deficit one
again, but the Cardinal did not
foul Darrell Haley until just two
seconds showed on the c lock.
Haley missed the second free
throw after making his first,
Kent Sevmour grabbed the re
bound and hurled a long pass
intended tor Keith (ones over
his head and out of bounds as
the final horn sounded.
"*sfeve hit two nice lumpers
down the stretch, Davis said
of Brown. He's to be con
gratulated for hitting those
shots. It he keeps working,
he's going to become a very
fine player. He is still making

the transition to guard.'
Chavez, just two-of-nine at
halttime, caught tire after in
termission, and alter missing
his first two shots in the second
half, did not miss again as the
Bears turned a Ib-il halttime
deficit into a 41-40 lead with
12:54 remaining.
He's really a nice player
Stanford coach Tom Davis said
of Chavez. "I like him a lot. He
showed his class by sticking
with it and getting his shots
down the stretch when they
took control of the game
"We were trying, we were
trying," Davis said about the
effort to increase defensive
pressure on Chavez. "Rut he's
awfully quick We would have
liked to have given him much
more pressure than we did.
Butch Hays, the other Cal
guard, also had a hand in the
Bears' reversal of fortune in the
second period, and finished
with 1b points, five assists and
four steals.
"Hays made some crucial
shots in the stretch when thev
turned it around, too Davis
said. Chavez and Havs might
be as fine a pair of defensive
guards in the league, in the way
that they get up and get after
you."
The Cardinal was plagued bv
turnovers throughout the
game, committing 25 on the
night, including two crucial
ones within ten seconds which
allowed Cal to attain its five
point lead with just over a min
ute remaining.
Stanford also missed the
front ends of one-and-one foul
shot opportunities two con
secutive times v\hen the Bears
were assuming control.
"We're just trying to think of
the positive things." Davi
said. We know we re not
there vet. We gave a good et
fort, and we have to think
about what we're going to have
to do to get better.'
Despite being shorter at
every front line position the
Cardinal outrebounded the
Bears bv a 32-24 margin. And
center Michael Pitts, the Bears
leading scorer and rebounder,

was held in check bv a tough
collapsing Cardinal zone,
finishing with just eight points.
Cal shot just i2 percent in
the first hall and fell behind

Davis thought the vocal
crowd lias a | <>sllive effect on

preciate the student support,"
he said. I don't think we
would have been this close
without it.'
Guard Rick\ Lewis sepa
rated his shoulder while sleep
ing Wednesda\ night and did
not play against Cal. Lewis is in
d a nger of joining D ave
Nussbaum and lohn Revel Ii
and becoming t ht > third Stan
ford player to have to miss the
rest ot the \ear. Lewis will
eventually need surgery on
both shoulders, the only ques
tion is when.
Its reallv in the hands of the
doctors and Ric ky," Davis said.
As a coach, I really have to
sla\ out of these kinds of deci
sions What is important to do
is what is in the best interests of
Ru k\ Lewis. Its a definite pos
si hi 111 \ that he may have his
operations verv shortly and it
that is the case, he'll be out for
the year."
