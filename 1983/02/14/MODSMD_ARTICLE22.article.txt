# Card humbles Aztecs
## 
### LIBBY LEONARD 
San Diego State watched
its empire fall Saturday
night as Stanford's women's
basketball team conquered
the visiting A/tecs, 78-60.
Cardinal coach Dotty
McCrea v\as not expecting a
rout. "It would have been a
lot closer had San Diego
been healthy," she said.
The Aztecs were missing
their six-foot-three empress
- ludy Porter. The dominat
ing San Diego center did not
suit up against Stanford due
to lower back problems.
Porter was averaging 23
points and 12 rebounds per
game.
Despite the absence of
Porter, Stanford could not
build a commanding lead in
the first half. Turnovers,
careless ballhandling and
inadequate rebounding
hindered the Card. Simple
shots would not drop. And
the offense was sputtering,
instead of clicking. Stanford
hit a meager 4 1 percent
from the floor during the
first 20 minutes.
San Diego held a 17-14
advantage with 9:27 left in
the half. Following two driv
ing lay-ins by senior Angie
Paccione, Stanford pulled
ahead, 23-19.
The Card built its biggest
lead of the half -six points
after Paccione hit senior
Jeanne Ruark-Hoff for a
baseline layup. With just 20
seconds to go, Stanford was
on top, 33-27.
But the Card's upper
hand quickly went under.
San Diego roared back with
six unanswered points.
Freshman Aztec Dee Dee
Duncan sunk a 22-foot
jumper as the halftime buz
zer sounded to even the
score. 33-33.
Stanford changed its de
fensive tatics in the second
half The Card started play
ing tighl man-to-man de
fense, abandoning its 2-1-2
zone.
"They had no inside
game, so we decided to
concentrate on their out
side shooters," explained

McCrea. "San Diego made a
lot of outside shots early in
the game, but I knew they
couldn't beat us with that
type of game," she added.
McCrea's assumption was
correct. San Diego's sharp
shooting tapered off, and
the Aztecs converted only
30 percent from the field.
Stanford, shooting 50
percent, never trailed the
Aztecs in the second half.
Paccione and freshman
Virginia Sourlis protected
the ball better, allowing
only five turnovers. The
play making pair often
knocked in perimeter shots
against San Diego's sagging
defense. When Paccione
and sourlis weren't spotting
the basket, they were spot
ting their teammates inside.
The Card collected 17 assists
in the second half, while
San Diego had six.

Paccione finished an out
stand in g game vv it h 17
markers and seven assists.
"That was the best 40 min
utes Angie has played at
Stanford in terms of overall
consistency," McCrea said.
After a cold start, Sourlis
warmed up to contribute 13
second-half points. Ruark-
Hoff topped all scorers with
20 points.
Stanford (4-3) shares third
place in the WCAA with
Arizona State. USC and
Long Beach State are lead
ing the pack, followed by
UCLA.
The Card, which currently
holds the nation's best free
ihrow percentage (.766),
will take to the road this
week. Long Beach State will
host the Card tomorrow
night. Stanford will then
play the Arizona schools
this weekend.
