### TOM MOORE 
Stanford's men's tennis team
beat UC-lrvine 5-4 Friday after
noon and evening in a rather
unusual way. The Cardinal did
not actually win the match at
Stanford Tennis Stadium.
With the score tied at four

matches apiece and the pivotal
doubles matchup knotted at
2-2 in the final set, it became
too dark to continue at Stan
ford Tennis Stadium.
After a few fruitless calls to
indoor clubs in the area, it ap
peared that the match would

have to be postponed. But the
Sundown Club in San Mateo
called, explaining that they had
just received a cancellation and
could now provide a court,
Twenty minutes later the
freshman pair of Eric
Rosenfeld/John Letts swept

four games from Irvine's No. 2
doubles team to take the set
and the match, 4-6, 6-3, 6-2.
"I was a little concerned that
the change would affect our
rhythm." Gould said. "They
(Rosenfeld letts) had been
playing well but moving in
doors requires a transition.
They met the i hallenge."
Stanford h.ul indeed been
rising to the occasion all after
noon. The Cardinal took on a
20th ranked UC-lrvine team
without No. 1 singles standout
Scott Dav i -, who was in
LaQuinta, Calif, for a singles
tournament.
Rosenfeld replaced Davis at
the No. 1 spot and played No.
31 ranked )im Snyder. Rosen
feld took the first set on a
dramatic tiebreaker but fell
behind in the next sets and
lost, 7-6, 3-6, 2-6.
In the closest match of the
day, freshman Dan Goldie
edged Bruce Mansonhing at
No. 2, 6-1, 4-b 7-6.
At No. 3, playing what Gould
termed "superb tennis," Letts
swept 39th-ranked Eric Quade
7-5, 6-4. Gould also noted Mark
Mckeen's consistent play in his
7-5, 6-4 triumph over Rubin
Perczek.
Jim Grabb continued his
success this season as well,
beating Ken Derr 6-4, 3-6. But at
the number six spot, in a match
as close as its score indicates,
Jeremy Semple lost to Irvine's
Mark Ramos 4-6, 6-4, 4-6.
In doubles play the Card
team of McKeen/Grabb lost in
straight sets to a 19th ranked
Snyder/Quade pair 4-6, 4-6.
Dan Goldie and Jeremy Semple
also succumbed in two sets to
Mansonhing and Derr 4-6, 3-6
to set the stage for Rosenfeld
and Letts.
The Cardinal travels to Ber
keley Wednesday for the Nor-
Cal Inter-collegiate Tourney,
which lasts through Saturday.
