# Women beat 'Cats, Devils
## 
### MARK ZEIGLER 
The women's tennis team won its first
"meaningful matches" of the season over the
weekend, downing Arizona State Friday and
then Arizona Saturday. Stanford came away
with victories in both matches by identical
scores of 7-2.
The wins ran the Cardinal's match winning
streak to 25 while raising its season mark to
4-0. Since the Arizona schools are part of the
newly-formed WCAA tennis league, Stanford
is 2-0 in conference play.
Junior Elise Burgin paced the Card at No. 1
on both days, winning her singles matches by
scores of 6-2, 6-2 and 6-2, 6-1.
Head coach Frank Brennan called ASU a
good sparring partner for Saturday's match
with the UA Wildcats. "We got to play
Arizona the second day and Arizona is a con
siderably better team," he said.
After cruising past the Wildcats, Brennan
and co. were momentarily scared by the Sun
Devils. At one point in the singles competi
tion, the two, three, four and six spots oil the
Card ladder were losing their matches.
"But (senior) Caryn Copeland started turn
ing her match around and that got everybody
going," Brennan said.
Only sophomore Linda Gates at No. 2 con

tinued the slide and lost her match 6-4, 4-6,
6-3 to UA's Joan Lebedeff. The Cardinal won
the other five singles and the first two dou
bles en route to victory.
At No. 3, Copeland rebounded from her
slow start to record a I-6, 7-5, 6-2 victory.
Another senior, Michelle Weiss, lost her first
set as well, but cruised in the next two.
Freshman Jackie Joseph also struggled early
and still won â€” 7-5, 4-6, 6-3.
Although the Cardinal swept the doubles
Friday against the Sun Devils, they had trou
ble in the middle of the singles line-up. ASU's
Vanessa Miller beat senior No. 3 Caryn Cope
land 6-1, 6-3, and Sherri Norris defeated
senior No. 4 Michelle Weiss just as convinc
ingly, 6-3, 6-1.
"Caryn is a notoriously slow starter,"
Brennan said, referring to her tendency to
win in the clutch at the end of the season.
"Some planes taxi a little longer before they
take off."
Besides the losses at three and four, Stan
ford won all seven other matches in straight
sets except for Alison Elardey and Jackie
Joseph's 6-3, 4-6, 6-3 win at No. 3 doubles.
Stanford takes on Long Beach State Satur
day at 1 p.m. on the varsity courts.
