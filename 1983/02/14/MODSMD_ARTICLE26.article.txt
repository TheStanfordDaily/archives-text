### BETH KLEID 
It was a grueling 2 -
hour-and-45 minute match.
The men's volleyball match
against Long Beach State Uni
versity went into five sets, and
Stanford lost the deciding set
16-14.
The Cardinal took the first
set by a score of 15-10. Long
Beach won the next two, 15-5
and 15-13. Stanford came back
to win the fourth, 15-13, before
dropping the final one.
Head coach Fred Sturm was
disappointed, but not dis
pleased. "Long Beach is a very
experienced team, and we are
not. They won because of our
mistakes, which is encourag
ing in a way.
"Once we gain experience, I
feel that it will be the best team
that I've ever had here," he
said.
Sturm's team is a young one
— two freshmen and four
sophomores start. According
to Sturm, the team has much
room for improvement.
"The team has a lot to learn
— we made too many little mis
takes against Long Beach. We
need to learn when to keep the
ball in play and when to go for
winners," Sturm said.
Sturm is happy with the mo
ments of brilliance displayed
by his team; if only they would
happen more often. "I think
we outplayed Long Beach in a
lot of ways. It was clearly our
finest effort of the year; it was a
shame that we lost."
The volleyball team was

ready to avenge an earlier loss
to Long Beach. They were
beaten by Long Beach in a
tournament two weeks prior to
Friday's match. "Redemption
was a good motivator," said
Sturm.
But the redemption
motivator was not good
enough. Long Beach's compo
sure at crucial moments, and
their aggressiveness led them
to win the match.
Long Beach took control of
the fifth game when Stanford
was ahead 14-13. Long Beach's
experience caused the Card to
lose their lead. "I would call
Long Beach a 'ball control
team' b'ecause they know how
to frustrate their opponents
and cause them to make er
rors. I give them a lot of
credit."
Freshman Jon Root was a
standout player in the match,
but his inexperience showed,
according to Sturm. "Root
played quite well. At times he
made some 'freshman mis
takes' like hittingthe ball out of
bounds and into the net. He
has to learn to keep the ball in
control."
Sophomores Craig Lauchner
and Dan Parr also showed ex
cellence in the match.
"We will have to learn to
stop making judgment errors
and the only way to learn is to
play and make them," Sturm
said.
Team members will have a
chance to work on their game
when they play USC on Feb. 16.
