The women's swim team
bounced back from its first loss
by thrashing UC-Berkeley
100-40 on Saturday at Berkeley.
"We swam well, but not like
we did last week against Texas,
because we didn't have to,"
head coach George Haines
said.
Stanford did offer some im
pressive performances. Senior
Kim Carlisle met the NCAA
time standard in the 100 IM,
winning in 59.10. Sophomore
Isabel Reuss won both the 100
and 200 freestyle with times of
51.30and 1.51:70, respectively.
Another sophomore,
Stephanie Elkins, captured the
500 free in 4:55.44.
The highlight of the meet oc
curred when Stanford senior
Kelly Asplund tied favorite
Mary Meagher of Cal in the 50
butterfly in 26.09. The 400 free
relay team swam its best time
of the year, winning in 1:35.80.
The Cardinal also dominated
the diving. Sophomore Tori
Pulskamp won both one-and
three-meter boards.
"It wasn't that great of a per
formance because it was tough
to get excited after Texas,"
Haines said.
The Card women will be tak
ing aim at the league title two
weeks from now when they
travel to Los Angeles for the
WCAA Championships Feb.
24-26.
