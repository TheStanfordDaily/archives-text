# Both teams victorious
## Gymnasts win in Maples 
### SARAH CARREL 
Stanford's dynamic gymnasts swept all of their
opponents in a five-team meet at Maples Pavil
ion on Friday night.
The women squeaked by arch-rivals UC—
Berkeley for the second time this year with a
score of 174.95 to 173.05. The men romped past
San Jose State 261.50 to 252.40, while the Univer
sity of British Columbia brought up the tail to the
men's triangular meet with 207.50.
For the women, it was an all-around team ef
fort against the likes of Cat's Karen Kelsall, who
was a member of Canada's Olympic team. The
meet got off to a good start for the Cardinal on
the uneven parallel bars with an outstanding
score of 45.05 out of a possible 50.
"After the bars we couldn't go wrong," senior
Karen Hall said. Hall won the all-around with a
score of 35.85, followed by Cal's Tina Palmieri
with 35.75. In third was Stanford junior Kim
Strauss, who had an outstanding meet, winning
the bars with a 9.25.
Homer Sardina, the Card coach, said he was
excited with the season sweep of the Bears. "I
think if there's a team that's really fun to beat,
it's got to be Cal," he said.
The men had a more relaxed meet, and Head

Coach Sadao Hamada opted to rest superstar
freshman Gary Smith. Hamada hopes to have
Smith in top shape for upcoming away meets,
which are crucial in qualifying for the NCAA
championships.
"Without Gary we can look for the individual
effort," said Hamada to his team before the
competition. "As a result (of the decision), we
saw a lot of good things and a few rough things,
but overall we were quite consistant."
One of the "good things" was freshman John
Levy's second-place finish in the all-around with
55.25 out of 60. The New Orleans native was
beaten only by San Jose's Ron Palassou, ranked
No. 8 in the nation last year.
One reason for the top performances was the
large, enthusiastic crowd, led by a fraction
of the Stanford Band. "It is so nice to have a
home crowd," said sophomore all-arounder
Vicky Worden
Karen Hall added, "I was so relaxed, and I
think it was being at home."
The men will not see action at home for
another two weeks, when they take on UC—
Davis. The women meet Arizona and San Jose
State in two weeks as well.
