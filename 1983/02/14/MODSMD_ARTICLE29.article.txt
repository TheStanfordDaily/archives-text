an eagle on the final hole to score a
one-shot victory in the Hawaiian Open
Golf Tournament yesterday and be
came the first Japanese to win on the
American PGA Tour.
Aoki's dramatic pitch finished off a 5-

playoff spot when he finished with a
two-putt a 66 that xave him a
269 total.
Suddenly, however, *\oki turned it
around. He raised hisarmsintriumphas
a huge gallery of Japanese tourists
began shouting, screaming, leaping up
and down.
Ben Crenshaw, who held sole
possession of the top spot as late as the
14th hole, was third alone at 271 after a
closing 66
Aoki, 40, has won 39 tournaments in
