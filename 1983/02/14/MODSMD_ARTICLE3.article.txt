### LISA LYNCH Staff writer 
Dozens of students and campus
visitors who wished to see the view
from the top of Hoover Tower were
turned away by campus guides this
weekend. The Tower's observation
deck was closed by the University
Saturday morning so that a sprinkler
system and smoke alarms could be
installed in the Tower.
"The estimated completion date
for the project is March of '84," said
)ohn Hughes, assistant to Ray Bac
chetti, vice provost for management.
However. Robert Beth, director of
Risk Management, said that the proj
ect would probably take about four
months. "It will be a large project;
there are 13 floors to renovate," he
said. "But I can't see the project tak
ing any longer than six months; that
should be ample time."
A law passed last year by Santa
Clara County set new provisions for
the fireproofing of tall buildings, and
the county fire marshal asked the
University at that time to design a
sprinkler system for the building. A
fire safety program has been de
signed and will be submitted to the
board of trustees next month.
Alain Decleve, director of health
and safety in the Risk Management
Office, said that even though renova
tions would not begin immediately,
the Tower has to be closed for legal
reasons. "It was the legal counsel
who recommended to the adminis
trative council that the Tower be
closed," he explained. "It's not final
yet just what will be done, and we
could leave the building open, but
why take the additional risk?"
Hughes said it is evident that a fire
in the Tower would result in the
death of anyone on the observation
deck.
According to Decleve, the Tower
has always been somewhat of a sfaety
hazard. "It's the same as walking
through an old castle in Europe. Vou
know that there is a risk, though a
very slight one," he said. He ex
plained that anyone who knew what
to do in case of a fire would besafe in
the Tower, but added, "We have to
halt the continuous flow of people
who go into the tower not knowing
that the building is not fire-safe."
The improvements on the Tower
will not affect insurance rates, ac
cording to Beth. "We're self
insured," he said, "so this would
make no difference to us."
The decision to close the observa
tion deck came as a surprise to the

Guide and Visitor's service — the
group responsible for escorting
more than 40,000 people to the top of
the Tower yearly. The service re
ceived a memo on Friday afternoon
saying that the Tower would be
closed the following morning.
Tour guide Bob johnson ex
plained, "We were never told any
thing about the plans to close the
Tower. In fact, we recently printed
up brochures describing the campus
and suggesting that visitors come to
the Tower."
According to Johnson, none of the
35 guides who staff the Tower and
give campus tours will be laid off.
Instead, those guides who would
normally lead tours of the Tower
would have new duties assigned to
them. "We plan to expand our other
services," johnson said. "We may
add additional tours."
johnson said that he was angry that
the University had taken so long to
inform the guide service of their de
cision. "It seems to me to be an
example of more bureaucratic bungl
ing," he said. "None of the depart
ments in this University want to tell
each other anything until the last
minute. Also, why close the deck a
month before the board of trustees
approves the plan?"
However, johnson explained that
he and the other guides were more

disappointed than angry that the
Tower would be closed. "There's re
ally no other way to get a good look at
the University," he said. "Besides,
theTowercan be seen from far away;
it's a landmark, and if it's closed it
looks as if the University doesn't
want to have anything to do with the
public. I'm looking forward to seeing
it open again."
