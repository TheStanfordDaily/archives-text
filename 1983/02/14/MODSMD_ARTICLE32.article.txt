For those Daily staffers who did
not receive a Valentine in today's
paper, we want you to know you're
not forgotten. One short, nearly hair
less and occasionally clueless news
editor hopes you have a good day.
Don't be blue be read — come by
today for a story assignment and a
kiss.
Training returns
Once again tomorrow is a Tuesday
and you know what that means.
Heather, who is still happy, will be on
hand to give you the scoop on the
computer system. Anyone who has
written for the Daily or is interested
in writing is invited. Training session
begins at 2:15 p.m.
