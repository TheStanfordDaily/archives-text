# Kennedys plan for royal visit

### KIMBERLY BROWN Senior staff writer 
The Queen's luncheon is three
weeks away, and Jeanne Kennedy is
already busy.
Kennedy, wife of University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy, met the
media Friday and amidst glaring T.V.
lights led a pack of newspaper and
television reporters over the
threshold, through the entry hall and
to table, itself, where the Queen,
herself, will finally be seated on
March 3.
Kennedy, official hostess to the
Queen of England, patiently an
swered the same questions for
different news networks and at one
point in the media "walk through"
agreed to walk through the house,
again, retracing the Queen's route
with a T.V. reporter.
Kennedy admitted that she had not
at first realized the historical impact
of even the smallest details of the
Queen's visit.
As planned, the luncheon will
begin with the arrival of the Queen's
limousine between 12 and 12:30 p.m.
The Kennedys will greet the Queen,
accompanied by Provost Albert Has
torf and his wife. There will not be a
receiving line.
During the next 25 minutes, the
Queen will be ushered into the living
room where the 92 guests, including
16 to 20 students, University adminis
trators and trustees and a party from
the White House, will already be as
sembled. The actual guest list is still
incomplete and has not yet been re
leased.
"The Queen and the Duke like to
come into a party where people are
having a good time," Kennedy said.
She said she is not worried about the
atmosphere because "students here
are not in the least bit inhibited."'
The guests will be seated for lunch
at five tables "shoe-horned" into the
dining room. Kennedy said that
while it will be no easy feat, it will be
possible to seat 92 peopie at the same
time.
The Queen will be seated at the

center of the dining room table, next
to President Kennedy. Jeanne Ken
nedy will sit beside the Duke.
Although the menu will remain a
secret until the luncheon is served,
several reporters asked about ru
mored salmon mousse and caviar.
San Francisco columnist Herb Caen
reportedly got the inside tip from the
Kennedy's caterer, Victoria Emmons.
Kennedy did say that "California

wines will be served, of course."
She "couldn't possibly guess," she
said, how many hours of planning
have already gone into the Queen's
visit. Still, with all the visitors they
have entertained since moving into
the president's house, the plans did
not pose any problems, she said.
Asked whether she is worried or
nervous, Kennedy said she is "look
ing forward to the honor and the

pleasure" of meeting the Queen. But
she admitted she is worried about
possible political demonstrators.
Although the University is not tak
ing security measures inside the
house, there will be guards stationed
along the route and on the hillside
below, Kennedy said.
Other exceptional aspects of the
planning have included consid
erations for flowers and china. "I was

taking this a little too casually at
first," Kennedy said, "but now I
realize that years from now, people
will say, 'this set of china was used by
the Queen on her visit.' " The flow
ers have not been decided upon.
All the guests will be briefed on
basic protocol. Some students and
University officials met for a protocol
meeting last week to discuss the
