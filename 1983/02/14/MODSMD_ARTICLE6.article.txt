Begin takes over Sharon's post
Jerusalem — Prime Minister Menachem Begin
named himself defense minister yesterday and re
duced former Defense Minister Ariel Sharon to the
post of minister without portfolio.
In naming himself to head the defense ministry, Be
gin also indicated that he would name a permanent
successor to Sharon, but gave no indication who that
would be.
Moshe Arens, Israel's ambassador to the United
States, is widely believed to be Begin's first choice for
Sharon's permanent replacement. But some Israeli
newspapers have speculated that Arens is reluctant to
take the job as long as Sharon remains in the Cabinet.
Arens shares Sharon's hardline views on most matters,

but may not relish the idea of having the burley
former general looking over his shoulder.
The Cabinet approved the shuffle, saying the
changes satisified the recommendations of the judical
commission that investigated the Sabra and Chatilla
refugee camps massacre.
The changes are subject to ratification by the
Knesset. A favorable vote is expected because Begin's
coalition holds a clear majority and because if the law
makers reject the plan, Sharon apparently would re
main as defense minister.
Sharon announced Friday that he would relinquish
the defense post. It was widely assumed at the time
that he would remain in the Cabinet as minister
without portfolio.

Critics of the government complained that Sharon
retained a substantial power base in the Cabinet de
spite the commission's conclusion that he was per
sonally responsible for allowing the slaughter of hun
dreds of Palestinian civilians.
Cabinet spokesman Dan Meridor said the Cabinet
approved the reshuffle unanimously and "not even
one minister objected to Sharon's staying in the gov
ernment."
However, the action brought objections from some
Israeli newspapers, which said the move circum
vented the recommendation of the commission
headed by Chief Justice Yitzhak Kahan.
"As long as the defense ministry remains in the
hands of the prime minister, Mr. Sharon can hope to

continue to control the defense establishment," the
nationally circulated Tel Aviv daily Haaretz said in an
editorial.
