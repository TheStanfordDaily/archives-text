Begin takes over Sharon's post
Jerusalem — Prime Minister Menachem Begin
named himself defense minister yesterday and re
duced former Defense Minister Ariel Sharon to the
post of minister without portfolio.
In naming himself to head the defense ministry, Be
gin also indicated that he would name a permanent
successor to Sharon, but gave no indication who that
would be.
Moshe Arens, Israel's ambassador to the United
States, is widely believed to be Begin's first choice for
Sharon's permanent replacement. But some Israeli
newspapers have speculated that Arens is reluctant to
take the job as long as Sharon remains in the Cabinet.
Arens shares Sharon's hardline views on most matters,

but may not relish the idea of having the burley
former general looking over his shoulder.
The Cabinet approved the shuffle, saying the
changes satisified the recommendations of the judical
commission that investigated the Sabra and Chatilla
refugee camps massacre.
The changes are subject to ratification by the
Knesset. A favorable vote is expected because Begin's
coalition holds a clear majority and because if the law
makers reject the plan, Sharon apparently would re
main as defense minister.
Sharon announced Friday that he would relinquish
the defense post. It was widely assumed at the time
that he would remain in the Cabinet as minister
without portfolio.

Critics of the government complained that Sharon
retained a substantial power base in the Cabinet de
spite the commission's conclusion that he was per
sonally responsible for allowing the slaughter of hun
dreds of Palestinian civilians.
Cabinet spokesman Dan Meridor said the Cabinet
approved the reshuffle unanimously and "not even
one minister objected to Sharon's staying in the gov
ernment."
However, the action brought objections from some
Israeli newspapers, which said the move circum
vented the recommendation of the commission
headed by Chief Justice Yitzhak Kahan.
"As long as the defense ministry remains in the
hands of the prime minister, Mr. Sharon can hope to

continue to control the defense establishment," the
nationally circulated Tel Aviv daily Haaretz said in an
editorial.
Hinckley attempts suicide
Washington — john Hinckley, acquitted by reason
of insanity of shooting President Reagan, was hospi
talized in serious condition Sunday following an ap
parent attempt to take his own life by swallowing an
unidentified substance, officials said.
Hinckley was rushed to the intensive care unit of
Greater Southeast Community Hospital and con
nected to a respirator after being discovered semi
conscious on the floor of the mental hospital where
he had been in indefinite confinement, the officials
said.
They said Hinckley's parents, John and JoAnn
Hinckley of Evergreen, Colo., had been notified of
the incident.
James Levy, Greater Southeast's president, said that
Hinckley may be in danger of dying although "he is
stable and we believe he'll be all right."
Hinckley's color was blue when he arrived at the
hospital and the acid level in his blood was severely
high, Levy said.
"I can't give you a prognosis," Levy told reporters at
a press briefing yesterday afternoon. "We will not be
able to tell you for certain for the next 24 to 48 hours
whether he's out of the woods."
Levy said that doctors believe Hinckley took a sub
stance "related to a medication" at St. Elizabeths Hos
pital, where the would-be presidential assassin has
been confined since last year's trial.
Police disperse Warsaw crowds
Warsaw, Poland. — Several hundred police, lob
bing tear gas grenades and flailing rubber batons, dis
persed more than 2000 people demonstrating last
night outside a church for the outlawed Solidarity la
bor union. It was the largest protest demonstration in
Poland in three months.
Between 200 and 300 police moved into position
outside Holy Cross Church in downtown Warsaw as a
commemorative Mass ended for Solidarity members
who had been interned after martial law was imposed
Dec. 13,1981.
Another storm to hit East
Bulldozers and snowplows cleared arteries yester
day through the giant cities of the Northeast im
mobilized by a record blizzard that killed at least 67
people, and major airports opened in time to get
thousands of stranded travelers home for Valentine's
Day.
But a new storm was heading up the East Coast, af
ter dumping snow, sleet and ice pellets on northern
Georgia and much of South Carolina, and the Na
tional Weather Service said the mid-Atlantic Coast
States could expect the same "or even worse."
"The storm will continue moving northeast during
the night and is expected to spread another blanket of
snow along the mid-Atlantic Coast by late tomor
row," the weather service said yesterday.
Steve Corfidi of the Severe Storms Forecast Center
in Kansas City, Mo., said the new storm was likely to
spread three to five inches of snow from central Vir
ginia to central New |er<ey.
"It bears some watching," Corfidi said. "It's a simi
lar situation to the last one."
The Blizzard of '83, which dropped up to three feet
of snow from North Carolina to New England on Fri
day and Saturday, was blamed for the sinking of a coal
ship in which 24 crewmen were killed off the Virginia
coast and 43 other deaths in 11 states and the District
of Columbia.

Coast Guard abandons search
Portsmouth, Virginia — Coast Guard rescuers yes
terday ended their search for nine missing crewmen
from the Marine Electric, a 605-foot, coal-carrying
vessel that capsized and sank off the Virginia coast
early Saturday morning, killing at least 24 of its 36
crewmen.
Only three crew members have been rescued from
the icy waters 30 miles off Chincoteague where the
ship went down. High seas had hindered rescue oper
ations Saturday, but weather was not a factor in yes
terday's decision to call off the search, according to
Barbara Smith, a spokeswoman for the Coast Guard in
Portsmouth, Va., the base for search operations.
Smith said rescue efforts would not resume unless
new evidence is found to suggest that other sailors
had survived. Coast Guard officials said it is highly un
likely that any crewmen still in the water could be
alive. Most people cannot survive more than two
and-a-half hours in 37-degree water.
The Marine Electric left Norfolk Friday morning for
Somerset, Mass., carrying 22,000 tons of coal. Late that
night the ship foundered in 12- to 15-foot waves but
remained afloat for more than seven hours before
sinking at about 12:30 p.m Saturday in 120 feet of wa
ter.
Fire kills 64 in Turin
Turin, Italy — Flames and smoke raced through a
Turin movie theater last night, killing 64 people and
injuring dozens in the crowd of 500, Police Chief An
tonio Fareillo reported.
Police said the fire might have been caused by a
short circuit or by fireworks set off as a joke by
pranksters celebrating Carnival, which is being ob
served throughout Italy. They reported a pistol was
found on the floor, but said it apparently had nothing
to do with the blaze.
The death toll soared when firemen found more
than 20 bodies in a second-floor bathroom and in
rooms used by the management for offices or storage.
Officials said that Raimondo Capello, the 51-year
old theater manager, was arrested and charged with
manslaughter. They gave no details, but several wit
nesses claimed some of the 10 exit doors were locked
and had to be battered open.
U.S. to fight dumping ban
Washington — Top-level U.S. officials from the En
vironmental Protection Agency (EPA), the State De
partment and the Department of Defense will gather
this week in London, where they will oppose a pro
posed change in an international pollution treaty that
would ban all dumping of radioactive wastes in the
world's oceans.
Led by EPA Deputy Administrator John Hernandez,
the delegation marks the first attendance by ranking
U.S. officials at the Convention on the Prevention of
Maritime Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other
Matter. The relatively obscure, 53-nation convention
will hold its seventh annual meeting today through
Thursday.
Several factors account for the heightened Ameri
can interest this year. For one thing, the amendment

by the tiny Pacific island nations of Kiribati and Nauru
is the first formal proposal for such a treaty ban on nu
clear dumping. And it follows by only a few weeks the
action by the lame-duck Congress in December that
placed a two-year moratorium on dumping low-level
radioactive materials in U.S. waters.
Environmental groups, headed by Greenpeace In
ternational, a worldwide conservation organization
that concentrates on protecting oceans and sea life,
are critical of the U.S. position on the treaty amend
ment. The United States wants to send the islanders'
proposal back to the convention's scientific commit
tee for further study.
Queen begins American tour
Kingston, Jamaica — Britain's Queen Elizabeth was
flying to Jamaica yesterday to begin a month-long trip
that will include a visit to President Reagan's ranch in
Santa Barbara and to Stanford.
The queen and her husband, Prince Philip, left chil
ly London aboard a Royal Air Force jet for the
monarch's most extensive tour of thp Western Hemi
sphere tour since she was crowned in 1952.
Jamaican officials say the queen's visit will highlight
this Caribbean island's revived economy and provide
a potential boost to tourism.
"There is very good will between the people of Ja
maica and the queen. The moment she steps on this
soil, she will be accepted as the queen of Jamaica,"
said Sir Florizel Glasspole.
As governor-general, Glasspole is the queen's of
ficial — and mostly ceremonial — representative in
Jamaica, which is independent and a member of the
Commonwealth.
White House lobbies for defense
Washington — The White House is mounting what
one senior administration official calls "a full-court
press" in an effort to reverse a growing public per
ception that the United States is spending too much
money for military purposes.
In an unannounced campaign to counter a trend in
public opinion that has emboldened congressional
critics of President Reagan's defense budget, promi
nent administration officials who rarely speak on mili
tary matters have been instructed to defend the U.S.
buildup at every opportunity.
William Greener, a Pentagon and White House
spokesman in the Ford administration, has been
brought in as a consultant tocoordinate speeches and
publicstatements. And White House officials say that,
within the next few weeks, Reagan will make another
nationally televised appeal for his defense budget,
probably tied to a key vote in Congress.
L.A. Iranians condemn Khomeini
Los Angeles — More than 1000 Iranian opponents
of the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini protested the
fourth anniversary of his rise to power yesterday with
a peaceful march under the watch of mounted police.
The walk along Wilshire Boulevard to the Federal
Building in West Los Angeles capped a weekend of
pro- and anti-Khomeini demonstrations by the local
Iranian community, including a blood drive to protest
"the bloodshed of the Khomeini regime."

Police Sgt. Steve Beitzer estimated the crowd at be
tween 1000 and 1500 marchers and said there were no
counter demonstrations or incidents.
But Said Jabbari, director of the Movement for the
National Independence of Iran, said police estimates
were far too low.
The crowd was "extremely peaceful and orderly,"
said Lt. Larry Welch, one of 30 mounted officers
monitoring the demonstration. "They're a little loud,
that's all."
Chanting "Death to Khomeini" and carrying pic
tures of Reza Shah Pahlavi, the 22-year-old son of the
late Shah of Iran, the demonstrators marched from
the building and back.
On Friday about 100 Khomeini supporters held a
rally at the federal building as Iranians opposed to the
regime donated blood a half block away.
The blood drive, organized by a dozen Iranian
groups, collected about 400 units of blood Friday and
Saturday, said American Red Cross spokesman Ralph
Wright.
There were no attempts to disrupt the blood drive,
but the two groups facing off down the street made
things tense at the Westwood Red Cross center.
London police find bodies
London — Police dug up more bones yesterday in
what British newspapers call a mass murderer's
"garden of secret graves" and let reporters tour the
adjoining house where they say the killer may have
chopped up 17 victims.
They also appealed to anyone who once lived in the
house to come forward and help in the murder
probe.
The bones, found at various locations in the
backyard of the building in the Cricklewood district
of north London, have been sent to a pathologist for
examination. Detective Supt. Norman Briers, leading
the search, said they were most likely human but did
not elaborate.
Scotland Yard has said it expects to find rotting
pieces of as many as 17 victims of a mass murderer
who, according to published reports, met young drif
ters in north London pubs, lured them home,
strangled them, hacked up their corpses and boiled
the pieces.
Dennis Nilsen, 37, a state employment office ex
ecutive, ex-army cook and former probationary Lon
don policeman, was arraigned Saturday on charges of
murdering the only victim yet identified — Stephen
Sinclair, a 20-year-old drifter.
A plumber trying to fix a clogged, smelly sewer dis
covered hunks of Sinclair's body and pieces of two
other cadavers last Wednesday at another house in
nearby Muswell Hill. After Nilsen's arrest Thursday,
police expanded the search to the Cricklewood ad
dress, where he used to live.
Today's weather
Sunny and a little warmer after patchy morning fog.
Highs in the upper 50s to low 60s. Light southerly
winds. Mostly fair tonight then increasing clouds
tomorrow leading to a chance of rain tomorrow after
noon.

ginia to central New |er<ey.
"It bears some watching," Corfidi said. "It's a simi
lar situation to the last one."
The Blizzard of '83, which dropped up to three feet
of snow from North Carolina to New England on Fri
day and Saturday, was blamed for the sinking of a coal
ship in which 24 crewmen were killed off the Virginia
coast and 43 other deaths in 11 states and the District
of Columbia.

Coast Guard abandons search
Portsmouth, Virginia — Coast Guard rescuers yes
terday ended their search for nine missing crewmen
from the Marine Electric, a 605-foot, coal-carrying
vessel that capsized and sank off the Virginia coast
early Saturday morning, killing at least 24 of its 36
crewmen.
Only three crew members have been rescued from
the icy waters 30 miles off Chincoteague where the
ship went down. High seas had hindered rescue oper
ations Saturday, but weather was not a factor in yes
terday's decision to call off the search, according to
Barbara Smith, a spokeswoman for the Coast Guard in
Portsmouth, Va., the base for search operations.
Smith said rescue efforts would not resume unless
new evidence is found to suggest that other sailors
had survived. Coast Guard officials said it is highly un
likely that any crewmen still in the water could be
alive. Most people cannot survive more than two
and-a-half hours in 37-degree water.
The Marine Electric left Norfolk Friday morning for
Somerset, Mass., carrying 22,000 tons of coal. Late that
night the ship foundered in 12- to 15-foot waves but
remained afloat for more than seven hours before
sinking at about 12:30 p.m Saturday in 120 feet of wa
ter.
Fire kills 64 in Turin
Turin, Italy — Flames and smoke raced through a
Turin movie theater last night, killing 64 people and
injuring dozens in the crowd of 500, Police Chief An
tonio Fareillo reported.
Police said the fire might have been caused by a
short circuit or by fireworks set off as a joke by
pranksters celebrating Carnival, which is being ob
served throughout Italy. They reported a pistol was
found on the floor, but said it apparently had nothing
to do with the blaze.
The death toll soared when firemen found more
than 20 bodies in a second-floor bathroom and in
rooms used by the management for offices or storage.
Officials said that Raimondo Capello, the 51-year
old theater manager, was arrested and charged with
manslaughter. They gave no details, but several wit
nesses claimed some of the 10 exit doors were locked
and had to be battered open.
U.S. to fight dumping ban
Washington — Top-level U.S. officials from the En
vironmental Protection Agency (EPA), the State De
partment and the Department of Defense will gather
this week in London, where they will oppose a pro
posed change in an international pollution treaty that
would ban all dumping of radioactive wastes in the
world's oceans.
Led by EPA Deputy Administrator John Hernandez,
the delegation marks the first attendance by ranking
U.S. officials at the Convention on the Prevention of
Maritime Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other
Matter. The relatively obscure, 53-nation convention
will hold its seventh annual meeting today through
Thursday.
Several factors account for the heightened Ameri
can interest this year. For one thing, the amendment

by the tiny Pacific island nations of Kiribati and Nauru
is the first formal proposal for such a treaty ban on nu
clear dumping. And it follows by only a few weeks the
action by the lame-duck Congress in December that
placed a two-year moratorium on dumping low-level
radioactive materials in U.S. waters.
Environmental groups, headed by Greenpeace In
ternational, a worldwide conservation organization
that concentrates on protecting oceans and sea life,
are critical of the U.S. position on the treaty amend
ment. The United States wants to send the islanders'
proposal back to the convention's scientific commit
tee for further study.
Queen begins American tour
Kingston, Jamaica — Britain's Queen Elizabeth was
flying to Jamaica yesterday to begin a month-long trip
that will include a visit to President Reagan's ranch in
Santa Barbara and to Stanford.
The queen and her husband, Prince Philip, left chil
ly London aboard a Royal Air Force jet for the
monarch's most extensive tour of thp Western Hemi
sphere tour since she was crowned in 1952.
Jamaican officials say the queen's visit will highlight
this Caribbean island's revived economy and provide
a potential boost to tourism.
"There is very good will between the people of Ja
maica and the queen. The moment she steps on this
soil, she will be accepted as the queen of Jamaica,"
said Sir Florizel Glasspole.
As governor-general, Glasspole is the queen's of
ficial — and mostly ceremonial — representative in
Jamaica, which is independent and a member of the
Commonwealth.
White House lobbies for defense
Washington — The White House is mounting what
one senior administration official calls "a full-court
press" in an effort to reverse a growing public per
ception that the United States is spending too much
money for military purposes.
In an unannounced campaign to counter a trend in
public opinion that has emboldened congressional
critics of President Reagan's defense budget, promi
nent administration officials who rarely speak on mili
tary matters have been instructed to defend the U.S.
buildup at every opportunity.
William Greener, a Pentagon and White House
spokesman in the Ford administration, has been
brought in as a consultant tocoordinate speeches and
publicstatements. And White House officials say that,
within the next few weeks, Reagan will make another
nationally televised appeal for his defense budget,
probably tied to a key vote in Congress.
L.A. Iranians condemn Khomeini
Los Angeles — More than 1000 Iranian opponents
of the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini protested the
fourth anniversary of his rise to power yesterday with
a peaceful march under the watch of mounted police.
The walk along Wilshire Boulevard to the Federal
Building in West Los Angeles capped a weekend of
pro- and anti-Khomeini demonstrations by the local
Iranian community, including a blood drive to protest
"the bloodshed of the Khomeini regime."

Police Sgt. Steve Beitzer estimated the crowd at be
tween 1000 and 1500 marchers and said there were no
counter demonstrations or incidents.
But Said Jabbari, director of the Movement for the
National Independence of Iran, said police estimates
were far too low.
The crowd was "extremely peaceful and orderly,"
said Lt. Larry Welch, one of 30 mounted officers
monitoring the demonstration. "They're a little loud,
that's all."
Chanting "Death to Khomeini" and carrying pic
tures of Reza Shah Pahlavi, the 22-year-old son of the
late Shah of Iran, the demonstrators marched from
the building and back.
On Friday about 100 Khomeini supporters held a
rally at the federal building as Iranians opposed to the
regime donated blood a half block away.
The blood drive, organized by a dozen Iranian
groups, collected about 400 units of blood Friday and
Saturday, said American Red Cross spokesman Ralph
Wright.
There were no attempts to disrupt the blood drive,
but the two groups facing off down the street made
things tense at the Westwood Red Cross center.
London police find bodies
London — Police dug up more bones yesterday in
what British newspapers call a mass murderer's
"garden of secret graves" and let reporters tour the
adjoining house where they say the killer may have
chopped up 17 victims.
They also appealed to anyone who once lived in the
house to come forward and help in the murder
probe.
The bones, found at various locations in the
backyard of the building in the Cricklewood district
of north London, have been sent to a pathologist for
examination. Detective Supt. Norman Briers, leading
the search, said they were most likely human but did
not elaborate.
Scotland Yard has said it expects to find rotting
pieces of as many as 17 victims of a mass murderer
who, according to published reports, met young drif
ters in north London pubs, lured them home,
strangled them, hacked up their corpses and boiled
the pieces.
Dennis Nilsen, 37, a state employment office ex
ecutive, ex-army cook and former probationary Lon
don policeman, was arraigned Saturday on charges of
murdering the only victim yet identified — Stephen
Sinclair, a 20-year-old drifter.
A plumber trying to fix a clogged, smelly sewer dis
covered hunks of Sinclair's body and pieces of two
other cadavers last Wednesday at another house in
nearby Muswell Hill. After Nilsen's arrest Thursday,
police expanded the search to the Cricklewood ad
dress, where he used to live.

Begin takes over Sharon's post
Jerusalem — Prime Minister Menachem Begin
named himself defense minister yesterday and re
duced former Defense Minister Ariel Sharon to the
post of minister without portfolio.
In naming himself to head the defense ministry, Be
gin also indicated that he would name a permanent
successor to Sharon, but gave no indication who that
would be.
Moshe Arens, Israel's ambassador to the United
States, is widely believed to be Begin's first choice for
Sharon's permanent replacement. But some Israeli
newspapers have speculated that Arens is reluctant to
take the job as long as Sharon remains in the Cabinet.
Arens shares Sharon's hardline views on most matters,

but may not relish the idea of having the burley
former general looking over his shoulder.
The Cabinet approved the shuffle, saying the
changes satisified the recommendations of the judical
commission that investigated the Sabra and Chatilla
refugee camps massacre.
The changes are subject to ratification by the
Knesset. A favorable vote is expected because Begin's
coalition holds a clear majority and because if the law
makers reject the plan, Sharon apparently would re
main as defense minister.
Sharon announced Friday that he would relinquish
the defense post. It was widely assumed at the time
that he would remain in the Cabinet as minister
without portfolio.

Critics of the government complained that Sharon
retained a substantial power base in the Cabinet de
spite the commission's conclusion that he was per
sonally responsible for allowing the slaughter of hun
dreds of Palestinian civilians.
Cabinet spokesman Dan Meridor said the Cabinet
approved the reshuffle unanimously and "not even
one minister objected to Sharon's staying in the gov
ernment."
However, the action brought objections from some
Israeli newspapers, which said the move circum
vented the recommendation of the commission
headed by Chief Justice Yitzhak Kahan.
"As long as the defense ministry remains in the
hands of the prime minister, Mr. Sharon can hope to

continue to control the defense establishment," the
nationally circulated Tel Aviv daily Haaretz said in an
editorial.
Hinckley attempts suicide
Washington — john Hinckley, acquitted by reason
of insanity of shooting President Reagan, was hospi
talized in serious condition Sunday following an ap
parent attempt to take his own life by swallowing an
unidentified substance, officials said.
Hinckley was rushed to the intensive care unit of
Greater Southeast Community Hospital and con
nected to a respirator after being discovered semi
conscious on the floor of the mental hospital where
he had been in indefinite confinement, the officials
said.
They said Hinckley's parents, John and JoAnn
Hinckley of Evergreen, Colo., had been notified of
the incident.
James Levy, Greater Southeast's president, said that
Hinckley may be in danger of dying although "he is
stable and we believe he'll be all right."
Hinckley's color was blue when he arrived at the
hospital and the acid level in his blood was severely
high, Levy said.
"I can't give you a prognosis," Levy told reporters at
a press briefing yesterday afternoon. "We will not be
able to tell you for certain for the next 24 to 48 hours
whether he's out of the woods."
Levy said that doctors believe Hinckley took a sub
stance "related to a medication" at St. Elizabeths Hos
pital, where the would-be presidential assassin has
been confined since last year's trial.
Police disperse Warsaw crowds
Warsaw, Poland. — Several hundred police, lob
bing tear gas grenades and flailing rubber batons, dis
persed more than 2000 people demonstrating last
night outside a church for the outlawed Solidarity la
bor union. It was the largest protest demonstration in
Poland in three months.
Between 200 and 300 police moved into position
outside Holy Cross Church in downtown Warsaw as a
commemorative Mass ended for Solidarity members
who had been interned after martial law was imposed
Dec. 13,1981.
Another storm to hit East
Bulldozers and snowplows cleared arteries yester
day through the giant cities of the Northeast im
mobilized by a record blizzard that killed at least 67
people, and major airports opened in time to get
thousands of stranded travelers home for Valentine's
Day.
But a new storm was heading up the East Coast, af
ter dumping snow, sleet and ice pellets on northern
Georgia and much of South Carolina, and the Na
tional Weather Service said the mid-Atlantic Coast
States could expect the same "or even worse."
"The storm will continue moving northeast during
the night and is expected to spread another blanket of
snow along the mid-Atlantic Coast by late tomor
row," the weather service said yesterday.
Steve Corfidi of the Severe Storms Forecast Center
in Kansas City, Mo., said the new storm was likely to
spread three to five inches of snow from central Vir
ginia to central New |er<ey.
"It bears some watching," Corfidi said. "It's a simi

White House lobbies for defense
Washington — The White House is mounting what
one senior administration official calls "a full-court
press" in an effort to reverse a growing public per
ception that the United States is spending too much
money for military purposes.
In an unannounced campaign to counter a trend in
public opinion that has emboldened congressional
critics of President Reagan's defense budget, promi
nent administration officials who rarely speak on mili
tary matters have been instructed to defend the U.S.
buildup at every opportunity.
William Greener, a Pentagon and White House
spokesman in the Ford administration, has been
brought in as a consultant tocoordinate speeches and
publicstatements. And White House officials say that,
within the next few weeks, Reagan will make another
nationally televised appeal for his defense budget,
probably tied to a key vote in Congress.
L.A. Iranians condemn Khomeini
Los Angeles — More than 1000 Iranian opponents
of the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini protested the
fourth anniversary of his rise to power yesterday with
a peaceful march under the watch of mounted police.
The walk along Wilshire Boulevard to the Federal
Building in West Los Angeles capped a weekend of
pro- and anti-Khomeini demonstrations by the local
Iranian community, including a blood drive to protest
"the bloodshed of the Khomeini regime."

Police Sgt. Steve Beitzer estimated the crowd at be
tween 1000 and 1500 marchers and said there were no
counter demonstrations or incidents.
But Said Jabbari, director of the Movement for the
National Independence of Iran, said police estimates
were far too low.
The crowd was "extremely peaceful and orderly,"
said Lt. Larry Welch, one of 30 mounted officers
monitoring the demonstration. "They're a little loud,
that's all."
Chanting "Death to Khomeini" and carrying pic
tures of Reza Shah Pahlavi, the 22-year-old son of the
late Shah of Iran, the demonstrators marched from
the building and back.
On Friday about 100 Khomeini supporters held a
rally at the federal building as Iranians opposed to the
regime donated blood a half block away.
The blood drive, organized by a dozen Iranian
groups, collected about 400 units of blood Friday and
Saturday, said American Red Cross spokesman Ralph
Wright.
There were no attempts to disrupt the blood drive,
but the two groups facing off down the street made
things tense at the Westwood Red Cross center.
London police find bodies
London — Police dug up more bones yesterday in
what British newspapers call a mass murderer's
"garden of secret graves" and let reporters tour the
adjoining house where they say the killer may have
chopped up 17 victims.
They also appealed to anyone who once lived in the
house to come forward and help in the murder
probe.
The bones, found at various locations in the
backyard of the building in the Cricklewood district
of north London, have been sent to a pathologist for
examination. Detective Supt. Norman Briers, leading
the search, said they were most likely human but did
not elaborate.
Scotland Yard has said it expects to find rotting
pieces of as many as 17 victims of a mass murderer
who, according to published reports, met young drif
ters in north London pubs, lured them home,
strangled them, hacked up their corpses and boiled
the pieces.
Dennis Nilsen, 37, a state employment office ex
ecutive, ex-army cook and former probationary Lon
don policeman, was arraigned Saturday on charges of
murdering the only victim yet identified — Stephen
Sinclair, a 20-year-old drifter.
A plumber trying to fix a clogged, smelly sewer dis
covered hunks of Sinclair's body and pieces of two
other cadavers last Wednesday at another house in
nearby Muswell Hill. After Nilsen's arrest Thursday,
police expanded the search to the Cricklewood ad
dress, where he used to live.

Begin takes over Sharon's post
Jerusalem — Prime Minister Menachem Begin
named himself defense minister yesterday and re
duced former Defense Minister Ariel Sharon to the
post of minister without portfolio.
In naming himself to head the defense ministry, Be
gin also indicated that he would name a permanent
successor to Sharon, but gave no indication who that
would be.
Moshe Arens, Israel's ambassador to the United
States, is widely believed to be Begin's first choice for
Sharon's permanent replacement. But some Israeli
newspapers have speculated that Arens is reluctant to
take the job as long as Sharon remains in the Cabinet.
Arens shares Sharon's hardline views on most matters,

but may not relish the idea of having the burley
former general looking over his shoulder.
The Cabinet approved the shuffle, saying the
changes satisified the recommendations of the judical
commission that investigated the Sabra and Chatilla
refugee camps massacre.
The changes are subject to ratification by the
Knesset. A favorable vote is expected because Begin's
coalition holds a clear majority and because if the law
makers reject the plan, Sharon apparently would re
main as defense minister.
Sharon announced Friday that he would relinquish
the defense post. It was widely assumed at the time
that he would remain in the Cabinet as minister
without portfolio.

Critics of the government complained that Sharon
retained a substantial power base in the Cabinet de
spite the commission's conclusion that he was per
sonally responsible for allowing the slaughter of hun
dreds of Palestinian civilians.
Cabinet spokesman Dan Meridor said the Cabinet
approved the reshuffle unanimously and "not even
one minister objected to Sharon's staying in the gov
ernment."
However, the action brought objections from some
Israeli newspapers, which said the move circum
vented the recommendation of the commission
headed by Chief Justice Yitzhak Kahan.
"As long as the defense ministry remains in the
hands of the prime minister, Mr. Sharon can hope to

continue to control the defense establishment," the
nationally circulated Tel Aviv daily Haaretz said in an
editorial.
Hinckley attempts suicide
Washington — john Hinckley, acquitted by reason
of insanity of shooting President Reagan, was hospi
talized in serious condition Sunday following an ap
parent attempt to take his own life by swallowing an
unidentified substance, officials said.
Hinckley was rushed to the intensive care unit of
Greater Southeast Community Hospital and con
nected to a respirator after being discovered semi
conscious on the floor of the mental hospital where
he had been in indefinite confinement, the officials
said.
They said Hinckley's parents, John and JoAnn
Hinckley of Evergreen, Colo., had been notified of
the incident.
James Levy, Greater Southeast's president, said that
Hinckley may be in danger of dying although "he is
stable and we believe he'll be all right."
Hinckley's color was blue when he arrived at the
hospital and the acid level in his blood was severely
high, Levy said.
"I can't give you a prognosis," Levy told reporters at
a press briefing yesterday afternoon. "We will not be
able to tell you for certain for the next 24 to 48 hours
whether he's out of the woods."
Levy said that doctors believe Hinckley took a sub
stance "related to a medication" at St. Elizabeths Hos
pital, where the would-be presidential assassin has
been confined since last year's trial.
Police disperse Warsaw crowds
Warsaw, Poland. — Several hundred police, lob
bing tear gas grenades and flailing rubber batons, dis
persed more than 2000 people demonstrating last
night outside a church for the outlawed Solidarity la
bor union. It was the largest protest demonstration in
Poland in three months.
Between 200 and 300 police moved into position
outside Holy Cross Church in downtown Warsaw as a
commemorative Mass ended for Solidarity members
who had been interned after martial law was imposed
Dec. 13,1981.
Another storm to hit East
Bulldozers and snowplows cleared arteries yester
day through the giant cities of the Northeast im
mobilized by a record blizzard that killed at least 67
people, and major airports opened in time to get
thousands of stranded travelers home for Valentine's
Day.
But a new storm was heading up the East Coast, af
ter dumping snow, sleet and ice pellets on northern
Georgia and much of South Carolina, and the Na
tional Weather Service said the mid-Atlantic Coast
States could expect the same "or even worse."
"The storm will continue moving northeast during
the night and is expected to spread another blanket of
snow along the mid-Atlantic Coast by late tomor
row," the weather service said yesterday.
Steve Corfidi of the Severe Storms Forecast Center
in Kansas City, Mo., said the new storm was likely to
spread three to five inches of snow from central Vir
ginia to central New |er<ey.
"It bears some watching," Corfidi said. "It's a simi
lar situation to the last one."
The Blizzard of '83, which dropped up to three feet
of snow from North Carolina to New England on Fri
day and Saturday, was blamed for the sinking of a coal
ship in which 24 crewmen were killed off the Virginia
coast and 43 other deaths in 11 states and the District
of Columbia.

Coast Guard abandons search
Portsmouth, Virginia — Coast Guard rescuers yes
terday ended their search for nine missing crewmen
from the Marine Electric, a 605-foot, coal-carrying
vessel that capsized and sank off the Virginia coast
early Saturday morning, killing at least 24 of its 36
crewmen.
Only three crew members have been rescued from
the icy waters 30 miles off Chincoteague where the
ship went down. High seas had hindered rescue oper
ations Saturday, but weather was not a factor in yes
terday's decision to call off the search, according to
Barbara Smith, a spokeswoman for the Coast Guard in
Portsmouth, Va., the base for search operations.
Smith said rescue efforts would not resume unless
new evidence is found to suggest that other sailors
had survived. Coast Guard officials said it is highly un
likely that any crewmen still in the water could be
alive. Most people cannot survive more than two
and-a-half hours in 37-degree water.
The Marine Electric left Norfolk Friday morning for
Somerset, Mass., carrying 22,000 tons of coal. Late that
night the ship foundered in 12- to 15-foot waves but
remained afloat for more than seven hours before
sinking at about 12:30 p.m Saturday in 120 feet of wa
ter.
Fire kills 64 in Turin
Turin, Italy — Flames and smoke raced through a
Turin movie theater last night, killing 64 people and
injuring dozens in the crowd of 500, Police Chief An
tonio Fareillo reported.
Police said the fire might have been caused by a
short circuit or by fireworks set off as a joke by
pranksters celebrating Carnival, which is being ob
served throughout Italy. They reported a pistol was
found on the floor, but said it apparently had nothing
to do with the blaze.
The death toll soared when firemen found more
than 20 bodies in a second-floor bathroom and in
rooms used by the management for offices or storage.
Officials said that Raimondo Capello, the 51-year
old theater manager, was arrested and charged with
manslaughter. They gave no details, but several wit
nesses claimed some of the 10 exit doors were locked
and had to be battered open.
U.S. to fight dumping ban
Washington — Top-level U.S. officials from the En
vironmental Protection Agency (EPA), the State De
partment and the Department of Defense will gather
this week in London, where they will oppose a pro
posed change in an international pollution treaty that
would ban all dumping of radioactive wastes in the
world's oceans.
Led by EPA Deputy Administrator John Hernandez,
the delegation marks the first attendance by ranking
U.S. officials at the Convention on the Prevention of
Maritime Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other
Matter. The relatively obscure, 53-nation convention
will hold its seventh annual meeting today through
Thursday.
Several factors account for the heightened Ameri
can interest this year. For one thing, the amendment

by the tiny Pacific island nations of Kiribati and Nauru
is the first formal proposal for such a treaty ban on nu
clear dumping. And it follows by only a few weeks the
action by the lame-duck Congress in December that
placed a two-year moratorium on dumping low-level
radioactive materials in U.S. waters.
Environmental groups, headed by Greenpeace In
ternational, a worldwide conservation organization
that concentrates on protecting oceans and sea life,
are critical of the U.S. position on the treaty amend
ment. The United States wants to send the islanders'
proposal back to the convention's scientific commit
tee for further study.
Queen begins American tour
Kingston, Jamaica — Britain's Queen Elizabeth was
flying to Jamaica yesterday to begin a month-long trip
that will include a visit to President Reagan's ranch in
Santa Barbara and to Stanford.
The queen and her husband, Prince Philip, left chil
ly London aboard a Royal Air Force jet for the
monarch's most extensive tour of thp Western Hemi
sphere tour since she was crowned in 1952.
Jamaican officials say the queen's visit will highlight
this Caribbean island's revived economy and provide
a potential boost to tourism.
"There is very good will between the people of Ja

would be.
Moshe Arens, Israel's ambassador to the United
States, is widely believed to be Begin's first choice for
Sharon's permanent replacement. But some Israeli
newspapers have speculated that Arens is reluctant to
take the job as long as Sharon remains in the Cabinet.
Arens shares Sharon's hardline views on most matters,

but may not relish the idea of having the burley
former general looking over his shoulder.
The Cabinet approved the shuffle, saying the
changes satisified the recommendations of the judical
commission that investigated the Sabra and Chatilla
refugee camps massacre.
The changes are subject to ratification by the
Knesset. A favorable vote is expected because Begin's
coalition holds a clear majority and because if the law
makers reject the plan, Sharon apparently would re
main as defense minister.
Sharon announced Friday that he would relinquish
the defense post. It was widely assumed at the time
that he would remain in the Cabinet as minister
without portfolio.

Critics of the government complained that Sharon
retained a substantial power base in the Cabinet de
spite the commission's conclusion that he was per
sonally responsible for allowing the slaughter of hun
dreds of Palestinian civilians.
Cabinet spokesman Dan Meridor said the Cabinet
approved the reshuffle unanimously and "not even
one minister objected to Sharon's staying in the gov
ernment."
However, the action brought objections from some
Israeli newspapers, which said the move circum
vented the recommendation of the commission
headed by Chief Justice Yitzhak Kahan.
"As long as the defense ministry remains in the
hands of the prime minister, Mr. Sharon can hope to

continue to control the defense establishment," the
nationally circulated Tel Aviv daily Haaretz said in an
editorial.
Hinckley attempts suicide
Washington — john Hinckley, acquitted by reason
of insanity of shooting President Reagan, was hospi
talized in serious condition Sunday following an ap
parent attempt to take his own life by swallowing an
unidentified substance, officials said.
Hinckley was rushed to the intensive care unit of
Greater Southeast Community Hospital and con
nected to a respirator after being discovered semi
conscious on the floor of the mental hospital where
he had been in indefinite confinement, the officials
said.
They said Hinckley's parents, John and JoAnn
Hinckley of Evergreen, Colo., had been notified of
the incident.
James Levy, Greater Southeast's president, said that
Hinckley may be in danger of dying although "he is
stable and we believe he'll be all right."
Hinckley's color was blue when he arrived at the
hospital and the acid level in his blood was severely
high, Levy said.
"I can't give you a prognosis," Levy told reporters at
a press briefing yesterday afternoon. "We will not be
able to tell you for certain for the next 24 to 48 hours
whether he's out of the woods."
Levy said that doctors believe Hinckley took a sub
stance "related to a medication" at St. Elizabeths Hos
pital, where the would-be presidential assassin has
been confined since last year's trial.
Police disperse Warsaw crowds
Warsaw, Poland. — Several hundred police, lob
bing tear gas grenades and flailing rubber batons, dis
persed more than 2000 people demonstrating last
night outside a church for the outlawed Solidarity la
bor union. It was the largest protest demonstration in
Poland in three months.
Between 200 and 300 police moved into position
outside Holy Cross Church in downtown Warsaw as a
commemorative Mass ended for Solidarity members
who had been interned after martial law was imposed
Dec. 13,1981.
Another storm to hit East
Bulldozers and snowplows cleared arteries yester
day through the giant cities of the Northeast im
mobilized by a record blizzard that killed at least 67
people, and major airports opened in time to get
thousands of stranded travelers home for Valentine's
Day.
But a new storm was heading up the East Coast, af
ter dumping snow, sleet and ice pellets on northern
Georgia and much of South Carolina, and the Na
tional Weather Service said the mid-Atlantic Coast
States could expect the same "or even worse."
"The storm will continue moving northeast during
the night and is expected to spread another blanket of
snow along the mid-Atlantic Coast by late tomor
row," the weather service said yesterday.
Steve Corfidi of the Severe Storms Forecast Center
in Kansas City, Mo., said the new storm was likely to
spread three to five inches of snow from central Vir
ginia to central New |er<ey.
"It bears some watching," Corfidi said. "It's a simi
lar situation to the last one."
The Blizzard of '83, which dropped up to three feet
of snow from North Carolina to New England on Fri
day and Saturday, was blamed for the sinking of a coal
ship in which 24 crewmen were killed off the Virginia
coast and 43 other deaths in 11 states and the District
of Columbia.

Coast Guard abandons search
Portsmouth, Virginia — Coast Guard rescuers yes
terday ended their search for nine missing crewmen
from the Marine Electric, a 605-foot, coal-carrying
vessel that capsized and sank off the Virginia coast
early Saturday morning, killing at least 24 of its 36
crewmen.
Only three crew members have been rescued from
the icy waters 30 miles off Chincoteague where the
ship went down. High seas had hindered rescue oper
ations Saturday, but weather was not a factor in yes
terday's decision to call off the search, according to
Barbara Smith, a spokeswoman for the Coast Guard in
Portsmouth, Va., the base for search operations.
Smith said rescue efforts would not resume unless
new evidence is found to suggest that other sailors
had survived. Coast Guard officials said it is highly un
likely that any crewmen still in the water could be
alive. Most people cannot survive more than two
and-a-half hours in 37-degree water.
The Marine Electric left Norfolk Friday morning for
Somerset, Mass., carrying 22,000 tons of coal. Late that
night the ship foundered in 12- to 15-foot waves but
remained afloat for more than seven hours before
sinking at about 12:30 p.m Saturday in 120 feet of wa
ter.
Fire kills 64 in Turin
Turin, Italy — Flames and smoke raced through a
Turin movie theater last night, killing 64 people and
injuring dozens in the crowd of 500, Police Chief An
tonio Fareillo reported.
Police said the fire might have been caused by a
short circuit or by fireworks set off as a joke by
pranksters celebrating Carnival, which is being ob
served throughout Italy. They reported a pistol was
found on the floor, but said it apparently had nothing
to do with the blaze.
The death toll soared when firemen found more
than 20 bodies in a second-floor bathroom and in
rooms used by the management for offices or storage.
Officials said that Raimondo Capello, the 51-year
old theater manager, was arrested and charged with
manslaughter. They gave no details, but several wit
nesses claimed some of the 10 exit doors were locked
and had to be battered open.
U.S. to fight dumping ban
Washington — Top-level U.S. officials from the En
vironmental Protection Agency (EPA), the State De
partment and the Department of Defense will gather
this week in London, where they will oppose a pro
posed change in an international pollution treaty that
would ban all dumping of radioactive wastes in the
world's oceans.
Led by EPA Deputy Administrator John Hernandez,
the delegation marks the first attendance by ranking
U.S. officials at the Convention on the Prevention of
Maritime Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other
Matter. The relatively obscure, 53-nation convention
will hold its seventh annual meeting today through
Thursday.
Several factors account for the heightened Ameri
can interest this year. For one thing, the amendment

by the tiny Pacific island nations of Kiribati and Nauru
is the first formal proposal for such a treaty ban on nu
clear dumping. And it follows by only a few weeks the
action by the lame-duck Congress in December that
placed a two-year moratorium on dumping low-level
radioactive materials in U.S. waters.
Environmental groups, headed by Greenpeace In
ternational, a worldwide conservation organization
that concentrates on protecting oceans and sea life,
are critical of the U.S. position on the treaty amend
ment. The United States wants to send the islanders'
proposal back to the convention's scientific commit
tee for further study.
Queen begins American tour
Kingston, Jamaica — Britain's Queen Elizabeth was
flying to Jamaica yesterday to begin a month-long trip
that will include a visit to President Reagan's ranch in
Santa Barbara and to Stanford.
The queen and her husband, Prince Philip, left chil
ly London aboard a Royal Air Force jet for the
monarch's most extensive tour of thp Western Hemi
sphere tour since she was crowned in 1952.
Jamaican officials say the queen's visit will highlight
this Caribbean island's revived economy and provide
a potential boost to tourism.
"There is very good will between the people of Ja
maica and the queen. The moment she steps on this
soil, she will be accepted as the queen of Jamaica,"
said Sir Florizel Glasspole.
As governor-general, Glasspole is the queen's of
ficial — and mostly ceremonial — representative in
Jamaica, which is independent and a member of the
Commonwealth.
White House lobbies for defense
Washington — The White House is mounting what
one senior administration official calls "a full-court
press" in an effort to reverse a growing public per
ception that the United States is spending too much
money for military purposes.
In an unannounced campaign to counter a trend in
public opinion that has emboldened congressional
critics of President Reagan's defense budget, promi
nent administration officials who rarely speak on mili
tary matters have been instructed to defend the U.S.
buildup at every opportunity.
William Greener, a Pentagon and White House
spokesman in the Ford administration, has been
brought in as a consultant tocoordinate speeches and
publicstatements. And White House officials say that,
within the next few weeks, Reagan will make another
nationally televised appeal for his defense budget,
probably tied to a key vote in Congress.
L.A. Iranians condemn Khomeini
Los Angeles — More than 1000 Iranian opponents
of the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini protested the
fourth anniversary of his rise to power yesterday with
a peaceful march under the watch of mounted police.
The walk along Wilshire Boulevard to the Federal
Building in West Los Angeles capped a weekend of
pro- and anti-Khomeini demonstrations by the local
Iranian community, including a blood drive to protest
"the bloodshed of the Khomeini regime."

Police Sgt. Steve Beitzer estimated the crowd at be
tween 1000 and 1500 marchers and said there were no
counter demonstrations or incidents.
But Said Jabbari, director of the Movement for the
National Independence of Iran, said police estimates
were far too low.
The crowd was "extremely peaceful and orderly,"
said Lt. Larry Welch, one of 30 mounted officers
monitoring the demonstration. "They're a little loud,
that's all."
Chanting "Death to Khomeini" and carrying pic
tures of Reza Shah Pahlavi, the 22-year-old son of the
late Shah of Iran, the demonstrators marched from
the building and back.
On Friday about 100 Khomeini supporters held a
rally at the federal building as Iranians opposed to the
regime donated blood a half block away.
The blood drive, organized by a dozen Iranian
groups, collected about 400 units of blood Friday and
Saturday, said American Red Cross spokesman Ralph
Wright.
There were no attempts to disrupt the blood drive,
but the two groups facing off down the street made
things tense at the Westwood Red Cross center.
London police find bodies
London — Police dug up more bones yesterday in
what British newspapers call a mass murderer's
"garden of secret graves" and let reporters tour the
adjoining house where they say the killer may have
chopped up 17 victims.
They also appealed to anyone who once lived in the
house to come forward and help in the murder
probe.
The bones, found at various locations in the
backyard of the building in the Cricklewood district
of north London, have been sent to a pathologist for
examination. Detective Supt. Norman Briers, leading
the search, said they were most likely human but did
not elaborate.
Scotland Yard has said it expects to find rotting
pieces of as many as 17 victims of a mass murderer
who, according to published reports, met young drif
ters in north London pubs, lured them home,
strangled them, hacked up their corpses and boiled
the pieces.
Dennis Nilsen, 37, a state employment office ex
ecutive, ex-army cook and former probationary Lon
don policeman, was arraigned Saturday on charges of
murdering the only victim yet identified — Stephen
Sinclair, a 20-year-old drifter.
A plumber trying to fix a clogged, smelly sewer dis
covered hunks of Sinclair's body and pieces of two
other cadavers last Wednesday at another house in
nearby Muswell Hill. After Nilsen's arrest Thursday,
police expanded the search to the Cricklewood ad
dress, where he used to live.
Today's weather
Sunny and a little warmer after patchy morning fog.
