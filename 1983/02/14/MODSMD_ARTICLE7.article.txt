## Gary Robinson: the madness and the man behind the music 
### JULIANN ANDERSON 
Asakid,hepushed over Christmas
trees.
"Yeah, I was a real brat," said
senior Gary Robinson, who is simul
taneously manager of the Leland
Stanford junior University Marching
Band, resident assistant in Florence
Moore and mechanical engineering
student.
"When my mom would be walking
home from the store with us, I'd wait
until she'd have her arms full of bags at
the bus stop — then I'd run away. It
was about a 40-minute wait for her.
When she got home, she really wore
me out," Robinson said.

'There's not one musician that I've met from
another school who didn't wish he was like us.
We're free to express ourselves as we see fit.'

Remnants of his boyhood antics
still peek out sometimes in Robin
son, as when he wore a referee's un
iform while conducting the Band at
the Cal basketball game. Frequently
throwing his arms up in the now
infamous touchdown signal, he glee
fully displayed an oversized check,
very obviously signed by Cal, on the
back of his striped shirt.
Accompanying his quest for a
good time is a very serious and or
ganized nature, which becomes ap
parent when he conducts ordinary
band business.
Last Monday night before the
Arizona game, band members were
donning slickers and pork-pie hats
while warming up on their horns and
gossipping. Into the Band Shak,
which is lined with signs ranging
from an old Marine recruiting poster
to various semi-obscenities, walked
Robinson.
Dressed in a muted green flight
jacket and standard Levi's, he curtly
said, "All right; it's ticket time."
Quickly handing out the ducats, he
had his group in order, and after dis
appearing into a back room for about
a minute and a half, Robinson was
"out of there," as he is fond of say
ing.
According to junior Ben Langlotz,
assistant band manager, Robinson
has "very strong pride in the organi
zation. He feels it reflects him; he
wants to make it look and sound
good."
Robinson's term will run through

next year's Big Game, and during that
time he wants to change the Band's
relationship with students. He said,
"I'd like to see it more open to stu
dents — to have them identify with
who we are.' He said he wished
people would take a more personal
interest in the group.
If students have ideas for songs,
we have someone who will arrange
them. Say Look Band, I want you to
play this song — here is the tape,'
and we'll do it,"he added.
The Band, Robinson said, "is the
only organization that gets people
excited about an event. No other or
ganization has the tradition we do."

The Dollies are another group that
he is extremely proud of, and he
would like to try out some new ideas
with them as well. Robinson doesn't
foresee anything like the UCLA or
USC pom-pom girls with sweatered
and megaphoned yell-leaders. "That
mentality is totally wrong here," he
said, but some new routines might
be fun. "If the Dollies could do
stunts, everyone would be keyed,"
he added, in reference to some other
teams which have tumblers.
One of the Dollies, Betsy DePalma,
said, "He takes us seriously. It's im
portant to him that we're quality."
As far as game morale and cheer
ing is concerned, Robinson said, "I'd
like to get more interaction (between
the band and the fans). The only in
teraction is just the jump in 'All Right
Now.' "
When asked about how the Band
would have marched in the Rose
Parade if Stanford had been invited,
Robinson said "probably in diapers
or something. We're not the all-
American sense of a band, but as in
dividuals we are, though. We each
have our own personal amibitions
and goals.
"Stanford students have a lot of
wit, and I want the Band to reflect
that." He added, "There's not one
musician that I've met from another
school who didn't wish he was like
us. We're free to express ourselves
as we see fit."
According to senior Simon Streets,
the next drum major for the Band,

Robinson "knows when to be a
leader and when to be a groupie. I
like Gary for the tact that he does not
just have one thing that he is dealing
with. He works with the Band, his
dorm, and his academics. He can
shift gears very fast."
Robinson himself attested to tins:
"One time after a basketball game I
just grabbed my backpack, jumped
on my bike, and went right over to
Meyer Library. Someone looked
kind of strangely at me and asked,
Weren't you just at the basketball
game a few minutes ago?' And I said
Uh-huh.' I think that people like to
see Band members actually study
ing."
In Paloma, where he is one ot three
RAs, Robinson does everything from
offering advice in house meetings to

watching soap operas. "I like 'The
Guiding Light', but I still know what's
going on in The Young and the Rest
less' and 'As the World Turns,'" he
said.
Living in a small single on the third
floor, Robinson teams up with the
other two RAs, Marsha Barr and Tom
Maliska, to plan projects for the

treshman dorm. Early in the quarter
these included marching the frosh
down to the Oval in their "jammies"
on the pretense ot an earthquake
drill. As the new Palomans stood
shivering and disgusted, Robinson
and Barr screeched into a parking
space and charged across the lawn,
each bearing bags of champagne,
strawberries, |uice, melon, bagels
and cream cheese.
Freshman )en Grant, a third-floor
neighbor of Robinson's said, "He's
helped in a lot ot pinches. One time I
was having problems when a friend of
mine tried to commit suicide. Gary
just dropped everything and talked to
me for about an hour."
Grant added, It's obvious that he
must be a great leader because of the
turnout at his birthday party," referr

ing to the clandestine celebration of
Robinson's 21st birthday held last
quarter on the east fourth-floor patio
of Meyer. All of Paloma and a large
portion of the Band slipped onto the
windy balcony and waited for other
conspirators to kidnap Robinson.
"I'll never forget him at the birth
day party. He stood up and talked

about how great it was to be an RA
and band manager. When he got
back he crawled up the stairs. He was
so bombed." said Marsha Barr.
Concerning their method of con
ducting dorm business, Barr said, "I
walk into Gary's room and he turns
up the music so we can gossip. We
spent 45 minutes bitching, 45 min
utes talking business and 45 minutes
gossiping ."
Upon entering Robinson's little
room, one first confronts the large,
foaming beer mug message board.
Last Wednesday night he was just
coming out of the throes of an all
night budget preparation, so various
shoes, books, papers shirts and a
nine-inch stack of Wall Street lour
rials were spread underfoot.
Posters and tapestries decorated
the room with F-16s fl/ing above the
door, Washington D.C. looming
above the twin bed and Tip O'Neill's
photo, among those of other con
gressmen, next to Washington. A
small cork rectangle was tacked
above the stereo, and a House of
Representatives emblem is stuck
thereon, along with an autographed
Bxlo glossy of Robinson and Rep.
lames Santini (D-Nev.).
All of the Washington parapher
nalia comes from Robinson's intern
ship "on the Hill" as an aide to San
tini during the spring quarter of his
sophomore year. He said the intern
ship was a way of exploring his inter

'Stanford students have a lot of wit, and I want the
band to reflect that/

ests in foreign policy and national de
fense.
Roninson would like to take his
experience one step further, in the
form of education. "I'm looking at a
joint law and business degree," he
said. These potential degrees would
combine with the co-terminal pro
gram he is in now. He is currently
working toward a bachelor's degree
in mechanical engineering and a
master's degree in materials science.
"I'd like to start a company, maybe;
something that needs to be done or
produced," he said.
If it hadn't been for his bad
eyesight, though, he would be flying
jets now, for he was accepted at both
the Air Force Academy and An
napolis, as well as such "civvie"
schools as Harvard and Georgia

Tech.
His father, Henry Robinson, is a
retired Air Force Chief Master
Sergeant. Discussing his son's ambi
tions, he said, "He always wanted to
fly — he wanted to be a Navy pilot
Gary, and his two brothers,
and Henry, lived on various military
bases in the United States, Europe
and Asia. Gary was born on the
Tachikawa air base in )apan.
Moving helped him to adapt
quickly, he said. "When I got here I
didn't have any head trips; I had no
qualms about being the new kid.
Every new place becomes home just
like the last place."
Craig, with whom Gary is "best
friends," said Gary picked up the alto
sax in Germany during the sixth
grade, and has kept up with it ever
since.
Other interests of Robinson's in
clude running, reading James Bond
novels, and listening to the Jacksons,
Lionel Ritchie and the Commodores.
Also, "He likes to make popcorn,
with lots of butter, just the way I like
it," said )en Grant.
In talking about Gary Robinson in
the whole, Tom Maliska said, I
wouldn't want to change Gary at all
— everything he does is with forward
concentration."
Streets, trying to come up with
something negative about his man
ager after so much positive material,
said, "Well, he hasn't quite devel-

oped the appropriate time to cut ott a
song in a basketball game when the
team comes back on court." He also
talked about Robinson's laugh.
"When he's having a good time he
will have his mouth open. He won t
just be grinning his teeth — he'll hold
his whole mouth wide open and
laugh."
Robinson said, "It's not the ac
tivities and grades I'll remember —
they'll fade after a while — it's the
relationships that matter. People are
the important thing." And with a
hearty "I wanna party with you cow
boy!" Gary Dehaven Robinson will
meet the future. Fate doesn't seem to
even have a role here. With his
pocket planner in hand and organi
zation in head, Robinson has it all (
under control.
