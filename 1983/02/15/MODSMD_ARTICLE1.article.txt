Plans for further improvement in bicycle safety and campus iighling were
emphasized at a meeting yesterday of the University Personal Safety Com
mittee, along with the possibility of restructuring the SURt escort service
and University alcohol policy.
Dan Smith, coordinator of special services for the Stanford Police Depart
ment, said a number of bicycle safety projects were underway. "Currently,
we're working on an awareness program to discourage people from riding at
night without lights. He said this program was being "followed up by en
forcement. A little over 100 citations were given to people for riding without
lights by patrol persons recently. This enforcement is to remind people how
dangerous it is to ride without a light."
Stanford Police Chief Marvin Herrington said, "the idea is to try and mak
it (the issuance of citations) somewhat unpredictable in regard to timing and
location."
A tagging program (notification of violation with no fine), designed to
discourage people from parking their bikes in unauthorized areas has also
been a priority recently, according to Smith. "First we tag the bike and if the
problem continues, we move the bike. It's a real problem when bikes block
doorways and ramps for the handicapped."
Smith, also a member of the bicycle Safety Committee, said reaction to the
bicycle lanes added along the Quad and in White Plaza is under study. A
questionnaire recently distributed to students is currently being analyzed.
"Overall we're getting a positive response," he said.
Other campus safety improvements include new lighting. Original light
ing on the pathway through the middle of Fscondido Village has been
supplemented with additional fixtures, according to Row Manager Diana
Coriklin. "Additional lights have been placed along Olinstead Road paraiiel
ing !i>erra Street," she said, "to improve lighting for pedestrians and bicyc
lists using this perimeter road within Escondido Village."
However, the committee reported that funding for future campus lighting
projects, nas bet-n cut from nearly $175,UUU last yeai to $50,UU0 thib year.
Derek Passarelli, director of SURE, said the number of people volunteer
ing to serve as escorts increased following recent media coverage. Although
this response has been helpful, Passarelli announced a proposal to reor

NO PARKING ZONE: In an effort to improve campus safety, police have
implemented a new system of labeling bicycles (but not fining owners)
that are parked in improper areas. They are also issuing citations to
cyclists traveling at night without lights.
