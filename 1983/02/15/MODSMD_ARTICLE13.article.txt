# OPINIONS
## The 						Stanford Daily Ban the bomb at SSRL 
### 
It seems that not since the spring of 1969
when hundreds of students demonstrated at
the Stanford Research Institute (SRI) has there
been such strong opposition to University war
related research.
The issue has come up again as hundreds of
faculty and staff at the Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center (SLAC) have signed a petition
opposing the construction of beam lines at the
Stanford Synchotron Radiation Laboratory
(SSRL) which would aid in the development of
nuclear weapons. The research proposal was
made by three of the nation's largest nuclear
weapons research labs, including Los Alamos,
Lawrence Livermore, and Sandia National. Al
though SLAC and SSRL are administratively
separate, they share the accelerator center's
storage ring for their research.
In 1969, when demonstrating students de
manded that the University tighten its restric
tions over SRl's war-related research, the board
of trustees decided instead to sever its ties with
SRI completely. We are sure that such drastic
action will not be necessary to avoid conflict in
this case, but there is cause for concern. The
faculty and staff at SLAC and SSRI. are serious
about their opposition to nuclear weapons re
search at SSRL, and the issue deserves close
attention.
High-energy physics research at SLAC is a
source of pride for the University as some of the
world's pioneering research is conducted in our
own backyard. SLAC has been able to attract so
many top-level physics researchers because
they know that no weapons research takes place
here, according to SSRL director Arthur
Bienenstock. As one staff member stated simply
"there was a tacit understanding when we came
here that that kind of work wasn't going to be

done.''
It may be true that construction of the beam
lines will bring much-needed funding (about $5
million) to SLAC and may make many other
types of research possible. But the proposal
presents immeasurable dangers to the future of
the facilities. If the weapons research proposal
is approved, SLAC may no longer be able to
attract those leading physicists who are dedi
cated to participating in basic, non war-related
physics research. Furthermore, the proposal
threatens to divide the researchers and the Uni
versity into two opposing camps. The greatest
danger is that, in the end, the facilities may lose
some of those outstanding faculty or staff who
may feel alienated or betrayed by the Universi
ty's action.
By rejecting the proposal, the University will
not be "backing down." to "threats" or "ul
timatums" by petition signers. On the contrary,
the University will only be acknowledging that
the concerns of the faculty and staff at SLAC are
also the University's concerns. We advocate
keeping SSRL a center for research with osten
sibly peaceful applications, rather than turning
it into a center for nuclear weapons research by
jumping headlong into large-scale weapons
projects. This goal is in everyone's interest. "We
are not going to actively participate in nuclear
weapons," one staff member stated simply.
"That's not why we're here."
While it may be many months before a review
panel makes a recommendation to
Bienenstock, public debate over the proposal
will certainly continue to intensify until the
issue is resolved. We only hope the University
will act quickly to reject this ill-advised propo
sal.
