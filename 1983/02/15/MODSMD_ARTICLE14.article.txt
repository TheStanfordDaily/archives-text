# Let them eat cafeteria style
## 
### 
In its report last year, the ASSU Food Service
Task Force recommended that the University
experiment with a fee-for-service, cafeteria
style system in order to cut waste and possibly
improve quality.
As food.service prices soar and quality falters,
it is encouraging to see that the University has
decided to go ahead with an experimental fee
for-service plan at Sterling Quad next fall.
Currently, several different fee-for-service
proposals are under consideration by the Uni
versity. These range from plans with strict usage
minimums which differ little from the status
quo, to genuine cafeteria-like plans where
every item is priced and students can choose
exactly what, when and if they want to eat.
Under nearly every proposal the present meal
card system will be supplemented with account
ing innovations as simple as a coupon system or
as sophisticated as a computerized, magnetic
food service card.
The Residential Education office reportedly
favors plans with usage minimums, which they
find less threatening to the residential educa
tion system. Students might be given a coupon
book that contains six dollars in coupons good
only on a specific day. This would have the de
sired effect of forcing students to choose be
tween an extra serving of potatoes and two de
sserts, therebv eliminating some waste. How
ever, coupons which went unused on any par
ticular day would simply become invalid and we
find this an inequitable solution for those stu
dents whose schedules or appetites make it im
possible for them to use all the coupons which
they are required to purchase.
The reasoning behind such plans is that stu
dents will continue to spend countless hours at

residence dining halls discussing Plato and the
causes of the French Revolution only if they are
forced to.
The University fears that the residential edu
cation system might be damaged if the plan
which we advocate, a no-minimum, cafeteria
style system, is implemented. Under such a
plan, students could purchase a magnetic meal
card at the start of every quarter with a cash
value of their choosing. Each time they used the
card, the cost of the items they purchased
would be subtracted from its value and the new
vaiue would be stored in the card's magnetic
memory. In addition, whatever cash value re
mained at the end of the quarter would be re
funded. Only under a system such as this can
students be assured of getting exactly what they
pay for.
The University's fear that the implementation
of a cafeteria-style service would cause students
to abandon food service dining halls in favor of
McDonald's and Domino's are simply un
founded. In fact, we can easily imagine an op
posite effect: as student likes and dislikes are
made better known to food service through
selective purchases, both quality and the
number of hours spent in the dining hall could
increase. In any event, just the attraction of reg
ularly dining with the same group of friends and
the proximity of dining complexes to the dorms
insure that food service will not be abandoned.
We are enthusiastic about the University's
willingness to experiment with a system that is
presently inefficient and unfair. We can only
hope that the experiment eventually developed
for Sterling Quad is as efficient and as equitable
as possible. To us, a fee-for-service, cafeteria
stvle system seems to offer the best solution.
