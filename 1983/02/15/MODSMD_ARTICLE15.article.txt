# Becoming computer literate
## 
### 
There is one Stanford experience
that is slowly moving into the Olym
pus of all-time "experiences" that
any student wanting to "graduate"
must go through In addition to the
traditional events like becoming a
Stanford woman/man, going to the
Big Game Rally and jogging to the
Dish, every self-respecting student
from now on is going to have to take
one computer science class during
his/her undergraduate years at the
Farm.
Those refusing to conform to this
new tradition will risk being looked
upon by their peers and others as
basket-case humanists lacking
school spirit and the desire for post
graduation employment. Therefore,
regardless of your major — be it clas
sic s biology, industrial engineering,
history, or whatever else — you
should include in your c urriculum at
least one of those renowned "job
getters" offered by the Computer
Science Department.
Being acquainted with the in
trica< ies of hardware and software is
not as crucial to the understanding of

life in the '80s as some people would
have us believe. The motivation to
learn about computers should stem
from a genuine interest in that area of
knowledge and not from the desire
to increase the marketability of one's
degree.
As lack Falvey points out in a re
cent article in The Wall Street /ournal,
computer technology is advancing
so rapidly that feeling comfortable
with a terminal or having the ability
to program is not and never will be a
prerequisite for a successful career
in most fields. To stress this point he
draws an interesting analogy be
tween computers and telephones.
The telephone industry, he writes,
has advanced to the point where an
individual need not have any knowl
edge of telecommunications
technology in order to complete a
long-distance call. Since similar de
velopments will most likely occur in
the computer industry, Falvey ad
vises people "to be patient and be
secure in your ignorance. . . the
machines are coming to us "
It is interesting to note that we are

already at the advanced stages in the
research that will allow us to talk di
rectly to computers without having
to use alpha-numerical keyboards
and to replace software with
"firmware" — a new, revolutionary
type of chip which automatically
transforms our instructions into
computer language.
Seen in lhis light, doubts arise as to
whether enduring long nights at
LOTS will necessarily increase a stu
dent's ( hance of getting one of those
glamorous high-paying jobs which
recession-afflicted liberal arts majors
are desperately pursuing. Unless the
purpose of attending Stanford was
merely to acquire a set of skills
needed to get a job after graduation
— in which case we should all go to
trade st hool instead — taking a com
puter science class will just turn out
to be a painful and useless experi
ence.
