## Science and war at Stanford 
### 
Should nuclear weapons research
be conducted at Stanford University?
The answer of 15 faculty and some
280 staff members at the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC),
who signed a petition opposing such
proposed research at the Stanford
Synchnotron Radiation Laboratory
(SSRL), is a clear and resounding No
(Daily, Feb. 7). These scientists, sev
eral of whom I am proud to say are
personal friends, have done SLAC
and Stanford a tremendous service
by taking a strong role in defining
what the research program of the
University should and should not be.
They have shown that research is to
be judged not solely on its scientific
merits, but on its moral and political
merits as well.
I think the opposition of these
physicists and engineers to the pro
posed weapons research is very sig
nificant for several reasons. First, it
shows that the nuclear freeze
movement and demands for an end
to the arms race is not something that
is happening "out there." These is
sues come closer to Stanford than we
might ordinarily think, and we can
affect them in the course of our pro
fessional careers. Secondly, opposi
tion to weapons research shows that
scientists, who work in a field said to
be value-free, can and must take
moral responsibility for what they
do. This message has not been lost
on physicists, who in the famous
words of Robert Oppenheimer
"knew sin" when the first atom
bomb exploded. And finally, the op
position to weapons research illumi
nates part of the complicated web in
which the research university, the
government, the Defense and re
lated military departments, and in
dustry are inextricably intertwined.
Stanford did not become a great
university until the government
began to spend huge sums of money
on research at Stanford and similar
institutions. Most of this activity
began after World War 11, when the
partnership between government,
military and university was forged in
the applications of science to war,
particularly in the development of
the atom bomb and radar. The nation
and government were left in debt to
the accomplishments of the scien
tists. The scientists gained a political

niche in which they could pro
foundly affect the behavior of gov
ernment. Scientists such as Vannevar
Bush of M.I.T. and lames Conant of
Harvard, acquired great political in
fluence. They helped direct millions
of dollars of government money to
ward basic research in the university.
We are beneficiaries of their ef
forts. It does not matter whether you
study poetry or pulsars, religion or
relativity, Sylvia Plath or higher math.
Through the overhead system, every
time the government givesa dollarto
fund a research project at Stanford, it
gives 69 cents to the University to run
the libraries, pay staff, and if one ig
nores the niceties of accounting,
pay for the grass to be green and for
de Guerre pool to be full of water.
There is simply no way to get around
the fact that we all feed daily out of
the government trough, including
lots of money from the military, and
that the sustenance of the entire
University, from the humanities to
the sciences, is almost synonymous
with that relationship.
Those who believe that taking
money from the military interests in
the government is ipso facto bad
deny the obvious fact that this sup
port has been and is a central con
tributor to the resources of Stanford.
Yet neither does this support mean
that Stanford is a puppet of the mili
tary, though we may be a leisure
service industry of it. Instead, Stan
ford strikes a delicate and symbiotic
balance between the needs of the
government and military, and its own
research interests. When the
"strings attached" to this federal
munificence get too binding, hope
fully those in the University resist the
coercion and the temptation. This is
exactly what happened at SLAC.
I don't think that decisions about
what is morally good or bad research
at Stanford should be engraved in
stone. We have to consistantly
choose, evaluate, and reevaluate
what activities are appropriate. So
scientists don't just do science: as
citizens of influence, they have to
continually make political decisions.
Or someone else will decide for
them.
But how is a scientist to decide
what is pure and what is applied,

what ideas are constructive and what
are destructive? The difference be
tween pure and applied,Jike the per
ception of beauty, is in the eye of the
beholder. What a mathematician
may think is an interesting way to
estimate the solution to a differential
equation may predict the position of
a cloud, or a bomber. What was pure
to the mathematician has become
applied to someone else: the two see
the same idea in different perspec
tive because of the difference in their
priorities. Sometimes this difference
can be quite sinister when the scien
tist turns his head from what he
knows is a destructive application,
well described in Tom Lehrer's
parody of Werner von Braun: "Once
the rockets go up, who knows where
they come down/ That's not my de
partment. .
Another danger in the clouded re
lationship of theory and practice is
that today's theory is the application
of the future. Fifty years ago, promi
nent physicists believed nuclear fis
sion had no practical value or appli
cation. They have never been so
wrong. Forty years ago, the English
pure mathematician, Godfrey Hardy,
boasted that number theory was of
no practical value. Today, the Na
tional Security Agency tries to clas
sify the application of number theory
to cryptanalysis and the design of
secret codes. High energy physicists
say their research is of no use to any
one else, but others claim their re
search can be used to design
particle-beam weapons.
Nobody can definitely say where
the creative energies and interests of
today's scientists will lead, tomorrow
or in the future. The alternatives are
to eschew science altogether, or to
actively participate in where it will
go. That participation must con
stantly adapt to the changing world
in which we live. Those scientists at
SLAC who have opposed the plans
for weapons research at SSRL are an
example of that active participation
They have drawn a border line be
tween their research and nuclear
weapons development. Like Caesar
at the Rubicon, but a good deal wiser
than Caesar, they have firmly de
cided not to cross the border.
