## Aid and the draft 
### 
An editorial entitled "All students
deserve aid," (Daily, Feb. 4) stated
that "A basic principle of justice in
our society is that all laws must be
enforced uniformly. Selective en
forcement encourages contempt for
the law and can lead to social un
rest."
I laud you on your brilliant legal
observations but caution you to be
more consistent in the future. The
obvious corollary of equal enforce
ment is equal compliance, and your
failure to realize this is the cause of
your errant conclusions.
Nowhere in the Constitution does
it say that we are free to pick and
choose which laws we wish to follow.
In penalizing those who fail to regis
ter, President Reagan is merely fulfil
ling his oath to uphold the Constitu
tion, while Benjamin Sasway and his
buddies are violating it. Registration,
which incidentally was passed by
former President Jimmy Carter and
Congress, is the law. You are free to
debate the merits of that law, but you
have no right to criticize President
Reagan for abiding by the Constitu
tion. The Administration is doing its
best to enforce the law. Restricting
aid is only one means of accomplish
ing that end.
Answer me this: should the gov
ernment pay those who are breaking
the law?
