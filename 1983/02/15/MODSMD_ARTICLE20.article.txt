## Clapton melts into past and oozes well with the flow 
### STEFAN MALMOLI 
Any performer who has been with us since the '60s has
to face the fact that regardless of the quality of their
present-day performances, the general consensus is
that their every performance was great. The '60s have
seemed to have left behind a magical and mystical legacy
that disallows any real or harsh criticism from the fans. It
is as if a sense of rock history has been instilled into the
audience, thus transforming mediocre performances
into "classic" concerts. This, of course, is a problem as it
works against new bands from gaining touring popular
ity and acceptance.
Above all, it works against a truly great show put on by
an old, yet still vital act. Who really carefully listened to
and dissected the musical quality of the Who's final
shows? The musical quality was based upon the fact that
this was The Who and they just can't be bad. However,
this prevented many from grasping how good they really
were on any musical level that disregarded their Who
legacy. I think the same misfortune has more recently
plagued Eric Clapton at his admirable appearance at the
Cow Palace on February 7.
The main point in seeing Clapton for the majority of
the throng that jammed the Cow Palace was just to say
that they saw one of the few remaining '60s gods. In
seeing Clapton, they were fulfilling their dreams of se
eing Clapton playing the dinky marquee Club with the
Yardbirds or in seeing Cream at the Fillmore East when
people were writing "Clapton Is Cod" on the walls out
side. It was the catching a glimpse of history right before
their eyes, and no matter the true musical worth of the
concert, the fans would still be satisfied. Therefore, this
must affect Clapton deeply in regard to his playing reac
tion (and it has in the past). He knows that if he flubbed a
guitar solo (Heaven forbid for Slowhand!), the crowd
would still scream and cheer hysterically. It was a dead
end course.
Thankfully though, at the Cow Palace, Clapton did
perform flawlessly for those few who came to hear great
blues-rock and not to see Eric Clapton, formerly of
Cream, Blind Faith, Derek and the Dominos, et al.
Ripping into "After Midnight," Clapton led a superb
back-up band (including Donald "Duck" Dunn on bass)
through two hours of the most heartfelt blues-rock I
have ever seen or heard. Uncommonly sporting a smile
throughout the whole show, Clapton was somehow hav
ing fun playing the blues and still making it credible. His
voice was in strong shape and clearer than usual, his
guitar playing was simply awesome. It is one thing to
listen to Clapton on record, but it is a joy to watch him
play.

His guitar fills in between lines and breaths of the song
art' more captivating than most guitarists whole solos. It
is impossible to describe how Clapton can play so many
similar blues songs and yet make each one sound origi
nal, unique, and breathtaking. His version of Derek and
the dominos' "Key To The Highway" was as dexterous
and moving as the original version, and his solo during
tht• slow ballad "Wonderful Tonight" may have been the
sweetest, smoothest thing to emanate from his guitar
that night.
However, Clapton was not only content to play
straight blues copies. He expanded on many songs and
added a few extra surprises as well. "I Shot The Sheriff"
had a much more apparent reggae riffing along with a
more Jamaican pronunciation of the lyrics. Therefore,
rather than a nice pop song, it was transformed into a
desperate, scary plea for escape from the law. Then, on
"Blues Power," Clapton seemed to throw in unplanned
guitar solos, thus extending the tune into a grooving
number that got the crowd bouncing out of their seats.
His finest performance though was in the final third of
the show. Starting off with a raucous medley of blues
favorites, "I Wonder Who's Loving Her Tonight/Have
You Ever Loved A Woman/Ramblin' On My Mind," Clap
ton seemed to have slipped back into his persona of
rock's first guitar hero. The crowd stared in silence as a
spotlight illuminated Clapton's guitar as it filled the con
fines of the Cow Palace with piercing melodies and fills
ot gorgeous and emotionally uplifting qualities. Then to
satisfy the screams of requests, he went into a final song
set that brought the house down.
Playing three of his most popular and meaningful
songs from the '70s, he graced the crowd with splendid
versions of "Let It Rain," "Cocaine," and finally, "Layla."
What can one say about "Layla" that has not been said.
Seeing it live is seeing history, and I was completly en
raptured in the song's intense and pained aura. I fell in
love with the song all over again.
Finally, a rollicking encore of "Further On Up The
Road" ended an altogether flawless show. One couldn't
complain of any faults or weaknesses. Even the four new
songs off Money and Cigarettes (his latest LP) were de
livered impressively to the crowd's delight. Above all, he
also shared the spotlight with his band. He allowed
numerous musical interchanges with back-up guitarist
Albert Lee and piano-man Chris Stainton. He thoroughly
seemed pleased and ecstatic with his show and it rubbed
off on the audience. He showed that the legend lives on
and he didn't have to play a Cream song to do so.
Clapton is still the finest guitarist alive.

Money and Cigarettes
Eric Clapton
Warner Bros. Records
A couple of days ago, I had quite a weird dream. I
dreamt that I was Eric Clapton's guitar and that Eric had
been playing me ever since he was a Vardbird. As a
"living" guitar, I felt the joy in being able to contribute to
Eric's amazing playing with Cream, Blind Eaith, and
Derek and The Dominos. I especially dreamt of Eric
finding notes and sounds that I thought I was incapable
of making. However, suddenly my dream turned into a
nightmare, as Eric mellowed out. I was now forced in the
'70s to play on "Promises" and "Lay Down Sally," which
did not do much for my ego. I prayed that one day Eric
would return to the bluesy-rollicking music that was his
forte. The rest of my dream was very contusing and
inconsequential as Eric lent me to Pete T o*vnshend and I
was subsequently multilated and demolished on stage.
Well, although the dream was weird, Clapton's new
LP, Money and Ciagarettes, would surely have made his
guitar proud. He finally returns to his blues-rock roots
and comes forth with an album that one had thought
Clapton incapable of recording. Basically, it is a new
approach to rock for Clapton. Instead of trying to reject
his past by playing lackadaisically, on Music and Cigaret
tes, Clapton decides that he can still play fun, sparkling
blues and rock. Instead of wimpy, laid back ballads that
have dominated too much of his '70s output, Clapton
now has changed his outlook enough to finally sound as
if he was sweating during the making of this album.
The change in Clapton's style is extremely vivid and
welcome. Cod knows how long its been since Clapton
played a Chuck Berry guitar riff and let his solos perk up
the listener. The album's songs are so upbeat that they
are even danceable at times. He just seems to be relish
ing in rock and roll in its purest and simplest form.
Instead of extended, distorted guitar extravaganzas
from Cream's heydey (No matter how brilliant they may
have been!) or agonizing, painful runs as on Layla, here
Clapton is just playing rock and roll with the exuberance
of a fledging musician. He reflects this new understand
ing of rock in his lyrics, especially on "I Got A Rock N'
Roll Heart." On this sweet number, Clapton vows his
loyalty to rock and its simplicty — "I get off on '57
Chevys; I get off on a screaming guitar; Like the way it
hits me ... I got a rock n' roll heart."
However, Clapton doesn't just keep to a simple for
mat, although he may be expressing a simple loving


view towards rock and roll. The
majority of the songs are
bluesy-rock numbers or fast
paced rockabilly flavored
tunes. Indeed, on "Man In
Love" and"The Shape You're
In," Clapton shows how in
credible his slide and electric
guitar work could be in a
rockabilly-country rock format
(Stray Cats take notice of this
man!). Clapton seems so in
tent on making this a good, fun
record that he even reminds us
of his past. "Ain't Going
Down" sounds strikingly simi
lar to Hendrix's version of "All
Along the Watchtower" in ad
dition to sporting some of
Clapton's hardest and leanest
fills in ages. And just to show us
that he does realize that he
once was a member of Cream,
on "Crosscut Saw," Clapton
returns to a blues cut reminis
cent of "Crossroads" (of
course, at a more leisurely and
human pace). Not only is this
Clapton's sexiest song (with
such braggado as "I got a gold
plated axe, really cuts good;
Yeah I'm a crosscut saw, let me
bury it in your wood; Yes, I cut
your wood so easy baby, that
you can't help but say 'Hot
Dog' "), but he even dupli
cates the guitar solo from
Cream's classic "Strange
Brew" on it.
The triumph of this album
does not however lie totally

with Clapton alone. The simple
approach to rock with its excit
ing up-tempo pace must
equally lie with the band that
hacks Clapton up. He has em
ployed the finest American
bassist, Donald "Duck" Dunn,
who was an original member of
Booker T and the MC's
("Green Onions") and who
contributed his solid, country
flavored, melodic bass on the
majority of Otis Redding, Wil
son Pickett, and other classic
Stax soul performer's records
in the 19605. On back-up slide
and electric is Ry Cooder, one
of the finest musicians of any
form of basic American rock
roots, and on drums is Roger
Hawkins, former member of
the legendary Muscle Shoals
rhythm section, who has
played behind Bob Seger,
Steve Winwood and Aretha
Franklin.
The influence of these musi
cians in inducing Clapton to
focus his efforts on American
country-blues and rock in the
purist sense cannot be undere
stimated. They all contribute
solidly, thus enabling Clapton
to shine once again. Money
and Cigarettes can stand firmly
on its own. For all of those who
just cannot accept Clapton
without distorted wah-wah or
frenzied runs, either they
should give up and live in the
past, or listen to Clapton as he
is now — "Don't need no glit
ter, no Hollywood; All you got
to do is lay it down and ya lay it
down good!"

is now — "Don't need no glit

to do is lay it down and ya lay it
down good!"
Any performer who has been with us since the '60s has
to face the fact that regardless of the quality of their
present-day performances, the general consensus is
that their every performance was great. The '60s have
seemed to have left behind a magical and mystical legacy
that disallows any real or harsh criticism from the fans. It
is as if a sense of rock history has been instilled into the
audience, thus transforming mediocre performances
into "classic" concerts. This, of course, is a problem as it
works against new bands from gaining touring popular
ity and acceptance.
Above all, it works against a truly great show put on by
an old, yet still vital act. Who really carefully listened to
and dissected the musical quality of the Who's final
shows? The musical quality was based upon the fact that
this was The Who and they just can't be bad. However,
this prevented many from grasping how good they really
were on any musical level that disregarded their Who
legacy. I think the same misfortune has more recently
plagued Eric Clapton at his admirable appearance at the
Cow Palace on February 7.
The main point in seeing Clapton for the majority of
the throng that jammed the Cow Palace was just to say
that they saw one of the few remaining '60s gods. In
seeing Clapton, they were fulfilling their dreams of se
eing Clapton playing the dinky marquee Club with the
Yardbirds or in seeing Cream at the Fillmore East when
people were writing "Clapton Is Cod" on the walls out
side. It was the catching a glimpse of history right before
their eyes, and no matter the true musical worth of the
concert, the fans would still be satisfied. Therefore, this
must affect Clapton deeply in regard to his playing reac
tion (and it has in the past). He knows that if he flubbed a
guitar solo (Heaven forbid for Slowhand!), the crowd
would still scream and cheer hysterically. It was a dead
end course.
Thankfully though, at the Cow Palace, Clapton did
perform flawlessly for those few who came to hear great
blues-rock and not to see Eric Clapton, formerly of
Cream, Blind Faith, Derek and the Dominos, et al.
Ripping into "After Midnight," Clapton led a superb
back-up band (including Donald "Duck" Dunn on bass)
through two hours of the most heartfelt blues-rock I
have ever seen or heard. Uncommonly sporting a smile
throughout the whole show, Clapton was somehow hav
ing fun playing the blues and still making it credible. His
voice was in strong shape and clearer than usual, his
guitar playing was simply awesome. It is one thing to
listen to Clapton on record, but it is a joy to watch him
play.

His guitar fills in between lines and breaths of the song
art' more captivating than most guitarists whole solos. It
is impossible to describe how Clapton can play so many
similar blues songs and yet make each one sound origi
nal, unique, and breathtaking. His version of Derek and
the dominos' "Key To The Highway" was as dexterous
and moving as the original version, and his solo during
tht• slow ballad "Wonderful Tonight" may have been the
sweetest, smoothest thing to emanate from his guitar
that night.
However, Clapton was not only content to play
straight blues copies. He expanded on many songs and
added a few extra surprises as well. "I Shot The Sheriff"
had a much more apparent reggae riffing along with a
more Jamaican pronunciation of the lyrics. Therefore,
rather than a nice pop song, it was transformed into a
desperate, scary plea for escape from the law. Then, on
"Blues Power," Clapton seemed to throw in unplanned
guitar solos, thus extending the tune into a grooving
number that got the crowd bouncing out of their seats.
His finest performance though was in the final third of
the show. Starting off with a raucous medley of blues
favorites, "I Wonder Who's Loving Her Tonight/Have
You Ever Loved A Woman/Ramblin' On My Mind," Clap
ton seemed to have slipped back into his persona of
rock's first guitar hero. The crowd stared in silence as a
spotlight illuminated Clapton's guitar as it filled the con
fines of the Cow Palace with piercing melodies and fills
ot gorgeous and emotionally uplifting qualities. Then to
satisfy the screams of requests, he went into a final song
set that brought the house down.
Playing three of his most popular and meaningful
songs from the '70s, he graced the crowd with splendid
versions of "Let It Rain," "Cocaine," and finally, "Layla."
What can one say about "Layla" that has not been said.
Seeing it live is seeing history, and I was completly en
raptured in the song's intense and pained aura. I fell in
love with the song all over again.
Finally, a rollicking encore of "Further On Up The
Road" ended an altogether flawless show. One couldn't
complain of any faults or weaknesses. Even the four new
songs off Money and Cigarettes (his latest LP) were de
livered impressively to the crowd's delight. Above all, he
also shared the spotlight with his band. He allowed
numerous musical interchanges with back-up guitarist
Albert Lee and piano-man Chris Stainton. He thoroughly
seemed pleased and ecstatic with his show and it rubbed
off on the audience. He showed that the legend lives on
and he didn't have to play a Cream song to do so.
Clapton is still the finest guitarist alive.

Money and Cigarettes
Eric Clapton
Warner Bros. Records
A couple of days ago, I had quite a weird dream. I
dreamt that I was Eric Clapton's guitar and that Eric had
been playing me ever since he was a Vardbird. As a
"living" guitar, I felt the joy in being able to contribute to
Eric's amazing playing with Cream, Blind Eaith, and
Derek and The Dominos. I especially dreamt of Eric
finding notes and sounds that I thought I was incapable
of making. However, suddenly my dream turned into a
nightmare, as Eric mellowed out. I was now forced in the
'70s to play on "Promises" and "Lay Down Sally," which
did not do much for my ego. I prayed that one day Eric
would return to the bluesy-rollicking music that was his
forte. The rest of my dream was very contusing and
inconsequential as Eric lent me to Pete T o*vnshend and I
was subsequently multilated and demolished on stage.
Well, although the dream was weird, Clapton's new
LP, Money and Ciagarettes, would surely have made his
guitar proud. He finally returns to his blues-rock roots
and comes forth with an album that one had thought
Clapton incapable of recording. Basically, it is a new
approach to rock for Clapton. Instead of trying to reject
his past by playing lackadaisically, on Music and Cigaret
tes, Clapton decides that he can still play fun, sparkling
blues and rock. Instead of wimpy, laid back ballads that
have dominated too much of his '70s output, Clapton
now has changed his outlook enough to finally sound as
if he was sweating during the making of this album.
The change in Clapton's style is extremely vivid and
welcome. Cod knows how long its been since Clapton
played a Chuck Berry guitar riff and let his solos perk up
the listener. The album's songs are so upbeat that they
are even danceable at times. He just seems to be relish
ing in rock and roll in its purest and simplest form.
Instead of extended, distorted guitar extravaganzas
from Cream's heydey (No matter how brilliant they may
have been!) or agonizing, painful runs as on Layla, here
Clapton is just playing rock and roll with the exuberance
of a fledging musician. He reflects this new understand
ing of rock in his lyrics, especially on "I Got A Rock N'
Roll Heart." On this sweet number, Clapton vows his
loyalty to rock and its simplicty — "I get off on '57
Chevys; I get off on a screaming guitar; Like the way it
hits me ... I got a rock n' roll heart."
However, Clapton doesn't just keep to a simple for
mat, although he may be expressing a simple loving


view towards rock and roll. The
majority of the songs are
bluesy-rock numbers or fast
paced rockabilly flavored
tunes. Indeed, on "Man In
Love" and"The Shape You're
In," Clapton shows how in
credible his slide and electric
guitar work could be in a
rockabilly-country rock format
(Stray Cats take notice of this
man!). Clapton seems so in
tent on making this a good, fun
record that he even reminds us
of his past. "Ain't Going
Down" sounds strikingly simi
lar to Hendrix's version of "All
Along the Watchtower" in ad
dition to sporting some of
Clapton's hardest and leanest
fills in ages. And just to show us
that he does realize that he
once was a member of Cream,
on "Crosscut Saw," Clapton
returns to a blues cut reminis
cent of "Crossroads" (of
course, at a more leisurely and
human pace). Not only is this
Clapton's sexiest song (with
such braggado as "I got a gold
plated axe, really cuts good;
Yeah I'm a crosscut saw, let me
bury it in your wood; Yes, I cut
your wood so easy baby, that
you can't help but say 'Hot
Dog' "), but he even dupli
cates the guitar solo from
Cream's classic "Strange
Brew" on it.
The triumph of this album
does not however lie totally

with Clapton alone. The simple
approach to rock with its excit
ing up-tempo pace must
equally lie with the band that
hacks Clapton up. He has em
ployed the finest American
bassist, Donald "Duck" Dunn,
who was an original member of
Booker T and the MC's
("Green Onions") and who
contributed his solid, country
flavored, melodic bass on the
majority of Otis Redding, Wil
son Pickett, and other classic
Stax soul performer's records
in the 19605. On back-up slide
and electric is Ry Cooder, one
of the finest musicians of any
form of basic American rock
roots, and on drums is Roger
Hawkins, former member of
the legendary Muscle Shoals
rhythm section, who has
played behind Bob Seger,
Steve Winwood and Aretha
Franklin.
The influence of these musi
cians in inducing Clapton to
focus his efforts on American
country-blues and rock in the
purist sense cannot be undere
stimated. They all contribute
solidly, thus enabling Clapton
to shine once again. Money
and Cigarettes can stand firmly
on its own. For all of those who
just cannot accept Clapton
without distorted wah-wah or
frenzied runs, either they
should give up and live in the
past, or listen to Clapton as he
is now — "Don't need no glit
ter, no Hollywood; All you got
to do is lay it down and ya lay it
down good!"

frenzied runs, either they
should give up and live in the
past, or listen to Clapton as he
is now — "Don't need no glit
ter, no Hollywood; All you got
to do is lay it down and ya lay it
down good!"
Any performer who has been with us since the '60s has
to face the fact that regardless of the quality of their
present-day performances, the general consensus is
that their every performance was great. The '60s have
seemed to have left behind a magical and mystical legacy
that disallows any real or harsh criticism from the fans. It
is as if a sense of rock history has been instilled into the
audience, thus transforming mediocre performances
into "classic" concerts. This, of course, is a problem as it
works against new bands from gaining touring popular
ity and acceptance.
Above all, it works against a truly great show put on by
an old, yet still vital act. Who really carefully listened to
and dissected the musical quality of the Who's final
shows? The musical quality was based upon the fact that
this was The Who and they just can't be bad. However,
this prevented many from grasping how good they really
were on any musical level that disregarded their Who
legacy. I think the same misfortune has more recently
plagued Eric Clapton at his admirable appearance at the
Cow Palace on February 7.
The main point in seeing Clapton for the majority of
the throng that jammed the Cow Palace was just to say
that they saw one of the few remaining '60s gods. In
seeing Clapton, they were fulfilling their dreams of se
eing Clapton playing the dinky marquee Club with the
Yardbirds or in seeing Cream at the Fillmore East when
people were writing "Clapton Is Cod" on the walls out
side. It was the catching a glimpse of history right before
their eyes, and no matter the true musical worth of the
concert, the fans would still be satisfied. Therefore, this
must affect Clapton deeply in regard to his playing reac
tion (and it has in the past). He knows that if he flubbed a
guitar solo (Heaven forbid for Slowhand!), the crowd
would still scream and cheer hysterically. It was a dead
end course.
Thankfully though, at the Cow Palace, Clapton did
perform flawlessly for those few who came to hear great
blues-rock and not to see Eric Clapton, formerly of
Cream, Blind Faith, Derek and the Dominos, et al.
Ripping into "After Midnight," Clapton led a superb
back-up band (including Donald "Duck" Dunn on bass)
through two hours of the most heartfelt blues-rock I
have ever seen or heard. Uncommonly sporting a smile
throughout the whole show, Clapton was somehow hav
ing fun playing the blues and still making it credible. His
voice was in strong shape and clearer than usual, his
guitar playing was simply awesome. It is one thing to
listen to Clapton on record, but it is a joy to watch him
play.

His guitar fills in between lines and breaths of the song
art' more captivating than most guitarists whole solos. It
is impossible to describe how Clapton can play so many
similar blues songs and yet make each one sound origi
nal, unique, and breathtaking. His version of Derek and
the dominos' "Key To The Highway" was as dexterous
and moving as the original version, and his solo during
tht• slow ballad "Wonderful Tonight" may have been the
sweetest, smoothest thing to emanate from his guitar
that night.
However, Clapton was not only content to play
straight blues copies. He expanded on many songs and
added a few extra surprises as well. "I Shot The Sheriff"
had a much more apparent reggae riffing along with a
more Jamaican pronunciation of the lyrics. Therefore,
rather than a nice pop song, it was transformed into a
desperate, scary plea for escape from the law. Then, on
"Blues Power," Clapton seemed to throw in unplanned
guitar solos, thus extending the tune into a grooving
number that got the crowd bouncing out of their seats.
His finest performance though was in the final third of
the show. Starting off with a raucous medley of blues
favorites, "I Wonder Who's Loving Her Tonight/Have
You Ever Loved A Woman/Ramblin' On My Mind," Clap
ton seemed to have slipped back into his persona of
rock's first guitar hero. The crowd stared in silence as a
spotlight illuminated Clapton's guitar as it filled the con
fines of the Cow Palace with piercing melodies and fills
ot gorgeous and emotionally uplifting qualities. Then to
satisfy the screams of requests, he went into a final song
set that brought the house down.
Playing three of his most popular and meaningful
songs from the '70s, he graced the crowd with splendid
versions of "Let It Rain," "Cocaine," and finally, "Layla."
What can one say about "Layla" that has not been said.
Seeing it live is seeing history, and I was completly en
raptured in the song's intense and pained aura. I fell in
love with the song all over again.
Finally, a rollicking encore of "Further On Up The
Road" ended an altogether flawless show. One couldn't
complain of any faults or weaknesses. Even the four new
songs off Money and Cigarettes (his latest LP) were de
livered impressively to the crowd's delight. Above all, he
also shared the spotlight with his band. He allowed
numerous musical interchanges with back-up guitarist
Albert Lee and piano-man Chris Stainton. He thoroughly
seemed pleased and ecstatic with his show and it rubbed
off on the audience. He showed that the legend lives on
and he didn't have to play a Cream song to do so.
Clapton is still the finest guitarist alive.

Eric Clapton

A couple of days ago, I had quite a weird dream. I
dreamt that I was Eric Clapton's guitar and that Eric had
been playing me ever since he was a Vardbird. As a
"living" guitar, I felt the joy in being able to contribute to
Eric's amazing playing with Cream, Blind Eaith, and
Derek and The Dominos. I especially dreamt of Eric
finding notes and sounds that I thought I was incapable
of making. However, suddenly my dream turned into a
nightmare, as Eric mellowed out. I was now forced in the
'70s to play on "Promises" and "Lay Down Sally," which
did not do much for my ego. I prayed that one day Eric
would return to the bluesy-rollicking music that was his
forte. The rest of my dream was very contusing and
inconsequential as Eric lent me to Pete T o*vnshend and I
was subsequently multilated and demolished on stage.
Well, although the dream was weird, Clapton's new
LP, Money and Ciagarettes, would surely have made his
guitar proud. He finally returns to his blues-rock roots
and comes forth with an album that one had thought
Clapton incapable of recording. Basically, it is a new
approach to rock for Clapton. Instead of trying to reject
his past by playing lackadaisically, on Music and Cigaret
tes, Clapton decides that he can still play fun, sparkling
blues and rock. Instead of wimpy, laid back ballads that
have dominated too much of his '70s output, Clapton
now has changed his outlook enough to finally sound as
if he was sweating during the making of this album.
The change in Clapton's style is extremely vivid and
welcome. Cod knows how long its been since Clapton
played a Chuck Berry guitar riff and let his solos perk up
the listener. The album's songs are so upbeat that they
are even danceable at times. He just seems to be relish
ing in rock and roll in its purest and simplest form.
Instead of extended, distorted guitar extravaganzas
from Cream's heydey (No matter how brilliant they may
have been!) or agonizing, painful runs as on Layla, here
Clapton is just playing rock and roll with the exuberance
of a fledging musician. He reflects this new understand
ing of rock in his lyrics, especially on "I Got A Rock N'
Roll Heart." On this sweet number, Clapton vows his
loyalty to rock and its simplicty — "I get off on '57
Chevys; I get off on a screaming guitar; Like the way it
hits me ... I got a rock n' roll heart."
However, Clapton doesn't just keep to a simple for
mat, although he may be expressing a simple loving


view towards rock and roll. The
majority of the songs are
bluesy-rock numbers or fast
paced rockabilly flavored
tunes. Indeed, on "Man In
Love" and"The Shape You're
In," Clapton shows how in
credible his slide and electric
guitar work could be in a
rockabilly-country rock format
(Stray Cats take notice of this
man!). Clapton seems so in
tent on making this a good, fun
record that he even reminds us
of his past. "Ain't Going
Down" sounds strikingly simi
lar to Hendrix's version of "All
Along the Watchtower" in ad
dition to sporting some of
Clapton's hardest and leanest
fills in ages. And just to show us
that he does realize that he
once was a member of Cream,
on "Crosscut Saw," Clapton
returns to a blues cut reminis
cent of "Crossroads" (of
course, at a more leisurely and
human pace). Not only is this
Clapton's sexiest song (with
such braggado as "I got a gold
plated axe, really cuts good;
Yeah I'm a crosscut saw, let me
bury it in your wood; Yes, I cut
your wood so easy baby, that
you can't help but say 'Hot
Dog' "), but he even dupli
cates the guitar solo from
Cream's classic "Strange
Brew" on it.
The triumph of this album
does not however lie totally

with Clapton alone. The simple
approach to rock with its excit
ing up-tempo pace must
equally lie with the band that
hacks Clapton up. He has em
ployed the finest American
bassist, Donald "Duck" Dunn,
who was an original member of
Booker T and the MC's
("Green Onions") and who
contributed his solid, country
flavored, melodic bass on the
majority of Otis Redding, Wil
son Pickett, and other classic
Stax soul performer's records
in the 19605. On back-up slide
and electric is Ry Cooder, one
of the finest musicians of any
form of basic American rock
roots, and on drums is Roger
Hawkins, former member of
the legendary Muscle Shoals
rhythm section, who has
played behind Bob Seger,
Steve Winwood and Aretha
Franklin.
The influence of these musi
cians in inducing Clapton to
focus his efforts on American
country-blues and rock in the
purist sense cannot be undere
stimated. They all contribute
solidly, thus enabling Clapton
to shine once again. Money
and Cigarettes can stand firmly
on its own. For all of those who
just cannot accept Clapton
without distorted wah-wah or
frenzied runs, either they
should give up and live in the
past, or listen to Clapton as he
is now — "Don't need no glit
ter, no Hollywood; All you got
to do is lay it down and ya lay it
