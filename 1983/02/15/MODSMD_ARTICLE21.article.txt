Program notes don't rank high on
my list of helpful methods to express
the import of a dance. Despite good
intentions, they can interfere with
an audience's natural response, be
gratuitous or provide needless
complication. That was the only
quarrel I had with the otherwise
substantial and well-balanced pro
gram in the latest series of perform
ances by the San Francisco Ballet at
the War Memorial Opera House.
Choreographer Jiri Kylian's defini
tion of "Forgotten Land," currently
undergoing its San Francisco pre
miere, was perplexing indeed, es
pecially as the choreographic and
atmospheric elements bore little re
lation to the tremendous scope he
implies in his notes: " Forgotten
Land' shows the juxtapositions and
the polarities in every human situa
tion."
Kylian's image of "the blood of life
itself and the continuous resurrec
tion" was, however radiantly trans
lated into movement — and thus
should not have required printed
explanation. The relentless, con
tinuous motion, the use of momen
tum and occasional andante pas

sages all in an enduring legato
mode, conjured a visual impression
of the rhythm and inexhaustibility of
the sea. This was further echoed in
the muted ocean and dune scene
design. The ongoing thrust of the
work promises a moment of fulfill
ment, but it never quite culminates.
This, depending on taste, is or is not
a depriving scheme.
I found the dancing by the six
couples potentially fluid and excep-

deal to Benjamin Britten's "Sinfonia
da Requiem," not only for its inspira
tion but for the persuasive «ense of
landscape it evokes.

Pianist Roy Bogas played a variety of
selections ranging from a tango to

inventions drawing upon folkloric
motifs and enjoyed a very casual,
familial rapport with the dancers,
some of whom lingered by the piano
to watch, be entertained, or even
collaborate with Bogas on his in
strument.
Of particular joy was the "Polka,"
a disarming duet between Paul Rus
sell and child-partner Erika Johnson
that combined struts with spirited
classroom technique. "Serenata"

was a humorous and highly original
"pas de sept'' in which Betsy Erikson
is at one point trundled along by six
men who roll beneath her as a legion
of logs. "Ragtime," a tap episode of
lively punctuations, was performed
with charismatic exuberance by Eve
lyn Cisneros and Kirk Peterson.
Val Caniparoli's "Chansons de
Sheherezade," in its premiere, was

more of a treat for the ear than the
eyes. Soprano Francesca Howe, who
mingled onstage with the dancers,
and conductor lean-Louis Leßoux
interpreted the Raval score with sen
sitivity. The angular, modernistic
faces that were projected onto the
back screen cooly oversaw the
emotionally-fraught and muscular
relationship among the three "Ara
bian" dancers. What link the
choreographer had in mind be
tween Howe and her stage
mates remained unclear. What ihey
did share amounted to little more
than exotic plumage.
George Balanchine's rousing and
colorful "Western Symphony"
(1954) is easy to like and thus a prac
tical closing piece in a mixed pro
gram. The ensemble of cowboys and
saloon girls met the characteristic
Balanchine demands of speed, agility
and precision with energy and ease.
Conspicuously notable was Kirk
Peterson, who complemented his
technical proficiency with charm
and waggery. Though perhaps facile
in subject, the piece reflects the
mythology we've created around the
old American West and represents
an idealistic nostalgia all of us share.
