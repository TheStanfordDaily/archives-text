# The 						many faces of 'Woolgatherer'

One of the things that sets
live theater apart from movies
and television is the fact that
each performance, responding
to an individual audience, is a
separate and unique piece of
art. It is always a fascinating ex
perience to watch the same
production transformed on
successive nights by the in
teraction between the actors
and different sets of viewers.
Theatre Works has added a
new twist to this phenomenon
in its current production, the
northern California premiere
of William Mastrosimone's
"The Woolgatherer."
In staging the play with two
different sets of actors, di
rector Robert Kelley has ex
plored the script more deeply
than is usually possible with a
single cast, and in encouraging
reviewers to view both produc
tions, he has given us an op
portunity to witness the range
of possibilities he has encoun
tered.
Mastrosirnone, author of the
current Broadway hit, "Ex
tremities," has presented us
with an intriguing pair of
"cooped-up loonies," a more
than-slightly crazy woman who
works at a five-and-dime in
Philadelphia, and a truck driver
who spends time with her wait
ing for his rig to be repaired.
The play itself has several prob
lems.
Both characters are a bit too
poetic in places and lose some
credibility as working class in
dividuals. Cliff, the truck
driver, is particularly prone to
fancy phrases which belie his
description of himself as "the
fastest one in the slow group."
in addition to its verbal exces

ses, the play's ultimate mes
sage is unclear. As the title im
plies, the author is very con
cerned with dreaming. At one
point, the girl Rose, after hav
ing her vision of a rabbit farm
ridiculed, says,"I can dream,
can't I?" Cliff responds that
"you can and you can't." If you
do, it eventually catches up
with you and makes you hate
the way things really are.
Whether you are supposed to
take this view at face value, or
to believe that dreams have a
power to overcome the prob
lems of everyday existence is
never really resolved by the
playwright, and in fact, the two
versions of the play seem to
come to different answers.
Let me preface my compari
son of the two different casts
by saying that each rendition of
the play is well performed and
deeply moving. Either is well
worth your time to see, and see
ing both would be an espe
cially rewarding experience.
The opening night cast, Henry
Woessner and Ginger Drake,
were better in bringing the
poetry out of the characters.
In a long first act speech de
riding the experiences of a
trucker, Woessner was excel
lent in presenting the vivid im
ages of the road. While the
language was a bit lofty for a
trucker, it served beautifully as
poetry, and was reminiscent of
Carl Sandburg in its powerful
use of metaphor.
Drake was equally good in
her recounting of the destruc
tion of some rare birds at the
zoo. She displayed a fnghten
ing intensity throughout, and
was especially good during her
moments of insanity in the
second act. Ferhaps because of

the careful useof the language,
the first act dragged a bit on
opening night, but this was
more than atoned for in the
powerful and disturbing con
clusion.
The cast on the second
night, Steven Young and Nina
DuVal was very different.
DuVal appeared to be ten or
fifteen years younger than

Drake on stage. She was not as
capable in general with the
language and seemed more
clearly disturbed (as opposed
to merely neurotic) from the
beginning. The result of all this
was to make her a much more
fragiie character th.-n the Rose
of the night before.
Young, on the other hand,
was less sensitive than Woess
ner had been. He captured the

'trucker' in the character a little
better, and managed to make

the poetry sound more like his
own speech. Lines which had

gotten laughs the night before,
had the audiences rolling
under his careful delivery.
The result of the changes in
the performers was that the
ending of the show was much
more hopeful the second time
around. The fact that the girl
was still young, combined with
the trucker who was more
down-to-earth, made you be
lieve that she would come out
of it all right. That was not the
case on opening night.
In general, both shows are
funny and moving. Though
DuVal in the second cast is
clearly the weakest of the four
performers, Young is probably
the strongest, and in any case
that is comparing apples and
oranges. These are really two
very different shows "The
Woolgather" will be per
formed at the Burgess Theater
in Menlo Park for the next two
weeks; Woessner and Drake
appear on February 17, 19, 24
and 26; DuVal and Young on
February 18, 20, 23, 25 and 27.
The fact that these are sepa
rate productions, each worthy
of attention, is a tribute to di
rector Kelley, who does his
finest work of the past year,
and gives some indication of
why live theater survives ad
mist the polished plastic per
fection of television and the
movies.
