Come for comp
If you've been looking around at
all the Daily staffers using the com
puter terminals and wish that you too
could move paragraphs all over the
place, tomorrow's your chance to
learn. Following in the Tuesday tradi
tion, hacker Heather will be on hand
at 2:15 p.m. today for terminal train
ing. She promises she'll be happy.

Night and day
You might think we're advertising
a loe jac kson album, but actually, we
need a night editor for tomorrow.
Some of you out there haven't done
it for awhile, so cali the Daily today
and sav, "I'd love to night edit tomor
row!"
