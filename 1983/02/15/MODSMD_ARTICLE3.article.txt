# Budget cuts necessary to keep overhead rate low
## 
### Second in a three-part series By DOUGLAS JEHL Senior staff writer 
Today, the University's indirect cost re
covery dilemma is a dilemma half-solved.
What has been decided — though not yet
officially approved — is to continue charging
a 69 percent overhead recovery rate to fed
eral sponsors of research. This is a level far
too low to recover projected overhead
costs, but is considered imperative to pro
tect research programs here.
What remains unclear is how — and
whether — this can be achieved without sac
rificing millions of dollars.
To keep the rate low, University officials
have proposed a combination of roughly $10
million in budget cuts focused on indirect
costs and changes in accounting procedures
that will stretch out the recovery process.
They agree that such a program, which
would affect administration and support
services most drastically, would have a tre
mendous impact on the University. "To
make significant cuts will result in a change
in the style of living that we've had here at
Stanford," said Gerald Lieberman, vice pro
vost and dean of graduate studies and re
search.

But, as of yet, no one is ready to say exactly
how much cutting is necessary or where cuts
will be made. And none will say conclusively
whether such cuts can be made at all. If they
can't, the University will be forced to back
away from its policy of full recovery and
forgo federal research monies to which it is
entitled.

It is still too early in the process to make
such predictions, according to Ray Bac
chetti, vice provost for management and di
rector of University budgets. First, he said,
"We need to develop an understanding of
where are those things that have an effect on
the rate and come up with an understanding
of how they can be cut."

Bacchetti said the 69 percent cosi recovery
rate is already built in to a balanced, slow
growth 1983-84 budget, expected to be ap
proved by the board of trustees next month.
At that rate, he said, there will be a huge gap
between what the University spends and
what it recovers from the government By
itself, this under recoveVy presents no im
mediate problem, for the difference is "car
ried forward" and eventually paid by the
federal government through increased rates
in future years.
But those increased rate 1 are precisely
what the University hopes to avoid. In the
past two years, under recovery has totaled
nearly $18 million, and is one of the signifi
cant forces pushing Stanford's overhead re
covery rate skyward.
This rate is determined through calcula
tions made from the various indirect cost
pools — the total amount of money spent in
various overhead areas including deprecia
tion, maintenance and administration. The
larger the total ot these cost pools, the
higher the indirect rate. Projected costs for
next year exceed by $11 million the amount
necessary to keep the rate at 69 percent.
That total could not be made up in budget
cuts alone, administrators say, but the

difference might be narrowed with the
combination of budget cuts and delayed re
covery. That would mean redefining, but not
abandoning, the long-time policy of full re
covery.
The investigation into possible budget
cuts will be made this spring. "We try to
handle this deliberately and thoughtfully so
that it's not a few wild people going around
the place with machetes and hatchets," Bac
chetti said.
Provost Albert Hastorf said Assoc. Con
troller Frank Riddle and others would inves
tigate the accounting changes while an
administration/faculty committee would
likely be formed to look into proposed
budget cuts.
The accounting changes would involve
capitalizing — spreading out — recovery for
costs that are ordinarily claimed for a single
year — "expensed." What this might mean,
according to Riddle, is that the recovery
costs tor a replacement roof on a building
would be capitalized rather than expensed,
as conventional accounting procedures
would dictate.
Another possible change, Bacchetti said,
would be working with the federal govern
ment to spread out the recovery schedule

for carry-forward. "We're seeking to recover
money over a longer period of time."
The budget cuts would not be as drastic as
those made under two major belt-tightening
programs 10 years ago, Bacchetti said. But
the expected cuts, unlike the ones in the
past, would be focused particularly on areas
having the most direct effect on the indirect
rate.
Because some of these areas, particularly
energy costs, are viewed as more likely to
increase than decrease, others will feel the
brunt of the budget cuts. Possible victims
could include administrative and
administrative-support jobs, maintenance
and cleaning of buildings and some student
and library services.
Hastorf, the highest ranking academic of
ficer in the University, agreed with Lieber
man that such cuts would change the quality
of life. But, Hastorf said, "I have a feeling
that we can alter the quality of life and riot
impact the quality of intellectual life. ... I
have a feeling that you can do first-class re
search and teaching without wall-to-wall
carpets all the time."
"it's good for an institution to lose a little
weight," he said.

According to Bacchetti, it won't be
until late next fall that rhe University
will be able to evaluate the effects of
the budget cuts and delayed re
covery. At that time, lie said, ad
ministrators will be better abk to see
whether the gap between the
amount spent and the amount re
covered Is stabilizing or is continuing
to grow.
"The board (of trustees) and we
are very concerned lest we appear to
pursue a policy that settles for less

than full recovery," University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy said He and
others are wary because to do so
would mean forgoing the recovery of
millions of dollars in federal monies.
But if the gap continues to in
crease, the University would likely
decide sometime late next fall to
forgo at least the carry-forward from
1980-81 and 1981-82 - which totals
nearly $18 million — in the hope of
recovering the equally substantial
under recovery from litis year and
next. Conceded Hastorf: "The stager
is set tor some -«ort of one-time act of
forgoing."
