# Univ. considers computers
## Libraries may be linked 
### JASON COLE Staff writer 
The University Library Council is
studyirfg the possibility of connect
ing all University library catalogs
under one main computer system.
Library officials hope the proposal
will be implemented by next fall,
making all library materials directly
accessible to faculty, staff and stu
dents.
A group was appointed last De
cember to prepare a proposal for a
computer system, according to
James Myers, associate director of
technical services for University li
braries and convener of the group.
The group is comprised of members
of the Center for Information
Technology (CIT) and the Research
Library Croup (RLC).
CIT formulated a techical plan and
gave it to RLC so that they could de
termine the feasibility of turning over

all the needed files and information
so that the data base rould be
created, Myers said.
Interest in the idea is especially
high now, but as Myers indicated,
"This plan has been in the works
since 1%8. The libraries have been
wanting to do this as soon as we had
the system to do it."
The group is also studying the cost
of the proposal, to determine if it will
be greater than the savings to librar
ies from the elimination of present
cataloguing methods. Meyers said,
for example, that updating the
microfiche and card catalog systems
costs $90,000 per year.
John Sack, director of data base
management for (JIT, is now in
charge of studying the costs of the
proposal. He indicated that the most
costly portion will be the charges for
time on the computer system.
