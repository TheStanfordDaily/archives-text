Arens replaces Sharon
Jerusalem — Moshe Arens, Israel's am
bassador to the United States, agreed yesterday
to accept the post of defense minister, replac
ing Ariel Sharon, who formally gave up the post
he has held since 1981 in a tearful ceremony at

Arens accepted the defense post, the second

Arens, who was born in Lithuania, emigrated
to the United States at the age of 14 and moved
to Israel in the 1950s He trained as an aero
nautical engineer at the California Institute of
Technology and the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology and later designed aircraft and mis

siles in Israel.

Meanwhile, state Controller Ken Cory said he
