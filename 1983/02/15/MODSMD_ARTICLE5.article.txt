Arens replaces Sharon
Jerusalem — Moshe Arens, Israel's am
bassador to the United States, agreed yesterday
to accept the post of defense minister, replac
ing Ariel Sharon, who formally gave up the post
he has held since 1981 in a tearful ceremony at
the ministry yesterday morning.
Last night, a subdued Knesset (parliament)
approved Prime Minister Menachem Begin's
plan to retain Sharon in the Cabinet despite the
severe criticism leveled at him by the com
mission that investigated the Beirut massacre
Arens accepted the defense post, the second
most powerful job in the Israeli government, in
a telephone call to Begin yesterday. Officials

said he is expected to arrive in Israel late this
week or early next week for several days of talks
about his new duties. He will then return to
Washington to conclude his affairs there before
assuming the defense job.
The replacement of Sharon by Arens is not
expected to change Israeli policy. The 57-year
old Arens is as hawkish as his predecessor or Be
gin, particularly on the key issue of the futureof
the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
Arens, who was born in Lithuania, emigrated
to the United States at the age of 14 and moved
to Israel in the 1950s He trained as an aero
nautical engineer at the California Institute of
Technology and the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology and later designed aircraft and mis

siles in Israel.
Calif, deficit woes unresolved
Sacramento — A shaky agreement between
Gov. Deukmejian and Senate Democrats on
how to erase California's $1.5 billion budget
deficit dissolved yesterday as the state moved a
major step closer to issuing IOUs.
The Republican governor met for nearly
three hours with legislative leaders of both
parties, but they were unable to resolve the
complex disputes that emerged after the ten
tative agreement was revealed last Thursday
Meanwhile, state Controller Ken Cory said he
would start printing the IOUs — officially called
"registered warrants" — on Thursday for pos
sible use starting Feb. 23, saying it would take
something "very dramatic" to avoid them.
"There is still a very large gap between parties
as to what isanappropriateexpenditure level in
(the next fiscal year)," Assembly Republican
leader Robert Naylor (R-Menlo Park) said after
the session.
He said he was not optimistic that an agree
ment would be reached soon, but predicted the
state would somehow find a way to avoid use of
registered warrants starting next week to cover
its obligations, including income tax refunds.
Naylor, Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-
San Francisco), Senate President Pro Tem David
Roberti (D-Los Angeles), and Senate Re
publican leader William Campbell (R-Hacienda
Heights), said they would meet with Deu
kmejian again today in an effort to resolve the
split, which centers on whether there should be
a tax increase to help eliminate the deficit.
The budget dispute centers on whether $900
million of the deficit that would remain after a
series of budget cuts, fund transfers and tax col
lection speedups should be liquidated through
a tax increase or spending cuts, whether a spe
cific level of spending next year should be pro
tected and whether next year's budget should
have a reserve for emergencies.
Palestinians hold conference
Algiers, Algeria — The Palestine National
Council convened yesterday with Yasser Arafat
firmly in control despite a challenge to his lead
ership and with most delegates clearly more in
terested in finding peace than in waging war.
Western political analysts do not expect the
360-member council — equivalent to a
Palestine Liberation Organization parliament
in-exile — to make any dramatic policy shiftsor
undertake new initiativesduringtheweek-long
meeting, but the tone and substance of its rec
ommendations will be closely watched.
The convention is the Palestinians' first since
the PLO was defeated by Israel in Lebanon last
summer. It comes at a crucial period, with time
apparently running out on President Reagan s
Middle East peace proposal and with Arafat ma
neuvering to hold together the disparate fac
tions of his organization.
In 15 previous congresses dating back to 1964,
the council — which has the reputation of oper
ating far more democratically than any govern
ment in the Arab world — has usually followed
the course charted bv its executive committee.
That 15-member group ended its pre-con
vention deliberations yesterday and con
ference sources said its tone was moderate and
distinctly non-belligerent and that it gave
Arafat, the PLO chairman, a mandate to con
tinue exploratory talks with King Hussein of Jor
dan that could lead to negotiations with Israel.
Predictably, the executive committee said
Reagan's proposal for self-government for the
Palestinians of the West Bank and Gaza Strip in
association with Jordan was insufficient be
cause it falls short of full Palestinian independ
ence. The plan, though, was not rejected out of
hand, which representsan important victoryfor
Arafat, who has said it contains "positive ele
ments."
Committee members were said to believe
that the so-called Fez plan, sponsored by the
Arab nations, represents the "acceptable min
imum" the Palestinians will settle for. That plan
calls for an independent Palestine, recognition
of the PLO as the sole representative of the
world's 4.5 million Palestinians and, according
to one interpretation, the implied recognition
of Israel.

Israel has rejected both the Reagan and Fez
plans and insists that the Camp David accords
are the only avenue toward peace in the Middle
East.
India reprocesses nuclear fuel
New Delhi, India — India has reportedly
begun reprocessing spent nuclear fuel in signif
icant quantities, a move that brings the country
a step closer to total self-sufficiency in atomic
energy.
The development, reported in the current is
sue of the American technical newsletter Nu
clear Fuel, was confirmed yesterday by officials
at the Bhabha Atomic Research Center in Bom
bay, the country's premier research estab
lishment.
The director of the center, Raja Ramanna,
told the newsletter that reprocessing began
about two months ago at the Tarapur plant,
north of Bombay.
The spent fuel comes from the Rajasthan (I)
220 megawatt reactor, one of India's four oper
ating nuclear power plants.
Because the Rajasthan reactor uses Soviet
supplied heavy water, reprocessing of its fuel is
subject to strict international inspection and
safeguards.
The International Atomic Energy Agency, the
Vienna-based agency that monitors interna
tionally agreed safeguards, was reportedly
notified before reprocessing began and lAEA
inspectors were present at Tarapur, according
to the newsletter
Ramanna was unavailable for comment yes
terday, but an aide confirmed the substance of
the newsletter's report.
It was not clear from the technical article how
much fuel was being reprocessed at Tarapur,
but the aide indicated that the amount was sub
stantial.
"It is not a small trial, it is a full-scale opera
tion," he said.
The Tarapur plant has a rated capacity of 100
tons per year, small by world standards, yet
large enough to support a weapons program
should India decide to violate international
safeguards.
Western nuclear scientists have estimated
tnai reprocessed fuel from trie Rajadasian reac
tor could yield more than 100 kilograms of
weapon-rated plutonium annually, roughly
enough for 10 Hiroshima-sized bombs.
However, those familiar with India's nuclear
program believe the reprocessed fuel would
most likely be channeled into the country's
fledgling fast breeder project.
Judge bars parental notice
A federal judge in New York yesterday barred
the government from putting into effect a rule
that would require family-planning clinics to
notify parents when their children have re
ceived contraceptives.
Judge Henry Werker granted a preliminary
injunction against the rule, saying it would lead
to an increase in teen-age pregnancy.
"The parental notice requirement is invalid
because it contradicts and subverts the intent of
Congress," Werker said in his ruling. "The court
finds that the regulations constitute a blatant
disregard for one of the main purposes" of the
family-planning law as passed by Congress.
Health and Human Services Department of
ficials had no comment yesterday, but the
American Civil Liberties Union, which brought
suit on behalf of the state of New York and the
New York health department, said the ruling
probably will block implementation of the reg
ulation nationally.
The rule requiring notification of parents was
scheduled to go into effect Feb. 25. It would

have required some 5000 family-planning
clinics that receive federal funds to mail a notice
to parents within 10 days of prescribing a con
traceptive to anyone 17 years old or younger.
The three contraceptives included in the rule
are the pill, the diaphragm and the intrauterine
device.
The notification rule has been opposed by
numerous health and civil liberties groups. It
has generated more mail than any other pro
posed regulation in the department's history.
Reagan administration supporters, however
say parents have a right to know what their chil
dren are doing, and thegovernmentshould not
be providing contraceptives to children
without the parents' knowledge.
Werkersaid in 20-page opinion that it was un
necessary to consider deep constitutional ques
tions on the matter, since the law itself and the
documents surrounding it made it clear the
Congress never intended to make parental
notification mandatory.
He also called one HHS argument "fatuous"
and another "nothing more than an exercise in
mere sophistry" when the agency claimed that
it was not mandating family participation in
contraception with this rule, but only facil
itating it.
Glenn speaks to Jewish group
Cleveland — Sen. John Glenn (D-Ohio)
sought yesterday to reassure supporters of Is
rael that he "will never waver" in his backing of
the Jewish state.
In a luncheon speech to the National Jewish
Community Relations Council, Glenn tried to
lay to rest suggestions "that my commitment to
Israel is somehow suspect" or that he is "no
friend" of Israel.
Glenn canceled a scheduled trip to Germany
in order to use this forum to confront a political
problem that his aides readily acknowledged as
a threat to his undeclared candidacy tor the
1984 Democratic presidential nomination.
Recent newspaper and magazine articles
publicizing statements he has made, urging thai
the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) be
brought into the Mideast negotiations, have
been given .vide circulation in the Jewish com
munity by fund-raisers for other Democratic
hopefuls, Glenn's press secretary, Greg
Schneiders, said.
Yesterday, Glenn said, "I regret that past
statements I have made on this subject have
caused misunderstanding," and vowed to op
pose exclusive negotiations between the Unit
ed States and the PLO.
Dow Jones hits record high
The Dow Jones industrial average climbed to
a recoid closing high yesterday as hopes for a
continuing recovery from the recession kept
stock prices moving ahead

That surpassed its previous closing peak of
1092.35, reached on Jan. 10.
Since last Aug. 12, the average has risen
almost 320 points in a bull market sparked by
anticipation of the economic recovery which
most economists believe is now beginning.
