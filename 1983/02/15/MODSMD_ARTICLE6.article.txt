# Replacement scheduled for suites' fire alarms

### KATHY OLMSTED Senior staff writer 
Overly sensitive smoke detectors
in the Governor's Corner suites
which have apparently caused fre
quent false alarms there, will be re
placed beginning tomorrow.
More than 30 alarms have gone off
in Governor's Corner so far this quar
ter, as opposed to only 17 for all of
autumn quarter, according to ]an
Van Houten, director of Governor's
Corner.
Glenn Carroll, manager of the
Governor's Corner facility, said the
smoke detectors in the rooms and
corridors in the suites are "too sensi
tive for the given amount of square
footage' and are being replaced by
the smoke detector manufacturer,
Pyrotechnics.
According to project manager
Elizabeth Kittas, Pyrotechnics used a
new type of smoke detector in the
suites that is more sensitive than the
type used in the Independent
Houses. Pyrotechnics has had prob
lems with this new model in other
places, Kittas said, and has told the
contractor for Governor's Corner,
Rudolph & Sletten. to replace the
overly sensitive detectors.
Ben Stetson, contracting represen
tative for Rudolph & Sletten at Gov
ernor's corner, said he just received
238 new smoke detectors and will
begin the replacements tomorrow.
This replacement is being conducted
"at no cost to the owner," he said.
Van Houten recently tallied the fire
alarm reports received by the Gover
nor's Corner Facilities Office and
concluded that the "prevailing
theory" that the fire alarms were
caused by "student ignorance" was
incorrect.

Van Houten discovered that only
13 out of the 30 alarms this quarter
were possibly caused by students,
and she said she even questioned
this high number. According to Van
Houten, the reports showed that
students operating vacuums, smok
ing in bed, cooking toast and using
popcorn poppers had all triggered
the fire alarms. In addition, five
"mischievous" alarms were re
ported.
The rest of the reports cited "no
cause," trouble with the system,"
or "malfunction" as the cause of the
alarms, Van Houten said.
In addition, Van Houten said,
many more alarms occurred than the
reports indicated. "I know that there
were more than th.it," she said. The
Resident Assistants from Governor's
Corner just "laughed in my face,"
she said, when she informed them of
the low number ot alarm reports she
had found for their houses. Van
Houten said the Fire Department
evidently had not forwarded all of
the reports, but she added that the
tire officials were not required to do
this.
The University has been con
cerned that students are becoming
"inured" to the alarms, Carroll said.
"So many alarms are going off that
they're not responding anymore,"
he said.
The smoke detector replacement
should alleviate much of the frustra
tion experienced by the residents of
Governor's Corner. A petition in
forming University President Donald
Kennedy that the residents are "very
upset over the high frequency of fire
alarms that occur here" and asking
him to "institute some action to sig
nificantly improve the situation" re
cently circulated in the suites.
