## Housing agreements: the binding rules no one reads 
### DANIEL LABOV 
Everyday of his life, Abdul
lives in terror. Abdul, who re
sides in Roble Hall, fears evic
tion from the University res l
dence system, because he is in
technical violation of the resi
dence agreement. What is Ab
dul's crime?
Abdul is a fish.
When owner |on Doe (the
name has been changed to
protect the possibly innocent)
bought Abdul, he was unaware
ot the stipulation in his hous
ing agreement that, "The keep
ing of pets in or about Univer
sity residences is strictly prohi
bited." )on, like all students
was required to sign a contrac
tual agreement and accepi
several responsibilities aionf:
with his University residence
assignment. Unfortunately
many students do not bothei
to read this agreement; as a re
suit, several rule infraction'

and many misconceptions as to
the nature of the agreement
have arisen. Some students be
lieve the arrangement to be an
oppressive infringement on
their rights and that they are
being treated unfairly.
Upon realizing that both he
and Abdul were technically
subjet t to disciplinary action or
eviction. Jon became very per
turbed and lashed out at the
administration.
"It Abdul were to be evicted,
it would be a gross miscarriage
of justice. The law exists for the
people, not the people for the
law. We would, by principle,
be forced to tight such a deci
sion all the way to the Supreme
Court,"he said.
Fortunately for lon, his fears
are largely unsubstantiated,
based on misconceptions of
the administration's objec
tives. The most salient of these
v\as pointed out by Dean of

Student Affairs Norm Robin
son, "The main principle in
volved in the residence agree
ment is respect for the rights
and property of others,"
Robinson said
Abdul and his like are safe
from persecution. The admin
istration understands that their
presence is compatible with
such respect; clearly, they see
the spirit as more important
than the letter of the law.
Robinson was asked if he
was aware ot many significant
infractions ot the residence
agreement. No, there really
are not many. But then, there
aren't a lot of rules here at Stan
ford to begin with. By not hav
ing many rules, we have more
responsibility on the part of
students," he replied.
Row Director Diana Conklin
concurred with this sentiment,
while pointing out one or two
problematic areas. "The only

time I become aware of many
problems is when students de
cide to move off campus. Stu
dents sometimes don't realise
that they have signed an
agreement (to pay rent) for the
entire academic year, she
said. To move out of a resi
dence while still registered
with the University, one must
obtain a release from the
agreement, which might be
granted by the Student Affairs
office.
Conklin strongly advises ail
students to carefully read the
residence agreement pam
phlet, because most problems
or ambiguities that exist are a
result of not doing so. A copy
can be obtained at Rm. 317 Old
Union or at the Row Office. "I
couldn't guess how many stu
dents actually read it. They
shouid, because they sign it,
and it is binding," she said
Two controversial areas of
the agreement concern room
improvements and damages.
The agreement states that
structural modifications re
quire "the prior aproval of the
appropriate facilities manager.
Thus room improvement
policies tend to vary from dorm
to dorm, sometimes appearing
arbitrary. For example, resi
dents of Storev House were
told they could not build lofts,
because they were not compat
ible with the intended design.
While this may seem unfair to
some of the current residents,
presumably the intended de

sign is important to future oc
cupants of the house, and
therefore should indeed be
protected Most dorms adopt
the policy that physical
( hanges may be made, so long
as the room is restored to its
original condition at the end of
the year.
Students often complain
about the charges they are
forced to pay to cover damages
to University properly. )on
Christenson, who lived in
Branner Hall, gave an example:
"Last year, a certain group of
£uvs in my dorm would consis
tently get drunk and do dam
age, like putting holes in the
walls around our pool table.
Yet since no individual could
be proven responsible, much
of our dorm funds were
squandered on the reckless
ness of a few people. Also, the
bills usually seemed exorbit
antly high. '
Dean Robinson was asked if
the damage bills were made in
tentionally high for punitive
reasons. "No," he replied,
"the bills only reflect the costs
involved. The repairs can be
costly because we have to pay
someone to drive all the way
down from Plant Services, per
form them and then drive
back."
Most of the fraternities on
campus are sub|ect to a similar
set of rules as the dorms, as
described in a separate docu
ment specifically dealing with
fraternities. Some fraternities,

however, own their own
house, and thereby escape
many of the University regula
tions. Paul Toback, a member
of Sigma Chi, was asked about
the merits of such a situation.
He responded, "Yeah, owning
our own house has a lot of
great advantages. For example,
we are more able to per

sonalize our rooms by making
any improvements we want.
Repairs are of»en cheaper since
we do the work ourselves. On
the other hand, you can't
knock the University resi
dences either; there's some
thing to be said for reliable
heat, hot water, and function
ing facilities as well."

the spirit as more important
than the letter of the law.
Robinson was asked if he
was aware ot many significant
infractions ot the residence
agreement. No, there really
are not many. But then, there
aren't a lot of rules here at Stan
ford to begin with. By not hav
ing many rules, we have more
responsibility on the part of
students," he replied.
Row Director Diana Conklin
concurred with this sentiment,
while pointing out one or two
problematic areas. "The only

time I become aware of many
problems is when students de
cide to move off campus. Stu
dents sometimes don't realise
that they have signed an
agreement (to pay rent) for the
entire academic year, she
said. To move out of a resi
dence while still registered
with the University, one must
obtain a release from the
agreement, which might be
granted by the Student Affairs
office.
Conklin strongly advises ail
students to carefully read the
residence agreement pam

or ambiguities that exist are a
result of not doing so. A copy
can be obtained at Rm. 317 Old
Union or at the Row Office. "I
couldn't guess how many stu
dents actually read it. They
shouid, because they sign it,
and it is binding," she said
Two controversial areas of
the agreement concern room
improvements and damages.
The agreement states that
structural modifications re
quire "the prior aproval of the
appropriate facilities manager.
Thus room improvement
policies tend to vary from dorm
to dorm, sometimes appearing
arbitrary. For example, resi
dents of Storev House were
told they could not build lofts,
because they were not compat
ible with the intended design.
While this may seem unfair to
some of the current residents,
presumably the intended de

sign is important to future oc
cupants of the house, and
therefore should indeed be
protected Most dorms adopt
the policy that physical
( hanges may be made, so long
as the room is restored to its
original condition at the end of
the year.
Students often complain
about the charges they are
forced to pay to cover damages
to University properly. )on
Christenson, who lived in
Branner Hall, gave an example:
"Last year, a certain group of
£uvs in my dorm would consis
tently get drunk and do dam
age, like putting holes in the
walls around our pool table.
Yet since no individual could
be proven responsible, much
of our dorm funds were
squandered on the reckless
ness of a few people. Also, the
bills usually seemed exorbit
antly high. '
Dean Robinson was asked if
the damage bills were made in
tentionally high for punitive
reasons. "No," he replied,
"the bills only reflect the costs
involved. The repairs can be
costly because we have to pay
someone to drive all the way
down from Plant Services, per
form them and then drive
back."
Most of the fraternities on
campus are sub|ect to a similar
set of rules as the dorms, as
described in a separate docu
ment specifically dealing with
fraternities. Some fraternities,

however, own their own
house, and thereby escape
many of the University regula
tions. Paul Toback, a member
of Sigma Chi, was asked about
the merits of such a situation.
He responded, "Yeah, owning
our own house has a lot of
great advantages. For example,
we are more able to per

sonalize our rooms by making
any improvements we want.
Repairs are of»en cheaper since
we do the work ourselves. On
the other hand, you can't
knock the University resi
dences either; there's some
thing to be said for reliable
heat, hot water, and function
