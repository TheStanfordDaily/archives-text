# Stress: learning to cope
## 
### FELICIA LEE 
The pressures of school
work, relationships, plan
ning for the future, and
even pleasant surprises can
cause stress for Stanford
students, according to ]ura
Dargis, heac! of the Stress
Management program at
Counseling and Psycholog
ical Services (CAPS) and
leader of a ninety-minute
discussion entit'ed "Life
style and Stress" held in Ar
royo 'ar,t Monday
noon.
"Stress is a part of every
day life," Dargis told the
audience of about twenty
students. She added that
life here, at a competitive
university, is especially
stressful.
The discussion, she said,
was designed to "identify
what the stresses are in our
own iives." Different things
cause stress for different
people, she said, and posi
tive, as well as negative

events in people's lives can
bring about stress as well.
Worrying about what to do
with a million dollars, she
told the group, could be a
stressful experience.
The causes and effects of
stress. Dargis said, are both
physiological and psycho
logical.
She also added that exer
cise can be an aid in reduc
ing physical stress telling
the students P'lcen 'Min
utes ot walking will do you
more good than a tran
quilizer."
Another problem faced
by Stanford students, she
said, is that many tend to fill
their lives so full with
pressures and commit
ments that they have little or
no time to rest or reflect
upon their own lives.
"Learn to say no!" she
emphasized, saying, "This
should be followed by 3000

asterisks."
The willingness to talk to
other people or ask for help
is also an important factor in
dealing with stress, she
said. She added that stu
dents should not be
ashamed to seek help if they
need it. "Lots of stress
doesn't mean you're crazy,"
she reassured the group.
She also said the CAPS pro
vides services for students
dealing with stress, and
emphasized that "people
don't have to be strait-jacket
material" to utilize them.
The students largely felt
that the pressu res of
schoolwork and worrying
about the future were their
main concerns.
She applauded Stanford's
liberal stopping-out policy,
however, for its considera
tion tor students who need
time to reevaluate their
goals and lives.
