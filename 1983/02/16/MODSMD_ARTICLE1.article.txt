# Tresidder to be revamped

### TIM GRIEVE Staff writer 
I he Tresidder Union Board has approved major
changes for the complex, including the elimination of
the howling alley and the expansion of both the Store
and the Coffee House.
By about August 1984 the bowling alley will be re
placed by a much larger version of the Store, which
could include a pharmacy or an area where customers
could purchase health food items in bulk. The new loca
tion would also give the Store a much larger storage
area. I his could allow the Store to purchase in greater
quantity, thus paying and charging less, explained Ted
Hoef, head of marketing for Tresidder.
The old store area will lie used for a small specialty
food stand, which could be another student entrepre
neur operation similar to the Corner Pocket.
At about the same time, the Coffee House will also be
expanded, moving into the area currently occupied by
the video game room. The games will be moved to a
sound-proofed area in part of what used to be the bowl
ing alley. T he seating, kitchen and service areas of the
Coffee House will be redesigned to serve more custom
ers effectively.
I he changes are part of a Tresidder Space Committee
report which the Union Board approved and adopted
last month. The committee based its recommendation

on surveys taken during the last two years of students,
faculty and tenants of Tresidder, and on the desire for
more effective use of some of Tresidder's space.
According to the report, the committee wished to
improve current heavily used programs and to eliminate
those programs that do not attract as many users. "It is
our intent to strengthen what we do well (for example,
the Store) and diminish or eliminate services that are no
longer needed by the campus community, or ones that
we can't or don't do well (e.g., bowling)."
The space committee also stated that it wished to
move "impulse" services, such as the ticket office,
downstairs, where they would attract customers walking
by. In turn, "destination" services, such as Sequoia
Travel and Stanford Hairstyling, will be moved upstairs,
since users of these services head spec ifically for them.
The committee also pointed out the need for more
meeting space at Tresidder.
To accomplish these goals, the space occupied by
Wells Fargo Bank upstairs will be cut to 1500 square feet,
one-third of its current size. According to )oyce Treme
wan, assistant vice president and manager of the Wells
Fargo branch at Fresidder, this size reduction should not
pose any problems for the bank.
"It (the space reduction) is not necessarily going to
make things different. There are a lot of changes in the
