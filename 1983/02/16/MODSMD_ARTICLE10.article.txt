# Abortion rate high
## 
### FELICIA LEE Staff writer 
One out of six female
Stanford students will have
an abortion during her years
here, according to Jerry Tal
ley, consulting associate
professor of sociology and
the leader of a Mental
Health Week Workshop on
Sexual Etiquette held last
week.
The situation arises not
because of ignorance about
birth control or because of
lack of facilities but because
of a lack of communication
with her partner, Talley
said.
For example, he said,
everyone has difficulty
bringing up the subject of
birth control in a relation
ship. And how does a girl
tell her boyfriend she thinks
she's pregnant?
The Whitman House dis
cussion was casual but often
laced with humor. The 25
students who gathered to
hear the discussion initially
appeared slightly nervous
about expressing their
views. But because the dis
cussion centered on
scenarios acted out by ran
domly chosen students
from the audience, the stu
dents became more open
and relaxed about speaking
in the group. Talley empha
sized at the beginning of the
discussion that he was not
there to tell the students his
views, but to help them de
velop their own.
"You're going to be doing
most of it (the discussion)
not me," he said.
In each of the scenes
acted out during the discus
sion, Talley would assign
the pair of students in
volved in a situation to be
acted out and resolved in

the best way possible. Each
student, however, was
given a "secret" to be dealt
with which the other was
not told about.
The first scene to be per
formed and discussed in
volved the difficult issue of
broaching the subject of
birth control. In the scene,
it was the male student who
had to bring up the subject,
while the female student
(who was not told of his as
signed task) was told that for
the scene, she was to play
the part of a student who
disliked "presumptuous
Stanford men."
As expected, there were
some uneasy moments dur
ing the course of the scene.
The male student admitted
at the end of the scene that
he could find "no tactful
way" to approach the sub
ject.
"I was sitting outside the
door (while his partner for
the scene was being as
signed her role) thinking of
how to lead into this," he
said.
Talley said that the prob
lem of discussing birth con
trol is a difficult one for
many Stanford students.
According to a Cowell sur
vey taken last year, he said,
few couples here discuss
the matter at all before be
ginning a sexual relation
ship.
Talley then asked the
female students in the audi
ence if they would feel of
fended if their boyfriends
were to bring up the subject
of birth control. A majority
of the students said no.
"I would be so relieved!"

one student said. Another
said she would consider it a
sign of concern.
Another scene involved
an equally difficult situation
— that of a woman telling
her partner she might be
pregnant. Here, however,
the main problem was not
that of bringing up the sub
ject of pregnancy, but that
of understanding the fears
and emotions involved.
"We're very quick to deal
with problems, but very
slow in dealing with
people," Talley said. Some
times it would be more ap
propriate to deal with the
emotional aspect of the
problem first, then deal
with the rest of it at a
different time, he added.
Female students added
that it may be difficult for
men to understand how
traumatic the situation can
be for a woman, even if she
only thinks she's pregnant.
"You very quickly lose sight
of the fact that you may not
be pregnant," one female
student said.
On the lighter side of the
issue of sexual etiquette,
the last scene involved a less
earthshaking, but still
touchy subject: that of tel
ling one's partner he or she
does not kiss well. Here,
students agreed that hon
esty and directness, as well
as tact, should be utilized in
breaking the news.
Talley said the problem
can sometimes be brought
up and resolved with a
sense of humor. "But it's
sometimes tactless," he
warned.

"You're going to be doing
most of it (the discussion)
not me," he said.
In each of the scenes
acted out during the discus
sion, Talley would assign
the pair of students in
volved in a situation to be
acted out and resolved in

the best way possible. Each
student, however, was
given a "secret" to be dealt
with which the other was
not told about.
The first scene to be per
formed and discussed in
volved the difficult issue of
broaching the subject of
birth control. In the scene,
it was the male student who
had to bring up the subject,
while the female student
(who was not told of his as
signed task) was told that for
the scene, she was to play
the part of a student who
disliked "presumptuous
Stanford men."
As expected, there were
some uneasy moments dur
ing the course of the scene.
The male student admitted
at the end of the scene that
he could find "no tactful
way" to approach the sub
ject.
"I was sitting outside the
door (while his partner for
the scene was being as
signed her role) thinking of
how to lead into this," he
said.
Talley said that the prob
lem of discussing birth con
trol is a difficult one for
many Stanford students.
According to a Cowell sur
vey taken last year, he said,
few couples here discuss
the matter at all before be
ginning a sexual relation
ship.
Talley then asked the
female students in the audi
ence if they would feel of
fended if their boyfriends
were to bring up the subject
of birth control. A majority
of the students said no.
"I would be so relieved!"

one student said. Another
said she would consider it a
sign of concern.
Another scene involved
an equally difficult situation
— that of a woman telling
her partner she might be
pregnant. Here, however,
the main problem was not
that of bringing up the sub
ject of pregnancy, but that
of understanding the fears
and emotions involved.
"We're very quick to deal
with problems, but very
slow in dealing with
people," Talley said. Some
times it would be more ap
propriate to deal with the
emotional aspect of the
problem first, then deal
with the rest of it at a
different time, he added.
Female students added
that it may be difficult for
men to understand how
traumatic the situation can
be for a woman, even if she
only thinks she's pregnant.
"You very quickly lose sight
of the fact that you may not
be pregnant," one female
student said.
On the lighter side of the
issue of sexual etiquette,
the last scene involved a less
earthshaking, but still
touchy subject: that of tel
ling one's partner he or she
does not kiss well. Here,
students agreed that hon
esty and directness, as well
as tact, should be utilized in
breaking the news.
Talley said the problem
can sometimes be brought
up and resolved with a
sense of humor. "But it's
sometimes tactless," he
warned.
