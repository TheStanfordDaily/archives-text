## The 						Stanford Daily NCAA on right track 
### 
Academic standards of student-athletes have
been a subject of continuing controversy in
higher education. Last month the National Col
legiate Athletic Association (NCAA) unwittingly
added to the controversy in passing Proposal 48,
which is designed to tighten eligibility require
ments tor prospective college athletes.
Proposal 48, scheduled to take effect in 1986,
requires that an incoming high school senior, to
be eligible for varsity competition, must score at
least a combined 700 on the SAT or 15 on the
ACT. At the same time, he must maintain a
minimum high school grade point averageof 2.0
in a specified core curriculum which includes
three years of English, two of mathematics, two
of social science and two of physical or natural
science.
While these requirements may seem rela
tively low for Stanford, whose admission stan
dards demand far more academic accomplish
ment, some black educators have charged that
these requirements are discriminatory or even
racist. A majority of whites score above 700 on
the SAT; a majority of blacks do not.
Jesse Stone, president of Southern Univer
sity, said, "I think the action taken by the NCAA
is seriously tainted. I think it is patently racist."
Such criticism unfairly impugns the NCAA's
motives. Proposal 48 expresses a genuine con
cern of educators — that incoming athletes are
not academically prepared and are sub
sequently used by universities to enhance their
profitable sports programs. The proposal tells
high schools to do a better job of preparing their
student-athletes while also making clear to pro

spective recruits what is expected of them. It
does not tell colleges whom to admit nor does it
prevent any person from receiving a schol
arship.
In also adopting Proposal 49b, which allows a
student-athlete to compete at the varsity level if
he successfully completes his freshman
academic program, the NCAA has given
student-athletes a chance to prove themselves
despite low test scores.
YVe feel these proposals are a good first step.
But they do not fully address the problem of
exploitation of talented athletes. Some schools
that rely heavily on sports programs for revenue
and prestige have developed highly questiona
ble academic programs for their prized athletes.
Creighton basketball player Kevin Ross went
through four years of college and never learned
to read or write above a second grade level.
The NCAA must encourage support programs
for athletes. The demands of a varsity sport are
great and guidance is especially needed.
Further, the academic programs of the member
institutions must be thoroughly examined. The
NCAA should require competition in the class
room as a prerequisite to competition on the
playing field.
The problem is larger than black athletes and
white institutions. At issue is the academic
preparation of athletes in the entire educational
system. Since only about 2 percent of all college
athletes ever sign contracts to play professional
football, baseball or basketball, the other 98
percent need marketable skills to support
themselves. The NCAA has the right idea, but it
has far to go.
