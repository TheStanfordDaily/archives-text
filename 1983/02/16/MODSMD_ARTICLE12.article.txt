## Search for the cosmic man 
### 
Bishop Boillon of Verdun, know
ing me for many years through my
pilgrimages to the battlefield and the
legacy I received from Einstein, in
vited me to address the first interna
tional peace conference of the World
Union of Martyred Towns, Peace
Towns, held in Verdun in October
1982. As I was introduced to the
mayors of Lidice, Warsaw, Coventry
and Volgograd, I stopped while hold
ing the hand of the representative
from Hiroshima. I had on my tongue
to say, "Einstein told me that he
wanted to have the bomb explode on
an uninhabited island in the Pacific
with the Japanese High Command
invited to observe, but Truman's mil
itary advisors rejected the idea.
When Einstein heard of the tragedy,
he shut himself up for eight days in
mourning, refusing to see anyone."
It was as if Einstein's spirit whispered
to me: "Have you forgotten that I
told you once not to defend me." I
left this Buddhist monk in silence
while the face of another churchman
came to my mind: Fulton Sheen.
As a young Monsignor he liked to
follow the hierarchical trend of
thought, "The Jews are the out
group," and made light of Einstein's
thoughts on Cosmic Religion by say
ing that one only needed to cross out
the "s" in "cosmic" and the truth
would be evident. When Sheen, my
friend of many years, read one of my
conversations with Einstein, he had a
change of mind and in repentance
sent me to ask Einstein for permis
sion to make a special broadcast in
New York about him. Einstein re
fused, because he did not care if the
Catholics, through the mouth of
their most popular orator, changed
their opinion about him. Bringing
the "no" back to Bishop Sheen, I said
that I now understood why he, who
sometimes dared to change his mind
in opposition to the prevailing opin
ion of his superiors, had never be
come a cardinal, and if he had lived
some centuries before might well
have joined the long procession to
the chambers of the Inquisition, in

good company with Galileo and
others.
Recounting these events in Stan
ford, I was told by the students that if
Einstein had been a Catholic, Rome
would acknowledge his saintliness. I
answered, "Einstein's ashes had, as
he wanted it, long been carried away
with the waters into the ocean of ob
livion." And if I were asked to write
some words for posterity of this man
who told me that if he had to come
back to earth he would like to be
come a shoemaker and not a scien
tist, I would write this Letter to
Youth:
Youth of the world, in fulfilling
Einstein's plea to found a Cosmic Re
ligion as well as a World Youth Parli
ament, remember that your con
science must be nourished with
spiritual food fitting your personal
equation. For almost 70 years I have
repeatedly called my vow into re
membrance, replenishing it with
Francis of Assisi's words, "God,
make me an instrument of your
peace," or with Paramahansa
Yogananda's advice, "Watch your
spirit, for it is the carpet on which
you walk to the next plane of exis
tence." The cosmic religion, Einstein
suggested, does not destroy reli
gious values of traditional beliefs,
but embraces them in accord with
the words which Jesus learned from
his mother, "Hear O Israel, the Eter
nal is our God, the Eternal is one,"
and in acceptance of the challenge to
his disciples, "You can do even
greater things than I because I go to
my Father." Over the portals of the
assembly houseofthe Cosmic Man, I
would like you youth to write these
words in honor of Einstein: "Salva
tion is self-awareness, the path led
ing to the Innermost Self — the Su
preme Law or God."
When some years ago Queen
Elizabeth, the Queen Mother, after
reading my book on Verdun, invited
me to a luncheon in her St. James
Palace, attended by four gentlemen
in-waiting, one of the young officers
asked me under what principle the

Cosmic Religion and the World Parli
ament of Youth would function. I
would like you, my readers, to pon
der my answer: you are not here by
accident. Mobilizing your free will to
create a new heart in you by your
conscience, you will unfold psychic
energy whose serene vibrations will
help others whom you meet to see
themselves in their relationship to
their ego. The true value of the
human being is cosmic significance
transforming the karmic connection
with your past. Let your conscience
always create the significance of the
moment. Have holy curiousity, as
Einstein taught us.
Einstein visualized the composi
tion of the Youth parliament to in
clude the Russians, Chinese and
every nationality and race and to
begin regardless of whether a nation
rejects the invitation. Form study
groups in the universities of every
nation and whereever you go sow
the vision of the Cosmic Man. Before
you join any movement or group,
examine its aims and beware those
power structures which have as their
motto, "We have the only truth."
Learn to discern the difference be
tween your conscience and the
pseudo-conscience of a group.
Never forget the power of your vibra
tions as a Cosmic Being. Truth is as
infinite as the Cosmic Man, whose
conscience is the voice of the Su
preme.
When I, a young veteran of the
Kaiser's war, visited Einstein in 1930,
he pointed to the marching feet of
the Hitler youth in the street below
and asked, "When will the young
people learn from history?" Youth of
the world, my torch lit by my con
science on the bloodiest battlefield
in history I pass on to you.

some centuries before might well
have joined the long procession to
the chambers of the Inquisition, in

good company with Galileo and
others.
Recounting these events in Stan
ford, I was told by the students that if
Einstein had been a Catholic, Rome
would acknowledge his saintliness. I
answered, "Einstein's ashes had, as
he wanted it, long been carried away
with the waters into the ocean of ob
livion." And if I were asked to write
some words for posterity of this man
who told me that if he had to come
back to earth he would like to be
come a shoemaker and not a scien
tist, I would write this Letter to
Youth:
Youth of the world, in fulfilling
Einstein's plea to found a Cosmic Re
ligion as well as a World Youth Parli
ament, remember that your con
science must be nourished with
spiritual food fitting your personal
equation. For almost 70 years I have
repeatedly called my vow into re
membrance, replenishing it with
Francis of Assisi's words, "God,
make me an instrument of your
peace," or with Paramahansa
Yogananda's advice, "Watch your
spirit, for it is the carpet on which
you walk to the next plane of exis
tence." The cosmic religion, Einstein
suggested, does not destroy reli
gious values of traditional beliefs,
but embraces them in accord with
the words which Jesus learned from
his mother, "Hear O Israel, the Eter
nal is our God, the Eternal is one,"
and in acceptance of the challenge to
his disciples, "You can do even
greater things than I because I go to
my Father." Over the portals of the
assembly houseofthe Cosmic Man, I
would like you youth to write these
words in honor of Einstein: "Salva
tion is self-awareness, the path led
ing to the Innermost Self — the Su
preme Law or God."
When some years ago Queen
Elizabeth, the Queen Mother, after
reading my book on Verdun, invited
me to a luncheon in her St. James
Palace, attended by four gentlemen
in-waiting, one of the young officers
asked me under what principle the

Cosmic Religion and the World Parli
ament of Youth would function. I
would like you, my readers, to pon
der my answer: you are not here by
accident. Mobilizing your free will to
create a new heart in you by your
conscience, you will unfold psychic
energy whose serene vibrations will
help others whom you meet to see
themselves in their relationship to
their ego. The true value of the
human being is cosmic significance
transforming the karmic connection
with your past. Let your conscience
always create the significance of the
moment. Have holy curiousity, as
Einstein taught us.
Einstein visualized the composi
tion of the Youth parliament to in
clude the Russians, Chinese and
every nationality and race and to
begin regardless of whether a nation
rejects the invitation. Form study
groups in the universities of every
nation and whereever you go sow
the vision of the Cosmic Man. Before
you join any movement or group,
examine its aims and beware those
power structures which have as their
motto, "We have the only truth."
Learn to discern the difference be
tween your conscience and the
pseudo-conscience of a group.
Never forget the power of your vibra
tions as a Cosmic Being. Truth is as
infinite as the Cosmic Man, whose
conscience is the voice of the Su
preme.
When I, a young veteran of the
Kaiser's war, visited Einstein in 1930,
he pointed to the marching feet of
the Hitler youth in the street below
and asked, "When will the young
people learn from history?" Youth of
the world, my torch lit by my con
science on the bloodiest battlefield
in history I pass on to you.

Bishop Boillon of Verdun, know
ing me for many years through my
pilgrimages to the battlefield and the
legacy I received from Einstein, in
vited me to address the first interna
tional peace conference of the World
Union of Martyred Towns, Peace
Towns, held in Verdun in October
1982. As I was introduced to the
mayors of Lidice, Warsaw, Coventry
and Volgograd, I stopped while hold
ing the hand of the representative
from Hiroshima. I had on my tongue
to say, "Einstein told me that he
wanted to have the bomb explode on
an uninhabited island in the Pacific
with the Japanese High Command
invited to observe, but Truman's mil
itary advisors rejected the idea.
When Einstein heard of the tragedy,
he shut himself up for eight days in
mourning, refusing to see anyone."
It was as if Einstein's spirit whispered
to me: "Have you forgotten that I
told you once not to defend me." I
left this Buddhist monk in silence
while the face of another churchman
came to my mind: Fulton Sheen.
As a young Monsignor he liked to
follow the hierarchical trend of
thought, "The Jews are the out
group," and made light of Einstein's
thoughts on Cosmic Religion by say
ing that one only needed to cross out
the "s" in "cosmic" and the truth
would be evident. When Sheen, my
friend of many years, read one of my
conversations with Einstein, he had a
change of mind and in repentance
sent me to ask Einstein for permis
sion to make a special broadcast in
New York about him. Einstein re
fused, because he did not care if the
Catholics, through the mouth of
their most popular orator, changed
their opinion about him. Bringing
the "no" back to Bishop Sheen, I said
that I now understood why he, who
sometimes dared to change his mind
in opposition to the prevailing opin
ion of his superiors, had never be
come a cardinal, and if he had lived
some centuries before might well
have joined the long procession to
the chambers of the Inquisition, in

good company with Galileo and
others.
