Little to cheer about in Israel

The enthusiasm of the editorial
hailing Israel as "a bastion of democ
racy in a region full of turmoil"
("Massacre and Israeli report/' D.tily,
Feb. 14) because an independent
commission was allowed to investi
gate Israel's role in the massacre of
hundreds of Palestinians last Sep
tember seems excessive.
For one thing, the commission
showed a strange lack of interest in
the fact that Israeli intelligence
forces must have known that the
Palestinian refugee camps did not
harbor armed fighters but were, in
fact, defenseless. Vet Israeli com
manders sent in the Phalangists, who
were obviously thirsting for revenge
following the assassination of their
leader, and provided them with fresh
supplies even after Israeli soldiers
knew the massacre was taking place.
Surely Israel's responsibility goes
beyond the commission's finding ot
"negligent e. "
The fact that Israel is a democracy
is largely irrelevant to the Lebanese
people who continue to live under
Israeli military occupation, or to the
hundreds of thousands of Palesti
nians in Lebanon who still face terror

from militias trained and equipped
by Israel.
Israel's bastion of democracy does
not extend to southern Lebanon,
where it holds thousands of Palesti
nians in prison and where Israel's
surrogate forces under Major Saad
Haddad continue to murder Palesti
nians and Lebanese Moslems. Nor
does Israeli democracy extend to the
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip,
where more than a million Palesti
nians are denied almost every right
that free citizens enjoy and where
Israeli troops have been ordered to
beat and shoot (hildren. South Af
rica, after all. is "a bastion of democ
racy," too â€” for those who are white.
There are indeed democratic
forces within Israel. They protested
against the Beirut massacre and
forced the official inquiry on a reluc
tant Menachem Begin. They have
urged that Israel end its occupation
of neighboring territory and respond
to the Palestinian Liberation Organi
zation's repeated offers to negotiate
peace in exchange for an indepen
dent Palestinian state on the West
Bank and Gaza Strip. The Begin gov
ernment has called these Israeli

moderates "traitors." Supporters of
Defense Minister Ariel Sharon have
threatened them with violence and
one peace demonstrator was killed
last week. Even the judges who in
vestigated the Beirut Massacre are
under 24-hour guard because of
threats made against them.
Despite the commission's find
ings, the policies that led to the Be
irut massacre remain unchanged.
Sharon continues as an influential
member of the cabinet. The fact that
a ma|ority of Israeli voters support
Begin and Sharon does not make
their aggressive actions "democra
tic," since the victims of these ac
tions have no chance to vote.
1 he horrors of the Beirut massacre
should have shocked Israel's leaders
into realizing the futility of using mili
tary force to settle the Israeli-
Palestinian conflict. But instead it has
led them to close ranks and accuse
their opponents of treachery. So
there is little to cheer about in the
aftermath of the tragedy at Sabra and
Chatilla.
