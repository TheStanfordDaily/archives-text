# Drug use is a serious concern
## 
### 
It appears that the national debate over the use and
sale of illegal drugs, if, indeed, there has ever been a
policy-oriented discussion on the issue of drugs worthy
of the label "debate," has faded into the background of
American politics. Apart from occasional references to
the large volume of illicit drug sales that has become a
virtually unchallenged feature of the status quo, news
reports about the use and sale of drugs are presented as
"human interest" stories in newscasts and newspapers.
A number of Americans have no doubt derived a great
deal of amusement from watching the respective drug
escapades of )ohn De Lorean and Nancy Reagan and
listening to reports that Florida's police forces and the
Coast Guard are accruing a considerable fortune
through the confiscation of boats, planes and cars used
in drug deals — a practice that was at one point consid
ered to be a possible means of procuring a presidential
yacht to replace the one that former President Jimmy
Carter so rudely and inconsiderately sold.
The use of drugs is a very serious issue, however, and
it is regrettable that an issue that has a tremendous
impact on America's culture and economy and one that
raises basic questions about the foundations of our
political system has received so little analytical attention.
Serious discussions about the role that the govern
ment should play in regulating the use of drugs have
usually revolved around two schools of thought. The
first of these, which might be called the "libertarian"
school, argues that the use of drugs is a matter for
self-responsible individuals to decide for themselves
without interference from the government. This argu
ment is well-founded in the American liberalist political
tradition, which h»|ds that individuals should be "freeto
choose" their personal lives as long as they do not in
fringe on the rights of others. This school consequently
argues that the "victimless crime" of drug use should
not to be subject to government control.
The second school of thought, which might be termed
the "absolutist" school, fundamentally disagrees with
the libertarians by arguing that drug use is categorically
wrong and should be restricted by the government. This
approach carries with it an implicitly paternalistic role
for the government, which is placed in the position of
saying, in effect, "We know more about how you should
run your life than you do, and we will attempt to make
you run your life correctly." This implicit assertion be
hind active government regulation of drugs thus chal
lenges the liberalist values that lie at the very heart of
America's political culture, values which define the re
spective rights and responsibilities of the state and of
individuals.
Two caveats should be made clear at this point. Obvi
ously these schools of thought have been presented in a
simplified and unified form. Many variations on these
themes have been argued, and some people even claim
to adhere to liberalist values of personal freedom while
maintaining an absolutist attitude toward drugs.
Secondly, neither attitude correctly characterizes the
actual state of enforcement of existing drug laws. Gen
eral observation confirms that drug enforcement has
been directed toward drug dealers rather than drug us-

ers. Whether this is for moral or practical reasons is
unclear. What is clear is that neither the manner in which
our laws regulate drugs nor the manner in which our
government carries out those laws is consistent with the
optimal pursuit of objectives that can be considered
legitimate in a liberalist democratic system.
The purely libertarian approach to drug use is based
on several false premises. Foremost among these is the
fact that the use of drugs is not in all cases a "victimless"
crime. The use of drugs by drivers and by others whose
actions might endanger public safety carry obvious costs
to society. The use of drugs in such situations should be
strictly prohibited, as is the case with alcohol. In addi
tion, public assistance programs such as food stamps
should not be applicable to drug purchases, since these
programs are provided for public ends and are not the
material of individual preferences.
A second more subtle objection is often overlooked
by the libertarian school. This objection lies in the fact
that drugs can alter the decision-making process of indi
viduals through physical and/or mental addiction. When
this happens, individuals can no longer be considered
responsible for themselves, and the government should
assume some responsibility for them as it does for chil
dren and mentally ill people. For the same reason, drugs
should be denied tochildren and mentally ill people. For
the same reason drugs shoud be denied to children and
to others whom the government considers to be not
self-responsible by some legal standards. Finally, the
government should educate the public in the effects of
drugs to ensure that individuals really do understand
what it good for them and what is not.
With these restrictions in mind, there is no reason that
a government that respects the value of personal free
dom should deny the right to use drugs to self
responsible individuals under circumstances in which
their use would not endanger public safety and welfare.
The acceptance of the liberalist ethic of personal choice
compels the government to reject the absolutist school
just as the government has protected religious freedom
through the separation of church and state.
One final consideration is relevant to government
regulation of drug use. Tax theory tells us that taxes
introduce the fewest distortions in the economy when
they are placed on goods for which the demand is inelas
tic, or goods for which almost the same quantity will be
sold no matter what the price. Equity considerations
dictate that such a tax is progressive when it affects
non-necessary items like drugs.
A heavy tax on drug use would thus be an efficient and
equitable source of government revenue. This argu
ment alone should be the overriding consideration in
the selective legalization of drugs at a time when drug
sales in the United States are conservatively estimated at
$80 billion annually and when government revenues are
sorely needed to reduce deficits and remedy the irres
ponsible use of drugs by addicts, children and drivers
that present the real problems of drug abuse.

tion, public assistance programs such as food stamps
should not be applicable to drug purchases, since these
programs are provided for public ends and are not the
material of individual preferences.
A second more subtle objection is often overlooked
by the libertarian school. This objection lies in the fact
that drugs can alter the decision-making process of indi
viduals through physical and/or mental addiction. When
this happens, individuals can no longer be considered
responsible for themselves, and the government should
assume some responsibility for them as it does for chil
dren and mentally ill people. For the same reason, drugs
should be denied tochildren and mentally ill people. For
the same reason drugs shoud be denied to children and
to others whom the government considers to be not
self-responsible by some legal standards. Finally, the
government should educate the public in the effects of
drugs to ensure that individuals really do understand
what it good for them and what is not.
With these restrictions in mind, there is no reason that
a government that respects the value of personal free
dom should deny the right to use drugs to self
responsible individuals under circumstances in which
their use would not endanger public safety and welfare.
The acceptance of the liberalist ethic of personal choice
compels the government to reject the absolutist school
just as the government has protected religious freedom
through the separation of church and state.
One final consideration is relevant to government
regulation of drug use. Tax theory tells us that taxes
introduce the fewest distortions in the economy when
they are placed on goods for which the demand is inelas
tic, or goods for which almost the same quantity will be
sold no matter what the price. Equity considerations
dictate that such a tax is progressive when it affects
non-necessary items like drugs.
A heavy tax on drug use would thus be an efficient and
equitable source of government revenue. This argu
ment alone should be the overriding consideration in
the selective legalization of drugs at a time when drug
sales in the United States are conservatively estimated at
$80 billion annually and when government revenues are
sorely needed to reduce deficits and remedy the irres
ponsible use of drugs by addicts, children and drivers
that present the real problems of drug abuse.

It appears that the national debate over the use and
sale of illegal drugs, if, indeed, there has ever been a
policy-oriented discussion on the issue of drugs worthy
of the label "debate," has faded into the background of
American politics. Apart from occasional references to
the large volume of illicit drug sales that has become a
virtually unchallenged feature of the status quo, news
reports about the use and sale of drugs are presented as
"human interest" stories in newscasts and newspapers.
A number of Americans have no doubt derived a great
deal of amusement from watching the respective drug
escapades of )ohn De Lorean and Nancy Reagan and
listening to reports that Florida's police forces and the
Coast Guard are accruing a considerable fortune
through the confiscation of boats, planes and cars used
in drug deals — a practice that was at one point consid
ered to be a possible means of procuring a presidential
yacht to replace the one that former President Jimmy
Carter so rudely and inconsiderately sold.
The use of drugs is a very serious issue, however, and
it is regrettable that an issue that has a tremendous
impact on America's culture and economy and one that
raises basic questions about the foundations of our
political system has received so little analytical attention.
Serious discussions about the role that the govern
ment should play in regulating the use of drugs have
usually revolved around two schools of thought. The
first of these, which might be called the "libertarian"
school, argues that the use of drugs is a matter for
self-responsible individuals to decide for themselves
without interference from the government. This argu
ment is well-founded in the American liberalist political
tradition, which h»|ds that individuals should be "freeto
choose" their personal lives as long as they do not in
fringe on the rights of others. This school consequently
argues that the "victimless crime" of drug use should
not to be subject to government control.
The second school of thought, which might be termed
the "absolutist" school, fundamentally disagrees with
the libertarians by arguing that drug use is categorically
wrong and should be restricted by the government. This
approach carries with it an implicitly paternalistic role
for the government, which is placed in the position of
saying, in effect, "We know more about how you should
run your life than you do, and we will attempt to make
you run your life correctly." This implicit assertion be
hind active government regulation of drugs thus chal
lenges the liberalist values that lie at the very heart of
America's political culture, values which define the re
spective rights and responsibilities of the state and of
individuals.
Two caveats should be made clear at this point. Obvi
ously these schools of thought have been presented in a
simplified and unified form. Many variations on these
themes have been argued, and some people even claim
to adhere to liberalist values of personal freedom while
maintaining an absolutist attitude toward drugs.
Secondly, neither attitude correctly characterizes the
actual state of enforcement of existing drug laws. Gen
eral observation confirms that drug enforcement has
been directed toward drug dealers rather than drug us-

ers. Whether this is for moral or practical reasons is
unclear. What is clear is that neither the manner in which
our laws regulate drugs nor the manner in which our
government carries out those laws is consistent with the
optimal pursuit of objectives that can be considered
legitimate in a liberalist democratic system.
The purely libertarian approach to drug use is based
on several false premises. Foremost among these is the
fact that the use of drugs is not in all cases a "victimless"
crime. The use of drugs by drivers and by others whose
actions might endanger public safety carry obvious costs
to society. The use of drugs in such situations should be
strictly prohibited, as is the case with alcohol. In addi
tion, public assistance programs such as food stamps
should not be applicable to drug purchases, since these
programs are provided for public ends and are not the
material of individual preferences.
