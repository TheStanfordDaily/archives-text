# CAMPUS DIGEST

### JOAN O'CONNELL 
Repost
Once again we plunge elbow deep into the stacks
of mail that pour into our office every day, past the
perpetually unknown author party invitations, transit
district press releases and into the recent college
newspaper deliveries. The lighter side of campus
coverage this week takes us first to San lose State.
We may have some SLAG", but it seems at San Jose
State they're working on physics marvels of their
own.
The Spartan Daily reports, "At a Jan. 18 meeting,
the Student Union board of directors voted to drop a
swimming pool, diving pool and sun deck from the
center," according to Henry Orbach, associate
executive vice president for facilities and develop
ment and operations.
Our main question is, "Henry, how in the world do
you plan to get all that stuff up on the roof in the first
place?" Oh, plans have been dropped. Hm. Well,
were they rolled up or did they fly all over the place?
Also in the Spartan comes the news of a contest
seeking "the best of the bad."
SJSU instructors are holding a bad writing contest
and have received more than 500 entries so far; each
applicant must submit his or her version of the "worst
opening sentence to the worst of all possible novels."
The contest is named after Edward Lytton Bulwer,
who wrote one of history's worst opening lines, "It
was a dark and stormy night. . . "
Thanks to some breakdowns in the journalistic
crew which tackled the reporting of these awful
stories, meanwhile, Stanford University's English
Dept. has been receiving some of the entries. It
seems Channel 7 in San Francisco reported that the
contest was taking place here on the Farm.
Associated Press mistakenly called the contest
originator Scott Rice, "Bruce Rice," thus provoking
another volume of misaddressed mail over in San
Jose.
The main rule of the contest is that the submission
must be original, Rice told the Spartan Daily.
"Otherwise someone could submit the opening sen
tence of Erica Jong's latest novel." The prizes include
a "lot of dishonorable mentions," Rice added.
The Spartan Daily offers no indication of the appli
cation deadline, but what do you say to this: send us
your entry for this contest. Address it to "Campus

Digest Bad Opening Contest, c/o The Stanford Daily,
Storke Publications Building, Stanford, CA. 94305.
We'll send the top three winners to San Jose State and
see how they compare. It's been rather dark and
stormy lately, anyway.
Magma cum laudes
And from the Daily Northwestern news summary a
fearful message indeed. "St. Helens May Erupt:
Geologists."

Don't judge the Northwesterners too harshly. It
seems they were putting out the paper under dim

conditions, since a power outage on campus left the
staff and the rest of Northwestern University's stu
dents without power for three hours and 45 minutes
last week. According to power official Sam Badger,
reports the Daily Northwestern, Commonwealth Edi
son workers aren't sure what caused the blackout.
"Anything can happen to a system," he added. "A
student could have driven into a pole or a squirrel
could have gotten stuck in the transformer."
Some even speculate that perhaps a badger got
stuck on a pole or that a transformer may have had
trouble adjusting to the new rigorous, scholastic en
vironment.
Don't copy this!
According to a copy, uh, a purchased copyrighted
edition of the Daily Kansan, the textbook photocopy
ing scandal is now hitting the midwest. After inter
viewing several faculty members, the Daily Kansan
put together an interesting story about reactions to
the presumably more strictly enforced rules about
copyrighting these days. The paper noted these re
sponses from Political Science Prof. Clifford Ketzel:
"He said he thought professors who reproduced
some copyrighted works did so because the material
was timely and would help their students."
"It helps further your teaching objectives, so you
do it," Ketzel said.
"I'm probably pushing it a little bit, but I've con
vinced myself that what I'm copying is legal. . .That's
probably not enough from the publishers' point of
view, though."
"Ketzel is right," concluded the Daily Kansan."
The only problem with all this, meanwhile, is th;.
twice in the headlines, the Daily Kansan used the
word "Xerox" as a registered trademark. Sorry guys
— that's probably not enough from the company's
point of view.
Ketzel is right,
Ain't misbehavin'
There's a few noses out of joint at Indiana Univer
sity when it came out that last year's "IU Sing" win
ners weren't necessarily the best performers, accord
ing to the IDS.
Each year, fraternities, sororities and dormitories
present musical medleys and mini-musicals for the
annual event sponsored by the IU Student Founda
tion. It seems the overall winner of the show is not
only the group with the most entertaining presenta
tion, but the group which can also amass enough
production points — for meeting deadlines, prepar
ing neatly-typed scripts and "behaving during re
hearsals and performances." These points account

for one third of the 900 possible points awarded.
It's certainly not hard to sympathize with jim
Badger, a three-year veteran of the IU Sing, and an
unconfirmed possible relative of the Northwestern
University utility superintendent, who said, "IU Sing
is supposed to be fun for everyone involved, but it
really isn't. . . . Being a non-protessional, I thought
I'd be able to put on a non-professional show, but I
guess we're not allowed to."
Letter/Item
Our letter-to-the-editor of the week was found in
the Harvard Crimson.
Students Tim Reagan and Kim Shives write, "We
were very intrigued by one of your recent headlines :
"ludged Decides not to Deport Harvard Doctor/
Rapist" (|an. 19, 1983). Several questions immediately
sprang to mind. First we were not aware that Harvard
even had a position called "doctor/rapist." Does this
represent a joint appointment as both a doctor and a
rapist or is it one integrated position with a com
pound title? Second, now that the subject of your
article has left this position, who has replaced him, or
does the position remain vacant? What qualifications
are required for a doctor/rapist anyway?" No re
sponse provided by the editor/headline writer.

You might think that these tongue-in-cheek jabs at
our journalistic collegues are done with arrogance.
Concerned about this, we had a meeting t' other day.
We voted on whether we thought this column was
okay. Fortunately, it was approved approved.

even had a position called "doctor/rapist." Does this
represent a joint appointment as both a doctor and a
rapist or is it one integrated position with a com
pound title? Second, now that the subject of your
article has left this position, who has replaced him, or
does the position remain vacant? What qualifications
are required for a doctor/rapist anyway?" No re
sponse provided by the editor/headline writer.

You might think that these tongue-in-cheek jabs at
our journalistic collegues are done with arrogance.
Concerned about this, we had a meeting t' other day.
We voted on whether we thought this column was
okay. Fortunately, it was approved approved.

Once again we plunge elbow deep into the stacks
of mail that pour into our office every day, past the
perpetually unknown author party invitations, transit
district press releases and into the recent college
newspaper deliveries. The lighter side of campus
coverage this week takes us first to San lose State.
We may have some SLAG", but it seems at San Jose
State they're working on physics marvels of their
own.
The Spartan Daily reports, "At a Jan. 18 meeting,
the Student Union board of directors voted to drop a
swimming pool, diving pool and sun deck from the
center," according to Henry Orbach, associate
executive vice president for facilities and develop
ment and operations.
Our main question is, "Henry, how in the world do
you plan to get all that stuff up on the roof in the first
place?" Oh, plans have been dropped. Hm. Well,
were they rolled up or did they fly all over the place?
Also in the Spartan comes the news of a contest
seeking "the best of the bad."
SJSU instructors are holding a bad writing contest
and have received more than 500 entries so far; each
applicant must submit his or her version of the "worst
opening sentence to the worst of all possible novels."
The contest is named after Edward Lytton Bulwer,
who wrote one of history's worst opening lines, "It
was a dark and stormy night. . . "
Thanks to some breakdowns in the journalistic
crew which tackled the reporting of these awful
stories, meanwhile, Stanford University's English
Dept. has been receiving some of the entries. It
seems Channel 7 in San Francisco reported that the
contest was taking place here on the Farm.
Associated Press mistakenly called the contest
originator Scott Rice, "Bruce Rice," thus provoking
another volume of misaddressed mail over in San
Jose.
The main rule of the contest is that the submission
must be original, Rice told the Spartan Daily.
"Otherwise someone could submit the opening sen
tence of Erica Jong's latest novel." The prizes include
a "lot of dishonorable mentions," Rice added.
The Spartan Daily offers no indication of the appli
cation deadline, but what do you say to this: send us
your entry for this contest. Address it to "Campus

Digest Bad Opening Contest, c/o The Stanford Daily,
Storke Publications Building, Stanford, CA. 94305.
We'll send the top three winners to San Jose State and
see how they compare. It's been rather dark and
stormy lately, anyway.

And from the Daily Northwestern news summary a
fearful message indeed. "St. Helens May Erupt:
Geologists."

Don't judge the Northwesterners too harshly. It
seems they were putting out the paper under dim

conditions, since a power outage on campus left the
staff and the rest of Northwestern University's stu
dents without power for three hours and 45 minutes
last week. According to power official Sam Badger,
reports the Daily Northwestern, Commonwealth Edi
son workers aren't sure what caused the blackout.
"Anything can happen to a system," he added. "A
student could have driven into a pole or a squirrel
could have gotten stuck in the transformer."
Some even speculate that perhaps a badger got
stuck on a pole or that a transformer may have had
trouble adjusting to the new rigorous, scholastic en
vironment.
Don't copy this!
According to a copy, uh, a purchased copyrighted
edition of the Daily Kansan, the textbook photocopy
ing scandal is now hitting the midwest. After inter
viewing several faculty members, the Daily Kansan
put together an interesting story about reactions to
the presumably more strictly enforced rules about
copyrighting these days. The paper noted these re
sponses from Political Science Prof. Clifford Ketzel:
"He said he thought professors who reproduced
some copyrighted works did so because the material
was timely and would help their students."
"It helps further your teaching objectives, so you
do it," Ketzel said.
"I'm probably pushing it a little bit, but I've con
vinced myself that what I'm copying is legal. . .That's
probably not enough from the publishers' point of
view, though."
"Ketzel is right," concluded the Daily Kansan."
The only problem with all this, meanwhile, is th;.
twice in the headlines, the Daily Kansan used the
word "Xerox" as a registered trademark. Sorry guys
— that's probably not enough from the company's
point of view.
Ketzel is right,
Ain't misbehavin'
There's a few noses out of joint at Indiana Univer
sity when it came out that last year's "IU Sing" win
ners weren't necessarily the best performers, accord
ing to the IDS.
Each year, fraternities, sororities and dormitories
present musical medleys and mini-musicals for the
annual event sponsored by the IU Student Founda
tion. It seems the overall winner of the show is not
only the group with the most entertaining presenta
tion, but the group which can also amass enough
production points — for meeting deadlines, prepar
ing neatly-typed scripts and "behaving during re
hearsals and performances." These points account

for one third of the 900 possible points awarded.
It's certainly not hard to sympathize with jim
Badger, a three-year veteran of the IU Sing, and an
unconfirmed possible relative of the Northwestern
University utility superintendent, who said, "IU Sing
is supposed to be fun for everyone involved, but it
really isn't. . . . Being a non-protessional, I thought
I'd be able to put on a non-professional show, but I
guess we're not allowed to."
