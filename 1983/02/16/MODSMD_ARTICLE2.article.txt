# Kennedy discusses issues on KZSU talk show
## Grant for homosexual students proposed 
### DOUGLAS JEHL Senior staff writer 
The University is currently considering accept
ing a gift that would establish a scholarship lim
ited to homosexual students only, University
President Donald Kennedy said yesterday.
The proposal, however, has "two strikes"
against it already, according to Kennedy.
"What I can tell you at this point. . . isthatl'm
very, very worried about any proposal that re
quires a declaration of faith on the part of the
individual as a requirement — and I don't care
what that declaration of faith is," he said.
Kennedy would not say who offered the gift.
His remarks came in an interview taped yes
terday for KZSU's Campus Conference.
In answer to other questions, Kennedy also
said:
• He would rather see the University share the
cost of ASSU Recycling and other such projects
than grant the ASSU request that it partially sub
sidize salaries of top-level officials.
• He didn't think much of graduate students'
criticism of the system that requires them to sub
sidize undergraduate housing.

• He would be bothered if the current slow
University growth continued for the next few
years.
The original proposal to establish a scholarship
for homosexual students only was rejected by
staff members, Kennedy said, but was resubmit
ted with more arguments by the proposer.
Not only does it require a declaration of faith,
Kennedy said, but "it requires a declaration that
would not be possible for an institution to vali
date without impermissible interference — and I
think that puts two strikes on the proposal al
ready."
Regarding the ASSU request to the provost's
office that the University contribute some
$17,000 to cover three-fourths of the salaries of
six top ASSU offltors, Kennedy said he Wasn't
taking a position right now. "It's before the right
people and I try not to intervene in cases I might
be asked to be the appellate judge for later on,"
he said.
But, he said, "I think everybody would be
much more comfortable if the subsidy didn't in
volve particular payments to particular officials."
Kennedy said that if the University were to help

out the ASSU, it ought to be on a project basis.
"That's not to rule out the possibility that on a
short interval one might get active in a bail-out
situation," Kennedy emphasized. "But they (of
ficers in the provost's office) have got to make
that decision."
In response to a question about the graduate
students complaints about paying for housing
construction that does not benefit them, Ken
nedy emphasized that the University has always
required all students, through the room and
board rate, to pay debt service on previous Uni
versity construction.
"What( er is most recent is going to dominate
the debt w»o o< the room anilboard rate," V>e
said. He pointed out the throughout the mid-'7os
undergraduates subsidized construction costs
for Escondido Village.
A more important question than equity in
room and board rates is to ask who is subsidizing
whom through tuition, Kennedy suggested. "I
think that it's more nearly true that under
graduates are subsidizing graduates."
