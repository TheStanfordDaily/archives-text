## USFL offer Elway says 'no' 
### Associated Press 
Phoenix, Ariz. — Stan
ford's standout quarterback
John Elway, looking at likely
early selection in the Na
tional Football League and a
multi-million-dollar
baseball contract, has
turned down football's new
pro league.
The Oakland Invaders of
the United States Football
League sought the All-
America in the league's ter
ritorial draft and has been
talking with him about a
contract since "about
Christmas," team spokes
man Gino Effler said.
But Elway has told the In
vaders he has "ruled out the
USFL because he's always
had his heart set on graduat
ing with his class. If he
signed with us, he wouldn't
be able to graduate with his
class in )une," Effler said
today in acknowledging that
Elway has turned down the
Invaders offer.
The USFL season that be
gins next month will run
into early summer.
Both Effler and Invaders
coach )ohn Ralston, con

ducting the team's training
camp here, declined com
ment on reports the offer
included a $6.4 million
bonus — or virtual lifetime
security for the 22-year-old
senior at $100,000 a year for
64 years.
That report appeared
today in the Oakland
Tribune.
"I'm sure (team owner)
Tad Taube made some
pretty good provisions in
his offer, but I don't know
any specifics other than that
it was a five-year playing
contract," Effler said.
Elway, an economics
major, is expected to be a
high draft choice in the NFL
and to receive a significant
offer from baseball's New
York Yankees.
But Effler wasn't giving up
hope.
"This is no 'take it now or
leave it' offer," Effler added.
"He's the kind of player
we'd like to have, and he's
extremely popular in the
Bay Area. And Taube's a
good friend of John's father.
We'll continue to follow his
progress."
