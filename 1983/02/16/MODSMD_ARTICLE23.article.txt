# Card to face bruised Bruins on road
## 
### STEVE ODELL Senior sports writer 
Stanford faces a conference-leading al
beit wounded No. 10-ranked UCLA bas
ketball team tomorrow night in an 8 p.m.
Pacific-10 Conference game at the Bruins'
Pauley Pavilion.
The Bruins lost much more than just its
first conference game last Saturday against
Oregon State. UCLA lost two-thirds of its
starting front line as All-America forward
Kenny Fields and center Stuart Gray were
injured in the early minutes.
Fields, who poured in 22 points and
grabbed 10 rebounds in UCLA's 101-87 win
over the Cardinal at Maples Pavilion four
weeks ago, injured his shoulder while at
tempting to retrieve an errant pass in the
game with the Beavers, and is listed as
doubtful for tomorrow. Fields entered the
OSU loss as the conference's second lead
ing scorer and fifth best rebounder.
Sophomore Cray suffered a left knee

strain and will probably miss the rest of the
season. Gray has a second degree strain of
the medial collateral ligament — the same
ligaments Stanford's leading scorer and
rebounder )ohn Revelli tore that sidelined
him for the remainder of 1982-83.
The Cardinal lost yet another player —
junior guard Ricky Lewis — for the rest of
the campaign due to an injury. Lewis, who
separated his shoulder for the sixth time
last week, will undergo surgery today.
Sophomore Brad Wright will start at cen
ter for the Bruins, and Gary Maloncon and
Nigel Miguel will fill in for Fields. Starting
forward Darren Daye will have to shoulder
a large portion of the scoring from down
low.
With two of the Bruin's big inside guns
and an average of over 27 points per game
combined more than likely out of the start
ing line-up, the Cardinal should be able to
concentrate more on defensing the out

side game which burned it in lanuary.
Guard Rod Foster fired in 31 points in a
remarkable outside shooting perform
ance, and backcourt partner Michael
Jackson added 13 as the Cardinal tried in
vain to shut off both the lanes and the
airborne attack of UCLA the first time the
two clubs met.
The absehce ot Gray and Fields should
help Stanford on the boards also, where it
was punished by a 40-26 margin and sur
rendered 1b offensive rebounds last time.
The Cardinal is coming off a last-second
fall-from-ahead loss to Cal, which drop
ped its record to 4-6 in the Pac-10 and 12-8
overall. The Bruins are 9-1 in league play
and 17-3 overall.
Stanford should continue to go with its
same five starters, but seven players will
see a lot of action. Hans Wichary will be at
center, Steve Brown and Earl Koberlein
will be at forwards, and Keith (ones and
Keith Ramee will be in the backcourt.
