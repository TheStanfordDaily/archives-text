# Cardinal takes three from two state schools
## 
### ROB ZWEIG 
The weather cleared just
long enough for the Stanford
baseball team to end a four
game losing streak and push its
season record to b-4-1 with
three wins in two days.
Senior Mike Aldrete
knocked in seven runs and en
joyed a perfect day at the plate
while Eric Hardgrave slugged
two home runs, including a
game ending grand slam in the
nightcap, as Stanford avenged
an earlier loss to San Jose State
by sweeping a doubleheader
Monday at Sunken Diamond
9-2 and 15-11.
The Card then dumped
Stanislaus State 4-1 in another
non-league contest on a damp
and dreary Tuesday afternoon.
"We're happy," manager
Mark Marquess said. "Maybe
not satisfied, but happy with
the wins."
In Monday's first game,
Brian Myers and left Ballard
combined to record a seven
hitter. In the second half of the
twin bill, starter David Harris
lasted only two innings and
three other relievers were
called on before Ballard again
shut the door on the Spartans.
Against Stanislaus State, the
pitching staff was again in con
trol, but the Cardinal bats were

silent for much of the contest.
Myers began his gem inau
spiciously enough when left
fielder Scott Rettig opened the
game with a triple over Mark
Davis' head in right-center.
Shortstop Tom Krause brought
Rettig in by grounding out to
first and SJS had a lead before
most of the crowd had settled
in their seats.
But San jose State couldn't
get to Myers again until the
seventh and by that time the
Cardinal had taken a 3-1 lead.
Freshman center fielder Davis
provided the firepower by
blasting a breaking ball from
Spartan starter Ken Rebiejo
over the 335 sign in left for a
two-run homer after Pete
Stanicek had walked to open
the fifth inning.
Stanford extended their lead
in the sixth when Vince
Sakowski pounded a triple in
the alley in right-center and
scored on |ohn Verducci's sac
rifice fly.
The Card put the game away
with a six-run rally in the bot
tom half of the eighth.
Marquess liked what he saw
the first game. "Myers pitched
an outstanding game today and
Jeff Ballard came in and
pitched well in relief."
The Cardinal manager
couldn't help but note the play
of Davis, whoisfillinginforthe
injured Darryl Stephens, and
called the rookie center fielder
"our most consistent player all
year."
Ballard and Davis played key
roles as Stanford rallied to win
Monday's second game, but it
was the big bats of DM Mike
Aldrete and first baseman Eric
Hardgrave that enabled the
Cardinal to weather a shaky
performance by its pitching
corps.
Hardgrave got all of a 2-2
fastball from reliever Huck
Hibberd and ripped it over the
center field fence to cap a five
run explosion in the bottom of
the seventh inning of the
shortened second game.
Needing only three outs to
seal an 11-10 victory, Hibberd
opened the seventh by plunk
ing )ohn Verducci in the back
with his first pitch. Sophomore
Pete Stanicek then reached out

and slapped a frozen rope line
drive to right that scored Ver
ducci to tie the game.
With Stanicek standing on
third and none out, SJS man
ager Gene Menges decided to
walk Davis and Aldrete, who al
ready had raked the Spartan
pitchers for three hits and five
RBl's. That filled the bases and
set the stage for HarcJgrave's
heroics.
Ironically, Aldrete and
Hardgrave have temporarily
switched positions. "Aldrete
dislocated his thumb at Fuller
ton State last week and we
didn't want it irritated so we
moved him to DH (designated
hitter) and Eric to first."
The move didn't seem to
bother either and Aldrete's
thumb didn't hamper his per
formance with the bat. He
picked up where he left off in
the first game by doubling his
first two at bats in the nightcap,
driving in the Card's second,
third and fourth runs.
The only problem was that
while the offense was chewing
up the Spartan hurlers, the
Cardinal aces were struggling.
Harris gave up three hits and
three runs in the second and
was pulled with a 4-3 lead after
walking the leadot'f man Scott
Rettig in the third inning.
Gregg Lomnicky then faced
two batters and gave up two
singles, the second driving in
Rettig to tie the game.
John Radtkewas paged from
the bullpen and got out of the
inning, but only after Al Gallo
greeted him with a triple over
Davis to dead center that gave
SJS a b-4 advantage with no one
out. After a strikeout, another
single made it 7-4 going into
the bottom of the third.
Sophomore Eric Pierce came
on in the fourth but served up a
deep fly ball that eluded a leap
ing Chris Britt at the left field

SWING AWAY: Eric Hardgrave exhibited his power hitting
abilities in Stanford's victories over San Jose State Monday
and Stanislaus State yesterday. The Cardinal slugger hit two
home runs against the Spartans Monday, the second of which
was a game-winning grand slam.
