A blond-bearded dynamo aims to bring
Stanford wrestling into the top 10.
Chris Horpel, former Stanford All-
America and first alternate tor the 1976
U.S. Olympic team, is currently head
coach of the wrestling team, here.
It's a crazy sport," he said. "But you
can learn a lot about yourself from it
which is how I like to approach it."
Ihe 31-year-old Horpel became in
volved in coaching wrestling here in 1979
w hen it had temporarily been demoted to
a club sport. In 1980 it regained varsity
status with help from Horpel and Vern
Jones, a former Stanford wrestler who
contributed generously to the program.
While competing here (1971-75), Hor
pel was a 1973 NCAA All-America and a
Pac-8 Conference champion. He then
went on to place fifth in the 1975 Pre-
Olympic World Tournament and to qual
ify as first alternate for the 1976 U.S.
Olympic team.
Horpel began wrestling during the
summer between Bth and 9th grades in
AAU competition in his home town of
Newport Beach, Calif. Hewascoached by
his father, a contractor, who coached
wrestling as a hobby.
That summer he was pinned in 15 out of
16 matches. "I didn't particularly like
wrestling when I first started," he said, "i
was just kind of going out there like a little
goat to be massacred each time."
He said that his father kept telling him it
was good experience. Out of his brothers
and sisters his parents picked him to be
the "star" because he was the most re
ceptive to their suggestions. "Athletically
and academically I was like a pro
grammed robot," he said. "I didn't
realize it at the time, but my parents were
making all the decisions for me. I was very
programmable'."
At the time he also played in tennis
tournaments. "My Mom wanted me to be
a Wimbledon tennis player," he said. But
eventually there was a conflict and wrestl
ing won out.

While on the Junior Varsity wrestling
team his freshman year at Newport Har
bor High School he started winning.
"That made it more enjoyable," he said.
He competed in a few varsity meets that
season but failed to earn enough points
to letter.
"I wanted to haveasymbol of success,"
he said "That varsity jacket was so impor
tant to me. I didn't get it and that made
me hungry."
The following summer he trained every
day. "I've been intense to the point
where nothing was enjoyable. I was just
doing it because that was the way to
win. . . . That kind of intensity is un
healthy sometimes," he said.
Horpel attributes his success in high
school to certain techniques which
"faked out" his opponents. "Because I
was taller, I used my opponent's momen
tum," he said. "It became my style; that's
how I was successful."
He was undefeated his senior year, set
ting a high school record by pinning 34
out of 36 opponents. "I wanted to win as
no one had ever won," he said.
Horpel sees wrestling as a metaphor for
life: all the same principles work both
inside and outside the wrestling arena.
While wrestling, he said, "the mind has
the ability to perceive competition as a
life and death situation, as in battle. . . .
It's a constant test to overcome the fear of
death, the natural desire to quit."
His objective in high school had been
to use wrestling to get a good education.
Because education had always been the
priority, although he trained very hard at
Stanford, wrestling became secondary. "I
wanted to take the blinders off," he said.
"I wanted to do something besides
wrestling."
Horpel designed his own inter
departmental major in art and architec
ture. By the end of his senior year he had
compiled an impressive portfolio and was
ready to apply to graduate schools in ar
chitecture, when he decided to try out for
the Olympics.
"I wanted to train myself to be the ulti

mate killing machine," he said. At that
point in his career he was asking himself,
"Why can't I be the best in the world?"
At the final Olympic trials in Rockport,
New York, Horpel defaulted. "My body
got in the way," he said. "I tried a particu
lar throw and got injured. My doctor
threw in the towel."
The irony in being chosen first alter
nate was that he was injured. However,
he said, if given the opportunity he prob
ably would have been crazy enough to
compete.
Following the 1976 Olympiad in
Montreal, Horpel coached wrestling and
taught industrial arts at both Palo Alto and
Gunn High Schools. He also coached at
UCLA and assisted on three Junior World
wrestling teams which toured to Ger
many, Iran, Finland and Sweden.
He said that if he is not concurrently
teaching, coaching and designing, he
does not feel fullfilled.
"Coaching is really difficult because I
have to live life vicariously. I feel their
effort and frustration, success and de
feat," he said.
Every Friday, instead of a workout, the
team just talks. Horpel said he talks to his
team about everything â€” diet, psychol
ogy, weight-training and personal habits.
"I want them to know me as well as they
possibly can," he said. "I'm interested in
making them achieve their potential and
breaking down the wall between athlete
and coach."
Another high-priority goal for Horpel is
promoting wrestling here and making it
more understandable. "There's some
thing unique about wrestling; nothing is
as intense. That's why it's unfortunate
that no one understands it,"he said.
This year, three years after Horpel
began coaching at Stanford, the approx
imately 20-man team is enjoying a 10-6
winning season.
"I think that I'm a good coach and I'm
going to give myself a certain amount of
time to prove it," Horpel said. "I want to
see if I'm capable of bringing Stanford
into the top 10."
