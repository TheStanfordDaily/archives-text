Robinson to coach Rams
Los Angeles —John Robinson, one of
the most successful college football
coaches in recent years, on Monday
was named head coach of the struggl
ing Los Angeles Rams.
Robinson, 47, had resigned his
coaching post at the University of
Southern California just three months
ago to become the school's vice presi
dent of university relations.
At the time, Robinson said he had no
intention of taking a pro coaching job
in the near future. But, he said Monday,
he was leaving university administrative
life because he simply missed football.
"I've been out of football much too
long — three-and-one-half months,"
he said at a news conference.
Robinson replaces Ray Malavasi, who
was fired by Rams owner Georgia Fron
tiere after last year's 2-7 record in the
strike-shortened season.
