# Parking woes spur new study
## 
### BOB COHN Staff writer 
The persistence of automobile
parking problems on campus has
prompted the University to consider
restriping and modifying existing
parking lots as well as assessing the
feasibility of building new structures,
according to the Planning Office.
"We are currently in the midst of a
whole parking study," said ]udy
Chan, campus planner. She added
that various proposals are under
consideration, but no recom
mendations have yet been offered.
The most obvious problem is a
simple lack of parking spaces. Many
people here find that purchasing a
parking sticker for their car is no
guarantee of finding a place to park
it.
"In the last month it has become
substantially harder to tind a parking
place at the Med Center," said lohn
Sweig, a fourth-year medical stu
dent.
"By taking $20 for a C' sticker,
they're entering into a contract
which says they'll provide a parking
space within a decent distance of
where I'm going," Sweig main
tained. "What the hell am I getting
for my $20?"
