# Parking woes spur new study
## 
### BOB COHN Staff writer 
The persistence of automobile
parking problems on campus has
prompted the University to consider
restriping and modifying existing
parking lots as well as assessing the
feasibility of building new structures,
according to the Planning Office.
"We are currently in the midst of a
whole parking study," said ]udy
Chan, campus planner. She added
that various proposals are under
consideration, but no recom
mendations have yet been offered.
The most obvious problem is a
simple lack of parking spaces. Many
people here find that purchasing a
parking sticker for their car is no
guarantee of finding a place to park
it.
"In the last month it has become
substantially harder to tind a parking
place at the Med Center," said lohn
Sweig, a fourth-year medical stu
dent.
"By taking $20 for a C' sticker,
they're entering into a contract
which says they'll provide a parking
space within a decent distance of
where I'm going," Sweig main
tained. "What the hell am I getting
for my $20?"
According to Police Administrative


Artie Streiber/Daily
University Director of Government Relations Larry Horton, shown here
meeting with then Senator Thomas Eagleton (D-Mo.) last April, is respon
sible for representing the University's interests in the nation's capitol.
Capt. William Wullschleger, stu
dents like Sweig buy a place to park,
but get no guarantee that this spot
will be close to their destination.
Wullschleger insisted that the police
department has not oversold parking
permits; there is a place — some
where on campus — for every car
with a sticker. "There are enough
spaces, but unfortunately it may be
on the other side of campus," he
said.
Physics Prof. Mason Yearian,
chairman of the University commit
tee on parking and transportation,
said, "The total number of parking
spaces available is adequate, but
those close in to the center (of cam
pus) are inadequate." He agreed
there are spaces for everyone, but
said they may be "a fair distance
away."
Yearian said students and faculty
who must park in outlying lots could
ride the Marguerite bus to the center
of campus. Most people do not take
advantage of the free shuttle system,
he said.
Although Sweig claimed that Med
ical Center offenders usually park
"safely and prudently," he com
plained about an "enthiastic ticket
giver" who cites dozens of people
with 'C' stickers who come after 8
a.m. when there are simply no
spaces left."

Wullscleger said he recognizes
the problem — "there's basically not
enough spaces out there" — but
cannot ignore violations. "If a person
parks in a handicapped or a red zone,
they're going to get ticketed," he
warned.
Junior |ohn Harris, a resident of
the Delta Upsilon fraternity house,
expressed sentiments typical of car
owners along the Row. "In the after
noon you have a lot of people park
ing in theßowspots illegally. They get
tickets, and that's fine, but the
people who have stickers have no
legal spots, so we have to park in a
red zone or something."
"I don't think they've oversold
spaces," Harris said, but he, like
Sweig, said he thinks it is unfair that
he is ticketed even though he has
paid for a 'Row' sticker and no legal
parking spaces are available. "It's
kind of a hassle — you rack up $30 to
$40 (in tickets) during the quarter and
that's expensive," he said.
Chan said she sympathized with
these students, but offered no rem
edy. "It's not an uncommon com
plaint, but it's not one for which we
have a ready solution either."
But solutions are being consid
ered. Planners hope restriping of the
Medical Center lot to include "com
pact cars only" stalls will help
maximize the use of space. An ex
panded lot is under construction
near the chemistry buildings, be
tween Serra Street and Campus
Drive, to alleviate crowding there.

One-way traffic flow and narrower
driving lanes, changes implemented
about two years ago in the Tresidder
lot, are also being considered for var
ious spots around campus, accord
ing to Chan and Yearian.
Vearian predicted that expansion
will soon create an insatiable de
mand for parking at the Medical
Center. "In a five-year projection,
they're going to fall way short of
spaces. One aspect of that solution
would be a parking garage," which
has "always been considered, but
(garages) tend to be 10 times more
expensive per car than surface lots,"
he said.
Vearian said that as campus con
struction increases, parking prob
lems multiply proportionally. "There
has been a parking problem for
years, and when the University
builds, they gobble up parking
spaces and exacerbate the prob
lem."
He said he is pleased about the
new University policy which dictates
that adequate parking accompany
every new building, but recognizes
that, in cases like the centrally
located Braun Music Center, this is
not always possible.
The Committee on Parking and
Transportation, composed of equal
numbers of faculty, administrators
and students, meets monthly, and,
according to Yearian "will be coming
forth with a proposal soon."
