EPA head claims 'harassment'
Washington — The head of the Environmental Pro
tection Agency, which is being investigated by a half
dozen congressional committees, said yesterday that
much of the criticism of EPA is motivated by "political
harassment."
Anne Gorsuch told a Senate committee that oppo
nents have refused to acknowledge that the EPA can
do anything right and, instead, have fired barbs to
gain publicity themselves.
Noting the rash of criticism directed at her agency,
she said:
"Nobody can be that wrong all that much all the
time. Personally, I have to finally judge that a great
deal of it is political harassment.

"You know the old rules," she continued. "You
harass, delay, destroy, and finally stop. The only thing
that makes me very upset is that this type of harass
ment probably will impede our progress toward our
goal, which is cleaning up America under super
fund."
The $1.6 billion superfund program to clean up the
nation's dangerous chemical waste dumps is the
target of the congressional investigations into EPA.
Gorsuch's refusal to turn over documents to a con
gressional panel has led to contempt of Congress
chargps against her.
She made her comments during questioning by
Sen. Gary Hart (D-Colo.) about why the agency has
been targeted for so many investigations and drawn
universal scorn from established environmental
groups.
Reagan approves job bill
Washington — President Reagan gave his first pub
lic blessing to a multibillion package of emergency
jobs and recession relief yesterday, as Republicans
moved to protect their party's $4.3 billion program
from Democratic "tinkering."
Reagan conferred with Republican congressional
leaders, who then cautioned that adding provisions
opposed by the president — and more spending —
could sink the entire effort to pass emergency jobs
legislation quickly.
The House Republican leader, Robert Michel of Il
linois, said the GOP program could could provide the
first of "several hundred thousand jobs" by this
spring.
"We must resist build-on, pump-up, Christmas
tree" legislation, said Senate Majority Leader Howard
Baker of Tennessee, who told reporters that depart
ing from what Reagan sees as "socially useful jobs ...
would sabotage the package."
Reagan to run in '84
Washington — The White House has sent out a
strong signal that President Reagan will seek a second
term by notifying Republican senators not to count
on his fund-raising help in 1984 because he is reserv
ing all available political time for his own campaign
ing.
That message was delivered recently by White
House chief of staff James Baker to Sen. Richard Lugar
(R-lnd.) the new chairman of the Republican Sena
torial Campaign Committee, it was learned.
Baker, whose job includes supervision of White
House political strategy, said in an interview that he
decided to clear Reagan's 1984 election calendar after
conferring with deputy chief of staff Michael Deaver
— generally considered to be the aide who is closest
personally to the president — and checking with Rea
gan himself. "I told the president what I was going to
do and he said 'fine,'" Baker said.
Reagan delays arms ban
Washington — President Reagan will stick to his or
iginal proposal for banning all medium-range missiles
from Europe at least until the March 6 West German
elections, and may not offer a compromise even then,
White House officials said yesterday.
European leaders generally favor a compromise as a
first step toward Reagan's objective, and Vice Presi
dent Bush, just back from Western Europe, said Sun
day that Reagan was considering whether to make
some new move in deadlocked arms talks in Geneva.
Yesterday, however, it seemed clear from both
public and private statements by White House of
ficials that the president had decided not to do any
thing, at least until the crucial German vote.
Reagan's reported decision, however, is not neces
sarily a repudiation of the Allied views or of the rec
ommendations Bush made when he returned Thurs
day from a 12-day trip through seven countries. Of
ficials close to Bush said yesterday that he did not urge
the president to make some new proposal now.
Lebanese army controls Beirut
Beirut, Lebanon — After months of haggling and
delays, the Lebanese army moved into Christian
dominated East Beirut yesterday, taking full control of
the Lebanese capital for the first time since the
1975-76 civil war.

The deployment of the troops into the eastern half
of the city, which began in the darkness of early morn
ing, was a victory for President Arnin Gemayel, who
until yesterday had been able to exert his authority
only over the mostly Moslem western part of Beirut.
The remainder of Lebanon is still occupied by Is
raelis, Syrians and the guerrilla fighters of the
Palestine Liberation Organization.
Yesterday's operation here, known as the "Greater
Beirut" plan, came after months of negotiations be
tween the Lebanese government and the leaders of
the Christian Falangist Party's powerful militia.
Reagan cancels cruise missile
Washington — President Reagan has decided to
cancel further production of one of the major new
weapons in the Air Force arsenal, the air-launched
cruise missile, which President Carter said was so
good that the nation could safely do without the pen
etrating B-1 bomber.
Becausc the Air Force says it fears that Soviet air de
fenses are improving and may soon be able to shoot
down today's cruise missiles, Reagan instead intends
to gamble on tomorrow's "Stealth" technology and
build a brand new weapon.
The Air Force is already at work on a Stealth bomb
er. The Stealth technology involves a combination of
techniques to evade enemy radar, including shaping
planes or missiles so that radar beams glide over them.
Reagan's decision, unless reversed by Congress,
will touch off a scramble among three of the nation's
biggest defense contractors and raise fresh questions
about the ability of bombers and subsonic missiies
like the cruise to penetrate upgraded Soviet defenses.
California to issue IOUs
Sacramento —Treasurer jesse Unruh and Con
troller Ken Cory announced yesterday that "all hope
is gone" for California to avoid issuing registered war
rants, or IOUs, starting next Wednesday to tens of
thousands of income taxpayers and businesses.
At a press conference, the two Democrats — Cory,
the man who writes all of the government's checks,
and Unruh, the man who redeems them — warbled a
brief duet: "The party's over. Turn out the lights."
"I think everybody looks at us like (we're) a bunch
of fools. And in fact that's the case," Unruh said in ref
erence to the months-long political stalemate over
the state's $1.5 billion-plus budget deficit that leads to
next week's cash flow crisis.
Cory said warrants would have to be issued "for at
least one day"and maybe longer, depending on how
long Gov. Deukmejian and the Legislature remain
deadlocked on a way to balance the budget. The two
said IOUs would be issued even if agreement could
be reached later in the day on the budget.
Stock prices finish mixed
Stock prices finished mixed Tuesday after the Dow
jones industrial average briefly crossed 1100 for the
second time ever.
The average of 30 blue chips reached 1101 at 2 p.m.
But by the close, it had dropped back to 1093.10,
down 4.00 from Monday.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange totaled
89.04 million shares, against 72.64 million in the pre
vious session.

The House Republican leader, Robert Michel of Il

first of "several hundred thousand jobs" by this

"We must resist build-on, pump-up, Christmas

Baker of Tennessee, who told reporters that depart

Reagan to run in '84
Washington — The White House has sent out a
strong signal that President Reagan will seek a second
term by notifying Republican senators not to count
on his fund-raising help in 1984 because he is reserv
ing all available political time for his own campaign
ing.
That message was delivered recently by White
House chief of staff James Baker to Sen. Richard Lugar
(R-lnd.) the new chairman of the Republican Sena
torial Campaign Committee, it was learned.
Baker, whose job includes supervision of White
House political strategy, said in an interview that he
decided to clear Reagan's 1984 election calendar after
conferring with deputy chief of staff Michael Deaver
— generally considered to be the aide who is closest
personally to the president — and checking with Rea
gan himself. "I told the president what I was going to
do and he said 'fine,'" Baker said.
Reagan delays arms ban
Washington — President Reagan will stick to his or
iginal proposal for banning all medium-range missiles
from Europe at least until the March 6 West German
elections, and may not offer a compromise even then,
White House officials said yesterday.
European leaders generally favor a compromise as a
first step toward Reagan's objective, and Vice Presi
dent Bush, just back from Western Europe, said Sun
day that Reagan was considering whether to make
some new move in deadlocked arms talks in Geneva.
Yesterday, however, it seemed clear from both
public and private statements by White House of
ficials that the president had decided not to do any
thing, at least until the crucial German vote.
Reagan's reported decision, however, is not neces
sarily a repudiation of the Allied views or of the rec
ommendations Bush made when he returned Thurs
day from a 12-day trip through seven countries. Of
ficials close to Bush said yesterday that he did not urge
the president to make some new proposal now.
Lebanese army controls Beirut
Beirut, Lebanon — After months of haggling and
delays, the Lebanese army moved into Christian
dominated East Beirut yesterday, taking full control of
the Lebanese capital for the first time since the
1975-76 civil war.

The deployment of the troops into the eastern half
of the city, which began in the darkness of early morn
ing, was a victory for President Arnin Gemayel, who
until yesterday had been able to exert his authority
only over the mostly Moslem western part of Beirut.
The remainder of Lebanon is still occupied by Is
raelis, Syrians and the guerrilla fighters of the
Palestine Liberation Organization.
Yesterday's operation here, known as the "Greater
Beirut" plan, came after months of negotiations be
tween the Lebanese government and the leaders of
the Christian Falangist Party's powerful militia.
Reagan cancels cruise missile
Washington — President Reagan has decided to
cancel further production of one of the major new
weapons in the Air Force arsenal, the air-launched
cruise missile, which President Carter said was so
good that the nation could safely do without the pen
etrating B-1 bomber.
Becausc the Air Force says it fears that Soviet air de
fenses are improving and may soon be able to shoot
down today's cruise missiles, Reagan instead intends
to gamble on tomorrow's "Stealth" technology and
build a brand new weapon.
The Air Force is already at work on a Stealth bomb
er. The Stealth technology involves a combination of
techniques to evade enemy radar, including shaping
planes or missiles so that radar beams glide over them.
Reagan's decision, unless reversed by Congress,
will touch off a scramble among three of the nation's
biggest defense contractors and raise fresh questions
about the ability of bombers and subsonic missiies
like the cruise to penetrate upgraded Soviet defenses.
California to issue IOUs
Sacramento —Treasurer jesse Unruh and Con
troller Ken Cory announced yesterday that "all hope
is gone" for California to avoid issuing registered war
rants, or IOUs, starting next Wednesday to tens of
thousands of income taxpayers and businesses.
At a press conference, the two Democrats — Cory,
the man who writes all of the government's checks,
and Unruh, the man who redeems them — warbled a
brief duet: "The party's over. Turn out the lights."
"I think everybody looks at us like (we're) a bunch
of fools. And in fact that's the case," Unruh said in ref
erence to the months-long political stalemate over
the state's $1.5 billion-plus budget deficit that leads to
next week's cash flow crisis.
Cory said warrants would have to be issued "for at
least one day"and maybe longer, depending on how
long Gov. Deukmejian and the Legislature remain
deadlocked on a way to balance the budget. The two
said IOUs would be issued even if agreement could
be reached later in the day on the budget.

EPA head claims 'harassment'
Washington — The head of the Environmental Pro
tection Agency, which is being investigated by a half
dozen congressional committees, said yesterday that
much of the criticism of EPA is motivated by "political
harassment."
Anne Gorsuch told a Senate committee that oppo
nents have refused to acknowledge that the EPA can
do anything right and, instead, have fired barbs to
gain publicity themselves.
Noting the rash of criticism directed at her agency,
she said:
"Nobody can be that wrong all that much all the
time. Personally, I have to finally judge that a great
deal of it is political harassment.

"You know the old rules," she continued. "You
harass, delay, destroy, and finally stop. The only thing
that makes me very upset is that this type of harass
ment probably will impede our progress toward our
goal, which is cleaning up America under super
fund."
The $1.6 billion superfund program to clean up the
nation's dangerous chemical waste dumps is the
target of the congressional investigations into EPA.
Gorsuch's refusal to turn over documents to a con
gressional panel has led to contempt of Congress
chargps against her.
She made her comments during questioning by
Sen. Gary Hart (D-Colo.) about why the agency has
been targeted for so many investigations and drawn
universal scorn from established environmental
groups.
Reagan approves job bill
Washington — President Reagan gave his first pub
lic blessing to a multibillion package of emergency
jobs and recession relief yesterday, as Republicans
moved to protect their party's $4.3 billion program
from Democratic "tinkering."
Reagan conferred with Republican congressional
leaders, who then cautioned that adding provisions
opposed by the president — and more spending —
could sink the entire effort to pass emergency jobs
legislation quickly.
The House Republican leader, Robert Michel of Il
linois, said the GOP program could could provide the
first of "several hundred thousand jobs" by this
