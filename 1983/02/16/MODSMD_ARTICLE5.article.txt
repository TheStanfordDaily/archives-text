# University lobbies in D.C. to justify cost recovery rates
## 
### Last in a series By DOUGLAS JEHL Senior staff writer 
The root of the indirect cost recovery rate dilemma,
some say, lies not here at the University, but 3000 miles
away in Washington, D.C.
It is in Washington that politicians control the purse
strings for federal research funding eventually chan
neled to Stanford. As overhead recovery rates have in
creased in recent years, some have been more an
tagonistic to universities, and called for the rates to be
contained.
In Washington as well are the federal agencies that
directly provide that funding — some $136 million, 95
percent of the University's research volume. Here too,
especially within financially strapped agencies, officials
have called for cutbacks in overhead payments to uni
versities.
This political climate has the University concerned. As
much as anything else, it has convinced the University to
decide against increasing its overhead recovery rate.
Next year, the rate will remain at an artificially low 69
percent — a rate too low to recover from the govern
ment all costs associated with research.
"On a national level," University President Donald
Kennedy told the Academic Council two weeks ago,
"further increases in rates are likely to fuel the claim,
already made in some quarters, that indirect costs have
risen to unacceptable levels and must be contained."
In that address, Kennedy outlined plans for making
budget cuts and changing cost-accounting procedures
here to help keep the overhead recovery rate at 69 per
cent. Plans are being made to investigate and initiate
these new measures this spring.
Away from Stanford, Kennedy said, "... we hope and
plan to work as hard as we can to retain the concept of
partnership with the federal government in research,

and to gain lull understanding about the reality of indi
rect costs and about the inevitability of the rising rate."
This notion is nothing new for Larry Horton or Robert
Rosenzweig. It's what they've been doing for years.
Horton, the director of government relations, and
Rosenzweig, the former vice president for public affairs
who is now president of the American Association of
Universities, are the two persons the University most
relies on to present and argue its case in Washington.
Despite the fact that they now have different employers,
they and representatives from other schools work as a
team, for all are fighting for issues important to all
American universities.
"There's no magic to it," Horton said. "It's simply

going down and explaining the issue to the people whe:
are making the derisions.
"We try to explain our position with as much clarity
accuracy and forthrightness and we can," he said.
Their position, according to Rosenzweig, is that "fun
damentally, you can't shortchange the institutions thai
make quality science possible without, sometime in the
future, diminishing the quality of research."

The federal agency whose actions most alarm the Uni
versity is the National Institute of Health. Last year, the
financially strapped NIH proposed to cut overhead
payments by a flat 10 percent rate. Under this plan, the
University would have been paid 62.1 percent of its
direct costs rather than the 69 percent dictated by the
overhead recovery rate.
Due to lobbying efforts by Kennedy, Rosenzweig,
Horton and others, that proposal was blocked in Con
gress.
But the NIH is again making moves toward cutting
back on its overhead payments to universities — al
though more discreetly than before. An NIH budget
proposal for the coming fiscal year submitted to the
House of Representatives contains a shortfall of $72 mil
lion — 10 percent of its budget. And an accompanying
draft of a justification for the budget makes clear that the
NIH tends to make this up in the area of indirect costs.
"It is essential that this growth of indirect costs be
arrested in order to prevent a serious erosion of funds
for the direct costs of doing biomedical research," the
report says."The 1984 request assumes a total indirect
cost reduction of about $72 million."
And so once again it is on the NIH that the University

and the AAU are focusing their lobbying efforts. What is
worrisome about NIH efforts to avoid paying all over
head, according to Horton, is that if it is successful,
other agencies would follow.
Both pointed out that such action would violate the
"fundamental principle" made clear in federal docu
ment OMB A-21, which sets forth the formulas univer
sities must use to determine which indirect costs they
are entitled to recover. T hat principle is that government
agencies must reimburse universities for all costs as
sociated with research.
What the University seeks, Horton said, is a fair un
derstanding among agencies of those A-21 rules — and
that they be followed.
Rosenzweig said the pressure in the federal agencies
to disregard such rules comes not so much from opposi
tion to that principle but for budgetary reasons. "The
tendency is to think that indirect costs are soft money —
that you can cut that back without compromising the
quality of research."
That's true, Rosenzweig said — but only in the short
run. "If the NIH cuts back, as they threaten to do, no one
will notice this year. The research would be fine for a
while. But in a while, the quality of research will begin to
suffer too, because the institutional support which
makes research possible will begin to deteriorate.
"It's a seductive, tempting, but inevitably self
defeating line of argument," he said.

here to help keep the overhead recovery rate at 69 per
cent. Plans are being made to investigate and initiate
these new measures this spring.
Away from Stanford, Kennedy said, "... we hope and
plan to work as hard as we can to retain the concept of
partnership with the federal government in research,

and to gain lull understanding about the reality of indi
rect costs and about the inevitability of the rising rate."
This notion is nothing new for Larry Horton or Robert
Rosenzweig. It's what they've been doing for years.
Horton, the director of government relations, and
Rosenzweig, the former vice president for public affairs
who is now president of the American Association of
Universities, are the two persons the University most
relies on to present and argue its case in Washington.
Despite the fact that they now have different employers,
they and representatives from other schools work as a
team, for all are fighting for issues important to all
American universities.
"There's no magic to it," Horton said. "It's simply

going down and explaining the issue to the people whe:
are making the derisions.
"We try to explain our position with as much clarity
accuracy and forthrightness and we can," he said.
Their position, according to Rosenzweig, is that "fun
damentally, you can't shortchange the institutions thai
make quality science possible without, sometime in the
future, diminishing the quality of research."

The federal agency whose actions most alarm the Uni
versity is the National Institute of Health. Last year, the
financially strapped NIH proposed to cut overhead
payments by a flat 10 percent rate. Under this plan, the
University would have been paid 62.1 percent of its
direct costs rather than the 69 percent dictated by the
overhead recovery rate.
Due to lobbying efforts by Kennedy, Rosenzweig,
Horton and others, that proposal was blocked in Con
gress.
But the NIH is again making moves toward cutting
back on its overhead payments to universities — al
though more discreetly than before. An NIH budget
proposal for the coming fiscal year submitted to the
House of Representatives contains a shortfall of $72 mil
lion — 10 percent of its budget. And an accompanying
draft of a justification for the budget makes clear that the
NIH tends to make this up in the area of indirect costs.
"It is essential that this growth of indirect costs be
arrested in order to prevent a serious erosion of funds
for the direct costs of doing biomedical research," the
report says."The 1984 request assumes a total indirect
cost reduction of about $72 million."
And so once again it is on the NIH that the University

and the AAU are focusing their lobbying efforts. What is
worrisome about NIH efforts to avoid paying all over
head, according to Horton, is that if it is successful,
other agencies would follow.
Both pointed out that such action would violate the
"fundamental principle" made clear in federal docu
ment OMB A-21, which sets forth the formulas univer
sities must use to determine which indirect costs they
are entitled to recover. T hat principle is that government
agencies must reimburse universities for all costs as
sociated with research.
What the University seeks, Horton said, is a fair un
derstanding among agencies of those A-21 rules — and
that they be followed.
Rosenzweig said the pressure in the federal agencies
to disregard such rules comes not so much from opposi
tion to that principle but for budgetary reasons. "The
tendency is to think that indirect costs are soft money —
that you can cut that back without compromising the
quality of research."
That's true, Rosenzweig said — but only in the short
run. "If the NIH cuts back, as they threaten to do, no one
will notice this year. The research would be fine for a
while. But in a while, the quality of research will begin to
suffer too, because the institutional support which
makes research possible will begin to deteriorate.
"It's a seductive, tempting, but inevitably self
defeating line of argument," he said.
The root of the indirect cost recovery rate dilemma,
some say, lies not here at the University, but 3000 miles
away in Washington, D.C.
It is in Washington that politicians control the purse
strings for federal research funding eventually chan
neled to Stanford. As overhead recovery rates have in
creased in recent years, some have been more an
tagonistic to universities, and called for the rates to be
contained.
In Washington as well are the federal agencies that
directly provide that funding — some $136 million, 95
percent of the University's research volume. Here too,
especially within financially strapped agencies, officials
have called for cutbacks in overhead payments to uni
versities.
This political climate has the University concerned. As
much as anything else, it has convinced the University to
decide against increasing its overhead recovery rate.
Next year, the rate will remain at an artificially low 69
percent — a rate too low to recover from the govern
ment all costs associated with research.
"On a national level," University President Donald
Kennedy told the Academic Council two weeks ago,
"further increases in rates are likely to fuel the claim,
already made in some quarters, that indirect costs have
risen to unacceptable levels and must be contained."
In that address, Kennedy outlined plans for making
budget cuts and changing cost-accounting procedures
here to help keep the overhead recovery rate at 69 per
