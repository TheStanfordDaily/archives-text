# Diplomat analyzes Soviet policies

### TROY EID 
The Soviet Union's policies in Latin
America are shifting from an ideolog
ical to a pragmatic approach, accord
ing to William Luers, former U.S.
ambassador to Venezuela.
"The Soviets have not had a cohe
rent strategy in Latin America ever,"
Luers said. "I think their involvement
there is minimal."
Luers, a career member of the
Foreign Service and currently direc t
or's visitor at Princeton's Institute tor
Advanced Study, addressed an audi
ence of about 40 at the Meyer Forum
Room yesterday.
Luers questioned America's un
derstanding of the Soviet-Latin

American relationship. "This country
is obsessed with the Soviet Union
without knowing anything about it,"
he said. The attitude toward Latin
America, in contrast, "has been one
of indifference."
Luers, who is writing a book on
Soviet influence in Latin America,
emphasized the Soviet Union's ex
panding interest in the Third World
as it affects the United States. Mos
cow's strategies in the Western
Hemisphere, luers said, "are in
creasingly less concerned with
Communist ideology." He noted a
decreasing concern with ideological
issues within the Soviet Union and
called Party Chief Yuri Andropov the

"least ideological" of all previous
Soviet leaders.
The Soviet Union's diminishing
concern with ideological problems,
Luers contended, is being replaced
by an expanded interest in the mili
tary. "The military," he claimed, "is
the most efficient element in Soviet
society."
Unable to compete economically
with the United States, the Soviets,
according to Luers, have c i
promised doctrine in favor of prag
matism. Moreover, the military es
tablishment in many Central and
South American countries acts as a
"stabilizing element." Luefs said the
Soviets are learning to deal with mili
tary leaders "just as the United States
has done in the past."
After outlining a brief history of
Soviet involvement in Latin America,
Luers proposed several formulas for
U.S. foreign policy. Luers, who
served in both the Carter and Reagan

administrations, expressed a need
for arms reduction negotiations.
"The major mistake of the past two
administrations," he asserted, was
allowing arms control to be affected
by Third World issues. "There is no
higher priority," Luers declared,
"than to proceed with the Soviets on
arms control agreements."
"Soviet arms reduction plans are
never acceptable," he said. "We
must always be the initiators."

The need for caution in U.S. di
plomacy, especially in light of past
and present developments
worldwide, was expressed through
out Luer's speech. America's treat
ment of countries outside of NATO is
progressing, according to Luers, "in
a disturbing way . . . which might put
us in a position we cannot afford."
The program was sponsored by
Bolivar House and the International
