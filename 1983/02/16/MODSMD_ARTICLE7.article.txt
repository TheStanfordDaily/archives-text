## Academic 'publish or perish' syndrome on the rise 
### LISA CARLOS 
The publish or perish phenomena is an
increasing concern of professors. 'An
unspoken level of expectation exists
about the quality of research published
not just the quantity. Publishing in
creases a person's respect, gives him a
raise or an offer from another univer
sity. It is these elements of scholarly
communication by which people rank
each other/

The average student here
faces tremendous pressure to
maintain his scholarly standing
— and so does the average pro
fessor. The dual duties inher
ent in the professor's profes
sion are teaching and research.
However, both are not always
equally weighted. The re
searching publishing side ap
pears to include promotional
and financial rewards accord
ing to some academics here.
I.C. Bell, associate director
and editor of the Stanford Uni
versity Press, said, "There has
been no real significant change
in publication output in the
past 10-15 years." Vet the "pub

lish or perish" phenomena is
an increasing concern of pro
fessors.
"An unspoken level of ex
pectation," Bell said, exists
about the quality of research
published, not just the quan
tity. "Publishing increases a
person's respect, gives him a
raise or an offer from another
university. It is these elements
of scholarly communication by
which people rank each
other," according to Bell.
Law Prof. John Kaplan, said
that in pursuing a tenured posi
tion "a professor must show a
significant contribution to
knowledge and the way to do
that is to write it down."

Mobilization in and out of
the University institution is
partially contingent upon the
publication of research which
increases the competition to
print among faculty. "Experi
ence shows that if you don't
publish no other comparable
school is interested. The seri
ous effect is that a person is
stuck,' Kaplan said.
The emphasis placed on
printed accomplishments over
teaching abilities is due to the
visible financial returns from
alumni as well as the growing
number of freshman applic
ants each year.
"The University gets its repu
tation and money because of
research productivity of fac
ulty. The money rolls in when
they see the number of Nobel
Prize winners we have," said
Political Science Prof. Hubert
Marshall.
Bell said that on the whole
the pressure to publish makes
for a better faculty and better
teaching. But Marshall said,
"You are told that in order to
be a good teacher you must be
a good researcher. That is ab
surd."
The University should add a
third qualification to tenure
calculations. In addition to
teaching and research, a per
son's character, his ability to
inspire students and other
humanitarian accomplish
ments should be part of his
recommendation for tenure,
according to Marshall.
In the past Marshall recalls
two professors whose books
were not considered valid pub
lications in their field of study
when put up for tenure. One

book dealt with a professor's
identity crisis, another with the
death of his two children. Yet
they were ignored as irrelevant
by the tenure Appointments
and Promotions Committee,
according to Marshall.
"If a person is the greatest
teacher, nobody knows that,"
Marshall said. The teaching
awards (Gore and Dinklespiel)
given at the end of the year
never guarantee a professor
tenure. Although the Univer
sity has teacher-student evalu
ations, Marshall has not recog
nized any major change in the
emphasis attached to research
over teaching.
Some professors do not fee!
the pressure to publish re
search for promotion yet they
publish anyway. "I'm not re
quired to research," said Gil
bert Masters, associate dean
and professor of the School of
Engineering. As an adjunct
professor, he publishes when
there is a lack of sufficient ma
terial available for his courses.
For example, he wrote Other
Homes and More Garbage be
cause "it is unique — no other
material around like it."
Perhaps the conflict caused
by the competing demands be
tween teaching, research and
publishing does not have an
easy answer. The University
currently lacks a system that
recognizes the teaching merits
of professors. Vet Marshall said
that when a person stands up
in front of a lecture hall filled
with students and afterwards is
given a note or a comment
lauding his lecture, he can't
help but try to do a better job
next time.

equally weighted. The re
searching publishing side ap
pears to include promotional
and financial rewards accord
ing to some academics here.
I.C. Bell, associate director
and editor of the Stanford Uni
versity Press, said, "There has
been no real significant change
in publication output in the
past 10-15 years." Vet the "pub

lish or perish" phenomena is
an increasing concern of pro
fessors.
"An unspoken level of ex
pectation," Bell said, exists
about the quality of research
published, not just the quan
tity. "Publishing increases a
person's respect, gives him a
raise or an offer from another
university. It is these elements
of scholarly communication by
which people rank each
other," according to Bell.
Law Prof. John Kaplan, said
that in pursuing a tenured posi
tion "a professor must show a
significant contribution to
knowledge and the way to do
that is to write it down."

Mobilization in and out of
the University institution is
partially contingent upon the
publication of research which
increases the competition to
print among faculty. "Experi
ence shows that if you don't
publish no other comparable
school is interested. The seri
ous effect is that a person is
stuck,' Kaplan said.
The emphasis placed on
printed accomplishments over
teaching abilities is due to the
visible financial returns from
alumni as well as the growing
number of freshman applic
ants each year.
"The University gets its repu
tation and money because of
research productivity of fac
ulty. The money rolls in when
they see the number of Nobel
Prize winners we have," said
Political Science Prof. Hubert
Marshall.
Bell said that on the whole
the pressure to publish makes
for a better faculty and better
teaching. But Marshall said,
"You are told that in order to
be a good teacher you must be
a good researcher. That is ab
surd."
The University should add a
third qualification to tenure
calculations. In addition to
teaching and research, a per
son's character, his ability to
inspire students and other
humanitarian accomplish
ments should be part of his
recommendation for tenure,
according to Marshall.
In the past Marshall recalls
two professors whose books
were not considered valid pub
lications in their field of study
when put up for tenure. One

book dealt with a professor's
identity crisis, another with the
death of his two children. Yet
they were ignored as irrelevant
by the tenure Appointments
and Promotions Committee,
according to Marshall.
"If a person is the greatest
teacher, nobody knows that,"
Marshall said. The teaching
awards (Gore and Dinklespiel)
given at the end of the year
never guarantee a professor
tenure. Although the Univer
sity has teacher-student evalu
ations, Marshall has not recog
nized any major change in the
emphasis attached to research
over teaching.
Some professors do not fee!
the pressure to publish re
search for promotion yet they
publish anyway. "I'm not re
quired to research," said Gil
bert Masters, associate dean
and professor of the School of
Engineering. As an adjunct
professor, he publishes when
there is a lack of sufficient ma
terial available for his courses.
For example, he wrote Other
Homes and More Garbage be
cause "it is unique — no other
material around like it."
Perhaps the conflict caused
by the competing demands be
tween teaching, research and
publishing does not have an
easy answer. The University
currently lacks a system that
recognizes the teaching merits
of professors. Vet Marshall said
that when a person stands up
in front of a lecture hall filled
with students and afterwards is
given a note or a comment
lauding his lecture, he can't
help but try to do a better job
next time.
