# Midterms and diapers
## Parents here face conflicts 
### ELIZABETH CHEATHAM 
The concerns of graduate
students, especially married
graduate students with chil
dren, are largely unknown to
most undergraduates. How
ever, these student-parents
form a large part of the student
population on campus.
For these student-parents
juggling work, studies and
diapers at the same time can be
quite difficult. Luckily, with the
cooperation of other parents
and many University-based
programs, these students can
manage happy, if somewhat
hectic, lives.
More than 3000 people —
about 30 percent of whom are
under 18 — are living in Escon
dido Village, according to
Chris Griffith, an officer assis
tant at Escondido Village. In
most of these family situations,
the husband is working toward
a graduate degree, while the
wife works, either full or part- '
time. '
The parents may either take E
turns caring for the children or fi
may engage in a variety of day
care programs. Babysitters are v
abundant in Escondido Village 112(
but tend to be too expensive c
for long-term arrangements, r
Therefore, many mothers have s
formed co-operatives. These s
"co-ops," which operate on c
the theory of trading points A
(each participant contributing c
an equal amount of time caring ii
for all the other's children) v
provide an excellent option for c
those mothers who work part- S
time. E
But for those women who 112
work full-time, and cannot r
contribute their own time to
the system, co-ops are not a c
viable solution. For these g
families, a day care center, the t
Village Infant Program and F
several nursery schools in the c
area are available. Two nursery L
schools on campus, Bing and r

Escondido, are also an option
for working mothers.
The University itself pro
vides many sources of support
for these families. An example
of such support is a system of
neighborhood coordinators
similar to graduate RAs. One
such neighborhood coor
dinator is Joao Azevedo.
Azevedo is a Portuguese citizen
currently working on his Ph.D.
in civil engineering. His wife,
who completed her master's
degree in education here last
September, works part-time at
Bing Nursery School, and their
four year-old daughter is en
rolled at a local nursery school.
As neighborhood coor
dinator, Azevedo works on
getting common ideas and ac
tivities going in his neighbor
hood, as well as promoting
cooperation within the group.
Unlike some of the larger
neighborhoods, his didn't

seem to want a structured
neighborhood co-op. How
ever, all the neighbors interact
and are very supportive of each
other. "If I have to go out at
night I'll ask my neighbor to
care for my child," he said.
"Unfortunately," said
Azevedo, "I know a lot of par
ents who are not going to
school because of their chil
dren — they can't pay tuition
for both themselves and their
children." Most foreign stu
dents like himself have tuition
grants from their home coun
tries, but often their income is
not enough for two tuitions.
About 40 percent of all Es
condido residents are foreig
ners. "The different religious
and political backgrounds of
the people here have led me to
many interesting discussions.
And now I have friends all
around the world," Azevedo

said. Although foreigners tend
to stay within their own group,
these cultural barriers are
often lifted because of the
children. "With children it's
much easier to get in contact
with others. We're almost
forced to interact with
neighbors," Azevedo said.
How does he feel about
bringing children up on cam
pus? "It's a good place for rais
ing children. There are many
fenced in playgrounds be
tween the courts where we can
let the children run free and
knowthat they will be safe," he
said.
Many groups offer various
activities to parents and chil
dren alike. Bechtel Interna
tional Center offers many pro
grams for foreign students, the
Village Center offers both
youth and adult classes and the
Trading Post rents baby items
at great discounts.
