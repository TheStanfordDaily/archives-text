# Paul petitions for explanations
## Unanimous tenure denial dismays assistant professor 
### BOB DUGONI 
Asst Prof. Diana Paul has been denied tenure
by a senior faculty group in the Religious Studies
Department. The unanimous decision of the
five-member body was made February 4 after the
group reviewed student evaluations of Paul's
teaching and evaluations from 12 to Ir>1 r > ot the
world's foremost authorities in her field of re
search.
Paul said she learned of the decision from Re
ligious Studies Chairman Van Harvey the dav
after it was made.
Paul said she has petitioned the Provost s of
fice for a summary of the reasons for her denial.
If she does not find the reasons "comprehensive
and coherent'' she said she will then decide
whether or riot to file a grievance with the deans
of the School of Humanities and Sciences.
Because tenure decisions are confidential,
Paul said she was not aware of the official reasons
for the denial, but added, "I think there were
political considerations perhaps, procedural ir
regularities and questions of how thorough the
evaluation was."
She was also critical of the procedure, saying it
was like a student receiving an 'F on a test and
then not being able to find out why.
Paul's tenure was denied at one of the first
step, in the process. She said she felt the senior
faculty committee did not recommend her case
to the Committee on Advancement and Promo

tions because the bottom line is the department
felt the advancement and placement committee
would not feel I'm a Pulitzer Prize winner and
would not get tenure, so they decided to er.d the
evaluation at the department level."
Paul said such a decision makes a tenure can
didate 'look like not a verv strong candidate and
severely limits the requests of the individual.
Harvey said Stanford, like other leading
schools in the nation, maintains rigid require
ments for a professor seeking tenure. He said i f
the outside recommendations do not evaluate a
person as one of the top two or three individuals
in the world for that field it is likely they will not
be recommended.
"The University is holding up these very dif
ficult standards because it wants to be the first in
the country. For someone to establish them
selves in five years to meet these criteria is very,
very difficult," he said. "But if someone doesn't
get tenure it doesn't mean they're bad."
William Chace, associate dean of Humanities
and Sciences agreed with Harvey. He said the
University tenure criteria is the same as the
criteria for the Ivy league universities. UC-
BerLeley and University of Chicago
"We are pledged io students, trustees and
alumni to provide excellent education at Stan
ford,'' he said "We do have high criteria It
you're coming to Stantoru you re corning to a
world class place. But let's not forget that people

do get tenure at Stanford."
Chase said nine or IO professors in the School
ot Humanities arid iences were given tenure at
Stanford."
Paul has been at Stanford for eight years and is
currently a resident fellow at Soto house in Wil
bur. Her area of research is Indian and C hinese
Buddhism for which she has authored two
books. She took a leave of absence last year after
receiving a grant from the National Endowment
for the Humanities to author her second book,
Philosophy of Mind in Sixth ( entuiy China.
She sa»d omp of the possible shortcomings if
the tenure process and a serious concern of die
candidates is that department members might
not get »he proper people to evaluate thew work,

Harvey said the choice of referees
— the 10 to 12 experts who initially
judge the candidates' work — is not
taken lightly, and that the depart
ment took two houb to select the
group for Paul.
"Referees have to be spread prop
ortionately to a person's individual
research. They are the best in the
world, no question."
A tenure candidate is allowed to
choose three evaluators. However,
Paul said she did not know if any of
the three she chose were actually
picked by the department.
Last year, History Prof. Estelle
Freed man was denied tenure and has
petitioned the School of Humanities
and Sciences for reconsideration.
Paul said she did not know whether
or not the fact that she is a woman
had anything to do with the decision.
However, she did say that the Uni

versity policy with regard to the
criteria for the promotion and tenure
of women requires closer scrutiny.
"We had an equally painful case
last year and it was a male and we
hired a female to replace him. It can't
be that (discrimination) in this de
partment. That's so far from our
minds," Harvey said.
According to the rules of the
American Association of University
Professors, a professor cannot work
at a university for more than six years
without being granted tenure
Professors denied tenure receive a
one-year grace period to allow them
time to find another job. Paul, how
ever was not optimistic about the
situation.
"In today's job market it is very
difficult to continue in academia. For
many people denied tenure it means
a career switch. I have not come to
that decision yet. I am taking things
slowly. If I have to leave Stanford, it is
a last resort."

She was also critical of the procedure, saying it
was like a student receiving an 'F on a test and
then not being able to find out why.

faculty committee did not recommend her case

would not feel I'm a Pulitzer Prize winner and
would not get tenure, so they decided to er.d the
evaluation at the department level."
Paul said such a decision makes a tenure can
didate 'look like not a verv strong candidate and
severely limits the requests of the individual.
Harvey said Stanford, like other leading
schools in the nation, maintains rigid require
ments for a professor seeking tenure. He said i f
the outside recommendations do not evaluate a
person as one of the top two or three individuals
in the world for that field it is likely they will not
be recommended.
"The University is holding up these very dif
ficult standards because it wants to be the first in
the country. For someone to establish them
selves in five years to meet these criteria is very,
very difficult," he said. "But if someone doesn't
get tenure it doesn't mean they're bad."
William Chace, associate dean of Humanities
and Sciences agreed with Harvey. He said the
University tenure criteria is the same as the
criteria for the Ivy league universities. UC-
BerLeley and University of Chicago
"We are pledged io students, trustees and
alumni to provide excellent education at Stan

you're coming to Stantoru you re corning to a

do get tenure at Stanford."
Chase said nine or IO professors in the School
ot Humanities arid iences were given tenure at
Stanford."
Paul has been at Stanford for eight years and is
currently a resident fellow at Soto house in Wil

Harvey said the choice of referees
— the 10 to 12 experts who initially
judge the candidates' work — is not
taken lightly, and that the depart
ment took two houb to select the
group for Paul.
"Referees have to be spread prop
ortionately to a person's individual
research. They are the best in the
world, no question."
A tenure candidate is allowed to
choose three evaluators. However,
Paul said she did not know if any of
the three she chose were actually
picked by the department.
Last year, History Prof. Estelle
Freed man was denied tenure and has
petitioned the School of Humanities
and Sciences for reconsideration.
Paul said she did not know whether
or not the fact that she is a woman
had anything to do with the decision.
However, she did say that the Uni

versity policy with regard to the
criteria for the promotion and tenure
of women requires closer scrutiny.
"We had an equally painful case
last year and it was a male and we
hired a female to replace him. It can't
be that (discrimination) in this de
partment. That's so far from our
minds," Harvey said.
According to the rules of the
American Association of University
Professors, a professor cannot work
at a university for more than six years
without being granted tenure
Professors denied tenure receive a
one-year grace period to allow them
time to find another job. Paul, how
ever was not optimistic about the
situation.
"In today's job market it is very
difficult to continue in academia. For
many people denied tenure it means
a career switch. I have not come to
that decision yet. I am taking things
slowly. If I have to leave Stanford, it is
a last resort."
Asst Prof. Diana Paul has been denied tenure
by a senior faculty group in the Religious Studies
Department. The unanimous decision of the
five-member body was made February 4 after the
group reviewed student evaluations of Paul's
teaching and evaluations from 12 to Ir>1 r > ot the
world's foremost authorities in her field of re
search.
Paul said she learned of the decision from Re
ligious Studies Chairman Van Harvey the dav
after it was made.
Paul said she has petitioned the Provost s of
fice for a summary of the reasons for her denial.
If she does not find the reasons "comprehensive
and coherent'' she said she will then decide
whether or riot to file a grievance with the deans
of the School of Humanities and Sciences.
Because tenure decisions are confidential,
Paul said she was not aware of the official reasons
for the denial, but added, "I think there were
political considerations perhaps, procedural ir
regularities and questions of how thorough the
evaluation was."
She was also critical of the procedure, saying it
was like a student receiving an 'F on a test and
then not being able to find out why.
