# White House: EPA "out of control"

Compiled from news reports and wire services
As six House subcommittees and one Senate committee began
investigating the snowballing controversy at the Environmental
Protection Agency, administration officials said that tPA Adminis
trator Anne Gorsuch is on increasingly shaky ground at the White
House.
' There is a large group now at the White House that believes
this latest mess is too much. We've got to clean house over
there," one administration official close to the (misuch matter
said. "We've got a problem, a real problem.
At the same time White House chiet ot staff lames Baker
called Rep. Elliott Levitas, D-Ca. chairman of a House sub
committee investigating the EPA, to notify him that the administ
ration plans to propose a compromise to settle the congressional
contempt case against Gorsuch for tier refusal to turn over sub
poenaed documents about EPA s hazardous waste cleanup ef
forts.
Meanwhile, Congressional leaders suggested that the ad
ministration no longer can assert its c laim of executive privilege
to withhold subpoenaed documents on hazardous waste cleanup
— the heart of the historic contempt-ot-Congress case against
Gorsuch — because President Reagan has not seen the docu
ments.
Levitas,chairman of the House Public Works andTransportation
oversight committee, which brought the contempt citation
against Gorsuch, said the administration's case is "collapsing."
Eie cited a 1977 Supreme Court ruling saying that executive
privilege applies "at most to items with which the president was
personally familiar."
White House counsel Ered Fielding said last Wednesday that
his office is "looking at the dimensions of all the issues" of the
EPA affair, including Rita Lavelle's stormy departure from the
agencv and congressional accusations of conflicts of interest and
possible perjury by Lavelle and others in connection with a wide
range of EPA actions.
Fielding said the administration believes it has met the re
quire,v.erts of the :')"7court rt.iing though Reagan has s<tcr
only an index of the dozens of documents Gorsuch has refused to
deliver for a House inquiry into the EPA's handling of the Super
fund.
After a review of the subpoenaed documents by the EPA, Jus
tice Department and White House Officials, Fielding said, Gor
such was ordered to keep secret those the administration
claimed could be used to jeopardize cases against polluters.
Baker's call to Levitas marked his first entry into efforts to
compromise with the House on the contempt dispute. Other
officials had proposed allowing Congress to see some disputed
documents, but Levitas, citing growing concern about the Super
fund, said, "Anything short of full access (to the documents) is
unacceptable." He said Baker told him to expect the newest
proposal Friday.
Fielding said the president directed that any documents show
ing wrongdoing should not be withheld, but might be referred to
law enforcement agencies instead. Gorsuch said last week that
she knew of no such documents.
