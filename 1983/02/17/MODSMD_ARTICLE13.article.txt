# Doctors review transplant case
## 
### LISA LYNCH Staff writer 
The Stanford Med Center is currently considering 11-
year-old Sharon Stohler of Anderson, Indiana as a heart
transplant candidate, which would make her the Med
Center's youngest transplant patient ever.
According to her father, David Stohler, Sharon's physi
cian contacted the Med Center in early January request
ing consideration of her case. She then underwent a
pre-evaluation at Riley Hospital in Indiana to determine
whether she was qualified to be considered by the Stan
ford transplant team. Physicians at the Med Center re
ceived the results on Monday morning, and are still
evaluating them.
The young Stohler, who is confined to a wheelchair,
was discovered last November to be suffering from car
diomyopathy, a disease that enlarges the heart muscles.
Doctors in Anderson estimated that her heart had been
enlarged to "the size of two grapefruits."
II Stohler is accepted here, she will be the youngest
transplant patient at Stanford but not the first pre
teenager. Mike Good kind, Med Center spokesman, said
several 12- to 14-year-olds have received transplants
here, the most recent being 14-year-old Daryn Harkey in
April 1982.
Goodkind said the Center screens children very care
fully. "Generally, we have several problems with young
children. First of all, a child grows quite rapidly, and you
wind up with a body growing around a heart that's going
to stay the same size. Also, you have to find a suitable
donor, which in many cases has to be a child because of
the size of the chest cavity," he said.
According to Goodkind, the majority of heart trans
plants in children are necessitated by cardiomyopathy.
The advantage these children have is their chest cavity
has been so enlarged by their diseased heart that they

can often be matched with an adult donor.
"For example, Daryn was transplanted with a heart
from a 30-year-old donor," he said.
Other problems with younger transplant patients in
clude what Goodkind described as a "maturity factor."
He explained, "You've got to understand that these pa
tients have to follow a lifetime program of care. They
have to understand this and understand the operation."
Pediatric Cardiologist David Baum, a member of the
team that will decide whether Stohler will be accepted,
also stressed that children are chosen carefully. "Sharon
is a child and this means there are special qualifica
tions," he said. "We are very stringent about how we
choose children."
Baum said he had discussed the case with Stohler's
physician, but that more medical information is needed
before her case will be discussed. "We're still in the
preliminary stages of our decision," he said.
Stohler's father seemed very optimistic that Sharon
would receive the transplant. "I think that Stanford
could be calling at any time," he said. "Her health is in
good condition other than her heart problem, and she's
a perfect candidate. We've begun to study the financial
end of the operation, I've contacted Indiana State
Medicaid to confirm whether they will pay for the trans
plant."
He said he had kept Sharon informed of the entire
decision-making process. "Sharon knows everything,"
he said. "She's taking the whole thing a lot better than I
think I would."
Stohler said he did not believe Sharon's age would
pose a problem "She understands everything just as
well as you or I would. If you met her personally, you
would think she was more like a 14-year-old."
