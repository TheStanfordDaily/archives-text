## Education professors praise Reagan's math/science plan 
### RICK BOECK 
President Reagan's $78 million
plan to reduce shortages of high
school math and science teac hers
drew qualified support trom several
professors here. Ihe President's
proposed scholarships and other in
centives, the professors said, would
attract new teac hers to the secondary
schools, but additional money is
needed to keep them there.
"Just hearing that there are jobs
available will attract some people to
the schools," Myron Atkins, dean of
the School of Education said. "And
Reagan's plan will initially bring in
the better trained teachers, but sim
ple arithmetic will tell you that it will
not compensate them for what they
might be earning in industry."
Michael Kirst, professor of educa
tion, called the proposal "a very im
portant first step" toward improving
high school math and science. He
said the Reagan plan came in re
sponse to widespread concern about
the lagging quality of education in
the sciences and the effect it might
have on the nation's technological
advancement. Until recently, Kirst
noted, the President has worked to
eliminate federal support of science
education.
According to the plan, $50 million
would be divided among the states to
help them speed some 7000 new
math and science teachers into sec
ondary schools. These tunds would
provide scholarships of up to $5000

to college graduates who could be
trained as math and science teachers
within one year.
Other incentives include a $20 mill
ion program to improve the training
ot current math and science instruc
tors and a program to give $5000 Pres
idential Awards to IIHJ outstanding
pre-college mathematics and science
teachers each year.
Another $6 million would fund a
program to draw new doctoral de
gree recipients in science and en
gineering into university teaching.
The new teachers would each re
ceive $30,000 a year for five years.
Presidential advisors maintained
that Reagan has not changed his pos
ition on federal funding to science
education.
However, Kirst called it a 180-
degree turn for Reagan.
"I'm shocked and amazed by the
President's proposal," said Kirst.
"For Reagan to cut Carter's funding
of science education from $120 mill
ion to $20 million and then to prop
ose money for new programs is a
complete reversal of his former point
of view."
Kirst said the President bowed to
"terrific steam" in Congress to do
something about the problem.
"There is a growing realization that
we have let the resources and quality
of public education slide dramati
cally. The schools have lost the ability
to attract and retain qualified
teachers. The better teachers are
leaving education for industry," Kirst
said. However, Kirst said this realiza
tion was only a first step, and that
schools need additional funding to
affect any real improvement.
"The programs are very definitely
needed," Robert Osserman, chair
man of Stanford's math department
said. "The problem has only become
acute in math in the last two or three
years. Now that there are so many
options in business for math
graduates, few are going into the
teaching profession."
Mary Beth Robinson, director of
the Stanford Teacher Education
Program (STEP), said, "The light has
finally dawned on people that there's
a crisis in the shortage of qualified
teachers."
A nationwide survey conducted by
the National Science Board found 43

states reporting a shortage of math
teachers and 42 with shortages of
physics teachers. California alone
loses 1900 math and science teachers
a year to jobs in business and indus
try which pay $5000 to $10,000 more
per year. A study by UC—Berkeley
researchers Ami Zusman and lames
Guthrie reported that with retire
ments some 2200 teachers may be
leaving the schools each year.
In addition, the Berkeley study
noted that few students in California
are training to replace these
teachers. A survey of 32 schools of
education in California recorded
only 110 students enrolled in math
education and 184 in science educa
tion in the 1981-82 school year.
Stanford had no aspiring math
teachers and only four science edu
cation students when the survey was
taken. Dr. Robinson now reports six
in math and four in science.
The University's only education
student in physics, Barbra Saur,
graduated with honors from UCLA
and worked with lasers for TRW, an
electronics firm, before enrolling in
the STEP program.
"They were shocked at work that I
was quitting to go into teaching."
Saur said interest in physics and the
excitement of teaching attracted her,
but acknowledged that the low
salaries and the low esteem the pub
lic has for teachers discourages most

Myron Atkin
math and science majors. She esti
mated that her former pay was equi
valent to the top step of most teacher
salary schedules.
Saur agreed that she was unusually
qualified for high school teaching
but added: "I think people with my
qualifications should go into teach
ing. I think the first introduction a
student has to a subject is the most
important."
However, studies indicate that the
number of qualified science and
math teachers is declining. A Na
tional Science Board study found
that half the teachers newly hired to
teach math and science were not cer
tified in the subjects. Another study
noted that between 1971 and 1980the
number of trained math teachers in
the nation declined by 77 percent
and science teachers by 65 percent.
As a result, high school students

are often taught these subjects by
teachers with little training.
"We're fortunate in Palo Alio to
have exceptionally qualified teachers
in math and science, but other
schools have to settle for the not
so-qualified." Larry Hull, advisor to
Stanford's science education prog
ram and c hairman of science at Gunn
High School said.
In announcing the President's in
centive program, Secretary of Educa
tion Terrel Bell said, "The declining
condition of science and mathema
tics education has become serious
enough to compromise the nation's
future ability to develop and advance
our traditional industrial base and
compete in the international mar
ketplace."
Hull said it will take more drastic
measures to improve teaching.
"We cannot continue the quality
of education we have enjoyed with
the kind of budget cuts we face "

condition of science and mathema
tics education has become serious
enough to compromise the nation's
future ability to develop and advance
our traditional industrial base and
compete in the international mar
ketplace."
Hull said it will take more drastic

President Reagan's $78 million
plan to reduce shortages of high
school math and science teac hers
drew qualified support trom several
professors here. Ihe President's
proposed scholarships and other in
centives, the professors said, would
attract new teac hers to the secondary
schools, but additional money is
needed to keep them there.
"Just hearing that there are jobs
available will attract some people to
the schools," Myron Atkins, dean of
the School of Education said. "And
Reagan's plan will initially bring in
the better trained teachers, but sim
ple arithmetic will tell you that it will
not compensate them for what they
might be earning in industry."
Michael Kirst, professor of educa
tion, called the proposal "a very im
portant first step" toward improving
high school math and science. He
said the Reagan plan came in re
sponse to widespread concern about
the lagging quality of education in
the sciences and the effect it might
have on the nation's technological
advancement. Until recently, Kirst
noted, the President has worked to
eliminate federal support of science
education.
According to the plan, $50 million
would be divided among the states to
help them speed some 7000 new
math and science teachers into sec
ondary schools. These tunds would
provide scholarships of up to $5000

to college graduates who could be
trained as math and science teachers
within one year.
Other incentives include a $20 mill
ion program to improve the training
ot current math and science instruc
tors and a program to give $5000 Pres
idential Awards to IIHJ outstanding
pre-college mathematics and science
teachers each year.
Another $6 million would fund a
program to draw new doctoral de
gree recipients in science and en
gineering into university teaching.
The new teachers would each re
ceive $30,000 a year for five years.
Presidential advisors maintained
that Reagan has not changed his pos
ition on federal funding to science
education.
However, Kirst called it a 180-
degree turn for Reagan.
"I'm shocked and amazed by the
President's proposal," said Kirst.
"For Reagan to cut Carter's funding
of science education from $120 mill
ion to $20 million and then to prop
ose money for new programs is a
complete reversal of his former point
of view."
Kirst said the President bowed to
"terrific steam" in Congress to do
something about the problem.
"There is a growing realization that
we have let the resources and quality
of public education slide dramati
cally. The schools have lost the ability
to attract and retain qualified
teachers. The better teachers are
leaving education for industry," Kirst
said. However, Kirst said this realiza
tion was only a first step, and that
schools need additional funding to
affect any real improvement.
"The programs are very definitely
needed," Robert Osserman, chair
man of Stanford's math department
said. "The problem has only become
acute in math in the last two or three
years. Now that there are so many
options in business for math
graduates, few are going into the
teaching profession."
Mary Beth Robinson, director of
the Stanford Teacher Education
Program (STEP), said, "The light has
finally dawned on people that there's
a crisis in the shortage of qualified
teachers."
A nationwide survey conducted by
the National Science Board found 43

states reporting a shortage of math
teachers and 42 with shortages of
physics teachers. California alone
loses 1900 math and science teachers
a year to jobs in business and indus
try which pay $5000 to $10,000 more
per year. A study by UC—Berkeley
researchers Ami Zusman and lames
Guthrie reported that with retire
ments some 2200 teachers may be
leaving the schools each year.
In addition, the Berkeley study
noted that few students in California
are training to replace these
teachers. A survey of 32 schools of
education in California recorded
only 110 students enrolled in math
education and 184 in science educa
tion in the 1981-82 school year.
Stanford had no aspiring math
teachers and only four science edu
cation students when the survey was
taken. Dr. Robinson now reports six
in math and four in science.
The University's only education
student in physics, Barbra Saur,
graduated with honors from UCLA
and worked with lasers for TRW, an
electronics firm, before enrolling in
the STEP program.
"They were shocked at work that I
was quitting to go into teaching."
Saur said interest in physics and the
excitement of teaching attracted her,
but acknowledged that the low
salaries and the low esteem the pub
lic has for teachers discourages most


Michael Kirst


Myron Atkin
math and science majors. She esti
mated that her former pay was equi
valent to the top step of most teacher
salary schedules.
Saur agreed that she was unusually
qualified for high school teaching
but added: "I think people with my
qualifications should go into teach
ing. I think the first introduction a
student has to a subject is the most
important."
However, studies indicate that the
number of qualified science and
math teachers is declining. A Na
tional Science Board study found
that half the teachers newly hired to
teach math and science were not cer
tified in the subjects. Another study
noted that between 1971 and 1980the
number of trained math teachers in
the nation declined by 77 percent
and science teachers by 65 percent.
As a result, high school students

are often taught these subjects by
teachers with little training.
"We're fortunate in Palo Alio to
have exceptionally qualified teachers
in math and science, but other
schools have to settle for the not
so-qualified." Larry Hull, advisor to
Stanford's science education prog
ram and c hairman of science at Gunn
High School said.
