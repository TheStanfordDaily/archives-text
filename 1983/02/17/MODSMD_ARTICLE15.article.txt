## The
						Stanford Daily Wanted: housing for grads 
### 
Last Tuesday the University Board of Trustees
approved an average increase in room rates of
14.5 percent, with more than half of that hike
occurring because of the dormitories built this
year. This increase affects both graduates and
undergraduates living on campus, and get the
new housing is only open to undergraduates.
We find it disturbing that the University has
made no specific plans concerning graduate
housing — except that there is a need for it —
and yet is forcing graduate students to pay for a
portion of the new undergraduate residences.
Because of the inequality of the present sys
tem, the University should either make a com
mitment to building graduate housing in the
near future, or it should not force graduate stu
dents to pay for housing for which they are
ineligible.
Although we do believe that graduate stu
dents have a legitimate grievance over the
room-rate situation on-campus, housing rates
affect all students equally. Thus, under
graduates living in Wilbur or Stern halls are also
helping to pay for the new residences.
All is not bleak on the graduate housing hori
zon. Despite any inequities, we believe that the
situation for graduate housing is better now
than it has been in the past. Because of the
increase in undergraduate housing, fewer un
dergraduates are living off-campus, thus open
ing up more space for graduate students.
Also, this quarter approximately 350 addi
tional spaces in Manzanita Park were allotted for

graduate students, and 54 graduate spaces in
Mirrielees are planned for next year.
Finally, although housing rates have in
creased on-campus, they are still on average
less than those paid by students living off
campus.
Ihe University is presently exploring other
options for creating more graduate space on
campus — short of building new residences
such as allowing graduate students to live in the
co-ops. All of these options are the best possi
ble given the current system of residences the
University has and the difference between the
types ot residential programs undergraduates
and graduates require — for instance, graduate
students do not have resident assistants and, so
far, have not expressed a need for the type of
residential programs found in undergraduate
housing. We believe that these first steps are a
good start on the road to better housing for all.
However, first steps are all these are, and we
believe the University should make a strong and
specific commitment to building more graduate
housing in the near future, both to justify charg
ing graduate students for costs associated with
undergraduate residences and to continue to
attract the high level of graduate students the
University has in the past. Furthermore, if such a
plan is approved, there should be no appreci
able difference between housing rates paid by
undergraduates and graduates. We see any
other option as untenable and unfair to the en
tire student population.
