## Alcohol and dorms do not mix 
### 
For years people have contended
that universities should not become
involved with the usage of alcohol by
college students. But now it looks
like both the students and the ad
ministrators here are in disaccord
with the prevailing sentiments.
Students and administrators have
traditionally bickered over the so
called "policing" of activities and so
cial events. Here, however, things
are slightly different. Paradoxically,
the end result is that the University is
purchasing alcohol for underage
dormitory residents.
Being that my last statement seems
highly improbable, I will attempt to
clarify the seemingly irregular de
tails. When each student writes out a
check for their quarterly pilgrimage
to the Registrar's Office, they are
paying not only for tuition, room,
and board, but also their house dues.
These dues are frequently used to
pure hase alcohol. It should be made
clear that such a scenario is no
stranger to all-freshmen dormitories.
University officials, of course, do
not interpret this as the University
purchasing alcohol for underage
students. As University President
Donald Kennedy phrased it, the Uni
versity is not buying alcohol, but is
instead "acting as an agent."
Norm Robinson, acting dean of
student affairs, concurred. He
claimed that the "University is serv
ing as a collection agency and pas
sing it on to the communities (dor
mitories)."
Another point that Robinson
brings up is that Stanford students
should be prepared to deal with the
issue of alcohol when they leave
here. "Stanford is an institution that
places a tremendous amount of re
sponsibility on the students . . . this
approach is more educationally
sound than not allowing alcohol,"
Robinson declared. Ironically,
however, Robinson said that the Of
fice of the Dean of Student Affairs
wouldn't ( hange its policv if students
voted by reterrmdum to ban the use
of dorm funds for alcohol.

The Office of Residential tduca
tion is intricately entwined in Univer
sity alcohol policy decisions. The as
sistant dean of Residential Education
is Alice Supton. According to Sup
ton, "I see it as my iob to influence
the residence environment so that
students can choose not to drink at
all or to drink moderately." Supton
expressed concern "that it there was
a regulation prohibiting the ;jse of
house dues for alcohol in frosh resi
dences, some students in those
houses might not participate in the
community activities of the house,
such as parties.
Supton also replied that she had "a
problem with the notion of setting
up a regulation differentiating trosh
houses from other kinds of houses."
Supton's reasoning is that freshmen
in four-class dorms are also under
twenty-one, yet would not be af
fected.
Almost everyone seems to be, as
Supton put it, "concerned with the
association of alcohol and a good
time," but University officials, in my
opinion, are overly de-emphasizing
the many legal implications. For
example, if someone drives from a
dorm function in a state of inebria
tion — and has an accident — the
University isamongthe longc hain of
parties that can be sued. As one Uni
versity publication points out,
"While the law regarding the legal
drinking age is rarely enforced on
college campuses, it nonetheless
applies and the fact that alcohol had
been provided to underage students
would very likely become an issue in
event of damage or injury."
But despite the controversy, many
students maintain a desire to use
dorm funds to purchase alcohol. In
deed, many people do not differen
tiate between social functions with
spirit and social functions with
spirits. For instance, when one
freshman, Louis Hsieh, was asked
what he thought would happen if no
alcohol was served at a party, he re
sponded, "it would be boring." But

others disagree. In a different dorm,
Resident Assistant Eric Postel
claimed what was really necessary
were "situations to meet each
other.' And Supton contended, "I
think if you're smart enough and
creative enough you can find really
wonderful things to do that don't re
quire alcohol."
Yet the University, at least for the
present, is sticking to the status quo
policy. But using alcohol is an indi
vidual judgement. Can the Univer
sity justify buying it because a large
percentage — probably the majority
— of Stanford students consume it?
Dormitories are University
controlled housing. In using dorm
funds, the University is assessing
nondrinkers to support the propaga
tion of alcohol. This seems to indi
cate that the University condones the
breaking of the law.
Maybe the most ridiculous aspect of
this situation is the so-called non
alcoholic alternative beverage pol
icy. This Res. Ed. rule dictates that a
non-alcoholic beverage be served
wherever alcoholic beverages are
formally made available. The "alter
native," generally being less expen
sive (and less consumed), encour
ages and reinforces the perception
that the University is accepting re
sponsibility forsuch an option — and
that it's not only fair, but legal.
Let me emphasize that if resi
dences, as a unit, discontinued the
purchase of alcohol, it would in no
way necessarily lead to a decrease in
the consumption of alcoholic bever
ages. The question is not whether
the Universitv residences should in
tervene in the affairs of students who
choose to consume alcohol, but
rather, the decision is a question of
whether or not to participate in the
illegal dissemination of alcohol.
Indeed, the separation of alcohol
from organized college functions
will be a happy hour for all of us.
