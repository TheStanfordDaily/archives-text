## Historical designs deserve respect 
### 
The University s interest in "restor
ing and completing" the original
landscape scheme of the Quad
rangle is praiseworthy indeed, but I
suspect that the Planning Office's
specific proposals demand less un
critical enthusiasm and more cau
tious circumspection than Bob
Cohn's story (Daily, Feb. 3) might
suggest.
Along with Palm Drive and the
small park surrounding the Stanford
Family Mausoleum, the landscaping
of the Quad is among the few aspects
of Frederick Olmsted's comprehen
sive c ampus plan of 18H8 to have seen
even partial construction. Contrary
to the Daily report, Olmsted acted
only as an unofficial and quite in
frequent advisor to the planners of
Golden Gate Park (his own design for
a pleasure ground' in San Francisco
never went beyond the int'al propo
sal). The Quad thus forms a signifi
cant part of the only surviving work
actually executed on the West Coast
by the founder of American land
scape architecture.
With $1 million at its disposal, the

University could restore the Quad
rangle with an accuracy befitting its
central importance to the overall de
sign of the c ampus and its signal sig
nificance as an element of the Olm
sted plan; inattention to the histori
cal record could, on rhe other hand,
easily result in decisions of the sort
that so recently turned the Oval into
a strange hybrid midwav between a
corporate putting green and a vete
ran's cemetery.
The warning flag is already up in
the Daily story, where Director of
Planning Philip Williams states, for
instance, that the original planting
circles are likely to change in size and
content, "perhaps to include seating
and lighting." A simple trip to the
University archives will reveal that
the size, coping, location and plant
ing of these circles was worked out in
close detail by Olmsted and his on
site assistants. Williams' promise to
"respect" Olmsted's design in this
case apparently means in tact to "im
prove" upon it.
The options for paving the Quad
mentioned in the Daily sound
equally suspect. Olmsted's pre

ferred surface was concrete slabs, ul
timately abandoned in favor of as
phalt for reasons of economy and ef
ficiency — no doubt on the orders of
Senator Stanford himself. The choice
must clearly be between these two
modes of paving.
The Planning Office is, perhaps
understandably, as often concerned
with practicality" and "moderniza
tion" as with preservation. Is it too
much to ask in the present instance
that the responsible members of the
board of trustees visit the University
archives and read Prof. Paul
Turner's monograph on Stanford ar
chitecture, The Founders and the Ar
chitects (1976) and my own essay,
"Frederick Law Olmsted and the
Original Landscape Plans for Stan
ford University" (1982) before send
ing the bulldozers into the Quad?
Olmsted's design — and the ele
ments of it that already exist — de
serve to be restored with the respect
that only such an effort at historical
understanding can engender.
