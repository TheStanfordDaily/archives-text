# Stanford receives long bomb
## 
### 
SBXIX is coming. Don't look sky
ward â€” SBXIX is not a new substitute
for the MX missile. Rather, it's the
1985 Super Bowl (SB), which is
targeted for Stanford.
If you're breathing a sigh of relief
it's definitely a premature one. SBXIX
is far more dangerous than the MX
missile. SBXIX is densely packed
(sorry) with a fallout 10 times more
terrifying than any radioactive parti
cle known to man.
Why will SBXIX be based in Palo
Alto? It was decided several years ago
to shuttle the SB between different
cities, sort of like a giant shell game.
That way, the Russians would never
know exactly where the SB was (so if
any Russians wanted to attend the
Super Bowl, they'd be out of luck).
Some people are very excited
about the prospect of SBXIX. Dianne
Feinstein, for instance, can't wait for
SBXIX. After all, a Super Bowl gener
ates a substantial amount ol revenue
for a city, and "revenue" just hap
pens to be one of Mayor Feinstein's
favorite words. Every now and then,
her Honor has visions of thousands
of football fans riding up and down
the hills of San Francisco and eating
lots of stuffed crab (preferably in that
order). She grins uncontrollably and
her eyes light up with dollar signs.
Andy Geiger, Stanford's athletic
director, is also very excited about
SBXIX. Vou see, the National Football
League wants to be sure that it's bas
ing SBXIX in a suitable silo. While
Stanford Stadium is certainly large
enough, it is not exactly the Ritz-
Carlton of football stadiums. So the
NFL has agreed to share the costs of
making a few improvements, such as
new locker rooms, new hot
dog stands and new toilets. Geiger
has wanted these things for a long

time, particularly the toilets. He and
other University officials also believe
that the national exposure Stanford
will receive as a result of SBXIX will
be extremely beneficial to the Uni
versity and its athletic programs.
The reactions of Feinstein and
Geiger are similar to the reaction that
the mayor of Cheyenne, Wyoming
had when the MX "Dense Pack" plan
was unveiled. Had the plan been ap
proved, the MX would have been
housed right next doorto Cheyenne.
One might have expected that the
mayor would resign and move to
Bangor, Maine. On the contrary, he
was thrilled that the project would
create 8000 new jobs in Cheyenne
and bring in millions of dollars of
revenue (there's that word again).
Just as the mayor of Cheyenne
overlooked the dangers of the MX,
Feinstein and Geiger seem to be ig
noring the hazardous fallout of
SBXIX: the out-of-towners. Not just
ordinary out-of-towners, mind you.
As you watched Super Bowl XVII on
TV, did you notice the crowd? These
folks are dangerous, and they're
headed our way. Hide your children,
lock your doors, bring the cat inside.
We're talking about looney, crazy
wacko Super Bowl fans. Sure, every
team has fans. You might even be a
pro football fan and consider your
self relatively stable. But you're not
the type of fan who will be invading
the Bay Area. Only the mentally
handicapped would spend hundreds
of dollars, travel thousands of miles,
fight through enormous crowds and
eat cold hot dogs in order to "be
there," rather than watch Sunday's
heroes on the tube in the comfort of
their own living rooms.
Oh sure, these ya-hoos will spend
millions of dollars on lodging, food

and entertainment in the Bay Area. In
return for this nice, new money,
however, we'll be forced to host a
week-long party with an unlimited
guest list. Moreover, most of the
guests will dress and act like mis
placed contestants from "Let's Make
a Deal."
When Geiger was gushing about
all of the improvements and all of the
attention that Stanford would re
ceive as a result of SRXIX, did he ever
consider the speed with which 90,000
drunken lunatics could physically
and psychologically destroy the
University? In just 10 seconds, 22.000
deranged Dolphins' fans could make
the band look like the John Birch So
ciety. In just eight seconds, a gang of
rowdy Redskins fans could convince
a naive, frt?hh/T>an Kbit's*rfa
ally Harpo Marx. And in just five sec
onds, a pack of wild Jets' fans could
chew up and swallow each of the
four and a half million volumes in
the University's libraries. You get the
picture. It's not pretty.
In short, deployment of SBXIX at
Stanford will mean that thousands of
innocent students will be forced to
live in constant fear, waiting for the
out-of-towners to strike. If Geiger
needs to offset the costs of repairing
his toilets, why doesn't he just or
ganize a car wash? Or maybe a bake
sale. Or, if he really wants to achieve
the comparable monetary rewards
and national attention that SBXIX
would bring to the University, why
doesn't he simply agree to base the
MX missile beneath the !>0 yard-line
at Stanford Stadium. But please,
send SBXIX to Gheyenne.
