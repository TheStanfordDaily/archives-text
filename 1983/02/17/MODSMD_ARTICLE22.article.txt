## University police officers casual yet professional 
### NICOLE MICHAELS 
(Editor's note: Daily reporter Nicole
Michaels spent two shifts, one day
shift and one night shift, riding with
Stanford police officers. Her impres
sion of those experiences with Sgt.
Kris Simpson and Officer Ron Levine
follow.)

Kris Simpson
Sergeant Kris Simpson is not a
stereo-typical "butch" woman of
ficer, nor is she a "Charlie's Angel."
A description of Simpson must lie
somewhere in between. Her speech
reflects her college education and
her field — articulate yet oddly
coarse. Her manner is professional,
even tough, yet her sensitivity is evi
dent when she hovers over an in
jured animal.
She is adventurous and she likes
her job.
The danger associated with police
work is seldom disputed and widely
known; but the extreme levels of
stress involved are often underesti
mated by outsiders. Simpson said
she finds three factors particularly
draining: first, an officer experiences
a number of adrenalin climbs in a
single shift out offearalone. Because
of the potential for conflict, the
police officer has reason to fear even
the routine car stop. Second, the
scene of a bad accident is distressing.
And finally, even "boring" days are
stressful because the police officer
must be alert to a constantly chang
ing environment that might explode
at any moment.
With this is mind we pulled onto
Palm Drive. It was unclear what the
day would hold for Simpson and me.
We first spotted an old, orange
pick-up truck without a bed, spewing
smelly gray muffler smoke and mis
sing its rear license plate. "This'll be a
good stop," Simpson said with a
chuckle, notifying the dispatcher
that we were making a "car stop."
A chubby man clambered down
from the driver's seat and barked:
"Yesh, ma'am." A suddenly stiffer,
more distant Simpson addressed the
young man, and for once I was glad I
was on the other side of the scene.
The man fished for his driver's
license and vehicle registration and
pulled a California plate from the
glove compartment. From the truck,
the driver's friend caught my eye and
we laughed. I had the impression
that the dog he was clutching was
laughing too, and when I looked at
simpson I saw her laugh a little. The
driver lit up a Marlboro cigarette and
dolefully awaited the predictable lec
ture and citation; but, to my surprise
and probably his, the lecture and ci
tation didn't come.

Instead, Simpson questioned him
and joked with him until soon he was
laughing too. With a final, half
serious reprimand, Simpson re
turned to the squad car.
As we pulled out I asked why she
hadn't cited him. Simpson replied
that he had just bought the truck and
hadn't yet replaced the muffler. She
explained that his mother worked on
campus so he would undoubtedly be
back and would get cited then if he
hadn't tended to the violations.
Simpson explained her friendly be
havior.
"I like to have a good time when
I'm working. Then sometimes I have
to be real cold and unfeeling and un
emotional — the situation may call
for that also."
As a sergeant, Simpson demands
that her officers be fair and objective
in a courteous way. She keeps two
rules in mind when dealing with the
public. "First, you don't back 'em
into a corner, or you'll lose their
cooperation. Second, provide them
with their dignity by providing them
with the alternatives acceptable to
both the officers and the citizens.
Anybody who develops the ability to
do both these things will be more
successful as a police officer,"
Simpson said.
Simpson shares a view prevalent
among the officers: Stanford stu
dents have a false sense of security
that is reflected in both their laxness
— leaving doors unlocked, women
jogging at night — and their disre
gard for laws, such as running stop
signs and biking at night without a
light
"Students feel they have a leniency
to laws allowed them. It's a real
shock to them when they have to go
to |ail like anyone else in the real
world, ' said Simpson.
Afraid that she had sounded too
critical, she anxiously assured me
that her opinion of Stanford students
is a favorable one. Students are
"friendly, more willing to get in
volved in an exchange or a dialogue
with you, and they're more respect
ful" than adults or other citizens, she
said. Her criticism rises out of her
concern over students' personal
safety being jeopardized by unlawful
or simply careless behavior.
The afternoon passed uneventfully
—no lecturing to careless students.
The biggest excitement was a cita
tion Simpson issued to the driver of a
ratty, red Mustang coupe for having
"excessive muffler noise." The
driver had passed over the crosswalk
where Mayfield meets Lausen, disre
garding the stop sign until hesawour
squad car and stopped abruptly and

rather sheepishly. I laughed, having
coasted through that one a tew times
myself and seen dozens of people do
the same.
We made a U-turn and pursued
him. Stuck behind a timid driver who
had difficulty negotiating the four
wav intersection, Simpson was frus
trated and the Mustang escaped
around the corner. I thought we had

lost him but suddenly she turned
into a parking lot, exclaiming,
"Thought you had me fooled,didn't
you!"
I was impressed: the driver had
darted into a parking lot, but the
sound of its muffler had tipped
Simpson off and she had been able to
track it down.
Pulling out of the parking lot,

Simpson seemed satisfied. "I really
hate it when they get away," she
chuckled.
Ron Levine
It was on one of these slow shifts
that I rode with deputy sheriff Ron
Levine, a lanky 24-year-old whose
warmth and sensitivity which have

made him a favorite among students
were immediately evident.
Levine's personal working philos
ophy is one of spirit of the law vs.
letter of the law. He described him
self as typical of most of the force in
that he is aggressive and pro-active
but tolerant, allowing for legal flexi
bility.
"Stanford students are lucky in
that we don't fully enforce all the
laws," he said. "We're not here to
play mother, and the police are
happy that students handle them
selves as well as they do. The stu
dents pretty well police themselves.
Initially I was skeptical that a force
that is "tolerant" could also be pro
active. But after watching Levine on
duty and remembering my ride with
Simpson, it was evident that pro
active meant enforcing the law with
out necessarily implementing
punishment to do so; but effectively
enforcing the law all the same.
Many of the officers here are
young, and the slight age difference
between officers and-students tends
to establish a better working rela
tionship with the students. Some of
ficers interact with students on a
first-name friendship basis.
My Friday night started out with an
investigation of a possible prowler at
Green Library that turned out to be
no more than the noise made by an
air conditioner shutting down.
The next excitement was a Code 2
(urgent, but blow-off the light and
siren) call about a mother and daugh
ter fight in Escondido Village. It was a
bit of a thrill cruising at almost twice
the posted speed limit down )unip
ero Serra. The Code 2, however, be
came Code 4 — call cancelled be
cause another unit was already on
the scene. Back to hitting on bicyc
lists without lights.
We stopped a "valley girl" driving
a white VW bug that had lights; they
just weren't on.
We were en route to Palm Drive
when we got a call over the police
phone that sounded interesting:
Mal-mish to plants . . . second floor
of Herrin Lab. Mal-mish to plants??
"Malicious mischief," Levine
explained. I found it hard to believe
someone would report malicious
mischief to some plants at II on a
Friday night. This was a Code 1 — at
your leisure.
The call revealed that Levine likes
to have fun on the job. A planter had
been knocked loose from a railing
and had smashed on the concrete
below. The grad student who re
ported the mal-mish, his roommate,

and I evine and I joked about estimat
ing the damages and whether or not
we should classify the incident as a
misdemeanor or a felony.
then Levine wanted to show me a
horse skeleton, of all things, on the
roof of the lab, something he had
discovered on a previous search of
the lab. The roof at Herrin Lab is full
ot mildewed greenhouses and stor
age items, and in one corner, sure
enough, ihere was a complete horse
skeleton. Had a Daily photographer
been with us, Levine joked, he would
have straddled the skeleton and we
could have shot a photo and written
the caption: "Stanford mounted
police."
As we passed the greenhouses on
our way out, Levine mentioned that
Simpson had asked him to take a
look into them to "see just what was
growing." The grad student laughed
and excitedly showed us a
greenhouse where a caterpillar was
pupating. He neglected to mention
that the caterpillar was also commit
ting a 314 (that's indecent exposure).
Wow. Mal-mish to plants, a horse
skeleton, a pupating caterpillar guilty
of indecent exposure — and the
was young!
After a predictable false fire alarm
in front of Branner Hall, the rest of
the shift passed quietly and a bit
more seriously. Levine showed me
where two of the rapes committed
last year had occurred. It was a sober
ing experience to be where a violent
crime had been committed, even
months after the fact. The forbid
ding, forested gloom off of Palm
Drive was a stark reminder of what
much of police work is really like:
lonely, in its lack of appreciation;
threatening, simply by definition;
and unknown, demanding alertness
and adaptability.
"The goal of every officer is to sim
ply go home alive," Levine said in a
serious tone. Stanford police, de
spite the tame nature of campus,
must be ready to respond profes
sionally to any situation, violent or
not. But when it is tame, they have a
good time.

single shift out offearalone. Because
of the potential for conflict, the
police officer has reason to fear even
the routine car stop. Second, the
scene of a bad accident is distressing.
And finally, even "boring" days are
stressful because the police officer
must be alert to a constantly chang
ing environment that might explode
at any moment.
With this is mind we pulled onto
Palm Drive. It was unclear what the
day would hold for Simpson and me.
We first spotted an old, orange
pick-up truck without a bed, spewing
smelly gray muffler smoke and mis
sing its rear license plate. "This'll be a
good stop," Simpson said with a
chuckle, notifying the dispatcher
that we were making a "car stop."
A chubby man clambered down
from the driver's seat and barked:
"Yesh, ma'am." A suddenly stiffer,
more distant Simpson addressed the
young man, and for once I was glad I
was on the other side of the scene.
The man fished for his driver's
license and vehicle registration and
pulled a California plate from the
glove compartment. From the truck,
the driver's friend caught my eye and
we laughed. I had the impression
that the dog he was clutching was
laughing too, and when I looked at
simpson I saw her laugh a little. The
driver lit up a Marlboro cigarette and
dolefully awaited the predictable lec
ture and citation; but, to my surprise
and probably his, the lecture and ci
tation didn't come.

Instead, Simpson questioned him
and joked with him until soon he was
laughing too. With a final, half
serious reprimand, Simpson re
turned to the squad car.
As we pulled out I asked why she
hadn't cited him. Simpson replied
that he had just bought the truck and
hadn't yet replaced the muffler. She
explained that his mother worked on
campus so he would undoubtedly be
back and would get cited then if he
hadn't tended to the violations.
Simpson explained her friendly be
havior.
"I like to have a good time when
I'm working. Then sometimes I have
to be real cold and unfeeling and un
emotional — the situation may call
for that also."
As a sergeant, Simpson demands
that her officers be fair and objective
in a courteous way. She keeps two
rules in mind when dealing with the
public. "First, you don't back 'em
into a corner, or you'll lose their
cooperation. Second, provide them
with their dignity by providing them
with the alternatives acceptable to
both the officers and the citizens.
Anybody who develops the ability to
do both these things will be more
successful as a police officer,"
Simpson said.
Simpson shares a view prevalent
among the officers: Stanford stu
dents have a false sense of security
that is reflected in both their laxness
— leaving doors unlocked, women
jogging at night — and their disre
gard for laws, such as running stop
signs and biking at night without a
light
"Students feel they have a leniency
to laws allowed them. It's a real
shock to them when they have to go
to |ail like anyone else in the real
world, ' said Simpson.
Afraid that she had sounded too
critical, she anxiously assured me
that her opinion of Stanford students
is a favorable one. Students are
"friendly, more willing to get in
volved in an exchange or a dialogue
with you, and they're more respect
ful" than adults or other citizens, she
said. Her criticism rises out of her
concern over students' personal
safety being jeopardized by unlawful
or simply careless behavior.
The afternoon passed uneventfully
—no lecturing to careless students.
The biggest excitement was a cita
tion Simpson issued to the driver of a
ratty, red Mustang coupe for having
"excessive muffler noise." The
driver had passed over the crosswalk
where Mayfield meets Lausen, disre
garding the stop sign until hesawour
squad car and stopped abruptly and

rather sheepishly. I laughed, having
coasted through that one a tew times
myself and seen dozens of people do
the same.
We made a U-turn and pursued
him. Stuck behind a timid driver who
had difficulty negotiating the four
wav intersection, Simpson was frus
trated and the Mustang escaped
around the corner. I thought we had

lost him but suddenly she turned
into a parking lot, exclaiming,
"Thought you had me fooled,didn't
you!"
I was impressed: the driver had
darted into a parking lot, but the
sound of its muffler had tipped
Simpson off and she had been able to
track it down.
Pulling out of the parking lot,

Simpson seemed satisfied. "I really
hate it when they get away," she
chuckled.
Ron Levine
It was on one of these slow shifts
that I rode with deputy sheriff Ron
Levine, a lanky 24-year-old whose
warmth and sensitivity which have

made him a favorite among students
were immediately evident.
Levine's personal working philos
ophy is one of spirit of the law vs.
letter of the law. He described him
self as typical of most of the force in
that he is aggressive and pro-active
but tolerant, allowing for legal flexi
bility.
"Stanford students are lucky in
that we don't fully enforce all the
laws," he said. "We're not here to
play mother, and the police are
happy that students handle them
selves as well as they do. The stu
dents pretty well police themselves.
Initially I was skeptical that a force
that is "tolerant" could also be pro
active. But after watching Levine on
duty and remembering my ride with
Simpson, it was evident that pro
active meant enforcing the law with
out necessarily implementing
punishment to do so; but effectively
enforcing the law all the same.
Many of the officers here are
young, and the slight age difference
between officers and-students tends
to establish a better working rela
tionship with the students. Some of
ficers interact with students on a
first-name friendship basis.
My Friday night started out with an
investigation of a possible prowler at
Green Library that turned out to be
no more than the noise made by an
air conditioner shutting down.
The next excitement was a Code 2
(urgent, but blow-off the light and
siren) call about a mother and daugh
ter fight in Escondido Village. It was a
bit of a thrill cruising at almost twice
the posted speed limit down )unip
ero Serra. The Code 2, however, be
came Code 4 — call cancelled be
cause another unit was already on
the scene. Back to hitting on bicyc
lists without lights.
We stopped a "valley girl" driving
a white VW bug that had lights; they
just weren't on.
We were en route to Palm Drive
when we got a call over the police
phone that sounded interesting:
Mal-mish to plants . . . second floor
of Herrin Lab. Mal-mish to plants??
"Malicious mischief," Levine
explained. I found it hard to believe
someone would report malicious
mischief to some plants at II on a
Friday night. This was a Code 1 — at
your leisure.
The call revealed that Levine likes
to have fun on the job. A planter had
been knocked loose from a railing
and had smashed on the concrete
below. The grad student who re
ported the mal-mish, his roommate,

and I evine and I joked about estimat
ing the damages and whether or not
we should classify the incident as a
misdemeanor or a felony.
then Levine wanted to show me a
horse skeleton, of all things, on the
roof of the lab, something he had
discovered on a previous search of
the lab. The roof at Herrin Lab is full
ot mildewed greenhouses and stor
age items, and in one corner, sure
enough, ihere was a complete horse
skeleton. Had a Daily photographer
been with us, Levine joked, he would
have straddled the skeleton and we
could have shot a photo and written
the caption: "Stanford mounted
police."
As we passed the greenhouses on
our way out, Levine mentioned that
Simpson had asked him to take a
look into them to "see just what was
growing." The grad student laughed
and excitedly showed us a
greenhouse where a caterpillar was
pupating. He neglected to mention
that the caterpillar was also commit
ting a 314 (that's indecent exposure).
Wow. Mal-mish to plants, a horse
skeleton, a pupating caterpillar guilty
of indecent exposure — and the
was young!
After a predictable false fire alarm
in front of Branner Hall, the rest of
the shift passed quietly and a bit
more seriously. Levine showed me
where two of the rapes committed
last year had occurred. It was a sober
ing experience to be where a violent
crime had been committed, even
months after the fact. The forbid
ding, forested gloom off of Palm
Drive was a stark reminder of what
much of police work is really like:
lonely, in its lack of appreciation;
threatening, simply by definition;
and unknown, demanding alertness
and adaptability.
"The goal of every officer is to sim
ply go home alive," Levine said in a
serious tone. Stanford police, de
spite the tame nature of campus,
must be ready to respond profes
sionally to any situation, violent or
not. But when it is tame, they have a
good time.
(Editor's note: Daily reporter Nicole
Michaels spent two shifts, one day
shift and one night shift, riding with
Stanford police officers. Her impres
sion of those experiences with Sgt.
Kris Simpson and Officer Ron Levine
follow.)

Kris Simpson
Sergeant Kris Simpson is not a
stereo-typical "butch" woman of
ficer, nor is she a "Charlie's Angel."
A description of Simpson must lie
somewhere in between. Her speech
reflects her college education and
her field — articulate yet oddly
coarse. Her manner is professional,
even tough, yet her sensitivity is evi
dent when she hovers over an in
jured animal.
She is adventurous and she likes
her job.
The danger associated with police
work is seldom disputed and widely
known; but the extreme levels of
stress involved are often underesti
mated by outsiders. Simpson said
she finds three factors particularly
draining: first, an officer experiences
a number of adrenalin climbs in a
single shift out offearalone. Because
of the potential for conflict, the
police officer has reason to fear even
the routine car stop. Second, the

The man fished for his driver's
license and vehicle registration and
pulled a California plate from the
glove compartment. From the truck,
the driver's friend caught my eye and
we laughed. I had the impression
that the dog he was clutching was
laughing too, and when I looked at
simpson I saw her laugh a little. The
driver lit up a Marlboro cigarette and
dolefully awaited the predictable lec
ture and citation; but, to my surprise
and probably his, the lecture and ci
tation didn't come.

Instead, Simpson questioned him
and joked with him until soon he was
laughing too. With a final, half
serious reprimand, Simpson re
turned to the squad car.
As we pulled out I asked why she
hadn't cited him. Simpson replied
that he had just bought the truck and
hadn't yet replaced the muffler. She
explained that his mother worked on
campus so he would undoubtedly be
back and would get cited then if he
hadn't tended to the violations.
Simpson explained her friendly be
havior.
"I like to have a good time when
I'm working. Then sometimes I have
to be real cold and unfeeling and un
emotional — the situation may call
for that also."
As a sergeant, Simpson demands
that her officers be fair and objective
in a courteous way. She keeps two
rules in mind when dealing with the
public. "First, you don't back 'em
into a corner, or you'll lose their
cooperation. Second, provide them
with their dignity by providing them
with the alternatives acceptable to
both the officers and the citizens.
Anybody who develops the ability to
do both these things will be more
successful as a police officer,"
Simpson said.
Simpson shares a view prevalent
among the officers: Stanford stu
dents have a false sense of security
that is reflected in both their laxness
— leaving doors unlocked, women
jogging at night — and their disre
gard for laws, such as running stop
signs and biking at night without a
light
"Students feel they have a leniency
to laws allowed them. It's a real
shock to them when they have to go
to |ail like anyone else in the real
world, ' said Simpson.
Afraid that she had sounded too
critical, she anxiously assured me
that her opinion of Stanford students
is a favorable one. Students are
"friendly, more willing to get in
volved in an exchange or a dialogue
with you, and they're more respect
ful" than adults or other citizens, she
said. Her criticism rises out of her
concern over students' personal
safety being jeopardized by unlawful
or simply careless behavior.
The afternoon passed uneventfully
—no lecturing to careless students.
The biggest excitement was a cita
tion Simpson issued to the driver of a
ratty, red Mustang coupe for having
"excessive muffler noise." The
driver had passed over the crosswalk
where Mayfield meets Lausen, disre
garding the stop sign until hesawour
squad car and stopped abruptly and

rather sheepishly. I laughed, having
coasted through that one a tew times
myself and seen dozens of people do
the same.
We made a U-turn and pursued
him. Stuck behind a timid driver who
had difficulty negotiating the four
wav intersection, Simpson was frus
trated and the Mustang escaped
around the corner. I thought we had

lost him but suddenly she turned
into a parking lot, exclaiming,
"Thought you had me fooled,didn't
you!"
I was impressed: the driver had
darted into a parking lot, but the
sound of its muffler had tipped
Simpson off and she had been able to
track it down.
Pulling out of the parking lot,

Simpson seemed satisfied. "I really
hate it when they get away," she
chuckled.
Ron Levine
It was on one of these slow shifts
that I rode with deputy sheriff Ron
Levine, a lanky 24-year-old whose
warmth and sensitivity which have

made him a favorite among students
were immediately evident.
Levine's personal working philos
ophy is one of spirit of the law vs.
letter of the law. He described him
self as typical of most of the force in
that he is aggressive and pro-active
but tolerant, allowing for legal flexi
bility.
"Stanford students are lucky in
that we don't fully enforce all the
laws," he said. "We're not here to
play mother, and the police are
happy that students handle them
selves as well as they do. The stu
dents pretty well police themselves.
Initially I was skeptical that a force
that is "tolerant" could also be pro
active. But after watching Levine on
duty and remembering my ride with
Simpson, it was evident that pro
active meant enforcing the law with
out necessarily implementing
punishment to do so; but effectively
enforcing the law all the same.
Many of the officers here are
young, and the slight age difference
between officers and-students tends
to establish a better working rela
tionship with the students. Some of
ficers interact with students on a
first-name friendship basis.
My Friday night started out with an
investigation of a possible prowler at
Green Library that turned out to be
no more than the noise made by an
air conditioner shutting down.
The next excitement was a Code 2
(urgent, but blow-off the light and
siren) call about a mother and daugh
ter fight in Escondido Village. It was a
bit of a thrill cruising at almost twice
the posted speed limit down )unip
ero Serra. The Code 2, however, be
came Code 4 — call cancelled be
cause another unit was already on
the scene. Back to hitting on bicyc
lists without lights.
We stopped a "valley girl" driving
a white VW bug that had lights; they
just weren't on.
We were en route to Palm Drive
when we got a call over the police
phone that sounded interesting:
Mal-mish to plants . . . second floor
of Herrin Lab. Mal-mish to plants??
"Malicious mischief," Levine
explained. I found it hard to believe
someone would report malicious
mischief to some plants at II on a
Friday night. This was a Code 1 — at
your leisure.
The call revealed that Levine likes
to have fun on the job. A planter had
been knocked loose from a railing
and had smashed on the concrete
below. The grad student who re
ported the mal-mish, his roommate,

and I evine and I joked about estimat
ing the damages and whether or not
we should classify the incident as a
misdemeanor or a felony.
then Levine wanted to show me a
horse skeleton, of all things, on the
roof of the lab, something he had
discovered on a previous search of
the lab. The roof at Herrin Lab is full
ot mildewed greenhouses and stor
age items, and in one corner, sure
enough, ihere was a complete horse
skeleton. Had a Daily photographer
been with us, Levine joked, he would
have straddled the skeleton and we
could have shot a photo and written
the caption: "Stanford mounted
police."
As we passed the greenhouses on
our way out, Levine mentioned that
Simpson had asked him to take a
look into them to "see just what was
growing." The grad student laughed
and excitedly showed us a
greenhouse where a caterpillar was
pupating. He neglected to mention
that the caterpillar was also commit
ting a 314 (that's indecent exposure).
Wow. Mal-mish to plants, a horse
skeleton, a pupating caterpillar guilty
of indecent exposure — and the
was young!
After a predictable false fire alarm
in front of Branner Hall, the rest of
the shift passed quietly and a bit
more seriously. Levine showed me
where two of the rapes committed
last year had occurred. It was a sober
ing experience to be where a violent
crime had been committed, even
months after the fact. The forbid
ding, forested gloom off of Palm
Drive was a stark reminder of what
much of police work is really like:
lonely, in its lack of appreciation;
threatening, simply by definition;
and unknown, demanding alertness
and adaptability.
"The goal of every officer is to sim
ply go home alive," Levine said in a
serious tone. Stanford police, de
spite the tame nature of campus,
must be ready to respond profes
sionally to any situation, violent or
not. But when it is tame, they have a
good time.
(Editor's note: Daily reporter Nicole
Michaels spent two shifts, one day
shift and one night shift, riding with
Stanford police officers. Her impres
sion of those experiences with Sgt.
Kris Simpson and Officer Ron Levine
follow.)

Kris Simpson
Sergeant Kris Simpson is not a
stereo-typical "butch" woman of
ficer, nor is she a "Charlie's Angel."
A description of Simpson must lie
somewhere in between. Her speech
reflects her college education and
her field — articulate yet oddly
coarse. Her manner is professional,
even tough, yet her sensitivity is evi
dent when she hovers over an in
jured animal.
She is adventurous and she likes
her job.
The danger associated with police
work is seldom disputed and widely
known; but the extreme levels of
stress involved are often underesti
mated by outsiders. Simpson said
she finds three factors particularly
draining: first, an officer experiences
a number of adrenalin climbs in a
single shift out offearalone. Because
of the potential for conflict, the
police officer has reason to fear even
the routine car stop. Second, the
scene of a bad accident is distressing.
And finally, even "boring" days are
stressful because the police officer
must be alert to a constantly chang
ing environment that might explode
at any moment.
With this is mind we pulled onto
Palm Drive. It was unclear what the
day would hold for Simpson and me.
We first spotted an old, orange
pick-up truck without a bed, spewing
smelly gray muffler smoke and mis
sing its rear license plate. "This'll be a
good stop," Simpson said with a
chuckle, notifying the dispatcher
that we were making a "car stop."
A chubby man clambered down
from the driver's seat and barked:
"Yesh, ma'am." A suddenly stiffer,
more distant Simpson addressed the
young man, and for once I was glad I
was on the other side of the scene.
The man fished for his driver's
license and vehicle registration and
pulled a California plate from the
glove compartment. From the truck,
the driver's friend caught my eye and
