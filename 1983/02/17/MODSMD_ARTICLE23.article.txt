# Critics question artificial heart prospects
## 
### KATHY OLMSTED Senior staff writer 
On December 2, 1982, Barney Clark, a retired de
ntist from Seattle, became the first human recipient
of a permanent artificial heart, but critics here say
they wonder if the initial euphoria over Clark's opera
tion is warranted.
Some questioned the wisdom of the decision to
implant the heart before more testing was con
ducted, others the use of federal funds to develop
mechanisms which can only be afforded by the weal
thy. Another criticism raised involved the equity of
spending $200 million on such a device with uncer
tain prospects while other established research areas
were neglected.
History Prof. Barton Bernstein is an outspoken critic
of the emphasis placed on such "heroic" biomedical
innovations at the expense of other fields. In the Jan.
22 issue of The Nation, Bernstein castigated the cost,
the priorities, and the lack of Congressional scrutiny
of the artificial heart program.
Bernstein's article stemmed from research he did
as part of a program on medical innovations and
public policy at the Medical School. The program,
which is funded by a grant from the National Science
Foundation, will be publishing a book containing the
results of its research into the public policy ramifica
tions of certain biomedical innovations.
In an interview with the Daily, Bernstein warned
that Americans should be wary of indulging in such a
"high-tech fix to a problem which can be seen in
other ways." American biomedical research priorities
are distorted, he said, when the federal government
spends so much money on "episodic, dramatic" and
heroic medical innovations while neglecting the
structural problems in the environment that contri
bute to disease.
Bernstein said he fears that the priority given to

such dramatic innovations will result in less money
for preventive medicine. Americans need to discover
why they have certain diseases and how to prevent
them, Bernstein said, and not merely treat them
symptomatically.
But Americans have a profound "reluctance to look
at structural matters," Bernstein said, and prefer
heroic medicine" to the more routine preventive
medicine. "We save the dramatic case, but we lose
more people," he said.

Bernstein warned that Americans
should be wary of indulging in
such a 'high-tech fix to a problem
which can be seen in other ways/
American biomedical research
priorities are distorted, he said.

Diana Dutton, assistant sociology professor and
the director of the medical innovations program, said
the predilection for heroic medicine is indicative of a
"general bias that pervades our society." Dutton said
Americans seem to prefer spending money on such
dramatic cases because the personal element in
heroic medicine is more attractive than the broadly
impersonal strategies of preventive medicine, and
because our society tends to look for innovations
which will bring profit, not require social change.
One problem now facing the artificial heart prog
ram is whether the federal government should fund
the implantation of all artificial hearts, as it does kid
ney dialysis treatments, and if so where that money

will come from.
Bernstein said he didn't know if the government
will expend the vast amount of money necessary to
fund the artificial heart program.
"I think it's very hard to know the answer to that,"
he said. But he added that the Reagan administration
will probably not have to face the issue: the implanta
tion of artificial hearts will continue to be "an occa
sional activity" until an implantable power source can
be found, Bernstein said, and so the funding debate
will not emerge for several years.
Dutton said it was unlikely that the artificial heart
implants will be federally funded. This lack of federal
funding raises "fundamental questions about
equity," she said, because the device, developed al
most entirely with federal funds, will only be available
to the wealthy.
Bernstein has estimated that the artificial heart
program might cost between $1.6 and $b.6 billion
annually, based on projected numbers of recipients
and the current cost of implantation. Some critics
have contended that this estimate is not valid because
the cost of the device will come down as it is im
proved, but Bernstein said the price of the actual
mechanism is only a small part of the overall cost.
Bernstein also criticized the absence of Congres
sional scrutiny of the program. By tailing to oversee
the artificial heart program adequately, Congress
eventually allowed the program to lag more than a
decade behind schedule and to soar 500 percent over
budget, he said. This lack of scrutiny stems from a
tendency for Americans to regard medicine as a "bas
tion of art and expertise," Bernstein said.
Both Bernstein and Dutton emphasized that
Americans will face some hard choices in the next few
years concerning the allocation of resources for
health care. "We don't live in an ideal world, and not
everything is funded," Bernstein said.
