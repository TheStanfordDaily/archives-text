# Economics pose formidable barriers to independent film-makers

Perhaps the art that affects the most
people today is film. Independent producer
Stephen Breimer and Communication Prof.
Henry Breitrose both recognize film as "a
very powerful media," but one to which stu
dent artists have limited access.
For all the potential of film as an art,
"movies are very expensive to make," Breit
rose stressed. "The best hope for a small
artist is to write poetry," he said. Breitrose
explained that as a result of shrinking discre
tionary income, people tend to be highly
selective about what movies to attend.
Graduate Stephen Breimer, who recently
wrote and produced the horror film Night
warning, feels financial constraints acutely.
While budgets for major studio films hover
around 10 million, the independently pro
duced Nightwarning cost only 1 million.
There is no doubt that low budget is the
major obstacle for independent film

makers. "I would want to write a lot of
scenes that took the film out of the scope of
a very isolated environment," Breimer said,
"but because of budgetary limitations, there
are certain scenes you can't write."
Nevertheless, Breimer pointed out op
timistically that Nightwarning is "being re
leased like a big studio picture." Currently,
it plays at 35 theaters in San Francisco.
Nightwarning, Breimer's first major produc
tion, recently won the Academy of Science
Fiction, Fantasy, and Horror Films awarded
as one of the best horror pictures of 1982.
Breimer is positive about his future making
movies. "Independent film-making is going
to become stronger over the years. The cost
is getting so high at the studios that people
are going to be looking more and more to
the independent film-makers," he said.
Breitrose, however, sees great limitations
on independent film-makers. "The problem

is keeping production costs in proportion
with the potential size of the market," he
said. Since the "majority of films made tend
not to command a large audience," the
amount of money an independent producer
like Breimer can work with is "extremely
low."
Both Breitrose and Breimer cite the grow
ing cable television industry as a potential
market. Breimer is particularly positive.
"They're very open to new ideas," he said,
adding that "it's a very good time for writers
to come in, totally unheard of, who've never
been tried before, to do something."
Breaking into the movie-making business
is difficult, according to Breimer. "When
you start out it is a totally different field. It
takes working in it for awhile to get to know
the people involved and to get to know how
it operates," he explained. "You have to be
willing to learn everything and work very
hard for very little money." Breitrose com

mented that, in general, movie-making
takes "a person with great confidence and
extraordinary ambition."
Rather than social criticism, political or
ideological statements, Breimer's goai is
primarily to entertain. For Breimer, "it's very
important that the film be something com
mercial," because "it's easier to sell."
People show great interest in simple enter
tainment films. While Breimer doesn't want
to produce mindless escapism, he is at the
same time highly conscious of the business
like nature of the movie industry.
Whatever the lofty intentions of other
arts, Breimer stressed that "movie-making is
show business." He explained that "a movie
that has a message may be a wonderful film,
but if nobody's interested in watching it, it's
a failure.
Breitrose, however, insists that a good
film must "go beyond" the precondition of
entertainment "to explore what it means to

be human." He questions the role and the
effects of film in our society. "The artist has
no social obligation except not to hurt
people," he said, but "perhaps one ought to
think very seriously about gratuitous vio
lence." In films today, he pointed out, "it's
bad to show love, but O.K. to show killing."
Breitrose, who had not seen Breimer's
Nightwarning, commented on horror films
in general. "They prey on people's sub
conscious fears," he said, remarking thai
personally, "I'm not entertained by being
scared." "I really don't find it enlightening
to show people dismembered, as in The
Texas Cham Saw Massacrehe said. A gooc
horror film, such as Invasion of the Bodys
natchers, doesn't just involve "aliens com<
ing down to have humans for lunch," ex>
plained Breitrose, but goes on to make i
statement about the human condition.
There may be no more visible place for
such statements, than in the movies.
