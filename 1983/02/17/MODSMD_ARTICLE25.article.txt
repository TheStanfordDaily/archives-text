It's a common misconcep
tion of students that University
Police officers are merely secu
rity guards.
Vet Stanford police officers
are deputized by the Santa
Clara County Sheriff — a fact
that sets the University De
partment of Public Safety apart
from law enforcement services
on other private (ampuses.
It is common for public uni
versities to be served by a gov
ernment police force, but rare
for a private institution, ac
cording to University Police
Chief Marvin Herrington. State
law does not provide for a pri
vate organization such as Stan
ford to set up a police force.
Accordingly, Stanford had a
Public Safety Department until
the early 70s, but it wasn't de
putized — invested with the
powers of the Sheriff. Since
Stanford was not an incorpo

officers by wanting to help the public and

rated town — it still isn't — the
ultimate responsibility for law
enforcement lay with the
county sheriff. Stanford was
just part of the "North County
Beat."
Hoping to upgrade service,
Herrington composed

"Memorandum of Under
standing" in 1971 which, with
the agreement of the Santa
Clara County Sheriff, granted
deputization rights to the Stan
ford Public Safety Department.
The department has ex
panded considerably since

'It is common for public universities to be
served by a government police force, but
rare for a private institution/

1971, with three to four officers
on call at all times.
Officers must meet the high
standards expected during a
lengthy selection process.
The application screening
takes about two to three
months and includes a written
exam, oral interview, psychiat-

ric exam, physical ability lest
and extensive background in
vestigation, Herrington said.
Following screening, if the
applicant is approved by the
sheriff, he is sent to the police
academy (probably in Gilroy,
Calif.) for 13 weeks.

For nine weeks after gradua
tion from the academy, a
three-part field training pro
gram is conducted. First the re
cruit accompanies an experi
enced officer who explains
procedures while the trainee
assists. Then the two switch
roles, and the trainee initiates

actions and is corrected by the
officer. Finally, the training of
ficer dons plain clothes and
passively evaluates the recruit
while he is on assignment.
About 25 percent of the
people are eliminated in the
process. "Generally people are
motivated (to become police
officers) by wanting to help the
public and they're kind of
crushed when they find that
the public doesn't really like
the service. The reaction of of
ficers is that they become
negative toward the public.
The feeling is 'nobody ap
preciates what I'm doing,' "
Harrington said. This and other
negative tendencies that make
an individual unsuited for law
enforcement are usually iden
tified during the training pro
gram, he added.
About half the department is
comprised of community ser
vice and clerical positions. The
remaining 30 or so employees
are law enforcement officers,
organized into two divisions:
detective and patrol.
