# Israeli policy regretted

### ALYA AL-MUFTI 
The conclusions of the Israeli
committee investigating the mas
sacres at Sabra and Chatilla will not
change Israel's present policy of ex
pansion and colonization, said Dr.
Matti Peled, professor of Arab
studies at the University of Tel Aviv
and a leader of Israel's peace move
ment.
Addressing more than 200 people
at the First Congregational Church in
Palo Alto last Saturday, the retired
major-general in the Israeli Defense
Forces said, "After the storm is over,
we will be facing the same govern
ment, with the same goals.
"The (Israeli) government will feel
free to pursue policies that brought
about the invasion in Lebanon, the
massacres and our involvement in
Lebanon now — without the interest
of the state of Israel."
Asked whether he was "insinuat
ing" that the massacre was premedi
tated, Peled said, "When a judicial
committee rejects a body of evi
dence that is brought before it, they
should explain why, referring to the
evidence that was flatly rejected,
without analysis, by the committee."
"The report leaves questions un
answered," Peled said. The commit
tee found it "reasonable that Israeli
commanders sent Phalangists in
order to spare the lives of Israeli sol
diers."
He added, "The implication is that
the Phalangists were sent to fight
armed forces," Peled said, but no
armed forces were found in the
camps. I believe if there had been
(armed forces), the Phalange would
not have moved in."
Peled said the "most regretable"
policy of Israel has been the desire,
after 1967, to expand territorially.
This has been implemented through
the establishment of settlements in
new territories, confiscation of land
and water resources, deportation of
Palestinian leaders who protested
against these policies and the Bigger
Jerusalem Project.
East Jerusalem is a small urban area

of about one square mile. This was
annexed in 1967, Peled said. Arab vil
lages which were not part of
lerusalem were also annexed as part
of Fast lerusalem, as is "an area of 25
percent of the West Rank,'' as part of
the Bigger lerusalem Project.
Peled said he advocates the crea
tion of an independent Palestinian
state alongside the state of Israel.
"Ignoring the rights of the Palesti
nians is an invitation for future fight
ing. The situation makes war inevita
ble in the future," he said.
Peled added that this need not be
the case, because most of the wars
up to 1 967 were fought while Arab
policy was the denial of the existence
of the state of Israel. "But since then,
the Arab world has wanted peace,
with a solution to the Palestinian
problem," he said.
This desire, which was first made
public during the Baghdad summit
meeting following Camp David, was
recently affirmed by Iraqi President
Saddam Hussain, Peled said. The
wars since 1%7 have been "immoral.
(A) sheer waste of lives and re
sources," he said.
The Israeli reaction to the Arab
resolution for peace was the same
reaction to Anwar Sadat's first peace
offer in 1971. "Golda Meier said it
was a 'trick. They (Arabs) wanted to
destroy Israel.' This unrestricted
demagoguary is repeated so often
people begin to believe it," Peled
said.
Peled and two other Israelis, Uri
Avneri, a journalist, and Yaacov Ar
non, the former governor of the
Bank of Israel, recently met with
Palestinine liberation Organization
Chairman Yassir Arafat.
The two sides "reviewed the situa
tion and discussed the different posi
tions and expectations," Peled said,
declining to state where the meeting
had been held.
The PLO is determined to continue
the effort to achieve a political solu
tion, realizing it is a slim chance
against the Begin government, Peled
said.
