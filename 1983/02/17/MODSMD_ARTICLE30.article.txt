## Confused 'Frances' bio—how not to make a movie 
### STEVE VINEBERG 
Considering that her role in Frances
requires her to throw close to a dozen
hysterical fits, wallow in mud, be
drugged and lobotomized and gang
raped by soldiers, Jessica Lange survives
the ordeal remarkably well.
Extravagant forms of suffering (Susan
Hayward's specialty in the '50s) often
guarantee an actress an Academy
Award nomination, but they reduce her
to obstacle course acting: the salient
questions become "How do I maintain
my character through 20 minutes of
screaming tantrums?" and "How do I
vary the fits so the audience won't grow
tired of watching me?"
As Frances Farmer, the ostensibly
gifted young movie star who, possibly
because of her social and political non
conformism, was institutionalized for 8
years and was likely a guinea pig for a
late-'4os experiment in transorbital
lobotomy, Lange is about as effective as
anyone could be under the circum
stances. There is authentic rage in her
explosions, and you can see the banked
fires of pride and independence in her
quiet scenes, as well as intelligence and
irony. Her readings of lines like "I'm not
a glamor girl" (to a studio publicist) and
"Can't you find a more dignified way to
make a living?" (to a gossip columnist's
flunky) have an unusual texture, and
they reverberate, as they're intended
to, through the hollow Hollywood
milieu Farmer found so irrelevant and
so suffocating.
In the post-lobotomy scenes Lange
really achieves something great. She
talks haltingly, with a quiver in her
voice, and she holds the right side of
her face numb; she keeps tipping
herself to one side, as if that were the
only way she could jog the motor in her
dulled brain. We can see that there's
sprit still inside her, butthatit'stoofirm
ly encased in layers of cobwebs to burst
forth.
If all of this doesn't quite add up to a
performance, no one can fault Lange,
who must have drawn on all her in
genuity just to keep from sinking with
the rest of the movie. Watching
Frances, you'd never guess that the
writers (Eric Bergren and Christopher
DeVore) last worked on The Elephant
Man, or that the debut director
(Graeme Clifford) is one of the most im
aginative editors in the business. (He
cut Images for Robert Altman, Don't
Look Now and The Man Who Fell to
Earth for Nicolas Roeg, and Convoy for
Sam Peckinpah.) The film is a wretched
mess — structurally, dramatically, psy

chologically. There's no way of de
termining why the filmmakers chose to
distribute screen time as they did: it
seems purely arbitrary that we hear
teenage Frances' scandalous prize-win
ning essay on the non-existence of God
in its entirety (and stretched over four
scenes) while herentirefirstyearin Hol
lywood is telescoped into an equal
amount of space, or that her initial,
brief stint in a private sanatarium is
treated in as much detail as her long,
horrendous incarceration in a Seattle
state institution.
Her disastrous marriage to leading
man Leif Erickson (here called Duane
Richardson and played, very badly, by
Christopher Pennock) is introduced
almost in an apologetic footnote — as if
it had been accidentally omitted — and
her crucial relationships with her un
stable, ambitious mother (Kim Stanley)
and her ineffectual, absentee father
(Bart Burns) are full of contradictions.
The filmmakers don't appear to have
any attitude at all to the elder Farmers,
or any theory about the extent to which
they were responsible for the disinte
gration of their daughter's life; they
haven't even decided how much she
felt they were to blame. Lillian Farmer
has equally weighted moments of ma
ternal support and predatory
malevolence; Ernest Farmer is a timid,
loving father in one scene, and in the
next Frances berates him and (since no
where does the film hint that Frances
may have really been crazy) we are
clearly meant to sympathize with her
outrage.
Frances Farmer's fascinating, horren
dous story was first treated in a highly
suspect autobiography, Will There Re
ally Be a Morning?, which was almost
certainly ghostwritten and was, in fact,
completed after her death from cancer
in 1961. (A TV movie version airs next
week.) This volume contains disturbing
gaps and obvious inaccuracies, as well
as a number of unexplained incidents
(at least one of which — the confisca
tion of her belongings when she got in
trouble with the police in Mexico —
made it into Bergren and DeVore's
script). A lateraccount by journalist Wil
liam Arnold called Shadowland is well
researched and addresses the question
of how an intelligent, successful young
woman could have been locked up for
nearly a decade on shockingly flimsy ev
idence of insanity. Arnold makes some
astonishing suggestions about the para
noia of right-wing groups in Seattle dur
ing the Depression (Frances was in
volved with a number of socialist causes
and worked with the unabashedly lef

tist Group Theater in New York be
tween movies), the naivete of Ameri
cans in this period about Hollywood,
and the status and megalomania of the
psychiatric profession in the post-war
years.
Bergren and DeVore don't pick up on
any of these issues, though. They skip
the political angle entirely, the one psy
chiatrist we meet (Dr. Symington,
played by Lane Smith) is such a con
descending monster that he takes us
right back to The Snake Pit, and the Hol
lywood scenes are an incom
prehensible botch. They verge on
parody — and perhaps they're sup
posed to be taken that way, because not
a single moment in them feels convinc
ing.
Clifford and the screenwriters have
erred in every conceivable way in this
movie. (They even misspell Joel
McCrea's name on the marquee at the
premiere of his movie with Farmer,
Come and Get It. When Frances spots a
crowd of hoboes huddled around a fire,
she protests, "How can I make movies
when people are starving?" — it's one
of those embarrassingly simpleminded
scenes of instantaneous consciousness
raising in movies, like Billie Holiday in
Lady Sings the Blues discovering her ra
cial identity when she sees a lynch mob
victim, or Sybylla in My Brilliant Career
rejecting an offer of marriage because
the hungry tramps on the Australian
back roads have inspired her to try and
find out what's wrong with the world
first.
When we meet Harold Clurman (Jor
dan Charney) and Clifford Odets (Jef
frey DeMunn) of the Group Theater,
we recognize them immediately be
cause they are the only members of the
audience at Frances' summer stock per
formance of The Petrified Forest who
aren't enjoying themselves; these
high-minded socialists carry the weight
of the world on their shoulders. The
camera zeroes in on Odets' face when
he announces the name of the play he
wants Frances to star in — Golden Boy
— so that we register that theatrical his
tory is being made. Clifford shows us
how decadent and frivolous Odets real
ly is by having him scatter rose petals on
the bed before making love to Frances,
and shows us how little the members of
the Group Theater really care about the
working classes by having them saunter
unmoved past a desperate young wom
an begging in the streets. (These distor
tions aren't half as offensive as the fact
that Clurman, one of the great pathfin
ders in the history of American natural
istic acting, is played by an actor who in

sists on giving a gross display of mug-^
ging-)
Clifford goes in for painful, ersatz-ex- •
pressionist close-ups of Dr. Symington r,
crushing out Frances' cigarette or grind
ing a pencil through a sharpener, and
thissame lack of subtlety manifests itself
in every part of Kim Stanley s
grotesque, scenery-chewing per
formance, which a sensitive director
would have toned down. Stanley looks
appalling — the hollows under her eyes
are as big as the eyes themselves, and
her wig, dropped unceremoniously on
top of her head, suggests the long
planned revenge of an embittered coif
feur. And she rips into the part of Lillian
Farmer as if it were a pie-eating contest
with bonus points awarded for slurping.
She seems to be saying, "All this ugli
ness is true life, folks, and I'm going to
show you that a real actress isn't afraid
to rub her nose in it."
This kind of misplaced zeal — which
gives method acting a bad name
always gets the same results: we don't
believe a word of it. (Check out any per
formance Gena Rowlands has ever giv
en.) Kim Stanley has been off the screen
since the 1964 Seance on a Wet After
noon, and she seems to want to sand
wich all the parts she hasn't played in
those 18 years into Lillian; as a result,
her acting (which has always suffered
from lack of control) flies in all direc
tions.
Not content with raiding the archives
for mistakes other filmmakers have
made before them, Clifford, Bergren
and DeVore have actually invented
one. Sam Shepard is cast as Harry York,
Frances' first lover, who shows up mys
teriously whenever she is in the throes
of a crisis — to beat up a reporter, or to
spring her from one institution or an
other. Since Harry York is a fabrication
of the writers, we have to ask what on
earth he's doing in the picture: did they
think that we wouldn't sympathize with
Frances unless they provided her with a
combination champion-interpreter?
Shepard has a fine face for the cam
era, and he's been good in other movies
(Days of Heaven, Resurrection, but
even Brando couldn't make this in
scrutable non-role work. After the final
scene of the movie, a postscript tells us
that Harry wasn't with Frances when she
died — surely the most bizarre piece of
information that ever concluded a mov
ie biography, considering that Harry
York never existed except in the film
makers' minds. Is this a joke, or do these
men have a problem distinguishing be
tween fact and fiction? Frances pro
vides no answer.

anyone could be under the circum
stances. There is authentic rage in her
explosions, and you can see the banked
fires of pride and independence in her
quiet scenes, as well as intelligence and
irony. Her readings of lines like "I'm not
a glamor girl" (to a studio publicist) and
"Can't you find a more dignified way to
make a living?" (to a gossip columnist's
flunky) have an unusual texture, and
they reverberate, as they're intended
to, through the hollow Hollywood
milieu Farmer found so irrelevant and
so suffocating.
In the post-lobotomy scenes Lange
really achieves something great. She
talks haltingly, with a quiver in her
voice, and she holds the right side of
her face numb; she keeps tipping
herself to one side, as if that were the
only way she could jog the motor in her
dulled brain. We can see that there's
sprit still inside her, butthatit'stoofirm
ly encased in layers of cobwebs to burst
forth.
If all of this doesn't quite add up to a
performance, no one can fault Lange,
who must have drawn on all her in
genuity just to keep from sinking with
the rest of the movie. Watching
Frances, you'd never guess that the
writers (Eric Bergren and Christopher
DeVore) last worked on The Elephant
Man, or that the debut director
(Graeme Clifford) is one of the most im
aginative editors in the business. (He
cut Images for Robert Altman, Don't
Look Now and The Man Who Fell to
Earth for Nicolas Roeg, and Convoy for
Sam Peckinpah.) The film is a wretched
mess — structurally, dramatically, psy

chologically. There's no way of de
termining why the filmmakers chose to
distribute screen time as they did: it
seems purely arbitrary that we hear
teenage Frances' scandalous prize-win
ning essay on the non-existence of God
in its entirety (and stretched over four
scenes) while herentirefirstyearin Hol
lywood is telescoped into an equal
amount of space, or that her initial,
brief stint in a private sanatarium is
treated in as much detail as her long,
horrendous incarceration in a Seattle
state institution.
Her disastrous marriage to leading
man Leif Erickson (here called Duane
Richardson and played, very badly, by
Christopher Pennock) is introduced
almost in an apologetic footnote — as if
it had been accidentally omitted — and
her crucial relationships with her un
stable, ambitious mother (Kim Stanley)
and her ineffectual, absentee father
(Bart Burns) are full of contradictions.
The filmmakers don't appear to have
any attitude at all to the elder Farmers,
or any theory about the extent to which
they were responsible for the disinte
gration of their daughter's life; they
haven't even decided how much she
felt they were to blame. Lillian Farmer
has equally weighted moments of ma
ternal support and predatory
malevolence; Ernest Farmer is a timid,
loving father in one scene, and in the
next Frances berates him and (since no
where does the film hint that Frances
may have really been crazy) we are
clearly meant to sympathize with her
outrage.
Frances Farmer's fascinating, horren
dous story was first treated in a highly
suspect autobiography, Will There Re
ally Be a Morning?, which was almost
certainly ghostwritten and was, in fact,
completed after her death from cancer
in 1961. (A TV movie version airs next
week.) This volume contains disturbing
gaps and obvious inaccuracies, as well
as a number of unexplained incidents
(at least one of which — the confisca
tion of her belongings when she got in
trouble with the police in Mexico —
made it into Bergren and DeVore's
script). A lateraccount by journalist Wil
liam Arnold called Shadowland is well
researched and addresses the question
of how an intelligent, successful young
woman could have been locked up for
nearly a decade on shockingly flimsy ev
idence of insanity. Arnold makes some
astonishing suggestions about the para
noia of right-wing groups in Seattle dur
ing the Depression (Frances was in
volved with a number of socialist causes
and worked with the unabashedly lef

tist Group Theater in New York be
tween movies), the naivete of Ameri
cans in this period about Hollywood,
and the status and megalomania of the
psychiatric profession in the post-war
years.
Bergren and DeVore don't pick up on
any of these issues, though. They skip
the political angle entirely, the one psy
chiatrist we meet (Dr. Symington,
played by Lane Smith) is such a con
descending monster that he takes us
right back to The Snake Pit, and the Hol
lywood scenes are an incom
prehensible botch. They verge on
parody — and perhaps they're sup
posed to be taken that way, because not
a single moment in them feels convinc
ing.
Clifford and the screenwriters have
erred in every conceivable way in this
movie. (They even misspell Joel
McCrea's name on the marquee at the
premiere of his movie with Farmer,
Come and Get It. When Frances spots a
crowd of hoboes huddled around a fire,
she protests, "How can I make movies
when people are starving?" — it's one
of those embarrassingly simpleminded
scenes of instantaneous consciousness
raising in movies, like Billie Holiday in
Lady Sings the Blues discovering her ra
cial identity when she sees a lynch mob
victim, or Sybylla in My Brilliant Career
rejecting an offer of marriage because
the hungry tramps on the Australian
back roads have inspired her to try and
find out what's wrong with the world
first.
When we meet Harold Clurman (Jor
dan Charney) and Clifford Odets (Jef
frey DeMunn) of the Group Theater,
we recognize them immediately be
cause they are the only members of the
audience at Frances' summer stock per
formance of The Petrified Forest who
aren't enjoying themselves; these
high-minded socialists carry the weight
of the world on their shoulders. The
camera zeroes in on Odets' face when
he announces the name of the play he
wants Frances to star in — Golden Boy
— so that we register that theatrical his
tory is being made. Clifford shows us
how decadent and frivolous Odets real
ly is by having him scatter rose petals on
the bed before making love to Frances,
and shows us how little the members of
the Group Theater really care about the
working classes by having them saunter
unmoved past a desperate young wom
an begging in the streets. (These distor
tions aren't half as offensive as the fact
that Clurman, one of the great pathfin
ders in the history of American natural
istic acting, is played by an actor who in

sists on giving a gross display of mug-^
ging-)
Clifford goes in for painful, ersatz-ex- •
pressionist close-ups of Dr. Symington r,
crushing out Frances' cigarette or grind
ing a pencil through a sharpener, and
thissame lack of subtlety manifests itself
in every part of Kim Stanley s
grotesque, scenery-chewing per
formance, which a sensitive director
would have toned down. Stanley looks
appalling — the hollows under her eyes
are as big as the eyes themselves, and
her wig, dropped unceremoniously on
top of her head, suggests the long
planned revenge of an embittered coif
feur. And she rips into the part of Lillian
Farmer as if it were a pie-eating contest
with bonus points awarded for slurping.
She seems to be saying, "All this ugli
ness is true life, folks, and I'm going to
show you that a real actress isn't afraid
to rub her nose in it."
This kind of misplaced zeal — which
gives method acting a bad name
always gets the same results: we don't
believe a word of it. (Check out any per
formance Gena Rowlands has ever giv
en.) Kim Stanley has been off the screen
since the 1964 Seance on a Wet After
noon, and she seems to want to sand
wich all the parts she hasn't played in
those 18 years into Lillian; as a result,
her acting (which has always suffered
from lack of control) flies in all direc
tions.
Not content with raiding the archives
for mistakes other filmmakers have
made before them, Clifford, Bergren
and DeVore have actually invented
one. Sam Shepard is cast as Harry York,
Frances' first lover, who shows up mys
teriously whenever she is in the throes
of a crisis — to beat up a reporter, or to
spring her from one institution or an
other. Since Harry York is a fabrication
of the writers, we have to ask what on
earth he's doing in the picture: did they
think that we wouldn't sympathize with
Frances unless they provided her with a
combination champion-interpreter?
Shepard has a fine face for the cam
era, and he's been good in other movies
(Days of Heaven, Resurrection, but
even Brando couldn't make this in
scrutable non-role work. After the final
scene of the movie, a postscript tells us
that Harry wasn't with Frances when she
died — surely the most bizarre piece of
information that ever concluded a mov
ie biography, considering that Harry
York never existed except in the film
makers' minds. Is this a joke, or do these
men have a problem distinguishing be
tween fact and fiction? Frances pro
vides no answer.


Jessica Lange as Frances Farmer in "Frances." '
■ ' '*• • 112
Considering that her role in Frances
requires her to throw close to a dozen
hysterical fits, wallow in mud, be
drugged and lobotomized and gang
raped by soldiers, Jessica Lange survives
the ordeal remarkably well.
Extravagant forms of suffering (Susan
Hayward's specialty in the '50s) often
guarantee an actress an Academy
Award nomination, but they reduce her
to obstacle course acting: the salient
questions become "How do I maintain
my character through 20 minutes of
screaming tantrums?" and "How do I
vary the fits so the audience won't grow
tired of watching me?"
As Frances Farmer, the ostensibly
gifted young movie star who, possibly
because of her social and political non
conformism, was institutionalized for 8
years and was likely a guinea pig for a
late-'4os experiment in transorbital
lobotomy, Lange is about as effective as
anyone could be under the circum
stances. There is authentic rage in her
explosions, and you can see the banked
fires of pride and independence in her
quiet scenes, as well as intelligence and
irony. Her readings of lines like "I'm not
a glamor girl" (to a studio publicist) and
"Can't you find a more dignified way to

sprit still inside her, butthatit'stoofirm
ly encased in layers of cobwebs to burst
forth.
If all of this doesn't quite add up to a
performance, no one can fault Lange,
who must have drawn on all her in
genuity just to keep from sinking with
the rest of the movie. Watching
Frances, you'd never guess that the
writers (Eric Bergren and Christopher
DeVore) last worked on The Elephant
Man, or that the debut director
(Graeme Clifford) is one of the most im
aginative editors in the business. (He
cut Images for Robert Altman, Don't
Look Now and The Man Who Fell to
Earth for Nicolas Roeg, and Convoy for
Sam Peckinpah.) The film is a wretched
mess — structurally, dramatically, psy

chologically. There's no way of de
termining why the filmmakers chose to
distribute screen time as they did: it
seems purely arbitrary that we hear
teenage Frances' scandalous prize-win
ning essay on the non-existence of God
in its entirety (and stretched over four
scenes) while herentirefirstyearin Hol
lywood is telescoped into an equal
amount of space, or that her initial,
brief stint in a private sanatarium is
treated in as much detail as her long,
horrendous incarceration in a Seattle
state institution.
Her disastrous marriage to leading
man Leif Erickson (here called Duane
Richardson and played, very badly, by
Christopher Pennock) is introduced
almost in an apologetic footnote — as if
it had been accidentally omitted — and
her crucial relationships with her un
stable, ambitious mother (Kim Stanley)
and her ineffectual, absentee father
(Bart Burns) are full of contradictions.
The filmmakers don't appear to have
any attitude at all to the elder Farmers,
or any theory about the extent to which
they were responsible for the disinte
gration of their daughter's life; they
haven't even decided how much she
felt they were to blame. Lillian Farmer
has equally weighted moments of ma
ternal support and predatory
malevolence; Ernest Farmer is a timid,
loving father in one scene, and in the
next Frances berates him and (since no
where does the film hint that Frances
may have really been crazy) we are
clearly meant to sympathize with her
outrage.
Frances Farmer's fascinating, horren
dous story was first treated in a highly
suspect autobiography, Will There Re
ally Be a Morning?, which was almost
certainly ghostwritten and was, in fact,
completed after her death from cancer
in 1961. (A TV movie version airs next
week.) This volume contains disturbing
gaps and obvious inaccuracies, as well
as a number of unexplained incidents
(at least one of which — the confisca
tion of her belongings when she got in
trouble with the police in Mexico —
made it into Bergren and DeVore's
script). A lateraccount by journalist Wil
liam Arnold called Shadowland is well
researched and addresses the question
of how an intelligent, successful young
woman could have been locked up for
nearly a decade on shockingly flimsy ev
idence of insanity. Arnold makes some
astonishing suggestions about the para
noia of right-wing groups in Seattle dur
ing the Depression (Frances was in
volved with a number of socialist causes
and worked with the unabashedly lef

tist Group Theater in New York be
tween movies), the naivete of Ameri
cans in this period about Hollywood,
and the status and megalomania of the
psychiatric profession in the post-war
years.
Bergren and DeVore don't pick up on
any of these issues, though. They skip
the political angle entirely, the one psy
chiatrist we meet (Dr. Symington,
played by Lane Smith) is such a con
descending monster that he takes us
right back to The Snake Pit, and the Hol
lywood scenes are an incom
prehensible botch. They verge on
parody — and perhaps they're sup
posed to be taken that way, because not
a single moment in them feels convinc
ing.
Clifford and the screenwriters have
erred in every conceivable way in this
movie. (They even misspell Joel
McCrea's name on the marquee at the
premiere of his movie with Farmer,
Come and Get It. When Frances spots a
crowd of hoboes huddled around a fire,
she protests, "How can I make movies
when people are starving?" — it's one
of those embarrassingly simpleminded
scenes of instantaneous consciousness
raising in movies, like Billie Holiday in
Lady Sings the Blues discovering her ra
cial identity when she sees a lynch mob
victim, or Sybylla in My Brilliant Career
rejecting an offer of marriage because
the hungry tramps on the Australian
back roads have inspired her to try and
find out what's wrong with the world
first.
When we meet Harold Clurman (Jor
dan Charney) and Clifford Odets (Jef
frey DeMunn) of the Group Theater,
we recognize them immediately be
cause they are the only members of the
audience at Frances' summer stock per
formance of The Petrified Forest who
aren't enjoying themselves; these
high-minded socialists carry the weight
of the world on their shoulders. The
camera zeroes in on Odets' face when
he announces the name of the play he
wants Frances to star in — Golden Boy
— so that we register that theatrical his
tory is being made. Clifford shows us
how decadent and frivolous Odets real
ly is by having him scatter rose petals on
the bed before making love to Frances,
and shows us how little the members of
the Group Theater really care about the
working classes by having them saunter
unmoved past a desperate young wom
an begging in the streets. (These distor
tions aren't half as offensive as the fact
that Clurman, one of the great pathfin
ders in the history of American natural
istic acting, is played by an actor who in

sists on giving a gross display of mug-^
ging-)
Clifford goes in for painful, ersatz-ex- •
pressionist close-ups of Dr. Symington r,
crushing out Frances' cigarette or grind
ing a pencil through a sharpener, and
thissame lack of subtlety manifests itself
in every part of Kim Stanley s
grotesque, scenery-chewing per
formance, which a sensitive director
would have toned down. Stanley looks
appalling — the hollows under her eyes
are as big as the eyes themselves, and
her wig, dropped unceremoniously on
top of her head, suggests the long
planned revenge of an embittered coif
feur. And she rips into the part of Lillian
Farmer as if it were a pie-eating contest
with bonus points awarded for slurping.
She seems to be saying, "All this ugli
ness is true life, folks, and I'm going to
show you that a real actress isn't afraid
to rub her nose in it."
This kind of misplaced zeal — which
gives method acting a bad name
always gets the same results: we don't
believe a word of it. (Check out any per
formance Gena Rowlands has ever giv
en.) Kim Stanley has been off the screen
since the 1964 Seance on a Wet After
noon, and she seems to want to sand
wich all the parts she hasn't played in
those 18 years into Lillian; as a result,
her acting (which has always suffered
from lack of control) flies in all direc
tions.
Not content with raiding the archives
for mistakes other filmmakers have
made before them, Clifford, Bergren
and DeVore have actually invented
one. Sam Shepard is cast as Harry York,
Frances' first lover, who shows up mys
teriously whenever she is in the throes
of a crisis — to beat up a reporter, or to
spring her from one institution or an
other. Since Harry York is a fabrication
of the writers, we have to ask what on
earth he's doing in the picture: did they
think that we wouldn't sympathize with
Frances unless they provided her with a
combination champion-interpreter?
Shepard has a fine face for the cam
era, and he's been good in other movies
(Days of Heaven, Resurrection, but
even Brando couldn't make this in
scrutable non-role work. After the final
scene of the movie, a postscript tells us
that Harry wasn't with Frances when she
died — surely the most bizarre piece of
information that ever concluded a mov
ie biography, considering that Harry
York never existed except in the film
makers' minds. Is this a joke, or do these
men have a problem distinguishing be
tween fact and fiction? Frances pro
vides no answer.


Jessica Lange as Frances Farmer in "Frances." '
■ ' '*• • 112
Considering that her role in Frances
requires her to throw close to a dozen
hysterical fits, wallow in mud, be
drugged and lobotomized and gang
raped by soldiers, Jessica Lange survives
the ordeal remarkably well.
Extravagant forms of suffering (Susan
Hayward's specialty in the '50s) often
guarantee an actress an Academy
Award nomination, but they reduce her
to obstacle course acting: the salient
questions become "How do I maintain
my character through 20 minutes of
screaming tantrums?" and "How do I
vary the fits so the audience won't grow
tired of watching me?"
As Frances Farmer, the ostensibly
gifted young movie star who, possibly
because of her social and political non
conformism, was institutionalized for 8
years and was likely a guinea pig for a
late-'4os experiment in transorbital
lobotomy, Lange is about as effective as
anyone could be under the circum
stances. There is authentic rage in her
explosions, and you can see the banked
fires of pride and independence in her
quiet scenes, as well as intelligence and
irony. Her readings of lines like "I'm not
a glamor girl" (to a studio publicist) and
"Can't you find a more dignified way to
make a living?" (to a gossip columnist's
flunky) have an unusual texture, and
they reverberate, as they're intended
to, through the hollow Hollywood
milieu Farmer found so irrelevant and
so suffocating.
In the post-lobotomy scenes Lange
really achieves something great. She
talks haltingly, with a quiver in her
voice, and she holds the right side of
her face numb; she keeps tipping
herself to one side, as if that were the
only way she could jog the motor in her
dulled brain. We can see that there's
sprit still inside her, butthatit'stoofirm
ly encased in layers of cobwebs to burst
forth.
