# 'Bites of Passage' play trilogy sort of grows on you
## 
### MAKC FAJER 
As students, most of us see ourselves as
having essentially completed the growing
up process, and as being about to embark on
our adult lives. The growth process
which is yet to come is of little concern, and
if we think about it all, we tend to assume
that it will be merely a continuance and per
fecting of the maturation that has already
occurred. The three one-act plays currently
showing at San Francisco's One Act Theatre
Co. under the joint heading of Riles of Pas
sage examine the growing that goes on after
adolescence. Each focuses on a different as
pect of that process and has interesting in
sights to offer those of us on the brink.
The tirst of the three, Adaptation by Elaine
May, presents the life of a somewhat typical
middle class American in the framework of a
game show complete with spinning wheels,
flashing boxes, funny costumes and a snide
announcer. The object of the game is to find
the hidden security square, though, as the
emcee points out at the start, unbeknownst
to the contestant, he can win at any time by
naming any square the security square and
declaring himself the winner. Phil, the con
testant (C.J. Smith) goes through a fairly av
erage life, he grows up, adolesces, goes to a

college that is not really his first choice,
chooses to enter the field of fabricated envi
ronments management (hotels), gets mar
ried, etc., all the while moving three
squares, or getting free spins for such things
ascommunicating with his father, rationaliz
ing questionable decisions, and above all for
adapting. He is aided in this by two players
(Marsha Bloom and Kent Minault) and by the
announcer (Steve Cotten) who, over the
course of the game plays everything from his
parents and teachers to his mistress and his
son.
The play, as directed by Ed Decker on a
rather amazing set by Valentine Hooven, is
funny though uneven. While many of the
bits are original, quite a lot of the material,
especially on family life, has been done
elsewhere and better. Smith, in the main
role is cute and sometimes funny, but any
sense of one emerging character is lost in
the frenetic direction, and Phil becomes
stereotypical, rather than just typical.
Bloom, playing all the female parts, shows
herself to be a talented and versatile per
former. She is especially memorable as an
adolescent earnestly preaching Kahlil Gib
ran and love for humanity. Cotten is very
funny as the supercilious emcee, and
Minault has some very good bits, notably as
Phil's way out son. Overall, despite its flaws,
the original concept makes "Adaptation" an
interesting piece to watch. The show does
have some useful things to say about the loss
of individuality as an important part of the
rites of passage.
The second piece of the evening, Rosa, by
Peter Barnes, concerns a doctor for the aged
living in government institutions in Great
Britain. The case opens with the doctor
(Priscilla Alden) dictating case histories into
a tape recorder. She becomes overcome
with rage at the plight of the elderly poor and
at the cold-hearted bureaucrats that are re
sponsible for them. She has been on the
same job for years, and is reaching the end
of her ability to cope with disease and de
spair. The play, despite an annoying overuse
of metaphor, has some good lines and pow
erful moments. Alden, while not always en
tirely on track reaches her peak with the play

itself in a vision of the aged, whom she has
described as not living, hut lingering, lead
ing an attack on the bureaucracy. After a
vivid description of gun-toting and bomb
throwing geriatrics, Rosa bursts into gales of
laughter at the absurdity of the thought. "If
only the old would recover their rage," she
muses. This, of course, is the heart of the
matter. Another of the rites of passage is the
loss of the ability to be angry; the fact that
Rosa still can be furious enough at the
powers-that-be to summon up the vivid im
ages is a sign that she can go on living.
The finest acting of the evening occurs in
William Hanley's, Mrs. Dully a Lover. It
concerns a 49 year-old housewife (Carol
McElheney) who is having an affair with the
boy next door, who is barely out ot high
school (Craig Bray). Director Thom Flkjer
and designer Bruce Brisson have done a
superb job in conjuring up the New York of
1962. If as good a job had been done with
cutting the script, this would have been a
rare treat. As it is, the piece is overlong. and
drags quite a bit. Nevertheless, there are
some superb moments. McElheney's at
tempt to recreate a nightclub act she had
done before she was married is lovely and
touching, and her reading of a John Donne
poem to the boy as she admits that she has
fallen in love is truly beautiful. Bray is funny
and wonderfully real in the other role; his
confusion at her emotions and her interests
is amazing. This play has the most positive
view of the adult growing process; Mrs.
Dally, for all the pain and tedium she suffers
through, has learned how to love and how to
appreciate life even in a difficult marriage. If
the play had been a bit tighter, it would have
been quite an extraordinary piece.
Rites of Passage plays at the One Act
Theatre on Mason Street through March 5.
The three plays together, while far from per
fect, create an interesting view of the pro
cesses that await the years ahead. Whether
because of continuing adaptation to the ex
pectations of society, our eventual loss of
rage at injustice, or, ideally, an appreciation
of life itself and increased ability to love,
these plays would indicate that our growth is
far from over.

the frenetic direction, and Phil becomes
stereotypical, rather than just typical.
Bloom, playing all the female parts, shows
herself to be a talented and versatile per
former. She is especially memorable as an
adolescent earnestly preaching Kahlil Gib
ran and love for humanity. Cotten is very
funny as the supercilious emcee, and
Minault has some very good bits, notably as
Phil's way out son. Overall, despite its flaws,
the original concept makes "Adaptation" an
interesting piece to watch. The show does
have some useful things to say about the loss
of individuality as an important part of the
rites of passage.
The second piece of the evening, Rosa, by
Peter Barnes, concerns a doctor for the aged
living in government institutions in Great
Britain. The case opens with the doctor
(Priscilla Alden) dictating case histories into
a tape recorder. She becomes overcome
with rage at the plight of the elderly poor and
at the cold-hearted bureaucrats that are re
sponsible for them. She has been on the
same job for years, and is reaching the end
of her ability to cope with disease and de
spair. The play, despite an annoying overuse
of metaphor, has some good lines and pow
erful moments. Alden, while not always en
tirely on track reaches her peak with the play

itself in a vision of the aged, whom she has
described as not living, hut lingering, lead
ing an attack on the bureaucracy. After a
vivid description of gun-toting and bomb
throwing geriatrics, Rosa bursts into gales of
laughter at the absurdity of the thought. "If
only the old would recover their rage," she
muses. This, of course, is the heart of the
matter. Another of the rites of passage is the
loss of the ability to be angry; the fact that
Rosa still can be furious enough at the
powers-that-be to summon up the vivid im
ages is a sign that she can go on living.
The finest acting of the evening occurs in
William Hanley's, Mrs. Dully a Lover. It
concerns a 49 year-old housewife (Carol
McElheney) who is having an affair with the
boy next door, who is barely out ot high
school (Craig Bray). Director Thom Flkjer
and designer Bruce Brisson have done a
superb job in conjuring up the New York of
1962. If as good a job had been done with
cutting the script, this would have been a
rare treat. As it is, the piece is overlong. and
drags quite a bit. Nevertheless, there are
some superb moments. McElheney's at
tempt to recreate a nightclub act she had
done before she was married is lovely and
touching, and her reading of a John Donne
poem to the boy as she admits that she has
fallen in love is truly beautiful. Bray is funny
and wonderfully real in the other role; his
confusion at her emotions and her interests
is amazing. This play has the most positive
view of the adult growing process; Mrs.
Dally, for all the pain and tedium she suffers
through, has learned how to love and how to
appreciate life even in a difficult marriage. If
the play had been a bit tighter, it would have
been quite an extraordinary piece.
Rites of Passage plays at the One Act
Theatre on Mason Street through March 5.
The three plays together, while far from per
fect, create an interesting view of the pro
cesses that await the years ahead. Whether
because of continuing adaptation to the ex
pectations of society, our eventual loss of
rage at injustice, or, ideally, an appreciation
of life itself and increased ability to love,
these plays would indicate that our growth is
far from over.

As students, most of us see ourselves as
having essentially completed the growing
up process, and as being about to embark on
our adult lives. The growth process
which is yet to come is of little concern, and
if we think about it all, we tend to assume
that it will be merely a continuance and per
fecting of the maturation that has already
occurred. The three one-act plays currently
showing at San Francisco's One Act Theatre
Co. under the joint heading of Riles of Pas
sage examine the growing that goes on after
adolescence. Each focuses on a different as
pect of that process and has interesting in
sights to offer those of us on the brink.
The tirst of the three, Adaptation by Elaine
May, presents the life of a somewhat typical
middle class American in the framework of a
game show complete with spinning wheels,
flashing boxes, funny costumes and a snide
announcer. The object of the game is to find
the hidden security square, though, as the
emcee points out at the start, unbeknownst
to the contestant, he can win at any time by
naming any square the security square and
declaring himself the winner. Phil, the con
testant (C.J. Smith) goes through a fairly av
erage life, he grows up, adolesces, goes to a

college that is not really his first choice,
chooses to enter the field of fabricated envi
ronments management (hotels), gets mar
ried, etc., all the while moving three
squares, or getting free spins for such things
ascommunicating with his father, rationaliz
ing questionable decisions, and above all for
adapting. He is aided in this by two players
(Marsha Bloom and Kent Minault) and by the
announcer (Steve Cotten) who, over the
course of the game plays everything from his
parents and teachers to his mistress and his
son.
The play, as directed by Ed Decker on a
rather amazing set by Valentine Hooven, is
funny though uneven. While many of the
bits are original, quite a lot of the material,
especially on family life, has been done
elsewhere and better. Smith, in the main
role is cute and sometimes funny, but any
sense of one emerging character is lost in
the frenetic direction, and Phil becomes
stereotypical, rather than just typical.
