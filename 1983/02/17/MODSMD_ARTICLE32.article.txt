# Psychedelia returns with a vengeance and a sweet L.A. sound
## 
### LARRY NADLER 
While American radio, the
record industry androckclubs
are usually reluctant to take
risks on presenting new music
to its audiences, creating
chronic musical stagnation, a
large portion of young music
lovers are not so set in their
preferences — they thrive on
the vitality and immediacy of
the music scene. As
Deadheads pledge undying
loyalty to their avatars, some
punks still faithfully follow
punk bands, both trying to re
live the freshness and urgency
of the original hippie and punk
scenes. Others have branched
out to new and different musi
cal styles, always looking for
the "next big thing."
It is not surprising, then, that
out of Los Angeles, the West
Coast's mecca fortrend-setting
young rebels, has emerged a
new tide of bands, reviving and
reliving another exciting
period of time when youth had
a music that could truly be cal
led their own, the swinging
'60s. On Feb. 9, San Fran
cisco got a taste of The Three
O'Clock, The Bangles and The
Rain Parade, who, along with
The Last, The Unclaimed,

Dream Syndicate, Green on
Red and Longriders. comprise
Los Angeles's germinating
psychedelic music scene.
Atter making my vvav
through the labyrinth which is
Embarcadero Center, I
reached the Old Waldorf |ust
in time to catch the last number
of The Rain Parade, a some
what sloppy but heartfelt re
ndition ot their excellent
single, "What's She Done to
Your Mind?" The sound is very
Bvrds-like, with Matthew Piuc
ci's shimmerv 12-string guitar
playing and emotive three-part
harmonies. I'd definitely like to
hear more of The Rain Parade
soon.
The Bangles started as The
Bangs, an all-girl trio, in 1981,
before adding bassist Annette
Zilinskas last year and chang
ing their name to The Bangles
to avoid legal prosecution from
a New lersey namesake. Last
winter they opened for the
English Beat's California dates
where, after the initial Go-Go's
comparisons, they met a gen
erally enthusiastic response.
Nevertheless, the Bangles
are much more at home in a
more intimate club, where a
party atmosphere can grow.
Indeed, The Bangles have so

much tun on stage the festive
atmosphere can't help but
spread. Opening with a blister
ing version of Love's "Seven
and Seven Is," they ran
through most of the numbers
from their recently-released
extended-play record, "Get
ting Out of hand," their first
single, along with several new
originals and a cover of Simon
and Garfunkel's "Hazy Shade
of Winter," encoring with the
Seed s classic, "Pushin Too
Hard."
Lead guitarist Vicki Peterson
provides gutsy leads, com
plemented by Susanna Hoff's
rhythm guitar, Annette's bass
and Debbi Peterson's potent
percussion. However, the top
ping on The Bangle's musical
cake is the vocals, All except
Annette sing lead; Susanna's
and Vicki's gleeful crooning
contrasting with Debbi's
seductive alto, while the other
bandmembers accompany
with smooth-as-silk Mamas
and Papas-ish backing har
monies. The Bangles succeed
in recreating the unique AM
radio sound of the '60s, and put
out their all to revive that pure
fun and innocence.
The Three O'Clock began
life as Salvation Army, a punk

band in which 19-year old lead
singer Mike Quercio's sur
realistic lyrics didn't quite fit
with the band's hardcore blare.
Several personnel changes and
a name change (also for legal
reasons) later, they have
emerged with a sound clearly
influenced by the Beatles, the
Byrds, and early Pink Floyd, as
well as '60s garage bands like
the Electric Prunes and the
Thirteenth Floor Elevators, and
yet uniquely their own.
Dressed in Paul Revere-style
ruffles, Quercio's eery, high
pitched voice is perfect for
such abstract tales of transfor
mations as "With a Cantaloupe
Girlfriend" (from their recent
record. Baroque Hoedown)
and "She Turns to Flowers"
(from the Salvation Army
album released last year).
Sample lyric: "She is an
orange/ She is a parking stall/
She turns to flowers and she is
no more." He is also fond of
introducing songs with cryptic
snippets of insight ("There are
many cats in Rome — I can't
explain it,"he offers before
launching into Pink Floyd's
"Lucifer Sam.") Greg Guiter
rez's guitar, and Danny Be
nair's percussion are tight and
adroit, with Mickey Marrianos
keyboards creating an ethereal

aura. j
In "As Real as Real," Benair-r-rs:
pounds out the stuttery beat
from the Fab Four's "Tomor- 5
row Never Knows," while Mike
prescribes his own method of
turning oft your mind and float-* 4 :
ing downstream, backed by
Greg and Mickey's Aw- :
wwwww!" We also gel "I Go
Wild," "Upside Down," and
several new songs before their" 1
frenetic Easybeat's cover,
"Sorry," sends all feet dancing.
For an encore, Ihe Three
O'Clock are joined onstage by
a violinist for the elegant"Mar
|orie Tells Me." I his is fol
lowed by the Monkee's "For""
Pete's Sake," "While We Wert*
In Your Room Talking to Your*-" ■
Wall," and finally, the Bvrd's
"I'll Feel a Whole Lot Better,"-"
accompanied by The Bangles
on backing vocals, tam
bourine, and go-go dancing.
Fhe Three O'Clock also suc
ceed in recreating another
long-gone period with original
ity and skill. I he new "paisley
underground" scene may in
deed prove to be more than
just a short-lived trend. Most
importantly, it is fresh and fun.
One thing is for sure — the 60s
have left us a musical legacy
that will never die. Pass the -
love beads, man.


Mike Quercio of the Three O'clock
