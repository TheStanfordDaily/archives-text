# I-World: dub it international, skank it out
## 
### JOHN NORDELL 
A musical extravaganza hit the Ber
keley Square last Thursday: a record
release party for l-World and a benefit
for D.U.8., the Dread Union of Broad
casters. Members of D.U.B. were on
hand spinning hard reggae sounds.
Perhaps a few definitions are neces
sary.
I-World: "l-World is more than a
name, just as the band is more than a
subtotal of the individual members.
The"I" signifies the Universal-Self and
the interdependency of our species in
spite of all the divisive factors that im
pede the forces of Unity. The "World"
which they work towards is not a place
where differences do not exist, but
rather are recognized and enrich the
entire family ot man. "l-World" is the
manifestation of Universal harmony
and a vision of justice for all nations."
D.U.8., the Dread Union of Broad-
A network of Bay Area disc joc
keys. By pooling their resources and
unifying promotions the DJs will bring
more organization to reggae music on a

local and international level.
"Dub" in reggae terminology refers
to the severe remixing, addition of spe
cial effects and the editing out of the
vocal track of a record. When a single is
released, such as the one by l-World,
side A is the vocal version: Interna
tional Reggae. Side B is the dub version,
in this case: Coast to Coast Dub.
Corresponding to their name, many
of l-World's songs pertain to uniting
and fighting against Babylon, the cor
rupt, oppressive system. After opening
with an instrumental tune, with flute,
harp and guitar solos, the band moved
into ")ah People Must Unite (in self
defense)." Several songs later was a
prophecy, "Babylon Will Surely Fall"
that featured a moving sax solo from
Terri Brewer who also doubles on
keyboards. Moving into a love song,
"Crossover," lead guitarist Gary
Asazawa and Brewer on organ nicely
harmonized on aisingle riff. ,
The set later finished with "Interna
tional Reggae," followed by "Coast to
Coast Dub," with Ras Kwasi-I at the mix

ing board bringing a live dub mix to the
show i.e., adding echo and reverb to
the instruments. Especially exciting was
when the other musicians stopped
playing and began skunking, while
Sjahzuf Sjahzuf, drummer and founder
of the band, and bassist, Trie "Mr. Bas
sie" Dawes, the newest member of the
band, churned out some drums and
bass to make you wind up your wais(t).
Ras Kwasi-I added repeating echo to
Sjahzuf's snare drum beats.
l-World came on for their second set
fired up, the music much more ener
gized. Many of the songs were praises
to |ah Rastafari, the Rastafarian god. Ed
Gordon, on lead vocals and guitar, with
emotion cracking his face led some oi
the religious chants.
Reggae emerged from the destitution
and suffering of Kingston, jamaica
ghettos. While its form has evolved as it
has become international music, the
beat remains as...jtyes the
positive message of Unity Keep listen
ing for l-World and D.U.8., the Dread
Union of Broadcasters.
