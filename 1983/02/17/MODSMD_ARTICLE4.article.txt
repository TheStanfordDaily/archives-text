### KEVIN GROSS Staff Writer 
Stanford I inear Accelerator C enter
(SLAC) Director Wolfgang Panofsky,
Deputy Director Sidney Drel! and
three other prom'nent physicists
dratted a recently released American
Physical Society (<\PS> resolution cal
ling tor the United States and the
Soviet Union to "reduce signifi
< AwTty" the number of nuclear
weapons and delivery systems.
I he Stanford physicists helped to
form the resolution as part of their
role as members of a committee ap
pointed by the elected council of the
APS.
According to Drell the resolution
was a mild, general statement. It
spoke of totally non-rontroversial
matters he sa'd It was an expres
sion of the officers . . of support for
the negotiations between the United
States and the Soviet Union."
The resolution also urges both
sides to:

• conduct negotiations to limit the
deployment of battlef«eld and inter
mediate range nuclear weapons and
restrict their use,
• resume negotiations aimed to
wards preventing the spread of nu
clear weapons in outer space;
• initiate discussions to ban the
testing or nuclear weapons in all en
vironments as tailed for in the
nucear non-nroMf&tiori treaty.
"The significance of the resolution
is nothing more specific than a iall
from the members of a scientific
community for political leacfers to in
tersify the efforts to reduce the risk
of a nuc lear war, Drell Sdi.f. "It was
felt bv the ■ oun : i; af it* annual meet
ing . lhat the so< lety should go on
record as making this statement."
He pointed out that Tjny profes
sional and scientific organizations,
including the National Academy of
Sciences, have expressed support
forarrris reduction and arms control
Dtell said there was absolutely no

connection between the council's
resolution and the petition submit
ted recently by SLAC employees op
posing construction of beam particle
lines which would be used for nu
clear weapons research at the Stan
ford Synchrotron Radiation labora
tory
The APS resolution also stated that
both countries should avoid military
doctrines and deployments that treat
nuclear weapons as ordinary
weapons of war. The council be
lieves that both nations should take
all practical measures" to inhibit
further proliferation of nuclear
weapons to additional countries and
to reduce the risk of nuclear war by
accident or miscalculation.
Asked if the statement is a criticism
of weapons research and develop
ment, Drell replied that the resolu
tion is only a statement of an agreed
goal, adding that many physicists in
APS are employed in industry and in
weapons laboratories.
