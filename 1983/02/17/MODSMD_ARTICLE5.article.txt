# Personnel task force recommends decentralization guidelines
## 
### KIMBERLY BROWN Senior staff writer 
As the University has grown more com
plex, a need for greater coherence and foe us
of personnel administration has emerged.
"We need to think of the University as an
employer with set principles," Robert
Parker, director of personnel and cochair of
the University Task Force on Personnel
Policies and Administration, said.
In a report released Monday, 'he Task
force recommended that Stanford de
centralize personnel responsibilities where
appropriate and adopt a human resource
guidelines.
The report explains that department
heads often feel unable to fulfill their re
sponsibilities "because of the bureaucratic
maze they must travel in dealing with per
sonnel matters
Administrators iri central offices, on the
other hand, are frustrated because they see
departments willing to take actions which,
while locally expedient, seem to disregard
institutional interests, according to the re
port.
C onsequently, the task force concluded,
the administration "constructs an elaborate
mechanism in an attempt to safeguard the
University from itself."
The University should continue to main
tain a single University-wide pay and classiti
cation structure, but should decentralize in-

dividual nonbargaining unit classification
decisions, the report recommends.
As the pay and classification system now
operates, if job classifications of University
employees grow outdated, re-classification
dec isions are made by the central personnel
administration.
According to Parker, the task force re
commends that more of these decisions be

made at the local level — within individual
departments.
The pay structure and classification sys
tem would continue to be centrally main
tained.
The guidelines concerning human re
source management were dratted in a sepa
rate statement of "Stanford's Purpose and its
Human Resources." The task force said its

intention in compiling these principles was
to provide a context tot the University's per
sonnel policies and their administration.
"The University respects each person s
worth, dignity capacity to contribute and
desire for personal growth and ac
complishment,'' the statement reads.
Ray Bacchetti, vice-provost for manage
ment and director of University budgets,
said he views the human resources
guidelines as an attempt to make things
more consistent internally, by setting a stan
dard for comparison and an example for fu
ture policies.
The task force reported a need for a
"broadly shared belief that effective human
resource management is everyone's re
sponsibility and that the continuing excel
lence ot the University depends on it."
The long-awaited report includes 23 re
commendations covering human resource
philosophv, balance between central and
local responsibility, supervision, pay and
classification, statt development, affirmative
action and employment and ptoblem solv
ing.
"The task forte had not been about its
business long when it became aware of a
general perception of over-regulation at
Stanford the report savs.
"We did hear vigorously expressed con
cerns that certain processes took too long to
accomplish, that some processes weren t

act omplishing their intended ends, and that
a large part of the administration of person
nel policies was too remote from the front
line supervisor and her or his immediate
supervisors."
According to Paiktf < the general percep
tion of over-regulat'on was something the
members of the tas* force had personally
encountered as they tried to work through
the University bureaucracy.
The task force study was an "opportunity
to step back and encourage streamlining, '
he said.
Apart from the procedural changes, most
of the recommendations suggest a 'direc
tion for change, ' and a sustained effort
over time," Parker said.
The report says the task force is recom
mending change not because il supports
either polar position on the issue ot institu
tional standards vs local initiative but be
cause it believes ' the ophmum relationship
between them requires periodic realign
ment with the evolution ot the University.'
Bacchetti said he interprets the situation
as the University s being a little out of
breath dealing with everyday business." He
cited examples of staff adapting to changes
in technology, increased government regu
lations, and the responsibilities that ac
company any period of rapid growth
"This is a comprehensive and very far
reaching report," he said "Some places will

adapt more quickly than others."
Parkei also emphasized that those policies
adopted would he implemented with cau
tion and "tailored to fit" individual depart
ments. While some areas will welcome the
additional responsibility, other-, will "he ter
rified," he said.
The personnel department and vice
presidential senior staff members are cur
rently assessing the recommendation's pos
sible impact and ways to implement the var
ious policies. The assessment is expected to
take about three months.
The task force, appointed in August 1981,
met 11 times. Its study included an opinion
survey of 1300 nonbargaining unit staff
members, as well as opinions solicited from
various University groups and individual
employees.
Formed by University President Donald
Kennedy and Vice-President for Business
and Finance William Massy, the task force
was asked to develop a human resource
philosophy and to recommend changes in
the personnel administration of that
phil osophy.
Members of the task force have been re
ceiving generally positive responses on the
report thus far, Parker said.
The Administrative Council will discuss
the proposals with the Dean's Council be
fore deciding, in lune, whi< h of the 23 re
commendations to implement.

In a report released Monday, 'he Task
force recommended that Stanford de
centralize personnel responsibilities where
appropriate and adopt a human resource
guidelines.
The report explains that department
heads often feel unable to fulfill their re
sponsibilities "because of the bureaucratic
maze they must travel in dealing with per
sonnel matters
Administrators iri central offices, on the
other hand, are frustrated because they see
departments willing to take actions which,
while locally expedient, seem to disregard
institutional interests, according to the re
port.
C onsequently, the task force concluded,
the administration "constructs an elaborate
mechanism in an attempt to safeguard the
University from itself."
The University should continue to main
tain a single University-wide pay and classiti
cation structure, but should decentralize in-

dividual nonbargaining unit classification
decisions, the report recommends.
As the pay and classification system now
operates, if job classifications of University
employees grow outdated, re-classification
dec isions are made by the central personnel
administration.
According to Parker, the task force re
commends that more of these decisions be

made at the local level — within individual
departments.
The pay structure and classification sys
tem would continue to be centrally main
tained.
The guidelines concerning human re
source management were dratted in a sepa
rate statement of "Stanford's Purpose and its
Human Resources." The task force said its

intention in compiling these principles was
to provide a context tot the University's per
sonnel policies and their administration.
"The University respects each person s
worth, dignity capacity to contribute and
desire for personal growth and ac
complishment,'' the statement reads.
Ray Bacchetti, vice-provost for manage
ment and director of University budgets,
said he views the human resources
guidelines as an attempt to make things
more consistent internally, by setting a stan
dard for comparison and an example for fu
ture policies.
The task force reported a need for a
"broadly shared belief that effective human
resource management is everyone's re
sponsibility and that the continuing excel
lence ot the University depends on it."
The long-awaited report includes 23 re
commendations covering human resource
philosophv, balance between central and
local responsibility, supervision, pay and
classification, statt development, affirmative
action and employment and ptoblem solv
ing.
"The task forte had not been about its
business long when it became aware of a
general perception of over-regulation at
Stanford the report savs.
"We did hear vigorously expressed con
cerns that certain processes took too long to
accomplish, that some processes weren t

act omplishing their intended ends, and that
a large part of the administration of person
nel policies was too remote from the front
line supervisor and her or his immediate
supervisors."
According to Paiktf < the general percep
tion of over-regulat'on was something the
members of the tas* force had personally
encountered as they tried to work through
the University bureaucracy.
The task force study was an "opportunity
to step back and encourage streamlining, '
he said.
Apart from the procedural changes, most
of the recommendations suggest a 'direc
tion for change, ' and a sustained effort
over time," Parker said.
The report says the task force is recom
mending change not because il supports
either polar position on the issue ot institu
tional standards vs local initiative but be
cause it believes ' the ophmum relationship
between them requires periodic realign
ment with the evolution ot the University.'
Bacchetti said he interprets the situation
as the University s being a little out of
breath dealing with everyday business." He
cited examples of staff adapting to changes
in technology, increased government regu
lations, and the responsibilities that ac
company any period of rapid growth
"This is a comprehensive and very far
reaching report," he said "Some places will

adapt more quickly than others."
Parkei also emphasized that those policies
adopted would he implemented with cau
tion and "tailored to fit" individual depart
ments. While some areas will welcome the
additional responsibility, other-, will "he ter
rified," he said.
The personnel department and vice
presidential senior staff members are cur
rently assessing the recommendation's pos
sible impact and ways to implement the var
ious policies. The assessment is expected to
take about three months.
The task force, appointed in August 1981,
met 11 times. Its study included an opinion
survey of 1300 nonbargaining unit staff
members, as well as opinions solicited from
various University groups and individual
employees.
Formed by University President Donald
Kennedy and Vice-President for Business
and Finance William Massy, the task force
was asked to develop a human resource
philosophy and to recommend changes in
the personnel administration of that
phil osophy.
Members of the task force have been re
ceiving generally positive responses on the
report thus far, Parker said.
The Administrative Council will discuss
the proposals with the Dean's Council be
fore deciding, in lune, whi< h of the 23 re
commendations to implement.

As the University has grown more com
plex, a need for greater coherence and foe us
of personnel administration has emerged.
"We need to think of the University as an
employer with set principles," Robert
Parker, director of personnel and cochair of
the University Task Force on Personnel
Policies and Administration, said.
