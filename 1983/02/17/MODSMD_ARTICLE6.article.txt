Reagan backs down

Washington — President Reagan declared last
night he retains full confidence in Environmental Pro
tection Agency chief Anne Gorsuch, but retreated on
the assertion of executive privilege that spurred the
House to charge her with contempt of Congress.
As White House negotiators tried to arrange a com
promise with congressional leaders over the delivery
o' previously withheld documents, Reagan told a na
tionally broadcast news conference that "I can no
longer insist on executive privilege if there is a suspi
f 'oh n minds of the Ame'ica" people that it 'S
being used to cover up wrongdoing."
At the same time, Reagan said he has ordered "a
complete investigation by the Jjstice Department

into every charge that has been made" over possible
mismanagement of the nation's "superfund" pro
gram to clean up hazardous waste sites.
Reagan opened his 16th formal news conference
with the declaration that the economy "has begun to
flex its muscles," but urged quick congressional ac
tion on a jobs bill he said would provide work without
worsening budget deficits.
Reagan outlined a $4 3 billion unemployment
package, even as some House Republicans |oined
Democrats in saying that the government should do
more.
He said the plan he advocates is a compromise, and
not "another quick fix" jobs plan He said Congress
should pass it and have it ready for his signature in

March.
It includes $4 billion in accelerated spending on
federal construction and repair projects, Rea
gan said would create up to 470,000 jobs, $2.9 billion
in supplementary unemployment insurance, and
$300 million in relief for jobless Americans in dire
need.
He said it all would be consistent with his basic eco
nomic recovery plan ' It funds no makework jobs."
he said "Instead we're speeding up projects thar are
already planned and needed "
