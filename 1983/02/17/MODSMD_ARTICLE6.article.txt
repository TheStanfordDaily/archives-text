Reagan backs down

Washington — President Reagan declared last
night he retains full confidence in Environmental Pro
tection Agency chief Anne Gorsuch, but retreated on
the assertion of executive privilege that spurred the
House to charge her with contempt of Congress.
As White House negotiators tried to arrange a com
promise with congressional leaders over the delivery
o' previously withheld documents, Reagan told a na
tionally broadcast news conference that "I can no
longer insist on executive privilege if there is a suspi
f 'oh n minds of the Ame'ica" people that it 'S
being used to cover up wrongdoing."
At the same time, Reagan said he has ordered "a
complete investigation by the Jjstice Department

into every charge that has been made" over possible
mismanagement of the nation's "superfund" pro
gram to clean up hazardous waste sites.
Reagan opened his 16th formal news conference
with the declaration that the economy "has begun to
flex its muscles," but urged quick congressional ac
tion on a jobs bill he said would provide work without
worsening budget deficits.
Reagan outlined a $4 3 billion unemployment
package, even as some House Republicans |oined
Democrats in saying that the government should do
more.
He said the plan he advocates is a compromise, and
not "another quick fix" jobs plan He said Congress
should pass it and have it ready for his signature in

March.
It includes $4 billion in accelerated spending on
federal construction and repair projects, Rea
gan said would create up to 470,000 jobs, $2.9 billion
in supplementary unemployment insurance, and
$300 million in relief for jobless Americans in dire
need.
He said it all would be consistent with his basic eco
nomic recovery plan ' It funds no makework jobs."
he said "Instead we're speeding up projects thar are
already planned and needed "
Begin keeps party support
ferusalern — The Israeli Parliament, on straight par
tv-line votes, rejected yesterday 'hree separate mo

t'ons of no confidence in Prime Minister Menachem
Begin's government over the investigation of the
Beirut refugee camp massacre.
In a 64-56 vote on the motions, which followed 61-2
hours of often-acrimonious debate, every member of
the six parties that make up Begin's coalition voted to
support the government while every member of the
three opposition parties voted to oust the govern
ment from office.
It was the first time in 11 no-confidence tests that
Begin has won since he was re-elected 18monthsago
that all 120 membprs of the Knesset (Parliament)
voted and that no member crossed party lines.
Former Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and former
Foreign Minister Abba Eban pressed the demand of
the opposition Labor Party for Begin's government to
resign as a result of the report of the judicial com
mission which investigated the Sept. 16-18 massacre at
the Sabra and Chatilla refugee camps.
Hundreds of Palestinian civilians were killed by
Lebanese Christian militiamen after Israeli authorities
allowed the militiamen to enter the camps to mop up
Palestinian guerrillas believed to be hiding there.
Opposition speakers said that the government
should have stepped down. They complained that
Ariel Sharon should have quit the Cabinet instead of
just leaving the job of defense minister.
Replying on behalf of the government, Justice Min
ister Moshe Nissim said that the commission absolved
Israel of any direct responsibility for the killings. He
said that "shortcomings are part and parcel of any
war."
Volcker predicts recovery
Washington — Federal Reserve Chairman Paul
Volcker announced new money growth targets yes
terday that he said will clear the way for a 1983 eco
nomic recovery with lower interest rates and less in
flation.
While the projected increase in the money supply
this year will be slightly smaller than in 1982, Volcker
told the Senate Banking Committee, the new targets
"are fully compatible with easier market conditions
and lower interest rates."
Volcker said Federal Reserve officials were more
optimistic than President Reagan's economic ad
visers, foreseeing 1983 growth of 3.5 percent to 4 per
cent, although they believe unemployment will hov
er close to the double-digit level of 10 percent
throughout the year. The decisions discussed by
Volcker were made last week by the Federal Open
Market Committee, the policy-making arm of the na
tion's central bank which includes Volcker and the six
other members of the Federal Reserve Board as well
as presidents of five regional Federal Reserve banks.
Private analysts said the new ranges proposed for
growth of the money supply were likely to increase
the prospect of recovery from recession and set the
stage for a reduction in short-term borrowing
charges.
"The Fed is setting targets that wil! ailow a good
sized recovery to occur," said Allen Sinai, a monetary
specialist with Data Resources Inc., a private research
firm "Tnp c e targets are a presv~ript ! on for Icwer in
terest rates."
Donald Raiff, vice president and senior economist
with Northern Trust Co. of Chicago, agreed with this
analysis. The targets mean that the Federal Reserve
will not havetotighten upon moneysupplygrowthas
the recovery develops, Raiff said, because it has left
itself more room to maneuver.
Kirkpatrick cancels speech
Berkeley, Calif. — jeane Kirkpatrick, U.S. am
bassador to the United Nations, canceled a speech at
the University of California here yesterday, the day af
ter hecklers shouted her down and forced her to
leave the stage during a talk on human rights.

The disruption involved about two dozen pro
testors among a standing-room-only audience of 800,
gathered to hear Kirkpatrick deliver the university's
1983 Jefferson Memorial Lecture.
An aide to the ambassador said yesterday that she
would have no immediate comment on the incident
and was returning to Washington on "urgent govern
ment business." University officials said members of
Kirkpatrick's security staff had expressed concern for
her safety following Tuesday's incident.
University Vice Chancellor Roderic Park said the
ambassador had indicated to him that she believed
that she would be "ineffective" in any further campus
appearance.
Park registered dismay over the disruption, noting
with irony that it had occurred on a campus that gave
birth to the student "free speech movement" two
decades ago.
"I don't believe that mindless heckling and anger is
free speech," the vice chancellor said. "...In the
future, we will have to try to control things more ef
fectively than we d.d yesterday. We intend to do just
that."
The disruption of Kirkpatrick's speech was the
latest in a series of similar incidents that have plagued
the campus recently.
Commencement and Charter Day activities have
been interrupted with assorted protests by small
groups of students and non-students.
Last spring, hecklers taunted former Black Panther
leader Eldridge Cleaver during a speech he made
praising America and denouncing Communism. One
heckler rushed the stage to assail Cleaver, but was re
pelled with a punch by the speaker.
Shultz defends Reagan policy
Washington — Secretary of State George Shultz,
under heavy congressional questioning, said yester
day that the Reagan administration opposes nego
tiations with Salvadoran guerrillas because "we're not
going to be in the position of allowing somebody to
shoot their v\ay into the government."
Shultz, who testified before the House Foreign Af
fairs Committee, was forced into an uncharac
teristically heated defense of administration policy by
committee members who repeatedly made clear
their distaste for the Salvadoran regime's human
rights record and their concern that the adminis
tration wants only a military solution to the civil war.
He also angrily characterized as having "no founda
tion in fact" a Washington Post article last week re
porting that Thomas Enders, assistant secretary of
state for inte r-American affairs, had suggested a two
track strategy of supporting the Salvadoran govern
ment while promoting negotiations with the guer
rillas.
Shultz, who testified on behalf of the adminis
tration's $14 5 billion fiscal-1984 foreign aid request,
made these othe r points during the wide-ranging
questioning
— President Reagan has no intention of giving up
his "zero-option" arms control proposal, which
would require the Soviet Union to dismantle all of its
intermediate-range nuclear missiles in Europe in ex
change for the United States not deploying similar

missiles on the continent.
— Syrian Foreign Minister Abdul Halim Khaddam
has assured Shultz personally that Syria will pull its
troops out of Lebanon when Israeli forces leave.
— The next step in the Middle East hinges on
whether Jordan's King Hussein decides to join a
broadened peace process. While acknowledging that
Hussein is undecided, Shultz said the king "has
spoken to us very favorably about the president's in
itiative" and the United States is "optimistic" about
the chances of Jordanian participation.
Senate approves compromise
Sacramento — The state Senate easily approved a
compromise solution to the $1.5 billion deficit yester
day and sent it to the Assembly — where Republican
opposition could block the plan.
The bipartisan vote was 33-6 for the bill, sponsored
by Assemblyman Richard Robinson (D-Garden
Grove), as senators said they hoped it could prevent
or limit the issuance of IOUs next week to cover state
bills.
The Assembly vote on the bill, expected yesterday,
would put pressure on the Assembly Republicans to
agree to the compromise, which includes a potential
1-cent sales tax increase.
"It's a decent compromise," said Senate President
Pro Tem David Roberti, (D-Los Angeles), before the
Senate voted on the plan, "a compromise that tries to
blend the major concerns of all factions."
Senate approval came six hours after Roberti, other
legislative leaders and Republican Gov. Deukmejian
admitted they had reached an impasse.
The plan contains what Roberti characterized as
"an insurance tax. The governor prefers to call it a
standby tax." It would take effect if the economy
worsened next year, but Assembly Republicans claim
it could be automatic tax boost.
A senator who voted against bill agreed.
"I would like to congratulate the Democrats for
putting together a tax package with Republican fin
gerprints all over the murder weapon." said Sen. H.L.
Richardson, (R-Arcadia).
"I guarantee you will give the peopleofCaliforniaa
tax increase which will be known in a short period of
time as the Deukmejian tax increase," he added. "If
you put a (tax increase) trigger out there somebody's
going to pull it. People are going to get hit in the
pocketbook."
But other senators said they would be relieved to
have the long stalemate over
Senate nearly rejects Adelman
Washington — The Senate Foreign Relations Com
mittee moved to the brink of rejecting Kenneth
Adelman as the new head of the U.S. Arms Control
and Disarmament Agency yesterday, but postponed a
vote to give President Reagan an opportunity to
withdraw Adelman's nomination and name someone
else.
It was a stunning setback for the White House,
which had ousted arms control chief Eugene Rostow
last month and immediately proposed Adelman, the
deputy U.S. ambassador to the United Nations as his
successor.

With Republican Sens. Larry Pressler of South Da
kota and Charles Mathias Maryland joining nearly
solid Democratic opposition the committee was on
the verge of a 9-8 vote to reiect Adelman, a critic of
past arms control policies, before deciding to put the
controversial matter avde for a week
Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.), who led the fight
against Adelman from the outset, went along v\ith
other Democrats who pro Dosed a postponement
rather than reject the nomination outright
Sen Jospoh Biden (D-Del ). and Sen Paul Tsongas
(D-Masv). both contended that no purpose would be
served by embarrassing the president on the issue at a
time when U S arms control policy is at the center of
controversy in West German election campaigns.
Tsongas said he had gone to the Srate Department
and privately urged that the nomination be
withdrawn Biden said he had cautioned Vice Presi
dent George Bush late Tuesday agamst pushing the
nomination to a showdown.
Angola, South Africa negotiate
Washington — Angoia and South Africa have put a
de facto cease-fire into effect along their war-torn
frontier 3nd a formal d'sengagemen! pact is expected
soon as a result of direct negotiations between the
two countries, according to U.S officials
The effect of the pact would be to push Cuban
troops stationed in Angola and African guerrillas raid
ing into the disputed territory of Namibia out of the
war zone, and to halt the punishing raids into Angola
by South African troops. The South African raids,
rather than a highly public ized American diplomatic
drive in fhe rei<ion. appear to have brought the
Angolans to the negotiating table, diplomats say.
Because the South African-Arigolan negotiations
apparently do not provide for any further steps
toward independence for Namibia or eventual with
drawal of Cuban forces from Angola, Western and
African countries involved in the protracted multi
national negotiations for a Namibian settlement are
concerned that the bilateral cease-fire could
stalemate further progress on Namibia.
The fear, which also has been expressed privately
by some U S officials, is that agreement with Angola
will reduce pressure on South Africa to tyrant early in
dependence I '• Namibia, also known as South-West
Attica.

"The Fed is setting targets that wil! ailow a good

specialist with Data Resources Inc., a private research
firm "Tnp c e targets are a presv~ript ! on for Icwer in

Donald Raiff, vice president and senior economist
with Northern Trust Co. of Chicago, agreed with this
analysis. The targets mean that the Federal Reserve
will not havetotighten upon moneysupplygrowthas
the recovery develops, Raiff said, because it has left
itself more room to maneuver.
Kirkpatrick cancels speech
Berkeley, Calif. — jeane Kirkpatrick, U.S. am
bassador to the United Nations, canceled a speech at
the University of California here yesterday, the day af
ter hecklers shouted her down and forced her to
leave the stage during a talk on human rights.

The disruption involved about two dozen pro
testors among a standing-room-only audience of 800,
gathered to hear Kirkpatrick deliver the university's
1983 Jefferson Memorial Lecture.
An aide to the ambassador said yesterday that she
would have no immediate comment on the incident
and was returning to Washington on "urgent govern
ment business." University officials said members of
Kirkpatrick's security staff had expressed concern for
her safety following Tuesday's incident.
University Vice Chancellor Roderic Park said the
ambassador had indicated to him that she believed
that she would be "ineffective" in any further campus
appearance.
Park registered dismay over the disruption, noting
with irony that it had occurred on a campus that gave
birth to the student "free speech movement" two
decades ago.
"I don't believe that mindless heckling and anger is
free speech," the vice chancellor said. "...In the
future, we will have to try to control things more ef
fectively than we d.d yesterday. We intend to do just
that."
The disruption of Kirkpatrick's speech was the
latest in a series of similar incidents that have plagued
the campus recently.
Commencement and Charter Day activities have
been interrupted with assorted protests by small
groups of students and non-students.
Last spring, hecklers taunted former Black Panther
leader Eldridge Cleaver during a speech he made
praising America and denouncing Communism. One
heckler rushed the stage to assail Cleaver, but was re
pelled with a punch by the speaker.
Shultz defends Reagan policy
Washington — Secretary of State George Shultz,
under heavy congressional questioning, said yester
day that the Reagan administration opposes nego
tiations with Salvadoran guerrillas because "we're not
going to be in the position of allowing somebody to
shoot their v\ay into the government."
Shultz, who testified before the House Foreign Af
fairs Committee, was forced into an uncharac
teristically heated defense of administration policy by
committee members who repeatedly made clear
their distaste for the Salvadoran regime's human
rights record and their concern that the adminis
tration wants only a military solution to the civil war.
He also angrily characterized as having "no founda
tion in fact" a Washington Post article last week re
porting that Thomas Enders, assistant secretary of
state for inte r-American affairs, had suggested a two
track strategy of supporting the Salvadoran govern
ment while promoting negotiations with the guer
rillas.
Shultz, who testified on behalf of the adminis
tration's $14 5 billion fiscal-1984 foreign aid request,
made these othe r points during the wide-ranging
questioning
— President Reagan has no intention of giving up
his "zero-option" arms control proposal, which
would require the Soviet Union to dismantle all of its
intermediate-range nuclear missiles in Europe in ex
change for the United States not deploying similar

missiles on the continent.
— Syrian Foreign Minister Abdul Halim Khaddam
has assured Shultz personally that Syria will pull its
troops out of Lebanon when Israeli forces leave.
— The next step in the Middle East hinges on
whether Jordan's King Hussein decides to join a
broadened peace process. While acknowledging that
Hussein is undecided, Shultz said the king "has
spoken to us very favorably about the president's in
itiative" and the United States is "optimistic" about
the chances of Jordanian participation.
Senate approves compromise
Sacramento — The state Senate easily approved a
compromise solution to the $1.5 billion deficit yester
day and sent it to the Assembly — where Republican
opposition could block the plan.
The bipartisan vote was 33-6 for the bill, sponsored
by Assemblyman Richard Robinson (D-Garden
Grove), as senators said they hoped it could prevent
or limit the issuance of IOUs next week to cover state
bills.
The Assembly vote on the bill, expected yesterday,
would put pressure on the Assembly Republicans to
agree to the compromise, which includes a potential
1-cent sales tax increase.
"It's a decent compromise," said Senate President
Pro Tem David Roberti, (D-Los Angeles), before the
Senate voted on the plan, "a compromise that tries to
blend the major concerns of all factions."
Senate approval came six hours after Roberti, other
legislative leaders and Republican Gov. Deukmejian
admitted they had reached an impasse.
The plan contains what Roberti characterized as
"an insurance tax. The governor prefers to call it a
standby tax." It would take effect if the economy
worsened next year, but Assembly Republicans claim
it could be automatic tax boost.
A senator who voted against bill agreed.
"I would like to congratulate the Democrats for
putting together a tax package with Republican fin
gerprints all over the murder weapon." said Sen. H.L.
Richardson, (R-Arcadia).
"I guarantee you will give the peopleofCaliforniaa
tax increase which will be known in a short period of
time as the Deukmejian tax increase," he added. "If
you put a (tax increase) trigger out there somebody's
going to pull it. People are going to get hit in the
pocketbook."
But other senators said they would be relieved to
have the long stalemate over
Senate nearly rejects Adelman
Washington — The Senate Foreign Relations Com
mittee moved to the brink of rejecting Kenneth
Adelman as the new head of the U.S. Arms Control
and Disarmament Agency yesterday, but postponed a
vote to give President Reagan an opportunity to
withdraw Adelman's nomination and name someone
else.
It was a stunning setback for the White House,
which had ousted arms control chief Eugene Rostow
last month and immediately proposed Adelman, the
deputy U.S. ambassador to the United Nations as his
successor.

With Republican Sens. Larry Pressler of South Da
kota and Charles Mathias Maryland joining nearly
solid Democratic opposition the committee was on
the verge of a 9-8 vote to reiect Adelman, a critic of
past arms control policies, before deciding to put the
controversial matter avde for a week
Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.), who led the fight
against Adelman from the outset, went along v\ith
other Democrats who pro Dosed a postponement
rather than reject the nomination outright
Sen Jospoh Biden (D-Del ). and Sen Paul Tsongas
(D-Masv). both contended that no purpose would be
served by embarrassing the president on the issue at a
time when U S arms control policy is at the center of
controversy in West German election campaigns.
Tsongas said he had gone to the Srate Department
and privately urged that the nomination be
withdrawn Biden said he had cautioned Vice Presi
dent George Bush late Tuesday agamst pushing the
nomination to a showdown.
Angola, South Africa negotiate
Washington — Angoia and South Africa have put a
de facto cease-fire into effect along their war-torn
frontier 3nd a formal d'sengagemen! pact is expected
soon as a result of direct negotiations between the
two countries, according to U.S officials
The effect of the pact would be to push Cuban
troops stationed in Angola and African guerrillas raid
ing into the disputed territory of Namibia out of the
war zone, and to halt the punishing raids into Angola
by South African troops. The South African raids,
rather than a highly public ized American diplomatic
drive in fhe rei<ion. appear to have brought the
Angolans to the negotiating table, diplomats say.
Because the South African-Arigolan negotiations
apparently do not provide for any further steps
toward independence for Namibia or eventual with
drawal of Cuban forces from Angola, Western and
African countries involved in the protracted multi
national negotiations for a Namibian settlement are
concerned that the bilateral cease-fire could
stalemate further progress on Namibia.
The fear, which also has been expressed privately
by some U S officials, is that agreement with Angola
will reduce pressure on South Africa to tyrant early in
dependence I '• Namibia, also known as South-West
Attica.

Reagan backs down

Washington — President Reagan declared last
night he retains full confidence in Environmental Pro
tection Agency chief Anne Gorsuch, but retreated on
the assertion of executive privilege that spurred the
House to charge her with contempt of Congress.
As White House negotiators tried to arrange a com
promise with congressional leaders over the delivery
o' previously withheld documents, Reagan told a na
tionally broadcast news conference that "I can no
longer insist on executive privilege if there is a suspi
f 'oh n minds of the Ame'ica" people that it 'S
being used to cover up wrongdoing."
At the same time, Reagan said he has ordered "a
complete investigation by the Jjstice Department

into every charge that has been made" over possible
mismanagement of the nation's "superfund" pro
gram to clean up hazardous waste sites.
Reagan opened his 16th formal news conference
with the declaration that the economy "has begun to
flex its muscles," but urged quick congressional ac
tion on a jobs bill he said would provide work without
worsening budget deficits.
Reagan outlined a $4 3 billion unemployment
package, even as some House Republicans |oined
Democrats in saying that the government should do
more.
He said the plan he advocates is a compromise, and
not "another quick fix" jobs plan He said Congress
should pass it and have it ready for his signature in

March.
It includes $4 billion in accelerated spending on
federal construction and repair projects, Rea
gan said would create up to 470,000 jobs, $2.9 billion
in supplementary unemployment insurance, and
$300 million in relief for jobless Americans in dire
need.
He said it all would be consistent with his basic eco
nomic recovery plan ' It funds no makework jobs."
he said "Instead we're speeding up projects thar are
already planned and needed "
Begin keeps party support
ferusalern — The Israeli Parliament, on straight par
tv-line votes, rejected yesterday 'hree separate mo

t'ons of no confidence in Prime Minister Menachem
Begin's government over the investigation of the
Beirut refugee camp massacre.
In a 64-56 vote on the motions, which followed 61-2
hours of often-acrimonious debate, every member of
the six parties that make up Begin's coalition voted to
support the government while every member of the
three opposition parties voted to oust the govern
ment from office.
It was the first time in 11 no-confidence tests that
Begin has won since he was re-elected 18monthsago
that all 120 membprs of the Knesset (Parliament)
voted and that no member crossed party lines.
Former Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and former
Foreign Minister Abba Eban pressed the demand of
the opposition Labor Party for Begin's government to
resign as a result of the report of the judicial com
mission which investigated the Sept. 16-18 massacre at
the Sabra and Chatilla refugee camps.
Hundreds of Palestinian civilians were killed by
Lebanese Christian militiamen after Israeli authorities
allowed the militiamen to enter the camps to mop up
Palestinian guerrillas believed to be hiding there.
Opposition speakers said that the government
should have stepped down. They complained that
Ariel Sharon should have quit the Cabinet instead of
just leaving the job of defense minister.
Replying on behalf of the government, Justice Min
ister Moshe Nissim said that the commission absolved
Israel of any direct responsibility for the killings. He
said that "shortcomings are part and parcel of any
war."
Volcker predicts recovery
Washington — Federal Reserve Chairman Paul
Volcker announced new money growth targets yes
terday that he said will clear the way for a 1983 eco
nomic recovery with lower interest rates and less in
flation.
While the projected increase in the money supply
this year will be slightly smaller than in 1982, Volcker
told the Senate Banking Committee, the new targets
"are fully compatible with easier market conditions
and lower interest rates."
Volcker said Federal Reserve officials were more
optimistic than President Reagan's economic ad
visers, foreseeing 1983 growth of 3.5 percent to 4 per
cent, although they believe unemployment will hov
er close to the double-digit level of 10 percent
throughout the year. The decisions discussed by
Volcker were made last week by the Federal Open
Market Committee, the policy-making arm of the na
tion's central bank which includes Volcker and the six
other members of the Federal Reserve Board as well
as presidents of five regional Federal Reserve banks.
Private analysts said the new ranges proposed for
growth of the money supply were likely to increase
the prospect of recovery from recession and set the
stage for a reduction in short-term borrowing
charges.
"The Fed is setting targets that wil! ailow a good
sized recovery to occur," said Allen Sinai, a monetary
specialist with Data Resources Inc., a private research
firm "Tnp c e targets are a presv~ript ! on for Icwer in

Pro Tem David Roberti, (D-Los Angeles), before the
Senate voted on the plan, "a compromise that tries to
blend the major concerns of all factions."
Senate approval came six hours after Roberti, other
legislative leaders and Republican Gov. Deukmejian
admitted they had reached an impasse.
The plan contains what Roberti characterized as
"an insurance tax. The governor prefers to call it a
standby tax." It would take effect if the economy
worsened next year, but Assembly Republicans claim
it could be automatic tax boost.
A senator who voted against bill agreed.
"I would like to congratulate the Democrats for
putting together a tax package with Republican fin
gerprints all over the murder weapon." said Sen. H.L.
Richardson, (R-Arcadia).
"I guarantee you will give the peopleofCaliforniaa
tax increase which will be known in a short period of
time as the Deukmejian tax increase," he added. "If
you put a (tax increase) trigger out there somebody's
going to pull it. People are going to get hit in the
pocketbook."
But other senators said they would be relieved to

Senate nearly rejects Adelman
Washington — The Senate Foreign Relations Com
mittee moved to the brink of rejecting Kenneth
Adelman as the new head of the U.S. Arms Control
and Disarmament Agency yesterday, but postponed a
vote to give President Reagan an opportunity to
withdraw Adelman's nomination and name someone
else.
It was a stunning setback for the White House,
which had ousted arms control chief Eugene Rostow
last month and immediately proposed Adelman, the
deputy U.S. ambassador to the United Nations as his
successor.

With Republican Sens. Larry Pressler of South Da
kota and Charles Mathias Maryland joining nearly
solid Democratic opposition the committee was on
the verge of a 9-8 vote to reiect Adelman, a critic of
past arms control policies, before deciding to put the
controversial matter avde for a week
Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.), who led the fight
against Adelman from the outset, went along v\ith
other Democrats who pro Dosed a postponement
rather than reject the nomination outright
Sen Jospoh Biden (D-Del ). and Sen Paul Tsongas
(D-Masv). both contended that no purpose would be
served by embarrassing the president on the issue at a
time when U S arms control policy is at the center of
controversy in West German election campaigns.
Tsongas said he had gone to the Srate Department
and privately urged that the nomination be
withdrawn Biden said he had cautioned Vice Presi
dent George Bush late Tuesday agamst pushing the
nomination to a showdown.
Angola, South Africa negotiate
Washington — Angoia and South Africa have put a
de facto cease-fire into effect along their war-torn
frontier 3nd a formal d'sengagemen! pact is expected
soon as a result of direct negotiations between the
two countries, according to U.S officials
The effect of the pact would be to push Cuban
troops stationed in Angola and African guerrillas raid
ing into the disputed territory of Namibia out of the
war zone, and to halt the punishing raids into Angola
by South African troops. The South African raids,
rather than a highly public ized American diplomatic
drive in fhe rei<ion. appear to have brought the
Angolans to the negotiating table, diplomats say.
Because the South African-Arigolan negotiations
apparently do not provide for any further steps
toward independence for Namibia or eventual with
drawal of Cuban forces from Angola, Western and
African countries involved in the protracted multi
national negotiations for a Namibian settlement are
concerned that the bilateral cease-fire could
stalemate further progress on Namibia.
The fear, which also has been expressed privately
by some U S officials, is that agreement with Angola
will reduce pressure on South Africa to tyrant early in
dependence I '• Namibia, also known as South-West
Attica.

Reagan backs down

Washington — President Reagan declared last
night he retains full confidence in Environmental Pro
tection Agency chief Anne Gorsuch, but retreated on
the assertion of executive privilege that spurred the
House to charge her with contempt of Congress.
As White House negotiators tried to arrange a com
promise with congressional leaders over the delivery
o' previously withheld documents, Reagan told a na
tionally broadcast news conference that "I can no
longer insist on executive privilege if there is a suspi
f 'oh n minds of the Ame'ica" people that it 'S
being used to cover up wrongdoing."
At the same time, Reagan said he has ordered "a
complete investigation by the Jjstice Department

into every charge that has been made" over possible
mismanagement of the nation's "superfund" pro
gram to clean up hazardous waste sites.
Reagan opened his 16th formal news conference
with the declaration that the economy "has begun to
flex its muscles," but urged quick congressional ac
tion on a jobs bill he said would provide work without
worsening budget deficits.
Reagan outlined a $4 3 billion unemployment
package, even as some House Republicans |oined
Democrats in saying that the government should do
more.
He said the plan he advocates is a compromise, and
not "another quick fix" jobs plan He said Congress
should pass it and have it ready for his signature in

March.
It includes $4 billion in accelerated spending on
federal construction and repair projects, Rea
gan said would create up to 470,000 jobs, $2.9 billion
in supplementary unemployment insurance, and
$300 million in relief for jobless Americans in dire
need.
He said it all would be consistent with his basic eco
nomic recovery plan ' It funds no makework jobs."
he said "Instead we're speeding up projects thar are
already planned and needed "
Begin keeps party support
ferusalern — The Israeli Parliament, on straight par
tv-line votes, rejected yesterday 'hree separate mo

t'ons of no confidence in Prime Minister Menachem
Begin's government over the investigation of the
Beirut refugee camp massacre.
In a 64-56 vote on the motions, which followed 61-2
hours of often-acrimonious debate, every member of
the six parties that make up Begin's coalition voted to
support the government while every member of the
three opposition parties voted to oust the govern
ment from office.
It was the first time in 11 no-confidence tests that
Begin has won since he was re-elected 18monthsago
that all 120 membprs of the Knesset (Parliament)
voted and that no member crossed party lines.
Former Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and former
Foreign Minister Abba Eban pressed the demand of
the opposition Labor Party for Begin's government to
resign as a result of the report of the judicial com
mission which investigated the Sept. 16-18 massacre at
the Sabra and Chatilla refugee camps.
Hundreds of Palestinian civilians were killed by
Lebanese Christian militiamen after Israeli authorities
allowed the militiamen to enter the camps to mop up
Palestinian guerrillas believed to be hiding there.
Opposition speakers said that the government
should have stepped down. They complained that
Ariel Sharon should have quit the Cabinet instead of
just leaving the job of defense minister.
Replying on behalf of the government, Justice Min
ister Moshe Nissim said that the commission absolved
Israel of any direct responsibility for the killings. He
said that "shortcomings are part and parcel of any
war."
Volcker predicts recovery
Washington — Federal Reserve Chairman Paul
Volcker announced new money growth targets yes
terday that he said will clear the way for a 1983 eco
nomic recovery with lower interest rates and less in
flation.
While the projected increase in the money supply
this year will be slightly smaller than in 1982, Volcker
told the Senate Banking Committee, the new targets
"are fully compatible with easier market conditions
and lower interest rates."
Volcker said Federal Reserve officials were more
optimistic than President Reagan's economic ad
visers, foreseeing 1983 growth of 3.5 percent to 4 per
cent, although they believe unemployment will hov
er close to the double-digit level of 10 percent
throughout the year. The decisions discussed by
Volcker were made last week by the Federal Open
Market Committee, the policy-making arm of the na
tion's central bank which includes Volcker and the six
other members of the Federal Reserve Board as well
as presidents of five regional Federal Reserve banks.
Private analysts said the new ranges proposed for
growth of the money supply were likely to increase
the prospect of recovery from recession and set the
stage for a reduction in short-term borrowing
charges.
"The Fed is setting targets that wil! ailow a good
sized recovery to occur," said Allen Sinai, a monetary
specialist with Data Resources Inc., a private research
firm "Tnp c e targets are a presv~ript ! on for Icwer in
terest rates."
Donald Raiff, vice president and senior economist
with Northern Trust Co. of Chicago, agreed with this
analysis. The targets mean that the Federal Reserve
will not havetotighten upon moneysupplygrowthas
the recovery develops, Raiff said, because it has left
itself more room to maneuver.
Kirkpatrick cancels speech
Berkeley, Calif. — jeane Kirkpatrick, U.S. am
bassador to the United Nations, canceled a speech at
the University of California here yesterday, the day af
ter hecklers shouted her down and forced her to
leave the stage during a talk on human rights.

The disruption involved about two dozen pro
testors among a standing-room-only audience of 800,
gathered to hear Kirkpatrick deliver the university's
1983 Jefferson Memorial Lecture.
An aide to the ambassador said yesterday that she
would have no immediate comment on the incident
and was returning to Washington on "urgent govern
ment business." University officials said members of
Kirkpatrick's security staff had expressed concern for
her safety following Tuesday's incident.
University Vice Chancellor Roderic Park said the
ambassador had indicated to him that she believed
that she would be "ineffective" in any further campus
appearance.
Park registered dismay over the disruption, noting
with irony that it had occurred on a campus that gave
birth to the student "free speech movement" two
decades ago.
"I don't believe that mindless heckling and anger is
free speech," the vice chancellor said. "...In the
future, we will have to try to control things more ef
fectively than we d.d yesterday. We intend to do just
that."
The disruption of Kirkpatrick's speech was the
latest in a series of similar incidents that have plagued
the campus recently.
Commencement and Charter Day activities have
been interrupted with assorted protests by small
groups of students and non-students.
Last spring, hecklers taunted former Black Panther
leader Eldridge Cleaver during a speech he made
praising America and denouncing Communism. One
heckler rushed the stage to assail Cleaver, but was re
pelled with a punch by the speaker.
Shultz defends Reagan policy
Washington — Secretary of State George Shultz,
under heavy congressional questioning, said yester
day that the Reagan administration opposes nego
tiations with Salvadoran guerrillas because "we're not
going to be in the position of allowing somebody to
shoot their v\ay into the government."
Shultz, who testified before the House Foreign Af
fairs Committee, was forced into an uncharac
teristically heated defense of administration policy by
committee members who repeatedly made clear
their distaste for the Salvadoran regime's human
rights record and their concern that the adminis
tration wants only a military solution to the civil war.
He also angrily characterized as having "no founda
tion in fact" a Washington Post article last week re
porting that Thomas Enders, assistant secretary of
state for inte r-American affairs, had suggested a two
track strategy of supporting the Salvadoran govern
ment while promoting negotiations with the guer
rillas.
Shultz, who testified on behalf of the adminis
tration's $14 5 billion fiscal-1984 foreign aid request,
made these othe r points during the wide-ranging
questioning
— President Reagan has no intention of giving up
his "zero-option" arms control proposal, which
would require the Soviet Union to dismantle all of its
intermediate-range nuclear missiles in Europe in ex
change for the United States not deploying similar

missiles on the continent.
— Syrian Foreign Minister Abdul Halim Khaddam
has assured Shultz personally that Syria will pull its
troops out of Lebanon when Israeli forces leave.
— The next step in the Middle East hinges on
whether Jordan's King Hussein decides to join a
broadened peace process. While acknowledging that
Hussein is undecided, Shultz said the king "has
spoken to us very favorably about the president's in
itiative" and the United States is "optimistic" about
the chances of Jordanian participation.
Senate approves compromise
Sacramento — The state Senate easily approved a
compromise solution to the $1.5 billion deficit yester
day and sent it to the Assembly — where Republican
opposition could block the plan.
The bipartisan vote was 33-6 for the bill, sponsored
by Assemblyman Richard Robinson (D-Garden
Grove), as senators said they hoped it could prevent
or limit the issuance of IOUs next week to cover state
bills.
The Assembly vote on the bill, expected yesterday,
would put pressure on the Assembly Republicans to
agree to the compromise, which includes a potential
1-cent sales tax increase.
"It's a decent compromise," said Senate President
Pro Tem David Roberti, (D-Los Angeles), before the
Senate voted on the plan, "a compromise that tries to

As White House negotiators tried to arrange a com
promise with congressional leaders over the delivery
o' previously withheld documents, Reagan told a na
tionally broadcast news conference that "I can no
longer insist on executive privilege if there is a suspi
f 'oh n minds of the Ame'ica" people that it 'S
being used to cover up wrongdoing."
At the same time, Reagan said he has ordered "a
complete investigation by the Jjstice Department

into every charge that has been made" over possible
mismanagement of the nation's "superfund" pro
gram to clean up hazardous waste sites.
Reagan opened his 16th formal news conference
with the declaration that the economy "has begun to
flex its muscles," but urged quick congressional ac
tion on a jobs bill he said would provide work without
worsening budget deficits.
Reagan outlined a $4 3 billion unemployment
package, even as some House Republicans |oined
Democrats in saying that the government should do
more.
He said the plan he advocates is a compromise, and
not "another quick fix" jobs plan He said Congress
should pass it and have it ready for his signature in

March.
It includes $4 billion in accelerated spending on
federal construction and repair projects, Rea
gan said would create up to 470,000 jobs, $2.9 billion
in supplementary unemployment insurance, and
$300 million in relief for jobless Americans in dire
need.
He said it all would be consistent with his basic eco
nomic recovery plan ' It funds no makework jobs."
he said "Instead we're speeding up projects thar are
already planned and needed "
Begin keeps party support
ferusalern — The Israeli Parliament, on straight par
tv-line votes, rejected yesterday 'hree separate mo

t'ons of no confidence in Prime Minister Menachem
Begin's government over the investigation of the
Beirut refugee camp massacre.
In a 64-56 vote on the motions, which followed 61-2
hours of often-acrimonious debate, every member of
the six parties that make up Begin's coalition voted to
support the government while every member of the
three opposition parties voted to oust the govern
ment from office.
It was the first time in 11 no-confidence tests that
Begin has won since he was re-elected 18monthsago
that all 120 membprs of the Knesset (Parliament)
voted and that no member crossed party lines.
Former Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and former
Foreign Minister Abba Eban pressed the demand of
the opposition Labor Party for Begin's government to
resign as a result of the report of the judicial com
mission which investigated the Sept. 16-18 massacre at
the Sabra and Chatilla refugee camps.
Hundreds of Palestinian civilians were killed by
Lebanese Christian militiamen after Israeli authorities
allowed the militiamen to enter the camps to mop up
Palestinian guerrillas believed to be hiding there.
Opposition speakers said that the government
should have stepped down. They complained that
Ariel Sharon should have quit the Cabinet instead of
just leaving the job of defense minister.
Replying on behalf of the government, Justice Min
ister Moshe Nissim said that the commission absolved
Israel of any direct responsibility for the killings. He
said that "shortcomings are part and parcel of any
war."
Volcker predicts recovery
Washington — Federal Reserve Chairman Paul
Volcker announced new money growth targets yes
terday that he said will clear the way for a 1983 eco
nomic recovery with lower interest rates and less in
flation.
While the projected increase in the money supply
this year will be slightly smaller than in 1982, Volcker
told the Senate Banking Committee, the new targets
"are fully compatible with easier market conditions
and lower interest rates."
Volcker said Federal Reserve officials were more
optimistic than President Reagan's economic ad
visers, foreseeing 1983 growth of 3.5 percent to 4 per
cent, although they believe unemployment will hov
er close to the double-digit level of 10 percent
throughout the year. The decisions discussed by
Volcker were made last week by the Federal Open
Market Committee, the policy-making arm of the na
tion's central bank which includes Volcker and the six
other members of the Federal Reserve Board as well
as presidents of five regional Federal Reserve banks.
Private analysts said the new ranges proposed for
growth of the money supply were likely to increase
the prospect of recovery from recession and set the
stage for a reduction in short-term borrowing
charges.
"The Fed is setting targets that wil! ailow a good
sized recovery to occur," said Allen Sinai, a monetary
specialist with Data Resources Inc., a private research
firm "Tnp c e targets are a presv~ript ! on for Icwer in
terest rates."
Donald Raiff, vice president and senior economist
with Northern Trust Co. of Chicago, agreed with this
analysis. The targets mean that the Federal Reserve
will not havetotighten upon moneysupplygrowthas
the recovery develops, Raiff said, because it has left
itself more room to maneuver.
Kirkpatrick cancels speech
Berkeley, Calif. — jeane Kirkpatrick, U.S. am
bassador to the United Nations, canceled a speech at
the University of California here yesterday, the day af
ter hecklers shouted her down and forced her to
leave the stage during a talk on human rights.

The disruption involved about two dozen pro
testors among a standing-room-only audience of 800,
gathered to hear Kirkpatrick deliver the university's
1983 Jefferson Memorial Lecture.
An aide to the ambassador said yesterday that she
would have no immediate comment on the incident
and was returning to Washington on "urgent govern
ment business." University officials said members of
Kirkpatrick's security staff had expressed concern for
her safety following Tuesday's incident.
University Vice Chancellor Roderic Park said the
ambassador had indicated to him that she believed
that she would be "ineffective" in any further campus
appearance.
Park registered dismay over the disruption, noting
with irony that it had occurred on a campus that gave
birth to the student "free speech movement" two
decades ago.
"I don't believe that mindless heckling and anger is
free speech," the vice chancellor said. "...In the
future, we will have to try to control things more ef
fectively than we d.d yesterday. We intend to do just
that."
The disruption of Kirkpatrick's speech was the
latest in a series of similar incidents that have plagued
the campus recently.
Commencement and Charter Day activities have
been interrupted with assorted protests by small
groups of students and non-students.
Last spring, hecklers taunted former Black Panther
leader Eldridge Cleaver during a speech he made
praising America and denouncing Communism. One
heckler rushed the stage to assail Cleaver, but was re
pelled with a punch by the speaker.
Shultz defends Reagan policy
Washington — Secretary of State George Shultz,
under heavy congressional questioning, said yester
day that the Reagan administration opposes nego
tiations with Salvadoran guerrillas because "we're not
going to be in the position of allowing somebody to
shoot their v\ay into the government."
Shultz, who testified before the House Foreign Af
fairs Committee, was forced into an uncharac
teristically heated defense of administration policy by
committee members who repeatedly made clear
their distaste for the Salvadoran regime's human
rights record and their concern that the adminis
tration wants only a military solution to the civil war.
He also angrily characterized as having "no founda
tion in fact" a Washington Post article last week re
porting that Thomas Enders, assistant secretary of
state for inte r-American affairs, had suggested a two
track strategy of supporting the Salvadoran govern
ment while promoting negotiations with the guer
rillas.
Shultz, who testified on behalf of the adminis
tration's $14 5 billion fiscal-1984 foreign aid request,
made these othe r points during the wide-ranging
questioning
— President Reagan has no intention of giving up
his "zero-option" arms control proposal, which
would require the Soviet Union to dismantle all of its
intermediate-range nuclear missiles in Europe in ex
change for the United States not deploying similar

missiles on the continent.
— Syrian Foreign Minister Abdul Halim Khaddam
has assured Shultz personally that Syria will pull its
troops out of Lebanon when Israeli forces leave.
— The next step in the Middle East hinges on
whether Jordan's King Hussein decides to join a
broadened peace process. While acknowledging that
Hussein is undecided, Shultz said the king "has
spoken to us very favorably about the president's in
itiative" and the United States is "optimistic" about
the chances of Jordanian participation.
Senate approves compromise
Sacramento — The state Senate easily approved a
compromise solution to the $1.5 billion deficit yester
day and sent it to the Assembly — where Republican
opposition could block the plan.
The bipartisan vote was 33-6 for the bill, sponsored
by Assemblyman Richard Robinson (D-Garden
Grove), as senators said they hoped it could prevent
or limit the issuance of IOUs next week to cover state
bills.
The Assembly vote on the bill, expected yesterday,
would put pressure on the Assembly Republicans to
agree to the compromise, which includes a potential
1-cent sales tax increase.
"It's a decent compromise," said Senate President
Pro Tem David Roberti, (D-Los Angeles), before the
Senate voted on the plan, "a compromise that tries to
blend the major concerns of all factions."
Senate approval came six hours after Roberti, other
legislative leaders and Republican Gov. Deukmejian
admitted they had reached an impasse.
The plan contains what Roberti characterized as
"an insurance tax. The governor prefers to call it a
standby tax." It would take effect if the economy
worsened next year, but Assembly Republicans claim
it could be automatic tax boost.
A senator who voted against bill agreed.
"I would like to congratulate the Democrats for
putting together a tax package with Republican fin
gerprints all over the murder weapon." said Sen. H.L.
Richardson, (R-Arcadia).
"I guarantee you will give the peopleofCaliforniaa
tax increase which will be known in a short period of
time as the Deukmejian tax increase," he added. "If
you put a (tax increase) trigger out there somebody's
going to pull it. People are going to get hit in the
pocketbook."
But other senators said they would be relieved to
have the long stalemate over
Senate nearly rejects Adelman
Washington — The Senate Foreign Relations Com
mittee moved to the brink of rejecting Kenneth
Adelman as the new head of the U.S. Arms Control
and Disarmament Agency yesterday, but postponed a
vote to give President Reagan an opportunity to
withdraw Adelman's nomination and name someone
else.
It was a stunning setback for the White House,
which had ousted arms control chief Eugene Rostow
last month and immediately proposed Adelman, the
deputy U.S. ambassador to the United Nations as his
successor.

With Republican Sens. Larry Pressler of South Da
kota and Charles Mathias Maryland joining nearly
solid Democratic opposition the committee was on
the verge of a 9-8 vote to reiect Adelman, a critic of
past arms control policies, before deciding to put the
controversial matter avde for a week
Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.), who led the fight
against Adelman from the outset, went along v\ith
other Democrats who pro Dosed a postponement
rather than reject the nomination outright
Sen Jospoh Biden (D-Del ). and Sen Paul Tsongas
(D-Masv). both contended that no purpose would be
served by embarrassing the president on the issue at a
time when U S arms control policy is at the center of
controversy in West German election campaigns.
Tsongas said he had gone to the Srate Department
and privately urged that the nomination be
withdrawn Biden said he had cautioned Vice Presi
dent George Bush late Tuesday agamst pushing the
nomination to a showdown.
Angola, South Africa negotiate
Washington — Angoia and South Africa have put a
de facto cease-fire into effect along their war-torn
frontier 3nd a formal d'sengagemen! pact is expected
soon as a result of direct negotiations between the
two countries, according to U.S officials
The effect of the pact would be to push Cuban
troops stationed in Angola and African guerrillas raid
ing into the disputed territory of Namibia out of the
war zone, and to halt the punishing raids into Angola
by South African troops. The South African raids,
rather than a highly public ized American diplomatic
drive in fhe rei<ion. appear to have brought the
Angolans to the negotiating table, diplomats say.
Because the South African-Arigolan negotiations
apparently do not provide for any further steps
toward independence for Namibia or eventual with
drawal of Cuban forces from Angola, Western and
African countries involved in the protracted multi
national negotiations for a Namibian settlement are
concerned that the bilateral cease-fire could
stalemate further progress on Namibia.
The fear, which also has been expressed privately
by some U S officials, is that agreement with Angola
will reduce pressure on South Africa to tyrant early in
dependence I '• Namibia, also known as South-West
Attica.
