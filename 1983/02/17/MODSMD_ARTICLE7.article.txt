## Problems at the Environmental Protection Agency Congress looks at EPA "superfund" 
### 
Compiled from news reports ,ind wire service-
In recent weeks, Environmental Protection Agency adminis
trator Anne Gorsuch has been under broad attack bv House
Democrats, who charged that her agency had been plav ing poli
tics with the Si.6 billion "superfund" created by Congress to
clean up toxic waste dumps around the country.
Gorsuch has also been accused of trying to obstruct a congres
sional investigation :nto tP* s hand! lg of the learuip program
— including its treatment of 'he Mringfellow acid pits near River
side, Caiif., a 24-acre chemical dump steeped in toxic wastes
since the mid- 1950s
The "supertund" was created bv Congress in 1979, in response
to public outrage over New York's Love Canal and other
dumpsites which t vc waste- were contaminating communities
across the nation. Vet. manv national and local officials feel that
action by the EPA has been too Aow , as onlv five ot the 418 "most
dangerous ' sites las identified hv the fP \ have been cleaned up.
The congressional inquiry, spearheaded by Rep. lohn Dingeli
(D-Michigan), chairman of ;h- Hou-e Energy and Commerce
Committee is investigating whefhei superfund grants for clean
ing up hazardous chi mical dump sites were delayed — ot, in
some cases, speeded up — be ore last November's elections to
help Republican cand.dates.
In defending herselt, Gorsuch sa>d. "We operate in a political
atmosphere in ail of our decision making processes." But she
added that political considerations have never influenced any
superfund decisions, to mv knowledge, nor will they in the
future.
Dingeli said he is looking into the quest ; on of whether funds
tor dealing with the Stringfellow -ite .vere deliberately held up to
help San Diego Mayor Pete Wilsor. in his Senate race against
then-Cov. Fdmund Brown |r. Wilson won.
Dingeli, who heads both the full Energy and Commerce Com
mittee and its subcommittee on oversight and investigations,
accused EPA officials of impeding the investigation. He said fhev
did so try o'dering r '-'A vf me r nh r« not vo mee with sutcom

and unless they are accompanied bv an attorney ana a Republican
congressman or a GOP congressional staffer.
Gorsuch - ai,i ~dy ;■(.!.ii. >. u emp: Cingress • hargefor
refusing to turn over documents to House investigators pursuing
other issues and embroiled in controversy over the firing of the
top official in charge of the super und — defended the restric
tions on interviews with Dinged . deles as a matter oi "protecting
employees rights."
Dingeli had warned Gorsuch in a letter Tuesday that he consid
ers such conditions "highly objectionable and a further obstruc
tion of the committee's investigation He said: The policy de
lineated would have a cleat intimidating effect on the candor of
EPA personnel involved in discussions.'
Dingeli scheduled a closed meeting ot the subcommittee today
to consider subpoenas tor at least 25 EPA emplovees to give
evidence on Superfund and toxa waste cleanup.
Some EPA officials acknowledged privately last week that funds
to clean up the Stringfellow ac id pits indeed mav have been neld
back to irritate Brown. But one EPA official said; Teli me an
administration that doesn t plav politics with the timing ot grants.
They all do it.and we're not any different "
