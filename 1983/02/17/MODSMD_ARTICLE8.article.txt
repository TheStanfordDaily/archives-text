weeks.
"This should send a signal to

Kaufman said.
Meanwhile, the White
House also proposed resolving
the dispute with a House sub
committee over EPA docu

cess to all the information thev
need " a senior White House
offic lal said.
The official, White House
counsel Fred Fielding, said no
response has been heard from
the House subcommittee
chaired by Rep. Elliott Levitas,
(D-Ga.) The congressman was
traveling in France on White

House business and could not
be reached for comment.
But a spokeperson in Levitas'
office said earlier this week it
would be two or three days be
fore Levitas decided whether
to accept a White House com
promise on that issue. Levitas
said after the compromise
offer last weekend that he
wanted to discuss it with con
gressional leaders before de
ciding
Fielding would give no de
tails about the proposal, which
was made during a three
and-a-half hour meeting last
Saturday he attended with
Levitas and Deputy Attorney
General Fdward Schmults.
