C v>-.rrn.'ing t •. <» 'tv'oiiinic'nddlton of its
general counsel, the Environmental Protection
Agency agreed last fall to a private settlement
that may enable 24 major companies to avoid
millions of dollars ot liability for cleaning up a
large Indiana hazardous waste dump.
The agreement, involving the Seymour Re
cycling Corporation dump near Seymour, Ind.,
was announced bv Rita M. Lavelle, then head of
the agency's hazardous waste cleanup program.
Lavelle, who was fired from the EPA last week,
called it a maior accomplishment" that "has no
equal in EPA history.' -
Western Electric, IBM, Cummins Engine
Company and NCR Inc., are among those com
panies which use the dump and that eventually
settled with the EPA.
The Seymour agreement, and others like it,
are central to the current controversy of the EPA

Four congressional panels are investigating
whether the agcncy is making "sweetheart '
deals with polluters or delaying hazardous
waste clump cleanups for political reasons.
Among other things, it is the secrecy with
which the agreement was made that has raised
doubts among state officials and environmen
talists. "It was all held behind closed doors,"
said Indiana state Rep. Baron Hill, who lives in
Seymour. "We tried to get in, but we weren't
allowed. They just wouldn't let us in."
Of particular concern to Hill, and the 340
other firms who were identified as having
clumped waste in Seymour, is whether the set
tlement will be enough to clean up the site, or
whether the settlement will have to come from
somewhere else — perhaps the city of Seymour,
the state ot Indian* or the companies who have
not yet settled.
