# Kennedy defends housing project

### STEPHANIE SANDBERG 
In a recent letter to Menlo Park
Mayor Pro Tem, Peg Cunn, Univer
sity President Donald Kennedy
strongly defended the University's
position on Stanford West in the con
tinuing controversy over the pro
posed housing project.
Kennedy defended the choice of
the site in the letter, saying "from a
planning point of view, we believe
that it makes much more sense to
hold our central campus lands for
educational facilities and faculty and
student housing and to use periph
eral areas for staff and public units."
The proposed site for the project is
ideal for both the community and the
University, Kennedy claimed, citing
the flat land, the installed utility lines
and the location in the city.
Kennedy also discussed the impor
tance of the project in attracting fac
ulty to the University. "The need for
housing has become critical in our
efforts to recruit and retain a front
rank faculty," the letter stated.
The president's letter was a re
sponse to a letter left with him by
Cunn herself, two weeks ago, at a
meeting of the Menlo Park City

Council with Kennedy and four other
University administrators. The
Menlo Park City Council letter out
lined the reasons why Menlo Park
residents oppose Stanford West as it
is now planned.
In reaction to Kennedy's letter,
Gunn expressed appreciation for the
friendly tone of the president's let
ter, adding that she continues to
hope for a reasonable reduction in
density of the project on the part of
the University.
Gunn refused to comment further
on Kennedy's letter.
Principally, the Menlo Park City
Council said that Stanford West was
too large, and that it must either be
reduced in size or moved on to Stan
ford land to be acceptable to the
Menlo Park community. Gunn
pointed out that the addition of 1000
residents to that area of Palo Alto
would significantly alter the face of
the neighborhood, turning what is
now a quiet rural area with much
free land into a congested city. Stan
ford West would actually be in Palo
Alto's jurisdiction but it borders on
Menlo Park.
