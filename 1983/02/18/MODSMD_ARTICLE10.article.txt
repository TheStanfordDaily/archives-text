The Department of State's decision to bar
Soviet Consul Gennaudv Gurkin from speak
ing at Bechtel International Center last week
lowered the United States to the game-playing
level of the Soviet Union.
In diplomatic terms, the Department of State
based the decision on the concept of "interna
tional reciprocity." U.S. officials have never
been allowed to openly present American views
in the Soviet Union.
This is not the first time retaliation has been
taken against the Soviet Union. Former Presi
dent Jimmy Carter responded to the Soviet mili
tary presence in Afghanistan through the grain
embargo and the Olympic boycott.
Those actions were controversial when im
plemented and their effectiveness is still being
debated.
But the benefits of denying Gurkin the oppor
tunity to speak — for the second time in a year
— are difficult to envision.

We doubt that Soviet officials are so con
cerned with having their officials speak in this
country that they are going to decide to change
their oppressive policies. And it is even less
likely that a speech by a Soviet will create an
American crusade for communism.
But even if that possibility exists, foreign offi
cials should be given the opportunity to speak.
Citizens of this country believe in and fight for
freedom ot speech and freedom of the press.
Many lawsuits are settled on the validity of the
First Amendment and probably would not exist
without that legislation. We believe the De
partment of State's decision to cancel Gurkin's
speech contradicts American ideals.
Non-beneficial moves made under the pre
tense of international reciprocity could serve to
turn an already chilly relationship into ice that
can't be broken. Department of State officials
may not like to have cliches thrown at them, but
our sentiment toward their action is best por
trayed by one: Two wrongs don't make a right.
