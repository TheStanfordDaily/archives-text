From the initial funding of lane and Leland
Stanford with which the University was founded
and the original Quad was built over 90 years
ago, to the recent anonymous gift of $1 million
to renovate and improve the Quad of today,
donations received from foundations, corpora
tions and individuals have been instrumental in
the growth of the University into one of the
nation's most respected learning institutions.
More than 20 percent of University funds
come from gifts and non-governmental grants.
In January alone, the University accepted more
than $10 million in gifts.
Typically, funding for major projects pours in
from hundreds of different sources. This makes
it difficult for those of us who benefit from these
gifts to show our appreciation. This past week,
however, brought a noteworthy exception to
the rule.

Last Monday, David and Lucile Packard
pledged a total of $20 million toward construc
tion of the new Children's Hospital at Stanford
(CHAS). Both of the Packards are Stanford
alumni. Mr. Packard is the chairman of the
board of Hewlett-Packard, the electronics
firm. Mrs. Packard is vice-chairman of both the
existing and the proposed CHAS boards. The
Packards have also donated funds to the Uni
versity toward the construction of the Terman
Engineering Center and for a number of fellow
ships to engineering graduate students.
The pledge is exceptional because it is the
largest personal gift ever received by the Uni
versity, because it will finance half of the $40
million construction costs of the Children's
Hospital, but mostly because it is a superlative
act of kindness, dedicated to the future of the
community.
