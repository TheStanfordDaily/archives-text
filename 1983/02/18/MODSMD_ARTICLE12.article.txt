# What to do about taxation
## 
### 
Last Saturday I happened to over
hearavery interesting and emotional
conversation between a middle-aged
man and a younger woman. No, it
was far from a romantic conversation
but it has given me quite a lot to think
about. The woman was advocating
an idea she was developing: "Self-
Designated-Taxing" is how (hey re
ferred to it. The man said the whole
thing was impossible idealism and
the woman retorted, saying that he
was in a rut and dangerously pes
simistic about the potential of
American citizens. I will do my best
here to transcribe their argument.
"Well, you've complained about
how the government doesn't always
spend its tax money the way you'd
like it to be spent," were her first
words that caught my attention.
"You also said you wish you had a
better idea of exactly where the tax
money, that you earned, goes, or
why it goes wherever it does, and
you'd rather feel you had more im
portance — 'input' — you called it,
into the budgeting process, right?"
"Yes, of course, like a lot of
people, but get to this idea you're so
excited about. I suppose it's going to
solve all those disappointments," he
questioned with a sarcastic laugh.
"Yes, you cynic, I think it might.
See, as it stands now politicians are
elected to represent the interests of
the citizens in their district. They
have to speculate on those interests
when they decide where our money
goes, and they have to fund pro
grams in the way best suited for the
upkeep of the community. Now,
when we get our tax forms and spend
a couple hours one day filling them
out, we simply fold the papers, stuff
them in an envelope, and drop them
in the mailbox mumbling the whole
time — then it's out of our hands,
right? We pay our government with a
vague idea about where that money
is going and, sometimes, don't even
care very much — it's a law to pay our
certain percent, and you know
plenty of people who bend over
backwards to get out of paying as
much as possible, but, in any case,
we obey with, at best, neutral emo
tions. This is what we need — if citi
zens were more involved with the
decision-making process that distri
butes tax money, there would be

greater interest in the mechanics of
our society. We'd have a better in
formed and more valuable public, an
interested public, instead of the one
that now doles out the bills with a
little signature, then covers its face."
"That isn't a solution, honey —
that's all very abstract."
"Well, I was just warming up. Here
is the proposition: at the end of all
private citizens' tax forms there will
be a section that lists all the programs
that legislatures expect to fund, and
the percentage of the previous
budget that went into each of the
programs. The taxpayers will divide
the money that's due from then in
come and designate how much they
think should be spent on each of the
various programs," she paused to
shake her head at the cynic's distraut
look.
"Listen, this is the way Selt-
Designated-Taxing can take two al
ternate forms: the first possibility is
that the money will be spent in
exactly the way each person desig
nates. We will think of ourselves as
paying for the services as a consumer
would, and to keep things from fal
ling apart, a politician would have to
take on a role of instructor to let us
know what he or she believes should
be done with our money. Out of
necessity, our representative would
have to work with us in a way he
never has before, drawing us into the
system instead of making us leary of
it, and feeling so alienated from it."
"My God, you are such an
idealist!"
"Not at all, but wait, the second
form of the proposition is more mild.
The way each taxpayer decides to di
vide up and distribute their tax
money will be taken by politicians as
recommendations. This way the
politicians don't have to second
guess the concerns of their repre
sentees, but they don't have to obey
the exact designations either. The tax
forms turn into perfectly accurate
polls of taxpayer interest."
"Fine. Now that you've given your
mind a little exercise, forget about it.
I'll give you at least half a dozen rea
sons why it's ridiculous. First of all,
we pay government to do all that for
us because that's their job. Blue
collar workers, and they're the ones

who carry America, don't want to
come home from the factory and
whip out their calculators to figure
out what percentage welfare' should
get. For another thing, laborers and
bureaucrats alike resent having any
of their earned money taken away in
the first place — if they had their way,
they would sign off all their taxes to
'social security' so they would get it
all back when they retire. Also, bos
ses and union leaders will try to make
their workers' decisions for them,
and the workers will listen.
"Then there's the fact that some
one like you would put all of your tax
money into education and let NATO
rot in Europe. Right wingers will put
all their money in defense and let
'streets and sanitation' crumble. This
system is too susceptable to trends.
"Next, there's the fact that politi
cians won't want to do anything
more than fit into an advertiser's
role, not a teacher's role, or they
might just instruct their voters along
the lines that would placate them
most — only tell them what they want
to hear.
"And finally, Ms. Idealist, there is no
reason for constituents to want to get
involved with this. We don't care.
You think a majority is going to wake
up suddenly with this new system,
and start reading New York Times
and The Wall Street lournal or go to
town meetings to hear their legis
lator speak so taxpayers can do their
task more responsibly? That is
ridiculous. We would fall apart," he
concluded and folded his arms.
"But your damn pessimism is just
an effect of the system we're in now,
not inherent," she replied, hurt.
"Apathy is a result of thinking we are
impotent — as long as we don't think
we have any input power, as long as
we only send off our money some
where and something happens, we
will complain from a standpoint of
being removed from power, rather
than being involved with it."
"Utopian," he said simply, and they
went on and on. I felt like I was read
ing Thucydides and two orators were
saying what we should do, convinc
ing me one way, then the opposite
way. What do you think of "Self-
Designated-Taxing?"
