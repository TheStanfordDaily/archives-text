## Univ. lags in minority hiring 
### 
The University administration has in recent months
created an impression within the community that Stan
ford has distinguished itself as an affirmative action em
ployer. This has been done primarily by the publication
of various newspaper articles. For example, an article
entitled "Minority hiring here betters national rate"
(Daily, Oct. 7) stated that it was unrealistic to expect
significant gains in affirmative action because "now the
original available group of minorities has been drained
and monumental gains, as then occurred, are impossi
ble (emphasis added) to achieve right now." Although
the Affirmative Action Office has stated that the article
misquoted, the impression created remains, and a cor
rection has not been issued.
Moreover, the article pointed out that . . other
member schools have not done as well as Stanford in
affirmative action."
Recently an article appeared in the )an. 12 issue of
Campus Report entitled "Substantive progress in affir
mative action." As evidence of substantive progress it
was pointed out that "there has been 'very slow but
consistent growth' in the proportion of minority em
employees in exempt job categories. . .
The thrust of these articles is that, given the lack of
qualified minorities available, Stanford has achieved fa
vorable results from its affirmative action efforts. This
impression, we believe, is erroneous. Worse yet, the
University's misleading assessment of its progress abets
continued inaction by the administration. For, in fact,
affirmative action at Stanford has suffered a further set
back because it has created a false sense of achieve
ment, thus sending the wrong signal to those who make
hiring and other personnel decisions here. The reality of
affirmative action at Stanford is quite different from the
impression created by these articles.
First, there is no truth to the statement that there are
no longer qualified minorities available to be able to
achieve affirmative action gains. Since the '60s a great
number of Hispanics and other minorities have gained
valuable experience qualifying them for even greater
responsibilities. A critical problem is, however, that we
still are not represented in higher levels of the organiza
tion. Second, while both articles acknowledge "unde
rutilization" of minorities in management, the jargonese
of affirmative action tends to blur the reality of how
miserably small minority representation really is.
This viewpoint is written from an Hispanic perspec
tive. However, it is enlightening to view the actual status
of minority and women staff at Sanford by examining the
following data for the period from January 1981 through
lanuary 1983.

The University Affirmative Action Plan published in
the Jan. 12 fails to provide the perspective offered by the
above data (these data were obtained from the Univer
sity Affirmative Action Office). The front-page article in
Campus Report cited the increase in exempt minorities
from 13.6 percent to 16.4 percent since 1978 as the basis
for claiming substantive progress. Yet, while Hispanics
are the fastest growing minority population in Calif, the
above data show that there isn't tven one Hispanic in
senior management, only two in middle mangement (no
better than in 1981) and our numbers have decreased in
lower management from 13 (5.6 percent) to 11 (4.1 per
cent).
The fact that there may be more minority exempt
employees than in 1978 is largely irrelevant when you
consider that they are heavily concentrated in the lower
ranks and are all but absent in higher positions. The!>e
data illustrate that for Hispanics, blacks, Asians, to<
some extent even white females, there has been regres
sion and not progress, substantive or otherwise.
Moreoever, even if "full utilization" is achieved, acord
ing to the University's "availability" statistics these fig
ures would remain largely unchanged. For example, the
availability figure set for Hispanics in middle manage
ment is 4 percent (according to the University's Jan. 1983
affirmative action availability data). This means that the
hiring of only two more Hispanics would result in "full
utilization." Thus, not only has the University failed to
achieve "full utilization" but the availability and goal
figures are established so low that its achievement
would be all but meaningless.
In view of the above data La Raza Staff Association
urges the University to depart from its established hiring
and career mobility patterns. A good starting point
would be to stop patting itself on the back, admit to the
serious nature of this situation for Hispanics, other
minorities and women, and adopt strategies which pro
duce meaningful affirmative action results.
