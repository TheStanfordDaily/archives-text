## Scholar's response 
### 
The derivation of the word
sophomore, according to Webster's
is from the Greek — sophos, wise
and moros, foolish — more at MO
RON. I supply this fascinating
etymological detail in my reply to
Shirish Date, identified as a sopho
more majoring in political science,
who wrote a column ("The Hoover
mystery solved," Daily, Feb. 14)
about a speech I delivered Feb. 8 and
which he listened to, or so I thought.
To base conclusions on one solit
ary speech by one scholarly indi
vidual who is only a Visiting Scholar is
hardly scholarly at all. It surely re
flects on Date's integrity to ignore
the fact that Hoover can boast of five
Nobel Prize laureates and the publi
cation of hundreds of scholarly vol
umes and monographs which are
used in many universities here and
abroad. Date has seriously misrepre
sented what I said in my speech but I
think I will let his wild charges go
unanswered. It is enough to say that
his column is a serious reflection on
the academic honor of my distin
guished colleagues since he imputes
to them my opinions.
And last, since he sneers at my
rude words about Stalin, Soviet
foreign policy and Yuri Andropov, it
would be a service to your readers
and even to himself if he would tell
us what he thinks about communist
totalitarianism and whether and how
his views differ from mine.
