Just as I predicted last week, we hadn't
heard the last of the bleu cheese issue. Lois
Ohms, a dietician with University Food Ser
vice, called me up this week to let me know
that the bleu cheese dressing used in Stern
and other halls is homemade, and the cheese
involved is Kraft bleu cheese. According to
Ohms, most dorm salad dressings are put to
gether by Food Service. Only the Italian and
some low-cal dressings are bought ready
made, in small bottles. She said it was found
they could serve a higher quality dressing if
they made it themselves.
On to the questions:
Why is it that the University has gone to
great expense to install bollards and chains
around the divider strips on Campus Drive
between Galvez Street and Palm Drive, and
yet is using the divider strip on the other side
of Palm Drive as an unsightly dump heapf
Are the trees to the east of Palm Drive more
valuable 112 From whom or what do they need
protection? Perhaps the trees to the west of
Palm Drive need bollards and chains to pro
tect them from the onslaught of the main
tenance crews/
I have several questions with regard to this
situation: 1) Why the bollards and chains in
the first place? 2) Were they purchased with
general funds, or did some altruistic alum
donate them? 3)Why the dumping along
Campus Drive? (Surely there are more dis
creet places for a mammoth compost heap.)
4) Is the dumping to continue indefinitely?

I don't know if I came up with satisfactory
answers to all of your questions, but here
goes.
First: why the bollards and chains. Accord
ing to Judy Chan of the Planning Office,
bollards everywhere are part of what is called
the Vehicle Control Program. The VCP is a
safety program: the bollards' role in it is to
show vehicles where they can and cannot go.
"Car drivers want to drive anywhere," Chan
said. The bollards and chains around the
Campus Drive median have another, more
specific purpose: to protect the trees. When
the soil around the bases of oaks and other
trees is unduly compacted, water isn't ab
sorbed around the trees' roots and bad things
result. One reason the median between
Galvez Street and Palm Drive is bollarded
while others aren't, according to Manager of
Labor and Grounds Herbert Fong, may be
that the parking problem is greater in that
area due to the stadium and Maples Pavilion.
Former Campus Planner Max Mazenko con
firmed this, saying the Planning Office felt
that the median west of Palm Drive was much
less likely to be parked or driven on. Chan
added that an area in the Campus Drive me
dian even farther west and south, near the

Medical Center, may need to be bollarded
soon because of problems with illegal park
ing.
No. 2: all aspects of the Vehicle Control
Program are paid for out of the General Plant
Improvement (GPI) fund, i.e., out of general
funds.
The dumping. Said Herbert Fong: "We
consider it mulch." The leaves and other
debris dumped in the median west of Palm
Drive (this is getting confusing, isn't it?) are
put there to discourage weed growth. The
process saves the University money in several
ways, according to Fong. It saves the expense
of hauling the debris to the dump, and since it
keeps out weeds it saves having to mow. Fong
said the University also would rather not use
chemicals to fight weeds, and the dumping
provides an organic solution.
And finally, yes, the debris will probably be
there indefinitely. Fong said the mulching
was "pretty much a year-round" process, be
cause the weeds will grow back any time the
debris is cleared out.
I have a question regarding the Marguerite
bus service. Why do they use such large
buses? This seems like a very inefficient and
wasteful practice to me, since I have never
seen more than five people on a bus at one
time (and I have ridden at all hours, including
"peak times"). And why did they get rid of
those cheery red and white jitneys they had a
few years back? Those seemed more suitable
for the task, not to mention more efficient,
less polluting, etc. Thanks.

Ah yes, the cheerful red and white jitneys.
Wonderful on a spring or summer day. Not so
hot when it rained. And, according to Barbara
Klein in the Housing Programs Office, in the
shop a good share of the time. (Please don't
ask me why the University's associate director
of housing answers questions about the
Marguerite. I don't want to find out.) "As far
as maintenance was concerned, they were
awful," she said, and since the little buses
were University-owned the repairs were Uni
versity-paid for. While she didn't have exact
figures for me, Klein said the current buses,
while admittedly big and ugly, are cheaper
for the University on a per-mile basisthanthe
smaller buses were. The bus service is pro
vided by an outside contractor, Peninsula
Charter Lines, which receives an hourly rate
and is better able to provide regular service
than the University was.
No tests have ever been done of the rela
tive environmental impacts of the two buses.
One thing that might surprise you, as it sur
prised me: the earlier buses were gasoline
powered, and not electric.

Just as I predicted last week, we hadn't
heard the last of the bleu cheese issue. Lois
Ohms, a dietician with University Food Ser
vice, called me up this week to let me know
that the bleu cheese dressing used in Stern
and other halls is homemade, and the cheese
involved is Kraft bleu cheese. According to
Ohms, most dorm salad dressings are put to
gether by Food Service. Only the Italian and
some low-cal dressings are bought ready
made, in small bottles. She said it was found
they could serve a higher quality dressing if
they made it themselves.
On to the questions:
Why is it that the University has gone to
great expense to install bollards and chains
around the divider strips on Campus Drive
between Galvez Street and Palm Drive, and
yet is using the divider strip on the other side
of Palm Drive as an unsightly dump heapf
Are the trees to the east of Palm Drive more
valuable 112 From whom or what do they need
protection? Perhaps the trees to the west of
Palm Drive need bollards and chains to pro
tect them from the onslaught of the main
tenance crews/
I have several questions with regard to this
situation: 1) Why the bollards and chains in
the first place? 2) Were they purchased with
general funds, or did some altruistic alum
donate them? 3)Why the dumping along
Campus Drive? (Surely there are more dis
creet places for a mammoth compost heap.)
4) Is the dumping to continue indefinitely?

I don't know if I came up with satisfactory
answers to all of your questions, but here
goes.
First: why the bollards and chains. Accord
ing to Judy Chan of the Planning Office,
bollards everywhere are part of what is called
the Vehicle Control Program. The VCP is a
safety program: the bollards' role in it is to
show vehicles where they can and cannot go.
"Car drivers want to drive anywhere," Chan
said. The bollards and chains around the
Campus Drive median have another, more
specific purpose: to protect the trees. When
the soil around the bases of oaks and other
trees is unduly compacted, water isn't ab
sorbed around the trees' roots and bad things
result. One reason the median between
Galvez Street and Palm Drive is bollarded
while others aren't, according to Manager of
Labor and Grounds Herbert Fong, may be
that the parking problem is greater in that
area due to the stadium and Maples Pavilion.
Former Campus Planner Max Mazenko con
firmed this, saying the Planning Office felt
that the median west of Palm Drive was much
less likely to be parked or driven on. Chan
added that an area in the Campus Drive me
dian even farther west and south, near the

Medical Center, may need to be bollarded
soon because of problems with illegal park
ing.
No. 2: all aspects of the Vehicle Control
Program are paid for out of the General Plant
Improvement (GPI) fund, i.e., out of general
funds.
The dumping. Said Herbert Fong: "We
consider it mulch." The leaves and other
debris dumped in the median west of Palm
Drive (this is getting confusing, isn't it?) are
put there to discourage weed growth. The
process saves the University money in several
ways, according to Fong. It saves the expense
of hauling the debris to the dump, and since it
keeps out weeds it saves having to mow. Fong
said the University also would rather not use
chemicals to fight weeds, and the dumping
provides an organic solution.
And finally, yes, the debris will probably be
there indefinitely. Fong said the mulching
was "pretty much a year-round" process, be
cause the weeds will grow back any time the
debris is cleared out.
I have a question regarding the Marguerite
bus service. Why do they use such large
buses? This seems like a very inefficient and
wasteful practice to me, since I have never
seen more than five people on a bus at one
time (and I have ridden at all hours, including
"peak times"). And why did they get rid of
those cheery red and white jitneys they had a
few years back? Those seemed more suitable
for the task, not to mention more efficient,
less polluting, etc. Thanks.

Ah yes, the cheerful red and white jitneys.
Wonderful on a spring or summer day. Not so
hot when it rained. And, according to Barbara
Klein in the Housing Programs Office, in the
shop a good share of the time. (Please don't
ask me why the University's associate director
of housing answers questions about the
Marguerite. I don't want to find out.) "As far
as maintenance was concerned, they were
awful," she said, and since the little buses
were University-owned the repairs were Uni
versity-paid for. While she didn't have exact
figures for me, Klein said the current buses,
while admittedly big and ugly, are cheaper
for the University on a per-mile basisthanthe
smaller buses were. The bus service is pro
vided by an outside contractor, Peninsula
Charter Lines, which receives an hourly rate
and is better able to provide regular service
than the University was.
No tests have ever been done of the rela
tive environmental impacts of the two buses.
One thing that might surprise you, as it sur
prised me: the earlier buses were gasoline
powered, and not electric.
