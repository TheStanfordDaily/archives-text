SCULPTURE?: Five groups of "sculptures," including "In the
Neighborhood" pictured above, have appeared across campus
since January. Mary jane Boscacci, creator of the works and a
graduate student in education, said, "It was kind of a project.
There's a lot of old-fashioned ideas of what art is. It's just a provoca
tive form of sculpture." The sculptures are wired to the ground and
most consist of particle board and tennis racquets.
