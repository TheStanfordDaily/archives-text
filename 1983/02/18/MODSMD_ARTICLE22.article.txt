# Flying Club provides thrill, inspires a feeling of freedom

Flying over Alcatraz, the helipad's broken
asphalt and the prison's green mossy roof
top lay exposed below. A small swarm of
tourists flowed colorfully out of the gray and
white hulk.
Wings tilting, the two-seater Cessna
quickly headed toward the City, a much
prouder sight with the towers standing up
and taking the air on an overcast and drizzly
afternoon.
"This is mv favorite trip," said Steve
Home, Stanford Flying Club instructor and
junior at the University. "I especially love it
at night, seeing the buildings and Ghiradelli
all lit up; that's why I fly — for times like
that."
Home has logged over 1000 hours on his
own and with the Club, which has planes at
the Palo Alto Airport and serves the Stanford
Community.
"I still love tlying. It is almost as exciting as
when I started," he said.
Quite a few other people in the area seem
to have caught the excitement too. Stan
ford's Club is 250 members strong, accord
ing to Bert Postma, director of operations.

"About 25 percent to 30 percent of the
members already have licenses. While we're
mostly a training operation, we also rent,"
he said.
Twelve Cessnas comprise the Flying
Club's fleet, with six ot them designated for
visual flight rules training, and the other six
for brush-up practice by licensed pilots, in
strument training, and aerobatic instruction,
according to Postma.
He added that the organization has had
various forms in its 35-year history. Started
by a few students who shared planes, the
ASSU eventually hired planes for student
use.
"About five years ago the University got
concerned about liability — it wanted the
Club to be independent," Postma said. It is
now a non-profit enterprise, he continued.
Home said that about 70 percent of the
Club's participants are students, with the
remainder working for related institutions
such as the Stanford Linear Accelerator or
the Medical Center.
Belonging to the latter group is Serge Rat
kovski, a SLAC employee and member of the
Club.

He said, "I work as a technician and my
feet are on the ground all the time. This is my
form of release." He added, "I think
everyone should learn how to fly."
Turning to the other side of private avia
tion, Home said, "Some students are really
practical. One doctor was going to have a
practice in New Mexico, and he wanted to fly
to the various small towns."
Crad student Karen Davis, a club member,
said, "Right now it's for fun and a diversion
from school. In the future I'll use it in busi
ness or some other activity.

'It's a freedom thing - a power
trip. You're doing something
that not everyone can do.
You're in control of a ship, for
that's what it is - an airship. I
like that/

After starting a company, she said she
wants to buy a Leer jet.
When asked who his top pupils are, Home
replied, "My best students as a group are
women. Guys tend to over-control the
plane, while women are much smoother on
the controls."
This smoothness is something that Home
emphasizes in the cockpit, he said, "The
main idea is to make very small move
ments."
At the beginning of a lesson, he sits down
with the student and familiarizes him or her
with the ground procedures.

Before the plane even leaves the rows of
other small craft, Home was busy checking
the gas tanks, engine oil and flaps on the
outside, and all the instrumentation within
the Honda-sized cabin.
There, he reviewed the plasticized
checklist, rapidly flicking the various
switches on and checking the radio.
"People ask me why I haven't memorized
this after all of my hours of flying. I tell them I
have; it's just safer to go over it anyway.
Every pilot does," he said.
He said that some students, with auto driv
ing ingrained within them, grab the control
wheel and turn it to make the plane turn. It
doesn't work.
"You have to develop new habit pat
terns," Home explained.
Talking about similar problems of begin
ners, he said, "They think that the plane has
a mind of its own and that it can control
them. It just takes a while to get over that.
"Everyone says, 'It's a freedom thing — a
power trip.' You can do something that not
everyone can do. You're in control of a ship;
for that's what it is — an airship. And I like
that."
