# New machine improves eye care

### JEN BLANK 
A device developed at
Stanford that greatly im
proves ultrasonic imaging
of the eye made its debut at
the annual Opthalmic Ul
trasound Conference last
weekend.
The prototype machine
has been used at Stanford
for the past four years. But
the instrument, being man
ufactured by STORZ In
strument Company of St.
Louis, is just now becoming
available on the market.
The imager was invented
and developed by Electrical
Engineering Prof, lames
Meindl, Alan Susal, a physi
cian specialist in opthamol
ogy, and Terry Walker, a
seniorengineering research
associate at the Stanford
Electronics Laboratory.
Calied the A/B Scan, the
machine combines complex
electronics and user
compatibility in a unique
opthalmic instrument that
enables opthalmologists to
make more precise diag
noses than ever before, ac
cording to its creators.
The key feature of the A/B
Scan is that it provides a
"real-time" or movie-like
image of processes taking
place within the eye, the
scientists say. Using a
hand-held probe, the user
can change the orientation
of the image which is
viewed on a television-like
screen.
Special integrated cir
cuits, described by Walker
as "a key ingredient" in the
production of the instru
ment, were first developed
by electrical engineering
professor lames Plummer
and later modified by
Plummer and Walker for
use with the A/B Scan.

"The Stanford scanner is
unique in that it uses scan
ning and multiple array
technology for imaging the
eye," said Susal, who oper
ates the machine when it is
used each Tuesday at the
Stanford Eye Clinic. Other
scanners all use single ar
rays, he said,
There are three major ad
vantages of the A/B Scanner,
explained Susal. The object,

in this case the eye, is elec
tronically scanned at much
faster rates. Sixty images per
second are viewed on the
screen, and this is at least
two times faster than other
similar apparati.
In addition, he said, the
image is more stable than
old images, which often
flickered. This is because
the scan is done electroni
cally, without the use of a
motor.
Finally, the multiple array
provides a rectangular field
of view and a larger area can
be scanned.
Although designed
primarily for use on the eye,
the scanner may be used for
imaging small body parts. In
the past it has been used in
radiology at the Stanford
Medical Center to examine
the hearts and brains of
premature infants.
The machine is user
compatible, that is, de

signed with the user's needs
in mind. A ZBO micro
computer controls a large
part of the fine adjustments
and circumvents the need
for many knobs and but
tons. A polaroid camera is
set up to take photographs.
Additionally, the "real
time" information pre
sented on the screen can be
recorded on a standard vid
eotape and stored for later
viewing.

"There has been some
controversy as to the impor
tance of "real-time" imag
ing with regard to its diag
nostic potential. In the years
we've been using the in
strument, it's been very
successful," said Susal.
Pathological processes can
be seen from movement on
the screen, he added.
"For example," Susal ex
plained, "the vitreous gela
tin in the eye is normally
clear. Clinical vitreous
opacification (clouding)
may occur because of
hemorrhaging. This can be
seen on the screen. The
scanner is more sensitive
than other machines so it
picks up more ultra-sonic
detail."
The sample photographs,
one from the A/B Scan, one
from a static B scanner,
show this. Cloudiness,
probably caused by hemor
rhaging, is shown in places
where the image is not

black. Although both
photos show cloudiness,
the white specks in the vit
reous cavity of the A/B
Scan's photo represent ad
ditional areasof hemorrhag
ing that the other scan failed
to pick up.
One drawback to the A/B
Scan is the fact that the reso
lution of the image on the
screen is not quite as good
as that produced by other
scanners. Because of this,
the image is sometimes
more difficult to interpret.
The scanner is also impor
tant in treating tumors, as
well as many other eye
problems. The screen actu
ally shows the blood vessels
in tumors, and from this the
doctor can deduce informa
tion regarding the nature of
the tumor. By studying the
screen as the patient moves
his or her eye from side to
side, doctors are able to
evaluate the patient's prob
lems and determine the po
tential for surgical correc
tion.
With cataract patients,
most of the examinations
using the scanner are made
to insure that the patient's
eye(s) are healthy and that
motion within the eye is
normal. The A/B Scan pro
totype, used at the Stanford
Eye Clinic, is not used for
precise surgical meas
urements. The manufac
tured version, however, is
designed to measure the
exact distances and amount
of correction needed in
lenses for cataract surgery.
The selling price of the A/B
Scan will be approximately
$25,000, said Susal. This
might restrict it to larger
hospitals, but it is very inex
pensive to run, so there will
not be a limited number of
patients who use it, he ad
ded.



IMPROVED IMAGE: Both display screens have two
parts: the image ot the eye corresponds with the B scan
while the A scan provides a transect through the center of
the image, showing depth and strength of the ultrasonic
image.

Note that in earlier scans, the image is blurred (left).
With the new ultrasonic imager, resolution im
provements allow doctors to see small hemorrhages that
the earlier imaging instruments missed (right).
