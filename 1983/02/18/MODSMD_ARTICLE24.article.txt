## Are limbs replaceable? 
### HARA LEVY 
If Oscar Goldman had been confronted with
rebuilding Steve Austin at the Stanford Medical
Center today, he would have stated: "Gentle
men we can rebuild him; we have the technol
ogy, but we need to overcome the immunologi
cal barriers for successful limb transplantation."
In the past decade, phenomenal advancements
in plastic surgery have made reconstruction of
the human body possible.
Several years ago, a young lady was pushed
into the path of an oncoming subway train, se
verely severing her hand. With her hand placed
in ice (the ice slows the metabolism of the limb
enabling it to survive for awhile without oxy
gen), she was rushed to the hospital where mic
rosurgeons successfully reattached the hand.
But, if the hand had been so badly mangled that
reattachment was impossible, the hand would
have been amputated.
Surgeons today are hopeful that they will be
able to attach a limb, received from a donor, to a
patient who might otherwise have lost the limb.
With proper medical treatment and physical
therapy, these patients would also regain full
use of the new limb.
"We have the technical know how now," said
Dr. Lars Vistnes, surgery professor and Chief of
the Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery Clinic.
"As soon as we can overcome the immunologi
cal barriers, we'll beable totransplant limbs. It's
the next big leap."
The transplantation of the limb from a donor
poses the threat of rejection of the tissue. Ac
cording to Vistnes, the "immunological bar
rier," which causes rejection of the limb, is
being alleviated with the development and re
finement immunosupprent drugs such as Cyc
losporine. Cyclosporine is also currently used in
heart and lung transplants.
Any immunological suppresant used for
organ transplants may be used for limb trans
plants. The immunosuppressants, however,
lower the body's ability to fight off infection.

"The reason we won't risk transplanting limbs
and possible rnjortion bv the patient's bndv is
because a limb, unlike a heart or lung, is not
essential to sustain life," said Dr. Robert Chase,
surgery professor and head of the hand unit of
the Clinic.
But new grafting techniques and mic
rosurgery have enabled surgeons to salvage
limbs that might otherwise have to be ampu
tated. Previously, in order to skin graft from one
part of the body to another, the skin could be
moved only if the blood supply remained intact
Now, surgeons can completely remove a unit
of skin and muscle from one area, and transfer it
to another area, without the two areas having to
be physically attached to each other during the
process. With the aid of microscope surgery,
doctors can reconnect miniscule tendons,
blood vessels, muscles and other components
of the body.
"Microsurgery is the most dramatic technical
advance in years, because it allows surgeons to
transfer parts of the body from one place to
another," said Chase.
Although limb "salvaging" has been success
ful. limb transplantation has not yet been done
with humans. The ideal limb transplant, stated
Chase, comes from an identical twin of the reci
pient, where immunological rejection is
avoided. This reiterates that the technology to
transplant a limb is available: the immunological
barrier is the only hinderance.
Plastic and reconstructive surgery "covers the
waterfront" stated Chase. It is used to overcome
deformities and disabilities ranging from birth
defects, infections, malignancies, injuries, and
degenerate diseases.
Chase feels that plastic and reconstructive will
play a vital role in the future of the medical
profession: "For today's world medicine's
major contribution will go toward increasing the
quality of life and survival of individuals treated.
