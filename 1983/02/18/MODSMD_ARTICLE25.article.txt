# Care unit ethics discussed
## 
### PHYLLIS BURTON 
Tom Raffin, assistant professor of respiratory
medicine, initiated the Progress in Medicine
Lecture Series last Wednesday with his lecture
"Intensive Life Support Systems: Present Prac
tice and Moral Issues." The speech was the first
in a six-week series entitled "Who shall live?
Progress and Ethical Dilemmas of Intensive
Care." The series is an annual community out
reach program sponsored by Stanford Univer
sity Medical Center.
Speaking in Fairchild Auditorium, Raffin ad
dressed the issue of Intenvise Care Units (ICU)
for the critically wounded. "It is the responsibil
ity of the physician not only to save and restore
the salvageable, but also to help the hopeless to
a peacful and dignified death," Raffin said.
Raffin is associate director of the ICU here,
medical director of the Respiratory Therapy De
partment and assistant chief of medicine at the
Medical School, and assistant professor here.
Drawing from his experiences, Ral.in depicts
in his lecture what a visitor in an ICU experi
ences.
"Lights blink, monitors beep, buzzers inces
santly go on and are turned off. Someone you
actually know is hooked up to a breathing ma
chine, chest expanding with each blow from the
ventilator, eyes glazed. Multicolored fluids are
pumped in and drained out through tubes that
emerge from the edges of the sheets. You see
someone you used to touch and talk to â€” you
can't anymore. You feel forced, distant, fright
ened, out of control."
Raffin said almost any critically ill person arriv
ing in the emergency room will have acces to an
ICU bed. "It is much less complex and stressful
to place such a patient on a breathing machine
in ICU than to decide he has no chance to regain
good quality of life and should be allowed to
die. "Obtaining a bed in the ICU is the easy way
out," temporarily, says Raffin.
Raffin says increasing numbers of patients are

being treated in ICU each year, partly due to
the explosive availability of federal and private
insurance health care dollars over the past two
decades.
This has enabled ICUs to proliferate in
number and grow in size, according to Raffin.
Twenty years ago, fewer than 30 percent of the
hospitals in the United States had intensive care
units. Today most hospitals can offer critically
ill patients the services of an ICU.
An example of a case illustrating the extreme
difficulty of deciding the probably chances of
survival and return to a "good quality of life"
was offered by Raffin: "Ellen" was an 18-
year-old college freshman who attempted
suicide by shooting herself in the neck.
Careful examination revealed thai she had de
stroyed her spina) cord, probably had some
brain damage, the extent of which was unclear,
and had destroyed her windpipe and larynx.
Even it she survived, she would be a total quad
raplegic and would never be able to speak again.
As Ellen's condition continued to deteriorate,
and after several highly emotional and difficult
meetings between the medical team and the
family, it was finally decided that life-support
should be discontinued.
"I o help cope with such situations, Raffin rec
ommends preparing for the time when you
might be in an ICU, without the ability to com
municate in a meaningful way. He made four
suggestions on how to accomplish this. First, he
said, discuss with your family and friends your
ideas and viewpoints about being on life sup
port equipment. Second, let your doctors
know, now, that they do not have to feel guilty in
making a decision to recommend or withdraw
life support. Third, Raffin recommends signing a
living will and let people know where copies of it
are. Fourth, and most important, is to maintain
excellent communication between the family
and the health care team.
