# Conferences generate funds

If it weren't for a small office
of ladies in Encina Commons,
student on-campus room rates
could be substantially higher
than they are at the present
time.
The office is located at 123
Encina Commons, adjacent to
Encina Station, and is called the
Conference Office. It's job is to
fill as many of the student resi
dences during the summer
months with off-campus vis
itors as part of various confer
ences, conventions and
camps.
The result is a lot of money,
last summer, the office gros
sed $2.5 million by housing
12,000 in 122 conferences and
accounted for 10.5 percent of
Stanford's funds. The net of
each summer's earnings goes
back into the student room and
board account for the follow
ing academic year.
"It (the Conference Office)
is an established, important
program for the University,"
Manager of Conferences Lois
Fariello said. "The University
depends upon our income
when budgeting for the stu
dent housing tees."
Both Stanford and the Palo
Alto area benefit economically

from the "tourist trade" of the
conferees, Fariello said.
Besides making money, the
Conference Office brings
people to an otherwise dead
Stanford campus in the sum
mer. Although a summer
school program does exist, the
summer conferees make Stan
ford the hull of activity it is
from lune through September.
Conferences range from the
Executive Program in Organi
zational Change to the Stan
ford Basketball Camp to Genet
ics and Biotechnology of Bacilli
to the Yearbook/Newspaper
by-the-Bay Workshop to CADA
Spirit Camp for cheerleaders.
The number of participants
at a given conference varies
from six in the Minority Access
to Research Careers to the 500
expected for the Corporate
Cup Relays in |uly.
Fariello and company use
University residences that
would otherwise sit vacant dur
ing the summer. Since the di
rect costs of the dormitories
and houses are incurred with
or without residents in the
summer, the housing costs for
the Conference Office are min
imal.
Over the past three decades,
Stanford's Conference Office

has grown to the point where it
is now recognized as one of the
biggest, let alone best, pro
grams in the country, accord
ing to Fariello.
"We're one of the largest (in
the nation) as far as the number
of spaces that we occupy in the
summer," Fariello said. "The
occupancy rate (43 percent) is
much higher than most (other
universities)."
In 1%1, the Conference Of
fice housed 1700 people as part
of 38 conferences and grossed
$325,178. Twenty years later, in
the office's biggest summer,
Fariello booked 133 confer
ences with 14,000 participants
and grossed $2.25 million.
But Fariello is quick to point
out one main constraint has
kept her from filling all the re
sidences all the time. "We have
academically related confer
ences sponsored by University
departments," she said.
"Other universities don't
require sponsorships and so
they can take many more
groups. I turn a lot of groups
away that do not have univer
sity sponsorships."
One advantage of the host
ing conferences at Stanford is
the facilities and services avail
able here. "We have more on

the Stanford campus than a
hotel has on their property."
The quality of the food ser
vice can be improved in the
summer since the conferee pay
more per meal than do stu
dents. Only a few of the cam
pus kitchens are opened dur
ing the summer and the quality
in each depends on the type of
groups that stay in that resi
dence.
The Stanford Executive Pro
gram (SEP) is the "creme de la
creme" of conferences, as it
receives the greatest number
of "first-cabin" services. SEP
rents the entire Lagunita Court
even though they do not use all
the rooms. The food service
includes several theme meals
as well.
"The participants (in SEP)
have often said that the food at
the University is better than
most restaurants they have
eaten at in the area," Fariello
said.
The Conference Office,
which last summer employed a
staff of 80, is at a point where
Fariello would like to expand
again. One possibility is com
puters, she said. "I'd like to be
able to push a button and find
800 beds and where they'd be
on campus.
