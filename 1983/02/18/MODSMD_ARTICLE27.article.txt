Different Seasons

There seems to be some kind of curse in
this country on artists wtio do one thing
well. Woody Allen, to name the most famil
iar case, is arguably the most gifted comic
filmmaker we have today, yet he tortures
himself trying to produce a "respectable"
tragedy. The same thing seems to be gnaw
ing at Steven King.
A fan once asked him why, since he
seemed such a good writer, he only wrote
horror stories. "What makes you think,"
King replied, "that I have a choice?" A neat
little story, that, and it gives you insight into
the mind of a man who can produce a work
such as Salem's Lot or The Shining. How
ever, in Different Seasons, (Viking Press)
King strains to give himself a choice by writ
ing four novellas, three of which definitely

cannot be defined as just horror stories —
there are no vampires in this book.
True to its title, the book is divided into
four parts that each, in title if less so in story,
deal with one of the seasons. Starting with
spring and proceeding through to winter,
King has written a book that is thematically
stillborn — it fails as a "whole" — but which
does have some very satisfying moments.
The spring story, titled "Hope Springs Et
ernal" and subtitled "Rita Hayworth and
Shawshank Redemption," is a prison escape
story. The jacket calls it"the most satisfying
tale of unjust imprisonment and offbeat es
cape since 7/»e Count of Monte Cristo. Par
don me, but I beg to differ.
There is unjust imprisonment, I concede.
Andy Dufresne, a banker in Maine, whose
wife c heats on him, is convicted of murder
ing both his wife and her lover — an act he
admits he wanted to do but for which he
lacked the nerve. Add some circumstantial
evidence, and it's a forgone conclusion.
Welcome to Shawshank prison, Andy.
Andy is, of course, innocent. In fact,
through the wonderful device of fictional
coincidence, we get to meet a guy who
shared a cell with the guy who actually
committed the murders. Despite that, how
ever, Andy doesn't get out because he's use
ful — and used.
Because of the dangers of the "unpro
tected" life, Dufresne becomes the invest
ment banker for the employees of the prison
and eventually is put to work laundering
money for the corrupt wardens. Because he
knows too much, Andy is not allowed to
press his claim for release after the real mur
derer is revealed by the other prisoner.
That's where the story hinges. Andy, who
has been wrongfully jailed and longing for
freedom since his first days, is denied re
lease by the corrupt warden who he has
aided in return for protection, a prison li
brary and his own room. It would seem that
Andy would be a little resentful, and that his
offbeat escape would thus be something
special — but it's not.

The story ends satisfyingly, for both Andy
and his narrator-friend, but the est ape is
unremarkable as far as prison escapes go.
The story suffers in the same way — an
"offbeat" escape should be special, and a
Steven King prison story should be remark
able, but neither of them are. Rather than
leading off the novel, this story should be
buried in some anthology like Generally
Okay but Unexceptional Prison Escape
Tales.
More interesting and better written is "Fall
from Innocence" subtitled "The Body,"
which tells a psuedo-autobiographical story
about some kids hiking through Maine to
take a look at the body of a child who died
lost in the woods. However, this story c heats
the reader in another way.
I can't understand what the attraction is in
writing that kind of background to a story. If
you're going to write an autobiographical
story, then do so and let your reader feel the
kind of intimacy that comes out of autobiog
raphy. If you're writing in a slory, then, dis
tance yourself and create a character.
King's story — with his "alter-ego" Gor
don LaChance — is annoying because it
hedges this distinction so thoroughly that I
spent most of the time while reading it trying
to figure out how closely the character
hewed to King. On the surface it's easy
enough. The boy is from Maine, a natural
storyteller, and has his life altered by a hor
rible sight.
However, King writes the story from the
point of view of the man reminiscing about
his childhood, and when the boy starts a
story King finishes it in the form of a pub
lished article, complete with "Used by per
mission" and date of publication.
Worse than that, however, is that im
mediately after the story he mocks it for its
unprofessionalism. Being as it seems that
that story amounts to the product of a com
mittee the size of the Chinese Communist
Party it seems a rather odd thing for King to
say. His comments damn the reader — it you
liked it as you were reading, then your taste

is not as good as his. If you didn't like it, well,
then you're insensitive. King (whoever he is)
notes that the story contained notes of
wonderfulness; it was "better than (it had)
any right to be."
Aside from those nasty tricks the story
stands by itself pretty well indeed. It even
has a reference to Shawshank prison, so it
fits into the book as well as the others. I he
trip the boys take to see the body is well
done, the events and the forbodings pass in
and out of the story and mesh excellently,
mirroring the manic-depressive c haracter of
childhood. Aside from the above literary
trick and a certain tendency to over
foreshadow, the story is well worth reading-

Well worth-while
The story is set in the modern day, and
[odd Bowden, ail-Americ an boy, athlete and
scholar, discovers to his joy that a neighbor
is actually Kurt Dussander, "The Blood-
Fiend of Patin." To Dussander's surprise
and disgust — Todd does not want to turn

him in, but instead wants Dussander to tell
him, graphically, of the horrors of the prison
ramp — all the "gooshy stuff." The story
deals with the effect that the stories have on
both characters; from the emergency of
buried memories and nightmares in Dus
sander to the corruption of Todd Bowden,
who becomes more of a monster than Dus
sander.
This story is excellently written, from
Todd's disappointment that the seedy old
man he sees doesn I meet his image of the
inhuman Nazi to the fact that Dussander's
nightmares are dispelled when he sleeps in
the fake SS uniform Fodd bought for him. All
the little touches are there, and the storyline
spirals into a greater and greater web of evil:
King has c reated the most credible world of
pure evil in fiction.
The characters chillingly slide into inhu
manity, and Todd fights to keep his image
safe and his reality from school, his parents
and his girlfriend. It's a nice touch: Dussan
der although not contrite, does not come
off as just an evil Nazi, and Todd is a fiend
with a winning smile. I he only objection I
have to the story is how well Todd maintains
his facade. If he cannot sleep easily and his
every word to his parents is backed by an
unspoken obsenity how c an he fool them all
so long? This is a minor objection, however.
"A Winter's Tale " or "The Breathing
Method," is |ust an unexceptional horror
tale, done in the style of "Tales from the
White M<irt." It's the shortest and least in
novative of all the stories — fun to read but
nothing to get upset over.
With the exception of the summer story
that is a tilting summary to the book Steven
King seems to be catching his breath, ready
ing himself to return to the horror he writes
so well -as he promises in the afterword —
after The Dead Zone and Cujo, which had no
haunted hotels or vampires. Stay tuned for
the next: a haunted car.
