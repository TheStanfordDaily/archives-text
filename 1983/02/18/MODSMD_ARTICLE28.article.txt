### Charles Berlitz Simon Schuster SCOTT AREY 
Doomsday 1999 A.D.

In December of 1 1 >82 the earth "wobbled"
— \\ ere you there? Probably not, but Charles
7he Bermuda Triangle Berlitz must have
been somewhere on the deep interior of a
continent bracing himself for a catastrophe.
In his new book Doomsday 1999 A.D. (Si
mon \ Schuster), Berlitz, grandson of the
founder of the famous Berlitz language
schools, combines ancient prophecy and
"modern science to predict the end ot
civilization as we know it.
In his countdown to doom Berlitz predicts
that the tidal pull from the alignment of the
planets around our sun will "cause in
creased sunspot activity which, implement
ing the blast of the solar wind of charged
particles across the earth will affect the mol
ten inner tides ot the globe, especially at the
crucial fault lines which form the plate
boundaries, and shake the earth at its axis,
setting off a series of tremendous
earthquakes and vocanic eruptions." Fortu
nately for the people ot the earth, with the
possible exception of Berlitz et al., this event
(predicted for 1982) did not occur, and while
that is damaging to the credibility of the
book, it has only minor impact in compari
son with the crippling effect ot Berlitz's writ
ing style.
While it is possible that Berlitz, who claims
to be fluent in 27 languages, just does not
translate well into the English language, it
seems more likely that he is simply insensi
tive to the limits of using superlatives. He
banalizes adjectives into tranquilizing prose
that could wear down even the most avid
legal historian. Words like "cataclysmic,"
"catastrophic," "terrible," "chaotic,"
• worldwide" and "enormous" are so over

used that they begin to lose anv distinct
meaning, making the reader even more
doubtful about the validity of the claims,
while lulling him into unconsciousness.
Bv far Berlitz's biggest claim is that civiliza
tion has already been wiped out once and
possibly many times before our recorded
history began. Outside of the great discrep
ancy between the dawn of man and the be
ginning of recorded history, he does not
make a very good case, and borrows much
information irom his previous book The
Mystery of Atlantis.
After his introductory chapter he attempts
what comes off as a somewhat comical de
scription of Doomsday 999, when all of
medieval turope supposedly turned mar
velously humanistic in anticipation of 'he
final judgment. They then reverted to their
old ways ot selfishness when nothing hap-
P l ' ned - .

Watch T.V. instead

If Berlitz's book has any value at all it

would have to be comedic entertainment
from his outrageous quasi-scientific predii -
Hons, liesides the threat of planetary align
ment previously mentioned destruction
could a/so come from: 1) The melting of the
polar ice caps, which would "flood the
earth caused by the greenhouse effect. 2)
Displacement of the earth's magnetic poles
causing the earth's lithosphere to rotate to a
new position, "somewhat as if the loose skin
of a tangerine slipped around the fruit and
settled at a different location." 3) A polar
shift causing the earth to "flip" in space. 4) A
pollutant buildup causing the cooling of the
earth, another "Ice Age" and culminating in
magnetic displacement. 5) A huge meteor
i rashes into the earth changing its orbit. 6) A
small planetoid or asteroid gets caught in the
earth's gravitational field causing extreme
seismic activity and tidal shifts. 7) A black
hole passes through the earth ( Results un
known?'). 8) An atomic explosion blasts a
"hole in the ozone layer," causing the earth
to slowly fry under solar exposure. 9) A hy
drogen bomb exploded in the ocean starts a
reaction turning the earth into a sun.
Although the first of his contentions,
however unlikely, have some minor basis in
fact, his later ones transcend absurdity, dis
crediting the whole book. Berlitz relies heav
ily on reliable sources such as Nostradamus
and lean Dixon, and tries to compensate toi
their lack of credibility by mentioning Pro
lessor Amos Nur of Stanford.
These vain and underhanded attempts to
substantiate prophet's and psychic's visions
falls short and not surprisingly the book may
be found in the "Mystery and Occult" sec
tion of your local bookstore, for anyone who
is foolish enough to buy it.
