# New ASSU fee plan gets mixed reaction
## 
### SID ATKINS Staff writer 
This week the ASSU Appropriations Commit
tee is reviewing the budget requests submitted
by campus organizations hoping to receive fee
assessments next year under a new system that
has drawn mixed reaction from student leaders.
The review is part of the new fee assessment
system approved by the ASSU Senate last month
requiring campus organizations to submit a de
tailed outline of their budgets to the ASSU if they
wish to receive a fee assessment. Under the new
System, groups must propose the total amount
tbey wish to receive next year.
This amount, if approved by the ASSU Senate
and the student body, will be divided propor
tionately over the four quarters of the school
year (approximately 30 percent for fall, winter,
spring and 10 percent for summer), and levied to
the students.
If the senate does not approve a group's fee
request, the only way for them to get it on the
ballot this spring is to collect a petition with the
signatures of 20 percent of the student body.
However, if a senate majority of three-fifths or
more approves the request, an organization still
needs a 10 percent petition. In the old system, a
petition was not needed.
Leaders of some groups oppose the new pro
cedures. KZSU station manager |im Mooney
said that the ASSU is creating more red tape and
that they might not be acting in the students
interest. "I think they're complicating something
that doesn't really need to be complicated.
They're actingas if they know how money should
be spent in organization "X," no matter what. In

the case of KZSU, I don't think they do."
However, the chairman of the appropriations
committee, David Porter, believes that the new
system will allow the student organizations
greater flexibility. "They will be able to ask for
exactly what they need, whereas in the old sys
tem they would have to ask for the full $10,000
even if their budget was only $4000," Porter said.
In the new system, no longer will students
simply be assessed $1 per quarter for each or
ganization on the ballot. According to Umot
McGrath, ASSU graduate senator and one of the
authors of the new reform, individual groups
may receive odd amounts either more or less
than $1.
Fees will be levied in even lump-sums at the
beginning of quarter. Bet when students claim
refunds, they may receive the amounts that each
group receives in revenue, which under the new
system will likely be uneven numbers such as 77
cents or $1.23. McGrath said when giving out
refunds the ASSU plans to round off to the
nearest 25 cents.
Craig Spearman, ASSU elections commis
sioner, cited increased information for students
as another possible advantage of the new sys
tem. "A lot of people aren't interested in re
searching each group that they're giving money
to. This way, the group's budget is right in front
of them."
President of Club Sports, Richie Sobel, said he
respected the ASSU's motives for creating the
reforms, but was a "little worried" about how the
students will react to the new system. "I think
some groups are going a little too far. It should
be interesting to see how the students react to

this. They may look at the overall figure and say
'Hey, I think $50,000 is a little too much,' and ask
for their money back."
Club Sports' own budget of $36,000 has already
been approved by the committee. Sobel said that
after deducting 25 percent for refunds, his group
will receive almost the same amount as under the
old system, or about $27,000.
KZSU's proposed budget of $36,000, however,
failed to gain the approval of the appropriations
«*aid . Thf'l thP Com
mittor \a hi not recommend 10 the senate at
Tuesday's meeting that KZSU's fee request be
approved. In this case, Mooney said, it is very
unlikely that senate will approve KZSU's budget
either.
The Guest Professorship Board has proposed
the largest fee of all campus groups for next year
— $56,995. This figure has already been approved
by the appropriations committee. Initially, the
board had asked for a whopping $102,000. By
cutting that figure almost in half, the appropria
tions committee left the board only enough
money for three professors, instead of the five
that the board had originally requested.
Seth Linfield, director of the board , said he
thought the appropriations comimittee did a
good job in reviewing the board's budget, and
he agreed with certain aspects of the reforms.
"It's a good idea for everyone to know where
each and every dollar is going," he said.
Linfield added that in the board all funds go
towards paying for professors.
The Daily has asked for $50,000,
the second largest amount of any
group. Editor Karen Springen said
this is approximately what the Daily
would have received under the old
system, after correcting for inflation
and refunds.
The ASSU Speakers Bureau has re
quested $40,075 for next year's as
sessments. "In our minds, the
budget is exactly the same as last
year," said Susan )ones, director of
the bureau.
"The fact that it will be presented

as $40,000 is the fault of the new sys
tem. I hope people can look at it ob
jectively," she said.
lones also questioned the need for
all groups to petition — as required
by the new bill. "Every year we have
passed by a large margin, yet we still
have to petition," she said.
There are, however, still a few
other groups which as of yesterday
had not received the appropriations
committee's approval on their
budget's. They include: the
Graduate Student Association, the
ASSU Lobby Office, the Women's
Center and the Black Student Union.
Currently these groups are negotiat
ing with the committee for approval
of their budget.
