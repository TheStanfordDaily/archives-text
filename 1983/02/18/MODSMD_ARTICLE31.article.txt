## 'The Wager': a small winner with a snake-eye script 
### TONY KELLY 
Don't get the Mark Medoff who wrote Children of
a Lesser Cod confused with the Mark Medoff who
wrote The Wager They are the same person, but the
latter play, written back when Medoff was a graduate
student in the English Department here and pro
duced by the Drama Department in the Nitery last
weekend, is mean-spirited where the former is more
sentimental. The Wager bears a much closer re
semblance to Medoff's When You Comin' Back, Red
Ryder? of the early 70s, in which a deranged Vietnam
vet holds a diner full of typical American types
hostage. In both works, there is little actual violence,
though a lot is threatened; most of the time, the char
acters tend to face off and unleash verbal tirades at
one another until they break down and realize their
own inadequacies. Sort of like Lillian Hellman, but
without the politics.
This is not to say, however, that a production of The
Wager is destined for the same misanthropic fate as
the play itself. Watching the Drama Department's
presentation, one can tell that director Christine
Roum and the cast worked hard to lighten up the
bleak nature of the play, emphasizing the humor
where they could and generally appearing like a
loose, natural bunch of folks living in Escondido Vil
lage (the setting of the play is at "a Northern Califor
nia university," but Medoff was at Stanford when he
wrote the play and the set design is particularly Vil
lage-like). But what we end upwith isa verygood pro
duction of a pretty bad script, for almost every mo
ment of humor or emotion in the show is stunted by
Medoff's prodigious spite and Byzantine sentence
structures.

The play concerns two sets of roommates in a cam
pus apartment building: Leeds and Ward (Joe Chris
tiano and Orlando Ward), an obviously mismatched
pair of graduate students, and Ron and Honor
Stevens, a mismatched but married pair of graduate
students. All this academia has particular implications
for the dialogue; not only are we watching characters
who appear to genuinely hate each other, but they
also insist on using their respective intellects for the
express purpose of pouring salt in each others'
wounds.
Such a script raises more than a few fundamental
questions, mostly along the lines of why these people
bother hanging around each other. It's difficult to be
lieve that Stevens and Honor have been married for
five years, or if so, what their relationship could possi
bly have been like. And if Leeds and Ward could ever
be assigned as roommates, then the Escondido Village
housing system deserves a thorough onceover.
Because of all this structural baggage, The Wager
works best in its comedic moments, when we can ig
nore the crossfire and appreciate the chances the ac
tors have to actually move around the stage. The dra
matic scenes in the show seem a bit static, as if the
lines had enough force to move the story on their
own. They do, but the end result is more often re
pellent than engaging.
Fortunately, and somewhat surprisingly under the
circumstances, the production values of this per
formance of The Wager are of an extremely high stan
dard, especially the acting. The only real casualty is
Lisa Glass, who has done some very good work in the
past (in last year's Uncommon Women and Others
and with a difficult part in The Good Soul of Setzuan)

but seems ill at easf in the role of Honor
Stevens. Though Glass lets down her guard somewhat
near the end of the play, one still gets the feeling that
she is just as distant as the inscrutable Leeds.
Joe Christfano, as Leeds, has an enormously appeal
ing voice, and he is so natural in his movement that it
is difficult to remember that there is incredibly little
justification for his words or actions (there is a little bit
of dime-store Freudian analysis mentioned by way of
explanation, but it's too slim for my taste). Hearing an
actor like Christiano say so many things that border
on the ridiculous clearly defines the difference be
tween the play and the production.
Faring far better are Steve Vineberg and Orlando
Ward, mostly because they have better — and funnier
— things to say. As Ron Stevens, Vineberg still has to
come to terms with the uglinessof the relationships in
The Wager; because of his initial naivete, we still have
some sympathy for him. Stevens' parting shot of
"Shalom, schrnucks" is particularly enjoyable, be
cause it is a cathartic farewell for him and a sharp
relief from the harangues of the previous two hours.
After last year's Moonchildren and The Wager, Or
lando Ward has the art of the extended put-on down
pat; in this production, he is especially good at joust
ing one-on-one with Christiano. But while in Moon
children he obviously enjoyed the jokes, here the
barricades of words are erected more out of fear than
fun. That in itself is all right, but it leads to a dead end
of sorts. When Ward had to stop playing in Moon
children, it was an affecting moment. In The Wager,
there's no such feeling; for all his onstage looseness,
Ward rarely relaxes his defenses — or rather, Mark
Medoff never lets him.
