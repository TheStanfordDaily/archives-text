### STEVE ODELL Senior sports Writer 
Los Angeles — Star-studded
and tenth-ranked UCLA used a
team effort to defeat a stingy
Stanford team 99-86 last night
in a Pacific-1(1 Conference bas
ketball game at Pauley Pavilion
with seven players scoring in
double figures.
Forward Darren Daye led the
Bruins with 18 points and six
assists while sophomore cen
ter Brad Wright scored 15
points on six of six shooting
from the floor and blocked five
shots in injured Stuart Gray's
absence.
The Bruin>, now 18-3 overall
and a conference-leading 10-1
in the Pac-10, broke open a tight
game with a 1 7-4 spurt in a span
of 5:14 earl\ in the second half
that put them ahead 64-46.
UCLA led just 47-42 with 17:08
remaining atter Stanford's
Andy Fischer made two foul
shots.
But then Daye completed a
three-point play on a fast-break
feed from Kenny Fields, and
Wright hit two free throws.
After Keith lones, who led
the Cardinal in scoring with 22
points, made a lay-in, Daye hit
a 15-footer and Rod Foster fol
lowed with a body control
jumper in the lane.
lones hit another lay-in be
fore an eight point Bruins
streak finished the Cardinal
off.
Wright hit a hook shot in the
lane, Daye nailed a jumper
from the choke post, Gary
Maloncon followed a misshot
and guard Michael Holton
connected from the baseline to
give UCLA the biggest lead at
18.
Stanford refused to quit and
battled back, rattling off a
seven-point run of its own to
bring the Cardinal to within
68-59 with 8:59 remaining. The
streak consisted of two lories
field goals and a Steve Brown
three-point play.
The closest Stanford came
the rest of the way was eight
points.
"We don't jump as high and
we're not as tall, so we have to

make up tor a lack of skill in
other ways," said Stanford
coach Tom Davis.
"I am proud of this team and
tonight was no exception. They
keep coming back at you. I
admire and respect them for
that.
"And we're only going to get
better."
Field, who was listed as
probable due to a shoulder in
jury going into the game,
started at his forward position
and finished with 14 points in
38 minutes of action.
UCLA led 43-34 at half-time
on the strength of Wright's 10
points and four rebounds. The
Cardinal had trouble executing
its offensive at the outset and
had 12 turnovers by intermis
sion.
Whereas UCLA spread its
scoring out, each Bruin who
played getting at least eight

points, the Cardinal bunched
its scoring together in a
triumverate.
Forward Johnny Rogers had
19 points and seven rebounds,
Hans Wichary tied his career
high of 20 points which he set
the last time these two clubs
met, and lones netted 22 de
spite shooting just four of 10
from the foul-line.
The Bruins scored innum
berable points by outnumber
ing the Cardinal on fast-breaks
after beating its intense press.
Stanford applied heavy
pressure deep in UCLA terri
tory but once the Bruins got
past the initial double-team,
they used their quickness and
open-court skills to burn Stan
ford time and time again.
"When they get everybody
healthy," Davis said, "they

Bruins ahead by seven at 25:18
and the closest Stanford could
come after that was five points.
Los Angeles — Star-studded
and tenth-ranked UCLA used a
team effort to defeat a stingy
Stanford team 99-86 last night
in a Pacific-1(1 Conference bas
ketball game at Pauley Pavilion
with seven players scoring in
double figures.
Forward Darren Daye led the
Bruins with 18 points and six
assists while sophomore cen
ter Brad Wright scored 15
points on six of six shooting
from the floor and blocked five
shots in injured Stuart Gray's
absence.
The Bruin>, now 18-3 overall
and a conference-leading 10-1
in the Pac-10, broke open a tight
game with a 1 7-4 spurt in a span
of 5:14 earl\ in the second half
that put them ahead 64-46.
UCLA led just 47-42 with 17:08
remaining atter Stanford's
Andy Fischer made two foul
shots.
But then Daye completed a
three-point play on a fast-break
feed from Kenny Fields, and
Wright hit two free throws.
After Keith lones, who led
the Cardinal in scoring with 22
points, made a lay-in, Daye hit
a 15-footer and Rod Foster fol
lowed with a body control
jumper in the lane.
lones hit another lay-in be
fore an eight point Bruins
streak finished the Cardinal
off.
Wright hit a hook shot in the
lane, Daye nailed a jumper
from the choke post, Gary
Maloncon followed a misshot
and guard Michael Holton
connected from the baseline to
give UCLA the biggest lead at
18.
Stanford refused to quit and
battled back, rattling off a
seven-point run of its own to
bring the Cardinal to within
68-59 with 8:59 remaining. The
streak consisted of two lories
field goals and a Steve Brown
three-point play.
The closest Stanford came
the rest of the way was eight
points.
"We don't jump as high and
we're not as tall, so we have to

make up tor a lack of skill in
other ways," said Stanford
coach Tom Davis.
"I am proud of this team and
tonight was no exception. They
keep coming back at you. I
admire and respect them for
that.
"And we're only going to get
better."
Field, who was listed as
probable due to a shoulder in
jury going into the game,
started at his forward position
and finished with 14 points in
38 minutes of action.
UCLA led 43-34 at half-time
on the strength of Wright's 10
points and four rebounds. The
Cardinal had trouble executing
its offensive at the outset and
had 12 turnovers by intermis
sion.
Whereas UCLA spread its
scoring out, each Bruin who
played getting at least eight

points, the Cardinal bunched
its scoring together in a
triumverate.
Forward Johnny Rogers had
19 points and seven rebounds,
Hans Wichary tied his career
high of 20 points which he set
the last time these two clubs
met, and lones netted 22 de

from the foul-line.
The Bruins scored innum
berable points by outnumber

after beating its intense press.
Stanford applied heavy
pressure deep in UCLA terri
tory but once the Bruins got
past the initial double-team,
they used their quickness and
open-court skills to burn Stan
ford time and time again.
"When they get everybody
healthy," Davis said, "they
