# Card gets improved USC next
## 
### STEVE ODELL Senior Sports Writer 
Los Angeles â€” The Stanford men's basket
ball team's best game to date was a 92-74
whitewashing of USC before a raucus crowd
at Maple's Pavilion.
Many things will be different this time
around when the Cardinal faces the Trojans
in a Pacific-10 conference game tomorrow
night at the Sports Arena.
Stanford is down to nine players on its
roster, of which three are freshmen and two
are walk-ins. Dave Nussbaum, John Revelli
and most recently Ricky Lewis have all been
sidelined for the rest of the season with in
juries.
Revelli's absence has been felt most acute
ly. The 6-8 junior led the Cardinal in the first
meeting between these two ballclubs with 20
points and 8 rebounds before getting injured
midway through the second half.
Stanford, coming off a 99-86 to UCLA last
night at Pauley Pavilion is now 4-7 in the
Pac-10 and 12-9 overall.
The Trojans also have a different look, hav
ing emerged as a legitimate conference con
tender. USC has won four of its last five games
to put it in a solid third place in the Pac-10
with a 7-3 mark.
Southern California coach Stan Morrison

has instituted several changes in his lineup,
which is in concordance with the turn
around.
Freshman Gerry Wright, who some scouts
are comparing to Julius Irving at a similar
stage in his career, has replaced Clayton
Olivier at the post and wingman Ron Holmes
and has forced Cedric Bailey to the bench.
Holmes has responded favorably to the
switchingof rolesas has Bailey, whose scoring
average has climbed three points since his re
legation to sixth man status.
The Trojans, like Stanford, are small.
Wright, at six-foot-eight, is their tallest
starter, although 6-7 Wayne Carlander is a
behemoth inside and wipes the windows
with reckless abandon.
James McDonald also starts upfront.
USC's best quarterback in years, at least un
til football player Sean Salisbury arrived, is
Jacques Hill, a classy playmaking point guard
with offensive capability.
The 6-2 Hill is pumping in 13.6 points and
doling out 4.2 assists per game.
Carlander checks in as the second leading
Trojan scorer at 13.2 and he is pulling down
7.6 boards a game.
USC split a pair of conference games last
weekend, upending Oregon 65-55 and losing
to OSU on Monday night, 62-50.
