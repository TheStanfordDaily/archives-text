Besides the withdrawal of
Cardinal freshman and fifth
seed Eric Rosenfeld, with
shoulder problems, only two
Stanford players lost in the 31st
annual Intercollegiates.
The competition is all indi
vidual singles and doubles
play, with a victory counting as
one point for the player's
school. Stanford, after the
third round of singles and sec

the Bears' tennis courts are
undergoing repairs.

ing Cal, Fresno State, San Jose
State, Pacific, Cal-State Hay
ward and St. Mary's.
