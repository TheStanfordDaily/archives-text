# Crew preps for long weekend race
## 
### JAN BOYER 
When Bob Whitford became the
head coach at Stanford two-and
one-half years ago the men's team
was not considered among the
fastest national or — for that matter
— the fastest Pac-10 rowing pro
gram.
A winning tradition dating back
to the beginning of the century had
withered away in the late 19705. The
question was how long would it
take to regain the competitiveness
necessary to challenge the tradi
tional crew powerhouses such as
UC-Berkeley, Washington, UCLA,
Vale and Harvard?
Although the official beginning
of this season is more than a month
away some indication of the poten
tial of this year's squad will emerge

from the President's Cup races to
be held in Davis next Saturday. This
unusually long and grueling 3500
meter race — the normal distance is
2000 meters — will see the partici
pation of Cal, UC-Davis, Humboldt,
the Cal Rowing Club and Stanford
in the varsity, junior varsity, light
weight, freshman and novice
categories.
The outlook for Stanford is prom
ising. According to Whitford, "the
team has achieved about 75 percent
of its potential and is looking better
than during any other pre-season
I've been here."
He remains optimistic about the
upcoming season. But he said, "it's
possibly the toughest racing
schedule this crew has had in a long
time." It begins with the chance to
race with the best East coast teams
at the San Diego Crew Classic on

April 1 and moves through a tough
series of dual meets and other races
culminating in the Pac-10 champi
onships in the middle of May.
In regard to this race, Stanford's
aspiration is to put its boats within
striking distance of Cal, which con
sidering the Bear's 1982 No. 1 na
tional ranking would already con
stitute a remarkable achievement.
Regardless of the results at Davis,
the veiled enthusiasm with which
Whitford talks about next weekend
and the season as a whole is reflec
tive of just how close Stanford is to
the achievement of this goal.
Considering the fact that,
perhaps more than in any other
spo r t, the gap between the
achievement of this "striking dis
tance" and victory is so narrow, this
season may turn out to be one of
outstanding results.
