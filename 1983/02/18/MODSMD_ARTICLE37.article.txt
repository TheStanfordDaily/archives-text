# 'Big Meet' pits nation's top two swim teams
## 
### SHAILENDRA BHUMRALKAR 
The Stanford men's swim
team will attempt to complete
its first perfect season since
1956 this weekend as it travels
to Berkeley to face Cal in the
b7th swim meet between the
two schools.
"To win at Cal in front of
their fans would be very excit
ing,'' head coach Skip Kenney
said. The Cal-Stanford tradi
tion is important, he said, but
winning the NCAA Champion
ship remains the team's central
goal.
Kenney does want to gain a
"psychological advantage''
over Cal, since the Bears will be
strong contenders at the
NCAA's.
The diving events will once
again be important. "I told the
divers that they only have to
carry us for three more meets
— Cal, the Pac-lOs and the
NCAAs," Kenney |oked. Diving
coach Rick Schavone expects
his much stronger squad to
sweep both boards.
Cal is led by two foreigners
— Bengt Baron, the Swedish
Olympic champ in the
backstroke, and Adrian
Moorhouse, an English Olym
pic competitor in the
breaststroke. Kenney said the
Cardinal has to win the dis
tance freestyle events to insure
victory.
The 400 medley relay race
opening the meet will be cru
cial. If Stanford can win this
race, it should pull out to an
insurmountable lead com

bined with the expected diving
results. It, however, the Bears
win the race, Kenney
forecasted "a hell of a meet."
The team members them
selves are all very confident.
"It's our biggest dual meet, but
we're looking forward to the
Pac-10s and the NCAAs,"
sophomore )ohn Engs said.

Junior Dave Sims said this
year's Big Came has enhanced
the Stanford-Cal rivalry.
"They're fired up, so we have
to be, too."
Sophomore Jon Denney said
the Card wants a "mental
edge" over the Bears, espe
cially heading into the NCAA
Championships.

The swimmers agreed that
Stanford's team chemistry and
self-confidence are determin
ing factors of the team's suc
cess. Sims said, "Other
coaches and teams don't think
we can win, but we believe in
ourselves." lunior Sam Wor
den stressed the sincerity of
the team's impromptu cheers

at meets.
Great athletes produce
under pressure, Kenney said,
adding that his swimmers are
great athletes. Since he has
been directing them so that
they build momentum heading
into the NCAA Champion
ships, they have not peaked
yet.
