# University counsel promoted
## VP post created 
### HEATHER MILLAR 
The University administration yes
terday moved to fill out the ranks of
vice-presidents which have been
partially vacant for over a year,
promoting University Counsel |ohn
Schwartz to a newly created vice
presidential post and appointing
Robert Freelen acting vice-president
for public affairs.
Schwartz's appointment creates a
new office while Freelen is serving
temporarily as officials conduct a
search for a new vice-president to
take the vacancy created by Robert
Rosenzweig. Rosenzweig left the
University to assume the presidency
of the American Association of Uni
versities last month.
Schwartz's promotion to the vice
presidential level swells the number
of vice-presidents from five to six.
The title is largely the recognition of a
reality, according to University Pres
ident Donald Kennedy who said,
"For the past several years . . . |ohn
has functioned as a vice-president in
all but name."
"I don't think that this move is
going to have any impact on the op
eration of the University," said
Gerald Lieberman, vice-provost and
dean of graduate studies and re
search. "It's the same John Schwartz.
His duties will not change."
Lieberman added that Schwartz's
appointment would not greatly affect
the relations between the vice
presidents.
Schwartz, who was out of town,
could not be reached for comment.
Staff Counsel Iris Brest said, "I

think it's perfectly wonderful. He's
very smart and besides being smart,
hehasallthe proper instincts. He has
a sense of the style of the place,
about what is proper to a University
as opposed to other institutions."
Brest added that Schwartz sup
ported his staff and that the Office of
the University Counsel was a very en
joyable place to work.
Schwartz has served as University
Counsel since 1977, advising the
University on legal affairs. No
changes are contemplated in the of
fice as a result of Schwartz's promo
tion. In recent years, other univer
sities have elevated their chief legal
officers to the level of vice-president.
Stanford's move brings the Universi
ty's bureaucratic structure in line
with other comparable institutions.
Schwartz's credentials fit well with
what many see as a science-oriented
institution such as Stanford. A
graduate of Cornell (8.5., physics
1955), Harvard (Bachelor of Law,
1958) and Rochester (Ph.D., physics,
1965), Schwartz came to Stanford as
assistant professor of physics in 1968.
He served as special assistant to the
president from 1970 to 1973, when he
was named counsel for medical af
fairs. He took the post of associate
vice-president for medical affairs in
1977.
Freelen, who has extensive ties
with Stanford, is almost an heir appa
rent for the job of vice-president for
public affairs. He has worked in the
public affairs office for the last 10
years and has served as associate
