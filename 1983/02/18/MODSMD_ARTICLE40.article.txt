# Stanford spikers blasted by USC

The Stanford men's vol
leyball team lost to USC
Wednesday night at
Maples, 9-15, 9-15, 8-15.
I he three game match
had some outstanding ral
lies and a few spectacular
plays. But as assistant coach
Don Shaw said, "We were
just outplayed by USC."
There was some trouble
on the part of the Card in
serve reception, giving the
Trojans the opportunity to
set up its offense.
It was not a case of the
Card s inadequacy. It was
the efficiency of USC's of
fense which gave it ex
cellent ball control and
domination.
The Cardinal started each

game slowly, showing
strength and then slowing
again. The match was a rol
lercoaster â€” perhaps with
more consistent play the
Card would have fared bet
ter.
The Cardinal plays Hawaii
on Monday at 7:30 p.m. in
Maples. It should be a good
test of what the team
learned from the USC game
as USC just returned from a
meet against Hawaii where
it split in two, five-game
matches.
"This kind of program
needs support. An en
thusiastic crowd would help
immensely with tough
matches like USC and
Hawaii," Shaw commented.
