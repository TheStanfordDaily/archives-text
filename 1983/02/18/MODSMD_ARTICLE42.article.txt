Both the men's and the women's gym
nastics teams are on the road this weekend
to take on a variety of opponents.
The men will face UC-Davis, while the
women are traveling north for a triangular
meet in Corvallis, Ore., with Oregon State
and Arizona.
For coach Sadao Hamada's men, this will
not be a tough meet to win, but it will be a
crucial meet in which to score well.
Davis usually scores somewhere in the
vicinity of 250, while Stanford is working
toward a score of 270 or better. It is impor
tant for Stanford to stay above this mark in
the three remaining away meets, as the bid
for a trip to the NCAA championships
hinges on consistently high scores.
The women are working with a healthier
team than usual this weekend. The injured
Karen Hall is back in competitive form.
Coach Homer Sardina is predicting a
high scoring meet, since all the teams are
very close in ability. "We're really ready,"
Sardina said. "If we can keep up the inten
sity and enthusiasm throughout, it's going
to be a top meet."
The Cardinal will be facing Oregon
State's Jayne Weinstein, an international
competitor and member of the national
team, as well as Arizona's Karen Steven

son, currently ranked in the country's top
20.

The Stanford track team, coached by
Brooks )ohnson, begins the 1983 season
on the road tomorrow against UC-lrvine.
The men's squad hopes to improve on
last year's 6-5 dual meet record and dismal
finish in the Pac-10 Championships. Re
turning to the team are Shaun Pickering,
who finished second last year in the Pac-10
in the hammer throw, Billy Graham, an
NCAA finals qualifier in the 10,000 meters
and hurdler and team captain Kevin )ones.
Two newcomers, sprinters Anre Wil
liams and Terry Parks, will give the team
extra depth in the speed events.
Ceci Hopp and Pattisue Plumer, who
finished one-two in the NCAA 3000 meters
last year, lead the women's team that
finished with an 8-6 record and placed fifth
in the NCAA Championships.
Other top performers are long jumper
Pam Donald, Karen Lysaght in the high
jump, multi eventer Denise Gaztambide
and freshman shot putter and discus
thrower Pam Dukes. This year's squad also
features many returnees from last year's
successful team that will give Stanford an

extra edge in the upcoming meets.
"Overall the team is improved over last
year's," lohnson said. "What we need
from the men is a super performance to set
an example for the rest of the team.
"Having one of these performances
helps mediocre athletes to perform better
and that is a ditference between the men
and the women, for the women have
people who turn in these performances
more often."
