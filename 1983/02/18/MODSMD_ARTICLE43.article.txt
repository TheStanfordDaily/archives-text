"Aren't you afraidf
Men must die. But leg
end has It that a vampire,
Nosferatu, 'the Undead,'
lives on men's blood I
You want to see a sym
phony of horrorf You
may expect more. Be
careful. Nosferatu is not
just fun, not something
to be taken lightly. Once
more: beware."
— from an early
advertisement for
Nosferatu
Nosferatu (1922) ★
Haus Mitteleuropa
One of the great horror films
— perhaps just a notch below
Carl Dreyer's Vampyr. F.W
Murnau's expressionistic style
is peculiarly suited to Bram
Stoker's Dracula, of which
Nosferatu is the first, and best,
adaptation. (Only one other,
Werner Herzog's Nosferatu the
Vampyre, a tribute to
Murnau's, can even be dis
cussed seriously alongside it.)
The title character ("Nosferatu"
means "the undead"), played
by Max Schreck, looks like a
tall, thin death's head with a
hooked nose and long, pointed
fingers; when he rises from his
coffin, we see his fingernails
first, lit by Fritz Arno Wagner as
though they glowed from the
inside. One doesn't forget the
image of the ship drifting to
shore, its whole crew dead, or
the progression of coffins down
an otherwise deserted street, or
the rats surging from Dracula's
shipboard grave. Screenplay by
Henrik Galeen; decors and cos
tumes by Albin Grau; with
Alexander Granach, Gustav von
Wangenheim, Grete Schroder,
G.H. Schnell and Ruth
Lansdorf.
Plays Thursday evening.
Fast Times at Rldgemont
High
Memorial Auditorium
Amy Heckerling, the debut
director, has a knack for black
out comedy, and the lightly
parodistic tone she's found is
just right for Cameron Crowe's
script, based on his own book
about kids attending a sub
urban California high school.
This movie may be slight, but
it's pleasurable and shrewdly
observed, and it features a sur
prising number of lovely small
performances (from Jennifer
Jason Leigh, Phoebe Cates,
Richard Romanus, Brian
Backer, Judge Reinhold and es
pecially Sean Penn as the stoner
Spicoli).
Plays Sunday evening.
Smiles of a Summer NigtTT
(1955) ★
Kresge Auditorium
Ingmar Bergman has never
made a better picture than this
complex sexual farce, which
suggests a Viennese operetta as
Shakespeare might have writ
ten it. The players are a middle
aged lawyer (Gunnar
Bjornstrand); his wife (Ulla
Jacobsson), still a virgin; his
one-time mistress, an actress
(Eva Dahlbeck); her egocentric
lover (Karl Julie); his proud,
melancholy wife (Margit Carl
quist); the carnal, ebullient
maid (Harriet Andersson) —
and, in the background, the ac

tress' aging mother (Naima
Wifstrand). This movie inspired
the marvelous Stephen Son
dheim musical A Little Night
Music, but there's nothing like
the original.
Plays Monday evening.
The Parallax View (1974) ★
Kresge Auditorium
This Watergate-era con
spiracy thriller isn't in the B/ow-
Out — The Conversation class,
and in fact for the first half hour
or 45 minutes the refusal of the
director, Alan Pakula, to play up
the murder scenes may seem
perverse and frustrating. (The
victims are all witnesses to a po
litical assassination.) But there's
a brilliantly edited sequence in
which the hero, a muckraking
journalist (Warren Beatty), is
subjected to a testing film for
potential killers, and after that
Pakula's understatement and
the wide, sterile, constructivist
look of the film (which was shot
by Gordon Willis and designed
by George Jenkins) takes hold.
David Giler and LorenzoSem
ple, Jr. adapted Loren Singer's
novel about an organization
that trains psychotics to be
come assassins — a great, chill
ing plot idea. The cast features
Paula Prentiss, William Daniels,
Hume Cronyn and Walter
McGinn, but Beatty gives the
only good performance.
Plays tomorrow evening.
Day of Wrath (1943) ★
Lagunita & Larkin Dining
Rooms
Carl Dreyer's film, set in the
17th century, concerns the
power of belief to transform:
first an old woman and then a
beautiful young pastor's wife,
thought to possess demonic
gifts, turn into the accursed fig
ures others believe them to be.
The true wizard is Dreyer: Day
of Wrath is one of the great
movie experiences. It's difficult
to imagine how the script (by
Dreyer, Mogens Skot-Hansen
and Paul Knudsen), the photog
raphy (by Karl Andersson), or
the performances of Lisbeth
Movin as the wife, Thorkild
Roose as the pastor, and Anna
Svierkier as the victimized old
woman could be any better
than they are. No one has ever
come closer than Dreyer to get
ting the spirit of Hawthorne on
the screen.
Plays Monday (Lagunita) and
La r k in).
The Ox-Bow Incident (1943)
Festival, Palo Alto *
The look of this adaptation of
the first-rate Walter Von
Tilburg Clark novel is solidly
Hollywood backlot, but thanks
to the director, William Well
man, and an unusually good
cast, this is a memorable film.
Set in Nevada in 1885, the story
concerns the unjustified
lynching of three men and its
implications for the lynch mob.
Wellman's direction of the
group scenes is exceptional; he
builds the dramatic tension
skillfully, too, and he shows real

feeling for character detail.
Lamar Trotti's screenplay sim
plifies the intention and tone of
certain scenes, but few readers
of the novel would complain
about the casting of Henry Fon
da and Harry Morgan as the
strangers who stumble into all
the hysteria, Dana Andrews and
Francis Ford as two of the vic
tims, Jane Darwell (with her ter
rific lewd laugh) as the blood
thirsty old battleaxe, or Frank
Conroy and William Eythe as
rich, cold Major Tetley and his
son. With Anthony Quinn as
the third victim, Harry Daven
port, Leigh Whipper, Mary Beth
Hughes, Matt Briggs and
Margaret Hamilton.
Plays through Wednesday
with The Grapes of Wrath.
The Hidden Fortress (1958)
New Varsity, Palo Alto *
Akira Kurosawa made this
amazing adventure movie
about a pair of gravediggers
who dream of finding their
princess, defeated in war and
now disguised as a mute, so
they can turn her in for 10 gold
pieces. It's a kind of Arabian
Nights western, with a comic
variation on Greed built in, and
battle scenes so spectacular that
you feel that if Cinemascope
hadn't recently been in
troduced, Kurosawa would
have had to invent it himself.
Someone ought to write an arti
cle about the opening se
quences in Kurosawa films —
this one ranks with the begin
ning of Throne of Blood (very
high). Toshiro Mifune, Misa
Uehara, Takashi Shimura and
Susumu Fujita star.
Plays Monday with Sanjuro.
The Grapes of Wrath (1940)
Festival, Palo Alto *
Like the John Steinbeck nov
el, John Ford's famous screen
version isn't as good as its repu
tation, but it's made with such
integrity and singleness of vi
sion, and it's so emotionally
charged, that you remember it
more vividly than a lot of better
pictures. The biblical-hillbilly
dialogue is impossible, and
most of the acting is arresting in
all the wrong ways, but Henry
Fonda is a terrific Tom Joad.
Gregg Toland photographed,
the year before he did Citizen
Kane; it's easy to see why he
was the hottest young camer
aman in Hollywood. (His death
in 1948, at the age of 44, was a
real tragedy.) With Jane
Darwell, John Carradine,
Charley Grapewin, Dorris
Bowdon, Russell Simpson, Zef
fie Tilbury, O.Z. Whitehead,
John Qualen and Eddie
Quillan.
Plays through Wednesday
with The Ox-Bow Incident.
Fame (1980)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
A loud, hyperactive musical
that traces the (minimal)
progress of a small group of
not-especially-talented teen
agers as they plough an in
terminable route through the
High School of the Performing

Arts in New York. It's sentimen
tal and manipulative in the
Chorus Line style, and wildly
implausible as well. Someof the
scenes are howlers — like one
in which a supposedly street
smart girl (Irene Cara) allows
herself to be picked up by a
porno director who says he's
going to make her a star. Alan
Parker directed, and the
frenetic dance numbers were
choreographed by Louis Falco;
Christopher Gore wrote the
screenplay. With Laura Dean,
Paul McClure, Barry Miller,
Maureen Teefy, Anthony Roy,
Jim Moody, Antonia Franceschi
and Anne Meara.
Plays today with Zoot Suit.
Heartaches
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Bonnie (Annie Potts) and
Stanley (Robert Carradine) are
married and have a pet duck
named Nelson; they are also
expecting a baby, but it isn't
Stanley's, and Bonnie, dis
satisfied with their life together,
decides to leave him. For some
reason (not provided in the
movie) she and loud, sluttish
Rita (Margot Kidder), who
wears spangled purple shades,
a Davy Crockett jacket, leather
boots and a Sandra Dee hair
style, become bosom buddies.
This Canadian feature, written
by Terence Heffernan and
directed by Donald Shebib, is
damned near unbearable — it
has no inner logic, no rhythm,
and both women make you
want to throw things. Carradine
has a few moments of genuine
hurt and genuine toughness;
the rest is unsalvageable.
Plays Tuesday and Wednes
day with Street Music.
Sanjuro (1962)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Akira Kurosawa's sequel to
his Yojimbo of the previous
year; once again, Toshiro
Mifune plays the witty, cynical

samurai mercenary. This isn't
one of Kurosawa's best adven
tures, but it's consistently enter
taining, and Mifune's super
human strength is hilarious. No
movie hero has ever walked
like him — he throws his chest
out so far that hs seems to be
hiding a balloon under his
kimono, and you wonder how
he manages to stride rather
than float across the screen.
Plays Monday with The Hid
den Fortress.
A Little Romance (1979)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
The pun in the title of this
movie, which concerns a love
affair between 13-year-olds
(Diane Lane and Thelonius
Bernard, who give the only de
cent performances), should
provide a fair indication of the
level of the humor. Slickly
directed (by George Roy Hill)
and shot (by Pierre William
Glenn, in France and Italy), it's
sugary and fatuous. Allan Burns
adapted Patrick Couvin's nov
el; the shameless adults in the
cast include Sally Kellerman,
Arthur Hill and Laurence
Olivier, giving what may be the

worst performance of his ca
reer. (I haven't seen The lazz
Singer or Inchon.)
Plays tomorrow with
Gregory's Cirl.
