# Lighting cuts not seen as safety threat
## 
### GLENN BAKER 
ihe University has allocated
$50,000 to the outdoor lighting pro
gram that was begun four years ago
to improve campus safety, the board
ot trustees announced at the meet
ing last week.
Although tar less than the previous
year's allotment, this year's sum was
not less than expected," according
to Phil Williams, University director
of planning.
"This year we recommended fund
ing of $75,000, but after considera
tion, agreed on $50,000. All Univer
sity programs are being cut, and we
will not have any problems with
this," Williams saici.
Campus planner Judy Chan said
she did not believe that reduced
spending on campus lighting would
reduce campus safety. "We do not
see the decrease in the lighting
budget as a threat to campus safety,
for more people are now aware of
the problem and act accordingly.

There is not a direct correlation be
tween rape attempts and the suffi
ciency of lighting."
Chan said the decrease in rapes
and rape attempts this year is due to
increased safety concerns and rape
awareness, as well as to improved
lighting.
The current lighting project began
four years ago, with a budget of $1
million to be distributed equally over
10 years. Two years ago. however,
the program was accelerated, and
approximately $175,000 was allotted
for lighting. The money comes from
the budget of the campus planning
office, which is also responsible for
drainage and other safety concerns
on campus.
Williams said in the previous two
year's increases were necessary "for
there was great campus concern over
recent rapes and inadequate safety
due to poor lighting. Now, however,
we believe we have caught up and
must look at other areas that need

improvement."
Chan said the cut is "a reduction in
what we had been doing," but that in
relation to cuts in other areas of
campus improvement, "the lighting
did very well."
As an example of budget cuts,
Chan said there will be no enhance
ment of existing structures, such as
the recent improvement and rede
sign of Roble Courtyard.
The 1983 plans call for six areas to
be improved. These are:
• The Quad Courtyard.
• The Physics tank area.
• Ihe path between the Lake
Lagunita Program Center and the
Boathouse.
• Between the Medical School and
the Anatomy building (a new path
way is also planned.)
• On Campus Drive by the Center
for Integrated Systems building.
• On Panama Street around the

field to Campus Drive West.
Another area that might be con
sidered is in front ot Roble Gym.
However," Chan said, "not all
areas are assured of improvement.
We make a priority list and work
downwards on that list. If the money
is sufficient we can complete all six. It
not, we might be able to improve
only four or five."
According to Williams, students
are deeply involved in the decisions
concerning safety and lighting pro
cedures. He noted that ")udy Chan
has met with students for three years
through the Personal Safety Council.
Fhey give recommendations and ob
servations, as does the police de
partment, all of which are taken into
consideration."
The lights are placed 90 feet apart,
and are sufficiently powerful to light
the space in-between this distance.
The lighting project, according to
Williams, is about 60 percent com
pleted.
