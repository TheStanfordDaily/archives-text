# Grant for homosexuals stirs controversy
## 
### JAN BENJAMIN 
Discussion is building around a
proposed scholarship for gay stu
dents. The originally proposed gift
was rejected by University President
Donald Kennedy, but the University
is now considering a second propo
sal which contains a "more extended
argument," according to Robert
Hamrdla, assistant to the President.
The University will hold an open
meeting "probably next Wednes
day" to discuss the topic. Interested
students and staff will be able to pose
questions, Hamrdla said. Hamrdla
suggested one look at the issue this
way: "If the University were sent a
potential gift with the restriction that
a student receiving the gift would
have to declare that he or she were
not gay, would the University want to
accept that gift?" Hamrdla said he
thinks not.

The University refuses to release
the name of the donor or the condi
tions of the gift, Hamrdla said. Uni
versity policy prohibits release of in
formation relating to potential
donors, on the basis of privacy.
But according to graduate student
David Abernethy, a member of
the steering committee for the Gay
and Lesbian Alliance at Stanford
(GLAS), the proposed gift amount was
$500 and would be awarded to a gay
male student.
The University sent GLAS a copy of
the letter which it received from the
potential donor about a month ago.
In it, the potential donor, once as
sociated with the University/ accord
ing to Abernethy, offered $500 to be
awarded to a gay male graduate stu
dent.
Members of GLAS said they
questioned what specifics of
this proposed scholarship
made it different from other
scholarships that require de
clarations of faith.
The GLAS steering commit
tee sent a letter to Kennedy
yesterday stating that the
"University should apply the
same standards to the accep
tance of scholarship funds for
gay and lesbian students which
would apply to scholarship
fund for other groups.

" I hey (gays and lesbians) are
no more difficult to identify
than members of any other
minority group, who generally
are also required to identify
themselves to the University
prior to being recognized as a
memberof the group," accord
ing to the letter.
Kennedy said he was "very
worried about any proposal
that requires a declaration on
the part of the individual as a
requirement â€” and I don'tcare
what that declaration of faith

is" during the KZSU Campus
Conference Tuesday.
After Kennedy received the
original proposal, he wrote the
potential donor, refusing to
accept the proposal as it stood,
on the basis that it required a
declaration of faith which,
Hamrdla said "could not pos
sibly be verified without an im
permissable invasion of pri
vacy" on the part of the Uni
versity. Hamrdla said the
donor wrote back to Kennedy
with "a more extended argu

ment." At this point, according
to Hamrdla, Kennedy asked
some staff members to
examine this extended argu
ment and make some recom
mendations.
"To my knowledge,"
Hamrdla said, "the University
does not administer schol
arships which require declara
tions of faith such as religious
declarations."
"My guess is that the Univer
sity would turn that down," he
said.
