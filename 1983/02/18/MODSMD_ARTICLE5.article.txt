# Grant for homosexuals stirs controversy
## 
### JAN BENJAMIN 
Discussion is building around a
proposed scholarship for gay stu
dents. The originally proposed gift
was rejected by University President
Donald Kennedy, but the University
is now considering a second propo
sal which contains a "more extended
argument," according to Robert
Hamrdla, assistant to the President.
The University will hold an open
meeting "probably next Wednes
day" to discuss the topic. Interested
students and staff will be able to pose
questions, Hamrdla said. Hamrdla
suggested one look at the issue this
way: "If the University were sent a
potential gift with the restriction that
a student receiving the gift would
have to declare that he or she were
not gay, would the University want to
accept that gift?" Hamrdla said he
thinks not.

The University refuses to release
the name of the donor or the condi
tions of the gift, Hamrdla said. Uni
versity policy prohibits release of in
formation relating to potential
donors, on the basis of privacy.
But according to graduate student
David Abernethy, a member of
the steering committee for the Gay
and Lesbian Alliance at Stanford
(GLAS), the proposed gift amount was
$500 and would be awarded to a gay
male student.
The University sent GLAS a copy of
the letter which it received from the
potential donor about a month ago.
In it, the potential donor, once as
sociated with the University/ accord
ing to Abernethy, offered $500 to be
awarded to a gay male graduate stu
dent.
