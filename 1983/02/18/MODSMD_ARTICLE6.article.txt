"Theme houses are an expression of the views, values
and needs of certain minorities — minorities which are
sorely and violently neglected here," said Asst. Dean of
Students Ron Hudson, resident fellow of Ujamaa and
Naranja houses, in a heated debate last night on the issue
of whether theme houses should be discontinued here.
Hudson, along with debating student Leslie Talbot,
aggressively, supported theme houses amid cheers and
( laps from the predominantly black crowd of more than
100 in Eucalypto lounge. Debate student Chuiewei
Yuen, along with English Prof. Wilfred Stone, urged the
discontinuation of theme houses.
Currently, the University has three theme houses —
Ujamaa, the black theme house, Okada, the Asian
theme house, and Zapata, the Chicano theme house.
"There is an Anglo-centric view of education here,"
Hudson said. He cited as an example the Western Cul
ture program, which does not deal with Third World
issues.
"You think it's real funny. You've eliminated all else
.icademically. Now you want to do away with three
houses out of 60 where we have a chance to do some
thing different," Hudson said.

Yuen, advocating the abolishment of theme houses,
cited three points in her argument: theme houses lessen
cross-cultural exchange, promote tension and increase
cultural differences.
Talbot, by contrast, said theme houses should be con
tinued for three reasons: they promote active cross
cultural exchange, prevent assimilation by promoting
awareness and provide a means to express and experi
ence culture.
"They are more beneficial than harmful. They reduce
alienation by enabling minorities to share a common
experience and similar lifestyles," she said.
Stone submitted a letter to the Daily last fall advocat
ing the abolition of not only theme houses but all
socially based living arrangements including ffater
nities.
He said, "Whoever's good enough to get into Stan
ford is good enough to share all the facilities. I object to
the fraternities' right to ding which has kept out all
minorities, including wimps, nerds and fat guys."
Stone called the frat system "the principle of thecoun
try club,"and said it should be discontinued. "The Uni
versity should be a little universe where we all rub
shoulders," he said.




DEBATE: More than 100 students gathered in the
Eucalypto Lounge last night to hear Assistant Dean of

Stephen |ohnson/Dailv
Students Ronald Hudson (left) and Wilfred Stone
(right) debate the issue of theme houses.
"I'm advocating the Harvard melting pot system
where they've done away with all discrimination on so
cial, racial or religious grounds," he said. "If you believe
in theme houses, you believe in the principle of frater
nities."
Sensing hostility in Hudson's insistence that he was
only set ing things from his own perspective, Stone said,
"Ron's implication that I'm a racist is something I'd stack
my record against."
Stone said a spread of minorities through University

dorms is an alternative to theme houses. "The dorms are
dominated by white values. Couldn't that change if
more blacks were there?" he asked.
An audience member responded that the small per
centage of students in theme houses would make an
insignificant difference if spread throughout the dorms.
"There would still be only three to five minorities in each
dorm. Our voices still wouldn't be heard," she said.
Hudson said, "There can't be cultural diversity unless
there is culture and there can't be culture unless there
are theme houses."
Stone countered, "It's a two-way street. The habit of
feeling safe and withdrawing shouldn't be encouraged.
If you carry the ideal to the extreme, we'll only have
black and white universities."
