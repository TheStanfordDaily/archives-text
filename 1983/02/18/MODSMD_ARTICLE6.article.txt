"Theme houses are an expression of the views, values
and needs of certain minorities — minorities which are
sorely and violently neglected here," said Asst. Dean of
Students Ron Hudson, resident fellow of Ujamaa and
Naranja houses, in a heated debate last night on the issue
of whether theme houses should be discontinued here.
Hudson, along with debating student Leslie Talbot,
aggressively, supported theme houses amid cheers and
( laps from the predominantly black crowd of more than
100 in Eucalypto lounge. Debate student Chuiewei
Yuen, along with English Prof. Wilfred Stone, urged the
discontinuation of theme houses.
Currently, the University has three theme houses —
Ujamaa, the black theme house, Okada, the Asian
theme house, and Zapata, the Chicano theme house.
"There is an Anglo-centric view of education here,"
Hudson said. He cited as an example the Western Cul
ture program, which does not deal with Third World
issues.
"You think it's real funny. You've eliminated all else
.icademically. Now you want to do away with three
houses out of 60 where we have a chance to do some
thing different," Hudson said.

Yuen, advocating the abolishment of theme houses,
cited three points in her argument: theme houses lessen
cross-cultural exchange, promote tension and increase
cultural differences.
Talbot, by contrast, said theme houses should be con
tinued for three reasons: they promote active cross
cultural exchange, prevent assimilation by promoting
awareness and provide a means to express and experi
ence culture.
"They are more beneficial than harmful. They reduce
alienation by enabling minorities to share a common
experience and similar lifestyles," she said.
Stone submitted a letter to the Daily last fall advocat
ing the abolition of not only theme houses but all
socially based living arrangements including ffater
nities.
He said, "Whoever's good enough to get into Stan
ford is good enough to share all the facilities. I object to
the fraternities' right to ding which has kept out all
minorities, including wimps, nerds and fat guys."
Stone called the frat system "the principle of thecoun
try club,"and said it should be discontinued. "The Uni
versity should be a little universe where we all rub
shoulders," he said.
