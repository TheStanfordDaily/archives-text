Khadafy threatens U.S.
Tripoli, Libya— Libyan leader Col. Moammar
Khadafy vowed yesterday to turn the Gulf of Sidra
into a "red gulf of blood" if the U.S. aircraft carrier
Nimitz and its battle group dare to re-enter the dis
puted bay in the southern Mediterranean.
President Reagan has said there are no plans to in
volve U.S. forces in the region if Libya clashes with
Sudan, its U.S.-backed neighbor, but that American
troops have a right to defend themselves if fired
upon.
Two U.S. jet fighters conducting war games from
the Nimitz shot down a pair of Libyan planes after
being fired on over the gulf in August 1981, and the
Nimitz and its battle group just completed another set

of maneuvers there.
"Entering Sidra means an invasion of Libya. The Lib
yan people want to live as free people and won't ac
cept foreign occupation. The Gulf of Sidra will turn
into a red gulf of blood if anyone tries to sail through it
by force," Khadafy told his Parliament in the Libyan
capital of Tripoli.
In an address carried by Libya's official JANA news
agency, he warned that the U.S. Navy, operating
north of the Gulf of Sidra, "forms a challenge to the
Libyan nation. The Libyan people won't stand and
watch idly if pushed too far."
"We will not permit America or any foreign state to
enter the Gulf of Sidra or any other part of Libyan wa
ters, and this includes the Soviet Union, to which
were are linked by a relationship of friendship,'

Khadafy said.
Reagan withholds EPA papers
Washington—President Reagan yesterday
backed away from his statement that he would pro
vide disputed Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA) documents to Congress because of allegations
of "wrongdoing" at the agency, and instead re
asserted his claim to executive privilege over the rec
ords.
The turnabout came after Reagan said at his na
tionally televised news conference Wednesday night
that, "I can no longer insist on executive privilege if
there's a suspicion in the minds of the people that
maybe it is being used to cover some wrongdoing."
White House spokesman Larry Speakes insisted yes

terday that Reagan has not abandoned the executive
privilege claim. He corrected Reagan's suggestion
that he would offer directly to Congress documents
involving possible wrongdoing by EPA officials.
Instead, Speakes said, the records will be submitted
first to the Justice Department, which will then decide
"whether it is necessary" to make them available for
congressional review.
Reagan met for 15 minutes in the Oval Office yes
terday with embattled EPA Administrator Anne
Gorsuch, but White House officials ordered that no
details of the meeting be revealed.
At the same time, Rita Lavelle, ousted chief of the
hazardous waste cleanup program, did not honor a
subpoena to appear before a House subcommittee
investigating charges of conflicts of interest and polit
ical favoritism in the operation of her program, one of
six Capitol Hill investigations of EPA.
Lavelle may have vioated agency regulations by al
lowing executives of chemical companies to pay for
frequent meals at some of Washington's most ex
pensive restaurants, according to an EPA official.
Solidarity leaders sentenced
Warsaw, Poland — A Polish military court convicted
and handed down prison sentences yesterday rang
ing up to four-and-one-half years for organizers of
Radio Solidarity, the clandestine static 1 that pierced
the state monopoly of the air waves during martial law
last year to offer news from the political under
ground.
The guilty verdicts against Zbigniew Romaszewski,
43, a physicist who masterminded the operation; his
wife, Irena Zofia; and seven others who assisted in the
broadcasts ended what has been the most publicized
prosecution of those who actively resisted martial
law.
Romaszewski, a former national commission mem
ber of the now banned independent trade union Soli
darity has been active in Poland'sdemocraticopposi
tion since the mid-19705. He was sentenced to four
and-one-half years in prison for violating martial law
by continuing union activities and bv spreading what

the court declared was false information aimed at stir
ring social unrest and weakening Poland's defenses.
Hart declares candidacy
Denver — Sen. Gary Hart announced his longshot
campaign for the Democratic presidential nomi
nation yesterday, declaring that while the country
faces tough economic choices, "we can be ten
derhearted if we are also tough-minded."
Hart, who engineered George McGovern's cam
paign for the Democratic presidential nomination in
1972, is at age 45 the youngest of the likely 1984 con
tenders.
In a speech from the steps of the Colorado state
house, Hart said, "We now face a stark choice be
tween national renewal or national decline."
"The next president must shape domestic policies
that actually achieve progress — instead of per
petuating programs merely because there is a pres
sure group for them," he said.
With his wife, Lee, at his side, Hart spoke to about
500 cheering supporters. Facing the Rocky Mountains
visible in the distance, the senator said he believes it is
time for a Western candidate to have a serious shot at
the White House.
Hart is the second Democrat after Sen. Alan
Cranston of California to formally announce his presi
dential campaign.
Former Vice President Walter iMondale is to an

nounce his candidacy Monday, and other undeclared
contenders include Sens. John Glenn of Ohio, Ernest
Hollings of South Carolina and Dale Bumpers of Ar
kansas.
Mexico gets agricultural loan
Mexico City — U.S. Agriculture Secretary )ohn
Block on yesterday signed a $1.7 billion agricultural
loan package intended to help recession-plagued
Mexico buy American grains and other foodstuffs on
easy terms.
The agreement was negotiated in August, but was
increased by $700 million last week.
It includes loan money to buy more than 6 million
tons worth of grains, oil seeds and dairy products, and
also provides for Mexican purchases of an un
specified amount of powdered milk.
A joint statement said the package "contributes to
the availability of basic food commodities for the
Mexican people during 1983."
Commerce Secretary Hector Hernandez Cervantes
represented Mexico at the ceremony at which Block
signed the agreement.
Mexico plunged into its worst recession of the cen
tury when tne worldwide oil glut dried up revenues
the government had counted on for an ambitious de
velopment project. The new president, Miguel de la
Madrid, has started an austerity program intended to
get the nation back on its feet.

Guinea re-enters world scene
Conakry, Guinea — After years of isolation, West
Africa's firebrand orator of pan-Africanist socialist
revolution, Ahmed Sekou Toure, has loosened his
grip on Guinea and gradually allowed the country's
return to the world community.
But the preceding two decades of Stalinist-like ter
ror remain a dark memory among numerous Gui
neans.
Toure's socialist People's Revolutionary Republic
of Guinea, a West African nation about the size of Or
egon with rich mineral and agricultural potential, is
today a country of somber paradoxes of poverty and
neglect.
Stocks up amid mixed trading
The stock market settled for a mixed showing yes
terday after a late rally failed to attract much support.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, off about
seven points at midsession and up about three late in
the afternoon, finished with a 1.48 gain at 1088.91.
Most other market indicators showed small declines.
Today's weather
Slight chance of light rain today at times, otherwise
dry with continued mild temperatures. Fog possible
in early morning, but clearing by midmorning. Highs
in mid-70s and lows in the upper 30s.

Reagan withholds EPA papers
Washington—President Reagan yesterday
backed away from his statement that he would pro
vide disputed Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA) documents to Congress because of allegations
of "wrongdoing" at the agency, and instead re
asserted his claim to executive privilege over the rec
ords.
The turnabout came after Reagan said at his na
tionally televised news conference Wednesday night
that, "I can no longer insist on executive privilege if
there's a suspicion in the minds of the people that
maybe it is being used to cover some wrongdoing."
White House spokesman Larry Speakes insisted yes

terday that Reagan has not abandoned the executive
privilege claim. He corrected Reagan's suggestion
that he would offer directly to Congress documents
involving possible wrongdoing by EPA officials.
Instead, Speakes said, the records will be submitted
first to the Justice Department, which will then decide
"whether it is necessary" to make them available for
congressional review.
Reagan met for 15 minutes in the Oval Office yes
terday with embattled EPA Administrator Anne
Gorsuch, but White House officials ordered that no
details of the meeting be revealed.
At the same time, Rita Lavelle, ousted chief of the
hazardous waste cleanup program, did not honor a
subpoena to appear before a House subcommittee
investigating charges of conflicts of interest and polit
ical favoritism in the operation of her program, one of
six Capitol Hill investigations of EPA.
Lavelle may have vioated agency regulations by al
lowing executives of chemical companies to pay for
frequent meals at some of Washington's most ex
pensive restaurants, according to an EPA official.
Solidarity leaders sentenced
Warsaw, Poland — A Polish military court convicted
and handed down prison sentences yesterday rang
ing up to four-and-one-half years for organizers of
Radio Solidarity, the clandestine static 1 that pierced
the state monopoly of the air waves during martial law
last year to offer news from the political under
ground.
The guilty verdicts against Zbigniew Romaszewski,
43, a physicist who masterminded the operation; his
wife, Irena Zofia; and seven others who assisted in the
broadcasts ended what has been the most publicized
prosecution of those who actively resisted martial
law.
Romaszewski, a former national commission mem
ber of the now banned independent trade union Soli
darity has been active in Poland'sdemocraticopposi
tion since the mid-19705. He was sentenced to four
and-one-half years in prison for violating martial law
by continuing union activities and bv spreading what

the court declared was false information aimed at stir
ring social unrest and weakening Poland's defenses.
Hart declares candidacy
Denver — Sen. Gary Hart announced his longshot
campaign for the Democratic presidential nomi
nation yesterday, declaring that while the country
faces tough economic choices, "we can be ten
derhearted if we are also tough-minded."
Hart, who engineered George McGovern's cam
paign for the Democratic presidential nomination in
1972, is at age 45 the youngest of the likely 1984 con
tenders.
In a speech from the steps of the Colorado state
house, Hart said, "We now face a stark choice be
tween national renewal or national decline."
"The next president must shape domestic policies
that actually achieve progress — instead of per
petuating programs merely because there is a pres
sure group for them," he said.
With his wife, Lee, at his side, Hart spoke to about
500 cheering supporters. Facing the Rocky Mountains
visible in the distance, the senator said he believes it is
time for a Western candidate to have a serious shot at
the White House.
Hart is the second Democrat after Sen. Alan
Cranston of California to formally announce his presi
dential campaign.
Former Vice President Walter iMondale is to an

nounce his candidacy Monday, and other undeclared
contenders include Sens. John Glenn of Ohio, Ernest
Hollings of South Carolina and Dale Bumpers of Ar
kansas.
Mexico gets agricultural loan
Mexico City — U.S. Agriculture Secretary )ohn
Block on yesterday signed a $1.7 billion agricultural
loan package intended to help recession-plagued
Mexico buy American grains and other foodstuffs on
easy terms.
The agreement was negotiated in August, but was
increased by $700 million last week.
It includes loan money to buy more than 6 million
tons worth of grains, oil seeds and dairy products, and
also provides for Mexican purchases of an un
specified amount of powdered milk.
A joint statement said the package "contributes to
the availability of basic food commodities for the
Mexican people during 1983."
Commerce Secretary Hector Hernandez Cervantes
represented Mexico at the ceremony at which Block
signed the agreement.
Mexico plunged into its worst recession of the cen
tury when tne worldwide oil glut dried up revenues
the government had counted on for an ambitious de
velopment project. The new president, Miguel de la
Madrid, has started an austerity program intended to
get the nation back on its feet.

Guinea re-enters world scene
Conakry, Guinea — After years of isolation, West
Africa's firebrand orator of pan-Africanist socialist
revolution, Ahmed Sekou Toure, has loosened his
grip on Guinea and gradually allowed the country's
return to the world community.
But the preceding two decades of Stalinist-like ter
ror remain a dark memory among numerous Gui
neans.
Toure's socialist People's Revolutionary Republic
of Guinea, a West African nation about the size of Or
egon with rich mineral and agricultural potential, is
today a country of somber paradoxes of poverty and
neglect.
Stocks up amid mixed trading

Most other market indicators showed small declines.
Today's weather
Slight chance of light rain today at times, otherwise
dry with continued mild temperatures. Fog possible

Khadafy threatens U.S.
Tripoli, Libya— Libyan leader Col. Moammar
Khadafy vowed yesterday to turn the Gulf of Sidra
into a "red gulf of blood" if the U.S. aircraft carrier
Nimitz and its battle group dare to re-enter the dis
puted bay in the southern Mediterranean.
President Reagan has said there are no plans to in
volve U.S. forces in the region if Libya clashes with
Sudan, its U.S.-backed neighbor, but that American
troops have a right to defend themselves if fired
upon.
Two U.S. jet fighters conducting war games from
the Nimitz shot down a pair of Libyan planes after
being fired on over the gulf in August 1981, and the
Nimitz and its battle group just completed another set

of maneuvers there.
"Entering Sidra means an invasion of Libya. The Lib
yan people want to live as free people and won't ac
cept foreign occupation. The Gulf of Sidra will turn
into a red gulf of blood if anyone tries to sail through it
by force," Khadafy told his Parliament in the Libyan
capital of Tripoli.
In an address carried by Libya's official JANA news
agency, he warned that the U.S. Navy, operating
north of the Gulf of Sidra, "forms a challenge to the
Libyan nation. The Libyan people won't stand and
watch idly if pushed too far."
"We will not permit America or any foreign state to
enter the Gulf of Sidra or any other part of Libyan wa
ters, and this includes the Soviet Union, to which
were are linked by a relationship of friendship,'
