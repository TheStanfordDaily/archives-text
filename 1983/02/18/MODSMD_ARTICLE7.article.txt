Khadafy threatens U.S.
Tripoli, Libya— Libyan leader Col. Moammar
Khadafy vowed yesterday to turn the Gulf of Sidra
into a "red gulf of blood" if the U.S. aircraft carrier
Nimitz and its battle group dare to re-enter the dis
puted bay in the southern Mediterranean.
President Reagan has said there are no plans to in
volve U.S. forces in the region if Libya clashes with
Sudan, its U.S.-backed neighbor, but that American
troops have a right to defend themselves if fired
upon.
Two U.S. jet fighters conducting war games from
the Nimitz shot down a pair of Libyan planes after
being fired on over the gulf in August 1981, and the
Nimitz and its battle group just completed another set

of maneuvers there.
"Entering Sidra means an invasion of Libya. The Lib
yan people want to live as free people and won't ac
cept foreign occupation. The Gulf of Sidra will turn
into a red gulf of blood if anyone tries to sail through it
by force," Khadafy told his Parliament in the Libyan
capital of Tripoli.
In an address carried by Libya's official JANA news
agency, he warned that the U.S. Navy, operating
north of the Gulf of Sidra, "forms a challenge to the
Libyan nation. The Libyan people won't stand and
watch idly if pushed too far."
"We will not permit America or any foreign state to
enter the Gulf of Sidra or any other part of Libyan wa
ters, and this includes the Soviet Union, to which
were are linked by a relationship of friendship,'

Khadafy said.
Reagan withholds EPA papers
Washington—President Reagan yesterday
backed away from his statement that he would pro
vide disputed Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA) documents to Congress because of allegations
of "wrongdoing" at the agency, and instead re
asserted his claim to executive privilege over the rec
ords.
The turnabout came after Reagan said at his na
tionally televised news conference Wednesday night
that, "I can no longer insist on executive privilege if
there's a suspicion in the minds of the people that
maybe it is being used to cover some wrongdoing."
White House spokesman Larry Speakes insisted yes

terday that Reagan has not abandoned the executive
privilege claim. He corrected Reagan's suggestion
that he would offer directly to Congress documents
involving possible wrongdoing by EPA officials.
Instead, Speakes said, the records will be submitted
first to the Justice Department, which will then decide
"whether it is necessary" to make them available for
congressional review.
Reagan met for 15 minutes in the Oval Office yes
terday with embattled EPA Administrator Anne
Gorsuch, but White House officials ordered that no
details of the meeting be revealed.
At the same time, Rita Lavelle, ousted chief of the
hazardous waste cleanup program, did not honor a
subpoena to appear before a House subcommittee
