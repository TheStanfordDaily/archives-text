## All the President's ... Staff Who are they? What do they do? Do they like their jobs ? 
### KRISTEN BROWN 
As President Donald Kennedy rounded
the corner of Building 10 in the Quad, he
swung his bike lock and paused for a mo
ment to soak in the sun. Inside Building 10,
all was a flurry of preparation and anticipa
tion as Kennedy's staff prepared for his next
meeting.
Stacks of mail, continuous phone calls,
innmerable banquet invitations and re
peated interview requests flood Kennedy's
office each month.
Kennedy's office stays the flood.
Bob Hamrdla
Bob Hamrdla, special assistant to the Pres
ident, whisked into his office right on time.
Hamrdla is always on time. He has to be. He
attends many of the upper level meetings on
campus: the board of trustees, SVVOPSI Pol
icy Board, Undergraduate Cabinet.
As one of Kennedy's close advisors and a
University old-timer, Hamrdla knows what's
going on. He fits the image of the Stanford
administrator: no pin-striped suit, but a pair
of chino pants set off by a coordinated belt
and tie.

While Hamrdla's counterpart, Special As
sistant Marlene Wine, deals with people
outside the University who want to get a
hold of Kennedy, Hamrdla deals with people
inside the University community. His pet
peeve is that people don't know how busy
the President is nor what sort of grievances
are proper to bring to his attention. Kennedy
often gets calls from students complaining
about broken windows or other relatively
trivial matters. Hamrdla channels these calls
to the proper people, or, if they've got the
right office, to schedule appointments.
"I had a call yesterday (Feb. 9) from a stu
dent who wanted to discuss dorm funds for
liquor," he said. The student apparently
wanted to meet with Kennedy by that Friday
(Feb. 11). Hamrdla told the student that was
by far too short a notice.
Even so, Hamrdla said that Kennedy's av
erage day includes at least one student
interview.
"As an office we want to maintain easy
accessibility. I don't like the word 'filter.' My
task is to help get the person what he
needs." This often can be achieved without
Kennedy's help.
Hamrdla also said that he and his assistant,

7 spend an average of 30
to 60 minutes a day with
Kennedy. That doesn't
mean alone. How often
do I see him alone?
Probably neverV - Bob
Hamrdla, special assistant
to the president

Shirley Richardson, are responsible for
"trustee affairs." They do not negotiate or
lobby at these meetings which he described
as "largely bureaucratic. ' They organize
them.
With such responsibilities, Hamrdla must
be precise. Anyone who has to juggle the
schedule of a boss constantly shuttling
around the country must learn to get things
right the first time.
"It's easy to get caught up in the whole
thing. There are times when you think you
won't have a moment to yourself ever." Re
cently, however, he spent some free time
watching " 'Winds of War' like a hawk," he
said.
When asked about his daily encounters
with Kennedy, he said that when considering
dorm receptions, trustee meetings and the
three meetings he, Wine and Stephens have
with Kennedy each week, he spends an
average 30 to 60 minutes a day with Kennedy.
"That doesn't mean alone," he said. "How
often do I see him alone? Probably never!"
