## All the President's ... Staff Who are they? What do they do? Do they like their jobs ? 
### KRISTEN BROWN 
As President Donald Kennedy rounded
the corner of Building 10 in the Quad, he
swung his bike lock and paused for a mo
ment to soak in the sun. Inside Building 10,
all was a flurry of preparation and anticipa
tion as Kennedy's staff prepared for his next
meeting.
Stacks of mail, continuous phone calls,
innmerable banquet invitations and re
peated interview requests flood Kennedy's
office each month.
Kennedy's office stays the flood.
Bob Hamrdla
Bob Hamrdla, special assistant to the Pres
ident, whisked into his office right on time.
Hamrdla is always on time. He has to be. He
attends many of the upper level meetings on
campus: the board of trustees, SVVOPSI Pol
icy Board, Undergraduate Cabinet.
As one of Kennedy's close advisors and a
University old-timer, Hamrdla knows what's
going on. He fits the image of the Stanford
administrator: no pin-striped suit, but a pair
of chino pants set off by a coordinated belt
and tie.

While Hamrdla's counterpart, Special As
sistant Marlene Wine, deals with people
outside the University who want to get a
hold of Kennedy, Hamrdla deals with people
inside the University community. His pet
peeve is that people don't know how busy
the President is nor what sort of grievances
are proper to bring to his attention. Kennedy
often gets calls from students complaining
about broken windows or other relatively
trivial matters. Hamrdla channels these calls
to the proper people, or, if they've got the
right office, to schedule appointments.
"I had a call yesterday (Feb. 9) from a stu
dent who wanted to discuss dorm funds for
liquor," he said. The student apparently
wanted to meet with Kennedy by that Friday
(Feb. 11). Hamrdla told the student that was
by far too short a notice.
Even so, Hamrdla said that Kennedy's av
erage day includes at least one student
interview.
"As an office we want to maintain easy
accessibility. I don't like the word 'filter.' My
task is to help get the person what he
needs." This often can be achieved without
Kennedy's help.
Hamrdla also said that he and his assistant,

7 spend an average of 30
to 60 minutes a day with
Kennedy. That doesn't
mean alone. How often
do I see him alone?
Probably neverV - Bob
Hamrdla, special assistant
to the president

Shirley Richardson, are responsible for
"trustee affairs." They do not negotiate or
lobby at these meetings which he described
as "largely bureaucratic. ' They organize
them.
With such responsibilities, Hamrdla must
be precise. Anyone who has to juggle the
schedule of a boss constantly shuttling
around the country must learn to get things
right the first time.
"It's easy to get caught up in the whole
thing. There are times when you think you
won't have a moment to yourself ever." Re
cently, however, he spent some free time
watching " 'Winds of War' like a hawk," he
said.
When asked about his daily encounters
with Kennedy, he said that when considering
dorm receptions, trustee meetings and the
three meetings he, Wine and Stephens have
with Kennedy each week, he spends an
average 30 to 60 minutes a day with Kennedy.
"That doesn't mean alone," he said. "How
often do I see him alone? Probably never!"

and Marlene Wine; Marlene Wine,
special assistant to the president.


Besides reviewing Kennedy's mail and de
ciding if, in fait, he is the appropriate person
to deal with it, Wine helps to coordinate
various campus events.
Currently, she is acting as a liaison be
tween the Queen's luncheon committee
and the President's office. She staffs the
commencement speaker's panel (this year
she arranged for George Schultz; last year,
( hief justice Sandra O'Connor) and informs
Kennedy of his commencement role.
If person outside the University com
munity wants an interview with Kennedy, or
an organization wants him to speak at
one of their affairs, they go through Wine.
Last week, U.S. News spoke with her to
see if Kennedy would grant them an inter
view for a feature article they want to do next
year for their 50th anniversary issue.
Wine said, "Stanford helps me to think on
very broad terms. People are very open to
examining issues at all angles. I find that very
refreshing."
Wine received a bachelor's degree in
psychology at UCLA, came to work at Stan
ford in 1971 and has worked for Kennedy
since 1979. In regards to her job now, she
said, "Every day is different — I like that."
Elaine Gloystein
Elaine Gloystein, who has worked in the
President's office for 12 years says half-

of office administration

jokingly, "I bring a historical perspective to
the place."
Gloystein has made a career re-entry. For
1b years she kept busy volunteering for PTA
Program Chairperson, Cadet leade
r. . . .She admits having trouble at first "get
ting into a lock-step, 8 to 5 job," after being
her own manager.
As Gloystein said, "I'm almost the "RA" of
the President and Provost's Office." She
does some peer counseling and she inter
views and screens candidates for the clerical
staff.
"It's a challenge for me to find candidates
(for jobs) that have potential and to see them
grow in their jobs," she said.
Gloystein is responsible for having chosen
the office's four-year-old NBI computer sys
tem. She also redecorated Kennedy's office
after his inauguration and changes the of
fice's art exhibits every few months.
"I remember one time a huge, grotesque,
monster cockroach came into the office
from the basement and one of the sec
retaries screamed. Kennedy came in and
picked it up and put it in the center of his
palm and began to examine it's marvelous
physical attributes."
Phyllis Stephens
Constantly badgered for interviews and
guest appearances, Kennedy needs an ad
ministrative assistant who can say "no,"
without provoking anger. Phyllis Stephens,
administrative assistant to the President,
realizes that the Kennedy image is at a pre
mium.
In addition to fending off the barage of
calls, she makes Kennedy's appointments
and travel arrangements, gathers back
ground materials for his meetings and an
swers many phone calls. "Sometimes it
seems like all I have time to do is answer
phone calls and follow up on the caller's
needs," she said.
Almost everything Kennedy signs,
Stephens proofreads. Stephens said that
Kennedy "reads for content and she reads
for technicalities."
Describing her working relationship with
Kennedy, she said she sees him frequently
each day, but that he is extremely busy. "I
thought I had a lot of energy. He is an incred
ibly high-energy person, but he stays amaz
ingly relaxed and informal with all of his
pressures."
She mentioned a day the previous week
when Kennedy told her he had not talked to
herinawhileand asked her if she would join
him for a quick lunch in his office. Kennedy
returned from the political science building a
few minutes later with two cups of soup. "He
really talked and shared his thoughts," Phyllis
recalled.
Seven months ago, Kennedy chose
Stephens from among 60 applicants. Previ
ously, she worked for the eight months for
the Dean of the Law School.

When asked what partu ular aspect she
liked about working in the President's of
fice, Stephens emphasized the c compatibility
of staff members.

assistant

"We do work under pressure," Stephens
said. "But we are willing to take a laugh."
She attributes the amazingly relaxed atmos
phere to Kennedy, whom she said loves a
good laugh.
Patricia DelPozzo
Donald Kennedy talks a lot and when
Kennedy talks — at least for an official audi
ence — Patricia DelPozzo types. DelPozzo

'/ like working with Don,
it's stimulating. He has
such an active mind. It
makes me think in areas
that I might not think in
my own mind/ - Patricia
DelPozzo, secretary to
the president

types most of Kennedy's speeches and cor
respondence.
She and her office-mate, an NBI word pro
cessor that Kennedy calls "Magic," arrived as
newcomers to the campus three years ago.
DelPozzo assists Kennedy through an
elaborate speech-writing process. For al
most every speech Kennedy makes exceed
ing 15 minutes, according to DelPozzo,
Kennedy first develops his idea in his mind
for a varying number of days. After he dic
tates a rough sketch of the speech into a
tape, DelPozzo types it into the NBI and re
turns a hard copy to Kennedy, who then makes
changes, and returns the altered draft to
DelPozzo who types it again.
DelPozzo says that she will revise, revise
and revise again. "He is very conscientious
about being prepared."
"I like working with Don. It's stimulating.
He has such an active mind. It makes me
think in areas that I might not think in my
own mind."

such an overview of the
University and beyond -

Catherine Presnell,
secretary to Elaine
Gloystein and Marlene
Wine

Catherine Presnell
As University bureaucracy goes, presi
dents need assistants and assistants need
assistance. This is where Catherine Presnell,
secretary to Gloystein and Wine,comes in.
Serene and calm, Presnell fills the Ken
nedy bill: "an assistant that facilitates but
does not try to impose his or her own style."
Besides acting as secretary for Wine and
Gloystein, Presnell types up the annual
committee assignment letters. She "logs" all
the mail, writing up a brief description and
summary, and distributes it to Kennedy or

whomever is appropriate.
Presnell worked at the Bechtel Institute
for three years before coming to the Presi
dent's office seven months ago. Presnell i<
married to a Stanford graduate, has a sor
who is a senior at Stanford and another whc
is a sophomore at Vanderbilt University. She
went to school at UC—Berkeley.
"I think this office gets an overview of th(
whole University and beyond — how the
federal government is involved in educa
tion, for instance, and how the community i'
involved in Stanford,'' Presnell said.

Boh Hamrdla

Shirley Richardson
Shirley Richardson, petite, soft-spoken
and conservatively-dressed, stations herself
outside Hamrdla's office.
In addition to organizing Hamrdla's ap
pointments and phone calls, she said, "most
of what I do is with the board of trustees."
She helps Hamrdla to organize and prepare
the agenda for the seven annual trustee
meetings. "There is a lot that goes into
them," she said.
Her working contact with Kennedy is indi
rect, but Richardson said that he has been
"very complimentary and encouraging."
Richardson, married to Stanford graduate
Scott Richardson, worked at Harvard's ad
mission and financial aids office before com
ing to Stanford. She worked in the Religious
Studies Department for two years before
transferring to Kennedy's clan a year ago.
Richardson said, "I like the academic at
mosphere here. Students here seem more
cheerful and easy going (than Harvard's.
They are not in such a hurry."
