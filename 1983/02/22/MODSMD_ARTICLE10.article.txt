# Cardinal athletes going for '84 Olympic gold
## 
### KATHY OLMSTED Senior staff writer 
Gaining a place on the U.S.
Olympic team is often the
greatest achievement of an
amateur athlete's career.
Thousands of American
athletes have directed years of
rigorous training towards gain
ing the opportunity to repre
sent the United States in the
Olympics next summer.
A significant number of
these young Olympic hopefuls
attend Stanford. According to
coaches here, more than 30
Cardinal athletes have realistic
chances to make the 1984 U.S.
Olympic team.
A brief survey of the sports
here most likely to have Olym
pic representatives follows.
Swimming
The men's and women's
swim teams will "without a
doubt'' send Stanford's largest
delegation to the Olympics,
according to Men's Swim
coach Skip Kenney. In 1980,
the swim teams here had more
representatives on the U.S.
Olympic Swim Team than any
other university, Kenney said.
And the Cardinal will send
even more this time, he added.
Four likely prospects for the
'84 Olympics from the Stanford
swim teams were on the 1980
team: Kim Carlisle, Marybeth
Linzmeier, Dave Sims and John
Simons.
Carlisle, a senior majoring in
Communication, qualified for
the 1980 U.S. Olympic Swim
Team in the 10 0- meter
backstroke. She said she was
disappointed when her chance
to represent the United States
in Moscow was "plucked
away - ' by the Olympic boycott,
but she added that she had
gained confidence and experi
ence since that disappoint
ment.
Head swimming coach
George Haines will be an assis
tant coach for the U.S. Olym
pic swim team. Sophomore
Linzmeier, a freestyle swimmer
who is also majoring in com
munication, said not only
Haines but also her high school
coach would be coaching the
games. "It'll be good having
both of them there," she said.
The men also have several
top contenders for Olympic
berths. Junior Sims, a freestyle
swimmer, said several of his
teammates had excellent shots
at making the Olympics. The
U.S. men's swimming team as a
whole will he "very, very
strong," Sims said.
Simons, a senior majoring in
economics, said the 1984
Olympic men's swim team will
be quite different than the
team that was formed three
years ago. He stressed that the
'80 team had several leaders
that directed the team. "Now
it's a question of who is going
to take the reins of this leader
ship," he said. Simons said he
wasn't too disappointed about
the boycott because "at that
time my dream had been to
make the team."
The swimmers have to match
certain time standards in order
to be invited to the Olympic
trials. In swimming, these trials

are typically held about three
weeks before opening cere
monies. Once the swimmers
make the trials, they have to
finish first or second in their
event in order to make the
team.
In the 1980 Olympics, how
ever, the lop three swimmers
in each event were selected for
the team. Since only the top
two or three athletes in each
event will be given Olympic
team spots next year, the 1984
team will be more difficult to
make.
All of the swimmers were op
timistic about the potential
strength of the U.S. swim
team, but the women were es
pecially apprehensive about
facing the East Germans.
"I'm convinced they're on
steroids, but no one can prove
it," Carlisle said. But she added
that the U.S. women's team
will also be strong. "I think
we'll fare very well," she said.
One factor that could poten
tially bother many Olympic
athletes is the Southern
California smog. Kenney said
he didn't think the smog would
affect swimmers' times, but he
added he hoped for Stanford

recruiting purposes the smog
would be "so thick they can't
find their way to the pool."
Abundant evidence of Los
Angeles' least attractive attri
bute could give Stanford a
great recruitingadvantageover
USC and UCLA, Kenney said.
Haines said Patricia Gavin,
Sherri Hanna, Libby Kincaid,
Barb Major, Kathy Smith and
Diana Zock all had good shots
at making the U.S. Olympic
team, and that Isabel Reuss
might swim for Mexico. Ken
ney said Dave Bottom, Jon De
nney, John Engs, John Moffet,
Bari Weick and Sam Worden
were good bets for the U.S.
team; Wade Flemons might
swim for Canada, he said.
Track and field
The track and field team also
has several potential Olym
pians. Brooks Johnson di
rector of cross country, who
will be the head women's track
and field coach for the Olym
pic team, said Ceci Hopp, Pat
ricia Sue Plumer, Kim
Schnurpfeil, Carol Cady and
Mary Osborne could all be on

the American team. Alison
Wiley also has a good chance of
making the Canadian team, he
said.
Sophomore Hopp said she
was optimistic about her
chances. "If I keep improving
like I have, I think I have a really
good shot," she said.
Senior Schnurpfeil, a dis
tance runner, also thought her
chances were good. "I've got
the speed and the endurance,"
she said.
Schnurpfeil is the 10,000-
meters national champion, but
this event will not be offered at
the '84 Olympics. She will start
training for the marathon after
she finishes the MCATs, she
said. Distance running is a new
sport for women, Schnurpfeil
said, and the Russian and East
German women are the domi
nant forces in this area.
Training for the Olympic
track and field team takes a lot
of time, but Schnurpfeil said
she didn't feel running hurt her
studies. "I don't look at it as
taking away from my
academics," she said. "There's
a certain amount of time that

you need to relax after study
ing hard," she said, adding that
she felt "refreshed and ready
to study" after practice.
Modern pentathlon
One of the lesser known but
most demanding Olympic
events is the modern pen
tathlon, involving horseback
riding, shooting, fencing,
swimming and running. Stan
ford has a definite Olympic
Pentathlon contender in Har
vey Cain, a senior majoring in
economics.
Cain explained that the Pen
tathlon hasitsorigin in the mili
tary: in the days of the cavalry,
officers would have to ride
through enemy lines, shoot
and fence with opponents, and
jump and swim obstacles. This
diversity provides the pen
tathlete with "a lot of different
ways to get hurt," Cain said.
The sport also requires a
wide array of psychological
states from the athletes, Cain
said. The pentathletes, tired
from fencing and swimming,
must calm themselves down
for shooting with .22 caliber
pistols, then pump themselves
up for the run.

Cain said he chose to com
pete in the pentathlon because
"I love to do lots of different
sports." Cain used to enjoy
swimming the most, he said,
but now he prefers the horse
back riding.
Cain said he took the last
year off to earn money and re
cover from a serious horseback
riding accident, but now he's
training hard again. Cain took
three years off to train for the
1980 Olympics, he said, but
when the boycott was an
nounced he didn't try to make
the U.S. team because of an
injury.
Cain has been competing in
the pentathlon for 11 years, he
said, which has been tough on
his physically. "Some of it's
kinda caught up with me, I
think," he said.
Reid is also a world-class
pentathlete, fencing coach
Buzz Hurst said, but the 1984
Olympics will not offer a wom
en's pentathlon event.
Wrestling
Wrestling coach Chris Hor
pel, an alternate on the 1976
Olympic team, designated

senior Doug Perkins as the Car
dinal wrestler most likely to
make the 1984 Olympics
Perkins said it was difficult
for him to assess his chances
this early. "The nationils this
year will be a place for me to
size myself up," he said.
Perkins will probably stay at
Stanford next year and train, he
said. The Olympic wrestling
style is different than the col
legiate style, and he has to
learn to adjust.
Perkins said he had confi
dence in his ability. "My style is
bizarre enough that I could
beat anyone," he said.
Tennis
Tennis will only be an exhibi
tion sport in 1984 â€” which
means that the points will not
count towards team totals.
However, the relatively recent
appearance of tennis on the
Olympic scene means that the
potential athletes are less ex
cited about participating.
"It's kind of strange because
I don't know if it would be
good to have it as an Olympic
sport anyway," said sopho
more Linda Gates. But she ad
mitted, "I would love the
chance to participate in it."
Gates said thr inclusion of
tennis in the Olympics might
help amateur tennis in the fu
ture, but now the "ultimate
goal" for most American tennis
players is winning the U.S.
Open, she said, not playing in
the Olympics.
The coaches
In addition to the large
number of athletes the Univer
sity will probably send to the
Olympics, two representatives
of the coaching staff here will
also be at the Games.
Haines, who has coached in
the Olympics seven times be
fore, was notified in Septem
ber that he had been selected
by the 60-person Olympic
Committee to be an assistant
coach for swimming. Haines
will also be a head coach at the
Pan American games in
Caracas, Venezuela, this sum
mer.
Haines said the U.S. Wom
en's Olympic Swim Team
should be "one of our best
teams ever," but he added he
was worried about the East
Germans.
Johnson who was an assis
tant track and field coach at the
1976 Olympics, said he
couldn't predict the strength of
the 1984 U.S. Olympic Track
and Field Team this early.
Johnson said he wasn't wor
ried about the smog in L.A.
"Every place has inherent
problems," he said, citing the
food in Moscow and the pollen
in Eugene, Oregon as other
natural disadvantages.
Kenney, who will be an assis
tant coach at the Pan American
Games, said he was still a little
bitter that he won't be an
Olympic coach. "I missed
Olympic coach by one vote be
cause of some politicking that
went on," he said.
