## The 						Stanford Daily Refuse scholarship offer 
### 
Recently an anonymous donor offered the
University a scholarship fund for homosexual
students. University President Donald Kennedy
turned down the proposal but the donor re
submitted the offer along with stronger argu
ments to support it. Kennedy then turned the
proposal over to his staff for their recom
mendations.
At this point the fate of the scholarship re
mains uncertain. Kennedy and Robert Hamrdla,
an assistant to Kennedy, have both indicated
that the fund will probably be turned down be
cause it requires an individual to make a decla
ration of faith. Verification of such a declara
tion, they say, would required "an impermissa
ble invasion of privacy" by the University, as
Hamrdla phrased it.
The Cay and Lesbian Alliance (CLAS) here has
voiced opposition to the University's view be
cause they, according to CLAS steering commit
tee member David Abernethy, believe that gays
and lesbians are as identifiable as any other
minority. Thus, they say, the University should
apply the same acceptance standards to this
scholarship as it would to any other.
We agree with the original University position
on the scholarship fund. Kennedy's assertion
that the award has "two strikes" against it is
true; the award requires a declaration of faith
which could only be verified with undue inter
ference on the University's part.

Accepting such a scholarship would set a bad
precedent. Next the University might be asked
to accept a scholarship aimed specifically at stu
dents who were heterosexual, and again it
would have to unduly intervene to verify a stu
dent's sexual preferences.
Although we recognize that the University
does have scholarships set aside for certain de
signations of students — with athletic schol
arships being the most prominent of these —
such scholarships are based on achievements
that are readily verifiable. This scholarship is
neither merit-based nor based on qualifications
that are verifiable without delving into students'
sex lives.
We do not wish to discourage potential
donors of scholarship funds. In an era of rising
tuition costs and falling federal and state finan
cial aid funds, private sources of scholarships
are being looked to more and more to fill the
gaps left by a government less committed to
student aid programs. This is all the more true
for Stanford because of its aid-blind admissions
policy and its goals to meet every student's fi
nancial need.
However, we believe that the University
should decline to accept scholarship aid based
on a statement of faith. To the anonymous
donor of this $500 award, we suggest that he or
she donate the money instead to GLAS itself,
and help it represent all gays and lesbians on
campus.
