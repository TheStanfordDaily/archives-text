# Myopia hurts space program
## 
### 
In his book 2081, noted Princeton
physicist Gerard O'Neill comments
that "the long-term health of a nation
is probably shown most clearly by
the time scale of the programs it un
dertakes. The willingness to commit
to ventures of many years' duration
... is the hallmark of a nation confi
dent of itsow|i tuture. Thefearof any
commitment beyond one or two
years is the symptom of disease
. . . ." The disease O'Neill speaks of
is the disease of myopia, of de
featism, of an inability to face or plan
for the future. The rampant spread of
that disease in the United States
today is exemplified most dishear
teningly in the almost universal
apathy of most Americans, including
unfortunately our "leaders," toward
the challenge of space exploration.
The shocking depth of this near
sighted apathy was demonstrated
somewhat more than a year ago,
when President Reagan eliminated
from the federal budget the funds
necessary to maintain the scientists
and staff at the Jet Propulsion Labora
tory in Pasadena, whose job it is to
receive and decode the signals from
Voyager 2.
The Voyager spacecraft, you will
recall, made those spectacular flybys
of Jupiter and Saturn in 1979-81, har
vesting an unprecedented wealth of
information. Voyager 2 is due to fly
by Uranus in 1986 and Neptune in
1989. Its path has already been de
termined by the laws of gravity and
no budget cut can prevent it from
reaching its destination. The budget

cut Reagan proposed meant essen
tially that having sent this technolog
ical extension of the human race two
billion miles from Earth, we would
figuratively close our eyes as that
probe swept by Uranus, revealing in
magnificent detail a planet known
heretofore as no more than a smudgy
dot in a telescope. The cut was insig
nificantly small, of course. As a mat
ter of fact, all the unmanned planet
ary exploration probes ever
launched by the United States,
added up together, cost less than the
price of just one Trident submarine.
No, it was not the size of the cut
that was important, but rather its im
plications for the future of the
human race. A society that could
effectively throw away and forget, out
of sheer boredom and after only five
years, such a miraculous creation of
human ingenuity is not a sick soci
ety; it is a dying society. Fortunately
for the sanity of many planetary sci
entists, the funding to monitor Voy
ager's transmissions was eventually
restored. For planetary science as a
whole, however, despite this small
"victory," the war is being lost.
Put simply, the Reagan administra
tion has all but completely cancelled
the involvement of the United States
in planetary exploration. Russia, la
pan, and the European Space Agency
have all committed themselves to
launching probes to Halley's Comet
in 1985. The United States, the
pioneer and heretofore the unchal
lengeable leader in the field of

planetary exploration, chose to sit
idly by. The opportunity for a U.S.
Halley's Comet probe, a probe that
would have been more sophisti
cated, more advanced, and more
scientifically productive than that of
any other nation, has already been
passed up, irrevocably lost.
The administration is shoestr ig
ing along, at the lowest possible level
of funding commitment, a Galileo
probe to explore lupiter's satellites
and dive into its atmosphere. If it
ever does get off the ground it ap
pears quite likely to be the solitary
planetary probe launched by the
United States in the entire decade of
the 1980s. A sad epitaph indeed for
the nation which launched Mariner,
Pioneer, Viking, Pioneer-Venus, and
Voyager, not to mention Mercury,
Gemini, Apollo, and the Space Shut
tle, our magnificently successful
manned space efforts.
The issue in planetary science is
not one of capability. America's
capability in this area is unsurpassed;
it is superb. It is not a question of
expense. The Galileo probe will cost
less than one twentieth of one per
cent of one year's federal budget,
, spread over more than five years. It is
a question of commitment and noth
ing else. It is that commitment which
seems to be utterly lackingat present
in the Reagan administration, and
sadly, to a large degree, in the major
ity of the American people.
