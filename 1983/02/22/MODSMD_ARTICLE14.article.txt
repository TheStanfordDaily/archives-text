## When the thrill of life is gone

The discussion of suicide is so
threatening to those who intend to
live to a ripe old age, and so intensely
painful to those who don't that often
it is foreshortened or avoided al
together. Counseling and Psycholog
ical Services (CAPS) and the Bridge
are to be commended for organizing
the Mental Health Week programs
on depression and suicide. Their
message is one which needs to be
extended to a broader cross-section
of the Stanford community than was
represented by the 40 people in at
tendance at Rinconada Lounge last
Tuesday afternoon and the even
smaller group at Meyer Forum Room
last Wednesday.
Suicide is the second leading
cause of death among the 15 to 25 age
group. On college campuses, people
point to test anxiety, big pond small
fish syndrome and competition for
graduate school admission as factors
precipitating student suicides. But
the stresses of the transition to
adulthood, financial pressures and
the feelings of isolation are not
unique to the hallowed halls of
higher education. Statistically,
suicide is no more prevalent among
college students than the same age
population at large. Nor is a rigorous
Ivy League atmosphere more of a
psychological pressure cooker than a
low-key, non-demanding commu
nity college. The painful struggle for
self-awareness and the requisite
search for meaning in life transcends
all societal delineations and defines a

stage of human development. Some
individuals are so overwhelmed by
the weight of these matters that they
lose their ability to function and may,
indeed, cure their psychic pain by
committing suicide.
The key to survival seems to be tied
up in self-image. If, through what
ever good fortune of up-bringing,
heredity or luck, a person has a
strong, positive self-image, he is
much better equipped to handle the

vicissitudes of life. One reads, from
time to time, of "super-kids," chil
dren subjected to multiple traumas
of divorce, abuse, poverty, or
perhaps death of a sibling, who
nonetheless emerge emotionally un
scathed. At the other end of the scale

is the advantaged child, the kid "who
has everything going for him," yet is
an emotional cripple. Super-kids do
not commit suicide. Children who
have failed to develop psychological
resources and who do not have firm
external support systems are likely
candidates to develop a depressive
illness that can lead to self
destruction.
The major questions brought up
by last Tuesday's workshop were:
How do you recognize that someone
is a suicide risk? What can you do to
help deter a suicidal person from that
final act?
Some answers were provided on
Wednesday by Perrin French, a psy
chiatrist for the Menlo Park Veterans
Administration Hospital. He de
scribed a depressed person as one
who looks depressed, talks about
being depressed, and depresses
you, the interviewer. I would like to

add, further, that clinical unipolar
depression usually manifests itself by
marked changed in appetite — in
creased or decreased, disrupted
sleep patterns — difficulty falling as
leep and waking before dawn, and an
inability to concentrate.
Another way to characterize de
pression is "No Joy." Normally
pleasant activites do not alleviate the
victim's mood. He has lost interest in
hobbies, in friends, in sex. Comedy

doesn't make him laugh. The feeling
of gloom and doom is so pervasive
that suicide may seem to offer the
only escape.
What can you do if someone you
know is suffering or has spoken
openly of suicide? First and

foremost, he a friend. The victim's
self-esteem is at an all-time low. It
you can convince him that you truly
care whether he lives or dies, you
may be the lifeline that enables him
to hold on. You will need to be a
constructive listener. Try to draw out
the specifics of what is bothering
him.
French suggests pointing out areas
of positive self-esteem, e.g., good
athlete, talented musician. Try to
make your friend see how his view of
the world has become negatively
polarized. Impress upon him that
depression is a temporary state; that
waiting it out will be worthwhile. If'
your friend speaks of committing
suicide, do not condemn the idea.
Rather, tell him that you disagree
with suicide as a solution and you
hope he will seek alternatives. Fi
nally, encourage him to seek profes
sional counseling. Without profes
sional intervention, suicide attempts
are much more likely to be repeated.
The 1983 Mental Health Week
series was subtitled "Coping with
Stress at Stanford." Understanding
workaholic-type behavior, mastering
relaxation techniques, discussing
separation anxiety, are undoubtedly
beneficial. But perhaps what we in
the college community most desper
ately need to learn is how to fail. For
what is stress, at its deepest level, but
something that raises our anxiety
about failure. Industry stresses me

methods of breaking. Let us learn
drastic methods of quality control for
our lives.
