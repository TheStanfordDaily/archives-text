## High technology fosters to talitarianist thought 
### 
Ernst lunger, Hitler's intellectual
apologist, had a vision of "a
technological world empire" and a
"religion of anti-Christian technol
ogy." One gets at least a glimpse of
the connection between high
technology and totalitarianism in the
recent article by )an Boyer (Daily,
Feb. 15): his threatening those who
demur at taking computer science
courses with being seen as
"humanist basket cases" and lacking
in "school spirit." Where have we
seen that before. . . .
The other night somebody who re
ally knows about these things, con
ceivably the leading engineering
personality in America, told some of
us that high technology would never
be anything more than a marginal
phenomenon in our total civiliza
tion. He himself does his serious
writing with a pen because it is more
"painstaking," setting him miles
apart from the robotic mentality of
Boyer.
A brilliant student who took her
Ph.D. in electrical engineering as
well as a minor in my field found the
humanist thinking to be sophisti
cated even on narrowly intellectual
grounds. Some of us didn't need to
be told that. The basic epistemologi
cal stuff of high technology is obvi
ously at crayfish level (if that), and
dozens of imaginative cyberneticians
etc. have said just that in public. So
Boyer's recommendation to take
courses in ( omputer science for their
general interest is utterly unconvinc
ing. He seems himself to be a prime
example of what happens when the
humanities languish.

Okay, take the course anyway. It
will delight IBM, which has invested
thousands (in almost-free word
processors) in corrupting us; you
might even learn something. But
only on this condition: thatyou don't
take those dead-gutted gadgets seri
ously.

This is in reply to Rachelle Mar
shall's letter (Daily, Feb. 16), in which
she wrote "where Israeli troops have
been ordered to beat and shoot chil
dren." Rachelle, there is no such
commandment as "You shall talk
loud and tell blunt lies to defend
your point!"
I here is a limit to how much non
sense one can hear without reacting.
Remember, it's the Palestinian Liber
ation Organization which went into a
hospital and threw babies out of the
windows a few years ago, not the Is
raelis.

I |ust read Paul Baer's article on
'Thinking about the homeless"

(Daily, Feb. 9), and needless to say, I
feel frustrated — does he or doesn't
he want to help people — does he or
doesn't he really want to take a look
at our world situation? I find it in
teresting that he and some other
Stanford students took the time to
travel all the way to San lose to visit
the "homeless, deprived, and
needy" and then got in their car to
return home to ponder the question
of whether or not the trip was really
worthwhile, and whether it could
help anyone.
Now, please don't misunderstand,
it seems very positive that not only
Stanford students realize what the
problems are out there but that all of
us need to become aware of what our
economic situation is really doing,
not only to the poor but also to the
needy in our great country. I for one
have known for a long, long time
what goes on out there in that great
big world. And yes, folks, now that
tent cities are in the news everyone is
getting into the act of looking at
them. I have news for you, a tent city
is nothing new.
How about you students going to
visit some of our old people's
homes? Or better still, some of our
mental hospitals if you really want to
see some people who are down and
out. You might come back with a
different outlook on what really is
out ihere in the real world. No, it is
not pleasant — these people have a
roof over their heads, some food to
eat — but how about the loneliness
and suffering they are feeling?
I agree, our Reagan economic
policies stink, but the situation with

homeless, disoriented people goes
back a long way. Instead of just now
looking at the "street scene" I chal
lenge you to take a real good
look, not only at the street scene, but
what is considered to be "care" in
some of our hospitals and institu
tions. Now if you have the stomach
for it — and if you think you can tol
erate it — go find out. Let me tell you ,
it is challenging!
You students are great for even try
ing to take a look and I commend you
for it. You are the next generation
coming up in our great country. Are
you going to change the problem of
the poor and the needy — or, again,
just look at it and walk away?

who feel the University's rent policy
to be unfair and abusive, and to pro
pose a symbolic gesture: let all those
graduate students now living in Es

Mirrielees move off-campus im
mediately. Furthermore, let them in
protest donate these insufficient liv

These actions will express their

economic situation is really doing,
not only to the poor but also to the
needy in our great country. I for one
have known for a long, long time
what goes on out there in that great
big world. And yes, folks, now that
tent cities are in the news everyone is
getting into the act of looking at
them. I have news for you, a tent city
is nothing new.
How about you students going to
visit some of our old people's
homes? Or better still, some of our
mental hospitals if you really want to
see some people who are down and
out. You might come back with a
different outlook on what really is
out ihere in the real world. No, it is
not pleasant — these people have a
roof over their heads, some food to
eat — but how about the loneliness
and suffering they are feeling?
I agree, our Reagan economic
policies stink, but the situation with

homeless, disoriented people goes
back a long way. Instead of just now
looking at the "street scene" I chal
lenge you to take a real good
look, not only at the street scene, but
what is considered to be "care" in
some of our hospitals and institu
tions. Now if you have the stomach
for it — and if you think you can tol
erate it — go find out. Let me tell you ,
it is challenging!
You students are great for even try
ing to take a look and I commend you
for it. You are the next generation
coming up in our great country. Are
you going to change the problem of
the poor and the needy — or, again,
just look at it and walk away?

Housing idea
I would like to express my sincere
support for those graduate students
who feel the University's rent policy
to be unfair and abusive, and to pro
pose a symbolic gesture: let all those
graduate students now living in Es
condido, Crothers, Manzanita and
Mirrielees move off-campus im
mediately. Furthermore, let them in
protest donate these insufficient liv
ing allowances to undergradates.
These actions will express their
feelings more eloquently than any i
amount of petitioning and lobbying.

Ernst lunger, Hitler's intellectual
apologist, had a vision of "a
technological world empire" and a
"religion of anti-Christian technol
ogy." One gets at least a glimpse of
the connection between high
technology and totalitarianism in the
recent article by )an Boyer (Daily,
Feb. 15): his threatening those who
demur at taking computer science
courses with being seen as
"humanist basket cases" and lacking
in "school spirit." Where have we
seen that before. . . .
The other night somebody who re
ally knows about these things, con
ceivably the leading engineering
personality in America, told some of
us that high technology would never
be anything more than a marginal
phenomenon in our total civiliza
tion. He himself does his serious
writing with a pen because it is more
"painstaking," setting him miles
apart from the robotic mentality of
Boyer.
A brilliant student who took her
Ph.D. in electrical engineering as
well as a minor in my field found the
humanist thinking to be sophisti
cated even on narrowly intellectual
grounds. Some of us didn't need to
be told that. The basic epistemologi
cal stuff of high technology is obvi
ously at crayfish level (if that), and
dozens of imaginative cyberneticians
etc. have said just that in public. So
Boyer's recommendation to take
courses in ( omputer science for their
general interest is utterly unconvinc
ing. He seems himself to be a prime
example of what happens when the
humanities languish.

Okay, take the course anyway. It
will delight IBM, which has invested
thousands (in almost-free word
processors) in corrupting us; you
might even learn something. But
only on this condition: thatyou don't
take those dead-gutted gadgets seri
ously.

This is in reply to Rachelle Mar
shall's letter (Daily, Feb. 16), in which
she wrote "where Israeli troops have
been ordered to beat and shoot chil
dren." Rachelle, there is no such
commandment as "You shall talk
loud and tell blunt lies to defend
your point!"
I here is a limit to how much non
sense one can hear without reacting.
Remember, it's the Palestinian Liber
ation Organization which went into a
hospital and threw babies out of the
windows a few years ago, not the Is
raelis.
I know it's hard when you don't
know what you're talking about, but
try to keep the facts apart from plain
racist propaganda.

'Thinking about the homeless"

(Daily, Feb. 9), and needless to say, I
feel frustrated — does he or doesn't
he want to help people — does he or
doesn't he really want to take a look
at our world situation? I find it in
teresting that he and some other
Stanford students took the time to
travel all the way to San lose to visit
the "homeless, deprived, and
needy" and then got in their car to
return home to ponder the question
of whether or not the trip was really
worthwhile, and whether it could
help anyone.
Now, please don't misunderstand,
it seems very positive that not only
Stanford students realize what the
problems are out there but that all of
us need to become aware of what our
economic situation is really doing,
not only to the poor but also to the
needy in our great country. I for one
