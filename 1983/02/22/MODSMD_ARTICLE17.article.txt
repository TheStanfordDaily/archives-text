# Computer facility offers non-academic diversion

### LISA LYNCH Staff writer 
There is a lot you might not
know about LOTS.
In the wee wee hours of the
morning, a Stanford student
hunches over a LOTS terminal
designing an intricate com
puter program. But instead of a
plethora of BASIC or FORTRAN
the computer screen holds the
description of ... a dormitory
in Wilbur?
"You are standing outside of
a dormitory," the computer
says."I see bike racks and a
trash can. What you wanna do,
Lou ?"
The perceptive student types
"TAKE TRASH CAN" into the
terminal. He is playing RIN
CONADA, one of several
Stanford-designed computer
games that are available to
LOTS users.

Although primarily intended
as a research and learning cen
ter, LOTS has many student
designed diversions. These in
clude games that were never
intended to be anything but di
verting, as well as many pro
grams that started off with offi
cial uses and have been "mod
ified" by hackers. The mail file,
the "finger plan" program, and
the computer bulletin board all
serve dual purposes — they
allow computer science stu
dents, professors and TAs to
talk shop, but also allow LOTS
users to send each other love
letters, debate about the mor
ality of Lot in the Old Testa
ment, and spy on other unsus
pecting hackers.
Stuart Reges, assistant to the
chairman of the computer sci
ence department, said that
programs such as the finger
plan, which can tell a user
where he can find his friend or
TA when they are not at LOTS,
have been given a new per
spective by student users.
"For example, my finger
plan, in addition to telling

where someone might try to
find me, lists my New Year's
resolutions and some of my
favorite quotes," Reges said.
The finger plan of a user named
D. Denethor begins with the
phrase "A Long Time Ago In A
Galaxy Far Far Away . . and
concludes with a star-wars type
battle scene complete with
asterisk-and-question-mark
battleships.
"The finger plan program is a
basic one that was designed by
the computer company,"
Reges said. "It's interesting to
see what happens when these
programs are put into the
hands of students."
Computer mail, originally in
tended to provide interaction
between students and TAs, has
grown into an art form. Stu
dents have learned that they
can be as poetic as they wish on
the black-and-grey screen, and
that they can communicate
with other users who they
normally wouldn't see or
the black-and-gray screen, and
person. Alan Weindorf, a Lar
kin freshman in computer sci
ence, explained how he met
Terry Akana through the com
puter.
"I have an account on LOTS
A," Weindorf said, "and my
code name is F. FUR. I went to
open an account on LOTS B
with the same code name and I
found out it was already taken.
So I wrote the girl who used it a
letter asking why she was F.
FUR."

"Furry represents my rabbit,
Florence," Akana wrote back.
"I'd use 'bunny' but someone
already has it." She asked Alan
why he had chosen the name.
"My name is furry because I
am furry," Weindorf re
sponded. "Not to the extent of
Florence, mind you, but I can't
complain."
Don Porter, a Madera
freshman, estimates that he
sends mail to about 15 or 20
people, mostly in the form of
"meaningless messages."
"The computer asks you what
the subject of the letter is," he
said, "and you can type in any
thing — for example, 'The Life
style Of The Banana.' Then I'll
just send someone whatever I
can think of. I'm sending my TA
the poem "Jabberwocky"
stanza by stanza." Porter
added that he mostly sends
mail to people he has met out
side of LOTS, and that he never
gets back as many letters as he
sends.
Both Porter and Weindorf
said that in addition to the mail
file, the "finger' program al
lows users to determine
whether or not they can send
mail directly to someone at
LOTS. When a student types in
the name of someone they
want to finger, the computer
tells if they are at LOTS at that
time. If they are, using the
"send" program, any message
sent to them will interrupt their
program and flash across their
screen. "It's a great way to get
people mad at you," Weindorf
said.
A more extensive version of
the finger program is AYEWBF,
an abbreviation for "all you
ever wanted in a background
fork." The AYEWBF program is

basically a spy program; the
user lists all of the students he
would ever want to finger and
the computer automatically
checks for them everytime the
program is run. In fact, the
computer continues to search
for them the entire time the
user is at the terminal — a
"background fork" program is
one that runs continuously in
the background while the ter
minal is being used.
AYEWBF also allows the user
to set an "alarm" that flashes
across the screen at a specific
time, to lock the terminal so
that only the user's password
can open it again, and to
"stare" at specific people on
the spy list. "Staring" involves
constantly monitoring another
user and reporting what they
are doing on the computer.
"AYEWBF can be a lot of
fun," said Reges. "Unfortu
nately, since it is continuously
running, it also wastes time on
an already overloaded system.
Max Scheder/Dailv

We're thinking of discontinu
ing the program."
Other drains on LOTS that
are officially discouraged in
clude the playing of computer
games. Both Stanford
designed and nationally-used
computer games are available
for LOTS users, but there are
strict limits as to how they can
be used.
"There are three things
which limit the use of games at
LOTS," Reges said. "First of all,
no one can use the games from
dial-in terminals. We had to say
this because high school stu
dents were dialing in and play
ing games on the LOTS system.
Also, no one can play games if
there are people waiting to use
the terminals. And if the load
becomes too high, the games
are automatically shut off."
In spite of limits, game
playing at LOTS is still a popu
lar pastime. A favorite game is
called LUGI. Designed by a
Stanford student, LUGI is an
adventure game where the
player must try to escape from
the land of Lugi carrying as

much treasure as possible.
Weindorf, who plays the game
fairly often, said that a descrip
tion of one of the rooms that
players must pass through
sounds suspiciously like a de
scription of I OTS.
According to Weindorf, Rin
conada Adventure, designed
as a CS 106 final project by
Mark Moss, is somewhat frus
trating. The object of the game
is to score as many points as
possible — but there is no way
to score. The player travels
through the dorm only to find
that most of the rooms are
closed and locked. The game
is pointless," complained
Weindorf.
Reges himself is designing a
three-dimensional tic-tai - toe
game. "I've finished the
graphic, hut I haven t gotten it
perfect," he said Even though
he enjoys playing games him
self, Reges admitted that they
are a potential problem be
cause of their popularity. "This
is the sort of thing that LOTS
doesn't like to see," he admit
ted.

know about LOTS.
In the wee wee hours of the
morning, a Stanford student
hunches over a LOTS terminal
designing an intricate com
puter program. But instead of a
plethora of BASIC or FORTRAN
the computer screen holds the
description of ... a dormitory
in Wilbur?
"You are standing outside of
a dormitory," the computer
says."I see bike racks and a
trash can. What you wanna do,
Lou ?"
The perceptive student types
"TAKE TRASH CAN" into the
terminal. He is playing RIN
CONADA, one of several
Stanford-designed computer
games that are available to
LOTS users.

Although primarily intended
as a research and learning cen
ter, LOTS has many student
designed diversions. These in
clude games that were never
intended to be anything but di
verting, as well as many pro
grams that started off with offi
cial uses and have been "mod
ified" by hackers. The mail file,
the "finger plan" program, and
the computer bulletin board all
serve dual purposes — they
allow computer science stu
dents, professors and TAs to
talk shop, but also allow LOTS
users to send each other love
letters, debate about the mor
ality of Lot in the Old Testa
ment, and spy on other unsus
pecting hackers.
Stuart Reges, assistant to the
chairman of the computer sci
ence department, said that
programs such as the finger
plan, which can tell a user
where he can find his friend or
TA when they are not at LOTS,
have been given a new per
spective by student users.
"For example, my finger
plan, in addition to telling

where someone might try to
find me, lists my New Year's
resolutions and some of my
favorite quotes," Reges said.
The finger plan of a user named
D. Denethor begins with the
phrase "A Long Time Ago In A
Galaxy Far Far Away . . and
concludes with a star-wars type
battle scene complete with
asterisk-and-question-mark
battleships.
"The finger plan program is a
basic one that was designed by
the computer company,"
Reges said. "It's interesting to
see what happens when these
programs are put into the
hands of students."
Computer mail, originally in
tended to provide interaction
between students and TAs, has
grown into an art form. Stu
dents have learned that they
can be as poetic as they wish on
the black-and-grey screen, and
that they can communicate
with other users who they
normally wouldn't see or
the black-and-gray screen, and
person. Alan Weindorf, a Lar
kin freshman in computer sci
ence, explained how he met
Terry Akana through the com
puter.
"I have an account on LOTS
A," Weindorf said, "and my
code name is F. FUR. I went to
open an account on LOTS B
with the same code name and I
found out it was already taken.
So I wrote the girl who used it a
letter asking why she was F.
FUR."

"Furry represents my rabbit,
Florence," Akana wrote back.
"I'd use 'bunny' but someone
already has it." She asked Alan
why he had chosen the name.
"My name is furry because I
am furry," Weindorf re
sponded. "Not to the extent of
Florence, mind you, but I can't
complain."
Don Porter, a Madera
freshman, estimates that he
sends mail to about 15 or 20
people, mostly in the form of
"meaningless messages."
"The computer asks you what
the subject of the letter is," he
said, "and you can type in any
thing — for example, 'The Life
style Of The Banana.' Then I'll
just send someone whatever I
can think of. I'm sending my TA
the poem "Jabberwocky"
stanza by stanza." Porter
added that he mostly sends
mail to people he has met out
side of LOTS, and that he never
gets back as many letters as he
sends.
Both Porter and Weindorf
said that in addition to the mail
file, the "finger' program al
lows users to determine
whether or not they can send
mail directly to someone at
LOTS. When a student types in
the name of someone they
want to finger, the computer
tells if they are at LOTS at that
time. If they are, using the
"send" program, any message
sent to them will interrupt their
program and flash across their
screen. "It's a great way to get
people mad at you," Weindorf
said.
A more extensive version of
the finger program is AYEWBF,
an abbreviation for "all you
ever wanted in a background
fork." The AYEWBF program is

basically a spy program; the
user lists all of the students he
would ever want to finger and
the computer automatically
checks for them everytime the
program is run. In fact, the
computer continues to search
for them the entire time the
user is at the terminal — a
"background fork" program is
one that runs continuously in
the background while the ter
minal is being used.
AYEWBF also allows the user
to set an "alarm" that flashes
across the screen at a specific
time, to lock the terminal so
that only the user's password
can open it again, and to
"stare" at specific people on
the spy list. "Staring" involves
constantly monitoring another
user and reporting what they
are doing on the computer.
"AYEWBF can be a lot of
fun," said Reges. "Unfortu
nately, since it is continuously
running, it also wastes time on
an already overloaded system.
Max Scheder/Dailv

We're thinking of discontinu
ing the program."
Other drains on LOTS that
are officially discouraged in
clude the playing of computer
games. Both Stanford
designed and nationally-used
computer games are available
for LOTS users, but there are
strict limits as to how they can
be used.
"There are three things
which limit the use of games at
LOTS," Reges said. "First of all,
no one can use the games from
dial-in terminals. We had to say
this because high school stu
dents were dialing in and play
ing games on the LOTS system.
Also, no one can play games if
there are people waiting to use
the terminals. And if the load
becomes too high, the games
are automatically shut off."
In spite of limits, game
playing at LOTS is still a popu
lar pastime. A favorite game is
called LUGI. Designed by a
Stanford student, LUGI is an
adventure game where the
player must try to escape from
the land of Lugi carrying as

much treasure as possible.
Weindorf, who plays the game
fairly often, said that a descrip
tion of one of the rooms that
players must pass through
sounds suspiciously like a de
scription of I OTS.
According to Weindorf, Rin
conada Adventure, designed
as a CS 106 final project by
Mark Moss, is somewhat frus
trating. The object of the game
is to score as many points as
possible — but there is no way
to score. The player travels
through the dorm only to find
that most of the rooms are
closed and locked. The game
is pointless," complained
Weindorf.
Reges himself is designing a
three-dimensional tic-tai - toe
game. "I've finished the
graphic, hut I haven t gotten it
perfect," he said Even though
he enjoys playing games him
self, Reges admitted that they
are a potential problem be
cause of their popularity. "This
is the sort of thing that LOTS
doesn't like to see," he admit
ted.
