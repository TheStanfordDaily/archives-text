## Lantos talks at PA meeting 
### GLEN ALLERHAND 
Kcp. Torn lantos (D-San Mateo)
said Saturday he will oppose meas
ures to deny linanc i a I aid to c ollege
students who do not register tor the
craft and back legislation providing
inds tor university research and the
full spectrum of graduate and un
dergraduate education.
Lantos made his remarks in an
interview alter a standing-room-only
town meeting at the Palo Alto City
Council chambers in which he lam
basted the Reagan administration.
I he ( ongressman was most i riti< al
112 the proposed fiscal 1984 defense
budget, which the administration
h <s pegged at $238.6 billion.
Decrying "bloated, excessive,
duplicative, unreasonable defense
spending, I antos said he would vote
down funding proposals tor the MX
lissile and B-l bomber, as he did
during the last session of Congress.
He also said he would seek a sig
nificant, major, balanced, verifiable'
reduction in strategic and inter
mediate run lear weapons
()n domestic issues, Lantos said he
would push for an expansion of
bipartisan jobs legislation to help re
duce the "obscene, unacceptable"
level of unemployment.
He acknowledged that the Penin
sula was plagued by some unem
ployment, but said area residents are
ill living in an unreal world com
pared with the test of the c ountry."
For instance, I antos noted, official
i nemployment in West Virginia is at
8 percent, a figure that he said
does not inc lode 4 percent who have
given up looking for work altogether
nr'i percent who have only part-time
jobs.
On proposals to link financial aid
to draft registration, the con

gressman said â€¢ ha! it was dis
c riminatory to penalize students who
need financial assistance to pay for
schooling.
If I am a very wealthy student, I
can register at Stanford and pay my
tuition, Lantos said. "If I neeci aid, I
have to have a special qualification."
Ihe Reagan administration last
month proposed rules that would
deny direct federal aid or federally
guaranteed student loans to non
registrants.
I. antos said later that he also would
push tor the "maximum and most
generous' legislation to fund uni
versity research and education.
His comments came against the
backdrop of a declining government
commitment to subsidize such re
search.
It was in that context that Univer
sity President Donald Kennedy re
centiv urged the board of trustees to
move away from the policy of full
recovery ot indirect research costs.
Such a shift could cost the University
$20 million over the next three years.
On an issue that stirred the l most
visible audience response, Lantos
said lie would declare the adminis
tration's human-rights certification
of Fl Salvador null and void." He
said he would oppose the certifica
tion, which permits U.S. economic
aid to continue to the strife-torn
Central American country, until
there is a genuine improvement in
human rights there.
But members of the audience said
Lantos had not supported the most
stringent legislation denying aid to El
Salvador. He responded that eco
nomic assistance to Central America
is "indispensable" to the improve
ment of overall conditions in the re
gion.

Lantos also said that he did not be
lieve that all ol the terror, killing
and suffering in I I Salvador is the
result of the activities of one side
only. He said he was equally op
posed to left-wing and right-wing
cJi c tatorships.
On nuclear arms policy, the c on
gressman said European leaders are

worried about what he called the Re
agan administration's "rigid and doc
trinaire" stance Administration offi
cials, Lantos said, have not recog
nized that reducing the nuclear
menace is our number one priority
Lantos also said lie opposed Presi
dent Reagan's nomination ot Ken
neth Adelman to head the Arms C on
trol and Disarmament Agency.
"I think it is analogous with hav ing
Anne Gorsuch in charge of our Ln
vironmental Protection Agency and
lames Watt protecting our natural re
sources to have a person so pro
foundly opposed ... to nuclear dis
armament in charge ot nuclear dis
