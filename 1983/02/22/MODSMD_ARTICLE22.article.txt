## Brown nets 25 Stanford snoozes and loses to USC 
### STEVE ODELL Senior sports writer 
Los Angeles — Maybe it was
the smog, maybe it was the
water or maybe it was some
thing else, but the Stanford
basketball team came out of its
locker room following halftime

of its Pacific-10 Conference
basketball game with Southern
California Saturday night
dazed and confused.
And by the time the Cardinal
recovered, USC had reeled off
13 unanswered points to wrap
up a 90-76 win at the Sports
Arena and send Stanford reel
ing to its third straight loss.

The Cardinal, which fell be
hind early 20-9, scratched and
clawed its way back into the
game and trailed by |ust two at
halftime 38-36. But Stanford,
now 12-10 overall and 4-8 in the
conference, failed to score a
point for the first five minutes
of the second half.
Cardinal swing man Steve

Brown scored a career-high 24
points, 18 of them in the sec
ond hall to keep Stanford's def
icit respectable towards the
end. Brown, whose previous
career-high was set just last
week against Cal when he
pumped in 16 points, was
nine-of-14 from the field and
six-of-seven from the line.
Trojan forward Ron Holmes,
who had a team-high lb points,
keyed the scoring binge fol
lowing intermission with seven
of the 13 points. Holmes
moved into the starting line-up
after USC lost to Stanford a
month ago and the Trojans
have responded with five wins
in six games to put them at 14-7
overall and 8-3 in league play.
"There is no question they
are playing better now than
when we played them the first
time," Stanford coach Tom
Davis said of USC. "Part of that
is the natural progression of
the team, and part of it is that
they're healthy. I think they're
ready for a run at a post-season
tournament.
They may be as good as any
team in the league."
USC coach Stan Morrison
explained what he told his time
at halftime. "There were two
things," he said. "We said
'Work hard' and 'Make good
decisions'." We had stopped
working hard in the last two
minutes of the first half, and we
started forcing our shots.
"At the start of the second
half, we got our effort reversed
and started having good shot
selection rather than just one
pass and boom, a shot. We just
started jarring it loose."
That they did. Things started
off rather ominously for the
Cardinal in the second half
when, after Stanford in
bounded and then missed.
Holmes thundered down the
right side of the lane and threw
down a one-hand slam. It was


NOT ENOUGH OF THIS . . . Although Card
guard Sieve Brown scored a career-high 25
points Saturday night against USC, he got
little help from his friends as Stanford Ion! to

the Trojans 90-76. Brown found the range on
a variety of outside jumpers and driving lay
ins like this one over USC's Wayne Carlander
and Jacque Hill.


Greg Webb/Daily
called for a technical foul because he hung
on the rim after completing it. Steward's
teammate — freshman Gerry Wright — who
also shows a certain flare for dunking, has
bevii nicknamed "Sir Dunkalot".

. . . AND TOO MUCH OF THIS: Trojan
freshman Kevin Steward rams home one of
USC's five slam dunks in its 14-point victory
over Stanford Saturday night in Los Angeles.
On this particular reverse dunk, Steward was
indicative of the control USC
would take the rest of the way.
After a Cardinal turnover,
one of four in a row, guard |ac
que Hill led a 3-on-2 fast break,
stopped |ust inside the foul
line, turned and dished to a
trailing Cerry Wright, who
took a giant flying leap and to
mahawked home a on e -
handed stuff of his own to
bring the usually lackluster
crowd of 6427 into an uproar.
Hill hit from the top of the
key to give Southern Cal a 44- 56
lead before Stanford called a
time-out with 17:44 left.
Holmes then drove the left side
of the Stanford zone, hammer
ing into lohnny Rogers while
dropping through a driving
double-pump, left-handed
shovel shot for a three-point
play.
After Stanford was charged
with a 10-second violation for
failing to get the ball past the
halfcourt line and both sides
exchanged air balls, James
McDonald took a fast break
feed from Hill and banked in a
six-footer from the right side.
The streak was finished as
was the Cardinal after Wright
blocked an Andy Fischer shot
and Holmes followed with a
jump shot from Sunset
Boulevard to put the Trojans
comfortably ahead 51-36 with
14:55 remaining.
"It hurt us to fall behind early
in the second half," Davis said,
"especially after we had

worked so hard to climb back
in it."
Morrison employed a rela
tively new tactic for him, hav
ing USC stay in a halfcourt
zone defense almost the entire
game. "Yeah, it's the most
zone we've played this year,"
he replied when asked about
it.
"In fat t, it might be the most
zone we've played since I've
been here. It was an adaptation
of our /one — we moved it in
from the top of the key down to
the free throw line."
Davis credited the Trojans'
defensive effort. "Ihey didn't
let us do much of anything,
they were very disruptive," he
said. "I was a little surprised
that he (Morrison) played so
much zone. He's known as a
man-to-man coach.
"But we're going io be erra
tic. I don't know if it would
have made a difference
whether they played a man
to-man or a zone."
Unlike in Thursday night's
99-86 loss to UCLA, the Cardi
nal never crawled back into the
game to make it interesting,
but instead surrendered
another nine-point run to fall
behind 67-46 with 6:40 remain
ing. USC's biggest lead came
with 4:19 left after Clayton

Olivier's conversion of two
foul shots made the store
77-54.
Stanford was devastate on
the boards, where USC h- Td a
advantage. Wright led
the pummeling underneath,
nahhing 10 rebounds and
Wayne Carlander was right be
hind with eight. Ihe most any
one Cardinal player had was
four.
The Trojans also dominated
the spectacular suits, picking
up 12 steals, three blocked
shots, and five slam dunks I he
most raucous response was
elicited following a 'wo-hand
reverse slam by Kevin Steward.
Hans Wichary, who con
tinues to play well in John Re
vlli's absence at ( enter, had IH
points to give him tor the
L.A. weekend, jones, who has
stored in double figures 21 of
his last 22 games, added I 5.
Davis was pleased with the
performance of high-scorer
Brown. "He's been playing
better and better,' Davis said.
"He's really been coming on,
and we needed somebody to
come on if we were going to
salvage anything."
McDonald, one of five Tro
jans in double figures, finished
with 10 points and six steals
and was mainly tesponsible for

USC s early lead. The six-foot
tive wing man and co-captain
(lit his first four shots in provid
ing the main impetus behind
the Trojans' 1 f>-7 advantage.
Ihe Cardinal has not beaten
USC at the Sports Arena since
l l J7(> when it beat the Trojans
Bb-7S. USC leads the series
100-79 and has won ] I of the
last 15 meetings.

over Stanford Saturday night in Los Angeles.
On this particular reverse dunk, Steward was
indicative of the control USC
would take the rest of the way.
After a Cardinal turnover,
one of four in a row, guard |ac
que Hill led a 3-on-2 fast break,
stopped |ust inside the foul
line, turned and dished to a
trailing Cerry Wright, who
took a giant flying leap and to
mahawked home a on e -
handed stuff of his own to
bring the usually lackluster
crowd of 6427 into an uproar.
Hill hit from the top of the
key to give Southern Cal a 44- 56
lead before Stanford called a
time-out with 17:44 left.
Holmes then drove the left side
of the Stanford zone, hammer
ing into lohnny Rogers while
dropping through a driving
double-pump, left-handed
shovel shot for a three-point
play.
After Stanford was charged
with a 10-second violation for
failing to get the ball past the
halfcourt line and both sides
exchanged air balls, James
McDonald took a fast break
feed from Hill and banked in a
six-footer from the right side.
The streak was finished as
was the Cardinal after Wright
blocked an Andy Fischer shot
and Holmes followed with a
jump shot from Sunset
Boulevard to put the Trojans
comfortably ahead 51-36 with
14:55 remaining.
"It hurt us to fall behind early
in the second half," Davis said,
"especially after we had

worked so hard to climb back
in it."
Morrison employed a rela
tively new tactic for him, hav
ing USC stay in a halfcourt
zone defense almost the entire
game. "Yeah, it's the most
zone we've played this year,"
he replied when asked about
it.
"In fat t, it might be the most
zone we've played since I've
been here. It was an adaptation
of our /one — we moved it in
from the top of the key down to
the free throw line."
Davis credited the Trojans'
defensive effort. "Ihey didn't
let us do much of anything,
they were very disruptive," he
said. "I was a little surprised
that he (Morrison) played so
much zone. He's known as a
man-to-man coach.
"But we're going io be erra
tic. I don't know if it would
have made a difference
whether they played a man
to-man or a zone."
Unlike in Thursday night's
99-86 loss to UCLA, the Cardi
nal never crawled back into the
game to make it interesting,
but instead surrendered
another nine-point run to fall
behind 67-46 with 6:40 remain
ing. USC's biggest lead came
with 4:19 left after Clayton

Olivier's conversion of two
foul shots made the store
77-54.
Stanford was devastate on
the boards, where USC h- Td a
advantage. Wright led
the pummeling underneath,
nahhing 10 rebounds and
Wayne Carlander was right be
hind with eight. Ihe most any
one Cardinal player had was
four.
The Trojans also dominated
the spectacular suits, picking
up 12 steals, three blocked
shots, and five slam dunks I he
most raucous response was
elicited following a 'wo-hand
reverse slam by Kevin Steward.
Hans Wichary, who con
tinues to play well in John Re
vlli's absence at ( enter, had IH
points to give him tor the
L.A. weekend, jones, who has
stored in double figures 21 of
his last 22 games, added I 5.
Davis was pleased with the
performance of high-scorer
Brown. "He's been playing
better and better,' Davis said.
"He's really been coming on,
and we needed somebody to
come on if we were going to
salvage anything."
McDonald, one of five Tro
jans in double figures, finished
with 10 points and six steals
and was mainly tesponsible for

USC s early lead. The six-foot
tive wing man and co-captain
(lit his first four shots in provid
ing the main impetus behind
the Trojans' 1 f>-7 advantage.
Ihe Cardinal has not beaten
USC at the Sports Arena since
l l J7(> when it beat the Trojans
Bb-7S. USC leads the series

Los Angeles — Maybe it was
the smog, maybe it was the
water or maybe it was some
thing else, but the Stanford
basketball team came out of its
locker room following halftime

of its Pacific-10 Conference
basketball game with Southern
California Saturday night
dazed and confused.
And by the time the Cardinal
recovered, USC had reeled off
13 unanswered points to wrap
up a 90-76 win at the Sports
Arena and send Stanford reel
ing to its third straight loss.

The Cardinal, which fell be
hind early 20-9, scratched and
clawed its way back into the
game and trailed by |ust two at
halftime 38-36. But Stanford,
now 12-10 overall and 4-8 in the
conference, failed to score a
point for the first five minutes
of the second half.
Cardinal swing man Steve

Brown scored a career-high 24
points, 18 of them in the sec
ond hall to keep Stanford's def
icit respectable towards the
end. Brown, whose previous
career-high was set just last
week against Cal when he
pumped in 16 points, was
nine-of-14 from the field and
six-of-seven from the line.
Trojan forward Ron Holmes,
who had a team-high lb points,
keyed the scoring binge fol
lowing intermission with seven
of the 13 points. Holmes
moved into the starting line-up
after USC lost to Stanford a
month ago and the Trojans
have responded with five wins
in six games to put them at 14-7
overall and 8-3 in league play.
"There is no question they
are playing better now than
when we played them the first
time," Stanford coach Tom
Davis said of USC. "Part of that
is the natural progression of
the team, and part of it is that
they're healthy. I think they're
ready for a run at a post-season
tournament.
They may be as good as any
team in the league."
USC coach Stan Morrison
explained what he told his time
at halftime. "There were two
things," he said. "We said
'Work hard' and 'Make good
decisions'." We had stopped
working hard in the last two
minutes of the first half, and we
started forcing our shots.
"At the start of the second
half, we got our effort reversed
and started having good shot
selection rather than just one
pass and boom, a shot. We just
started jarring it loose."
That they did. Things started
off rather ominously for the
Cardinal in the second half
when, after Stanford in
bounded and then missed.
Holmes thundered down the
right side of the lane and threw
down a one-hand slam. It was


NOT ENOUGH OF THIS . . . Although Card
guard Sieve Brown scored a career-high 25
points Saturday night against USC, he got
little help from his friends as Stanford Ion! to

the Trojans 90-76. Brown found the range on
a variety of outside jumpers and driving lay
ins like this one over USC's Wayne Carlander
and Jacque Hill.

on the rim after completing it. Steward's
teammate — freshman Gerry Wright — who

Los Angeles — Maybe it was
the smog, maybe it was the
water or maybe it was some
thing else, but the Stanford
basketball team came out of its
locker room following halftime

of its Pacific-10 Conference
basketball game with Southern
California Saturday night
dazed and confused.
And by the time the Cardinal
recovered, USC had reeled off
13 unanswered points to wrap
up a 90-76 win at the Sports
Arena and send Stanford reel
ing to its third straight loss.

The Cardinal, which fell be
hind early 20-9, scratched and
clawed its way back into the
game and trailed by |ust two at
halftime 38-36. But Stanford,
now 12-10 overall and 4-8 in the
conference, failed to score a
point for the first five minutes
of the second half.
Cardinal swing man Steve

Brown scored a career-high 24
points, 18 of them in the sec
ond hall to keep Stanford's def
icit respectable towards the
end. Brown, whose previous
career-high was set just last
week against Cal when he
pumped in 16 points, was
nine-of-14 from the field and
six-of-seven from the line.
Trojan forward Ron Holmes,
who had a team-high lb points,
keyed the scoring binge fol
lowing intermission with seven
of the 13 points. Holmes
moved into the starting line-up
after USC lost to Stanford a
month ago and the Trojans
have responded with five wins
in six games to put them at 14-7
overall and 8-3 in league play.
"There is no question they
are playing better now than
when we played them the first
time," Stanford coach Tom
Davis said of USC. "Part of that
is the natural progression of
the team, and part of it is that
they're healthy. I think they're
ready for a run at a post-season
tournament.
They may be as good as any
team in the league."
USC coach Stan Morrison
explained what he told his time
at halftime. "There were two
things," he said. "We said
'Work hard' and 'Make good
decisions'." We had stopped
working hard in the last two
minutes of the first half, and we
started forcing our shots.
"At the start of the second
half, we got our effort reversed
and started having good shot
selection rather than just one
pass and boom, a shot. We just
started jarring it loose."
That they did. Things started
off rather ominously for the
Cardinal in the second half
when, after Stanford in
bounded and then missed.
Holmes thundered down the
right side of the lane and threw
down a one-hand slam. It was


NOT ENOUGH OF THIS . . . Although Card
guard Sieve Brown scored a career-high 25
points Saturday night against USC, he got
little help from his friends as Stanford Ion! to

the Trojans 90-76. Brown found the range on
a variety of outside jumpers and driving lay
ins like this one over USC's Wayne Carlander
and Jacque Hill.


Greg Webb/Daily
called for a technical foul because he hung
on the rim after completing it. Steward's
teammate — freshman Gerry Wright — who
also shows a certain flare for dunking, has
bevii nicknamed "Sir Dunkalot".

. . . AND TOO MUCH OF THIS: Trojan
freshman Kevin Steward rams home one of
USC's five slam dunks in its 14-point victory
over Stanford Saturday night in Los Angeles.
On this particular reverse dunk, Steward was
indicative of the control USC
would take the rest of the way.
After a Cardinal turnover,
one of four in a row, guard |ac
que Hill led a 3-on-2 fast break,
stopped |ust inside the foul
line, turned and dished to a
trailing Cerry Wright, who
took a giant flying leap and to
mahawked home a on e -
handed stuff of his own to
bring the usually lackluster
crowd of 6427 into an uproar.
Hill hit from the top of the
key to give Southern Cal a 44- 56
lead before Stanford called a
time-out with 17:44 left.
Holmes then drove the left side
of the Stanford zone, hammer
ing into lohnny Rogers while
dropping through a driving
double-pump, left-handed
shovel shot for a three-point
play.
After Stanford was charged
with a 10-second violation for
failing to get the ball past the
halfcourt line and both sides
exchanged air balls, James
McDonald took a fast break
feed from Hill and banked in a
six-footer from the right side.
The streak was finished as
was the Cardinal after Wright
blocked an Andy Fischer shot
and Holmes followed with a
jump shot from Sunset
Boulevard to put the Trojans
comfortably ahead 51-36 with
14:55 remaining.
"It hurt us to fall behind early
in the second half," Davis said,
"especially after we had

worked so hard to climb back
in it."
Morrison employed a rela
tively new tactic for him, hav
ing USC stay in a halfcourt
zone defense almost the entire
game. "Yeah, it's the most
zone we've played this year,"
he replied when asked about
it.
"In fat t, it might be the most
zone we've played since I've
been here. It was an adaptation
of our /one — we moved it in
from the top of the key down to
the free throw line."
Davis credited the Trojans'
defensive effort. "Ihey didn't
let us do much of anything,
they were very disruptive," he
said. "I was a little surprised
that he (Morrison) played so
much zone. He's known as a
man-to-man coach.
"But we're going io be erra
tic. I don't know if it would
have made a difference
whether they played a man
to-man or a zone."
Unlike in Thursday night's
99-86 loss to UCLA, the Cardi
nal never crawled back into the
game to make it interesting,
but instead surrendered
another nine-point run to fall
behind 67-46 with 6:40 remain
ing. USC's biggest lead came
with 4:19 left after Clayton

Olivier's conversion of two
foul shots made the store
77-54.
Stanford was devastate on
the boards, where USC h- Td a
advantage. Wright led
the pummeling underneath,
nahhing 10 rebounds and
Wayne Carlander was right be
hind with eight. Ihe most any
one Cardinal player had was
four.
The Trojans also dominated
the spectacular suits, picking
up 12 steals, three blocked
shots, and five slam dunks I he
most raucous response was
elicited following a 'wo-hand
reverse slam by Kevin Steward.
Hans Wichary, who con
tinues to play well in John Re
vlli's absence at ( enter, had IH
points to give him tor the
L.A. weekend, jones, who has
stored in double figures 21 of
his last 22 games, added I 5.

performance of high-scorer

"He's really been coming on,
