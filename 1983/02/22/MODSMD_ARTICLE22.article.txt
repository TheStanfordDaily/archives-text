## Brown nets 25 Stanford snoozes and loses to USC 
### STEVE ODELL Senior sports writer 
Los Angeles — Maybe it was
the smog, maybe it was the
water or maybe it was some
thing else, but the Stanford
basketball team came out of its
locker room following halftime

of its Pacific-10 Conference
basketball game with Southern
California Saturday night
dazed and confused.
And by the time the Cardinal
recovered, USC had reeled off
13 unanswered points to wrap
up a 90-76 win at the Sports
Arena and send Stanford reel
ing to its third straight loss.

The Cardinal, which fell be
hind early 20-9, scratched and
clawed its way back into the
game and trailed by |ust two at
halftime 38-36. But Stanford,
now 12-10 overall and 4-8 in the
conference, failed to score a
point for the first five minutes
of the second half.
Cardinal swing man Steve

Brown scored a career-high 24
points, 18 of them in the sec
ond hall to keep Stanford's def
icit respectable towards the
end. Brown, whose previous
career-high was set just last
week against Cal when he
pumped in 16 points, was
nine-of-14 from the field and
six-of-seven from the line.
Trojan forward Ron Holmes,
who had a team-high lb points,
keyed the scoring binge fol
lowing intermission with seven
of the 13 points. Holmes
moved into the starting line-up
after USC lost to Stanford a
month ago and the Trojans
have responded with five wins
in six games to put them at 14-7
overall and 8-3 in league play.
"There is no question they
are playing better now than
when we played them the first
time," Stanford coach Tom
Davis said of USC. "Part of that
is the natural progression of
the team, and part of it is that
they're healthy. I think they're
ready for a run at a post-season
tournament.
They may be as good as any
team in the league."
USC coach Stan Morrison
explained what he told his time
at halftime. "There were two
things," he said. "We said
'Work hard' and 'Make good
decisions'." We had stopped
working hard in the last two
minutes of the first half, and we
started forcing our shots.
"At the start of the second
half, we got our effort reversed
and started having good shot
selection rather than just one
pass and boom, a shot. We just
started jarring it loose."
That they did. Things started
off rather ominously for the
Cardinal in the second half
when, after Stanford in
bounded and then missed.
Holmes thundered down the
right side of the lane and threw
down a one-hand slam. It was


NOT ENOUGH OF THIS . . . Although Card
guard Sieve Brown scored a career-high 25
points Saturday night against USC, he got
little help from his friends as Stanford Ion! to

the Trojans 90-76. Brown found the range on
a variety of outside jumpers and driving lay
ins like this one over USC's Wayne Carlander
and Jacque Hill.

called for a technical foul because he hung
on the rim after completing it. Steward's
teammate — freshman Gerry Wright — who
also shows a certain flare for dunking, has
bevii nicknamed "Sir Dunkalot".

. . . AND TOO MUCH OF THIS: Trojan
freshman Kevin Steward rams home one of
USC's five slam dunks in its 14-point victory
over Stanford Saturday night in Los Angeles.
On this particular reverse dunk, Steward was
