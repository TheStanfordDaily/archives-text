# Card 9 wins 7th straight
## 
### ROB ZWEIG 
Using the holiday weekend to their full ad
vantage, the Stanford baseball team prepped
for the upcoming Pacific-10 season by sweep
ing lour games from non-league opponents.
Wins over the University of Pacific and Santa
Clara extended the Cardinal's winning streak
to seven.
Stanford finishes its non-league slate today
at Sunken Diamond against Fresno State, the
nation's fifth ranked club, before heading
south for a three game set with UCLA.
What had to be most comforting to Cardi
nal skipper Mark Marquess was the sparkle of
an inexperienced defense and the much
awaited arrival of his veteran pitching staff,
best illustrated by Steve Cottrell and John
Radtke's six-hit whitewash of the Santa Clara
Broncos yesterday.
The 4-0 shutout was Cottrell's second win
in three decisions although he was nicked for
just three hits in five innings, he had to share
the limelight with the Stanford defense. Mike
Aldrete returned to first base in top form with
a diving stop of a hot smash down the line in
the first inning and later a diving over-the
shoulder grab of a foul pop.
"That young man at first base is the best
first baseman in the country — bar none,"
Marquess said. "He makes those plays all of
the time and we're a little spoiled because of
it."
Vine e Sakowski and lohn Verducci added a
few dazzling plays of their own on the left
side of the infield as the Cardinal prevented a
Bronco runner from reaching second base
until the top of the seventh.
Meanwhile, Santa Clara hurler Roger
Samuels did his best to match the Stanford
pitching duo of Cottrell and Radtke. The Card
could manage only three hits through seven
innings, one of them a solo home run by

Mark Davis, and held a tenuous 1-0 lead.
But Stanford manufactured three scores
with some "Billy Ball" — a hit and run single
produced two in the seventh inning and a
suicide squeeze added an insurance run in
the eighth.
UOP learned that Stanford can hit the ball
too, as the Card swept a doubleheader 8-3
and 7-6 at Sunken Diamond Saturday after
noon and 13-1 in Stockton the next day.
Along the way "Doctor Longball" made a few
house calls as the Cardinal blasted five home
runs.
The longball fireworks may have surprised
some spec tators but not Marquess. "We'll hit
a lot of home runs this year. (Catcher Rick)
Lundblade, (Eric) Hardgrave and Aldrete can
all hit with power and I expect it to continue."
In Stockton, Hardgrave hit a solo shot
and knocked in three runs while Brian Myers
scattered seven hits in going the route to
garner his third win. Hardgrave now leads the
club with six home runs and Brian Myers
lowered his ERA to 2.25.
Lundblade hit a two-run homer off the
scoreboard in left field to give Stanford a 4-3
lead in Saturday's first game, and Hardgrave
and Aldrete followed his example with two
run blasts of their own to propel the Card to
their 8-3 win.
For the second consecutive time starter
David Harris struggled in the early going.
Cottrell came on in the third to work out of a
jam and eventually picked up the win with
three innings of relief help from Radtke.
In the nightcap, ]eff Ballard pushed his re
cord to 2-0 with five and-one-third innings of
relief as the Cardinal again had to survive
some shaky pitching early. Starter Kalauna
Park and reliever Kevin kunkel were each
touched for two runs before the second in
ning had ended.
