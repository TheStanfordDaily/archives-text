# Men swimmers blast No. 3 Cal
## No doubt about it: Card No. 1 
### SHAILENDRA BHUMRALKAR 
The Stanford men's swim
team finished its undefeated
dual meet season Saturday at
Berkeley defeating the Cal
Bears by a surprisingly easy
margin of 67-46.
The Cardinal thereby cap
tured the No. 1 ranking in the
nation heading into the
Pacific-10 and NCAA Champi
onships.
Before the meet, head coach
Skip Kenney had pegged the
400 medley relay a crucial race.
And even though Cal was able
to win the relay, Stanford kept
its composure and was able to
regroup.
In the 1650 freestyle, Stan
ford's Bari VVeick set a pool re
cord of 15:14.97 while Dave
Sims finished second in
15:29.82. Cal swept the 200
freestyle, with standout Paolo
Revelli setting a new pool re
cord of 1:37.68.
In the important 200 but
terfly, lon Denney edged out
Revelli in 1:47.96. "The 200 but
terfly might have been the
turning point," kenney said.
"They had a chance to win that
event — Revelli was having a
great meet, he's a champion —
we figured he was the one to
beat."
Swimmer Dave Bottom
called Denney's win "the men
tal blow that put Cal out of the
meet."
Cal swept the 100 freestyle as
well with Bengt Baron winning
in 44.85. But Stanford recipro
cated by sweeping the 200
backstroke, Bottom winning in
1:50.33.
Weick won the 500 freestyle
in 4:25.31 and Sims finished
second in 4:27.24.
Stanford swept the 200
breaststroke, too. John Moffet
won in 2:02.84, John Simons
was second in 2:04.52 and John
Walton placed third in 2:06.22.
Cal won the 400 freestyle relay,
h tit v isn't enough
As expected, Stanford swept
both diving events. Thor
Johnson, Tom Rothenbucher
and Mike Leahey placed 1-2-3
on both boards.
"We came so close to win
ning it (NCAA Championship)
last vear," Weick said. "The
difference between this team
and last year's is incredible.
We're right on line in prepar
ing for the NCAAs."
Kenney was naturally happv
about the victorv. but he con

tinues to plan for the team's
central goaj of winning the na
tional title. "We are looking at
the Pac- 10s as a dress rehearsal
for NCAAs," he said.
Though Stanford won easily,

Kenney still respects Cal's abil
ity. "I thought Cal was going to
be the team to beat in the
NCAAs and I still think so," he
prophesized. "Texas has a
good team and there are some

other good ones, but I don't
know if they have the depth."
