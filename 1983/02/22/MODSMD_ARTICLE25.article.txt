## Turning the tide on Cal 
### 
Berkeley — The best swimming team in the
nation and a busload of vocal compatriots
waded into the not-so-friendly tontines ot
Spieker Aquatics Complex Saturday.
Neither team had to remind the other that
Stanford was No. I and Cal was right behind
at No. 3.
Stanford was huddling into chalk talks as
early as Wednesday practice. Spectators had
stuffed themselves into every nook and
cranny of the claustrophobic pool area and
others peered over the plywood fence that
ringed the sparkling blue water. The public
address system replayed radio's final eight
seconds of the most recent Cal-Stanford
football game, and teams and their tans
helped each other rattle off cheers before the
first ripple in the water was made.

The Sporting ill use

Stan ford divers Thor Johnson, Tom
Rothenbucker and Mike Leahey opened the
meet in the one-meter competition and were
in the problematic position of having to
sweep both diving events to record even a
marginal effort for them.
They were supposed to be that dominant.
They were.
The opening swimming event — the med
ley relay — was the meet's main focus.
"We thought the medley relay was going to
be the key all week," said Stanford coach
Skip Kenney.
The race was to tell Stanford a lot. If Stan
ford could win, it would be in a good position
to dominate the meet. If the Cardinal lost, Cal
was going to fight for the win.
The Cal team of David Wilson, Rickie Gill,
Bengt Baron and Dave Boatwright won that
race — barely — by beating Stanford on the
starts and turns.
To say the race was close and the teams
were using up much of their strength just
exhorting the racers, is to not understand the
gravity of the race in Stanford's eyes.
"After Cal won the relay," said Dave Bot
tom, who swam the opening leg for Stanford,
"we saw Cal was up and we were really
scared."
Cal was indeed up and showed no inten
tions of letting the Cardinal swim away with
the meet. Following the 400 individual med
ley in which Todd Lincoln and John Simons
finished one-two to pul Stanford bark in
front at 28-24, Kenney called his team inside
for a conference while lohnson, Rothen
bucker and Leahey took to the three-meter
board and increased Stanford's lead.
Simons figured leading by example might
not be enough.
"During the second diving break, the team
went inside and |ohn Simons and Skip (Ken
nedy) got up and said some things," Bottom
said. "They just told us that it was all on the
line. It was very inspiring — we came out of
the locker room fired up."
"I just told them that the first half of the

meet was just like nationals in Milwaukee Lisl
year (where the Cardinal lost a tight battle tor
first place)," Simons said later. We | ust had
to suck it up and take advantage when the
opportunity presented itself."
John Denney saw that lirst opportunity and
sucked it up to squash any Cal hopes for a
comeback. Denny was matched with Cal's
key hope — Paolo Revelli — in the 200 but
terfly.
The spirited Stanford bench rattled off a
series of cheers that bordered on Gregorian
c hants while Denny churned to a convincing
win over Revelli.
"I think the 200 butterfly might have been
the turning point," kenney said. "They had a
good chance to win that event. Revelli w>b
having a great meet — he's a champion —we
thought he was the one to beat in the 200
butterfly."
Bottom said, "|on Denney has been real
fast lately, but so has Revelli. When he
(Denney) beat him in the 200 butterfly and
beat him handily, I think that was the mental
blow that put Cal out of the meet."
Denny's win gave Stanford a 14-point lead
that was shaved to seven after Baron and
Boatwright swept the 100 freestyle, but Stan
ford soon clinched the meet.
Bottom led Stanford's awesome
backstroke crew to a 1-2-3 finish in the 200
backstroke and Bari Weick took his second
first of the meet — winning the 500 freestyle
four seconds ahead of teammate David Sims
and a whopping eight seconds ahead of a
weary Revelli.
"I'm so pleased the way the guys came
back after the medley relay," Kenney said
"It's easy to get down in that situation, hut
these guys have a lot of character.
Stanford's leader Simons said he was
happy with the way his team responded to his
exhortations for a 67-46 win, but refused to
take the credit.
"Every time we talk, someone stands up
and says something," Simons said. "Today it
happened to me. The key to the meet was
that we went out and hammered it home and
realized how good we are."
Stanford's huddle was lost in celebration
during the final relay — showing theii up
preciation to the busload of Stanford stu
dents who made the trip north. Swimmers
poss'blv handle crowd support better th'«i
an> athlete, ihey lead > Peers ..,;d ii,
cheers, but swimming is a strange spoit
There is nothing in sport quite as refresh
ing as having the diving coaches from the two
teams judge the diving competition. The ra
tionale, I suppose, is that if the bias can't be
hidden it will all even out in the end. It's as
pure a situation as a call-your-own lines game
of tennis or a call-your-own fouls game ol
basketball.
Fven more interesting was when Kennev
turned to his celebrating team and said
"Maybe you should thank your fans."
No Skip, thank you.
