## Not even Rowland's self-importance dampens Dexy's 
### JIM MOONEY 
I suppose that it's a little odd
to begin a concert review by
talking about the encore, but
in the case of last Friday's per
formance by Dexy's Midnight
Runners at the sold out Kabuki
Nightclub their cover of the
Otis Redding-penned "Re
spect" summed up the entire
evening. As Dexy's frontman
Kevin Rowland sang "I'm tired
of begging for respect," he
brought into the forefront the
problem he and his band have
encountered at the hands of
American radio and critics.
A little background informa
tion will be necessary before
we go on. Kevin Rowland grew
up in Birmingham, England,
worshipping the English soul

music of the middle '60s, par
ticularly that of a soul artist
named Geno Washington. The
band's name is derived from
the slang term for the type of
amphetamines favored by the
soul contingent of that era.
Rowland and Dexy's have en
joyed huge success in England
with two albums and numer
ous hit singles to their credit.
Each LP has explored a
different soukvein. Their first,
Scorching for the Young Soul
Rebels, was primarily horn
heavy soul, almost in the clas
sic Motown sense. The latest,
released in the U.S. in Decem
ber, entitled Too-Rye-Ay, finds
Dexy's across the Irish Sea in
the Ireland that was such an
important part of the early

works of Van Morrison.
This LP has brought the band
some American success with
the brilliant pop tune "Come
on Eileen." (If you still haven't
managed to catch this song,
tune into any Top 40 station. It
gets played every half-hour or
so.) Unfortunately, the Ameri
can music critics appear to
have taken an almost con
spiratorial dislike to the band.
So, armed with all that won
derful information, back we go
to our original purpose — a re
view of the show. The evening
had not gotten off to the most
auspicious of starts, and the
opening act did nothing to
brighten the situation. One of
the last things I would expect
to see on stage at a club like the

Kabuki is a ukelele, and so, a
one man-one ukelele warmup
just didn't do mu< h for me. The
guy's name was ( armaig de
Forest, and I'd have to say that
he had a lot of guts.
About 45 minutes after Car
maig had been dutifully si
lenced, Dexy's appeared. The
band on this tour was nearly
identical to the one featured
on Too-Rye Ay. This in itself is
something of an achievement
for Rowland. Bee ause (lis ego is
said to be about the size of a
football stadium, his bands
seem to go through constant
turnover. Dexy's has been
through so many personnel
changes in the past that n often
resembles a halfway house for
wayward musicians.

The current incarnation con
sists of 10 members, including
three violinists — more appro
priately fiddlers — and two
horn players. The lac k ot elec
tric guitars and synthesizer
equipment allowed the music
to move from slow ballads,
sue h as the opener "Old," and
"All in All" (both from Too-
Rye-Ay), to incendiary soul
numbers like Rowland's tri
bute to his idol, "Geno," while
maintaining a genuine acoustic
tone.
Unfortunately, what Dexy's
achieved in establishing an in
timate feel to their music was
somewhat undermined by the
omnipresent ego of Kevin Row
land. He often showed an utter
inability, or even unwilling

ness, to establish any rapport
with the audience. The tight
ness of the set did not allow
time for any interaction be
tween performer and audi
ence, and in some ways spon
taneity suffered because of
this precision. Of course, the
fact that Rowland sang por
tions of many songs to the
walls did not help matters. De
spite all that, the music, par
ticularly the fiddling ot Ftelen
O'Hara, transcended most of
Rowland's egomania.
In the 16-ish (I lost count in
the middle) song set, Dexy's
managed to play a well
balanced selection from each
of their two LPs. The high
points, for me c ame toward the
middle as they played the c las

sics "Seven Days Too Long,"
Van Morrison's "Jackie Wilson
Said (I'm in Heaven when you
smile)," and a fabulously rauc
ous version of their original
I ell Me When the I ight Turns
C Irepn
Beyond Rowland's prob
lems with critics, audiences,
and respect is the fact that the
man writes great music. Re
gardless of his posturing and
preening, the show was fun,
vibrant, and I felt better com
ing out than when I went in.
Kevin Rowland may have his
personality quirks, but I hope
he get > a little of the respect he
deserves, bee ause he is a gifted
songwriter and vocalist front
ing a very talented group of
musicians.

we go on. Kevin Rowland grew
up in Birmingham, England,
worshipping the English soul

music of the middle '60s, par
ticularly that of a soul artist
named Geno Washington. The
band's name is derived from
the slang term for the type of
amphetamines favored by the
soul contingent of that era.
Rowland and Dexy's have en
joyed huge success in England
with two albums and numer
ous hit singles to their credit.
Each LP has explored a
different soukvein. Their first,
Scorching for the Young Soul
Rebels, was primarily horn
heavy soul, almost in the clas
sic Motown sense. The latest,
released in the U.S. in Decem
ber, entitled Too-Rye-Ay, finds
Dexy's across the Irish Sea in
the Ireland that was such an
important part of the early

works of Van Morrison.
This LP has brought the band
some American success with
the brilliant pop tune "Come
on Eileen." (If you still haven't
managed to catch this song,
tune into any Top 40 station. It
gets played every half-hour or
so.) Unfortunately, the Ameri
can music critics appear to
have taken an almost con
spiratorial dislike to the band.
So, armed with all that won
derful information, back we go
to our original purpose — a re
view of the show. The evening
had not gotten off to the most
auspicious of starts, and the
opening act did nothing to
brighten the situation. One of
the last things I would expect
to see on stage at a club like the

Kabuki is a ukelele, and so, a
one man-one ukelele warmup
just didn't do mu< h for me. The
guy's name was ( armaig de
Forest, and I'd have to say that
he had a lot of guts.
About 45 minutes after Car
maig had been dutifully si
lenced, Dexy's appeared. The
band on this tour was nearly
identical to the one featured
on Too-Rye Ay. This in itself is
something of an achievement
for Rowland. Bee ause (lis ego is
said to be about the size of a
football stadium, his bands
seem to go through constant
turnover. Dexy's has been
through so many personnel
changes in the past that n often
resembles a halfway house for
wayward musicians.

The current incarnation con
sists of 10 members, including
three violinists — more appro
priately fiddlers — and two
horn players. The lac k ot elec
tric guitars and synthesizer
equipment allowed the music
to move from slow ballads,
sue h as the opener "Old," and
"All in All" (both from Too-
Rye-Ay), to incendiary soul
numbers like Rowland's tri
bute to his idol, "Geno," while
maintaining a genuine acoustic
tone.
Unfortunately, what Dexy's
achieved in establishing an in
timate feel to their music was
somewhat undermined by the
omnipresent ego of Kevin Row
land. He often showed an utter
inability, or even unwilling

ness, to establish any rapport
with the audience. The tight
ness of the set did not allow
time for any interaction be
tween performer and audi
ence, and in some ways spon
taneity suffered because of
this precision. Of course, the
fact that Rowland sang por
tions of many songs to the
walls did not help matters. De
spite all that, the music, par
ticularly the fiddling ot Ftelen
O'Hara, transcended most of
Rowland's egomania.
In the 16-ish (I lost count in
the middle) song set, Dexy's
managed to play a well
balanced selection from each
of their two LPs. The high
points, for me c ame toward the
middle as they played the c las

sics "Seven Days Too Long,"
Van Morrison's "Jackie Wilson
Said (I'm in Heaven when you
smile)," and a fabulously rauc
ous version of their original
I ell Me When the I ight Turns
C Irepn
Beyond Rowland's prob
lems with critics, audiences,
and respect is the fact that the
man writes great music. Re
gardless of his posturing and
preening, the show was fun,
vibrant, and I felt better com
ing out than when I went in.
Kevin Rowland may have his
personality quirks, but I hope
he get > a little of the respect he
deserves, bee ause he is a gifted
songwriter and vocalist front
ing a very talented group of
musicians.
I suppose that it's a little odd
to begin a concert review by
talking about the encore, but
in the case of last Friday's per
formance by Dexy's Midnight
Runners at the sold out Kabuki
Nightclub their cover of the
Otis Redding-penned "Re
spect" summed up the entire
evening. As Dexy's frontman
Kevin Rowland sang "I'm tired
of begging for respect," he
brought into the forefront the
problem he and his band have
encountered at the hands of
American radio and critics.
