# Shepard's family runs amuck again in traditional way
## 
### MIKE HALE 
Sam Shepard's plays undoubtedly
have the best names around. The
Tooth of Crime, Curse of the Starv
ing Class, and Buried Child are titles
people who know nothing else
about Shepard remember. They're
also early warning signs of what
people like to call Shepard's "theat
ricality," that is, the sense you have
at his plays of having stumbled into
an exciting, otherworldly cir< us.
Fool for Love, which is having its
world premiere at San Francisco's
Magic Theatre under the author's
direction, has the catchy title and the
now familiar Shepard-gothic feel,
and it is exciting — in fact, it's mostly
mesmerizing — but your exhilara
tion when it's over is tempered more
than a little by what appears to be
needless confusion.

Fool for Love probably belongs
with Curse, Buried Child and True
West in the Shepard canon. It's
another "family" play, and it has
something resembling a traditional
plot — at least we think we possess
more facts about the characters at
the end of the play then we did al the
beginning. But while it extends the
ground rules established in recent
Shepard plays, it also begins to
break them up. Curse and Buried
Child have their mysteries, but the
general situations in which those are
played out are defined early on. Fool
for I ove is nothing but a mystery, or
several mysteries, which we watch
unwind to tenative, glimpsed solu
tions. And Fool for Love's set (de
signed by Andy Stacklin) lacks the
piles of junk, American culture's de
tritus, that cover the sets of so many

Shepard plays — it's a barren motel
room, with bed, table, chairs and
nothing else (although disorder can
be glimpsed through a bath room
door), reminiscent of the bare stage
in Mad Dog Blues which was alter
nately New York, a Caribbean island
and the Mexican border.
The characters in Fool for Love
tend to make up their own scenery,
too. The play opens with a standard
Shepard silence — May (Kathy
Baker) sits on the bed with her head
in her hands, while Eddie (Eel Harris)
stares at her and punches a pommel.
Eddie, who acts like a cowboy but
appears to be a truck driver, has just
come back to May after what might
have been an affair with a woman
May calls the Countess. Eddie never
quite denies any of this. Later on
much more fundamental questions
arise, but their answers don't come
any clearer than these do. I don't
think Shepard is wilfully obscure —
the point is that the stories these
characters make up about each
other are generally more important
to them, and to us, than anything
that really took place — except at the
end of the play, when we reach a
grand denouement where what's
important is precisely the ditference
between a character's illusions

about the past and what actually
happened. Here, I think, Shepard's
imagination failed him the tiniest bit
not only is it unclear to us what
did happen, but more important, it's
un< lear what effect lost illusions are
having on the characters involved.
In the meantime, though, this
premiere production of Fool for
I ove is entrancing, and probably the
most alive piece of theater around. A
lot of this has to do with Ed Harris.
The par' of Eddie seems to have
been (in fact may well have been)
written for Harris, who appears with
Shepard in the movie version of The
Right Stuff. Harris has an authentic
swagger, and a mad gleam in his eye,
that are perfect for Eddie, who, like
many another Shepard male, is on
the edge of something. Harris, al
ternately bullying and childlike,
does eftortlesly what Shepard al
ways requires: he acts slightly crazy
on stage, and makes it believable
without support trom the script like
normal, c oncerned relatives, or doc
tors in white smocks.
kathy Baker has a harder time of it
her motives (actually her emo
tions) are a little murky, and she has
to spend a lot of her time making
terrible faces to suggest anguish.
She seemed a little stiff and over

serious through much of the night
but she has undeniable presence
and at play's end, when things get
somber, she was appropriately
larger-than-life.
There are two other characters: an
old man who sits on the apron just to
the side of the stage, watching the
action and swigging lack Daniels,
and Martin, a rather befuddled gar
dener who shows up to take May to a
movie. Dennis I udlovv (who played
Tilden in the magic s world premiere
of Buried Child) is very appealing as
Martin, a salt-of-the-earth type who
can't quite deal with Eddie. Ludlow
is as proficient at playing dumb as
Harris is at playing crazy. Will Mar
chetti (the father in the premiere of
Curse of the Starving Class) doesn't
have much to do.
Shepard the director keeps things
moving, although sometimes things
get a little more frenzied than they
have reason to. Shepard the writer is
occasionally at his best — while
there aren't really the showpiece
monologues he often employs, he
manages to work quite a bit of his
mad poetry into the dialogue. And
there are several moments, involv
ing lights (designc ci by Kurt Landis
man) and sound (J. A. Deane) that are
thrilling, particularly an explosion

and fire that lake place offstage and
are reflected in the motel room win
dow where Martin stands and si
lently watches — a moment that
feels like it should he in a play by
O'Neill.
Critics will have a field day dissect
ing Fool for Love along the lines of
life vs. art, illusion facing reality. I
think it's a mistake to apply these
categories in a dry way to Shepard's
plays, although Shepard himself
may be making the mistake this time
— the cues in Fool for Love are pretty
strong, especially the way the old
man sits and watt ties the play as if it
were coming across on his TV set.
But Fool for Love is finally successtul
because, like Shepard's best plays, it
is both life and art, or at least exists
halfway in between.
The play's meaning, if it has one,
might be sought in those titles I
mentioned. The Curse of the Striv
ing Class, the Buried Child, and the
Frue West are all things characters
invoke which may or may not really
at least in the form the charac
ters think they do. At the end of Fool
for Love the old man tells Eddie
there's something he's always tried
not lo be — he doesn t know what it
is, but we know that it's a "tool for
love."
