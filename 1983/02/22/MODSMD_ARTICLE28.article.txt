# 'Amadeus': Wood looms large over everything
## 
### TONY KELLY 
The problem with watching John Wood perform in
Amadous is that there are always these other people
lianging around onstage.
Now one could say that these folks have just as much a
right to be running around the Golden Gate Theatre as
Wood they're performers, too, y'know, and they have
a right to earn a living and some of them have names like
Mark Hamill and are famous and/or talented in their
own right — but watching this show, you can't help but
get the feeling that you are at this theatre to see JOHN
WOOD and JOHN WOOD only and that the other per
sonages trampling the floorboards are either stagehands
in funny getups or mobile pieces of furniture or (more
likely) out-of-work performers getting by on the good
graces of their patron, slumming along in the lead role of
a mere Tony Award-winning show's road company. Sort
of a traveling halfway house for wayward actors.
The reason for this admittedly unfair, but unshakable
assumption is John Wood himself. Now you may not
have heard much of the man; he's not a Big Star in the
sense that millions can instantly identify him and buy
miles of beachfront property in Utah on his say-so. But
he is a Broadway star, and one of the highest magnitudes.
He created the part of Guildenstern in Tom Stoppard's
Kosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead a while back,
and those types of roles are his specialty — large roles,
primarily, brimming with words and meant to be sung,
really, rather than spoken. More than a few critics writ
ing about Amadeus have referred to Wood's treatment
of the lines as being more closely related to a baritone
singing an aria than an actor playing a part, and the re
mark certainly holds true; Wood has such control of his
voice that it is not the play itself that matters very much,
or the words, but the abstract sounds involved in making
those words.
Which says quite a bit about John Wood as an artist,
and perhaps a lot more about Amadeus Ideally, Wood
could make his living in the solo-performer genre of
theatre, along with Hal Holbrook, Alec McCowen and
his reading of The Gospel According to St. Mark, and a
host of lesser talents. Hell, this guy could read the phone
book aloud at a bus station and there would be lines
around the block to see him.
Instead, Wood does a curious thing — he keeps work
ing in conventional, multi-character theatre, yet the type
of work he does is very much in the solo-performer
mode. In Amadeus, Wood is at his best as a performer;
he struts, mugs, and intones his way across the stage, pro
pelling the show forward by the sheer force of his voice
and mannerisms. Simply put, he is a joy to watch. But at
the same time, we are watching the single-handed de
struction of everything outside of John Wood in
\madeus; his force as Salieri pro Dels, yet also mercilessly
overruns the other actors and Peter Shaffer's script.
Of course, the script doesn't offer much in its own de
fense. It's a fairly ridiculous exercise in God-baiting,
Tony Award or r.o Tony Award — much like Shaffer's
Equus The settings and relationships are quite different
(contemporary England and 18th century France, a psy
chiatrist and his patient and Salieri and Wolfgang
Amadeus Mozart), but the conventions are the same: an
unwitting and inarticulate childlike antagonist, a hero

wrestling with the Big Issues of contemporary society
(which bear a startling resemblance to the Big Issues of
every society, and don't think that's a coincidence), and
an underlying presumption that everyone but the main
two characters are evil, selfish, hypocritical and worst of
all, uninteresting — especially the women.
In Shaffer's corrupt world, it's the latter crime that is
the most damning. Antonio Salieri, played by Wood, is
just as much of a snake as the lords he cannot stand, but
we are intended to sympathize with him because really,
way down deep, he does love music, as if art heals all
wounds. More likely, the audience is captivated by him
because he is better copy, dashing off lines like "Of what
use is man but to teach God his lessons" off the top of his
head like a latter-day patron saint of bon mots.
This style of writing, where the incredible literacy of
one man carries the play, couldn't be better designed to
fit an actor like John Wood. But remember, thisain't Par
adise Lost here, and Salieri's dark intimations of doom
come off more like the nightly Creature Feature on
Channel 13 than a summing up of man's inferiority to
pure genius.
As a result, one may end up wanting to give Wood free
reign over the text, to let him do as he wishes and hope
that somehow something more than just the text will be
conveyed. At least, that's what seems to be the case here;
director Peter Hall has given Wood a huge amount of
space onstage (along with everyone else — this is one of
the more spread-out shows I can remember seeing) in
order to facilitate his damn-the-torpedoes style of act
ing.
But when one attempts this kind of warfare, you're
bound to end up with a lot of victims. John Wood is noth
ing less than fascinating to watch in this environment; in
fact, I can hardly imagine seeing him in a show without
this omnipresent a lead character. If I did, I might be
more inclined to punch him out than applaud his over
powering voice and presence.
An example of what can happen in a show designed in
this manner is present in Mark. Hamill, who plays Mozart
in this production. Shaffer's Mozart is already a fright
fully stale part; foul-mouthed, bratty and whiny, it has
more of a junior-high giggly precociousness to it than a
feeling of refreshing humanity. Even so, one can under
stand Hamill's desire to play the part, to undermine his
Luke Skywalker image and throw in a chance to share a
stage with JOHN WOOD to boot.
Unfortunately, Hamill is inexperienced enough, and
Wood selfish enough, that the flaws in the character im
mediately become the flaws of Hamill, magnified so that
every rough edge looms large next to Wood's calculated
smoothness. It is not that Hamill is necessarily bad; in
fact, the worst I can say of him is that he didn't really reg
ister as a believable character. That's more than I can say
for the entire rest of the cast members who never had a
single solid chance between them to make any im
pressions a' all. The problem is really in both Hamill and
Wood — or.e didn't have much to work with and made it
look like even less, and the other either didn't notice,
didn't care, or actively contributed to the former's
downfall. Both disagreeable characteristics, to be sure,
but when one of those traits makes you a Broadway star,
folks don't tend to notice as much.
