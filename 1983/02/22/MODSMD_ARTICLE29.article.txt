# You'd have to be blind to miss point of 'Cyclops'
## 
### TOM GARRETT 
Cyclops/Nobody's Musical, as one
might guess, revolves around the
mythical one-eyed Cyclops and his en
counter with the Greek hero Odysseus.
Immortalized in Homer's Odyssey, the
original story was later dramatized by
Euripides in his satyr play Cyclops from
which the musical takes its plotline,
characters and much of its tone.
In graduate student Rush Rehm's
adaptation, which opened last week
and continues this weekend at the Little
Theatre, the director/author turns the
satyr play into an extremely worthwhile
Broadway-style musical. Certainly, it's
not the wonder of drama it could have
been, but the outstanding set, acting,
choreography, costumes and dancing
almost completely compensate for the
serious flaws in Rehm's script.
A drama like Cyclops which is based
on mythology and fantasy presents its
actors with potentially insurmountable
problems in playing the characters.
How can any normal human act the part
of a huge, towering, thundering mons
ter who can swallow whole sheep? No
one can, of course, but as Cyclops
Andre Braugher comes as close as pos

sible, I think. He is an honest monster
who sees the truth and is not afraid to
speak it. He encapsulates the whole
theme of the original Euripidean play
when, pointing at the "civilized"
Creeks, he looks at his primitive,
hedonistic satyrs and says "You are not
better than they."
As Odysseus, Marc Accornero is also
excellent. A deceptive man, dishonest
and petty, but with a thick veneer of
pride in his civilization, Odysseus func
tions as an effective mirror of his soci
ety.
Anthony Haney's Silenus, however,
steals the show. Every moment he is
onstage the audience is captivated by
his antics. By singing "Eating Man" and
"Making Love to the Wine" he is per
sonally responsible for two of the best
three scenes in the musical.
The other superlative scene is "The
Female Persuasion," a recital of sins of
the female gender, danced by Glenn
Goodson. The dancing and choreog
raphy, like the acting, is well done
throughout the play. But here it is espe
cially magnificent; Cyclops/Nobody's
Musical is worth seeing for this dance
scene alone.

The set and costumes are also excep
tional, the set (by john Rathman) espe
cially so as it dominates the Little
Theatre and brings the audience into
the play. Unfortunately, the singing
abilities of the cast are generally not on
a par with the dancing and acting, but
this is not as disturbing to the audience
as the script.
Perhaps one reason why drama is so
difficult to write is that a script that is
generally very good can quickly be ren
dered bad by only a few mistakes. As an
author, Rush Rehm makes several siu h
mistakes.
First, he overuses the concept of
Dionysus as the patron of the satyrs.
The audience is left feeling that roughly
every tenth word in the show is
"Dionysus;" thus, any point there may
have been about "Dionysus kills" or
"Dionysus is the god within us" is lost
Another flaw in the script is thfe song
"Prayer to the Night." T his scene in par
ticular seemed to be added solely to
lengthen the show. "Prayer to the
Night" is sung by Odysseus in order to
express his hopes that the gods of
darkness and revenge will help him. It
expands further the audience's knowl

edge of Odysseus as an unsavory
< harac ter, but it doesn't fit well with the
tone of the rest of the musical.
later in the plav, Rehm inserts a
scene in Cyclops that both overkills a
concept and seems to serve no pur
pose. I his is a dance scene done while
( yclops is being blinded. In the scene
Silenus dreams that a group of women
spurn him and then beat him up. Ihe
play has already (humorously) pointed
out the disadvantage of women in "The
Female Persuasion;" this new scene
seems more like blatant misogyny.
Finally, Rehm insults the intelligence
of the audience in the finale, where Ihe
entire ( ast breaks character and comes
onstage to sing the themes of the play
to the audience (war is terrible, let's all
work together to stop killing, etc.) The
result is an uncomfortable hybrid of
Eurpides and Brecht that takes the point
of the musical and hurls it point-blank
into the face of the audience.
As a whole, however, Cyclops/
Nobody's Musical is very rewarding.
The cast is outstanding and the script,
while seriously flawed, certainly has its
moments of glory. It is a production
worth seeing.
