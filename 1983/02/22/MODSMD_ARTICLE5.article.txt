# Lower inflation to help hospital project
## 
### HILLARY EARNEST 
A lower predic ted rate ot inflation may speed
up completion ot the first phase of the Stanford
Hospital Modernization r«>|• t iHMP), although
the cost ot initial work to he done on the $100
million project has bet n reduced by almost $25
million.
"If the inflation rate goes up again, we will be
able to exert ise sonn i utbac k options, but as of
now we hope to do more earlier than we had
originally anticipated said I Ivia Garwood, proj
ect direc tor.
I he original plan for new construction and re
modeling was revised in Dec ember to take into
account uncertain future reimbursement levels
and a changing economic climate. These
changes would extend the time for completion
of some parts of die projec I, but would preserve
the HMP objectives, according to Garwood.
However, it the* inflation rate does not increase
significantly, less of the project will have to be
deterred
Garwood said that plans for construction,
which should begin in April, include a new addi
tion near the north end of the present hospital
which would be devoted entirely to direct pa
tient t are I arlier plans had i ailed for three struc

tural elements with part of each devoted to ad
ministrative and support activities.
The plans for a new wing for diagnostic and
treatment services was also reduced. Eighteen
new operating rooms will be constructed instead
of the original 22.
The project focuses more on modernization
than expansion of services with only six new
beds added to the total t urrent bed capacity of
66 5.
112 inancing for the project will come from a tax
exempt bond, hospital reserves and a fund
raising drive, according to Dan Heath, associate
director of finance at the hospital.
Eundraising for the project has not yet begun,
said John Ford, director of medical develop
ment. He said that the hospital has already col
lected less than $50,000 in gifts for the project but
that solicitation of the targeted $15 million in gilts
will not begin until mid-March.
Approximately $17 million has been built up
over the past several years tor the HMP as part of
the capital reserve budget, according to Heath.
That money, combined with funds which will
accumulate until the project s completion, will
constitute a projected $M) million or about one

third of the project's total cost.
The remaining *55 million will be borrowed.
"From a patient s perspective it may not seem
fail that today's patient is essentially paying tor
tomorrow s building, but any well-managed
hospital v- II always be considering the replace
ment ot equipment and buildings which will
have to occur over the long run " Heath said. "It
we (an't persuade someone to donate the funds
for the projec t, the modernization still has to be
done and the money must then < ome indirectly
from the p itienls."
"It's alv\ iys prudent to put some money aside
year after \ear as a safety measure and in antic i
pation of the need to replace equipment and
buildings Garwood said.
"At this stage we are putting together docu
ments for the April Hospital Board nf Directors
meeting Garwood said. Garwood said that at
that meeting she will submit revised cost esti
mates, a final schematic drawing, an update on
timetables for the project and a confirmation on
the size ot the project for approval by the board
Garwood said that the receipt of a Medi-Cal
contract which ensures state reimbursement for
treatment of Medi-C al patients has no direct et
ten t on (undine for the HMIV
