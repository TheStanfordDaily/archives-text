Keohane, kevnoting a scholarly
conference on communities of
women" here on Sund.iv, told a
mostly female audience that she telt
there are still definite advantages to
single-sex education.
"Women still do not ha\e equal
rights Keohane said There are
still advantages to a women's col
lege; an opportunity lor running
one's own life, leadership training,
an assurance that women will he

taken seriously, and the opportunity
to torm close bonds of friendship."
Keohane also said there was a
lack of hassle" when no men were
around â€” women conversed and
behaved more freely
Of course, there are still prob
lems problems with social life, de
pression, problems with eating dis
orders, she said, "but in pursuing
education there is still room for
separatism we are tar from the clay
when single-sex education is un
nec essa ry."
Keohane said that women's col
leges were ,m example ot one of
three basii types of women's com
munities; community by attrition.

ATTtNTIVI LISTENE R: (Manner! Keohane, former political science pro
fessor here, sits amongst a predon iantly female audience, listening to
one of her colleagues speak on the values of women's communities.
Keohane later addressed the group as well.
community by imitation and com
munity by consent. Community by
attrition, perhaps the oldest form of
women's community, exists when
women and men are segregated ac
cording to the code of a male
dominated society.
"There is actually a good deal of
autonomy in these communities,"
Keohane said, citing the example of
segregated Bedouin women. "By be
coming completely separate, these
women develop a sense of intimacy
and informality. The presence of
males is regarded as an intrusion."
Community by imitation, accord
ing to Keohane, is a result of an at

tempt to offer women "separate but
equal" facilities; for example, con
vents, women's prisons and wom
en's colleges.
The third type of women's com
munity, community by consent, is
the one most frequently found in to
day's society. "These can be every
thing from quilting bees to lesbian
communities," Keohane said, ad
ding that these communities were
difficult to study and define. "There
is no distinction between radical and
traditional in communities by con
sent," she said.
Women's communities, according
to Keohane, were important because
they illustrated that women were
capable of forming bonds. "Aristotle
felt that women were incapable of
human friendship," Keohane said.
Referring to Wellesley, she added, "I
bring you evidence of a community
of women."
