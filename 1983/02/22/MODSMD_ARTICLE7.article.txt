Oil producers caii meeting
C airo, Igvpt Saudi Arabia and other Per
sian Gulf Arab oil producers have called an
emergt ic meeting for today to consider low
ering their oil prices amid reports that the re
duction mav lie more than previously expected
following Nigeria's unilateral $5.50-a-barrel cut
over the weekend.
Some analysts were predicting that the gulf
producers would match or even exceed the Ni
gerian reduction, and a Saudi newspaper said
that the cut might reach as much as $7 a barrel to
keep the gulf states' oil competitive in the
glutted world it arket. 112 arlier, many analysts in
cluding sources close to the gulf producers had

antic ipated price reductions of $2-$4
A price cut by Saudi Arabia, the world's larg
est oil exporter, and its allies almost certainly
would lead to similar reductions by most pro
ducers who have not already lowered prices
There was still no clear indication how the
gulf states or the Organization of Petroleum Ex
porting Countries as a whole intended to try to
prevent an all-out price war. Algeria endorsed
previous calls by Iran and Libya for an OPEC
meeting to discuss how to prop up prices, but
there was no sign yesterday that a meeting )f
the cartel was imminent.
Oil ministers of the six members of the Gulf
Cooperation Council were scheduled to meet

capital of Riyadh to discuss "cur

of the Mg' in price cut and reductions Friday
