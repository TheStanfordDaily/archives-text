Oil producers caii meeting
C airo, Igvpt Saudi Arabia and other Per
sian Gulf Arab oil producers have called an
emergt ic meeting for today to consider low
ering their oil prices amid reports that the re
duction mav lie more than previously expected
following Nigeria's unilateral $5.50-a-barrel cut
over the weekend.
Some analysts were predicting that the gulf
producers would match or even exceed the Ni
gerian reduction, and a Saudi newspaper said
that the cut might reach as much as $7 a barrel to
keep the gulf states' oil competitive in the
glutted world it arket. 112 arlier, many analysts in
cluding sources close to the gulf producers had

antic ipated price reductions of $2-$4
A price cut by Saudi Arabia, the world's larg
est oil exporter, and its allies almost certainly
would lead to similar reductions by most pro
ducers who have not already lowered prices
There was still no clear indication how the
gulf states or the Organization of Petroleum Ex
porting Countries as a whole intended to try to
prevent an all-out price war. Algeria endorsed
previous calls by Iran and Libya for an OPEC
meeting to discuss how to prop up prices, but
there was no sign yesterday that a meeting )f
the cartel was imminent.

Mondale announces candidacy
St. Paul, Minnesota-Former Vice President Walter
Mondale, using the rhetoric of liberalism tempered
with time, officially launched his presidential can
didacy here yesterday by declaring, "I'm ready to be
president."
Mondale, who learned politics from the late
Hubert Humphrey, served as Democratic state at
torney general and U.S. senator from Minnesota and
later was Jimmy Carter's vice president, announced
his candidacy from the ornate House chamber of the
Minnesota state capitol building.
He then took his large traveling party to the Iron
Range of northern Minnesota to hear firsthand of the
economic suffering that exists in America today and
to attack the administration of President Reagan.
"At the very core of my being and at the center of
my campaign and at the center of my administration is
going to be a philosophy that is entirely different from
the one that's causing you to suffer," he told a town
meeting in Virginia, Minnesota. "I don't believe
America was meant to be a jungle where we have sur
vival of the fittest or survival of the richest."
Later, pledging to restore the economic might of a
region with an official unemployment rate around 30
percent and pockets ranging up to 80 percent, Mon
dale said, "Some people say we can't do it. But this is
the nation that rebuilt Europe. Ours is the nation that
rebuilt japan. And today, I think the time has come to
rebuild the United States of America."
Mondale became the third official candidate for
the 1984 Democratic nomination and polls give him a
clear lead over his likely competitors. And with a Jan
uary Gallup poll giving him a 12-point lead in a head
to-head matchup with President Reagan, he begins
his campaign with considerable self-confidence.
Calling himself his principal competition, Mondale
said in a recent interview, "I'm not worried about the
other candidates, so long as I do my job well. I think
Americans are looking to see who will make the best
candidate, who makes the most sense, who shows the
capacity and experience needed for leadership. If I'm
able to demonstrate that, I believe I'm going to be
nominated and elected."
Mondale said the advantage of being the front
runner is the ability to be heard as he begins to define
himself, and yesterday, before roughly 300 friends
and contributors from across the country, including
Humphrey's widow Muriel who has since remarried,
he began that process.
PLO opposes Reagan's proposal
Algiers, Algeria — Palestine Liberation Organiza
tion leaders dealing with the sensitive issue of Presi
dent Reagan's Middle East peace initiative said yester
day that it was unacceptable, but they stopped short
of outright rejection.
The Palestinian stance on the Reagan plan, which
calls for Palestinian self-government in association
with Jordan on the West Bank and in the Gaza Strip,
was determined behind closed doors in a meeting of
the Palestine National Council's political committee.
The council, PLO's parliament in exile, has been
meeting for the last eight days to set policy for the
guerrilla movement.
The move not to reject the Reagan plan outright
was a victory for PLO leader Yasser Arafat, who
fended off a week of stormy criticism of the plan by
the radical factions in his organization to ram through
the more moderate line.
Specifically, Arafat was trying to make sure that the
word "reject" was not used in the resolution.
Arafat's strategy has been to avoid outright rejec
tion and to keep the wording of the resolution vague,

allowing him room to maneuver as he explores vari
ous formulas for a resolution of the continuing Mid
east crisis.
The announcement of the political committee's de
cision on the Reagan plan came yesterday afternoon,
a full day before a vote by the entire Palestine Na
tional Council (PNC) on its future political direction.
Observers here said that council adoption of the
committee's resolution, probably today, is a certainty.
The public release of the resolution yesterday was
taken as an indication of the confidence Arafat now
has in his ability to control the council and have any
measure he wants passed.
Ahmed Abdul Rahman, the council's official
spokesman, said the "Reagan plan does not satisfy the
inalienable national rights of the Palestinian people,
as it denies them the right of self-determination and
the establishment of an independent Palestinian state
in Palestine.
"The Reagan plan does not recognize the PLO as
the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian
people. This Reagan plan, which is in contradiction of
international legality is not acceptable by the Palesti
nian council as a sound basis for a just solution to the
Palestinian problem and the Arab-Israeli conflict."
However, when Rahman was asked specifically if
the wording of the statement meant that the U.S. plan
was rejected outright, he said, "The PNC does not re
ject the Reagan plan," he said. "It is insufficient."
Chinese leader to visit japan
Peking — China, visibly disappointed over signs
that Washington is pulling back from closer ties,
launched a broad offensive Sunday to woo U.S. ally
Japan into a new strategic relationship.
Communist party chief Hu Yao Bang disclosed ac
ceptance of an invitation to Tokyo from Japan's new
prime minister, although he set no dates. It will bethe
first visit by paramount leader Deng Xiaoping's
chosen successor to a major capitalist country.
The high-profile warming up came just two days af
ter Secretary of State George Shultz, discussing his
first visit to Peking three years ago, called for a "rea
sonable relationship." He avoided the phrase
"strategic relationship" which had been used by his
predecessors in the four years since normalization.
The occasion for China's predictable countermove
was the mission to Peking of Special Envoy Susumu
Nikkaido, a senior Japanese political leader and
former cabinent minister. Officially, Nikkaido was
here to report on behalf of Prime Minister Yasuhiro
Nakasone on Nakosone's recent summit talks in
Washington and Seoul. Unofficially, it appeared that
two close neighbors having problems of their own
with the United States were moving to mend their
strategic fences.
Significantly, Nakasone acted to assuage the Chi
nese on the eve of Nikkaido's visit by conceding to
parliament that japan was indeed guilty of aggression.
No Japanese prime minister has publicly made such a
concession, People's Daily commented in an editorial
published yesterday. This, the newspaper said, "will
be of positive significance for the development of
friendly relations between Japan and China and other
Asian and Pacific nations."
Massacre in India takes 1400 lives
New Delhi, India — Prime Minister Indira Gandhi
paid a six-hour visit to Assam yesterday and briefly re
lived with dazed survivors the eastern Indian state's
19-day-old holocaust of slaughter, estimated to have
taken up to 1400 lives.
During her absence, Parliament was locked in an
gry debate over the controversial election she or
dered in Assam and the bloodbath that ensued.
An opposition speaker, former Railway Minister

Madhu Dandavate, accused the 65-year-old prime
minister of using "Hitlerite tactics" to impose "a live
election over dead bodies" in Assam. Government
members charged opposition parties indirectly sup
ported the violence.
Voting that began Feb. 14 in the multi-stage state
election ended yesterday, and counting began with
Gandhi's Congress Party winning 23 of the first 26
races decided in the balloting for 126 state assembly
seats. Her party was assured of victory because of a
low turnout resulting from the violence and a boycott
declared by the Assamese Movement and major op
position parties.
Gandhi called the elections in January after the col
lapse of negotiations with student leaders of the pre
dominantly Hindu Assamese Movement, which is de
manding that hundreds of thousands of Bengali
speaking natives and emigrants from neighboring
Bangladesh, most of them Moslems be removed from
the voting lists. The movement wants them expelled
from Assam.
Libyan threat reduced
Washington — The threat from Libya's troop
buildup on its border with Sudan has receded, says
Secretary of State George Shultz, who claims a quick
U.S. response put Lib yan leader Moammar Khadafy
"back in his box."
Shultz, appearing on ABC's "This Week With David
Brinkley," said President Reagan acted "quickly and
decisively" to protect Sudan from Libya by moving
U.S. radar planes near Egypt because of concerns
about the Libyan troop buildup.
"I don't want to go into all of the ins and outs of it,
but I think the net of the whole thing is that the presi
dent of the United States acted quickly and decisively
and effectively and at least for the moment Khadafy is
back in his box where he belongs," Shultz said.
Sen. Henry jackson (D-Wash.) said the U.S. Air
borne Warning and Control System planes will most
likely leave the area within day.
"I expect that the AW ACS planes will be out tomor
row or today, certainly before tomorrow, unless .. .
there are new developments in the area," said Jack
son, a member of the Senate Armed Services Commit
tee, appearing on CBS's "Face the Nation."
The Libyan government denied any such troop or
plane movement.
Americans look for POWs in Laos
Bangkok, Thailand — Retired Green Beret Lt. Col.
James "Bo" Gritz has told the Los Angeles Times that
he is deep in the Laotian jungle on a new mission to
rescue American prisoners of war. He said that he has
come up with "some POW ID" but that he cannot
confirm its authenticity.
Meanwhile, two Americans reportedly on a POW
rescue mission mounted by Gritz face trial Feb. 28 on
a charge of possessing illegal communications equip
ment.
In a handwritten message from across the Mekong
River, Gritz said that another of his Laotian guerrillas
has been killed — the second in as many missions. But
he insisted that he will press his search for U.S. pris
oners from the Vietnam War until he can tell the na
tion whether any Americans are being held in Laos.
"If Americans are here," he wrote, "by God, let's
find out."
Gritz, 44, a Vietnam veteran from Westchester, Cali
fornia, disclosed his whereabouts in a 12-page letter
dated Feb. 12 that was brought from Laos by runner. It
arrived last week and was hand-delivered to The
Times on Saturday by a Gritz associate. The letter was
signed by Gritz and the two other Americans who are
with him in Laos.

One is David Weekly, 35, of Encinitas, California, a
Vietnam War-era Navy airman. The other is Gary
Goldman, 38, of Encino, California, described by
friends as a soldier of fortune trained in anti-terrorism
techniques.
Protests planned for Queen's visit
San Francisco — Uneasy city officials are bracing for
a series of protests on March 3, when President Rea
gan plays host to Queen Elizabeth II at a state dinner
here in the Golden Gate Park De Young Museum.
They expect up to 20,000 protesters to gather on a
large grassy field within 600 yards of the museum.
The March Third Coalition, comprising more than
50 organizations ranging from the Alice B. Toklas Gay
Democratic Club to the Young Socialist Alliance,
plans a rally to assert a wide assortment of political
and social causes.
Similarly, the newly formed Irish Republican Com
mittee is staging several events to urge the British to
leave Northern Ireland.
The Irish committee, a coalition of gro ups support
ing the reunification of Northern Ireland with the
Irish Republic, expects support from union members
and this city's many residents of Irish ancestry. The
committee plans to set up a "soup kitchen" to feed up
to 5000 people in front of City Hall and to join with the
March Third Coalition in a parade to the museum.
John Maher, the Irish committee's leader, says rep
resentatives of the Irish Republican Army will also be
present to condemn the British government for its
continued military presence in Northern Ireland, for
years torn by religious strife. Britain characterizes its
role there as filling a security need; the IRA calls it co
lonialism.
"There are so many people promising to come
demonstrate, we may have to rent Utah," Maher said.
Although most San Francisco protests have been
peaceful, haunting memories linger, especially of the
afternoon in 1975 when a woman named Sara Jane
Moore emerged from a crowd of onlookers outside
the St. Francis Hotel to take an unsuccessful shot at
President Gerald Ford.
Wallace hospitalized
Montgomery, Alabama — Gov. George Wallace,
hospitalized yesterday complaining of stomach pains,
probably will remain there most of the week, an aide
said.
Press secretary Billy Joe Camp said Wallace's ap
pointments were canceled through tomorrow and he
was expected to remain hospitalized "probably the
majority of the week."
Wallace, 63, was admitted to Jackson Hospital short
ly after midnight complaining of stomach pains.
Dr. Hamilton Hutchinson said Wallace was suffer
ing from a stubborn intestinal virus, but his condition
was not believed serious.
Preliminary tests showed Wallace has "a slight in
flammation to the left colon area," but further tests
were scheduled to make sure there is no intestinal
blockage, Camp said.
A hospital spokeswoman said Wallace was under
going "a standard battery of tests."
Doctors hope they will be able to treat Wallace with
medication, Camp said.

Mondale announces candidacy
St. Paul, Minnesota-Former Vice President Walter
Mondale, using the rhetoric of liberalism tempered
with time, officially launched his presidential can
didacy here yesterday by declaring, "I'm ready to be
president."
Mondale, who learned politics from the late
Hubert Humphrey, served as Democratic state at
torney general and U.S. senator from Minnesota and
later was Jimmy Carter's vice president, announced
his candidacy from the ornate House chamber of the
Minnesota state capitol building.
He then took his large traveling party to the Iron
Range of northern Minnesota to hear firsthand of the
economic suffering that exists in America today and
to attack the administration of President Reagan.
"At the very core of my being and at the center of
my campaign and at the center of my administration is
going to be a philosophy that is entirely different from
the one that's causing you to suffer," he told a town
meeting in Virginia, Minnesota. "I don't believe
America was meant to be a jungle where we have sur
vival of the fittest or survival of the richest."
Later, pledging to restore the economic might of a
region with an official unemployment rate around 30
percent and pockets ranging up to 80 percent, Mon
dale said, "Some people say we can't do it. But this is
the nation that rebuilt Europe. Ours is the nation that
rebuilt japan. And today, I think the time has come to
rebuild the United States of America."
Mondale became the third official candidate for
the 1984 Democratic nomination and polls give him a
clear lead over his likely competitors. And with a Jan
uary Gallup poll giving him a 12-point lead in a head
to-head matchup with President Reagan, he begins
his campaign with considerable self-confidence.
Calling himself his principal competition, Mondale
said in a recent interview, "I'm not worried about the
other candidates, so long as I do my job well. I think
Americans are looking to see who will make the best
candidate, who makes the most sense, who shows the
capacity and experience needed for leadership. If I'm
able to demonstrate that, I believe I'm going to be
nominated and elected."
Mondale said the advantage of being the front
runner is the ability to be heard as he begins to define
himself, and yesterday, before roughly 300 friends
and contributors from across the country, including
Humphrey's widow Muriel who has since remarried,
he began that process.
PLO opposes Reagan's proposal
Algiers, Algeria — Palestine Liberation Organiza
tion leaders dealing with the sensitive issue of Presi
dent Reagan's Middle East peace initiative said yester
day that it was unacceptable, but they stopped short
of outright rejection.
The Palestinian stance on the Reagan plan, which
calls for Palestinian self-government in association
with Jordan on the West Bank and in the Gaza Strip,
was determined behind closed doors in a meeting of
the Palestine National Council's political committee.
The council, PLO's parliament in exile, has been
meeting for the last eight days to set policy for the
guerrilla movement.
The move not to reject the Reagan plan outright
was a victory for PLO leader Yasser Arafat, who
fended off a week of stormy criticism of the plan by
the radical factions in his organization to ram through
the more moderate line.
Specifically, Arafat was trying to make sure that the
word "reject" was not used in the resolution.
Arafat's strategy has been to avoid outright rejec
tion and to keep the wording of the resolution vague,

allowing him room to maneuver as he explores vari
ous formulas for a resolution of the continuing Mid
east crisis.
The announcement of the political committee's de
cision on the Reagan plan came yesterday afternoon,
a full day before a vote by the entire Palestine Na
tional Council (PNC) on its future political direction.
Observers here said that council adoption of the
committee's resolution, probably today, is a certainty.
The public release of the resolution yesterday was
taken as an indication of the confidence Arafat now
has in his ability to control the council and have any
measure he wants passed.
Ahmed Abdul Rahman, the council's official
spokesman, said the "Reagan plan does not satisfy the
inalienable national rights of the Palestinian people,
as it denies them the right of self-determination and
the establishment of an independent Palestinian state
in Palestine.
"The Reagan plan does not recognize the PLO as
the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian
people. This Reagan plan, which is in contradiction of
international legality is not acceptable by the Palesti
nian council as a sound basis for a just solution to the
Palestinian problem and the Arab-Israeli conflict."
However, when Rahman was asked specifically if
the wording of the statement meant that the U.S. plan
was rejected outright, he said, "The PNC does not re
ject the Reagan plan," he said. "It is insufficient."
Chinese leader to visit japan
Peking — China, visibly disappointed over signs
that Washington is pulling back from closer ties,
launched a broad offensive Sunday to woo U.S. ally
Japan into a new strategic relationship.
Communist party chief Hu Yao Bang disclosed ac
ceptance of an invitation to Tokyo from Japan's new
prime minister, although he set no dates. It will bethe
first visit by paramount leader Deng Xiaoping's
chosen successor to a major capitalist country.
The high-profile warming up came just two days af
ter Secretary of State George Shultz, discussing his
first visit to Peking three years ago, called for a "rea
sonable relationship." He avoided the phrase
"strategic relationship" which had been used by his
predecessors in the four years since normalization.
The occasion for China's predictable countermove
was the mission to Peking of Special Envoy Susumu
Nikkaido, a senior Japanese political leader and
former cabinent minister. Officially, Nikkaido was
here to report on behalf of Prime Minister Yasuhiro
Nakasone on Nakosone's recent summit talks in
Washington and Seoul. Unofficially, it appeared that
two close neighbors having problems of their own
with the United States were moving to mend their
strategic fences.
Significantly, Nakasone acted to assuage the Chi
nese on the eve of Nikkaido's visit by conceding to
parliament that japan was indeed guilty of aggression.
No Japanese prime minister has publicly made such a
concession, People's Daily commented in an editorial
published yesterday. This, the newspaper said, "will
be of positive significance for the development of
friendly relations between Japan and China and other
Asian and Pacific nations."
Massacre in India takes 1400 lives
New Delhi, India — Prime Minister Indira Gandhi
paid a six-hour visit to Assam yesterday and briefly re
lived with dazed survivors the eastern Indian state's
19-day-old holocaust of slaughter, estimated to have
taken up to 1400 lives.
During her absence, Parliament was locked in an
gry debate over the controversial election she or
dered in Assam and the bloodbath that ensued.
An opposition speaker, former Railway Minister

Madhu Dandavate, accused the 65-year-old prime
minister of using "Hitlerite tactics" to impose "a live
election over dead bodies" in Assam. Government
members charged opposition parties indirectly sup
ported the violence.
Voting that began Feb. 14 in the multi-stage state
election ended yesterday, and counting began with
Gandhi's Congress Party winning 23 of the first 26
races decided in the balloting for 126 state assembly
seats. Her party was assured of victory because of a
low turnout resulting from the violence and a boycott
declared by the Assamese Movement and major op
position parties.
Gandhi called the elections in January after the col
lapse of negotiations with student leaders of the pre
dominantly Hindu Assamese Movement, which is de
manding that hundreds of thousands of Bengali
speaking natives and emigrants from neighboring
Bangladesh, most of them Moslems be removed from
the voting lists. The movement wants them expelled
from Assam.
Libyan threat reduced
Washington — The threat from Libya's troop
buildup on its border with Sudan has receded, says
Secretary of State George Shultz, who claims a quick
U.S. response put Lib yan leader Moammar Khadafy
"back in his box."
Shultz, appearing on ABC's "This Week With David
Brinkley," said President Reagan acted "quickly and
decisively" to protect Sudan from Libya by moving
U.S. radar planes near Egypt because of concerns
about the Libyan troop buildup.
"I don't want to go into all of the ins and outs of it,
but I think the net of the whole thing is that the presi
dent of the United States acted quickly and decisively
and effectively and at least for the moment Khadafy is
back in his box where he belongs," Shultz said.
Sen. Henry jackson (D-Wash.) said the U.S. Air
borne Warning and Control System planes will most
likely leave the area within day.
"I expect that the AW ACS planes will be out tomor
row or today, certainly before tomorrow, unless .. .
there are new developments in the area," said Jack
son, a member of the Senate Armed Services Commit
tee, appearing on CBS's "Face the Nation."
The Libyan government denied any such troop or
plane movement.
Americans look for POWs in Laos
Bangkok, Thailand — Retired Green Beret Lt. Col.
James "Bo" Gritz has told the Los Angeles Times that
he is deep in the Laotian jungle on a new mission to
rescue American prisoners of war. He said that he has
come up with "some POW ID" but that he cannot
confirm its authenticity.
Meanwhile, two Americans reportedly on a POW
rescue mission mounted by Gritz face trial Feb. 28 on
a charge of possessing illegal communications equip
ment.
In a handwritten message from across the Mekong
River, Gritz said that another of his Laotian guerrillas
has been killed — the second in as many missions. But
he insisted that he will press his search for U.S. pris
oners from the Vietnam War until he can tell the na
tion whether any Americans are being held in Laos.
"If Americans are here," he wrote, "by God, let's
find out."
Gritz, 44, a Vietnam veteran from Westchester, Cali
fornia, disclosed his whereabouts in a 12-page letter
dated Feb. 12 that was brought from Laos by runner. It
arrived last week and was hand-delivered to The
Times on Saturday by a Gritz associate. The letter was
signed by Gritz and the two other Americans who are
with him in Laos.

One is David Weekly, 35, of Encinitas, California, a
Vietnam War-era Navy airman. The other is Gary
Goldman, 38, of Encino, California, described by
friends as a soldier of fortune trained in anti-terrorism
techniques.
Protests planned for Queen's visit
San Francisco — Uneasy city officials are bracing for
a series of protests on March 3, when President Rea
gan plays host to Queen Elizabeth II at a state dinner
here in the Golden Gate Park De Young Museum.
They expect up to 20,000 protesters to gather on a
large grassy field within 600 yards of the museum.
The March Third Coalition, comprising more than
50 organizations ranging from the Alice B. Toklas Gay
Democratic Club to the Young Socialist Alliance,
plans a rally to assert a wide assortment of political
and social causes.
Similarly, the newly formed Irish Republican Com
mittee is staging several events to urge the British to
leave Northern Ireland.
The Irish committee, a coalition of gro ups support
ing the reunification of Northern Ireland with the
Irish Republic, expects support from union members
and this city's many residents of Irish ancestry. The
committee plans to set up a "soup kitchen" to feed up
to 5000 people in front of City Hall and to join with the
March Third Coalition in a parade to the museum.
John Maher, the Irish committee's leader, says rep
resentatives of the Irish Republican Army will also be
present to condemn the British government for its
continued military presence in Northern Ireland, for
years torn by religious strife. Britain characterizes its
role there as filling a security need; the IRA calls it co
lonialism.
"There are so many people promising to come
demonstrate, we may have to rent Utah," Maher said.
Although most San Francisco protests have been
peaceful, haunting memories linger, especially of the
afternoon in 1975 when a woman named Sara Jane
Moore emerged from a crowd of onlookers outside
the St. Francis Hotel to take an unsuccessful shot at
President Gerald Ford.
Wallace hospitalized
Montgomery, Alabama — Gov. George Wallace,
hospitalized yesterday complaining of stomach pains,
probably will remain there most of the week, an aide
said.
Press secretary Billy Joe Camp said Wallace's ap
pointments were canceled through tomorrow and he
was expected to remain hospitalized "probably the
majority of the week."
Wallace, 63, was admitted to Jackson Hospital short
ly after midnight complaining of stomach pains.
Dr. Hamilton Hutchinson said Wallace was suffer
ing from a stubborn intestinal virus, but his condition
was not believed serious.
Preliminary tests showed Wallace has "a slight in
flammation to the left colon area," but further tests
were scheduled to make sure there is no intestinal
blockage, Camp said.
A hospital spokeswoman said Wallace was under
going "a standard battery of tests."
Doctors hope they will be able to treat Wallace with
medication, Camp said.

Oil producers caii meeting
C airo, Igvpt Saudi Arabia and other Per

emergt ic meeting for today to consider low
ering their oil prices amid reports that the re

following Nigeria's unilateral $5.50-a-barrel cut
over the weekend.
Some analysts were predicting that the gulf

later was Jimmy Carter's vice president, announced
his candidacy from the ornate House chamber of the
Minnesota state capitol building.
He then took his large traveling party to the Iron
Range of northern Minnesota to hear firsthand of the
economic suffering that exists in America today and
to attack the administration of President Reagan.
"At the very core of my being and at the center of
my campaign and at the center of my administration is
going to be a philosophy that is entirely different from
the one that's causing you to suffer," he told a town
meeting in Virginia, Minnesota. "I don't believe
America was meant to be a jungle where we have sur
vival of the fittest or survival of the richest."
Later, pledging to restore the economic might of a
region with an official unemployment rate around 30
percent and pockets ranging up to 80 percent, Mon
dale said, "Some people say we can't do it. But this is
the nation that rebuilt Europe. Ours is the nation that
rebuilt japan. And today, I think the time has come to
rebuild the United States of America."
Mondale became the third official candidate for
the 1984 Democratic nomination and polls give him a
clear lead over his likely competitors. And with a Jan
uary Gallup poll giving him a 12-point lead in a head
to-head matchup with President Reagan, he begins
his campaign with considerable self-confidence.
Calling himself his principal competition, Mondale
said in a recent interview, "I'm not worried about the
other candidates, so long as I do my job well. I think
Americans are looking to see who will make the best
candidate, who makes the most sense, who shows the
capacity and experience needed for leadership. If I'm
able to demonstrate that, I believe I'm going to be
nominated and elected."
Mondale said the advantage of being the front
runner is the ability to be heard as he begins to define
himself, and yesterday, before roughly 300 friends
and contributors from across the country, including
Humphrey's widow Muriel who has since remarried,
he began that process.
PLO opposes Reagan's proposal
Algiers, Algeria — Palestine Liberation Organiza
tion leaders dealing with the sensitive issue of Presi
dent Reagan's Middle East peace initiative said yester
day that it was unacceptable, but they stopped short
of outright rejection.
The Palestinian stance on the Reagan plan, which
calls for Palestinian self-government in association
with Jordan on the West Bank and in the Gaza Strip,
was determined behind closed doors in a meeting of
the Palestine National Council's political committee.
The council, PLO's parliament in exile, has been
meeting for the last eight days to set policy for the
guerrilla movement.
The move not to reject the Reagan plan outright
was a victory for PLO leader Yasser Arafat, who
fended off a week of stormy criticism of the plan by
the radical factions in his organization to ram through
the more moderate line.
Specifically, Arafat was trying to make sure that the
word "reject" was not used in the resolution.
Arafat's strategy has been to avoid outright rejec
tion and to keep the wording of the resolution vague,

allowing him room to maneuver as he explores vari
ous formulas for a resolution of the continuing Mid
east crisis.
The announcement of the political committee's de
cision on the Reagan plan came yesterday afternoon,
a full day before a vote by the entire Palestine Na
tional Council (PNC) on its future political direction.
Observers here said that council adoption of the
committee's resolution, probably today, is a certainty.
The public release of the resolution yesterday was
taken as an indication of the confidence Arafat now
has in his ability to control the council and have any
measure he wants passed.
Ahmed Abdul Rahman, the council's official
spokesman, said the "Reagan plan does not satisfy the
inalienable national rights of the Palestinian people,
as it denies them the right of self-determination and
the establishment of an independent Palestinian state
in Palestine.
"The Reagan plan does not recognize the PLO as
the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian
people. This Reagan plan, which is in contradiction of
international legality is not acceptable by the Palesti
nian council as a sound basis for a just solution to the
Palestinian problem and the Arab-Israeli conflict."
However, when Rahman was asked specifically if
the wording of the statement meant that the U.S. plan
was rejected outright, he said, "The PNC does not re
ject the Reagan plan," he said. "It is insufficient."
Chinese leader to visit japan
Peking — China, visibly disappointed over signs
that Washington is pulling back from closer ties,
launched a broad offensive Sunday to woo U.S. ally
Japan into a new strategic relationship.
Communist party chief Hu Yao Bang disclosed ac
ceptance of an invitation to Tokyo from Japan's new
prime minister, although he set no dates. It will bethe
first visit by paramount leader Deng Xiaoping's
chosen successor to a major capitalist country.
The high-profile warming up came just two days af
ter Secretary of State George Shultz, discussing his
first visit to Peking three years ago, called for a "rea
sonable relationship." He avoided the phrase
"strategic relationship" which had been used by his
predecessors in the four years since normalization.
The occasion for China's predictable countermove
was the mission to Peking of Special Envoy Susumu
Nikkaido, a senior Japanese political leader and
former cabinent minister. Officially, Nikkaido was
here to report on behalf of Prime Minister Yasuhiro
Nakasone on Nakosone's recent summit talks in
Washington and Seoul. Unofficially, it appeared that
two close neighbors having problems of their own
with the United States were moving to mend their
strategic fences.
Significantly, Nakasone acted to assuage the Chi
nese on the eve of Nikkaido's visit by conceding to
parliament that japan was indeed guilty of aggression.
No Japanese prime minister has publicly made such a
concession, People's Daily commented in an editorial
published yesterday. This, the newspaper said, "will
be of positive significance for the development of
friendly relations between Japan and China and other
Asian and Pacific nations."
Massacre in India takes 1400 lives
New Delhi, India — Prime Minister Indira Gandhi
paid a six-hour visit to Assam yesterday and briefly re
lived with dazed survivors the eastern Indian state's
19-day-old holocaust of slaughter, estimated to have
taken up to 1400 lives.
During her absence, Parliament was locked in an
gry debate over the controversial election she or
dered in Assam and the bloodbath that ensued.
An opposition speaker, former Railway Minister

Madhu Dandavate, accused the 65-year-old prime
minister of using "Hitlerite tactics" to impose "a live
election over dead bodies" in Assam. Government
members charged opposition parties indirectly sup
ported the violence.
Voting that began Feb. 14 in the multi-stage state
election ended yesterday, and counting began with
Gandhi's Congress Party winning 23 of the first 26
races decided in the balloting for 126 state assembly
seats. Her party was assured of victory because of a
low turnout resulting from the violence and a boycott
declared by the Assamese Movement and major op
position parties.
Gandhi called the elections in January after the col
lapse of negotiations with student leaders of the pre
dominantly Hindu Assamese Movement, which is de
manding that hundreds of thousands of Bengali
speaking natives and emigrants from neighboring
Bangladesh, most of them Moslems be removed from
the voting lists. The movement wants them expelled
from Assam.
Libyan threat reduced
Washington — The threat from Libya's troop
buildup on its border with Sudan has receded, says
Secretary of State George Shultz, who claims a quick
U.S. response put Lib yan leader Moammar Khadafy
"back in his box."
Shultz, appearing on ABC's "This Week With David
Brinkley," said President Reagan acted "quickly and
decisively" to protect Sudan from Libya by moving
U.S. radar planes near Egypt because of concerns
about the Libyan troop buildup.
"I don't want to go into all of the ins and outs of it,
but I think the net of the whole thing is that the presi
dent of the United States acted quickly and decisively
and effectively and at least for the moment Khadafy is
back in his box where he belongs," Shultz said.
Sen. Henry jackson (D-Wash.) said the U.S. Air
borne Warning and Control System planes will most
likely leave the area within day.
"I expect that the AW ACS planes will be out tomor
row or today, certainly before tomorrow, unless .. .
there are new developments in the area," said Jack
son, a member of the Senate Armed Services Commit
tee, appearing on CBS's "Face the Nation."
The Libyan government denied any such troop or
plane movement.
Americans look for POWs in Laos
Bangkok, Thailand — Retired Green Beret Lt. Col.
James "Bo" Gritz has told the Los Angeles Times that
he is deep in the Laotian jungle on a new mission to
rescue American prisoners of war. He said that he has
come up with "some POW ID" but that he cannot
confirm its authenticity.
Meanwhile, two Americans reportedly on a POW
rescue mission mounted by Gritz face trial Feb. 28 on
a charge of possessing illegal communications equip
ment.
In a handwritten message from across the Mekong
River, Gritz said that another of his Laotian guerrillas
has been killed — the second in as many missions. But
he insisted that he will press his search for U.S. pris
oners from the Vietnam War until he can tell the na
tion whether any Americans are being held in Laos.
"If Americans are here," he wrote, "by God, let's
find out."
Gritz, 44, a Vietnam veteran from Westchester, Cali
fornia, disclosed his whereabouts in a 12-page letter
dated Feb. 12 that was brought from Laos by runner. It
arrived last week and was hand-delivered to The
Times on Saturday by a Gritz associate. The letter was
signed by Gritz and the two other Americans who are
with him in Laos.

One is David Weekly, 35, of Encinitas, California, a
Vietnam War-era Navy airman. The other is Gary
Goldman, 38, of Encino, California, described by
friends as a soldier of fortune trained in anti-terrorism
techniques.
Protests planned for Queen's visit
San Francisco — Uneasy city officials are bracing for
a series of protests on March 3, when President Rea
gan plays host to Queen Elizabeth II at a state dinner
here in the Golden Gate Park De Young Museum.
They expect up to 20,000 protesters to gather on a
large grassy field within 600 yards of the museum.
The March Third Coalition, comprising more than
50 organizations ranging from the Alice B. Toklas Gay
Democratic Club to the Young Socialist Alliance,
plans a rally to assert a wide assortment of political
and social causes.
Similarly, the newly formed Irish Republican Com
mittee is staging several events to urge the British to
leave Northern Ireland.
The Irish committee, a coalition of gro ups support
ing the reunification of Northern Ireland with the
Irish Republic, expects support from union members
and this city's many residents of Irish ancestry. The
committee plans to set up a "soup kitchen" to feed up
to 5000 people in front of City Hall and to join with the
March Third Coalition in a parade to the museum.
John Maher, the Irish committee's leader, says rep
resentatives of the Irish Republican Army will also be
present to condemn the British government for its
continued military presence in Northern Ireland, for
years torn by religious strife. Britain characterizes its
role there as filling a security need; the IRA calls it co
lonialism.
"There are so many people promising to come
demonstrate, we may have to rent Utah," Maher said.
Although most San Francisco protests have been
peaceful, haunting memories linger, especially of the
afternoon in 1975 when a woman named Sara Jane
Moore emerged from a crowd of onlookers outside
the St. Francis Hotel to take an unsuccessful shot at
President Gerald Ford.
Wallace hospitalized
Montgomery, Alabama — Gov. George Wallace,
hospitalized yesterday complaining of stomach pains,
probably will remain there most of the week, an aide
said.
Press secretary Billy Joe Camp said Wallace's ap
pointments were canceled through tomorrow and he
was expected to remain hospitalized "probably the
majority of the week."
Wallace, 63, was admitted to Jackson Hospital short
ly after midnight complaining of stomach pains.
Dr. Hamilton Hutchinson said Wallace was suffer
ing from a stubborn intestinal virus, but his condition
was not believed serious.
Preliminary tests showed Wallace has "a slight in
flammation to the left colon area," but further tests
were scheduled to make sure there is no intestinal
blockage, Camp said.
A hospital spokeswoman said Wallace was under
going "a standard battery of tests."
Doctors hope they will be able to treat Wallace with
medication, Camp said.

Oil producers caii meeting
C airo, Igvpt Saudi Arabia and other Per

emergt ic meeting for today to consider low
ering their oil prices amid reports that the re
duction mav lie more than previously expected
following Nigeria's unilateral $5.50-a-barrel cut
over the weekend.
Some analysts were predicting that the gulf
producers would match or even exceed the Ni

that the cut might reach as much as $7 a barrel to
keep the gulf states' oil competitive in the

A price cut by Saudi Arabia, the world's larg

There was still no clear indication how the

previous calls by Iran and Libya for an OPEC

uary Gallup poll giving him a 12-point lead in a head
to-head matchup with President Reagan, he begins
his campaign with considerable self-confidence.
Calling himself his principal competition, Mondale
said in a recent interview, "I'm not worried about the
other candidates, so long as I do my job well. I think
Americans are looking to see who will make the best
candidate, who makes the most sense, who shows the
capacity and experience needed for leadership. If I'm
able to demonstrate that, I believe I'm going to be
nominated and elected."
Mondale said the advantage of being the front
runner is the ability to be heard as he begins to define
himself, and yesterday, before roughly 300 friends
and contributors from across the country, including
Humphrey's widow Muriel who has since remarried,
he began that process.
PLO opposes Reagan's proposal
Algiers, Algeria — Palestine Liberation Organiza
tion leaders dealing with the sensitive issue of Presi
dent Reagan's Middle East peace initiative said yester
day that it was unacceptable, but they stopped short
of outright rejection.
The Palestinian stance on the Reagan plan, which
calls for Palestinian self-government in association
with Jordan on the West Bank and in the Gaza Strip,
was determined behind closed doors in a meeting of
the Palestine National Council's political committee.
The council, PLO's parliament in exile, has been
meeting for the last eight days to set policy for the
guerrilla movement.
The move not to reject the Reagan plan outright
was a victory for PLO leader Yasser Arafat, who
fended off a week of stormy criticism of the plan by
the radical factions in his organization to ram through
the more moderate line.
Specifically, Arafat was trying to make sure that the
word "reject" was not used in the resolution.
Arafat's strategy has been to avoid outright rejec
tion and to keep the wording of the resolution vague,

allowing him room to maneuver as he explores vari
ous formulas for a resolution of the continuing Mid
east crisis.
The announcement of the political committee's de
cision on the Reagan plan came yesterday afternoon,
a full day before a vote by the entire Palestine Na
tional Council (PNC) on its future political direction.
Observers here said that council adoption of the
committee's resolution, probably today, is a certainty.
The public release of the resolution yesterday was
taken as an indication of the confidence Arafat now
has in his ability to control the council and have any
measure he wants passed.
Ahmed Abdul Rahman, the council's official
spokesman, said the "Reagan plan does not satisfy the
inalienable national rights of the Palestinian people,
as it denies them the right of self-determination and
the establishment of an independent Palestinian state
in Palestine.
"The Reagan plan does not recognize the PLO as
the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian
people. This Reagan plan, which is in contradiction of
international legality is not acceptable by the Palesti
nian council as a sound basis for a just solution to the
Palestinian problem and the Arab-Israeli conflict."
However, when Rahman was asked specifically if
the wording of the statement meant that the U.S. plan
was rejected outright, he said, "The PNC does not re
ject the Reagan plan," he said. "It is insufficient."
Chinese leader to visit japan
Peking — China, visibly disappointed over signs
that Washington is pulling back from closer ties,
launched a broad offensive Sunday to woo U.S. ally
Japan into a new strategic relationship.
Communist party chief Hu Yao Bang disclosed ac
ceptance of an invitation to Tokyo from Japan's new
prime minister, although he set no dates. It will bethe
first visit by paramount leader Deng Xiaoping's
chosen successor to a major capitalist country.
The high-profile warming up came just two days af
ter Secretary of State George Shultz, discussing his
first visit to Peking three years ago, called for a "rea
sonable relationship." He avoided the phrase
"strategic relationship" which had been used by his
predecessors in the four years since normalization.
The occasion for China's predictable countermove
was the mission to Peking of Special Envoy Susumu
Nikkaido, a senior Japanese political leader and
former cabinent minister. Officially, Nikkaido was
here to report on behalf of Prime Minister Yasuhiro
Nakasone on Nakosone's recent summit talks in
Washington and Seoul. Unofficially, it appeared that
two close neighbors having problems of their own
with the United States were moving to mend their
strategic fences.
Significantly, Nakasone acted to assuage the Chi
nese on the eve of Nikkaido's visit by conceding to
parliament that japan was indeed guilty of aggression.
No Japanese prime minister has publicly made such a
concession, People's Daily commented in an editorial
published yesterday. This, the newspaper said, "will
be of positive significance for the development of
friendly relations between Japan and China and other
Asian and Pacific nations."
Massacre in India takes 1400 lives
New Delhi, India — Prime Minister Indira Gandhi
paid a six-hour visit to Assam yesterday and briefly re
lived with dazed survivors the eastern Indian state's
19-day-old holocaust of slaughter, estimated to have
taken up to 1400 lives.
During her absence, Parliament was locked in an
gry debate over the controversial election she or
dered in Assam and the bloodbath that ensued.
An opposition speaker, former Railway Minister

Madhu Dandavate, accused the 65-year-old prime
minister of using "Hitlerite tactics" to impose "a live
election over dead bodies" in Assam. Government
members charged opposition parties indirectly sup
ported the violence.
Voting that began Feb. 14 in the multi-stage state
election ended yesterday, and counting began with
Gandhi's Congress Party winning 23 of the first 26
races decided in the balloting for 126 state assembly
seats. Her party was assured of victory because of a
low turnout resulting from the violence and a boycott
declared by the Assamese Movement and major op
position parties.
Gandhi called the elections in January after the col
lapse of negotiations with student leaders of the pre
dominantly Hindu Assamese Movement, which is de
manding that hundreds of thousands of Bengali
speaking natives and emigrants from neighboring
Bangladesh, most of them Moslems be removed from
the voting lists. The movement wants them expelled
from Assam.
Libyan threat reduced
Washington — The threat from Libya's troop
buildup on its border with Sudan has receded, says
Secretary of State George Shultz, who claims a quick
U.S. response put Lib yan leader Moammar Khadafy
"back in his box."
Shultz, appearing on ABC's "This Week With David
Brinkley," said President Reagan acted "quickly and
decisively" to protect Sudan from Libya by moving
U.S. radar planes near Egypt because of concerns
about the Libyan troop buildup.
"I don't want to go into all of the ins and outs of it,
but I think the net of the whole thing is that the presi
dent of the United States acted quickly and decisively
and effectively and at least for the moment Khadafy is
back in his box where he belongs," Shultz said.
Sen. Henry jackson (D-Wash.) said the U.S. Air
borne Warning and Control System planes will most
likely leave the area within day.
"I expect that the AW ACS planes will be out tomor
row or today, certainly before tomorrow, unless .. .
there are new developments in the area," said Jack
son, a member of the Senate Armed Services Commit
tee, appearing on CBS's "Face the Nation."
The Libyan government denied any such troop or
plane movement.
Americans look for POWs in Laos
Bangkok, Thailand — Retired Green Beret Lt. Col.
James "Bo" Gritz has told the Los Angeles Times that
he is deep in the Laotian jungle on a new mission to
rescue American prisoners of war. He said that he has
come up with "some POW ID" but that he cannot
confirm its authenticity.
Meanwhile, two Americans reportedly on a POW
rescue mission mounted by Gritz face trial Feb. 28 on
a charge of possessing illegal communications equip
ment.
In a handwritten message from across the Mekong
River, Gritz said that another of his Laotian guerrillas
has been killed — the second in as many missions. But
he insisted that he will press his search for U.S. pris
oners from the Vietnam War until he can tell the na
tion whether any Americans are being held in Laos.
"If Americans are here," he wrote, "by God, let's
find out."
Gritz, 44, a Vietnam veteran from Westchester, Cali
fornia, disclosed his whereabouts in a 12-page letter
dated Feb. 12 that was brought from Laos by runner. It
arrived last week and was hand-delivered to The
Times on Saturday by a Gritz associate. The letter was
signed by Gritz and the two other Americans who are
with him in Laos.

One is David Weekly, 35, of Encinitas, California, a
Vietnam War-era Navy airman. The other is Gary
Goldman, 38, of Encino, California, described by
friends as a soldier of fortune trained in anti-terrorism
techniques.
Protests planned for Queen's visit
San Francisco — Uneasy city officials are bracing for
a series of protests on March 3, when President Rea
gan plays host to Queen Elizabeth II at a state dinner
here in the Golden Gate Park De Young Museum.
They expect up to 20,000 protesters to gather on a
large grassy field within 600 yards of the museum.
The March Third Coalition, comprising more than
50 organizations ranging from the Alice B. Toklas Gay
Democratic Club to the Young Socialist Alliance,
plans a rally to assert a wide assortment of political
and social causes.
Similarly, the newly formed Irish Republican Com
mittee is staging several events to urge the British to
leave Northern Ireland.
The Irish committee, a coalition of gro ups support
ing the reunification of Northern Ireland with the
Irish Republic, expects support from union members
and this city's many residents of Irish ancestry. The
committee plans to set up a "soup kitchen" to feed up
to 5000 people in front of City Hall and to join with the
March Third Coalition in a parade to the museum.
John Maher, the Irish committee's leader, says rep
resentatives of the Irish Republican Army will also be
present to condemn the British government for its
continued military presence in Northern Ireland, for
years torn by religious strife. Britain characterizes its
role there as filling a security need; the IRA calls it co
lonialism.
"There are so many people promising to come
demonstrate, we may have to rent Utah," Maher said.
Although most San Francisco protests have been
peaceful, haunting memories linger, especially of the
afternoon in 1975 when a woman named Sara Jane
Moore emerged from a crowd of onlookers outside
the St. Francis Hotel to take an unsuccessful shot at
President Gerald Ford.
Wallace hospitalized
Montgomery, Alabama — Gov. George Wallace,
hospitalized yesterday complaining of stomach pains,
probably will remain there most of the week, an aide
said.
Press secretary Billy Joe Camp said Wallace's ap
pointments were canceled through tomorrow and he
was expected to remain hospitalized "probably the
majority of the week."
Wallace, 63, was admitted to Jackson Hospital short
ly after midnight complaining of stomach pains.
Dr. Hamilton Hutchinson said Wallace was suffer
ing from a stubborn intestinal virus, but his condition
was not believed serious.
Preliminary tests showed Wallace has "a slight in
flammation to the left colon area," but further tests
were scheduled to make sure there is no intestinal
blockage, Camp said.
A hospital spokeswoman said Wallace was under
going "a standard battery of tests."
Doctors hope they will be able to treat Wallace with
medication, Camp said.

Oil producers caii meeting
C airo, Igvpt Saudi Arabia and other Per
sian Gulf Arab oil producers have called an
emergt ic meeting for today to consider low
ering their oil prices amid reports that the re
duction mav lie more than previously expected
following Nigeria's unilateral $5.50-a-barrel cut
over the weekend.
Some analysts were predicting that the gulf
producers would match or even exceed the Ni
gerian reduction, and a Saudi newspaper said
that the cut might reach as much as $7 a barrel to
keep the gulf states' oil competitive in the
glutted world it arket. 112 arlier, many analysts in
cluding sources close to the gulf producers had

antic ipated price reductions of $2-$4
A price cut by Saudi Arabia, the world's larg
est oil exporter, and its allies almost certainly
would lead to similar reductions by most pro
ducers who have not already lowered prices
There was still no clear indication how the
gulf states or the Organization of Petroleum Ex
porting Countries as a whole intended to try to
prevent an all-out price war. Algeria endorsed
previous calls by Iran and Libya for an OPEC
meeting to discuss how to prop up prices, but
there was no sign yesterday that a meeting )f
the cartel was imminent.
Oil ministers of the six members of the Gulf
Cooperation Council were scheduled to meet

capital of Riyadh to discuss "cur

Mondale announces candidacy
St. Paul, Minnesota-Former Vice President Walter
Mondale, using the rhetoric of liberalism tempered
with time, officially launched his presidential can
didacy here yesterday by declaring, "I'm ready to be
president."
Mondale, who learned politics from the late
Hubert Humphrey, served as Democratic state at
torney general and U.S. senator from Minnesota and
later was Jimmy Carter's vice president, announced
his candidacy from the ornate House chamber of the
Minnesota state capitol building.
He then took his large traveling party to the Iron
Range of northern Minnesota to hear firsthand of the
economic suffering that exists in America today and
to attack the administration of President Reagan.
"At the very core of my being and at the center of
my campaign and at the center of my administration is
going to be a philosophy that is entirely different from
the one that's causing you to suffer," he told a town
meeting in Virginia, Minnesota. "I don't believe
America was meant to be a jungle where we have sur
vival of the fittest or survival of the richest."
Later, pledging to restore the economic might of a
region with an official unemployment rate around 30
percent and pockets ranging up to 80 percent, Mon
dale said, "Some people say we can't do it. But this is
the nation that rebuilt Europe. Ours is the nation that
rebuilt japan. And today, I think the time has come to
rebuild the United States of America."
Mondale became the third official candidate for
the 1984 Democratic nomination and polls give him a
clear lead over his likely competitors. And with a Jan
uary Gallup poll giving him a 12-point lead in a head
to-head matchup with President Reagan, he begins
his campaign with considerable self-confidence.
