## Dance Week centers on mind, body 
### JULIE BECHNER 
Unfortunately, dance in the
University tends to be placed
"in limbo between a profes
sion and an academic disci
pline," said lancy Limpert, di
rector of the Dance Division.
Dance Week 1983, held this
week, seeks to bring the dance
program here out of that
limbo.
According to some dancers
here, dance should have dual
citizenship, drawing from and
sharing with both. Dance
Week stresses the need to rec
ognize dance as a legitimate
academic discipline within the
arts as well as a physical en
deavor.
As Diane Freccero sums it
up, "Dance is an academic dis
cipline, an expression of our
culture, an entertainment en
terprise, and above all, a per
formance. Dance Week com
bines many of these aspects of
dance and looks at dance from
a variety of perspectives."
The philosophy of Dance
Week centers on the mind/
body connection that dance
performance represents. For
those who view dance as sim
ply an aesthetically pleasingac
tivity, Freccero points out that
"choreography is an exercise
in problem-solving. You have a
given number of people and a
given amount of space and you
work within certain physical
limits to express whatever it is
you're trying to express. Dance
expresses the mind through
the body, synthesizing the
two."
This year Dance Week
examines performance, specif
ically the ways in which dance
and the other arts think about
and approach performance.
The program for Dance Week
covers a broad spectrum of
dance events: class, discus
sion, demonstration, film and
performance.
A class in Music and Dance
Improvisation draws on the
combined skills of Resident
Musician Gwendolyn Watson
and lancy Limpert. As an im
provisation class, it is open to
anyone who wants to explore
— musically, physically or vi
sually — the art of improvisa
tional performance.

Professors, musicians and
writers join hands with dance
artists and choreographers to
examine dance pertormance in
a panel discussion on "Topics
in Performance: Dance and the
Other Arts." John Chowning,
Professor of Music and in

novator of computer
generated music, Martin
Esslin, Drama professor and
critic, Adrian Piper, perform
ance artist and Mellon Fellow
in Philosophy, Lucas Hoving,
dancer, choreographer and
teacher, and Millicent Dillon,

art."
Dance Week also examines
dance as a form of expression
in cultures other than our own.
Folk and ethnic dance are often
used to communicate ideas, to
express emotions, and to cele
brate the rituals of life within
the realm of a specific culture.
The week offers a lecture
demonstration on Mexican re
gional dance forms by Susan
Cashion of the Dance Division
and the Ballet Folklorico de
Stanford, and also an evening
of folk dance films from
around the world hosted by
Lisa Codman, resident folk
dance artist.
Finally, Dance Week pre
sents two different dance con
certs as a contrast to a week of
looking at unstaged perform
ances. Dance artists and musi
cians from the Bay Area and
beyond contribute their
unique talents to the Dance
Week performances.
The concerts include works
by choreographer )ohn Good
win of New York City as well as
by faculty members Cashion,
Freccero and Limpert, and
alumnae Leslee Lewis and
julienne Weston. Music, one
of the primary elements of any
dance performance, is an im
portant facet of the Dance
Week concerts. Percussionist
Rod Marymor, harpsichordist
)ohn Toenjes, and Gwendolyn
Watson provide live accom
paniment and add dimension
to the performances. The
Dance Week concerts supply
the final word on performance,
displaying many aspects of
dance in performance — irn
provisational, ethnic, drama
tic, humorous — and tying to
gether the varied threads of the
art of dance.
The phenomenon of Dance
Week is a part of the Dance
Division's attempt to fulfill its
potential as a vital part of Stan
ford. Dance Week reflects the
Dance Division's desire to be
regarded as a campus resource
center for the dance, supple
mented and enhanced by
events sponsored by
adequately funded campus or
ganizations, a place where
dance exists both in theory and
in practice.

Unfortunately, dance in the
University tends to be placed
"in limbo between a profes
sion and an academic disci
pline," said lancy Limpert, di
rector of the Dance Division.
Dance Week 1983, held this
week, seeks to bring the dance
program here out of that
limbo.
According to some dancers
here, dance should have dual
citizenship, drawing from and
sharing with both. Dance
Week stresses the need to rec
ognize dance as a legitimate
academic discipline within the
arts as well as a physical en
deavor.
As Diane Freccero sums it
up, "Dance is an academic dis
cipline, an expression of our
culture, an entertainment en
terprise, and above all, a per
formance. Dance Week com
bines many of these aspects of
dance and looks at dance from
a variety of perspectives."
The philosophy of Dance
Week centers on the mind/
body connection that dance
performance represents. For
those who view dance as sim
ply an aesthetically pleasingac
tivity, Freccero points out that
"choreography is an exercise
in problem-solving. You have a
given number of people and a
given amount of space and you
work within certain physical
limits to express whatever it is
you're trying to express. Dance
expresses the mind through
the body, synthesizing the
two."
This year Dance Week
examines performance, specif
ically the ways in which dance
and the other arts think about
and approach performance.
The program for Dance Week
covers a broad spectrum of
dance events: class, discus
sion, demonstration, film and
performance.
A class in Music and Dance
Improvisation draws on the
combined skills of Resident
Musician Gwendolyn Watson
and lancy Limpert. As an im
provisation class, it is open to
anyone who wants to explore
— musically, physically or vi
sually — the art of improvisa
tional performance.

Professors, musicians and
writers join hands with dance
artists and choreographers to
examine dance pertormance in
a panel discussion on "Topics
in Performance: Dance and the
Other Arts." John Chowning,
Professor of Music and in

novator of computer
generated music, Martin
Esslin, Drama professor and
critic, Adrian Piper, perform
ance artist and Mellon Fellow
in Philosophy, Lucas Hoving,
dancer, choreographer and
teacher, and Millicent Dillon,

art."
Dance Week also examines
dance as a form of expression
in cultures other than our own.
Folk and ethnic dance are often
used to communicate ideas, to
express emotions, and to cele
brate the rituals of life within
the realm of a specific culture.
The week offers a lecture
demonstration on Mexican re
gional dance forms by Susan
Cashion of the Dance Division
and the Ballet Folklorico de
Stanford, and also an evening
of folk dance films from
around the world hosted by
Lisa Codman, resident folk
dance artist.
