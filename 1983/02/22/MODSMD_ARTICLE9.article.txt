The Stanford Alumni As
sociation (SAA) is not for
alumni only.
Through its many de
partments, the SAA pro
vides services tor current
students and the commu
nity as well. Margot Nelson,
director of classes and stu
dent services, said, "We're
building goodwill for the
University."
A non-profit organiza
tion, the SAA is supported
strictly through member
ships. The SAA does not do
any tundraising. Nelson as
serted, "We're unique
among most schools in that
area "

One of the
purposes of
'Experience by
Degrees' is to get
students to study
what they're
interested in . . .

To join the more than
50,000 life members, one
need not even have
graduated from Stanford.
Anyone who is "part of the
Stanford family" is wel
come to join, according to
Nancy Ditz, special assistant
to the director.
The SAA is divided into
seven departments includ
ing publications, continu
ing education, Sierra Camp,
travel study, clubs, classes
and student services.
Contrary to what its name
suggests, the SAA is con
cerned with students. "Stu
dents have become a high
priority for us," Nelson
said.
While about 25 students
are employed by the SAA at
Bowman Alumni House, the
headquarters of the SAA,
doing clerical work or coor
dinating programs, most
students involved with the
organization are affiliated
with the Student Alumni
Network (STAN).
Started in January 1981,
STAN now consists of 125
undergraduate volunteers
who, "Support/plan" the
programs of the Student
Services Department, ac
cording to Nelson.
STAN is funded by an
ASSU fee assessment and
memberships of the SAA.
The SAA's Student Ser
vices Department offers
many programs for under
graduates to not only take
advantage of but also to
help plan and coordinate.
One of these is the
Alumni Contact Service
(ACS). A career reference
library, the ACS allows stu
dents the opportunity to
speak to professionals
about their jobs. Emphasiz
ing that it is not a job place
ment service, Nelson said
some students have found
jobs through alumni con
tacts.
"Day-On-The-)ob" is a
program which Nelson said,
"Takes the contact service
one step further." Students

spend a day with an alum
nus at his place of work,
gaining insight as to what
the real working day is like
in a given career.
Students also have a
chance to speak to alumni
about their careers through
the "Experience By De
grees" program. Each pro
gram is a reception featur
ing alumni from a certain
department speaking in
formally about their work
experiences which may or
may not be related to their
major. Nelson asserted that
one of the purposes of the
program is to encourage
students to "study what
they're interested in, not
what they think they need to
get a job."
This year, Experience By
Degrees will be com
plemented by "A Major
Event on the Quad" spon
sored by the School of
Humanities and Sciences
and the SAA on May 10.
Each department will
have faculty and alumni at a
booth in the Quad and will
provide information on
courses offered by the de
partment and career paths
graduates with that major
nave taken, according to
Nancy Bernfield, coor
dinator of Departmental
Student Services for
Humanities and Sciences.
Approaching San Fran
cisco is a STAN-funded pub
lication. Written and mar
keted by students, this book
contains useful information
about San Francisco includ
ing bus routes and shop
ping districts.
STAN also arranges
senior brunches where
seniors meet informally
with faculty and alumni at
alumni homes during
winter and spring quarters.
Nelson estimatedthat about
300 seniors participate in
this program each year.

To join the more
than 50,000 life
members, one
need not have even
graduated from
Stanford.

For students new to Stan
ford who aren't from the
Bay Area, STAN provides a
surrogate family through
the Ho me-Away-F ro m -
Home program. Any
freshman inquiry at Bow
man is matched with a local
alumnus family which he
visits once a quarter.
Another organization
which is part of the Student
Services Department is
Stan ford-in-Govern men t.
The major function of this
organization is to help stu
dents obtain internships in
Washington, D.C.
STAN also sponsors sev
eral annual class events in
cluding Senior Casino Night
in the winter and the lunior
Gatsby Party, the Sopho
more Red and White Ball
and the Freshman Luau in
the spring.

ing that it is not a job place
ment service, Nelson said
some students have found
jobs through alumni con
tacts.
"Day-On-The-)ob" is a
program which Nelson said,
"Takes the contact service
one step further." Students

spend a day with an alum
nus at his place of work,
gaining insight as to what
the real working day is like
in a given career.
Students also have a
chance to speak to alumni
about their careers through
the "Experience By De
grees" program. Each pro
gram is a reception featur
ing alumni from a certain
department speaking in
formally about their work
experiences which may or
may not be related to their
major. Nelson asserted that
one of the purposes of the
program is to encourage
students to "study what
they're interested in, not
what they think they need to
get a job."
This year, Experience By
Degrees will be com
plemented by "A Major
Event on the Quad" spon
sored by the School of
Humanities and Sciences
and the SAA on May 10.
Each department will
have faculty and alumni at a
booth in the Quad and will
provide information on
courses offered by the de
partment and career paths
graduates with that major
nave taken, according to
Nancy Bernfield, coor
dinator of Departmental
Student Services for
Humanities and Sciences.
Approaching San Fran
cisco is a STAN-funded pub
lication. Written and mar
keted by students, this book
contains useful information
about San Francisco includ
ing bus routes and shop
ping districts.
STAN also arranges
senior brunches where
seniors meet informally
with faculty and alumni at
alumni homes during
winter and spring quarters.
Nelson estimatedthat about
300 seniors participate in
this program each year.

To join the more
than 50,000 life
members, one
need not have even
graduated from
Stanford.

For students new to Stan
ford who aren't from the
Bay Area, STAN provides a
surrogate family through
the Ho me-Away-F ro m -
Home program. Any
freshman inquiry at Bow
man is matched with a local
alumnus family which he
visits once a quarter.
Another organization
which is part of the Student
Services Department is
Stan ford-in-Govern men t.
The major function of this
organization is to help stu
dents obtain internships in
Washington, D.C.
STAN also sponsors sev
eral annual class events in
cluding Senior Casino Night
in the winter and the lunior
Gatsby Party, the Sopho
more Red and White Ball

the spring.
The Stanford Alumni As
sociation (SAA) is not for
alumni only.
Through its many de
partments, the SAA pro
vides services tor current
students and the commu
nity as well. Margot Nelson,
director of classes and stu
dent services, said, "We're
building goodwill for the
University."
A non-profit organiza
tion, the SAA is supported
strictly through member
ships. The SAA does not do
any tundraising. Nelson as
serted, "We're unique
among most schools in that
area "

One of the
purposes of
'Experience by
Degrees' is to get
students to study
what they're
interested in . . .

To join the more than
50,000 life members, one
need not even have
graduated from Stanford.
Anyone who is "part of the
Stanford family" is wel
come to join, according to
Nancy Ditz, special assistant
to the director.
The SAA is divided into
seven departments includ
ing publications, continu
ing education, Sierra Camp,
travel study, clubs, classes
and student services.
Contrary to what its name
suggests, the SAA is con
cerned with students. "Stu
dents have become a high
priority for us," Nelson
said.
While about 25 students
are employed by the SAA at
Bowman Alumni House, the
headquarters of the SAA,
doing clerical work or coor
dinating programs, most
students involved with the
organization are affiliated
with the Student Alumni
Network (STAN).
Started in January 1981,
STAN now consists of 125
undergraduate volunteers
who, "Support/plan" the
programs of the Student
Services Department, ac
cording to Nelson.
STAN is funded by an
ASSU fee assessment and
memberships of the SAA.
The SAA's Student Ser
vices Department offers
many programs for under
graduates to not only take
advantage of but also to
help plan and coordinate.
One of these is the
Alumni Contact Service
(ACS). A career reference
library, the ACS allows stu
dents the opportunity to
speak to professionals
about their jobs. Emphasiz
ing that it is not a job place
ment service, Nelson said
some students have found
jobs through alumni con
tacts.
