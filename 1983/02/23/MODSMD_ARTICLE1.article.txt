# Suspect pleads innocent
## Charged with theft of $17,518 
### TROY EID 
Edgardo Garlit, a financial analyst
accused of embezzling $17,518 from
the Center for Information Technol
ogy (CIT), pleaded innocent to four
charges of grand theft in Palo Alto
Municipal Court Friday.
Garlit was arrested by Stanford de
tectives Feb. 9 for allegedly submit
ting phony invoices for work done by
a non-existent company. He remains
free on $3000 bail and has been
placed on investigatory leave with
pay by the University. A preliminary
hearing is scheduled for March 8.
"We think we have a pretty solid
case," Stanford Police Capt. Raoul
Niemeyer said. "These kind of cases
happen all the time, but of course
not of this magnitude."
According to Niemeyer, the case is
still under investigation, and police
are looking for additional evidence.
Until it is obtained, "we won't know
if there were any accomplices or
whether or not additional charges
should be filed," he said.
Niemeyer said Garlit had "an inti
mate and complete knowledge" of
the payment process and was able to
circumvent normal checks in the sys
tem.
According to Linda Stabler, CIT
personnel manager, "It is a serious
matter. It is receiving serious atten
tion at CIT now."
According to an affadavit filed with
the court, an accounting, manager
became suspicious in late December
when Garlit inquired about a check
to a phony firm that was held up for
lack of information. Garlit told the
manager the firm was his brother-in
law's.
Other Stanford employees later
said they had seen Garlit pick up a
check for the firm and submit work
authorizations for the firm, accord
ing to the affadavits. The accounting
manager checked the firm's name
and could find no telephone listing
for it. Internal auditors charged that
neither the work contracts nor the
firm existed.
Auditors told police that in many
cases the phony work requests were
issued under a blanket order set up
for emergency work. Garlit is sus
pected of forging the signatures of
Herb Fong, manager of operations
and maintenance, and Bruce Wig
gins, assistant director of operations
and maintenance, on some of the
work orders.
Garlit, a Mountain View resident,
could not be reached for comment.
Niemeyer said the last large-scale
Stanford embezzlement occurred in
1977, when Music Prof. Phillip Peter
son smuggled about $64,000 by
"submitting cashier receipts from a
camera company, supposedly for re
payment." Peterson pleaded no con
test and was convicted.
