## The 						Stanford Daily Don't close the Tower now 
### 
It is clearly the most famous building at the
University, and it probably has more nicknames
than any other building here; it is Hoover
Tower, and its observation platform is now
closed to the more than 40,000 visitors who go
up to the top each year.
Last week the University closed Hoover Tow
er's observation deck to the public so that fire
sprinklers could be installed. The deck is cur
rently not expected to reopen for a year al
though the director of risk management here
said the safety project should not take any more
than six months.
As a result, the Tower, which has been open
for decades without any sprinklers, will now be
closed during the 1983 commencement exer
cises.
We understand the University's safety con

cerns. Vet we believe the timing for this project
could not have been worse. The University gave
no warning to the guide service or to students.
Seniors and their parents visiting for the June
ceremonies will now be deprived of their last,
and for many of the parents their only, chance
to see the most spectacular view of the campus.
We sincerely doubt that what has been post
poned for years cannot be postponed until this
summer. Furthermore, if the University waited
until June to begin installing the sprinklers, the
project would still be nearing completion by
next winter quarter.
We agree with the tour guide who said the
University was guilty of "bureacratic bungling"
when it waited until the day before the tower
was to be closed before notifying the public,
denying us all the opportunity to get one last
look.
