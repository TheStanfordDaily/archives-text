# Reasons for non-registration
## 
### 
In january of 1981 I was required by
law to present myself at the Post Of
fice to register for the draft. At that
time I felt strongly that I did not want
to register, and decided that I would
not. I felt sure that I would be given a
second chance to register if I wanted
to; I also thought that I might decide
to go public someday. Well. . . .
Today I am much more sure of my
decision not to register than I was
then. My education and experience
have given strong grounding to what
was initially a gut-level reaction. But
keep in mind that I am still acting on
what I feel; there is no set of informa
tion from which one can deduce that
one should not register. It's not a
logical issue.
There are several reasons why I am
refusing to register. The first is that I
strongly disagree with the basic
premise of the draft — that a person
should give up his or her individual
conscience to the will of the state. If I
were speaking in religious language,
this would translate into something
like "the law of Cod is higher than
the law of man." But since I do not
choose to use that language, I do not
have that "excuse;" hence I am held
subject to the typical logic that says,
"we cannot all choose which laws we
will and will not obey." But it is clear
to me that situations requiring ethi
cal choices, such as whetheror not to
kill somebody (which is what the
draft boils down to), are the situa
tions in which following individual
conscience rather than socio
political coercion is most essential.
My second reason is that the most
likely use for a draft is in a situation to
which I would object. This is a politi
cal judgment; I am basically asserting
that I do not trust our government. I
find it very hard to believe that the
likely use for a draft is defending our
selves from Soviet attack (as in West
ern Europe); in this nuclear age, I
cannot conceive of a major war that
would last the six months that it
would take to train the first draftees. I
find it much more likely thatourdraft
army will go into war where our
"aliens" are at war now — El Salvador
or Nicaragua, for example. The last
war we fought was Vietnman, and
our government would fight these
wars the same way if they thought
they could get away with it.
This argument still leaves the pos
sibility that I could register and then
refuse induction if I were called to go
fight in Central America. But that is
not the path I am taking. I am refus
ing at the point of registration be

cause registering endorses the status
quo in a society that I consider to be
unjust.
That is a very serious criticism, and
one that I feel awkward in making.
After all, as an educated white male, I
am a member of the class that be
nefits most from the freedoms that
do exist in this country. I would be
foolish to assert that there are many
places where I personally would be
better off. What I am saying, though,
is that the freedoms I have, the
privileges I have as a member of the
dominant class in thissociety, exist at
the expense of the less privileged
members of this society and of the
world.
The culture I live in is one in which
the people like myself dominate the
rest in such a way that those at the
bottom are forced to the margins of
existence and literally killed. And we
allow this to happen because we do
not see the suffering that has re
sulted from the way we exercise our
power. The pictures are generally
there for us, but we choose not to
see them, or not to take them seri
ously.
I am refusing to register because I
take those pictures seriously. I be
lieve strongly that this culture treats
its women unjustly, treats its blacks,
Chicanos, native Americans and
other national minorities unjustly,
treats its poor people unjustly. It
treats the colored people outside its
borders unjustly as well. I do not
wish to serve in this nation's army, to
kill or to die defending injustice.
It is enough, however, for me
merely to refuse to serve. That is why
I am refusing to register, and why I
am doing so publicly. I want to use
my voice to speak on the side of the
non-white and non-male people who
are so under-represented in spaces
like these.
A lot of people, especially blacks
and Chicanos, are serving in the mili
tary because it is the only job they
can find. These people, instead of
me and my white friends, are sub
jected to the dehumanization of mili
tary training and military life. Inorder
to protect the privilege of people like
myself, they are taught to be "good
soldiers," to follow orders and to kill
without thinking or feeling.
And as soldiers are taught to make
objects of the "enemy," so men in
this culture are taught to make ob
jects of women. Men control the
women in this society in countless
ways — through the economic dom
ination of marriage, through the
male-created images of women in
the media, through laws concerning

abortion, and through direct physi
cal violence, to name a few. That
draft registration is directly tied to
this male dominance is not one of the
more conventional arguments, but it
is for me a very important one. Male
privilege is another privilege for
which I will notfight. It will be argued
that we have to fight to preserve what
we have in order to move forward to
what we want. In this light, someone
will inevitably raise the question
"What about Hitler?" And, since my
father and his parents are Jews who
emigrated from Germany in the mid
19305, it is a question I cannot ignore.
But let me point out that it was an
army of white men, commanded by
white men, who killed the Jews —
and the blacks, and the Communists
and the homosexuals. . . .
All these arguments should make it
clear why I feel it is the ethical thing
to do to refuse to register. But thfey
miss the fact that it is an important
and effective tactic in a political
struggle. Resistance to draft registra
tion, whether public or private,
makes it significantly harder for the
government to take the next step and
reinstate the draft.
It is also important to note that, in
spite of all my talk about justice and
privilege, I am still taking advantage
of my position. I am still a Stanford
student living comfortably on my
father's money, and my refusal to re
gister doesn't directly help anyone.
What it is, though, is a personal
commitment; a way of symbolically
breaking the bonds that tie me to my
background. Having already made a
decision to take a risk for what I be
lieve in, my freedom to follow my
conscience is greatly increased.
Much more than before, although
not completely, my life is my
own. It may seem to some, even to
many, that in criticizing our society
and refusing to register for the draft,
I am giving strength to the "enemy."
But American capitalist democracy
and Soviet-style communism are not
the only alternatives. The experi
ences I have shared with draft resis
ters, with Third World people, with
feminists and with others, have given
me some feeling for what a non
violent, non-racist, non-patriarchal
society will look like. And though
neither I nor anyone else knows all
the steps to such a time and place,
regusing to register is one step I am
sure I must take.

will and will not obey." But it is clear
to me that situations requiring ethi
cal choices, such as whetheror not to
kill somebody (which is what the
draft boils down to), are the situa
tions in which following individual
conscience rather than socio
political coercion is most essential.
My second reason is that the most
likely use for a draft is in a situation to
which I would object. This is a politi
cal judgment; I am basically asserting
that I do not trust our government. I
find it very hard to believe that the
likely use for a draft is defending our
selves from Soviet attack (as in West
ern Europe); in this nuclear age, I
cannot conceive of a major war that
would last the six months that it
would take to train the first draftees. I
find it much more likely thatourdraft
army will go into war where our
"aliens" are at war now — El Salvador
or Nicaragua, for example. The last
war we fought was Vietnman, and
our government would fight these
wars the same way if they thought
they could get away with it.
This argument still leaves the pos
sibility that I could register and then
refuse induction if I were called to go
fight in Central America. But that is
not the path I am taking. I am refus
ing at the point of registration be

cause registering endorses the status
quo in a society that I consider to be
unjust.
That is a very serious criticism, and
one that I feel awkward in making.
After all, as an educated white male, I
am a member of the class that be
nefits most from the freedoms that
do exist in this country. I would be
foolish to assert that there are many
places where I personally would be
better off. What I am saying, though,
is that the freedoms I have, the
privileges I have as a member of the
dominant class in thissociety, exist at
the expense of the less privileged
members of this society and of the
world.
The culture I live in is one in which
the people like myself dominate the
rest in such a way that those at the
bottom are forced to the margins of
existence and literally killed. And we
allow this to happen because we do
not see the suffering that has re
sulted from the way we exercise our
power. The pictures are generally
there for us, but we choose not to
see them, or not to take them seri
ously.
I am refusing to register because I
take those pictures seriously. I be
lieve strongly that this culture treats
its women unjustly, treats its blacks,
Chicanos, native Americans and
other national minorities unjustly,
treats its poor people unjustly. It
treats the colored people outside its
borders unjustly as well. I do not
wish to serve in this nation's army, to
kill or to die defending injustice.
It is enough, however, for me
merely to refuse to serve. That is why
I am refusing to register, and why I
am doing so publicly. I want to use
my voice to speak on the side of the
non-white and non-male people who
are so under-represented in spaces
like these.
A lot of people, especially blacks
and Chicanos, are serving in the mili
tary because it is the only job they
can find. These people, instead of
me and my white friends, are sub
jected to the dehumanization of mili
tary training and military life. Inorder
to protect the privilege of people like
myself, they are taught to be "good
soldiers," to follow orders and to kill
without thinking or feeling.
And as soldiers are taught to make
objects of the "enemy," so men in
this culture are taught to make ob
jects of women. Men control the
women in this society in countless
ways — through the economic dom
ination of marriage, through the
male-created images of women in
the media, through laws concerning

abortion, and through direct physi
cal violence, to name a few. That
draft registration is directly tied to
this male dominance is not one of the
more conventional arguments, but it
is for me a very important one. Male
privilege is another privilege for
which I will notfight. It will be argued
that we have to fight to preserve what
we have in order to move forward to
what we want. In this light, someone
will inevitably raise the question
"What about Hitler?" And, since my
father and his parents are Jews who
emigrated from Germany in the mid
19305, it is a question I cannot ignore.
But let me point out that it was an
army of white men, commanded by
white men, who killed the Jews —
and the blacks, and the Communists
and the homosexuals. . . .
All these arguments should make it
clear why I feel it is the ethical thing
to do to refuse to register. But thfey
miss the fact that it is an important
and effective tactic in a political
struggle. Resistance to draft registra
tion, whether public or private,
makes it significantly harder for the
government to take the next step and
reinstate the draft.
It is also important to note that, in
spite of all my talk about justice and
privilege, I am still taking advantage
of my position. I am still a Stanford
student living comfortably on my
father's money, and my refusal to re
gister doesn't directly help anyone.
What it is, though, is a personal
commitment; a way of symbolically
breaking the bonds that tie me to my
background. Having already made a
decision to take a risk for what I be
lieve in, my freedom to follow my
conscience is greatly increased.
Much more than before, although
not completely, my life is my
own. It may seem to some, even to
many, that in criticizing our society
and refusing to register for the draft,
I am giving strength to the "enemy."
But American capitalist democracy
and Soviet-style communism are not
the only alternatives. The experi
ences I have shared with draft resis
ters, with Third World people, with
feminists and with others, have given
me some feeling for what a non
violent, non-racist, non-patriarchal
society will look like. And though
neither I nor anyone else knows all
the steps to such a time and place,
regusing to register is one step I am
sure I must take.

Is that all there is?
In january of 1981 I was required by
law to present myself at the Post Of
fice to register for the draft. At that
time I felt strongly that I did not want
to register, and decided that I would
not. I felt sure that I would be given a
second chance to register if I wanted
to; I also thought that I might decide
to go public someday. Well. . . .
Today I am much more sure of my
decision not to register than I was
then. My education and experience
have given strong grounding to what
was initially a gut-level reaction. But
keep in mind that I am still acting on
what I feel; there is no set of informa
tion from which one can deduce that
one should not register. It's not a
logical issue.
There are several reasons why I am
refusing to register. The first is that I
strongly disagree with the basic
premise of the draft — that a person
should give up his or her individual
conscience to the will of the state. If I
were speaking in religious language,
this would translate into something
like "the law of Cod is higher than
the law of man." But since I do not
choose to use that language, I do not
have that "excuse;" hence I am held
subject to the typical logic that says,
"we cannot all choose which laws we
will and will not obey." But it is clear
to me that situations requiring ethi
cal choices, such as whetheror not to
kill somebody (which is what the
