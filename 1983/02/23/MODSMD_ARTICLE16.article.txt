## Reverse racism is a social ill 
### 
One of the most serious and baseless social problems
in the United States is racism. This isasocial illwhich has
plagued our country — a nation loudly professing the
equality of all people — throughout its history. Racism
was the underlying attitude that not only condoned, but
provided support for, our enslavement of blacks in the
18th and 19th centuries, and more recently our intern
ment of individuals of Japanese ancestry during World
War 11. Hundreds of other less publicized incidents
exemplifying racism have marred our country's history
and have harmed the lives of countless Americans. In
addition to specific events, there have been, and con
tinue to be, vague and immeasurable inequities suffered
by victims of racist attitudes. These problems existed 200
years ago, and they exist today.
A significant point to realize, however, is that through
time we have rather steadily mitigated both the extent
and the manifestations of racism. What was accepted
policy a generation ago in many instances is now virtu
ally inconceivable. Racist attitudes, while still prevalent,
are not as widespread or as threatneing as they were
only a few decades ago. Slow, but steady, progress is
being made in the effort to eliminate racism from Ameri
can society.
Instrumental to the decline of racist attitudes and dis
criminatory policies has been the freedom and willing
ness of many Americans to discuss the problem.
Through public expression and debate the fallacies of
racism have become apparent, and consequently many
of the problems and beliefs have been redressed. This
process was most active during the reformist years of the
19605, but it continues today. The media, politicans,
organizations and perhaps most significantly, educators,
continue to call our attention to the problem of racism
and the inequities it engenders. As students, we are
frequently presented with articles, lectures, discussions
and even debates on racism. It is a serious social prob
lem, but it is one which we acknowledge, and as long as
that remains true racism will continue to diminish in
prevalence and effect.
As the situation of racism demonstrates, the liberal
tradition of higher education, which can be seen in the
freedom and desire to openly discuss social problems,
serves a critical corrective function in our society. Pre
judices and inequities cannot be rectified unless they
are first acknowledged, and the University is often the
first place such polemics are discussed. For this reason
liberal education is vitally important, not only for the
intellectual futherance of students, but for the well
being and advancement of our society.
Those matters which represent the most threatening
potential problems to the proper functioning of our
nation, then, are not those which receive widespread
attention and public criticism, but rather those which
society — and educational institutions in particular —
tend to ignore or downplay. An unwillingness to ac
knowledge a problem will only allow it to grow, steadily
developing through time into a more serious problem.
On this basis we should be extremely aware of all issues
neglected, ignored or skirted by those institutions
which have traditionally taken the first step in bringing
them to public attention.
One such example — an issue conspicuously absent
from professorial lectures, media coverage and political
speeches — is a phenomenon which may be called "re
verse racism." Just as certainly as racism exists so does

reverse racism. It is "reverse" in that it has developed as
a reacton, or over react ion, to common racism. In fact, its
existence is wholly dependent on the existence — or
more accurately, the perceived existence — of racism.
Whereas racism in our society is most commonly an
attitude held by individuals of the racial majority (namely
whites), reverse racism is an attitude possessed by the
victims, and supposed victims, of racism (most com
monly, although certainly not exclusively, blacks). The
"victims" in the first instance turn the tables and be
come the holders of the ill-founded attitude in the sec
ond.
So what is reverse racism? It is essentially a feeling of
learned helplessness. Having been told time and time
and time again that you are the victim of a maliciously
racist society, you cannot help but come to believe it.
Because you are of a certain minority, you are told that
all members of the racial majority are conspiring to re
press you. It is repeatedly explained to you that no
matter what you do, no matter how hard you try, society
will always be stacked against you. You cannot trust
members of the racial majority because they only wish to
exploit you. It is not at all surprising that individuals who
live in an environnment where they are regularly re
minded of these "facts" rather quickly develop an at
titude of resignation. Why bother trying when you have
been told that you cannot suceed?
To the reverse racist traditional forms of achievement
for himself and for others of his race can only be attained
with assistance. Because the whole system is skewed
against him, aid is both deserved and necessary if he is to
compete in society.
Those who sympathize with him remind him that
without quotas, loans, subsidies and other special stan
dards he has no hope of surviving in the racist society. It
is better to stay in the limited environment where he is
not in a minority than to venture out into a society
taunting him with wealth and dominated by racists.
In this wayawholesubclassof Americans has given up
on participating in society. That they are the permanent
victims of an unfair economy, an unrepresentative gov
ernment and a discriminatory society has been rein
forced in their minds. Rather than being encouraged to
overcome obstacles posed by racism, they are discour
aged from even trying. Just as the outlook of the racist is
warped by fallacious beliefs, so the attitude held by the
reverse racist is overwhelmingly influenced by inaccu
rate and exaggerated perceptions.
As stated earlier, racism is a serious social problem in
the United States. However, it is an issue which is widely
acknowledged and frequently addressed, and therefore
will slowly continue to decrease in severity. Reverse
racism, on the other hand — a problem just as real as the
racism which has fostered it — receives little, if any,
public attention. Perhaps this is because it is a politically
touchy and socially embarrassing issue. Nevertheless, as
long as it continues to be ignored it stands no hope of
being alleviated. )ust once I would like to hear a lecturer
— the same professor who speaks so valiantly of the
terrible effects of racism — broach the issue of reverse
racism. If the problem is not even discussed in our
hallowed halls of higher education there is no chance
that it will be discussed by the public at large.
