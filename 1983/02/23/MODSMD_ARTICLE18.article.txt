## Historical respect more important than accuracy 
### 
The Planning Office persists in its
grotesque abuse of history to justify
downgrading grass for the Inner
Quad. In the Feb. 15 Peninsula Times,
University planner Phil Williams is
reported to have cited as problems in
the use of grass its "not being practi
cal for a heavily travelled area, a lawn
would require noisy lawn mowers
and wateringat inconvenient times,"
and that "historically grass was never
used in the Inner Quad, and the aim
is to keep the new design consistent
with its original setting."
If Williams is sincere, and wants to
be truly accurate and consistent with
the original setting of the Inner
Quad, the final design must include
not asphalt, not pebbles set in con
crete, not even grass, but DIRT. To
use anything but dirt is to mock Wil
liams' historical model. He should
spend five minutes looking at the old

photographs of the original Inner
Quad, and he will see that his pre
ferred choices have absolutely no
historical basis in terms of what was
done.
As for the "inconvenience" of
noisy lawn mowers and untimely
sprinkling, that is easily resolved. Set
the sprinkling and mowing at con
venient times. What does he think
the rest of the campus lives with
now? Such inconveniences as he
cites to those in classrooms, libraries
and offices adjacent to irrigated
lawns have never bothered Williams
and his associates before.
One hundred years after
Olmstead's plan for the Inner Quad,
what honor would be paid to the
planner of San Francisco's Golden
Gate Park and Manhattan's Central
Park by layering Inner Quad with as

phalt? How does Williams think that
covering Inner Quad with pebbles set
in concrete would do justice to the
great landscape architect? Would
Olmstead have balked at using grass
if he had present day irrigation, and
would he have turned to asphalt out
of concern for grass being "impracti
cal" for heavily travelled student
areas? If outrageous reasoning can
raise the dead, the Planning Office
will resurrect Frederick Olmstead.
Let us hope that the University
Land and Building Committee, the
administration and trustees, reject
out of hand the Planning Office's
phoney appeal to history and in
stead, pay proper respect to a great
landscape architect.

Parking garage
Perhaps campus planner Judy
Chan or Physics Prof. Masun Vearian
could explain to all of us why the
University feels it cannot afford to
build a parking garage for the stu
dents, staff and patients of the Medi
cal Center, yet, at the same time is
bending over backwards to build a
multi-million dollar parking garage
for Stanford Shopping Center,
whose parkinglot is only filled one or
two days a year, like Christmas Eve. It
would appear that the University
gives a higher priority to business
profits than the needs of the com
munity. Just how much of the cost of
this parking garage comes out of our
tuition?
