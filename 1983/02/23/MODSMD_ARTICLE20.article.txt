# Art professor with major show pursues anonymity

'The purpose of
painting is always to
go beyond what can
be said in words.'

For nearly 18 years, Art Prof.
Frank Lobdell has moved
routinely and rather unobtru
sively through the classrooms,
where he teaches painting and
drawing, to his studio on the
outskirts of campus.
For him, painting is a way of
life.
Lobdell decided to become
an artist when he was 18
years-old after seeing a retros
pective of Picasso's works in
Chicago in 1940.
"I realized how deeply
moved I was," he said. "I
wanted the power to move
others as I had been moved."
After serving in the war, he
studied under the abstract ex
pressionist Clyfford Still at the
California School of Fine Arts
(now the San Francisco Art In
stitute). He returned there to
teach from 1957 to 1965.
Lobdell was profoundly in
fluenced by Still. The art histo
rian Thomas Albright, in an ar
ticle for Lobdell's current show
at the San Francisco Museum
of Modern Art, said, "Of all the
painters inspired by Still when
he taught in San Francisco in
the late '40s, none preserved
and propagated Still's attitude
as rigorously as Lobdell, while
at the same time achieving so
much independence in his
art."
Lobdell said what moved
him about Still was "his
single-minded devotion to
painting and the intensity of his
spirited and courageous in
volvement— the willingness to
sacrifice anything to illuminate
his vision."
This is how Lobdell paints.
For him painting is a philoso
phy, a means of thinking, a way
of life. Albright referred to it as
his "monastic commitment."
The current show is his first
major exhibition since 1966. He
said he does not like to show
his work "chiefly because I
have a difficult enough time
staying in touch with myself.
I'm just not strong enough to
refrain from reading the re
views."
Lobdell said he feels there is
a danger in becoming a public
monument because it results
in "having to meet expecta
tions from the outside that
maybe aren't your own."
He said, "Being anonymous
is really the best condition to

be able to create."
The show covers 30 years of
Lobdell's work. In his article
for the show's catalogue, Peter
Boswell, a Ph.D. candidate
here in art history, said, "These
paintings are characterized by
a stubborn commitment to ex-

plore the deeply personal and
private aspects of the human
psyche and through this to
chart the gradual evolution of
the artist's own existential vis
ion."
"From the beginning, Lob
dell has chosen to express
himself through symbols,"
Boswell continued. He be
lieves the symbols that have
survived through time and are
dominant in Lobdell's recent
work are the archetypal sym

bols: spirals, spheres and cres
cents. These are symbols
which have associations deep
in the unconscious mind and
appear in the art of many
different cultures and the more
literal and figurative symbols
which appear in his work of the
1960s and reveal a strong influ
ence of Picasso have been

pared away or abstracted.
"There has been a constant
. . . evolution in Lobdell's art
. . . from a somber, sometimes
tragic sense of elemental con
flict to a lyrical and exalted lib
eration, from darkness into
light," said Albright.
Lobdell called it "a paring
down to where what isn't said

remains.
He said, "There is a continu
ing need to invent signs — not
symbols which imply the uni
versal. These signs have to do
with a personal stance; they
are self-portraits in many
ways."
Similarly, there is a need for
these signs to be placed in an
environment, he said, in order
to create a context for the
statement. "The purpose of
painting is always to go beyond

what can be said in words."
For Lobdell, the process of
making a painting involves a
continual reordering of ele
ments as well as a constant
questioning of the work's ef
fectiveness. "If you already
know where you're going, it's
just an illustration," he said.
"One thing leads to another.

I never know where I'm going
because I'm influenced by the
work."
He must avoid the tendency,
he said, to become so fixed on
something that he thinks he
wants, that he almost paints
over something good. This
tendency reminded him a time
in kindergarten when he lost
his nickel for lunch. Retracing
his steps in the autumn rain he
almost walked by a brand-new
scout knife. Determined to
find that nickel, he had nearly
missed the knife.
Lobdell is notoriously slow
and unprolific precisely be
cause this interaction between
himself and the painting is so
time-consuming.
"There are a lot of paintings
that had to happen the way that
they did; I don't particularly
like some of them," he said.
Major influences on his
work, he said, include artists
like Diebenkern, Goya and
Rembrandt in addition to Still
and Picasso. But because he is
extremely curious about
different cultures and different
periods in art, many things in
fluence his work uncon
sciously, he said.
"Once you start mentioning
influences, it's like unraveling
a sock: it goes on and on," he
said.
In essence, painting is "a
kind of conversation with my
self," said Lobdell. "The paint
ing represents that conversa
tion. If the dialogue is impor
tant enough, others will listen
in."
"You want the painting to
explain itself," he said.
Lobdell is somewhat
bothered by the general lack of
interest here in taking art clas
ses and using the art facilities.
"I wish they did use them
more," he said. "People don't
have to be art majors to be in
volved. I enjoy working with
people from all disciplines."
In teaching he tries to get
people to first see believing
that the more one looks, the

more one sees. "One really
never sees anything until
they've drawn it,"he said.
Lobdell said no one is really
born with a love of painting.
Possibly one is born with ap
titude or unusual curiosity, but

a real commitment to painting
must be cultivated.
Despite reluctance to show
his work, Lobdell is quite
pleased with the reaction to
the current show. "The re
sponse has been very gratify

ing," he said. "It's been good
for me to see it all together in
order to make a judgment of
where I want to go."
"I'm enjoying it,"he said,
"but sooner or later I have to
get back to work."
