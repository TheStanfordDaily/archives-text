## Card tennis in fine form, post smashing victories Card women blast Cal 
### MARK ZEIGLER 
Berkeley — The Stanford
women's tennis team passed
its first real test yesterday in
trouncing seventh-ranked
UC-Berkeley at Channing
Courts.
1 he No. 4 Cardinal won five
of the six singles contests and
dropped No. 3 doubles to re
cord a 5-2 victory. The other
two doubles matches were
called due to darkness.
The win upped Stanford's
overall record to b-0 and ex
tended its match winning
streak to 27. The Cardinal
blanked Long Beach State 9-0
Saturday afternoon in a WCAA
match.
Although the Cal match
began on time at 2 p.m., the
No. 1 and No. 4 singles each
took nearly three hours to
complete. In the top spot,
Stanford's Elise Burgin strug
gled in the first two sets against
freshman Heather Ettus before
finally piecing together her
game and posting a 6-3, 4-6, 6-0
win.
Senior Caryn Copeland, at
Noi 4, prevailed in the after
noon's longest match by win
ning two tiebreakers en route
to a 7-6, 3-6, 7-6 victory over
Cal's Nina Bland.
In what seems to have be
come more of a tradition lately
than just a passing trend, the
Card again started the match
slowly.
Burgin, Copeland and No. 2
Linda Gates all lost their open
ing games but quickly re
covered to win the set. The
Card was up to similar tricks
two weekends ago against the
Arizona schools.
Brennan noted that once
one player gets untracked, it
rubs off on those on adjacent
courts and 'really starts snow
balling."
"We had a few more
matches under our belt (than
Cal) and I think it showed,"
Brennan said. "I think they
(Cal) are the No. 7 team (in the
country) and they might even
be a notch or two higher."
Neither team played with its
No. 4 player, as Card senior

Michelle Weiss was sidelined
wih the flu. Stanford freshman
lackie Joseph played with a
pulled stomach muscle that af
fected her serve and overhead
shots.
During the match, two other
Cardinal players suffered in
juries that left Brennan with
tive healthy netters at the af
ternoon's end. Copeland
pulled her upper hamstring
slightly while Burgin jammed
her thumb.
Gates and Alison Hardy were
the first Cardinals to finish off
their opponents. NCAA All-
American Gates downed Barrie
Bulmore, an AIAW A 11 -
American last year and the Be
ars' senior captain, in straight
sets, 6-4, 6-2.
Hardy, who Brennan called
the team's "most improved
player by far," disposed of
Wendy Driver 6-2, 6-1 in her
usual quick fashion.
Perhaps the afternoon's
most impressive performance
was turned in by freshman
Alyce Werdel at No. 3, evi
denced by her 6-2, 6-3 win over
lulie Grummel. "She's got a
complete game in the
backcourt," Brennan said of
the tall, lanky Werdel.
Freshman lackie loseph was
the only Card to lose at singles,
as Hannah Somerville took the
first set 7-6 (7-5) and then
cruised in the second, 6-1.
The No. 3 team of senior
Suzy Barbe and sophomore
Barbara Baughman also lost at
No. 3,6-1,6-1, in the only dou
bles match to be completed
before it became too dark to
play. At No. 1 doubles,
Copeland/Werdel lost the first
set 6-3 while Hardy/Joseph at
No. 2 won the initial set by the
same score when play was
halted.
Although Burgin appeared
to struggle in her victory,
Brennan was not about to dis
credit her opponent. "Ettus is
one of the top two or three
freshmen in the college
ranks," he said.
"Elise (Burgin) played a little
tentatively in the beginning.
She hates to lose so much that

she plays a little too tentative —
and it doesn't work against a
good player."
After falling beind 4-1, Cope
land followed the first set win
ning ways of her teammates
and came back to tie Bland at
five apiece. But Bland held and
jumped ahead 3-1 in the crucial
12th game.

Copeland had to call on
some spectacular serving and
net play to salvage the game
and force the tiebreaker,
which she won.
In the second set, it was
Copeland's turn to squander a
lead. After a 15 minute argu
ment over the score with
Bland, the Bear netter blew

past a shaken and limping
Copeland to win the set, 6-3.
Copeland again found her
self down 5-6 in the third and
deciding set, but again pulled
through in the cluth behind
her serve to tie it at 6-6. The
Card senior cruised in the tieb
reaker as Bland hit shot after
shot into the net.


THE BALL'S IN YOUR COURT: Cardinal
freshman Alyce Werdel exhibits her fine
backhand form yesterday in Stanford's 5-2
win over Cal at Berkeley. Werdel, playing in

Greg Webb/Daily
the No. 3 singles position, coasted to a 6-2,
6-3 victory over Julie Grummel. The win ex
tended Stanford's match winning streak to 27
and improved their record to 6-0 this season.
