### MARK ZEIGLER 
The men's tennis team con
tinued its winning ways with a
6-3 triumph over local junior
college foe Canada College
yesterday at the Stanford Ten
nis Stadium.
Over the weekend, the Car
dinal, now 4-1 in match play,
captured the 37th annual Nor-
Cal Intercollegiates for the 13th
time in 14 years by bettering
UC-Berkeley 30 to 23 in the
team competition.
The Card did not clinch yes
terday's match until the dou
bles play, as Canada won
maches at the top and bottom
of the singles ladder.
Once again playing without
the services of sophomore star
Scott Davis, who was in the
Grand Prix Tournament in La
Quinta, Calif., coach Dick
Gould was forced to move
each member of his
freshman-dominated team up
a notch on the ladder.
Davis upset Phil Dent, the
No. 69 player in the world, 6-2,
7-5 Monday.
Eduardo Esteban downed
freshman Eric Rosenfeld at No.
1 6-3, 6-4 and Rob Mitchell beat
sophomore Jeremy Semple
6-0, 6-4 in the sixth position for
Canada's only two singles
wins.
Freshmen John Letts, Dan
Goldie and Jim Grabb stopped
their opponents in straight sets
at two, three and five, respec
tively. Junior Mark McKeen
crushed Canada's Bob Hepner
in the fourth spot.
In the doubles, McKeen/
Grabb defeated Esteban/John
Lobban at No. 1, 6-2, while
Goldie/Rosenfeld lost 6-1, 6-2
at No. 2.
In the final doubles match,
the frosh team of Letts and
Geordie McKee blasted Cana
da's Hepner and Gerald Yung
6-1, 6-0 in a match of former
high school teammates.
McKee and Hepner, a sopho
more, played 1-2 at Menlo
Park's Menlo School two years
ago.
Although the singles final of
the NorCal Intercollegiates has

yet to be played, Stanford
clinched the team victory. Car
dinals Letts and Davis will play
for the singles crown some
time later this month.
Letts upset the tournament's
No. 1 seed — Cal's Randy
Nixon — in the quarterfinals,
6-2, 6-0, and then downed
teammate Goldie 7-6, 6-4 to set
up the all-Stanford final. Gol
die pulled an upset of his own
in the quarters by beating No. 4
seed Harold Hecht of Cal, 6-2,
6-3. Davis was seeded second.
In the NorCal doubles final,
the Stanford team of Davis/
Letts defeated Hecht/Chris
Schoop three and three.
"It was a really good tour
nament for us," Gould said.
"In singles, I'm convinced we
can play with anybody, but we
need to beef up on doubles."
Stanford takes on the Uni
versity of San Diego today and
West Valley College Friday.
Both matches are at home and
begin at 1:30 p.m.
