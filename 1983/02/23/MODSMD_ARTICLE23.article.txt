# Freshman singles in winning run
## Card upsets No. 5 Fresno St. 
### ROB ZWEIG 
Freshman Mike Deßenon
shed his goat horns for the
hero's cap with a two-out,
game-winning hit yesterday in
Stanford's 9-8 upset win over
fifth-ranked Fresno State at
Sunken Diamond.
Deßenon bounced a two-out
single through the hole on the
right side of the infield to score
Rick Lundblade from second
base with the winning run in
the bottom of the tenth inning
to boost Stanford to an 11-4-1
pre-league record and extend
their winning streak to eight
games.
The clutch single was Deße
non's fourth in five trips to the
plate and also gave him three
RBl's on the afternoon. But it
was also Deßennon's muff of a
two-out single to right field in
the top half of the ninth inning
and his ensuing errant throw
that allowed the Bulldogs to tie
the ballgame just when
everyone was preparing to
leave Sunken Diamond.
"That was just a freshman
mistake," Cardinal manager
Mark Marquess said. "If you
say freshman aren't going to
make mistakes you've got to be
kidding, but he'll be a great
player in time."
The Fresno State rally in the
ninth frame was the culmina
tion of a long stretch drive that
almost overcame Stanford's
quick leap from the gate in the
first two innings.
The Cardinal exploded with
four runs in each of the first
two innings that must have left
the boys from Fresno wonder
ing why they ever got on the
bus to Palo Alto.
Stanford bunched together

five hits as all nine batters came
to the plate in the first to chase
southpaw starter Vince Barger.
The Card then took advantage
of two errors by third baseman
Randy Asadoor with some ag
gressive running on the
basepaths to stretch its lead to
8-0 after two innings.
But the Bulldogs, who were
out hit 13-8 on the day, climbed
back into the game on the
strength of two home runs.
Catcher Emergy Phillips drilled
a David Harris fast ball over the
scoreboard in left field for a
grand slam after Harris, in the
game after Gregg Lomnicky
and Doug Gwaltney had each
hurled two innings, and loaded
the bases with two out in the
fifth inning.
Yogi Berra once noted,
"You're not out of it 'til you're
out of it,"and Marquess
agreed.
"You're always worried
when you're playing a good
team. You've got to keep work
ing even when you're ahead,"
he said. "We fell a little asleep
when their guy (reliever Mark
Wenzel) started getting his
breaking ball and slider over.
And that grand slam got them
back in it."
Wenzel was impressive as he
allowed just three Cadinal hits.
Meanwhile, David Harris set
tled down to work the sixth and
seventh frames and Jeff Ballard
again showed his stuff by bail
ing Eric Pierce out of a jam in
the top half of the eighth with
the Stanford bench on their
feet to yelling encouragement.
Ballard was paged from the
bullpen with two on and no
one out but shut the door by
nailing the lead runner on a

sacrifice bunt attempt and fool
ing Eric Fox with some sharp
breaking balls for a strikeout
that retired the side.
"Ballard's real cool, and he
can throw the curve or
change-up over anytime,"
Marquess said of his top re
liever.
With one in the ninth, Bal
lard had apparently picked up a
save with a called strike curve
ball on the outside corner. But
the umpire disagreed and a
walk resulted, leaving runners
at first and second.
A looper to right brought
home the Bulldogs seventh run
and the eighth soon followed

when Deßenon over the ball
and then skipped his relay by
shortstop John Verducci.
Although marquess had
down played the game's im
portance, Stanford should get
a psychological boost from its
big win when they begin their
Pacific-10 schedule this
weekend at UCLA.
The Cardinal skipper even
appeared confident when rattl
ing off the names of all the
young players who have per
formed so well against non
league competition adding,
"We're way ahead of where I
thought we'd be at this stage of
the season," he said.

HONEY, I'M HOME: Senior third baseman Vince Sakowski
slides safely home in the first inning of yesterday's game
against Fresno State. His run was one of eight the Card earned

Artie Streiber/Daily
before Fresno State rallied with eight more forcing the game
into 10 innings. Freshman Mike Deßonen had a c lutch single
with two out to bring home the winning run.
