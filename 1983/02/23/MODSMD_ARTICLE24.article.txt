## Just let the kids play 
### 
People are wondering what's wrong with
kids these days. Kids don't throw snowballs
at cars anymore. Kids don't even throw rocks
at soda cans. Instead, they shoot light mis
siles at asteroids and eat little energy pan
cakes with the Pac family.
There is a big argument about this.
Some say that video games are excellent
for increasing hand-eye coordination and
teaching kids about the value of winning and
success. I tend to think it's a little pollyanish
to think that a child who can dominate an
Atari game from supper to bedtime is going
to increase his chances of hitting a baseball
with a bat. I also tend to doubt that the game
will "rot his brain."
What the games do is remove the kid from
family functions. The same thing sports used
to do to us. To get away from the parents is
part of the plan. Kids used to go outside to get
away from the adults. It's really quite pure —
the kids aren't old enough to discriminate by
sex or race.
Kids can't do that anymore. Kids can't play
because the adults follow them outside.
Every time a kid picks up a bat and a ball
some well-meaning adult follows him to the
playground to organize a team. Organization
of play is wrecking childhood.
When I was a kid, I was Ted Uhlander. My
friend Wes was Johnny Roseboro. Everybody
in the neighborhood was somebody. I would
have suffered eternal shame if my Dad
showed up to organize the team or my Mom
showed up to watch.
The argument goes that parents put so
much pressure to win on Little League
coaches, it's a detriment to the character of
the sport. Why is there a coach in the first
place? No adult should be allowed to watch
kid play after he is four years old and until he
is 14.
Instead, we get private tutors for golfers
and tennis players as young as six or eight
years old and volunteer coaches for
everyone. Bobby Orr played hockey when he
was four. He would walk from the frozen
pond to his house with his skates still on and
his mother would put newspapers on the
kitchen floor so he could eat lunch without
taking his skates off. His mother didn't watch
him skate, she stayed home, or worked, or

whatever. Nobody had to show him how to
play hockey.
We have kids playing baseball in Taiwan on
national T.V. with Jim McKay telling us about
the patriotic implications.
Cody Webster pitched the winning game
against the Taiwanese national team and hit a
home run. Cody Webster is now a household
name — "wait until that Webster kid hits the
majors." Maybe he doesn't want to hit the
majors. Why should we care?
No one really has evil intentions in "help
ing out" thekids,butkidsshould be kids and
not little athletes. Kids today make errors. I
never made errors when I was a kid, I drop
ped balls. The pros made errors. I wasn't
expected to catch every one.
Soccer is finally gaining the popularity it
deserves in this country. It's the perfect game
for kids because the weaker players can just
run along in the pack chasing the ball and
nobody notices how bad they are. The kids
go out, have a lot of fun and don't even know,
let alone care, what the score is.
The well-meaning adults move in and vol
unteer to coach. Now kids are on the A team
or the B team and they take buses across
town to play other kids' teams and more
well-meaning adults run around the field
blowing whistles because one kid acciden
tally sticks his hand out to hit the ball. It never
used to stop our games. Neither did the buz
zer, just Mom telling us to come and eat.
Adults are supposed to sit home and tell us
how good the players were "in the good old
days," how to see DiMaggio play was like
seeing art with a capital A, how lackie Robin
son would have stolen 200 bases if he had
played in Ricky Henderson's day.
If we want to scare the kids out of the video
arcades, let's just volunteer to coach them.
Not me, if my kid wants to hit more home
runs than Reggie Jackson, he's on his own. If
he wants to win the Pac-Man championships
of the world, fine.
If we leave the kids alone, maybe they'll be
a little more inventive. Maybe they won't ride
BMX bikes on motocross courses and start
putting playing cards in the spokes of their
stingrays like the good old days.

for increasing hand-eye coordination and
teaching kids about the value of winning and
success. I tend to think it's a little pollyanish
to think that a child who can dominate an
Atari game from supper to bedtime is going
to increase his chances of hitting a baseball
with a bat. I also tend to doubt that the game
will "rot his brain."
What the games do is remove the kid from
family functions. The same thing sports used
to do to us. To get away from the parents is
part of the plan. Kids used to go outside to get
away from the adults. It's really quite pure —
the kids aren't old enough to discriminate by
sex or race.
Kids can't do that anymore. Kids can't play
because the adults follow them outside.
Every time a kid picks up a bat and a ball
some well-meaning adult follows him to the
playground to organize a team. Organization
of play is wrecking childhood.
When I was a kid, I was Ted Uhlander. My
friend Wes was Johnny Roseboro. Everybody
in the neighborhood was somebody. I would
have suffered eternal shame if my Dad
showed up to organize the team or my Mom
showed up to watch.
The argument goes that parents put so
much pressure to win on Little League
coaches, it's a detriment to the character of
the sport. Why is there a coach in the first
place? No adult should be allowed to watch
kid play after he is four years old and until he
is 14.
Instead, we get private tutors for golfers
and tennis players as young as six or eight
years old and volunteer coaches for
everyone. Bobby Orr played hockey when he
was four. He would walk from the frozen
pond to his house with his skates still on and
his mother would put newspapers on the
kitchen floor so he could eat lunch without
taking his skates off. His mother didn't watch
him skate, she stayed home, or worked, or

whatever. Nobody had to show him how to
play hockey.
We have kids playing baseball in Taiwan on
national T.V. with Jim McKay telling us about
the patriotic implications.
Cody Webster pitched the winning game
against the Taiwanese national team and hit a
home run. Cody Webster is now a household
name — "wait until that Webster kid hits the
majors." Maybe he doesn't want to hit the
majors. Why should we care?
No one really has evil intentions in "help
ing out" thekids,butkidsshould be kids and
not little athletes. Kids today make errors. I
never made errors when I was a kid, I drop
ped balls. The pros made errors. I wasn't
expected to catch every one.
Soccer is finally gaining the popularity it
deserves in this country. It's the perfect game
for kids because the weaker players can just
run along in the pack chasing the ball and
nobody notices how bad they are. The kids
go out, have a lot of fun and don't even know,
let alone care, what the score is.
The well-meaning adults move in and vol
unteer to coach. Now kids are on the A team
or the B team and they take buses across
town to play other kids' teams and more
well-meaning adults run around the field
blowing whistles because one kid acciden
tally sticks his hand out to hit the ball. It never
used to stop our games. Neither did the buz
zer, just Mom telling us to come and eat.
Adults are supposed to sit home and tell us
how good the players were "in the good old
days," how to see DiMaggio play was like
seeing art with a capital A, how lackie Robin
son would have stolen 200 bases if he had
played in Ricky Henderson's day.
If we want to scare the kids out of the video
arcades, let's just volunteer to coach them.
Not me, if my kid wants to hit more home
runs than Reggie Jackson, he's on his own. If
he wants to win the Pac-Man championships
of the world, fine.
If we leave the kids alone, maybe they'll be
a little more inventive. Maybe they won't ride
BMX bikes on motocross courses and start
putting playing cards in the spokes of their
stingrays like the good old days.
