# Women lose two in Arizona
## Sun state soaks cagers 
### LIBBY LEONARD 
Stanford's women's basket
ball team spent a miserable
weekend in Arizona. "The
highlight of the trip was the
nice weather," said a disap
pointed Cardinal coach Dotty
McCrea.
Instead of getting a tan, the
Card was burned as it suffered
back-to-back losses. Arizona
State scorched Stanford 79-53
Friday evening. Arizona col
lected its first conference win
Saturday in a 70-60 upset over
the slumping Cardinal cagers.
"Our lack of discipline and
organization was the worst I've
seen all season," McCrea said.
"We looked like we did at the
beginning of the year."
The Arizona schools applied
full-court presses which rattled
the Card and forced errors.
Stanford tallied 25 turnovers
against ASU, 15 against
Arizona.
Despite the lopsided loss,
Stanford dominated the ASU
Sun Devils in the opening half.
The Card controlled the
boards, stopped ASU's inside
game and held a 37-36 halftime
advantage.
But Stanford came out col
der than a Siberian winter after
the break, scoring just 16
points in the final half.
"If we don't continue to score,
our defensive effort falls off,
too," McCrea said. Stanford
failed to screen out on the
boards, allowing ASU second
and third-shot opportunities.
The Card, which leads the
conference in free throw per

centage, had trouble convert
ing foul shots against ASU.
"We only hit 14 of 24 free
throws," McCrea said. "That
really killed us."
Stanford never regained its
outside eye for the basket and
finished shooting 40 percent
from the field. ASU sunk 48
percent.
Freshman Virginia Sourlis
and senior Meg Metzger
shared top scoring honors for
Stanford with 14 points each.
No other Card managed dou
ble figures.
Senior Jeanne Ruark-Hoff,
Stanford's second leading
scorer, played sparingly due to
an ankle injury. McCrea was
surprised that Ruark-Hoff's ab
sence hurt the team so much.
"I always thought we were a
more balanced team,'' McCrea
said.
ASU center Kym Hampton
powered the Sun Devil's of
fense with 22 markers. Olivia
lones followed up several mis
sed ASU shots and added 20
points.
Stanford looked tired from
the start against the young
Arizona squad which featured
six underclassmen. Arizona
constantly pressured the Card
in an aggressive 2-3 zone.
"We weren't tough at all,"
McCrea said. "(Arizona)
seemed like they wanted it a lot
more than we did."
At halftime, Stanford faced a
33-26 deficit. The game was up
for grabs at the six minute mark
with the score tied. But then
Stanford unlocked the game

tor the Wild Cats, as it missed
the front ends in five one
and-one situations. Arizona
was quick to capitalize, scoring
eight straight points to pull
ahead for good.
The Wild Cats shot an im
pressive 50 percent from the
floor, compared to Stantord's
41 percent. According to
McCrea, "Arizona probably
played its best game of the
year." Arizona still owns last
place in the conference with a
1-8 record.
The Card was not thirsty
enough for points against
Arizona, as its slow moving of
fense produced another scor
ing drought. Ruark-Hoff
started in Tucson and chipped
in a team-high 15 points.
Metzger was second on the
scoring ladder with nine
points. The sharp-shooting
forward entered the game av
eraging 17.4 points per
game. Stanford's WCAA re
cord dropped to 4-6 (16-11
overall). "We've definitely
taken a step backward, and I
don't know why," McCrea ad
mitted.
A team meeting was held
yesterday so the players could
discuss their views regarding
the recent regress in play. The
team has a decision to make.
"Either we get back on our
feet, or we just lay down and
wait for the season to end,"
McCrea said.
Stanford has five regular sea
son games remaining. The
Card hosts Fresno State today
at 7:30 p.m.
