# Cardinal to meet 2nd place Cougs
## 
### STEVE ODELL Senior sports writer 
Stanford is at the crossroads
once again.
The Cardinal, 4-8 in the con
ference and 12-10 overall after
three straight losses, faces
second-place Washington
State tomorrow in an 8 p.m.
Pacific-10 Conference basket
ball game at Maples Pavilion.
Stanford's performance may
well be indicativeof the kind of
finish ahead, of which of two
paths Stanford will take.
With six games remaining,
the Cardinal can fold and con
clude yet another losing sea
son. Or, itcanfinish strongand
with just a split in the remain
der of its games, achieve its
first winning season in 10
years.
Even Stanford coach Tom
Davis, who usually shies away
from placing extra import on
any game, has declared that
the next two games against the
league's Washington schools
are of special significance.
"This is an important weekend
for us coming up," he said after
the Cardinal's 90-76 loss to USC
at the Sports Arena Saturday.
"How we come out Thursday
night against Washington State
will tell us where we stand. It
will tell us what kind of team
we've got."
There is no question that the
Cardinal is improved from
years past, already having ec
lipsed the most victories for a
season since 1979. And Stan
ford has been at the crossroads
before, and responded favora
bly. After having lost three in a
row, the Cardinal was at 2-5
before rebounding with two
wins at home in early February.
Washington State will be
enough of a test in and of itself.
Record-wise, at 10-3 in the con
ference and 18-5 overall, it will
be the toughest competitor the
Cardinal will face the remain
der of the season. Washington
State is coached by George
Raveling, considered to be one
of the finest motivators the

game has seen.
"They will probably put
some pressure on us, and try to
run a little bit, thinking that we
are a little thin in numbers,"
Stanford assisant coach Bruce
Pearl assessed of the Cougars.
"The other thing they will
probably do is try to shut us
down inside and try to cut off
our penetration."
Stanford will undoubtedly
play the pressure game also,
continuing with the strategy it
has used successfully all sea
son, whereby it applies a full
court press and fast breaks at
the slightest opportunity.
"Our philosophy is, if we can
work on our pressure game
since Oct. 15, and our oppo
nents can only work one week
preparing for us," Pearl said,
"then we should be better on
our pressure than they will be
on their pressure set."
The Cougars are coming off
of home victories over Oregon
and Oregon State last weekend
after having lost three straight.
They won their first eight
Pac-10 games and have split
their last six since the last time
these two ball clubs met, when
the Cougars came back from
an early 12-2 deficit to lead by
ten points throughout the sec
ond half and then hang on for a
67-63 win.
Like Stanford, who is playing
without AII-Pac-10 player John
Revelli, the Cougars are with
out their leading scorer and
rebounder for the season.
Senior forward Guy Williams
was the third leading scorer in
the conference before going
down with a knee injury four
weeks ago.
While Steve Brown, Keith
Jones, and Hans Wichary have
traded off picking up Revelli's
slack, six-foot-six senior for
ward Steve Harriel has done
the majority of the work in Wil
liams' absence.
" Harriel's just a great
player," Stanford assistant
coach Bruce Pearl said. "He
has really come on for them
since Williams' injury and has

become an offensive force for
Raveling. He's a lefty, and lef
ties are fun to watch. He is so
smooth. He can shoot the
(jump shot), he can penetrate,
he's got it all."
Other Cougars to watch are
guard Chris Winkler and for
ward Craig Ehlo, who both
have outside shooting
capabilities. Winkler had 16
points and Ehlo 11 points and
nine assists when the two
teams met in Pullman.
"Ehlo and Winkler are great
competitors," Pearl said.
"They're pretty heads up. It's
tough to beat teams like
Washington State, because
these guys know what it takes
to win."
This weekend we'll see if
Stanford knows how to do the
same.
â˜… Four of Stanford's final six

games are at home, a fact
which is important considering
that the Cardinal is 10-3 at
Maples with a conference
home mark of 3-2. On the road
it is 2-7 including j ust one con
ference victory.
"I think it definitely (the
home court advantage) makes
a difference," Pearl said. "It
certainly has up to now. You've
seen it in our victories over
USC, Arizona, Aiizona State at
home, and I hope we can carry
that advantage over to the last
four home games."
Pearl is optimistic regarding
the last segment of an already
comparatively at least, very
successful season. "If we finish
strong, we've got a possible
shot at an NIT thing," he said.
"I'm not going to give up on
these guys. The effort is there,
and I think they can do it."
