# Dept. to consider grad's expulsion
## 
### DOUGLAS JEHL Senior staff writer 
Anthropology department faculty
will meet in a closed session tomor
row morning to consider a commit
tee report which reportedly recom
mends the expulsion of doctoral
candidate Steven Mosher for violat
ing standards of professional con
duct.
Committee members have refused
to discuss the report or to indicate its
recommendation. But Mosher, in
documents obtained by the Daily,
states that the committee recom
mends he be expelled.
The charges against Mosher stem
from his conduct while doing field
research in the People's Republic of
China in 1979-80, which attracted
widespread media attention and has
been harshly criticized by Chinese
officials and many American schol
ars. Mosher contends that his career
has been jeopardized by a "cam
paign of slander spawned by a Com
munist regime."
At tomorrow's meeting, the de
partment's faculty will consider the
confidential report of the ad hoc fac
ulty committee, which spent 17
months investigating the allegations
of Mosher's misconduct. It will then
allow Mosher to make a written and
oral defense.
Mosher has criticized the commit
tee's conduct during the investiga
tion. "The final report produced by

the Stanford investigation . . . has
run on an incredible 17 months and
has caused me much mental and
emotional suffering . . his written
statement reads.
Like his colleagues, Anthropology
Prof. Clifford Barnett, department
chairman, would not confirm that
the recommendation was to expel
Mosher. Nor would he predict
whether or not the faculty would
come to a decision tomorrow morn
ing. "It's not an easy decision at any
point," Barnett said. "We've done
our best to make sure he gets a fair
shake and full consideration."
Mosher did not respond to phone
messages left last night at the motel
where he is staying. He arrived Sun
day from Taiwan, where he is con
ducting research and writing a book.
The department paid his airfare.
In his statement, Mosher portrays
himself as a scientist victimized by
his own ability. "It is a measure of the
success of my research that the
Chinese Communists are so anxious
to discredit it,"the statement says.
Barnett, who released a statement
yesterday, was non-judgmental
about the Mosher case, but insisted
that "sensitivity to others, prudent
judgment and unquestioned hon
esty are inherent in the nature of the
anthropological research process."
When Mosher went to China, he was one of
the first American social scientists permitted to
do fieldwork there. Most of his research was a
general study of a small village, but much of his
detailed evidence was on birth control and abor
tion methods. Mosher documented abortions
regularly performed on women more than seven
months pregnant, even against their will, and
said there were instances of officially instigated
infanticide.
When he published this evidence, he included
undoctored photographs of women in their third
trimester waiting for abortions. This disclosure
predictably displeased Chinese officials, but it
also angered American anthropologists who said
that Mosher should have masked the identity of
his research subjects before releasing the
photos.
Even while Mosher was in China, Chinese offi
cials complained to Americans that Mosher had
violated Chinese statutes by traveling without
authorization, bringing a female companion into
the country without authorization and smuggl
ing gold coins out of the country.

Those charges died down, but later, Mosher's
investigations of the birth control program
angered the Chinese, he says in his statement.
"By questioning the implementation of the birth
control program I had drawn the wrath of the
Chifiese powers-that-be, whose instinctive re
sponse to criticism is to crush it,"the statement
says.
After Mosher returned to Taiwan, Chinese of
ficials began to accuse him of abusing his status
as a scholar and behaving immorally and indi
cated that they view Mosher's activities as tan
tamount to espionage.
Soon after, Peking decided to cut back sharply
on social science research by United States
scholars. In private, Chinese officials said
Mosher's case was a central reason behind their
decision.
By September 1981, the discussion about
Mosher's behavior had grown so heated that two
anthropology professors brought the allegations
to the attention of the department, according to
Barnett's statement. An ad hoc committee was
formed, and met for the first time in October
1981. The charge to that committee asked that
members determine:
• "Did Steven Mosher properly protect the pri
vacy of the community and the individuals he

studied?
• "Did he violate any obligation, as an an
thropologist and graduate student ... to prop
erly protect the standing of the discipline and its
practitioners?
• "Did he abuse his status as an anthropologist
and a graduate student ... to engage in illegal
activities?"
Committee members include Anthropology
Profs. Jane Collier (who chairs the committee)
and Joseph Greenberg and Law Prof. Thomas
Grey.
According to Barnett's statement, relations be
tween the committee and Mosher have been
quite strained. The statement describes more
than a year of unwillingness on the part of
Mosher to cooperate with the committee. For
months, it says, he refused to respond to queries
and ignored deadlines. Even after the final report
of the committee was drafted this fall, Mosher
refused to submit his own report.
After a series of correspondence in which
Mosher insisted that he could not be prepared
for a meeting in January, as the University had
requested, but would be willing to present his
report at the end of February, the hearing date
was set for tomorrow, Barnett's statement says.

to the attention of the department, according to
Barnett's statement. An ad hoc committee was
formed, and met for the first time in October
1981. The charge to that committee asked that
members determine:
• "Did Steven Mosher properly protect the pri
vacy of the community and the individuals he

studied?
• "Did he violate any obligation, as an an
thropologist and graduate student ... to prop
erly protect the standing of the discipline and its
practitioners?
• "Did he abuse his status as an anthropologist
and a graduate student ... to engage in illegal
activities?"
Committee members include Anthropology
Profs. Jane Collier (who chairs the committee)
and Joseph Greenberg and Law Prof. Thomas
Grey.
According to Barnett's statement, relations be
tween the committee and Mosher have been
quite strained. The statement describes more
than a year of unwillingness on the part of
Mosher to cooperate with the committee. For
months, it says, he refused to respond to queries
and ignored deadlines. Even after the final report
of the committee was drafted this fall, Mosher
refused to submit his own report.
After a series of correspondence in which
Mosher insisted that he could not be prepared
for a meeting in January, as the University had
requested, but would be willing to present his
report at the end of February, the hearing date
was set for tomorrow, Barnett's statement says.
Anthropology department faculty
will meet in a closed session tomor
row morning to consider a commit
tee report which reportedly recom
mends the expulsion of doctoral
candidate Steven Mosher for violat
ing standards of professional con
duct.
Committee members have refused
to discuss the report or to indicate its
recommendation. But Mosher, in
documents obtained by the Daily,
states that the committee recom
mends he be expelled.
The charges against Mosher stem
from his conduct while doing field
research in the People's Republic of
China in 1979-80, which attracted
widespread media attention and has
been harshly criticized by Chinese
officials and many American schol
ars. Mosher contends that his career
has been jeopardized by a "cam
paign of slander spawned by a Com
munist regime."
At tomorrow's meeting, the de
partment's faculty will consider the
confidential report of the ad hoc fac
ulty committee, which spent 17
months investigating the allegations
of Mosher's misconduct. It will then
allow Mosher to make a written and
oral defense.
Mosher has criticized the commit
tee's conduct during the investiga
tion. "The final report produced by

the Stanford investigation . . . has
run on an incredible 17 months and
has caused me much mental and
emotional suffering . . his written
statement reads.
Like his colleagues, Anthropology
Prof. Clifford Barnett, department
chairman, would not confirm that
the recommendation was to expel
Mosher. Nor would he predict
whether or not the faculty would
come to a decision tomorrow morn
ing. "It's not an easy decision at any
point," Barnett said. "We've done
our best to make sure he gets a fair
shake and full consideration."
Mosher did not respond to phone
messages left last night at the motel
where he is staying. He arrived Sun
day from Taiwan, where he is con
ducting research and writing a book.
The department paid his airfare.
In his statement, Mosher portrays
himself as a scientist victimized by
his own ability. "It is a measure of the
success of my research that the
Chinese Communists are so anxious
to discredit it,"the statement says.
Barnett, who released a statement
yesterday, was non-judgmental
about the Mosher case, but insisted
that "sensitivity to others, prudent
judgment and unquestioned hon
esty are inherent in the nature of the
anthropological research process."
When Mosher went to China, he was one of
the first American social scientists permitted to
do fieldwork there. Most of his research was a
general study of a small village, but much of his
detailed evidence was on birth control and abor
tion methods. Mosher documented abortions
regularly performed on women more than seven
months pregnant, even against their will, and
said there were instances of officially instigated
infanticide.
When he published this evidence, he included
undoctored photographs of women in their third
trimester waiting for abortions. This disclosure
predictably displeased Chinese officials, but it
also angered American anthropologists who said
that Mosher should have masked the identity of
his research subjects before releasing the
photos.
Even while Mosher was in China, Chinese offi
cials complained to Americans that Mosher had
violated Chinese statutes by traveling without
authorization, bringing a female companion into
the country without authorization and smuggl
ing gold coins out of the country.

Those charges died down, but later, Mosher's
investigations of the birth control program
angered the Chinese, he says in his statement.
"By questioning the implementation of the birth
control program I had drawn the wrath of the
Chifiese powers-that-be, whose instinctive re
sponse to criticism is to crush it,"the statement
says.
After Mosher returned to Taiwan, Chinese of
ficials began to accuse him of abusing his status
as a scholar and behaving immorally and indi
cated that they view Mosher's activities as tan
tamount to espionage.
Soon after, Peking decided to cut back sharply
on social science research by United States
scholars. In private, Chinese officials said
Mosher's case was a central reason behind their
decision.
By September 1981, the discussion about
Mosher's behavior had grown so heated that two
anthropology professors brought the allegations
to the attention of the department, according to
Barnett's statement. An ad hoc committee was
formed, and met for the first time in October
