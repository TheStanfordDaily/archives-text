# Dept. to consider grad's expulsion
## 
### DOUGLAS JEHL Senior staff writer 
Anthropology department faculty
will meet in a closed session tomor
row morning to consider a commit
tee report which reportedly recom
mends the expulsion of doctoral
candidate Steven Mosher for violat
ing standards of professional con
duct.
Committee members have refused
to discuss the report or to indicate its
recommendation. But Mosher, in
documents obtained by the Daily,
states that the committee recom
mends he be expelled.
The charges against Mosher stem
from his conduct while doing field
research in the People's Republic of
China in 1979-80, which attracted
widespread media attention and has
been harshly criticized by Chinese
officials and many American schol
ars. Mosher contends that his career
has been jeopardized by a "cam
paign of slander spawned by a Com
munist regime."
At tomorrow's meeting, the de
partment's faculty will consider the
confidential report of the ad hoc fac
ulty committee, which spent 17
months investigating the allegations
of Mosher's misconduct. It will then
allow Mosher to make a written and
oral defense.
Mosher has criticized the commit
tee's conduct during the investiga
tion. "The final report produced by

the Stanford investigation . . . has
run on an incredible 17 months and
has caused me much mental and
emotional suffering . . his written
statement reads.
Like his colleagues, Anthropology
Prof. Clifford Barnett, department
chairman, would not confirm that
the recommendation was to expel
Mosher. Nor would he predict
whether or not the faculty would
come to a decision tomorrow morn
ing. "It's not an easy decision at any
point," Barnett said. "We've done
our best to make sure he gets a fair
shake and full consideration."
Mosher did not respond to phone
messages left last night at the motel
where he is staying. He arrived Sun
day from Taiwan, where he is con
ducting research and writing a book.
The department paid his airfare.
In his statement, Mosher portrays
himself as a scientist victimized by
his own ability. "It is a measure of the
success of my research that the
Chinese Communists are so anxious
to discredit it,"the statement says.
Barnett, who released a statement
yesterday, was non-judgmental
about the Mosher case, but insisted
that "sensitivity to others, prudent
judgment and unquestioned hon
esty are inherent in the nature of the
anthropological research process."
