NCAA to investigate Walker
Mission, Kan. — The NCAA confirmed yes
terday it is investigating Heisman Trophy win
ner Herschel Walker's contacts with the New
Jersey Generals of the United States Football
League.
David Berst, NCAA enforcement chief, told
The Associated Press his office has begun a
probe of reports that the three-time Ail-
American from the University of Georgia
signed a professional contract with the Gen
erals, then backed out after changing his
mind.
Walker and Georgia officials have denied
the reports.
Walker announced Friday that he intended
to play his senior year at Georgia. However,
he would be ineligible to do that if the NCAA
finds that he did, indeed, sign a pro contract.
"I've tried to avoid commenting directly on
what we're doing," said Berst, who smashed

NCAA precedent by publicly acknowledging
the probe.
Walker met with Generals' owner J. Walter
Duncan on the Georgia campus last Thurs
day. According to the Boston Globe, Walker
signed a contract, then changed his mind.
That would make him ineligible for any more
college football, but Walker has denied that
report, saying no offer was made.
