for an away meet thus far this
season.
The Cardinal women were
faced with an outstanding team
in Oregon State's fifth-ranked
squad. "We were definitely
out-manned," said head coach
Homer Sardina, whose team
has had serious trouble with in
juries for most of the season.
The Beavers scored 184.35 to
Arizona's 174.0, while Stanford
was close behind with 173.25.
Oregon State has the advan
tage of the National School of
Artistic Gymnastics, a training
ground for international com
petitors which is located
nearby. Many of the team's re
cruits come from the school,
including U.S. team com
petitors )ayne Weinstyein and

Laurie Carter.
Stanford senior Julie Bledsoe
had a good meet, completing
her first double full in competi
tion on the floor exercises,
scoringan 8.8. Also completing
outstanding routines were
Angie Barnes with a 9.3 in the
uneven parallel bars and Kim

Strauss with a 9.05 on the ba
lance beam. The women will
have a chance for revenge on
Arizona when they face them at
home on Friday. Looking to
ward that meet, Sardina added,
"We've lost a number of com
petitors, and we're still very
competitive."
