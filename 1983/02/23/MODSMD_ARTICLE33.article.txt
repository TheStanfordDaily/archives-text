# University declines to release Queen's guest list, travel route
## 
### DOUGLAS JEHL Senior staff writer 
British government concerns about protocol and sec
urity will mean that details about Queen Elizabeth li s
upcoming visit here must remain shrouded in secrecy,
University officials said yesterday.
Neither the list of those invited to the Queen's lunch
eon at Hoover House nor the route her motorcade will
follow when she arrives on campus will be made public.
According to Marlene Wine, special assistant to the
president, the guest list will not be released because the
British consulate in San Francisco has requested that the
names of British guests remain confidential. "We didn't
want to release a partial guest list," Wine said.
Wine guessed that the British request was made be
cause of protocol, rather than concern for the security of
British guests.
Wine and University spokesman Donald Stokes, how
ever, both cited security as the reason the parade route
would not be announced. The British consulate was
advised by the U.S. Secret Service to keep it secret, Wine
said.
University officials had originally hoped the Queen's

motorcade would drive straight through campus on the
way to Hoover House â€” the home of University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy. When timing problems made
that impossible, officials had hoped that the Queen's
route would still be made public.
"Kennedy pushed as hard as he could," Wine said.
"We wanted to be able to tell people where they could
come out and see the Queen."
City officials in San Francisco expect protests when
the Queen meets President Reagan for a state dinner in
Golden Gate Park the evening after her visit to Stanford.
A protest by members of the Irish Republican Commit
tee, urging the British to leave Northern Ireland, is also
expected here.
But that protest may be drowned out by the music of
the Leland Stanford lunior University Marching Band,
which has been invited to play for the Queen and her
husband, Prince Philip. The Band will play from a
specific location on the lawn outside Hoover House
while the royal party and 92 Stanford guests eat lunch
inside.
The Band's appearance has been approved by the
Secret Service, but some 80 band members must be
given security clearance before everything is made final.
