Black activist Angela Davis, a pro
fessor at San Francisco State Univer
sity and a one-time guest professor
here, keynoted a panel discussion on
"U.S. Support of Apartheid in
Southern Africa" held in Kresge Au
ditorium last night.
Speaking before an audience of
nearly 200, Davis, Randall Robinson,
chairman of Transafrica, and Joel
Samoff, associate professor of edu
cation here, blasted Americans for
their role in continuing apartheid
and stressed the need for liberation
in South Africa.
Davis advocated strict economic
and cultural sanctions against the
current South African government.
"People going to South Africa need
to be informed that they have con
tributed to the oppression of their
brothers and sisters," she said.
"The resistance and struggle for
liberation has had a mostly long and
glorious history," she said; since the
beginnings of the African National
Congress in 1912, the struggle has
been a continuous one.
Reagan and U.S. economic inter
ests are largely responsible for con
tinuing oppression in South Africa,
Davis said. She blamed Reagan for
many South African problems, point
ing to U.S. association with South Af
rica based on need for minerals and
other products, as well as military
support.
"The forces bringing economic
devastation to this land are the same
ones that are bringing oppression to
a vast majority of people in South
Africa," Davis said.
She called for a "multi-racial" draft
resistance effort, a ban on nuclear
arms proliferation, an end to the
death penalty and an awareness that
racism and oppression still exist. She
drew a parallel between poor, un
employed black people in America
and oppressed South African blacks,
both suffering under monied inter
ests of megacorporations and politi
cal oppression.
Encouraging activism, she said, "I
bring you one simple point. All of us
need to get involved in some form of

struggle, to make a commitment to a
struggle in this country and also to
make concrete contributions to our
brothers and sisters struggling in
South Africa."
Samoff, the first speaker, also em
phasized the notion of struggle.
He cited four myths regarding
South Africa, and then offered "four
truths" about oppression of the
black South African majority. "We
have said that U.S. policy is to leave
Africa to Africa; and to keep big polit
ical powers out of South Africa to
achieve this . . . what this actually
means is (U.S. policy has to) keep
other big powers out. . he said.
"A second myth is that apartheid is
a regional issue. But in reality it is a
continental issue," Samoff con
tinued. From South African libera
tion struggles emerges the base for
tilting the continent toward a single,
unified Africa, he said.
The third myth cited by Samoff was
that we take a hopeful view towards

avoiding conflict, and "resolving the
situation without an armed struggle.
In fact, of course, what's happening
now in South Africa is already a war."
Armed challenges to white South Af
rican power are a nearly daily occurr
ence, Samoff said.
Samoff's fourth myth was that lib
eration and an ideal peasant state
would be born "in 48 hours." He
said, "A seductive euphoria about
liberation characterizes U.S. news
reporting. . . . But we need to see
the transition to freedom as a strug
gle in itself."
The program was part of the Week
of Solidarity with the Liberation
Struggles in Southern Africa and the
Third World. Program sponsors in
cluded the Stanford Progressive Al
liance, the Stanford African Students
Association, the Southern Africa-
Liberation Solidarity Committee and
