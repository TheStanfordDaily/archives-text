# Senate narrowly approves McCloskey
## 
### JEFF BIDDULPH Senior staff writer 
In a five-hour meeting which began with an
unusual defense of the ASSU Council of Presi
dents member Rod Beckstrom and ended with
the resignation of graduate senator Joe
Hughes, the ASSU approved last night two
courses to be taught by guest professors and
made 13 of 14 student organizations eligible
for this spring's fee assessment ballot.
Former Rep. Paul "Pete" McCloskey was ap
proved as a guest professor by a dramatically
close margin of 11-5 with two abstentions. A
two-thirds affirmative vote was needed for ap
proval.
The senate also approved as guest profes
sors lack Creenberg and Julius Chambers,
who both taught a controversial course enti
tled "Racial Discrimination and Civil Rights" at
Harvard Law School in January. The course
gained national attention because it was
boycotted by Harvard's Black Law Students As
sociation (BLSA).
And every organization except the Leland
Stanford Junior University Marching Band will
appear on the fee assessment elections if,
under new senate guidelines, they gather peti
tions signed by at least 10 percent of the stu
dent body. The Band, which was denied a spot

on the ballot, will have to collect signatures
from 20 percent of the student Tsoc!y~To be on
the ballot.
The vote on McCloskey, who will teach a
political science course entitled "Congres
sional Decision-making" spring quarter, was a
cliff-hanger because two senators, Jim
McGrath and Hughes, passed in the initial roll
call vote count. Thus, the vote stood at 11-5
when McGrath and Hughes tiled their votes,
and McCloskey's course would have been de
nied had either senator voted "no."
Hughes voted first and abstained.
"I've got your fate in my hands, McClos
key," McGrath said. He then abstained.
"I was pleased we won, but it was closer than
we expected," said Seth Lintield, director of
the Guest Professorship Bureau (GPB), which
had recommended McCloskey's approval.
Other students and senators at the meeting
were not as pleased.
Three students, Rickie Lerner, John Trasbina
and David Eisner, urged senators in an open
forum before the meeting to vote against
McCloskey.
Lerner, treasurer of the GPB, called McClos
key "racist" and said that his approval would
be dangerous because it would be "setting a
precedent of transmitting hatred against a

group.
I ernnr's criticisms were based on past re
marks made by McCloskey in which he
claimed a "Jewish lobby" affects U.S. policy
towards Israel and even was instrumental in his
loss in the Republican primary for the U.S.
Senate last year.
Linfield defended McCloskey's teaching
ability and said that his position as a well
known and respected member of Congress
who would bring substantial knowledge of his
field into the classroom was reason enough to
approve him.
The senate approved with little debate
Greenberg and Chambers' course, despite
senator Jackie Johnson's complaint that the
senate had not devoted enough time to finding
out whether minority groups would boycott
the course here. Muhammad Kenyatta, the
president of Harvard's BLSA, said he sup
ported the boycott of the course at Harvard,
because Greenberg, who is white, and Cham
bers, who is black, will be teaching the course
jointly and "nothing short of a full-time minor
ity professor will be acceptable."
The course will focus on the legal distinc
tions involved in past decisions on civil rights
and racial discrimination. The professors, who
are both lawyers for the National Association

for the Advancement of Colored People
will teach the intensive three-unit
course for three weeks starting May 1.
The Band was denied senate approval for a
spot on the ballot because many senate mem
bers questioned the propriety of some of the
Band's expenditures.
Beckstrom defended the ASSU in response
to student and administrative criticism of the
body which Beckstrom said was primarily the
fault of the campus press which has covered
the senate inaccurately this year. He asked
senators to try to prevent further inaccuracies
by referring reporters to other members of the
ASSU and submitting statements in writing.
The campus press has propagated "frequent
inaccuracies. They are no more professional
now than they have been in the past,"
Beckstrom said.
The resignation of Hughes, a graduate
senator representing the School of Engineer
ing, came as the senate was disbanding late
into the night and was a surprise to many.
Hughes, the fifth senator to resign this year,
said he needed more time to devote to his
research responsibilities.
"I don't have the time that I think is neces
sary to devote to the ASSU," he said.
