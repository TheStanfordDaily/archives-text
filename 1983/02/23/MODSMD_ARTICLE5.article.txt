# ASSU ratifies Pub Board endorsements compromise
## 
### KIMBERLY BROWN Senior staff writer 
A compromise on endorsements
by student publications, drawn up
last week by a joint committee of
ASSU senators and Publications
Board members, passed unani
mously at last night's senate meet
ing.
The compromise, which was
drafted following several hours of
debate by the ad hoc committee,
now stands as an open-ended policy
statement.
The statement received a "red
stamp approval" by the senate, pas
sing with virtually no discussion.
According to the new policy, an
endorsement by a student publica
tion shall be "any statement made by

the appropriate editorial body" on a
candidate, slate, Special Fee request
or ballot measure.
In addition, all student publica
tions that plan to print endorsements
will be required to devise set proce
dures for doing so.
The procedures will consist of a
general outline of each publication's
intentions, including who will make
endorsement decisions, whether re
plies to endorsements will be ac
cepted and the dates when the en
dorsements will appear.
The procedures must be filed with
the Elections Commission which
will, in turn, notify all the candidates,
slates and sponsors of each publica
tion's procedures.
Finally, it was decided that all en

dorsements will be published during
the campaign period.
In presenting the compromise,
undergraduate senator Jerry Werth
eim emphasized that the new state
ment does not ask the publications
to "formulate regulations" govern
ing their endorsements. "There are
no guidelines per se," he said.
Both senators and Pub Board
members seemed generally satisfied
with the compromise achieved.
The compromise evolved after the
Pub Board voted unanimously ]an. 31
against the senate's recommenda
tion that the board "formulate regu
lations" governing student publica
tions' endorsements of ASSU candi
dates, slates, and Special Fee re
quests during elections.
