Reagan to protect Israeli border
Washington — President Reagan, trying to advance
the Middle East peace process, offered yesterday "to
take all necessary measures to guarantee the security
of Israel's northern borders" once Israeli troops
withdraw from war-ravaged Lebanon.
The president, speaking to the American Legion's
23rd annual convention, did not specify how the
United States could guarantee this security. But White
House spokesmen later said it could mean stationing
U.S. troops near the Israeli-Lebanese border.
During an address in which he spelled out his for
eign policies around the globe, Reagan also outlined
his negotiating "principles" for current U.S.-Soviet
talks aimed at reducing intermediate-range nuclear

weapons in Europe. The president said his "zero-op
tion" proposal — leaving no such weapons on either
side — "is not a take-it-or-leave it proposal."
But he said any ultimate arms agreement must pro
vide for "equality of rights and limits between the U.S.
and the Soviet Union." British and French nuclear
weapons are not negotiable between the two super
powers, he said. And any Soviet proposal that would
"have the effect of merely shifting the (nuclear) threat
from Europe to Asia cannot be considered reason
able," the president added.
The Soviets have proposed reducing the number of
their new European-targeted SS-20 missiles from 633
to 162 — Britain and France have 162 missiles in their
independent nuclear forces — in exchange for NATO
cancelling plans to deploy 572 U.S.-built Pershing-2
and cruise missiles beginning later this year. ThisSovi

et proposal has been rejected by the United States,
Britain, France and the NATO alliance on groundsthe
Soviets would retain a nuclear superiority with the
SS-20s, which each can carry three warheads. Most of
the missiles to be withdrawn under the Soviet pro
posal would be aging SS-4 and SS-5 missiles.
Saudis to defend oil wealth
Riyadh, Saudi Arabia — The United Arab Emirates
declared OPEC's $34 base price dead yesterday and
Saudi Arabia vowed to take whatever measures are
necessary to protect its oil wealth in the face of a
global price war.
The two countries met with fellow Persian Gulf
OPEC members Kuwait and Qatar amid reports they
were considering slashing the price of their oil as

much as $7 a barrel, following a $5.50 cut by OPEC
member Nigeria and $3 cuts in North Sea oil by non-
OPEC members Britain and Norway.
Qatar's oil minister, Sheik Abdul Aziz bin Khalifa al
Thani, said, "For sure there will be a price cut ... a
good chance of by more than $4." He made the com
ment after a three-hour meeting at the home of Saudi
Oil Minister Ahmed Zaki Yamani.
Yamani said earlier that Iraq and Libya were ex
pected to join the session todav, which would decide
on lowering prices and on future ties with other
members of OPEC.
Yamani declared that the Gulf Arab oil producers
were "the principal power within OPEC." He did not
specify what steps he envisioned. But possible meas
ures the Saudis could take include cutting produc
