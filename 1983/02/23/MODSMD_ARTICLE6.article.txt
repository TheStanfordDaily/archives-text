Reagan to protect Israeli border
Washington — President Reagan, trying to advance
the Middle East peace process, offered yesterday "to
take all necessary measures to guarantee the security
of Israel's northern borders" once Israeli troops
withdraw from war-ravaged Lebanon.
The president, speaking to the American Legion's
23rd annual convention, did not specify how the
United States could guarantee this security. But White
House spokesmen later said it could mean stationing
U.S. troops near the Israeli-Lebanese border.
During an address in which he spelled out his for
eign policies around the globe, Reagan also outlined
his negotiating "principles" for current U.S.-Soviet
talks aimed at reducing intermediate-range nuclear

weapons in Europe. The president said his "zero-op
tion" proposal — leaving no such weapons on either
side — "is not a take-it-or-leave it proposal."
But he said any ultimate arms agreement must pro
vide for "equality of rights and limits between the U.S.
and the Soviet Union." British and French nuclear
weapons are not negotiable between the two super
powers, he said. And any Soviet proposal that would
"have the effect of merely shifting the (nuclear) threat
from Europe to Asia cannot be considered reason
able," the president added.
The Soviets have proposed reducing the number of
their new European-targeted SS-20 missiles from 633
to 162 — Britain and France have 162 missiles in their
independent nuclear forces — in exchange for NATO
cancelling plans to deploy 572 U.S.-built Pershing-2
and cruise missiles beginning later this year. ThisSovi

et proposal has been rejected by the United States,
Britain, France and the NATO alliance on groundsthe
Soviets would retain a nuclear superiority with the
SS-20s, which each can carry three warheads. Most of
the missiles to be withdrawn under the Soviet pro
posal would be aging SS-4 and SS-5 missiles.
Saudis to defend oil wealth
Riyadh, Saudi Arabia — The United Arab Emirates
declared OPEC's $34 base price dead yesterday and
Saudi Arabia vowed to take whatever measures are
necessary to protect its oil wealth in the face of a
global price war.
The two countries met with fellow Persian Gulf
OPEC members Kuwait and Qatar amid reports they
were considering slashing the price of their oil as

much as $7 a barrel, following a $5.50 cut by OPEC
member Nigeria and $3 cuts in North Sea oil by non-
OPEC members Britain and Norway.
Qatar's oil minister, Sheik Abdul Aziz bin Khalifa al
Thani, said, "For sure there will be a price cut ... a
good chance of by more than $4." He made the com
ment after a three-hour meeting at the home of Saudi
Oil Minister Ahmed Zaki Yamani.
Yamani said earlier that Iraq and Libya were ex
pected to join the session todav, which would decide
on lowering prices and on future ties with other
members of OPEC.
Yamani declared that the Gulf Arab oil producers
were "the principal power within OPEC." He did not
specify what steps he envisioned. But possible meas
ures the Saudis could take include cutting produc
tion, lowering prices or both.
In oil trading centers the spot price of crude fell
more than $1 a barrel. Saudi crude, which sells on
contract at $34 dropped to about $27.25 on the spot
market from $28.75 a day before. Oil on the spot mar
ket is sold to the higest bidder, independent of con
tract prices.
The oil minister of the United Arab Emirates, Mana
Saeed Oteiba, told reporters: "There has to be a price
reduction, or else we shall be unable to preserve our
interests and our markets, if we maintain the present"
OPEC base price.
Oil price dip could help economy
Washington — A sharp decline in oil prices would
give a strong economic boost to the United States and
other oil importing countries, easing inflationary
pressures and reducing unemployment, adminis
tration officials and private analysts said yesterday.
As signs of an imminent major break in oil prices in
creased, most analysts stressed the likely benefits.
Among them:
— A reduction of $5 a barrel would raise living stan
dards in the United States by almost 1 percent this
year, if the full benefits of lower energy costs were
passed on to consumers.
— A cut of that size also would reduce consumer
prices by 1 percent by the end of this year and un
employment could decline by nearly 0.5 percent, ac
cording to estimates by administration and some
private economists.
But the anticipation of an economic windfall from
an oil price war was tempered on two fronts. Some oil
analysts said it was unlikely that energy companies
would lower fuel prices by as much as the decline in
crude oil prices.
GNP fall less than expected
Washington — The nation's economic output
dropped in the final three months of last year, but not
as badly as originally estimated, the Department of
Commerce said yesterday.
It said the gross national product fell at an annual
rate of 1.9 percent in the October-through-Decem
ber period, a slight improvement over the 2.5 percent
decline first reported.
However, the revised figures for the GNP — the to
tal value of goods and services produced in the econ
omy — still showed a 1.8 percent decline for the en
tire year, the sharpest annual drop since 1946.
Economists generally agree that an annual increase
of 3 percent to 4 percent in the GNP is necessary just
to maintain the economy at levels of prosperity suffi
cient to accommodate the growth in the number of
new job seekers.
In another economic development, a major group
of private economists predicted a "relatively strong
recovery" but with continued high unemployment.
In its quarterly report, the National Association of
Business Economists forecast a 3.9 percent rise in the
GNP from the fourth quarter of last year to the final
three months of this year.
House may combine EPA probes
Washington — House Speaker Thomas "Tip"
O'Neill (D-Mass.), moved yesterday to coordinate
five House probes into the management of the En
vironmental Protection Agency, warning, "America is
actually frightened. The American people are ex
tremely concerned about the environment of this na
tion."
As concerns about charges of political favoritism,
conflicts of interest and mismanagement continued
to grow, House Republicans also began to seek signa
tures for a letter asking President Reagan to take im
mediate action, warning, "The Democrats are dan
gerously close to making the environment a partisan
issue."
Meanwhile, EPA sources said that a lawyer review
ing EPA documents subpoenaed by the House wrote
a memo to his superiors last week saying that, while
he found no evidence of "criminal or illegal con
duct," he had "suspicions" about the awarding of cer
tain contracts and the escalation in cost of some con
tracts. The employee, Michael Murphy, was subse
quently dismissed from the agency.
Rusty Brashear, an EPA spokesman, said that the
EPA yesterday turned the entire matter over to the
FBI, including the "suspicions" memo and the docu
ments Murphy had been examining. Murphy refused
requests by his superiors at the EPA to outline specifi
cally what his suspicions were, Brashear said.
Murphy was not technically fired because he was
working under a temporary contract that expired last
week, Brashear said. But he acknowledged that the
contract had been extended once before.
Murphy worked in the office of Rita Lavelle, the as
sistant EPA administrator fired earlier this month by
Reagan. The documents Murphy was reviewing relat
ing to the $1.6 billion Superfund program became the

focus of a confrontation between Congress and the
administration over executive privilege.
Social Security elements approved
Washington — In the first votes on Social Security in
the new Congress a House subcommittee yesterday
approved major elements of a $165 billion rescue plan
that would defer this year's cost-of-living increase in
benefits, raise next year's payroll taxes and make all
new federal employees part of the system.
The cost-of-living allowance would be deferred
from July to next Jan. 1, and paid every January there
after. In addition, the bill would tax half the Social Se
curity benefits received by higher-income people.
In addition, all employees of nonprofit organiza
tions — present and future — would be required to
join. They now have a choice, and 1 million have
chosen to stay out of Social Security.
Two crucial and controversial parts of the rescue
plan were put off until tomorrow.
One involves long-term financing. To keep Social
Security whole in the long run, many Democrats favor
raising taxes beyond what already is scheduled begin
ning in the year 2010.
Israel threatens Syria
Washington — Moshe Arens, Israel's newly named
defense minister, warned yesterday that his country
could resort to a pre-emptive strike against Syria if the
buildup of long-range Soviet SAM-5 missiles con
tinues there and the Israelis conclude they are faced
with a "mortal threat."
Arens, whose nomination to the defense post was
unanimously approved by the Cabinet in Jerusalem
yesterday, said the missile buildup is an "almost des
perate" act by the Soviet Union to regain influence in
the Mideast. Although Israel istoleratingdeployment
of the powerful anti-aircraft missiles at present, he
said, it is destabilizing and "a wrong move on the part
of the Soviets."
U. S. defense officials have expressed concern that
the missle buildup might shift the balance of power in
the region and be considered an intolerable provoca
tion by Israel, which has not hesitated to launch a pre
emptive strike in the past when it felt its security was
endangered.
In September 1974, for example, the Israelis raided
suspected Palestinian guerrilla targets in Lebanon. In
June 1981, they bombed and destroyed a nuclear reac
tor in Iraq that they said was intended to produce
atomic bombs for use against Israel.
PLO rejects U.S. plan
Algiers, Algeria — The Palestine Liberation Or
ganization's governing body, under last-minute pres
sure from its radical wing, yesterday endorsed a reso
lution saying that it "rejects considering" President
Reagan's Middle East peace plan as a sound basis for
solving the Arab-Israeli conflict.
At the final session of its nine-day meeting here, the
Palestine National Council approved using the Arabic
word "rafd," or "reject," despite strong opposition
by Chairman Yasser Arafat.
Arafat supporters said that the language stopped
short of an outright rebuff to the U.S. initiative, leav
ing the chairman with sufficient room to maneuver in
still-problematic talks about achieving Palestinian
self-government on land now occupied by Israel.
As if to soften the impact of the counterattack
against the moderates led by the chairman, top Arafat
aide Salah Khalaf suggested that the Reagan plan
could be made acceptable with just one change to en
dorse "self-determination" for the Palestinian peo
ple.
Clearly signaling a new willingness to make major
concessions — even excluding the PLO from nego
tiations on the future of the Israeli-occupied West
Bank and Gaza Strip — he told U.S. reporters that he
and Arafat were willing to risk splitting the PLO if the
United States replied positively.
The Reagan plan unveiled Sept. 1 called for estab
lishment of a Palestinian entity in the occupied terri
tories to be associated with neighboring Jordan. The
PLO council called for creation of an independent
Palestinian state, rejected by Reagan, that then would
join Jordan in a confederation.
Stocks fall; trading active

yesterday. Trading was active.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped
3.33 to 1089.49.
