## Dorms safe despite warping walls 
### FELICIA LEE Staff writer 
Despite the bending and sag
ging of walls over the past few
months, Trancos House in Wilbur
and Serra House in Stern are
structurally safe, according to
Robert Mibach, facilities manager
for residence halls. Although re
pairs will be made "if deflections
continue to occur," Mibach said,
no further repairs are currently
being planned for the walls in the
two houses.
The bent walls in Trancos and
Serra, Mibach said, are non
load-bearing and can be removed
completely without the
structural integrity of the building
as a whole.
According to a report submitted
to the University by Charles Uh
rhammer, a Palo Alto structural
engineer who inspected Trancos
after the bending occurred, the
warped walls "do not constitute a
measurable safety hazard." The
report also said that because the
steel studs which form the
framework for the plaster wall
finish are constructed of ductile
material, the walls can withstand
bending and can "remain service
able so long as the lath and plaster
remain intact."
No single cause for the sagging
walls has yet been determined, al
though several theories have
been proposed. According to a

report submitted to the University
by Robert Matheu, another struc
tural engineer who inspected
Trancos, the buckling of the walls
probably resulted from "differen
tial deflections of the floors due to
the gradual creep of concrete dur
ingthe past2Byears." Mibach also
suggested that the sagging may
have resulted from sudden ex
pansion of the walls caused by a
heater being turned on, or from
some sudden shock, such as a
door being slammed.
Similar incidents of bending
walls have occurred before in
other buildings here, and the de
flections in Wilbur and Stern
"probably have been occurring
over the past 10 years," Mibach
added.
Trancos residents, however,
said the sudden deflection of the
walls there last fall occurred over
the course of an hour. The walls
there are no longer moving, they
added.
Students living in Trancos and
Serra are no longer worried about
the bending walls in their dorms.
Amy Hayes, a Trancos resident as
sistant, said the walls are "not one
of our major concerns right now."
Once residents were assured of
their safety, she said, they stop
ped worrying about the walls.
Other residents confirmed this,
saying they did not feel at all
threatened by the situation.
