# Dallin calls Andropov a strong leader
## 
### KEVIN CROSS Staff writer 
Soviet leader Yuri Andropov, Gen
eral Secretary of the Communist
Party of the Soviet Union, is a transi
tional figure, but one who will be
firmly in control for several years, ac
cording to History Prof. Alexander
Dallin.
Dallin told a capacity crowd ot
more than 60 people at a Bechtel In
ternational Center luncheon yester
day that "the transition from
Brezhnev to Andropov was im
pressively smooth and quick." An
dropov took control rather than his
rival, Soviet Politburo member
Konstantin Chernenko because "the
deck was stacked in Andropov's
favor," Dallin said.
"What we heard of Andropov
being a closet liberal is nonsense,"
he said, noting that the Soviet
leader's personal behavior, includ
ing his interest in western literature,
is a poor indicator of his political phi
losophy.
Dallin characterized the Soviet
Politburo as "quite conservative"
and referred to it as "a pretty antique
bunch of people" with few political
differences.
The main problem facing the
Soviet leadership is a "combination
of growing demands for inadequate
resources," as rising expectations

have led to increased competition
between many sectors in the state
controlled economy, Dallin said.
The slowdown of growth in the
Soviet economy is the key factor con
tributing to this decline in available
economic resources, he said. The
annual rate of growth in the Soviet
CNP has dropped from 7 percent to 2
percent over the last decade.
While the Soviet economy was
growing rapidly, Brezhnev had the
means to placate the various eco
nomic sectors by selectively increas
ing their funding, Dallin said. Today,
however, the Soviet leadership faces
difficult choices as these demands
continue on increasingly limited re
sources.
Competition between govern
ment departments has led them to
lobby for funding, but on a much
more covert level than American
interest groups lobby congressmen,
Dallin added.
Among these competing govern
ment departments, Dallin said de
fense receives the greatest budget
ary consideration. It is taking a larger
share of the budget in the current
stagnant economy. "No doubt it is a
kiss of death in Soviet elite to want to
reduce defense spending," he ad
ded.
Although no simple solutions exist
to Soviet economic problems, two

schools of economic thought are
represented in the Politburo.
"One set of solutions might be
called administrative ... to demon
strate a no-nonsense approach,"
Dallin said. This includes the need
for control of labor discipline, he
said, adding that the crackdown on
corruption in business management
and on absenteeism from work are
evidence of this approach.
"7 he other approach is reform . . .
give the people something of what
they want," similar to the economic
reforms in Hungary. Yet Dallin said
this approach would represent a very
fundamental retreat in Soviet philos
ophy, because of the difficulty in in
corporating the incentives of "mar
ket socialism" into communism.
Andropov favors the first ap
proach, while Chernenko favors the
latter, Dallin said. Thus the Soviets
have seen a major campaign against
corruption and labor violations in re
cent weeks which, he said, are "sig
nals of the drive for economic effi
ciency."
Dallin added, "The general popu
lation is becoming more cynical
about the future. There is a sense of
insecurity. . . . Brezhnev had in
sured that everyone would have job
security."
Addressing foreign policy, Dallin
said that although Andropov may

exhibit greater vigor, skill and finesse
than Brezhnev, he does not foresee
any significant changes in Soviet
foreign policy. "I do not believe that
the Soviet leaders look for adven
tures abroad to distract their people
from domestic problems."
