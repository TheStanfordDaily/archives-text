Students purchased at least 13
counterfeit tickets to Senior Casino
Night, held on Feb. 4, according to
Stanford Police Detective Katherine
Miller, who is currently conducting

meeting to purchase the tickets.
Meyer Library was often the location

was a "tall blond who wore a baseball
cap" and used the name of a Stanford
student who had nothing to do with
the scam.
Students were usually told that the
