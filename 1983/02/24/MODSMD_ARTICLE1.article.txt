### ALAN TRIPP Senior staff writer 
Students purchased at least 13
counterfeit tickets to Senior Casino
Night, held on Feb. 4, according to
Stanford Police Detective Katherine
Miller, who is currently conducting
an investigation into the incident.
Miller said the investigation "may
break in the next hour or in several
weeks."
When the people with counter
feit tickets got to the event (Casino
Night), they were informed that their
tickets were not valid," Miller said.
She refused to comment further be
cause she said it would "be detri
mental to the investigation."
"Friday night 20 students came
with counterfeit tickets that they had
paid $10 a piece for," said Margot
Nelson, director of student services
for the Stanford Alumni Association,
the group which sponsored Casino
Night. "We decided to let them in
because there were so few of them
and they had paid $10 for the tick
ets."
Most of the victims were reluctant
to talk to the Daily, though some
were willing to be quoted anonym
ously.
According to one fake ticket pur
chaser, "most people found out
about the tickets from flyers that
were posted at the Post Office, Tre
sidder Union and inside Old Union."
The flyers instructed purchasers to
call one of two numbers at specified
times on Thursday evening and Fri
day morning.
When the first reports of counter
feiting reached the alumni associa
tion, Nelson sent an aid to get one of
the flyers. "When we called, nobody
answered," said Nelson, who then
reported the matter to the police.
The numbers were traced to pay
telephones here on campus.
Students who had called at the
specified time were able to set up a
meeting to purchase the tickets.
Meyer Library was often the location
for these meetings. Victims said that
the man who sold them the tickets
was a "tall blond who wore a baseball
cap" and used the name of a Stanford
student who had nothing to do with
the scam.
Students were usually told that the
seller "originally planned to go (to
Casino Night) but had changed his
plans and would be away for the
weekend."
One victim, Dan Fowkes, did not
respond to the flyers but was actually
approached by the counterfeiter.
"He got my name from a waiting list
at Bowman Alumni House," said
Fowkes.
"At first he said he had two tickets.
Then some other people in the
house said they needed tickets too.
He went back out to his car and reap
peared with three more tickets which
he sold for $10 a piece.
"We were pretty much shocked by
the whole thing," said Tom Larkins,a
member of the Casino Night organiz
ing committee. He said most mem
bers of the committee didn't find out
about the scam until Friday after
noon. It was decided to admit those
people who had purchased the fake
tickets only after it was determined
that they could accommodate all the
fake ticket holders.
The police have yet to charge any

one formally with the crime although
they do have at least one suspect.
