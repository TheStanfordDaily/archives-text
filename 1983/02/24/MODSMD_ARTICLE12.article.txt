# East Palo Alto's economic woes overlap into politics
## 
### JEFF BIDDULPH Senior staff writer 
Across University Avenue
from the East Palo Alto Munici
pal Council building, East Palo
Alto's equivalent of city hall,
there is a large shopping center
which has been boarded up for
seven years.
"The owner just didn't have
the dollars to keep it open,"
said Henry Anthony, chairman
of the East Palo Alto Municipal
Council.
The only stores open in the
shopping center are a liquor
store and a laundromat.
The shopping center, lo
cated in the heart of East Palo
Alto, epitomizes the area's
plight. The two open stores are
among the few in this commu
nity of 19,500, 55 percent of
which are black, 30 percent of
which are Chicano and 10 per
cent of which are Asian Ameri
cans.
People work outside (of the
community), and they buy out
side," said Anthony.
And this is the central prob
lem for East Palo Alto, whose
unemployment is more than 20
percent among adult males
and more than 60 percent
among teenagers. The com
munity has few accesible jobs
ifrtd most of the money earned
is spent elsewhere. The area's
high crime rate scares away in
dustry, Anthony said, and the
lack of jobs contributes to
crime.
It's the circular dilemma of
many blighted communities
throughout the country, but
East Palo Alto's situation has an
added dimension: families
making $10,000 a year are living
in houses which now go for
$100,000 because the affluent
areas surrounding the com
munity drive up the price of the
homes.
Hit on one side by property
taxes which they are unable to
pay and on the other by in
creasing crime, many of the
poor are leaving the commu
nity. And those who remain are
scared.
"There are a lot of homeow
ners here who don't know
what to do," said resident Sally
Nakai. Nakai, a lapanese-
American who was put in an
internment camp during
World War 11, moved to East
Palo Alto 35 years ago. Partly in

response to what she saw as an
increasing dilemma, Nakai
helped organize the Weeks
Street neighbors, a group
which is trying to combat crime
in the area.
Just how bad is the crime? Lt.
John Wells of San Mateo Coun
ty's East Palo Alto substation,
said, "There's no question that
there's crime in East Palo Alto.
If you compared it to Atherton
it would seem like there's a rag
ing crime wave here. The
media has slighted East Palo
Alto, though. It's not a crime
ridden ghetto."
The majority of crimes are
residential or auto burglaries,
he said.
Many in the community say
the crime problem is exacer
bated by the fact that the com
munity is unincorporated and
has to depend on San Mateo
County for its police and fire
protection. Most of the police
officers who patrol the area are
not residents and have not de
veloped a rapport with com
munity members.
For example, Wells said,
there were two unprovoked
shootings last year of people in
East Palo Alto by police.

Anthony also stressed the
extent to which drugs and al
cohol affect the community.
"There's a tremendous prob
lem with drugs — like any
where else," he said. "But al
cohol is the bigger problem."
Anthony noted the relation
between alcohol abuse and
crime. The community has one
drug rehabilitation center and
one alcohol drop-in center.
The fact that the community
has such facilities is a sign of
improvement, however. The
recent organiztion of the
Weeks Street neighbors and a
number of other citizen's
groups, along with the con
struction of the Municipal
Council building, is tangible
evidence of the emergency of a
community sense which the
area never had before. This
sense of community is essen
tial for improving the area, ac
cording to Anthony.
"If the community becomes
aware of its problem together
maybe we can fight it to
gether," Anthony said.
The municipal council has
had some success in evoking
interest among industries to re
locate in the community, he

said. Plans have been drawn up
for the construciton of a
marina on East Palo Alto land,
and Anthony talks of possible
industrial expansion into a
number of empty lots.
Still, the majority of jobs in
the community are at nurseries
and wrecking yards.

"We'd have to level those
wrecking yards to make room
for industry," Anthony said.
East Palo Alto inhabitants
have been buffeted by a series
of crises ever ince the first
minorities beg? moving there
in the 19505. Because of a shift
in the boundaries between San
Mateo and Santa Clara County,

Palo Alto annexed a portion of
East Palo Alto in the early 19505.
Menlo Park has also annexed
some of the wealthier portions
of the community, and in 1958
East Palo Alto suffered through
a flood which destroyed many
homes in the area.
For many years open dis
crimination discouraged
blacks from renting or buying
land in the community, but by
the late 1950s a number of
blacks with secure, well-paying
jobs began moving into East
Palo Alto. Many of these blacks
eventually moved out of the
area, and were replaced by a
number of poorer, younger
minorities who now compose
most of the community's in
habitants.
A large portion of the com
munity sees only one way of
assuring that similar discrimi
nation and annexation never
recur: incorporation. The East
Palo Alto Citizen's Committee
on Incorporation (EPACCI)
began organizing a drive to
sway the community in favor of
incorporation in preparation
for a June 7 cityhood vote. In
corporation has been voted
down twice before.

But a group of increasingly
vocal community members
have organized the Coalition
Committee Against Incorpora
tion Now (CCAIN) to lobby
against cityhood.
The Weeks Street neighbors
are one component group of
CCAIN. Nakai, and many citi
zens, have very real fears about
the fate of the community if it
votes to incorporate. Nakai
said she does not think the city
has a sufficiently large tax base
to incorporate. She said she
fears that homeowners like
herself will have to finance the
city.
"There are many retired
people here and they don't
have any money to finance a
city," she said.
Anthony and two of the
other five members of the
municipal council, Gertrude

Wilks and Pat lohnson, agree
with Nakai and oppose im
mediate incorporation.
"Self-determination and
pride will not finance a city,"
Wilks said. "I represent people
on a fixed income and they
can't afford to pay for a city."
Anthony said, however, that
he does favor eventual incor
poration.
"We just have to develop the
community first," he said.
Omowale Satterwhite, a
member of EPACCI, said im
mediate incorporation is
necessary for the development
of the community. He pointed
out that three reports pub
lished by private consultants
have recommended im
mediate incorporation.
"We've been asked to wait
for the last decade" to incorpo
rate, Satterwhite said.

"The owner just didn't have
the dollars to keep it open,"
said Henry Anthony, chairman
of the East Palo Alto Municipal
Council.
The only stores open in the
shopping center are a liquor
store and a laundromat.
The shopping center, lo
cated in the heart of East Palo
Alto, epitomizes the area's
plight. The two open stores are
among the few in this commu
nity of 19,500, 55 percent of
which are black, 30 percent of
which are Chicano and 10 per
cent of which are Asian Ameri
cans.
People work outside (of the
community), and they buy out
side," said Anthony.
And this is the central prob
lem for East Palo Alto, whose
unemployment is more than 20
percent among adult males
and more than 60 percent
among teenagers. The com
munity has few accesible jobs
ifrtd most of the money earned
is spent elsewhere. The area's
high crime rate scares away in
dustry, Anthony said, and the
lack of jobs contributes to
crime.
It's the circular dilemma of
many blighted communities
throughout the country, but
East Palo Alto's situation has an
added dimension: families
making $10,000 a year are living
in houses which now go for
$100,000 because the affluent
areas surrounding the com
munity drive up the price of the
homes.
Hit on one side by property
taxes which they are unable to
pay and on the other by in
creasing crime, many of the
poor are leaving the commu
nity. And those who remain are
scared.
"There are a lot of homeow
ners here who don't know
what to do," said resident Sally
Nakai. Nakai, a lapanese-
American who was put in an
internment camp during
World War 11, moved to East
Palo Alto 35 years ago. Partly in

response to what she saw as an
increasing dilemma, Nakai
helped organize the Weeks
Street neighbors, a group
which is trying to combat crime
in the area.
Just how bad is the crime? Lt.
John Wells of San Mateo Coun
ty's East Palo Alto substation,
said, "There's no question that
there's crime in East Palo Alto.
If you compared it to Atherton
it would seem like there's a rag
ing crime wave here. The
media has slighted East Palo
Alto, though. It's not a crime
ridden ghetto."
The majority of crimes are
residential or auto burglaries,
he said.
Many in the community say
the crime problem is exacer
bated by the fact that the com
munity is unincorporated and
has to depend on San Mateo
County for its police and fire
protection. Most of the police
officers who patrol the area are
not residents and have not de
veloped a rapport with com
munity members.
For example, Wells said,
there were two unprovoked
shootings last year of people in
East Palo Alto by police.

Anthony also stressed the
extent to which drugs and al
cohol affect the community.
"There's a tremendous prob
lem with drugs — like any
where else," he said. "But al
cohol is the bigger problem."
Anthony noted the relation
between alcohol abuse and
crime. The community has one
drug rehabilitation center and
one alcohol drop-in center.
The fact that the community
has such facilities is a sign of
improvement, however. The
recent organiztion of the
Weeks Street neighbors and a
number of other citizen's
groups, along with the con
struction of the Municipal
Council building, is tangible
evidence of the emergency of a
community sense which the
area never had before. This
sense of community is essen
tial for improving the area, ac
cording to Anthony.
"If the community becomes
aware of its problem together
maybe we can fight it to
gether," Anthony said.
The municipal council has
had some success in evoking
interest among industries to re
locate in the community, he

said. Plans have been drawn up
for the construciton of a
marina on East Palo Alto land,
and Anthony talks of possible
industrial expansion into a
number of empty lots.
Still, the majority of jobs in
the community are at nurseries
and wrecking yards.

"We'd have to level those
wrecking yards to make room
for industry," Anthony said.
East Palo Alto inhabitants
have been buffeted by a series
of crises ever ince the first
minorities beg? moving there
in the 19505. Because of a shift
in the boundaries between San
Mateo and Santa Clara County,

Palo Alto annexed a portion of
East Palo Alto in the early 19505.
Menlo Park has also annexed
some of the wealthier portions
of the community, and in 1958
East Palo Alto suffered through
a flood which destroyed many
homes in the area.
For many years open dis
crimination discouraged
blacks from renting or buying
land in the community, but by
the late 1950s a number of
blacks with secure, well-paying
jobs began moving into East
Palo Alto. Many of these blacks
eventually moved out of the
area, and were replaced by a
number of poorer, younger
minorities who now compose
most of the community's in
habitants.
A large portion of the com
munity sees only one way of
assuring that similar discrimi
nation and annexation never
recur: incorporation. The East
Palo Alto Citizen's Committee
on Incorporation (EPACCI)
began organizing a drive to
sway the community in favor of
incorporation in preparation
for a June 7 cityhood vote. In
corporation has been voted
down twice before.

But a group of increasingly
vocal community members
have organized the Coalition
Committee Against Incorpora
tion Now (CCAIN) to lobby
against cityhood.
The Weeks Street neighbors
are one component group of
CCAIN. Nakai, and many citi
zens, have very real fears about
the fate of the community if it
votes to incorporate. Nakai
said she does not think the city
has a sufficiently large tax base
to incorporate. She said she
fears that homeowners like
herself will have to finance the
city.
"There are many retired
people here and they don't
have any money to finance a
city," she said.
Anthony and two of the
other five members of the
municipal council, Gertrude

Wilks and Pat lohnson, agree
with Nakai and oppose im
mediate incorporation.
"Self-determination and
pride will not finance a city,"
Wilks said. "I represent people
on a fixed income and they
can't afford to pay for a city."
Anthony said, however, that
he does favor eventual incor
poration.
"We just have to develop the
community first," he said.
Omowale Satterwhite, a
member of EPACCI, said im
mediate incorporation is
necessary for the development
of the community. He pointed
out that three reports pub
lished by private consultants
have recommended im
mediate incorporation.
"We've been asked to wait
for the last decade" to incorpo
rate, Satterwhite said.
