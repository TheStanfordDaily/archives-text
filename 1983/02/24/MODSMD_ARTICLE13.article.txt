## The 						Stanford Daily Winter quarter blues 
### 
We've noticed, have you? The heavy rains are
a little less frequent and sunny skies prevailed
over the three day weekend. We hope the im
proving weather will improve something else
we've noticed here — it's known by a number of
names — Winter Quarter Blues, Blahs and
Slump are a few that come to mind.
1 he malady generally sets in around midterms
and its intensity increases with each passing
paper, problem set and the sometimes unav
oidable all-nighter. As the quarter wears on
smiles fade and the friendly greeting we offer,
"Hi, how are you?" is met with a less than con
vincing "Fine."
Let's face it. Winter quarter is notoriously de
pressing. New perspective is what we needed to
overcome winter quarter blues. Perspective is
something with which everyone is familiar. We
use it to temper the stings of failure and to check
the self-satisfaction of success. Possession of
the "proper" perspective, it is promised, will
insulate us from the cold winds of life and
winter quarter.
We admit that adopting the proper perspective
and hanging onto it is easier said than done. But
armed with the hindsight of winter quarters
past, students, faculty and staff should be able
to make winter quarter more than an unpleasant

transition from fall to spring.
We do not mean to belittle the very real and
pressing problems that confront members of the
community. Time to reflect, relax and just plain
be seems non-existent. We struggle to balance
hectic academic schedules, jobs, and personal
lives. We worry about graduation, summer jobs
and tomorrow. In an attempt to seem self
sufficient and "together," friends and family,
those most eager to offer support, are shut
out. It is then we take the risk of falling into a
much deeper and destructive depression.
Recently the Bridge sponsored a Mental
Health Week designed to heighten community
awareness of problems of stress and depres
sion. While the week seems to have been a
success, many people have yet to admit the
importance of preventive mental health care.
There are many ways to deal with depression.
Friendships, family relationships, a personal
faith or some other sources of emotional sup
port are helpful in fighting the battle of the
blues.
Take time for yourself. Schedule 30 minutes
for a brisk run with a friend, a trip to Bud's or a
solitary walk around the lake; not just because
you deserve it but because you need it.
