# Parking: lots of problems
## 
### 
As the University's Planning Office conducts
its study of the problems of automobile parking
on campus, the old question resurfaces: park
ing at what price?
Stanford, from its conception, has been a
rural campus operating on the belief that the
heart of the University is for buildings and
greenery, not automobiles. The energy crisis
reinforced the view that transportation should
be by foot or bicycle whenever possible.
Now with the easing of the energy crisis and
with more buildings occupying the center of
campus, the demand for convenient parking
has reappeared. The problem as always is not a
place to park but a convenient place to park. As
anyone who has attempted to park near the
Oval after 9 a.m. knows, finding a space is about
as likely as receiving an invitation to lunch with
the Queen. Yet the back lot at Wilbur remains
nearly vacant.
We urge the University to take a careful,
long-term approach to this problem which
seems unlikely to disappear. Options such as a
parking garage should not be disregarded sim

ply because they do not make economic sense
in the short run. It is also important that the
aesthetic nature of the campus be preserved.
Solutions made of concrete may irreparably
damage the beauty of the University.
We feel the community can do much to help
the situation. The need to conserve energy has
not and will not vanish. Some of the parking
problem could be alleviated if only those who
really need long-term proximate parking used
the spaces near the center of campus. Walking,
bicycle riding and taking the Marguerite are all
good ways to get around. In particular, the Mar
guerite is an underused resource. Although rid
ership has increased since September, the bus
still operates below capacity. We urge the Uni
versity to maintain this service so that the Mar
guerite will become a reliable and accepted
form of transportation.
There is never a lack of opinions on the sub
ject of parking. As both the Planning Office and
the Committee on Parking and Transportation
study the subject, now is the time to make
suggestions for the future.
