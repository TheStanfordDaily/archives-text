## War internees need apology 
### 
Forty-one years ago this week, on
Feb. 19, 1942, President Franklin
Roosevelt signed Executive Order
9066, the document which allowed
the internment of over 120,000 per
sons of Japanese descent, two-thirds
of whom were American citizens,
during the Second World War.
The Japanese were interned be
cause they were supposedly a threat
to the security of the West Coast. But
this assertion had no basis in fact,
and was only promoted to cover the
real reasons for the forced intern
ment of over 70,000 American citi
zens. The facts are these:
• No Japanese-American was ever
convicted of espionage or covert acts
against the United States during
World War 11.
• More than 17,000 Japanese-
Americans fought for the United
States in both the European and
Pacific Theaters during the war, with
about 9000 of these serving in Europe
with the 442 nd Regimental Combat
Team, which was an all Japanese-
American unit. It should be noted
that the 442 nd fought in Italy and
France, and suffered total casualties
equaling 314 percent of the unit's
original strength (9500 Purple Hearts
and Oak Leaves for Second Purple
Hearts were earned by a unit of 3000
men). It has also been officially
stated that the Combat Team was
"the most decorated unit in Ameri
can military history for its size and
length of service."
• Of the total West Coast popula
tion of 120,000 Japanese-Americans
relocated, more than 25,000 of these
"potential saboteurs" were under 14
years of age.
• Even though we were at war
with both Italy and Germany,
Italian-Americans and German-
Americans were not interned. This
point is made because these groups,
being Caucasian, easily mixed into
society, and could have been very

dangerous as saboteurs or spies,
whereas the Japanese-Americans
were rather conspicuous and would
have been far less dangerous as
spies.
• Hawaii, which had a Japanese-
American population which was
about 40 percent of the total popula
tion, did not have a blanket intern
ment of its Japanese-American resi
dents. One of the West Coast argu
ments for internment was that the
Japanese-Americans had to be kept
off the coast due to military necessity
— but Hawaii was in a far more
strategic location than was anything
on the West Coast.
• Land owned by Japanese farmers
was coveted by other farmers in
California, and several of the groups
which either demanded or sup
ported internment were Caucasian
farming interests.
• Even though martial law was not
declared and the U.S. judicial system
was fully operational, no internee
was ever charged with a crime or
given a trial. This lack of due process
violated seven of the first ten
amendments to our Constitution,
which comprise the Bill of Rights.
The internment was a very trauma
tic time for Japanese-Americans and
is still a very emotional issue. The
bleak, dehumanizing nature of the
camps and the ignorance and racism
which the internees had to fight
returning to the West Coast after the
war are still painful memories.
At the present time the Japanese-
American Citizens League (JACL) is
attempting to get monetary repara
tions for the injustices done to the
Japanese-Americans during the war.
An appointed Commission on War
time Relocation and the Internment
of Civilians conducted hearings last
year and is supposed to report its
recommendations on redress to
Congress today.
It is estimated that the evacuees

lost nearly $400 million in the course
of internment. The JACL is seeking
$25,000 per internee as reparations
and a formal apology from the gov
ernment. Surely an apology is long
overdue (although former President
Gerald Ford did rescind Executive
Order 9066 during his term as a ges
ture), but the timingof a multi-billion
dollar reparations bill is questiona
ble.
Still, there is no doubt that redress,
too, should be forthcoming. My
grandfather, for example, lost his
dental practice in Oakland when he
was evacuated to the Central Utah
Relocation Center (called Topaz).
When he and his family returned to
his home in Oakland after the war, all
of his furniture and appliances were
missing. My grandfather was never
able to refurnish his Oakland home
because he got drafted by the army in
1947 (the ultimate irony), and so
stayed in the service for over 20
years.
At the very least, Japanese-
Americans can expect an apology
for, and an acknowledgement by the
government of, the injustice it per
petrated on the lapanese-Americans.
I hope that the issue of redress, re
gardless of whether or not any is
paid, will receive enough media at
tention to make America realize what
happened to the lapanese-
Americans. Realization and aware
ness are perhaps more important
than any money which may be
awarded. My greatest wish echoes
the words on the Manzanar Reloca
tion Center Historical Landmark
Plaque, which reads in part:
"May the injustices and humilia
tion suffered here as a result of hys
teria, racism and economic exploita
tion never emerge again."

I hope that the issue of redress, re
gardless of whether or not any is
paid, will receive enough media at
tention to make America realize what
happened to the lapanese-
Americans. Realization and aware
ness are perhaps more important
than any money which may be
awarded. My greatest wish echoes
the words on the Manzanar Reloca
tion Center Historical Landmark
Plaque, which reads in part:
"May the injustices and humilia

tion never emerge again."

Forty-one years ago this week, on
Feb. 19, 1942, President Franklin
Roosevelt signed Executive Order
9066, the document which allowed
the internment of over 120,000 per
sons of Japanese descent, two-thirds
of whom were American citizens,
during the Second World War.
The Japanese were interned be
cause they were supposedly a threat
to the security of the West Coast. But
this assertion had no basis in fact,
and was only promoted to cover the
real reasons for the forced intern
ment of over 70,000 American citi
zens. The facts are these:
• No Japanese-American was ever
convicted of espionage or covert acts
against the United States during
World War 11.
• More than 17,000 Japanese-
Americans fought for the United
States in both the European and
Pacific Theaters during the war, with
about 9000 of these serving in Europe
with the 442 nd Regimental Combat
Team, which was an all Japanese-
American unit. It should be noted
that the 442 nd fought in Italy and
France, and suffered total casualties
equaling 314 percent of the unit's
original strength (9500 Purple Hearts
and Oak Leaves for Second Purple
Hearts were earned by a unit of 3000
men). It has also been officially
stated that the Combat Team was
"the most decorated unit in Ameri
can military history for its size and
length of service."
• Of the total West Coast popula
tion of 120,000 Japanese-Americans
relocated, more than 25,000 of these
"potential saboteurs" were under 14
years of age.
• Even though we were at war
with both Italy and Germany,
Italian-Americans and German-
Americans were not interned. This
point is made because these groups,
being Caucasian, easily mixed into
society, and could have been very

dangerous as saboteurs or spies,
whereas the Japanese-Americans
were rather conspicuous and would
have been far less dangerous as
spies.
• Hawaii, which had a Japanese-
American population which was
about 40 percent of the total popula
tion, did not have a blanket intern
ment of its Japanese-American resi
dents. One of the West Coast argu
ments for internment was that the
Japanese-Americans had to be kept
off the coast due to military necessity
— but Hawaii was in a far more
strategic location than was anything
on the West Coast.
• Land owned by Japanese farmers
was coveted by other farmers in
California, and several of the groups
which either demanded or sup
ported internment were Caucasian
farming interests.
• Even though martial law was not
declared and the U.S. judicial system
was fully operational, no internee
was ever charged with a crime or
given a trial. This lack of due process
violated seven of the first ten
amendments to our Constitution,
which comprise the Bill of Rights.
The internment was a very trauma
tic time for Japanese-Americans and
is still a very emotional issue. The
bleak, dehumanizing nature of the
camps and the ignorance and racism
which the internees had to fight
returning to the West Coast after the
war are still painful memories.
At the present time the Japanese-
American Citizens League (JACL) is
attempting to get monetary repara
tions for the injustices done to the
Japanese-Americans during the war.
An appointed Commission on War
time Relocation and the Internment
of Civilians conducted hearings last
year and is supposed to report its
recommendations on redress to
Congress today.
It is estimated that the evacuees

lost nearly $400 million in the course
of internment. The JACL is seeking
$25,000 per internee as reparations
and a formal apology from the gov
ernment. Surely an apology is long
overdue (although former President
Gerald Ford did rescind Executive
Order 9066 during his term as a ges
ture), but the timingof a multi-billion
dollar reparations bill is questiona
ble.
Still, there is no doubt that redress,
too, should be forthcoming. My
grandfather, for example, lost his
dental practice in Oakland when he
was evacuated to the Central Utah
Relocation Center (called Topaz).
When he and his family returned to
his home in Oakland after the war, all
of his furniture and appliances were
missing. My grandfather was never
able to refurnish his Oakland home
because he got drafted by the army in
1947 (the ultimate irony), and so
stayed in the service for over 20
years.
At the very least, Japanese-
Americans can expect an apology
for, and an acknowledgement by the
government of, the injustice it per
petrated on the lapanese-Americans.
I hope that the issue of redress, re
gardless of whether or not any is
paid, will receive enough media at
tention to make America realize what
happened to the lapanese-
Americans. Realization and aware
ness are perhaps more important
than any money which may be
