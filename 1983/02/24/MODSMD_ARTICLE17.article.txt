# Message of mural explained
## 
### 
I'd like to kick a sick horse and talk
about the Zapata mural. I've heard
people say some awful things about
it. I've heard indignant Caucasians
talk of starting a white power theme
house (Casa Blanca) in response to
the mural's apparently racist mes
sage. And I've heard — in regards to
the (de)facement of the mural — that
"graffiti is a Mexican art form"; thus
the "vandals" who trashed the mural
were actually just over-zealous stu
dents expressing their appreciation
of Mexican cultural forms.
Like the Bible and the U.S. Con
stitution, the Zapata mural is vulner
able to incredible misinterpreta
tions. Pseudo-intellectual, pseudo
philosopher Susan Sontag once
wrote that in good art, there is always
a directness that entirely frees us
from the itch to interpret. But noth
ing could be further from the truth.
Interpretation is where it's at. I mean
without interpretation, what are we
English majors supposed to do all
day? Work?
The Zapata mural is entitled "A
Reaction to Violence and Institu
tional Racism in the Media." Next to
the mural there hangs a note; this
note explains the artist's intention
behind the mural. But of course the
artist's intention is only one interpre
tation of a work of art. Art, to use the
cliche, is different things to different
people. But as an English major at
prestigious Stanford University, I am
obviously extraordinarily well
qualified to interpret the mural's
meaning. Interpretation is my life.
I offer you now my interpretation
of the mural. Forgive me if some
points are not supported, but I am a
prisoner of the limitations of column
space.
First, let's look at the title of the
work. An anagram for the word "vio
lence" is "nice love." An anagram for
"the media" is "time head." The
women on either side of the mural
thus symbolize niceness and love,
while the effect of time on the

women has resulted in the middle
figure: the loss of face through time.
The genius displayed here is remark
able.
But at the same time, the middle
figure is also a marvelous visual pun
on the name Mariel Hemingway (or
"Mural" Hemingway). As the mural
was painted at about the same time
that the movie "Personal Best" was
released, the mural is also, obvi
ously, a subtle denigration of the
acting abilities of Hemingway's
granddaughter.
But at the same time, the mural
also cleverly represents Heaven,
Purgatory and Hell. Heaven is a beau
tiful, natural woman; Purgatory is
neither here nor there (therefore
faceless); Hell is old, tormented and
decrepit. The old woman in the
mural holds up a hand with only
three visible fingers; and what is the
number three but 1/222 of the sign
of the devil, 666!

One can see the Beatles message of the mural
clearly if one plays McCartney's 'Ebony and Ivory'
at 41.7 revolutions per minute. .. the song clearly
says, "Stop media exploitation and racial oppres
sion at Stanford."

But at the same time, the three
women also represent id, ego and
superego. The ego is blank without
the influences of the id (the evil old
woman) and the superego (the at
tractive young woman). The attrac
tive young woman represents the at
tractive morals and standards of a so
ciety.
But at the same time, I can also
prove beyond a shadow of a doubt
(though not here) that the three
women also represent: (1) General
Motors, Ford and Chrysler, (2) the
three letters of the word Cod, (3)
breakfast, lunch and dinner, (4)
China, the United States and Russia,
(5) Harvard, Yale and Princeton, (6)

ABC, CBS and NBC, (7) Adam, Eve
and the Serpent, (8) Ringo, George
and Paul, (9) a parody of Charlie's
Angels and (10) last but not least, the
Holy Trinity.
One can see the Beatles message
of the mural clearly if one plays
McCartney's "Ebony and Ivory"
backwards at 41.7 revolutions per
minute on a Panasonic turntable; at
this speed the song clearly says,
"Stop media exploitation and racial
oppression at Stanford." Oh yes, the
middle figure also represent a
young woman unable to "face"
growing old.
To continue, the first woman has
eight top teeth and six bottom teeth.
She has 42 eyelashes altogether and
two eyes. The elderly woman has 72
wrinkles on her face, one hand, two
eyes, three teeth and no eyelashes.
So we take 72 and subtract 42 and two
and eight and six, then we add three
and get 17: the number of the Seven

Deadly Sins plus the Ten Com
mandments!
I suppose that the red drops which
flow down from the top of the mural
are a tribute to Picasso's Guernica.
Or maybe they represent chili sauce.
In any event, I hope that my in
terpretation of the Zapata mural has
given readers a good idea of how one
can practically apply a humanities
major to everyday life. I almost for
got: the veins on the old woman's
hand represent either the family tree
of Moses or a roadmap of East
Tijuana. Why not?

of the mural clearly if one plays
McCartney's "Ebony and Ivory"
backwards at 41.7 revolutions per
minute on a Panasonic turntable; at
this speed the song clearly says,
"Stop media exploitation and racial
oppression at Stanford." Oh yes, the
middle figure also represent a
young woman unable to "face"
growing old.
To continue, the first woman has
eight top teeth and six bottom teeth.
She has 42 eyelashes altogether and
two eyes. The elderly woman has 72
wrinkles on her face, one hand, two
eyes, three teeth and no eyelashes.
So we take 72 and subtract 42 and two
and eight and six, then we add three
and get 17: the number of the Seven

Deadly Sins plus the Ten Com
mandments!
I suppose that the red drops which
flow down from the top of the mural
are a tribute to Picasso's Guernica.
Or maybe they represent chili sauce.
In any event, I hope that my in
terpretation of the Zapata mural has
given readers a good idea of how one
can practically apply a humanities
major to everyday life. I almost for
got: the veins on the old woman's
hand represent either the family tree
of Moses or a roadmap of East
Tijuana. Why not?

I'd like to kick a sick horse and talk
about the Zapata mural. I've heard
people say some awful things about
it. I've heard indignant Caucasians
talk of starting a white power theme
house (Casa Blanca) in response to
the mural's apparently racist mes
sage. And I've heard — in regards to
the (de)facement of the mural — that
"graffiti is a Mexican art form"; thus
the "vandals" who trashed the mural
were actually just over-zealous stu
dents expressing their appreciation
of Mexican cultural forms.
Like the Bible and the U.S. Con
stitution, the Zapata mural is vulner
able to incredible misinterpreta
tions. Pseudo-intellectual, pseudo
philosopher Susan Sontag once
wrote that in good art, there is always
a directness that entirely frees us
from the itch to interpret. But noth
ing could be further from the truth.
Interpretation is where it's at. I mean
without interpretation, what are we
English majors supposed to do all
day? Work?
The Zapata mural is entitled "A
Reaction to Violence and Institu
tional Racism in the Media." Next to
the mural there hangs a note; this
note explains the artist's intention
behind the mural. But of course the
artist's intention is only one interpre
tation of a work of art. Art, to use the
cliche, is different things to different
people. But as an English major at
prestigious Stanford University, I am
obviously extraordinarily well
qualified to interpret the mural's
meaning. Interpretation is my life.
I offer you now my interpretation
of the mural. Forgive me if some
points are not supported, but I am a
prisoner of the limitations of column
space.
First, let's look at the title of the
work. An anagram for the word "vio
lence" is "nice love." An anagram for
"the media" is "time head." The
women on either side of the mural
thus symbolize niceness and love,
while the effect of time on the

women has resulted in the middle
figure: the loss of face through time.
The genius displayed here is remark
able.
But at the same time, the middle
figure is also a marvelous visual pun
on the name Mariel Hemingway (or
"Mural" Hemingway). As the mural
was painted at about the same time
that the movie "Personal Best" was
released, the mural is also, obvi
ously, a subtle denigration of the
acting abilities of Hemingway's
granddaughter.
But at the same time, the mural
also cleverly represents Heaven,
Purgatory and Hell. Heaven is a beau
tiful, natural woman; Purgatory is
neither here nor there (therefore
faceless); Hell is old, tormented and
decrepit. The old woman in the
mural holds up a hand with only
three visible fingers; and what is the
number three but 1/222 of the sign
of the devil, 666!

One can see the Beatles message of the mural
clearly if one plays McCartney's 'Ebony and Ivory'
at 41.7 revolutions per minute. .. the song clearly
says, "Stop media exploitation and racial oppres
sion at Stanford."

But at the same time, the three
women also represent id, ego and
superego. The ego is blank without
the influences of the id (the evil old
woman) and the superego (the at
tractive young woman). The attrac
tive young woman represents the at
tractive morals and standards of a so
ciety.
But at the same time, I can also
prove beyond a shadow of a doubt
(though not here) that the three
women also represent: (1) General
Motors, Ford and Chrysler, (2) the
three letters of the word Cod, (3)
breakfast, lunch and dinner, (4)
China, the United States and Russia,
(5) Harvard, Yale and Princeton, (6)

ABC, CBS and NBC, (7) Adam, Eve
and the Serpent, (8) Ringo, George
and Paul, (9) a parody of Charlie's
Angels and (10) last but not least, the
Holy Trinity.
