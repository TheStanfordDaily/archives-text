## Grads earn tuition 
### 
Here we go with one more episode
in the continuing saga of "Put them
in their proper place." I am referring
to the remarks attributed to Univer
sity President Donald Kennedy re
garding undergraduate students
subsidizing graduate students
("Grant for homosexual students
proposed," Daily, Feb. 16).
Kennedy's statement that under
graduates here subsidize graduate
students through tuition payments
does not make sense in light of the
following:
• Graduate students who are not
teaching assistants or research assis
ants or recipients of other schol
arships pay their tuition out of their
pockets and in full.
. For those who are RAs, the tuition
is paid out of the research grants of
the faculty adviser.
• TAs have their tuition paid out of
their department's operating funds.
Bear in mind that these payments
are not giveaways but are in return
for the work put in by the TAs and
RAs. Furthermore, the work done by
the TAs will have to be done by
somebody. I do not think it is a
"make-work" position.
As for RAs, most of the research
done here (for which the University
is justifiably famous) is done by
graduate students working as RAs.
It is disheartening to see such un
justified and misleading statements
made casually, especially by the pres
ident of the University. If, indeed, it
is true that we are being subsidized
by undergraduate tuition payments,
maybe we could be enlightened with
some explanations. I, for one, would
really appreciate it.
