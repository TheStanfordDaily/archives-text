# Earthquake alert: quaking and shaking by the Bay
## 
### ELISE CHAPIN 
The ground begins to shake
and all of a sudden it seems as
though the world around you
is falling down. It's an
earthquake and there is noth
ing you can do except wait until
the shaking stops.
Although this may sound like
an alarmist statement, it is cer
tain that the Bay Area will expe
rience another large
earthquake in the near future,
according to Richard Jahns,
professor of geology and
applied earth sciences here
and Prof. Bruce Bolt of UC-
Berkeley. Jahns and Bolt wrote
a paper in which they stated
that a 50-50 chance exists that
the Bay Area will experience a
major quake in the next 17
years. They reached this con
clusion after considering past
events and calculating the en
ergy that has accumulated
along the fault line.
According to Haresh Shah,
professor of civil engineering
and co-director of the Blume
Earthquake Engineering Cen
ter, the Bay Area is a prime re
gion for earthquakes because
the Pacific and North American
geological plates meet along
the San Andreas Fault, west of

campus. The North American
plate, upon which most of the
continental United States lies,
is moving in a southeasterly
direction relative to the Pacific
plate.
These plates are moving in
opposite directions at a rate of
approximately two inches per
year. Because no major shift
has occurred since the 1906
movement, the land on either
side of the fault has moved al
most 13 feet while the land
right at the fault has not
moved.
At some point in time, the
fault will no longer be able to
withstand the pressure and the
two plates will slip, causing an
earthquake, Shah said.
Historically, the Bay Area has
experienced many tremors.
Shah said that the "most popu
lar" of the quakes, the one in
1906, ruptured the San Andreas
Fault from Santa Rosa to below
San Jose and had a magnitude
of 8.25 on the Richter scale.
The area around the Hay
ward Fault, on the eastern side

of the bay, experienced an
earthquake on June 10, 1836,
that measured 8.2. Again in
1868, tremors along the Hay
ward Fault were felt by resi
dents from Oakland to Warm
Springs. The quake, which had
a 7.5 magnitude, killed 30
people.
More recently, the Daly City
area experienced a quake in
1957 which had a magnitude of
5.3.
In 1980, the Livermore area
had successive quakes on Jan.
24 and 2b that measured 5.8
and 5.5, respectively. Junior
Laura Kang said she had been
taking an exam in high school
at the time the quakes hit and
that the exam had to be stop
ped.

The question asked now is
"when?" and not "if." Of the
many studies conducted, the
worst scenario predicts a
tremor that will register 8.3
along the San Andreas Fault
causing between 3000 and
10,000 deaths. There may also
be as many as 40,000 injuries

and possibly as much as $30 bil
lion in damages.
The worst time for an
earthquake to occur would be
during office hours because, in
general, office buildings are
less structurally sound than
homes.
Shah said, however, "The
University is doing the best job
it can with its sources in terms
of mitigating losses." The
whole Bay Area will be "in

trouble" when the next major
quake strikes, he added.
In an earthquake drill held
last year, Shah evaluated the
campus in terms of the damage
that would be caused by a
"fairly large event of 7.5 mag
nitude." The hypothetical
quake ran along the San An
dreas Fault from near Point
Reyes Station down to San
Jose.
Buildings such as the old
Chemistry Building, Encina
Commons, the old Engineer
ing Corner, the Geology
and the Career Planning and
Placement Center would suffer

the most damage, Shah deter
mined. Green Library, he said,
would be the safest building to
be in during a quake like the
one simulated last year.

He added that although the
walls in Trancos and Serra have
bent, that does not indicate a
basic structural problem and
denied that Stern Hall would
be one of the most dangerous
locations during a tremor.
Shah said he wanted to stress
the efficiency of the University
in earthquake preparedness.
University officials are taking
the weaker areas and reinforc
ing them which, is gradually
strengthening the campus
overall, Shah said.
The campus, although it
would be damaged, is one of
the most prepared sites in the
Bay Area. Shah said that only
"IBM is doing more work" be
cause their computers are so
vulnerable and they cannot af
ford to lose even a few days of
time. Other Silicon Valley
companies have earthquake
preparedness programs, but

"they're getting started late,"
Shah said.
The University presently has
a $60 million earthquake insur
ance plan. Although plans
vary, most companies charge
between $1.50 and $2.50 per
$1000 of value. Companies do
not usually insure for more
than five percent of the re
covery cost.
According to Shah, the
Blume Earthquake Engineering
Center on campus has tried to
make people more aware of
the potential dangers of an
earthquake and to help indi
viduals or companies obtain
more information about new
developments. Persons in the
affiliate program can visit the
center as well as talk to stu
dents.
Other Bay Area awarenes
groups include the Earthquake
Safety Organization (ESO)
which, among other services,
has a preparedness program
for city residents. According to
San lose officials, if a fire in one
of the taller buildings in the city
were to break out during an

earthquake, citizens could be
without city government ser
vices for as long as 72 hours. It
is therefore important for citi
zens to know how to behave
during an earthquake.
The organization also per
forms home inspections for
safety. Some graduates of the
University's engineering pro
grams serve as consultants and
perform the actual inspec
tions. According to Ron Ma
son, production manager of
the ESO, inspectors check out
a house beginning in the
basement and working up, ex
plaining to residents the
hazards they may face in criti
cal times.
Mason said, however, that
"the vast majority (of the
people) are unprepared. Most
don't even have a flashlight or a
fire extinguisher." He said
"apathy and waiting around to
see what happens are national
characteristics" but recent dis
asters, such as the large rain
storms, have made people
more aware of the potential
danger they face.
Although no one can predict
exactly when this disaster will
occur, the prediction that it will
occur should make Bay Area
residents more aware of the
dangers they will face.
