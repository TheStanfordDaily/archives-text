# An irreverent Dizzy Gillespie jazzes SF
## 
### LUKE COLE 
A subdued crowd waited through
five relatively uninspired songs from
jazz guitarist )oe Pass in the Fairmont
Hotel Room last Wednesday night, pa
tiently anticipating the evenings head
liner, Dizzy Gillespie. When Gillespie
made his grand entrant e, he surprised
quite a few members of the audience
who were expec ting a sedate evening
of jazz.
Strutting on stage in a casual shirt and
slacks, sharply contrasting |o<> Pass'
tuxedo and the plush, formal decor of
tfie Venetian room, Dizzy engaged in a
little one-sided b.inter with the audi
ence. His three-man band set up and
then swung into "Con Alma," a latin
influenced tune, accompanied by Pass.
John Birks (a.k.a. Dizzy) Gillespie has
been a leader in the jazz movement
since the 19305, integrating his Afro-
Cuban rhythms into the mainstream of
jazz. One of the first "Be Bop" artists,
Gillespie made this distinctive style fa
mous during the '40s and '50s. Now
nearing the age of 66, Gillespie is still
full of playful vigor. Gillespie is known
for his irreverent performing style
the press release put it most tactfully,
alluding to the "broad streak of exoti
cism" in his work
Dizzy Gillespie did not disappoint
anyone who came with this in mind:
from the opening song throughout the
evening, he hopped about the stage,
joked with the audience and his

band-members, shook the spit from his
trumpet, and generally had a good
time. For those who expected to be se
dately entertained, it may have been a
shock, but still an interesting evening.
After "Con Alma," |oe Pass left the
stage (which did not disappoint me),
and Gillespie and his back up band
(piano, bass guitar and drums) moved
into an ad-libbed version of Argenti
nian composer Lalo Schiffrin's "Un
icorn." Dizzy's trademark bullfrog
cheeks were astounding, threatening
to pop as his trumpet warbled through
the song. I was struck by the contrast
between the sophistication and re
finement of the Count Basie Orchestra,
the last act to play the Venetian Room,
and the free-wheeling happy-go-lucky
style of Gillespie. The band's compli
cated jam shifted gears into Don Red
mond's "Gee Baby, Ain't I Good To
Ya?" with Dizzy on vocals, rasping out
the words and stomping his feet to the
beat.
Gillespie then said, "I'd like to intro
duce my band. Mr. Howell, this is Mr.
Purdie. Mr. I'urdie, this is Mr. Enriquez.
Mr. Enriquez, this is Mr. Howell." After
these antics, the band slipped into a
Gillespie classic, "A Night In Tunisia,"
which brought enthusiastic applause
from the audience. After the song, a
long Afro-Cuban jam featuring a bass
solo, Gillespie really introduced the
band: Michael Howell on bass, Bernard
Purdue on drums, and Bobby Enriquez

on the piano. Not content with simple
introductions, Dizzy introduced the
lone white member of the band as from
Nairobi, Kenya, and one of the black
members as from Seoul, Korea.
"Memories of You," a tribute to the
late great Fubie Blake, followed. Bobby
Enriquez had an outstanding Art
Tatum-like solo on the piano that fea
tured some great riffs and flashing fin
gers. Enriquez rolled and hanged up
and down the keyboard in a fantastic
improvisation, and made this lively
piece the highlight of the evening.
Next came a song "written about a
town near here â€” Didi Wa Didi,
California."
"Didi Wa Didi" started out with a pro
longed conga jam by Dizzy, and then
broke into an energetic trumpet piece,
with Bernard Purdie pounding away on
the drums, loe Pass was called back up
on stage for what proved to be the final
number of the night, a trumpet/guitar
duet called "Tanga," in which Dizzy
and Joe tried to outdo each other with
the delicacy of their sounds.
In all, it was an interesting evening.
Those of us who came prepared with
some knowledge of Dizzy Gillespie's
unconventional style came away satis
fied, while those in the audience who
expected another Count Basie left con
tused and possibly disappointed. Dizzy
was Dizzy, and if you like that, you
would have enjoyed the show.
