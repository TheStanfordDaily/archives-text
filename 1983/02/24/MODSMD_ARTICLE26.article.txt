'The Pirates
of Penzance'

The Pirates of Penzance is a
charmless bulldozer of a musi
cal film that bellows mer
cilessly for two hours in Dolby
Stereo; you stagger out after
wards, your hands over your
ears and your head pounding.
Did the director, Wilford Loach
■ (also credited with the
screenplay) and the producer,
Joseph Papp, think that if they
ripped up the volume no one
would notice the clumsy edit
ing, the ugly, unimaginative
sets, or the fact that almost
everyone in the cast seems to
be playing for the balcony of an
enormous Broadway theater'
This inexorable aural and visual
assault may actually work as a
cover-up strategy: the audi
ence I saw the movie with
cheered and applauded after
each number as if at a stage
show. But in fact the stage
! show of which this is an adapta
tion — produced by Papp in
1 New York, directed by Loach,
* and featuring most of the prin
ciple performers in the movie
* — was much cleverer and fun
nier than the screen version.
Though far from subtle, it was
* brisk, good-natured and win
ning in a hearty, juvenile man
ner; those of us who were sick
to death of watching reveren
tial D'Oyly Carte productions
of Gilbert and Sullivan were re
lieved to see parodies of a
wholly different set of conven
; tions out of American musical
•comedy, silent film comedy
and swashbuckling adventure
pictures. The Papp Pirates
like a revue, so the fact
-that all the performances we
ren't equally appealing and the
staging was uneven didn't

dampen the evening. To see
the rousing old warhorse
scrubbed down and freshly
saddled was a cheering experi
ence.
But this filmed Pirates is so
heavy-handed and carries so
much baggage — awkward
cardboard cut-out sets, over
rehearsed comedy routines,
caricatures worked out for the
stage and worked up again as if
for a revival — that it comes off
looking less spontaneous than
if the filmmakers had actually
gone back to D'Oyly Carte. I
kept thinking of the excerpts
from Broadway musicals that
Ed Sullivan used to feature on
his TV show in the '50s and '60s
— the camera always seemed
too close, intrusive and yet
paradoxically the effect was
uncomfortably distancing. Pi
rates also resembles the very
early movie musicals, when
shows like Ziegfeld's Whoopee
were lifted off the New York
stage and plopped uncere
moniously into studio sets with
hardly a nuance changed —
except that Loach doesn't use a
static camera. (He doesn't
know what the hell to do with
his camera, but he certainly
moves it around. He even takes
a stab at a Busby Berkeley aerial
set-up, and the final shot, of
bowler hats floating through
the painted sky, is out of Ber
keley too — it recalls the luna
tic, surrealistic "Polka Dot Bal
let" from The Gang's All Here.
Presumably that's why Loach
included it — God knows it
doesn't come out of the script.)
Loach doesn't pretend he's
not filming a stage show, but
his stylistic decisions con
tradict each other. The movie
begins with a set of a Victorian
town, where a peaceful,
church-going community is in
vaded by a mock-up of a pirate
ship and thus the opening

number of the operetta. But
because the village is obviously
built for a stage, we don't have
the amusement of seeing how
an audience of Gilbert and Sul
livan's time might really have
responded to Pirates (as we do,
say, when Olivier begins his
Henry V on the stage of the
Globe Theater in the late 16th
century) — and in any case, this
modernized, Americanized
production, with its rock star
hero and heroine (Rex Smith
and Linda Ronstadt), would
hardly be appropriate in this
milieu. Furthermore, the pirate
ship doesn't actually glide on
stage: the townspeople see it
in the space where the audi
ence ought to be, and it is an
nounced by a title credit, as if
these 19th century chur
chgoers had been interrupted
at their Sunday morning ritual
to watch a movie. If you can
manage to sort out that stylistic
jumble, you can look forward
to the climax of the second act,
when the two adversary crews
— pirates and policemen —
crash through the set of an
amateur production of H.M.S.
Pinafore and begin dueling
with the conductor.
Most of the performers are
embarrassing to watch:
George Rose, made up for a
masquerade ball as Major-
General Stanley, adolescent
faced Rex Smith as Frederic,
Tony Azito as a Keystone Cop
Sergeant, Louise Gold as Edith
(she looks like a cross between
Mary Steenburgen and Melissa
Manchester, and belts out her
songs in someone else's voice
— Alexandra Korey's), and
Linda Ronstadt as the ingenue,
Mabel. Ronstadt has the musi
cal proficiency, at least, to
parody her soprano role with
some success, especially on
her first entrance, and though


Rex Smith, Kevin Kline and Angela Lansbury in The Pirates of Penzance
her take-off on maidenly mod
esty is strictly junior high
school level, she's fine when
she relaxes. In the second-act
finale, her modest, friendly
smile is an oasis in this scream
ing, hyperbolic desert of a
musical. Angela Lansbury, a
brilliant musical comedy ac
tress who also knows how to
tone down for the camera, is
wasted as Ruth, the "piratical
maid-of-all-work." Only Kevin
Kline, in the showpiece role of
the Pirate King, really trans
cends the execrable produc
tion. His rich, resonant bass
baritone scores affectionate
satiric points against every
leading man in American
operetta from Dennis King to
Howard Keel; physically, he
sends up Douglas Fairbanks
and Errol Flynn, though his
glorious curly mop and dreamy

eyes suggest a distinctly latter
day swashbuckling hero — the
kind who might have a few
loose joints hidden away in his
scabbard. Kline draws on an
entertainingly eclectic reper
toire of pop cultural targets; at
one point in his big "I Am a
Pirate King" song, he croons
through a megaphone and
then transforms it into a trum
pet, using his other hand as a
mute. Kline's entire perform
ance is like his best scenes in
Sophie's Choice (his comic
scenes) — it's inspiredschtick.

'By Design'
Like Kevin Kline, the Cana
dian actor Saul Rubinek takes
obvious, infectious joy in play
ing comedy. He had a great
moment in Ticket to Heaven in
which he kept his sanity in a

Moonie training camp by de
livering a stand-up comedy
routine, and he's far and away
the best thing in the new By
Design. He's cast as Terry, an
aggressively heterosexual pho
tographer — a wolf — whose
advances are encouraged by
his lesbian employer (Patty
Duke Austin) because she
wants to get pregnant and raise
a child with her lover (Sara
Botsford). ("By Design" is the
name of the company the two
women — fashion designers —
run.) Rubinek, who has quir
kily perfect timing and surpris
ing modulations in his line
readings, gives Terry a bastard
edge beneath his endearing
boyishness, so that we can be
lieve he's a first-rate photo
grapher who can't keep his
hands off the models and turns
on a crude, cruel sexual energy
to get them excited while he

shoots them. When he's hurt,
he pouts like a sensitive child
with the slou-burn patience to
brood over his injuries for a
long time, but he's also emo
tionally generous when the
women appeal to him as a
friend, and he turns out to have
the capacity tor a romantic rela
tionship, too. Rubinek makes
all the elements in Terry's per
sonality work; it's a lovely
piece of character acting.
Aside from Rubinek,
though, and the touching au
thenticity of Sara Botstord —
who looks like a taller, earthier
red-haired Susan Sarandon,
and who had one terrific scene
in Still of the Night — there
isn't much to recommend the
picture. The machinations of a
pair of gay women to find a
baby is a smashing idea for a
comedy, and both Claude Jut
ra's direction and the script he

wrote with )oe Wiesenfeld and
David Eames are uncondes
cending and sweetly affirma
tive; moreover the prolifera
tion of pregnancies toward the
end is a plot twist worthy of
Bertrand Blier's movies. But
Patty Duke Austin mugs her
way out of any audience sym
pathy — her idea of acting is to
wrinkle up her nose and dip
into her tiny bank of TV sitcom
facial expressions. (When she
receives tragic news, she
clucks her tongue and shakes
her head as if she had just
landed a bowling ball in the
gutter.) And Claude )utra
doesn't have the right equip
ment for directing farce: the
physical comedy lacks rhythm
and the bad, broad lines just lie
there. I'm not sure what's hap
pened to Jutra. His 1972 My
Uncle Antonie (the best film
ever made in Canada), was
comparable to Renoir and the
finest Trufaut, but he hasn't re
ally made a good picture since,
though his second,
Kamouraska, set in turn-of
the-century Quebec, had a
nostalgic elegance and was
superbly shot. The photogra
phy for By Design is credited to
the gifted French cameraman
Jean Boffety, whose work in
cludes Robert Altman's
Thieves Like Us and Claude
Sautet's Vincent, Francois,
Paul and the Others, but it's

bright and ugly, like daytime
TV. And the acting of the sup
porting players ranges from
mediocre to incompetent, as if
Jutra had forgotten how to cast
and direct actors as well as how
to make a movie look decent.
Of all great filmmakers, Jutra
may have had the most mys
terious fall.

'Without a Trace'
In the monumentally unin
teresting Without a Trace, the
six-year-old son of a pair of En
glish instructors, Susan and
Graham Selky (Kate Nelligan
and David Dukes), now es
tranged, disappers mysteri
ously. The movie, adapted by
Beth Gutcheon from her novel
Still Missing (a fictionalization
of a real news story), describes
both the development of the
case, under police detective Al
Menetti (Judci Hirsch), and the
way in which Susan deals with
the stunning mixture of loss
and hope. In his first try as a
director, Stanley R. )affe
chooses the Ordinary People
classy-melodrama style: every
thing is carefully measured,
banal details are focused on
and enshrined, and significant
moments are underscored in
red so that wo know exactly
how to read them. (When
Graham tells Menetti that he
spent the afternoon with a stu

dent, Susan's eyes tell us that
Graham's relations with his
students broke up their mar
riage; Susan's obsessive play
ing of the piano signals us that
she is in crisis; etc.) Kate Nelli
gan brought off extra
ordinarily complex emotional
scenes in Dracula and Eye of
the Needle and on television in
Measure for Measure, but her
performance in this movie is
prim, humorless and unimagi
native — like the desiccated
portraits of grief we have had
from Mary Tyler Moore (in Or
dinary People) and Carol Bur
nett (in the TV movie Friendly
Fire). She is so self-conscious
that Without a Trace becomes a
movie about an actress who
has honed her skill at control
ling emotion on camera to a
fine point. (She also looks and
sounds distressingly like the
precise, off-putting character
actress Carmen Matthews.) Of
course, the material is far from
flexible — David Dukes, an in
telligent stage actor, gets
caught in it, and |udd Hirsch's
performance, though it has
timing and color and wit,
seems like a pointless exercise.
Hirsch is good in everything he
does — so good that he ends
up exposing the inadequacy of
threadbare pictures like this
one and Ordinary People. I
wish someone would write a
film role worthy of his talents.
