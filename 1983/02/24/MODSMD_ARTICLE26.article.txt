'The Pirates
of Penzance'

The Pirates of Penzance is a
charmless bulldozer of a musi
cal film that bellows mer
cilessly for two hours in Dolby
Stereo; you stagger out after
wards, your hands over your
ears and your head pounding.
Did the director, Wilford Loach
■ (also credited with the
screenplay) and the producer,
Joseph Papp, think that if they
ripped up the volume no one
would notice the clumsy edit
ing, the ugly, unimaginative
sets, or the fact that almost
everyone in the cast seems to
be playing for the balcony of an
enormous Broadway theater'
This inexorable aural and visual
assault may actually work as a
cover-up strategy: the audi
ence I saw the movie with
cheered and applauded after
each number as if at a stage
show. But in fact the stage
! show of which this is an adapta
tion — produced by Papp in
1 New York, directed by Loach,
* and featuring most of the prin
ciple performers in the movie
* — was much cleverer and fun
nier than the screen version.
Though far from subtle, it was
* brisk, good-natured and win
ning in a hearty, juvenile man
ner; those of us who were sick
to death of watching reveren
tial D'Oyly Carte productions
of Gilbert and Sullivan were re
lieved to see parodies of a
wholly different set of conven
; tions out of American musical
•comedy, silent film comedy
and swashbuckling adventure
pictures. The Papp Pirates
like a revue, so the fact
-that all the performances we
ren't equally appealing and the
staging was uneven didn't

dampen the evening. To see
the rousing old warhorse
scrubbed down and freshly
saddled was a cheering experi
ence.
But this filmed Pirates is so
heavy-handed and carries so
much baggage — awkward
cardboard cut-out sets, over
rehearsed comedy routines,
caricatures worked out for the
stage and worked up again as if
for a revival — that it comes off
looking less spontaneous than
if the filmmakers had actually
gone back to D'Oyly Carte. I
kept thinking of the excerpts
from Broadway musicals that
Ed Sullivan used to feature on
his TV show in the '50s and '60s
— the camera always seemed
too close, intrusive and yet
paradoxically the effect was
uncomfortably distancing. Pi
rates also resembles the very
early movie musicals, when
shows like Ziegfeld's Whoopee
were lifted off the New York
stage and plopped uncere
moniously into studio sets with
hardly a nuance changed —
except that Loach doesn't use a
static camera. (He doesn't
know what the hell to do with
his camera, but he certainly
moves it around. He even takes
a stab at a Busby Berkeley aerial
set-up, and the final shot, of
bowler hats floating through
the painted sky, is out of Ber
keley too — it recalls the luna
tic, surrealistic "Polka Dot Bal
let" from The Gang's All Here.
Presumably that's why Loach
included it — God knows it
doesn't come out of the script.)
Loach doesn't pretend he's
not filming a stage show, but
his stylistic decisions con
tradict each other. The movie
begins with a set of a Victorian
town, where a peaceful,
church-going community is in
vaded by a mock-up of a pirate
ship and thus the opening

number of the operetta. But
because the village is obviously
built for a stage, we don't have
the amusement of seeing how
an audience of Gilbert and Sul
livan's time might really have
responded to Pirates (as we do,
say, when Olivier begins his
Henry V on the stage of the
Globe Theater in the late 16th
century) — and in any case, this
modernized, Americanized
production, with its rock star
hero and heroine (Rex Smith
and Linda Ronstadt), would
hardly be appropriate in this
milieu. Furthermore, the pirate
ship doesn't actually glide on
stage: the townspeople see it
in the space where the audi
ence ought to be, and it is an
nounced by a title credit, as if
these 19th century chur
chgoers had been interrupted
at their Sunday morning ritual
to watch a movie. If you can
manage to sort out that stylistic
jumble, you can look forward
to the climax of the second act,
when the two adversary crews
— pirates and policemen —
crash through the set of an
amateur production of H.M.S.
Pinafore and begin dueling
with the conductor.
Most of the performers are
embarrassing to watch:
George Rose, made up for a
masquerade ball as Major-
General Stanley, adolescent
faced Rex Smith as Frederic,
Tony Azito as a Keystone Cop
Sergeant, Louise Gold as Edith
(she looks like a cross between
Mary Steenburgen and Melissa
Manchester, and belts out her
songs in someone else's voice
— Alexandra Korey's), and
Linda Ronstadt as the ingenue,
Mabel. Ronstadt has the musi
cal proficiency, at least, to
parody her soprano role with
some success, especially on
her first entrance, and though
