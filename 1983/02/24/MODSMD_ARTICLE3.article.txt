# Heroin linked to Parkinson's disease

### JENNIFER SEYMOUR 
A byproduct created in a heroin-making pro
cess has led to a discovery by Stanford re
searchers that may help doctors gain a better
understanding of the cause of the incurable Par
kinson's disease.
|. William Langston, an assistant professor of
neurology at Stanford, Philip Ballard and lames
Tetrud have uncovered a toxin that, when in
jected, produces the same symptoms as Parkin
son's disease — stiffness of body, tremors and
poor coordination — and also effects the same
brain cells that Parkinson's disease destroys.
"There's a lot of medical significance to this
find," said Langston, because the toxin will allow
researchers to create animal models of Parkin
son's, if it has the same effect on animals as it
does on people.
This would allow scientists to study the cellular
effects of the disease more closely. And, accord
ing to Langston "the results from preliminary
tests in animals are very encouraging."
"Also, Parkinson's only kills a particular group
of neurons, those associated with motor coordi
nation. Nobody knows why this is," said
Langston. "Now we may be able to determine
why only these cells are vulnerable and die."
The toxin, was found to create the same effects
as Parkinson's disease when a young heroin
user, diagnosed as a catatonic schizophrenic,
was admitted to the Santa Clara Valley Medical
Center where Langston works.

"It didn't take much time to see that he was not
mentally ill," said Langston. "He was almost fro
zen like stone, but he was perfectly normal in
side. He could write; he wanted to know what
was going on," said Langston.
When several more cases of heroin users with
the same symptoms were discovered, Langston
and colleagues quickly surmised that "bad he
roin" was the villain. "We put out a warning soon
after this — that was last summer," he said.
"It was like a detective story," said Langston.
"Another case of these effects was then reported
to us, in a Stanford grad student who had been
making his own Demarol. He made a bad batch
and it did the same thing to him." (Demarol is the
clinical version of street heroin.)
The student subsequently committed suicide.
During an autopsy, doctors discovered that the
heroin had the exact same effect on brain cells as
Parkinson's disease has, explained Langston.
Only those cells in the substantia nigra, the part
of the brain associated with coordination, had
been damaged.
The student had kept careful notes about his
chemistry processes, explained Langston. From
these doctors hypothesized that the unlucky
grad student had mistakenly produced a toxin
closely related to the chemical he was trying to
fabricate.
"He probably added too much heat or too
much acid, which created MPTP instead of the
desired MPPP," Langston said.

Langston and colleagues soon realized that it
was the MPTP by-product inducing the "syn
thetic" Parkinson's disease in heroin users.
"There's a lot of irony to this story," according
to Langston. "Often in a find like this, you test
theories in animals and people say, 'well that's
fine, but what are the applications to humans?'
But in this case, the drug was tested in humans
first, by accident. We know what the effects in
humans are already."
Based on their current work, doctors believe
that neurons, or brain cells, must produce or
accumulate a toxin similar to MPTP within the
affected cells of the brain. "We know the
neurons make a lot of by-products that get stored
in the cytoplasm," Langston said. "Our theory is
that these may become toxic over time, or may
be toxic to begin with and accumulate with
time."
This would explain why Parkinson's plagues
primarily the old. "You need to have damaged
over 50 percent of the brain cells in your coordi
nation center to get the symptoms of Parkin
son's," said Langston. "It takes time for the toxin
to accumulate and kill that many cells."
Although there is no known cure for Parkin
son's, doctors treat the symptoms with
1-dopamine. This replaces the dopamine that to
xins have removed from coordination center
brain cells, and allows patients more freedom of
movement, according to Langston.
"The most interesting part of the
whole story came when we had fig
ured out everything and were about
to ask for publication," said
Langston. "We knew that a bad batch
of heroin, containing MPTP, had

been sold and caused the effects —
the whole thing. We just needed a
reference for the chemical reaction
producing the MPTP, for our paper.
"We went to the stacks in the
chemistry library to get the article
where the reaction was first de
scribed. But when we went to this
original source, we found it had been
very carefully razor-bladed out. It

was kind of eery. We had sort of
known this person was out there,
who had made this bad batch of
drug. But here we had come to evi
dence that he was really there. We
felt like we were meeting the man
who had done it,"he said.
Langston said that police believe
the person who cut out the article in
the chemistry journal was associated
with the first batch of heroin.

"Also, Parkinson's only kills a particular group
of neurons, those associated with motor coordi
nation. Nobody knows why this is," said
Langston. "Now we may be able to determine
why only these cells are vulnerable and die."
The toxin, was found to create the same effects
as Parkinson's disease when a young heroin
user, diagnosed as a catatonic schizophrenic,
was admitted to the Santa Clara Valley Medical
Center where Langston works.

"It didn't take much time to see that he was not
mentally ill," said Langston. "He was almost fro
zen like stone, but he was perfectly normal in
side. He could write; he wanted to know what
was going on," said Langston.
When several more cases of heroin users with
the same symptoms were discovered, Langston
and colleagues quickly surmised that "bad he
roin" was the villain. "We put out a warning soon
after this — that was last summer," he said.
"It was like a detective story," said Langston.
"Another case of these effects was then reported
to us, in a Stanford grad student who had been
making his own Demarol. He made a bad batch
and it did the same thing to him." (Demarol is the
clinical version of street heroin.)
The student subsequently committed suicide.
During an autopsy, doctors discovered that the
heroin had the exact same effect on brain cells as
Parkinson's disease has, explained Langston.
Only those cells in the substantia nigra, the part
of the brain associated with coordination, had
been damaged.
The student had kept careful notes about his
chemistry processes, explained Langston. From
these doctors hypothesized that the unlucky
grad student had mistakenly produced a toxin
closely related to the chemical he was trying to
fabricate.
"He probably added too much heat or too
much acid, which created MPTP instead of the
desired MPPP," Langston said.

Langston and colleagues soon realized that it
was the MPTP by-product inducing the "syn
thetic" Parkinson's disease in heroin users.
"There's a lot of irony to this story," according
to Langston. "Often in a find like this, you test
theories in animals and people say, 'well that's
fine, but what are the applications to humans?'
But in this case, the drug was tested in humans
first, by accident. We know what the effects in
humans are already."
Based on their current work, doctors believe
that neurons, or brain cells, must produce or
accumulate a toxin similar to MPTP within the
affected cells of the brain. "We know the
neurons make a lot of by-products that get stored
in the cytoplasm," Langston said. "Our theory is
that these may become toxic over time, or may
be toxic to begin with and accumulate with
time."
This would explain why Parkinson's plagues
primarily the old. "You need to have damaged
over 50 percent of the brain cells in your coordi
nation center to get the symptoms of Parkin
son's," said Langston. "It takes time for the toxin
to accumulate and kill that many cells."
Although there is no known cure for Parkin
son's, doctors treat the symptoms with
1-dopamine. This replaces the dopamine that to
xins have removed from coordination center
brain cells, and allows patients more freedom of
movement, according to Langston.
"The most interesting part of the
whole story came when we had fig
ured out everything and were about
to ask for publication," said
Langston. "We knew that a bad batch
of heroin, containing MPTP, had

been sold and caused the effects —
the whole thing. We just needed a
reference for the chemical reaction
producing the MPTP, for our paper.
"We went to the stacks in the
chemistry library to get the article
where the reaction was first de
scribed. But when we went to this
original source, we found it had been
very carefully razor-bladed out. It

was kind of eery. We had sort of
known this person was out there,
who had made this bad batch of
drug. But here we had come to evi
dence that he was really there. We
felt like we were meeting the man
who had done it,"he said.
Langston said that police believe
the person who cut out the article in
the chemistry journal was associated
with the first batch of heroin.
A byproduct created in a heroin-making pro
cess has led to a discovery by Stanford re
searchers that may help doctors gain a better
understanding of the cause of the incurable Par
kinson's disease.
|. William Langston, an assistant professor of
neurology at Stanford, Philip Ballard and lames
Tetrud have uncovered a toxin that, when in
jected, produces the same symptoms as Parkin
son's disease — stiffness of body, tremors and
poor coordination — and also effects the same
brain cells that Parkinson's disease destroys.
"There's a lot of medical significance to this
find," said Langston, because the toxin will allow
researchers to create animal models of Parkin
son's, if it has the same effect on animals as it
does on people.
This would allow scientists to study the cellular
effects of the disease more closely. And, accord
ing to Langston "the results from preliminary
tests in animals are very encouraging."
"Also, Parkinson's only kills a particular group
of neurons, those associated with motor coordi
nation. Nobody knows why this is," said
Langston. "Now we may be able to determine
