# NCAA declares Georgia star ineligible
## Walker signs with USFL franchise 
### 
From staff and wire reports
Herschel Walker became an instant millionaire yes
terday, signing what may be pro football's most lucrative
contract with the fledgling United States Football
League, only hours after being declared ineligible to
play at Georgia in his senior season.
' He's a millionaire right now/' Jack Manton, Walker's
agent, said outside Walker's off-campus apartment in
Athens. "It's the highest contract ever in pro football
history by far."
Walker's signing of a three-year contract with the New
lersey Generals followed five days of controversy which
prompted an investigation by the National Collegiate
Athletic Association.
The NCAA wanted to know if reports were true that
the Heisman Trophy-winning tailback had signed with
the USFL team last Thursday in violation of the NCAA's
rules on eligibility.
He had and, on Wednesday, was forced to curtail his
collegiate career to three years.
Manton, who disclosed the length of the agreement,
said other details of the contract "will never be re
leased," but said it included bonus money, a year's
salary in advance, investments in tax-free municipal
bonds and could include a loan. Reports said Walker had
been offered $16.5 million over a long term.
The National Football League's highest paid player is
running back Walter Payton on the Chicago Bears, who
receives $700,000 per year.
"Herschel has done more for professional football
players than all the unions striking and debating that's
ever taken place," said Manton. "His contract will be the
guideline for the future."
College coaches across the country reacted angrily to
Walker's signing and some immediately barred repre
sentatives of the new league from their campuses.
Their main gripe centered around the possibility that
Walker may have opened the door to a wholesale raid on
underclassmen by the USFL. The National Football
League has a long-standing rule that players must com
plete their college elgibility before they can be drafted
by a pro franchise.
"I think it (Walker's signing) has hurt the USF if any

thing," said Stanford offensive coordinator Jim Fasel.
"There are a lot of (college) coaches opposed to the
USFL because it would mean their players wouldn't be
able to finish college."
"Hell, I don't want them (USFL representatives) coming
here and talking to my kids before they graduate,' he
said. "I see there may be a little war waged between the
USFL and college coaches and administrators."
Stanford Athletic Director Andy Geiger voiced similar
feelings, but did not think the NCAA can or will impose
national restrictions barring USFL representatives from
college campuses.
"If it starts a whole rash of players going to the USFL
before graduating," Geiger said, "then I think we will
have a situation similar to that in pro basketball, where
you have a hardship draft (for underclassmen desiring to
enter the pro ranks).
"It hasn't killed college basketball and it won't kill
college football."
Stanford senior quarterback John Elway, who recently
turned down a multi-million dollar offer from the USFL's
Oakland Invaders, was unavailable for comment as was
Cardinal Head Football Coach Paul Wiggin, who is out of
town.
USFL Commissioner Chet Simmons, at a news confer
ence in Orlando, Fla., promised that Walker's signing
was not a precursor to a wholesale raid on collegians
"because it was a special circumstance."
He said that the league and the Generals believed
Walker to be ineligible even before the original signing
because he had hired an agent who came to the USFL
team for the purpose of negotiating a contract.
While the furor over Walker's banishment from col
legiate football grew across the country, the NFL drop
ped a bombshell of its own in New York.
An NFL spokesman said Walker's attorney ap
proached the league overnight "and asked if we were
interested in signing Herschel and placing him in a fran
chise city of his choice."
Man ton said Walker would not report to the Generals'
training camp in Orlando, Fla., until sometime this
weekend or early next week. The USFL season begins
March 6.
