# GLAS proposes new scholarship
## 
### KATHY OLMSTED Senior staff writer 
In response to the University's
probable refusal of a proposed
scholarship restricted to homosexual
males, the Gay and Lesbian Alliance
at Stanford (GLAS) yesterday an
nounced plans to begin a scholarship
that would give preference to medi
cal students who have served the gay
community.
The GLAS scholarship was specif
ically designed to meet the Universi
ty s objections to an anonymous
donor's earlier request to establish a
$500 scholarship limited to gay medi
cal students. University President
Donald Kennedy objected to this gift
offer because it required prospective
recipients to make declarations of
faith that were unverifiable without
invasions of their privacy by the Uni
versity.
Iris Brest, staff counsel, said the
University would probably send a let
ter to the anonymous donor that
would explain why the University
could not accept his gift as ordered,
and would suggest other ways he
could support the gay and lesbian
community.
The anonymous offer was origi
nally rejected by the University, but
the donor resubmitted his offer with

a more extensive explanation. Ken
nedy then turned the issue over to
his staff for consideration
GLAS steering committee member
Douglas Bernard said he expected
the GLAS scholarship to be approved
by the University because, unlike the
anonymous offer, it is not limited to
homosexuals. "It needn't go to a gay
person," Bernard said.
Brest said the Office of Develop
ment needed to study the GLAS pro
posal further before the University
could determine if the offer would
be acceptable.
Bernard said the GLAS steering
committee members offered the
scholarship because they agree with
the anonymous donor's intent but
they acknowledge the University's
objections to the offer. The GLAS
scholarship is completely indepen
dent from the anonymous donor's
earlier offer, Bernard said.
GLAS has already raised $550 for
the scholarship, according to Ber
nard, who added that the organiza
tion hopes to raise a total of $1000.
GLAS will write to the anonymous
donor of the restricted scholarship
and to other potential donors in
order to solicit more contributions,
Bernard said.
According to the GLAS steering
committee's statement, GLAS of
fered the scholarship in order to ease
the shortage of health care profes
sionals serving the gay community
and to make gay health care a more
accepted field.
GLAS suggested several ways that
the University could verify that a stu
dent has served the gay community;
the student could be involved in an
organization which helps the gay
community: the student could be
pursuing a course of study which
would prepare him for service to gay
community; and the student could
be involved in research which would
improve gay health care.
Bernard criticized the University
administration for not consulting
GLAS earlier. Brest responded that
the scholarship had been an adminis
trative issue and that the University
wasn't accustomed to consulting
student groups in such matters. "It's
not something that occurs to us."
