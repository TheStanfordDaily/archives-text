# Students discuss alcohol problem
## Recommend education, not regulation 
### BOB DUGONI 
Education, rather than stricter
University regulation, is the best way
to deal with the problem of alcohol
abuse at Stanford, said student resi
dent representatives at a forum
sponsored by the Dean of Student
Affairs Committee on Alcohol yes
terday.
The forum, attended by about 40
persons, was held at Tresidder and
was designed to gather student opin
ions on alcohol and related prob
lems.
Student opinions regarding al
cohol policy were largely in agree
ment with those of the Committee
on Alcohol. The committee had been
meeting with resident leaders for
about a year in an effort to evaluate
alcohol policy here.
Alice Supton, assistant dean of
Residential Education, said the
committee was not interested in a
blanket policy and that the commit
tee was soliciting student input be
cause, "we realized that we did not
know what the definition of the prob
lem was. We decided after talking
ourselves blue in the face to go back
to zero and discuss the problem with
students. We have made no decision
on alcohol policy."

The variety of opinions stated at
the forum make it difficult to con
sider an alcohol policy, but that it is
necessary to get the issues and
points of view circulating, Supton
said.
Robin Cooper, the student
member of the committee, said the
group function is not to just develop
a policy, but to help residents to
create an environment in which
people learn how to handle alcohol.
"A policy per se, written on a piece
of paper, doesn't make much sense.
It we re to be effective we have to
focus on a variety of things not
policy-oriented," Cooper said.
Cooper said the committee has
been effective in helping residences
with non-alcoholic alternatives and
in suggesting guidelines for alcohol
policies.
According to the University's cur
rent liquor policy, each residence is
required to adopt and maintain al
cohol regulations and "shall seri
ously take into account the age dis
tribution of its members so that the
legal status of those students who are
not yet 21 years of age shall be ac
corded recognition and appropriate
protection."

ALCOHOL ABUSE: Jim Cadena, assistant director of the row, leads part
of the disc ussion at yesterday's alcohol abuse forum. About 40 students
met with the Dean of Student Affairs Committee on Alcohol.
Under official University policy,
alcohol is allowed in residences not
"occupied primarily by freshmen" if
a non-alcoholic alternative is also
served.
At yesterday's forum, ASSU
Senator and graduate student |im
McGrath said, "Any alcohol policy
should be devised in close consulta
tion with students and student
groups."
"Trying to dictate a policy on high
fails miserably and I'm pleased the
University is not taking that course.

Trying to build a consensus with the
community rather than imposing a
consensus is more effective," he
said.
There was not a consensus of opin
ion from the students at the forum,
however, there was discussion on
the importance alcohol is given at
resident functions.
Mike Boennighausen, an RA at
Roble Hall said that alcohol is au
tomatically assumed to be the bever
age at dorm functions and, "people
equate alcohol with a good time. Par
ties are judged by how many kegs it
has."
Fraternity and sorority representa
tives described alcohol use as an in

dividual and not a group problem.
Sigma Alpha Epsilon President Mark
Landsberg said that the fraternity was
a healthier environment and lacked
the peer pressure often found in
freshman dorms.
"Nobody is persuading you, there
are no immediate clicks. Everybody
is free to do their own thing. There is
no forced drinking."
Barbara Chen, a member of Delta
Gamma sorority added, "Our group
found that the problem of alcohol is
more an individual than a group
thing. We are constantly reminding
ourselves that we are legally liable for
any accidents that result from drunk
eness."
