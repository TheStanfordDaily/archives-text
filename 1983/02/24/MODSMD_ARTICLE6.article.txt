Begin upholds peace formula
Jerusalem — If King Hussein wants to enter peace
talks with Israel, he will have to renounce any hope of
reclaiming the West Bank territory that Jordan lost in
the Six Day War of 1967 and will have to give up the
idea of a Palestinian state, Israeli leaders said yester
day.
Prime Minister Menachem Begin, in a speech to
Jewish war veterans, said Israel would not deviate
from the Camp David peace formula. He said Hussein
was welcome to talk peace provided he agrees to the
framework laid out in the Israel-U.S.-Egypt con
ference held in 1978 at the mountain presidential re
treat in Maryland.
A senior Israeli official explained that Hussein or
any other party wishing to join negotiations with Is

iael would have to agree to the Camp David plan for
autonomy for the Palestinian residents of the Israeli
occupied territory on the West Bank of the Jordan
River and the Gaza Strip.
The way Israel interprets the autonomy plan, it pre
cludes either an independent Palestinian state or re
turn of the West Bank to Jordan, at least for a five-year
transitional period.
After the initial five years, the official said, the
Camp David plan would permit changes in the status
of the territories only with the approval of all parties,
including Israel. He said that provision would per
manently block establishment of a Palestinian state.
Democrats plan new jobs
Washington — Democratic leaders of the House
Appropriations Committee yesterday informally ap

proved a $4.5 billion plan for jobs and recession relief
that would reshuffle and modestly expand President
Reagan's proposal.
But it ran into opposition behind the scenes from
some liberal urban Democrats who complained that it
would not go far enough in helping the neediest, and
House Speaker Thoma (Tip) O'Neill (D-Mass.) in
dicated that changes may be made.
The Democratic plan, which is scheduled for action
tomorrow by the full Appropriations Committee, dif
fers from Reagan's in providing less for such projects
as highways, transit and ports and more for weather
ization of low-income housing, jobs for young people
and the elderly, retraining for displaced workers, eco
nomic development and feeding programs for wom
en and children.
In all, it would spend about $400 million more than

Reagan proposed, according to Democratic aides
But some Democrats complained that the proposal
went too far in trying to forestall a presidential veto
and objected to what they called its rural tilt. An aide
toone noted that maternal and child health programs
got $10 million, while $200 million was provided for
rural water and sewer grants.
Draft registration defended
Washington — Selective Service Director Thomas
Turnage yesterday defended draft registration as "an
insurance policy in the event of a national emer
gency" and said that its elimination would detract
from"the readiness posture we are trying to
achieve."
Turnage testified before the Subcommittee on
Housing and Urban Development and Independent
Agencies of the House Appropriations committee,
which is considering a bill that would rescind $4 mil
lion in current financing for registration.
Rep. Bill Green (R-N.Y.) the bill's sponsor, said that
draft registration's "claimed military benefits are far
too slight to justify the social and political upset it
creates."
Turnage said that without draft registration, his
agency would need an additional 6-8 weeks to
mobilize a ready force. "With registration, we can get
them to the Department of Defense within 13 days,"
he said. "We now have a system that can respond to
the Department of Defense. The department says it
would need a response within 13 days; we can't do it
otherwise within that time frame."
OPEC favors price deceases
Cairo, Egypt — The Persian Gulf's Arab oil pro
ducers agreed "in principle" yesterday to cut their oil
prices but delayed announcing a new price, apparent
ly in the hope that talks with other exporters can
achieve a uniform reduction and avert a full-scale
price war.
Ministers indicated after a meeting in Riyadh, Saudi
Arabia, that they would seek a consensus within the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
(OPEC) at yet another emergency session in Geneva
or Vienna next week.
Saudi Oil Minister Ahmed Zaki Yamani, speaking
after yesterday's meeting of five gulf Arab producers,
said there was now agreement among six OPEC mem
bers on a reduction in the the cartel's official price of
$34 a barrel.
Libyan officers free hostages
Valletta, Malta — Two hijackers, identified as Lib
yan army officers, their scores of hostages yes
terday and surrendered after three days on a parked,
surrounded jetliner with little food and water.
Prime Minister Dom Mintoff promised the two they
could go wherever they wanted.

Government spokesman Paul Mifsud said that in
addition to the hijackers and an eight-member crew,
there were 11 children, 18 women, and 121 men
aboard the plane, which had been diverted to Malta
during a domestic Libyan flight from Sabhah to
Benghasi Sunday evening.
Maltese authorities identified the hijackers as At-
Tawati Mansur Al-Mahdi and Abdessalam Abu Kijla,
both first lieutenants in the Libyan army.
Byrne loses Chicago primary
Chicago — Defeated incumbent Jane Byrne
pledged her support yesterday for Harold Washing
ton in his bid to become Chicago's first black mayor,
asking Democrats who voted along racial lines in the
primary to rally behind the South Side congressman.
Washington was too hoarse to attend his own news
conference after his surprise victory over Byrne in
Tuesday's primary.
Republicans, hoping to gain City Hall for the first
time in 50 years, sent their little-known candidate on a
campaign walk through the predominantly white and
Hispanic home neighborhood of defeated Democrat
ic contender Richard Daley.
But GOP nominee Bernard Epton disavowed in
terest in a black-white race.
Stocks rise in late trading
The stock market swept aside any fears it may have
about falling oil prices and rallied in the final hour of
trading yesterday, lifting the Dow Jones industrial av
erage to within a point of its highest close ever.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up only
8.71 points with 30 minutes of trading left, closed with
a gain of 16.54 points at 1096.94. That erased the meas
ure's 12.42-point drop Tuesday and brought it within
a fraction of its record-high close of 1097.10 on Feb.
14.

Mostly sunny with highs in the 50s and light winds.
