Begin upholds peace formula
Jerusalem — If King Hussein wants to enter peace
talks with Israel, he will have to renounce any hope of
reclaiming the West Bank territory that Jordan lost in
the Six Day War of 1967 and will have to give up the
idea of a Palestinian state, Israeli leaders said yester
day.
Prime Minister Menachem Begin, in a speech to
Jewish war veterans, said Israel would not deviate
from the Camp David peace formula. He said Hussein
was welcome to talk peace provided he agrees to the
framework laid out in the Israel-U.S.-Egypt con
ference held in 1978 at the mountain presidential re
treat in Maryland.
A senior Israeli official explained that Hussein or
any other party wishing to join negotiations with Is

iael would have to agree to the Camp David plan for
autonomy for the Palestinian residents of the Israeli
occupied territory on the West Bank of the Jordan
River and the Gaza Strip.
The way Israel interprets the autonomy plan, it pre
cludes either an independent Palestinian state or re
turn of the West Bank to Jordan, at least for a five-year
transitional period.
After the initial five years, the official said, the
Camp David plan would permit changes in the status
of the territories only with the approval of all parties,
including Israel. He said that provision would per
manently block establishment of a Palestinian state.
Democrats plan new jobs
Washington — Democratic leaders of the House
Appropriations Committee yesterday informally ap

proved a $4.5 billion plan for jobs and recession relief
that would reshuffle and modestly expand President
Reagan's proposal.
But it ran into opposition behind the scenes from
some liberal urban Democrats who complained that it
would not go far enough in helping the neediest, and
House Speaker Thoma (Tip) O'Neill (D-Mass.) in
dicated that changes may be made.
The Democratic plan, which is scheduled for action
tomorrow by the full Appropriations Committee, dif
fers from Reagan's in providing less for such projects
as highways, transit and ports and more for weather
ization of low-income housing, jobs for young people
and the elderly, retraining for displaced workers, eco
nomic development and feeding programs for wom
en and children.
In all, it would spend about $400 million more than

Reagan proposed, according to Democratic aides
But some Democrats complained that the proposal
went too far in trying to forestall a presidential veto
and objected to what they called its rural tilt. An aide
toone noted that maternal and child health programs
got $10 million, while $200 million was provided for
rural water and sewer grants.
Draft registration defended
Washington — Selective Service Director Thomas
Turnage yesterday defended draft registration as "an
insurance policy in the event of a national emer
gency" and said that its elimination would detract
from"the readiness posture we are trying to
achieve."
Turnage testified before the Subcommittee on
