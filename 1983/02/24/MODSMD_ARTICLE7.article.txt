## India: troubles increase as massacre mars elections Hundreds slaughtered; election spurs violence 
### 
Compiled from news reports and wire
services
Eyewitness accounts from
last Sunday indicated that
more than 500 Moslems were
massacred in a single incident
as election-related violence
continued to engulf India's
northeastern state of Assam.
As lurid descriptions of the
slaughter reached the capital,
criticism mounted against
Prime Minister Indira Gandhi
for her decision to conduct the
election in the politically trou
bled state.
Indian army troops were de
ployed last Sunday in addi
tional areas of the Nowgong
district, 50 miles east of the
state capital of Gauhati, to rein
force police and paramilitary
forces that appear to have lost
all control of the area to
marauding mobs.
Last Saturday, troops had
moved to the site of the re
ported massacre, a cluster of
villages at Nelli, also in the
Nowgong district. The army
was alerted throughout the
state.

Prime Minister Indira Gan
dhi paid a six-hour visit to
Assam last Monday and briefly
visited with dazed survivors of
the 19-day-old holocaust of
slaughter.
Gandhi was deeply moved
by what the people told her,
according to the government's
All-India radio, which was the
only journalist media allowed
to accompany her.
Foreign journalists have
been barred from India's entire
northeastern region for many
years, ostensibly because of its
remote and sensitive location
near the Chinese border.
However, accounts by Indian
nationals, reporting from the
scene for the British Broadcast
ing Corp. and the British news
agency Reuters, described the
horror of the Nilli massacre's
aftermath.
Satish Jacob, a BBC corre
spondent, said that he counted
hundreds of bodies lying in
fields and on the banks of a
river nearthe cluster of villages
that the Moslems call home.
BBC reporter Jacob de

scribed villagers digging two
mass graves for 67 of the vic
tims, and he added that most of
the bodies were those of
women, children and old men,
those apparently too slow to
escape the attacking tribes
men.
Ayouthful male survivor told
Reuters correspondent Najmul
Hasan that the villagers were
trying to reach a forest on the
opposite bank of the river but
that only the strongest were
able to make it to safety.
The tribesmen, part of a

Hindu Assamese majority at
tempting to disrupt the elec
tion, were said to have become
angered because the Moslems
planned to vote in the par
liamentary election.
The native Assamese be
lieved that the immigrants, es
timated to number between 1
million and 4 million of the
state's 20 million residents,
threatened their cultural iden
tity.
Gandhi had decided to hold
the election after the collapse
of the protracted negotiations

between the government and
leaders of a civil disobedience
movement in the state de
manding the expulsion of il
legal immigrants, mainly from
neighboring Bangladesh.
The election for 126 state as
sembly seats and 12central par
liamentary seats was sched
uled to end last Sunday, but
was extended through Monday
to complete polling in 11 as
sembly constituencies where
violence and disrupted road
communications had earlier
prevented voting.
