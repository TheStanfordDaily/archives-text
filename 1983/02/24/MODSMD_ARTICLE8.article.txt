Compiled from news reports and wire services
India has begun producing and stockpiling weapons grade
plutonium at a nuclear reprocessing plant, according to pub
lished reports by the news media.
The Washington Post, quoting unidentified U.S. and interna
tional sources, reported last Sunday that India is stockpiling sepa
rated plutonium at a rate that would enable it to build about 20
atomic bombs a year if it pursues a nuclear weapons program.
The plutonium is separated from spent fuel used by atomic
power plants at the Tarapur reprocessing facility near Bombay,
The Post said.
According to the International Atomic Energy Agency, the plant
went into large-scale operation last November. Previously the
plant had been used to reprocess only small amounts of fuel.
A State Department official said the United States had ex
pressed concern on numerous occasions about the spread of
nuclear reprocessing facilities, especially in areas of potential
instability such as southern Asia, The New York Times reported
last Monday.
"We have had a long and unpleasant history with India on this
subject," the unidentified official told The Times.
The U.S. official told the Times that India had done nothing
illegal and that no special action was being contemplated by
Washington outside of expressions of displeasure.
India has stated that it does not plan to build nuclear weapons.
But India exploded an atomic device in 1974 that was made from
plutonium.
International Atomic Energy Agency officials said the separated
plutonium would be stored until Indian officials decide its use,
The Post reported. It quoted Indian atomic energy officials as
saying the plutonium could be used to fuel an experimental
fast-breeder reactor, which would produce additional
plutonium.
