# Wandering tribesman seeking a new way of life

Since India became independent in 1947, reliance
on the wandering artisans and traders has waned as
communication and transportation have improved,
bringing cheaper, mass-produced tools from the
cities to the rural areas.
Government officials have no precise figures on
the subject, but they believe that nomads comprise
roughly 5 percent of the region's 13 million people.
And their number, the officials maintain, is rapidly
dwindling.
The role of the Banjara tribesmen, who claim a
common ancestry with the gypsies of Europe and for
centuries sold salt to desert farmers in return for
grain, is rapidly being taken over by wholesale dis
tributors who truck in a variety of goods, including
salt, and sell it at prices usually below what the Ban
jara tribesmen can charge.
These distributors are also replacing other villagers
who bring in beads, bangles and other trinkets on the
backs of donkeys, and the Ghattiwalas, who produce
and sell grinding wheels and hookahs.

Even traveling bands of snake charmers, jugglers
and acrobats, who once provided entertainment at
village fairs and roadside gatherings, are succumbing
to more sophisticated competitors as government
sponsored films and drama groups penetrate ever
deeper into remote areas.
Once their place in desert society becomes obso
lete, the desert nomads quickly become unwanted.
A 1966 study of one desert region found that at least
70 percent of the settled population no longer wel
comed visits by six prominent nomadic groups.
These sentiments have intensified in the years since,
according to people who have studied the situation.
With the region's population growing and putting
further pressures on what is already the most densely
populated desert in the world, it seems certain that
the forces acting against the nomads who are still
trying to cling to their traditional life will increase in
the years ahead.
The Indian government, meanwhile, has encour
aged settlement efforts. Officials speak in terms of

"rehabilitation."
The government is trying to solve a continuing
problem, as literacy among the nomadic people is far
below the level of the settled people, 1 percent com
pared to 23 percent. And disease, coupled with an
absence of even rudimentary medical care, has
pushed infant mortality among the nomads to a level
far above the region's norm, reducing life expectancy
in the area where three-quarters of the people live to
less than 35 years.
So far, however, government settlement projects
have been a disaster. Some of the public housing
blocks built for the nomads were of such poor quality
that they collapsed soon after they were completed.
Farmland made available as an enticement was in
some cases barren and without water, and so far from
the colonies that it was virtually unworkable.
With little chance of going back to the old ways, the
majority of the nomads are prepared to settle down.
But, according to a government analyst, they want to
stay somewhere in the area of traditional movement.
