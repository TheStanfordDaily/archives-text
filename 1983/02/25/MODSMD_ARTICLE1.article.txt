# Anthro department expels Mosher for China conduct
## 
### DOUGLAS JEHL Senior staff writer 
Steven Mosher, the anthropology graduate student
whose research tactics angered both the Chinese gov
ernment and American scholars, was expelled from the
University yesterday.
Tenured professors in his department voted unani
mously to accept the recommendation of an ad hoc
investigating committee that Mosher be terminated
from the anthropology Ph.D. program. Their decision
came following a morning-long departmental meetingat
which Mosher — who had been flown here from Taiwan
— was permitted to present his defense.
The department refused to make public the specific
reasons for the decision. Prof. Clifford Barnett, depart
ment chair, said only that Mosher had been terminated
for "behavior inappropriate for an anthropologist."
Mosher contends the charges are false, and says the
University is bowing to pressure from the Chinese.
Mosher was informed of his expulsion — the first of a
student in recent memory — in a letter from the depart
ment chair given to him at 4 p.m., three hours after the
decision was made.
Mosher, 34, had expected to be expelled, but was
noticeably distraught and angry as he read the letter for
the first time. Earlier in the day, he told reporters that
such a decision would put his academic career "on
hold" for the rest of his life.
The reasons for his expulsion are detailed in a confi
dential 47-page report compiled by the committee after
17 months of investigation. Reportedly, they include
Mosher's allegedly illegal behavior while in China and
his decision to publish in Taiwan an article condemning
Chinese birth-control policies. The department voted to
keep the committee report secret — and to urge Mosher
to do the same — because "it contains information that
may be injurious to innocent parties."
At a news conference after his expulsion, Mosher said
he would likely appeal the decision within the University
or in the courts. He also assailed the committee for
conducting a shoddy investigation, and challenged the
University to release the report, saying his research sub

jects would not be affected if it were made public.
"The decision to keep the report confidential was
made at least partly with Stanford's own self-interest in
mind," Mosher charged. He speculated that the Univer
sity had promised confidentiality to his ex-wife, whose
condemnatory statements describing his research he
called "slanderous."
He said he could not make the report public himself
because it might jeopardize his appeal.
But Mosher, unlike Barnett, was willing to disclose
information about the substance of the report. He said
the "so-called evidence" consisted only of the Taiwan
article, a statement from the Chinese officials, and a
statement from his ex-wife, who accused him of mis
conduct while doing field work in 1979-80.
"I was expelled because the faculty of Stanford Uni
versity chose to believe the charges brought against me
by the Chinese," Mosher said.
Although Mosher has also been accused of other of
fenses — including violating Chinese travel and customs
restrictions — it is clearly his decision to publish the
article in Taiwan that has been viewed as most serious.
That May 1981 article, which appeared in The Sunday
Times Chinese Weekly — the Taiwanese equivalent of
Time magazine — described officially sanctioned abor
tions being performed on Chinese women many
months pregnant. It also contained a Mosher photo
graph of a naked woman 7Vi months pregnant on an
operating table being prepared for an abortion. Later,
that photo was reproduced in a Newsweek article about
Mosher headlined "Trouble for a China Hand."
The Chinese government, which had not expected a
scholar to publish work intended for mass consumption
in Taiwan, was predictably angered by the Chinese
Weekly article. It renewed its criticism of Mosher to
American diplomats and scientists, and later clamped
down on social science research by American scholars.
That meant Mosher, the first American anthropologist
to do extended research in China, would also be one
of the last.
American scholars, too, were angered. They objected

sion.
to the fact that the byline on the story
read "Stephen Westley" (Mosher's
middle name) and the fact that he
didn't mask the identity of his re
search subjects in the photograph.
According to Mosher, the committee
report says that by publishing the ar
ticle in Taiwan — China's arch
enemy — Mosher had "gravely en
dangered innocent villagers."
That and other charges have no
merit, Mosher insisted repeatedly
yesterday. He said he felt a primary
obligation to the people of the vil
lages he studied, and argued that the
photographs did not violate profes
sional ethics. "The concept of pri
vacy really does not exist in China; I
could not possibly have invaded
their privacy," he said.
Mosher's disclosure that much of
the evidence against him came from
his ex-wife provided a dramatic —
and controversial — twist to the af
ternoon news conference. It came
after Mosher was asked to describe
the evidence that the University
wanted to remain confidential.
"One letter," Mosher said, "was
from my ex-wife, the one that I di
vorced." According to Mosher, his
ex-wife, Maggie So — then still his
wife — came to visit him at the village
in March 1980. At that time, the final
falling out occurred. "My wife was
very wounded by the divorce,"
Mosher said.
"She threatened me at the time
that if I did go ahead and divorce her

that she would ruin me," he said. She
then went to Peking, Mosher said,
where "she essentially cooperated in
the Chinese plan to slander me."
"I think it's clear why the charges
were made," he said. "She is the
scorned woman."
Mosher said that the letter had not
actually been written by So at all.
Rather, he said he was told at the
department meeting, it was written
for So's signature by Anthropology
Prof, lane Collier, chair of the inves
tigating committee, on the basis of
half a dozen telephone conversa
tions with So.
Because So was lying to the inves
tigating committee, Mosher said, she
was hesitant about putting anything
in writing. He speculated that she
would only sign the letter if the Uni
versity promised not to tell Mosher
about her whereabouts.
"I do not know where she is," he
said.
Barnett confirmed that there was
testimony from Mosher's ex-wife in
the report, but would make no
further comment. Collier, who is
doing field work in Spain, was not
available for comment.
Mosher said he plans to remain in
the United States for a number of
weeks while he decides whether —
or how — he will appeal the decision.
Later, he said, he must return to his
wife in Taiwan for financial reasons.
He is writing a book, Broken Earth:
Life of the Rural Chinese, scheduled
to be published this summer.

middle name) and the fact that he
didn't mask the identity of his re
search subjects in the photograph.
According to Mosher, the committee
report says that by publishing the ar
ticle in Taiwan — China's arch
enemy — Mosher had "gravely en
dangered innocent villagers."
That and other charges have no
merit, Mosher insisted repeatedly
yesterday. He said he felt a primary
obligation to the people of the vil
lages he studied, and argued that the
photographs did not violate profes
sional ethics. "The concept of pri
vacy really does not exist in China; I
could not possibly have invaded
their privacy," he said.
Mosher's disclosure that much of
the evidence against him came from
his ex-wife provided a dramatic —
and controversial — twist to the af
ternoon news conference. It came
after Mosher was asked to describe
the evidence that the University
wanted to remain confidential.
"One letter," Mosher said, "was
from my ex-wife, the one that I di
vorced." According to Mosher, his
ex-wife, Maggie So — then still his
wife — came to visit him at the village
in March 1980. At that time, the final
falling out occurred. "My wife was
very wounded by the divorce,"
Mosher said.
"She threatened me at the time
that if I did go ahead and divorce her

that she would ruin me," he said. She
then went to Peking, Mosher said,
where "she essentially cooperated in
the Chinese plan to slander me."
"I think it's clear why the charges
were made," he said. "She is the
scorned woman."
Mosher said that the letter had not
actually been written by So at all.
Rather, he said he was told at the
department meeting, it was written
for So's signature by Anthropology
Prof, lane Collier, chair of the inves
tigating committee, on the basis of
half a dozen telephone conversa
tions with So.
Because So was lying to the inves
tigating committee, Mosher said, she
was hesitant about putting anything
in writing. He speculated that she
would only sign the letter if the Uni
versity promised not to tell Mosher
about her whereabouts.
"I do not know where she is," he
said.
Barnett confirmed that there was
testimony from Mosher's ex-wife in
the report, but would make no
further comment. Collier, who is
doing field work in Spain, was not
available for comment.
Mosher said he plans to remain in
the United States for a number of
weeks while he decides whether —
or how — he will appeal the decision.
Later, he said, he must return to his
wife in Taiwan for financial reasons.
He is writing a book, Broken Earth:

Steven Mosher, the anthropology graduate student
whose research tactics angered both the Chinese gov
ernment and American scholars, was expelled from the
University yesterday.
Tenured professors in his department voted unani
mously to accept the recommendation of an ad hoc
investigating committee that Mosher be terminated
from the anthropology Ph.D. program. Their decision
came following a morning-long departmental meetingat
which Mosher — who had been flown here from Taiwan
— was permitted to present his defense.
The department refused to make public the specific
reasons for the decision. Prof. Clifford Barnett, depart
ment chair, said only that Mosher had been terminated
for "behavior inappropriate for an anthropologist."
Mosher contends the charges are false, and says the
University is bowing to pressure from the Chinese.
Mosher was informed of his expulsion — the first of a
student in recent memory — in a letter from the depart
ment chair given to him at 4 p.m., three hours after the
decision was made.
Mosher, 34, had expected to be expelled, but was
noticeably distraught and angry as he read the letter for
the first time. Earlier in the day, he told reporters that
such a decision would put his academic career "on
hold" for the rest of his life.
The reasons for his expulsion are detailed in a confi
dential 47-page report compiled by the committee after
17 months of investigation. Reportedly, they include
Mosher's allegedly illegal behavior while in China and
his decision to publish in Taiwan an article condemning
Chinese birth-control policies. The department voted to
keep the committee report secret — and to urge Mosher
to do the same — because "it contains information that
may be injurious to innocent parties."
At a news conference after his expulsion, Mosher said
he would likely appeal the decision within the University
or in the courts. He also assailed the committee for
conducting a shoddy investigation, and challenged the
University to release the report, saying his research sub

jects would not be affected if it were made public.
"The decision to keep the report confidential was
made at least partly with Stanford's own self-interest in
mind," Mosher charged. He speculated that the Univer
sity had promised confidentiality to his ex-wife, whose
condemnatory statements describing his research he
called "slanderous."
He said he could not make the report public himself
because it might jeopardize his appeal.
But Mosher, unlike Barnett, was willing to disclose
information about the substance of the report. He said
the "so-called evidence" consisted only of the Taiwan
article, a statement from the Chinese officials, and a
statement from his ex-wife, who accused him of mis
conduct while doing field work in 1979-80.
"I was expelled because the faculty of Stanford Uni
versity chose to believe the charges brought against me
by the Chinese," Mosher said.
Although Mosher has also been accused of other of
fenses — including violating Chinese travel and customs
restrictions — it is clearly his decision to publish the
article in Taiwan that has been viewed as most serious.
That May 1981 article, which appeared in The Sunday
Times Chinese Weekly — the Taiwanese equivalent of
Time magazine — described officially sanctioned abor
tions being performed on Chinese women many
months pregnant. It also contained a Mosher photo
graph of a naked woman 7Vi months pregnant on an
operating table being prepared for an abortion. Later,
that photo was reproduced in a Newsweek article about
Mosher headlined "Trouble for a China Hand."
The Chinese government, which had not expected a
scholar to publish work intended for mass consumption
in Taiwan, was predictably angered by the Chinese
Weekly article. It renewed its criticism of Mosher to
American diplomats and scientists, and later clamped
down on social science research by American scholars.
That meant Mosher, the first American anthropologist
to do extended research in China, would also be one
of the last.
American scholars, too, were angered. They objected
