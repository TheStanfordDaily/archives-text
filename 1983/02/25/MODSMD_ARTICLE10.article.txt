## The 						Stanford Daily Cheers for changes at TMU 
### 
The Tresidder Space Committee recently an
nounced its proposal tor a major renovation ot
its facilities to better meet the needs ot the
community and particularly students. We
applaud its well-researched efforts.
It's about time — atter all, Tresidder is a stu
dent union. The expansion of the Store and the
Coffee House takes student needs into account.
A larger and certainly a less expensive store is
needed, as anyone who has waited in the noon
line will testify. The expansion of the student
run Coffee House is also welcomed. Having a
meeting place which serves as both a social and
study center here on campus is especially
valued by students and its expansion is a well
deserved compliment.
The addition of yet another student entrepre
neurial opportunity, similar to the successful
Corner Pocket, will also be appreciated, particu

larly since student managerial and entrepre
neurial interest seems to run high here.
We commend the proposed increase in meet
ing space, decrease in the size ot the bank and
relocation of the Box Office and Sequoia Travel
Service.
Finally, we must add a note of nostalgia.
While we realize that some of the lesser used
services must be scrapped to make room for
new ones, it seems difficult to imagine Tresid
der without a bowling alley. Perhaps this marks
the end of an era. In any event, it does mark the
demise of an intramural '.port. Members of the
Daily team are still trying to recover from the
distressing news.
There is one >put of bright news for bowling
fans — construction takes time, and the renova
tion will not be complete until 1984. So bowl
while you can!
