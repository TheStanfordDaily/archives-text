# Dorm ed is more than Res Ed
## 
### 
While living in a dorm, one often comes into contact
with .i powerful fo.ci known as Residential Education.
This force often seems to be an omnipresent being, and
one can find it lurking behind dorm programs, dorm
shows, dorm newspapers, dorm debates, dorm gov
ernments and even dorm parties.
While Residential Education does make a valid at
tempt at enriching us, I am sorry to say that the most
important learning we do in a dorm occurs in areas that
are outride of Residential Education's influence. As
cliche-ridden as this may sound, the most important
learning occurs during interaction with other people.
For example, an important lesson I recently learned is
how to become friends with someone who lives down
the hall from you, and whom you have passed in the hall
50 times without ever saving more than, "Hi. How are
you?" The key is to pretend that you are in the middle of
a conversation with that person.
There is a girl in my hallway whom I pass at least five
times a day. Every time we pass each other, it's the same
boring routine. I say Hello" with a slight smile on my
tart', and a slightly happy tone in my voice. She in turn
s§ys "Hi," looks at me in the tace tor halt a second , and
iVten on. t don't really care that much. It just seems
ridiculous
A few days ago, with my plan in mind, I saw her
approaching me from the other end of the hallway. I
thought of a topic. When she was five feet away, I said,
"Do you really think that the kind of oats they grow in
Oklahoma arn better than the ones in Kansas?"
She hesitated for a second, then said, "Hi," in the
same wav she always does. You may think mv plan
backtired because I didn't succeed in engaging her in a
conversation. I think, though, that it's just a matter of
finding fhr right topic. Next time I'll ask her what she
thinks about the latest fashions from Italy. It will work
eventually.
Another important dorm lesson involves hashers in
food service Bet ause people in the dorm are often the
ones who serve you food, you have to learn to maintain
your composure even if someone you know thinks
you're a pig.
Everyone has had days where they feel like eating a
huge amount of food. You have just bombed a midterm,
your bike has a flat tire, and you just found out that the
person you are madly in love with likes your roommate.
All you want to do is go to food service and get huge
servings ot everything. But what happens? You go
through the line and find that the person taking care of

desserts is the same physically-fit person who runs every
d.»y t inci vv h >'-e Jut ronsi ■ts ot wheat b r ead and naturally
-sweetened apple cider. Are you really going to take
three pieces of cheese cake with this person watching
and laughing beneath his breath.
What do vou do in this situation; Do you wait until the
hasher isn't looking, and then run to the food line to
grab the goods. Or do you take a big, fat piece of cake
and slowly eat it right in front of the hasher's face?
Through experience, I have found that the best solu
tion is to go to another dorm. v\ here you don't know the
hashers, and pig out there in peace. You've had a tough
day. You don t need any more troubles.
Dorm life has also taught me a great deal about ro
mance. I m not talking about my own romantic flings,
but rather the flings of my roommates. The first time my
roommate brought a giri to the room, I was amazed at
how easy it was tor him to completely ignore me. He
could have been in the Honeymoon Suite in a Niagara
Falls hotel the way he was acting. My first reaction was to
cough. When I was on the verge of losing my voice>
though I realized that he wasn't hearing me. I was studv
•>r,g citcuu.s at the lime, so next I started to read the
calculus book vt-rv loudly. I thought that would defi
nitely spoil the mood. It didn't work, though. I began to
yawn loudly, trying to tell them that I wanted to go to
sleep All that I accomplished, though, was to make
myself feel tired making it even more difficult for me to
study. Sweet nothings continued to be spoken across
the room.
I finally decided tnat there was nothing I could do
about the situation, so I resumed my studying. I sud
denly realized that because of the actions of the two
people across the room I wasn t getting tired, as I usu
ally did when studying calculus. In fact, the numbers
began to seem very interesting, as their shapes started to
remind me of certain things that were connected to my
roommate and his partner. Ever since then, I have tried
to study for tests »n places where there are relatively
ex< iting things happening. It may seem weird, but living
for right months with someone you never met before is
weird also. As some great person must have once said,
"Wpirdness begets weirdriess."
What is the main point of this article? If your body is
getting out of shape, and your brain is getting sore and
you feel like nothing is exciting, lust walk down your
hallway with open eyes. There's really plenty there to
excite you.

While living in a dorm, one often comes into contact
with .i powerful fo.ci known as Residential Education.
This force often seems to be an omnipresent being, and
one can find it lurking behind dorm programs, dorm
shows, dorm newspapers, dorm debates, dorm gov
ernments and even dorm parties.
While Residential Education does make a valid at
tempt at enriching us, I am sorry to say that the most
important learning we do in a dorm occurs in areas that
are outride of Residential Education's influence. As
cliche-ridden as this may sound, the most important
learning occurs during interaction with other people.
For example, an important lesson I recently learned is
how to become friends with someone who lives down
the hall from you, and whom you have passed in the hall
50 times without ever saving more than, "Hi. How are
you?" The key is to pretend that you are in the middle of
a conversation with that person.
There is a girl in my hallway whom I pass at least five
times a day. Every time we pass each other, it's the same
boring routine. I say Hello" with a slight smile on my
tart', and a slightly happy tone in my voice. She in turn
s§ys "Hi," looks at me in the tace tor halt a second , and
iVten on. t don't really care that much. It just seems
ridiculous
A few days ago, with my plan in mind, I saw her
approaching me from the other end of the hallway. I
thought of a topic. When she was five feet away, I said,
"Do you really think that the kind of oats they grow in
Oklahoma arn better than the ones in Kansas?"
She hesitated for a second, then said, "Hi," in the
same wav she always does. You may think mv plan
backtired because I didn't succeed in engaging her in a
conversation. I think, though, that it's just a matter of
finding fhr right topic. Next time I'll ask her what she
thinks about the latest fashions from Italy. It will work
eventually.
Another important dorm lesson involves hashers in
food service Bet ause people in the dorm are often the
ones who serve you food, you have to learn to maintain
your composure even if someone you know thinks
you're a pig.
Everyone has had days where they feel like eating a
huge amount of food. You have just bombed a midterm,
your bike has a flat tire, and you just found out that the
person you are madly in love with likes your roommate.
All you want to do is go to food service and get huge
servings ot everything. But what happens? You go
through the line and find that the person taking care of

desserts is the same physically-fit person who runs every
d.»y t inci vv h >'-e Jut ronsi ■ts ot wheat b r ead and naturally
-sweetened apple cider. Are you really going to take
three pieces of cheese cake with this person watching
and laughing beneath his breath.
What do vou do in this situation; Do you wait until the
hasher isn't looking, and then run to the food line to
grab the goods. Or do you take a big, fat piece of cake
and slowly eat it right in front of the hasher's face?
Through experience, I have found that the best solu
tion is to go to another dorm. v\ here you don't know the
hashers, and pig out there in peace. You've had a tough
day. You don t need any more troubles.
Dorm life has also taught me a great deal about ro
mance. I m not talking about my own romantic flings,
but rather the flings of my roommates. The first time my
roommate brought a giri to the room, I was amazed at
how easy it was tor him to completely ignore me. He
could have been in the Honeymoon Suite in a Niagara
Falls hotel the way he was acting. My first reaction was to
cough. When I was on the verge of losing my voice>
though I realized that he wasn't hearing me. I was studv
•>r,g citcuu.s at the lime, so next I started to read the
calculus book vt-rv loudly. I thought that would defi
nitely spoil the mood. It didn't work, though. I began to
yawn loudly, trying to tell them that I wanted to go to
sleep All that I accomplished, though, was to make
myself feel tired making it even more difficult for me to
study. Sweet nothings continued to be spoken across
the room.
I finally decided tnat there was nothing I could do
about the situation, so I resumed my studying. I sud
denly realized that because of the actions of the two
people across the room I wasn t getting tired, as I usu
ally did when studying calculus. In fact, the numbers
began to seem very interesting, as their shapes started to
remind me of certain things that were connected to my
roommate and his partner. Ever since then, I have tried
to study for tests »n places where there are relatively
ex< iting things happening. It may seem weird, but living
for right months with someone you never met before is
weird also. As some great person must have once said,
"Wpirdness begets weirdriess."
What is the main point of this article? If your body is
getting out of shape, and your brain is getting sore and
you feel like nothing is exciting, lust walk down your
hallway with open eyes. There's really plenty there to
excite you.
