## U.S. should restrict Soviets 
### 
On Feb. 18 a Daily editorial ad
dressed the questions raised by the
State Department's refusal to permit
a Soviet aipiomat to travel to Stan
ford on Feb. 9. (We attended the
non-talk and were personally disap
pointed that Vice Consul Gennaudy
Gurkin was not able to be there.) The
editorial concluded that such actions
on the part of the U.S. government
are wrong on two grounds: they are
unlikely to succeed in their stated
purpose of securing decent treat
ment for our officials in the Soviet
Union; and constraints on freedom
of speech are inappropriate in any
event.
From the outset, the Soviet gov
ernment has imposed severe restric
tionson the travel of diplomats in the
Soviet Union: travel within a 25 mile
radius of the centers of Moscow and
Leningrad is unrestricted; travel be
yond this area is essentially by per
mission only. In order to improve the
prospects of obtaining such permis
sion, the United States, finally, in the
early '60s, decided to impose, on a
reciprocal basis, these same restric
tions on Soviet diplomats (and those
of some other countries where our
representatives were similarly re
stricted).
Therefore, it should be noted that
what was at issue in Vice Consul
Gurkin's case was not, in the first in
stance, denial of permission to speak
but rather permission to travel —
which obviously amounted to a de
nial of the opportunity to speak in
person since that was the purpose of
the trip, though it did not otherwise
prevent the reading of his remarks.
Our point here is simply a factual
one: the U.S. government may re
strict a diplomat's freedom to travel
— which may or may not have some
impact on some other freedom, but
does not restrict those freedoms in
other ways.
The question remains, of course,
whether such a policy on our part is
effective. From even a casual ac
quaintance with the history of rela
tions between the two countries the
conclusion should be inescapable:
only in the context of a strictly en
forced reciprocity can we expect the

Soviet government to see its self
interest served by accommodating
an interest of ours.
The Uniieu States and the Soviet
Union invest considerable effort and
resources in keeping abreast of de
velopments in each other's country
(the costs of our diplomatic and in
formation efforts with regard to the
Soviet Union run to hund r eds of mil
lions of dollar- in a decj if) ard n
maintaining access to each other's
population — although, by the very
natures of the two societies, these
relationships are highly assymetrical
The point here is that our official di
plomatic, cultural, educational, in
formational and other efforts are im
portant to us (or else we have made a
big mistake with a whole lot of out
resources) and that we can and do
improve the efficiency of these ef
forts bv having some lever with
which to influence the Soviets.
For their part, the Soviets are fi
nally coming to realize that it is the
American voter, not a group of phan
tom Wall Street moguls, who deter
mines U.S. policy in the final
analysis. And, since Americans are
not rushing to subscribe to Pravda or
tune in to Radio Moscow, Soviet di
plomats are naturally avid for oppor
tunities to present their govern
ment's point of view before Ameri
can audiences. At the same time,
they are at least equally interested in
acquainting themselves with eco
nomic and technical developments
in different parts of this country.
The moral side is admittedly more
difficult. If one concludes that re
striction of freedom (e.g. to travel
and/or to speak in person) is simply
and absolutely wrong, then there is
little more to be said. But clearly our
concept of such treedoms would not
extend to telling national security
secrets to Soviet diplomats or allow
ing them to examine sensitive mili
tary installations at will While the
case for restricting other, more inno
cent activities of Soviet personnel is
not so dramatically evident, what we
have tried to suggest above is that
our government's ability to impose
reciprocal restraints in these cases
does touch important national inter
ests.

Moreover, we should distinguish
between freedoms which are pro
tected by our Constitution as they
apply to individuals and "freedoms"
as they might or might not be ex
tended to representatives of another
government and which are, not
coincidentally, excluded from pro
tection under the Constitution. We
simply should not and do not treat
governments of other countries as
we do individual citizens because
they are different types of entities.
This is not to say that we should treat
them badly, or even that we should
treat them as they treat us, but rather
that we offer them a concrete motiva
tion to treat us as well as we would
like to treat them.
The notion of reciprocity is not
only the traditionally recognized
basi« of diplomatic arrangements be
tween governments, it is also one
that the Soviets themselves have
explicitly endorsed as the only ac
ceptable foundation of international
relations. It should also be borne in
mind that our insistence on reciproc
ity ultimately depends on the ap
proval of the American voter who is
unlikely to settle for less than equal
treatment of U.S. and Soviet repre
sentatives.
While it should not be imagined
that "reciprocity" is more than the
beginning ot diplomacy or that it is
some sort of magic, it is equally
wrong to suppose that it is without its
effect on Soviet (or our) perceptions
of self-interest.
In the Daily, it was stated that "We
doubt that Soviet officials . . . are
going to decide lo change their op
pressive policies." True enough if we
consider the Soviet system as a
whole, but demonstrably not true in
those more limited areas where the
two governments officially interact
and where each side can extend or
withhold its cooperation on the basis
of reciprocity.

reciprocal basis, these same restric
tions on Soviet diplomats (and those
of some other countries where our
representatives were similarly re
stricted).
Therefore, it should be noted that
what was at issue in Vice Consul
Gurkin's case was not, in the first in
stance, denial of permission to speak
but rather permission to travel —
which obviously amounted to a de
nial of the opportunity to speak in
person since that was the purpose of
the trip, though it did not otherwise
prevent the reading of his remarks.
Our point here is simply a factual
one: the U.S. government may re
strict a diplomat's freedom to travel
— which may or may not have some
impact on some other freedom, but
does not restrict those freedoms in
other ways.
The question remains, of course,
whether such a policy on our part is
effective. From even a casual ac
quaintance with the history of rela
tions between the two countries the
conclusion should be inescapable:
only in the context of a strictly en
forced reciprocity can we expect the

Soviet government to see its self
interest served by accommodating
an interest of ours.
The Uniieu States and the Soviet
Union invest considerable effort and
resources in keeping abreast of de
velopments in each other's country
(the costs of our diplomatic and in
formation efforts with regard to the
Soviet Union run to hund r eds of mil
lions of dollar- in a decj if) ard n
maintaining access to each other's
population — although, by the very
natures of the two societies, these
relationships are highly assymetrical
The point here is that our official di
plomatic, cultural, educational, in
formational and other efforts are im
portant to us (or else we have made a
big mistake with a whole lot of out
resources) and that we can and do
improve the efficiency of these ef
forts bv having some lever with
which to influence the Soviets.
For their part, the Soviets are fi
nally coming to realize that it is the
American voter, not a group of phan
tom Wall Street moguls, who deter
mines U.S. policy in the final
analysis. And, since Americans are
not rushing to subscribe to Pravda or
tune in to Radio Moscow, Soviet di
plomats are naturally avid for oppor
tunities to present their govern
ment's point of view before Ameri
can audiences. At the same time,
they are at least equally interested in
acquainting themselves with eco
nomic and technical developments
in different parts of this country.
The moral side is admittedly more
difficult. If one concludes that re
striction of freedom (e.g. to travel
and/or to speak in person) is simply
and absolutely wrong, then there is
little more to be said. But clearly our
concept of such treedoms would not
extend to telling national security
secrets to Soviet diplomats or allow
ing them to examine sensitive mili
tary installations at will While the
case for restricting other, more inno
cent activities of Soviet personnel is
not so dramatically evident, what we
have tried to suggest above is that
our government's ability to impose
reciprocal restraints in these cases
does touch important national inter
ests.

Moreover, we should distinguish
between freedoms which are pro
tected by our Constitution as they
apply to individuals and "freedoms"
as they might or might not be ex
tended to representatives of another
government and which are, not
coincidentally, excluded from pro
tection under the Constitution. We
simply should not and do not treat
governments of other countries as
we do individual citizens because
they are different types of entities.
This is not to say that we should treat
them badly, or even that we should
treat them as they treat us, but rather
that we offer them a concrete motiva
tion to treat us as well as we would
like to treat them.
The notion of reciprocity is not
only the traditionally recognized
basi« of diplomatic arrangements be
tween governments, it is also one
that the Soviets themselves have
explicitly endorsed as the only ac
ceptable foundation of international
relations. It should also be borne in
mind that our insistence on reciproc
ity ultimately depends on the ap
proval of the American voter who is
unlikely to settle for less than equal
treatment of U.S. and Soviet repre
sentatives.
While it should not be imagined
that "reciprocity" is more than the
beginning ot diplomacy or that it is
some sort of magic, it is equally
wrong to suppose that it is without its
effect on Soviet (or our) perceptions
of self-interest.
In the Daily, it was stated that "We
doubt that Soviet officials . . . are
going to decide lo change their op
pressive policies." True enough if we
consider the Soviet system as a
whole, but demonstrably not true in
those more limited areas where the
two governments officially interact
and where each side can extend or
withhold its cooperation on the basis
of reciprocity.

On Feb. 18 a Daily editorial ad
dressed the questions raised by the
State Department's refusal to permit
a Soviet aipiomat to travel to Stan
ford on Feb. 9. (We attended the
non-talk and were personally disap
pointed that Vice Consul Gennaudy
Gurkin was not able to be there.) The
editorial concluded that such actions
on the part of the U.S. government
are wrong on two grounds: they are
unlikely to succeed in their stated
purpose of securing decent treat
ment for our officials in the Soviet
Union; and constraints on freedom
of speech are inappropriate in any
event.
From the outset, the Soviet gov
ernment has imposed severe restric
tionson the travel of diplomats in the
Soviet Union: travel within a 25 mile
radius of the centers of Moscow and
Leningrad is unrestricted; travel be
yond this area is essentially by per
mission only. In order to improve the
prospects of obtaining such permis
sion, the United States, finally, in the
early '60s, decided to impose, on a
reciprocal basis, these same restric
