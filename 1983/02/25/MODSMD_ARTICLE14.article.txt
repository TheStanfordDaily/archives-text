## LSJUMB deserves fee assessment 
### 
We would like to clear up any con
fusion that may have resulted from
the brief mention of the ASSU Sen
ate's retus.il to approve the Leland
Stanford Junior University Marching
Band (LSJUMB) budget. Ihe article
(Daily, Feb. 2i) stated that "many
senate member- questioned the
propriety of some of the Band's ex
penditures."
It gave an inac< urate image of the
Band as financially irresponsible.
Our budget was approved in a Sen
ate Appropnations Committee meet
ing, where all questions and issues
were discussed with us and resolved.
Our budget requested ASSU funds
for travel, instrument repair un
iforms and publi< itv. The \SSU has
always approved these items. Inci
dentally, the LSIUMB never spends
fee assessment money on beer.
The Band's expenses have in
creased. while its real revenues have
decreased due to Music Department
cutbacks and a three-year Athletic
Department funding free/e. In addi
tion, the Rand needs to cover im
mediate production costs of its
soon-to-be released album (contains
the hit single "All Right Now"). The
album is intended to entertain Stan
ford students and not to make
money for the Band.
Evidently, the ASSU Senate mis
understood the nature of our album
and travel expenses ignoring the
recommendations of the better
informed Appropriations Commit*
I( , P . Consequently, we need 20 per
, ent of 'he student hody to sign our
petitions so that we may be on the
[ (>t , assessment ballot this spring
The Band has worked hard to im

prove, and we sincerely appreciate
the students' support of our eftorts.
We ask for your continued support.

I would like to praise lisa lynch s
article "Computer Facility Offers
Non-Academic Diversion' (/)a//y
Feb. 22) for its informative and witty
approach to the amusing side of
computer science here However, as
creator of the LOTS computer game
"Rinconada Adventure," I feel I must
clarify the inaccuratc description of
this parody of dormitory life given
therein.
lynch asked Alan Weindorf, a Lar
kin freshman interested in computer
science, for his thoughts on "Rin
conada Adventure." Me described
the game as pointless," with "ihe
object to score as many points as
possible — but there is no way to
score."
It is not my intention to cotrect
such a blatant semantic paradox, hut
rather to revise the description com
pletely. The object of the game is in
fact to score points, but because
Weindorf had such trouble getting
into "rooms that are alwa\ s • losed or
locked," he managed to miss the
Domino's pizza, a treasure wo'th five
points, slowly growing cold on the
third floor If he had only tound the
master key, a treasure in itself he
might have been able to unlock the

doors to certain residents' rooms.
Did he locate the key to the resident
fellow's Saab' Yes, these are all
treasures included in the computer
game "Rinconada Adventure." In
addition, there are ways to score
Other than finding treasures, but I'
wouldn't want to spoil the game for
those who haven't played it.
It is clear to me that Weindorf's
experience with this game is rather
limited. If Weindorf were to solve the
puzzles therein in one sitting, he
might also be able to put a quarter in
"t'ar Man" and score ten million
points on his very first try. I would
like to invite Weindorf and anyone
else interested in seeing just how
"pointless" this game is to a demon
stration of how amusing it really is.

Barbie's trial
Symbolically, the extradition and
pending trial in France of Klaus Bar
bae will have a profound effect on the
world's youth. Publicly detailing
Barbie's crimes will educate them
about the horrors of fascism so they
may apply this knowledge to combat
present day manifestations of
Nazism, racism and militarism.
Vet just as importantly the sudden
reappearance of Barbie serves as a
grim reminder that although Hitler
and his war machine were defeated
nearly 40 years ago, the ideology of
fascism survived. It is an outrage to
think that in this world today, Nazi
war criminals c in live safe, secluded
lives in nations ruled by military die

tators much as Hitler did.
It may come as a shock to some,
but facism is alive and killing in our
very own "backyard" — Latin
America. Witness El Salvador — sys
tematic torturing and killing of any
one who opposes the military
oligarchy. Add the generals of Argen
tina to the list, whose security forces
kidnap and isolate opposition lead
ers indefinitely. Chile's Augusto
Pinochet, Paraguay's Gen. Alfredo
Stroessner and the past dictator
ships in Bolivia and of Anastasio
Somoza in Nicaragua complete the
list.
In each of these countries Nazi war
criminals have been protected at one
point in time or another. And our
government supports and nurtures
these regimes politically, econom
ically and militarily, thus perpetuat
ing the fascist terror of World War 11.
We surely couldn't support them
spiritually, for we fought against fas
cism in WW II if you may recall. Why
the contradiction? If President Re
agan opposed fascism in 1943, why
does he support it in 1983 by arming
military regimes that harbor Nazi war
criminals?
We must realize that the struggle
against fascism has not ended. If we
have any hope for the future we must
continue by telling our children not
only who Klaus Barbie was and what
he stood for, but also point out
where in this world he was allowed to
hide for 31 years, and who protected
him — so that they may ask them
selves — "Why do we support these
regimes?"

I would like to praise lisa lynch s
article "Computer Facility Offers
Non-Academic Diversion' (/)a//y
Feb. 22) for its informative and witty
approach to the amusing side of
computer science here However, as
creator of the LOTS computer game
"Rinconada Adventure," I feel I must
clarify the inaccuratc description of
this parody of dormitory life given
therein.
lynch asked Alan Weindorf, a Lar
kin freshman interested in computer
science, for his thoughts on "Rin
conada Adventure." Me described
the game as pointless," with "ihe
object to score as many points as
possible — but there is no way to
score."
It is not my intention to cotrect
such a blatant semantic paradox, hut
rather to revise the description com
pletely. The object of the game is in
fact to score points, but because
Weindorf had such trouble getting
into "rooms that are alwa\ s • losed or
locked," he managed to miss the
Domino's pizza, a treasure wo'th five
points, slowly growing cold on the
third floor If he had only tound the
master key, a treasure in itself he
might have been able to unlock the

doors to certain residents' rooms.
Did he locate the key to the resident
fellow's Saab' Yes, these are all
treasures included in the computer
game "Rinconada Adventure." In
addition, there are ways to score
Other than finding treasures, but I'
wouldn't want to spoil the game for
those who haven't played it.
It is clear to me that Weindorf's
experience with this game is rather
limited. If Weindorf were to solve the
puzzles therein in one sitting, he
might also be able to put a quarter in
"t'ar Man" and score ten million
points on his very first try. I would
like to invite Weindorf and anyone
else interested in seeing just how
"pointless" this game is to a demon
stration of how amusing it really is.

Barbie's trial
Symbolically, the extradition and
pending trial in France of Klaus Bar
bae will have a profound effect on the
world's youth. Publicly detailing
Barbie's crimes will educate them
about the horrors of fascism so they
may apply this knowledge to combat
present day manifestations of
Nazism, racism and militarism.
Vet just as importantly the sudden
reappearance of Barbie serves as a
grim reminder that although Hitler
and his war machine were defeated
nearly 40 years ago, the ideology of
fascism survived. It is an outrage to
think that in this world today, Nazi
war criminals c in live safe, secluded
lives in nations ruled by military die

tators much as Hitler did.
It may come as a shock to some,
but facism is alive and killing in our
very own "backyard" — Latin
America. Witness El Salvador — sys
tematic torturing and killing of any
one who opposes the military
oligarchy. Add the generals of Argen
tina to the list, whose security forces
kidnap and isolate opposition lead
ers indefinitely. Chile's Augusto
Pinochet, Paraguay's Gen. Alfredo
Stroessner and the past dictator
ships in Bolivia and of Anastasio
Somoza in Nicaragua complete the
list.
In each of these countries Nazi war
criminals have been protected at one
point in time or another. And our
government supports and nurtures
these regimes politically, econom
ically and militarily, thus perpetuat
ing the fascist terror of World War 11.
We surely couldn't support them
spiritually, for we fought against fas
cism in WW II if you may recall. Why
the contradiction? If President Re
agan opposed fascism in 1943, why
does he support it in 1983 by arming
military regimes that harbor Nazi war
criminals?
We must realize that the struggle
against fascism has not ended. If we
have any hope for the future we must
continue by telling our children not
only who Klaus Barbie was and what
he stood for, but also point out
where in this world he was allowed to
hide for 31 years, and who protected
him — so that they may ask them
selves — "Why do we support these
regimes?"
