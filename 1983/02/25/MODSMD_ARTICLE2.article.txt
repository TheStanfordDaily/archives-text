# Menlo requests Stanford West reduction
## 
### TIM GRIEVE Staff writer 
In yet another episode in the continuing battle
over the proposed Stanford West housing proj
ect , the Menlo Park City Council recommended
Tuesday night that the University reduce the size
of the project to 500 units.
Administrators here criticized the recom
mendations as "unrealistic," while Menlo Park
City Council members said the proposals repre
sent the "interests of Menlo Park residents."
Andy Doty, the University's director of com
munity relations, said, "I think it's unlikely that
the project could be reduced that greatly and still
be economically viable and serve the housing
needs of the University. If we followed all their
recommendations, I doubt if there would be a

project. It's as simple as that."
Director of Planning Phil Williams also said
Stanford West would be "a quite different proj
ect" than that which was originally proposed if
Stanford followed Menlo Park's recom
mendations.
"At that scale it would be more like your typical
two- or three-story garden aporimonK yon see a
lot of around here. It would be more comfortable
for people who don't want to see a change. On
the down side, though, it would be failure to
exploit the property to its fullest potential. Fail
ing to use that property would be a mistake,"
Williams said.
According to Menlo Park councilwoman Kay
Parr, the recommendations were requested by
residents living near the project site.

"They (the recommendations) represent what
the public is asking for, and what our city is
asking for. The recommendations are based on
comments we've heard from the public in the
course of many meetings with the city council
and the planning commission," she said.
"Originall* we were responding to the proj
ect's impact report. As we went
along we bedme much moro av/are of the inter
est of Menlo residents. What they are saying
is that they don't want anything drastically
different than what they already have. In essence
what they want is the same type of housing that is
on the other side of the (San Francisquito)
creek," she explained.

The University is not obligated to
follow the council's recom
mendations because the proposed
project, to be built on 46 acres near
Willow Road, lies in the city of Palo
Alto just outside the jurisdiction of
Menlo Park.
In addition to recommending the
project be cut from 1275 to 500 units,
the council suggested that the proj
ect include no buildings over 35 feet
high, the density be reduced from 28
to four units per acre and the project
be built in phases, with a joint review
committee consisting of representa
tives from Menlo Park, Palo Alto,
Stanford and San Mateo County
evaluating the project after each
phase is built.
Doty said that, although he under
stands the residents' concerns about
the project, he feels their request to
keep the density down to four units
per acre is unfair. "It's not only ex

treme, it's politically unrealistic in
that the city of Palo Alto has made it
very clear to the University over the
years that it wants a project devel
oped to a considerable density so
that the resulting units won't be
overly expensive. They (the Palo Alto
City Council) not only want housing,
they want affordable housing," Doty
said.
Williams said the University is still
considering the density of the units
in the project. "We're considering
the density problem, but we're trying
to balance three things: the need for
housing, the cost of housing and the
effect it will have on the neighboring
areas and the environment as a
whole," Williams said.
The University is already planning
to build the project in phases and
would be open to the council's pro
posal for a joint review committee "if
it would be part of the ongoing con
sultation on the project. But if it were
part of an ongoing review, we would
not agree to it," Doty said. "As it is,
we've tried to consult with Menlo

Park, and that's why we undertook
planning meetings before the plans
were first drawn up. It's not as if we
unilaterally went our way," he ex- ,
plained.
Parr said that both current resi
dents of the area and future residents
of the project would benefit if the
project were built somewhere else.
"When you think of family housing,
that is not what you think of. The
traffic is a very negative aspect. From ,
a real estate point of view, it's;
dumb," Parr said.
The University will not formally rel
spond to the recommendations untiT
they have been passed on to the Palo
Alto City Council, Doty said.
Both Doty and Williams are sur
prised with the negative reactions
the project is receiving. "We're dis
mayed and we're disappointed. We
thought we were doing something in
accordance with policy and some
thing we thought was needed. We're
startled with the reaction; stunned is
a good word," Williams said.

project be cut from 1275 to 500 units,
the council suggested that the proj
ect include no buildings over 35 feet
high, the density be reduced from 28
to four units per acre and the project
be built in phases, with a joint review
committee consisting of representa
tives from Menlo Park, Palo Alto,
Stanford and San Mateo County
evaluating the project after each
phase is built.
Doty said that, although he under
stands the residents' concerns about
the project, he feels their request to
keep the density down to four units
per acre is unfair. "It's not only ex

treme, it's politically unrealistic in
that the city of Palo Alto has made it
very clear to the University over the
years that it wants a project devel
oped to a considerable density so
that the resulting units won't be
overly expensive. They (the Palo Alto
City Council) not only want housing,
they want affordable housing," Doty
said.
Williams said the University is still
considering the density of the units
in the project. "We're considering
the density problem, but we're trying
to balance three things: the need for
housing, the cost of housing and the
effect it will have on the neighboring
areas and the environment as a
whole," Williams said.
The University is already planning
to build the project in phases and
would be open to the council's pro
posal for a joint review committee "if
it would be part of the ongoing con
sultation on the project. But if it were
part of an ongoing review, we would
not agree to it," Doty said. "As it is,
we've tried to consult with Menlo

Park, and that's why we undertook
planning meetings before the plans
were first drawn up. It's not as if we
unilaterally went our way," he ex- ,
plained.
Parr said that both current resi
dents of the area and future residents
of the project would benefit if the
project were built somewhere else.
"When you think of family housing,
that is not what you think of. The
traffic is a very negative aspect. From ,
a real estate point of view, it's;
dumb," Parr said.
The University will not formally rel
spond to the recommendations untiT
they have been passed on to the Palo
Alto City Council, Doty said.
Both Doty and Williams are sur
prised with the negative reactions
the project is receiving. "We're dis
mayed and we're disappointed. We
thought we were doing something in
accordance with policy and some
thing we thought was needed. We're
startled with the reaction; stunned is
a good word," Williams said.
In yet another episode in the continuing battle
over the proposed Stanford West housing proj
ect , the Menlo Park City Council recommended
Tuesday night that the University reduce the size
of the project to 500 units.
Administrators here criticized the recom
mendations as "unrealistic," while Menlo Park
City Council members said the proposals repre
sent the "interests of Menlo Park residents."
Andy Doty, the University's director of com
munity relations, said, "I think it's unlikely that
the project could be reduced that greatly and still
be economically viable and serve the housing
needs of the University. If we followed all their
recommendations, I doubt if there would be a

project. It's as simple as that."
Director of Planning Phil Williams also said
Stanford West would be "a quite different proj
ect" than that which was originally proposed if
Stanford followed Menlo Park's recom
mendations.
"At that scale it would be more like your typical
two- or three-story garden aporimonK yon see a
lot of around here. It would be more comfortable
for people who don't want to see a change. On
the down side, though, it would be failure to
exploit the property to its fullest potential. Fail
ing to use that property would be a mistake,"
Williams said.
According to Menlo Park councilwoman Kay
Parr, the recommendations were requested by
residents living near the project site.

"They (the recommendations) represent what
the public is asking for, and what our city is
asking for. The recommendations are based on
comments we've heard from the public in the
course of many meetings with the city council
and the planning commission," she said.
"Originall* we were responding to the proj
ect's impact report. As we went
along we bedme much moro av/are of the inter
est of Menlo residents. What they are saying
is that they don't want anything drastically
different than what they already have. In essence
what they want is the same type of housing that is
on the other side of the (San Francisquito)
creek," she explained.

The University is not obligated to
follow the council's recom
mendations because the proposed
project, to be built on 46 acres near
Willow Road, lies in the city of Palo
Alto just outside the jurisdiction of
Menlo Park.
