# Menlo requests Stanford West reduction
## 
### TIM GRIEVE Staff writer 
In yet another episode in the continuing battle
over the proposed Stanford West housing proj
ect , the Menlo Park City Council recommended
Tuesday night that the University reduce the size
of the project to 500 units.
Administrators here criticized the recom
mendations as "unrealistic," while Menlo Park
City Council members said the proposals repre
sent the "interests of Menlo Park residents."
Andy Doty, the University's director of com
munity relations, said, "I think it's unlikely that
the project could be reduced that greatly and still
be economically viable and serve the housing
needs of the University. If we followed all their
recommendations, I doubt if there would be a

project. It's as simple as that."
Director of Planning Phil Williams also said
Stanford West would be "a quite different proj
ect" than that which was originally proposed if
Stanford followed Menlo Park's recom
mendations.
"At that scale it would be more like your typical
two- or three-story garden aporimonK yon see a
lot of around here. It would be more comfortable
for people who don't want to see a change. On
the down side, though, it would be failure to
exploit the property to its fullest potential. Fail
ing to use that property would be a mistake,"
Williams said.
According to Menlo Park councilwoman Kay
Parr, the recommendations were requested by
residents living near the project site.

"They (the recommendations) represent what
the public is asking for, and what our city is
asking for. The recommendations are based on
comments we've heard from the public in the
course of many meetings with the city council
and the planning commission," she said.
"Originall* we were responding to the proj
ect's impact report. As we went
along we bedme much moro av/are of the inter
est of Menlo residents. What they are saying
is that they don't want anything drastically
different than what they already have. In essence
what they want is the same type of housing that is
on the other side of the (San Francisquito)
creek," she explained.
