# Graduation speakers chosen for eloquence
## 
### JASON LEIDER 
During the past five years, the University has
been able to attract four prominent bureaucratic
officials as its commencement speakers. Even
so, senior class president Kevin O'Beirne said
that the key factor that weighs in the selection
process is the individual's eloquence and the
anticipated value of the speech.
In choosing a speaker, the first step is to seek
people who would be interesting and entertain
ing speakers, O'Beirne said. For this year, a few
of the possible candidates were William Hewlett
and David Packard, founders of Hewlett-
Packard; Robert Rosenzweig, former vice
president for public affairs here and current
president of the American Association of Uni
versities; Richard Lyman, former University
president and current president of the Rockefel
ler Foundation; and George Shultz, Secretary of
State and a former professor here.
Larry Horton, director of government rela
tions here, said the committee, consisting of
individuals invited at the request of the presi
dent, sought someone who will give a good
commencement address and who the graduat
ing class will appreciate. The types of speakers
chosen in the past have little influence on future
committee's decisions. "The tendencies of pre
sent committees are no different than those fol
lowed by the former committees, even during
the '605," he said.
Previous selections have included political
figures such as then Food and Drug Administra
tion Commissioner Kennedy, U.N. Ambassador
Andrew Young, Deputy Secretary of State War
ren Christopher and Supreme Court lustice
Sandra Day O'Connor.
Senior class president Katy Dore, who also
served in the selection committee, said serious
consideration was devoted by committee mem
bers this year to possibly choosing someone
from a field such as business or entertainment
since the committee was concerned with
exhibiting a consistent trend of only choosing
speakers on the basis of national political prom
inence.
The committee tries not to select controver

sial individuals who could possibly alienate fac
ulty, alumni or the members ol the graduating'
class, she said.
Although committee members denied a ten
dency to choose Stanford affiliates, the
candidates submitted to Kennedy were all as
sociated with the University.
"Overall seniors are very happy with Presi
dent Kennedy's final decision of Shultz as com
mencement speaker," Dore said. They view
Shultz as not only an important government of
tidal, but also as an individual devoted to the
enhancement and encouragement of educa
tion, "someone Stanford should take pride in
honoring," she added.
As to why a speaker would choose to come
here, Marlene Wine, special assistant to the.
president, said, "Money plays a very little part in
the matter Each year the University does offer
each speaker an honorarium, but it is invariably
returned in the form of a donation to Stanford in
the speaker's name.
If not money, then what is the motivation of a
speaker in coming here? The offices of O'Con
not and Srhultz said both speakers saw the o|>
portunity to speak at the University as a
prestigious honor. Shultz's office, in fact, said
the Secretary of State "is delighted to do it."
