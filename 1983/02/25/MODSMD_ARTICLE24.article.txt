## Deukmejian's proposed budget cuts may weaken California Coastal Commission 
### MATT PETITT 
One of Gov. Deukmejian's campaign
pledges was to abolish the California Coastal
Commission, an agency he once termed
meddlesome" because of the allegedly ex
cessive requirements it imposed on coastal
developers. As governor, he has proposed a
set of highly specific budget cuts for the
agency that will limit the Commission's ca
pacity to enforce regulations for coastal de
velopment, according to Ann Notoff, coastal
consultant with the Natural Resources De
fense Council. This function was instrumen
tal in blocking outer continental shelf (OCS)
oil leasing off the California coast in 1981.
Deukmejian proposed a $660,000 cut in
the Energy Impact Planning Division and the
Policy and Planning unit, referred to as the
technical services division. "The cuts are not
across the board cuts," explained Richard
Charter, offshore oil coordinator for Marin
County. "It was a surgical operation aimed at
OCS function," he continued. To Sierra
Club Vice President Michelle Perrault the
cuts "look like they've come out of (Secre
tary of the Interior) James Watt's office."
The cuts are aimed largely at the technical
division of the commission, which is com
posed of mostly scientists and engineers re
sponsible for performing environmental
studies and assessing areas proposed for
development. These studies are necessary
to evaluate permit applications and support
legal action.
Although Calvin Smith, principle analyst
for energy, environmental and coastal pro
grams for the State Department of Finance,
said that the commission will still have
"statutory responsibility and authority to
approve offshore oil development," without
the technical studies, claims Perrault, it is
difficult to bring a violator of commission

regulations to court. This includes the type
of court action that successfully blocked
parts of Lease Sale 53 proposed by Watt, who
attempted to bypass the commission in mak
ing the sales.
According to Coastal Commission Deputy
Director William Travis, "the California
coastline will be open game for offshore oil
drilling." Travis explained that the commis
sion will try to contain the drilling opera
tions, but because of the cuts "our ability
will drop away."
According to Smith, several respon
sibilities previously assumed by the techni
cal division will be transferred to the Office
of Planning and Research, "to provide a
more independent viewpoint" and allow the
administration and other parties to have
more input in the decision making process.
Notoff listed a variety of issues overseen
by the commission that would no longer be
dealt with should the commission lose its
effectiveness. "It's important to point out
that not only will the OCS be covered (with
oil rigs), but our coastal access will stop."
Areas such as the Bolsa Chica wetlands in
Southern California — the largest wetlands
in California — where a project currently
pending would dredge the wetlands and
build a marina and luxury condominiums,
would be unprotected. The area is the only
unspoiled wetlands on the California coast.
Without an effective commission, the
coast will be "just another series of ad hoc,
patchwork buyoffs," said Notoff. Dave
Fogarty, conservation coordinator of the
Loma Prieta Chapter of the Sierra Club adds
that shopping centers will appear in areas
appropriate for coast-dependent industries,
such as fishing.
The commission has been a target of criti
cism since its inception in 1972. That year

California voters passed the Coastal Initia
tive requiring the state legislature to pass a
coastal act recognizing the coastal zone as a
distinct and valuable resource and setting
forth provisions for the state-wide planning
of its use.
The Coastal Act in 1976 included provi
sions for protection and maintenance of the
coastline, restoration of the coastal envi
ronment, maximum public access and prior
ity of development for those industries de
pendent on the coast. According to Fogarty,
a major source of controversy has been the
requirement that public access be a part of
all permits issued by the commission. The
requirement is a burden to some devel
opers, but the California tidelands are con
sidered public property under state and fed
eral law, according to Fogarty.
The commission has also been criticized
for attempting "social engineering'' because
of the Coastal Act requirements that major
housing developments provide low- and
moderate-income housing units. Coastal
housing developments tend to be expensive
due to the nature of the real estate.
"The basic probjem is that the California
coast is among the most valuable pieces of
real estate in the world," Travis said. The
coastal areas are among the fastest growing
in the state and are sought by a number of
"rich and powerful interests," he con
tinued. Compounding the problems of de
veloping an area that is sought so competi
tively by developers, Travis said, are
the presence of oil, the public's right to
long-term coastal use and the ecological
sensitivity of the coastal environment.
"The Coastal Commission ends up being a
kind of 'U.N.' for land issues in California,"
said Travis. "It was set up to deal with con
troversy, but the controversy is blamed on

the commission members."
One of Deukmejian's criticisms of the
commission is that it is "too extreme in deal
ing with offshore oil," said Travis. "But there
are no outstanding denials of energy proj
ects and the vast majority of commission
actions are non-controversial," he said.
In reaction to the controversy over
offshore oil drilling, Congress omitted funds
for offshore leasing north of Morro Bay in its
last appropriations bill. The effective ban on
leasing in these areas only lasts through the
end of fiscal year 1983, however.
Rep. Leon Panetta (D-Monterey) and Sen.
Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) are currently spon
soring bills that would ban all offshore oil
drilling operations north of Morro Bay to the
Oregon border until the year 2000.
The offshore oil controversy during the
past two years began with a proposal by Sec
retary Watt that the United States inventory
its natural resources, including oil, in order
to manage them effectively. The leases sold
by Watt, however, not only included explor
atory rights, but also the right to develop,
according to Travis. He said that an oil com
pany that proceeds to develop one of these
leased tracts can only be regulated, not
stopped.
The 11 drilling operations in tracts of Lease
Sale 53 near San Luis Obispo are indications
of the current risks involved in offshore oil
drilling, accordingto Charter. "There seems
to be a series of recurring oil spills — not all
of them minor," Charter said. In addition
the 11 operations contribute "a lot of smog,"
and the high density of operations in that
area makes it "basically a bowling alley as far
as fishermen go. All the things they said
were not going to happen seem to be hap
pening."

The problem of cleaning up oil spill is
particularly bad in Northern ( alifornia. 1 a
spill occurs, it will always rea< h shore, ac
cording to Travis And once on hore,oilon
the rocky beaches that cov'-r much of
Northern California often cannot be
cleaned.
The outcome of the budget process will
determine much of the late of the commis
sion. Even if some of the proposed c uts are
rejected by the state legislature, the gover
nor has the authority to make specific
changes in the approved budget that can
only be overriden by a two-thirds vote. In
any case, the current political struggle is
likely to have a far-reaching impact on future
development along the California ( oastline.

that not only will the OCS be covered (with
oil rigs), but our coastal access will stop."
Areas such as the Bolsa Chica wetlands in
Southern California — the largest wetlands
in California — where a project currently
pending would dredge the wetlands and
build a marina and luxury condominiums,
would be unprotected. The area is the only
unspoiled wetlands on the California coast.
Without an effective commission, the
coast will be "just another series of ad hoc,
patchwork buyoffs," said Notoff. Dave
Fogarty, conservation coordinator of the
Loma Prieta Chapter of the Sierra Club adds
that shopping centers will appear in areas
appropriate for coast-dependent industries,
such as fishing.
The commission has been a target of criti
cism since its inception in 1972. That year

California voters passed the Coastal Initia
tive requiring the state legislature to pass a
coastal act recognizing the coastal zone as a
distinct and valuable resource and setting
forth provisions for the state-wide planning
of its use.
The Coastal Act in 1976 included provi
sions for protection and maintenance of the
coastline, restoration of the coastal envi
ronment, maximum public access and prior
ity of development for those industries de
pendent on the coast. According to Fogarty,
a major source of controversy has been the
requirement that public access be a part of
all permits issued by the commission. The
requirement is a burden to some devel
opers, but the California tidelands are con
sidered public property under state and fed
eral law, according to Fogarty.
The commission has also been criticized
for attempting "social engineering'' because
of the Coastal Act requirements that major
housing developments provide low- and
moderate-income housing units. Coastal
housing developments tend to be expensive
due to the nature of the real estate.
"The basic probjem is that the California
coast is among the most valuable pieces of
real estate in the world," Travis said. The
coastal areas are among the fastest growing
in the state and are sought by a number of
"rich and powerful interests," he con
tinued. Compounding the problems of de
veloping an area that is sought so competi
tively by developers, Travis said, are
the presence of oil, the public's right to
long-term coastal use and the ecological
sensitivity of the coastal environment.
"The Coastal Commission ends up being a
kind of 'U.N.' for land issues in California,"
said Travis. "It was set up to deal with con
troversy, but the controversy is blamed on

the commission members."
One of Deukmejian's criticisms of the
commission is that it is "too extreme in deal
ing with offshore oil," said Travis. "But there
are no outstanding denials of energy proj
ects and the vast majority of commission
actions are non-controversial," he said.
In reaction to the controversy over
offshore oil drilling, Congress omitted funds
for offshore leasing north of Morro Bay in its
last appropriations bill. The effective ban on
leasing in these areas only lasts through the
end of fiscal year 1983, however.
Rep. Leon Panetta (D-Monterey) and Sen.
Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) are currently spon
soring bills that would ban all offshore oil
drilling operations north of Morro Bay to the
Oregon border until the year 2000.
The offshore oil controversy during the
past two years began with a proposal by Sec
retary Watt that the United States inventory
its natural resources, including oil, in order
to manage them effectively. The leases sold
by Watt, however, not only included explor
atory rights, but also the right to develop,
according to Travis. He said that an oil com
pany that proceeds to develop one of these
leased tracts can only be regulated, not
stopped.
The 11 drilling operations in tracts of Lease
Sale 53 near San Luis Obispo are indications
of the current risks involved in offshore oil
drilling, accordingto Charter. "There seems
to be a series of recurring oil spills — not all
of them minor," Charter said. In addition
the 11 operations contribute "a lot of smog,"
and the high density of operations in that
area makes it "basically a bowling alley as far
as fishermen go. All the things they said
were not going to happen seem to be hap
pening."

The problem of cleaning up oil spill is
particularly bad in Northern ( alifornia. 1 a
spill occurs, it will always rea< h shore, ac
cording to Travis And once on hore,oilon
the rocky beaches that cov'-r much of
Northern California often cannot be
cleaned.
The outcome of the budget process will
determine much of the late of the commis
sion. Even if some of the proposed c uts are
rejected by the state legislature, the gover
nor has the authority to make specific
changes in the approved budget that can
only be overriden by a two-thirds vote. In
any case, the current political struggle is
likely to have a far-reaching impact on future
development along the California ( oastline.

One of Gov. Deukmejian's campaign
pledges was to abolish the California Coastal
Commission, an agency he once termed
meddlesome" because of the allegedly ex
cessive requirements it imposed on coastal
developers. As governor, he has proposed a
set of highly specific budget cuts for the
agency that will limit the Commission's ca
pacity to enforce regulations for coastal de
velopment, according to Ann Notoff, coastal
consultant with the Natural Resources De
fense Council. This function was instrumen
tal in blocking outer continental shelf (OCS)
oil leasing off the California coast in 1981.
Deukmejian proposed a $660,000 cut in
the Energy Impact Planning Division and the
Policy and Planning unit, referred to as the
technical services division. "The cuts are not
across the board cuts," explained Richard
Charter, offshore oil coordinator for Marin
County. "It was a surgical operation aimed at
OCS function," he continued. To Sierra
Club Vice President Michelle Perrault the
cuts "look like they've come out of (Secre
tary of the Interior) James Watt's office."
The cuts are aimed largely at the technical
division of the commission, which is com
posed of mostly scientists and engineers re
sponsible for performing environmental
studies and assessing areas proposed for
development. These studies are necessary
to evaluate permit applications and support
legal action.
Although Calvin Smith, principle analyst
for energy, environmental and coastal pro
grams for the State Department of Finance,
said that the commission will still have
"statutory responsibility and authority to
approve offshore oil development," without
the technical studies, claims Perrault, it is
difficult to bring a violator of commission

regulations to court. This includes the type
of court action that successfully blocked
parts of Lease Sale 53 proposed by Watt, who
attempted to bypass the commission in mak
ing the sales.
According to Coastal Commission Deputy
Director William Travis, "the California
coastline will be open game for offshore oil
drilling." Travis explained that the commis
sion will try to contain the drilling opera
tions, but because of the cuts "our ability
will drop away."
According to Smith, several respon
sibilities previously assumed by the techni
cal division will be transferred to the Office
of Planning and Research, "to provide a
more independent viewpoint" and allow the
administration and other parties to have
more input in the decision making process.
Notoff listed a variety of issues overseen
by the commission that would no longer be
dealt with should the commission lose its
effectiveness. "It's important to point out
that not only will the OCS be covered (with
oil rigs), but our coastal access will stop."
