# Energy conservation programs save money, cut consumption
## 
### FAY DUFFNER 
Stanford tuition will go up 10
percent next year, and part of
this increase reflects the ever
increasing cost of energy — the
fastest growing sector of the
University's operating budget.
Energy costs comprised less
than 1 percent of the 1972
budget and will comprise 6 to 8
percent of the 1983 budget,
making the University's energy
bill for this fiscal year an esti
mated $10 to $12 million, or
more than $30,000 every day,
according to Karl Johnson, En
ergy Program Office (EPO) di
rector.
In an attempt to cut its en
ergy costs, the University has
developed several programs to
modify campus use of its four
major utilities — electricity,
natural gas, steam and chilled
water.
According to the EPO, Stan
ford is one of the largest en
ergy consumers in Northern
California. As the University
continues to grow and energy
costs continue to escalate,
there is a need to stabilize en
ergy consumption by reducing
energy use in existing facilities.
The University has especially
high potential for teaching a
commitment to energy con
servation. A combination of
education and technology may
allow Stanford to achieve an
energy use stabilization if en
ergy consumption is cut by 25

percent over the next three or
four years.
Most of the energy used
here is in the form of electricity
and natural gas purchased
from Pacific Gas and Electric
(PG&E). According to the EPO,
55 percent of all energy use is
in academic buildings, 23 per
cent is the Medical Center, 15
percent is in housing, and 7
percent is in other auxiliaries.
Three conservation offices
monitor energy use in the
academic buildings, Medical
Center and student housing.
Since the academic build
ings on campus use the largest
amount of energy, the Univer
sity established the EPO in
1978, in conjunction with the
Facilities and Services Depart
ment. The EPO is responsible
for controlling energy use in
classrooms, the Quad, librar
ies and other academic build
ings.
According to Johnson, the
EPO has just completed an
18-month Energy Action Plan
predicting costs and energy
savings expected for several
campus projects now being
implemented. The EPO also
forecasts the prices for Stan
ford's future energy needs.
Johnson expressed the diffi
culty in making these predic
tions, stating that energy costs
can vary even with the wea
ther. "Stanford saved $1 mil
lion last year because PG&E
was able to produce so much

extra inexpensive hydropower
due to the heavy rains,"
Johnson said.
Programs organized by the
EPO have also conserved en
ergy here. Building energy use
studies were followed by en
gineering modifications in the
17 largest electricity-using
academic buildings. For in
stance, campus-wide relamp-

ing has saved an estimated
$800,000, and with more light
ing modifications planned, will
facilitate up to a 10 percent re
duction relative to growth in
electricity costs next year, ac
cording to Johnson. Indoor
lighting changes include instal
lations of more energy efficient
fluorescent lamps in place of
incandescent lamps and addi

tions of sensors and controls
for automatic lighting shutoffs.
High pressure sodium lamps
are appearing on campus for
outdoor lighting and daylight
compensating lights which dim
when outdoor light is bright
are being tested in Brannerand
Meyer Library.
Many modifications have
also been made to more effi-

ciently regulate the heating,
ventilation and cooling sys
tems (HVAC) in existing build
ings.
Conservation is achieved by
means other than technologi
cal applications, however. The
EPO campus-wide program
called Building Energy Mana
gers consist of students, fac
ulty or employee managers

who monitor energy use and
provide cost/consumption re
ports to various academic
deans.
Audits are sometimes rec
ommended for older and
larger structures with the
greatest potential for energy
savings. If savings are substan
tial, a formal technical audit is
undertaken. Then a grant
search for public and private
funding is undertaken, and the
final decision for or against re
trofitting is made based on an
economic analysis of internal
rate of return and a five-year
simple payback period.
The Housing Energy Conser
vation Center (HECC) uses a
similar auditing approach in
making retrofits to alleviate
their estimated $3.6 million
energy bill for 1983. Some of
the projects undertaken by the
HECC include lighting retrofits
such as the incandescent to
fluorescent light conversion in
Escondido Village, Stern, Wil
bur, Florence Moore and
Crothers Memorial resi
dences.
Some of these projects are
being financed by a 3 percent
loan from the Department of
Housing and Urban Develop
ment for $1.2 million."The
loan is like a grant to Stanford
to support experimental en
ergy programs being tried out
on the Stanford community,"
said Teresa Bertsch, HECC di
rector.

The HECC also has an educa
tional role and is trying to mod
ify students' energy use habits.
Simple actions such as turning
off every other light in hall
ways, sharing refrigerators,
and charging for water beds
has already helped to save
about $1 million in housing
costs since the HECC was
founded in 1976, according to
Bertsch.
Energy representatives in
each dormitory act as liaisons
between the HECC and stu
dents. The representatives dis
tribute information, set up
sttde shows at house meetings,
and read meters to maintain
energy use charts located in
each house. They may also play
a crucial role in a new three
month monetary incentive
program for energy conserva
tion which began Feb. 18,1983.
John Eaton, director of the
pilot program, said that
selected residences will re
ceive cash awards for 5 to 10
percent reductions in energy
use. These cash incentives will
be given out the week of May
23 and will range from $130 to
$700.
Students who want to de
velop innovative hands-on en
ergy conservation projects can
obtain funding from a HECC
project fund and should con
tact the HECC for funding ap
plication guidelines.
The HECC is also involved in
the recommendation of design

features for new campus hous
ing. Recommendations for
solar retrofitting, double
paned windows and natural
lighting were made to the ar
chitects who designed the new
student housing complex and
later implemented.
Several other innovations
could supplement the Univer
sity's energy supply with re
newable and recoverable
energies. Specifically, solar
energy may become a viable
option for deGuerre Pool or
campus dormitories it a third
party financing scheme is de
vised. Solar projects are not
currently cost-eHect'tve under
University guidelines because
there are no special low
interest loans available to the
University for the proposed
solar projects.
The University instead is
focusing on a c
project. Construction of the
proposed cogeneration plant
will allow Stanford to meet its
needs for steam and electricity
concurrently by sequentially
producing electricity and
thermal energy from a single
natural gas fuel source. The es
timated $45 million project has
not yet received approval tor
design and construction be
cause of various environmen
tal considerations which must
be taken into account, accord
ing to lack Ban kle, consulting

agement .

servation. A combination of
education and technology may
allow Stanford to achieve an
energy use stabilization if en
ergy consumption is cut by 25

percent over the next three or
four years.
Most of the energy used
here is in the form of electricity
and natural gas purchased
from Pacific Gas and Electric
(PG&E). According to the EPO,
55 percent of all energy use is
in academic buildings, 23 per
cent is the Medical Center, 15
percent is in housing, and 7
percent is in other auxiliaries.
Three conservation offices
monitor energy use in the
academic buildings, Medical
Center and student housing.
Since the academic build
ings on campus use the largest
amount of energy, the Univer
sity established the EPO in
1978, in conjunction with the
Facilities and Services Depart
ment. The EPO is responsible
for controlling energy use in
classrooms, the Quad, librar
ies and other academic build
ings.
According to Johnson, the
EPO has just completed an
18-month Energy Action Plan
predicting costs and energy
savings expected for several
campus projects now being
implemented. The EPO also
forecasts the prices for Stan
ford's future energy needs.
Johnson expressed the diffi
culty in making these predic
tions, stating that energy costs
can vary even with the wea
ther. "Stanford saved $1 mil
lion last year because PG&E
was able to produce so much

extra inexpensive hydropower
due to the heavy rains,"
Johnson said.
Programs organized by the
EPO have also conserved en
ergy here. Building energy use
studies were followed by en
gineering modifications in the
17 largest electricity-using
academic buildings. For in
stance, campus-wide relamp-

ing has saved an estimated
$800,000, and with more light
ing modifications planned, will
facilitate up to a 10 percent re
duction relative to growth in
electricity costs next year, ac
cording to Johnson. Indoor
lighting changes include instal
lations of more energy efficient
fluorescent lamps in place of
incandescent lamps and addi

tions of sensors and controls
for automatic lighting shutoffs.
High pressure sodium lamps
are appearing on campus for
outdoor lighting and daylight
compensating lights which dim
when outdoor light is bright
are being tested in Brannerand
Meyer Library.
Many modifications have
also been made to more effi-

ciently regulate the heating,
ventilation and cooling sys
tems (HVAC) in existing build
ings.
Conservation is achieved by
means other than technologi
cal applications, however. The
EPO campus-wide program
called Building Energy Mana
gers consist of students, fac
ulty or employee managers

who monitor energy use and
provide cost/consumption re
ports to various academic
deans.
Audits are sometimes rec
ommended for older and
larger structures with the
greatest potential for energy
savings. If savings are substan
tial, a formal technical audit is
undertaken. Then a grant
search for public and private
funding is undertaken, and the
final decision for or against re
trofitting is made based on an
economic analysis of internal
rate of return and a five-year
simple payback period.
The Housing Energy Conser
vation Center (HECC) uses a
similar auditing approach in
making retrofits to alleviate
their estimated $3.6 million
energy bill for 1983. Some of
the projects undertaken by the
HECC include lighting retrofits
such as the incandescent to
fluorescent light conversion in
Escondido Village, Stern, Wil
bur, Florence Moore and
Crothers Memorial resi
dences.
Some of these projects are
being financed by a 3 percent
loan from the Department of
Housing and Urban Develop
ment for $1.2 million."The
loan is like a grant to Stanford
to support experimental en
ergy programs being tried out
on the Stanford community,"
said Teresa Bertsch, HECC di
rector.

The HECC also has an educa
tional role and is trying to mod
ify students' energy use habits.
Simple actions such as turning
off every other light in hall
ways, sharing refrigerators,
and charging for water beds
has already helped to save
about $1 million in housing
costs since the HECC was
founded in 1976, according to
Bertsch.
Energy representatives in
each dormitory act as liaisons
between the HECC and stu
dents. The representatives dis
tribute information, set up
sttde shows at house meetings,
and read meters to maintain
energy use charts located in
each house. They may also play
a crucial role in a new three
month monetary incentive
program for energy conserva
tion which began Feb. 18,1983.
John Eaton, director of the
pilot program, said that
selected residences will re
ceive cash awards for 5 to 10
percent reductions in energy
use. These cash incentives will
be given out the week of May
23 and will range from $130 to
$700.
Students who want to de
velop innovative hands-on en
ergy conservation projects can
obtain funding from a HECC
project fund and should con
tact the HECC for funding ap
plication guidelines.
The HECC is also involved in
the recommendation of design

features for new campus hous
ing. Recommendations for
solar retrofitting, double
paned windows and natural
lighting were made to the ar
chitects who designed the new
student housing complex and
later implemented.
Several other innovations
could supplement the Univer
sity's energy supply with re
newable and recoverable
energies. Specifically, solar
energy may become a viable
option for deGuerre Pool or
campus dormitories it a third
party financing scheme is de
vised. Solar projects are not
currently cost-eHect'tve under
University guidelines because
there are no special low
interest loans available to the
University for the proposed
solar projects.
The University instead is
focusing on a c
project. Construction of the
proposed cogeneration plant
will allow Stanford to meet its
needs for steam and electricity
concurrently by sequentially
producing electricity and
thermal energy from a single
natural gas fuel source. The es
timated $45 million project has
not yet received approval tor
design and construction be
cause of various environmen
tal considerations which must
be taken into account, accord
ing to lack Ban kle, consulting
director of facility project man
agement .

Stanford tuition will go up 10
percent next year, and part of
this increase reflects the ever
increasing cost of energy — the
fastest growing sector of the
University's operating budget.
Energy costs comprised less
than 1 percent of the 1972
budget and will comprise 6 to 8
percent of the 1983 budget,
making the University's energy
bill for this fiscal year an esti
mated $10 to $12 million, or
more than $30,000 every day,
according to Karl Johnson, En
ergy Program Office (EPO) di
rector.
In an attempt to cut its en
ergy costs, the University has
developed several programs to
modify campus use of its four
major utilities — electricity,
natural gas, steam and chilled
water.
According to the EPO, Stan
ford is one of the largest en
ergy consumers in Northern
California. As the University
continues to grow and energy
costs continue to escalate,
there is a need to stabilize en
ergy consumption by reducing
energy use in existing facilities.
The University has especially
high potential for teaching a
