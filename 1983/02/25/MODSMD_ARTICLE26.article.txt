## Wazzu's talent overwhelms Card hoopsters 
### STEVE ODELL Senior sports writer 
lust when the nightmare was
thought to be over, Stanford
reminded 3535 fans at Maples
Pavilion last night that there are
still remnants of years gone by
present, the ghost of losing
seasons past haunting the Car
dinal in its 79-69 Pacific-10 Con
ference basketball loss to
Washington State.

Stanford basketball, obvi
ously on the way to breaking its
losing tradition, took a small
detour as the Cardinal commit
ted 24 turnovers in the
sloppily-played contest. It was
Stanford's fourth straight loss,
dropping it to 12-11 overall and
4-9 in league play.
Washington State, now 19-5
overall and 11-3 for a solid sec
ond place in the conference,

broke open a one-point game
with a 17-2 spurt midway
through the second half,
helped along by six Cardinal
turnovers. The Cougars held
Stanford scoreless for over 3'/2
minutes in one stretch during
the streak.
"We're trying to take a posi
tive outlook,'' said Stanford
coach Tom Davis after the
game. "Washington State is a

very nice ball club. They're
deep and they're talented, and
I think you can understand
after tonight whv they've won
the games they've won.
"I don't want to get too
down because it wasn't there
tonight," Davis continued.
"The effort was there, but the
efficiency wasn't.
"It's over. Now we've got to
start worrying about Washing
ton."
Senior forward Steve Harriet
led the Cougars with 26 points
on 12-of-18 shooting from the
field, to offset Stanford guard
Keith jones' game-high 28
point performance. Harriet
traded off between 17-foot
jumpers out front against a
Cardinal zone and turnaround
jumpers off the glass inside.
"He's very underrated,"
Davis said of Harriet. "I don't
know if the general public un
derstands just how good he is.
He's definitely a candidate for
player of the year in the Pac-10.
He's a workman, not flashy,
but he gets the job done."
WSU shot 62.7 percent from
the field, and at a 77.3 percent
clip in the second half when
they repeatedly burned the
Cardinal fullcourt press with
long passes for short jumpers
and a variety of slam dunks.
"They kicked us on the
boards at times," Davis said.
"They just seemed to get of
fensive rebound after offen
sive rebound. It was really de
moralizing, we'd play pretty
good defense and then they'd
come in and slam one.
"They just came out and con
trolled the game."
The Cardinal had cut the lead
to one point after trailing 30-26
at halftime when lones made a
jump shot off a penetration
move in the key to make the
score 38-37 with 15:38 remain
ing.
But then senior forward Har
riet, who had six points during
the deciding run, put down
two jump shots from the choke
post, and Bryan Pollard con
nected on two foul shots to
make the Cougar lead seven
with 12:57 left.
Craig Ehlo scored a lay-in
after Stanford's Steve Brown
hit a baseline jumppr, and then
Aaron Haskins scored seven

straight points to put WSU
ahead 55-39 with 9:28 left. Has
kins hit a turnaround jumper
over Hans Wichary, converted
a three-point play on a lay-up
off a lob feed from Ehlo, and
followed a missed shot to give
the Cougars their 16-point ad
vantage.
The Cardinal followed with a
six-point flourish of its own,
cutting the lead to 55-45 with
7:58 remaining, but 10 points
was as close as Stanford could
get the rest of the way. Jones
was the main factor in keeping
the deficit respectable, con
tinually penetrating the WSU
zone for jumpers in the lane.
Another variable which had a
hand in the turnaround in the
final 20 minutes was the fre
quency with which WSU
traveled to the foul line. Mis
sing its lone attempt of the first
half, the Cougars came back to
hit 15-of-23 for the game and
nearly match Stanford's 15-of
-22 performance at the charity
stripe.
Stanford last led 9-8 with
16:12 to go in the first half be
fore Washington State made
two consecutive buckets and
never looked back. The Cardi
nal did tie the score twice at
24-24 and at 26-26, but the
Cougars responded again with
a couple of baskets, and Keith
Ramee missed two front ends
of one-and-one opportunities
to give WSU its 30-26 halftime
lead.
