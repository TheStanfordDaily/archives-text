### STEVE ODELL Senior staff writer 
Two of the biggest sur
prises of the 1982-8 3
Pacific-10 Conference bas
ketball season, Washington
and Stanford, will try to
move out of the middle of
the Pac when they clash to
morrow afternoon at
Maples Pavilion. Game-time
is 3:30 p.m.
The Huskies, 14-13 overall
and 5-9 in league play, fol
lowing a 96-64 win over
California last night in Ber
keley, are coached by Marv
Harshman, the second
winningest active coach in
the game.
Harshman has taken a
team that lost three of its
starters from last year's NIT
squad and has turned it into
a respectable unit that
knocked off 16th-ranked
Missouri earlier this year.
The Huskies are beating
the also-rans to stay out of
that role themselves, and
are leading the second divi

sion or the Pac-10. Picked lo
finish eighth at the begin
ning of the year, they are
doing it mainly with de
fense.
Stanford meanwhile, is in
seventh place and is in good
stead to have its first win
ning season in 10 years.
Washington is led by
b-foot-6 senior guard Brad
Watson, who pumped in 25
points against the Cardinal
in the first meeting. Watson
is averaging a team-high
14.6 points per game and
has explosive potential, hav
ing eclipsed 20 points seven
times this season.
In the middle for UW is
6-foot-9 Detlef Schrempf,
who has grown 2'/i inches in
the past year. Schrempf is
from West Germany and is
averaging 12.9 points and
7.5 rebounds per game.
The third player averaging
in double figures for the
Huskies is 6-foot-7 forward
