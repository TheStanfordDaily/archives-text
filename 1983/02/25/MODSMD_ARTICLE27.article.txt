## 
### STEVE ODELL Senior staff writer 
Two of the biggest sur
prises of the 1982-8 3
Pacific-10 Conference bas
ketball season, Washington
and Stanford, will try to
move out of the middle of
the Pac when they clash to
morrow afternoon at
Maples Pavilion. Game-time
is 3:30 p.m.
The Huskies, 14-13 overall
and 5-9 in league play, fol
lowing a 96-64 win over
California last night in Ber
keley, are coached by Marv
Harshman, the second
winningest active coach in
the game.
Harshman has taken a
team that lost three of its
starters from last year's NIT
squad and has turned it into
a respectable unit that
knocked off 16th-ranked
Missouri earlier this year.
The Huskies are beating
the also-rans to stay out of
that role themselves, and
are leading the second divi

sion or the Pac-10. Picked lo
finish eighth at the begin
ning of the year, they are
doing it mainly with de
fense.
Stanford meanwhile, is in
seventh place and is in good
stead to have its first win
ning season in 10 years.
Washington is led by
b-foot-6 senior guard Brad
Watson, who pumped in 25
points against the Cardinal
in the first meeting. Watson
is averaging a team-high
14.6 points per game and
has explosive potential, hav
ing eclipsed 20 points seven
times this season.
In the middle for UW is
6-foot-9 Detlef Schrempf,
who has grown 2'/i inches in
the past year. Schrempf is
from West Germany and is
averaging 12.9 points and
7.5 rebounds per game.
The third player averaging
in double figures for the
Huskies is 6-foot-7 forward
Darrell Tanner, a junior
scoring 12.8 points and pul
ling down an even seven
boards per game. Rounding
out the starting UW line-up
is freshman forward Reggie
Rogers and junior guard
David Koehler.
The first time these two
clubs met, Stanford, still
shocked by the absence of
leading scorer and reboun
der John Revelli, shot just
41.2 percent from the floor
against a 2-3 Husky zone in
an 84-65 loss. The Cardinal,
at last check, was the No. 5
field goal shooting team in
the nation, hitting at a sizzl
ing 55.1 clip.
In contrast, the Huskies,
the worst shooters in the
conference at just 43.6 per
cent, shot 54.7 percent from
the floor in Seattle against
the Card.
Washington leads the
series between the two
schools, 40-34, including four
straight wins over the Cardi
nal.
