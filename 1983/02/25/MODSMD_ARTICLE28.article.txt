# Gymnasts in final home meet tonight
## 
### SARAH CARREL 
Both men's and women's gymnastics teams will perform their
routines tonight at Maples Pavilion in their last regular season
meet. The men face UC—Davis while the women tangle with San
Jose State and the University of Arizona.
UC-Davis should pose no problems for the men, as Stanford
disposed of the Aggies by more than 40 points only a week ago.
One small problem for coach Sadao Hamada's team is the back
trouble of freshman superstar Gary Smith. Hamada is not certain
whether Smith will be competing for the all-around title, which
seems to be the only factor that could lower a record season
score.
"I don't know what to expect in team or individual scores,"
Hamada said. He noted the potential for a terrific scoring meet
tonight. Stanford will have the advantage of familiar home
equipment as well as being in the best competitive form thus far
of the season.
Tonight's meet will mark the second time in less than a week
that the Cardinal women have faced the Wildcats. Stanford lost to
Arizona by less than a point last Saturday in a hotly contested
meet in Oregon. Sardina said the home court advantage should
boost Stanford to a close win tonight, although Arizona is the
13th-ranked team in the nation.
"We have an excellent opportunity of beating them," Sardina
said. "I think this is going to be the most exciting meet of the
year."
Tonight's meet will be the final one for seniors Julie Bledsoe,
Karen Hall and Kim Strauss. Bledsoe has not missed a meet since
becoming a Cardinal in 1979. Hall and Strauss are also staples of
the team who will be sorely missed next season.
The senior men will have another opportunity to compete at
home this year, since Maples Pavilion is the site of the Pacific-10
Conference Championships on March 18 and 19.
