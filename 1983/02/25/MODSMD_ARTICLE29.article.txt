Stanford's women fencers
begin two days of competition
today at the NCAA Regional
Championships at Cal State
Northridge. The Cardinal,
coming off a 7-2 dual meet sea
son, is picked to finish second
in the eight-team tournament
behind nationally ranked San
jose State.
"San lose is currently rated
second in the National
Coaches Poll," said head coach
Buzz Hurst, "but we're eager
to have another crack at them.
"We'll be at full strength
now that Alison (Reid) has re
covered from her knee injury,
and I think we can take them
out this time." Stanford's only
regular season losses were to
the Lady Spartans, losing 11-5
at their first meeting and 10-6
two weeks ago.
"Not only do I expect this
team to qualify for Nationals,
but all four of our starters have
the potential to qualify as indi
viduals," Hurst said. "Jennifer
Vu did an excellent job at last
weekend's U.S. Junior Olym
pics."
