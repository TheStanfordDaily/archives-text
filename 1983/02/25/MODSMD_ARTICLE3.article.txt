Five observant Arroyo residents
last Saturday night caught and de
tained two burglary suspects who
were allegedly taking stereo equip
ment from a first floor room, Stan
ford Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer
said yesterday.
The five students involved were
identified by Niemeyer as freshman
Jose Aizpuru, freshman lames Rut
ter, junior Anil Gangolli, graduate
student Tom Hardison, and sopho
more Kirby Shanks. According to
Niemeyer, the students caught and
detained the suspects until the
police arrived.
The two suspects are David
Matthew, 22, of Palo Alto, and Barry
Hudson, 21, also of Palo Alto.
Niemeyer said he could not disclose
whether or not the two have any pre
vious criminal record.
According to Niemeyer, the inci
dent began at about 2 a.m. Sunday,
when the students were returning to
their rooms following a party held in
the dorm earlier in the evening.
The students heard noises in the

bushes outside their rooms and
when they looked out to find the
cause, they saw one of the suspects
who had been at the party earlier
hiding in the bushes. When the stu
dents went outside to question him,
they discovered a cassette deck and
some stereo components belonging
to residents of the dorm. The stu
dents then detained the suspect and
notified the police.
The second suspect was caught by
the students a short time later after

they spotted him wandering near the
bushes.
According to Aizpuru, who was
one of the first students to approach
the suspects, some students became
suspirious of Hudson and Matthew
during the party because no one in
Arroyo knew them and "they didn't
look like students."
Shanks, another student involved
in the capture, said the two had been
"acting obnoxious" at the party and
