Deflecting a mock-attacker's
blows with her wrists and then de
ftly throwing him onto the mat, the
Stanford Self-Defense Club student
was on her way to a green belt in
last Wednesday night's tryouts.
Laura Allen, a graduate student in
applied physics, beamed as she re
joined the eight other club mem
bers in Encina Gym's wrestling
room, while another candidate
quickly stepped up for his test.
As head instructor James Moses
called out such moves as "front
choke, parry, haitto—cross shuto"
the pair in the center would lunge
into a< tion — attacker rushing in to
choke, student grappling in de
fense.
The methods demonstrated in
the tryouts and learned throughout
the quarter are all part of aiki

JuJitsu, which means spiritual har
mony (aiki) and weaponless tech
niques (JuJitsu).
This system, which is about 40
years-old, incorporates techniques
from major martial arts such as
judo, aikido and karate. Students
using it can defend themselves
from one or more attackers ap
proaching from the front, side,
back or above.
Toattain thecolored belt ranksof
yellow, green, blue, purple, brown
and then the differing degrees of
black, students must master certain
moves on the charts, and then
demonstrate their prowess in try
outs such as Wednesday's.
One pupil was awarded his yel
low belt after two months in the
class. Tad Hogg, the club's presi
dent and a black belt himself, said it
takes about two quarters of work to

get a green belt, while the bla< k
usually takes several years.
As Moses said, attaining the
higher individual ranks is only part
of the club's concern with self
defense. Being coeducational, a
major part of the instruction is also
pointed toward rape prevention.
Three of the six black-belted in
structors are women, and the
methods they teach their female
students have been put to use.
Vicki Olivera noted how one of
her students fended off an assail
ant: "She was delivering papers
early in the morning when she was
attacked by a man and knocked
down. It took her a few minutes,
but she got that man off of her and
he was running."
The class itself is one of the Uni
versity's 30 club sports. It meets
twice a week for two hours per day.
