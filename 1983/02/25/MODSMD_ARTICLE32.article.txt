Dooley: 'Walker got burned'
Atlanta — Georgia Coach Vince Dooley
said Heisman Trophy winner Herschel Walk
er had little guidance from those closest to
him and did not really do what he wanted by
signing the most lucrative contract in pro
football history.
Dooley said Walker "got too close to the
fire and got burned," leaving his star tailback
little choice other than to sign the richest
contract in professional football history.
Walker, foregoing a senior season at the
University of Georgia that probably would
have made him college football's all-time
rushing king, signed Wednesday with the
New Jersey Generals of the United States
Football:, ig le for a reported $5 million over
three years. The contract was signed just
hours after the University of Georgia de
clared him ineligible.
Walker broke his silence yesterday and
pronounced himself "ready to step into an
other phase ot my life." He told the reporters
gathered outside his fiancee's Athens, Ga.,
apartment, "There's more fro this than meets
the eye.
The Atlanta Constitution reported yester
day in its late editions that Walker spent
Wednesday evening in his apartment with a
few friends and. when asked if he regretted
the way things turned out, replied, "Yes, but
that's behind me now, and I just look to the
future.''
