## Customs House 'inventories' good food, atmosphere

THE CUSTOMS HOUSE
Bngewater Place
Foster City
(415) 574-7904
Edgewater Place, a shopping
area in Fosler City where The
Customs House is located
looks like a brand-new shop
pingcenter that's trying to look
old and established. The view
across the water of many
brightly -colored A-frame
houses is similar — quaint, yet
at the same time a bit too plas
tic and contrived.
The Customs House fits right
this atmosphere. On the
outside are simulated old
wooden crates stamped with
assorted sayings, yet the inside
i$ nicely decorated in dark blue
apd brown, with high-backed
wicker chairs that provide a
marvelous view of the toy
houses across the water. We
arrived somewhat early (about
5>:30 on a Friday evening —

right in the prime of their
happy hour), so we received an
excellent table. The wall was
entirely glass so that if we
looked down while trying to
read the 9-page menu, we ac
tually started getting seasick!
Back to this 9-page menu. . .
The Customs House offers a
wide variety of "fun" foods.
You know the type — potato
skins, quesadillas, huge salads
and sandwiches, combination
burgers, ribs, chicken and sea
food plates. Atter pouring over
their fantastic "inventory" (as
they call their menu), we finally
decided on pago pago potato
skins with bacon and cheese
($4.90) and "ahhh-sooo"
shrimp ($6.95) as our appetiz
ers.
An asterisk by the potato
skins on the menu denoted
that they were one of "Ed's
favorites." We never did find
out who Ed was, but we did
find out that he has excellent

taste. The potato skins were
fantastic, complemented by a
potato skin filled with sea
soned sour cream. The shrimp
were almost as good — eight
broiled prawns marinated in a
delicious barbecue sauce,
served with thick potato chips
and fried onion rings (which
we decided were a bit too
salty).
We fulfilled our duty as re
viewers when we ordered our
entrees — one of us ordered
the chowder, and the other the
salad (a choice of either is in
cluded with the entree). The
seafood chowder we deemed
good, but nothing special, and
the salad fared better. It in
cluded crisp greens, a cherry
tomato, an artichoke heart, all
served with their special very
chunky bleu cheese dressing.
After the appetizer, we both
remarked that we could have
stopped our meal right there,
and unfortunately, we should

have. The Ribs Rangsapour
($9.95), also known as bar
becue beef ribs, were abun
dant in portion, yet small in
taste and quality. They were a
little tough.
Eduardo's Enchilada Grande
($7.95) was also a disappoint
ment. Maybe we've just been
spoilecJ by Mexican restau
rants, but when we read "a
giant meat enchilada stuffed
arid covered with chile and
cheese," we just assumed that
they meant shredded beef.
However, giant as it was, it was
stuffed with ground beef, and
thus appeared quite over
priced at $7.95. As the ribs, it
was tasty, but nothing more.
We decided to split the
Cookie Monster for dessert
($3.25), mainly because it was
dubbed "Ed's very favorite
thing in the whole wide
world." F d didn't steer us
wrong — in fact we decided
that the next time we go out to

dinner we're taking Ed with us.
Our monster consisted of a
massive chocolate chip cookie
topped with vanilla, chocolate
or English toffee ice cream,
covered with hardened choco
late, and surrounded by whip
ped cream. This dessert is de
finitely not to be missed, no
matter how full you are!
Although we were some
what disappointed by our
meal, we really hate to leave
you with a had impression of
The Customs House. When we
decide to venture there again,
we've decided to follow a few

guidelines. First we II defi
nitely take Ed's advice about
what to order (his favorite
choices are conveniently
marked by an asterisk). Some
of his choices include the
potato skins, che-e-e-esy
onion soup ($3.25), the famous
cobb salad $6.95), th;* Robin
son Potato ($3.95 — a baked
potato stutfed with assorted
ingredients), chicken
rangsapour ($8.95), and of
course, the infamous Cookie
Monster.
You might also just want to

try ordering an appeti/er and
dessert. At least from our expe
rience, these were by far the
best things on the menu. You
also have to remember that
you're paying for fun and at
mosphere in a plate like this,
so the prices may be a bit
steoper than somewhere
farther down the road
The Customs House is open
daily from 11:30 and serves
Sunday brunch from 10 a.m to
2 p.m.
