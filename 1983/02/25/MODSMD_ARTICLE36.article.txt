Savoir fare cafe, which translates to
know food, is a newly opened first-class res
taurant which lives up to its name, located
within walking distance of campus, it pro
v icfos a relaxing setting tor a quick atternoon
lunch on the patio or for a leisurely indoor
dinner in a background of classical music
Healthy garden plants, along with antique
chairs and tables and old prints <>t Stanford
and Palo Alto, provide for a vundertully'
cozy environment.
The proud owner, Die k McAtfey . a partner
of the well-known Gatehouse Restaurant
greets his guests as the) enter and then stops
by during dinner to make sure everything is
lust as it should be.
The French-sounding name is misleading
in reality, the dishes range from Mideastern
to Spanish and Italian rather than French or
continental food.
An appealing cosmopolitan menu consists
of a variety of lighter toods, fresh fruits and
vegetables, top quality meats and specialty
dishes.
The chef is best known for his mouth
watering soups, and his soup-making talents
carry over into his entrees, appetizers and
desserts.
We began our meal with a refreshing
house salad ($1.50 a la carte or free with din
ner entrees), which was made of three types
of lettuce, cucumber, tomatoes and
croutons. Along with our salad, we quickly
devoured two rounds of Roma sesame bread.
While you're enjoying bread and salad we
recommend exploring the imported beer list
that consists of 47 of the world's top quality
brews. We particularly enjoyed the Mac-
Ewan's Edinburgh dark ale as memories of
Cliveden travels came to mind. In March
owner McAfferty plans to start imported
beer-tasting on Sundav afternoons.
For the main course, several specialty dish
es are offered. The entrees pr >v ide generou
portion-, tor even a healthy athlete.

Avid steak-lovers can trv London broil or
leer brochette. The New York strip pepper
•teak prepared in a rich sauce combi
nation of mushrooms, bacon and cracked
>lac k pepper, is also available.
\\ e particularly enjoyed the 1 cheese fondue
or two that consisted of dipping
Libes of sesame Roma bread into an im
ported Swiss c heese and white wine sauce.

All in all, we recommend Savoir Fare to
