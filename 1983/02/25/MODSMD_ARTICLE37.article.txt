While Pier W may conjur up images of
touiisty simps and hokey diving exhibi
tions to some to those looking for an
elegant dining place on an exi ursion into
the i its there 1 s at least one pleasant sur
prise.
Located imong the specialty shops on
the second level of Pier 39 is C hie s Place. It
calls itself ,i seatuod grill and bar and is
designed to look like a turn-of-the-century
dining saloon lhere's frosted glass, pot
ted feins salmon-colored walls and
polished wood and brass to convey the
old -fashioned atmosphere: the waiters
wea tuxedos and sott i lassie al music plays
while \ou dine.
The hostess seated my friend and I at a
table adjacent to the picture window
whii h runs tin length of the restaurant. All
ot the tables aie arranged looking toward
Fisherman s Wharf so as to provide a pic
turesque \ifw of the ba\ From our table
we c ould watch the sailboats and the activ
ity on the Embarcadero.
One e seated, the < aptain brought to our
table an arrangement ot the tresh fish of
the day which featured salmon, petrale
sole, dungeness crab, bluefin tuna and a
variety of other nic e looking pieces of fish.
He carefully displayed each piece, ex
plained the different ways it could be pre
pared and told us which were especially
good that evening. He also told us what on
the menu was frozen at this time of year
(the sauteed sandabs for $7.50 appeared to
be the only thing).
It was a \.erv nice touch to be able to
view the special offerings of the menu in
stead of listening to the usual memorized
recitation by the waiter, although it did
add to the difficulty of deciding which to
choose.
Besides seafood, the menu contains
three pasta inshes — one with pesto
sauce, one wilh a dam and mushroom

sauce and Fetlucine Alfredo — each tor
under $8. There are also three different
steak-, for around $13 each, two less ex
pensive veal dishes, Chic ken Marsala and
tor those who cannot make up their mind
between surf or turf, a steak and lobster
offering tor $21 .95.
Since seafood is their specialty, we opted
for that, but first began with an appetizer
of esc argots. Through some sort of mix up
in the kitchen, they took over halt an hour
to arrive. Our waiter was apologetic and.
from the looks ot things, problems were
not their usual style.
While we waited we partook of a nice
bottle of white wine, but were disap
pointed by the refrigerator-temperature
French bread. They really would benefit
from the effort of heating it to at least room
temperature.
The escargots, though slow in coming,
were wonderful.
As a main course, my companion had
the Dungeness Crab Sautee ($15.95) which
was recommended by the captain for
those with "large appetites." It consisted
of pieces of shelled crab legs sauteed in
butter with mushrooms, wine and a very
light Bearnaise sauce. The crab pieces
were tender and seasoned perfectly. We
had, indeed, stumbled upon a wonderful
way to prepare crab. Along with it came a
very good rice pilaf and a helping of fresh
mixed vegetables.
I decided on the Chef's Special Dinner
($14.25) which began with a bowl of New
England clam chowder, followed by an as
sortment of the seafood specialties.
The chowder was nice and thick with
large pieces of clams throughout, its only
problem being that it was tepid as op
posed to hot.
The seafood combination consisted of a
nice piece of grilled salmon, petrale sole
with a light butter sauce, two tasty sauteed
prawns, one Ovster Rockefeller which was
' a bit heavy on the spinach and light on the
oyster — but good nonetheless, and two
fried scallops which should have left their

breaded coats behind.
Along with tht» dinner ume a serving of
unremarkable Anna Potatoes, which was
more than made up for by the pleasant
mixture of fresh vegetables. Unlike most
vegetable du |our, which always seem to
be overcooked and served drowning
under a gloppy sauce, these pieces ot /uc -
chini and carrot were cooked pert'ec 11 y al
dante with a light seasoning: a good ac
companiment to both of our meals.
After our entrees we decided to share a
single dessert. In lieu of a dessert menu,
though, the waiter rolled over Chic's re
ndition of a Viennese table, and the idea ot
eating only half a portion was short-lived.
We each zeroed in on a wonderful look
ing chocolate-hazlenut torte, but ligured
that in order to get a better idea of the
dessert offerings we should each try some
thing different. I won the torte. and my
companion had a strawberry concotion
called "Melting Moments."
Out immediate instincts were right, for
the torte won hands-down. It is not actu
ally made at the restaurant, but at a nearby
bakery, and words alone cannot describe
it. This bakery supplies the restaurant with
cakes (the night before our visit they fea
tured one with Grand Marnier) and our
waiter claims thoy are all as wonderful as
the hazlenut torte.
The strawberry Melting Moments is a
parfait of various fruit flavors prepared at
the restaurant. While it was good, it was
aptly described by my friend as "nothing
exceptional."
An at Chic's Place, while a bit
extravagant tor some student budgets (our
check was just over $60) is certainly worth
the price. The service, with one exception
involving the esc argots, was very good.
The menu and wine list are each extensive,
the atmosphere pleasant and it certainly
qualities as a good choice of restaurant for
a special evening in the city.

tor those who cannot make up their mind
between surf or turf, a steak and lobster
offering tor $21 .95.
Since seafood is their specialty, we opted
for that, but first began with an appetizer
of esc argots. Through some sort of mix up
in the kitchen, they took over halt an hour
to arrive. Our waiter was apologetic and.
from the looks ot things, problems were
not their usual style.
While we waited we partook of a nice
bottle of white wine, but were disap
pointed by the refrigerator-temperature
French bread. They really would benefit
from the effort of heating it to at least room
temperature.
The escargots, though slow in coming,
were wonderful.
As a main course, my companion had
the Dungeness Crab Sautee ($15.95) which
was recommended by the captain for
those with "large appetites." It consisted
of pieces of shelled crab legs sauteed in
butter with mushrooms, wine and a very
light Bearnaise sauce. The crab pieces
were tender and seasoned perfectly. We
had, indeed, stumbled upon a wonderful
way to prepare crab. Along with it came a
very good rice pilaf and a helping of fresh
mixed vegetables.
I decided on the Chef's Special Dinner
($14.25) which began with a bowl of New
England clam chowder, followed by an as
sortment of the seafood specialties.
The chowder was nice and thick with
large pieces of clams throughout, its only
problem being that it was tepid as op
posed to hot.
The seafood combination consisted of a
nice piece of grilled salmon, petrale sole
with a light butter sauce, two tasty sauteed
prawns, one Ovster Rockefeller which was
' a bit heavy on the spinach and light on the
oyster — but good nonetheless, and two
fried scallops which should have left their

breaded coats behind.
Along with tht» dinner ume a serving of
unremarkable Anna Potatoes, which was
more than made up for by the pleasant
mixture of fresh vegetables. Unlike most
vegetable du |our, which always seem to
be overcooked and served drowning
under a gloppy sauce, these pieces ot /uc -
chini and carrot were cooked pert'ec 11 y al
dante with a light seasoning: a good ac
companiment to both of our meals.
After our entrees we decided to share a
single dessert. In lieu of a dessert menu,
though, the waiter rolled over Chic's re
ndition of a Viennese table, and the idea ot
eating only half a portion was short-lived.
We each zeroed in on a wonderful look
ing chocolate-hazlenut torte, but ligured
that in order to get a better idea of the
dessert offerings we should each try some
thing different. I won the torte. and my
companion had a strawberry concotion
called "Melting Moments."
Out immediate instincts were right, for
the torte won hands-down. It is not actu
ally made at the restaurant, but at a nearby
bakery, and words alone cannot describe
it. This bakery supplies the restaurant with
cakes (the night before our visit they fea
tured one with Grand Marnier) and our
waiter claims thoy are all as wonderful as
the hazlenut torte.
The strawberry Melting Moments is a
parfait of various fruit flavors prepared at
the restaurant. While it was good, it was
aptly described by my friend as "nothing
exceptional."
An at Chic's Place, while a bit
extravagant tor some student budgets (our
check was just over $60) is certainly worth
the price. The service, with one exception
involving the esc argots, was very good.
The menu and wine list are each extensive,
the atmosphere pleasant and it certainly
qualities as a good choice of restaurant for
a special evening in the city.

good that evening. He also told us what on
