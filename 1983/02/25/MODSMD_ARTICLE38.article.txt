"In 1914, men's spirits

Grand Illusion (1937) ★
Fox, Redwood City
During the First World War, a
band of Frenchmen plot to es
cape from a German POW
camp; the class bond shared by
their commander, the aristocrat
de Boeldieu (Pierre Fresnay),
and the German commandant,
von Rauffenstein (Erich von
Stroheim), is stronger than the
patriotic ties between de
Boeldieu and the peasant
Marechal (Jean Gabin) or the
Jewish bourgeois Rosenthal
(Marcel Dalio). Jean Renoir
claimed that he had made this
movie in order to demonstrate
that the real divisions between
men are "horizontal rather
than vertical," and it is not only
one of the most extraordinary
examinations of class distinc
tions ever filmed, but also one
anti-war films.

Last Tango in Paris (1973)
Kresge Auditorium *
Bernardo Bertolucci's study
of a neurotic sexual rela
tionship between a middle
aged man — a one-time Bohe
mian whose wife has just com
mitted suicide — and a young
French bourgeoise may be the
greatest film of the last 20 years.
No one has ever explored sex
uality in movies in as intimate
and unrelenting a manner.
Bertolucci and Marlon Brando,
who plays the tragic hero, are
surely the most amazing direc
tor-actor combination since
D.W. Griffith and Lillian Gish;
to describe what Brando does
for this movie would require
searching for new superlatives.
With Maria Schneider, Jean-
Pierre Leaud, Maria Michi and
Massimo Girotti; screenplay by
Bertolucci and Franco Arcalli;
photographed by Vittorio
Storaro; music by Gato
Barbieri, The paintings in the
opening credits are by Francis
Bacon.
Plays tomorrow evening.
The Last Picture Show (1971)
New Varsity, Palo Alto ★
Peter Bogdanovich made this
lovingly detailed film of the
Larry McMurtry novel (they col
laborated on the adaptation)
about boys who grow up in a
small, dying Texas town. Robert
Surtees shot it, in beautifully
modulated black and whie; it
was the first time an American
film had been photographed in
black and white in some years,
and Surtees' artistry is probably
responsible for the decision of
other filmmakers since to
gamble on such a blatantly un
glamorous approach.
Bogdanovich does a fine job
with his talented cast —
Timothy Bottoms, Jeff Bridges,
Ellen Burstyn, Ben Johnson,
Cloris Leachman and (in an in
offensive inadequate per
formance) Cybill Shepherd.
When this picture was released,
everyone predicted a fabulous
career for Bogdanovich, but
nothing he has made since
comes close to it.
Plays Sunday with Tex.

The Little Foxes (1941) ★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Lillian Hellman's 1939 play
was an attack on capitalism: the
villains are scheming, covetous
turn-of-the-century south
erners — roles that actors still
delight so in playing that the
show is a revival favorite. From
all accounts, Tallulah
Bankhead's stage portrayal of
Regina, the blackmailing pro
tagonist, was the best per
formance she ever gave; in the
movie, Bette Davis does de
tailed, finely understated work,
but she seems to have seized on
the wrong character — she
doesn't begin to suggest this
woman's power to dominate a
family. Instead, we getaportrait
of a bitter, repressed married
spinster. But the movie is well
worth seeing: few American
plays have ever been brought
to the screen in so
craftsmanlike a manner. The
direction is by William Wyler,
the cinematography by the
great Gregg Toland, and the
cast includes, in a rare film ap
pearance, the delicately gifted
Patricia Collinge (repeating her
Broadway performance), as
well as Herbert Marshall, Teresa

Wright, Richard Carlson,
Charles Dingle and Dan
Duryea.
Plays Thursday evening with
Dark Victory.
Dark Victory (1939)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
This Warner Brothers
melodrama, adapted by Casey
Robinson from a George
Brewer-Bertram Bloch play and
directed by Edmund Goulding,
might have been turgid and for
gettable if not for the one magi
cal element: Bette Davis. As Ju
dith Traherne, dying nobly of a
brain tumor, Davis issointense
ly alive in every frame of the
picture that her creeping de
mise seems an outrage; wisely,
the filmmakers cut the film off
immediately after her final
withdrawal to her chamber.
Only Bette Davis could turn a
masochistic weeper like this
into drama. George Brent,
Ronald Reagan, Geraldine
Fitzgerald and a humorously
miscast Hum'phrey Bogart (as a
stable boy) co-star.
Plays Thursday evening with
The Little Foxes.

The Warriors (1979) *
New Varsity, Palo Alto
When this movie was re
leased, the outcry of some
critics and concerned citizens
was vociferous, especially when
a group of kids tore up one of
the New York theaters in which
it had opened. That the picture
made such close contact with
young audiences is not surpris
ing — it's a phenomenally ex
hilarating piece of filmmaking
— but it's hard to believe that
anyone could complain about
the choreographed violence,
which is unreal — animated
comic-strip fantasy. Michael
Beck plays Swan, the "war lord"
of a Coney Island gang that,
wrongly suspected of murder
ing a peaceable chieftain, must
fight its way back to its home
turf through a city full of hostile
rival bands; his comrades in
clude Thomas Waites, James
Remar, Brian Tyler, David
Harris and Dorsey Wright.
David Patrick Kelly plays a psy
cho, Craig Boxley (who co-or
dinated the stunts) is an eerie
adversary on roller skates, and
—■ taking the acting honors
without much competition —
Deborah Van Valkenburgh is a
tough girl who latches onto
Swan. The Warriors is pulp at its
highest level: Walter Hill
directs the chases and fight se
quences with a touch of genius,
David Holden's editing is
sorcery, and Andrew Laszlo, the
photographer, gives the sub
ways and streets of New York a
wild, hallucinogenic glow. The
fabulously effective musical
score is by Barry De Vorzon.
Plays Tuesday evening with
The Wanderers.

The Scarlet Pimpernel (1934)
Fox, Redwood City *
Delightful nonsense,
adapted by a slew of writers
(Robert E. Sherwood, Sam
Berman, Arthur Wimperis and
Lajos Biro) from the Baroness
Orczy novel about a British fop
who leads a double life, liber
ating aristocrats under the very
noses of the officials of the
French Revolution. Leslie How
ard gives one of his most in
gratiating performances in the
title role, and Merle Oberon
looks so ravishing as his de
ceived wife that you may not
notice (at first) how sketchy her
ideas on acting are. With Ray
mond Massey, Nigel Bruce,
Branwell Fletcher, Joan
Gardern and Walter Rilla;
directed by Harold Young.
Plays Monday evening with
Cyrano de Bergerac.
Chilly Scenes of Winter ★
Aquarius, Palo Alto
A recut version of Joan
Micklin Silver's 1979 Head Over
Heels, adapted from Ann Beat
tie's first novel — and one of the
few examples of a movie that
improves on material by a tal
ented writer. Silver is a
screenwriter-director, and her
ear far surpasses her eye: her
strengths show up when the ac
tors open their mouths and the
words that float out of them
seem exactly right. John Heard
and Mary Beth Hurt do fine
work as survivors of the '60s
generation who deal with the
banal, workaday world as
though it were transitory, a
phase in their lives that they can
goof about someday. With
memorable supporting per
formances by Peter Riegeft, the
late Gloria Grahame, Nora
Heflin, Frances Bay and the
endlessly remarkable Kenneth
McMillan,
The Wanderers (1979)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Richard Price's novel, set in
the early '60s, is about an Italian
teenage gang; funny and ob
scene, it has a cumulative emo
tional effect — when you're fin
ished reading it, you feel
touched by the messed-up lives
of the loud-mouthed, street
smart characters. Philip Kauf
man's movie version tries hard
and comes up with some mem
orable scenes (the best is a strip
poker game in which the guys
cheat so the girls will have to re
move more and more of their
clothing), but it fails, to trans
pose Price's tone, delicately
balanced between comic and

tragic. Kaufman and his pho
tographer, Michael Chapman,
employ a number of visual
styles, but none of them seems
really appropriate, and the con
tinued shifting among them
robs the film of one prevailing
style. Screenplay by Rose& Phil
ip Kaufman; the cast includes
Ken Wahl, John Friedrich,
Karen Allen, Toni Kalem and
Linda Manz.
Plays Tuesday evening with
The Warriors.
Frances
Old Mill 6, Mountain View
As Frances Farmer, the os
tensibly gifted young movie star
who was institutionalized for
eight years and was likely a
guinea pig for a late-'4os experi
ment in transorbital lobotomy,
Jessica Lange is about as effec
tive as anyone could be under
the circumstances. (Her role re
quires her to throw close to a
dozen hysterical fits.) She must
have drawn on all her ingenuity
just to keep from sinking with
the rest of the movie, which is a
wretched mess — structurally,
dramatically, psychologically.
Graeme Clifford djrectea; He's
one of the most imaginative
editors in the business, but
you'd never guess it from this
picture. Eric Bergren and
Christopher DeVore con
tributed the largely incom
prehensible script, which gives
Kim Stanley, as Frances' moth
er, the chance for a grotesque,
scenery-chewing performance,
and Sam Shepard a bizarre, in
vented part — Frances' first lov
er, who shows up mysteriously
whenever she is in the throes of
a crisis.
Stavfeky (1974)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Alain Resnais' movie, with a
Jorge Semprun script, is about a
master swindler (Jean-Paul
Belmondo) and his role in the
disintegration of Francein the
early days of World War it, but it
isn't a political movie, despite
the presence of Trotsky and the
use of documentary-style
dialogue (which Semprun had
made work brilliantly for him In
Z five years earlier). In fact,
you're not guaranteed to keep
the immediate narrative
straight, let alone the socio-his
torical background, and the
characters are pasteboard. The
movie was obviously made so
that Resnais could swathe Anny
Duperey in glistening art deco
gowns (exquisite as she is, she's
like a tigress manikin) and have
Sacha Vierny complement the
magnificent sets with a sun
drenched, distanced photo
graphic style. A deliberately
gauzy-lifeless film, with a mel
ancholy score by Stephen Son
dhelm that is often quite beau
tiful. (You'll retain it far longer
than any of the elegant images.)
Charles Boyer, Francois Perier,
Michel lonsdale, Claude Rich
and Gerard Depardieu are fea
tured.
Plays Wednesday evening
with Garde a Vue.
