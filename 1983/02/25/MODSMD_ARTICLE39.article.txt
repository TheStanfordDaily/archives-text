# Lawyer-activists call for revolt of oppressed minorities
## 
### JASON COLE Staff writer 
A war between the politically op
pressed people ot this country and
the government is being waged and
the only salvation may be revolution,
claimed a group of attorney-activists
at a Law School forum entitled "Polit
ical Prisoners in the U.S." held be
fore more than 100 people at kresge
Auditorium last night.
The panelists included Chokwe
Lumumba, Stuart Hanlon, Bruce Elli
son and Francisco "Kiko" Martinez,
who, according to forum sponsors,
are among America's most experi
enced and progressive criminal de
fense attorneys. The discussion cen
tered around the experiences of the
panelists and the implications of
their cases on the fight for political
freedom.
Hanlon, who represents former
Black Panther leader Geronimo Pratt
and Ellison, who is the lead attorney
for former American Indian Move
ment leader Leonard Peltier, dis
cussed the effectiveness of the Free
dom of Information Act (FOIA) dur
ing most of their speeches.
Hanlon, in a press conference ear
lier in the day, said that despite get
ting key information regarding the
Pratt case through the FOIA, as time
goes on, FOIA will become increas
ingly less effective. The FBI is able to
black out information and keep or
destroy whatever they want. "We've
had two congressional leaders and
the courts go after them and they still
don't give us any information."
Hanlon said the final answer to FBI
"interference and counter
intelligence" may be revolt. "We can
no longer stop them (FBI) through
traditional, court systems," he said.
Ellison said, "Because people are

now starting to use the information
obtained by the Act to criticize the
government, the government is now
starting to protect themselves.
They're increasing the number of re
strictions and exemptions to the
point that it (FOIA) won't exist.'' He
added, "The government says that
there's a lot more information re
garding the Peltier case, that they
can't release for national security
reasons. The national security ex
cuse doesn't make sense, and I'd like
to see that information."
Ellison claimed that Peltier had be
come a victim of FBI wrath. Peltier
and two others were accused of kil
ling two FBI agents in 1975. When the
other two suspects were acquitted by
an lowa judge, Peltier's trial was
moved to North Dakota and a new
judge was assigned. "The FBI was

looking for a scape-goat," said Elli
son.
Lumumba, a leading black attor
ney and Minister of lustice for the
Republic of New Africans, said, "We
are fighting a war. You may hear
about it in different terms such as
police action,' but when armed
militia and tanks are brought in
against a few women and children we
are talking about war," he said.
Martinez, who claims to have been
the object of government persecu
tion and prosecution for more than
10 years (most of the state and federal
charges against Martinez were drop
ped due to prosecutorial and judicial
misbehavior), was especially critical
of the media. "Media plays the hand
maiden to the government," he said.
The media work to neutralize and
destroy movements by printing only
selective information, he added.
