Meanwnne, Lave e, p b | ic works sub

committee that her firing , ,
"phenomenal" to her and insisted she had done

nothing wrong.
"I hope today we can put all the charges on the
table — let's discuss when, where, and what," she
said.
Lavelle, who attacked Burford in testimony
Wednesday as an ineffective manager, said yesterday
she'd become isolated from the EPA administrator
amid continual wrangling within the agency for
power.
Larry Speakes, chief deputy White House press sec
retary, announced the shifts at the EPA and said the
choices were "the best people we can find consistent
with our need to move quickly."
At the same time, he said he had heard no sugges-
tions that the president intended to stem the con
troversy surrounding the agency by removing
Burford. But he said other shifts might be made by the
new officials.
Reagan chose Lee Thomas, an associate director of
the Federal Emergency Management Agency, to suc
ceed Lavelle. He will be given the title of acting assis
tant administrator for solid waste and emergency re
sponse. Thomas has been praised for his work leading
a federal task force dealing with the dioxin con
tamination problems at Times Beach, Mo.
Jobs bill approval likely
Washington — A $4.5 billion recession relief bill,
sponsored by Democrats and containing more mon
ey for the poor and elderly than proposed by Presi
dent Reagan, is heading for almost certain House ap
proval.
Democratic leaders of the House Appropriations
Committee agreed yesterday on the quick-fix legisla
tion providing jobs and emergency help for victims of
hard economic times.
The committee is expected to formally approve the
proposal today and send it to the House floor by next
Thursday.
"We've tried to get jobs that are necessary and
things we can do," said Rep. Jamie Whitten (D-Miss.),
the committee chairman.
Whitten declined to disclose specifics, but other
sources said House Democrats made a number of sig
nificant changes to a $4.3 billion jobs measure drafted
by senior aides to Reagan earlier this month, and pro
posed to House Speaker Thomas "Tip" O'Neill of
Massachusetts.
Senate rejects Reagan nominee
Washington — The Senate Foreign Relations Com
mittee refused yesterday to approve Kenneth
Adelman as the new head of the Arms Control and
Disarmament Agency, voting instead to send his nom
ination to the Senate floor with a recommendation
that it be rejected.
Committee members voted 9-8 against a motion to
approve Adelman, then agreed by a 14-3 margin to
give the full Senate an opportunity to consider the
nomination.
The move set the stage for a major confrontation
between the Reagan administration and Senate Dem
ocrats over nuclear arms control policy, with a
filibuster against Adelman almost certain.
A spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Howard
Baker (R.Tenn.), said the debate is expected to come
in mid-March and that Republican leaders are confi
dent Adelman can be approved despite the commit
tee's recommendation.
Shortly after the action yesterday, President Reagan
issued a statement saying he is still "fully committed"
to the nomination and that "I share Howard Baker's
assessment that the full Senate will confirm him."
Saudi Arabia urges OPEC price cut
Riyadh, Saudi Arabia — Saudi Arabia and four other
Persian Gulf oil producers are urging their OPEC part
ners to avoid potential chaos in the marketplace by
joining them in a uniform oil price cut.
Saudi Oil Minister Sheik Ahmed Yamani said
Wednesday that the decision to reduce prices was
made by Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates,
Kuwait, Qatar and Iraq.
The amount of the price cut was not disclosed and
would be the likely focus of discussions if all 13 mem
bers of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries agree to a proposed meeting next week.
One OPEC member — Nigeria — broke ranks with
the cartel last weekend by lowering its crude oil price
to match cuts announced by Britain and Norway.

Yamini said the price cut envisioned by the five Per
sian Gulf producers has been endorsed by Indonesia,
another OPEC member, and by the gulf sheikdoms of
Oman and Bahrain, which do not belong to the cartel.
Saxon: UC system a failure
Santa Cruz — The University of California has been
"largely derelict" in preparing students for the world
they must live in, according to David Saxon, outgoing
president of the nine-campus system.
Saxon, who is resigning to become chairman of the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology in July, said the
university's failure of its fundamental responsibilities
is "scandalous."
"I think we are not in any way turning out students
who can tell the difference between sense and non
sense when it comes to something scientific," he said
Wednesday in a speech to the Faculty Senate on the
Santa Cruz campus.
Saxon's comments come just weeks after the Con
ference Board of Associated Research Councils rated
the graduate schools at the University of California at
Berkeley among the top in the country for history,
English, math, philosophy and engineering.
"I don't think we are turning out scientists and en
gineers who have an adequate appreciation of the lib
eral arts and humanities, and I don't think we're
teaching students what they need to know about oth
er cultures, other nations, other peoples," he added.
"I think it is scandalous that we've failed — that
we're sending out people whom we call educated
who have these deficiencies," said Saxon, "and I think
it's especially scandalous given the character of the
world."
Lebanon may get more marines
Washington — Withdrawal of Israeli, Palestinian
and Syrian troops from Lebanon would create a vacu
um that might have to be filled by sending more
Marines to the volatile country as part of a larger mul
tinational peace-keeping force, Defense Secretary
Caspar Weinberger said yesterday.
Although he stressed that "there is no specific
numberand nospecifictime" for expanding the pres
ent 4000-man multinational force, Weinberger's re
marks emphasized the likelihood of a long stay for the
Marines in Lebanon.
The blueprint he sketched yesterday for bringing
peace to Lebanon also contrasted sharply with the
one drawn by his new counterpart in Israel, Moshe
Arens, the Israeli ambassador here who has been
named defense minister.
At a Pentagon news conference, Weinberger said,
"As we get the agreement we hope we will get from
the Israelis and the Syrians and PLO (Palestine Liber
ation Organization) representatives, and the forces
pull back, this opens up a wider and wider range of
territory that needs to be covered.
Stocks hit record high
Stock market records were shattered yesterday as
the Dow Jones industrial average convincingly roared
past the 1100-mark in a broad rally.
Analysts attributed the surge to optimism about an
economic recovery that they hoped would be fueled
by further cuts in interest rates and falling oil prices.
The Dow Jones industrials, extending a 16.54-point
gain from Wednesday, soared 24.87 points to close at
a historic high of 1121.81.
Today's weather
Mostly cloudy with a chance of light rain or show
ers. Highs in the upper 50s to mid-60s. Southerly
winds 10 to 20 mph. Tonight and tomorrow mostly
cloudy with scattered light rain or showers.

troversy surrounding the agency by removing
Burford. But he said other shifts might be made by the
new officials.
Reagan chose Lee Thomas, an associate director of
the Federal Emergency Management Agency, to suc
ceed Lavelle. He will be given the title of acting assis
tant administrator for solid waste and emergency re
sponse. Thomas has been praised for his work leading
a federal task force dealing with the dioxin con
tamination problems at Times Beach, Mo.
Jobs bill approval likely
Washington — A $4.5 billion recession relief bill,
sponsored by Democrats and containing more mon
ey for the poor and elderly than proposed by Presi
dent Reagan, is heading for almost certain House ap
proval.
Democratic leaders of the House Appropriations
Committee agreed yesterday on the quick-fix legisla
tion providing jobs and emergency help for victims of
hard economic times.
The committee is expected to formally approve the
proposal today and send it to the House floor by next
Thursday.
"We've tried to get jobs that are necessary and
things we can do," said Rep. Jamie Whitten (D-Miss.),
the committee chairman.
Whitten declined to disclose specifics, but other
sources said House Democrats made a number of sig
nificant changes to a $4.3 billion jobs measure drafted
by senior aides to Reagan earlier this month, and pro
posed to House Speaker Thomas "Tip" O'Neill of
Massachusetts.
Senate rejects Reagan nominee
Washington — The Senate Foreign Relations Com
mittee refused yesterday to approve Kenneth
Adelman as the new head of the Arms Control and
Disarmament Agency, voting instead to send his nom
ination to the Senate floor with a recommendation
that it be rejected.
Committee members voted 9-8 against a motion to
approve Adelman, then agreed by a 14-3 margin to
give the full Senate an opportunity to consider the
nomination.
The move set the stage for a major confrontation
between the Reagan administration and Senate Dem
ocrats over nuclear arms control policy, with a
filibuster against Adelman almost certain.
A spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Howard
Baker (R.Tenn.), said the debate is expected to come
in mid-March and that Republican leaders are confi
dent Adelman can be approved despite the commit
tee's recommendation.
Shortly after the action yesterday, President Reagan
issued a statement saying he is still "fully committed"
to the nomination and that "I share Howard Baker's
assessment that the full Senate will confirm him."
Saudi Arabia urges OPEC price cut
Riyadh, Saudi Arabia — Saudi Arabia and four other
Persian Gulf oil producers are urging their OPEC part
ners to avoid potential chaos in the marketplace by
joining them in a uniform oil price cut.
Saudi Oil Minister Sheik Ahmed Yamani said
Wednesday that the decision to reduce prices was
made by Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates,
Kuwait, Qatar and Iraq.
The amount of the price cut was not disclosed and
would be the likely focus of discussions if all 13 mem
bers of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries agree to a proposed meeting next week.
One OPEC member — Nigeria — broke ranks with
the cartel last weekend by lowering its crude oil price
to match cuts announced by Britain and Norway.

Yamini said the price cut envisioned by the five Per
sian Gulf producers has been endorsed by Indonesia,
another OPEC member, and by the gulf sheikdoms of
Oman and Bahrain, which do not belong to the cartel.
Saxon: UC system a failure
Santa Cruz — The University of California has been
"largely derelict" in preparing students for the world
they must live in, according to David Saxon, outgoing
president of the nine-campus system.
Saxon, who is resigning to become chairman of the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology in July, said the
university's failure of its fundamental responsibilities
is "scandalous."
"I think we are not in any way turning out students
who can tell the difference between sense and non
sense when it comes to something scientific," he said
Wednesday in a speech to the Faculty Senate on the
Santa Cruz campus.
Saxon's comments come just weeks after the Con
ference Board of Associated Research Councils rated
the graduate schools at the University of California at
Berkeley among the top in the country for history,
English, math, philosophy and engineering.
"I don't think we are turning out scientists and en
gineers who have an adequate appreciation of the lib
eral arts and humanities, and I don't think we're
teaching students what they need to know about oth
er cultures, other nations, other peoples," he added.
"I think it is scandalous that we've failed — that
we're sending out people whom we call educated
who have these deficiencies," said Saxon, "and I think
it's especially scandalous given the character of the
world."
Lebanon may get more marines
Washington — Withdrawal of Israeli, Palestinian
and Syrian troops from Lebanon would create a vacu
um that might have to be filled by sending more
Marines to the volatile country as part of a larger mul
tinational peace-keeping force, Defense Secretary
Caspar Weinberger said yesterday.
Although he stressed that "there is no specific
numberand nospecifictime" for expanding the pres
ent 4000-man multinational force, Weinberger's re
marks emphasized the likelihood of a long stay for the
Marines in Lebanon.
The blueprint he sketched yesterday for bringing
peace to Lebanon also contrasted sharply with the
one drawn by his new counterpart in Israel, Moshe
Arens, the Israeli ambassador here who has been
named defense minister.
At a Pentagon news conference, Weinberger said,
"As we get the agreement we hope we will get from
the Israelis and the Syrians and PLO (Palestine Liber
ation Organization) representatives, and the forces
pull back, this opens up a wider and wider range of
territory that needs to be covered.
Stocks hit record high
Stock market records were shattered yesterday as
the Dow Jones industrial average convincingly roared
past the 1100-mark in a broad rally.
Analysts attributed the surge to optimism about an
economic recovery that they hoped would be fueled
by further cuts in interest rates and falling oil prices.
The Dow Jones industrials, extending a 16.54-point
gain from Wednesday, soared 24.87 points to close at
a historic high of 1121.81.
