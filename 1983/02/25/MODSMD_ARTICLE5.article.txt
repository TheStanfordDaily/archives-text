# Staff survey reveals some dissatisfaction
## 
### KIMBERLY BROWN Senior staff writer 
While University staff employees
are generally pleased with the work
ing environment here, they are dis
satisfied with the job classification
system and one-third believe they
are incorrectly classified, according
to a recently released University sur
vey of 1300 staff members.
The survey revealed that staff hold
a "slightly negative" view of the job
classification system. The University
task force that conducted the survey
recommended streamlining the sys
tem by decreasing the number of
classifications, thus making it sim
pler to administer.
The survey also found that women
are in general less satisfied with their
jobs than men. Director of Personnel
Rob Parker, co-chair of the task
force, said women may "feel they're
simply in the wrong classification,"
and are frustrated with the "process
of reclassification."
Women also have little patience
with the classification system be
cause "women in this situation are
generally in lower-paying jobs," he
said.
The women surveyed tended to be
younger than the men and to have
worked at the University a shorter
time. Men, who held a larger per
centage of higher-paying jobs,
earned significantly larger salaries
than women.
The survey also showed that
minorities, who are likely to be
young and female, tend to be "signif
icantly less satisfied" with their
salaries than are non-minorities, less
likely to think their increases are de
termined fairly and less likely to think
they are paid the same as others at
the University with similar respon
sibilities and experience.
Both men and women were "more
satisfied than dissatisfied" with their
jobs, with men being "slightly more
satisfied" than women.
The task force of senior adminis
trators and faculty, which was
formed in August 1981, met 31 times,
and in addition to the opinion sur
vey, solicited opinions from indi

viduals and groups before writing its
report.
There was an 82 percent return
rate on the surveys, Parker said,
which led the task force to conclude
that the staff was generally interested
in the issues and concerned about
Ihe University as an employer.
In response to whether or not the
task force was surprised byany ofthe
findings, Parker said the quantitative
study was more "helpful" than any
thing else. "The survey helped us

calibrate feelings we already had,"
he said.
"We expected people would be
generally positive, but were sur
prised at just how positive they
were," he said. "However, that
doesn't mean there weren't prob
lems identified."
Isolating specific causes for the
problems is difficult, Parker said, be
cause there are "so many variables."
But the survey was valuable in that
it enabled the task force to com
municate with more staff and to "get
closer to the root of the problem,"
he said.
Currently, the Personnel Depart
ment and vice-presidential senior
staff members are in the process of
assessing ways to implement the task
force's recommendations, in addi
tion to the likely impact of the rec
ommendations.
The assessment should take about
three months.
"We would hope that concrete ac
tion will be taken directly thereaf
ter," Parker said.
