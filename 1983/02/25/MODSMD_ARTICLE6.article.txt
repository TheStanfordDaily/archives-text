# New loan requires no need
## 
### ALAN TRIPP Senior staff writer 
| The California Student Loan Au-
I thority has approved a new loan pro
gram which will provide loans of up
to $3000 at 12 percent interest to
California students without requir
ing proof of financial need.
Parents of dependent under
graduates, graduate students and in
dependent undergraduates are elig
ible to apply for California Loans to
Assist Students (CLAS), a program
funded by a $121 million state bond
issue.
"The CLAS program was initiated
to help those people who were elim
inated by the new CSL (Guaranteed
Student Loan) needs test," said Sue
Wood, assistant director of financial
aid. "These people had no outlet.
Now they can borrow as much as
$3000."
According to Timothy Warner, as
sociate provost of the University Of
fice of Management and Budget,
"The purpose of the program is to
give middle- and upper-income
families an opportunity to borrow
money and send their kids to col
lege. It's a good program for private
school students, given the cost of at
tending a place like Stanford."
In most cases the CLAS loans will
be due in 10 years after they are is
sued, Warner said.
Student borrowers will pay only
the interest on the loan until they
graduate, while parents will be re
quired to begin payments on both
the interest and principal right away.
Although Warner conceded that
"a millionaire could go out and get
one of these loans," he added that he
did not expect such borrowing to
have much of an effect on the pro
gram.
Students most likely to participate
in the CLAS program are those who
are currently borrowing money from
the University through the Parent
Loan Program (PIP) at 12.25 percent.
Carol Blanchett, an administrative
assistant who works with the PIP,
said the University would "actively
encourage" parents currently bor
rowing through the PIP to divert at
least part of their loan to the CLAS
program at the 12 percent rate.
Unlike the GSL program, where
interest rates on payments are par
tially subsidized by the state and fed
eral government, the CLAS program
will be covered entirely by the bond
issue, Warner said.
Parents will be required to go
through a regular credit check with
their bank, Warner said. "If the bank
makes the loan, it then sells the note
to the (California) Student Loan Au
thority. It's an automatic process.
The bank is just acting as an agent.
They receive a $10 fee for every loan
plus they make the float."
