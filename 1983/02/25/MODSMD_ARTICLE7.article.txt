## Physicians call for nuclear freeze 
### JULIE RYAN Staff writer 
Members of Physicians for Social Responsi
bility (PSR) strongly endorsed the nuclear
freeze proposal currently before the House
Foreign Relations Committee at a press con
ference held yesterday in Menlo Park.
The proposal, which will be voted on March
2, calls for a Jsilateral, mutually verifiable
freeze by the United States and Russia on the
production, deployment and testing of nu
clear weapons. If passed it will go before
Congress sometime next month.
According to Perrin French, assistant pro
fessor of psychiatry and founding member of
the peninsula chapter of PSR, the members of
the group see the freeze movement as a "very
promising development."
"It is terribly critical what the Congress and
Senate do," French said. "I don't think we can
look to the executive branch to make the right
decisions in this area at this time."
French said he thinks the freeze proposal
could pass if enough events like yesterday's

press conference are held around the coun
try. The PSR will also be lobbying local con
gressmen in support of the freeze. Two local
representatives, Ed Zschau (R-Sunnyvale) and
Tom Lantos (D-San Mateo) are especially im
portant because they are members of the
Foreign Relations Committee. Both sup
ported the state nuclear freeze initiative
(Proposition 12) and are expected to vote for
the proposed freeze.
"The splitting of the atom is such an ad
vance in science that we have to develop new
ways of thinking about it," said former Ad
miral ).S. Quilter, who was on an air force
carrier off the coast of lapan when the nuclear
bombs were exploded in World War 11.
"However the administration is not heading
in that direction. They are going under the old
rules of thought and not considering new
ideas."
The nuclear freeze issue has to be demon
strated first to Congress, then the administra
tion, he said. "The administration has not
recognized that the public is concerned, wor

ried, and wants something done about nu
clear escalation."
Robert lones, a NASA engineer who helped
develop the Cruise missile, said, ' political
people are no longer able to cope with ad
vances in society. In political thinking you rely
on history. However, in science we reject his
tory; hence we pull far ahead of political
thinking." He said we have reached the stage
where a single submarine could blow up a
whole country yet "political people still talk
about nuclear bombs as it they were normal
weapons."
Homer Boushey, a former air force general
and one of the authors of Proposition 12, said,
"Let's put a cap on this thing and not go over
board either way." He said the bilateral nu
clear freeze position is more reasonable than
either the unilateral position or "the win at
any cost" stand. "For 20 years deterrence has
worked," he said, "because the nuclear threat
is keeping countries hostage." Today, he ex
plained, it is time to reduce our vast arsenal of
nuclear arms.
