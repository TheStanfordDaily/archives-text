## Future plans for 'Dish' uncertain 
### EDIE BOGART 
Every day at 5 p.m. they come down
from the hills — not runners on the dow
nhill slope of a cross-country jaunt, but
rodioscientists.
They are coming from the radio
•elescope affectionately known as the
Dish and a cluster of "antennae farms"
used for magnetic and atmospheric
studies.
The Golden Age of radioscience — the
'60s era when the space program placed
high demand upon radar technology —
could be said to have past or moved to
other places such as the Antarctic. Yet
quite a bit of research is still done "in the
hills."
The Dish is still used, though not for
such significant research as the previous
space exploration. Radio amateurs use the
Dish, and SRI used it recently to get a satel
lite working again. The Dish has great
strength; it is capable of very high
frequency communication, and its signal
reactivated the malfunctioning satellite.
Also, both Voyager spacecrafts have a
transmitter, and scientists thought it was
possible to command the spacecraft by
giving orders from a transmitter. At one
time, this was actually done.
The Dish is still used by amateur scien
tists and its future is uncertain and of "no
great concern" to the University, accord
ing to Electrical Engineering Prof. Von Esh
lemen. It is a "low cost structure."
It might be moved to the North Pole,
where SRI is doing localized experiments.
There are several radar dishes, similar to
the one here, that are currently being
used. Cornell University operates a dish in
Puerto Rico, with a diameter of 1000 feet.
But it is not steerable like Stanford's dish.
NASA built radar dishes with 200-foot di
ameters in Spain and Australia for tracking
spacecrafts. There is also a center for
space communication and research in
New Mexico.
Stanford and SRI-lnternational (for
merly Stanford Research Institute) built
the Dish is 1966. It is 150 feet in diameter
and cost approximately $4.5 million to
build. The Dish was funded by the Air
Force for the study of the upper atmos
phere. Stanford scientists sent radio waves
into the atmosphere that were reflected in
the changes in the atmosphere's density.
They could then work to determine the
chemical composition of the earth's at
mosphere. Later in the '60s and early '70s
the Stanford Dish was used for communi
cation with spacecrafts.
The Dish is special because it operates
on "bistatic" radio communication. The
receiver is separate from the transmitter
and it receives very high-frequency signals
from the "orbiting command module"
which sends signals that are transmitted
through the atmosphere to the radar dish.
Its,size is also bigger than most of its kind.

The early missions, Pioneer 6, 7, 8,9 and
Mariner 5 to Venus, carried electronic in
struments made at Stanford. The radio
signals were transmitted by the Dish and
received on board the spacecraft. The
"solar wind," or the ionized gas between
planets, affects the radio wave, so it can
measure the changes in density and com
position of the gas.
The radio waves transmitted by the Dish
also went near the sun and measured the
solar plasma, or ionized gas, which is like
"an extension of the top of the sun," ac
cording to Eshleman. The atmosphere of
Venus, also measured by these radio
waves, has a pressure one hundred times
that of the earth. Its temperature is 750
degrees Kelvin, which melts metals, and it
is composed entirely of carbon dioxide.

The Dish might be moved to
the North Pole for SRI
International experiments.

The spacecraft traveling between Saturn
and Uranus, launched in 1977, also carries
an electronic transmitter made by Stan
ford that received signals from the Dish.
The field of radioscience has changed
greatly in the last decade,and this has had
an effect on funding from national agen
cies such as NASA, National Science
Foundation and the Office of Naval Re
search. Although the University is one of
the leaders of space-radio exploration, it
receives less funding than in the past.
Projects are increasingly more expensive
and large-scale, and fewer of them can be
supported by the national funding agen
cies. Instead of individuals doing their
projects on their own equipment,
everyone had to go to a machine. The
equipment is therefore more centralized.
The funding agencies' philosophy now
is "do more with less (money)," Fshleman
said. There is still a sizable amount of indi
vidual research, however, and Stanford
feels that "if someone had a particular use
tor it (the Dish), we would sell it,"he said.
Until then, it remains a Peninsula land
mark.
Another reason the Dish is largely inac
tive is because the already-existing radio
equipment and radiolengths can be mod
ified. Radar communication is outdated
and instead smaller, more portable
transmitter-receivers are used more by
scientists in general research as well as
space exploration.
Robert Helliwell, another prominent
professor in electrical engineering and a
"pioneer in radioscience," regularly leads
a group of researchers who use the
equipment in the hills behind Stanford to
listen to the "great flora and fauna of the
electromagnetic field."

Helliwell uses radio signals to detect
ionized gases in the outer atmosphere.
The signals called "whistlers" are low
frequency signals generated near the
earth's surface by lightning flashes. They
radiate out along the "earth's curving
magnetic field lines," travel long distances
and return to earth. These "whistlers '
carry an imprint ot the ionization they pass
through, so they are vulnerable records of
the gaseous composition of the atmos
phere.
This information can help answer en
vironmental questions, such as the effects
of carbon dioxide on health and climate,
and perhaps predict and "mitigate the ef
fects of the upper atmosphere on satellites
and radio communications," Helliwell
said.
"An understanding of the Earth's at
mosphere is crucial as we. . .develop
communications systems that are sensitive
to changes in the atmosphere. Pollutants,
such as carbon dioxide, may cause funda
mental changes in the atmospheric prop
erties that may significantly affect future
weather," Helliwell wrote in a recent jour
nal article.
Other efforts are also pursued in the
area around the Dish. Magnetic studies,
for example, are conducted and graduate
students experiment with the re-creation of
conditions on other planets.
Some students simulated the atmos
phere of Venus in a cavity by putting
"some things" in a box and allowing them
to react. A gaseous sulfuric acid atmos
phere was created, much like what was
detected by radio signals in Venus' atmos
phere. The absorption of the sulfuric ac id
was measured by a radio transmitter but
scientists here did not know what caused
it.
This study of Venus has particular rele
vance, according to Eshleman, because of
the growing amount of carbon dioxide in
the earth's atmosphere. Since people in
our industrial society burn hydrocarbons
for energy, the carbon dioxide level will
grow inexorably. This affects temperature,
because the sun comes through the at
mosphere, and the heat can not get out.
The air gets warmer; this is called the at
mospheric "greenhouse effect."
Looking back on the advances made in
radioscience, which the Dish symbolizes,
Eshleman described the remarkable
achievements of the study of radio signals
in the last 25 years. "We realized how iso
lated earth is, and how important careful
cooperation is for continued survival," he
said. Communications had advanced with
the kind of high-frequency, two-way sig
nalling accomplished by the Stanford
Dish. The signalling may, according to Esh
leman, hold the key to study of our
neighboring planets' atmospheres, with a
potential understanding oY our own prob
lems.
