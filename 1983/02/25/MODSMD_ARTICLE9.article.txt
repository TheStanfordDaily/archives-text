As an exampie of the wonderful variety of
questions I receive, I'll open with the follow
ing:
lust a question of semantics in regard to the
vandalizing of the mural in the Zapata dining
hall. When th.ise "pranksters" did that inex
cusable thing to a piece of art, it has constant
ly been referred to as "defacing" the mural.
Now, what they did was to add some crude
facial features to a faceless portrait. Wouldn't
it rather be the other way around: if they had
painted over the facial features of a portrait so
that it became faceless, then that certainly
would be to "deface" it.
I do know that the word "deface" also
means to destroy or to vandalize, but in this
particular case wouldn't another word than
"deface" be more proper?
Per-Olow Leijon
Visiting Professor of Art
I suppose we could have said "did that in
excusable thing," but that would have been
awfully unwieldy.
Webster's says to deface is "to destroy or
mar the face or external appearance of: DIS
FIGURE: injure, spoil, or mar by effacing im
portant features or portions of." That doesn't
help much: the only manner of defacement
given is "effacing," which is exactly what we
don't want. The OED takes care of the prob
lem by giving two current definitions of de
face (adopted from the obsoiete French de
facer), one which simply implies any sort of
disfigurement and another which specifies
"to blot out, obliterate." (If anyone's in
terested, the first recorded use of deface with
its current meaning is in Chaucer's Troilus:
"And clepe A-yen the beute of your face,
That ye with salte Teers so deface.") There is a
precedent for the disputed use of deface: in a
letter she wrote in 1716, Lady Mary Wortley
Montagu said, "There are some few heads of
ancient statues; but several of them are de
faced by modern additions" (my italics).
I next checked a thesaurus. They listed
three synonyms for deface: disfashion, dis
feature, disfigure. All ugly words, and none
with quite the connotation we're looking for.
Tell you what. I'll settle for "vandalize" if
you will.
A group of students at the Law School have
been having a ridiculous and trivial debate
over a meaningful matter. However, bein £
future lawyers, we all refuse to concede tc
anyone else in this matter, hence we have
been unable to resolve this issue. The topic o
our concern entails the apparent random col•
or scheme which decorates the seats o
Kresge Auditorium. One person claims tha

of a certain color, hence had to k.eef.
switching shades. Another school of though
suggests the colors make a magnificent pat

tern whose meaning is only revealed from
high up in the air looking down on the seats.
One other idea figures that the interior deco
rator was color blind. Please help resolve this
crucial argument.

And people wonder why the legal system is
so screwed up.
No one at the Law School seemed too
eager to answer this question (can you blame
them?), but finally I was referred to Erika
Kaltenbach, manager of office services for
the School, who was most helpful.
"It's no mystery," she said, and indeed it
isn't. The second guess above was about right
— according to Kaltenbach, the color scheme
was "an esthetic choice of the decorator... a
color pattern he wanted to establish across
the seats." I assume he meant the pattern to
be visible from points fairly close to earth.
With admirable journalistic zeal, I inquired
after the name of the decorator, but he has
since left the Bay Area and Kaltenbach could
only remember his first name, anyway.
How can I get a hold of a golf cart? Who is in
charge of the carts 112 Do I have to be injured to
use one?

If I had $627 for every time this question has
been answered in the Daily, I could pay next
year's tuition. Good thing I'm graduating.
The golf carts are rented out by Golf Car
West in San lose. They're rented by the day,
week, or month; a cart will cost you $87 for
one day, $102 for a week, or $147 for a whole
month. These prices all include a refundable
$30 deposit, and delivery to campus. I was
told that several carts rented to students have
been stolen, in which case they're paid for by
the University More on that shortly.
Theoretically, any student could call up
and rent a cart. However, Golf Car West has
an arrangement with the University, under
the terms of which they will only rent carts to
students who arrange for cart insurance
through the University. And according to
Madelyn Smith at Cowell, who handles the
insurance arrangements, you won't be ap
proved unless you have a legitimate need for
a cart, i.e., you can't get around campus
without it.
Some people will remember when carts
were kept behind Roble. Smith said those
carts, which were University-owned, went
the way of the University-owned Marguerite
buses about three years ago. She said the carts
were damaged so badly by the students who
used them that repair costs exceeded rental
charges, and spare parts weren't available.

Theoretically, any student could call up
and rent a cart. However, Golf Car West has
an arrangement with the University, under
the terms of which they will only rent carts to
students who arrange for cart insurance
through the University. And according to
Madelyn Smith at Cowell, who handles the
insurance arrangements, you won't be ap
proved unless you have a legitimate need for
a cart, i.e., you can't get around campus
without it.
Some people will remember when carts
were kept behind Roble. Smith said those
carts, which were University-owned, went
the way of the University-owned Marguerite
buses about three years ago. She said the carts
were damaged so badly by the students who
used them that repair costs exceeded rental
charges, and spare parts weren't available.

As an exampie of the wonderful variety of
questions I receive, I'll open with the follow
ing:
lust a question of semantics in regard to the
vandalizing of the mural in the Zapata dining
hall. When th.ise "pranksters" did that inex
cusable thing to a piece of art, it has constant
ly been referred to as "defacing" the mural.
Now, what they did was to add some crude
facial features to a faceless portrait. Wouldn't
it rather be the other way around: if they had
painted over the facial features of a portrait so
that it became faceless, then that certainly
would be to "deface" it.
I do know that the word "deface" also
means to destroy or to vandalize, but in this
particular case wouldn't another word than
"deface" be more proper?
Per-Olow Leijon
Visiting Professor of Art
I suppose we could have said "did that in
excusable thing," but that would have been
awfully unwieldy.
Webster's says to deface is "to destroy or
mar the face or external appearance of: DIS
FIGURE: injure, spoil, or mar by effacing im
portant features or portions of." That doesn't
help much: the only manner of defacement
given is "effacing," which is exactly what we
don't want. The OED takes care of the prob
lem by giving two current definitions of de
face (adopted from the obsoiete French de
facer), one which simply implies any sort of
disfigurement and another which specifies
"to blot out, obliterate." (If anyone's in
terested, the first recorded use of deface with
its current meaning is in Chaucer's Troilus:
"And clepe A-yen the beute of your face,
That ye with salte Teers so deface.") There is a
precedent for the disputed use of deface: in a
letter she wrote in 1716, Lady Mary Wortley
Montagu said, "There are some few heads of
ancient statues; but several of them are de
faced by modern additions" (my italics).
I next checked a thesaurus. They listed
three synonyms for deface: disfashion, dis
feature, disfigure. All ugly words, and none
with quite the connotation we're looking for.
Tell you what. I'll settle for "vandalize" if
you will.
A group of students at the Law School have

No one at the Law School seemed too
eager to answer this question (can you blame
them?), but finally I was referred to Erika
Kaltenbach, manager of office services for
the School, who was most helpful.
"It's no mystery," she said, and indeed it
isn't. The second guess above was about right
— according to Kaltenbach, the color scheme
was "an esthetic choice of the decorator... a
color pattern he wanted to establish across
the seats." I assume he meant the pattern to
be visible from points fairly close to earth.
With admirable journalistic zeal, I inquired
after the name of the decorator, but he has
since left the Bay Area and Kaltenbach could
only remember his first name, anyway.
How can I get a hold of a golf cart? Who is in

The golf carts are rented out by Golf Car
West in San lose. They're rented by the day,
week, or month; a cart will cost you $87 for
one day, $102 for a week, or $147 for a whole
month. These prices all include a refundable
$30 deposit, and delivery to campus. I was
