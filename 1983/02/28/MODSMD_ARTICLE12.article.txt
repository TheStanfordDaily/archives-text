## The
						Stanford Daily Explain Mosher expulsion 
### 
While it is clearly impossible for us to pass
judgment on the expulsion of anthropology
graduate student Steven Mosher last Thursday,
a few questions have been raised which we
would like to see answered.
Mosher claims that the University — more
specifically the Anthropology Department —
bowed to pressure from the People's Republic
of China (PRC) by deciding to expel him. In
deed, some see Mosher as a scapegoat who
provided the PRC with an excuse to clamp down
on social science researchers in the country.
Many respected anthropologists, however,
say that Mosher's research techniques and con
duct while in the PRC were unprofessional.
They claim that Mosher's irresponsibility re
sulted in the closing of an enormously impor
tant area of research to Western social science.
Frankly, we don't know whom to believe. We
are disturbed by the University's reluctance to
release information which will allow students,
faculty and the nation to make an informed
judgment.
We realize that it is no simple matter to make
public the process which led to his expulsion,
but at the same time we recognize Mosher's
right to due process. Mosher was denied the
right to confront his accusers since the decision

was made on the basis of written statements of
Chinese officials and Mosher's ex-wife, indi
viduals that Mosher was not al lowed to confront
or question.
If the University is to avoid damaging its repu
tation, it must take steps to defend itself in light
of Mosher's criticism. It was apparently in the
Anthropology Department's interest to expel
Mosher. Doing so, they feel, will serve to pla
cate PRC officials as well as fellow an
thropologists in this country. We hope that
self-interest was not a factor in the decision and
that the expulsion was made for the stated rea
son, "behavior inappropriate for an an
thropologist," rather than because his research
exposed and angered the PRC. Unfortunately,
so little information has been released about
the specific reasons for expulsion that we are
forced to question the decision-making pro
cess.
It may be true that Mosheracted irresponsibly
as a researcher in the PRC and deserved expul
sion. The University community cannot under
stand the expulsion, however, unless additional
information is released. Until that time, the only
thing we can conclude for certain is that the
University could have acted more responsibly in
its handling of the affair.
