## Mystery of Quad authenticity 
### 
Having grown up in the shadow of
a great cathedral, I aspired to be an
architect and create beautiful build
ings. Fate willed instead that I get
into this cutthroat academic busi
ness. I have conserved a keen inter
est in architecture and planning, and
have viewed with dismay the decline
of the Quad. When I came here in
1941 it was almost a sacred place.
Smoking was banned, and the black
doors, not yet taken over by the
poster slobs, shone majestically.
Then the slow decline set in.
For years, in my complaints about
the Quad, I was a voice crying in the
wilderness (an apt word). My joy
about a year ago, when a plan for the
renewal of the Quad was an
nounced, was muted by the search
for "authenticity." In the Daily I is
sued a warning that went unheeded:
the Zocalo, Mexico City's once lovely
main square, was charming because
the splendid architecture was set
around a beautiful garden. Then the
government, misled by a variety of
motives, decreed that the garden
must go, since it was a later addition.
It was replaced by a huge expanse of
concrete, and the charm was totally
destroyed. Will the Quad suffer a
similar fate?
The Quad is a massive Romanes
que structure, representing an early
and rather primitive stage of Euro
pean art. Almost immediately at
tempts began to soften that art. The
huge nave of Winchester cathedral,
the longest in the world, was trans
formed into a glorious Gothic struc
ture. The transepts remained
Romanesque, looking painfully
gauche in comparison. The great
Spanish shrine of Santiago was built
in the same plain Romanesque style.
Then in the 18th century the exterior
was renewed in the Baroque style,
and it is now one of the shining
glories of European architecture. In
some places the search for authentic
ity led to the destruction of Baroque
additions to earlier monuments —a
dismal failure to recognize that ar
chitecture develops organically. The
proponents of authenticity should
demand the removal of the modern
"art" scattered around the campus
building.
The crux of the difficulty is that we
do not know what is authentic in the
case of the Quad, which was strictly
Senator Leland Stanford's project.
He used a variety of words to de
scribe the architecture, and no one
knows quite what he had in mind.
Here are several theories as to what
he envisioned, with the correspond
ing proposal to restore authenticity.
The Piazza San Marco theory. The
Stanfords loved Venice, and the

church was modelled after San
Marco; the mosaics were made by
Salviati of Venice. To create the at
mosphere of the Piazza San Marco
cafes should be set up outside each
department, each one with its own
character. Given the condition of the
southeast corner, it would be a fit
spot forthe Beatniks' Cafe. The roads
around the Outer Quad could be
transformed into canals, with gon
dolas and vaporetti taking students
from one class to another.
The mission theory. Stanford
talked about mission architecture,
thinking doubtless of the Spanish
missions built around a vast atrium or
quadrangle. These large areas were
designed for the catechism and bap
tism en masse of the local Indians.
The Stanford community has be
come a pretty pagan crowd. Mass
cathechism in the Quad would pro
vide appropriate authenticity.
The campo santo theory. Most
Italian cloisters were usedasacampo
santo, or burial ground for those to
be honored. Stanford was a great
man, and it is a prime example of
human ingratitude that the monu
ment to the three Stanfords, popu
larly known as the Holy Trinity,
should have been removed from its
original spot in the center of Memo
rial Court, relegated to ever more
obscure places (it is now in storage)
and vandalized.
I am delighted that it will now be
placed at the west end of the Quad.
Authenticity could be provided by
using the Quad as a campo santo for
our most distinguished faculty. This
would require tombstones, artistic
and well-phrased. Visiting such
tombstones can be fascinating. Here
is one I recall:
"Here sleeps in peace a Hampshire
grenadier
Who caught his death from drink
ing cold small beer.
Soldiers, be wise from his untimely
fall
and if you're hot, drink strong or
not at all.
An honest soldier never is forgot,
Whether he die by musket or by
pot."
Stanford, having revived callig
raphy, could restore the art of writing
epitaphs.
The Alhambra theory. Stanford
repeatedly said the architecture of
the Quad must be Moorish. He and
his family may have been influenced
by that once popular book, Washing
ton Irving's Tales of the Alhambra.
Authenticity would requiie that the
Church be turned into a mosque. Its
mullah would have to decide what to
do with Stanford women.
The Masonic theory. It is not

known if Stanford was a Mason, but
his close friend Timothy Hopkins was
an ardent one. Moorish attire is the
regalia of the Shriners, and their use
of Moorish symbols is a fascinating
subject for which we do not have
space here, but it should be studied
by those interested in authenticity.
The garrison theory. The secular
power of the Spanish missions was
the local garrison. Moreover, Stan
ford was loyal to the North in the
Civil War and proud of its victorious
armies. The Stanfords travelled in
Germany, where they had a chance
to admire the German military. One
German scholar has suggested that
the idea of the Quad came from the
parade ground of a Carnisonstadt
(garrison town). Asphalt or gravel
would reinforce this unlikely theory.
However, now that Oxford students
have reversed their historical refusal
to fight for King and Country, this
might be a good time to revive the
ROTC.
The stockade theory. One
psychohistorian has suggested that
the Quad was unconsciously
suggested by the Western tradition
of the stockade. In times of student
attacks, the Administration could
barricade itself in. The fact that Stan
ford students were named "Indians"
is adduced in support of this. So
much for psychohistory.
This careful consultation of the re
cord and of eminent specialists has
led to confusion. In sum, there seem
to be two theories: the Moorish and
the European. The former would in
dicate the need for fountains and
cascades like those of the Alhambra
and the Generalife, or a basin the
size of a large swimming pool like
that at Marrakesh. The trouble is that
the architecture is not Moorish.
There is a long European tradition of
softening the hard lines of architecture
with lawns planted much later. The
result has invariably been an aes
thetic improvement. Even Ruskin,
who wrote a famous essay saying that
ruins must be left unrestored, fa
vored lawnsaround them to enhance
their beauty. Is it too much to hope
then, that, when the committee
takes a vote on the future of the
Quad, it will pass the grass?
The eternal war against the slobs
continues. Seeing the slow deterio
ration of White Plaza, the Adminis
tration insisted that plans for the
plaza between Memorial Auditorium
and Hoover Tower have a compo
nent for maintenance. The same pre
caution should be taken for the
Quad.

Here are several theories as to what
he envisioned, with the correspond
ing proposal to restore authenticity.
The Piazza San Marco theory. The
Stanfords loved Venice, and the

church was modelled after San
Marco; the mosaics were made by
Salviati of Venice. To create the at
mosphere of the Piazza San Marco
cafes should be set up outside each
department, each one with its own
character. Given the condition of the
southeast corner, it would be a fit
spot forthe Beatniks' Cafe. The roads
around the Outer Quad could be
transformed into canals, with gon
dolas and vaporetti taking students
from one class to another.
The mission theory. Stanford
talked about mission architecture,
thinking doubtless of the Spanish
missions built around a vast atrium or
quadrangle. These large areas were
designed for the catechism and bap
tism en masse of the local Indians.
The Stanford community has be
come a pretty pagan crowd. Mass
cathechism in the Quad would pro
vide appropriate authenticity.
The campo santo theory. Most
Italian cloisters were usedasacampo
santo, or burial ground for those to
be honored. Stanford was a great
man, and it is a prime example of
human ingratitude that the monu
ment to the three Stanfords, popu
larly known as the Holy Trinity,
should have been removed from its
original spot in the center of Memo
rial Court, relegated to ever more
obscure places (it is now in storage)
and vandalized.
I am delighted that it will now be
placed at the west end of the Quad.
Authenticity could be provided by
using the Quad as a campo santo for
our most distinguished faculty. This
would require tombstones, artistic
and well-phrased. Visiting such
tombstones can be fascinating. Here
is one I recall:
"Here sleeps in peace a Hampshire
grenadier
Who caught his death from drink
ing cold small beer.
Soldiers, be wise from his untimely
fall
and if you're hot, drink strong or
not at all.
An honest soldier never is forgot,
Whether he die by musket or by
pot."
Stanford, having revived callig
raphy, could restore the art of writing
epitaphs.
The Alhambra theory. Stanford
repeatedly said the architecture of
the Quad must be Moorish. He and
his family may have been influenced
by that once popular book, Washing
ton Irving's Tales of the Alhambra.
Authenticity would requiie that the
Church be turned into a mosque. Its
mullah would have to decide what to
do with Stanford women.
The Masonic theory. It is not

known if Stanford was a Mason, but
his close friend Timothy Hopkins was
an ardent one. Moorish attire is the
regalia of the Shriners, and their use
of Moorish symbols is a fascinating
subject for which we do not have
space here, but it should be studied
by those interested in authenticity.
The garrison theory. The secular
power of the Spanish missions was
the local garrison. Moreover, Stan
ford was loyal to the North in the
Civil War and proud of its victorious
armies. The Stanfords travelled in
Germany, where they had a chance
to admire the German military. One
German scholar has suggested that
the idea of the Quad came from the
parade ground of a Carnisonstadt
(garrison town). Asphalt or gravel
would reinforce this unlikely theory.
However, now that Oxford students
have reversed their historical refusal
to fight for King and Country, this
might be a good time to revive the
ROTC.
The stockade theory. One
psychohistorian has suggested that
the Quad was unconsciously
suggested by the Western tradition
of the stockade. In times of student
attacks, the Administration could
barricade itself in. The fact that Stan
ford students were named "Indians"
is adduced in support of this. So
much for psychohistory.
This careful consultation of the re
cord and of eminent specialists has
led to confusion. In sum, there seem
to be two theories: the Moorish and
the European. The former would in
dicate the need for fountains and
cascades like those of the Alhambra
and the Generalife, or a basin the
size of a large swimming pool like
that at Marrakesh. The trouble is that
the architecture is not Moorish.
There is a long European tradition of
softening the hard lines of architecture
with lawns planted much later. The
result has invariably been an aes
thetic improvement. Even Ruskin,
who wrote a famous essay saying that
ruins must be left unrestored, fa
vored lawnsaround them to enhance
their beauty. Is it too much to hope
then, that, when the committee
takes a vote on the future of the
Quad, it will pass the grass?
The eternal war against the slobs
continues. Seeing the slow deterio
ration of White Plaza, the Adminis
tration insisted that plans for the
plaza between Memorial Auditorium
and Hoover Tower have a compo
nent for maintenance. The same pre
caution should be taken for the
Quad.

Program.)
Having grown up in the shadow of
a great cathedral, I aspired to be an
architect and create beautiful build
ings. Fate willed instead that I get
into this cutthroat academic busi
ness. I have conserved a keen inter
est in architecture and planning, and
have viewed with dismay the decline
of the Quad. When I came here in
1941 it was almost a sacred place.
Smoking was banned, and the black
doors, not yet taken over by the
poster slobs, shone majestically.
Then the slow decline set in.
For years, in my complaints about
the Quad, I was a voice crying in the
wilderness (an apt word). My joy
about a year ago, when a plan for the
renewal of the Quad was an
nounced, was muted by the search
for "authenticity." In the Daily I is
sued a warning that went unheeded:
the Zocalo, Mexico City's once lovely
main square, was charming because
the splendid architecture was set
around a beautiful garden. Then the
government, misled by a variety of
motives, decreed that the garden
must go, since it was a later addition.
It was replaced by a huge expanse of
concrete, and the charm was totally
destroyed. Will the Quad suffer a
similar fate?
The Quad is a massive Romanes
que structure, representing an early
and rather primitive stage of Euro
pean art. Almost immediately at
tempts began to soften that art. The
huge nave of Winchester cathedral,
the longest in the world, was trans
formed into a glorious Gothic struc
ture. The transepts remained
Romanesque, looking painfully
gauche in comparison. The great
Spanish shrine of Santiago was built
in the same plain Romanesque style.
Then in the 18th century the exterior
was renewed in the Baroque style,
and it is now one of the shining
glories of European architecture. In
some places the search for authentic
ity led to the destruction of Baroque
additions to earlier monuments —a
dismal failure to recognize that ar
chitecture develops organically. The
proponents of authenticity should
demand the removal of the modern
"art" scattered around the campus
building.
The crux of the difficulty is that we
do not know what is authentic in the
case of the Quad, which was strictly
Senator Leland Stanford's project.
He used a variety of words to de
scribe the architecture, and no one
knows quite what he had in mind.
Here are several theories as to what
