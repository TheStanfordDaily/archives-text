Seen those military recruiting ads
on TV? "Aim High: Join the Air
Force" and "Take command at 22."
Well, they're not just on once in awhile
anymore. They're on a lot, and they do
not confine themselves to TV, but per
vade radio and print media as well.
Military recruiting campaigns have
become increasingly dynamic in the
past four years, and the growing
number of enlistments indicates the
willingness of people to respond to
the impelling invitation to don a un
iform.
If we would but stop to consider
what is actually being reflected in
such glib slogans as "Be all that you
can be," we might find ourselves
nore reluctant to join ranks with an

institution which has attained a
frighteningly large share of stock in
our nation's economic and political
foundations.
Though on the surface the ads
promote a conscientious and re
warding career in the military, what
is, in fact, being paraded is a tragi
cally mixed-up value system in our
own country. Healthy, intelligent
young men and women are systemati
cally preparing for their destruction.
We talk about having faith in our
nation as a stronghold for democ
racy, and in order to sustain that
faith, we must have strength. But
what kind of strength? Military? Not
necessarily. To base our faith on
something that is simply secure, like
guns and bombs, ironically reflects

our own weakness.
Faith based upon change, and not
upon established maxims, is the har
dest faith of all to maintain. Yet, time
and time again, history has shown us
this is the way to our own progress.
Innovation and interpretation have
always proven more constructive to
humanity than annihilation.
Of course, the role of the military
in history cannot be denied, nor is
that role apt to be ignored in the fu
ture. However, re-examining our na
tional priorities might lead us to the
hopeful choice of limiting that role in
our own lifetime.
