# In the land of the greedheads

There was once a time when there
was no money. Barter was the ac
cepted method of getting what one
wanted when one only had some
thing else. This worked fine for
awhile. If I had a deer hide and my
neighbor had a fresh piece of meat
and both of us needed what the
other had, we would simply make an
even exchange. When I wanted
14,000 bricks, my neighbor wanted
six gross cuneiform wedges and the
barbarian from across the valley
wanted 27 pointed sticks, however,
things started getting out of hand.
These times were the first to see the
coin of the realm.
At first these were small discs of
silver and gold and other difficult to
obtain metals. This system worked
adequately for a very long stretch of
time. With the advent of money
came the advent of people whose
occupation it was to count and write
down the amount of it that certain
other people (kings, nobles and
priests) had. It was still apparent,
however, that money was a tool, not
an end in itself.
Around the 1500s came a time
when people started ordering
Spanish galleons wholesale, buying
matched sets of jewel-encrusted
chalises and making other obscenely
large purchases that made the coins
available too cumbersome for the
new needs. Soon after came the pro
totypes of the modern savings and
loans banks. The ability to spend and
receive money without actually car
rying heavy bags around played a
significant role in the growth of

commerce.
This new system worked well. It
worked exceptionally well for those
people that had coats of arms and
pieces of paper claiming ownership
of the land other people were farm
ing. It worked so well that in 1776 a
Scotsman sat down and wrote about
why it was working and how it was so
great. If one listens closely today,
one can still hear the name "Adam
Smith" whispered in solemn rever
ence.
With the beginning of the Indus
trial Revolution came opportunities
to make lots of money off the laborof
many people. You paid them what
they needed to survive; you paid
their wives even less; and you paid
their children next to nothing. And
you made mountains of money. It
was similar to the noble-serf agricul
tural system, only better. It is impos
sible to expand a tract of land; it is
very possible to expand a factory.
The way money was now being
used had drastically changed from its
original purpose. Money now re
placed nobility as the mfeans of keep
ing status. Money now became a
wedge driven between those that
had it and those that were trying to
eat once in a while.
This situation, however, could not
last. Workers realized that if they
banded together, they could force
the owners into granting conces
sions. Some of these included
shorter working hours, more equal
pay for women and protection of
children. That pretty much sums up
the economic structure today.

Money is still used as a means of re
taining wealth and of occasionally
placating the work force.
More significant, however, is that
our government today is hiding be
hind "monetary" policy rather than
directly stimulating growth and pro
ductivity. Instead of putting people
to work, we cautiously play around
with the money supply so that wealth
isn't devalued. Instead of money
beinga tool of society, society and its
workings are the means of stabilizing
the money supply.
It is ironic that money, invented to
facilitate trade, has become a ma|(>r
factor in the stifling of trade and
growth. When major corporations
can make a quicker profit by cutting
production and increasing prices
(thus cutting many jobs and stimulat
ing inflation) and multinationals can
"make" money by transferring cur
rency across fluctuating gradients,
then money is indeed being abused.
One wonders when the workers
and assorted service people will
realize that they are the means
of production; that workers, with
adequate organization, could func
tion without capital but never the
other way around. IfTnoney is being
used to maintain the status quo at the
expense of goods, services and jobs,
then the time has come for a major
structural change in the economic
system.
