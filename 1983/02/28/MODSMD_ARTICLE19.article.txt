# Studying in the sun?!

### 

People have not had much of a chance to study in the sun lately. But believe
it or not, this student was able to bask in front of the Quad as recently as a
week ago. It might be a while before the sun comes out again â€” forecasters

predict sporadic rain through the end of this week. Just remember, spring
quarter is less than a month away.
