# Expert says arms control accord likely
## 
### KIMBERLY BROWN Senior staff writer 
William Hyland, a former presidential advisor
and former staff member of the National Security
Council, is generally optimistic about the future
of arms control and believes a viable com
promise could develop between the United
States and the Soviet Union.
"I think after 15 years, despite very loud criti
cisms, arms control is once again back in the
center of East-West politics," Hyland told an au
dience of almost 200 in Terman Auditorium
Saturday. He speculated that if the Reagan ad
ministration moves to a new counter-proposal
and the Soviets follow suit, an agreement could
be reached before the end of the year.
Hyland's address was part of the Great Powers
Seminar on "Security in an Insecure World" — a
program sponsored jointly by the Stanford
Alumni Association and the Stanford Arms Con
trol and Disarmament Program. Hyland served as
a member of the National Security Administra
tion during the Ford administration and is cur
rently an adjunct professor at the Georgetown
School of Foreign Service.
Acknowledging that "the U.S. and the Soviets
are very far apart in their conceptual approach to
where the next realm of arms control should be,"
Hyland said he remains optimistic. The Soviet
Union has "entered into a unique new period"
with Yuri Andropov's administration, he said.
"The challenge the U.S. faces today is not to

allow the present period," with the changes in
Soviet leadership, "to pass by as a lost opportu
nity."
Hyland contrasted U.S.-Soviet relations today
with those during the Eisenhower administra
tion, when relations were "extremely hostile."
"Even though they (relations) are at a low point
today, things have improved greatly over the last
30 years," Hyland said. The present period is
different because we have been in negotiations
with the Soviets for the past 15 years, "whereas,
in the previous relationship it was considered an
accomplishment just to meet," he said.
But according to Hyland, the U.S. record after
15 years is not very encouraging.
"If you look at our original objectives: to re
duce the risk of nuclear war, to reduce the dam
age in the event of nuclear war, to improve polit
ical relations between the two superpowers and
to save money, it seems we've failed in each
one."
But while there is a case to be made against
arms control, Hyland believes there is also a case
to be made for it.
The outcome of SALT I in 1971 was significant
because, Hyland said, "both countries signed an
agreement saying they wouldn't defend them
selves against a major nuclear strike."
But the argument against the SALT II treaty —
which eventually evolved into a substantial
critique of the entire SALT process — is that de
spite these agreements restricting both sides,

the restrictions are more a set of ceilings than
anything els< . "In effect, there was no limit in
sight," Hylart, I -.aid.
Q £o Hyland, under the current U.S.
position in tne Strategic Arms Reduction Talks
(START), the United States would 'only be wil
ling to agree to another treaty that recognized a
downward shift in strategic force."
The proposal defines the basic unit of meas
urement as the warhead, rather than missiles,
and specifies that both sides reduce their
warheads by one-third to a set ceiling, Hyland
said.
The situation in Western Europe is also essen
tial to the START proposal.
The United States has proposed to offset the
Soviet build-up in Western Europe with the de
ployment of Pershing ballistic missiles and cruise
missiles, but would not proceed with the de
ployment if the Soviets would "agree to tear
down every single one of their Intermediate
Range Missiles," Hyland continued.
He said this has caused the current deadlock.
"Whereas the U.S. would like to reduce both
side's warheads to zero, the Soviets have based
their proposal on the old SALT II philosophies,"
Hyland said, and "would ideally like to leave Ibo
or so of their Intermediate Range missiles" in
place.
Attempting to find a proposal taking in the
differences between these two forces is "ex
tremely difficult," Hyland concluded.
