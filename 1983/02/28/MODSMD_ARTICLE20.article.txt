Though the world out there
may not be any more "real"
than the one in here, it's
different.
Two members of the Stan
ford community have made a
vital connection between the
two worlds of theater and
academia. John Lion, doctoral
candidate, and Martin Esslin,
drama professor, have thrown
their academic energies into
the Magic Theater of San Fran
cisco.
The Magic's 16 year history
has established it as one of
America's most successful
theaters. Its commitment,
however, is to unestablished,
often anti-established culture:
avant-garde drama. World
premiers and first run plays
make up 95 percent ofits pro
ductions.
The theater set its standards
at the time of its revolutionary
origin. Berkeley, 1967: four
graduate students in drama
produced Eugene lonesco's
The Lesson in the Steppenwolf
bar. Moved by their success,
by the political and social up
heaval of the times, and by a
desire to present all sides of a
chaotic world, they formed a
company dedicated to free ex
pression. John Lion directed
the first play, and said that this
initial period in the theater's
history was one devoted to
European avant-garde play
wrights. Its success prompted
the group to adopt the name
Magic Theatre from Hermann

Hesse's novel. Steppenwolfe.
The artistic ferment of its
immediate surroundings al
lowed the Magic to become
the "inherently American thea
ter" it is today. Michael
McClure and Sam Shepard,
succesive playwrights-in
residence during this second
period, wrote some of their
finest works in this experimen
tal environment. Shepard's
Pulitzer Prize-winning Buried
Child, premiered at the Magic
in '79. In its present stage, the
theater fulfills its promise,
aside from providing an alter
native forum for established
playwrights, to develop new
playwrights. Part of Esslin's
duties involve searching out
new works at play-reading fes
tivals, suggesting to certain
novelists that they write plays,
and selecting from the
thousands of plays submitted
to the theater the eight to 10
that will be produced in a year.
The Magic has evolved into a
writer's theater.
Financial security, a strong
reputation and a subscriber
ship of two-thirds its capacity
give the theater the liberty to
establish its own policies with
out too much concern for the
critics. Lion said this is essen
tial. "I can't remember a
smooth transition, critically, to
any new direction in the arts
. . . we've made less mistakes
in play choices than the critics
have made in their responses."
