## Jones awesome again as Card checks UW hoop crew 
### STEVE ODELL Senior sports writer 
Guard Keith Jones, wheeling
and dealing through a Wash
ington zone defense like a
riverboat gambler, rolled four
lucky sevens, scoring 28 points
to propel Stanford to a 77-6 <
squashing of the Huskies in a
Pacific-10 Conference basket
ball game Saturday afternoon
at Maples Pavilion.
The Cardinal's 13th win
wasn't pretty as both clubs
combined for 54 personal fouls
and 53 turnovers, but it broke a
four-game losing streak.
It was the second consecu
tive game Jones tied his career
high and the third time he has
finished with 28 points this
year.
Stanford, now 5-9 in the
Pac-10 and 13-11 overall,
bothered the Huskies with a
continuous double-teaming
fullcourt press, especially on
the backcourt inbounds pass,
and forced 25 Washington
turnovers. The Cardinal com
mitted 28 turnovers of its own
to allow UW to stay close.
"We were careless on of

tense, but their aggressive de
fense had a lot to do with it,"
Washington coach Marv Har
shman said. "They do a good
job of putting pressure on the
inbounds pass.
"On the road, you have to
fight for your life."
Thirteen victories is the most
Stanford has had since 1977-78
and a split in its final four
games will assure the Cardinal
of its first winning season in 10
years, lust one win will net
them a .500 season.
"We were stuck on 12 wins
for a very long time,"Stanford
coach Tom Davis said, "But I
must admit that I have not
thought too much about a
winning season. We're still try
ing to keep everything in per
spective, especially because
we're so young. Yet a winning
season would be nice. It has
been a tough roadblock for
Stanford teams."
The Huskies, now 14-14
overall and 5-10 in league play,
were paced by Brad Watson, a
smooth b-toot-6 guard who
gunned in 22 points.
lones got strong support

from the bench, especially
Kent Seymour, who scored a
career-high seven points in |ust
10 minutes. Seymour scored
one of the most important bas
kets of the game, blowing by
Detlef Schrempf from 17 feet
out, driving into the lane, and
scoring a three-point play over
Byron Howell with 8:01 left, ig
niting the crowd of 3076 and
holding off the Huskies, who
were nipping at the Cardinal's
collective heel.
Stanford broke open a tight
game that had been tied 1 I
times with a 12-1 outburst at
the conclusion of the first half.
. Jones ignited the spurt by
dropping a 15-foot baseline
jumper to knot the score at
28-28 with 4:16 left in the open
ing period. Keith Ramee hit
one foul shot and Steve Brown
converted two, and then
Johnny Rogers connected on a
six-footer in the lane off an in
bounds pass from Jones to put
Stanford ahead 33-28 with 3:14
remaining.
Jones took a long pass from
Ramee on the left baseline and


YET ANOTHER TWO: Stanford Keith Jones flies through
three Washington players en route to scoring two of his 28
points Saturday afternoon in the Cardinal's victory over

the Huskies at Maples Pavilion. It was the second game in
a row that Jones tallied his career high figure of 28.

Wichary had this shot blocked by Washing
ton players Reggie Rogers and Darrel Tanner
in Saturday's game at Maples Pavilion.
