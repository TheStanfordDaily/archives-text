## Jones awesome again as Card checks UW hoop crew 
### STEVE ODELL Senior sports writer 
Guard Keith Jones, wheeling
and dealing through a Wash
ington zone defense like a
riverboat gambler, rolled four
lucky sevens, scoring 28 points
to propel Stanford to a 77-6 <
squashing of the Huskies in a
Pacific-10 Conference basket
ball game Saturday afternoon
at Maples Pavilion.
The Cardinal's 13th win
wasn't pretty as both clubs
combined for 54 personal fouls
and 53 turnovers, but it broke a
four-game losing streak.
It was the second consecu
tive game Jones tied his career
high and the third time he has
finished with 28 points this
year.
Stanford, now 5-9 in the
Pac-10 and 13-11 overall,
bothered the Huskies with a
continuous double-teaming
fullcourt press, especially on
the backcourt inbounds pass,
and forced 25 Washington
turnovers. The Cardinal com
mitted 28 turnovers of its own
to allow UW to stay close.
"We were careless on of

tense, but their aggressive de
fense had a lot to do with it,"
Washington coach Marv Har
shman said. "They do a good
job of putting pressure on the
inbounds pass.
"On the road, you have to
fight for your life."
Thirteen victories is the most
Stanford has had since 1977-78
and a split in its final four
games will assure the Cardinal
of its first winning season in 10
years, lust one win will net
them a .500 season.
"We were stuck on 12 wins
for a very long time,"Stanford
coach Tom Davis said, "But I
must admit that I have not
thought too much about a
winning season. We're still try
ing to keep everything in per
spective, especially because
we're so young. Yet a winning
season would be nice. It has
been a tough roadblock for
Stanford teams."
The Huskies, now 14-14
overall and 5-10 in league play,
were paced by Brad Watson, a
smooth b-toot-6 guard who
gunned in 22 points.
lones got strong support

from the bench, especially
Kent Seymour, who scored a
career-high seven points in |ust
10 minutes. Seymour scored
one of the most important bas
kets of the game, blowing by
Detlef Schrempf from 17 feet
out, driving into the lane, and
scoring a three-point play over
Byron Howell with 8:01 left, ig
niting the crowd of 3076 and
holding off the Huskies, who
were nipping at the Cardinal's
collective heel.
Stanford broke open a tight
game that had been tied 1 I
times with a 12-1 outburst at
the conclusion of the first half.
. Jones ignited the spurt by
dropping a 15-foot baseline
jumper to knot the score at
28-28 with 4:16 left in the open
ing period. Keith Ramee hit
one foul shot and Steve Brown
converted two, and then
Johnny Rogers connected on a
six-footer in the lane off an in
bounds pass from Jones to put
Stanford ahead 33-28 with 3:14
remaining.
Jones took a long pass from
Ramee on the left baseline and


YET ANOTHER TWO: Stanford Keith Jones flies through
three Washington players en route to scoring two of his 28
points Saturday afternoon in the Cardinal's victory over

the Huskies at Maples Pavilion. It was the second game in
a row that Jones tallied his career high figure of 28.


FUTILE EFFORT: Stanford forward Hans
Wichary had this shot blocked by Washing
ton players Reggie Rogers and Darrel Tanner
in Saturday's game at Maples Pavilion.

fired home a 12-footer before
UW's Reggie Rogers made the
first of two foul shots. Ramee
made two free throws and then
Steve Brown made one after
Washington coach Marv Harsh
man was called for the first of
two technicals, concluding the
run and giving Stanford a 38-29
advantage at half, a lead it
never relinquished.
As has been a recurring
theme all year long, Stanford
dominated at the foul line,
shredding the nets on 33-of-44
attempts, compared to Wash
ington's nine-of-15 perform
ance at the line. The Huskies
scored five more field goals
than Stanford. "It's hard to be
lieve the one-sideness in
fouls," Harshman griped after
the game.
The Cardinal beat Washing
ton on the boards by a 40-32
margin. Stanford was led by
Hans Wichary, who grabbed
nine rebounds, eight in the
first half when it assumed con
trol of the game.
"I'd like to give a lot of credit
to Hans Wichary," Davis said.
"Even though he travelled a

few times early, he was still
able to carry it off. The keys
were the performance by our
bench, plus the rebounding
Wichary."
Stanford extended its lead
with eight unanswered points
early in the second period,
moving from a seven-point ad
vantage at 42-35 to its biggest
lead, a 15-point edge with
15:08 remaining. Steve Brown
had a hand in the surge, liter
ally, picking up three of his six
steals while working within the
framework of the Stanford
fullcourt press.
Washington responded with
a 14-3 streak as Stanford
momentarily self-destructed
by committing five turnovers,
moving the Huskies back within
comeback range as they trailed
just 59-53 with 9:52 left.
But Stanford connected on
12-of-14 of its final free throw
attempts, led by Jones and
Seymour, who each hit four
for-four in the last five min
utes, and combined with two
Jones field goals, the Cardinal
dispelled any Husky upset as
pirations.
With 45 seconds remaining,
Wichary fouled out and Jones
was taken out, both leading to
a standing ovation. Or maybe

the applause was for Dave
Patzwald, Neil Johnson and
John Williams, three gray'team
players who entered the game.
A good bet is that it was for
both.

The Cardinal beat Washing

nine rebounds, eight in the
first half when it assumed con

"Even though he travelled a

few times early, he was still

Washington responded with
a 14-3 streak as Stanford

moving the Huskies back within
comeback range as they trailed
just 59-53 with 9:52 left.
But Stanford connected on
12-of-14 of its final free throw
attempts, led by Jones and
Seymour, who each hit four
for-four in the last five min
utes, and combined with two
Jones field goals, the Cardinal
dispelled any Husky upset as

With 45 seconds remaining,

the applause was for Dave
