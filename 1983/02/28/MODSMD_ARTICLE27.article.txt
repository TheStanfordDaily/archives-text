# Baseballers take Pac-10 opener

### ROB ZWEIG 
Banging heads with Pacific-10 com
petition for the first time this season,
the Stanford baseball team pounded
UCLA, pitching for 12 hits and 13 runs
Friday afternoon to breeze by the
Bruins 13-5 in the tirst game of a sched
uled three-game set in Los Angeles.
Unfortunately, a weekend rainstorm
postponed the contests planned for
Saturday and Sunday, forcing the red
hot Cardinal, now 12-4-1, to cool its
heels after stretching its winning streak
to nine games by beating the 8-4-1
Bruins.
Stanlord picked up where it had
left off against non-league opponents
by scoring often and early against UCLA
starter Pat Clements (2-2).
Eric Uardgrave opened the top of the
second with a double and came around
to score when third baseman Vince

Sakowski singled. Two walks and a balk
produced another run before shortstop
John Verducci knocked in two more
with an RBI single that gave the Card a
4-0 lead.
Verducci's four RBl's and two singles
and Sakowski's three for four perform
ance at the plate may have helped calm
any fears Stanford manager Mark Mar
quess held about his club's youth
amidst the nation's top baseball con
ference, but he remained rather cau
tious.
"Verducci and Sakowski played well
and we hit well as a team, but we've still
got 29 more (games) to go," he said.
One Cardinal to score on Verducci's
second inning hit was Mike Dotterer,
Stanford's star outfielder of a year ago
who made his first appearance of the
year after undergoing surgery to cor
rect a dislocated shoulder. Dotterer

debuted with a double in four trips to
the plate.
By the middle of the fifth, Stanford
had extended its advantage to 10-1, the
key blow being Hardgrave's three-run
home run in the fourth. The round
tripper was his seventh of the year and
boosted his season RBI total to 26, both
club highs. The senior designated hitter
also totes a .405 batting average.
Meanwhile, the Cardinal hurlers also
showed no respect for their first league
opponents. Steve Cottrellwon his third
game in a row by shutting the Bruins
down over the first three frames on just
two hits. Cottrell (3-1) was nicked tor
only one unearned run before yielding
to David Harris.
Stanford and UCLA will try to make
up two today, weather permitting, be
fore the Cardinal returns to the Bay
Area for a game at San lose State.
