team lost two of three games
over the weekend, but still
finished fourth in the Northern
Lights Invitational Tournament
at the University of Alaska at
Anchorage.
Stanford demolished host
Alaska-Anchorage Friday
night, 74-46, in a first-round
game in the eight-team tour
nament. The Lady Card led
45-27 at the half of the game
that was really never a game.
In second round action, the
Cardinal was crushed by
fourth-ranked Old Dominion
83-49 in another lopsided con
test.
Coach Dotti McCrea and her
troops lost again last night, this
time to Drake, 85-73, in a game
that was much closer than the
score indicates.
Senior Meg Metzger led
Stanford Friday with 20 points,
while Jeanne Ruark-Hoff and
Aneie Paccione chipped in 11

/
and 10, respectively. Both
Metzger and Sarah Evans each
pulled down nine rebounds.
Paccione had a team high six
assists.
Mid-way through the first
half, Ruark-Hoff aggravated
the ankle injury that sidelined
her in the Long Beach State
game.
Ruark-Hoff played against
Old Dominion Saturday, but
was ineffective and scored only
four points in 22 minutes of ac
tion. Sarah Evans led the Card
Saturday with 15 points, as
Metzger, like Ruark-Hoff,
could only muster four tallies.
Stanford held a 41-38 lead at
halftime of the Drake game,
but fell behind in the second
half.
Drake out-rebounded the
Lady Card 38-29 and fouled 10
fewer times than Stanford. The
loss dropped the Cardinal to
18-13 overall, with a tough
WCAA road schedule ahead.
