# Men win, women don't in final home gym meet
## 
### SARAH CARREL 
For the second time in less
than a week, the women's
gymnastics team lost a
heartbreaker to 13th-ranked
University of Arizona by a mar
gin of less than two points.
The Friday night meet, held
in Maples Pavilion, was the
final home meet for the
women. In a contest run at the
same time, the men handily de
feated UCâ€”Davis by a score of
264.9 to 219.05.
At the mid-way point in the
women's meet, the Cardinal
led by .05. Then came the bal
ance beam, a weakness for
Stanford a usually a difficult
event for Arizona as well.
But Arizona turned in a
strong performance while the
Card experienced several bad
breaks and falls. "ASU won on
the beam," said head coach
Homer Sardina. "This was the
first time of the season they've
really hit in that event."
Sardina added that his team
was tired and feeling the ef
fects of a rough end-of-the
season schedule. "We weren't
as sharp tonight as we could
have been."
Turning in an especially out
standing performance for Stan
ford was sophomore Angie
Barnes, who placed third in the
all-around with a 34.9 out of a
possible 40.
For three seniors, co-captain
Julie Bledsoe, Karen Hall and
Kim Strauss, Friday night's
meet was the last opportunity
for them to compete in the
familiar confines of Maples
Pavilion. "It's going to be really
weird to come in here and not
be nervous," Hall said.
Strauss, a native of El Paso,
Texas, said, "This is a really
closeteam and I'll really miss it.
Homer (Sardina) emphasizes
having a good time as well as
high performance and en
thusiasm."
Junior Chris Smith, who
scored a 9.0 or above in every
event except the parallel bars,
where he scored an 8.9, was
the star of the men's competi
tion.
"He (Smith) was really
'smoking' tonight," Hamada
said. "I am pleased to see his
improvement." The all-around
was won by freshman John
Levy with a 54.35 out of a possi
ble 60.
Hamada said the compara
tively low score for the Cardi
nal was due to the loss of
freshman sensation Gary Smith
in all-around competition.
Smith has been suffering from
back problems. Hamada said
that the score, without Smith,
was "about what was ex
pected."
The men travel to Berkeley
next weekend in an attempt to
defeat their rival for the second
time this season.
