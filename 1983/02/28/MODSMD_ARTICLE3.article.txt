# Reagan tells girl denied heart transplant to be optimistic
## 
### LISA LYNCH Staff writer 
Because of her age and size, Sha
ron Stohler will not becomethe Med
ical Center's youngest heart trans
plant patient, but she has not given
up yet. In fact, the 11-year old Ander
son, Indiana, girl received some
rather unusual encouragement last
Friday — a personal letter from Pres
ident Reagan, telling her, "keep up
your spirits.''
David Stohler, Sharon's father,
said, "I've heard of people receiving
form letters before, but this was ac
tually a personal letter from the pres
ident." According to Stohler, some
one mailed a letter to the White

House describing Sharon's case and
Reagan responded personally. "The
letter really cheered her up," Stohler
said.
Reagan wrote, "A friend of yours
has written to tell me what a fine
young lady you are. I am always sad
dened to learn of the misfortune that
touches the lives of one of our young
people, but I know you will keep up
your spirits.
"So many people care about you,
and I am certain from my own expe
rience that the loving concern of fam
ily and friends is a source of great
comfort."
Sharon, who applied for a heart
transplant in early February, received

notification last Thursday that she
was not qualified for the Stanford
transplant program. "We were never
in direct contact with the hospital,"
Stohler said, explaining that they
were notified of the rejection by
Riley Hospital in Indiana, where Sha
ron had undergone a pre
examination to determine if she was
qualified for the transplant.
"They told us that she was basically
too young and too small," Stohler
said. "The Medical Center is used to
patients who are 25, 35 years old."
Stohler was disappointed because he
felt he had been given the impres
sion that Sharon was going to be ac
cepted, but he was not angry about
the hospital's decision. "I respect
their honesty," he said, referring to
the rejection letter they sent to Riley
Hospital.
"I don't want them to operate on
Sharon if they feel she isn't qualified.
I don't want her to be a guinea pig."
The Stohlers are hoping that Texas
Children's Hospital in Houston will
accept Sharon's case. "There are
several other places we're consider
ing, but I can't name any of them
yet," Stohler said. According to Mike
Coodkind, Med Center press

spokesman, the case is no longer in
Stanford's hands.
"It was fairly clear cut — she
applied for a heart transplant and she
was rejected," h£ said, and added,
"presumably, the center that can
best handle her case is the center
whe-e she will be accepted."
In addition to the Reagan letter,
Sharon has received mail from all
over the country, from peers and
from concerned adults. "She's goten
mail from Florida, Georgia, New
York and especially from California,"
Stohler said. "Children her own age
who are seriously ill write her and
offer encouragement." He added
that Sharon tried to write back to

people, but she could not possibly
respond to all of the mail she re
ceived.
Donations continue to come from
the community and from around the
country; a trust fund established for
Sharon had grown to nearly $30,000
by last Thursday.
"We're still getting tremendous
support," Stohler said.
Sharon suffers from car
diomyapathy, a disease which affects
the size of the heart muscles. Doc
tors in Anderson estimated that Sha
ron's heart has swelled to the size of
two grapefruits. Without a transplant
operation, she has less than a year to
live, but Stohler is optimistic that
Sharon will be accepted somewhere.
