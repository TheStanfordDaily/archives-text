# Matmen 4th in Pac-10s

### MARK ZEIGLER 
Stanford's wrestling team
recorded its highest
Pacific-10 finish ever yester
day although it placed
fourth in a five-team "Pac-5"
field.
"It was a very good day for
Stanford wrestling," said
coach Chris Horpel. "It
shows we are making prog
ress as a team and I have
nothing but positive things
to say about us as a whole."
Stanford came away with
seven place (in the top four)
finishers, three more than
last year, its first Pac-10 indi
vidual champion and at least
three NCAA qualifiers.
The Cardinal, with 48.50
points, placed behind
Pac-10 champ and host
Oregon State (88.75),
Arizona State (81.75), Ore
gon (51.00) and ahead of
Washington State (46.50).
But it was how the Card
finished in fourth that tells
the real story of Stanford
wrestling.
Horpel headed to Corval
lis, Ore., for the competi
tion with visions of return
ing with one Pac-10 champ
ion wrestler — the first ever
for Stanford and the first
conference champ since
Horpel won the Pac-8 150-
pound class in 1975.
Horpel got his Pac-10 in
dividual champion, but it
was not the Cardinal he had
predicted to win his weight
class.
The hero was junior
heavyweight Flint Pulskamp
and not senior star Doug
Perkins, who Horpel
thought had the best shot at
winningan individual title in
Corvallis. Perkins finished

second in the 190-pound
weight class for the second
straight year.
And Pulskamp, who had
wrestled in only three
matches during the regular
season, won the
heavyweight division with
more than just his title rid
ing on the match.
Had Pulskamp lost the
championship match to
Washington State's Wen
dell Ellis, Stanford would
have finished in the Pac-5
cellar, where they ended up
last year.
But the darkhorse con
tender Pulskamp prevailed
by pinning Ellis at the 2:31
mark in the first period and

the Cardinal took fourth by
a mere two points over the
Cougars.
Last week, Horpel cor
rectly predicted Oregon
State to win the title, fol
lowed by ASU. He said it
would be a three-way dog
fight for third and it was.
Stanford was in the third
position for much of the
one-day tournament, but
fell behind Oregon and
WSU in the final round.
Perkins, who along with
Pulskamp and freshman
Scott Wiggen qualified for
the NCAAs, lost to his
nemesis — Oregon State's
Jim Baumgardner — who
beat Perkins last year at the

Pac-10s in overtime.
Although Perkins lost 8-6
this time around, he be
came the first Stanford
wrestler to place at the Pac
10s four times.
Other Stanford wrestlers
to place were freshman Bert
Fukunaga (118), freshman
Jeff Bradley (134), junior
Tom Mullen (167) and junior
Jeff Wilson (177).
Wilson is the first
wildcard NCAA qualifier in
the 177-pound weight class,
meaning that he will com
pete in the NCAAs March
10-12 at Oklahoma City
should another 177-
pounder go down.
