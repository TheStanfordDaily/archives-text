Coghlan sets world mark
East Rutherford, N.J. — Ireland's
Eamonn Coghlan, running on a track he
helped design, became the first runner
to break the 3 minute, 50 second barrier
in the indoor mile, with a clocking of
3:49.78 yesterday in the U.S. Olympic
Invitational meet at the Byrne
Meadowlands Arena.
Running confidently and smoothly,
the 30-year-old Coghlan, a former star
at Villanova University, broke the world
indoor best of 3:50.6 he had run at San
Diego in 1981.
"It compares to Roger Bannister
breaking the four-minute barrier (out
doors in 1954) and (John) Walker break
ing 3:50 (also outdoors in 1975)," said
the elated Coghlan. England's Sebastian
Coe now holds the outdoor record of
3:47.33.

Bunge records Slims win
Oakland — Bettina Bunge, attacking
the net despite a strained knee that
almost forced her to default, whipped
Syliva Hanika 6-3, 6-3 yesterday to win
the Virginia Slims of California, her first
women's tennis title this year.
Bunge, a 19-year-old West German
citizen who was born in Switzerland,
grew up in Peru and has been living in
Coral Gables, Fla., for several years,
controlled the one-hour, 20-minute
match from the start with her aggressive
style.
Carter goes USFL
Michigan's Anthony Carter, a three
time Ail-American, signed his name to a
Michigan Panthers' contract Saturday
and will play for an estimated $2 million
over four years in the USFL
But Southern Methodist's Eric
Dickerson said no to $5 million over five
years and will wait for the National
Football League draft.
Carter, a wide receiver, said Herschel
Walker's signing with the New Jersey
Generals had no bearing on his de
cision to join the fledgling league,
which opens its season next Sunday.
