Oil price drop could affect taxes
Washington — President Reagan's chief economic
adviser said yesterday that a sustained decline in oil
nrices while beneficial to the national economy,
would require a top-to-bottom reassessment of the
administration's energy tax policies.
Martin Feldstein, chairman of the president
Council of Economic Advisers, said on Face the Na
tion (CBS) that a decline in the price of crude 0.l to
p« than $25 per barrel "will have a very substantial
ef?e« on .he entire taxation of energy in this coun
'rVEverv dollar-a-barrei drop in oil prices "raises the
(federal) deficit about $1 billion," Feldstein sa.d and,
the decreases continue, "we will have to go back

and re-examine what we want to do about the wind
fall profits tax, about gasoline taxes, about taxation in
general in this energy area.
"I wouldn't rule out any kind of change at this
point."
But Treasury Secretary Donald Regan said he would
oppose any attempt to levy new taxes on oil, either to
increase federal revenues or discipline consumers
and protect gains made in energy conservation when
prices were shooting upward.
The federal gasoline tax is scheduled to rise 5 cents
a gallon April 1, and the Reagan administration has
proposed a "standby" tax of $5 a barrel on imported
and domestic crude oil if needed to reduce budget
deficits beginning in fiscal 1906.
