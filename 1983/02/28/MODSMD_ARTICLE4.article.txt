Oil price drop could affect taxes
Washington — President Reagan's chief economic
adviser said yesterday that a sustained decline in oil
nrices while beneficial to the national economy,
would require a top-to-bottom reassessment of the
administration's energy tax policies.
Martin Feldstein, chairman of the president
Council of Economic Advisers, said on Face the Na
tion (CBS) that a decline in the price of crude 0.l to
p« than $25 per barrel "will have a very substantial
ef?e« on .he entire taxation of energy in this coun
'rVEverv dollar-a-barrei drop in oil prices "raises the
(federal) deficit about $1 billion," Feldstein sa.d and,
the decreases continue, "we will have to go back

and re-examine what we want to do about the wind
fall profits tax, about gasoline taxes, about taxation in
general in this energy area.
"I wouldn't rule out any kind of change at this
point."
But Treasury Secretary Donald Regan said he would
oppose any attempt to levy new taxes on oil, either to
increase federal revenues or discipline consumers
and protect gains made in energy conservation when
prices were shooting upward.
The federal gasoline tax is scheduled to rise 5 cents
a gallon April 1, and the Reagan administration has
proposed a "standby" tax of $5 a barrel on imported
and domestic crude oil if needed to reduce budget
deficits beginning in fiscal 1906.
"I don't think you would want to increase taxes any
more than we are," Regan said on This Week With
David Brinkley (ABC). "Reason: we are just coming
out of a recession. The more you take out of the econ
omy, the less consumers will have for other things. If
you increase the price of energy, the less business will
be able to spend."
Governors to call for defense cuts
Washington — Citing their battered state budgets,
a bipartisan coalition of governors yesterday moved
toward asking President Reagan and Congress to con
sider tax increases and defense cuts to reduce federal
deficits described as "ruinous to our economy."
A draft budget resolution urging this stand had
strong support of among members of the National
Governors' Association, but there were misgivings
expressed by chief executives wary of trying to set
specific goals for the federal budget.
"We've had no sense or word from the White
House at all that they are opposing what we're trying
to do," said Gov. Scott Matheson, a Democrat from
Utah who is chairman of the governors' association.
However, Matheson and Gov. James Thompson of
Illinois, a Republican who will be the next NGA chair
man, acknowledged that the White House was op
posed to the ca'l for trimming Reagan's proposed in
creases in defense spending.
Thompson told a news conference at the opening
of the association's three-day winter meeting that
"our concern is that out-year deficits now forecast by
almost everybody would be ruinous to our economy
and certainly by their prospect, if not actuality, choke
off any chance for recovery."
The governors' proposal set a goal of bringing the
deficit down to no more than $90 billion by 1980.
Matheson said that the Congressional Budget Office
projects a $267 billion deficit for that year.
Sino-Soviet talks to resume
Peking — China and the Soviet Union this week will
resume their talks on improving relations, with wide
spread expectations of significant progress, including
perhaps the first steps toward reducing the massive
armies each has deployed along their lengthy border.
Soviet and Chinese officials are equally cautious
about how rapidly the bitter, 25-year feud between
the two Communist giants may be ended, but they say
they are certain that there will be further progress in
this second round of bilateral talks, which will take
place in Moscow.
The Chinese delegation, headed by Vice Foreign
Minister Qian Qichen, arrived yesterday in Moscow,
where the official Tass news agency said the talks will
start Tuesday but gave no other details.
On his departure from Peking earlier in the day,
Qian said jokingly, "The weather in Peking is nice to
day, and I hope that it won't be colder in Moscow."
Although not even the most bullish of Soviet ob
servers predicts a return to the Sino-Soviet alliance of
the 19505, gone is the assurance of Western diplomats
who a year or even six months ago dismissed as im
possible any Sino-Soviet rapprochement.
"I think that all the strategic assumptions of a year
ago that were based on an inevitable rivalry between
China and the Soviet Union, a rivalry that the West
could benefit from, must be recalculated," an am
bassador of one of the North Atlantic Treaty Or
ganization countries commented. "I am skeptical
how far they will get, but it already is sufficient to skew
the balance we (the West) had with the Soviet
Union."
Mitterrand stems poll slump
Paris — With barely a week to go before politically
important municipal elections, the latest polls suggest
that France's Socialist Party is climbing out of the most
severe slump in popularity since it came to power.
The right-wing opposition has flung itself furiously
into the campaign, depicting the elections as a na
tionwide referendum on the government's handling

of the economy. They have taken hope from the the
ory of "Carterization" enunciated by some political
commentators — the idea that President Francois Mit
terrand's sharp drop in public opinion polls begin
ning last year forebodes a downward spiral similar to
the second half of the Jimmy Carter administration.
The latest opinion polls are confusing, even con
tradictory. They suggest that more than one in three
French voters has not yet decided how to vote March
6, but at least they no longer support the comparison
to Carter's fate.
Mitterrand, the polls show, still enjoys a 47 percent
approval rating — low by comparison to most French
heads of state but at least 20 points higher than Carter
at his nadir.
What is more, Mitterrand seems to enjoy greater
personal popularity than any of the three principal
leaders of the opposition: former president Valery
Giscard d'Estaing, former prime minister Raymond
Barre, and the neo-Gaullist mayor of Paris, Jacques
Chirac.
Ex-admirals enter arms debate
Washington — Several former top U.S. Navy ad
mirals are sailing into the spreading nuclear arms de
bate — but in many different directions.
In an appearance at the National Press Club, the
former commander of U.S. military forces in the Pacif
ic, retired Adm. Noel Gayler, told his audience last
Thursday that nuclear weapons "have no military use
fulness."
Gayler said he is convinced that the Soviets are
ready for a deal on nuclear arms and suggested that
the two superpowers junk thousands of existing
atomic weapons and freeze production of new ones.
The United States, he added, should renounce the
policy of using atomic weapons first, if necessary.
Earlier this month, retired Adm. Bobby Inman, who
resigned in June as deputy director of the Central In
telligence Agency, joined the board of directors of
the Arms Control Association, a non-partisan or
ganization that advocates arms control as an element
of national security.
Although Inman believes in arms control as the
only way to limit Soviet nuclear power, he does not
advocate a weapons freeze and views as impractical
notions such as Gayler's that huge reductions can be
made or that the Soviets are likely to accept them.
Arens charges U.S. favoritism
Jerusalem — In his first Cabinet meeting as Israel's
new defense minister, Moshe Arens yesterday ac
cused U.S. Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger and
unnamed State Department officials of favoring the
Arabs in conflicts with Israel.
Arens, 57, summarized his impressions of his year as
ambassador in Washington during the regular weekly
Cabinet meeting. His candid personal observation?
were leaked to Israel Radio.
According to the radio account, Arens said of
Weinberger, "It must not be forgotten that he had
business connections with Arab countries in the
past."
Turning to the State Department, he said, "The
more than 20 State Department officials who served in
an Arab country and others asking to be stationed in
the area are working to tilt U.S. policy toward the Ar
abs."
Nevertheless, Arens said the next few months will
be crucial in Israel's relationship with its primary arms
supplier and diplomatic patron.
"The United States recognizes Israel's ability to
contribute to the free world in the aftermath of the
war in Lebanon despite the worsening of relations
caused by the Israeli army's invasion of West Beirut,"
the radio quoted Arens as saying.
