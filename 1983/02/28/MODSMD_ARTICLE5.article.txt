# Top security set for Queen's visit
## 
### BOB DUGONI Staff writer 
Stanford will provide maximum
security protection for Queen
Elizabeth II and her royal party when
they lunch Thursday with University
President Donald Kennedy and
about 90 selected members of the
community at Kennedy's campus
home.
Stanford Police Captain Marvin
Moore said the inner campus secu
rity forces, which include the Stan
ford Police, the Santa Clara County
Sheriff's Department and the Secret
Service are anticipating the possibil
ity of demonstrations.
Moore said the department was
"just going about things as normal as
possible for an event of this size." He
said demonstrators "won't be able to
walk right up to the door and dem
onstrate. The perimeter will be well
away from the house."
Moore could not estimate the size
of the crowd anticipated and would
not comment on security except that
to say there would be maximum pro
tection.
Stanford may be a protest site of
the Irish Republican Committee,
which, with the March Third Coali
tion, is coordinating protests to be
held at San Francisco's De Young
Museum when President Regan
hosts the Queen at a state dinner
there.
John Maher, leader of the Irish Re
publican Committee, met with
members of the Committee this
morning to discuss protesting at
Stanford. He said yesterday that
there is a growing concern by the
Secret Service for the Queen's secu
rity and that the Secret Service is af
raid protestors would pose a physical
threat to the Queen by ying up the
freeway system.
He said that he would be talking to
Secret Service personnel. "If they
have a good argument that the
Queen will be threatened then we
won't go through with it (driving to
Stanford to protest). If it is just hys
teria, as it often is, then we will."
A final decision would not be made
until late tomorrow afternoon,
Maher said, but he stressed that any
protest by the Irish Republican
Committee would be peaceful and
pose no threat to life or property.
"Nobody is going to hurt the
Queen. The Queen is a guest in the
United States. She has been through
this everywhere she goes. She will
peer down her royal nose at us and
carry herself with great aplomb and
dignity."
Maher said that the Queen's
itinerary shows she is here to steal
American technology and jobs and
that protests are being strongly sup

ported by labor unions. Hesaidthere
are labor organizations which are
supportive of a Stanford demonstra
tion.
"She is peddling her royal fanny in
an effort to lure American industry to
Great Britain. This is unconscionable
in a period of 11 percent unemploy
ment," he said.
"Young students are having stu
dent loans in this, the seniors are
hungry, the sick people have no
medicare anymore and this nut job is
going to spent $100 million to chauf
fer her around," he said.
"We don't need any queens in San
Francisco. We kicked her great
grandfather out of here. It is an insult
to the Americans who died at Valley
Forge to spend money people des
perately need."
Maher said demonstrations are
meant to express that "the British
have no place in Ireland, no place
running concentration camps and
they have no place oppressing
Catholics. It's been going on for
years and it has got to stop."
Kasey Brenner, a member of the
Committee in Solidarity with the
People of El Salvador (CISPES) and
one of the coordinators of the March
Third Coalition, said they were not
planning demonstrations here, be
cause they are focusing their atten
tion on Reagan's visit to San Fran
cisco.
"We have a dual focus," she said.
"Reagan never comes to San Fran
cisco and we want to make it clear
there is a lot of opposition to him
here. We are rotesting cutbacks and
involvement in Central America."
She said the group also was pro
testing the cost of the state dinner,
which she estimated at between $5
million and $10 million, because she
said there are 15,000 homeless in San
Francisco.
Police are expecting 20,000 people
for the protest which Brenner said
has been endorsed by "every pro
gressive alliance in San Francisco."
Paul Baer, an official representa
tive of the Stanford Progressive Al
liance (SPA), said the group had not
discussed the Queen's visit or en
dorsing the San Francisco protests.
"For myself, and I think a lot of
individuals (at SPA), there is not a lot
of positive feeling about the Queen.
I think it's a lot of hoopla about
something silly."
Baer said there is the possibility of
individuals taking spontaneous ac
tion such as happened when Secre
tary of Defense Caspar Weinberger
spoke last spring at Kresge Au
ditorium.
He also speculated that SPA would
endorse the San Francisco demon
strations if they were brought up for
discussion.
"For something like this, there is
not a lot of time for people to get
involved," he said. "We have a lot of
other things going on that SPA has a
concrete interest in."
The Stanford Central American Ac

tion Network (SCAAN) has also not
discussed the Queen's visit or en
dorsing any demonstrations.
"The Queen coming here is ir
relevant except for the fact that Re
agan is here. Reagan is the target of
protests because it is his programs
that are screwing up things in Central

Steve Babb.

Baer said there is the possibility of
individuals taking spontaneous ac

tary of Defense Caspar Weinberger
spoke last spring at Kresge Au
ditorium.
He also speculated that SPA would
endorse the San Francisco demon

discussion.
"For something like this, there is
not a lot of time for people to get
involved," he said. "We have a lot of
other things going on that SPA has a
concrete interest in."

Stanford will provide maximum
security protection for Queen
Elizabeth II and her royal party when
they lunch Thursday with University
President Donald Kennedy and
about 90 selected members of the
community at Kennedy's campus
home.
Stanford Police Captain Marvin
Moore said the inner campus secu
rity forces, which include the Stan
ford Police, the Santa Clara County
Sheriff's Department and the Secret
Service are anticipating the possibil
ity of demonstrations.
Moore said the department was
"just going about things as normal as
possible for an event of this size." He
said demonstrators "won't be able to
walk right up to the door and dem
onstrate. The perimeter will be well
away from the house."
Moore could not estimate the size
of the crowd anticipated and would
not comment on security except that
to say there would be maximum pro
tection.
Stanford may be a protest site of
the Irish Republican Committee,
which, with the March Third Coali
tion, is coordinating protests to be
held at San Francisco's De Young
Museum when President Regan
hosts the Queen at a state dinner
there.
John Maher, leader of the Irish Re
publican Committee, met with
members of the Committee this
morning to discuss protesting at
Stanford. He said yesterday that
there is a growing concern by the
Secret Service for the Queen's secu
rity and that the Secret Service is af
raid protestors would pose a physical
threat to the Queen by ying up the
freeway system.
He said that he would be talking to
Secret Service personnel. "If they
have a good argument that the
Queen will be threatened then we
won't go through with it (driving to
Stanford to protest). If it is just hys
teria, as it often is, then we will."
A final decision would not be made
until late tomorrow afternoon,
Maher said, but he stressed that any
protest by the Irish Republican
Committee would be peaceful and
pose no threat to life or property.
"Nobody is going to hurt the
Queen. The Queen is a guest in the
United States. She has been through
this everywhere she goes. She will
peer down her royal nose at us and
carry herself with great aplomb and
dignity."
Maher said that the Queen's
itinerary shows she is here to steal
American technology and jobs and
that protests are being strongly sup

ported by labor unions. Hesaidthere
are labor organizations which are
supportive of a Stanford demonstra
tion.
"She is peddling her royal fanny in
an effort to lure American industry to
Great Britain. This is unconscionable
in a period of 11 percent unemploy
ment," he said.
"Young students are having stu
dent loans in this, the seniors are
hungry, the sick people have no
medicare anymore and this nut job is
going to spent $100 million to chauf
fer her around," he said.
"We don't need any queens in San
Francisco. We kicked her great
grandfather out of here. It is an insult
to the Americans who died at Valley
Forge to spend money people des
perately need."
Maher said demonstrations are
meant to express that "the British
have no place in Ireland, no place
running concentration camps and
they have no place oppressing
Catholics. It's been going on for
years and it has got to stop."
Kasey Brenner, a member of the
Committee in Solidarity with the
People of El Salvador (CISPES) and
one of the coordinators of the March
Third Coalition, said they were not
planning demonstrations here, be
cause they are focusing their atten
tion on Reagan's visit to San Fran
cisco.
"We have a dual focus," she said.
"Reagan never comes to San Fran
cisco and we want to make it clear
there is a lot of opposition to him
here. We are rotesting cutbacks and
involvement in Central America."
She said the group also was pro
testing the cost of the state dinner,
which she estimated at between $5
million and $10 million, because she
said there are 15,000 homeless in San
Francisco.
Police are expecting 20,000 people
for the protest which Brenner said
has been endorsed by "every pro
gressive alliance in San Francisco."
Paul Baer, an official representa
tive of the Stanford Progressive Al
liance (SPA), said the group had not
discussed the Queen's visit or en
dorsing the San Francisco protests.
"For myself, and I think a lot of
individuals (at SPA), there is not a lot
of positive feeling about the Queen.
I think it's a lot of hoopla about
something silly."

individuals taking spontaneous ac
