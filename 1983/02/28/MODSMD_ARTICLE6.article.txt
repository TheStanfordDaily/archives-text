# Socialist leader says students exploited

### KATHY OLMSTED Senior staff writer 
Students cannot arbitrarily sepa
rate themselves from the concerns of
the oppressed and underprivileged,
for they are the oppressed, Michael
Harrington, national chairperson of
the Democratic Socialists of America
(DSA), told the opening session of
the DSA Western Regional Youth
Conference in Annenberg Au
ditorium Friday night.
"When we talk about the eco
nomic, social, international crises of
these times, there's a sense we are
talking about workers, . . . blacks,
chicanos, native Americans, Asians,
etc. We are talking about them," he
said. "And you students in your nob
lesse oblige are going to be kind to
them."
But the existing economic struc
ture also oppresses students — not
just traditional socialist workingclass
constituencies — by restricting the
areas of study that are practical to
pursue, Harrington said.
People are taking courses not that
enrich them, not that are going to
enrich society, but are part of a strat
egy of dealing with an occupational
structure that does not allow people
to enrich themselves or society," he
said.


OPPRESSION: National chairperson of the Democratic Socialists of
America (DSA) Michael Harrington denounced the current economic
system in a speech to more than 300 people in Jordan Hall Friday night.
Harrington was a featured speaker of the DSA Western Regional Youth
C onference held here over the weekend.
According to Harrington, students
can help themselves as much as
others by working for socialist re
forms. "When you look at the ques
tion of changing society and chang
ing its occupational structure and its
crazy system of rewards, you are not
simply doing something for them.
You are perhaps making a halfway
decent life possible for yourself."
Harrington, 55, a grey-haired,
grey-suited, almost avuncular radi
cal, was involved in the Young
Socialist League in the 19505. An early
civil rights activist, in 1963 he pub
lished The Other America — a work
often credited with aiding the Ken
nedy and lohnson administrations in
their rediscovery of the "invisible
poor."
The audience, made up primarily
of delegates to the first Western Re
gional conference of the largest radi
cal youth organization in the coun
try, reacted enthusiastically to Har
rington's cricitism of President
Reagan's contention that the present
economic crisis has been caused by
too much money being lavished on
the welfare state. "It is not the wel
fare state that causes the crisis of the

economy, but the crisis of the eco
nomy that causes the crisis of the
welfare state," he said.
Americans need more social ser
vices, not less, according to Har
rington. Presently the United States
has the "cheapest welfare state" in
the world, he said.
Americans must plan how they will
manage their economy in the chal
lenging years ahead, according to
Harrington. "The very structure of
American capitalism is being trans
formed," he said.
But Harrington satirically said
Americans traditionally find any sort
of state-planning anathema. "Watch
out," he said. "Planning sounds rad
ical. Sounds left wing. Sounds
socialist."
Democratic socialism demands
the democratization of the corporate
elitist decision-making process, Har
rington said. "I am for planning
which is democratic, which involves
the people who are actually affected
by the economic decisions," he said.
"An increase in economic and social
democracy is the only way out of this
crisis."
Harrington denied that socialism
provides only an economic solution.
"Socialism is not a proposal for the
economy," he said. "What socialism
ultimately is about, is a vision of
human freedom."
Harrington, currently a political

science professor at Queens College
in New York, castigated the eco
nomic policies of the Reagan admin
istration, noting that every percent
age point of unemployment costs the
federal government $30 billion.
Harrington also questioned the
motives behind American policies in
Nicaragua and El Salvador. The
United States is a "status quo power
in a revolutionary world," Har
rington said.
The U.S. government expects the
Third World to follow the American
example, and does not understand
when revolutionary movements fail
to adopt capitalistic policies. "We
can't understand why they don't take
a non-existent capitalist road, and
the explanation is there's a com
munist plot," Harrington said.
According to Harrington, the
American response to these imag
ined conspiracies has often been to
support unpopular, undemocratic
dictators who are sympathetic to
American interests. "This govern
ment has done everything in its
power to stop the democratic, the
nonviolent, the progressive alterna
tive," he said. Harrington deplored
the fact that the United States gov
ernment has never learned that help
ing indigenous democratic move
ments would actually benefit U.S.
national security.

Americans must plan how they will
manage their economy in the chal
lenging years ahead, according to
Harrington. "The very structure of
American capitalism is being trans
formed," he said.
But Harrington satirically said
Americans traditionally find any sort
of state-planning anathema. "Watch
out," he said. "Planning sounds rad
ical. Sounds left wing. Sounds
socialist."
Democratic socialism demands
the democratization of the corporate
elitist decision-making process, Har
rington said. "I am for planning
which is democratic, which involves
the people who are actually affected
by the economic decisions," he said.
"An increase in economic and social
democracy is the only way out of this
crisis."
Harrington denied that socialism
provides only an economic solution.
"Socialism is not a proposal for the
economy," he said. "What socialism
ultimately is about, is a vision of
human freedom."
Harrington, currently a political

science professor at Queens College
in New York, castigated the eco
nomic policies of the Reagan admin
istration, noting that every percent
age point of unemployment costs the
federal government $30 billion.
Harrington also questioned the
motives behind American policies in
Nicaragua and El Salvador. The
United States is a "status quo power
in a revolutionary world," Har
rington said.
The U.S. government expects the
Third World to follow the American
example, and does not understand
when revolutionary movements fail
to adopt capitalistic policies. "We
can't understand why they don't take
a non-existent capitalist road, and
the explanation is there's a com
munist plot," Harrington said.
According to Harrington, the
American response to these imag
ined conspiracies has often been to
support unpopular, undemocratic
dictators who are sympathetic to
American interests. "This govern
ment has done everything in its
power to stop the democratic, the
nonviolent, the progressive alterna
tive," he said. Harrington deplored
the fact that the United States gov
ernment has never learned that help
ing indigenous democratic move
ments would actually benefit U.S.
national security.
Students cannot arbitrarily sepa
rate themselves from the concerns of
the oppressed and underprivileged,
for they are the oppressed, Michael
Harrington, national chairperson of
the Democratic Socialists of America
(DSA), told the opening session of
the DSA Western Regional Youth
Conference in Annenberg Au
ditorium Friday night.
"When we talk about the eco
nomic, social, international crises of
these times, there's a sense we are
talking about workers, . . . blacks,
chicanos, native Americans, Asians,
etc. We are talking about them," he
said. "And you students in your nob
lesse oblige are going to be kind to
them."
But the existing economic struc
ture also oppresses students — not
just traditional socialist workingclass
constituencies — by restricting the
areas of study that are practical to
pursue, Harrington said.
People are taking courses not that
enrich them, not that are going to
enrich society, but are part of a strat
egy of dealing with an occupational
structure that does not allow people
to enrich themselves or society," he
said.


OPPRESSION: National chairperson of the Democratic Socialists of
America (DSA) Michael Harrington denounced the current economic
system in a speech to more than 300 people in Jordan Hall Friday night.
Harrington was a featured speaker of the DSA Western Regional Youth
C onference held here over the weekend.
According to Harrington, students
can help themselves as much as
others by working for socialist re
forms. "When you look at the ques
tion of changing society and chang
ing its occupational structure and its
crazy system of rewards, you are not
simply doing something for them.
You are perhaps making a halfway
decent life possible for yourself."
Harrington, 55, a grey-haired,
grey-suited, almost avuncular radi
cal, was involved in the Young
Socialist League in the 19505. An early
civil rights activist, in 1963 he pub
lished The Other America — a work
often credited with aiding the Ken
nedy and lohnson administrations in
their rediscovery of the "invisible
poor."
The audience, made up primarily
of delegates to the first Western Re
gional conference of the largest radi
cal youth organization in the coun
try, reacted enthusiastically to Har
rington's cricitism of President
Reagan's contention that the present
economic crisis has been caused by
too much money being lavished on
the welfare state. "It is not the wel
fare state that causes the crisis of the

economy, but the crisis of the eco
nomy that causes the crisis of the
welfare state," he said.
Americans need more social ser
vices, not less, according to Har
rington. Presently the United States
has the "cheapest welfare state" in
the world, he said.
Americans must plan how they will
manage their economy in the chal
lenging years ahead, according to
Harrington. "The very structure of
