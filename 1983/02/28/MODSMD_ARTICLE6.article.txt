Students cannot arbitrarily sepa
rate themselves from the concerns of
the oppressed and underprivileged,
for they are the oppressed, Michael
Harrington, national chairperson of
the Democratic Socialists of America
(DSA), told the opening session of
the DSA Western Regional Youth
Conference in Annenberg Au
ditorium Friday night.
"When we talk about the eco
nomic, social, international crises of
these times, there's a sense we are
talking about workers, . . . blacks,
chicanos, native Americans, Asians,
etc. We are talking about them," he
said. "And you students in your nob
lesse oblige are going to be kind to
them."
But the existing economic struc
ture also oppresses students — not
just traditional socialist workingclass
constituencies — by restricting the
areas of study that are practical to
pursue, Harrington said.
People are taking courses not that
enrich them, not that are going to
enrich society, but are part of a strat
egy of dealing with an occupational
structure that does not allow people
to enrich themselves or society," he
said.


OPPRESSION: National chairperson of the Democratic Socialists of
America (DSA) Michael Harrington denounced the current economic
system in a speech to more than 300 people in Jordan Hall Friday night.
Harrington was a featured speaker of the DSA Western Regional Youth
C onference held here over the weekend.
