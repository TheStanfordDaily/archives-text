## Dellums lambasts nuclear buildup 
### GLENN BAKER Staff writer 
East Bay Congressman Ron De
llums (D-Berkeley) said he believes
that if the military budget were used
to improve the condition of the
American people, "we would have a
quality of living far superior to that of
any civilization on earth."
Dellums, speaking before an audi
ence of more than 200 in Annenberg
Auditorium Saturday night, blasted a
Reagan administration intent on de
veloping its nuclear arsenal to a point
where the United States could "fight,
win and survive" a nuclear war.
He noted that by 1987, with pre
sent increases, the military budget
would be some $422 billion. By this
time, he said, the military will exceed
37 percent of the total budget and 60
percent of available funds.
Furthermore, Dellums warned, "if
Reagan really wants to play the role
of international protector he must
have a mega-budget far higher than
now." If this occurred, he said, "one
of two things will happen. Either the
economy will dropout from under us
under the weight of the military bur
den, or we will all die."
Dellums, a member of the Democ
ratic Socialists of America, was a fea
tured speaker of the "Reviving the
Left" conference sponsored by the
DSA Western Youth Conference this
weekend.
Dellums stressed that with recent
nuclear additions such as the MX,
Trident and Pershing missiles, the
United States is "going past nuclear
deterrence to warfighting
capabilities." Noting that former
Secretary of Defense Robert
McNamara estimated 400 nuclear
warheads as the amount needed for
deterrence, he pointed out that "we
now have 10,000 warheads. What is
the use to go farther?"
Speaking about the MX, Dellums
proposed placing one missile in each
of the United States' 435 Congres
sional districts. "Then I don't think
they (congressmen) will vote for it,"
Dellums said. Furthermore, he
asked, why do we equip the MX with
Mark 12-8 warheads, "perhaps the
most deadly known to man, if we are
just going to stick it in a hole?"
Interrupted numerous times by
applause from the partisan crowd,
Dellums then discussed the Pershing

missile, scheduled for deployment in
West Germany sometime this year.
Pointing out that this would be just
"four to six minutes by air from the
USSR,'' he called the decision to de
ploy the Pershing "the most danger
ous act this country could engage
in."
Noting that the Soviets would have
a decision time of some few minutes
if they thought the Pershings had
been launched, he asked, "what
would happen if a computer mal
functioned? It's happened before."
About this year's nuclear freeze
initiative, passed decisively by vot
ers, Dellums said, "the first clue that
it was bullshit was it was sent to Con
gress." Noting that politicians thrive
in an atmosphere of ambiguity, he
said the nuclear freeze fit their needs
perfectly. They could "vote for the
military budget, so they won't be
called commie sympathizers, but can
also vote for the freeze so they can
say it to their non-nuclear con
stituents."
Lastly, he said, the peace move
ment has been too polite. "We do
not have that much time. We must
get angry at the people who believe
they can establish the criteria upon
which the world will end."
Pointing out that nuclear war is an
"equal opportunity destroyer which
doesn't give a damn about color,"
Dellums asked for the people of the
United States to "join hands across
the barriers of color, race, age and
class to form a coalition that will stop
this madness and unite us in our hu
manity."
Turning from the military ques
tion, Dellums addressed the prob
lem of apartheid in South Africa,
human rights in Nicaragua and U.S.
espousal of military might over edu
cation and the needs of the poor.
Citing U.S. certification of human
rights progress by the Salvadorean
junta and huge cuts in grants toward
educational and social projects, he
said, "We must root our values in
humanistic policies. Poor people
can't eat MX missiles and students
can't learn from B-1 bombers."
Speaking about the "black and
brown" volunteer army, Dellums
stressed, "We must change the eco
nomic conditions on which the
country is based. This is why blacks
go in; it's the only institution they
can afford."

llums (D-Berkeley) said he believes
that if the military budget were used
to improve the condition of the
American people, "we would have a
quality of living far superior to that of
any civilization on earth."
Dellums, speaking before an audi
ence of more than 200 in Annenberg
Auditorium Saturday night, blasted a
Reagan administration intent on de
veloping its nuclear arsenal to a point
where the United States could "fight,
win and survive" a nuclear war.
He noted that by 1987, with pre
sent increases, the military budget
would be some $422 billion. By this
time, he said, the military will exceed
37 percent of the total budget and 60
percent of available funds.
Furthermore, Dellums warned, "if
Reagan really wants to play the role
of international protector he must
have a mega-budget far higher than
now." If this occurred, he said, "one
of two things will happen. Either the
economy will dropout from under us
under the weight of the military bur
den, or we will all die."
Dellums, a member of the Democ
ratic Socialists of America, was a fea
tured speaker of the "Reviving the
Left" conference sponsored by the
DSA Western Youth Conference this
weekend.
Dellums stressed that with recent
nuclear additions such as the MX,
Trident and Pershing missiles, the
United States is "going past nuclear
deterrence to warfighting
capabilities." Noting that former
Secretary of Defense Robert
McNamara estimated 400 nuclear
warheads as the amount needed for
deterrence, he pointed out that "we
now have 10,000 warheads. What is
the use to go farther?"
Speaking about the MX, Dellums
proposed placing one missile in each
of the United States' 435 Congres
sional districts. "Then I don't think
they (congressmen) will vote for it,"
Dellums said. Furthermore, he
asked, why do we equip the MX with
Mark 12-8 warheads, "perhaps the
most deadly known to man, if we are
just going to stick it in a hole?"
Interrupted numerous times by
applause from the partisan crowd,
Dellums then discussed the Pershing

missile, scheduled for deployment in
West Germany sometime this year.
Pointing out that this would be just
"four to six minutes by air from the
USSR,'' he called the decision to de
ploy the Pershing "the most danger
ous act this country could engage
in."
Noting that the Soviets would have
a decision time of some few minutes
if they thought the Pershings had
been launched, he asked, "what
would happen if a computer mal
functioned? It's happened before."
About this year's nuclear freeze
initiative, passed decisively by vot
ers, Dellums said, "the first clue that
it was bullshit was it was sent to Con
gress." Noting that politicians thrive
in an atmosphere of ambiguity, he
said the nuclear freeze fit their needs
perfectly. They could "vote for the
military budget, so they won't be
called commie sympathizers, but can
also vote for the freeze so they can
say it to their non-nuclear con
stituents."
Lastly, he said, the peace move
ment has been too polite. "We do
not have that much time. We must
get angry at the people who believe
they can establish the criteria upon
which the world will end."
Pointing out that nuclear war is an
"equal opportunity destroyer which
doesn't give a damn about color,"
Dellums asked for the people of the
United States to "join hands across
the barriers of color, race, age and
class to form a coalition that will stop
this madness and unite us in our hu
manity."
Turning from the military ques
tion, Dellums addressed the prob
lem of apartheid in South Africa,
human rights in Nicaragua and U.S.
espousal of military might over edu
cation and the needs of the poor.
Citing U.S. certification of human
rights progress by the Salvadorean
junta and huge cuts in grants toward
educational and social projects, he
said, "We must root our values in
humanistic policies. Poor people
can't eat MX missiles and students
can't learn from B-1 bombers."
Speaking about the "black and
brown" volunteer army, Dellums
stressed, "We must change the eco
nomic conditions on which the
country is based. This is why blacks
go in; it's the only institution they
can afford."
