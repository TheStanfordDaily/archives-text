# Experts in arms control panel disagree on effectiveness of deterrence strategy
## 
### JANE MCCONNELL 
Members of a Great Powers Seminar panel
held this weekend disagreed on the issue of
counterforce — the ability to launch a devastat
ing first strike in a nuclear exchange — as a
means to prevent nuclear war.
"The best counterforce is zero counterforce,"
said Sidney Drell, deputy director cf the Stanford
Linear Acclerator Center (SLAC), during the
panel discussion in Terman Auditorium yester
day.
"We need to go back to deterrence," said
Drell. "We've moved to open-ended competi
tion rather than an effort at arms control."
Leon Sloss, president of the Stanford Alumni
Association and former assistant director of the
U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency,
disagreed. "We may have an inadequate coun
terforce capability today," Sloss said. He argued
that advances have been taking place on the
Soviet side, and counterforce capabilities that
were adequate a decade ago may be obsolete
today.
The purpose of the seminar, which was spon
sored by the Alumni Association in conjunction
with the Stanford Arms Control and Disarma
ment Program, was to give people a more in
formed and balanced sense of disarmament and
arms control.
On the question of the impact of past arms
control efforts, Drell responded that so far,
we've managed to make deterrence work.
"Since 1945 we've managed a competition with

the Soviet Union without using weapons, and
that's a success sign," he said.
The problem now, Drell said , is that "the
physicists are too good for politicians."
William Hyland, senior associate of the Car
negie Endowment for International Peace and
formerpresidential advisor, agreed. "You can no
longercontrol the technology involved. We're in
a new era now, and we're still arguing about
out-of-date issues."
Hyland also agreed that deterrence so far has
been successful. "There have never been any
two great powers in conflict that didn't get in a
war within a 30-year period," he said. "The exis
tence of nuclear weapons and the fact that one
had been used already had sobered both sides
and made deterrence possible."
However, History Prof. Barton Bernstein ob
jected strongly to this view. "The reason we ha
ven't used nuclear weapons so far is not because
of deterrence," he said. "Each crisis has its own
discreet explanation. You cannot cite the un
iform explanation of deterrence."
Another issue which arose was the question of
public impact on the arms control movement.
Referring to public attempts to influence Con
gress, Coit Blacker, associate director of the
Stanford Arms Control and Disarmament Pro
gram, said, "The public needs to be specific and
detailed in their demands. The congressman's
frustration comes in trying to read what he's
being told. The capacity of the public to articu
late their views can have a tremendous impact."

Bernstein, on the other hand, said he felt that
the government should spend less time worrying
about the details of public opinion and more
time responding to the general climate of opin
ion.
"The government will always have the prob
lem of interpreting the public's wants. Just be
cause a message can't be construed precisely
doesn't mean it should be ignored," he said.
"Often a message such as a freeze is an indica
tion that means that these issues should be
moved from the margin to the center."
Hyland said he feels that the problem is a gap
between the public and the arms control experts.
"Only a narrow group of people understand
what's going on, and because those who under
stand the whole nuclear theology can't get their
views to the public, they end up sounding like
madmen."
However, Hyland said he does feel that public
influence is a good thing. "It forces us to rethink
our positions," he said. "The freeze movement is
a cry for help, and even though I'm opposed to it,
in that sense it's a good thing."
To close this gap between the public and the
arms controllers, Blacker said he feels that the
public must get more involved, and the experts
must become more open to suggestions. "The
arms controllers need to lose some of their arro
gance. The attitude right now is that the problem
is so sophisticated that you should leave it to us.
A well-informed public can connect and help
inform."

Leon Sloss, president of the Stanford Alumni
Association and former assistant director of the
U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency,
disagreed. "We may have an inadequate coun
terforce capability today," Sloss said. He argued
that advances have been taking place on the
Soviet side, and counterforce capabilities that
were adequate a decade ago may be obsolete
today.
The purpose of the seminar, which was spon
sored by the Alumni Association in conjunction
with the Stanford Arms Control and Disarma
ment Program, was to give people a more in
formed and balanced sense of disarmament and
arms control.
On the question of the impact of past arms
control efforts, Drell responded that so far,
we've managed to make deterrence work.
"Since 1945 we've managed a competition with

the Soviet Union without using weapons, and
that's a success sign," he said.
The problem now, Drell said , is that "the
physicists are too good for politicians."
William Hyland, senior associate of the Car
negie Endowment for International Peace and
formerpresidential advisor, agreed. "You can no
longercontrol the technology involved. We're in
a new era now, and we're still arguing about
out-of-date issues."
Hyland also agreed that deterrence so far has
been successful. "There have never been any
two great powers in conflict that didn't get in a
war within a 30-year period," he said. "The exis
tence of nuclear weapons and the fact that one
had been used already had sobered both sides
and made deterrence possible."
However, History Prof. Barton Bernstein ob
jected strongly to this view. "The reason we ha
ven't used nuclear weapons so far is not because
of deterrence," he said. "Each crisis has its own
discreet explanation. You cannot cite the un
iform explanation of deterrence."
Another issue which arose was the question of
public impact on the arms control movement.
Referring to public attempts to influence Con
gress, Coit Blacker, associate director of the
Stanford Arms Control and Disarmament Pro
gram, said, "The public needs to be specific and
detailed in their demands. The congressman's
frustration comes in trying to read what he's
being told. The capacity of the public to articu
late their views can have a tremendous impact."

Bernstein, on the other hand, said he felt that
the government should spend less time worrying
about the details of public opinion and more
time responding to the general climate of opin
ion.
"The government will always have the prob
lem of interpreting the public's wants. Just be
cause a message can't be construed precisely
doesn't mean it should be ignored," he said.
"Often a message such as a freeze is an indica
tion that means that these issues should be
moved from the margin to the center."
Hyland said he feels that the problem is a gap
between the public and the arms control experts.
"Only a narrow group of people understand
what's going on, and because those who under
stand the whole nuclear theology can't get their
views to the public, they end up sounding like
madmen."
However, Hyland said he does feel that public
influence is a good thing. "It forces us to rethink
our positions," he said. "The freeze movement is
a cry for help, and even though I'm opposed to it,
in that sense it's a good thing."
To close this gap between the public and the
arms controllers, Blacker said he feels that the
public must get more involved, and the experts
must become more open to suggestions. "The
arms controllers need to lose some of their arro
gance. The attitude right now is that the problem
is so sophisticated that you should leave it to us.
A well-informed public can connect and help
inform."
