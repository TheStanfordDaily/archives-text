## University pursues effort to house faculty here Dwindling land, spiraling prices prompt extra programs 
### COLLEEN GILLARD First in a four-part series 
That Stanford was desig
nated as a residential university
is not unique, and probably to
be expected from its rural ori
gins. What is unusual is Stan
ford's commitment to housing
its faculty.
Few universities in the coun
try do more than suitably lo
cate their senior adminis
trators. Princeton, Wellesley
and Pepperdine are among the
few that provide some faculty
housing; Stanford alone
makes the effort to house the
majority of its faculty.
One reason for this is that
Stanford is land-rich. And al
though the University may not
sell any part of its more than
8100 acres, as written into its
land deed, it can and does
lease tracts of land.
The University receives a
healthy income from rent off of
the Industrial Park and Stan
ford Shopping Center. Robin
Hamill, director of housing
programs, said that income
from such leases allows Stan
ford to compete with the better
endowed Ivy League schools.
Although the University's en
dowment now tops $6 billion,
its yearly income from gifts lags
far behind other Ivy League
universities.
Land wealth has also helped
the University in faculty re
cruitment drives, according to
Hamill. "Up until 1973, when
Frenchman's Hill was com
pleted, a newly arrived faculty
member could purchase, rela
tively inexpensively, a long
term ground lease on Stanford
land, and build a lovely single
family home, the construction
of which would be financed by
Stanford, which provided
long-term, low-interest
mortgages, he said.
Once a nice recruiting tool
these figurative land gifts have
led to tremendous windfall
profits to owners of homes on
Stanford land. Land leases that
were purchased 10 years ago
for $8000 are today worth more
than $100,000.
The sudden booming
growth of the electronic indus

try in the Santa Ciara County
has created a housing shortage
that is demonstrated by the
prices currently being asked
for homes in the area. Publica
tions from the Office of Hous
ing Programs say that in Fa'o
Alto alone, 20,000 new jobs hit
the market in the late '70s as
compared to the construction
of only 1400 new housing units.
Stanford, one of the largest
employers in the region, hires
more than 1500 faculty, nearly
11,000 staff and serves a stu
dent population of 12,000. Hav
ing developed the industrial
park and the Stanford Shop
ping Center, the University is
also responsible for introduc
ing another 30,000 other jobs
into the immediate area.
Hamill said, "We are living in
one of the highest priced hous
ing markets in ihe country; and
our faculty are not better paid
than comparable groups at
other universities. If we are try
ing to recruit Professor X who
also has an offer from Yale, we
cannot hope to be able to tell
him that he would be able to
buy anything close to the
4-bedroom colonial on four
acres for $150,000. Here that
sum wouldn't buy him a tract
home on a quarter-acre. It is
more important now than at
any other time that we provide
our faculty with housing."
Frenchmen's Hill, devel
oped 10 years ago, will proba
bly be the University's last
single-family home develop
ment. University lands are
nearing full build-out. The
University will no longer lease
lots for home building at far
below their market value.
The Peter Coutts con
dominiums, which went on
sale this year, are the Universi
ty's fifth faculty housing proj
ect. Stanford West will be the
sixth. Marketing of the Peter
Coutts units marked a change
in University policy towards
the use of its land endowment.
The University's land-use
policy should be based on the

principle that profit on land
given to the University should
go to the University for
academic or academic-related
purposes. Stanford cannot
alienate its land endowment,
Hamill said. "So the board of
trustees met to decide what to
do about the situation, and

ruled that henceforward all
housing would be priced at
market rates."
The Peter Coutts units, at a
7-per-acre density, start at
$170,000 for a 2-bedroom,
2-bath, 1200 square-foot unit. \
2000 square-foot 3-bedroom,
3-bath, plus study unit is priced

at $270,000. But Hamill pointed
out that the University pro
vides attractive financing
which, for example, is enabling
one buyer who makes less than
$20,000 to purchase a $170,000
unit.
Although not all of these
condominiums have as yet

Artie Streiber

been purchased, the Univer
sity may begin construction on
the $175 unit Stanford West
next summer.
Lucille Wong, manager of
faculty/staff housing, said that
the reasons for the new con
struction reflect a new Univer
sity commitment to try to meet

the needs of junior faculty and
University staff. As it is, only
faculty and senior staff mem
bers are eligible to live in the
"faculty ghetto." Housing on
campus now comprises 50 per
cent of the 1500 faculty mem
bers and 4 percent of the 11,000
staff members (those that hold
senior administrative posi
tions).
San Juan Hill, Pine Hill I and
II and Frenchmen's Hill com
prise what is popularly known
as the Faculty Ghetto. Homes
on San )uan Hill were built over
the years from 1891-1930. Large
homes, including the presi
dent's home, occupy one to
four acre lots in this area. Pine
Hill I and II homes were built in
the late '50s and early '60s on
one-third acre lots, and Fren
chman Hill construction fol
lowed in the late '60s on
quarter-acre lots. Unlike San
luan Hill whose tenants pur
chased $4000 80-year leases,
the Pine Hill and Frenchman
Hill residents signed 51-year
leases for $8000. These single
family homes number 613.
In 1974 Pearce Mitchell was
built as the first faculty con
dominiums. Units were solcJ
for between $30,000 and
$70,000 and were designed for
retiring professors.
The Stanford West devel
opment, to be located on 51
acres along Willow Koad, is de
signed to meet the needs of
junior faculty and University
I staff, particularly the nurses
and interns at the hospital
whose needs are especially
acute because of their long
hours and small salaries.
Andrew Doty, director of
community relations, said that
although junior faculty are elig
ible to buy one of the Peter
Coutts units, they must sell
within two years if denied ten
ure. At Stanford West, they
would not be required to sell,
i This is a unique concept in
t University policy. It is possible
that over time as many as 30
112 percent of the families in the
t development could lose their
University affiliation through
changes in employment,

ROOM FOR RENT?: Because
of high rent in the area and a
need to attract top-flight pro
fessors as economically as
possible, the University
makes an unusually con
certed effort to house its fac
ulty. Some professors live in
condominium projects like
the Peter Coutts project (top)
while the more established
live in the "Faculty Ghetto"

That Stanford was desig
nated as a residential university
is not unique, and probably to
be expected from its rural ori
gins. What is unusual is Stan
ford's commitment to housing
its faculty.
Few universities in the coun
try do more than suitably lo
cate their senior adminis
trators. Princeton, Wellesley
and Pepperdine are among the
few that provide some faculty
housing; Stanford alone
makes the effort to house the
majority of its faculty.
One reason for this is that
Stanford is land-rich. And al
though the University may not
sell any part of its more than
8100 acres, as written into its
land deed, it can and does
lease tracts of land.
The University receives a
healthy income from rent off of
the Industrial Park and Stan
ford Shopping Center. Robin
Hamill, director of housing
programs, said that income
from such leases allows Stan
ford to compete with the better
endowed Ivy League schools.
Although the University's en
dowment now tops $6 billion,
its yearly income from gifts lags
far behind other Ivy League
universities.
Land wealth has also helped
the University in faculty re
cruitment drives, according to
Hamill. "Up until 1973, when
Frenchman's Hill was com
pleted, a newly arrived faculty
member could purchase, rela
tively inexpensively, a long
term ground lease on Stanford
land, and build a lovely single
family home, the construction
of which would be financed by
Stanford, which provided
long-term, low-interest
mortgages, he said.
Once a nice recruiting tool
these figurative land gifts have
led to tremendous windfall
profits to owners of homes on
Stanford land. Land leases that
were purchased 10 years ago
for $8000 are today worth more
than $100,000.
The sudden booming
growth of the electronic indus

try in the Santa Ciara County
has created a housing shortage
that is demonstrated by the
prices currently being asked
for homes in the area. Publica
tions from the Office of Hous
ing Programs say that in Fa'o
Alto alone, 20,000 new jobs hit
the market in the late '70s as
compared to the construction
of only 1400 new housing units.
Stanford, one of the largest
employers in the region, hires
more than 1500 faculty, nearly
11,000 staff and serves a stu
dent population of 12,000. Hav
ing developed the industrial
park and the Stanford Shop
ping Center, the University is
also responsible for introduc
ing another 30,000 other jobs
into the immediate area.
Hamill said, "We are living in
one of the highest priced hous
ing markets in ihe country; and
our faculty are not better paid
than comparable groups at
other universities. If we are try
ing to recruit Professor X who
also has an offer from Yale, we
cannot hope to be able to tell
him that he would be able to
buy anything close to the
4-bedroom colonial on four
acres for $150,000. Here that
sum wouldn't buy him a tract
home on a quarter-acre. It is
more important now than at
any other time that we provide
our faculty with housing."
Frenchmen's Hill, devel
oped 10 years ago, will proba

ment. University lands are
nearing full build-out. The
University will no longer lease
lots for home building at far
below their market value.
The Peter Coutts con
dominiums, which went on
sale this year, are the Universi
ty's fifth faculty housing proj
ect. Stanford West will be the
sixth. Marketing of the Peter
Coutts units marked a change
in University policy towards
the use of its land endowment.
The University's land-use
policy should be based on the

principle that profit on land
given to the University should
go to the University for
academic or academic-related
purposes. Stanford cannot
alienate its land endowment,
Hamill said. "So the board of
trustees met to decide what to
do about the situation, and

ruled that henceforward all
housing would be priced at
market rates."
The Peter Coutts units, at a
7-per-acre density, start at
$170,000 for a 2-bedroom,
2-bath, 1200 square-foot unit. \
2000 square-foot 3-bedroom,
3-bath, plus study unit is priced

at $270,000. But Hamill pointed
out that the University pro
vides attractive financing
which, for example, is enabling
one buyer who makes less than
$20,000 to purchase a $170,000
unit.
Although not all of these
condominiums have as yet

Lucille Wong, manager of
faculty/staff housing, said that
the reasons for the new con
struction reflect a new Univer
sity commitment to try to meet

the needs of junior faculty and
University staff. As it is, only
faculty and senior staff mem
bers are eligible to live in the
"faculty ghetto." Housing on
campus now comprises 50 per

bers and 4 percent of the 11,000

senior administrative posi
tions).
