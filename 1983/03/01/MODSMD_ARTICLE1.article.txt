# Kennedy denounces new aid/draft link
## 
### ALAN TRIPP Senior staff writer 
University President Donald Ken
nedy blasted proposed federal regu
lations on student aid yesterday, say
ing they will impose a very heavy
and wholly unjustifiable burden on
colleges and universities and will al
most surely penalize students" who
have already registered with the
Selective Service Administration.
Kennedy's remarks were made in
an open letter to Andrea Foley, an
administrator iri the Office of Stu
dent Financial Assistance at the U.S.
Department of Education.
"The Department of Education has
proposed regulations that are di
rectly contrary to the congressional
intent of a simple implementation of
a simple statutory requirement,"
Kennedy said "They go beyond the
authorized limits and, contrary to
expressed congressional intentions,
impose undue administrative and fi
nancial burdens on educational in
stitutions.''
According ro Kennedy, even stu
dents who nave fully complied with
registration requirements may suffer
from "unnecessary delay in provid
ing financial aid" and the "attendent
risk of . .an actual loss of educa
tional opportunity.
"The regulations exceed their
statutory authority and controvert a
congressional intent that they not
place undue administrative burdens
on colleges and universities," Ken
nedy sa'd.
The implementation of the regula
tions is to be done in such a way as to
"minimize the administrative burden
on colleges and universities and the
delays in processing aid applications
and awards," according to an August
1982 House Conference Report.
Other congressional records indi
cate that "the burden of verification
•be plated on the Selective Service
System and not on the schools."
According to Kennedy, although
the statute requires a student subject
to the selective service registration
requirements to file a statement of
compliance with the requirement, it
does not require or suggest that this
statement be verified prior to is
suance or award of Title IV student
aid funds. But the proposed regula
tions require actual verification that a

student has in fact registered prior to
receipt of Title IV monies.
"Neither the statute nor the 'egis
lative history contains any sugges
tion that verification of registration
status may be required priot to the
award aid. The proposed regula
tions, however, ignoreall of this
Kennedy said.
"The most dramatic and burden
some departure from the require
ments of the statute is the require
ment that schools become actively
involved in pre-award verification of
students' compliance with the Sele<
tive Service's registration require
ments," Kennedy said.
"While the statute provides that
schools 'may' be required to provide
a list of students who have submitted
statements of compliance, this is the
maximum burden the statute con
templates. Vet the proposed regula
tions place the burden of verification
wholly upon the educational institu
tions."
According to Kennedy, the prr
posed regulations require state
ments from all students seeking fed
eral aid regardless of whether they
are required to register with the
Selective Service. "This would be an
annual burden in all students seek
ing Title IV assistance," he said.
Kennedy pointed to yet another
flaw in the proposed regulations By
unnecessarily thrusting the Univer
sity into the role of primary enforcer
of a controversial statute thot has
other ample, and far more approp
riate, methods of enforcement the
regulations are inimical to the tradi
tio n a I relationship between
academic institutions and their stu
dents."
Kennedy suggested that there
quirements of the statute could b<

SAILING ANYONE?: Sophomore Noah Norduck is shown here
windsurfing on Lake Lagunita yesterday. The winds, which gusted up to

Artie Streiber/Daily
55 mph, capsized Norduck's boat and left him in the somewhat less than
warm waters of the lake.
