## National service could replace draft 
### 
Former President Jimmy Carter's
revival of selective service registra
tion and the Reagan administration's
recently proposed regulation to
deny federally-funded financial aid
to non-registrants evoked sharp
criticism from many in the Stanford
community. Yet recent criticisms of
draft registration and the aid/
registration link have almost com
pletely ignored a broader issue un
derlying the Draft versus All-
Volunteer Army debate: the conflict
between the rights we demand and
the duties we incur as citizens of the
United States remains at the center
of arguments over how to maintain a
system of effective national defense.
Belief in the citizen-soldier and the
obligation of every citizen to do his
part to defend freedom runs as deep
in Americans as does commitment to
individual liberty and the abhorrence
of coercion. The dilemma is not a
new one. More than 2()0 vears ago
jean-Jacques Rousseau in his The So
cial Contract struggled over the fun
damental problem of "How to find a
form of association which will de
fend the person and goods of each

member with the collective force of
all, and under which each individual,
while uniting himself wilh the
others, obeys no one but himsell and
remains as free as before."
One of the most hotly debated al
ternatives to the draft and the volun
teer systems has been the institution
of a system of national service.
Under one such system all young
men (and possibly women) would be
required to give one year of service
to the nation — either in a military or
a non-militarv capacity.
Another variation of a system of
national service put forth by former
Rep. Paul "Pete" McCloskey would
give an 18-year-old four options: he
could enlist in the military for two
years ami in return receive four years
of <ollege benefits; he could enlist
for six months, followed by five and a
half years of combat-ready reserve
status and receive one year of college
benefits; he could volunteer for one
year of civilian service in a number ot
federal, local or charitable agencies
to perform a service at subsistence
pay; or he could do nothing which

would automatically make him eligi
ble to be drafted.
A 1981 Gallup poll revealed that
almost three-quarters of a national
sample of Americans favored a sys
tem ot national service. Surprisingly,
58 percent of the age group that
would be most directly affected by
such a plan, those between the ages
of 18 and 24 years old, approved of a
national service system. A majority of
those polled favored extending the
scope of national service to include
women as well.
Supporters of a program of na
tional service contend it would sup
ply needed manpower for the armed
forces (particularly the reserves) and
would also supply a means tor utiliz
ing the remainder of young people in
non-military functions designed to
benefit the national purpose. The
system, they say, would encourage a
' sense of commitment" to the coun
try and would also increase interac
tion among young people of diverse
backgrounds. Practical advantages
could include a reduction of youth
unemployment and the institution of
a more equitable system of military

service, which would reduce feelings
of envy and guilt caused by a draft
and would prevent a dispropor
tionate burden from being borne by
minorities and those at an economic
disadvantage, which some claim has
occurred under the present system.
However, the objectives sought
through national service are possible
but not certain outcomes of the in
stitution of such a program. Possible
problems in such a system might be:
expense, the creation of another
massive bureaucracy, displacement
of currently employed workers
(which could trigger union hostility),
creation of make-work tasks or non
essential jobs, and the restriction of
total individual freedom. In addition,
many opponents of national service
point out that the need for such a
svstem is questionable in the first
place.
In summation, I should like to say
that both the draft and national ser
vice have their advantages and dis
advantages, but neither should be
ignored or evaded.

unemployment and the institution of
a more equitable system of military

service, which would reduce feelings
of envy and guilt caused by a draft
and would prevent a dispropor
tionate burden from being borne by
minorities and those at an economic
disadvantage, which some claim has
occurred under the present system.
However, the objectives sought
through national service are possible
but not certain outcomes of the in
stitution of such a program. Possible
problems in such a system might be:
expense, the creation of another
massive bureaucracy, displacement
of currently employed workers
(which could trigger union hostility),
creation of make-work tasks or non
essential jobs, and the restriction of
total individual freedom. In addition,
many opponents of national service
point out that the need for such a
svstem is questionable in the first
place.
In summation, I should like to say
that both the draft and national ser
vice have their advantages and dis
advantages, but neither should be
ignored or evaded.
