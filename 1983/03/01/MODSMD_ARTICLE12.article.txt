## Guide to the information age 
### 
Now and then history delivers a way of thinking and
living so powerful that its influence is both everywhere
and invisible. The people and societies overtaken by it
rarely recognize the new influence, and even those who
do usually need to wait for the passage of time to fully
uncover the limitations of that way of life.
In our own age, however, we at places like Stanford
have been quick, though not without ,1 great deal ot
tortured self-consciousness and smug >t-lt
congratulation, to acknowledge the nascent informa
tion age." Much scholarly and entrepreneurial activity is
devoted to the "new wave" of technological revolution,
yet we often seem so enamored ot the potentials that we
fail to question the single term on which the entire
ideology pivots, i.e., information.
Scarcely any term has been pressed into more diverse
service than information. Pseudo-prophetic pundits like
to proclaim that our age is no longer "post-industrial" or
"nuclear" but the age of information. Students of global
political economy sometimes claim that information has
replaced cash as the currency of international trade.
Closer to home, we are told that California was the tirst
"information society," and that we spend our days as
students and teachers managing, processing, disseminat
ing, and presumably storing, information. And wher
ever one turns in the University, one finds information
theory and technology inscribed n 'he discourse of
cognitive, computer, engineering, ohvsual and social
sciences.
Information has thus become the* urgency not < nlv ot
the global economy but ot our intellectual ec onomy (or
"market-place of ideas") as well. From the arcane world
of information theory (with its entropy, rareness, noise,
etc.) has sprung an encompassing information practice,
extending from our words to our actions, from our
thought to our everyday lives.
Nowhere are the implications of information practice
more evident than in the University. We tend to con
ceive of our mission as gathering and ordering informa
tion, yet we lament the tact ot its "explosion, since much
of our life as scholars situates at the c enter of this ten
sion, it is perhaps worthwhile to examine some of the
properties of this new currency. I offer the following as a
kind of ontology of information, striving tor suggestive
ness over exhaustiveness.
* Information is either true or false. It is founded < in rin
Aristotelian, either-or logic of exclusion. Information s
truth value can be ascertained by checking it against an
objective reality "out (here." a realitv both knowdble
and given. Since its "truth is always a matter ofveritvmg
it with extensive reality, information has a hard time
accounting for intensive phenomena such as fiction,
fantasy and dreams, which are both not real and more
real than real.
* Information is factual, not evaluative. Information is
the materialization of science's dream to erect a lan

guage purged of values arid metaphysical excrescences.
Information < onsists of descriptive specifications of
space-time events. Yet information cannot account for
the |udgment made in < hoosing a conceptual framework
in which to understand the information, without which
it remains a hodge-podge of fragments. Information
r ests on a mefaphvsit al structure which severes tact and
value, quest*on> <! ucuracv from questions of judg
ment
• information is dated. Fvery hit of information has a
half-life The utlitv of information decays with time. And
the more information accumulates, the shorter the half
life of each <ndividual bit. Contrast this property with
some works of art which remain timeless and become all
the richer as thev inspire further elaborations.
• Information is granular. Informational bits are dis
crete and independent of each other. There is no syntax
to information, and no tradition »o it. Technically, infor
mation lacks mtertextualitv. '
information s a < ommoditv. information's original

For instance, consider the implications of knowledge
conceived of as information Education then becomes
the ingestion and digestion of information rather than
an active engagement with the ob|ect of study, as in the
Hellenic ideal of practical reason. Politics then becomes
a problem of information diffusion rather than the clash
and articulation of vdlues and interests. The mind then
becomes a grand processor of information while desire
and value are relegated to the dark and private realm i if
subjectivity.
The build-up of information has brought much good
