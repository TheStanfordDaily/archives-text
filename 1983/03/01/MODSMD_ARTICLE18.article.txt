## Duel: Ohlsson versus Scriabin – best two out of three 
### MARC VINCENTI 
No. Garrick Ohlsson does not fall off the
piano bench everv time he plays Scriabin's
Sonata No 5.
This may come as welcome (or disappoint
ing) news to those concert-goers who saw
this fine pianist at his reclta! in Memorial
Auditorium last May. On that occasion,
when Ohlsson barrelled through the
final measures of Scriabin's No. 5, lunging
from the bottom of the keyboard to the top
in one impetuous surge toward the ultimate
C-sharp, he slid from his seat. For a precari
ous moment, Ohlsson (who is bearded,
robust, and must stand at least six and-a-half
feet tall) looked like a Point Lobos sea-lion
diving nose-first from a low-lying rock, to go
for a noonday swim. Luckilv, though, he
never h«t the water. At the last instant he
grbbed the piano w th both hands and
caught himself.
Ohlsson may not fall off the piano bench

regularly, but his playing of Scriabin has lost
none of its concentrated power, as evi
denced by his recital at Dominican College
in San Rafael fast Sunday. In addition tc the
Sonata No. 5, Ohlsson played three other
short pieces by Scriabin, plus Mozart's C
major Sonata, K. 330 and Beethoven s
Sonata No. 29, Opus 106, the "Ham
merklavier."
Among composers, Scriabin — writing in
the early years of the 20th century — oc
cupies a unique and striking position He
developed a harmonic language and a musi
cal vision so idiosyncratic and personal that
Straveinsky said of him, "Where does he
come from? And who are his forebears?"
Moody, excited, and nervous, Scriabin s
music often builds towards tumultuous
climaxes that are catacylsms of sour.d ar.d
energy. The rapt extravagant spirit of his
works's evoked in his expressive markings
such as "vertiginoso con funa " "con

uminosita," ' estatioo," and "fantastico."
Scriab'n had a vsionary, mystical cast o»
m>nd Toward the end of his life he set out to
compose a huge orchestral piece employ

accompany the final expiration of the human
race, and would he performed on a moun

the thunger and lightning found in

The sonata commences in the deep bass

wasted no time getting to the piano's first
fu'l-throated roar. This breaks oft abruptly,
though into a measure of silence which
Ohlsson held tor a long time. Then the tone
changed utterly as he moved into the sen
suo s laziness of the section marked "lan
guido.
Further on, in another passage marked
"sotto voce" — with the added instructions
'mister'oso ' and affanato' ( distressed' )
— Oh'sson scarcely slackened the music's
onward, assertive rush. But when he
reached the slower episode marked "ac

ot melody to wonderful effect. He deliber

S( nabin is not everyone's cup of tea. His
dark hued ardor may be likened to Pro
kofiev or Rachmamnov, his harmonic inno
vations are fascinating, even seductive, and
some listeners hear eroticism in Scriabin.
For my own part, too much Scriabin makes
me want to claw my way out of the pall of
frustration and disappointment which be

In this case, Scriabin's gloom and doom
stood out a'l the more clearly, following, as
they d'H the refreshing joy of Mozart's
Sonata * JiO Here, Ohlsson's performance

was infectious and sparkling, full of the deli
cate. fleeting contrasts that bring Mozart to
life
For example, the fifth and sixth measures
of the open>g movement offer in the right
hand, two lilting filaments that skip briefly
upwards to land on high C. With what gen
tleness Ohlsson played these notes, with a
very slight decrescendo that allowed no ac
cent on the high C's. Then, in the recapitula
tion, where these two filaments re-appear,
Ohlsson revealed the tender playfulness of
Mozart s thought, as above each high C
Mozart inscribed an unexpected, even
higher note — an even softer note, that sur
pn<es you like -i stone that, skipped across
♦he surface o* a lake, takes one more tiny,
delicate skip than you thought it would.
Mso m the recapitulation, in the fourth

measure of the second theme, Mozart sur
prises us with an F-natural in the bass line
where the ear expects a G (as happened, first
time round, in the exposition). Suddenly,
ever so slightly, Ohlsson slowed the tempo
in this measure, drawing this miniscule sur
prise to the ear's delighted attention.
In the Andante, Ohlsson didn't hesitate to
use the pedal, but more in order to richen
the tone than to facilitate playing legato.
Near the end of the minor-key middle sec
tion, Ohlsson's responsiveness to Mozart's
details again bore fruit, as he showed us the

pathos in that soft chord where Mozart has
placed a dissonant E-natural in lieu of the
expected F.
In the closing Allegretto, Ohlsson at first
colored the theme with the simple naivete of
a nursery rhyme, then, upon repeating it,
intensified the tune's energy. Where the
triplets appear, he shifted into yet a higher
gear from which, instead of letting the ex
citement vanish at the C-major cadence, he
shifted up one more gear in beginning the "
next tune. Finally, right before the end fol-1
lowing those groups of nonchalant, time-.*
to-go-home triplets, Ohlsson took special ♦
care with the deceptive cadence into-
A-minor, underlining it, setting it slightly \
apart, suggesting in one brief stroke a world "
of poignance


Garrick Ohlsson


The treacherous passage: Scriabin's Sonata 5, Opus 53
Of such attention to detail, tine perform
antes are made, I only wish that, in Beeth
oven's "Hammerklavier'' Sonata
Ohlsson had slackened his haste a little in
order to let more of the detail take its rightful
place
The "Hammerklavier"belongsto a group
of late piano works in which Beethoven ex
plored new harmonic stiuctures and bent
old forms — fugue, variation, sonata allegro
— to new ends. When he had finished the
"Hammerklavier,"Sonata Beethoven said of
it, "Now I know how to write music." This
sonata also makes immense technical de
mands on the pianist; Charles Rosen points
out that, with this work, Beethoven emphat
ically removed piano-writing from the techi
cal grasp of the amateur.
The slow movement alone lasts tor 20
minutes, and the finale is so complex that it
turns sight-reading into a nightmare. To play
these two movements through and not lose
your own, or your listener's, concentration,
while solving the thorny problems of in
terpretation, is a musical ac hievement of the
highest order.
Starting with the brilliant opening fanfare,
Ohlsson played the first movement in an
excited, headlong manner, the forward im
petus never relenting, tven in passages
where one would expect to find some re
spite — the string of descending thirds after
the abrupt switch to G-major, the "can
tabile, dolce ed espressivo bars — Ohlsson
did not abandon his assertive stance.
The Scherzo, too, was very fast, to the
point where the rapid-tire crescendo
decres* endo markings emerged as a heavily

accented downbeat. The music, which in
any case echoes the first movement ironi
cally, became tinged with the fantastic. It
may be that Ohlsson was simply adhereing
to Beethoven's own metronome markings,
which Alfred Brendel describes as "hurried,
not to say maniacally overdriven."
Of the 3rd movement Brendel writes:
'The tempo marking, 'Adagio sostenuto,
appasionato e con molto sentimento,'
stands as a warning to the performer not to
regard the anguish of the music from the
dispassionate distance of resignation." But
even this admonition from a master in
terpreter of Beethoven is not a license to let
the piano break into stifled sobs, as Ohlsson
did at the point where the movement re
turns to F-sharp minor and a high-pitched,
pleading treble line sings haltingly over
deep bass chords. Often in this movement,
episodes that have a certain floating quality
were instead produced by Ohlsson with a
sense of plowing or treading.
Ohlsson gave himself and the audience
the needed rest between the 3rd and 4th
movements, and the Largo that leds into the
concluding fugue was excellently shaped.
But the fugue itself proceeded at such a clip
that Ohlsson put himself at a disadvantage
when it came to articulating the voices
clearly. Make no mistake: the technical re
quirements of this fugue are tremendous.
The player's left hand must be as nimble in
runs as the right, he/she must be able to trill
with virtually any two fingers, and must —
using the fingers of one hand — sustain a trill
and melody simultaneously. All this while
balancing three divergent, often-clashing
fugal voices, and illuminating Beethoven's
intentions. At the tempo Ohlsson set, this
feat was an impossibility.
Ohlsson has a warm, genial presence, and
he responded to the audience's vigorous
applause with genuine pleasure.
