# Dangerfield: self-abuse as art
## 
### SID SPAETH STEVE ODELL 
Rodney Dangerfield is a sledgeham
mer comedian.
There is nothing subtle about the
machine-gunned one-liners that have
made his a mainstay of comedy for the
last 25 years.
Rodney has probably not written a
new joke in five years, but the grasp he
maintains over an audience that will
watch him wring sweat from his hand
kerchief is undeniable.
Rodney entered to an impatient
crowd that had begun to cheer his
name and immediately went to work.
"Here I am in San Carlos — whoopee."
Later in the act, he added, "Ate you
kidding, I'm here because I lost a bet.
What am I doing here? There's a lounge
in Santa Fe that wants me."
His silver-haired head and wrinkling,
sweaty skin contrasts his springy step
and non-stop antics. Rodney learned
long ago what wear-and-tear an enter
tainment career can have on a per
former, and despite his contention that
he is terribly out of shape — "I'm so fat
that when I get my shoes shined, I have
to take the guy's word for it,"and
"when I walked into a cemetary the
other day, two guys came after me with
a shovel" — he is an active performer
and is in good physical condition.
The man that "gets no respect" also
gives no respect. He is King of Sting
and Sultan of Sweat.
In between lines about his wife who
"is so fat her bathtub has stretch
marks," and his daughter who "is so
wild they put her picture in the year

book horizontally" and who "is called
Federal Express because when sho goes
to a man's apartment, she absolutely,
positively has to be there overnight,"
Rodney fires back staccato lines at over
zealous fans who try to step into his act.
Rodney uses sound sociological princi
ples in dealing with "the Morman
Tabernacle Hecklers." He singles them
out, telling them to "save your breath,
you'll need it to blow up your inflatable
date."
Rodney, who performed for 70 min
utes at the Circle Star Theater in San
Carlos last week, delighted a packed
house who came to see misery per
sonified.
"I'm half-Jewish and half-Japanese, I
got circumcised at Beni-Hana's. I went
into McDonald's the other day, they
told me I didn't deserve a break. I just
finished my first book, now I'm going to
read another one."
The pace of the show was swift as
Rodney ripped out rapid fire insult after
rapid fire insult. Watching it was like
sprinting a long-distance race, trying to
keep up with Rodney's remarks, which
spared no one, especially his wife.
"I took my wife to a dog show the
other day and she won. I took her to the
beach last weekend and somebody
asked me what I had used for bait. She's
such a bad cook, the flies pitched in to
fix the hole in the screen door. My wife
is so fat she stepped on a pay scale, a
card popped out that said, 'One at a
time.' She's so fat, her belly button has
an echo."
The only thing that delayed Rodney's

persistant attack on anyone within ear
shot was an occasional sip of water. His
biggest ovation came when he men
tioned his first movie role in "Cad
dyshack." He announced a new part in
the movie "Easy Money" due this
summer.
Rodney whirred around the circular
stage staring out at the audience with
bulging, tired eyes and constantly
pulled at his tie, which he traded to a
women from the crowd, who had dared
to go on stage with Rodney for a 10-
second kiss, complete with dip.
It wasn't until after 40 minutes that
Rodney finally thrilled the audience
with his trademark, "I tell you I don't
get no respect — no respect at all."
Rodney made it clear that he has al
ways been a loser, offering some in
sights into his miserable childhood.
"I was so ugly when I was a kid, I went
to sleep in the library and when I woke
up, a blind man was reading my face. I
was so poor when I was a kid, my rich
aunt died, and in the will I owed her
$20. When I was a kid, I worked in a pet
store, people kept asking how big I'd
get. When my uncle died, he said he
wanted me on his lap — I didn't know
he was in the electric chair."
Rodney was warmed up by Maurice
LaMarsh from Toronto, Canada, who
bills himself as "North America's
brightest young impressionist."
LaMarsh entertained for 30 minutes,
featuring an array of performers from
lohnny Carson and Peter Falk to R2-D2
and C-3PO.
