# Fallen trees: the storm continues
## 
### SID ATKINS Staff Writer 
V«l-ano<bt>r wintvf storm spawned
in (he deep Pacific barrelled through
campus yesterday, felling trees,
knocking out power and lifting the
roofs off of two trailers.
National Weather Service forecas
ter Thornton Jeffries could offer only
more gloomy news about the prog
ress of the storm. "This disturbance
has continued to slow over the
ocean. Many times when this hap
pens it merges with other storms be
hind it and picks up energy," he said.
Winds gusted to 55 mph at the San
Francisco International airport yes
terday evening, according to Jeffries.
High wind warnings were issued in
all parts of the Ray Area Yesterday.
Along the coast, residents were
alerted to the possibility of flash
floods, while winter storm warnings
were posted for the mountains.

On campus, roots were blown
from the Research Library Group
trailer and the
trailer — both near Jordan Quad. In
Manzanita Park, the wind partially
peeled the aluminum siding off of
trailer 23Z.
But it appears that trees around
campus took the worst beating from
the storm. Director of Operations
and Maintenance James Horgan es
timated that as many as 20 trees were
snapped or uprooted due to the high
winds. Here are a few of the major
occurrences:
• On Gerona Street in the faculty
ghetto, trees fell at both ends of one
block, sealing off access to about 20
homes. Maintenance crews were
working to remove the timber late
last night.
• According to Police Chief Marvin
Herrington, about six trees fell yes
terday afternoon in one area on

Olmstead Road in Escondido Village.
• Near that same area, a tree fell on
the roof of the Credit Union. Her
rington said that it did not cause
much damage.
• A huge redwood broke off at the
roots in front of Hoover annex and
took a smaller oak tree with it.
• Two trees snapped behind Ter
man Engineering Building, landing
on bikes and blocking a walkway
temporarily.
Horgan estimated that high winds
caused a total of $15,000 to $20,000
worth of damage yesterday after
noon.
In addition, power was out for an
hour and a half in some houses on
the east side of Mayfield drive, affect
ing the Delta Upsilon, Beta Theta Pi
and Columbae houses.
Horgan said that a crew of 25
would work through the night to take
care of the storm-related problems.

"Thisisaboutthefourth timethis has
happened this year. I wouldn't say
we're getting complacent, but we are
getting a little more experienced at
this," he said.
"There has been more wind and
rain this year than I've seen since
coming to Stanford," said Horgan,
who has been at Stanford for 20
years. "In a typical year, we don't
even get one of these storms."
Jeffries offered no hope for relief
from the wet and windy weather. He
said, "There are at least a half a dozen
storms that we can see right now.
There's a whole mass of them around
the international date line." The Na
tional Weather Service tracks storms
across the Pacific from as far away as
Asia, he said.
The next storm is expected to ar
rive tomorrow. "It should be about
as significant as the last one," Jeffries
said.
