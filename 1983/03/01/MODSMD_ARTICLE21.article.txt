This summer the Gutenberg Fx
press, the free shuttle service which
transports passengers and books be
tween the Stanford and UC-Berkeley
libraries, will either cut back its ser
vices or begin charging its passen
gers for rides in order to offset rising
costs of operation.
According to Joe lezukewicz, di
rector of administrative services for
the University libraries, the changes
will not go into effect until July 1.
Jezukewicz said the present pro
posals are to either cut back the
number of trips made by the shuttle
or to begin charging $2.50 for a
one-way trip. Even if this fare is
charged, Jezukewicz said, the ser
vice would be less expensive to use
than public transport or a private car.
The original funding for the
Gutenberg Express came from the
Mellon and Sloan Foundations. The
service is currently supported

equally bv Stanford and Cal, and runs
on a yearly operating budget of
$90,000 lezukewicz said the amount
of the budget cutback is sril! being
decided upon bv Stanford and Cal
officials.
Presently, the service uses two
vans which each make two round
trips a day between Stanford and Cal.
The vans, Jezukewicz said, carry 11
passengers apiece and are "filled
most of the time."
Jezukewicz estimated that about
5000 passengers use the service each
year, and that Stanford and Cal stu
dents and staff use the service
equally. The service is used not only
by those who need to use the librar
ies at the two schools, but also by
those who just want to visit the other
campus.
The changes in service will not be
made, he said, until atter a survey is
completed on users' preferences
and needs. The survey will be avail
able in Green Library through today.
