# Band, BSU push for fee assessment signatures
## 
### JEFF BIDDULPH Senior staff writer 
Members of the Leland Stanford
Junior University Marching Band
(LSJUMB) and the Black Student
Union (BSU), the only two organiza
tions denied approval last week by
the ASSU to be on 1 he fee assessment
ballot this spring, are optimistic
about their chances for appearing on
the ballot. Representatives of the two
groups said yesterday they will prob
ably be able to gather by Friday the
signatures of 20 percent of the stu
dent body which they need to appear
on the ballot.
Nonetheless, David Porter, ASSU
senator and treasurer of the BSU,
said he would try to get die senate to
approve the BSU budget at a closed
senate meeting tomorrow.
According to recent ASSU
changes, student organizations ap
proved by the senate must still turn
in petitions signed by 10 percent of
the student body — almost 1400 sig
natures — to appear on the ballot,
while those not approved need twice

that number. Thus the Band and the.
BSU need more than 2700 signatures.
Porter said the BSU has 20 to 25
people working to gather the neces
sary signatures. Ga-y Robinson,
manager of the Band, said he was
making a "massive effort" to fill the
petitions.
"This campus will be flooded with
Band people trying to get signatures
on those petitions," Robinson said.
All 14 student organizations wish
ing fee assessment funding will have
nine days to gather the signatures.
Porter said the time limitation is the
biggest problem facing the BSU.
The BSU was not approved by the
senate because it did not present its
1982-83 budget to the senate as is re
quired. The Band was denied ap
proval because senators questioned
two features on its budget — a
$20,000 road trip to Illinois and a
$7000 expense for the Band's soon
to-be-released record featuring "All
Right Now." Senators also said the
Band's budget proposal was too long
and difficult to understand.

The BSU is asking for $16,165 in fee
assessments and the Band is asking
for $38,783.
Porter said the BSU has found the
1982-83 budget and that he will at
tempt to convince the senate to con
sider it.
"The ASSU has an obligation to let
arguments be heard," Porter said.
Once the BSU introduces the re
cently located budget"it will be dif
ficult for them (other ASSU senators)
to reject the BSU then."
Robinson, however, said the AS
SU's denial of approval of the Band
was a "massive mistake." He said the
senators "don't realize the implica
tions" of the denial. "If we don't get
the signatures there won't be a band
next fall."
Robinson said the senate was in a
hurry to leave the meeting — which
had lasted four and-a-half hours
when the Band came up for approval
— and that "the senators wanted to
get the hell out of there."

The ASSU's objections to the
Band's budget were unfounded, ac
cording to Robinson, and the budget
was "the most honest budget which
we have ever put out."
Many of the senators were "out to
be assholes for a night," Robinson
said.
He added that the senate's objec
tion to the Illinois road trip ignored
the tangible benefits of such trips.
"The roadtrips help the reputation
of the University," he said. "After
alums see us they often contribute
money here. And a lot of those guys
have money."
ASSU senator Jim McGrath and
Council of Presidents member Mark
Epstein said at last week's senate
meeting that the Band had told the
ASSU their record would break even.
Robinson denied that the record
"was ever a profit-making venture."
According to Ben Langlotz, assis
tant band manager, the Band had
listed the $7000 expense as a short
run cost which it eventually expects
to make back.
