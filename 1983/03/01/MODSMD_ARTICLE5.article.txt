Reagan defends defense spending
Washington — President Reagan "came out swing
ing" for his proposed defense spending increases in a
White House meeting with the nation's governors
yesterday, but indicated that he would not actively
oppose a policy resolution the governors' association
is considering that calls for those increases to be cut
about in half over the next five years.
The president is taking that position because the
resolution, which the governors will vote on today at
the final session of their three-day winter meeting
here, also supports some reductions in domestic
spending as part of an overall blueprint for shrinking
the huge federal budget deficits projected for the
next five years.

But the president left no doubt as to his objections
to the resolution's defense plank, which calls for mili
tary spending increases of 3 to 5 percent in the next
five years instead of the estimated 10 percent increase
hike sought by the president.
"He came out swinging," Democratic Gov. Scott
Matheson of Utah, chairman of the National Gov
ernors' Association, told reporters after the meeting.
The president contended that his proposals for in
creased Pentagon outlays were "absolutely critical to
our national security," Matheson said.
Republican Gov. James Thompson of Illinois, co
sponsor with Matheson of the controversial resolu
tion, said that Reagan was even angrier about attacks
on his overall economic policies by Democratic gov
ernors at the association's opening session Sunday.

"He saw some governors on television criticizing
him as being partial to the rich and unfair to the
poor," Thompson said. "I think he is probably up to
his keister in those kind of comments."
Queen makes first speech in Calif.
Lot Angeles — Queen Elizabeth II thanked Ameri
cans for their support in last year's Falkland Island
crisis yesterday during her first public speech in a
rain-drenched California tour threatened by the
worst storm of the year.
Windy, rainy weather created some confusion
about the royal party's agenda for today, wnen they
were scheduled to yacht up the storm-battered Cali
fornia coastline to Santa Barbara.

A White House spokeswoman and a Santa Barbara
official said the queen would instead fly out of Los An
geles this morning. However, Michael Shea, the
queen's press secretary, said late yesterday that no de
cision had been made.
Bob Kallman, the Santa Barbara County Supervisor
coordinating that leg of the queen's trip, also said the
monarch would not lunch with President and Nancy
Reagan at their mountain ranch as planned, but
would dine at a local resturant.
The ranch is accessible only by helicopter or a nar
row, winding road often flooded during rains less se
vere than yesterday's downpour and Shea said "the
queen does not ride in helicopters" for safety rea
sons.
Rain has fallen on the royal party since Saturday's
arrival and the season's fiercest storm began lashing
t e California coast late yesterday, with 55-mph winds
and 25- to 30-foot waves forecast for the Santa Barbara
area.
"This will be the largest in the series" of storms
slamming California since the beginning of the year,
said Dieter Crowley, a National Weather Service fore
caster.
Yesterday, the queen and Prince Philip also walked
through rows of waving Union Jacks and American
flags on a tour of Rockwell International's space shut
tle mockup in nearby Downey, viewing a room filled
with model space shuttles before disappearing into a
complex of engineering and assembly buildings.
There, the queen briefly operated a shuttle flight
simulator and "did a very fine job," said Rockwell
spokesman Earl Blount, adding that the prince spent
three to four minutes at the controls during a sim
ulated landing approach.
Resuming her tour of the state following a gala Sun
day night dinner with Hollywood celebrities, the
queen and prince looked over a full-scale shuttle
mockup and a one-fifteenth scale model of a shuttle
ready for launch.
Several thousand Rockwell employees line the
queen's pathway through the buildings where shuttle
components are assembled waving "4000 to 5000 Brit
ish flags and a couple-thousand American flags," said
Rockwell's Richard Barton.
More aid requested for El Salvador
Washington — President Reagan has summoned
congressional leaders to the White House yesterday
morning to hear the case for immediate additional
military aid to El Salvador, administration officials said
Sunday night.
Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger, who esti
mated the additional aid requirement at $60 million,
told the House Foreign Affairs Committee last Tues
day that the money is "a matter of survival" for the El
Salvador government. He said the funds were needed
for military supplies such as ammunition and heli
copter spare parts.
Last year the administration asked Congress for
$63.3 million in fiscal 1983 military aid for El Salvador.
After the lawmakers failed to pass a foreign aid bill,
only $26 million was available under an interim spend
ing bill. Some of the monev under discussion now
would make up for this shortfall.
Weinberger indicated in his testimony that the ad
ministration probably would take $60 million in aid
from a $75 million fund for "unforeseen emer
gencies," a procedure that would not require con
gressional approval.
However, a group of church and human rights or
ganizations, the Coalition for a Nt * Foreign and Mili
tary Policy, protested Thursday that this procedure

would "purposely circumvent the authority of Con
gress."
As controversy built on Capitol Hill, administration
officials said late last week that an emergency-fund al
location was only one of several options being con
sidered. Others included a reallocation of funds from
other programs, which would require the Appropria
tions committees' approval, and a special supplemen
tal bill, requiring full congressional approval.
Regardless of which means is chosen, the request
for more money is likely to rekindle congressional
and public debate about El Salvador.
It also presents a new necessity for the adminis
tration to discuss the military and political situation
there at a time of increasing concern in Washington
about the course of the conflict.
"The situation in El Salvador is deteriorating very
rapidly,' said Rep, Michael Barnes (D-Md.), chairman
of the Latin American subcommittee of the House
Foreign Affairs Committee. "If additional military as
sistance is to be provided, it should be with stringent
conditions that policies be implemented to find a way
out of this mess."
Barnes said he meant there should be a search for a
political solution. "Just pouring more money into the
current policy doesn't make sense to me," he said.
Testifying before a House subcommittee last
Wednesday, Secretary of State George Shultz con
tinued to oppose proposals for negotiations between
the Salvadoran government and guerrilla forces in
search of a political settlement. Asked if the United
States would actively oppose such a move even if the
Salvadoran government were to be interested, Shultz
replied, "I wouldn't think it would be a good idea."
Israel compromises on withdrawal
Beirut, Lebanon — Israel over the past 10 days has
eased its conditions for pulling out of Lebanon, possi
bly setting the stage for achieving President Reagan's
goal of the early withdrawal of all foreign forces from
the country, according to Lebanese sources.
The sources, who declined to be identified, said Is
rael has tentatively agreed to a number of points, in
cluding compromises on its two main demands: nor
malization of relations and observation outposts in
southern Lebanon.
According to the sources, Israel has tentatively
agreed that it will moderate its demand to establish
and man three to five observation posts in southern
Lebanon after withdrawal of all foreign forces from
the country. It also has tentatively agreed to postpone
its insistence that the Lebanese sign a written pact
normalizing relations between the two countries
before withdrawal, the sources added.
However, in Jerusalem an official source who re
quested that his name be withheld said it was too early
to talk about the imminent conclusion of an agree
ment, reported Washington Post correspondent Ed

ward Walsh. More negotiations are necessary, the
source said.
The source suggested that Israel was willing to be
more flexible on the issue of normalization of rela
tions if it could receive "temporary arrangements"
that would amount to de facto normalization leading
to a written agreement. The Lebanese sources in
dicated this could be achieved.
Ori the issue of Israeli troops manning observation
outposts in southern Lebanon, the Israeli source's
comments showed less readiness to compromise. He
said that although U.S. envoy Philip Habib had come
directly from Beirut to Jerusalem and held a 90-
minute meeting yesterday with Foreign Minister
Yitzhak Shamir, there was no mention of a proposal
that would adequately replace all the elements of Is
rael's observation post demand. However, Lebanese
sources said a tentative compromise had already been
worked out.
After his meeting with Shamir, Habib said to re
porters: "Maybe we have a solution, but I won't tell
you."
Rapid movement toward an accord in the long
stalled troop withdrawal talks, which began Dec. 28,
has come during shuttle diplomacy by Habib and
while President Reagan and members of his Cabinet
have openly applied pressure on Israel to come to an
agreement, the sources said.
Lebanese credited Reagan with unblocking the
talks and they said they sense a marked new flexibility
by the Israelis since Ariel Sharon was removed as de
fense minister on Feb. 14.
Moshe Arens, the new Israeli defense minister, "is a
strong man and a little rude but he is a friend of Amer
ica," said one Lebanese.
The sources were unwilling to speculate on when
withdrawal might begin and they stressed that the is
sues tentatively agreed upon will not become final
until a full accord is reached.
Pope encourages Latin Americans
Vatican City — Pope John Paul II said yesterday he is
going to Central America this week "to open so many
tired hearts to the well-founded hope of a better
future."
In a pre-departure message taped in Spanish and
scheduled for broadcast in Central America last night,
the pontiff offered "a deferential salute to the author
ities and those responsible" in the eight countries he
will visit during eight days of travel beginning
Wednesday.
He said that in the course of delivering more than
30 sermons and speeches in the Central American
countries he would appear "as the supporter of the
humble, as a brother who instills trust to brothers."
"It is precisely this reality in which you live which
spurred me to plan this trip in order to be closer to
you, children of the church and of countries with
Christian roots, who suffer intensely and feel the

plague of strife, of war, of hatred, of secular injustice,
of ideological confrontations which shake the world
and which create scenes of conflict for innocent,
peaceseeking peoples," the pope said.
Without citing any particular Central American na
tion on his itenerary, the pope said he would like to
see "an efficient change, mainly in interior attitudes
and to open so many tired hearts to the well-founded
hope of a better future."
A leader of the Salvadoran opposition announced
in Mexico City yesterday that rebel guerrillas would
observe a unilateral one-day cease-fire during Pope
John Paul ll's visit to the embattled country on Sun
day.
Scandal mars Venezuelan election
Caracas, Venezuela — The collapse of Venezuela's
largest bank has exposed a history of political mis
management and corruption here that has tainted the
two dominant political parties and turned this year's
presidential election into an ugly debate over the
abuse of money and power.
The still-unfolding scandal began Nov. 29 when the
government took over operations of the Venezuelan
Workers' Bank, a specially created mortgage and
commercial operation that had been controlled by
the labor movement in partnership with the central
government. The government move dealt a resound
ing shock to Venezuela's already-troubled business
and political establishment.
About 400,000 depositors found their accounts
threatened, and construction of up to 15,000 housing
units funded by the bank reportedly was frozen, leav
ing thousands unemployed.
Now, as bank auditors, government-appointed
managers and a congressional commission have
sought to determine how the bank became insolvent,
a massive and complex pattern of mismanagement
has emerged involving the national labor confedera
tion, the opposition Allied Social Democratic Party
(known as Democratic Action) and the government.

day as the market backed away from last week's rec

rael has tentatively agreed to a number of points, in
cluding compromises on its two main demands: nor
malization of relations and observation outposts in
southern Lebanon.
According to the sources, Israel has tentatively
agreed that it will moderate its demand to establish
and man three to five observation posts in southern
Lebanon after withdrawal of all foreign forces from
the country. It also has tentatively agreed to postpone
its insistence that the Lebanese sign a written pact
normalizing relations between the two countries
before withdrawal, the sources added.
However, in Jerusalem an official source who re
quested that his name be withheld said it was too early
to talk about the imminent conclusion of an agree
ment, reported Washington Post correspondent Ed

ward Walsh. More negotiations are necessary, the
source said.
The source suggested that Israel was willing to be
more flexible on the issue of normalization of rela
tions if it could receive "temporary arrangements"
that would amount to de facto normalization leading
to a written agreement. The Lebanese sources in
dicated this could be achieved.
Ori the issue of Israeli troops manning observation
outposts in southern Lebanon, the Israeli source's
comments showed less readiness to compromise. He
said that although U.S. envoy Philip Habib had come
directly from Beirut to Jerusalem and held a 90-
minute meeting yesterday with Foreign Minister
Yitzhak Shamir, there was no mention of a proposal
that would adequately replace all the elements of Is
rael's observation post demand. However, Lebanese
sources said a tentative compromise had already been
worked out.
After his meeting with Shamir, Habib said to re
porters: "Maybe we have a solution, but I won't tell
you."
Rapid movement toward an accord in the long
stalled troop withdrawal talks, which began Dec. 28,
has come during shuttle diplomacy by Habib and
while President Reagan and members of his Cabinet
have openly applied pressure on Israel to come to an
agreement, the sources said.
Lebanese credited Reagan with unblocking the
talks and they said they sense a marked new flexibility
by the Israelis since Ariel Sharon was removed as de
fense minister on Feb. 14.
Moshe Arens, the new Israeli defense minister, "is a

Pope encourages Latin Americans
Vatican City — Pope John Paul II said yesterday he is
going to Central America this week "to open so many
tired hearts to the well-founded hope of a better
future."
In a pre-departure message taped in Spanish and
scheduled for broadcast in Central America last night,
the pontiff offered "a deferential salute to the author
ities and those responsible" in the eight countries he
will visit during eight days of travel beginning
Wednesday.
He said that in the course of delivering more than
30 sermons and speeches in the Central American
countries he would appear "as the supporter of the
humble, as a brother who instills trust to brothers."
"It is precisely this reality in which you live which
spurred me to plan this trip in order to be closer to
you, children of the church and of countries with
Christian roots, who suffer intensely and feel the

plague of strife, of war, of hatred, of secular injustice,
of ideological confrontations which shake the world
and which create scenes of conflict for innocent,
peaceseeking peoples," the pope said.
Without citing any particular Central American na
tion on his itenerary, the pope said he would like to
see "an efficient change, mainly in interior attitudes
and to open so many tired hearts to the well-founded
hope of a better future."
A leader of the Salvadoran opposition announced
in Mexico City yesterday that rebel guerrillas would
observe a unilateral one-day cease-fire during Pope
John Paul ll's visit to the embattled country on Sun
day.
Scandal mars Venezuelan election
Caracas, Venezuela — The collapse of Venezuela's
largest bank has exposed a history of political mis
management and corruption here that has tainted the
two dominant political parties and turned this year's
presidential election into an ugly debate over the
abuse of money and power.
The still-unfolding scandal began Nov. 29 when the
government took over operations of the Venezuelan
Workers' Bank, a specially created mortgage and
commercial operation that had been controlled by
the labor movement in partnership with the central
government. The government move dealt a resound
ing shock to Venezuela's already-troubled business
and political establishment.
About 400,000 depositors found their accounts
threatened, and construction of up to 15,000 housing
units funded by the bank reportedly was frozen, leav
ing thousands unemployed.
Now, as bank auditors, government-appointed
managers and a congressional commission have
sought to determine how the bank became insolvent,
a massive and complex pattern of mismanagement
has emerged involving the national labor confedera
tion, the opposition Allied Social Democratic Party
(known as Democratic Action) and the government.

Reagan defends defense spending
Washington — President Reagan "came out swing
ing" for his proposed defense spending increases in a
White House meeting with the nation's governors
yesterday, but indicated that he would not actively
oppose a policy resolution the governors' association
is considering that calls for those increases to be cut
about in half over the next five years.
The president is taking that position because the
resolution, which the governors will vote on today at
the final session of their three-day winter meeting
here, also supports some reductions in domestic
spending as part of an overall blueprint for shrinking
the huge federal budget deficits projected for the
next five years.

But the president left no doubt as to his objections
to the resolution's defense plank, which calls for mili
tary spending increases of 3 to 5 percent in the next
five years instead of the estimated 10 percent increase
hike sought by the president.
"He came out swinging," Democratic Gov. Scott
Matheson of Utah, chairman of the National Gov
ernors' Association, told reporters after the meeting.
The president contended that his proposals for in
creased Pentagon outlays were "absolutely critical to
our national security," Matheson said.
Republican Gov. James Thompson of Illinois, co
sponsor with Matheson of the controversial resolu
tion, said that Reagan was even angrier about attacks
on his overall economic policies by Democratic gov
ernors at the association's opening session Sunday.

"He saw some governors on television criticizing
him as being partial to the rich and unfair to the
poor," Thompson said. "I think he is probably up to
his keister in those kind of comments."
Queen makes first speech in Calif.
Lot Angeles — Queen Elizabeth II thanked Ameri
cans for their support in last year's Falkland Island
crisis yesterday during her first public speech in a
rain-drenched California tour threatened by the
worst storm of the year.
Windy, rainy weather created some confusion
about the royal party's agenda for today, wnen they
were scheduled to yacht up the storm-battered Cali
fornia coastline to Santa Barbara.

A White House spokeswoman and a Santa Barbara
official said the queen would instead fly out of Los An
geles this morning. However, Michael Shea, the
queen's press secretary, said late yesterday that no de
cision had been made.
Bob Kallman, the Santa Barbara County Supervisor
coordinating that leg of the queen's trip, also said the
monarch would not lunch with President and Nancy
Reagan at their mountain ranch as planned, but
would dine at a local resturant.
The ranch is accessible only by helicopter or a nar
row, winding road often flooded during rains less se
vere than yesterday's downpour and Shea said "the
queen does not ride in helicopters" for safety rea
sons.
Rain has fallen on the royal party since Saturday's
arrival and the season's fiercest storm began lashing
t e California coast late yesterday, with 55-mph winds
and 25- to 30-foot waves forecast for the Santa Barbara
area.
"This will be the largest in the series" of storms
slamming California since the beginning of the year,
said Dieter Crowley, a National Weather Service fore
caster.
Yesterday, the queen and Prince Philip also walked
through rows of waving Union Jacks and American
flags on a tour of Rockwell International's space shut
tle mockup in nearby Downey, viewing a room filled
with model space shuttles before disappearing into a
complex of engineering and assembly buildings.
There, the queen briefly operated a shuttle flight
simulator and "did a very fine job," said Rockwell
spokesman Earl Blount, adding that the prince spent
three to four minutes at the controls during a sim
ulated landing approach.
Resuming her tour of the state following a gala Sun
day night dinner with Hollywood celebrities, the
queen and prince looked over a full-scale shuttle
mockup and a one-fifteenth scale model of a shuttle
ready for launch.
Several thousand Rockwell employees line the
queen's pathway through the buildings where shuttle
components are assembled waving "4000 to 5000 Brit
ish flags and a couple-thousand American flags," said
Rockwell's Richard Barton.
More aid requested for El Salvador
Washington — President Reagan has summoned
congressional leaders to the White House yesterday
morning to hear the case for immediate additional
military aid to El Salvador, administration officials said
Sunday night.
Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger, who esti
mated the additional aid requirement at $60 million,
told the House Foreign Affairs Committee last Tues
day that the money is "a matter of survival" for the El
Salvador government. He said the funds were needed
for military supplies such as ammunition and heli
copter spare parts.
Last year the administration asked Congress for
$63.3 million in fiscal 1983 military aid for El Salvador.
After the lawmakers failed to pass a foreign aid bill,
only $26 million was available under an interim spend
ing bill. Some of the monev under discussion now
would make up for this shortfall.
Weinberger indicated in his testimony that the ad
ministration probably would take $60 million in aid
from a $75 million fund for "unforeseen emer
gencies," a procedure that would not require con
gressional approval.
However, a group of church and human rights or
ganizations, the Coalition for a Nt * Foreign and Mili
tary Policy, protested Thursday that this procedure

would "purposely circumvent the authority of Con
gress."
As controversy built on Capitol Hill, administration
officials said late last week that an emergency-fund al
location was only one of several options being con
sidered. Others included a reallocation of funds from
other programs, which would require the Appropria
tions committees' approval, and a special supplemen
tal bill, requiring full congressional approval.
Regardless of which means is chosen, the request
for more money is likely to rekindle congressional
and public debate about El Salvador.
It also presents a new necessity for the adminis
tration to discuss the military and political situation
there at a time of increasing concern in Washington
about the course of the conflict.
"The situation in El Salvador is deteriorating very
rapidly,' said Rep, Michael Barnes (D-Md.), chairman
of the Latin American subcommittee of the House
Foreign Affairs Committee. "If additional military as
sistance is to be provided, it should be with stringent
conditions that policies be implemented to find a way
out of this mess."
Barnes said he meant there should be a search for a
political solution. "Just pouring more money into the
current policy doesn't make sense to me," he said.
Testifying before a House subcommittee last
Wednesday, Secretary of State George Shultz con
tinued to oppose proposals for negotiations between
the Salvadoran government and guerrilla forces in
search of a political settlement. Asked if the United
States would actively oppose such a move even if the
Salvadoran government were to be interested, Shultz
replied, "I wouldn't think it would be a good idea."
Israel compromises on withdrawal
Beirut, Lebanon — Israel over the past 10 days has
eased its conditions for pulling out of Lebanon, possi
bly setting the stage for achieving President Reagan's
goal of the early withdrawal of all foreign forces from
the country, according to Lebanese sources.
The sources, who declined to be identified, said Is

Queen makes first speech in Calif.
Lot Angeles — Queen Elizabeth II thanked Ameri
cans for their support in last year's Falkland Island
crisis yesterday during her first public speech in a
rain-drenched California tour threatened by the
worst storm of the year.
Windy, rainy weather created some confusion
about the royal party's agenda for today, wnen they
were scheduled to yacht up the storm-battered Cali
fornia coastline to Santa Barbara.

A White House spokeswoman and a Santa Barbara
official said the queen would instead fly out of Los An
geles this morning. However, Michael Shea, the
queen's press secretary, said late yesterday that no de
cision had been made.
Bob Kallman, the Santa Barbara County Supervisor
coordinating that leg of the queen's trip, also said the
monarch would not lunch with President and Nancy
Reagan at their mountain ranch as planned, but
would dine at a local resturant.
The ranch is accessible only by helicopter or a nar
row, winding road often flooded during rains less se
vere than yesterday's downpour and Shea said "the
queen does not ride in helicopters" for safety rea
sons.
Rain has fallen on the royal party since Saturday's
arrival and the season's fiercest storm began lashing
t e California coast late yesterday, with 55-mph winds
and 25- to 30-foot waves forecast for the Santa Barbara
area.
"This will be the largest in the series" of storms
slamming California since the beginning of the year,
said Dieter Crowley, a National Weather Service fore
caster.
Yesterday, the queen and Prince Philip also walked
through rows of waving Union Jacks and American
flags on a tour of Rockwell International's space shut
tle mockup in nearby Downey, viewing a room filled
with model space shuttles before disappearing into a
complex of engineering and assembly buildings.
There, the queen briefly operated a shuttle flight
simulator and "did a very fine job," said Rockwell
spokesman Earl Blount, adding that the prince spent
three to four minutes at the controls during a sim
ulated landing approach.
Resuming her tour of the state following a gala Sun
day night dinner with Hollywood celebrities, the
queen and prince looked over a full-scale shuttle
mockup and a one-fifteenth scale model of a shuttle
ready for launch.
Several thousand Rockwell employees line the
queen's pathway through the buildings where shuttle
components are assembled waving "4000 to 5000 Brit
ish flags and a couple-thousand American flags," said
Rockwell's Richard Barton.
More aid requested for El Salvador
Washington — President Reagan has summoned
congressional leaders to the White House yesterday
morning to hear the case for immediate additional
military aid to El Salvador, administration officials said
Sunday night.
Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger, who esti
mated the additional aid requirement at $60 million,
told the House Foreign Affairs Committee last Tues
day that the money is "a matter of survival" for the El
Salvador government. He said the funds were needed
for military supplies such as ammunition and heli
copter spare parts.
Last year the administration asked Congress for
$63.3 million in fiscal 1983 military aid for El Salvador.
After the lawmakers failed to pass a foreign aid bill,
only $26 million was available under an interim spend
ing bill. Some of the monev under discussion now
would make up for this shortfall.
Weinberger indicated in his testimony that the ad
ministration probably would take $60 million in aid
from a $75 million fund for "unforeseen emer
gencies," a procedure that would not require con
gressional approval.
However, a group of church and human rights or
ganizations, the Coalition for a Nt * Foreign and Mili
tary Policy, protested Thursday that this procedure

would "purposely circumvent the authority of Con
gress."
As controversy built on Capitol Hill, administration
officials said late last week that an emergency-fund al
location was only one of several options being con
sidered. Others included a reallocation of funds from
other programs, which would require the Appropria
tions committees' approval, and a special supplemen
tal bill, requiring full congressional approval.
Regardless of which means is chosen, the request
for more money is likely to rekindle congressional
and public debate about El Salvador.
It also presents a new necessity for the adminis
tration to discuss the military and political situation
there at a time of increasing concern in Washington
about the course of the conflict.
"The situation in El Salvador is deteriorating very
rapidly,' said Rep, Michael Barnes (D-Md.), chairman
of the Latin American subcommittee of the House
Foreign Affairs Committee. "If additional military as
sistance is to be provided, it should be with stringent
conditions that policies be implemented to find a way
out of this mess."
Barnes said he meant there should be a search for a
political solution. "Just pouring more money into the
current policy doesn't make sense to me," he said.
Testifying before a House subcommittee last
Wednesday, Secretary of State George Shultz con
tinued to oppose proposals for negotiations between
the Salvadoran government and guerrilla forces in
search of a political settlement. Asked if the United
States would actively oppose such a move even if the
Salvadoran government were to be interested, Shultz
replied, "I wouldn't think it would be a good idea."
Israel compromises on withdrawal
Beirut, Lebanon — Israel over the past 10 days has
eased its conditions for pulling out of Lebanon, possi
bly setting the stage for achieving President Reagan's
goal of the early withdrawal of all foreign forces from
the country, according to Lebanese sources.
The sources, who declined to be identified, said Is
rael has tentatively agreed to a number of points, in
cluding compromises on its two main demands: nor
malization of relations and observation outposts in
southern Lebanon.
According to the sources, Israel has tentatively
agreed that it will moderate its demand to establish
and man three to five observation posts in southern
Lebanon after withdrawal of all foreign forces from
the country. It also has tentatively agreed to postpone
its insistence that the Lebanese sign a written pact
normalizing relations between the two countries
before withdrawal, the sources added.
However, in Jerusalem an official source who re
quested that his name be withheld said it was too early
to talk about the imminent conclusion of an agree
ment, reported Washington Post correspondent Ed

ward Walsh. More negotiations are necessary, the
source said.
The source suggested that Israel was willing to be
more flexible on the issue of normalization of rela
tions if it could receive "temporary arrangements"
that would amount to de facto normalization leading
to a written agreement. The Lebanese sources in
dicated this could be achieved.
Ori the issue of Israeli troops manning observation
outposts in southern Lebanon, the Israeli source's
comments showed less readiness to compromise. He
said that although U.S. envoy Philip Habib had come
directly from Beirut to Jerusalem and held a 90-
minute meeting yesterday with Foreign Minister
Yitzhak Shamir, there was no mention of a proposal
that would adequately replace all the elements of Is
rael's observation post demand. However, Lebanese
sources said a tentative compromise had already been
worked out.
After his meeting with Shamir, Habib said to re
porters: "Maybe we have a solution, but I won't tell
you."
Rapid movement toward an accord in the long
stalled troop withdrawal talks, which began Dec. 28,
has come during shuttle diplomacy by Habib and
while President Reagan and members of his Cabinet
have openly applied pressure on Israel to come to an
agreement, the sources said.
Lebanese credited Reagan with unblocking the
talks and they said they sense a marked new flexibility
by the Israelis since Ariel Sharon was removed as de
fense minister on Feb. 14.
Moshe Arens, the new Israeli defense minister, "is a
strong man and a little rude but he is a friend of Amer
ica," said one Lebanese.
The sources were unwilling to speculate on when
withdrawal might begin and they stressed that the is
sues tentatively agreed upon will not become final
until a full accord is reached.
Pope encourages Latin Americans
Vatican City — Pope John Paul II said yesterday he is
going to Central America this week "to open so many
tired hearts to the well-founded hope of a better
future."
In a pre-departure message taped in Spanish and
scheduled for broadcast in Central America last night,
the pontiff offered "a deferential salute to the author
ities and those responsible" in the eight countries he
will visit during eight days of travel beginning
Wednesday.
He said that in the course of delivering more than
30 sermons and speeches in the Central American
countries he would appear "as the supporter of the
humble, as a brother who instills trust to brothers."
"It is precisely this reality in which you live which
spurred me to plan this trip in order to be closer to
you, children of the church and of countries with
Christian roots, who suffer intensely and feel the

plague of strife, of war, of hatred, of secular injustice,
of ideological confrontations which shake the world
and which create scenes of conflict for innocent,
peaceseeking peoples," the pope said.
Without citing any particular Central American na
tion on his itenerary, the pope said he would like to
see "an efficient change, mainly in interior attitudes
and to open so many tired hearts to the well-founded
hope of a better future."
A leader of the Salvadoran opposition announced
in Mexico City yesterday that rebel guerrillas would
observe a unilateral one-day cease-fire during Pope
John Paul ll's visit to the embattled country on Sun
day.
Scandal mars Venezuelan election
Caracas, Venezuela — The collapse of Venezuela's
largest bank has exposed a history of political mis
management and corruption here that has tainted the
two dominant political parties and turned this year's
presidential election into an ugly debate over the
abuse of money and power.
The still-unfolding scandal began Nov. 29 when the
government took over operations of the Venezuelan
Workers' Bank, a specially created mortgage and
commercial operation that had been controlled by
the labor movement in partnership with the central
government. The government move dealt a resound
ing shock to Venezuela's already-troubled business
and political establishment.
About 400,000 depositors found their accounts
threatened, and construction of up to 15,000 housing
units funded by the bank reportedly was frozen, leav
ing thousands unemployed.
Now, as bank auditors, government-appointed
managers and a congressional commission have
sought to determine how the bank became insolvent,
a massive and complex pattern of mismanagement
has emerged involving the national labor confedera
tion, the opposition Allied Social Democratic Party
(known as Democratic Action) and the government.

Reagan defends defense spending
Washington — President Reagan "came out swing
ing" for his proposed defense spending increases in a
White House meeting with the nation's governors
yesterday, but indicated that he would not actively
oppose a policy resolution the governors' association
is considering that calls for those increases to be cut
about in half over the next five years.
The president is taking that position because the
resolution, which the governors will vote on today at
the final session of their three-day winter meeting
here, also supports some reductions in domestic
spending as part of an overall blueprint for shrinking
the huge federal budget deficits projected for the
next five years.

But the president left no doubt as to his objections
to the resolution's defense plank, which calls for mili
tary spending increases of 3 to 5 percent in the next
five years instead of the estimated 10 percent increase
hike sought by the president.
"He came out swinging," Democratic Gov. Scott
Matheson of Utah, chairman of the National Gov
ernors' Association, told reporters after the meeting.
The president contended that his proposals for in
creased Pentagon outlays were "absolutely critical to
our national security," Matheson said.
Republican Gov. James Thompson of Illinois, co
sponsor with Matheson of the controversial resolu
tion, said that Reagan was even angrier about attacks
on his overall economic policies by Democratic gov
ernors at the association's opening session Sunday.

"He saw some governors on television criticizing
him as being partial to the rich and unfair to the
poor," Thompson said. "I think he is probably up to
his keister in those kind of comments."

rael's observation post demand. However, Lebanese
sources said a tentative compromise had already been
worked out.
After his meeting with Shamir, Habib said to re
porters: "Maybe we have a solution, but I won't tell
you."
Rapid movement toward an accord in the long
stalled troop withdrawal talks, which began Dec. 28,
has come during shuttle diplomacy by Habib and
while President Reagan and members of his Cabinet
have openly applied pressure on Israel to come to an
agreement, the sources said.
Lebanese credited Reagan with unblocking the
talks and they said they sense a marked new flexibility
by the Israelis since Ariel Sharon was removed as de
fense minister on Feb. 14.
Moshe Arens, the new Israeli defense minister, "is a
strong man and a little rude but he is a friend of Amer
ica," said one Lebanese.
The sources were unwilling to speculate on when
withdrawal might begin and they stressed that the is
sues tentatively agreed upon will not become final
until a full accord is reached.
Pope encourages Latin Americans
Vatican City — Pope John Paul II said yesterday he is
going to Central America this week "to open so many
tired hearts to the well-founded hope of a better
future."
In a pre-departure message taped in Spanish and
scheduled for broadcast in Central America last night,
the pontiff offered "a deferential salute to the author
ities and those responsible" in the eight countries he
will visit during eight days of travel beginning
Wednesday.
He said that in the course of delivering more than
30 sermons and speeches in the Central American
countries he would appear "as the supporter of the
humble, as a brother who instills trust to brothers."
"It is precisely this reality in which you live which
spurred me to plan this trip in order to be closer to
you, children of the church and of countries with
Christian roots, who suffer intensely and feel the

plague of strife, of war, of hatred, of secular injustice,
of ideological confrontations which shake the world
and which create scenes of conflict for innocent,
peaceseeking peoples," the pope said.
Without citing any particular Central American na
tion on his itenerary, the pope said he would like to
see "an efficient change, mainly in interior attitudes
and to open so many tired hearts to the well-founded
hope of a better future."
A leader of the Salvadoran opposition announced
in Mexico City yesterday that rebel guerrillas would
observe a unilateral one-day cease-fire during Pope
John Paul ll's visit to the embattled country on Sun
day.
Scandal mars Venezuelan election
Caracas, Venezuela — The collapse of Venezuela's
largest bank has exposed a history of political mis
management and corruption here that has tainted the
two dominant political parties and turned this year's
presidential election into an ugly debate over the
abuse of money and power.
The still-unfolding scandal began Nov. 29 when the
government took over operations of the Venezuelan
Workers' Bank, a specially created mortgage and
commercial operation that had been controlled by
the labor movement in partnership with the central
government. The government move dealt a resound
ing shock to Venezuela's already-troubled business
and political establishment.
About 400,000 depositors found their accounts
threatened, and construction of up to 15,000 housing
units funded by the bank reportedly was frozen, leav
ing thousands unemployed.
Now, as bank auditors, government-appointed
managers and a congressional commission have
sought to determine how the bank became insolvent,
a massive and complex pattern of mismanagement
has emerged involving the national labor confedera
tion, the opposition Allied Social Democratic Party
(known as Democratic Action) and the government.
