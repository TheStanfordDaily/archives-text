Reagan defends defense spending
Washington — President Reagan "came out swing
ing" for his proposed defense spending increases in a
White House meeting with the nation's governors
yesterday, but indicated that he would not actively
oppose a policy resolution the governors' association
is considering that calls for those increases to be cut
about in half over the next five years.
The president is taking that position because the
resolution, which the governors will vote on today at
the final session of their three-day winter meeting
here, also supports some reductions in domestic
spending as part of an overall blueprint for shrinking
the huge federal budget deficits projected for the
next five years.

But the president left no doubt as to his objections
to the resolution's defense plank, which calls for mili
tary spending increases of 3 to 5 percent in the next
five years instead of the estimated 10 percent increase
hike sought by the president.
"He came out swinging," Democratic Gov. Scott
Matheson of Utah, chairman of the National Gov
ernors' Association, told reporters after the meeting.
The president contended that his proposals for in
creased Pentagon outlays were "absolutely critical to
our national security," Matheson said.
Republican Gov. James Thompson of Illinois, co
sponsor with Matheson of the controversial resolu
tion, said that Reagan was even angrier about attacks
on his overall economic policies by Democratic gov
ernors at the association's opening session Sunday.

"He saw some governors on television criticizing
him as being partial to the rich and unfair to the
poor," Thompson said. "I think he is probably up to
his keister in those kind of comments."
Queen makes first speech in Calif.
Lot Angeles — Queen Elizabeth II thanked Ameri
cans for their support in last year's Falkland Island
crisis yesterday during her first public speech in a
rain-drenched California tour threatened by the
worst storm of the year.
Windy, rainy weather created some confusion
about the royal party's agenda for today, wnen they
were scheduled to yacht up the storm-battered Cali
fornia coastline to Santa Barbara.

A White House spokeswoman and a Santa Barbara
official said the queen would instead fly out of Los An
geles this morning. However, Michael Shea, the
queen's press secretary, said late yesterday that no de
cision had been made.
Bob Kallman, the Santa Barbara County Supervisor
coordinating that leg of the queen's trip, also said the
monarch would not lunch with President and Nancy
Reagan at their mountain ranch as planned, but
would dine at a local resturant.
The ranch is accessible only by helicopter or a nar
row, winding road often flooded during rains less se
vere than yesterday's downpour and Shea said "the
queen does not ride in helicopters" for safety rea
sons.
