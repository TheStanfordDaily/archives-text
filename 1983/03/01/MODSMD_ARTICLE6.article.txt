## Palo Alto Commission questions University land policy 
### COLLEEN GILLARD Second in a four-part series 
The recent University-Palo
A to conflict over the Stanford
West development has in
spired discussion — and criti
cism — over what the Univer
sity is doing with its land en
dowment.
In order to compensate for
what it regards as the negative
impact of the high-density
Stanford West development,
the Palo Alto Planning Com
mission is asking the University
to help subsidize units in the
project. If the University builds
all 1275 units planned, the
commission wants hundreds
of open space acres set aside
for 51 years.
The city claims these re
quests are reasonable since the
University should help the
less-fortunate members of its
academic "family," as well as
be a good neighbor in plac
ing certain tracts of land under
a building moratorium.
The University, citing its ob
ligation to its land endowment,
contends that the city is asking
too much.
Palo Alto's attempt to re
strain the University may re
flect the problems of a city with
an annual budget of $30 million
trying to coexist with an institu
tion whose annual budget is
nearly $50 million.
Part of the University's con
cern may stem from the fact
that a large percentage of its
endowment is tied up in land.
These land assets have ena
bled the University to compete
with the better endowed Ivy
League universities, according
to Robin Hamill, director of
housing programs. Stanford is
one of the few universities in
the country which recruits fac
ulty through an offer of cheap

land on which to build a home.
This policy is causing
headaches at the housing of
fice. Hamill said the *>H lots
originally leased out tor $6000
and $10,000, are worth in sum
more than $500 million on to
day's market. The land value of
each of these lots is more than
$100,000, which means a tre
mendous windfall to faculty
homeowners. Although faculty
homeowners don't own the
land, they still sell title to the
renewable 51-year leases. And
the value of these leases corre
sponds to current local laruf
value.
The board of trustees be
came concerned about the
profits faculty members were
making, Hamill said. In discus
sing land value policy, they de
cided they did not want the
windfall situation to be re
peated. The trustees requested
the University treat its land
with the same regard as its
other investments. The Uni
versity has no authority to sub
sidize the cost of the land tor
future developments. Full
market value must be re
covered, the trustees decreed
Jack Sutorius, Palo Alto
planning commissioner, con
tested the University's con
cerns. "In no way do I suggest
that Stanford should give away
its land; what I am quarreling
with is imputing full market
value to it. The land was ac
quired at no expense. It has
cost only through being taxed
at its assessed value Kij*
is a monumental difference bt
tween its assessed and full
market value," he said.
"I have no difficulty,"
Sutorius continued, "under
standing the need to preserve
the endowment, but the anal

ogy though, of giving it away as
if it were shares of AT&T stock
is extreme. They needn't be
giving away their capital, they
should regard it as reinvesting
bd'k i r<> their own commu
nity.'
In response to arguments
such as Sutorius\ Hamill said
the University fears
speculators would capitalize
on University-subsidized un
its But the units are priced

below the market anyway,"
she added. "And we do aid
low-income home-buyers
through our Housing Assist
ance Program. HAP may bo re
garded as a pure subsidv with
$8000 tacked onto faculty
paychecks the first year and
$ (H)0 the second as additional
paylines."
This program has enabled
one buyer making less than
$20,000 a year to buy one of the

$170,000 Peter Coutts units, ac
cording to Hamill. Frank Mor
row, the University's director
of real estate, says the Peter
Coutts units are priced $30,000
to $'1) 000 below their market
value. This is the savings Mor
row's office passes on to the
buyer. Through acting as its
own contractor, the University
saves contractor's costs.
Morrow and Hamill both
contend that the University did

discuss putting a contract on
the future value ot the land
through price-controlling the
units, through insisting on a
sharp of the resale value ot th'
property or th• <>uj;n :*
negotiating the land tent ever/
year. But instead the Universitv
opted for the present free
market system as one which
leaves it with the least hassle
and best name.
However the problem is re

solved, the Housing Office is
uncomfortable about losing
control over one of the Univer
sity's most valuable resources
As Morrow said, "In the I -si in
yt-.ar-,, «obstruction tost , «
building a home haw doubled
from $20-$25 to $55-s»' \
square foot, while the houses
themselves have gone up
three-to-four times their v ilue
but the land has gone up ten
fold."

The recent University-Palo
A to conflict over the Stanford
West development has in
spired discussion — and criti
cism — over what the Univer
sity is doing with its land en
dowment.
In order to compensate for
what it regards as the negative
impact of the high-density
Stanford West development,
the Palo Alto Planning Com
mission is asking the University
to help subsidize units in the
project. If the University builds
all 1275 units planned, the
commission wants hundreds
of open space acres set aside
for 51 years.
The city claims these re
quests are reasonable since the
University should help the
less-fortunate members of its
academic "family," as well as
be a good neighbor in plac
ing certain tracts of land under
a building moratorium.
The University, citing its ob
ligation to its land endowment,
contends that the city is asking
too much.
Palo Alto's attempt to re
strain the University may re
flect the problems of a city with
an annual budget of $30 million
trying to coexist with an institu
tion whose annual budget is
nearly $50 million.
Part of the University's con
cern may stem from the fact
that a large percentage of its
endowment is tied up in land.
These land assets have ena
bled the University to compete
with the better endowed Ivy
League universities, according
to Robin Hamill, director of
housing programs. Stanford is
one of the few universities in
the country which recruits fac
ulty through an offer of cheap

land on which to build a home.
This policy is causing
headaches at the housing of
fice. Hamill said the *>H lots
originally leased out tor $6000
and $10,000, are worth in sum
more than $500 million on to
day's market. The land value of
each of these lots is more than
$100,000, which means a tre
mendous windfall to faculty
homeowners. Although faculty
homeowners don't own the
land, they still sell title to the
renewable 51-year leases. And
the value of these leases corre
sponds to current local laruf
value.
The board of trustees be
came concerned about the
profits faculty members were
making, Hamill said. In discus
sing land value policy, they de
cided they did not want the
windfall situation to be re
peated. The trustees requested
the University treat its land
with the same regard as its
other investments. The Uni
versity has no authority to sub
sidize the cost of the land tor
future developments. Full
market value must be re
covered, the trustees decreed
Jack Sutorius, Palo Alto
planning commissioner, con
tested the University's con
cerns. "In no way do I suggest
that Stanford should give away
its land; what I am quarreling
with is imputing full market
value to it. The land was ac
quired at no expense. It has
cost only through being taxed
at its assessed value Kij*
is a monumental difference bt
tween its assessed and full
market value," he said.
"I have no difficulty,"
Sutorius continued, "under
standing the need to preserve
the endowment, but the anal

ogy though, of giving it away as
if it were shares of AT&T stock
is extreme. They needn't be
giving away their capital, they
should regard it as reinvesting
bd'k i r<> their own commu
nity.'
In response to arguments
such as Sutorius\ Hamill said
the University fears
speculators would capitalize
on University-subsidized un
its But the units are priced

below the market anyway,"
she added. "And we do aid
low-income home-buyers
through our Housing Assist
ance Program. HAP may bo re
garded as a pure subsidv with
$8000 tacked onto faculty
paychecks the first year and
$ (H)0 the second as additional
paylines."
This program has enabled
one buyer making less than
$20,000 a year to buy one of the

$170,000 Peter Coutts units, ac
cording to Hamill. Frank Mor
row, the University's director
of real estate, says the Peter
Coutts units are priced $30,000
to $'1) 000 below their market
value. This is the savings Mor
