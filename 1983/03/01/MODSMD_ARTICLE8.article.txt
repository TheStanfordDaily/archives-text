## The Stanford Daily Top posts should be filled
### 
We find the University's dealings with vice
presidential posts a hit unusual. We have been
wondering about some apparently slow
decision-making; there has not been a vice
president for development since last June or a
replacement for former vice-president for pub
lic affairs Bob Rosenzweig, who announced his
intention to resign late last October.
Eleven days ago, University President Donald
Kennedy made two announcements concern
ing the state of vice-presidential affairs. A new
vice-presidential post was < reated and an acting
vice-president tor public affairs was named. We
are glad some action was taken, but we hope
permanent replacements tor the vacant spots
are announced soon.
The creation of a new vice-presidential post
came as a surprise. Kennedy explained that Uni
versity Counsel lohn Schwartz was given the
title of vice-president and general counsel be
cause "for the past several years . . . John has
functioned as a vice-president in all but name."
While we do not question the veracity of Ken
nedy's comment or Schwartz's entitlement to
the position, we wonder about the impetus for
the move. We hope the decision was made for
the reason Kennedy said rather than because
top University officials have had either a sense
of instability or too much work.
Bruce Hinchliffe, former head of the corpo
rate relations division here, has been acting
vice-president for development since Joel

Smith vacated his post last fall. Last November,
Hunchliffe said, "It'll be good to get a perma
nent V P appointed. . . .It will provide a
greater sense of stability."
At the time of Hinchliffe's comment,
Raymond Bacchetti, vice-provost for manage
ment and vice-chair of the search committee,
said Kennedy would make the appointment by
earlv winter quarter. But the committee is still at
work â€” we hope they are not at it too much
longer.
Rosenzweig s replacement will come from
within the University. That decision was made in
an attempt to speed up the selection process
and in light of the fact that a strong internal
candidate exists, according to Gerald Lieber
man, vice-provost and dean of graduate studies
and research. We are somewhat distressed that
the choice to search internally has not allowed a
successor to be named already.
Robert Freelan, who had the word before
vice-president in his title changed from "as
sociate" to "acting " two weeks ago appears
likely to be the next vice-president for public
affairs. Unless he knows something we do not,
he is probably a little anxious to hear the inter
nal search c ommittee's final decision.
We are also anxious for the two vacant vice
presidential posts to be filled so our administra
tion's top ranks are complete once again. And
we hope it will have been worth the wait.
