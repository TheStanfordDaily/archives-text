# U.S. viewed poorly in Europe
## 
### 
Some observers believe that rela
tions between the United States and
western Europe have reached 'heir
lowest point since the end ot World
War 11. Scholars and government of
ficials alike are interpreting recent
events such as the dispute over steel
exports and the opposition to the
deployment of the Pershing II and
Cruise missiles on Furopean soil as
inevitable manifestations of the pro
cess of "decoupling" — a diverging
of American and western Furopean
strategic interests.
Vice-President George Rush un
doubtedly gained firsthand knowl
edge of this reality during his recent
tour of the major capitals of western
Furope. He was given the uneasy task
of attempting to placate opposition
to the deployment ot the "euromis
siles" and to restore European confi
dence in the American defense strat
egy. Why is opposition so strong and
mistrust so widespread among our
European allies?
Non-communist Europe is attected
by what the German columnist
Wolfgang Pohrt has labelled a spirit
ot "nationalneutralismus." The his
toric opposition to the arms race by
the intellectual elites has become the
primary force of European political
idealism. In fact, Josef jofte, in a re
cent issue of The New Republic, ar
gues that many Europeans accept the
"if we could only get rid of the
weapons we will get rid of the war"
notion of strategic defense. The truth
is that our allies want to maintain in
tact the strategic nuclear umbrella
protecting the continent but don't
want to pay the increasing < osts -
both political and financial - in
volved in »his effort
Moreover, differences irise over
the interpretation ot the nnture and
dimensions ot a potential threat.
American rhetoric denouncing the

expansionist intentions of the Soviet
Union is often dismissed by the
European press and people as mod
ern McCarthvism. As the prominent
French newspaper t.c Monde points
out, although the Soviet Union's
conduct in Poland and Afghanistan
has not been ignored "the tendency
m Furope is still to hate the United
States more than the Soviet Union '
Perhaps, this is partially the result of
the memories of the 'mages of war
and destruction that arrived every
night from Vietnam in the late 1960s
and early 1970s but that don't arrive
from the mountain plains around
Kabul.
The European media often likes to
portray President Reagan as the ruth
less nuclear cowboy" seeking to
warn Europeans of the imminent at
tack of hostile forces and attempting
to convince them to increase their
defenses in order to save "Fort
Furope." This interpretation be
comes disturbing when associated
with the fact that most Europeans do
not realize that the 15 percent of GNP
that the Soviet Union spends on ar
maments is at least two or three times
more than what the average Euro
pean country devotes to similar ex
penditures.
The duplicity of standards with
which Europeans often form their
views on the United States as op
posed to the Soviet Union is the re
sult of two factors. First, Europeans
do not understand, as Alberto Ron
chey brilliantly explained in the Ita
lian daily Lu Repuhlica, the realities
of American political culture in
which parties are not strongly com
mitted to ideological and class divi
sions. They interpret the content ot
articles in the liberal press in the
United States as reflective of a di
vided America, torn by internal
squabbles over defense spending,
supply-side economics and social

security reform.
Noted Soviet scholars such as
Georgij Arbatov thrive on such mis
conceptions and exploit them to
promote even greater divisions be
tween the United States and western
Europe.
Secondly, American foreign policy
— of which defense strategy is but
one aspect — is viewed ever more
frequently as an inconsistent series
ot "band-aid" measures aimed at
preserving its individual position of
power vis-a-vis the Soviet Union.
Americans, they believe, are con
cerned with the welfare of Europe
only to the degree in which the con
tinent can act as an absorption
cushion in case of a Soviet attack.
This embedded notion of a declin
ing and divided American society has
socialist-Marxist ideological roots
arid encompasses broader con
ceptions ot the United States. As an
example, supply-side economics is
not viewed as an alternative ap
proach to economic decision
making hut rather the expression of
the will of an economic elite seeking
to pay fewer taxes and to avoid
promoting the redistribution ot
wealth. Such conceptions further
strengthen the image of an America
in which materialism and the pursuit
of wealth reign supreme.
It is disturbing to realize that these
and other similar misunderstandings
— of which Americans are equally
guilty — play such an important role
in the relations between the United
States and western Europe. Yet un
less bold steps are taken by all sides,
the Atlantic Alliance will risk becom
ing nothing more than a symbolic
monument to past power.

of wealth reign supreme.
It is disturbing to realize that these

Scratching the surface
Some observers believe that rela
tions between the United States and
western Europe have reached 'heir
lowest point since the end ot World
War 11. Scholars and government of
ficials alike are interpreting recent
events such as the dispute over steel
exports and the opposition to the
deployment of the Pershing II and
Cruise missiles on Furopean soil as
inevitable manifestations of the pro
cess of "decoupling" — a diverging
of American and western Furopean
strategic interests.
Vice-President George Rush un
doubtedly gained firsthand knowl
edge of this reality during his recent
tour of the major capitals of western
Furope. He was given the uneasy task
of attempting to placate opposition
to the deployment ot the "euromis
siles" and to restore European confi
dence in the American defense strat
egy. Why is opposition so strong and
mistrust so widespread among our
European allies?
Non-communist Europe is attected
by what the German columnist
Wolfgang Pohrt has labelled a spirit
ot "nationalneutralismus." The his
toric opposition to the arms race by
the intellectual elites has become the
primary force of European political
idealism. In fact, Josef jofte, in a re
cent issue of The New Republic, ar
gues that many Europeans accept the
"if we could only get rid of the
weapons we will get rid of the war"
notion of strategic defense. The truth
is that our allies want to maintain in
tact the strategic nuclear umbrella
protecting the continent but don't
want to pay the increasing < osts -
both political and financial - in
volved in »his effort
Moreover, differences irise over
the interpretation ot the nnture and
dimensions ot a potential threat.
