# Storms plague Bay Area

The storm-battered campus will
have to brace itself for at least five
more days of rain showers and gusty
winds.
According to Thornton Jeffries,
National Weather Service
meteorological technician, a station
ary low-pressure system out in the
Pacific Ocean is having a destabiliz
ing influence on inland weather,
causing heavy rain and strong winds.
Jeffries said the "unstable and
stormy" weather was dangerous and
that it would probably cause exten
sive damage. The rain is expected to
last through the weekend.
The campus has already been hard
hit by the unusually severe weather.
Director of Operations and Mainte
nance James Horgan estimated the
storm has already inflicted between
$15,000 and $20,000 worth of damage
so far on the University.
On Monday, the storm uprooted
and snapped as many as 20 trees,
peeled part of the aluminum siding
off of a trailer in Manzanita Park,
caused power outages on the east
side of Mayfield Drive, and ripped
the roof off of a Research Libraries
Group trailer. Yesterday, though, the
storm was much quieter.
The year-to-date rainfall total dar
matically illustrates the unusual na
ture of the weather this year: as of 8
a.m. yesterday, 23.05 inches of rain
had fallen on Palo Alto, according to
the Palo Alto Fire Department. The
average yearly total to date is only
13.77 inches.
U.S. Weather Service
meteorologist Lee Baca said already
storm-punished Californians can ex
pect evening and overnight winds up
to 40 mph or higher, and a fierce surf
packing waves of 20 feet or more.
Across the rest of Northern
California, flooding has been re
ported along many of the creeks and
highways throughout Glenn, Butte
and Tehama counties.
More than four inches of rain has
fallen since Monday night in the
mountains near Bakersfield, Calif.,
with 1 to 3 inches elsewhere.
The higher elevations of the Sierra
Range received more snow, bringing
a total accumulation in the last four
days to seven feet.

THE WINDS BLOW: More gusty winds and rain-filled skies wreaked
havoc on the Bay Area yesterday, mutilating not only homes, trees,
goalposts and street lights, but also one unkicky woman's umbrella.
