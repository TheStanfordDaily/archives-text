# Americans intrigued by British royalty
## 
### FELICIA LEE Staff writer 
For two short hours this Thursday, the
eyes and imaginations of much of the Stan
ford community will be focused upon a
quiet luncheon to be held at the home of
University President Donald Kennedy.
The honored guest at this affair will be a
woman described by the San lose Mercury
as 5-foot-4, blue-eyed and possessing a
little-publicized sense of humor. She is, of
course, Queen Elizabeth 11, the reigning
monarch of Great Britain.
The very mention of her name conjures
up an image of pomp and pageantry in the
mind of the average sweatshirt-clad stu
dent here. Although celebrities and heads
of state have visited the University before,
few have attracted as much attention and
curiosity from students and community
members as the queen.
According to Donald Stokes, who
served as head of the British Consulate in
San Francisco until 1978 and now works as
an academic writer for Stanford News and
Publication*, moro tlian 9 00
wrote letters asking to be invited to the
luncheon at Kennedy's house. In addition,
the University has received "several
hundred calls and letters"from curious
locals wanting to know where the best
places on campus would be to spot her.
One Palo Alto teacher, he said, had hoped
to bring more than 100 of her students to
campus on Thursday to catch a glimpse of
the distinguished visitor.
In contrast, he said, when then-
President Gerald Ford came to Stanford a
few years ago, some siudents called to ask
where they could see him, but his visit did
not generate the same feeling of curiosity
and intrigue which now surrounds the
queen's upcoming visit.
It may seem odd that a group of Ameri
can students would be at all interested in
thearrival of a foreign visitorwith nodirect
influence over their lives. Yet according to
Prof. Emeritus Ronald Hilton, who is af
filiated with Humanities Special Programs,
Americans' special intrigue with royalty,
particularly British royalty, has very real
historical roots.
"After a century of proclaiming America
a brave new world separated from the
British world by the Atlantic, America is
finally realizing that it finds its roots in
Britain," he said. He added that this
phenomenon is not unique to the United
States, and that countries such as Brazil
and the formerly Spanish countries in the

Americas are also coming to a closer un
derstanding of their colonial roots.
Hilton also said that Americans may also
feel they miss the institution of royalty.
The continuity of royal blood, he said, car
ries a ' sense of history which is lost in
presidential elections." In addition, he
said, the royal family "embodies certain
values whi< h we don't find in elected offi
cials." These values,' he said, could be
summed up as a sense of "being above
politics."
Students' personal reasons for their
interest in the queen's visit, however,
were somewhat simpler than Hilton's
theories. Graduate students Dan Jordan
and Cheryl Lawrence, who were among
the 200 students who wrote to Kennedy
requesting invitations to the luncheon
with the queen, said that they wanted to
mnet her because they "thought it would
be a fun thing to do." Council of Presi
dents member Volanda Townsend, one of
the lucky few students who actually will
have the opportunity to meet the queen,
said that she is looking forward to the
event as "something to tell my kids
about."
Jordan agreed with Hilton, however,

that it was the fact that a British monarch
was visiting which sparked his interest. "If
it were the Queen of Luxembourg, if there
were one, we probably wouldn't go."
As a graduate student of psychology,
Jordan was able to suggest several other
theories about why Americans are so in
trigued with royalty. The king and queen,
he said, provide a parental image for the
public which the United States does not
have. "Americans miss that kind of figure
— something a little above the ordinary,'
he said. He added that there exists the
feeling that figures of royalty, even fig
ureheads such as Queen Elizabeth, "over
look the country and take care of it
Although a large majority of the stu
dents who wanted to dine with the queen
were rejected, there is little bitterness
among those who were turned down, and
little jealousy of those who were invited.
Jordan admits that the letter he and Lawr
ence wrote was submitted "almost tongue
in cheek." Townsend said that her
dormmates were happy for her and were
actually "more excited tor me than I was"
upon hearing ot her invitation. She added
that she felt no sense of jealously from
them.
Considering the rank of the visitor in
volved, students arid University officials
seem surprisingly calm about Thursday s
events. Townsend said that although the
students invited to the luncheon were
briefed on the special protocol necessary
when dealing with royalty, they were also
told to use "common sense" to get
through the afternoon gracefully, and
were reminded that the queen would ur«
derstand that they may be ill at ease.
There was little agreement abour the
historical importance of the visit. Hilton
lauded the visit, saying that it >.bows
"Great Britain and the United States histor
ically tied in concerns about the modern
world." Stokes, on the other hand, regret
ted the fact that the queen will be spend
ing so little time on campus and that few
people except for those invited to the
luncheon will have the opportunity to see
her. For much of the campus, he said, the
visit will be "in many ways, a non-event."
Stokes, however, does not deny the ex
ceptionally high amount of interest gener
ated by the queen's visit. The queen, hi
said, is "a permanent celebrity," since her
position and popularity are stable. She will
continue to capture the interest of the
public, he said, whether its members are
"pro-queen or anti-queen."

Hilton also said that Americans may also
feel they miss the institution of royalty.
The continuity of royal blood, he said, car
ries a ' sense of history which is lost in
presidential elections." In addition, he
said, the royal family "embodies certain
values whi< h we don't find in elected offi
cials." These values,' he said, could be
summed up as a sense of "being above
politics."
Students' personal reasons for their
interest in the queen's visit, however,
were somewhat simpler than Hilton's
theories. Graduate students Dan Jordan
and Cheryl Lawrence, who were among
the 200 students who wrote to Kennedy
requesting invitations to the luncheon
with the queen, said that they wanted to
mnet her because they "thought it would
be a fun thing to do." Council of Presi
dents member Volanda Townsend, one of
the lucky few students who actually will
have the opportunity to meet the queen,
said that she is looking forward to the
event as "something to tell my kids
about."
Jordan agreed with Hilton, however,

that it was the fact that a British monarch
was visiting which sparked his interest. "If
it were the Queen of Luxembourg, if there
were one, we probably wouldn't go."
As a graduate student of psychology,
Jordan was able to suggest several other
theories about why Americans are so in
trigued with royalty. The king and queen,
he said, provide a parental image for the
public which the United States does not
have. "Americans miss that kind of figure
— something a little above the ordinary,'
he said. He added that there exists the
feeling that figures of royalty, even fig
ureheads such as Queen Elizabeth, "over
look the country and take care of it
Although a large majority of the stu
dents who wanted to dine with the queen
were rejected, there is little bitterness
among those who were turned down, and
little jealousy of those who were invited.
Jordan admits that the letter he and Lawr
ence wrote was submitted "almost tongue
in cheek." Townsend said that her
dormmates were happy for her and were
actually "more excited tor me than I was"
upon hearing ot her invitation. She added
that she felt no sense of jealously from
them.
Considering the rank of the visitor in
volved, students arid University officials
seem surprisingly calm about Thursday s
events. Townsend said that although the
students invited to the luncheon were
briefed on the special protocol necessary
when dealing with royalty, they were also
told to use "common sense" to get
through the afternoon gracefully, and
were reminded that the queen would ur«
derstand that they may be ill at ease.
There was little agreement abour the
historical importance of the visit. Hilton
lauded the visit, saying that it >.bows
"Great Britain and the United States histor
ically tied in concerns about the modern
world." Stokes, on the other hand, regret
ted the fact that the queen will be spend
ing so little time on campus and that few
people except for those invited to the
luncheon will have the opportunity to see
her. For much of the campus, he said, the
visit will be "in many ways, a non-event."
Stokes, however, does not deny the ex
ceptionally high amount of interest gener
ated by the queen's visit. The queen, hi
said, is "a permanent celebrity," since her
position and popularity are stable. She will
continue to capture the interest of the
public, he said, whether its members are
"pro-queen or anti-queen."

For two short hours this Thursday, the
eyes and imaginations of much of the Stan
ford community will be focused upon a
quiet luncheon to be held at the home of
University President Donald Kennedy.
The honored guest at this affair will be a
woman described by the San lose Mercury
as 5-foot-4, blue-eyed and possessing a
little-publicized sense of humor. She is, of
course, Queen Elizabeth 11, the reigning
monarch of Great Britain.
The very mention of her name conjures
up an image of pomp and pageantry in the
mind of the average sweatshirt-clad stu
dent here. Although celebrities and heads
of state have visited the University before,
few have attracted as much attention and
curiosity from students and community
members as the queen.
According to Donald Stokes, who
served as head of the British Consulate in
San Francisco until 1978 and now works as
an academic writer for Stanford News and
Publication*, moro tlian 9 00
wrote letters asking to be invited to the
luncheon at Kennedy's house. In addition,
the University has received "several
hundred calls and letters"from curious
locals wanting to know where the best
places on campus would be to spot her.
One Palo Alto teacher, he said, had hoped
to bring more than 100 of her students to
campus on Thursday to catch a glimpse of
the distinguished visitor.
In contrast, he said, when then-
President Gerald Ford came to Stanford a
few years ago, some siudents called to ask
where they could see him, but his visit did
not generate the same feeling of curiosity
and intrigue which now surrounds the
queen's upcoming visit.
It may seem odd that a group of Ameri
can students would be at all interested in
thearrival of a foreign visitorwith nodirect
influence over their lives. Yet according to
Prof. Emeritus Ronald Hilton, who is af
filiated with Humanities Special Programs,
Americans' special intrigue with royalty,
particularly British royalty, has very real
historical roots.
"After a century of proclaiming America
a brave new world separated from the
British world by the Atlantic, America is
finally realizing that it finds its roots in
Britain," he said. He added that this
phenomenon is not unique to the United
States, and that countries such as Brazil
