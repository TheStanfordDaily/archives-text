## The 						Stanford Daily Oil problems aren't over 
### 
After the failure of OPFC nations to reach
unified pricing or production quotas in either
Vienna or Geneva in recent weeks, significant
drops in the world benchmark price for oil are
expected. Imminent drops in world oil prices
will have an effect similar to a worldwide tax cut,
but genuine optimism must be coupled with
cautious planning.
Last week Britain and Norway, both non-
OPEC oil exporting nations, reduced their price
$3 to $30.50 per barrel. Nigeria immediately re
sponded bv cutting the price of its crude
$5.50 to $30 per barrel.
Other OPEC members, led by Saudi Arabia,
have been holding frantic meetings in order to
prevent an all out price-cutting war. The Oil
Ministers hope to set a unitorm price of $30 per
barrel, a drop of $4 from the OPEC benchmark
price. However, some poorer and economically
troubled OPEC member-nations such as Iran
are opposing the Saudis and are making a un
iform price agreement very difficult to achieve.
The recent price cuts in oil are a response to
an oil glut created by the worldwide economic
recession, lowered energy demand caused by
conservation, and an increase in the use of al
ternative energy supplies made competitive by
the high price of oil.
Economic analysts from Wall Street to Wash
ington D.C. to the Economic Ministries of the
European Economic Community have hailed
the projected $4 to $ 6 decrease in oii, though
there is some concern about its effects on the
international financial system. Experts predict
the price decline will speed worldwide eco

nomic reiovery and curtail the leverage of the
OPFC r.irt'M â€” possibly even leading to its com
plete demise, and create a bonanza for high
energy-consuming but recession-hit industries
such as transportation and utilities.
The impact on the U.S. economy should be
greatly, if not uniformly, beneficial. A $4-a
barrel drop in prices would save U.S. consum
ers about lOcents per gallon of gasoline, reduce
overall inflation by 1 percent, and greatly boost
the auto and airline industries.
Before we can celebrate with unrestricted
mirth, we must remember three things; first,
the oil glut and over-pricing was the product of
political developments in the Middle East and
panic buying among consumers. The high
did not accurately reflect market forces, but the
forced reduction in oil prices shows that those
forces cannot be ignored.
Second, in spite ofthe current glut, oil is still a
finite resource which must be carefully man
aged. Careful stewardship of energy requires
conservation and elimination of waste.
Third, if a long term perspective is to be main
tained, development of alternative fuels, espe
cially solar and synthetics, must continue to be
funded. Investment in future energy resources
should not be set aside because it has become
momentarily unprofitable or noncompetitve.
We are greatly encouraged by the immediate
economic benefits of the drop in oil prices but
we do not want to see it undermine essential
long-term planning toward an environmentally
safe world.
