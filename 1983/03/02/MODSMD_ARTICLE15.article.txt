# Where is the queen?
## 
### 
The Secret Service whispered it to the British
Consulate. And the British Consulate passed it
on to the University. The University then deliv
ered the decision to the student population. But
whatever the route, the message was still the
same. Don't let anyone know who is lunching
with the queen and for heaven's sake don't let
those Stanford students know her motorcade
route.
Why, they might line the streets like everyone
in San Diego and Los Angeles and Santa Barbara
did just to catch a glimpse of "her royalness."
The British Consulate retuseO <o release an
official list of its British guesfs, hut why did the
University follow suit? According to Marlene
Wine, special assistant to the president, it was
because the University "didn't want to release a
partial guest list, but in this instance a partial list
is better than none. After all, it's our feliuw
students that really interest us.
The secrecy that shrouds the queen's visit is
much like a plot of a grade "B" spy film with all
the characters trying to cover up the uncover
able.

While the Secret Service is to be commended
for trying to prevent chaos that might be caused
by exuberant students anxious to see the
queen, they have, we believe, only succeeded
in increasing the likelihood of its occurence.
Since everyone knows the lunch is being held at
University President Donald Kennedy's home
the chaos will now be concentrated somewhere
in the vicinity of his back lawn.
The security force need only inform curious on
lookers of the limits along the motorcade route and
M< with a minimum of fuss everyone could be af-

It's not too late. Make the motorcade route
known. Answer the question of the day. What
