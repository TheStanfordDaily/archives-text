# DoD budget process needs overhaul
## 
### 
The defense budget the President Reagan re
cently proposed to Congress shows all of the
classic Mgns of bureamratic haggling, and
hence, of bureaucrat waste. Contrary to the
repeated assertions ol secretary of Defense Cas
pa' Weinberger in Congressional testimony,
Congress could easily trim several billion dollars
from the defense budget without threatening the
ability of U.S. defense forces to protect Amer:
( a "• national interests
I Ins tht is not exi lusively or even primarily a
consequence of the exaggerated threat that
Weinberger and others in the Reagan administra
tion pen eive in the soviet Urnon. Even if Con
gress were to uri.riiic.aily accept Weinberger's
assessment ot U.S. security needs and the
threats posed to those needs by the Soviet
U- -on, it would still be possible to cut the de
tense budget and improve U.S. national security
nt »he same time through the formulation ot a
coherent and unified strategy of national cfe
tense and the pro< urrment of a structure of
forces efficiently adapted to that strategy.
Unfortunately, the bureaucratic processes
within the Department of Defense whereby
strategic and procurement decisions are made
have so far prevented the emergence of effec five
and efficient strategies and force structures for
the detense of U.S national interests.
One widely known bureaucratic phenomenon
which is as old as bureaucracy itself has clearly
had a detrimental impact on the defense budget.
This phenomenon is the process of "eruapture
ment," by whit h the person or agency in charge
of administering or regulating a bureaucracy or
an interest group ends up representing the
interests of the organization that is supposed to
be controlled.
When Weinberger was appointed secretary of
defense, he had virtually no experience with the
Defense Department and he brought a very
narrow and rigid bipolar view of international
relations to the Pentagon. He was thus perfectly
primed to he captured by the Pentagon's paroc
hial view of national interests as he sought to
inform himself of his administrative respon
sibilities. As one former secrtary of defense said
of Weinberger, "He's been taken in by the Penta
gon, the generals are in Beulah land -- anything
they want, he gives them.'

this efiect has been compounded by another
common bureaucratic problem. When bureauc
racies that want to expand their power arid "turf'
formulate their budget requests, they Ho so in
the expectation that they will not be awarded the
full amount requested because other bureauc
racies and interest groups are also competing for
limited government rune's Bureaucracies thus
present "wish lists ' as budgets so that when the
expected cutbact • occur thev will still have all of
•!he funds they a. tuallv n»'ed. When the Pentagon
presented Weinberger and the Reagan adminis
tration with its SI ,600,000,000,000 five-year wish
list, however, it received virtually everything that
it had asked for and tar more than it needed.
The other of the bureaucratic budget
game which complements this process of over
estimating the number of programs necessary to
fulfill the bureaucracy's function is the practice
of underestimating the cost of those programs so
that Congress will approve them and can later be
cajoled into providing extra funds to cover "un
expected" cost overruns
The current budget is no exception to this pat
tern. A recent study by five retired generals con
cluded that if 'he 1 cost of weapons continues to
rise as it did in *ne 19705, the Air Force will have to
reduce its weapons procurement by 30 percent
even if it gets its full budget request. This process
leaves Congress with the unenviable alternatives
of either cutting or stretching out procurement,
both of which would lead to higher unit costs
from lower scales ot production.
fhese bureaucraMi budget maneuverings are
multiplied by the fact that the Pentagon is not
simply the largest bureaucracy in the United
States, but rather four bureaucracies — the
Army, Navy, Air fori e and Marines. All four ser
vicel seek to expand their role in national de
fense and their budget appropriations, with the
result of bloated budgets and wasteful duplica
tion of weapons systems and defense roles.
In addition to causing over-sized defense ap
propriations. the multiple-bureaucracy nature of
the Pentagon hcis prevented the Defense De
partment from producing a unified and coherent
defense strategy.
The MX missile provides a case in point. De
spite all of the possible advantages of a sugges
tion fhat MX r> •,« i< si •• • mobile surface

ships, an option that somo experts believed
would provide a more survivable basing mode
for the MX at a lower cost than dense pack or
other schemes, The Ni-w Yo'k T/mei re< ently
reported that the surface ship basing option was
not receiving the serious attention that it de
served because the Air Force did not want t<> lose
control of the MX missile to the Navy.
Obviously, the security ot the United States
should not be the subject of such petty bureau
cratic infighting.
Before Congress moves to streamline the
decision-making processes of the Defense De
partment, however, it would do wf II to clean its
own house. Weinberger s challenge to the Con
gress offering to cut back appropriations for anv
wasteful defense programs that congressmen
found in their own districts was met with a
predictable and embarrassed silence. The prac
tice of fighting for pork barrel defense projects to
please home constituents and defense contra( -
tors is notoriously widespread and it is an un
conscionable source of waste <n these times ot
record budget deficits.
The outcome of the bureau* > atic struggles be
hind the current defense budg< t, if that budget is
not suitably streamlined by Congress will be less
defense than we deserve at a greater cost than wo
can afford. While it is tiue, as Pentagon officials
assert, that cuts in weapons pun urements would
probably save less than $ 1 -10 billion in the com
ing fiscal year, those same cu>s would save up to
$40 billion per year in the subsequent fiscal years,
a savings that would send a strong and clear
signal to the financial market'
It is far better, both for the economy and for
national security, that Congress should move to
streamline the defense budget now before more
money is spent on weapons systems that will
eventually have to be terminated anyway for lack
of funds.
At the same time that it moves to streamline
the defense budget, Congress should work to
streamline the faulty bureaucratic decision
making process that produced it. Ihis may be
bitter medicine for Congress and tor the Penta
gon, but it is high time to bite Uie bullet. And the

The defense budget the President Reagan re
cently proposed to Congress shows all of the
classic Mgns of bureamratic haggling, and
hence, of bureaucrat waste. Contrary to the
repeated assertions ol secretary of Defense Cas
pa' Weinberger in Congressional testimony,
Congress could easily trim several billion dollars
from the defense budget without threatening the
ability of U.S. defense forces to protect Amer:
( a "• national interests
I Ins tht is not exi lusively or even primarily a
consequence of the exaggerated threat that
Weinberger and others in the Reagan administra
tion pen eive in the soviet Urnon. Even if Con
gress were to uri.riiic.aily accept Weinberger's
assessment ot U.S. security needs and the
threats posed to those needs by the Soviet
U- -on, it would still be possible to cut the de
tense budget and improve U.S. national security
nt »he same time through the formulation ot a
coherent and unified strategy of national cfe
tense and the pro< urrment of a structure of
forces efficiently adapted to that strategy.
Unfortunately, the bureaucratic processes
within the Department of Defense whereby
strategic and procurement decisions are made
have so far prevented the emergence of effec five
and efficient strategies and force structures for
the detense of U.S national interests.
One widely known bureaucratic phenomenon
which is as old as bureaucracy itself has clearly
had a detrimental impact on the defense budget.
This phenomenon is the process of "eruapture
ment," by whit h the person or agency in charge
of administering or regulating a bureaucracy or
an interest group ends up representing the
interests of the organization that is supposed to
be controlled.
When Weinberger was appointed secretary of
defense, he had virtually no experience with the
Defense Department and he brought a very
narrow and rigid bipolar view of international
relations to the Pentagon. He was thus perfectly
primed to he captured by the Pentagon's paroc
hial view of national interests as he sought to
inform himself of his administrative respon
sibilities. As one former secrtary of defense said
of Weinberger, "He's been taken in by the Penta
gon, the generals are in Beulah land -- anything
they want, he gives them.'

this efiect has been compounded by another
common bureaucratic problem. When bureauc
racies that want to expand their power arid "turf'
formulate their budget requests, they Ho so in
the expectation that they will not be awarded the
full amount requested because other bureauc
racies and interest groups are also competing for
limited government rune's Bureaucracies thus
present "wish lists ' as budgets so that when the
expected cutbact • occur thev will still have all of
•!he funds they a. tuallv n»'ed. When the Pentagon
presented Weinberger and the Reagan adminis
tration with its SI ,600,000,000,000 five-year wish
list, however, it received virtually everything that
it had asked for and tar more than it needed.
The other of the bureaucratic budget
game which complements this process of over
estimating the number of programs necessary to
fulfill the bureaucracy's function is the practice
of underestimating the cost of those programs so
that Congress will approve them and can later be
cajoled into providing extra funds to cover "un
expected" cost overruns
The current budget is no exception to this pat
tern. A recent study by five retired generals con
cluded that if 'he 1 cost of weapons continues to
rise as it did in *ne 19705, the Air Force will have to
reduce its weapons procurement by 30 percent
even if it gets its full budget request. This process
leaves Congress with the unenviable alternatives
of either cutting or stretching out procurement,
both of which would lead to higher unit costs
from lower scales ot production.
fhese bureaucraMi budget maneuverings are
multiplied by the fact that the Pentagon is not
simply the largest bureaucracy in the United
States, but rather four bureaucracies — the
Army, Navy, Air fori e and Marines. All four ser
vicel seek to expand their role in national de
fense and their budget appropriations, with the
result of bloated budgets and wasteful duplica
tion of weapons systems and defense roles.
In addition to causing over-sized defense ap
propriations. the multiple-bureaucracy nature of
the Pentagon hcis prevented the Defense De
partment from producing a unified and coherent
defense strategy.
The MX missile provides a case in point. De
spite all of the possible advantages of a sugges
tion fhat MX r> •,« i< si •• • mobile surface

ships, an option that somo experts believed
would provide a more survivable basing mode
for the MX at a lower cost than dense pack or
other schemes, The Ni-w Yo'k T/mei re< ently
reported that the surface ship basing option was
not receiving the serious attention that it de
served because the Air Force did not want t<> lose
control of the MX missile to the Navy.
Obviously, the security ot the United States
should not be the subject of such petty bureau
cratic infighting.
Before Congress moves to streamline the
decision-making processes of the Defense De
partment, however, it would do wf II to clean its
own house. Weinberger s challenge to the Con
gress offering to cut back appropriations for anv
wasteful defense programs that congressmen
found in their own districts was met with a
