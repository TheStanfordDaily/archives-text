## Emphasize Affirmative Action 
### 
The ASSU Guest Professorship
Board of Stanford University, has re
quested from the Black American
Law Students Association (BALSA) a
comment regarding the Board's re
cent invitation to Julius Chambers
and lack Greenberg to teach a course
on Racial Discrimination and Civil
Rights at Stanford this spring — the
same course which caused such
great controversy when taught re
cently by Chambers and Greenberg
at Harvard.
We, the Stanford chapter of the
Black American Law Students Asso
ciation are experiencing, with the
rest of the nation, an affirmative ac
tion crisis and it compels us to issue
this statement. Despite the existence
of affirmative action programs in
universities for many years now,
blacks and other Third World people
are still dismally under-represented
in the university faculties across the
country. The problems which led to
the need for affirmative action nearly
two decades ago are problems today
as well. Our aim in issuing this state
ment is to confront these problems
at every level of university faculty hir
ing. And, because tenure decisions
are presently being made, it is espe
cially appropriate that we raise our
concerns now.
Stanford BAI SA is sensitive to this
clear showing that Affirmative Action
has been effectively abandoned be
cause our own law faculty suffers the
impact. There is only one Black
member of the faculty here — te
nured or otherwise — and only one
other Third World person who is not

yet tenured. It was such a gross lack
of minority law faculty as this which
prompted National BALSA (in the af
termath of the noted affirmative ac
tion campaign in Harvard Law
School) to call for a recommitment to
increasing both the number of
minority faculty and the number of
courses addressing the issues of ra
cism and racial discrimination.
Our underlying concern, there
fore, is more than a single desire tor
equal access to opportunities for
employment in educational arenas.
We are also addressing the need tor
minority input into the decisions re
garding allocation of the limited re
sources in educational institutions. It
is only proper that we participate in
determining how (and, by whom! we
are to be portrayed. Optimally, a
mechanism exists whereby the stu
dents' interests are considered and
acted on by the administration. Ac
cess to this mechanism for students
generally has been a problem at Stan
ford. Even in the situation where
such a mechanism exists, participa
tion by Black student groups has
been virtually denied.
For eight months, the Guest Pro
fessorship Board avoided considera
tion of funding for a course pro
posed by the Black Students Union
(BSU) for the spring of 1983. No
adequate explanation for this delay
was ever given. When the BSD sub
sequently made timely inquiries, the
Board responded that the proposed
course did not meet some unofficial
"criteria." Under the circumstances
which existed, this weak response
seems suspect. The Board had

thereby precluded fair participation
in the determination process by not
allowing the BSU to know what
criteria to meet and procedures to
follow in advance. The Board for
mally established and published the
criteria only after it had already
selected other professors. Such tac
tics must be condemned, for they
undermine the basic principles of af
tirmative action.
It is gravely discomforting to us to
know that the Guest Professorship
Board, through its procedurally un
fair tactics, has chosen to invite
Green berg and Chamber — the same
two teachers involved in the Harward
Law School controversy — to teach
their racial discrimination course at
Stanford, it fits too well into the
growing pattern of exclusion of the
concerns of third World people
about decision impacting greatly, if
not primarily, on Third World
people.
We find ourselves in a position
very similar to that of the Black law
students at Harvard. Under these cir
cumstances,, where a lack of com
mitment to atiirmative action and
apparent efforts by the Guest Profes
sorship Board to curtail any affirma
tive action progress have combined
to make the invirtation to Greenberg
and Chambers an objectionable one,
Stanford BALSA cannot in good con
science endorse Greenberg's and
Chambers' invitation to teach at
Stanford Universitv.
