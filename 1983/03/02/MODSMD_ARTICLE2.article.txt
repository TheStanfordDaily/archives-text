# Black groups to boycott civil rights course
## 
### JEFF BIDDULPH Senior staff writer 
The Black Student Union (BSU) and the Black Ameri
can Law Student Association (BALSA) voted this
weekend to officially oppose a course taught by two civil
rights experts which was approved by the ASSU Senate
last week. A representative of the BSUsaid yesterday the
group plans to boycott the course.
The course, "Racial Discrimination and Civil Rights,"
which would be taught by Jack Greenberg, the executive
director of the National Association for the Advance
ment of Colored People Legal Defense Fund, and Julius
Chambers, its president-counsel, met a similar boycott
when the course was taught this winter at the Harvard
Law School. Here, it will be an undergraduate course
and will discuss issues from school desegregation to
capital punishment to voting rights.
Both Greenberg and Chambers were unavailable for
comment, but Seth Linfield, director of the Guest Pro
fessorship Bureau (GPB) said Greenberg had told him
that he would not teach the course here if a student
group decided to boycott the course.
Statements released yesterday by the BSU and BALSA
listed a number of reasons for the boycott.
The BSU said that the group "was in solidarity with a
national boycott of the course by the BALSA." Harvard's
Black Law Student Association (BLSA) led the boycott of
the course there. It also claimed that the GPB had used
"divide and conquer" tactics to force black student or
ganizations into supporting the course and that the

"minority communities (here) should be consulted
when committees of the ASSU sponsor courses or ac
tivities which are of direct concern to those com
munities." The group also said that the three-week
course, which will cost $9800, is not "cost-effective."
BSU representatives could not be reached for further
comment on their statement.
Representatives from BALSA also declined to elabo
rate on the details of their statement, but, according to
the statement, the group was prompted to oppose the
course because of a "gross lack of minority law faculty"
at the Law School. The group is, therefore, calling for "a
recommitment to increasing both the number of minor
ity faculty and the number of courses addressing the
issues of racism and racial discrimination."
BALSA also said that it opposed the course because
the CPB avoided consideration of funding for a course
proposed by the BSU entitled "Africans In Transition:
the Effects of the Invasions," which is now being offered
through the SWOPSI program.
The boycott of the course at Harvard attracted national
attention when Dean of the Harvard Law School James
Vorenberg charged that the BLSA was boycotting the
course there because Creenberg is white. President of
the BLSA Muhammad Kenyatta called this claim "de
mogoguery" arid said that the dean had "played into the
hands of the most reactionary and racist elements of our
society," according to an article in the Harvard Law Re
cord.
