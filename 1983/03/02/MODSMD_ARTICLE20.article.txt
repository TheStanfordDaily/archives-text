# Club sports emphasize competition, management
## 
### SID ATKINS Staff writer 
An athlete competing in a
club sport here often receives
less attention from the Athletic
Department and other stu
dents than his or her varsity
counterpart.
Vet, as Richie Sobel, presi
dent of the Club Sports, said,
"A club sports athlete is not
necessarily second-rate."
In fact, many club sports
teams and athletes are clearly
first rate. Women's crew
placed fifth in the nationals last
year, while men's and wom
en's lacrosse each won their
respective California state ti
tles. Both sailing teams
finished in the top ten nation
ally.
Andy Ceiger, Athletic Di
rector, explained the
difference between a club and
varsity sport. "It's strictly a mat
ter of funding. Varsity sports
are totally supported, whereas
club sports are self-help be
yond administrative func
tions."
Still, many people have a dis
torted impression of the inten
sity of an athlete's commitment
to a club sports team. Margi
Fetter, captain of women's
crew, said, "A lot of people just
think of club sports as recrea
tion. But we put in four to five
hours a day and practice in the
morning and afternoon."
Ski team co-captain Jeff

Grainger echoed that concern.
"Our goal this year was to go to
nationals. We wanted people
to see that we're more than just
a country club up in the Sier
ras."
All together, there are 1300
athletes who compete in the 29
different club sports hwere
and 335 of these participate in
the martial arts. Club sports are
oen to all members of the Stan
ford community, including
graduate students, faculty, and
staff, and encompass a wide
range of activites from badmin
ton and horse polo to rugby
and soccer.
Some teams are highly com
petitive, such as the crew
teams which practice twice a
day and compete nationally.
Others, like Kenpo Karate, are
basically instructional. Many
provide students with a chance
to relax and meet people.
There are seven martial arts
in the Club Sports organiza
tion, including Judo, Aikido,
and three forms of Karate. One
member, Robin Lecount, won
the women's national title in
judo last year.
All club sports are organized
and run by the student athletes
themselves. The coaches are
generally part-time and only
help in running the team.
Scheduling, accounting, and
other administrative chores are
all handled by the team mem
bers themselves.

However, Geiger said,
"Functions of the Athletic De
partment are provided, such as
publicity, medical care, and
field preparation. But we do
not provide coaches, travel ex
penses or financial aid."
This means that many
athletes must spend a consid
erable amount of time off the
playing field fund-raising. In a
speech to the Athletic Board

last Friday, Sobel said, "Our
emphasis is on student initia
tive not only in competition,
but also in team manage
ment."
Capitalizing on their particu
lar athletic skills, many clubs
raise money by participating in
pledge per minute or mile en
durance events. For instance,
women's crew held a row-a
thon in White Plaza last week.
The ski team will enter in the
jog-a-thon, and the sailing
team even plans to hold a
sail-a-thon this spring when
they will sail around their Red
wood Shores training facilities
50 or more times.
Other methods in which
these clubs raise money are
more diverse. The men's and
women's crew teams both
clean up the stadium after the
football games, while the sail
ing team mops down Maples
after basketball games. The
Women's soccer team holds a
spring camp for local youth to
earn money.
TheClubSports Council only
has one major fund raiser —
the Harlem Globetrotters bas

ketball game — from which it
earns about $8000. In addition
to this amount, the council re
ceives $30,000 from the univer
sity General Fund distributed
through the Athletic Departm
nent, and approximately
$30,000 from ASSU fee assess
ments. All these funds are then
divided up among the indi
vidual sports in accordance
with a complex budget for
mula.
Since essentially half of Club
Sports funding comes from the
University through the Athletic
Department, and the other half
comes from the ASSU which
requires groups receiving fee
assessments to be entirely stu
dent run, the question of what
the role of each group is often
arises. Soble raised some of
the issues: "If it's a student or
ganization, what's the coach's
role in running the team? And
if its part of the athletic de
partment, then how much
should they pay?"
Sobel said the majority of the
club sports do not desire var
sity status. Currently, how
ever, the women's soccer,
crew and softball teams are
making serious efforts to
achieve that goal.
Women's soccer recently
moved closer to full varsity
status when the athletic de
partment granted the team cer
tain varsity privileges that will
go into effect next fall. Team
president Stephanie Bemis ex
plained the new status. "We're
still a club when it comes to
funding, but we'll be recog
nized as varsity in every other
way," she said.
Bemis added that varsity
status will enable the team to
compete nationally on the
NCAA level, and will be very
helpful for recruiting pur
poses.
For women's crew, which
last year placed fifth in the na
tion, it is difficult financially for
the group to remain a club
sport. Team captain Margi Fet
ter said, "Our main problem is
just financial. We've got
enough money to get by, but
we're constantly in need of

equipment. Our boats are
$10,000 a shot."
Steve Debenham, men's
crew captain, said although the
crew team competes with
mostly varsity crew teams, in
cludingthe University of Wash
ington and California, who
often have budgets as large as
$200-300,000, his group prefers
to remain a club sport. "We've
outgrown the limits of what
Club Sports has to offer in
funds, but we prefer to remain
student run."
Men's crew, which three
years ago was a varsity sport,
last year had an overall budget
of only $25,000.
According to Ceiger, two
groups — wrestling and wom
en's track and field — have in
the last few years made the
transition from club to varsity.
While some group leaders

said that managing their own
sport was beneficial and added
to team unity, others thought it
was mostly a chore.
Grainger said that fund rais
ing is a burden for the ski team.
"We train five days a week for
two hours a day and then ski
the whole weekend. We barely
have time to do that, much less
do fund-raisers," Grainger
said.
Co-captain of the Stanford
sailing team, Todd Gates, said,
"It's a pain-in-the-neck doing
the gym clean-ups, but it's al
most better in the long run.
Vou get out what you put in."
The sailing team even as a club
sport is the most travelled sail
ing team in the nation, accord
ing to Gates. This spring, the
sailing team will travel to the
East Coast to sail in regattas in
Boston and Annapolis.

COME SAIL AWAY: Last year the Stanford Sailing Team sent both
the women's and men's teams to nationals, where the men placed
11th and the women placed ninth.
An athlete competing in a
club sport here often receives
less attention from the Athletic
Department and other stu
dents than his or her varsity
counterpart.
Vet, as Richie Sobel, presi
dent of the Club Sports, said,
"A club sports athlete is not
necessarily second-rate."
In fact, many club sports
teams and athletes are clearly
first rate. Women's crew
placed fifth in the nationals last
year, while men's and wom
en's lacrosse each won their
respective California state ti
tles. Both sailing teams
finished in the top ten nation
ally.
Andy Ceiger, Athletic Di
rector, explained the
difference between a club and
varsity sport. "It's strictly a mat
ter of funding. Varsity sports
are totally supported, whereas
club sports are self-help be
yond administrative func
tions."
Still, many people have a dis
torted impression of the inten
sity of an athlete's commitment
to a club sports team. Margi
Fetter, captain of women's
crew, said, "A lot of people just
think of club sports as recrea
tion. But we put in four to five
hours a day and practice in the
morning and afternoon."
Ski team co-captain Jeff

Grainger echoed that concern.
"Our goal this year was to go to
nationals. We wanted people
to see that we're more than just
a country club up in the Sier
ras."
All together, there are 1300
athletes who compete in the 29
different club sports hwere
and 335 of these participate in
the martial arts. Club sports are
oen to all members of the Stan
ford community, including
graduate students, faculty, and
staff, and encompass a wide
range of activites from badmin
ton and horse polo to rugby
and soccer.
Some teams are highly com
petitive, such as the crew
teams which practice twice a
day and compete nationally.
Others, like Kenpo Karate, are
basically instructional. Many
provide students with a chance
to relax and meet people.
There are seven martial arts
in the Club Sports organiza
tion, including Judo, Aikido,
and three forms of Karate. One
member, Robin Lecount, won
the women's national title in
judo last year.
All club sports are organized
and run by the student athletes
themselves. The coaches are
generally part-time and only
help in running the team.
Scheduling, accounting, and
other administrative chores are
all handled by the team mem
bers themselves.

However, Geiger said,
"Functions of the Athletic De
partment are provided, such as
publicity, medical care, and
field preparation. But we do
not provide coaches, travel ex
penses or financial aid."
This means that many
athletes must spend a consid
erable amount of time off the
playing field fund-raising. In a
speech to the Athletic Board

last Friday, Sobel said, "Our
emphasis is on student initia
tive not only in competition,
but also in team manage
ment."
Capitalizing on their particu
lar athletic skills, many clubs
raise money by participating in
pledge per minute or mile en
durance events. For instance,
women's crew held a row-a
thon in White Plaza last week.
The ski team will enter in the
jog-a-thon, and the sailing
team even plans to hold a
sail-a-thon this spring when
they will sail around their Red
wood Shores training facilities
50 or more times.
Other methods in which
these clubs raise money are
more diverse. The men's and
women's crew teams both
clean up the stadium after the
football games, while the sail
ing team mops down Maples
after basketball games. The
Women's soccer team holds a
spring camp for local youth to
earn money.
TheClubSports Council only
has one major fund raiser —
the Harlem Globetrotters bas

ketball game — from which it
earns about $8000. In addition
to this amount, the council re
ceives $30,000 from the univer
sity General Fund distributed
through the Athletic Departm
nent, and approximately
$30,000 from ASSU fee assess
ments. All these funds are then
divided up among the indi
vidual sports in accordance
with a complex budget for
mula.
Since essentially half of Club
Sports funding comes from the
University through the Athletic
Department, and the other half
comes from the ASSU which
requires groups receiving fee
assessments to be entirely stu
dent run, the question of what
the role of each group is often
arises. Soble raised some of
the issues: "If it's a student or
ganization, what's the coach's
role in running the team? And
if its part of the athletic de
partment, then how much
should they pay?"
Sobel said the majority of the
club sports do not desire var
sity status. Currently, how
ever, the women's soccer,
crew and softball teams are
making serious efforts to
achieve that goal.
Women's soccer recently
moved closer to full varsity
status when the athletic de
partment granted the team cer
tain varsity privileges that will
go into effect next fall. Team
president Stephanie Bemis ex
plained the new status. "We're
still a club when it comes to
funding, but we'll be recog
nized as varsity in every other
way," she said.
Bemis added that varsity
status will enable the team to
compete nationally on the
NCAA level, and will be very
helpful for recruiting pur
poses.
For women's crew, which
last year placed fifth in the na
tion, it is difficult financially for
the group to remain a club
sport. Team captain Margi Fet
ter said, "Our main problem is
just financial. We've got
enough money to get by, but
we're constantly in need of

equipment. Our boats are
$10,000 a shot."
Steve Debenham, men's
crew captain, said although the
crew team competes with
mostly varsity crew teams, in
cludingthe University of Wash
ington and California, who
often have budgets as large as
$200-300,000, his group prefers
to remain a club sport. "We've
outgrown the limits of what
Club Sports has to offer in
funds, but we prefer to remain
student run."
Men's crew, which three
years ago was a varsity sport,
last year had an overall budget
of only $25,000.
According to Ceiger, two
groups — wrestling and wom
en's track and field — have in
the last few years made the
transition from club to varsity.
While some group leaders

said that managing their own
sport was beneficial and added
to team unity, others thought it
was mostly a chore.
Grainger said that fund rais
ing is a burden for the ski team.
"We train five days a week for
two hours a day and then ski
the whole weekend. We barely
have time to do that, much less
do fund-raisers," Grainger
said.
Co-captain of the Stanford
sailing team, Todd Gates, said,
"It's a pain-in-the-neck doing

outgrown the limits of what
Club Sports has to offer in
funds, but we prefer to remain
student run."
Men's crew, which three
years ago was a varsity sport,
last year had an overall budget
of only $25,000.
According to Ceiger, two
groups — wrestling and wom
en's track and field — have in
the last few years made the
transition from club to varsity.
While some group leaders

said that managing their own
sport was beneficial and added
to team unity, others thought it
was mostly a chore.
Grainger said that fund rais
ing is a burden for the ski team.
"We train five days a week for
two hours a day and then ski
the whole weekend. We barely
have time to do that, much less
do fund-raisers," Grainger
said.
Co-captain of the Stanford
sailing team, Todd Gates, said,
"It's a pain-in-the-neck doing
the gym clean-ups, but it's al
most better in the long run.
Vou get out what you put in."
The sailing team even as a club
sport is the most travelled sail
ing team in the nation, accord
ing to Gates. This spring, the
sailing team will travel to the
East Coast to sail in regattas in
Boston and Annapolis.
