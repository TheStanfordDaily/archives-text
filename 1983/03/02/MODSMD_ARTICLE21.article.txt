Pink lemonade
Yet another witticism from San lose
State University and the Spartan Daily.
For all practical purposes, the Daily is
just another quotidian in the pile, albeit
more current that the latest issue we've
received of, say, the Montana State
University Exponent, but for some rea
son it always catches our fancy.
Yesterday's perusal revealed that the
Spartan Daily is now featuring a column
called Around other campuses"
("campuses" is a tricky headline word;
when a proofreader is tired it may
u-s-e-s into infinity) which bears a strik
ing resemblance to a certain other col
umn we all know and, well, uh — any
way, the run-through on their wrap-up
included the following story, further
proof that the war against campus art in
all its ugly forms continues.
It seems that students at California
State University, Fullerton, prefer their
lemonade' pink rather than yellow.
' Before the semester started, the
modern art object, 'lemonade' origi
nally painted yellow, was painted
pink,'' the Daily reports.
So far no reports of anyone here try
ing to 'give Bach' or 'scale' down any of
our creations.
Nothing so permanent
Under a photograph with a cutline
reading "Two construction trailers are
now the predominant features of the
Quad,'' a story in the George Washing
ton University Hatchet reports that
there the Manzanita apartments of the
east will stay "until the National Law
Center addition is finished in two
years," according to a project director.
So far, according to the Hatchet, only
one student has complained about the
location of the trailers, which the proj
ect director took great pains to explain
was in the only practical place.
Wait 'til somebody leaves a cookie
out and the ants move in.
Speaking of yet another
Phyllis Schlatly, "anti-ERA activist and

a member of President Reagan's advi
sory board'' squared off with Harvey
Wasserman, "organizer of the No
Nukes concert and movie" on the dan
gers of nuclear armament and nuclear
power, before a Montana State Univer
sity audience in Bozeman, Feb. 23.
Announcement of this event in the
Exponent, as a matter of fact, arrived
here yesterday, so sometime next
month we should be able to tell you
what happened.
A source nowhere near the organiz
ers, participants or state, however,
notes that at least they were smart
enough not to hold this debate in
nearby Wyoming, which would have
increased the vulnerability of yet
another of Reagan's dense packs.
Stay tuned as Phyllis skips along the
college lecture circuit — next stop, Bat
tle Creek, Michigan, for a face-off with
Betty Crocker on moral implications of
gingerbread mar raisin placement.
The Royal Chronicles
I've fulfilled my obligations. I've
packed the top of this column with col
legiate antics and journalistic meander
ings. It's time to get down to business.
This column, Miss Marple, is clearly
"The case of the delayed lead."
Not a word was to be found in the
collegiate press about the arrival of Her
Majesty, the Queen of England and
Allthoseothertitles. However, there
was one newspaper which this past
week offered a lesson to all of us about
just how askew all our priorities really
are (not to be confused with a Florida
politician): The San Francisco Chroni
cle.
Forgive me for stepping out of
school, but the Chronicle's coverage of
the royal visit indeed convinced me that
little else matters this month besides
Her visit. Like manv of you, I would
guess, I began each day clutching fran
tically for the morning paper, kicking
and biting my way past a trailerful of
Elizabethophiles to find that distinctive
logo created by royal logomakers in
the Chronicle's basement so that we
the subj, uh, readers, might better find
the two or three daily front page stories
on the queen and her travels.
Why read the Daily, which has some
how managed to retain a sensible per
spective in all this hoopla and refrained
from royaliphobic deluges of at just
what angle the Queen's head needs to
be tilted when she smiles in order to
expose her gold dentalwork, and the

salty, wildlife guffaws of her husband,
best known to us from the Chronicle as
a tall, distinguished, clever pilot, de
spite the faided gold braids on his ad
miral's uniform?
Nay, give us trash.
When the royal yacht Britannia sails
up Palm Drive tomorrow, thanks to
more predicted rain tonight, I for one,
clad in my pressed Britannia jeans (This
will increase my chances of being
waved to, a tip I picked up on from a
Chronicle story that mentioned that the
Queen talked to a guy with a Union Jack
on his polo shirt, even though he wore
jeans and a blue rain slicker), plan to be
well esconced on some high point, able
to view Her Majesty on whatever secret
route the Secret Service plans to take
her. We've already ruled out the inner
quad, where the moped escort would
be ticketed, and various IRA
sympathizing, jogger-clogged side
paths.
The one bright spot in the blow by
blows on the Queen came from the
Herban Caenboy's column last Sunday,
when he quoted our Prof. William
Chace, who eloquently noted it did not
really matter whether one met the
Queen or not, since one is merely
meeting a presence, not a person.
In a nutshell, the point is that Queen
Elizabeth doesn't (and can't) really give
a bollard about any one of the millions
she meets anyway, even though she has
a soft spot for those with four legs and
post position in the Epsom Derby.
So off to the liquor store with you to
buy a bottle of red Dubonnet (the
Queen's favorite). Toast her visit in the
privacy of your own room and try to
hang on until Friday when the Chron
will no doubt have a faux pas chart list
ing all the Significant Ones invited to be
received by the Queen who acciden
tally offered their hand first; or jetset
ters who flubbed the Your Majesty/
Your Highness nomenclature; or
maybe even the academic future of
some later-deemed ill-chosen scone
baker who thoughtlessly told a Mal
vinas joke within royal earshot.
Far as I can tell, there's only one gap
in the coverage so far, a surprise, con
sidering that it would have established
once and for all whether Queen
Elizabeth is really a modern, up-to
the-minute, trendy queen.
But alas, my own digging reveals that
the royal channel switcher is prevented
by protocol from releasing the Queen's
viewing selections.
We may never know whether she saw
the final episode of MASH Monday
night, or not.
