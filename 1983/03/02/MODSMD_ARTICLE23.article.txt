## Hot and spicy (but good) at Berkeley's Siam Cuisine 
### 
SIAM CUISINE
181 University Ave.
Berkeley 548-3278
Who could ever forget that farcical football
game last November? The catastrophe at this
year's big game has generated a real loathing
toward any reference to Berzerkley or "The
Weenies." However, if you can overcome
your bad feelings, I have a restaurant that will
certainly rinse away that sour tast in your
mouth.
The name of this restaurant is Siam Cuisine,
and it is located on University Avenue in Ber
keley. Siam Cuisine is a small, family run busi
ness which has been in existence for almost
four years. The owners, Samchai Aksomboon
and his wife, are dedicated to serving high
quality food at very reasonable prices.
Usually, you don't have to make a reserva
tion at Thai-food restaurants. However, this
addage has been proven wrong: we arrived at
8:30 on Friday night and there was a 45-minute
wait. But the food at Siam Cuisine is well
worth it.
The menu offers a choice of more than 75
Thai dishes ranging from steamed rice to a
seafood combination dinner that is cooked
inside a clay pot.
We began our meal with two of my favorite
appetizers; beef sa-tay and beef Siam. Both
consist of six sticks of skewered beef which
has been pressed and charcoal broiled. The
beef sa-tay ($4.25) is marinated in coconut
milk and Thai spices, and it is served with a
tangy peanut curry sauce. The beef siam
($4.25) is similar except that it is marinated in
coriander, garlic and a special house sauce.

These are very simple appetizers, but they
both offer unusual flavors never encountered
in American cuisine. I also recommend the
fish cakes ($3.75) — spicy, deep-fried fish,
served with a peanut-cucumber sauce.
If you come in a group of three or more
people, be sure to sample one of Siam
Cuisine's five soups. Tai chicken soup,
chicken and bamboo shoots simmered in
coconut broth, cilantro, and a touch of lime
juice, sounds particularly tasty.
Siam Cuisine offers a wide selection of en
trees, ranging from mild to very hot. Un
daunted by last week's episode at another
Thai restaurant, I chose to order a hot pork
dish that was curiously called pork with sweet
basil ($4.95). WARNING: do not be deceived
by this entree. On your first bite, you may not
think that the pork is very hot. It will just have
the pleasant flavor of garlic and basil. How
ever, beware of the little green things that are
floating around in the sauce. These green
things are fresh chilies that are guaranteed to
raise your body temperature by at least 10
degrees.
If for some reason, you are not interested in
losing feeling in your mouth, you might want
to try prawns and pork in spicy chili oil ($5.45).
This medium-spicy dish is a marvelous com
bination of succulent prawns and tender
pieces of pork served with bamboo shoots,
fresh mushroom, spring onions and topped
with chili oil.
I would also recommend princess' favorite
chicken (mild) — sweet and sour chicken
served with cucumbers, sweet onions, to
matoes, sweet peppers and pineapple.

Each of these entrees offers a choice be
tween a dinner price and a la carte. For $1.60
extra, the dinner includes a bowl of soup,
steamed rice, a side order of vegetables and a
small portion of fresh fruit.
If you really like hot food, then do not pass
up the Chili Pepper Salad ($4.25). The pepper
salad is the only item on the menu with a
rating of very hot. It includes sliced,
charcoal-grilled jalapeno peppers, grilled to
matoes and red onions, mixed together with
dried shrimp powder, lime juice and nampla
— pure fire!
In addition, Siam Cuisine offers 36 different
types of beer including singha, Thai beer, and
15 varieties of wine. The choices for dessert
are limited to ice cream and coconut pudding.
Neither of these desserts are very special, al
though the pudding was tasty.
The atmosphere at Siam Cuisine is not
exactly elegant — the bar and the dining area
form one continuous room which is broken
up by a fireplace in the center. The walls are
adorned with travel posters advertising the
many wonders of Thailand, and above the bar
there is a picture of the King and Queen.
You might wonder why I am reviewing
another Thai-food restaurant, since I did on
last time. Well, to tell you the truth, I have
been wondering the same thing. I have de
cidd that someone inside The Daily is plotting
to destroy my taste buds with extra spicy food.
However, if this is the case, let me simply say
that it will never work. I love Thai-food, and
eatingat places like Siam Cuisine isa real treat
even if one has to journey into Berkeley to
enjoy it.
