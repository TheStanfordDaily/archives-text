## Card to meet struggling Wildcats 
### STEVE ODELL Senior sports writer 
Preview.
A statement giving advance
information. Foretaste,
glimpse.
Such is the definition that
Merriam Webster decided to
enlighten us with in his Second
Collegiate Edition.
In applying Webster's words
of wisdom to this preview of
Arizona, which Stanford meets
tomorrow night in a Pacific-10
Conference match-up at 8 p.m.
in the Wildcats' McKale Cen
ter, more words come to mind.
Like gloom, doom and de
spair. A foretaste might be akin
to an old tennis shoe. The only
glimpse would be into a seem
ingly bottomless pit.
UA has not won a confer
ence game all season. The
Wildcats are 3-21 overall and
0-14 in the conference under
first-year coach Ben Lindsay.
They are dead last in the con
ference in points allowed per
game, scoring margin, re
bounding margin and free
throw percentage.
The land of the sun has
turned into Dark Shadows.
But Stanford coach Tom
Davis insisted that the Wildcats
are not all that bad.
"Number one, if you look at
their record at home, it's much
better at home than it is on the
road," he said. "That's often
true of struggling ball clubs.
That's true of ourselves, al
though we're not struggling
the way Arizona is.
"But they upset San Diego
State (at the time ranked No. 18
in the nation) at home, and
they took UCLA right to the
wire at home. These are just
illustrations that show they've
got talent and they know how
to use it, and we're looking at
them as a good, strong oppo
nent.
"I'm sure they are looking
upon us as a team they can
beat."
The game is also important
as it represents a chance for
Stanford to achieve its first .500
season in 10 years. The Cardi
nal, 13-11 overall and 5-9 in the

conference, has four games
remaining with a split giving
Stanford a winning season. The
Cardinal broke a four-game
losing streak with a 77-63 vic
tory over Washington Satur
day.
Arizona is led by 6-foot-10
center Frank Smith, the top re
bounder in the league hauling
in an even eight a game, and
the number 12 scorer in the
conference with a 14.2 points
per game average.
"He's the type of player who
can really destroy you," Davis
said. "He doesn't really ham
mer you, he's kind of thin, he
finesses you. I think he's being
overlooked throughout the
league due to Arizona's re
cord."
The last time the two teams
faced each other, Stanford
squelched the Wildcats 86-69 at
Maples Pavilion. One of the
keys to the win was the Cardi
nal's coverage of Smith within
the framework of its halfcourt
zone defense. Smith, who was
effective inside when he did
get the ball, shooting 6-of-7
from the field, found the pas
ses far and few between, and
was held to 14 points.
Davis said he plans to use
similar strategy this time
around, fronting Smith from
the post with backside help
from the small forward posi
tion.
Guard Brock Brunkhorst is a
bombadeer who scored a
team-high 16 points in the
clubs' first meeting. Brun
khorst is third in the league in
assists, averaging 5.1.
There is a blend of youth and
age at starting forward, with
senior' Donald Mellon and
freshman David Haskin. Troy
Cooke has been starting at the
other guard.
There is nobody in the'
Wildcat backcourt who can
keep up with Stanford guard
Keith lones, but then again the
way the highflying Jones has
been playing lately, nobody in
the conference can. Jones has
scored 28 points in his last two
games, tying his career high,
which he set against UA.

information. Foretaste,
glimpse.
Such is the definition that
Merriam Webster decided to
enlighten us with in his Second
Collegiate Edition.
In applying Webster's words
of wisdom to this preview of
Arizona, which Stanford meets
tomorrow night in a Pacific-10
Conference match-up at 8 p.m.
in the Wildcats' McKale Cen
ter, more words come to mind.
Like gloom, doom and de
spair. A foretaste might be akin
to an old tennis shoe. The only
glimpse would be into a seem
ingly bottomless pit.
UA has not won a confer
ence game all season. The
Wildcats are 3-21 overall and
0-14 in the conference under
first-year coach Ben Lindsay.
They are dead last in the con
ference in points allowed per
game, scoring margin, re
bounding margin and free
throw percentage.
The land of the sun has
turned into Dark Shadows.
But Stanford coach Tom
Davis insisted that the Wildcats
are not all that bad.
"Number one, if you look at
their record at home, it's much
better at home than it is on the
road," he said. "That's often
true of struggling ball clubs.
That's true of ourselves, al
though we're not struggling
the way Arizona is.
"But they upset San Diego
State (at the time ranked No. 18
in the nation) at home, and
they took UCLA right to the
wire at home. These are just
illustrations that show they've
got talent and they know how
to use it, and we're looking at
them as a good, strong oppo
nent.
"I'm sure they are looking
upon us as a team they can
beat."
The game is also important
as it represents a chance for
Stanford to achieve its first .500
season in 10 years. The Cardi
nal, 13-11 overall and 5-9 in the

conference, has four games
remaining with a split giving
Stanford a winning season. The
Cardinal broke a four-game
losing streak with a 77-63 vic
tory over Washington Satur
day.
Arizona is led by 6-foot-10
center Frank Smith, the top re
bounder in the league hauling
in an even eight a game, and
the number 12 scorer in the
conference with a 14.2 points
per game average.
"He's the type of player who
can really destroy you," Davis
said. "He doesn't really ham
mer you, he's kind of thin, he
finesses you. I think he's being
overlooked throughout the
league due to Arizona's re
cord."
The last time the two teams
faced each other, Stanford
squelched the Wildcats 86-69 at
Maples Pavilion. One of the
keys to the win was the Cardi
nal's coverage of Smith within
the framework of its halfcourt
zone defense. Smith, who was
effective inside when he did
get the ball, shooting 6-of-7
from the field, found the pas
ses far and few between, and
was held to 14 points.
Davis said he plans to use
similar strategy this time
around, fronting Smith from
the post with backside help
from the small forward posi
tion.
Guard Brock Brunkhorst is a
bombadeer who scored a
team-high 16 points in the
clubs' first meeting. Brun
khorst is third in the league in
assists, averaging 5.1.
There is a blend of youth and
age at starting forward, with
senior' Donald Mellon and
freshman David Haskin. Troy
Cooke has been starting at the
other guard.
There is nobody in the'
Wildcat backcourt who can
keep up with Stanford guard
Keith lones, but then again the
way the highflying Jones has
been playing lately, nobody in
the conference can. Jones has
scored 28 points in his last two
games, tying his career high,
which he set against UA.
