After absorbing a 7-1 shel
lacking through 5!4 innings
in the first game of a make
up doubleheader on Mon
day afternoon, UCLA man
ager Gary Adams finally
found a way to stop the
Stanford Cardinal.
A quick call to the wea
ther gods produced a
downpour that drenched an
already soggy Jackie Robin
son Stadium and forced the
suspension of the ballgame.
The remainder of the sus
pended game and the post
poned second game will be
played when UCLA visits
Stanford April 15 to 17.
Brian Myers, staked to the
big lead on the strength of
home-runs by second
baseman Pete Stanicek and
center fielder Mark Davis,
was cruising toward his

fourth win of the year with a
three-hitter when the rain
began to fall.
The end result was that
the Cardinal returned home
with a spotless 1-0 Pacific-10
Conference Southern Divi
sion record and sole pos
session of first place in the
early league race.
California gave Stanford a
boost when the Bears rallied
to defeat No. 1 ranked
Arizona State 5-4 in a Sun
day game in Tempe, leaving
the Sun Devils with a 2-1
conference mark.
With the rainout of the
contests in Los Angeles and
Tuesday's game at San jose
State, the Card travels to the
University of Arizona look
ing to run their win streak to
12 games with a three game
sweep of this weekend's
series.
