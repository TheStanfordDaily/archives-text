# Revelli honored
## 
### 
Stanford junior center John
Revelli, who has been
sidelined since mid-season
with torn knee ligaments, was
named to the NCAA Division I,
District 14 Second-team All-
Star team. Coaches in the
Northwest, including North
ern California, chose the team.
"I think it's a tribute to him
on behalf of the coaches in Di
vision I," Cardinal coach Tom
Davis said. "It just tells you
what a fine player he is.
"Even though he has only
played half a season, they have
chosen to recognize him. And
certainly, I agree that he is very
deserving of it. Sometimes
with an injury, such recogni
tion isn't always there."
Two Pacific-10 players were
elected to the First-team â€”
Washington State's Steve Har
riel and Oregon State's Charlie
Sitton.
