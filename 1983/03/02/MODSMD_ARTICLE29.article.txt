ifWe're swimming with confidence
artd we're real positive,'' said head
Skip Kenney. He noted that some
shimmers have colds, so everyone is
g< tting as much rest as possible.
If Kenney cited two goals the team has
h lading into the Pac-10's. First, the
tt jm naturally wants to claim its second
st'aight conference title. Second, the
swimmers have to make their NCAA
q lalifying times to enable Stanford to
t< ke the full quota of swimmers to the
IN CAA Championships in two weeks at

Indianapolis.
Stantord should be in good shape fol
lowing its resounding defeat of Ber
keley. "The crowd was great and it was
a lot or tun," Kenney said of last week's
meÂ»'t
He wants the Pac-10s to be the next
step in the team's quest for the national
title '1 he season has been full of high
lights, so we want to go to the Pac-10s
and swim faster than before."
Kenney is confident of his squad's
chances. "If we swim well, it shouldn't
be tough," he stated.
He said he hopes to establish some
momentum heading into the NCAAs.
"We like to call it a dress rehearsal for
the NCAAs," he explained.

Stanford has never taken four divers to
'he Pac-lOs, but kenney acknowledges
that they have earned the honor.
Team spirit is very good and the levei
of enthusiasm is still quite high. "I am
pretty psyched and ready to go fast,
Moffet remarked.
Kenney felt that another plus this
year has been the student body aware

best since I've been here," Kenney said
of the student recognition. "It gives the
guys a great feeling to know that their
peers know about them."
