# Queen's lunch guests get jitters
## 
### HEATHER MILLAR 
If you're one of those invited to
"The Lunch" with Queen Elizabeth II
tomorrow, it's probably unclear
whether you should feel proud or
just plain lucky.
Actually, the correct response is
probably a little of both.
Though the complete guest list and
the method of guest selection has —
at the request of the British consulate
ofiiri aIIv romainprl nUrouHort »r>
mystery, various details have trickled
out.
According to various sources in
volved in the event, the Kennedys
divided members of the University
community into various categories:
vice presidents, deans, professors,
athletes and scholars. The names of
all those falling into the categories
were put into a hat or some other
receptacle and fished out, producing
a guest list.
The results of this effort caught
many of the guests off-guard. "I was
as shocked as anybody," said
sophomore Garin Varis, an outside
linebacker on the football team and a
shot-putter for the track team. "They

woke me up at nine in the morning
and said, 'Hi. Would you like to eat
lunch with the queen?' I said
'Sure.' "
The case of the four-member ASSU
Council of Presidents was different
from most. The administration gave
the council two tickets and told the
members to decide among them
selves. "It was an awkward situation
to put us in," said COP member
IVA--»rl< Fnctoln "I with wp Karl four
tickets, out we re grateful to havp
two."
"It's very clearwhy I was chosen,"
said Bill Massy, vice president for
business and finance. "There was a
lottery within certain categories of
the University and I was in the vice
president's category. I don't know
aboutthe metaphysics of that. I don't
know why my name came up!"
The 92 people whose names did
come up have attended one briefing
and received several mailings since
they were first notified, according to
the University spokesman Donald
Stokes, who served as British consul
general in San Francisco for 12 years.

President and Mrs. Kennedy held a
general briefing three weeks ago
covering what people should wear,
when they should show up, what
they should say and various other
trivialities of protocol.
"It seems to be beautifully or
ganized," said Madeleine Crowley,
wife of Lawrence Crowley, vice pres
ident for medical affairs. "They just
told us to sit back and have a good
time and that's what I intend to do."
Though the guests interviewed by
the Daily admitted to twinges of ex
citement and apprehension, nobody
said they were staying up nights wor
rying about the affair. The Kennedys
have planned it that way.
University spokesmen empha
sized repeatedly that the Kennedys
have gone to great lengths to plan
the affair so as to put everyone at
their ease. Mrs. Kennedyis known to
have told those who attended the
briefing that she didn't expect the
luncheon to be a dull affair . . . the
guest list is such that the conversa
tion is sure to be general and sparkl

ing."
"This is just the sort of event that
the queen and the duke of Edinburgh
are known to like," said Stokes.
"They don't like going down long
solemn lines shaking hand after
hand."
But if all they get to do is shake the
queen's hand many of the guests say
they won't be disappointed ... or
surprised.
"I'll be surprised if it will be more
than a hello," said Richard Klingler a
senior who will be studying in En
gland next year on a Rhodes schol
arship.
If she asks me about my studies, I
guess I'll just play it by ear."
"You can't go in and expect to have
a long talk with the queen. That's not
the point," said senior Bill Halter,
another Rhodes recipient.
"But if she initiated the conversa
tion, I guess I'd ask her how she's
enjoying her trip to the United
States."
According to sophomore Andy
Messing, a classics major attending
the lunch, guests are not supposed
to reveal what they discuss with the
queen. "It's kind of neat," said Mes
sing. "For once in my life, I'll have
the inside scoop."
"There are things you wouldn't

want to discuss, just as would be true
with any guest. I would assume that
wouldn't talk about anything con
troversial like the Falklands," said
Marilyn Jaedicke, wife of Business
School Dean Robert laedicke. "I'm
still working on what I'm going to
say, but several articles I've read say
that she usually starts the conversa
tion."
If they differ on what they will say
to the royal couple, all the guests said
they expect the lunch to be memora
ble.
There are just a few luncheon
guests, and Penny Purpura, wife of
Medical School Dean Dominick Pur
pura, said all have one thing in com
mon. "We're all very excited," she
said. "There is a kind of warmness
. . . a welcome. I guess that's the
essence of it."

If you're one of those invited to
"The Lunch" with Queen Elizabeth II
tomorrow, it's probably unclear
whether you should feel proud or
just plain lucky.
Actually, the correct response is
probably a little of both.
Though the complete guest list and
the method of guest selection has —
at the request of the British consulate
ofiiri aIIv romainprl nUrouHort »r>
mystery, various details have trickled
out.
According to various sources in
volved in the event, the Kennedys
divided members of the University
community into various categories:
vice presidents, deans, professors,
athletes and scholars. The names of
all those falling into the categories
were put into a hat or some other
receptacle and fished out, producing
a guest list.
The results of this effort caught
many of the guests off-guard. "I was
as shocked as anybody," said
sophomore Garin Varis, an outside
linebacker on the football team and a
shot-putter for the track team. "They

woke me up at nine in the morning
and said, 'Hi. Would you like to eat
lunch with the queen?' I said
'Sure.' "
The case of the four-member ASSU
Council of Presidents was different
from most. The administration gave
the council two tickets and told the
members to decide among them
selves. "It was an awkward situation
to put us in," said COP member
IVA--»rl< Fnctoln "I with wp Karl four
tickets, out we re grateful to havp
two."
"It's very clearwhy I was chosen,"
said Bill Massy, vice president for
business and finance. "There was a
lottery within certain categories of
the University and I was in the vice
president's category. I don't know
aboutthe metaphysics of that. I don't
know why my name came up!"
The 92 people whose names did
come up have attended one briefing
and received several mailings since
they were first notified, according to
the University spokesman Donald
Stokes, who served as British consul
general in San Francisco for 12 years.

President and Mrs. Kennedy held a
general briefing three weeks ago
covering what people should wear,
when they should show up, what
they should say and various other
trivialities of protocol.
"It seems to be beautifully or
ganized," said Madeleine Crowley,
wife of Lawrence Crowley, vice pres
ident for medical affairs. "They just
told us to sit back and have a good
time and that's what I intend to do."
Though the guests interviewed by
the Daily admitted to twinges of ex
citement and apprehension, nobody
said they were staying up nights wor
rying about the affair. The Kennedys
have planned it that way.
University spokesmen empha
sized repeatedly that the Kennedys
have gone to great lengths to plan
the affair so as to put everyone at
their ease. Mrs. Kennedyis known to
have told those who attended the
briefing that she didn't expect the
luncheon to be a dull affair . . . the
guest list is such that the conversa
tion is sure to be general and sparkl

ing."
"This is just the sort of event that
the queen and the duke of Edinburgh
are known to like," said Stokes.
"They don't like going down long
solemn lines shaking hand after
hand."
But if all they get to do is shake the
queen's hand many of the guests say
they won't be disappointed ... or
surprised.
"I'll be surprised if it will be more
than a hello," said Richard Klingler a
senior who will be studying in En
gland next year on a Rhodes schol
arship.
If she asks me about my studies, I
guess I'll just play it by ear."
"You can't go in and expect to have
a long talk with the queen. That's not
the point," said senior Bill Halter,
another Rhodes recipient.
"But if she initiated the conversa
tion, I guess I'd ask her how she's
enjoying her trip to the United
States."
According to sophomore Andy
Messing, a classics major attending
the lunch, guests are not supposed
to reveal what they discuss with the
queen. "It's kind of neat," said Mes
sing. "For once in my life, I'll have
the inside scoop."
