# Queen's lunch guests get jitters
## 
### HEATHER MILLAR 
If you're one of those invited to
"The Lunch" with Queen Elizabeth II
tomorrow, it's probably unclear
whether you should feel proud or
just plain lucky.
Actually, the correct response is
probably a little of both.
Though the complete guest list and
the method of guest selection has —
at the request of the British consulate
ofiiri aIIv romainprl nUrouHort »r>
mystery, various details have trickled
out.
According to various sources in
volved in the event, the Kennedys
divided members of the University
community into various categories:
vice presidents, deans, professors,
athletes and scholars. The names of
all those falling into the categories
were put into a hat or some other
receptacle and fished out, producing
a guest list.
The results of this effort caught
many of the guests off-guard. "I was
as shocked as anybody," said
sophomore Garin Varis, an outside
linebacker on the football team and a
shot-putter for the track team. "They

woke me up at nine in the morning
and said, 'Hi. Would you like to eat
lunch with the queen?' I said
'Sure.' "
The case of the four-member ASSU
Council of Presidents was different
from most. The administration gave
the council two tickets and told the
members to decide among them
selves. "It was an awkward situation
to put us in," said COP member
IVA--»rl< Fnctoln "I with wp Karl four
tickets, out we re grateful to havp
two."
"It's very clearwhy I was chosen,"
said Bill Massy, vice president for
business and finance. "There was a
lottery within certain categories of
the University and I was in the vice
president's category. I don't know
aboutthe metaphysics of that. I don't
know why my name came up!"
The 92 people whose names did
come up have attended one briefing
and received several mailings since
they were first notified, according to
the University spokesman Donald
Stokes, who served as British consul
general in San Francisco for 12 years.
