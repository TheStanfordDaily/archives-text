## Walker and USFL 
### 
They were going to take
their time and be the good
guys. They were going to
use their bargain-basement
ABC-TV contract to build a
following, not make money.
Ihey were going to divide
the colleges into geogra
phic zones for drafting to
keep a local following of
their players.
And they were not going
to raid the colleges for un
dergraduates, but they ac
cepted the temptation
Walker set in front of them.
The new league didn't make
many friends that day.
The transactions column
listed it as "New Jersey
signed Herschel Walker, rb,
to a three-year contract."
However, it should have
been listed under trades
because the USFL might
have traded their future for
a few glorious years of
Walker.
There were battles for
John Elway, Tom Ramsey,
Eric Dickerson and others,
but nothing disturbed the
football world more than
Walker jumping ship, and
nothing promised to
exacerbate the bidding pro
cess more than the greed of
one player who grew too big
for his britches.
The league might have
survived before the Walker
fiasco, but now the story is
coming out in bits and
pieces as Walker talks more
and more. There is plenty of
blame being passed around
but it doesn't matter who's
fault it is.
It doesn't matter that
Walker lied or that he put
himself up for auction. It
doesn't matter that Walker's
lawyer, lack Manton, pro
tects himself from being
called an "opportunist" by
saying that Walker is "the
most mature 20-year-old in
the history of this country."
The rites of spring are be
ginning in all the warm wea
ther places where, even
though it's early March, the
sun shines most of the time.
The ball players love
being in places like

Phoenix, Ariz or Sarasota,
112 la. because they < an limber
up without worrying if it is
too cold to throw.
The United States Foot
ball league opens its first
season Sunday under the
gloomiest forecast yet.
Sceptics of the league's suc
cess are multiplying with
every word out of the
mouth of Herschel Walker.
Ever since Walker admit
ted signing with the New
lersey Generals and the
USFL leaked the news to
papers like the Boston
Globe and Los Angeles
Times to make his ineligibil
ity permanent, people knew
what the new league was
going to be like.
But it wasn't originally
supposed to be like that.
This league was supposed
to be different These guys
were supposed to be doing
it right.
They were not going to
compete with the estab
lished league for the
biggest-name players be
cause bidding wars killed
the other upstart leagues.
It doesn't even matter
that the USFL broke its
promise of not signing un
dergraduates and then
leaked news of the contract
to make it permanent.
What matters is that the
league is sacrificing a future
tor a few 1983 season ticket
holders. They might have
been the good guvs, but
they broke the laws of
etiquette and, even though
the rules might be stupid,
dura lex sed est lex.
I am not one to judge the
moral consequences of
what each party might have
done, but Walker's state
ment that he had been auc
tioning himself off to the
various leagues for three
years (which takes us well
into regular season of
Georgia Bulldog football)
makes us wonder who else
has been on the dance card
of the CFL and USFL.
It might bear some look
ing into if someone can
wake up the NCAA.
