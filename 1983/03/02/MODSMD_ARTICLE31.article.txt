# Canadian track star leaves home and brings her talents to Stanford
## 
### BOB DUGONI 
More than three weeks ago, the top long
distance runners in Canada gathered in
Victoria at the national cross-country
championships. The top qualifiers in that
field will represent Canada next month at
the world championships in Gateshead,
England.
The winner ot the women's field was, of
course, a Canadian, but the winner also is
a Stanford University student. She is Ali
son Wiley, a petite freshman making big
news in the running world.
Wiley is one ot the top runners on Stan
ford's women's cross-country team which
finished second to Virginia this year in the
NCAA championships. It was the team's
only loss of the season.
When the cross-country reason ended,
Wiley gave up the hills and meadows tor
the track season, but the results have been
the same both indoors and outdoors.
At an indoor meet in Florida this year she
ran a 9:11.10 in the 3000 meters, just a
tenth of a second shy of the collegiate in
door record.
At an outdoor meet against UC-lrvine,
Wiley won the 1500 and 3000-meter races,
achieving personal best times in each race.
A native of Toronto, Canada, Wiley ini
tially had no desire to leave her homeland.
Stanford is the only university to which she
applied. She did so because she says it
combines strong athletic and academic
programs.
"It was a long way to come and I left a
very good coach behind," she said. "I had
all these worries and qualms of whether I
should come, but therejvvere just too
many good things."

The "good things,'' Wiley said, are more
quality runners, and better weather condi
tions and training. She said she needs
these to continue to improve.
Wiley has already come a long way since
she began her running career at 15 during
a family vacation. She and her sister de
cided to keep their older brother company
while he was training for his high school
season. Though she says she could not
keep up with her brother, her talent did
not go unnoticed.
"We just kept on running,' she said.
"Then the coach at my brother's high
school got interested in us and before we
knew it we were racing."
Wiley did more than just race, however.
She won consistently and soon estab
lished herself as one of the best juniors in
Canada. With this success came a desire to
compete against better runners and to
continue to improve. She decided that this
would be best facilitated in the United
States with coach Brooks lohnson.
"In Canada you tend to race the same
people over and over again," Wiley said.
There's a group of five or six you seem to
be continually racing against. Here,
there's always someone new."
But Canada is Wiley's home, and that is
the country she represented last March at
the World Cross Country Championships
in Rome when she finished 12th despite
falling down. And if Wiley competes at Los
Angles in 1984 Olympics, she plans to
again represent her homeland.
"The Olympics are always on my mind,"
she said. "I think as a Canadian I have a
much better chance than an American
would just because the quantity of quality
runners isn't as good.

"I'd love to be the best, but I think going
to the Olympics and |ust being there is my
goal. If I come in first that would be
super."
Wiley alters her running style for each
race, but prefers to be in the front because
it helps her maintain her concentration.
"If I fall behind I mentally start to lose
interest in the race and start to give in,"
she said. "If you're in front you know you
always have that chance. You can keep
fighting off those people."
Wiley has fought off her share of oppo
nents, but she is very honest about her
commitment to her sport.
"If I wasn't racing well and I wasn't one
of the top juniors in Canada I wouldn't be
out there. I think you need success and
you need it often to keep up your inter
est."
She described this success as not neces
sarily finishing a race in first place, but
rather a "success within yourself.
"Just knowing what can result if you
push yourself and the feeling you get af
terwards if you give your best is one of the
best feelings because you've done it," she
said. "It's a challenge to go out there and
beat your old times and beat someone
you've always wanted to beat."
To continue to beat her old times re
quires long hours of training, and, unlike
most "weekend" runners, these are not
hours of leisure and enjoyment.
"When I'm running I don't enjoy it at
all," she said. "All I can think about when
I'm training is when I get home. Of course
some days you have your nice days, but
those are rare. All this bit about running
with a high, I very rarely get a high."

season. Though she says she could not
keep up with her brother, her talent did
not go unnoticed.
"We just kept on running,' she said.
"Then the coach at my brother's high
school got interested in us and before we
knew it we were racing."
Wiley did more than just race, however.
She won consistently and soon estab
lished herself as one of the best juniors in
Canada. With this success came a desire to
compete against better runners and to
continue to improve. She decided that this
would be best facilitated in the United
States with coach Brooks lohnson.
"In Canada you tend to race the same
people over and over again," Wiley said.
There's a group of five or six you seem to
be continually racing against. Here,
there's always someone new."
But Canada is Wiley's home, and that is
the country she represented last March at
the World Cross Country Championships
in Rome when she finished 12th despite
falling down. And if Wiley competes at Los
Angles in 1984 Olympics, she plans to
again represent her homeland.
"The Olympics are always on my mind,"
she said. "I think as a Canadian I have a
much better chance than an American
would just because the quantity of quality
runners isn't as good.

"I'd love to be the best, but I think going
to the Olympics and |ust being there is my
goal. If I come in first that would be
super."
Wiley alters her running style for each
race, but prefers to be in the front because
it helps her maintain her concentration.
"If I fall behind I mentally start to lose
interest in the race and start to give in,"
she said. "If you're in front you know you
always have that chance. You can keep
fighting off those people."
Wiley has fought off her share of oppo
nents, but she is very honest about her
commitment to her sport.
"If I wasn't racing well and I wasn't one
of the top juniors in Canada I wouldn't be
out there. I think you need success and
you need it often to keep up your inter
est."
She described this success as not neces
sarily finishing a race in first place, but
rather a "success within yourself.
"Just knowing what can result if you
push yourself and the feeling you get af
terwards if you give your best is one of the
best feelings because you've done it," she
said. "It's a challenge to go out there and
beat your old times and beat someone
you've always wanted to beat."
To continue to beat her old times re
quires long hours of training, and, unlike
most "weekend" runners, these are not
hours of leisure and enjoyment.
"When I'm running I don't enjoy it at
all," she said. "All I can think about when
I'm training is when I get home. Of course
some days you have your nice days, but
those are rare. All this bit about running
with a high, I very rarely get a high."

More than three weeks ago, the top long
distance runners in Canada gathered in
Victoria at the national cross-country
championships. The top qualifiers in that
field will represent Canada next month at
the world championships in Gateshead,
England.
The winner ot the women's field was, of
course, a Canadian, but the winner also is
a Stanford University student. She is Ali
son Wiley, a petite freshman making big
news in the running world.
Wiley is one ot the top runners on Stan
ford's women's cross-country team which
finished second to Virginia this year in the
NCAA championships. It was the team's
only loss of the season.
When the cross-country reason ended,
Wiley gave up the hills and meadows tor
the track season, but the results have been
the same both indoors and outdoors.
At an indoor meet in Florida this year she
ran a 9:11.10 in the 3000 meters, just a
tenth of a second shy of the collegiate in
door record.
At an outdoor meet against UC-lrvine,
Wiley won the 1500 and 3000-meter races,
achieving personal best times in each race.
A native of Toronto, Canada, Wiley ini
tially had no desire to leave her homeland.
Stanford is the only university to which she
applied. She did so because she says it
combines strong athletic and academic
programs.
"It was a long way to come and I left a
very good coach behind," she said. "I had
all these worries and qualms of whether I
should come, but therejvvere just too
many good things."

The "good things,'' Wiley said, are more
quality runners, and better weather condi
tions and training. She said she needs
these to continue to improve.
Wiley has already come a long way since
she began her running career at 15 during
a family vacation. She and her sister de
cided to keep their older brother company
while he was training for his high school
season. Though she says she could not
keep up with her brother, her talent did
not go unnoticed.
"We just kept on running,' she said.
