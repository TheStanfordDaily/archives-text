NBA issued strike threat
New York — In a stormy meeting that
lasted just 24 minutes, the National
Basketball Association players' union
formally notified the league Tuesday
that it will strike April 2 unless a new la
bor contract is reached before that
date.
Larry Fleisher, general counsel forthe
players' association, and Bob Lanier of
the Milwaukee Bucks, the union presi
dent, delivered the deadline to the NBA
negotiators.
"It was a very short meeting in which
we discussed philosophical dif
ferences,"Fleisher said. "Philosophical
ly, we are as far apart as Los Angeles is to
New York."
NBA Commissioner Larry O'Brien
and David Stern, the NBA's vice presi
dent for business and legal affairs, said
the strike threat effectively ended Tues
day's talks and that no new talks are
scheduled.
Fleisher said part of the dispute is an
attempt by the league to alter the free
agent rights of the players.
"It is the league's desire to take away
things we fought for for so many years,"
he said. "Give-backs is one point. More
important is their attempt to change the
system whereby a free agent at the end
of his contract is free to negotiate with
23 teams. They want to limit that."
On Monday in Chicago, a special
committee met to consider the prob
lem of troubled franchises. The com

mittee discussed the possible elimina
tion of five teams which are struggling
financially.
The Denver Nuggets, who at one
point last season were reported con
sidering a merger with the Utah Jazz,
said they aren't among the five now in
danger of folding.
Spring training opens
As the major league baseball camps
officially opened, several veteran
players found themselves in new lo
cales — or in new positions.
The most notable changes involved
Steve Garvey and Don Sutton, a pair of
former Dodgers who are beginning this
season with new teams, and Bob
Horner and Jack Clark, who will experi
ment at different positions.
All major league players were re
quired to report by today, with the ex
hibition games beginning on Saturday.
Garvey arrived in the San Diego Padres'
training camp at Yuma, Ariz., while Sut
ton reported to the Milwaukee
Brewers' base in Sun City.
"It's like my rookie year in 1970," said
Garvey, 34, who signed with the Padres
as a free agent during the off-season.
"The excitement is there, the challenge
is there."
The right uniform wasn't, however:
the No. 6 uniform supplied him had his
name spelled G-R-A-V-E-V.
Sutton, who has won 258 games in 17
major league seasons, is aiming at win
ning 300, though he has set no goals for
this season.
The Baltimore Orioles have arranged
for rain insurance for the entire home
portion of their 1983 schedule. The
team estimates it lost about $1 million in
revenue after seven postponements last
season. So Lloyds of London is provid
ing the insurance.

There are 18 teams training in Florida
and seven in Arizona. The California
Angels train at Palm Springs, Calif.
