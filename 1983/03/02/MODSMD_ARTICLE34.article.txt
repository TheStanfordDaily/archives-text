# Campus gets 1700-pound bird
## 
### KATHY OLMSTED Senior staff writer 
Workers yesterday installed and secured the latest
addition to the sculptural bestiary here — a 1700-lb.,
seven foot bronze bird by Spanish-born artist Joan Miro
was caretully placed in front of Annenberg Auditorium
yesterday afternoon.
The sculpture, titled "Oiseau" (the French word tor
bird), was donated by-Madeleine Haas Russell of San
Francisco, whose foundation has made other generous
contributions to the University in the past.
The sculpture was recommended tor purchase by Art
FHistory Prof. Albert Elsen at the donor's invitation, ac
cording to Elsen. Elsen said he chose the piece because it
represents a "very different kind of art than we have on
campus" and was sculpted by one of the "very finest
modern artists."
In addition, "Oiseau" is durable, cheerful and amus
ing — especially when compared to the "commemora
tive, morbid" older art forms, Elsen said. The sculpture
has no allegorical significance, according to Elsen, and is
simply a "creature of the artist's imagination."
Elsen pointed out that the campus already has the
"makings of a bestiary" — a sculptured or painted group
of real or imaginary animals — with the sphinxes on the
Stanford Mausoleum and the griffins guarding the entr
ance to the Athletic Department. But Elsen denied the
University is starting a trend towards acquiring animals;
the sculptural acquisitions depend on the donors' pref
erences and the available sculptures, he said.
Elsen said the sunken plaza in front of the Cummings
Art Building was chosen to exhibit the st ulpture because
it is a "marvelous space" seen by close to 1000 students a
day, and because the small area provides an appropri
ately intimate setting for the bird.
"Oiseau" represents a "major addition to a program
that is getting stronger all the time," Elsen said, adding
that the University is attempting to "continue a tradition
begun by the Stanfords of extensive sculpture on cam
pus."
Miro, 89, is considered one of the world's greatest

living artists. He has been making sculptures for more
than 50 years, and was an important Surrealist painter in
the 1920s and 19305. Much of his sculptural activity has
come in the last 15 years.
The artist is known for his joyful, uplifting sculptures,
and for his playful attitude towards his art. "Oiseau was
installed directly on the pavement in front of Annenberg
because the artist dislikes having sculpture displayed on
a conventional pedestal, Elsen said.
The stylized bird was picked up at the San Francisco
airport warehouse yesterday by the contactor hired to
install the sculpture, according to Project Manager
Olivier Pieron. The sculpture was lifted by a crane from
the bed of a pickup truck and secured with steel rods
into the pavement.
Law Prof. John Merryman, chairman of the Panel on
Outdoor Art, was very enthusiastic about the University
acquiring "Oiseau." Merryman characterized the Miro
sculpture as one of the "great acquisitions" that the
University has made, and said the University was "very
fortunate" to acquire it.
The Panel on Outdoor Art receives a number of re
quests from people who wish to install sculptures here,
Merrryman said, but the panel members try to maintain
strict controls on quality.
According to Merryman, the University utilizes many
safeguards to keep the campus from becoming a
"dumping ground" for second-rate artists. In order for a
sculpture to attain approval to be placed on campus, a
prospective donor must first make a proposal to the
Panel on Outdoor Art. The panel then considers the
appropriateness and quality of the gift, and makes rec
ommendations to university President Donald Kennedy,
while a copy of their recommendations is sent to the
University Committee on Land and Building Develop
ment.
The Land and Building Committee also considers the
proposal and makes recommendations to Kennedy, and
then the president has the option to accept or reject the
committees' recommendations.
