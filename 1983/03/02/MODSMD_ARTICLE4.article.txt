# Ambassador says French skeptical of Mitterand's policies
## 
### KIMBERLY BROWN Senior staff writer 
The French people do not yet realize all the
sacrifices that will be required of them in order for
France to recover economically, French Ambas
sador Robert Luc said yesterday in a speech fo
cused upon the present state of President Fran
cois Mitterand's regime and the country's future
under the socialist administration.
Luc reflected upon France's economic and so
cial conditions today, and speculated on the
president's vast plans for reform. His address
was sponsored by the History Department.
Characterizing Mitterand's policy now, almost
a year-and-a-half after the president's election to
office, Luc told about 40 people the main feature
of the socialist program remains a "commitment
to basic changes in the social and economic
structure of France."
The French public, however, seems to be
growing "increasingly skeptical" toward this
"political machine supposed to bring about
changes in both social and economic reform,"
he said.
The effects of the extensive nationalization re
forms, which include the shifting of power from
the central government to local institutions, the
modification of media — especially radio and
television — and the reorganization of health
services, remain to be seen, the ambassador
said.
Polls taken a year ago showed a substantial

majority in France favoring nationalization. But
recent studies report that those in favor of Mit
terand's reforms have decreased from 56 to 46
percent, Luc said.
In explanation of this adverse reaction, Luc
drew a parallel between the economic policies of
Mitterand and President Reagan. The French
journal Le Monde, he said, reported that "both
leaders are influenced to an extent by ideological
considerations which lead them to rush into de
cisions without considering the consequences."
Given the present situation of both the French
and the American economy, this analysis is
perhaps more worrying than surprising. While
unemployment is not quite as high in France as it
is in the United States, it is, to the French, alarm
ingly high.
Inflation is higher there than in almost all of the
countries that are France's main trading partners.
Mitterand's approach to his country's eco
nomic problems is the exact opposite of the Re
agan economic plan as "his first priority was to
succeed in reducing unemployment," Luc said.
Secondly, Mitterand wanted the authority to
maintain stricter foreign policy and finally, to
back the country in fighting inflation.
Two aspects of France's economic troubles in
particular, the weakness of the franc and the
soaring trade deficit, can be associated with U.S.
economic policy.
. "This year the pressure of high U.S. interest
rates has greatly complicated the situation in our

country," Luc said. In the summer before Mit
terand came to power, $1 cost four francs; last
summer it cost around seven.
The French generally attribute the weak franc
to U.S. interest rates, which they believe Wash
ington deliberately keeps high in order to main
tain the power of the dollar.
France's trade deficit is soaring toward the
frightening figure of 100 billion francs a year,
largely because the strength of the dollar has
nearly doubled the cost of France's oil imports.
"We don't feel we can get over this present
world crisis without relaunching the economy —
but that can only happen if everyone cooper
ates," Luc said.
According to a recent Harris poll printed in the
International Herald Tribune, "nearly half of the
French singled out U.S. economic policy as the
main threat to international security." The report
went on to say that the French see the level of
America's interest rates as "scarier than the level
of Russia's arms buildup."
In response to whether or not these findings
seemed accurate, Luc said that in his opinion,
"the American public is conscious of the dangers
of high interest rates — but the federal govern
ment seems more concerned over the deficit."
"There seems to be a difference of opinion to
be tackled," he said. "A sane economy is just as
important as armaments — just as important as
national security."

world crisis without relaunching the economy —
but that can only happen if everyone cooper
ates," Luc said.
According to a recent Harris poll printed in the
International Herald Tribune, "nearly half of the
French singled out U.S. economic policy as the
main threat to international security." The report
went on to say that the French see the level of
America's interest rates as "scarier than the level
of Russia's arms buildup."
In response to whether or not these findings
seemed accurate, Luc said that in his opinion,
"the American public is conscious of the dangers
of high interest rates — but the federal govern
ment seems more concerned over the deficit."
"There seems to be a difference of opinion to
be tackled," he said. "A sane economy is just as
important as armaments — just as important as
national security."
