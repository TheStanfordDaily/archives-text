Subcommittee charges Lavelle
Washington — A House subcommittee yesterday
asked the Department of Justice to prosecute ousted
Environmental Protection Agency official Rita Lavelle
for perjury, charging that she lied to Congress about a
possible conflict of interest.
The panel, headed by Rep. John Dingell (D-Mich.)
said Lavelle had misled Congress about the date when
she first learned that her former employer, San Die
go-based Aerojet General Corp., was among the pol
luters that her office might have to sue in connection
with a large chemical waste site near Riverside, Calif.
Lavelle, who was fired Feb. 7 by President Reagan as
head of EPA's toxic waste program, said through her
attorney, James Bierbower, that she was ready to con

front her accusers if Dingell would name those who
contradicted her. Dingell refused to release the
names of EPA witnesses who testified in closed ses
sions of his panel.
Queen braves elements
Santa Barbara — British royalty and the U. 5. gov
ernment literally threw caution to the winds yester
day so President Reagan could show Queen Elizabeth
II his beloved mountaintop ranch, which was being
pelted by a severe storm.
Heavy rains and hrgh winds had turned the 7.2-mile
trek from Refugio Beach State Park to Reagan's 2400-
foot high retreat into an extremely hazardous venture
by any standard — a narrow, twisting, steep obstacle

course of flooded streams, washed-out road sections,
downed tree limbs and falling boulders.
But the queen's entire West Coast trip had been
planned around Reagan's desire to show the royal
couple his rustic, relatively modest 688-acre ranch.
And not even one of the worst storms of recent years
was going to keep him from doing it — or her from
showing up.
"She is a real trooper and a good sport .... She
didn't want to disappoint anybody," said White
House deputy chief of staff Michael Deaver, who is
the queen's official host for her trip.
Reagan seemed oblivious to the storm, although
three times in two days he had traversed the danger
ous road top to bottom, being driven through cascad

ing stream torrents that wildly crossed his motor
cade's path six times at depths of 2 to 3 feet.
Queen Elizabeth II will sail intoa galeof Irish-Amer
ican protest tomorrow in San Francisco, where many
of the elected supervisors refuse to greet an English
queen.
The city's Irish American population, estimated to
be more than 100,000 strong, kicked off a week of
demonstrations and meetings with a full-page ad
vertisement in Monday's newspapers declaring,
"Queen Elizabeth 11, You Are As Welcome As George
III."
The ad, with its reference to the monarch who
ruled during the American Revolution, outlined a
