Subcommittee charges Lavelle
Washington — A House subcommittee yesterday
asked the Department of Justice to prosecute ousted
Environmental Protection Agency official Rita Lavelle
for perjury, charging that she lied to Congress about a
possible conflict of interest.
The panel, headed by Rep. John Dingell (D-Mich.)
said Lavelle had misled Congress about the date when
she first learned that her former employer, San Die
go-based Aerojet General Corp., was among the pol
luters that her office might have to sue in connection
with a large chemical waste site near Riverside, Calif.
Lavelle, who was fired Feb. 7 by President Reagan as
head of EPA's toxic waste program, said through her
attorney, James Bierbower, that she was ready to con

front her accusers if Dingell would name those who
contradicted her. Dingell refused to release the
names of EPA witnesses who testified in closed ses
sions of his panel.
Queen braves elements
Santa Barbara — British royalty and the U. 5. gov
ernment literally threw caution to the winds yester
day so President Reagan could show Queen Elizabeth
II his beloved mountaintop ranch, which was being
pelted by a severe storm.
Heavy rains and hrgh winds had turned the 7.2-mile
trek from Refugio Beach State Park to Reagan's 2400-
foot high retreat into an extremely hazardous venture
by any standard — a narrow, twisting, steep obstacle

course of flooded streams, washed-out road sections,
downed tree limbs and falling boulders.
But the queen's entire West Coast trip had been
planned around Reagan's desire to show the royal
couple his rustic, relatively modest 688-acre ranch.
And not even one of the worst storms of recent years
was going to keep him from doing it — or her from
showing up.
"She is a real trooper and a good sport .... She
didn't want to disappoint anybody," said White
House deputy chief of staff Michael Deaver, who is
the queen's official host for her trip.
Reagan seemed oblivious to the storm, although
three times in two days he had traversed the danger
ous road top to bottom, being driven through cascad

ing stream torrents that wildly crossed his motor
cade's path six times at depths of 2 to 3 feet.
Queen Elizabeth II will sail intoa galeof Irish-Amer
ican protest tomorrow in San Francisco, where many
of the elected supervisors refuse to greet an English
queen.
The city's Irish American population, estimated to
be more than 100,000 strong, kicked off a week of
demonstrations and meetings with a full-page ad
vertisement in Monday's newspapers declaring,
"Queen Elizabeth 11, You Are As Welcome As George
III."
The ad, with its reference to the monarch who
ruled during the American Revolution, outlined a
series of picket lines, marches and speeches designed
toconfront thequeen and her husband, Prince Philip,
during their stay here tomorrow and Friday.
"The queen is to Great Britain what the flag is to the
United States. The point is to humiliate the symbol of
British power," Irish activist John Maher said.
His Irish Republican Committee and March 3rd
Coalition expect to draw as many as 20,000 people to a
march and rally in Golden Gate Park on tomorrow,
the day the queen sails into San Francisco Bay.
"The message that's being sent is that Americans of
Irish nationality as a matter of conscience support
their brothers and sisters in Northern Ireland, and it
would be unconscionable to deny his heritage,"
Maher's aide, Stephanie Mischak, said yesterday.
Bad weather, earthquake hit L.A.
Los Angeles — A tornado blasted through a large
section of south-central Los Angeles yesterday morn
ing, destroying or damaging about 100 buildings,
causing minor injuries to a dozen people and tearing
off about a third of the roof of the Los Angeles Con
vention Center.
The funnel ripped houses apart, smashed in brick
storefronts and tore down power lines.
The tornado was followed at midday by an earth
quake measuring 3.5 on the Richter scale. Scientists at
the California Institute of Technology said the
temblor's epicenter was in Inglewood, south of the
Convention Center area.
After the Tornado hit the Convention Center just
before 8 a.m., it roared south along Broadway, a major
north-south thoroughfare, doing its most severe
damage in a stretch of commercial and business struc
tures and startling residents who never expected to
see a funnel cloud in Los Angeles.
Shortly after noon, high winds, apparently gener
ated by another tornado, overturned 15 to 20 trailers
at a mobile home park in the Orange County city of
Santa Ana, south of Los Angeles. Police reported
there were no injuries, but the twister left behind
huge piles of rubble and numerous gas leaks.
Social Security bill approved
Washington — The House Ways and Means Com
mittee yesterday night approved key provisions of a
$165 billion Social Security rescue bill that would de
lay this year's cost-of-living benefit increase for six
months, increase the Social Security tax next year and
make new federal employees part of the Social Secur
ity system.
The bill would also tax part of the benefits of
higher-income retirees.
An effort by Rep. Andrew Jacobs (D-lnd.) to strike
out the provision covering new federal employees
and pump general Treasury revenues into the Social
Security trust fund instead was defeated by voice
vote.
The committee began its work on the bill late yes
terday, and hopes to complete the rescue plan plus a
new system for reimbursing hospitals under Medi
care and an extension of unemployment insurance
benefits by late Wednesday. The Social Security bill
could then go to the House floor next week.
New corps to hire young
Washington — The House yesterday reached back
a half century to revive a major New Deal jobs pro
gram as it approved, 30 1-87, the creation of a con
servation corps to employ as many as 100,000 young
people a year in parks, forests and Indian reserva
tions.
The action to create an American Conservation
Corps, patterned after the Civilian Conservation
Corps of the 19305, came over the opposition of the
Reagan administration, which has largely dismantled
two similar but more recent programs, the Youth
Conservation Corps and Young Adult Conservation
Corps.
The bill now goes to the Senate, which failed to act

on a similar House-passed proposal last year.
Although relatively small, only about one-fifth the
size of the CCC program at the height of its activities
during the Great Depression, the program is the first
of several job-creating measures that are being con
sidered by the 98th Congress in response to con
tinued high unemployment from the current re
cession.
Money to fund the program, up to $60 million this
year and $300 million for each of the next five years,
would have to be provided later.
The funding would be in addition to a $4.6 billion
"emergency" appropriations for jobs that is expected
to be approved by the House tomorrow.
There were indications yesterday that this measure,
for which Reagan has signaled qualified approval,
may be expanded on the floor to nearly $5 billion.
Economic forecast bright
Washington — A top Reagan administration official
yesterday unveiled a new, rosier economic forecast
that predicted the recovery would take off faster and
show more growth than the president expected only
a month ago.
Undersecretary of Commerce Robert Dederick
said that he anticipated growth at an annual rate of 4
percent in the first quarter and a gain of nearly 5 per
cent by the end of this year compared to Reagan's
forecast of a 1 percent growth rate in the January-
March period and only 3.1 percent expansion by the
end of the year. Recent declines in oil prices and
sharper-than-expected reductions in business inven
tories at the close of 1982, largely accounted for the
more upbeat reading, Dederick told reporters.
Martin Feldstein, chairman of the president's
Council of Economic Advisers, agreed that the eco
nomic assumptions made for the administration's
proposed budget for the 1984 fiscal year were now
obsolete.
"Things really do look very much better than they
did at Christmas time," Feldstein told the Los Angeles
Times "But even an increase of 2 percentage points in
the gross national product would only reduce thedef
icit by about $24 billion in fiscal year 1984, so it doesn't
change the policy problems and I don't think it
changes our budget recommendations one bit."
Governors seek defense cuts
Washington — Overriding President Reagan's ob
jections, a bipartisan majority of the nation's gov
ernors yesterday called for scaling back the presi
dent's proposed hikes in defense spending, as part of
a broad policy resolution to shrink future federal defi
cits.
The resolution was adopted by a 30-10 vote at the
final session of the National Governors Association
meeting here, a day after Reagan met with the gov
ernors at the White House and vigorously defended
his proposals for increased Pentagon spending as vital
to national security.
Never before has the governors' association taken a
position on issues that are outside the traditional area
of state concerns. The break with precedent reflected
the poor condition of most state treasuries as a result
of the severe recession and the fears shared by gov
ernors in both parties that federal budget deficits will
drive up interest rates and doom chances of a sus
tained economic recovery.
Stock market rebounds
A broad stock market advance lifted the Dow Jones
industrials to an all-time high yesterday in New York
Stock Exchange volume of more than 100 million
shares.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial issues,
buoyed by a late buying spree, rose 18.09 points to
close at 1130.71. The stock market's best-known in
dicator surpassed the previous record of 1121.81, set
last Thursday, and erased Monday's 8.32-point drop.
Today's weather
Showers and thunderstorms likely today. Showers
tapering off tonight but a few showers lingering
through tomorrow.

ican protest tomorrow in San Francisco, where many
of the elected supervisors refuse to greet an English
queen.
The city's Irish American population, estimated to
be more than 100,000 strong, kicked off a week of
demonstrations and meetings with a full-page ad
vertisement in Monday's newspapers declaring,
"Queen Elizabeth 11, You Are As Welcome As George

The ad, with its reference to the monarch who
ruled during the American Revolution, outlined a

toconfront thequeen and her husband, Prince Philip,
during their stay here tomorrow and Friday.
"The queen is to Great Britain what the flag is to the
United States. The point is to humiliate the symbol of
British power," Irish activist John Maher said.
His Irish Republican Committee and March 3rd
Coalition expect to draw as many as 20,000 people to a
march and rally in Golden Gate Park on tomorrow,
the day the queen sails into San Francisco Bay.
"The message that's being sent is that Americans of
Irish nationality as a matter of conscience support
their brothers and sisters in Northern Ireland, and it
would be unconscionable to deny his heritage,"
Maher's aide, Stephanie Mischak, said yesterday.
Bad weather, earthquake hit L.A.
Los Angeles — A tornado blasted through a large
section of south-central Los Angeles yesterday morn
ing, destroying or damaging about 100 buildings,
causing minor injuries to a dozen people and tearing
off about a third of the roof of the Los Angeles Con
vention Center.
The funnel ripped houses apart, smashed in brick
storefronts and tore down power lines.
The tornado was followed at midday by an earth
quake measuring 3.5 on the Richter scale. Scientists at
the California Institute of Technology said the
temblor's epicenter was in Inglewood, south of the
Convention Center area.
After the Tornado hit the Convention Center just
before 8 a.m., it roared south along Broadway, a major
north-south thoroughfare, doing its most severe
damage in a stretch of commercial and business struc
tures and startling residents who never expected to
see a funnel cloud in Los Angeles.
Shortly after noon, high winds, apparently gener
ated by another tornado, overturned 15 to 20 trailers
at a mobile home park in the Orange County city of
Santa Ana, south of Los Angeles. Police reported
there were no injuries, but the twister left behind
huge piles of rubble and numerous gas leaks.
Social Security bill approved
Washington — The House Ways and Means Com
mittee yesterday night approved key provisions of a
$165 billion Social Security rescue bill that would de
lay this year's cost-of-living benefit increase for six
months, increase the Social Security tax next year and
make new federal employees part of the Social Secur
ity system.
The bill would also tax part of the benefits of
higher-income retirees.
An effort by Rep. Andrew Jacobs (D-lnd.) to strike
out the provision covering new federal employees
and pump general Treasury revenues into the Social
Security trust fund instead was defeated by voice
vote.
The committee began its work on the bill late yes
terday, and hopes to complete the rescue plan plus a
new system for reimbursing hospitals under Medi
care and an extension of unemployment insurance
benefits by late Wednesday. The Social Security bill
could then go to the House floor next week.
New corps to hire young
Washington — The House yesterday reached back
a half century to revive a major New Deal jobs pro
gram as it approved, 30 1-87, the creation of a con
servation corps to employ as many as 100,000 young
people a year in parks, forests and Indian reserva
tions.
The action to create an American Conservation
Corps, patterned after the Civilian Conservation
Corps of the 19305, came over the opposition of the
Reagan administration, which has largely dismantled
two similar but more recent programs, the Youth
Conservation Corps and Young Adult Conservation
Corps.
The bill now goes to the Senate, which failed to act

on a similar House-passed proposal last year.
Although relatively small, only about one-fifth the
size of the CCC program at the height of its activities
during the Great Depression, the program is the first
of several job-creating measures that are being con
sidered by the 98th Congress in response to con
tinued high unemployment from the current re
cession.
Money to fund the program, up to $60 million this
year and $300 million for each of the next five years,
would have to be provided later.
The funding would be in addition to a $4.6 billion
"emergency" appropriations for jobs that is expected
to be approved by the House tomorrow.
There were indications yesterday that this measure,
for which Reagan has signaled qualified approval,
may be expanded on the floor to nearly $5 billion.
Economic forecast bright
Washington — A top Reagan administration official
yesterday unveiled a new, rosier economic forecast
that predicted the recovery would take off faster and
show more growth than the president expected only
a month ago.
Undersecretary of Commerce Robert Dederick
said that he anticipated growth at an annual rate of 4
percent in the first quarter and a gain of nearly 5 per
cent by the end of this year compared to Reagan's
forecast of a 1 percent growth rate in the January-
March period and only 3.1 percent expansion by the
end of the year. Recent declines in oil prices and
sharper-than-expected reductions in business inven
tories at the close of 1982, largely accounted for the
more upbeat reading, Dederick told reporters.
Martin Feldstein, chairman of the president's
Council of Economic Advisers, agreed that the eco
nomic assumptions made for the administration's
proposed budget for the 1984 fiscal year were now
obsolete.
"Things really do look very much better than they
did at Christmas time," Feldstein told the Los Angeles
Times "But even an increase of 2 percentage points in
the gross national product would only reduce thedef
icit by about $24 billion in fiscal year 1984, so it doesn't
change the policy problems and I don't think it
changes our budget recommendations one bit."
Governors seek defense cuts
Washington — Overriding President Reagan's ob
jections, a bipartisan majority of the nation's gov
ernors yesterday called for scaling back the presi
dent's proposed hikes in defense spending, as part of
a broad policy resolution to shrink future federal defi
cits.
The resolution was adopted by a 30-10 vote at the
final session of the National Governors Association
meeting here, a day after Reagan met with the gov
ernors at the White House and vigorously defended
his proposals for increased Pentagon spending as vital
to national security.
Never before has the governors' association taken a
position on issues that are outside the traditional area
of state concerns. The break with precedent reflected
the poor condition of most state treasuries as a result
of the severe recession and the fears shared by gov
ernors in both parties that federal budget deficits will
drive up interest rates and doom chances of a sus
tained economic recovery.
Stock market rebounds
A broad stock market advance lifted the Dow Jones
industrials to an all-time high yesterday in New York
Stock Exchange volume of more than 100 million
shares.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial issues,
buoyed by a late buying spree, rose 18.09 points to
close at 1130.71. The stock market's best-known in
dicator surpassed the previous record of 1121.81, set
last Thursday, and erased Monday's 8.32-point drop.

Subcommittee charges Lavelle
Washington — A House subcommittee yesterday
asked the Department of Justice to prosecute ousted
Environmental Protection Agency official Rita Lavelle
for perjury, charging that she lied to Congress about a
possible conflict of interest.
The panel, headed by Rep. John Dingell (D-Mich.)
said Lavelle had misled Congress about the date when
she first learned that her former employer, San Die
go-based Aerojet General Corp., was among the pol
luters that her office might have to sue in connection
with a large chemical waste site near Riverside, Calif.
Lavelle, who was fired Feb. 7 by President Reagan as
head of EPA's toxic waste program, said through her
attorney, James Bierbower, that she was ready to con

front her accusers if Dingell would name those who
contradicted her. Dingell refused to release the
names of EPA witnesses who testified in closed ses
sions of his panel.
Queen braves elements
Santa Barbara — British royalty and the U. 5. gov
ernment literally threw caution to the winds yester
day so President Reagan could show Queen Elizabeth
II his beloved mountaintop ranch, which was being
pelted by a severe storm.
Heavy rains and hrgh winds had turned the 7.2-mile
trek from Refugio Beach State Park to Reagan's 2400-
foot high retreat into an extremely hazardous venture
by any standard — a narrow, twisting, steep obstacle

course of flooded streams, washed-out road sections,
downed tree limbs and falling boulders.
But the queen's entire West Coast trip had been
planned around Reagan's desire to show the royal
couple his rustic, relatively modest 688-acre ranch.
And not even one of the worst storms of recent years
was going to keep him from doing it — or her from
showing up.
"She is a real trooper and a good sport .... She
didn't want to disappoint anybody," said White
House deputy chief of staff Michael Deaver, who is
the queen's official host for her trip.
Reagan seemed oblivious to the storm, although
three times in two days he had traversed the danger
ous road top to bottom, being driven through cascad

ing stream torrents that wildly crossed his motor
cade's path six times at depths of 2 to 3 feet.

at a mobile home park in the Orange County city of
Santa Ana, south of Los Angeles. Police reported
there were no injuries, but the twister left behind
huge piles of rubble and numerous gas leaks.
Social Security bill approved
Washington — The House Ways and Means Com
mittee yesterday night approved key provisions of a
$165 billion Social Security rescue bill that would de
lay this year's cost-of-living benefit increase for six
months, increase the Social Security tax next year and
make new federal employees part of the Social Secur
ity system.
The bill would also tax part of the benefits of
higher-income retirees.
An effort by Rep. Andrew Jacobs (D-lnd.) to strike
out the provision covering new federal employees
and pump general Treasury revenues into the Social
Security trust fund instead was defeated by voice
vote.
The committee began its work on the bill late yes
terday, and hopes to complete the rescue plan plus a
new system for reimbursing hospitals under Medi
care and an extension of unemployment insurance
benefits by late Wednesday. The Social Security bill
could then go to the House floor next week.
New corps to hire young
Washington — The House yesterday reached back
a half century to revive a major New Deal jobs pro
gram as it approved, 30 1-87, the creation of a con
servation corps to employ as many as 100,000 young
people a year in parks, forests and Indian reserva
tions.
The action to create an American Conservation
Corps, patterned after the Civilian Conservation
Corps of the 19305, came over the opposition of the
Reagan administration, which has largely dismantled
two similar but more recent programs, the Youth
Conservation Corps and Young Adult Conservation
Corps.
The bill now goes to the Senate, which failed to act

on a similar House-passed proposal last year.
Although relatively small, only about one-fifth the
size of the CCC program at the height of its activities
during the Great Depression, the program is the first
of several job-creating measures that are being con
sidered by the 98th Congress in response to con
tinued high unemployment from the current re
cession.
Money to fund the program, up to $60 million this
year and $300 million for each of the next five years,
would have to be provided later.
The funding would be in addition to a $4.6 billion
"emergency" appropriations for jobs that is expected
to be approved by the House tomorrow.
There were indications yesterday that this measure,
for which Reagan has signaled qualified approval,
may be expanded on the floor to nearly $5 billion.
Economic forecast bright
Washington — A top Reagan administration official
yesterday unveiled a new, rosier economic forecast
that predicted the recovery would take off faster and
show more growth than the president expected only
a month ago.
Undersecretary of Commerce Robert Dederick
said that he anticipated growth at an annual rate of 4
percent in the first quarter and a gain of nearly 5 per
cent by the end of this year compared to Reagan's
forecast of a 1 percent growth rate in the January-
March period and only 3.1 percent expansion by the
end of the year. Recent declines in oil prices and
sharper-than-expected reductions in business inven
tories at the close of 1982, largely accounted for the
more upbeat reading, Dederick told reporters.
Martin Feldstein, chairman of the president's
Council of Economic Advisers, agreed that the eco
nomic assumptions made for the administration's
proposed budget for the 1984 fiscal year were now
obsolete.
"Things really do look very much better than they
did at Christmas time," Feldstein told the Los Angeles
Times "But even an increase of 2 percentage points in
the gross national product would only reduce thedef
icit by about $24 billion in fiscal year 1984, so it doesn't
change the policy problems and I don't think it
changes our budget recommendations one bit."
Governors seek defense cuts
Washington — Overriding President Reagan's ob
jections, a bipartisan majority of the nation's gov
ernors yesterday called for scaling back the presi
dent's proposed hikes in defense spending, as part of
a broad policy resolution to shrink future federal defi
cits.
The resolution was adopted by a 30-10 vote at the
final session of the National Governors Association
meeting here, a day after Reagan met with the gov
ernors at the White House and vigorously defended
his proposals for increased Pentagon spending as vital
to national security.
Never before has the governors' association taken a
position on issues that are outside the traditional area
of state concerns. The break with precedent reflected
the poor condition of most state treasuries as a result
of the severe recession and the fears shared by gov
ernors in both parties that federal budget deficits will
drive up interest rates and doom chances of a sus
tained economic recovery.
Stock market rebounds
A broad stock market advance lifted the Dow Jones
industrials to an all-time high yesterday in New York
Stock Exchange volume of more than 100 million
shares.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial issues,
buoyed by a late buying spree, rose 18.09 points to
close at 1130.71. The stock market's best-known in
dicator surpassed the previous record of 1121.81, set
last Thursday, and erased Monday's 8.32-point drop.

Showers and thunderstorms likely today. Showers
tapering off tonight but a few showers lingering

Subcommittee charges Lavelle
Washington — A House subcommittee yesterday
asked the Department of Justice to prosecute ousted
Environmental Protection Agency official Rita Lavelle
for perjury, charging that she lied to Congress about a
possible conflict of interest.
The panel, headed by Rep. John Dingell (D-Mich.)
said Lavelle had misled Congress about the date when
she first learned that her former employer, San Die
go-based Aerojet General Corp., was among the pol
luters that her office might have to sue in connection
with a large chemical waste site near Riverside, Calif.
Lavelle, who was fired Feb. 7 by President Reagan as
head of EPA's toxic waste program, said through her
attorney, James Bierbower, that she was ready to con

front her accusers if Dingell would name those who
contradicted her. Dingell refused to release the
names of EPA witnesses who testified in closed ses
sions of his panel.
Queen braves elements
Santa Barbara — British royalty and the U. 5. gov
ernment literally threw caution to the winds yester
day so President Reagan could show Queen Elizabeth
II his beloved mountaintop ranch, which was being
pelted by a severe storm.
Heavy rains and hrgh winds had turned the 7.2-mile
trek from Refugio Beach State Park to Reagan's 2400-
foot high retreat into an extremely hazardous venture
by any standard — a narrow, twisting, steep obstacle

course of flooded streams, washed-out road sections,
downed tree limbs and falling boulders.
But the queen's entire West Coast trip had been
planned around Reagan's desire to show the royal
couple his rustic, relatively modest 688-acre ranch.
And not even one of the worst storms of recent years
was going to keep him from doing it — or her from
showing up.
"She is a real trooper and a good sport .... She
didn't want to disappoint anybody," said White
House deputy chief of staff Michael Deaver, who is
the queen's official host for her trip.
Reagan seemed oblivious to the storm, although
three times in two days he had traversed the danger
ous road top to bottom, being driven through cascad

ing stream torrents that wildly crossed his motor
cade's path six times at depths of 2 to 3 feet.
Queen Elizabeth II will sail intoa galeof Irish-Amer
ican protest tomorrow in San Francisco, where many
of the elected supervisors refuse to greet an English
queen.
The city's Irish American population, estimated to
be more than 100,000 strong, kicked off a week of
demonstrations and meetings with a full-page ad
vertisement in Monday's newspapers declaring,
"Queen Elizabeth 11, You Are As Welcome As George
III."
The ad, with its reference to the monarch who
ruled during the American Revolution, outlined a
series of picket lines, marches and speeches designed
toconfront thequeen and her husband, Prince Philip,
during their stay here tomorrow and Friday.
"The queen is to Great Britain what the flag is to the
United States. The point is to humiliate the symbol of
British power," Irish activist John Maher said.
His Irish Republican Committee and March 3rd
Coalition expect to draw as many as 20,000 people to a
march and rally in Golden Gate Park on tomorrow,
the day the queen sails into San Francisco Bay.
"The message that's being sent is that Americans of
Irish nationality as a matter of conscience support
their brothers and sisters in Northern Ireland, and it
would be unconscionable to deny his heritage,"
Maher's aide, Stephanie Mischak, said yesterday.
Bad weather, earthquake hit L.A.
Los Angeles — A tornado blasted through a large
section of south-central Los Angeles yesterday morn
ing, destroying or damaging about 100 buildings,
causing minor injuries to a dozen people and tearing
off about a third of the roof of the Los Angeles Con
vention Center.
The funnel ripped houses apart, smashed in brick
storefronts and tore down power lines.
The tornado was followed at midday by an earth
quake measuring 3.5 on the Richter scale. Scientists at
the California Institute of Technology said the
temblor's epicenter was in Inglewood, south of the
Convention Center area.
After the Tornado hit the Convention Center just
before 8 a.m., it roared south along Broadway, a major
north-south thoroughfare, doing its most severe
damage in a stretch of commercial and business struc
tures and startling residents who never expected to
see a funnel cloud in Los Angeles.
Shortly after noon, high winds, apparently gener
ated by another tornado, overturned 15 to 20 trailers
at a mobile home park in the Orange County city of
Santa Ana, south of Los Angeles. Police reported
there were no injuries, but the twister left behind
huge piles of rubble and numerous gas leaks.
