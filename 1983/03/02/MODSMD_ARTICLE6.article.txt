## Speaker condemns hazing 
### BOB DUGONI Staff writer 
Eileen Stevens' work began be
cause of a tragedy. It has continued
because of dedication, persistance
and cooperation.
Stevens is a one-person organiza
tion battling to halt hazing and abuse
in fraternity pledging. She began the
Committee to Halt Useless College
Killings (CHUCK) fouryears ago after
her son Chuck died in a hazing inci
dent.
Stevens was here yesterday as a
guest of Delta Tau Delta (DTD)
fraternity. Though a speech she gave
last night at Kresge Auditorium at
tracted a small gathering her work
during the last four years has been
influential in gaining anti-hazing
legislation in 14 states. In addition to
last night's speech, Stevens also ad
dressed members of the Sigma Alpha
Epsilon (SAE) fraternity and met with
about 25 faculty members, including
residents of the Row and Interfrater
nity Council representatives.
"An invitation can always be
worthwhile, even if it is only to a
handful of people," she said.
DTD President Ken Orvick said the
fraternity sponsored Stevens' visit
because of a hazing incident this year
in which three pledges were taken to
Stanford Hospital after consuming
large quantities of alcohol.
"We feel we're changing," Orvick
said. "We want to lead the way in
changing pledging and make it safer.
A lot of fraternities don't think they
haze. We didn't think we did either.
They may think they don't, but they
probably do."
SEA RA Mike Cennaco, a member
of a fraternity as an undergrad at
Dartmouth College, said that the
topic of Stevens' campaign is one
that should be take seriously by stu
dents.
"People should be introduced to
what she has to say," he said. "It al
lows the individual to realize that
hazing is an important issue that
should be addressed and thought
about."
It was also an alcohol-related inci
dent which killed Stevens' son, and

which is responsible for 98 percent of
the deaths and accidents which re
sult from hazing. In the past five
years, such incidents have claimed
the lives of 24 fraternity pledges, she
said.
Stevens' son died at Alberta Col
lege in New York in 1978. He and
nine other pledges were locked in
car trunks and told to consume a pint
of bourbon, a fifth of wine and a six
pack of beer. They were given a half
an hour to do so.
Three of the pledges were hos
pitalized and near death. Chuck died
on arrival at the hospital. Stevens
said what happened following her
son's death persuaded her to take
action.
Investigations by the district attor
ney's office and the university
labeled the incident isolated and
blameless.
"I wasn't satisfied," Stevens said.
"I think it was the outcome of those
two investigations which brings me
before you today."
Hundreds of letters from con
cerned citizens convinced Stevens
that Chuck's death was not an iso
lated incident.
She convinced her New York legis
lators to sponsor legislation on haz
ing. The measure was unanimously
approved by both houses, but vet
oed by the governor. A second
measure would have met the same
fate had not another hazing death,
this time claiming a star New York
athlete, occurred at the time the gov
ernor was reviewing the measure.
"My feeling is unless we take an
issue, bring it into the open, and ac
knowledge it exists, we don't have a
prayer of solving it," Stevens said.
"I feel it is my responsibility. I
don't want is to happen again. I
wouldn't want your mother or family
to go through what I went through. A
tragedy has a way of getting priorities
in order. It's unfortunate we some
times wait until it is too late."
Stevens has already spoken at 50
campuses this semester. She esti
mated that she has spoken at 200 in
the past four years. She also answers
about 100 letters a week, she said.

Much of her travel and speeches
are subsidized by the fraternity sys
tem. Though originally she did not
receive cooperation from national
fraternity organizations, she
changed their attitudes with her sin
cerity.
"I am not anti-fraternity, or anti-
Creek or anti-sorority," she said.
"I'm anti-abuse and anti-hazing."
"There is nothing positive that
comes about from hazing in any way.
It is wrong. Hazing does not fit with
fraternities. It is in conflict with every
thing a fraternity exists for. To put
someone through a degrading or
dangerous situation just because you
did it is a very bad testimony to what
brotherhood is supposed to be," she
said.
Stevens said the legislation is im
portant because although it may be
difficult to enforce, it does act as a
deterrent by making fraternities and
universities accountable for occur
ences.
Stevens said that many fraternities
substitution of mental hazing for
physical hazing is potentially as
dangerous.
"There are situations when some
one is pushed to far beyond their
endurance. The human mind is a
fragile thing that shouldn't be fooled
with," she said.
"Onethingl trytoalwayspointout
is that all these incidents begin as
something harmless. Nobody ever
intends for someone to get hurt, but
when you have a dangerous combi
nation something wrong is bound to
occur," she said.

did it is a very bad testimony to what
brotherhood is supposed to be," she
said.
Stevens said the legislation is im
portant because although it may be
difficult to enforce, it does act as a
deterrent by making fraternities and
universities accountable for occur
ences.
Stevens said that many fraternities
substitution of mental hazing for
physical hazing is potentially as
dangerous.
"There are situations when some
one is pushed to far beyond their
endurance. The human mind is a
fragile thing that shouldn't be fooled
with," she said.
"Onethingl trytoalwayspointout
is that all these incidents begin as
something harmless. Nobody ever
intends for someone to get hurt, but
when you have a dangerous combi
nation something wrong is bound to
occur," she said.


Eileen Stevens
Eileen Stevens' work began be
cause of a tragedy. It has continued
because of dedication, persistance
and cooperation.
Stevens is a one-person organiza
tion battling to halt hazing and abuse
in fraternity pledging. She began the
Committee to Halt Useless College
Killings (CHUCK) fouryears ago after
her son Chuck died in a hazing inci
dent.
Stevens was here yesterday as a
guest of Delta Tau Delta (DTD)
fraternity. Though a speech she gave
last night at Kresge Auditorium at
tracted a small gathering her work
during the last four years has been
influential in gaining anti-hazing
legislation in 14 states. In addition to
last night's speech, Stevens also ad
dressed members of the Sigma Alpha
Epsilon (SAE) fraternity and met with
about 25 faculty members, including
residents of the Row and Interfrater
nity Council representatives.
"An invitation can always be
worthwhile, even if it is only to a
handful of people," she said.
DTD President Ken Orvick said the
fraternity sponsored Stevens' visit
because of a hazing incident this year
in which three pledges were taken to
Stanford Hospital after consuming
large quantities of alcohol.
"We feel we're changing," Orvick
said. "We want to lead the way in
changing pledging and make it safer.
A lot of fraternities don't think they
haze. We didn't think we did either.
They may think they don't, but they
probably do."
SEA RA Mike Cennaco, a member
of a fraternity as an undergrad at
Dartmouth College, said that the
topic of Stevens' campaign is one
that should be take seriously by stu
dents.
"People should be introduced to
what she has to say," he said. "It al
lows the individual to realize that
hazing is an important issue that
should be addressed and thought
about."
It was also an alcohol-related inci
dent which killed Stevens' son, and

which is responsible for 98 percent of
the deaths and accidents which re
sult from hazing. In the past five
years, such incidents have claimed
the lives of 24 fraternity pledges, she
said.
Stevens' son died at Alberta Col
lege in New York in 1978. He and
nine other pledges were locked in
car trunks and told to consume a pint
of bourbon, a fifth of wine and a six
pack of beer. They were given a half
an hour to do so.
Three of the pledges were hos
pitalized and near death. Chuck died
on arrival at the hospital. Stevens
said what happened following her
son's death persuaded her to take
action.
Investigations by the district attor
ney's office and the university
labeled the incident isolated and
blameless.
"I wasn't satisfied," Stevens said.
"I think it was the outcome of those
two investigations which brings me
before you today."
Hundreds of letters from con
cerned citizens convinced Stevens
that Chuck's death was not an iso
lated incident.
She convinced her New York legis
lators to sponsor legislation on haz
ing. The measure was unanimously
approved by both houses, but vet
oed by the governor. A second
measure would have met the same
fate had not another hazing death,
this time claiming a star New York
athlete, occurred at the time the gov
ernor was reviewing the measure.
"My feeling is unless we take an
issue, bring it into the open, and ac
knowledge it exists, we don't have a
prayer of solving it," Stevens said.
"I feel it is my responsibility. I
don't want is to happen again. I
wouldn't want your mother or family
to go through what I went through. A
tragedy has a way of getting priorities
in order. It's unfortunate we some
times wait until it is too late."
Stevens has already spoken at 50
campuses this semester. She esti
mated that she has spoken at 200 in
the past four years. She also answers
about 100 letters a week, she said.

Much of her travel and speeches
are subsidized by the fraternity sys
tem. Though originally she did not
receive cooperation from national
fraternity organizations, she
changed their attitudes with her sin
cerity.
"I am not anti-fraternity, or anti-
Creek or anti-sorority," she said.
"I'm anti-abuse and anti-hazing."
"There is nothing positive that
comes about from hazing in any way.
It is wrong. Hazing does not fit with
fraternities. It is in conflict with every
thing a fraternity exists for. To put
someone through a degrading or
dangerous situation just because you
did it is a very bad testimony to what
brotherhood is supposed to be," she
said.
