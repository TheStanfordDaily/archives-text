# Students question integrity of film company sales offer
## 
### LISA LYNCH Staff writer 
A telephone sales campaign for a local "film pro
cessing club" has generated negative reactions from
student customers who feel they weren't shown the
whole picture.
The package promises cut-rate film developing, a
tree vacation to Nevada, Florida or Hawaii and 100
free rolls of Kodak film. But most students who pay
$29.95 to join find that they are not elibigle for the
vacation and that the 100 free film coupons are re
deemable only when the film is processed at National
Film Processing, Inc.
The three-day, two-night vacations for two don't
include transportation and are only available to mar
ried students over 21 and single students over 24, but
the company has solicited customers at several Uni
versity dormitories — where all students are single
and almost all are younger than 25.
National Processing salesman Joey Aquino admit
ted that salespeople do not tell students they are
usually ineligible for the vacation deal. "We don't sell
vacations, we sell film processing,' he said. "The vac
ation is just an extra gift that we give them."
He added that National Film processing contracts
with VIP Vacations, and pays a fee for each customer
that takes advantage of the vacation certificate, good
for two nights lodging in Palm Springs, Fla., Hawaii or
Las Vegas or Reno, Nev.
One other stipulation listed on the vacation certifi
cate is that travelers listen to "a one-hour lecture on
new vacation techniques." Aquino said that the lec
ture was not a sales pitch. "It's a presentation by VIP
Vacations,' he said. "They tell you not to work too
hard, and to take more vacations."
Reaction to the package has been mixed. Many
students have been solicited — about one-third of all
Wilbur residents, as well as a large percentage of
Lagunita, Roble and Cro Mem residents — but few
have chosen to buy the film package.
left Schroeder, a Madera freshman, said, "I told
them I wasn't interested right away. I don't go for
over-the-phone deals." He added that he didn't trust
the saleswoman on the phone because of her imper
sonal attitude.
"You could tell she was just reading words off of a
card," he said.
Some students who have purchased the package
are attempting to get a refund. Bill Woodard, a Tran
cos freshman, bought the package last Wednesday

but then later heard negative things about it from
fellow students. He cancelled the check he had writ
ten to National Film, and then approached a salesman
on campus to ask where he could return the package.
"He said he would take it (the package), but when I
asked him for a receipt he said he couldn't give me
one, so I kept it,"he said. "I feel kind of funny
holding on to it, but I don't know what to do."
Another Trancos freshman said that he too had
changed his mind about the package, but had not yet
asked for a refund. "I don't think there was any de
ception involved," he said, but added that since a
free roll of film is sent only after another roll is pro
cessed by National and returned, the procedure was
too slow. "When you want new film, you want it
immediately," he said.
"He called the Better Business Bureau after buying
the package and they said that they had given Na
tional Processing a satisfactory rating.
Aquino estimated that the company has signed up
50 Stanford customers. "We have nine or 10 offices
in the Bay Area, and one in Palo Alto," he said. "We've
used this processing package for a year, and tried it
out last week at Stanford."
According to Aquino, the Palo Alto salespeople
have been complaining about the reactions of stu
dents to the film deal. "When the salesperson is on
the phone with the person, he has the person verify
that he wants the film package. We don't want to
waste money by sending a messenger with the pack
age if the student isn't going to buy, but a lot of times
the student just sent the messenger away."
One sale resulted in a fight between the messenger
and a customer. Aquino said that a student bought
the film package and encouraged a friend to buy it as
well, but then changed his mind when he discovered
that he was too young to use the vacation certificate.
When a messenger came to deliver his friends film
package, the customer demanded a refund, grew
impatient and struck the messenger, saying, "Don't
put me on any list!", Aquino said.
Aquino said that if a student contacts a refund
manager at the sales office within three days of his
purchase, he can arrange to get his money back.
Aquino said that they would continue the campus
sales campaign if they felt there was a good market.
"We've only had 10 complaints," he said, "that's a
pretty good response. After all, we are offering a
great deal."
