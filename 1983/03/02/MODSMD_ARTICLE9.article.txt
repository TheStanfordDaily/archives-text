## Coutts restrictions questioned 
### COLEEN GILLARD 
With sales of the 140 Peter Coutts con
dominiums more sluggish than expected, the
Umve.sity housing office may be forced to
scrap its eligibility restrictions on those who
wish to buy.
Since the development was designed to
help recruit new faculty who may be put off
by steep local real estate prices, the Housing
Office drew up guidelines to insure that the
recruiting purpose of Peter Coutts would not
be abused by better established faculty
members interested in investment property.
No one already owning a home within a 15-
mile radius was eligible.
But slow sales are forcing the office to
scratch this restriction. Only 20 of the units
have been sold and 20 more reserved. This is
in spite of the tact that the units are consid
ered affordable at $ 170,000 to $270,000, when
coupled with one of the University's financial
assistance programs.
Robin Hamill, director of housing pro
grams, fears that opening the condos to
owners of other campus homes may repeat
the problems created by the Pearce Mitchell
condominiums in 1974.
Hamill said the Pearce Mitchell develop
ment was begun after a study of faculty hous
ing needs showed that many retiring profes
sors were eager to exchange their large
homes for a smaller place on campus. The
housing office liked the idea because it
would free single-family homes for incoming
professors with young families.
But after the 82 units were completed, they
failed to sell. And,"n 1974 this was before
housing prices soared upward. The Pearce
Mitchell units that today are worth between
$97,000 and $145,000, were selling then for
$30,000 to $70,000.
Since the units weren't moving, continued
Hamill, "those in charge decided to open the
eligibility requirements. People on campus
were told they could own a Pearce Mitchell as
well as a home on campus. I think we made a
mistake."
Ray Dean, manager of the Pearce Mitchell
complex, said 19 owners today are non
residents. This is 23 percent of the total 82
units. There are 17 retirees fulfilling the de
velopment's original purpose, with an addi
tional 11 widows. The largest group of own
ers, 32, are currently employed faculty and
staff. This trend towards young singles seems
to be continuing. Three units are retained by
the University for visiting scholars.

With the scarcity and high cost of housing
impeding the University's ability to hire fac
ulty from other regions of the country, the
University has yet to find easy solutions to its
housing dilemmas.
Its housing assistance programs are also
coming under review, Hamill said. The Um
vers.ty has been committed to help finance
homes for new faculty members under two
different programs: the housing coinvest
ment program (COIN) and the Housing Al
lowance Program (HAP). The problem here,
said Hamill, is that the programs are too suc
cessful.
COIN, a second mortgage co-investment
program, allows a borrower to pay reduced
interest on a loan in exchange for the Univer
sity's right to recapture the deterred interest
out of appreciation on the residence.
HAP is a supplemental income paid to new
faculty to help them meet their mortgage
payments. It is essentially a second payline
on paychecks which can amount to as much
as $8000 a year.
The University has placed 5 percent or
$30.3 million of its endowment into these
programs, Hamill said. About $19 million has
already been spent in the last three years. The
program, initially restricted to newcomers, is
now open to faculty members who don't al
ready own a home.
The problem today is that the market is no
longer rising at a 30 to 33 percent rate. If the
market turns around there will be little to
collect on the COIN program. So COIN is
being phased out, said Hamill, in return tor a
program that better reflects present market
conditions.
Hamill is curious as to the fate of on
campus housing market with the phasing out
of COIN:
"I think the homes on campus are inflated
in comparison to the Palo Alto market," she
said. "We pumped a lot of cheap money into
our market. Because of University financing,
faculty purchasing power is greater than it
otherwise would be.
"There are no brokers on campus," she
said. "Many buyers and sellers are a little
unsophisticated about what's happening to
the market in this area. People assume that
the 33 percent inflation is still going on. Be
cause buyers and sellers are colleagues, they
hesitate to dicker. Some buyers are now
looking off campus."
