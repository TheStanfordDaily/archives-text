# Puddles, protesters await queen's campus tour
## Groups organize protests 
### TIM GRIEVE Staff writer 
Queen Elizabeth ll's visit here will
not be exempt from the protests that
have marked the earlier stops on her
current California tour.
The Irish Republican Committee
and the Club of Life will both protest
the queen's lunch here today with
separate demonstrations on campus.
Charging that the queen is a "true
enemy of humanity," the Club of Life
— an international institute! estab
lished to fight the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) — expects
more than 30 protestors lo demon
strate in White Plaza at noon today,
while the Irish Republican Commit
tee will bring 50 protestors from San
Francisco to demonstrate here.
By protesting, the Club of Life
hopes to convince the University to
cancel the queen's luncheon at the
Hoover House today. "We would
like the University to repudiate the
queen's visit and to actually cancel
the luncheon," said ]udy Houffman,
an organizer who talked to students
in front of the Post Office yesterday
to drum up support for the Club of
Life protest.
According to Houffman, the Club
of Life's protest will center on British
influence over American policies.
"The reason we're so dead set
against the queen and the European
oligarchy is because United States
foreign policy is now being dictated
by Swiss and English banks and the
IMF, and that's what the queen rep
resents," Houffman said.
Dave Kilber, a northern California
organizer for the Club of Life, said it
is time for the United States to "act
like a republic instead of being
jerked around the world on the
queen's leash."
The Irish Republican Committee
will protest England's continued in
volvement in Northern Ireland and
President Reagan's welcome of the
queen.
"While the president is out romp
ing with the queen, debates are
going on about the economy, the MX
missile, and other things he should
be paying attention to," said Louis
Lillian, a member of the Irish Repub
lican Committee.
Protests have already marked most
parts of the queen's California trip.
About 50 people demonstrated out
side the British Consulate last night
in San Francisco while the queen and
her party relaxed in the St. Francis
hotel. In Los Angeles Tuesday the
Club of Life sponsored a demonstra
tion in front of Los Angeles City Hall,
where more than 100 protesters
chanted "Queen Lizzie you can't
hide, you're committing genocide."
The March Third Coalition will
sponsor major demonstrations today
in San Franciso in front of the Civic
Center and the de Young Museum in
Golden Gate Park. The Irish Republi
can Committee is concentrating
most of its energies on the San Fran
cisco demonstrations and sending
only a "token" delegation here be
cause the University is private prop
erty and the group doesn't want
trouble with the Stanford police.
However, Kilber said his group will
not take part in the March Third Co
alition's protests today because the
San Francisco demonstrations "lack
focus."
According to Houffman, the ( lub
of Life is also avoiding San I rancisco
because it "doesn't want to be iden
tified with the radical groups that are
going to be there."
