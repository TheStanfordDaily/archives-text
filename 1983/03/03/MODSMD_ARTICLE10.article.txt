## Russian department thriving as student interest grows 
### JULIANN ANDERSON 
While "nyet" and "da" are not exactly ringing in the halls, the study of the
Russian language, culture, and literature is definitely on the upswing, ac
cording to Assoc. Prof. William Todd, chairman of the Slavic Languages and
Literatures Department.
He said that the first year Russian course has grown from 30 students last
year to 50 this year.
"Enrollment in the survey course on I9th century Russian literature has
doubled this quarter from 12 to 24. The figures are admittedly small, but they
are significant," he said.
As prominent factors ot the program's growth, Todd cited teaching, cur
rent politics and general education.
"I think students at Stanford show increased interest in courses when they
get reputations of being well done," he said. He added that such professors
as Wayne Vucinich, emeritus in history, and Alexander Dallin, director of the
international relations program, draw people into Soviet studies.
Also, Yuri Andropov's ascension to power after Leonid Brezhnev's death
caused students to look more closely at the Soviet Union, Todd said.
One such student, freshman Laura Edelstein, said, "I think that the United
States became aware at the time of Brezhnev's death that it doesn't know that
much about Russian affairs. There has been a history of increased interest in
the Soviet Union each time power changes."
However, Todd explained that the former Soviet leader didn't die until
mid-autumn, halfway through the quarter, by which time anyone who had
wanted to take Russian already had begun.
He said, "People start their languages during the freshman or sophomore
year in the interest of getting an education — of learning about a different
culture that they don't know much about."
In addition, Russian is one of the only three languages that fulfill a distribu
tion requirement; the other two are Latin and Creek. Todd said that some
one pressed for time, like an engineering major, could learn a new tongue
and fulfill a requirement all at the same time with Russian.
Senior Mary Bun, a comparative literature major who has studied Russian
and spent last summer at Leningrad University, said, "It's becoming appa
rent to Americans that Russians know a lot about the United States, but we
don't know as much about them."

doesn't know that much about Russian af
fairs. There has been a history of increased
interest in the Soviet Union each time
power changes hands/'

She explained that many of the Soviets she met were well-versed in
English, American history, and c urrent English and American literature; the
same cannot be said of many Americans in relation to Russian culture.
She continued, "I think Reagan has kicked it (interest in the USSR) up a bit
with his attitude of confrontation. It's silly that it took this attitude to stir
things up — it's just common sense to know about your adversary."
Clay Moltz, a graduate student in Russian and East European Studies, said
that the media emphasizes the idea that the United States needs people in
Soviet studies.
"I wonder if people will have jobs once they finish their degrees," he said.
Moltz hopes to use his knowledge of Russian in journalism or the foreign
service.
The diplomatic corps is one option available to students of Russian lan
guage and culture. Moltz has completed a significant hurdle toward a diplo
matic career by passing the foreign service exam. Of the 12,000 or so who
take it annually in December, only 1000 to 1500 pass, he said. However, of

those, only 100 to 150 are hired, Moltz added. Chuckling, he said that he has
a "major, major" interview coming up.
Besides the foreign corps, he said other employment possibilities for
Russian speakers include the Central Intelligence Agency and the National
Security Agency.
Referring to the CIA Moltz said, "A lot of people from good colleges don't
want to get into that, considering its past activities. I don't consider it an
option either."
However, outside the government, Todd said that "our students are
getting very good academic jobs."
One of the reasons for this is that he considers Stanford's Russian program
one of the top ten in the nation, although he added that the Slavic depart
ment itself wouldn't make the top ten, since no other modern Slavic lan
guages besides Russian are taught here, although classes dealing with other
Eastern European countries are offered.
Talking about this lack, he said, "The department wants a steady track; we
want to teach a language, literature and culture."
He continued by saying that a new program, such as Polish, for instance,
would take two new faculty members to cover both the language and
literature emphases. He said that it would take nearly $2 million of endow
ment to pay their salaries and benefits, assist with their housing, and con
tinue the University's policy of renewing the endowments so as not to lose
interest on the investment.
"When we do have resources, we want to make Russian strong," he said.
"We're very much interested in expanding our offerings in Russian culture,
art, music, historical linguistics, and semiotics, which is a method of study
ing disparate cultural areas such as literature, music or religion as sign

systems."
One possible source of funding is a Rockefeller foundation grant, which
Stanford is competing for, along with 14 other universities. The $1 million
stake would be shared by the University and Berkeley on a joint basis, since
the two are offering a dual proposal.
Also, legislation known as the Soviet-Bloc Research and Training Act is
pending in Congress. If passed, it would provide $50 million for various
research councils.

"When I came here a decade ago students
were very politically conscious. Since that
time, we've gone through a period of frantic
scrambling for careers. It is my personal
impression, though, that over the last two
years or so interest in the liberal arts has
increased

Besides the departments of Slavic literature and languages, history, inter
national relations, and political science; two other organizations on campus
explore the Soviet experience — the Center for Russian and East European
Studies (CREES) and the American Association for the Advancement of Slavic
Studies (AAASS).
CREES offers courses, a co-terminal 8.A.-M.A. program in Russian and East
European Studies, and does research.
Prof. Wayne Vucinich, directorof CREES and also past president of AAASS,
said, "We happen to have very talented teachers. We are a small
number, but are nationally and internationally recognized.''
The faculty of CREES includes Asst. Prof. Nancy Kollman of the History
department, Asst. Prof. Dorothy Atkinson, also of history, Robert Conquest,
curator of the Russian/Soviet and East European Collections at the Hoover
Institution, Prof. Terence Emmons of the History department, Prof. |an Triska
of the Political Science Department, and Prof. Joseph Van Campen of the
Slavic Languages and Literatures Department, as well as Todd and Dallin.
Financial assistance from the Vucinich Fund for Russian and East Furopean
Studies and University helped CREES to expand its course offerings and
activities.
Stanford is also the national headquarters for the AAASS, of which Atkin
son is the executive director. The Association publishes the Slavic Review,
which, according to Vucinich, is the leading quarterly journal in the field.
AAASS too is growing, Atkinson, in the group's newsleter, reported a 15
percent membership increase in 1982.
According to Todd, other schools across the country are also experiencing
growth in their Soviet studies departments.
Confirming this was Prof. Nicholas Riasanovsky of Berkeley's history de
partment. He added, "There has been considerable interest, though this is
not a period of high growth.

sion, though, that over the last two years or so interest in the liberal arts has
increased."
However, as far as jobs are concerned, he said, "We have much less
hopefulness in using Russian in business than ten years ago. We thought that
trade would really open up then."
When talking about the significance of Soviet studies here, Vucinich
commented, "I would simply say that the Soviet Union is always important.
We have to consider them an ideological enemy, but we have to coexist with
them as well. Our students are interested in learning how to do this."

Reflecting on the past ten years, Todd said, "When I came here a decade

increased."
However, as far as jobs are concerned, he said, "We have much less
hopefulness in using Russian in business than ten years ago. We thought that
trade would really open up then."
When talking about the significance of Soviet studies here, Vucinich
commented, "I would simply say that the Soviet Union is always important.
We have to consider them an ideological enemy, but we have to coexist with
them as well. Our students are interested in learning how to do this."


William Todd
While "nyet" and "da" are not exactly ringing in the halls, the study of the
Russian language, culture, and literature is definitely on the upswing, ac
cording to Assoc. Prof. William Todd, chairman of the Slavic Languages and
Literatures Department.
He said that the first year Russian course has grown from 30 students last
year to 50 this year.
"Enrollment in the survey course on I9th century Russian literature has
doubled this quarter from 12 to 24. The figures are admittedly small, but they
are significant," he said.
As prominent factors ot the program's growth, Todd cited teaching, cur
rent politics and general education.
"I think students at Stanford show increased interest in courses when they
get reputations of being well done," he said. He added that such professors
as Wayne Vucinich, emeritus in history, and Alexander Dallin, director of the
international relations program, draw people into Soviet studies.
Also, Yuri Andropov's ascension to power after Leonid Brezhnev's death
caused students to look more closely at the Soviet Union, Todd said.
One such student, freshman Laura Edelstein, said, "I think that the United
States became aware at the time of Brezhnev's death that it doesn't know that
much about Russian affairs. There has been a history of increased interest in
the Soviet Union each time power changes."
However, Todd explained that the former Soviet leader didn't die until
mid-autumn, halfway through the quarter, by which time anyone who had
wanted to take Russian already had begun.
He said, "People start their languages during the freshman or sophomore
year in the interest of getting an education — of learning about a different
culture that they don't know much about."
In addition, Russian is one of the only three languages that fulfill a distribu
tion requirement; the other two are Latin and Creek. Todd said that some
one pressed for time, like an engineering major, could learn a new tongue
and fulfill a requirement all at the same time with Russian.
Senior Mary Bun, a comparative literature major who has studied Russian
and spent last summer at Leningrad University, said, "It's becoming appa
rent to Americans that Russians know a lot about the United States, but we
don't know as much about them."

"/ think that the United States became

She explained that many of the Soviets she met were well-versed in
English, American history, and c urrent English and American literature; the
same cannot be said of many Americans in relation to Russian culture.
She continued, "I think Reagan has kicked it (interest in the USSR) up a bit
with his attitude of confrontation. It's silly that it took this attitude to stir
things up — it's just common sense to know about your adversary."
Clay Moltz, a graduate student in Russian and East European Studies, said
that the media emphasizes the idea that the United States needs people in
Soviet studies.
"I wonder if people will have jobs once they finish their degrees," he said.
Moltz hopes to use his knowledge of Russian in journalism or the foreign
service.
The diplomatic corps is one option available to students of Russian lan
guage and culture. Moltz has completed a significant hurdle toward a diplo
matic career by passing the foreign service exam. Of the 12,000 or so who
take it annually in December, only 1000 to 1500 pass, he said. However, of

those, only 100 to 150 are hired, Moltz added. Chuckling, he said that he has
a "major, major" interview coming up.
Besides the foreign corps, he said other employment possibilities for
Russian speakers include the Central Intelligence Agency and the National
Security Agency.
Referring to the CIA Moltz said, "A lot of people from good colleges don't
want to get into that, considering its past activities. I don't consider it an
option either."
However, outside the government, Todd said that "our students are
getting very good academic jobs."
One of the reasons for this is that he considers Stanford's Russian program
one of the top ten in the nation, although he added that the Slavic depart
ment itself wouldn't make the top ten, since no other modern Slavic lan
guages besides Russian are taught here, although classes dealing with other
Eastern European countries are offered.
Talking about this lack, he said, "The department wants a steady track; we
want to teach a language, literature and culture."
He continued by saying that a new program, such as Polish, for instance,
would take two new faculty members to cover both the language and
literature emphases. He said that it would take nearly $2 million of endow
ment to pay their salaries and benefits, assist with their housing, and con
tinue the University's policy of renewing the endowments so as not to lose
interest on the investment.
"When we do have resources, we want to make Russian strong," he said.
"We're very much interested in expanding our offerings in Russian culture,
art, music, historical linguistics, and semiotics, which is a method of study
ing disparate cultural areas such as literature, music or religion as sign

systems."
One possible source of funding is a Rockefeller foundation grant, which
Stanford is competing for, along with 14 other universities. The $1 million
stake would be shared by the University and Berkeley on a joint basis, since
the two are offering a dual proposal.
Also, legislation known as the Soviet-Bloc Research and Training Act is
pending in Congress. If passed, it would provide $50 million for various
research councils.

Besides the departments of Slavic literature and languages, history, inter
national relations, and political science; two other organizations on campus
explore the Soviet experience — the Center for Russian and East European
Studies (CREES) and the American Association for the Advancement of Slavic
Studies (AAASS).
CREES offers courses, a co-terminal 8.A.-M.A. program in Russian and East
European Studies, and does research.
Prof. Wayne Vucinich, directorof CREES and also past president of AAASS,
said, "We happen to have very talented teachers. We are a small

The faculty of CREES includes Asst. Prof. Nancy Kollman of the History
department, Asst. Prof. Dorothy Atkinson, also of history, Robert Conquest,
curator of the Russian/Soviet and East European Collections at the Hoover
Institution, Prof. Terence Emmons of the History department, Prof. |an Triska
of the Political Science Department, and Prof. Joseph Van Campen of the
Slavic Languages and Literatures Department, as well as Todd and Dallin.
Financial assistance from the Vucinich Fund for Russian and East Furopean
Studies and University helped CREES to expand its course offerings and
activities.
Stanford is also the national headquarters for the AAASS, of which Atkin
son is the executive director. The Association publishes the Slavic Review,
which, according to Vucinich, is the leading quarterly journal in the field.
AAASS too is growing, Atkinson, in the group's newsleter, reported a 15
percent membership increase in 1982.
According to Todd, other schools across the country are also experiencing
growth in their Soviet studies departments.
Confirming this was Prof. Nicholas Riasanovsky of Berkeley's history de
partment. He added, "There has been considerable interest, though this is
not a period of high growth.

Financial assistance from the Vucinich Fund for Russian and East Furopean
Studies and University helped CREES to expand its course offerings and
activities.
Stanford is also the national headquarters for the AAASS, of which Atkin
son is the executive director. The Association publishes the Slavic Review,
which, according to Vucinich, is the leading quarterly journal in the field.
AAASS too is growing, Atkinson, in the group's newsleter, reported a 15
percent membership increase in 1982.
According to Todd, other schools across the country are also experiencing
growth in their Soviet studies departments.
Confirming this was Prof. Nicholas Riasanovsky of Berkeley's history de
partment. He added, "There has been considerable interest, though this is
not a period of high growth.
Reflecting on the past ten years, Todd said, "When I came here a decade
ago, students were very politically conscious. Since that time, we've gone
through a period of frantic scrambling for careers. It is my personal impres
sion, though, that over the last two years or so interest in the liberal arts has
increased."
However, as far as jobs are concerned, he said, "We have much less
hopefulness in using Russian in business than ten years ago. We thought that
trade would really open up then."
When talking about the significance of Soviet studies here, Vucinich
commented, "I would simply say that the Soviet Union is always important.
We have to consider them an ideological enemy, but we have to coexist with
them as well. Our students are interested in learning how to do this."
