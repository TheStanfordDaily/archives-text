## The 						Stanford Daily Concerts by, for students 
### 
Rock concerts. For some administrators, the
words conjure up images of shifty characters,
drug use and tremendous potential for financial
loss. But for most students, the connotation of
the words is entirely favorable. They just want
more of them here.
We applaud the return of rock concerts this
year, three years after the financial collapse
of ASSU Special Events, and we hope student
co-promoted concerts are here to stay this time.
(Pat Benatar will perform in Maples Pavilion
March 25 and the Grateful Dead and Kenny Log
gins performed in Frost Amphitheater last Oc
tober.)
Student groups stand to gain in many ways
from concert-promoting. They benefit finan
cially. The Chaparral reportedly cleared almost
$10,000 from the Grateful Dead concert. Stu
dents interested in marketing and promotion
also gain invaluable hands-on experience from
producing concerts here.
Students are often at a disadvantage in prom

oting concerts, since they usually compete with
full-time professionals. Still, the advantages of
student promotion outweigh the disadvan
tages, particularly under the new system in
which student groups work in conjunction with
Bill Graham Presents, the largest Bay Area rock
concert promoter. Because they are working
with, rather than competing against, this well
known and powerful promoter, they can attract
top names and turn a profit.
Students should continue to pool their talent
and knowledge of concert-promoting. The
Concert Network, a group of four student
groups — KZSU, the Band, the Chaparral and
Student Alumni Network — is a step in the right
direction. We feel that students benefit in the
long-term by combining their energy and skills
in this way.
And we hope that students, rather than private
or University interests, continue to play a prim
ary role in the planning and production of cam
pus concerts in the future.
