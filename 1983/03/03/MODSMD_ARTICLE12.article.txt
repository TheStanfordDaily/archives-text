# Welcome, Queen Elizabeth
## 
### 
Every so often it is good to stop our queries
into what has been and what could be so that we
can appreciate what is in our midst. Today as
Queen Elizabeth II and her Court enter Stan
ford's realm, we should pause to welcome her
for what she is; an anomaly perhaps, but by all
accounts a gracious lady who bears well the
burden of monarchy. Already she has captured
the fancy of many Americans and we would be
unfair if we did not admit a certain fascination
with her arrival.
English Prot. William Chace reminds us that
upon encountering the Queen one does not

meet a person, but a Presence. Although this
University has had many distinguished persons
pass down its palm-laden avenues, we have
rarely hosted a Presence. It is an honor that
seldom comes.
If you were not invited to lunch with Her
Majesty or if you blinked when her motorcade
passed by, take heart. Prof. Chace offers these
consoling words: "Symbols are not met: they
are regarded from distances, long and short." So,
with a mixture of curiosity and respect, we wel
come this symbol into our midst.
