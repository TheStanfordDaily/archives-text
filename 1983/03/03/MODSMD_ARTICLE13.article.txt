## R-project: secrets at SSRL 
### 
When the news that an experimen
tal proposal from the nuclear
weapons laboratories had come in to
the Stanford Synchrotronic Radia
tion Laboratory (SSRL) at SLAC a few
weeks ago there were a variety of
reactions among the SLAC staff. One
of my colleagues responded to my
expression of opposition: "Oh,
come on, this is nothing special.
After all there have been people from
the naval weapons labs there for
ages. What's new about this?" He
was factually correct, of course, and
in fact there has been a group from
one of the nuclear weapons labora
tories there for some time too.
There was not time to respond to
his remark, but later I thought: "This
is different. It's different in the scale
and it's different in the politics." The
individual researchers working at
SSRL, and the many other researchers
at Stanford working on weapons-re
lated contracts are doing it as indi
viduals. But the proposal now being
considered involves the ownership
of a part of the facility by the
weapons laboratories. And because
my work is an essential part of their
work, it involves their ownership of a
part of my work. It's like they are
stealing my work to use for some
thing that I am opposed to.
Another colleague felt differently
about things: "I think this whole nu
clear weapons business is irrational,
dangerously out of control," he said.
"But it's really difficult to get at it,
because of all the secrecy and the self
serving mythology that surrounds it.
I think that whenever it touches your
lite vou have to stamp on it as hard as
you (an."
In the weeks since then, as the dis
cussion has continued, I have tried to
sort out my feelings about the pro
posal. Was this just a matter of
routine; if it wasn't done here would
it be done somewhere else? Is it |ust a

small part of a rational but regretta
ble necessity; does deterrence keep
the peace? Or is my other friend
closer to the truth? Are we all trapped
in a terminal madhouse?
I resolved to find out more about
the kind of work that was proposed.
It had puzzled me that the weapons
builders found it necessary at this
late date to have a facility tor calibrat
ing photon detectors. After all they
have been building these weapons
for forty years, and have built and
tested them in all shapes and sizes,
why all of a sudden do they need to
have better test apparatus?
I looked at the request submitted
to the government for construction
money for the facility. It spoke of the
need "to characterize absolutely the
intensity, time and energy distribu
tion of weapons-generated X-rays."
Why? It explained: "these needs are
strongly driven by R-project. . . ."
The name didn't mean much to me
then, although I had some thought
that it might have something to do
with something that Edward Teller
had talked of once; some kind of
new development that would solve
the whole nuclearwar problem. How
to check it out? Well, it turns out that
not very much is secret in this busi
ness. The people at the top are al
ways leaking information to the
press, or to Congress, in order to
help steer money in the direction
that they want. And there is also a
network of people who are, if you
will, on our side. And they file all
these leaks and put them together so
that we can keep track of the nasty
things that the weapons builders
have in mind for us ten years down
the line. So it was only a phone call or
two, a talk over a cup of coffee and a
fortuitous meeting with an insider
and R-project was defined.
I was right, it is Teller's latest fan
tasy, under development for some

years at Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory. It's what is called a nuclear
pumped, X-ray laser, directed energy
ICBM killer. It will be a laser satellite
capable of targeting a couple of dozen
ICBMs simultaneously. When the thing
has locked on to a sufficient number of
incoming ICBMs as they leave the at
mosphere, a nuclear device will be
triggered which will stimulate the pro
duction of billions of watts of X-rays in
each of the laser arms, sufficient to blast
a hole in each of the missiles before the
satellite itself disintegrates.
Now, anybody with a technical
background can point to a hundred
reasons why such a system is unlikely
to work. But that's almost not impor
tant; the real question is what does
such a development do to the pros
pect for peace. Here the answer is
clear. Firstly the testing and deploy
ment of such a device would require
the abrogation of almost all the
existing arms control treaties, the
sparse dry fruit of 25 years of
negotiation. Secondly, it would
stimulate the deployment of a dozen
counter deployments, each one
more destabilizing than the last. It
would begin a whole new arms race.
The work at SSRL is not some trivial,
routine aspect of a necessary part of
the nation's defense posture. It is a
facility of specialized importance to
what may be the most disastrous
technical development since 1945. It
will not be sufficient to express op
position to the calibration facility at
SSRL. The facts as we now under
stand them demand a more exten
sive response: a sustained, informed
and resolute campaign against
R-project itself. Like my colleague
said, it has come into our lives and
we must stamp on it.

Laboratory. It's what is called a nuclear
pumped, X-ray laser, directed energy
ICBM killer. It will be a laser satellite
capable of targeting a couple of dozen
ICBMs simultaneously. When the thing
has locked on to a sufficient number of
incoming ICBMs as they leave the at
mosphere, a nuclear device will be
triggered which will stimulate the pro
duction of billions of watts of X-rays in
each of the laser arms, sufficient to blast
a hole in each of the missiles before the
satellite itself disintegrates.
Now, anybody with a technical
background can point to a hundred
reasons why such a system is unlikely
to work. But that's almost not impor
tant; the real question is what does
such a development do to the pros
pect for peace. Here the answer is
clear. Firstly the testing and deploy
ment of such a device would require
the abrogation of almost all the
existing arms control treaties, the
sparse dry fruit of 25 years of
negotiation. Secondly, it would
stimulate the deployment of a dozen
counter deployments, each one
more destabilizing than the last. It
would begin a whole new arms race.
The work at SSRL is not some trivial,
routine aspect of a necessary part of
the nation's defense posture. It is a
facility of specialized importance to
what may be the most disastrous
technical development since 1945. It
will not be sufficient to express op
position to the calibration facility at
SSRL. The facts as we now under
stand them demand a more exten
sive response: a sustained, informed
and resolute campaign against
R-project itself. Like my colleague
said, it has come into our lives and
we must stamp on it.

When the news that an experimen
tal proposal from the nuclear
weapons laboratories had come in to
the Stanford Synchrotronic Radia
tion Laboratory (SSRL) at SLAC a few
weeks ago there were a variety of
reactions among the SLAC staff. One
of my colleagues responded to my
expression of opposition: "Oh,
come on, this is nothing special.
After all there have been people from
the naval weapons labs there for
ages. What's new about this?" He
was factually correct, of course, and
in fact there has been a group from
one of the nuclear weapons labora
tories there for some time too.
There was not time to respond to
his remark, but later I thought: "This
is different. It's different in the scale
and it's different in the politics." The
individual researchers working at
SSRL, and the many other researchers
at Stanford working on weapons-re
lated contracts are doing it as indi
viduals. But the proposal now being
considered involves the ownership
of a part of the facility by the
weapons laboratories. And because
my work is an essential part of their
work, it involves their ownership of a
part of my work. It's like they are
stealing my work to use for some
thing that I am opposed to.
Another colleague felt differently
about things: "I think this whole nu
clear weapons business is irrational,
dangerously out of control," he said.
"But it's really difficult to get at it,
because of all the secrecy and the self
serving mythology that surrounds it.
I think that whenever it touches your
lite vou have to stamp on it as hard as
you (an."
In the weeks since then, as the dis
cussion has continued, I have tried to
sort out my feelings about the pro
posal. Was this just a matter of
routine; if it wasn't done here would
it be done somewhere else? Is it |ust a

small part of a rational but regretta
ble necessity; does deterrence keep
the peace? Or is my other friend
closer to the truth? Are we all trapped
in a terminal madhouse?
I resolved to find out more about
the kind of work that was proposed.
It had puzzled me that the weapons
builders found it necessary at this
late date to have a facility tor calibrat
ing photon detectors. After all they
have been building these weapons
for forty years, and have built and
tested them in all shapes and sizes,
why all of a sudden do they need to
have better test apparatus?
I looked at the request submitted
to the government for construction
money for the facility. It spoke of the
need "to characterize absolutely the
intensity, time and energy distribu
tion of weapons-generated X-rays."
Why? It explained: "these needs are
strongly driven by R-project. . . ."
The name didn't mean much to me
then, although I had some thought
that it might have something to do
with something that Edward Teller
had talked of once; some kind of
new development that would solve
the whole nuclearwar problem. How
to check it out? Well, it turns out that
not very much is secret in this busi
ness. The people at the top are al
ways leaking information to the
press, or to Congress, in order to
help steer money in the direction
that they want. And there is also a
network of people who are, if you
will, on our side. And they file all
these leaks and put them together so
that we can keep track of the nasty
things that the weapons builders
have in mind for us ten years down
the line. So it was only a phone call or
two, a talk over a cup of coffee and a
fortuitous meeting with an insider
and R-project was defined.
I was right, it is Teller's latest fan
tasy, under development for some

years at Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory. It's what is called a nuclear
pumped, X-ray laser, directed energy
ICBM killer. It will be a laser satellite
