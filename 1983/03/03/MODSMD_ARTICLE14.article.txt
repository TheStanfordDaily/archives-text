# LETTER
## Quad plans are not finalized 
### 
There has been a fair amount of
input in the Daily about the upcom
ing Inner Quad project and I would
like to help clarify the situation.
In the first place, the plans for this
project have not yet been done, and
the Planning Office has not recom
mended a solution or materials,
whether asphalt, concrete or grass.
Those tasks lie ahead.
The Planning Office did put to
gether a report, with input and sup
port from the University Committee
on Land and Building Development
(UCLBD), to help establish the con
text for the project for review by the
administration and Board of Trus
tees, and as a program to guide the
consulting landscape architect and
design team through the ideas and
alternatives which have been discus
sed in the past.
This program report contains an
introduction to some of the historical
background and previous plans for
restoration, a discussion of concepts
of historical restoration and possible
enhancements which could rein
force use as a "people space," and a

list of criteria and design alternatives
to be investigated further. The Daily
was furnished a copy of the report,
and copies are on reserve at Green
Library (Report on the Stanford Uni
versity Inner Quad Courtyard).
The report concludes with a sum
mary of recommended principles,
guidelines and ideas endorsed by the
UCLBD for consideration in the de
sign process. Having received ap
proval by the Board, the project is
now the responsibility of the
Facilities Project Management Of
fice, which has engaged a consulting
landscape architect. The UCLBD is
forming a committee with faculty,
student and staff representatives to
work with the consultants and the
Stanford community. There will be a
widespread University involvement,
as there should be for such an impor
tant project.
I am writing to help make sure that
involvement is initiated without mis
understanding about its starting
point. We begin with strong respect
for history and the original plan con
cept of Frederick Law Olmsted,

openness to enhancement, and a di
rective to study a wide range of de
sign and materials options. No
specific solutions have been recom
mended.
As for myself, based on what I
know now, I don't happen to think
that either extensive grass lawns or
asphalt paving would be the best op
tions, and I think it's only fair to con
firm that. But I intend to keep an
open mind and review the studies
and recommendations as they are
developed, give them serious
thought, and then add my voice to
the hundreds (or thousands) of
others in support of what seems to
each participant to be the best re
commendation.
I'm extremely grateful to the
donors and am looking forward, ea
gerly, to the prospect of this long
needed completion of our central
open space, and am confident that
the result will please most, but prob
ably not all, of us.
