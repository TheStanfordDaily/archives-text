# Clearing up the EPA confusion
## 
### 
I'll admit it. The controversy sur
rounding the EPA's hazardous waste
programs had me baffled. The whole
thing seemed like it should have
been turned into an ABC mini-series,
maybe called "The Winds of Waste."
I decided that before I purchased my
gas mask, I'd give a call to my contact
at the EPA, Ned Gleet.
"Ned, what's going on? It sounds
like you've got a real scandal brew
ing."
"Hey, the only 'scandal' that's brew
ing is in the media. We're clean as a
toxic waste dump, honest!"
"I'm sure glad to hear that. Maybe
you could clear up some of those
silly, media allegations once and for
all?"
"I'd love to. Fire away."
"Well, I've heard that Congress
created a $1.6 billion 'superfund'
three years ago to clean up the coun
try's most dangerous toxic waste
dumps."
"That's right. What's the prob
lem?"
"Apparently your agency can't ac
count for $53.6 million of the fund."
"So you're gonna hang us for a lit
tle bookkeeping error? Listen, any
body who has a checking account
knows how tricky balance state
ments can be. You misplace a deci
mal point, you forget about your ser
vice charge ... it happens."
"Okay. I guess everybody makes
mistakes. But how come you've only
cleaned up five sites on your 'most
dangerous' list over the past three
years?"
"Do you have any idea about what
goes into a toxic waste dump?
There's contaminated water,
poisonous sludge, all kinds of
hazardous gunk. Bleghh! It's disgust
ing! Now, maybe you like prancing
around in chemical waste. I don't. I
don't even like to take out my own
garbage — I make my wife do it.
She's not going to make me tote
around a bag full of orange peels,
chicken bones and coffee grounds.
And NOBODY is gonna make me get
anywhere near toxic waste!"
"I think I understand. Maybe you
could respond to the allegations that
your agency made 'sweetheart' deals
with polluting companies. Appar

ently, representatives ot chemical
companies frequently took Rita
Lavelle out to lunch and dinner, but
she rarely dined with environmental
lobbyists. Doesn't this seem a little
peculiar, since she was in charge of
the waste programs?"
"Absolutely not! What's so peculiar
about somebody enjoying a nice
meal out? Put yourself in Rita's posi
tion. You're sitting at vour desk, flip
ping through the latest issue of
Sludge Illustrated, when all of a sud
den you get a phone call from some
big shot chemical rep who wants to
take you out to dinner. He's probably
got a nice car and a hefty expense

'Do you have any idea about what goes into a

account. Five minutes later you get a
call from one of those hand-wringing
environmentalists. I know what
they're like — I've been to Berkeley.
You'd meet the guy at one of those
organic places and argue about
chemical poisons over a plate full of
alfalfa sprouts. Who wants to talk
about that kind of stuff over dinner?
Besides, you'd probably have to pay
for your own meal. So who would
you eat dinner with?"
"I see your point. But what about
the charges that your agency delayed
cleanups of certain waste sites for
political reasons?"
"What about 'em? Sure, we de
layed at a couple of places until after
the November election. But we only
delayed to protect the environ
ment."
"I don't think I understand."
"Look, when it's election time,
what do you see plastered all over
your cities? Campaign posters!
When the election is over, do you
suppose that the politicans run
around and collect all of their posters
and throw them away? Of course
not! Nobody throws them away, and
they end up blowing around in our

parks and on our streets. So we fig
ured that we'd wait until after the
election, and then we could get rid of
the posters and the toxic waste all at
the same time. Why make two trips?"
"I suppose that makes sense. But
there's one thing that still confuses
me. Your administrator, Anne (Gor
such) Burford, was cited for contempt
of Congress for refusing to turn over
subpoenaed documents relating to the
'superfund' sites. Then, a few weeks
later, two brand new paper shredders
suddenly turned up in your
hazardous-waste section. You have to
admit, it sounds a little suspicious.

"Okay, okay, that was my goof. I
could've sworn that I ordered two
paper copiers, not paper shredders.
When the maintenance guy wheeled
two new machines into my office, I
assumed that they were copiers. By
that time, I had convinced Anne that
we should turn over the documents.
I volunteered to make copies of them
on our new machines, just in case
one of those irresponsible con
gressmen lost the originals. Well,
you can just imagine how foolish I
felt when I finally realized I had been
shredding documents instead of
copying them! Fortunately, it only
took me two hours to catch my mis
take."
"Boy, I'm sure glad you were able
to shed some light on these ridicul
ous allegations, Ned. I thought you
guys were in some serious trouble,
but you obviously don't have any
problems at all."
"Well, we do have one problem."
"What's that?"
"What are we going to do with 70
pounds of confetti?"

"Okay. I guess everybody makes

cleaned up five sites on your 'most

years?"
"Do you have any idea about what
goes into a toxic waste dump?
There's contaminated water,
poisonous sludge, all kinds of

account. Five minutes later you get a
call from one of those hand-wringing
environmentalists. I know what
they're like — I've been to Berkeley.
You'd meet the guy at one of those
organic places and argue about
chemical poisons over a plate full of
alfalfa sprouts. Who wants to talk
about that kind of stuff over dinner?
Besides, you'd probably have to pay
for your own meal. So who would
you eat dinner with?"
"I see your point. But what about
the charges that your agency delayed
cleanups of certain waste sites for
political reasons?"
"What about 'em? Sure, we de
layed at a couple of places until after
the November election. But we only
delayed to protect the environ
ment."
"I don't think I understand."
"Look, when it's election time,
what do you see plastered all over
your cities? Campaign posters!
When the election is over, do you
suppose that the politicans run
around and collect all of their posters
and throw them away? Of course
not! Nobody throws them away, and
they end up blowing around in our

parks and on our streets. So we fig
ured that we'd wait until after the
election, and then we could get rid of
the posters and the toxic waste all at
the same time. Why make two trips?"
"I suppose that makes sense. But
there's one thing that still confuses
me. Your administrator, Anne (Gor
such) Burford, was cited for contempt
of Congress for refusing to turn over
subpoenaed documents relating to the
'superfund' sites. Then, a few weeks
later, two brand new paper shredders
suddenly turned up in your
hazardous-waste section. You have to
admit, it sounds a little suspicious.

"Okay, okay, that was my goof. I
could've sworn that I ordered two
paper copiers, not paper shredders.
When the maintenance guy wheeled
two new machines into my office, I
assumed that they were copiers. By
that time, I had convinced Anne that
we should turn over the documents.
I volunteered to make copies of them
on our new machines, just in case
one of those irresponsible con
gressmen lost the originals. Well,
you can just imagine how foolish I
felt when I finally realized I had been
shredding documents instead of
copying them! Fortunately, it only
took me two hours to catch my mis
take."
"Boy, I'm sure glad you were able
to shed some light on these ridicul
ous allegations, Ned. I thought you
guys were in some serious trouble,
but you obviously don't have any
problems at all."
"Well, we do have one problem."
"What's that?"
"What are we going to do with 70
pounds of confetti?"

I'll admit it. The controversy sur
rounding the EPA's hazardous waste
programs had me baffled. The whole
thing seemed like it should have
been turned into an ABC mini-series,
maybe called "The Winds of Waste."
I decided that before I purchased my
gas mask, I'd give a call to my contact
at the EPA, Ned Gleet.
"Ned, what's going on? It sounds
like you've got a real scandal brew

"Hey, the only 'scandal' that's brew

toxic waste dump, honest!"
"I'm sure glad to hear that. Maybe
you could clear up some of those
silly, media allegations once and for
all?"
"I'd love to. Fire away."
"Well, I've heard that Congress
created a $1.6 billion 'superfund'
three years ago to clean up the coun
try's most dangerous toxic waste
dumps."
"That's right. What's the prob
lem?"
"Apparently your agency can't ac
count for $53.6 million of the fund."
