# Faculty housing finance program closing down
## 
### COLLEEN GILLARD Fourth in a four part series 
It may seem strange to close
a program because it is too
successful, but that is the
reason the University intends
to phase out its housing fi
nance program.
The program, known as the
Stanford Second Mortgage
Coinvestment Program
(COIN), was established to
help attract new faculty with
assurances that they could buy
a house in an inflated market.
The program, which has dis
bursed nearly $20 million in the
last three years, is quickly
using up its original budget of
$30 million.
Another and possibly more
significant reason that the
program is being reconsidered
involves its mode of operation.
COIN finances reduced
interest second mortgages in
exchange for a percentage of
the profits when the home is
resold. In the last year, several
campus homes sold for less
than their purchase price. This
has caused concern at the
housing office. Robin Hamill,
director of housing programs,
states that the office is now
considering a program "more
suitable to today's market."
Ray Bier, real estate agent
with Taylor Properties in Palo
Alto, is surprised at the Univer
sity's problems in a declining
market: "Without any doubt
real estate sales are beginning
to turn around," he said.
"Sales of single family homes
are rising dramatically; the
market looks great."
Faculty members may prefer
to buy off campus. Statistics
from the housing office show
that on the average, faculty
members are spending around
$30,000 more for homes on
campus.
Hamill pointed out, how
ever, that the COIN program
favors on-campus purchases
because those selling homes
off-campus that have COIN
loans are penalized by realty
commissions. This is because
the University's share of the
profit comes out of the gross
sale price. The off campus
homeowner must pay the real

tor's commission out of what is
left.
Lucille Long, manager of
faculty/staff housing, said that
COIN loans have been respon
sible for allowing many junior
faculty to buy homes. The
juniorfaculty in the humanities
and sciences make up the
majority of those participating
in the COIN program, she ad
ded.
George Evans, a professor of
economics in his second year
of teaching, has just purchased
a Peter Coutts unit with a COIN
loan. There was an understand
ing, he said, when he was of
fered the position, that the
University would enable him to
buy a home.

"There was no question that
in our case, the COIN assis
tance was essential," he said.
"We spent a lot of time looking
at homes but single-family
homes were too expensive.
We are pleased with Peter
Coutts. My wife and I both
work, so we find the low
maintenance of the place con
venient." Evans had high
praise for the COIN program
itself, those running the prog
ram and for the Peter Coutts
development.
The financial situation of
those taking advantage of
COIN vary enormously. In
spite of Long's advice not to
commit more than 30 percent
of one's income to mortgage
payments, some junior faculty
devote almost 40 percent to
mortgages.
One humanities professor
who earns $24,000 spends 32
percent of his income on
$600-a-month payments on his
$100,000 home. In contrast, a
professor from the medical

school who earns $180,000 a
year took out a COIN loan to
purchase a $470,000 home,
committing only 14 percent of
his income to make $2000-a
-month payments.
Although in general those
from the law, business and
medical schools seem to have
greater buying power, junior
faculty from those schools still
find it difficult to buy.
Deborah Rhode, law profes
sor, and her lawyer husband
Ralph Cavanagh, bought a
Pearce Mitchell condo because
of financial constraint. "My
husband, as a public interest
lawyer, has a salary that reflects
public interest salary scales,
not those of large law firms,"
she said.
"If money were no object, of
course, we might have consi
dered a house rather than a
Pearce Mitchell condominium.
We'd like to stay on campus,"
she said.
Rhode said that they purch
ased the Pearce Mitchell unit
with a University first mortgage
loan in an earlier and less
generous program than COIN.
She added that they might like
to take advantage of the tail
end of the present COIN prog
ram, sell their Pearce Mitchell
condo and buy a home. "Un
fortunately," she said, "the
Pearce Mitchell units are not
keeping up with the market.
We would probably not get
today what we bought the unit
for because of competition
with Peter Coutts."
Long said that single-family
homes on campus tend to sell
to full professors. Such homes
have been selling for between
$250,000 and $400,000. These
prices are not only being asked
for the large homes on full
acres on San Juan Hill built in
the '30s, they are also being
asked for the newer homes on
quarter-acre lots. In the last
year, six homes on 10-year-old
Frenchman's Hill sold for bet
ween $300,000 and $400,000.
Of the recent purchases of
these homes, figures from the
Office of Housing Programs
show that COIN loans are
comprising larger and larger
shares of the financing. The
average loan has grown from
roughly 33 percent to 45 per
cent of the purchase prices in
the program's three years. But
shares range in extremes from
90 percent of a $95,000 Pearce
Mitchell condo, to 15 percent
of a $625,000 home in Los Altos.
