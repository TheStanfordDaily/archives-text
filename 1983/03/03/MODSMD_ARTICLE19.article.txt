A MEAL FIT FOR A QUEEN?: Residents of Yost House from
left to right, Tom Moroney, Peter Rucker, Monica Rivera,
Lisa Nuyen and T.G. Limcaoco enjoyed a lunch without the
queen yesterday in the Yost House dining room. The fes
tivities included a "non-receptive reception line," intro
ductory remarks by Yost House RA Louis Friedman, a

Russell Jong/Daily
speech by junior Todd Morrow entitled, "What the queen is
not," and a talk by junior Melissa Mitchell explaining why
she did not want to have lunch with the queen. Band
members played "Hail Britannia" until mock secret service
men chased them away.
