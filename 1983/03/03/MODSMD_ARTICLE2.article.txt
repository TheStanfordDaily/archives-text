Queen Elizabeth and her party will find some — but not much — relief
from the uncharacteristic storms and high winds they encountered in
Southern California at the royal luncheon today. The National Weather
Service predicts scattered showers today, with rain ending by late afternoon
or evening.
Another storm system will be moving into the Bay Area tomorrow nighl
and rain is expected to continue on and off throughout the weekend,
according to Bob Brown of the National Weather Service. Brown adciea that,
rain is possible for the beginning of the next week.
The Palo Alto Public Works Office noted that major flood damage has
subsided in the area. "But we have had localized flooding in the neighbor
hoods and at intersections," said Mike Miller, public works supervisor.
Miller explained that "when the creeks are full, storm drains can't dump into
them," and thus the drains often flood.
Although the creeks are running high, the office foresees no property
damage. "In fact, we were giving out sandbags and we closed that down,"
said Helen Lancaster, a public works employee. Miller added the office has
"two people on stand-by and the rest of the crew on call" in case of
storm-related emergencies.
Local and Bay Area retailers have, however, been damaged by the long
stint of foul weather. "Starting with the first part of the week through today,
our traffic has been down," said Larry Bernekar, assistant store manager of
Saks Fifth Avenue in the Stanford Shopping Center.
A spokesman from Bullock's said, "People just don't come in when it gets
wet." He added that Bullock's employees are "doing stock work and clean
ing house" to busy themselves during the lull.
And yet not all merchandise items suffer during these weeks of wetness.
"Umbrellas have literally been reordered four different times because the
season has been so long," said Pat Turner, special events manager for
Emporium-Capwell. "Outerwear has been extremely successful this year at
our downtown store," she added.
