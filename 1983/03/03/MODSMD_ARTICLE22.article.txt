# Hoover hosts economics laureate George Stigler

### JENNIFER ROSEN 
When asked for his reaction to
winning the 1982 Nobel prize in eco
nomics, George Stigler replied that
he experienced "the natural elation
that one always has when he sees
acts of justice that are performed."
The sharp-witted economist, who
jokes about not having been invited
to lunch with the queen, is spending
winter quarter at the Hoover Institu
tion. Serving as chairman of the
Domestic Studies Advisory Program,
Stigler has been a visiting scholar
from the University of Chicago at
Hoover for several years.
According to the Swedish
Academy of Sciences, Stigler won
the prize for his "seminal studies of
industrial structures, functioning of
markets and causes and effects of
public regulations." The 71-year
old economist is a member of the
Chicago School" of economics,
with its characteristically conserva
tive emphasis on monetarism, re
duced governments and free mar
kets.
As Stanford economics professor
Paul Evans said, "anyone in the world
who has ever met Stigler will tell you
that he is a very witty person." Ken
neth Arrow, himself a Nobel laureate
at Hoover, agreed, adding that
Stigler "is very quick at giving sharp
and pointed remarks that are not
necessarily pleasant for the person
on the other end."
Arrow went on to say that Stigler
has been "eye-opening" in a number
of economic fields. Most famed for
his pioneering work in the 1940s re

garding minimum wage laws and
rent controls, Stigler concluded that
government regulation often pro
duces far reaching and unintended
side effects.
Stigler's theory of "public choice"
is an analysis that suggests that the
behavior of government bureaucrats
is dictated by an effort to maximize
their own self interest. Similarly, his
theory on the "capture" of agencies
by the regulatory industry states that
regulators do not always serve the
public interest, but the very interests
which they are presumably trying to
regulate.
According to Arrow, Stigler's "il
luminating" work in the history of
economic thought has deeply influ
enced contemporary economic re
search. His insights have had such a
profound effect on the field that
"people can never again look at eco
nomics in the same way," Arrow
said.
Although Stigler's right wing poli
tics are indeed controversial, Evans
explained that since Stigler has never
been a "preacher," trying to influ
ence public opinion or policy, he has
not provoked any great controversy.
Stigler himself describes his schol
arly motives as being "not to preach,
but primarily to understand."
Stigler is currently working on the
problem of information in political
life. "The technical problem of what
society would really be like if it had
all the information necessary for an
intelligent vote," he said. Stigler said
he would like to solve the "puzzle"
of "how and why" the government
operates as it does, and on what

criteria it bases its decisions to act.
After reemphasizing the fact that
as a microeconomist he "does not
profess a great knowledge of the
macroeconomic field," Stigler went
on to say that he agreed with his col
leagues that the economy was "tak
ing a bump off the bottom" of a seri
ous depression.
Stigler said he believes that the
impending breakup of OPEC will
have "benevolent effects" on the
American economy, because
cheaper energy always improves the
standard of living in society. "I'll
even get a certain satisfaction out of
seeing some sheiks go into the bread
line," he joked.
Stigler denied the statement that
he was against government interven
tion by saying that he has "made no
proposals to abolish the federal gov
ernment," He explained that "many
deregulations should take place, and
many regulations should be done in
different ways." He cited the clean
air laws as examples of legislation
which he favors in theory, but not in
their present form.
Stigler said that he called President
Reagan's supply-side economics a
"gimmick" earlier in the year be
cause "anything that's three parts
political sloganeering, and maybe
one or two parts common sense, will
not add up to a coherent or persua
sive economic theory. The belief that
by unshackling production, which
I'm all in favor of doing, you could
take care of inflation seems bizarre
on its face, with no academic basis
for support."

Describing his current connec
tions with the Reagan administra
tion, Stigler said "I'm going to send
them a lot of money in April. . . .foi
income tax."
Stigler, who described himself as
an "apolitical Republican," said he
views the presidential race as a "case
of alternatives. If they get George
Washington up and healthy again,
I'm going to vote for him, but I'd
have no trouble voting for Reagan up
to 15 or 20 times against someone
like Carter."
He also said that 95 percent of all
the "good economics" in the world
comes from the United States. Allow
ing for great economists in Europe
and Isreal, Stigler said "it's a fact of
life that we're the center, and that
countries that do not pay attention to
us are not really respectable." Stigler
attributed American domination of
the economic discipline to factor
such as our great wealth, extensive
educational opportunities and our
advanced quanititative research
methods. He said that because we
have a great diversity of economic
philosophies and approaches, there
is no danger of our becoming
"monolithic." "It's a perfectly good
world, especially if you live in
America,"he added.
Along with "natural elation," the
Nobel prize has also brought Stigler
some heartache. Describing the
number of lectures he has to give as
"horrifying," the economist/pioneer
said he is "running out of platitudes,
and may actually have to come up
with something original."
