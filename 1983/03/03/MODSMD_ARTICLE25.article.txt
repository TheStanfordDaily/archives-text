## An unbelievable Indonesian swashbuckler 
### STEVE VINEBERG 
Peter Weir's The Year of Living Dangerously has a
sensuousness that was missing trom his last film, Gal
lipoli; steeped in a gripping, exotic locale — Indonesia in
1965, in the last gasps of President Sukarno's regime — it
seizes the imagination the way a good Graham Greene
novel does, or the beginning of Conrad's Nostromo.
The heroes of this story (which Weir wrote with David
Williamson and C.|. Koch) are a pack of English-speaking
journalists struggling to break through the blockade of
discreet chatter — the crumbs Sukarno and his aides
throw to them — to the political realities of a country on
the brink of civil war, and incidentally competing among
themselves for scoops. Guy Hamilton (Mel Gibson), the
new boy in town, radios his reports back to his publisher
in Sydney; jill Bryant (Sigourney Weaver) is in the final
two weeks of her Jakarta assignment, after which she will
head happily home to London; and the ragtaggle as
sortment also includes a vulgar, competitive American,
PetefCurtis (Michael Murphy, in an uncomfortable per
formance), a rotund Englishman, Wally O'Sullivan (Noel
Ferrier, who resembles a P.G. Wodehouse character as
Ned Beatty might interpret him), and best of all, Billy
Kwan (played by a woman, Linda Hunt), a Chinese-
Australian photographer, a dwarf, who adopts Guy.
Employing his considerable local resources, the result of
his efforts to immerse himself in Jakartan politics and
Javanese culture, Billy tips Guy off to several hot stories
and shoots them for him.
Billy Kwan is the most fascinating creation in the
movie, and Linda Hunt makes him its emotional center,
too. Billy keeps files on all the people who enter his life,
and then imagines that he can control their destinies as if
they really were characters in a novel he's writing. He
sees Guy as his alter ego, or (to be more precise) a
handsome, full-sized version of what lies inside Billy; he
compares him to the most noble and complex of
the mythic figures in the Javanese shadow puppet
shows, the prince, and casts himself as the faithful
dwarf-servant. So he sets Guy in a heroic track, first
assisting him in becoming the most successful journalist
in the crew and then introducing him to Jill, whom he
himself wanted to marry; wide-eyed, he watches their
romance grow. Billy's tragedy is that his puppets refuse
to behave according to his will. A native woman he has
been giving money for food ignores his medical advice,
and her ailing son dies; Sukarno, whom he thought a
great humanist-patriot, disillusions him; and Guy
jeopardizes his relationship with Jill for a story. Furious,
betrayed, he screams at Guy, "I thought you were a man
of light. ... I created you!"
Mysticism, transcendent or foiled, rarely works in
movies (it didn't in Weir's the Last Wave, with its visio
nary aborigines dreaming of apocalyptic floods), and
Billy's manipulation games have a risky, peculiarly liter
ary quality — they might have been inspired by Borges'
stories. But the screenwriters provide him with a florid,
frontal style in his soliloquys that might very well belong
to a journalist who fancies himself a poet. ("Most of us
become children again when we walk into the slums of
Asia/' he says, describing Guy's response to the poor of
Jakarta, "and I watched you enter childhood, with its
opposite intensities . . .") And Linda Hunt has the wit
and the ingenuity to play him as a character out of Car
son McCullers rather than out of Borges. With his weird,
crushed face, which seems to fold upon itself as it
reaches back goward the ears like origami, his torn-up,
quivering voice in moments of emotional turmoil, and
his rapid shifts of expression (Billy is frighteningly em
pathlc, he shows the eerie, tragic intensity of McCullers'
trapped, futile, beautifully twisted dreamers. Linda Hunt
achieves the impossible in this performance: she makes
Billy's bizarre dream of self-completion through Guy
more and more horrifying while making Billy more and
more sympathetic — and she does it, somehow, without
, giving the impression that she's acting. I've never seen a
performance quite like this one (its quality is only one
; ; aspect of its singularity), that seems so interior that you
| want to call it presence rather than acting, and yet is
> infinitely more complex — it presupposes a kind of
M absorption into the character that goes beyond even
what the best self-effacing performers (like Robert De
Niro and Sissy Spacek) do. The closest comparison that
K; comes to mind is actually out of Carson McCullers: Julie
Harris as the 12-year-old Frankie Addams in the 1952 film
| of The Member of the Wedding.

The Year of Living Dangerously is a richly, vividly en
joyable movie, and yet if Linda Hunt weren't at its center,
I don't think it would have one at all. I know that people
have been moved by the glimpses of Jakartan slum dwel
lers, emaciated and disfigured by rickets and beri-beri,
just as I know many people who found Weir's portrait of
Australia's dying youth in Callipoli profoundly disturb
ing. But at the risk of sounding callous, I suggest that in
both cases it is the subject matter that affects audiences
and not Weir's technique at all — which, though
phenomenal, is basically cold. Suffering appears to dis
tance Weir; he wants to look at it aesthetically. So he sets
up intricate, painterly tableaux of wounded soldiers in
Callipoli and — with the help of that photographic
wizard he always collaborates with, Russell Boyd — mag
ical Indonesian slum sequences reminiscent of Hans
Christian Andersen. This approach places the agony of
these people at such a far remove from us that it is
trivialized, turned into local color for a swift, engrossing
narrative. There is nothing offensive in this (if there is,
novelists have been committing the same moral outrage
for a couple of centuries) but it undermines the serious
ness of the enterprise. When Curtis drives Guy into
Jakarta's red light district and a dozen whores storm the
car, competing for the sexual favors of the two men, we
think of how cleverly Weir staged the sequence and how
useful an image it presents of the degrading poverty into
which most of the city is mired, but we don't consider
looking away in pain and shame — as we do, say, in parts
of Pixote. When Billy watches the funeral rites per
formed on the child he has been striving to keep alive,
we may be struck by the beauty and delicacy of the

service but not moved by it, because Weir hasn't shown
us its emotional significance for the boy's mother —
ritual here is not displayed in its full context and suffused
with feeling, as it is, for example, in Irvin Kershner's
Return of a Man Called Horse or (to reach farther into
movie history) the semi-documentaries of Robert Flah
erty. It is merely theater — colorful, sweeping theater.
Weir has made a cinematic guess at what a Conrad novel
would be like without philosophy, without conviction.
There are stunning aerial shots of the Indonesian
countryside that look like a collage of layered slabs of
green glass, but perhaps the most vivid image in the
movie shows Guy lifting Billy on his shoulder so that he
can take pictures of rioters without being molested.
Weir has made these two men adventurer-heroes in a
wartime swashbuckler — Cary Grant and Sam Jaffe in a
latter-day Cunga Din. And, whatever he may have in
tended, this attitude is the most powerful distancing
strategy of all. The movie is full of glitter and dash, and
the romantic plot has the predictability of the hundreds
of adventure thrillers that preceded it, so we don't feel,
with Billy, that Guy has acted in bad faith by choosing the
story over Jill, because we know that he'll return to her in
the end. And indeed, the love scenes are as preposter
ous as those in Cunga Din —more so, because Weir
doesn't push them to the side the way George Stevens
did in that earlier film. Mel Gibson has never looked so
alert or done so much hard work on a character before,
and Sigourney Weaver finds an unusual, arresting phys
icality for Jill — a cool, almost languid plegance and a
self-consciousness bordering on narcissism. But when

they make love, they behave as unconvincingly as Billy's
puppets: he charges through a crowded ballroom and
shoves her onto the balcony to kiss her, and later he
drives through a roadblock and provokes the military
police stationed there into firing at his car, just so that he
can escort her to a deserted spot. Weir doesn't entertain
the possibility that Guy and (ill might be killed in the
course of this escapade; he treats it like highly charged
good fun. (Gibson comes off looking better in this pic
ture than Weaver, possibly because we can understand
what draws Guy to jill, whereas # Weir has directed
Weaver to be so icily glamorous that her involvement
with any man seems unlikely.)
These love scenes probably wouldn't convince a
junior high schooler, but they're definitely photogenic
— just as the paraders singing hymns of praise to their
native Indonesia are photogenic, or Guy's lakartan assis
tant Kumar (Bembol Roco), who accepts money from
Guy reluctantly to support his father, murmuring, "For
my father I'll play the beggar." It's as if Peter Weir had
assimilated all the old movies he'd ever seen with daring
journalist heroes and seething revolutions and feverish
romances in unlikely settings and compressed them into
one super-deluxe entertainment. What he has added are
his own seductive elusiveness — his suggestion that there
is more inside his movie than meets the eye (that used to
be the specialty of another gifted filmmaker, Nicolas
Roeg) when in fact there is a great deal less — and, in a
casting stroke of genius, Linda Hunt. The results are
astonishing. You may not believe anything in The Year of
Living Dangerously except for her, but it's still a hell of a
movie.

of light. ... I created you!"
Mysticism, transcendent or foiled, rarely works in
movies (it didn't in Weir's the Last Wave, with its visio
nary aborigines dreaming of apocalyptic floods), and
Billy's manipulation games have a risky, peculiarly liter
ary quality — they might have been inspired by Borges'
stories. But the screenwriters provide him with a florid,
frontal style in his soliloquys that might very well belong
to a journalist who fancies himself a poet. ("Most of us
become children again when we walk into the slums of
Asia/' he says, describing Guy's response to the poor of
Jakarta, "and I watched you enter childhood, with its
opposite intensities . . .") And Linda Hunt has the wit
and the ingenuity to play him as a character out of Car
son McCullers rather than out of Borges. With his weird,
crushed face, which seems to fold upon itself as it
reaches back goward the ears like origami, his torn-up,
quivering voice in moments of emotional turmoil, and
his rapid shifts of expression (Billy is frighteningly em
pathlc, he shows the eerie, tragic intensity of McCullers'
trapped, futile, beautifully twisted dreamers. Linda Hunt
achieves the impossible in this performance: she makes
Billy's bizarre dream of self-completion through Guy
more and more horrifying while making Billy more and
more sympathetic — and she does it, somehow, without
, giving the impression that she's acting. I've never seen a
performance quite like this one (its quality is only one

what the best self-effacing performers (like Robert De

K; comes to mind is actually out of Carson McCullers: Julie
Harris as the 12-year-old Frankie Addams in the 1952 film
| of The Member of the Wedding.

The Year of Living Dangerously is a richly, vividly en
joyable movie, and yet if Linda Hunt weren't at its center,
I don't think it would have one at all. I know that people
have been moved by the glimpses of Jakartan slum dwel
lers, emaciated and disfigured by rickets and beri-beri,
just as I know many people who found Weir's portrait of
Australia's dying youth in Callipoli profoundly disturb
ing. But at the risk of sounding callous, I suggest that in
both cases it is the subject matter that affects audiences
and not Weir's technique at all — which, though
phenomenal, is basically cold. Suffering appears to dis
tance Weir; he wants to look at it aesthetically. So he sets
up intricate, painterly tableaux of wounded soldiers in
Callipoli and — with the help of that photographic
wizard he always collaborates with, Russell Boyd — mag
ical Indonesian slum sequences reminiscent of Hans
Christian Andersen. This approach places the agony of
these people at such a far remove from us that it is
trivialized, turned into local color for a swift, engrossing
narrative. There is nothing offensive in this (if there is,
novelists have been committing the same moral outrage
for a couple of centuries) but it undermines the serious
ness of the enterprise. When Curtis drives Guy into
Jakarta's red light district and a dozen whores storm the
car, competing for the sexual favors of the two men, we
think of how cleverly Weir staged the sequence and how
useful an image it presents of the degrading poverty into
which most of the city is mired, but we don't consider
looking away in pain and shame — as we do, say, in parts
of Pixote. When Billy watches the funeral rites per
formed on the child he has been striving to keep alive,
we may be struck by the beauty and delicacy of the

service but not moved by it, because Weir hasn't shown
us its emotional significance for the boy's mother —
ritual here is not displayed in its full context and suffused
with feeling, as it is, for example, in Irvin Kershner's
Return of a Man Called Horse or (to reach farther into
movie history) the semi-documentaries of Robert Flah
erty. It is merely theater — colorful, sweeping theater.
Weir has made a cinematic guess at what a Conrad novel
would be like without philosophy, without conviction.
There are stunning aerial shots of the Indonesian
countryside that look like a collage of layered slabs of
green glass, but perhaps the most vivid image in the
movie shows Guy lifting Billy on his shoulder so that he
can take pictures of rioters without being molested.
Weir has made these two men adventurer-heroes in a
wartime swashbuckler — Cary Grant and Sam Jaffe in a
latter-day Cunga Din. And, whatever he may have in
tended, this attitude is the most powerful distancing
strategy of all. The movie is full of glitter and dash, and
the romantic plot has the predictability of the hundreds
of adventure thrillers that preceded it, so we don't feel,
with Billy, that Guy has acted in bad faith by choosing the
story over Jill, because we know that he'll return to her in
the end. And indeed, the love scenes are as preposter
ous as those in Cunga Din —more so, because Weir
doesn't push them to the side the way George Stevens
did in that earlier film. Mel Gibson has never looked so
alert or done so much hard work on a character before,
and Sigourney Weaver finds an unusual, arresting phys
icality for Jill — a cool, almost languid plegance and a
self-consciousness bordering on narcissism. But when

they make love, they behave as unconvincingly as Billy's
puppets: he charges through a crowded ballroom and
shoves her onto the balcony to kiss her, and later he
drives through a roadblock and provokes the military
police stationed there into firing at his car, just so that he
can escort her to a deserted spot. Weir doesn't entertain
the possibility that Guy and (ill might be killed in the
course of this escapade; he treats it like highly charged
good fun. (Gibson comes off looking better in this pic
ture than Weaver, possibly because we can understand
what draws Guy to jill, whereas # Weir has directed
Weaver to be so icily glamorous that her involvement
with any man seems unlikely.)
These love scenes probably wouldn't convince a
junior high schooler, but they're definitely photogenic
— just as the paraders singing hymns of praise to their
native Indonesia are photogenic, or Guy's lakartan assis
tant Kumar (Bembol Roco), who accepts money from
Guy reluctantly to support his father, murmuring, "For
my father I'll play the beggar." It's as if Peter Weir had
assimilated all the old movies he'd ever seen with daring
journalist heroes and seething revolutions and feverish
romances in unlikely settings and compressed them into
one super-deluxe entertainment. What he has added are
his own seductive elusiveness — his suggestion that there
is more inside his movie than meets the eye (that used to
be the specialty of another gifted filmmaker, Nicolas
Roeg) when in fact there is a great deal less — and, in a
casting stroke of genius, Linda Hunt. The results are
astonishing. You may not believe anything in The Year of
Living Dangerously except for her, but it's still a hell of a
movie.


Mel Gibson and Sigourney Weaver in The Year of Living Dangerously
Peter Weir's The Year of Living Dangerously has a
sensuousness that was missing trom his last film, Gal
lipoli; steeped in a gripping, exotic locale — Indonesia in
1965, in the last gasps of President Sukarno's regime — it
seizes the imagination the way a good Graham Greene
novel does, or the beginning of Conrad's Nostromo.
The heroes of this story (which Weir wrote with David
Williamson and C.|. Koch) are a pack of English-speaking
journalists struggling to break through the blockade of
discreet chatter — the crumbs Sukarno and his aides
throw to them — to the political realities of a country on
the brink of civil war, and incidentally competing among
themselves for scoops. Guy Hamilton (Mel Gibson), the
new boy in town, radios his reports back to his publisher
in Sydney; jill Bryant (Sigourney Weaver) is in the final
two weeks of her Jakarta assignment, after which she will
head happily home to London; and the ragtaggle as
sortment also includes a vulgar, competitive American,
PetefCurtis (Michael Murphy, in an uncomfortable per
formance), a rotund Englishman, Wally O'Sullivan (Noel
Ferrier, who resembles a P.G. Wodehouse character as
Ned Beatty might interpret him), and best of all, Billy
Kwan (played by a woman, Linda Hunt), a Chinese-
Australian photographer, a dwarf, who adopts Guy.
Employing his considerable local resources, the result of
his efforts to immerse himself in Jakartan politics and
Javanese culture, Billy tips Guy off to several hot stories
and shoots them for him.
Billy Kwan is the most fascinating creation in the
movie, and Linda Hunt makes him its emotional center,
too. Billy keeps files on all the people who enter his life,
and then imagines that he can control their destinies as if
they really were characters in a novel he's writing. He
sees Guy as his alter ego, or (to be more precise) a
handsome, full-sized version of what lies inside Billy; he
compares him to the most noble and complex of
the mythic figures in the Javanese shadow puppet
shows, the prince, and casts himself as the faithful
dwarf-servant. So he sets Guy in a heroic track, first
assisting him in becoming the most successful journalist
in the crew and then introducing him to Jill, whom he
himself wanted to marry; wide-eyed, he watches their
romance grow. Billy's tragedy is that his puppets refuse
to behave according to his will. A native woman he has
been giving money for food ignores his medical advice,
and her ailing son dies; Sukarno, whom he thought a
great humanist-patriot, disillusions him; and Guy
jeopardizes his relationship with Jill for a story. Furious,
betrayed, he screams at Guy, "I thought you were a man
of light. ... I created you!"
Mysticism, transcendent or foiled, rarely works in

tance Weir; he wants to look at it aesthetically. So he sets
up intricate, painterly tableaux of wounded soldiers in
Callipoli and — with the help of that photographic
wizard he always collaborates with, Russell Boyd — mag
ical Indonesian slum sequences reminiscent of Hans
Christian Andersen. This approach places the agony of
these people at such a far remove from us that it is
trivialized, turned into local color for a swift, engrossing
narrative. There is nothing offensive in this (if there is,
novelists have been committing the same moral outrage
for a couple of centuries) but it undermines the serious
ness of the enterprise. When Curtis drives Guy into
Jakarta's red light district and a dozen whores storm the
car, competing for the sexual favors of the two men, we
think of how cleverly Weir staged the sequence and how
useful an image it presents of the degrading poverty into
which most of the city is mired, but we don't consider
looking away in pain and shame — as we do, say, in parts
of Pixote. When Billy watches the funeral rites per
formed on the child he has been striving to keep alive,
we may be struck by the beauty and delicacy of the

service but not moved by it, because Weir hasn't shown
us its emotional significance for the boy's mother —
ritual here is not displayed in its full context and suffused
with feeling, as it is, for example, in Irvin Kershner's
Return of a Man Called Horse or (to reach farther into
movie history) the semi-documentaries of Robert Flah
erty. It is merely theater — colorful, sweeping theater.
Weir has made a cinematic guess at what a Conrad novel
would be like without philosophy, without conviction.
There are stunning aerial shots of the Indonesian
countryside that look like a collage of layered slabs of
green glass, but perhaps the most vivid image in the
movie shows Guy lifting Billy on his shoulder so that he
can take pictures of rioters without being molested.
Weir has made these two men adventurer-heroes in a
wartime swashbuckler — Cary Grant and Sam Jaffe in a
latter-day Cunga Din. And, whatever he may have in
tended, this attitude is the most powerful distancing
strategy of all. The movie is full of glitter and dash, and
the romantic plot has the predictability of the hundreds
of adventure thrillers that preceded it, so we don't feel,
with Billy, that Guy has acted in bad faith by choosing the
story over Jill, because we know that he'll return to her in
the end. And indeed, the love scenes are as preposter
ous as those in Cunga Din —more so, because Weir
doesn't push them to the side the way George Stevens
did in that earlier film. Mel Gibson has never looked so
alert or done so much hard work on a character before,
and Sigourney Weaver finds an unusual, arresting phys
icality for Jill — a cool, almost languid plegance and a
self-consciousness bordering on narcissism. But when

they make love, they behave as unconvincingly as Billy's
puppets: he charges through a crowded ballroom and
shoves her onto the balcony to kiss her, and later he
drives through a roadblock and provokes the military
police stationed there into firing at his car, just so that he
can escort her to a deserted spot. Weir doesn't entertain
the possibility that Guy and (ill might be killed in the
course of this escapade; he treats it like highly charged
good fun. (Gibson comes off looking better in this pic
ture than Weaver, possibly because we can understand
what draws Guy to jill, whereas # Weir has directed
Weaver to be so icily glamorous that her involvement
with any man seems unlikely.)
These love scenes probably wouldn't convince a
junior high schooler, but they're definitely photogenic
— just as the paraders singing hymns of praise to their
native Indonesia are photogenic, or Guy's lakartan assis
tant Kumar (Bembol Roco), who accepts money from
Guy reluctantly to support his father, murmuring, "For
my father I'll play the beggar." It's as if Peter Weir had
assimilated all the old movies he'd ever seen with daring
journalist heroes and seething revolutions and feverish
romances in unlikely settings and compressed them into
one super-deluxe entertainment. What he has added are
his own seductive elusiveness — his suggestion that there
is more inside his movie than meets the eye (that used to
be the specialty of another gifted filmmaker, Nicolas
Roeg) when in fact there is a great deal less — and, in a
casting stroke of genius, Linda Hunt. The results are
astonishing. You may not believe anything in The Year of
Living Dangerously except for her, but it's still a hell of a
movie.


Mel Gibson and Sigourney Weaver in The Year of Living Dangerously
Peter Weir's The Year of Living Dangerously has a
sensuousness that was missing trom his last film, Gal
lipoli; steeped in a gripping, exotic locale — Indonesia in
1965, in the last gasps of President Sukarno's regime — it
seizes the imagination the way a good Graham Greene
novel does, or the beginning of Conrad's Nostromo.
The heroes of this story (which Weir wrote with David
Williamson and C.|. Koch) are a pack of English-speaking
journalists struggling to break through the blockade of
discreet chatter — the crumbs Sukarno and his aides
throw to them — to the political realities of a country on
the brink of civil war, and incidentally competing among
themselves for scoops. Guy Hamilton (Mel Gibson), the
new boy in town, radios his reports back to his publisher
in Sydney; jill Bryant (Sigourney Weaver) is in the final
two weeks of her Jakarta assignment, after which she will
head happily home to London; and the ragtaggle as
sortment also includes a vulgar, competitive American,
PetefCurtis (Michael Murphy, in an uncomfortable per
formance), a rotund Englishman, Wally O'Sullivan (Noel
Ferrier, who resembles a P.G. Wodehouse character as
Ned Beatty might interpret him), and best of all, Billy
Kwan (played by a woman, Linda Hunt), a Chinese-
Australian photographer, a dwarf, who adopts Guy.
Employing his considerable local resources, the result of
his efforts to immerse himself in Jakartan politics and
Javanese culture, Billy tips Guy off to several hot stories
and shoots them for him.
Billy Kwan is the most fascinating creation in the
movie, and Linda Hunt makes him its emotional center,
too. Billy keeps files on all the people who enter his life,
and then imagines that he can control their destinies as if
they really were characters in a novel he's writing. He
sees Guy as his alter ego, or (to be more precise) a
handsome, full-sized version of what lies inside Billy; he
compares him to the most noble and complex of
the mythic figures in the Javanese shadow puppet
shows, the prince, and casts himself as the faithful
dwarf-servant. So he sets Guy in a heroic track, first
assisting him in becoming the most successful journalist
in the crew and then introducing him to Jill, whom he
himself wanted to marry; wide-eyed, he watches their
romance grow. Billy's tragedy is that his puppets refuse
to behave according to his will. A native woman he has
been giving money for food ignores his medical advice,
and her ailing son dies; Sukarno, whom he thought a
great humanist-patriot, disillusions him; and Guy
jeopardizes his relationship with Jill for a story. Furious,
betrayed, he screams at Guy, "I thought you were a man
of light. ... I created you!"
Mysticism, transcendent or foiled, rarely works in
movies (it didn't in Weir's the Last Wave, with its visio
nary aborigines dreaming of apocalyptic floods), and
Billy's manipulation games have a risky, peculiarly liter
ary quality — they might have been inspired by Borges'
stories. But the screenwriters provide him with a florid,
frontal style in his soliloquys that might very well belong
to a journalist who fancies himself a poet. ("Most of us
become children again when we walk into the slums of
Asia/' he says, describing Guy's response to the poor of
Jakarta, "and I watched you enter childhood, with its
opposite intensities . . .") And Linda Hunt has the wit
and the ingenuity to play him as a character out of Car
son McCullers rather than out of Borges. With his weird,
crushed face, which seems to fold upon itself as it
reaches back goward the ears like origami, his torn-up,
quivering voice in moments of emotional turmoil, and
his rapid shifts of expression (Billy is frighteningly em
pathlc, he shows the eerie, tragic intensity of McCullers'
trapped, futile, beautifully twisted dreamers. Linda Hunt
achieves the impossible in this performance: she makes
Billy's bizarre dream of self-completion through Guy
more and more horrifying while making Billy more and
more sympathetic — and she does it, somehow, without
, giving the impression that she's acting. I've never seen a
performance quite like this one (its quality is only one
; ; aspect of its singularity), that seems so interior that you
| want to call it presence rather than acting, and yet is
> infinitely more complex — it presupposes a kind of
M absorption into the character that goes beyond even
what the best self-effacing performers (like Robert De
Niro and Sissy Spacek) do. The closest comparison that
K; comes to mind is actually out of Carson McCullers: Julie
Harris as the 12-year-old Frankie Addams in the 1952 film
| of The Member of the Wedding.

The Year of Living Dangerously is a richly, vividly en
joyable movie, and yet if Linda Hunt weren't at its center,
I don't think it would have one at all. I know that people
have been moved by the glimpses of Jakartan slum dwel
lers, emaciated and disfigured by rickets and beri-beri,
just as I know many people who found Weir's portrait of
Australia's dying youth in Callipoli profoundly disturb
ing. But at the risk of sounding callous, I suggest that in
both cases it is the subject matter that affects audiences
and not Weir's technique at all — which, though
phenomenal, is basically cold. Suffering appears to dis
tance Weir; he wants to look at it aesthetically. So he sets
up intricate, painterly tableaux of wounded soldiers in
Callipoli and — with the help of that photographic
