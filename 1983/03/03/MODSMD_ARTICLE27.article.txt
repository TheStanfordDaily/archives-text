THRILLER
Michael Jackson
Epic Records
By JIFF SANTOSUOSSO
."The Girl is Mine" is a per
fect example of the problem
inherent in releasing singles
ferpop albums. Any song with
ttte lyrics "The girl is mine . . .
yep she's mine . . . the dog
gone girl is mine" is going to
have a tough time convincing
people that the album that con
tains it is anything more than a

collection of marginal wheez
ings from a wimpy pop
monger. The song is a critic's
dream â€” it allows him to un
leash every derogatory phrase
that he has ever heard.
But Thriller, the album that
tries to hide this exercise in
idiocy, is a strong personal
statement from a thoughtful,
sensitive man. Really, it is.
Side two's mature lyrics
overcome most of the self
indulgent pop and funk of its

nemesis on the flip. Believe it
or not, Michael Jackson is not
wholly concerned with jump
ing happily around on some
dance floor. He is a serious,
sometimes paranoid and even
misanthropic man.
"You have to show them that
you're really not scared/ You're
playin' with your life, this ain't
no truth or dare/ They'll kick
you, then they'll beat you/
Then they'll tell you it's fair,"
he urges on "Beat It," a song

that has been getting as much
publicity as Diet Coke.
Jackson is so paranoid that
he rarely leaves his house. Be
sides Diana Ross and Quincy
Jones, his few friends include a
llama, a boa constrictor, a coc
katoo and a bevy of manikins.
And why not? The last time
he went out and spent some
time on a dance floor, he found
himself slapped in the face
with a paternity suit. He re
sponds quite acerbically, "Bil

lie Jean is not my lover/ She's
just a girl who claims that I am
the one/ But the kid is not my
son." How is that for addres
sing the issue?
And yet, the song is as
rhythmically and melodically
consonant and pleasing as
rainfall. The alley-way bassline
and snapping drums add up to
a rhythm that is guaranteed to
get your blood up (unless you
have made some sort of
hematological history).

Jackson's desperate, aspirated
vocals and overdubs glide
through the song, making it
even smoother. He cannot get
away from the talent that has
been responsible for all his
problems in the first place.
Jackson follows this legal
plea with "Human Nature," a
song that rivals anything ever
recorded by Stevie Nicks or
Joni Mitchell in its dreaminess.
To end the side, "The Lady in
My Life" combines smooth Lou

Rawls-type vocals with lush
Stevie Wonder-type instru
mental fills.
Jackson is almost trapped in
his own idiom.
But just when one thinks that
he is the same Michael Jackson
of Off the Wall fame (re
member "Don't Stop 'Til You
Get Enough?"), he hits with
"Beat It."
Here, Jackson assumes the
same role that Hall and Oates
are attempting with songs like
"Maneater." He is bridging the
black/white musical gap. And
that is why the musical world is
hailing the song.
The typical "black" synth
esizers weave in and out of the
typical "white" guitar-laden
rhythm drone. The song be
gins with the unmistakable
Santana riff from "All I Ever
Wanted Was To Be With You"
and drives into an Eddie Van
Halen solo. This cameo offers
the best of Van Halen's intro
work to "Oh, Pretty Woman,"
minus the fuzz and distortion.
All of this backdrop is stamped
once more with Jackson's
sweet vocal.
The song may not be enough
to convert Def Leppard fans to
Marvin Caye and Kool and the
Gang afficionados to Iron
Maiden, but it is a good place
to start.
But then there is the ines
capable "The Girl is Mine" and
the lesser-publicized, but
equally ridiculous "P.Y.T.
(Pretty Young Thing)." Which
lyrics are more ridiculous:
"The doggone girl is mine"
from the former, or "Let me
take you to the max" from the
latter? Does it matter?
Why did Jackson choose
Toto to back most of his songs?
Haven't they proved them
selves generic enough with
songs like "Rosanna"?
If Thriller were an EP with the
title cut, "Beat It," "Billie Jean"
and "Human Nature," it would
be first class. But if the EP con
tained the five other songs (not
worth repeating), it would de
serve to be heaved in the bag
gage compartment.
But music is music. Michael
Jackson is not Roger Waters or
Bruce Springsteen, and he
does not pretend to be. What
he is is a hurt, frightened man
with one of the sweetest voices
and one of the most satisfying
ears for music in the enter
tainment industry.
