# 'Dance in Performance:' an evening of abstract enjoyment
## 
### CHRISTINA LEPNIS 
Stanford's Dance Week '83 culminated
with two evenings of performance showcas
ing the work of current dance faculty, alum
nae and their friends. Aptly titled "Dance in
Performance, Faculty and Friends," the
series of offerings again demonstrated that
one can have an enjoyable spectating ex
perience without being particularly thrilled
or enthralled.
Saturday evening's program began with
John Goodwin's three-part Seaside Studies,
an abstract encounter with coast-associated
elements and scenery. The attractive and
highly imagistic subheadings were crucial to
revealing Goodwin's visual aims. "Buoy,"
the least interesting, succeeded in enacting
a few ripples but barely stayed afloat with its
bland utilization of sequenced moves and
variation in tempos.
Things improved with "Willows," a
sinewy duet of two women in long gowns.
As lone figures they stood rooted in a far

corner of the stage, the emphasis being on
their bare, luxurious arms as they gestured,
swayed, and traced smooth curves on the
floor with each breath or wind.
"Beacon," a two-couple, Pilobolus-esque
intricacy and probable ancestor to Good
win's later hypnotic piece, "Sleeping
Sonata," was not without ideas. I admired
some of the precarious balances and the in
ventive weaving of bodies, as well as the
choice of a Williams sound score ("music
nouveau" to some). The elegantly colored,
striped and abstract design of the unitard
costumes gave a reptilian effect, and rather
than being reminded of lighthouses or sum
moning beams of light during the frequent
moments of stillness, I instead saw iguanas
perched on their rocks in a staring, menac
ing lethargy. Throughout, the slow, steady
movement conjured the surreptitious and
often eerie conduct that characterizes re
ptiles. The effectiveness of the piece in total
was somewhat compromised by its length.

Had the final third vividly departed from or
built upon the preceding two-thirds, the en
ding might not have become such an antici
pated occasion.
Goodwin's next work, a duet from Dances
for a Mad King, was an inane little diversion,
harmless and unobtrusive enough. It was all
in fun anyway, certainly not self-conscious,
and perhaps left a portion of the audience
with a half-smile. Diane Freccero and J.|.
Morris entered scrambling on all fours, an
terior side up, and laughing hysterically.
From then on, it was a brief matter of a few
antics.
By far the most unusual and watchable
cleverness of the evening was Incipient
Stages, choreographed and performed by
Jancy Limpert. In a red quilted suit and
skullcap, she portrayed a disoriented,
primordial creature with marvelously odd
quirks and a whimsical deportment. The iso
lated movements of body parts and muscles

were skillfully performed as were the alter
nations between flow and agitation, awk
ward struts and puppet-like springs. The Re
naissance compositions played with tradi
tional instrumentation by the New York Pro
Musica provided heightened appeal simply
by virtue of their noncontextual use. The
piece closed with the dear, untutored being
marching toward a beckoning and inevitable
complexity.
Diane Freccero's Con-si-der-ation, was a
pleasing quartet that managed to reflect the
astral sense of its Latin title. The dancing was
agile and sparkling, the use of space nicely
conceived.

drew its main strength from the musicians'
ability to surrender to one another for stimu
lation while maintaining individual control
and the freedom to make independent
choices. It would be impossible to describe

all the variations they came upon, but each
transitory phase was marked by character
and humor.
Leslee Lewis' solo Solitaire took on a more
abstract and distant quality than it had in its
first performance last November. Though
the original music by Ravi/Menuhin re
mained, Lewis' Indian costume was
simplified, suggesting a conscious decision
to dilute the Eastern motif. The effortless
ness of the motion and the attention to ges
ture as a valuable tool carried the piece, but I
yearned for that missing trace of the exotic.

frolic to music by the Talking Heads was as
neatly and dexterously choreographed as
ever, but it lacked the cheeky spontaneity
of its previous performances. This is not to

one can have an enjoyable spectating ex
perience without being particularly thrilled
or enthralled.
Saturday evening's program began with
John Goodwin's three-part Seaside Studies,
an abstract encounter with coast-associated
elements and scenery. The attractive and
highly imagistic subheadings were crucial to
revealing Goodwin's visual aims. "Buoy,"
the least interesting, succeeded in enacting
a few ripples but barely stayed afloat with its
bland utilization of sequenced moves and
variation in tempos.
Things improved with "Willows," a
sinewy duet of two women in long gowns.
As lone figures they stood rooted in a far

corner of the stage, the emphasis being on
their bare, luxurious arms as they gestured,
swayed, and traced smooth curves on the
floor with each breath or wind.
"Beacon," a two-couple, Pilobolus-esque
intricacy and probable ancestor to Good
win's later hypnotic piece, "Sleeping
Sonata," was not without ideas. I admired
some of the precarious balances and the in
ventive weaving of bodies, as well as the
choice of a Williams sound score ("music
nouveau" to some). The elegantly colored,
striped and abstract design of the unitard
costumes gave a reptilian effect, and rather
than being reminded of lighthouses or sum
moning beams of light during the frequent
moments of stillness, I instead saw iguanas
perched on their rocks in a staring, menac
ing lethargy. Throughout, the slow, steady
movement conjured the surreptitious and
often eerie conduct that characterizes re
ptiles. The effectiveness of the piece in total
was somewhat compromised by its length.

Had the final third vividly departed from or
built upon the preceding two-thirds, the en
ding might not have become such an antici
pated occasion.
Goodwin's next work, a duet from Dances
for a Mad King, was an inane little diversion,
harmless and unobtrusive enough. It was all
in fun anyway, certainly not self-conscious,
and perhaps left a portion of the audience
with a half-smile. Diane Freccero and J.|.
Morris entered scrambling on all fours, an
terior side up, and laughing hysterically.
From then on, it was a brief matter of a few
antics.
By far the most unusual and watchable
cleverness of the evening was Incipient
Stages, choreographed and performed by
Jancy Limpert. In a red quilted suit and
skullcap, she portrayed a disoriented,
primordial creature with marvelously odd
quirks and a whimsical deportment. The iso
lated movements of body parts and muscles

were skillfully performed as were the alter
nations between flow and agitation, awk
ward struts and puppet-like springs. The Re
naissance compositions played with tradi
tional instrumentation by the New York Pro
Musica provided heightened appeal simply
by virtue of their noncontextual use. The
piece closed with the dear, untutored being
marching toward a beckoning and inevitable
complexity.
Diane Freccero's Con-si-der-ation, was a
pleasing quartet that managed to reflect the
astral sense of its Latin title. The dancing was
agile and sparkling, the use of space nicely
conceived.
journey 11, an episode of improvisational
collaboration between harpsichordist John
Toenjes and cellist Gwendolyn Watson,
drew its main strength from the musicians'
ability to surrender to one another for stimu
lation while maintaining individual control
and the freedom to make independent
choices. It would be impossible to describe

all the variations they came upon, but each
transitory phase was marked by character
and humor.
Leslee Lewis' solo Solitaire took on a more
abstract and distant quality than it had in its
first performance last November. Though
the original music by Ravi/Menuhin re
mained, Lewis' Indian costume was
simplified, suggesting a conscious decision
to dilute the Eastern motif. The effortless
ness of the motion and the attention to ges
ture as a valuable tool carried the piece, but I
yearned for that missing trace of the exotic.
and in books. . . ~ in its third showing at
Stanford, was immensely popular when it
debuted. Julienne Weston's sharp and zesty
frolic to music by the Talking Heads was as
neatly and dexterously choreographed as
ever, but it lacked the cheeky spontaneity
of its previous performances. This is not to
say that it has fallen flat, but if it were a
balloon, it would appear to have lost a little
helium.
