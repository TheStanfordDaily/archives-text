# Fee assessment in question
## BSU denied approval 
### JEFF BIDDULPH Senior staff writer 
In a tense meeting which climaxed
when representatives of the Black
Student Union (BSU) stormed out of
the room, the ASSU Senate last night
denied approval for the BSU to ap
pear on this spring's fee assessment
ballot.
The senate approved the Leland
Stanford lunior University Marching
Band, which had been denied ap
proval at last week's regular senate
meeting, thus making the BSU the
only one of 14 student organizations
to be denied approval.
Organizations which are approved
by the senate need to gather peti
tions signed by 10 percent of the stu
dent body, while those which are not
approved need to gather the signa

tures of 20 percent of the student
body. However, the ASSU also de
cided to extend the deadline by
which the organizations must gather
the signatures from tomorrow to
March 11.
According to Band Manager Gary
Robinson, the Band had already ac
quired 3000 signatures — more than
the necessary 20 percent — on its
petitions to be on the fee assessment
ballot.
The BSU fell one vote short of ap
proval. Approval was denied by a
10-3 vote in which a total of 11 "yes"
votes were needed.
Four of the 13 senators passed dur
ing the first round of voting, with
only Roland Van Gaalen voting "no."
Of those four, two — |im McGrath
and Roc Blumenthal — joined Van
Gaalen in issuing negative votes.
McGrath was the last senator to
vote, as he was in a controversial vote
on whether to approve former Rep.
Paul "Pete" McCloskey as a guest
professor here last week, and his
vote followed a last minute plea from
Council of Presidents member Mark
Epstein that it be affirmative.
"Jim, I plead with you to put this on
the ballot," Epstein said. McGrath
then cast his negative vote.
Soon after the exchange, two rep
resentatives of the BSU, Rhonda
Trotter and Leslie Talbot, and Band
Manager Robinson, as well as ASSU
Senators Jackie Johnson and David
Porter, left the meeting.
Asked why the senators had voted
"no" on the BSU, Johnson answered
that it was "because they're racists."

Blumenthal answered Johnson's
claims by saying that "those people
who call other people racists are
generally racists themselves."
Blumenthal said he had cast a
negative vote on the organization
because the group does not have
strong student support and it would
be disastrous for the BSU if it is voted
down on the fee assessment ballot.
He said it would be the first time the
BSU had applied to be on the ballot
and added that the group, which has
been funded by the University until
now, could lose University funding
by being voted down this spring.
McCrath said he voted no on the
BSU because it would be "depend
ing on the fee assessment for
money."
Porter said in the meeting that the
BSU was applying for a fee assess
ment because it now has to spend
extensive time trying to collect
money.
