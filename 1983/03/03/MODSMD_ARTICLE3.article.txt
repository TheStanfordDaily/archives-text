# Fee assessment in question
## BSU denied approval 
### JEFF BIDDULPH Senior staff writer 
In a tense meeting which climaxed
when representatives of the Black
Student Union (BSU) stormed out of
the room, the ASSU Senate last night
denied approval for the BSU to ap
pear on this spring's fee assessment
ballot.
The senate approved the Leland
Stanford lunior University Marching
Band, which had been denied ap
proval at last week's regular senate
meeting, thus making the BSU the
only one of 14 student organizations
to be denied approval.
Organizations which are approved
by the senate need to gather peti
tions signed by 10 percent of the stu
dent body, while those which are not
approved need to gather the signa

tures of 20 percent of the student
body. However, the ASSU also de
cided to extend the deadline by
which the organizations must gather
the signatures from tomorrow to
March 11.
According to Band Manager Gary
Robinson, the Band had already ac
quired 3000 signatures — more than
the necessary 20 percent — on its
petitions to be on the fee assessment
ballot.
The BSU fell one vote short of ap
proval. Approval was denied by a
10-3 vote in which a total of 11 "yes"
votes were needed.
Four of the 13 senators passed dur
ing the first round of voting, with
only Roland Van Gaalen voting "no."
Of those four, two — |im McGrath
