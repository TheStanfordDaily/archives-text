U.S. may deepen Salvadoran tie
Washington — The Reagan administration, seeking
ways to reverse a deteriorating military situation in El
Salvador, isconsidering allowing U.S. military advisers
to operate closer to Salvadoran government troops in
the field. , ,,
Officials stress that such a move, long advocated by
U.S. military specialists, would not involve any com
bat role or going on operations with government
forces against leftist guerrillas.
But it would allow some U.S. advisers to operate at a
brigade headquarters or provincial command center
in the countryside, where they might havo greater in
fluence over troops they have helped train and, per
haps more important, over the Salvadoran field com

manders.
American officials say they believe that poor lead
ership by some field commanders, especially those
who are political appointees, is a major factor in the
generally lackluster performance of the Salvadoran
army.
Thus far, the U.S. advisers, 37 of whom are now in El
Salvador, have been restricted to the capital city of
San Salvador, except for occasional quick journeys
into the field.
Index shows recession over
Washington — The government's major economic
barometer, showing its most dramatic one-month im-
provement in 33 years, pointed clearly yesterday
toward a solid and sustained recovery from recession.
The Department of Commerce said its closely
watched index of leading indicators soared 3.6 per
cent in January, the largest monthly advance since the
4.1 percent in July 1950. In addition, another index de
signed to reflect current economicconditionsrose by
a significant 0.6 percent.
Government and private economists agreed that
the latest figures confirmed that the recession was
over and the recovery was off to a good start, earlier
than most forecasters had expected.
President Reagan, who was in Santa Barbara, issued
a statement saying that the report "flashed a bright
green light for recovery .... Our great national strug
gle to make this economy well again is beginning to
pay off."
Secretary of Commerce Malcolm Baldrige, while
saying that the index was a "highly favorable" signal,
cautioned that it did not indicate a boom was at hand.
Favorable winter weather helped housing con
struction, Baldrige noted, while a changeover to new
forms of money market deposits caused an unusual
January bulge in the nation's money supply.
"There has never been a gain in the leading index
this large without an economic recovery," Baldrige
said in a statement.
Bush disputes Catholic position
Washington — Vice President Bush, on the eve of
Pope John Paul ll's visit to Central America, has be
come the second high administration official in two
days to express concern over the support that Catho
lic clergymen are giving Marxist revolution in places
like El Salvador.
Bush on Tuesday told a private forum of prominent
former officials and opinion leaders from North and
South America — a group that included Notre Dame's
president, the Rev. Theodore Hesburgh — that he is
unable to understand how priests can reconcile their
faith with Marxist ideas and tactics.
His remarks prompted Hesburgh to reply that the
endemic poverty and social injustice of the region can
easily lead priests to make common cause with Marx
ists or anyone else seeking to change the established
order.
The administration in recent days has reiterated its
determination to pursue a military solution to the
Salvadoran civil war and has rejected anew the alter
native, advocated by many churchmen, of trying to
negotiate a political settlement with the insurgents
there.
Science/math bill passed
Washington— Warned of a "crisis" in science and
math education, the House overwhelmingly passed a
five-year $1.1 billion bill yesterday aimed at giving
U.S. industry and the military the brains tocompete in
the high-technology age.
The vote was 348 to 54, with 100 Republicans joining
all 248 Democrats who voted in supporting the bill.
Sponsors, citing severe teacher shortages, declin
ing student achievement and fewer graduating scien
tists and technicians, said the situation "is not unlike
the crisis our country faced in 1957 when the Soviets'
j Sputnik launch brought to a head concerns over
mathematics, science and technical preparation."
In 1958, Congress responded with the National De
fense Education Act. Yesterday, sponsors called the
Emergency Mathematics and Science Education Act a
"first step" toward renewing the federal commitment
of the 19505.
MX substitute considered
Washington — The Pentagon's research director
yesterday gave further impetus to the idea of sub
stituting a small mobile missile for the big MX by
saying that such a switch would be feasible "from a
technical standpoint."
Richard DeLauer, in testimony before the House
Armed Services subcommittee on research and de

velopment, did not formally endorse turning away
from the MX and deploying the smaller missile, but
his remarks could encourage those who want to do
so.
President Reagan's MX commission, headed by
Brent Scowcroft, is studying the small missile as an al
ternative to the beleaguered MX, but has not made a
recommendation.
DeLauer said one question about a smaller missile is
whether it could survive a Soviet first strike, and an
other is whether it could achieve the same accuracy as
missiles fired from silos or other stationary shelters.
Lebanese baffled by Israel
Beirut, Lebanon — Lebanese officials expressed
bewilderment yesterday at they described as re
newed intransigence by Israel after nearly two weeks
of progress in negotiations for the withdrawal of Is
raeli soldiers from Lebanon.
The Lebanese said the new attitude was apparent at
the Israeli-Lebanese negotiating session Tuesday in a
Beirut suburb, at which an Israeli negotiator read a
prepared statement expressing "disappointment"
with Lebanon's latest proposal on future relations
with Israel.
"There was no one stumbling block," said one Leb
anese source. "There was a mood of intransigence.
We heard many things coming back again that we
thought were settled."
Earlier this week sources here, expressing optimism
about the talks, disclosed that Israel and Lebanon had
reached tentative agreement on some of the principal
issues that had long stalled negotiations.
The Lebanese were apparently referring to the re
sults of marathon sessions here last week in which
U.S. special envoy Philip Habib and Lebanese Presi
dent Amin Gemayel put into writing issues on which
there had been oral agreement in previous nego
tiating sessions.
New UC president announced
Berkeley — David Gardner, president of the Uni
versity of Utah, yesterday was named president of the
University of California, a nine-campus system he
characterized as "one of civilization's truly great
achievements."
The 49-year-old educator has been a student,
teacher and administrator at UC. He will be paid
$150,000 annually, an increase of $56,000 over the
wages paid his predecessor, David Saxon, who will
become chairman of the corporation in charge of the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
The University of California, with 140,000 students
and a 1982-83 budget of $4.3 billion, is one of the most
respected universities in the world.
China's leader retiring
Peking — Marshal Ye Jianying, 85, who as chairman
of the National People's Congress is China's head of
state, formally announced yesterday that he would
not continue in the post when a new congress is
elected this spring.
Ye's retirement, expected for six months, will help
in the effort to rejuvenate the aged Chinese leader
ship through the promotion of younger persons to
top national posts. As long as Ye remained, however
sick and feeble, reformers found it difficult to per
suade men in their 60s and 70s to step aside.
Stocks set more records
Stock prices rose in heavy trading yesterday, reaching
record highs for the second straight day.
The market drew some fresh encouragement from
the news that the index of leading economic in
dicators jumped 3.6 percent in January.

Decreasing showers today. Highs in the 50s with

Officials stress that such a move, long advocated by
U.S. military specialists, would not involve any com
bat role or going on operations with government
forces against leftist guerrillas.
But it would allow some U.S. advisers to operate at a
brigade headquarters or provincial command center
in the countryside, where they might havo greater in
fluence over troops they have helped train and, per
haps more important, over the Salvadoran field com

manders.
American officials say they believe that poor lead
ership by some field commanders, especially those

Thus far, the U.S. advisers, 37 of whom are now in El

Index shows recession over
Washington — The government's major economic
barometer, showing its most dramatic one-month im-
provement in 33 years, pointed clearly yesterday
toward a solid and sustained recovery from recession.
The Department of Commerce said its closely
watched index of leading indicators soared 3.6 per
cent in January, the largest monthly advance since the
4.1 percent in July 1950. In addition, another index de
signed to reflect current economicconditionsrose by
a significant 0.6 percent.
Government and private economists agreed that
the latest figures confirmed that the recession was
over and the recovery was off to a good start, earlier
than most forecasters had expected.
President Reagan, who was in Santa Barbara, issued
a statement saying that the report "flashed a bright
green light for recovery .... Our great national strug
gle to make this economy well again is beginning to
pay off."
Secretary of Commerce Malcolm Baldrige, while
saying that the index was a "highly favorable" signal,
cautioned that it did not indicate a boom was at hand.
Favorable winter weather helped housing con
struction, Baldrige noted, while a changeover to new
forms of money market deposits caused an unusual
January bulge in the nation's money supply.
"There has never been a gain in the leading index
this large without an economic recovery," Baldrige
said in a statement.
Bush disputes Catholic position
Washington — Vice President Bush, on the eve of
Pope John Paul ll's visit to Central America, has be
come the second high administration official in two
days to express concern over the support that Catho
lic clergymen are giving Marxist revolution in places
like El Salvador.
Bush on Tuesday told a private forum of prominent
former officials and opinion leaders from North and
South America — a group that included Notre Dame's
president, the Rev. Theodore Hesburgh — that he is
unable to understand how priests can reconcile their
faith with Marxist ideas and tactics.
His remarks prompted Hesburgh to reply that the
endemic poverty and social injustice of the region can
easily lead priests to make common cause with Marx
ists or anyone else seeking to change the established
order.
The administration in recent days has reiterated its
determination to pursue a military solution to the
Salvadoran civil war and has rejected anew the alter
native, advocated by many churchmen, of trying to
negotiate a political settlement with the insurgents
there.
Science/math bill passed
Washington— Warned of a "crisis" in science and
math education, the House overwhelmingly passed a
five-year $1.1 billion bill yesterday aimed at giving
U.S. industry and the military the brains tocompete in
the high-technology age.
The vote was 348 to 54, with 100 Republicans joining
all 248 Democrats who voted in supporting the bill.
Sponsors, citing severe teacher shortages, declin
ing student achievement and fewer graduating scien
tists and technicians, said the situation "is not unlike
the crisis our country faced in 1957 when the Soviets'
j Sputnik launch brought to a head concerns over
mathematics, science and technical preparation."
In 1958, Congress responded with the National De
fense Education Act. Yesterday, sponsors called the
Emergency Mathematics and Science Education Act a
"first step" toward renewing the federal commitment
of the 19505.
MX substitute considered
Washington — The Pentagon's research director
yesterday gave further impetus to the idea of sub
stituting a small mobile missile for the big MX by
saying that such a switch would be feasible "from a
technical standpoint."
Richard DeLauer, in testimony before the House
Armed Services subcommittee on research and de

velopment, did not formally endorse turning away
from the MX and deploying the smaller missile, but
his remarks could encourage those who want to do
so.
President Reagan's MX commission, headed by
Brent Scowcroft, is studying the small missile as an al
ternative to the beleaguered MX, but has not made a
recommendation.
DeLauer said one question about a smaller missile is
whether it could survive a Soviet first strike, and an
other is whether it could achieve the same accuracy as
missiles fired from silos or other stationary shelters.
Lebanese baffled by Israel
Beirut, Lebanon — Lebanese officials expressed
bewilderment yesterday at they described as re
newed intransigence by Israel after nearly two weeks
of progress in negotiations for the withdrawal of Is
raeli soldiers from Lebanon.
The Lebanese said the new attitude was apparent at
the Israeli-Lebanese negotiating session Tuesday in a
Beirut suburb, at which an Israeli negotiator read a
prepared statement expressing "disappointment"
with Lebanon's latest proposal on future relations
with Israel.
"There was no one stumbling block," said one Leb
anese source. "There was a mood of intransigence.
We heard many things coming back again that we
thought were settled."
Earlier this week sources here, expressing optimism
about the talks, disclosed that Israel and Lebanon had
reached tentative agreement on some of the principal
issues that had long stalled negotiations.
The Lebanese were apparently referring to the re
sults of marathon sessions here last week in which
U.S. special envoy Philip Habib and Lebanese Presi
dent Amin Gemayel put into writing issues on which
there had been oral agreement in previous nego
tiating sessions.
New UC president announced
Berkeley — David Gardner, president of the Uni
versity of Utah, yesterday was named president of the
University of California, a nine-campus system he
characterized as "one of civilization's truly great
achievements."
The 49-year-old educator has been a student,
teacher and administrator at UC. He will be paid
$150,000 annually, an increase of $56,000 over the
wages paid his predecessor, David Saxon, who will
become chairman of the corporation in charge of the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
The University of California, with 140,000 students
and a 1982-83 budget of $4.3 billion, is one of the most
respected universities in the world.
China's leader retiring
Peking — Marshal Ye Jianying, 85, who as chairman
of the National People's Congress is China's head of
state, formally announced yesterday that he would
not continue in the post when a new congress is
elected this spring.
Ye's retirement, expected for six months, will help
in the effort to rejuvenate the aged Chinese leader
ship through the promotion of younger persons to
top national posts. As long as Ye remained, however
sick and feeble, reformers found it difficult to per
suade men in their 60s and 70s to step aside.
