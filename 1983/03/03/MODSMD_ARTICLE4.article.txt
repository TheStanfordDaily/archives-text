U.S. may deepen Salvadoran tie
Washington — The Reagan administration, seeking
ways to reverse a deteriorating military situation in El
Salvador, isconsidering allowing U.S. military advisers
to operate closer to Salvadoran government troops in
the field. , ,,
Officials stress that such a move, long advocated by
U.S. military specialists, would not involve any com
bat role or going on operations with government
forces against leftist guerrillas.
But it would allow some U.S. advisers to operate at a
brigade headquarters or provincial command center
in the countryside, where they might havo greater in
fluence over troops they have helped train and, per
haps more important, over the Salvadoran field com

manders.
American officials say they believe that poor lead
ership by some field commanders, especially those
who are political appointees, is a major factor in the
generally lackluster performance of the Salvadoran
army.
Thus far, the U.S. advisers, 37 of whom are now in El
Salvador, have been restricted to the capital city of
San Salvador, except for occasional quick journeys
into the field.
