# Luncheon today crowns royal visit
## 
### HEATHER MILLAR 
Today is the day.
Since early this morning, the Stan
ford community has been preparing
to roll out the red carpet for Queen
Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, the
Duke of Edinburgh, who will arrive
between noon and 1 p.m. to lunch
with University President and Mrs.
Donald Kennedy and their 92 guests.
The exact route that the royal
couple will travel to reach Hoover
House, the president's residence,
has not been released, although ob
servers have speculated about sev
eral possible routes.
As the queen and prince drive into
campus, the chosen few will have al
ready assembled at the Kennedy
house, scattered among various
downstairs rooms.
"The royal couple likes to enter when
a party is already started and people
are having a good time," said Univer
sity spokesman and former British
Consul Donald Stokes. "This is
normal for any occasion hosting a
guest of great importance."

It is likely that the guests will be
divided between two rooms on the
ground floor, according to Stokes.
When the royal couple enters, they
will probably split, with the queen
going into one room and the prince
into the other.
The guests will be talking, drinking
cocktails and waiting according to a
set floor plan. According to some
sources, the group will scatter into
clusters of four, but this is not defi
nite. Stokes cautioned that none of
the details will be final until the very
last minute.
If those invited have a chance to
chat with Queen Elizabeth and Pr
ince Philip, that opportunity will
arise during the half-hour or hour of
cocktails before lunch.
"I don't know what I'm going to
say," said Mark Epstein, Council of
Presidents member. "We're consid
ering making a presentation of some
kind on behalf of the student
body. . . . We're probably going to
give her a gift of some sort, and a

resolution from the senate. Who
knows, we might make her a
member of the ASSU."
"I'm an absolute horse fanatic,"
said senior Kim Schnurpfeil. "She's
an expert on horse breeding so I
guess I'll talk to her about that. She's
a person too; and I'm sure she'd
enjoy talking about something she's
interested in."
"One thing I'd like to say to her is
'Sorry about this weather,' " said
Penny Purpura, wife of the dean of

the Medical School.
Rain or shine, the Leland Stanford
Junior University Marching Band will
serenade the luncheon guests as
they dine. The band will not be al
lowed in the house, however, and
neither the seating chart nor the
menu has been released in the name
of good taste.
Some sources speculate that the
meal will be served in two rooms,
with three to five tables in each, the
head table will seat 15, according to
one of the guests who will be hon
ored there. Victoria Emmons, who is
catering the affair with a staff of 18,
said the meal will consist of three
courses.

"We want to give her a light lunch
but one that could exhibit what
California has to offer at this time of
year — things that are not available in
most parts of the world until )une,"
Emmons said.
After lunch, the queen will drive
from Stanford to San Francisco to at
tend a state dinner hosted by Presi
dent and Mrs. Reagan.
The guests were enthusiastic
about their chance to greet the
monarch.
Schnurpfeil said, "She represents
tradition, respect, discipline, ele
gance. To me it's inspiring to see
someone that is so constantly de
fined by an ideal of civilization."
