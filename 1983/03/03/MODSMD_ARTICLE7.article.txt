### TROY EID Staff writer 
About 300 labor, church and peace
activists rallied at Memorial Au
ditorium yesterday evening to pro
test Litton Industries' alleged anti
labor practices, Litton has been
charged with violating labor laws in
43 complaints issued by the National
Labor Relations Board.
The group accused Arjay Miller,
dean emeritus of the Business
School, of teaching Litton Indus
tries to break federal labor laws. Mil
ler currently serves on Litton's advi
sory board.
"Litton industries is the most out
rageous, brazen, repeat labor law
violator in the country today," said
Peter Cervantes-Gautschi, business
manager of the Santa Clara County
Central Labor Council and rally
coordinator. The demonstration's
purpose, Cervantes-Gautschi said,
was to inform the public "what Litton
is, what it stands for, and why it must
be stopped."
Litton handles everything from
guiding systems for cruise missile to
microwave ovens.
"This is a historic event,"
Cervantes-Gautschi said. "It is the
first progressive, positive campaign
against such ... a multinational cor
poration."
Earlier in the day, Richard
Kurovsky, Business School news di
rector said, "We have no official view
toward the rally whatsoever."
Kurovsky noted that Arjay Miller
"doesn't even teach here" as dean
emeritus and "in fact hardly ever vis
its the campus."
"Miller isn'teven a voting member
on Litton's advisory board,"
Kurovsky said.
The demonstration was the second
in a nationwide campaign protesting
Litton and featured the announce
ment of congressional legislation
that would forbid repeated violators
of the National Labor Relations Act
from bidding on federal government

contracts.
Litton's alleged anti-labor prac
tices have been condemned
throughout the United States by
such labor activists as actor Edward
Asner. Critics further contend that
Litton should not be awarded gov
ernment military contract because of
repeated National Labor Relations
Act violations.
Litton grossed over $4 billion in
1%1, with roughly $1 billion in mili
tary contracts, according to John
Henning, secretary-treasurer of the
California chapter of AFL-CIO. Hen
ning noted a parallel between
America's military-industrial com
plex and that of Nazi Germany's.
"We can't do anything about this
complex politically ... we can only
do something through economic
control and union solidarity," Hen
ning said.

John Listinsky, field representative
for United Stanford Workers Local
715, said Stanford was picked as the
rally site because of Arjay Miller's
link with Litton.
"I think it's appropriate that we
meet at the base of the Stanford
Business School and the Hoover In
stitution, the major inventors of
doublethink on the West Coast,"
said Richard Holober, secretary of
the San Mateo Labor Council. "Stan
ford should ask Arjay Miller to hold
Litton accountable."
"We think a great University like
this . . . has an obligation to teach
future business executives that cor
porations ought to abide by the same
standards of lawfullness as individu
als," said Ronald Carver, who is
coordinating the national campaigns
against Litton."
