If you were visiting California, where would
you go? Earlier this week, Queen Elizabeth
dined at the luxurious Annenberg Estate at Ran
cho Mirage, viewed the former stage location of
MASH and toured the Reagan ranch in Santa
Barbara.
On Sunday, the Queen lunched at the 205-
acre desert estate of Walter and Leonore An
nenberg. Mr. Annenberg formerly served the
United States as Ambassador to Great Britain
during the Nixon administration, while his wife
was chief of protocol during the first 11 months
of the Reagan administration. Also dining with
the official party were President Gerald Ford and
his wife Betty.
Following the luncheon, Annenberg took the
prince and the queen on a tour of his estate,
where via a golf cart, they viewed the golf
course, gazebo, sculpture gardens and
hothouses. The tour ended with the presenta
tion of two gifts from the Annenbergs to the
queen: a porcelain California quail and a
framed, handwritten letter from 1935, written by
the queen's mother.
Later that evening, first lady Nancy Reagan
(who preceded the president to California) was
hostess to the queen at a glittery Hollywood
banquet for 500. The dinner was sponsored by
eight businessmen who are friends of President
Reagan.
The star-studded party was held at the studios
of 20th Century-Fox, at the very same stage
where the television series MASH was filmed.
With the aid of movie background and props,

the recently vacated 190 by 100 foot stage was
transformed into a California garden.
While the Reagans helicoptered to their
mountaintop home, the queen did some morn
ing sightseeing, visiting the historic Santa Bar
bara courthouse, which dates to the Spanish
Colonial times.
Because the queen dislikes helicopters, the
royal entourage motored up the winding, some
times flooded roads to Reagan's Rancho del
Cielo at the crest of the Santa Ynez mountains
for a lunchtime barbecue of ribs.
But one of the highlights of the trip had to be
cancelled Tuesday when heavy rains and high
winds prevented the queen from taking a hor
seback ride around the Reagan ranch in Santa
Barbara. Rains had washed out the trails and the
muddy ground was too dangerous for the
horses.
"The whole visit was the result of their (hor
seback) ride at Windsor Castle last |une," said
White House deputy chief of staff Michael
Deaver, who is the queen's official host for her
trip. "As they were riding along, the president
was describing his ranch to her and saying how
beautiful it was, and she told him: "I'd love to
see it some time."
"By the time he had left Windsor, they had
agreed to visit. That's how the whole western
trip got put together."
Deaver said Tuesday that although the queen
and the duke "have had, I think, a very exciting
time. . . .it's dissappointing to Californians be
cause we were hoping to show them the sun
shine."
