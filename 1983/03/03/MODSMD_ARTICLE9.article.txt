services
President Reagan's trip to
California to welcome Queen
Elizabeth II will cost taxpayers
at least $175,000, but that is an
extremely conservative figure.
In fact, the actual cost could
end up to be five or even 10
times the estimated amount.
Many costs are absorbed by
the military or Secret Service
and will never be known.
In addition, the figure does
not include costs of advance
work by White House aides,
who have made numerous
trips to California in the past
several months to plan the
events for the queen's visit.
The $175,000 was calcuated
— from White House estimates
— this way:
Reagan will spend about 12
hours on Air Force One, which
costs $5,566 an hour to oper
ate. That comes to $66,792.
He will spend about two
hours on the presidential
helicopter, Marine One. And
when Reagan uses a helicop
ter, two other choppers are
used at the same time: one for
Secret Service and one for
White House staff. The

helicopters cost $1,334 an hour
to operate. For six hours, that
comes to $8,004.
About 50 members of the
White House staff will accom
pany Reagan to California.
Their hotel and meal expenses
will cost an estimated $40,000.
Hotel and meal expenses for
Secret Service agents, who
guard the president, his wife,
and the queen in three sepa
rate shifts, will be at least as
much as $40,000.
The catering for the official
dinner in the queen's honor at
the deVoung Museum in San
Francisco was estimated at
$20,000. Another $29,000 for
other expenses in connection
with the dinner, such as flow
ers, has been donated by San
Francisco corporations.
Michael Deaver, deputy
chief of staff and presidential
counselor Edwin Meese flew
out early to greet the queen
when she arrived in the United
States on Saturday. The cost of
their transportation and food
could not be obtained.
The Secret Service never an
nounces how many agents it
has guarding the president, his
wife, or in this case the queen.
