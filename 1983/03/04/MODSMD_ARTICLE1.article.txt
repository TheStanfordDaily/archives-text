# Queen Elizabeth drops in on the Farm
## Gets a royal welcome at Kennedy luncheon 
### KRISTEN CHRISTOPHER 
By all accounts, the royal visit was a
success.
England's Queen Elizabeth 11,
Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh
and their entourage safely snuck in
the back of campus yesterday and
were received at Hoover House, the
residence of University President
Donald Kennedy and his wife
Jeanne, for the carefully planned
luncheon.
The 20-car cavalcade's route, pre
viously unannounced, led from
Highway 280 along Page Mill Road to
Junipero Serra Boulevard and onto
campus via Santa Maria Street.
The couple emerged from their
limousine — marked bv both Ameri
can and royal flags — a few minutes
before the scheduled 12:40 p.m.
luncheon. The queen's bright tur
quoise dress and matching hat were
appropriate for the first dry day the
royal party has spent in California.
Secret Service agents and local
police officers lined the streets
around the house before the
luncheon, and several California
Highway Patrol cars invaded campus
when the entourage arrived, but
guests at Hoover House said the at
mosphere inside was fairly relaxed.
Many commented on the queen's
and prince's evident curiosity about
the University.
"What stood out for me was their
very real interest," leanne Kennedy
said. "When they're here, they're at
Stanford '
Donald Kennedy said, "It was
genuinely an informal and thought
ful and lively event ... I thought it
really was a success."

"She (the queen) seemed very re
laxed," said Lawrence Crowley, Uni
versity vice-president for medical af
fairs. He said she questioned him
about governance of the University.
Student guests were surprised and
pleased by the openness of the
queen and prince. They made an ef
fort to speak personally to everyone
in the room and questioned the stu
dents about their studies and inter
ests.
"She seemed genuinely in
terested," said ASSU Senate Chair
Raga Elim, who was asked about the
functioning of Stanford's student
government.
Sophomore Andrew Messing said,
"(They) were really impressed that I
was studying classics."
Kristina Johnson, an electrical en
gineering graduate student, dis
cussed her upcoming post-doctoral
fellowship in the British Isles with the
queen. She said, "She is a super
lady."
The queen received two gifts — a
copy of Stanford From the Foothills
to the Bay and a Stanford T-shirt from
Council of Presidents member
Volanda Townsend. "The duke said,
'I can't wait to see her in it,'
Townsend said.
Although Jeanne Kennedy re
ported having chatted with Prince
Philip about wildlife preservation,
she also indicated that she was
somewhat nervous during the event;
asked about the queen's attire, she
replied, "I didn't even know if she
had a coat on."

vous. At the Faculty Senate meeting
which he rushed to following the
luncheon, Kennedy said, "I actually
found myself enjoying the occasion
after perhaps 20 minutes; for the first
20 minutes I think I was scared out of
my mind."
Kennedy also told the senate: "I
think it was an unusual experience
for a number of young people. I wish
the number could have been larger,
but it was large enough to have some
ripple effect and have people talk
about it elsewhere.
"It's an experience I would have
been reluctant to decline on behalt
of all of you."
William Massy, vice-president for
business and finance, recalled for
the senate a humorous discussion
from the luncheon. He said that
Physics Prof. Alexander fetter, the

senate chair, was telling the Duke
"just exactly what the Faculty Senate
was. . . then a student said there was
a student senate and he (the Duke)
just about fainted."
The guests began arriving at the
Kennedy residence around 11:45
a.m. Most of the students walked up
the winding streets in pairs or
groups. Rhodes Scholar-designates
Bill Halter and Richard Klingler ar
rived together as did runner Kim
Schnurpfeil and football playerGarin
Veris.
The other Stanford guests arrived
on foot, were deposited by car or
pedaled up on bicycle.
Most of the guests were greeted by
the Kennedys at the door, and the
president planted kisses on the
cheeks of many women, leanne
Kennedy's greenish-turquoise silk
dress — trimmed with a shawl collar
and reddish-pink border — was
eye-catching; her husband's smile
and tan face were more noticeable
than his gray suit and tan and blue

tie.
As the sound of helicopters over
head signaled the royal party's arri
val, the Kennedys took their places
on the doorstep. The president
peered into the sky, checking the
weather situation; his wife looked
down the road anticipating the
limousine.
Preceded by several CHP cars and
Secret Service station wagons, the
large Lincoln-Continental appeared.
The Kennedys moved toward the
limousine, the queen emerged and
extended her hand to the president,
while his wife received that of the
prince.
The two pairs stood outside briefly
— Her Majesty and the president
posed for the press — before enter
ing the house. The rest of the royal
party filed in after their head of state.
The British men were dapper in
neatly tailored suits, while the
women looked traditional in hats
with bows on the back. The queen's
high-necked dress buttoned up the

front and was loose-fitting. She wore
black patent leather shoes and car
ried a matching purse. Her outfit was
trimmed by black gloves and a large
pearl pin.
As planned, the Leland Stanford
lunior University Marching Band and
the Stanford Dollies performed on
the back lawn of Hoover House.
They — and the crowds behind secu
barricades — were able to get a
glimpse of her Majesty. She briefly
appeared on a balcony, waved and
smiled.
Included in the Band's repertoire
were "Rule Britannia," "Come )oin
the Band," and Dire Straits' "Sultans
of Swing."
The Band was quite prepared for
the occasion: some tubas were
painted with British flags and new
Drum major Simon Streets wore a
British flag T-shirt under his white
tuxedo jacket.
Most of the time the band was play
ing the luncheon party was inside
Hoover House. Messing said, "We

definitely could hear them ... I
think the English, they got a kick out
of them."
The guests were seated at many
tables in both the dining room and
living room, but Donald Kennedy
was able to get everyone's attention
to make a brief toast to Her Majesty
and His Royal Highness. Some of the
remarks were 'Your presence here
not only does us honor; it climaxes a
period of reflection on our own his
torical origins, the culture we share,
and our intermingled futures. That
kind of reflection is a central purpose
for a great University."
The luncheon, prepared by Vic
toria Emmons, wife of History Prof.
Terence Emmons, included mousse
of smoked pacific salmon, chicken
florentine and mushrooms in butter.
The dessert was reine de sabra —
chocolate cake — with fresh raspber
ries and two different California
white wines were served.
The meal was served by seven
female students dressed in white pi

nafores. They lined up outside the
front door and received the queen's
thanks as she left.
Guests crowded in the doorway
and waved as the limousine drove
away.
"We all had a wonderful time. . .it
was beautifully done," Madeline
Crowley said.
leanne Kennedy seemed particu
larly enchanted by His Royal High
ness; "Wasn't Prince Philip neat?"
she asked Elizabeth Eilert, a junior
double majoring in English and eco
nomics, who immediately agreed.
"We would love to do it again," the
hostess said.
The secret service took tight pre
cautions: an "electronic sweep" was
made in the house and a police dog
sniffed the grounds for explosives.
An hour or so before the sched
uled arrival of the royal party, Jeanne
Kennedy had trouble getting back
into her own house after she had
emerged *o take pictures of the press
for her own files.

By all accounts, the royal visit was a
success.
England's Queen Elizabeth 11,
Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh
and their entourage safely snuck in
the back of campus yesterday and
were received at Hoover House, the
residence of University President
Donald Kennedy and his wife
Jeanne, for the carefully planned
luncheon.
The 20-car cavalcade's route, pre
viously unannounced, led from
Highway 280 along Page Mill Road to
Junipero Serra Boulevard and onto
campus via Santa Maria Street.
The couple emerged from their
limousine — marked bv both Ameri
can and royal flags — a few minutes
before the scheduled 12:40 p.m.
luncheon. The queen's bright tur
quoise dress and matching hat were
appropriate for the first dry day the
royal party has spent in California.
Secret Service agents and local
police officers lined the streets
around the house before the
luncheon, and several California
Highway Patrol cars invaded campus
when the entourage arrived, but
guests at Hoover House said the at
mosphere inside was fairly relaxed.
Many commented on the queen's
and prince's evident curiosity about
the University.
"What stood out for me was their
very real interest," leanne Kennedy
said. "When they're here, they're at
Stanford '
Donald Kennedy said, "It was
genuinely an informal and thought
ful and lively event ... I thought it
really was a success."

"She (the queen) seemed very re

about governance of the University.
Student guests were surprised and

vous. At the Faculty Senate meeting
which he rushed to following the
luncheon, Kennedy said, "I actually
found myself enjoying the occasion
after perhaps 20 minutes; for the first
20 minutes I think I was scared out of
my mind."
Kennedy also told the senate: "I
think it was an unusual experience
for a number of young people. I wish
the number could have been larger,
but it was large enough to have some
ripple effect and have people talk
about it elsewhere.
"It's an experience I would have
been reluctant to decline on behalt
of all of you."
William Massy, vice-president for
business and finance, recalled for
the senate a humorous discussion
from the luncheon. He said that
Physics Prof. Alexander fetter, the

senate chair, was telling the Duke
"just exactly what the Faculty Senate
was. . . then a student said there was
a student senate and he (the Duke)
just about fainted."
The guests began arriving at the
Kennedy residence around 11:45
a.m. Most of the students walked up
the winding streets in pairs or
groups. Rhodes Scholar-designates
Bill Halter and Richard Klingler ar
rived together as did runner Kim
Schnurpfeil and football playerGarin
Veris.
The other Stanford guests arrived
on foot, were deposited by car or
pedaled up on bicycle.
Most of the guests were greeted by
the Kennedys at the door, and the
president planted kisses on the
cheeks of many women, leanne
Kennedy's greenish-turquoise silk
dress — trimmed with a shawl collar
and reddish-pink border — was
eye-catching; her husband's smile
and tan face were more noticeable
than his gray suit and tan and blue

tie.
As the sound of helicopters over
head signaled the royal party's arri
val, the Kennedys took their places
on the doorstep. The president
peered into the sky, checking the
weather situation; his wife looked
down the road anticipating the
limousine.
Preceded by several CHP cars and
Secret Service station wagons, the
large Lincoln-Continental appeared.
The Kennedys moved toward the
limousine, the queen emerged and
extended her hand to the president,
while his wife received that of the
prince.
The two pairs stood outside briefly
— Her Majesty and the president
posed for the press — before enter
ing the house. The rest of the royal
party filed in after their head of state.
The British men were dapper in
neatly tailored suits, while the
women looked traditional in hats
with bows on the back. The queen's
high-necked dress buttoned up the

front and was loose-fitting. She wore
black patent leather shoes and car
ried a matching purse. Her outfit was
trimmed by black gloves and a large
pearl pin.
As planned, the Leland Stanford
lunior University Marching Band and
the Stanford Dollies performed on
the back lawn of Hoover House.
They — and the crowds behind secu
barricades — were able to get a
glimpse of her Majesty. She briefly
appeared on a balcony, waved and
smiled.
Included in the Band's repertoire
were "Rule Britannia," "Come )oin
the Band," and Dire Straits' "Sultans
of Swing."
The Band was quite prepared for
the occasion: some tubas were
painted with British flags and new
Drum major Simon Streets wore a
British flag T-shirt under his white
tuxedo jacket.
Most of the time the band was play
ing the luncheon party was inside
Hoover House. Messing said, "We

definitely could hear them ... I
think the English, they got a kick out

The guests were seated at many
tables in both the dining room and

extended her hand to the president,
while his wife received that of the
prince.
The two pairs stood outside briefly
— Her Majesty and the president
posed for the press — before enter
ing the house. The rest of the royal
party filed in after their head of state.
The British men were dapper in
neatly tailored suits, while the
women looked traditional in hats
with bows on the back. The queen's
high-necked dress buttoned up the

front and was loose-fitting. She wore
black patent leather shoes and car
ried a matching purse. Her outfit was
trimmed by black gloves and a large
pearl pin.
As planned, the Leland Stanford
lunior University Marching Band and
the Stanford Dollies performed on
the back lawn of Hoover House.
They — and the crowds behind secu
barricades — were able to get a
glimpse of her Majesty. She briefly
appeared on a balcony, waved and
smiled.
Included in the Band's repertoire
were "Rule Britannia," "Come )oin
the Band," and Dire Straits' "Sultans
of Swing."
The Band was quite prepared for
the occasion: some tubas were
painted with British flags and new
Drum major Simon Streets wore a
British flag T-shirt under his white
tuxedo jacket.
Most of the time the band was play
ing the luncheon party was inside
Hoover House. Messing said, "We

definitely could hear them ... I
think the English, they got a kick out
of them."
The guests were seated at many
tables in both the dining room and
living room, but Donald Kennedy
was able to get everyone's attention
to make a brief toast to Her Majesty
and His Royal Highness. Some of the
remarks were 'Your presence here
not only does us honor; it climaxes a
period of reflection on our own his
torical origins, the culture we share,
and our intermingled futures. That
kind of reflection is a central purpose
for a great University."
The luncheon, prepared by Vic
toria Emmons, wife of History Prof.
Terence Emmons, included mousse
of smoked pacific salmon, chicken
florentine and mushrooms in butter.
The dessert was reine de sabra —
chocolate cake — with fresh raspber
ries and two different California
white wines were served.
The meal was served by seven
female students dressed in white pi

nafores. They lined up outside the
front door and received the queen's
thanks as she left.
Guests crowded in the doorway
and waved as the limousine drove
away.
"We all had a wonderful time. . .it
was beautifully done," Madeline
Crowley said.
leanne Kennedy seemed particu
larly enchanted by His Royal High
ness; "Wasn't Prince Philip neat?"
she asked Elizabeth Eilert, a junior
double majoring in English and eco
nomics, who immediately agreed.
"We would love to do it again," the
hostess said.
The secret service took tight pre
cautions: an "electronic sweep" was
made in the house and a police dog
sniffed the grounds for explosives.
An hour or so before the sched
uled arrival of the royal party, Jeanne
Kennedy had trouble getting back
into her own house after she had
emerged *o take pictures of the press
for her own files.
