# Queen Elizabeth drops in on the Farm
## Gets a royal welcome at Kennedy luncheon 
### KRISTEN CHRISTOPHER 
By all accounts, the royal visit was a
success.
England's Queen Elizabeth 11,
Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh
and their entourage safely snuck in
the back of campus yesterday and
were received at Hoover House, the
residence of University President
Donald Kennedy and his wife
Jeanne, for the carefully planned
luncheon.
The 20-car cavalcade's route, pre
viously unannounced, led from
Highway 280 along Page Mill Road to
Junipero Serra Boulevard and onto
campus via Santa Maria Street.
The couple emerged from their
limousine — marked bv both Ameri
can and royal flags — a few minutes
before the scheduled 12:40 p.m.
luncheon. The queen's bright tur
quoise dress and matching hat were
appropriate for the first dry day the
royal party has spent in California.
Secret Service agents and local
police officers lined the streets
around the house before the
luncheon, and several California
Highway Patrol cars invaded campus
when the entourage arrived, but
guests at Hoover House said the at
mosphere inside was fairly relaxed.
Many commented on the queen's
and prince's evident curiosity about
the University.
"What stood out for me was their
very real interest," leanne Kennedy
said. "When they're here, they're at
Stanford '
Donald Kennedy said, "It was
genuinely an informal and thought
ful and lively event ... I thought it
really was a success."

"She (the queen) seemed very re
laxed," said Lawrence Crowley, Uni
versity vice-president for medical af
fairs. He said she questioned him
about governance of the University.
Student guests were surprised and
pleased by the openness of the
queen and prince. They made an ef
fort to speak personally to everyone
in the room and questioned the stu
dents about their studies and inter
ests.
"She seemed genuinely in
terested," said ASSU Senate Chair
Raga Elim, who was asked about the
functioning of Stanford's student
government.
Sophomore Andrew Messing said,
"(They) were really impressed that I
was studying classics."
Kristina Johnson, an electrical en
gineering graduate student, dis
cussed her upcoming post-doctoral
fellowship in the British Isles with the
queen. She said, "She is a super
lady."
The queen received two gifts — a
copy of Stanford From the Foothills
to the Bay and a Stanford T-shirt from
Council of Presidents member
Volanda Townsend. "The duke said,
'I can't wait to see her in it,'
Townsend said.
Although Jeanne Kennedy re
ported having chatted with Prince
Philip about wildlife preservation,
she also indicated that she was
somewhat nervous during the event;
asked about the queen's attire, she
replied, "I didn't even know if she
had a coat on."
Donald Kennedy made it apparent
he was more than somewhat ner
