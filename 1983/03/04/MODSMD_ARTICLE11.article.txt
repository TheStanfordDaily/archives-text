## 'It was great... it was terrific to see my queen' A
						guest's recollections 
### KIM SCHNURPFEIL 
The brief moments of conversa
tion and the exact words said really
did not signify the essence of a
meeting with Her Majesty."
Waiting expectantly upon the ver
anda of Hoover House, it took quite
an effort to try and put myself at ease
at the first and probably only en
counter I would ever have with roy
alty. The queen's arrival seemed to
send a rush of relief and content
ment through me. Her presence,
enhanced on that day by her teal blue
dress, carried a subtly powerful aura
of grace and beauty. Respect, tradi
tion, stability, discipline and ele
gance — all these are embodied in
her.
The delicate flowers and crystal,
the light breeze and the dark, heavy
wooden furniture created impress
ive imagery as I was encompassed by
the experience. Yet, all of the colors
and dishes and dresses are merely
passing, physical realities. The
queen is more than this.
Both she and Prince Philip flowed
through the strictly choreographed
reception of the guests. Individual
personalities are only slightly de
tected during a warm but somewhat
distant greeting. The queen's com
posure is fantastic. Though what I
will most remember is the ideal of
civilization which her every action
represents. She inspires excellence
in spirit and character.
There was a great sense of com
munity as we anxiously received our
royal guests. Stanford tradition
awards great appreciation to diver
sity of talent and interest and this was
represented by the individuals in at
tendance. Vet on such an occasion,
perhaps we realize the many unifying
factors in all human endeavor. Small
personal achievements are humbled
in comparison with the history of
mankind.
For both Britain and America, the
queen is a living symbol of history.
We must recognize the recording of
history in itself as a unique bestowal
upon humanity. We are granted with
this ability which allows us to strive
beyond, while supported and edu
cated through communication with,

the strength and experience of the
past.
And yet, even the queen could not
control the most popular topic of
conversation — the will of the
clouds.

TRYING FOR A PEEK: Well-wishers wait at the corner
of Gerona and Santa Maria in anticipation of the royal
motorcade. These spectators were lucky. They cor
rectly guessed the route the queen and her entourage

Bill Ledingham/Daily
were to take. Many others who staked out the
Mayfield side of campus were disappointed and had
to be content with the distant strains of "Hail, Britan
nia," played by the Band.
