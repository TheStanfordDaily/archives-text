Hundreds of Anglophiles armed with binoculars, um
brellas and patience gathered at the barricades on the
roads leading to Hoover House yesterday in a deter
mined — and in some cases successful — attempt to
catch a glimpse of royalty.
Well-dressed businessmen, housewives from the
community, students, children, protesters, journalists
and camera crews anxiously waited on street corners for
the arrival of Queen Elizabeth II and the Duke of Edin
burgh.
The business of seeing the queen and her party had
turned into a shell game; since the route that the queen
would take to her luncheon at Hoover House, University
President Donald Kennedy's residence, had not been
disclosed, would-be spectators had to trust to luck.
Several groups of hangers-on were hoping the Leland
Stanford Junior University Marching Band would pro
vide a clue to the queen's route, and the Band devel
oped quite a iollowing as it marched from the Band
Shak. through White Plaza and up Mayfield Avenue play
ing/4// Now, and Hail, Britannia.
"I'm just covering this for myself," said Bill Wheatley
as he rushed, camera-laden, after the Band. "My grand
mother is from England and she wants pictures."
A large crowd gathered along Mayfield, which by
popular consensus had apparently been designated as
the most likely place to see the royal party.
Row houses were decorated in various ways: Union
Jacks hung from windows, and the Beta Theta Pi frater
nity displayed a banner saying "Liz, it's Ladies' Night!"
from the upstairs balcony of its house.
Those onlookers perched along Mayfield heckled and
cheered pasersby. "I've been recognized as the queen
three times," said Carol Trefinger, a middle-aged
woman from Mountain View. "I don't know whether it's
the scarf on my head or not. But one thing is clear. I've
been invited to several parties as the queen. The stu
dents really welcome the queen; I just get the invita
tions."
Delta Kappa Elsilon fraternity members, waving flags
and wearing red, white and blue outfits, perched on top

of their house at the corner of Santa Ynez and Mayfield,
a spot many thought the queen surely would pass. Red
sweaters were the order of the day.
"She's a wonderful person," said senior Howard
Sewell as he waved a Union Jack. "All our demonstra
tions are a symbol of that." Sewell, a British citizen, has
lived in London but had never seen his queen.
He didn't get to see her yesterday, either. The motor
cade used Page Mill Road and lunipero Serra Boulevard
as its access route, and only about 75 onlookers and
protesters were on hand there. Many of the spectators in
larger crowds elsewhere were disappointed, although
some were able to sneak past the barricades near
Hoover House.
"If you live in one of the houses (around the Kennedy
mansion), then you're up here," said sophomore Naomi
Cramer as she watched the queen wave. Cramer lives in
the La Maison Francaise, which was above one of the
road blocks.
Others were not so lucky. "I was so bummed," said
freshman Jeff Wexler, adding that he was glad he had
taken advantage of the "once in a lifetime" chance. "If I
hadn't gone, I never would've had a shot" to see the
queen, he said.
Michael Meadows, a local worker, was disappointed
that his trip to see the queen had been unsuccessful. "I
came all the way here just to see her," he said. Other
onlookers complained that security personnel had de
liberately directed them to the wrong place.
Upon learning that they had missed the motorcade,
many spectators scrambled to get to Junipero Serra, and
the hills around Hoover House swarmed with security
officers and spectators asking directions.
Another spectator, Sue Urry, said she had biked all the
way from Redwood City with her 23-month-old daughter
in tow to get a glimpse of the monarch. Urry said she had
selected her viewing site on Mayfield because the crowd
was largest there. "I've been riding all around campus
trying to find crowds of people," she said.
The observers lucky enough to see the queen's
motorcade were enthusiastic about the experience. "I'll
never forget it," said sophomore John Kenagy.
"It was great," said junior Gordon Hecker, a Cana
dian. "It was terrific to see my queen."
