## The 						Stanford Daily Personnel needs change 
### 
The staffing and administration of a large,
complex university such as Stanford certainly
poses a difficult task. The University must meet
the needs of a wide range of employees, from
secretaries to research technicians, keeping
fairness and efficiency in mind.
In order to locate areas of concerns, a task
force was initiated by University President
Donald Kennedy and Vice-President for Busi
ness and Finance William Massey in 1981. The
task force recently presented its final report and
concluded that "the University needs to in
crease its capacity and effectiveness in manag
ing its . . . human resources" in order to correct
a tendency toward a loss of "coherence and
focus." The task force recommended the Uni
versity adopt a proposed statement of its per
sonnel philosophy, distributeit widely and rein
force it regularly. In addition, the task force
recommended the University increase local re
sponsibility for personnel matters to provide
more flexibility and control.
The University is to be commended for un
dertaking such a comprehensive self
evaluation, which has clearly identified prob
lem areas in personnel administration here. But
it is crucial that the University begin acting on
the task force's recommendations — of which
there are a grand total of 23 — to begin improv
ing working conditions for those 1300 men and
women who consider Stanford not as a tempo
rary station for schooling, but as a place to work.
The report also included the results of a staff
survey revealing undercurrents of dissatisfac
tion among workers over certain administrative
procedures. While most workers here said they
were generally "very positive" about the Uni

versity as a place to work, many were dissatis
fied with the job classification system, evalua
tion procedures, grievance procedures and
minority relations.
According to the task force, problem areas
include the following:
•The existing classification system may be
"unrealistic and unresponsive " and is viewed
by employees as "cumbersome and restric
tive."
•The current pay system may have the effect
of compensating employees "too uniformly and
too automatically . . . without regard to job per
formance."
• Only a small percentage of staff are aware of
the Affirmative Action Office, the Om
budsmen's Office and the grievance proce
dures, while more than 50 percent of those who
have used these resources found them "not at
all useful."
.About a third of the minorities here are at
least somewhat dissatisfied with the overall
treatment of minorities here, while 25 percent
believe that, to some degree, they are discrimi
nated against in their jobs becauseof their race.
•Thirteen percent said they have never re
ceived a formal evaluation and only half said
they are mostly or very satisfied with the feed
back they receive.
When taken as a whole, it appears there are a
lot of problems in personnel policy here. Stan
ford is a nice place to work, most of the staff tell
us, but when it comes to some important issues
such as classifications and pay scales, the Uni
versity is lacking its usual organizational finesse.
We hope to see some changes made around
here soon.
