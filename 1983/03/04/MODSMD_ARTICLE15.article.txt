## Mosher case required confidentiality 
### 
The editorial concerning the case
of Steven Mosher (Daily, Feb. 28)
jaised a question that is not surpris
ingly of general concern. How may
members of the Stanford commu
fiity, and others, make an informed
judgment on the recent dismissal of a
ph.D. candidate in the Department
bf Anthropology? Following an ex
tensive inquiry of Mosher's profes
sional conduct while doing research
|n the People's Republic of China,'
Department of Anthropology
,Voted to dismiss him.
' I would like to offer some informa
tion that I hope will contribute to the
"informed judgment" of readers of
the Daily. Since many students do
not see Campus Report, I refer them
to an article that appeared on Feb. 23
describing the procedures and con
cerns related to the Mosher case.
This article was based on a statement
by the chairman of the anthropol
ogy dept., Prof. Clifford Barnett,
and, to the best of my knowledge,
accurately describes the sequence of
events leading up to the dismissal.
In summary, it details the pro
cedural steps taken by the Depart
ment and the safeguards observed to
afford Mosher a full opportunity to
understand and respond to the evi
dence against him, while protecting
innocent parties. The ad hoc com
mittee's report was limited to indi
viduals who were involved in the
procedure: Mosher, of course, was
provided with a copy.
The reasons for the extreme care
taken in this case to assure that the
University did not release any sub
stantive details are several: first, in
any inquiry involving an individual's
academic status, that individual has a
right that his or her privacy be pro
tected; second, the privacy of
others,who had provided informa
tion with the understanding that it
would be shared with Mosher and
those involved in the decision
making, but not the public, also de
serves protection; and finally, the
duty of anthropologists to protect re
search subjects from the possibility
of repercussions mandates the con
fidentiality of the report and the un
derlying evidence in this case.
The University cannot, of course,
prohibit any person with knowledge
of the case from discussing details
with the press, but for the reasons
just given, the University cannot it
self provide such details in this situa
tion. It is of course true that when
only one side of a story is available, it
is difficult for the public to reach its
own decision on the merits, but we
believe that the protection of the in
dividuals in this case is so important
that we cannot abrogate the confi
dentiality of the material.
Then how, Daily readers may rea
sonably ask, can we be sure that Mr.
Mosher's "right to due process" is
recognized? The article in Campus
Report (Feb. 23) gives many details of
the procedure so far. The current In
formation Bulletin describes (pp.
50-51) the guidelines for student
academic grievance procedures,
which will be applicable hereafter if
Mosher should elect to appeal the
Department's decision. These guide
lines state: "Any Stanford student,
undergraduate or graduate, who be
lieves that he or she had been treated
improperly on an academic matter, is
entitled to an independent review of
the alleged offense, followed by cor

rective action if appropriate. . .
Mosher knows — in fact, I in
formed him myself several months
ago — that he has the right to pursue
a complaint through the grievance
procedure if he feels that he has
been treated unfairly.
The Daily editorial ended by stat
ing that "the only thing we can con
clude for certain is that the University
could have acted more responsibly
in its handling of this affair." I hope
tV»e Daily and its readers wilt agree
that the reasons I have given for hold
ing confidential evidence and rea
soning supporting the Department's
decision are compelling; unfortu
nately, it does also mean that the
Daily and its readers are not able to
be fully informed, and hence to draw
conclusions with certainty about the
University's "handling of the affair."

Civil rights
Many students, including myself,
want to learn about "Racial Discrimi
nation and Civil Rights," but two
black student groups have denied us
an oustanding opportunity. The
Black Student Union (BSU) and the
Black American Law Student Associa
tion (BALSA) are mounting con
certed opposition to the course
which would have been taught by
two men who dedicate their lives to
ward promoting civil rights and pro
tecting minorities from racial dis
crimination.
The two men, Julius Chambers and
lack Creenberg, are the leaders of
the National Association for the Ad
vancement of Colored People Legal
Defense Tund (NAACPLDF). BSU
and BALSA have stated a disagree
ment with the methodology of the
Guest Professorship Bureau (GPB) as
one of their main reasons for oppos
ing the course. Regardless of the
legitimacy of these claims, they do
not justify disrupting the academic
dissemination of ideas which are of
such concern to black Americans.
BALSA also aimed to raise aware
ness about the "gross lack of minor
ity law faculty" by opposing the
course. This is an important issue
which should be addressed. How
ever, using their opposition as an
opportunity to draw attention to
such problems is utterly inapprop
riate, and clouds the issue, which has
no bearing on the proposed course.
The absurdity of BALSA's other ex
pressed aim is painfully obvious; that
is, calling for a "recommitment to in
creasing the number of courses ad
dressing the issues of racial discrimi
nation." How do they possibly see
opposing the first such course taught
here in over a year and thus ensuring
its cancellation as contributing to
their stated goal?
The groups opposing the course
are aware that Greenberg had stated
he would not teach here if he were
met with a similar protest to that
which he suffered at Harvard.
Greenberg's refusal is.certainly jus
tified: the opposition by black or
ganizations is highly offensive to a
man who has spent his life promot
ing racial equality.
BSU alluded to expressing solidar
ity with the Harvard boycott of the
course by BALSA. The boycott was

ill-advised and unfounded at Har
vard, so to follow it up at Stanford
seemsabsurd. Itmustbeasked,what
about solidarity with the NAACP
Legal Defense Fund? The opposition
by black student groups to a course
taught by the leaders of one of the
black community's most respected and
effective advocacy organizations is
every bit as outrageous as it appears.
There should never be opposition
to raising people's awareness about
racial discrimination and civil rights,
which the proposed course would
have done. There were never any
doubts raised by the groups about
the proposed syllabus.
I opposed the McCloskey course
because of concern over using ASSU
money to sponsor a man who contri
butes to the escalation of prejudice
in America. I support the
Chambers/Greenberg course be
cause of a belief that our money can
not be better spent than to support
those whose ideas and efforts are di
rected toward fighting prejudice.

To register or not
In his column entitled "Reasons
for non-registration" {Daily, Feb. 23),
Paul Baer offered his reasons for his
decision not to register for the draft,
which, he says, was initially based on
a gut-level reaction. Like Baer, my
decision in 1980 was also initially
guided by a gut-level reaction — a
feeling that registering for the draft
was the right thing to do. And, like
Baer, the passage of time has con
firmed that feeling.
I should begin by saying that the
purpose of this response is not to
condemn those who have chosen
not to register as good-for-nothing
non-conformists "giving strength to
the 'enemy'." On the contrary, I
greatly admire the motivation of this
group — a sincere hope for peace in
this world. At the same time, how
ever, I feel that, though guided by
worthy motivation, the decision not
to register is neither a positive nor a
productive response.
It seems obvious that, whether we
like it or not, we all have to live to
gether in this society; in order to do
so, we must be willing to com
promise — to comply to a set of rules
established by society, and to bring
about changes in those rules in an
orderly and acceptable manner. As a
driver, should I protest a law of 55
mph by driving at 80 mph on the high
way? Certainly any society
which sanctions such forms of pro
test will end in nothing but chaos (or
at least with lots of banged-up cars).
Baer refused to register "because
registering endorses the status quo
in a society I consider to be unjust."
Couldn't a decision to register be in
terpreted as saying, "I don't like the
status quo, but I'm willing to com
promise and search for a positive way
by which to change the status quo?"
It's obvious that our society is not
entirely just (has there ever been one
that was?) but I don't think that
means we should reject it entirely.
What I'm suggesting is that Baer
could find a much more positive ex
pression of his gripes with society.
When faced with social problems,
we can either withdraw from the so
ciety and sit around criticizing it, or we
can immerse ourselves in the society

and work toward a more just order.
The latter is certainly more difficult,
but I think it results in a more mean
ingful and lasting change.
Some may suggest here that I ha
ven't been entirely fair to the possi
bility of bringing about change from
a position of withdrawal and rejec
tion. After all, it took a revolution to
win America its freedom. But I think
the founding fathers showed their
greatest wisdom in realizing that this
type of social change should be the
exception rather than the rule. Based
on this conviction, they set up a soci
ety in which more orderly, positive
means of change are possible.
Baer's article is a perfect example
of how such negative reactions often
become muddled and confused. I
was rather struck by his statement,
"All these arguments should make it
clear why I feel it is the ethical thing
to do to refuse to register." Some
how I missed seeing any meaningful
connection between racial discrimi
nation, for example, on the one
hand, and draft registration (which is
what the article is supposedly about)
on the other. It may be true that
minorities are forced into careers in
the services because of social injus
tice, but how does Baer's refusal to
register say anything, or, more im
portantly, do anything about the so
cial and economic causes which
bring about such a situation?
My final complaint with Baer's arti
cle is its tone of distrust — in the
government and in the fellow mem
bers of his society. If we are going to
talk about ideals such as peace in the
world, social justice and equality, I
think we have to begin by pursuing
the ideal of a society in which people
trust one another.
We have to trust that an awareness
among Americans of the incredibly
frightening dangers of war (since that
seems to be largely, or at least logi
cally, what the refusal to register is a
reaction against) will bring about
change. Perhaps a more positive and
productive response, then, would be
to work on furthering this aware
ness.

Night whistle
A few minutes ago, we heard a
whistle which reminded us of last
year. Our immediate reaction was to
jumpupand see where it was coming
from. After searching outside and
not finding anything, we called the
police. Within a few minutes they
were here, but found nothing. We
wonder who blew the whistle. Was
someone seriously in trouble or just
kidding around?
Last year whistles were issued to
women as a result of several reported
rapes. The sound of a whistle sig
nifies the need for assistance. In
order for the whistle to remain an
effective cry for help, people have to
treat it seriously.
Responding to the whistle is im
perative; abusing it is thoughtless.
