# DSA: The 'new' party
## 
### 
A week ago today marked the first
conference of the Democratic
Socialists of America (DSA). DSA is a
"new" political party (formed by a
merger of the New American Move
ment (NAM) and the Democratic
Socialists Organizing Committee
(DSOC) that embodies many of the
liberal concerns of Americans frus
trated by the direction of our domes
tic and foreign policies. DSA is an
ideological machine, without a polit
ical candidate for the foreseeable fu
ture, that wants a voice in main
stream American politics. Recently,
Harold Washington, now the first
black Democratic candidate to run
for mayor in Chicago, came to DSA
for support and got it.
Michael Harrington, a political sci
ence scholar and author of The Other
America and Decade of Decision, is
chairperson of DSA — a figurehead
for DSA's more than 7000 active
members.
Harrington doesn't believe in
capitalism, but you aren't likely to
near Marx mentioned in his
speeches. DSA is far from revolutio
nary. You will hear "I love America
and want to improve it," working
within the system, not underneath it.
DSA makes a point of dissociating
itself from the status quo communist
countries.
The alienation of workers from
corporate decision-making is respon
sible for short-sighted profit man
agement which is blind to the needs
of employees. Double-digit unem
ployment reflects not simply a bad
market environment, but govern
ment and business strategies that are
less concerned with blue collar lives
than capital games. Harrington
noted that every percentage point of
U.S. unemployment costs us $30 bil
lion in taxes and that if we had kept
unemployment down to the four
percent that former Presidents Ken
nedy and Johnson were working with,
we wouldn't have a budget deficit
today.
Rather than lots of giant business
monoliths — fairly totalitarian
hierarchies, if you think about it —
inside of a democracy, DSA would

like to see real democratic industries
inside a real democratic society: let
the work force, American citizens for
whom industry ultimately exists,
create the best policies for their
businesses.
Harrington is against the draft the
arms race, and sees that we have hurt
Third World countries on which we
push our policies. Harrington said,
for example, "This government has
done everything in its power to stop
democratic evaluations in
Nicaragua." It is a mistake to inter
fere with a country's right to self
determination, especially when the
path we offer, capitalism, is a path
our multi-national corporations have
usurped. Harrington suggests that
forcing Third World countries onto a
path already taken makes them turn
away from us to socialism, and thus
we jump to the suspicion that there is
a communist plot. While we believe
a developing country must be run
the way we determine for our "na
tional security," in fact we can push
them away from us by tugging them
down the wrong path.
DSA is relatively voice/ess at pre
sent, but they will accrue more evi
dence for their arguments and more
people willing to listen. Last week
the San Francisco Chronicle ran an
article stating that El Salvador has re
leased an American journalist's body
that had been "missing" for the last
two years there. Reminiscent of the
Charles Horman case in Chile during
thel973 military coup — thebasisfor
the movie Missing — we, again,
have to ask what we know about
what is going on in our satellite coun
tries: What is our role there now?
On the domestic front, examples
of union and worker suppression,
like Litton Industries, or the now im
poverished steel towns ready to
smash Toyotas as scapegoats, are
strengthening American frustrations
with current policies and providing
additional motivation for listening to
leaders such as Harrington.
