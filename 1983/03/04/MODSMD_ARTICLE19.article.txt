## Some don't care about details of the visit 'The Queen's arrival has been overdone and I don't like it at all' 
### DIANE JOHNSON 
Not everyone cares what
Queen Elizabeth II of England
had for lunch yesterday. In
fact, some members of the
Stanford community think the
queen's visit is downright tri
vial.
"I am by no means excited
about her arrival. It's just
another unusual happening
here in the valley," said Buzz
Delaney, an offset press
operator at Word Graphics on
campus.
Many people are disturbed
by the queen's visit. Protest
groups such as the Irish Repub
lican Committee and the Club
of Life object on political
grounds, specifically about
British influence over Ameri
can policies. Others are dis
tressed about the tremendous
financial expense her visit has
demanded. "An event which
costs taxpayers $200,000 a day
seems a bit absurd," Delaney
said.
Clancey Langston, a campus
mail deliverer, shared De
laney's sentiments. "I don't
mind anyone visiting and tour
ing the school, but not when
you have to take tax money
away from those who really
need it. job training programs
are being cut back as a result of
it. I have nothing against her
personally and if she want to
come visit, fine. But when we
have to foot the bill, it's a real
inconvenience."
Maurice Miller, who also
works in mail delivery, ques
tions whether the expense is
justified. "I don't want to be all
negative because I see how it
benefits our relations with En

gland, but what else is it ben
efitting? People need money
just to survive — at least I sure
do — and it's not benefitting
me at all."
Monetary concerns aren't
the sole cause of bitter reaction

to the queen's visit. The at
titudes about a monarchy,
royal blood and the rites and
rituals accompanying the so
often esteemed system are also
influential.
Langston objects to the sys
tem on purely religious
grounds. "I believe Cod

created everyone equal, ex
cept for Jesus, of course, who
was given royal blood. The
British monarchical system is
the height of inequity. It would
bug me a lot if I had to live in
England right now under those
conditions."
UPS employee John Tuggle

also disapproves of monarchy
and the philosophies it repre
sents. "The queen's arrival has
been overdone and I don't like
it at all. She stands for family,
traditional and elitism, living
off ideas that don't really
exist," he said.
Others in the Stanford

community describe them
selves as indifferent about her
arrival. After all, when you
have no invitation to her
luncheon at University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy's, no
knowledge of her campus
travel route, and therefore lit
tle chance for even a momen

tary glimpse of her royalty, it's
difficult to generate wild
exuberance about the event.
Nan Bentley, assistant di
rector of Events and Services,
said, "It's fine if she's coming,
but I'm not going to go out of
my way." She added, "Her visit
is significant in that it's theonly
enduring institution in western
society. I suppose we could
use a little of the tradition our
selves."
Beth Ziegler, a secretary at
CERAS, echoed Bentley's
thoughts. "I don't feel person
ally affected by her visit, but I
guess the money spent is jus
tified. Of course, I'm not starv
ing so maybe that makes a
difference on my outlook. It's a
show and I enjoy the show."
Would a monarchy work in
the United States? "I don't
think so," Ziegler said. "People
in America wouldn't put up
with it because they're too re
bellious, too individualistic.
The reason for the whole rev
olution was to break apart
from the monarchy and the
family-related cohesiveness
accompanying it."
Even if the English royal sys
tem were to be implemented in
this country, it appears we
would have quite a time find
ing anyone willing to be
queen. "I certainly wouldn't
want to do it," Ziegler said. "It
would be like living in a prison.
You can't do anything on your
own. I like to make my own
choices and enjoy my free
dom. Besides, it's a dangerous
occupation in present world
conditions. There are so many
rebellious people."
