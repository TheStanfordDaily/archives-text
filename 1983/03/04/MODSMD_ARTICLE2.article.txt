Demonstrators from Irish North
ern Aid (Norad), the Irish Republican
Committee, Amnesty International,
and the Club of Life protested Queen
Elizabeth 11 s visit here yesterday with
signs, bullhorns and an airplane.
Director of Public Safety Marvin
Herrington said as many as 100
"cooperative and well-behaved"
protestors were on campus. "They
just carried their placards, and that
was about it."
Protestors carried signs charging
the queen with just about every
thing. Some accused her of being re
sponsible for mass murder; one said,
"Co Home Eliza-beast. You are
worse than Hitler," while another
begged for "No more genocide from
her royal hind-ass." Others con
demned British involvement in
Northern Ireland and the recent war
in the Falkland Islands.

Norad members hired an airplane
to fly over Hoover House trailing the
message "Brits out. Victory to the
IRA. Irish Northern Aid." The plane
was a "special gift" for the queen,
said Norad member Jim Boyle.
Supporters of the queen said they
were bitter toward the de
monstrators but acknowledged their
right to protest. "I certainly think
they have the right to be here and to
express their views, but they're the
opposite of mine, and I think what
they're doing is in bad taste," said
one man waiting to see the queen.
Some onlookers weren't so kind,
however. One woman stopped her
car in the middle of Mayfield Avenue
to shout at Norad members who
were protesting British involvement
in Northern Ireland. "I'm 100 percent
Irish and I am disgusted," she yelled
out her car window. "Yes, I'm Irish
and I'm ashamed."
Another woman complained that

the protestors were being unfair. "I
lived in an era when Hitler was in
power and to say she's worse than
Hitler is terrible. But protocol says
that she can't answer back, and that
is just unfair," she explained.
After a few minutes of protest, the
Irish groups and the Club of Life
members split up to demonstrate at
separate, heavily guarded access
roads to the Hoover House, where
the queen lunched with Stanford
faculty, staff and students.
Although outnumbered by their
Irish counterparts, the protestors
from the Club of Life, a group dedi
cated to fighting the International
Monetary Fund, were more vocal.

through a bullhorn to a crowd
gathered at the intersection of
Mayfield Avenue and Santa Yncv
