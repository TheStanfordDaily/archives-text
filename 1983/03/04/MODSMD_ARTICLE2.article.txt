Demonstrators from Irish North
ern Aid (Norad), the Irish Republican
Committee, Amnesty International,
and the Club of Life protested Queen
Elizabeth 11 s visit here yesterday with
signs, bullhorns and an airplane.
Director of Public Safety Marvin
Herrington said as many as 100
"cooperative and well-behaved"
protestors were on campus. "They
just carried their placards, and that
was about it."
Protestors carried signs charging
the queen with just about every
thing. Some accused her of being re
sponsible for mass murder; one said,
"Co Home Eliza-beast. You are
worse than Hitler," while another
begged for "No more genocide from
her royal hind-ass." Others con
demned British involvement in
Northern Ireland and the recent war
in the Falkland Islands.

Norad members hired an airplane
to fly over Hoover House trailing the
message "Brits out. Victory to the
IRA. Irish Northern Aid." The plane
was a "special gift" for the queen,
said Norad member Jim Boyle.
Supporters of the queen said they
were bitter toward the de
monstrators but acknowledged their
right to protest. "I certainly think
they have the right to be here and to
express their views, but they're the
opposite of mine, and I think what
they're doing is in bad taste," said
one man waiting to see the queen.
Some onlookers weren't so kind,
however. One woman stopped her
car in the middle of Mayfield Avenue
to shout at Norad members who
were protesting British involvement
in Northern Ireland. "I'm 100 percent
Irish and I am disgusted," she yelled
out her car window. "Yes, I'm Irish
and I'm ashamed."
Another woman complained that

the protestors were being unfair. "I
lived in an era when Hitler was in
power and to say she's worse than
Hitler is terrible. But protocol says
that she can't answer back, and that
is just unfair," she explained.
After a few minutes of protest, the
Irish groups and the Club of Life
members split up to demonstrate at
separate, heavily guarded access
roads to the Hoover House, where
the queen lunched with Stanford
faculty, staff and students.
Although outnumbered by their
Irish counterparts, the protestors
from the Club of Life, a group dedi
cated to fighting the International
Monetary Fund, were more vocal.
Organizer ludy Houffman shouted
through a bullhorn to a crowd
gathered at the intersection of
Mayfield Avenue and Santa Yncv
Street.
Houffman had to shout over the
jeers of members of the Delta Kappa
Epsilon fraternity, who stood on the
roof of their house waving the Union
jack.
At one point a resident of the
house shouted to Houffman, "Are
you through?" When she answered
that she wouldn't be done protesting
until she had everyone cheering, the
Dekes shouted back "Yeah Queen!"
Protestors for a "free Northern Ire
land" were met with more serious
arguments from British-born Ameri
cans who dominated the crowd
areas. A number of arguments broke
out between Norad members and
British and American Bay Area resi
dents.
One woman, who worked as a
nurse for the British during World
War 11, argued with a veteran of the
British evacuation from Dunkirk who
carried an "IRA all the way" sign. The
woman told the man he "must not
believe in Cod, because if you did
you would not support the cruelty of
the IRA."
The closest most of the Irish pro
testors came to seeingthe queen was
when a limousine carrying a woman
dressed like the queen left the
Hoover House. Thinking the woman
was indeed the queen, the protes
tors began to shout "l-R-A, l-R-A!,"
as a small carcarrying Norad member
Leo Boyle and other protestors
charged up the road, barely missing

the rear part of the crowd.
Immediately after the limousine
passed, the crowd went wild. "I saw
her, I saw her," one elderly English
woman screamed as she jumped up
and down. The crowd quickly
realized, though, that itwastooearly
for the queen to have left the
luncheon and that the car must have
been used as a decoy to confuse the
protestors.
Herrington denied that the
limousine was part of any security
plans and speculated that it carried a
member of the queen's party who

left to attend a separate lunch at the
nearby home of Secretary of State
George Shultz.
Although the demonstrations
were smaller than Herrington antici
pated, the protestors said they felt
they were successful.
Norad member Leo Boyle said he
felt his group's protest was effective.
"We initially said we would dog the
queen everywhere she went (on her
California tour). So far we've been
everywhere she's been. And
everywhere she goes, we'll be there.
We know who she is, and she knows
who we are," Boyle said.
