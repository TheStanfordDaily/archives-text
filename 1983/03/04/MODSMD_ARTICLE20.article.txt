# BUG ME

Some history this week, since I don't
have much room:
A so-called upperclassman has been
spreading a vicious rumour concerning
an alleged nuclear reactor which used
to call Stanford home. This know-it-all
claims the reactor existed (would you
believe) up Stanford Avenue among
the faculty houses. He then had the gall
to propose that the "nuclear device"
was shut down years ago. Am I to be
lieve this tall tale, or is this just an at
tempt for a smart aleck sophomore to
obtain a laugh off a gullible freshman?
Please help me.

I'm not sure if I can give you the kind
of help you need, but I can try to answer
your question.
In a word, yes — I think. There was, at
one time, a nuclear device of some sort
in the Ghetto. Unfortunately, I haven't
as yet found out as much about it as I'd
like; so in the meantime, I'll tell you
about the Minuteman missiles in the
foothills.
The banner headline of the Tuesday,
April 1, 1969 Daily read "Minuteman

System Uncovered in Foothills; Free
way Construction Covers Installation."
The accompanying story went on to de
tail how the U.S. government, in an
"unprecedented venture into use of ac
ademic institutions to protect the na
tional defense," had secretly installed
the missile site during construction of
the soon-to-open I-280. The story also
said that an ABM site was being con
sidered for the foothills, to protect the
Minuteman site and Moffett Field.
Quotes from Deputy Secretary of De
fense David Packard (a Stanford gradu
ate and trustee) and Richard Allen, at
that time Henry Kissinger's assistant and
a former Hoover fellow, confirmed that
the site had been built. Allen said, "We
carefully placed the site far from the
center of campus. We do not anticipate
a repeat of the Columbia University
gym incident last April."
As final confirmation, there were
three photographs: a string of "radar
antennas... used in ABM guidance sys
tems," a plain concrete slab obviously
located in the foothills and surrounded

by a storm fence, and a gate with a sign
reading "STOP HERE — PUSH BUT
TON."
During the day more than 90 phone
calls came into the Daily offices check
ing on the story, including calls from
the Chronicle, Examiner, Associated
Press and UPI. A professor at the Food
Research Institute phoned in excite
ment and said, "I just saw some trucks
going up into the hills. I think they're
going to take the missiles out." KNXT
TV in Los Angeles put a camera crew on
a plane for the Bay Area. And student
radicals found the pictured "bunker"
and tried to storm it, only to restrained
by uniformed ROTC cadets.
The ROTC caught on early. In a morn
ing class the ROTC captain compared
the photographs against a topographic
map, did some computations, and said,
"It's a water reservoir. At least I think it's
a water reservoir." He was right.
hat's it until next week, when I'll
bring you the true story of the nuclear
reactor on Stanford Avenue. Don't
forget — it's not too early to start plan
ning your own April Fool's jokes.
