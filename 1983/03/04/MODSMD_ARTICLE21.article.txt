# 'There's nothing to attack'
## Draft protests compared 
### KEVIN CROSS Staff writer 
Draft Awareness Week offi
cially ends Saturday, but the ef
forts of the sponsor, Stanford
Against Conscription, will con
tinue for the rest of the year.
Vet the activities this week
were sedate in comparison to
the massive anti-draft protests
of the 19605, which saw hun
dreds of students burningdratt
cards in White Plaza.
Opinions of why today's
students appear to be less wil
ling to get involved in the
anti-draft movement vary.
Stanford Law Prof. Jack Frie
denthal, former chairman of
the judicial commission on
campus, said he believes there
are two basic differences be
tween the protest movement
of the '60s and of the '70s.
"First of all" he said, "there
was a good deal of outside agi
tation and support. Not that so
many outsiders came to our
campus . . . but that there was
a feeling of solidarity among
students (across the nation).
There was a general feeling
about students reacting."
The other thing that charac
terized this movement, accord
ing to Friedenthal, were the
"ridiculous" allegations that
were being made about the re
search that was being done
here.
"Students would say that
Stanford University was basic
ally running the war. Anyone
who knows history . . . would
fall over laughing (at this no
tion)," he added.
By contrast, Friedenthal sees
the resistance movement
today as more pragmatic and
constructive. "People tend to
be more action oriented, to
work on things that they can
accomplish. People realize that
riots don't accomplish any
thing."
Political Science Prof.
Hubert Marshall disagrees. "I
think that getting rid of ROTC
and government sponsored
secret research was an ac
complishment," he said. "We
had graduate students in en

gineering and could do disser
tation research only if they got
security clearance. Serious mil
itary research was going on . . .
on this campus.
"In the '60s, students were
protesting the draft, but in the
context of other issues — as
part of a larger operation,"
Marshall said.
Marshall characterized the
takeover of the Applied Elec
tronics Laboratory (AEL) in the
early '70s as a "brilliant, non
violent student action." The
AEL was known to be doing
government research and the
protest was motivated by the
widespread student opposi
tion to the Vietnam war, Mar
shall said.
"In the '60s, there was a
place that you could attack.
Today, students may rally but
there's nothing to attack," he
said.
"To go over there (to Viet
nam) and get killed had an im
mediacy about it that draft reg
istration (today) just doesn't
have," Marshall said. He added
that another reason for the

apparent apathy of students to
wards the issue is that "draft"
registration isn't as inherently
as offensive to students as the
draft."
Moreover, according to
Marshall, the argument that
"draft registration leads to the
draft," doesn't have the credi
bility it did three years ago.
"We had a few protests (in
1980) and a couple of good ral
lies, but the nation didn't pay
any attention."
History Prof. Clay Carson,
who registered for the
draft in the '60s, said that the
actual number of people for
whom the anti-draft movement
was the focus of their protests
has not changed. "There has
always been an anti-draft and
an anti-war movement. In the
'60s, however, it was an aspect
of other movements," he said.
Carson was a panelist at a
"History of the Draft" seminar
Tuesday, which also featured
History Prof. Paul Seaver, who
spoke on the history of the
draft.

that another reason for the

apparent apathy of students to
wards the issue is that "draft"
registration isn't as inherently
as offensive to students as the
draft."
Moreover, according to
Marshall, the argument that
"draft registration leads to the
draft," doesn't have the credi
bility it did three years ago.
"We had a few protests (in
1980) and a couple of good ral
lies, but the nation didn't pay
any attention."
History Prof. Clay Carson,
who registered for the
draft in the '60s, said that the
actual number of people for
whom the anti-draft movement
was the focus of their protests
has not changed. "There has
always been an anti-draft and
an anti-war movement. In the
'60s, however, it was an aspect
of other movements," he said.
Carson was a panelist at a
"History of the Draft" seminar
Tuesday, which also featured
History Prof. Paul Seaver, who
spoke on the history of the
draft.
