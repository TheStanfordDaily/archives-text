## Jones nets 36 Stanford gives lowly Arizona first Pac-10 win 
### STEVE ODELL Senior sports writer 
Tucson, Ariz. â€” Arizona
broke out of an 0 for '83 con
ference slump, gingerly cling
ing to a 74-73 win over a hard
charging Stanford basketball
team last night at McKale Cen
ter.
The Wildcats broke a 15-
game losing streak, one short
of the school record, and won
their first conference game of
the year when Morgan Taylor
hit a foul shot with 15 seconds
remaining.
Guard Keith (ones, who
scored a career high 36 points,
missed a 20-foot jump shot
from the right side with two
seconds left that would have
won it for the Cardinal.
Steve Brown grabbed the re
bound and made a lay-in but it
was clearly after the final buz
zer and the no-basket call from
the officials brought a portion
of the 5711 people present
onto the court.
"We were trying to run just
what we ran," Stanford coach
Tom Davis said of the missed
last shot. "We wanted to
get )ones one-on-one on the
weak side and we did. He got a
respectable shot but it just
didn't go down."
Stanford, now 5-10 in the
conference and 13-12 overall,
had tied the game at 73-73 with
four straight points. Johnny
Rogers canned a jumper from
the high post and )ones hit two
foul shots with 23 seconds re
maining before Hans Wichary
fouled Taylor in the backcourt
and set up the winning shot.
The Wildcats, now 1-14 in the
Pac-10and 4-21 overall, leptout
to a 37-19 lead on the strength
of Puntus Wilson's 12 points.
Wilson and Brock Brun
khorst, who was eight-for
eight from the free-throw line
in the second half, both

finished with 18 points.
"1 thought we did a good job
after digging ourselves a hole,"
Davis said. "It seems like we
were coming back all night. It
takes its toll coming back so
many times. It tires you out
emotionally as well as physi
cally."
Arizona's win followed a
surprise press conference
called yesterday afternoon by
first-year UA coach Ben
Lindsay, where it was specu
lated that he might announce
his resignation. He did not.
"I made a commitment when
I accepted this job that I would
build this program intooneof a
championship calibre and one
we could be proud of given a
reasonable amount of time,"
Lindsay said. "I have not wa
vered from that commitment. I
am not ready to step down
after one disappointing sea
son."
A controversial call that
changed the complexion of the
game came with 54 seconds left
when Stanford guard Keith
Ramee fouled Frank Smith in
side. The officials ruled that
Smith was in the act of shoot
ing and awarded him two free
throws.
Davis contested, arguing
that Ramee fouled Smith be
fore he had attempted a shot
and therefore should have only
been given a one-and-one op
portunity. It evolved into a
major decision as Smith missed
the first foul shot and made the
second, giving UA a 73-69 lead
and setting up the one point
differential.
"It looked to me like he was
landing on Keith when they
called the foul," Davis said.
"How can he be shooting if
he's coming down? I would
have to see the tape to know
for sure but it sure looked like
he was going to land and then

go up tor the shot."
Stanford fell behind 39-23
but scored 11 of the last 13
points of the first half to close
the deficit to 41-34.
Stanford got its only lead by
continuing its comeback at the
outset of the second half, reel
ing off a 14-6 spurt to put it
ahead 48-47 with 13:57 left.
The Wildcats countered with
a tour-point run consisting of a
Taylor turnaround jumper in
the lane and a )ohn Bellob
raydic muscleshot on Earl
Koberlein. The Cardinal fol
lowed with a Jones lay-in and
freethrow to tie the score for
the last time at 51-51.
Arizona forged a 68-60 lead
with 4:27 to go on the strength
of eight straight free throws.
)ones then went to work, dot
ting thescoring page like the
page in the telephone book.
The junior guard, playing in his
home state, connected on a

pair of baskets and two free
throws in the next minute and a
half to get Stanford back into
the game with 2:55 left.
"He had a great ball game,"
Lindsay said. "One-on-one he's
just going to beat anyone. He
just goes to the hoop and does
his thing."
Jones made 13 of 20 shots
from the floor, but converted
just 10 of 16 from the line, in
cluding missing four in a row at
one point in the last four min
utes.
As a team, the Cardinal con
nected on only 13 of 23 foul
shots for a 56.5 percentage, se
verely hampering its comeback
cause.
"I'm happy for Arizona,"
Davis said. "It was a good win
forthem. I'm just sorryit had to
come at our expense."
Stanford travels to Arizona
State to face the third place Sun
Devils tomorrow at

Tempe. ASU (10-5, 16-12) is led
by Byron Scott, the Pac-10's
leading scorer averaging 20.0
points per game.
