## 
### FELICIA LEE Staff writer 
Secretary of State George Shultz and Francis Pym,
Britain's secretary of state for foreign and common
wealth affairs and a membei of Queen Elizabeth ll's
traveling delegation, took time out from their busy
schedules yesterday toenjoy a quiet luncheon at Shultz's
campus home.
Among the guests were Milton Friedman, Hoover
Institution senior resident fellow, and Ezra Solomon,
Dean Witter professor of finance at the Graduate
School of Business.
Despite the imposing guest list, the, affair was a
strictly social one, according to Elelena Shultz. The
Shultzes and the Pyms, she said, are personal friends,
and she and her husband had been entertained by
the Pyms before. The party, she said, was a way for
the Shultzes to "return their hospitality." She added
that the luncheon was attended by other personal
friends of the Shultzes, both British and American.
Because the visit was a social cone, no official mat
ters were discussed. Shultz said the topics of discus
sion were varied but were only "general conversation
as far as I was concerned."
