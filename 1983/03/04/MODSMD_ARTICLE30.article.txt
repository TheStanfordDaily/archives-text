Stanford's women's tennis
team is getting famous for win
ning matches. The fourth
ranked Cardinal defeated No. 6
South Carolina 7-2 yesterday in
the National Indoor Champi
onships at Ann Arbor, Mich.,
for its seventh victory of the
season and 28th in a row, an
unparalleled winning streak
that dates back to 1981.
But coach Frank Brennan's
troops are also getting famous
for starting matches very
slowly, a practice that may give
Brennan a head of grey hair by
the end of the season if it con
tinues.
Stanford takes on Miami to
day, another top 10 team, and
No. 1-ranked USC Saturday.
The eight-team indoor com
petition, featuring the nation's
top four teams, is divided into
two divisions, with the winners
of each four-team flight battl
ing it out Sunday for the title.
Second-ranked UCLA and No.
3 Trinity highlight the other di
vision.
"I was actually surprised (we
won 7-2)," Brennan said, "be
cause I thought we were going
to lose."
At one point in the match,
No. 1 Elise Burgin was tied 4-4

in the first set, No. 2 Linda
Gates was losing 5-1, No. 3
Alyce Werdel, a freshman in
experienced in the college
ranks, had not started her
match and Caryn Copeland,
Michelle Weiss and Alison
Hardy, the bottom three
players on the Card ladder, had
all lost their first sets.
"I was hoping we would get
two singles matches and then
have a chance to win (by
sweeping) in the doubles,"
Brennan said. "But I have a lot
of confidence in our team."
Burgin won eight of her next
nine games and Gates 12 of 13
to untrack the Cardinal, which
prevailed in fourof the six sing
les affairs and swept the dou
bles.
Burgin, Gates and Werdel all
won in straight sets, beating
South Carolina's Laura Berns
tein, lohanna Chafin and Ellen
Oxyrider, respectively.
At No. 4, Copeland, continu
ing to play clutch tennis,
fought off a match point in a
second-set tiebreaker and
breezed past jill Hausler in the
third set to record a 4-6, 7-6,6-1
victory.
Weiss and Hardy were the
only Card players to lose.
