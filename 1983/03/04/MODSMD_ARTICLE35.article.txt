# Racquetball Club copes

### BETH KLEID 
A few years ago when the nation caught racquet
ball fever, so did Stanford. A raquetball club team
was formed here in 1979 for enthusiasts of the fast
paced, fun and relatively "new" sport.
"About four years ago there definitely was a rac
quetball boom. It was the thing to do to be a doctor
or a lawyer and belong to a racquetball club. It
became a game for the elite," said Yvonne Lanza,
captain of the team.
The team here does not play racquetball at a
luxurious club, where jacuzzi soaks follow vigorous
matches. Four days a week for three hours each day
the team works out at the deCuerre Racquetball
Courts, which are a far cry from spa conditions.
"The facility is very neglected. The dust on the
floor, bad walls and broken lights are problems, but
you learn to live with them. They are easy to forget
about when you are concentrating on play," Lanza
said.
But the team's two star players are doctors. The
team's top men's player is Dr. Jeff Shapiro, who
plays in national tournaments. Other participants
include undergraduate students, graduate students

and staff members. In fact, alumni can play on the
team up to two years after their graduation.
"Officially we have 10 players on the team, but
there are seven alternates," said Lanza. "Only the
top six men and the top four women get to play in
matches."
The team has six women players, which is a good
turnout for women. "Racquetball teams always
have trouble getting women players. Sometimes
our No. 4 position girl can't play in a match because
the team we are playing against doesn't have
enough women," said Lanza.
As a result of the high prices charged by racquet
ball pros, the team does not have a coach. "We
don't have the funds or the resources to support a
coach. Pros charge about $15 an hour for lessons."
According to Lanza, the team is not put at a disad
vantage because they do not have a coach. They
have a record of 3-3 at present, and there are eight
matches left to play this season. The team has
beaten San Francisco State, Hayward and UC-Santa
Cruz.
