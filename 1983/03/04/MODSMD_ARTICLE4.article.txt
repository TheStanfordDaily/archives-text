# State Department denies Allende widow visa for speech here
## 
### TIM GRIEVE Staff writer 
The State Department has demed a visa to
the widow of former Chilean President Sal
vador Allende, who was scheduled to speak
here Monday.
The department claims that Hortensia
Bussi de Allende's trip would be "prejudicial
to U.S. interests" because she is a "highly
placed and active member of the World
Peace Council, which has a direct political
affiliation with the Communist Party of the
Soviet Union,' an official said yesterday.
Stanford faculty members have reacted
angrily to the decision, which will keep Al

lende from speaking here on the role of
women in Latin American human rights.
"I think the refusal is incredibly unfair,"
said Spanish and Portuguese Prof. Fernando
Alegria. "Mrs. Allende was coming to the
United States as a guest of a number of or
ganizations in celebration of Women's Day.
She was not going to talk about political is
sues. She was coming to speak on human
rights," the Chilean scholar said.
Assistant Provost Cecilia Burciaga said the
State Department's fears are ridiculous.
"She's a 71-year-old woman who never in
her history has been subversive. Who are

they afraid of?" Bur< iaga asked.
She said the decision may be the product
of an exaggerated tear of a Communist
threat which she feel characterizes the Re
agan administration. "God only knows what
kind of thinking went on. I suspect that the
State Department, like other parts of our
administration, mirrors that very frightened
attitude; it's a phobia on the part of U.S.
officials. I'm glad this is getting coverage
because it reveals a small window into the
kind of mentality we have making decisions
for this country," Burciaga explained.
Alegria said he feels the State Depart
ment's decision will hurt the United States

more than Allende's visit ever could.
"I suppose there will be a strong reaction
against this measure and there will be pro
test and it might become a story in internal
news. By doing this the State Department
will be creating an issue that had no reason
to be created. There will be criticism of
United States foreign policy for this," Aleg
ria said.
The State Department has criticized the
peace council before, especially for its
stance against the deployment of
intermediate-range nuclear missiles in
Europe.

Allende told the Washington Post yester
day that although she has attended World
Peace Council meetings, she is not a high
official in the organiztion ora memberofany
political party.
"This is a case of arbitrary action by the
Department of State. I don't know why they
discriminated against me," she said. She
said this is the first time she has been denied
a visa since she began traveling around the
world to draw attention to human rights
after her husband was killed in a military
coup in 1973. She last visited the United
States in 1981 when she attended an anti
apartheid conference at the United Nations.
