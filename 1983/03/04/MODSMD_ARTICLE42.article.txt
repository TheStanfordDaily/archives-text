# Men to Berkeley for key gym meet
## 
### SARAH CARREL 
Stanford men's gymnastics team will take part in a crucial six
team meet tomorrow night at UC-Berkeley. Besides Stanford and
Cal, eighth-ranked Houston Baptist University, Long Beach State,
UC-Davis and Athletics in Ac tion will compete.
This time, Cal is not really a threat to the Cardinal. Stanford
soundly beat its rivals with an earlier in the season, 270.55 to
259.75.
The Bears' best score of the year is a 265, while Stanford has
scored more than 270 on several occasions. That mark or better is
a goal for Cardinal coach Sadao Hamada in tomorrow's contest.
The real competition will be between Stanford and Houston
Baptist and Hamada feels that Stanford has a chance of beating
the nationally-ranked squad.
As the NCAA championships draw near, Stanford is in conten
tion to be one of the ten teams competing in that event. If the
Cardinal can beat Houston Baptist, its chances will improve
dramatically, as they will have demonstrated their ability to com
pete as a top national team.
Other regions of the country have different intensities of scor
ing, and Hamada said the Houston area judges generally score
higher than northern judges.
For this reason, the head-to-head competition between the
two top teams of the meet will be a better evaluation than current
scoring.
Stanford has won easily over the remaining teams in the meet
earlier this season. The only exception is Long Beach State, which
should pose no problems for the Cardinal.
Hamada's team is approaching this meet with a healthy squad
that has been training well. It is probable that freshman star Gary
Smith will be back in all-around action after sitting out certain
events because of back problems.
