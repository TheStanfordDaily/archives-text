## New microphone speeds mineral, metal analyses 
### JENNIFER SEYMOUR 
Ever wondered what chemicals your marble
table is composed of? Or how crystals grow
in hot magmas? Or what happens to rocks when
they're heated and compressed within the
earth?
Researchers here are now better equipped to
answer questions such as these, with the help of
a newly acquired electron microprobe analyzer.
A microprobe analyzes particular minerals for
their chemical ingredients. A knowledge of
exact chemical components is important in
geologic, biologic and materials science re
search.
The new microprobe, according to Gordon
Brown, associate professor of geology, is
the most advanced technology ot its kind avail
able today. It will allow "a complete, nine-point
analysis of your minerals" in about three min
utes, a process which took three to four hours
on the old microprobe.
"The new probe is fully automated and oper
ated with computer software, so you get an in
stantaneous reduction of data, where you used
to have to go upstairs and do this yourself,"
Brown said.
"This is a savings of time, so that more people
can use it and the people using it can look at
more samples."
Once fully operational, the probe will work an
80-hour week. It will cost students and faculty
who can run the probe themselves approxi
mately 15 dollars per hour, while others will pay
approximately 45 dollars per hour to use the
probe, according to Chris Zercher, micro
scopist at the Center for Materials Research
(CMR), which will house the new probe.
Students and faculty say they are glad to have
the new instrument available to them, and that it
will definitely get "a steady flow of users" and
perhaps even a "large flood" of them. Brown
will apply the probe towards learning more
about how crystals grow in silicate melts, how
melts are transported through the crust of the
earth, and about the nature of synthetic crystals,
among other things.
The probe will also be used to examine con
centrations of elements in body fluids that pass

through kidney tissues. This may help nep
hrologists at the Medical Center understand
how kidneys function, and why they sometimes
misfunction, according to Zercher.
The new microprobe will also assist graduate
students in their research. Craig Manning, a
graduate student in geology, will use the probe
to help interpret the hydrothermal system of
Greenland's Skaarguard intrusion.
"With the probe I can study exactly how min
erals that are sticking into hydrothermal veins
alter, and study how single minerals are
changed into other ones by hydrothermal pro
cesses.
"This probe is the most advanced of its kind
on the market today. Data is processed instan
taneously. And it has good optics: before, it was
very hard to see mineral grains in a thin section,
to find the ones you wanted to probe. This is not
a problem on the new probe," Manning added.
Pat Dobson, another graduate student in
geology, said, "Before, because of the difficul
ties in using the old probe, many students went
up to Berkeley to use their probe. So, this new
probe will save the time and costs of going up to
Berkeley."
Dobson will use the machine to study chemi
cal zonation in specific minerals. "If you have
normal zonation, this shows that a melt cooled
without any changes in crystallization trend. But
if reversals have occurred, that means a melt of
different composition was added to the original
magma as crystals were forming. The probe can
tell you if such zoning reversals occurred," he
explained.
The probe cost $500,000, contributed over the
course of two years. It was jointly funded bv the
School of Earth Sciences, CMR, Stanford Uni
versity and the National Science Foundation
(NSF). The chief independent contributor for
the School of Earth Sciences was the Arco Foun
dation. "Their donation allowed us to obtain
matching funds from NSF and Stanford," said
Brown.
CMR will house the probe, Brown said, "be
cause they are willing to provide the mainte
nance and the space for it. We are very tight on
space in the Mitchell building."
