The search for extraterrestrial civili
zations is being greatly accelerated by a
newdevicecalled ,t multi-channel spec
trum analyzer. The analyzer, created by
Allen Peterson, professor of electrical
engineering, and his group, will
spearhead the most c omplete survey of
intelligent life on other ever
initiated bv earthlin^s.
The new search, with the help of
Peterson's analyzer, will be at least a
million times more extensive than past
endeavors. The project will rely on a
group of three giant space radio
telescope antennas, based in Califor
nia, Australia and Puerto Rico to re
ceive radio signals impinging upon the
earth from spate. Project costs are
minimized by using these previously
constructed antennas.
The spectrum analyzer will listen to
up to eight million radio channels at
once, picked up by the antennas. A
computer, using sophisticated artificial
intelligence programs from the
Pasadena let Propulsion Laboratories,
will scan the signals simultaneously,
looking for meaningful patterns.
The Search for Extra Terrestrial Intel
ligence (SETI) project is funded by a 1.5
million dollar yearly allocation in the
NASA budget, said Dr. Bernard Oliver,
one of the founders of the SETI project.
According to Oliver, if NASA scientists
knew which world were inhabited, they
could set up two-way color television
communication using current facilities.
However, time lags introduced by
the fixed speed of light put a damperon
the spontaneity of such exchange: if
inhabitants of star Alpha Centauri, our
nearest neighbor, were told a joke by
an earth person, they would need to
wait at least 12 years to hear the pun
chline. And a Betelgeuseian would
need to wait 1500 years for the round
trip signal to be completed.
Because of the tremendous delays
likely in response to transmissions,
Oliver said listening is considered a

good starting point. "Some of the sig
nals we may detect could be so old the
civilizations which sent them have
themselves died out."
Oliver believes that our galaxy con
tains perhaps millions of earth-like
planets and that biological molecules
are commonly produced by naturally
occurring chemical processes. Oliver's
views were supported by Dr. lames
Lawless of the Nasa-Ames Research
Center Chemical Evolution Laboratory
who spoke at a recent Medical School
conference entitled "Life in the Uni
verse."

However, the presence of alien life in
the universe is difficult to prove be
cause of the great distances between
stars. Meteorites, cosmic boulders hit
ting the earth, have been found to con
tain biological molecules such as amino
acids, the essential building blocks of
life. But "without direct evidence, such
as that SETI could provide, we cannot
say that we are not alone in the uni
verse," Lawless said.
The first tests of the multichannel
spectrum analyzer are slated to begin
this summer at one of the NASA Deep
Space Network facilities in California's

Mojave Desert. When the current
model is perfected, the analyzer's ca
pacity will increase from 74,000 chan
nels to 100 million, using very large
scale integration processes soon to be
available.
The portion of the radio spectrum in
which extraterrestrial signals are
thought most likely to exist is a range
called the "water hole," from 1.2 to 3
gigahertz (billion oscillations per sec
ond). This range is dubbed the "water
hole" because it lies between the
characteristic signal frequencies of
hydroxy and hydrogen radicals of gas
drifting in space. These ions are formed
by the splitting of water, hence
"waterhole" is the range between
them.
Normal galactic phenomena, such as
quasars, pulsars, black body radiation,
and galactic synchrotron radiation all
broadcast signals of a broad bandwith.
These signals would propagate best
over intersteller distances and through
the earth's atmosphere if they were in
the waterhole range of frequencies. As
a result, this is the range monitored.
The waterhole contains over a billion
one-hertz channels, any one of which
might be used by an intersteller radio
stations. Monitoring all of these is the
great attraction of the multi-channel
analyzer project.
Evolutionary biochemists believe
that the evolution of life on other
planets is possible, it not inevitable,
given earth-likeconditions, said Oliver.
"Earthbound scientists, however, can
not directly search the billions of po
tential sun systems diretly for life or
even determine which suns have
planets, so at this point we need to wait
for them to contact us."
According to Dr. Ivan I inscott, a col
laborator on the analyzer project, the
Soviets are interested in this area of re
search and "have constructed large ar
rays of listening antennae which we
understand are dedicated to SETI ac
tivities."
