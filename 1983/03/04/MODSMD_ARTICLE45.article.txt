# Doctors study drug for baldness treatment
## 
### PHYLLIS BURTON 
The Department of Der
matology at the Medical Cen
" ter is researching a treatment
for baldness, with a drug cur
rently used as an anecdote for
high blood pressure.
I The focus of the study is the
drug Loniten, manufactured by
the Upjohn Company, which
was approved by the Food and
Drug Administration in 1979 for
treatment of high blood
pressure.
Loniten, generically referred
to as Minoxidil, has been
found to have the side effect of
causing hair growth. Accord
ing to the Medical Center's
Physicians Desk Reference
(PDR), hair grew on about 80

percent of those receiving the
drug. "This developed within
three to six weeks after starting
therapy," the PDR reports. "It
is usually first noticed on the
temples, between the eyeb
rows, between the hairline and
the eyebrows, or in the side
burn area of the upper cheek.
When their study began, the
Department of Dermatology
hoped to study 100 men, in
good health, between the ages
of 18and 49, with normal blood
pressure and a well-defined
bald spot. At the first an
nouncement of a need for vol
unteers, department members
reported they were inundated
with phone calls.
In less than a day, the de

partment had all the men it
needed, and many disap
pointed volunteers had to be
turned away, including one
man who had flown in from Los

Angeles, after hearing they had
a "cure for baldness."
But Dr. Elaine Orenberg,
senior resident associate of the
Department of Dermatology
and coordinator of the study,
cautions that "this is not

necessarily a cure for bald
ness; there are still a lot of un
knowns."
The year-long study is to in
volve monthly monitoring of
volunteers, as well as physical
exams at the beginning, mid
dle and end of the project. The
Minoxidil will be applied to
bald areas only, and applica
tion will be randomized so that
one group of patients will re
ceive the Minoxidil while the
other group receives a placebo
ointment. (A placebo is an ap
plication which has no effect. It
is used as a control in experi
ments). This will be replaced
with the drug after four
months.
Dr. David Wilkinson, ad

junct professor of dermatology
and also a coordinator of the
project, believes the drug will
be most effective for early
male-pattern baldness: "Once
the hair folicles have died,
there is not much chance."
Wilkinsen also said there is
little risk involved in the treat
ment, because the drug is in a
form such that little gets ab
sorbed into the system.
According to Wilkinson, re
searchers have already made
one valuable find: many of the
young volunteers were elimi
nated from the study when an
initial exam revealed they had
high blood pressure. Previ
ously, the men were not aware
of their condition.
