## Unreal worlds: 'Berkeley U.S.A.' – Baxter's 'Gleam' 
### GINA TRINCHERO CHRIS BUTCHKO 
If you have lost sight of
everything except that 10-
page paper due Monday, or
your upcoming chem exam,
it may be a good time to
work on the paper? Study
for chem? Of course not —
take a break and look at
what other Americans are
doing and thinking. Anne
Moose has put together an
interesting book for your
study break— Berkeley
U.S.A., a collection of inter
views with 33 of Berkeley's
". . . people who were not
only intriguing in them
selves, but who would rep
resent significant issues or
aspects of American soci
ety."

While an undergraduate at Cal, Moose was fascinated
by the Berkeley community's chaotic diversity; but her
interviews are more than a look at interesting local
characters. They are, as she says, a look at ". . . some of
the important issues of the 80s through these interesting
people in Berkeley." She shows Berkeley to be a distilla
tion of the great diversity within the American culture as
a whole; it is a community which attracts cultural, politi
cal and economic extremists. But Berkeley, U.S.A. does
not just show how unique these people are; it also

shows how a surprising number of their concerns are
shared by many other Americans.
Some of the individuals Moose interviewed were a
black nationalist, a Marine, a handicapped lawyer, a
Gray Panther, a sorority girl, a Moonie, a biker, a punk,
an English teacher, a Vietnam vet and many more. When
interviewing, Moose simply asked them to talk about
what concerned them; what she recorded was often
unexpected and rarely dull, such as the interview with
"Molly Mucus" (Mark Hawthorne). Molly is also known
as "The Hate Man" because he walks around Telegraph
Avenue shouting "I hate you!" to everyone; but at one
time he was "very straight," married, and worked for the
New York Times.

But what is more significant than Molly's refusal to
comply with societal standards is his reason for doing so,
and this is true for all of the interviews; each of these
individuals is given the opportunity to say what they feel
is right and wrong with the world, and why. Their con
cerns are as varied as the individuals themselves: bat
tered women, gay rights, nuclear arms control, CIA in
volvement in South America, religious cults, elitism and
racism, to name a few.
This book is very much like taking a walk down Tele
graph Avenue and talking to people who look interest
ing, and that is what Anne Moose did for two years; most
of us will not have the chance to hear Tim, a punk,
explain that violence was fine in the Miami riots but that
he does not think that Nazis should be allowed freedom
of speech.
While this book did give these individuals a chance to
talk about themselves, in many cases I wished that there
had been fewer interviews and that some could have
been a little longer; the number of people gets a little
overwhelming for the reader, and some interviews were
too short to be informative.
Another question is whether this book would be very
well understood outside of California. Since I have
walked down Telegraph Avenue and seen some of these
people, I was interested in what they had to say. I won
der if a person in Tulsa, Oklahoma would see much
beyond the avant-garde lifestyles to the ideas which lie
behind them — or if they would read the book at all.

The back cover shows two
men dressed in three-piece
suits lounging in wicker
chairs in an elegantly ap
pointed drawing room. Into
the scene has come a mes
senger boy with a paper
cone beak who has brought
with him an ankle-deep
flood of snow. One of the
men reads the message: "It
says. . . We are about to
become the subject of one

of Baxter's ghastly taubot stool> up W)7H A
ings. . . . SHRIEK. or TRIUMPH WHISKED OFF HIS
I have sympathy for all the boater to hiveal thc
characters who share their pompadour
fate. Glen Baxter is a sin
cerely warped man.
His cartooning style is quite the opposite, however. I
hesitate to call him an artist or a cartoonist because it
seems that if he has had any input into the pictures that
appear above the captions it has been through deft work
with an airbrush rather than through creating them with
a pen.
The drawings look like woodcuts in the classic style of
late 19th century book illustrations, but they contain
aberrations that fit perfectly with the style of the draw
ing, but not at all with the context. In one, three
medieval woodsmen stand about in a forest admiring a
box that seems to be a television. It is captioned "Robin

was certainly impressed with the simulated teakwood
finish." In another, a schoolgirl snaps "Going down to
the village again, eh?" to another girl who she has sur
prised in the act of putting away her razor and shaving
cream. Both girls are dressed in traditional school un
iform, the latter girl sporting a smart, stylish mohawk.
Sometimes the drawings are consistent, but there is a
wonderful non-sequitur in the caption. The first cartoon
in the book, in the section titled "Way Out West," (The
others are "From the Pages of History, "The Trouble at
St. Mildred's," and"The Shadow over Dringfield") has a
man's shadowed face peering intently through the
corner of a window, and a caption reading "Pecos Bill
had a 'thing' about household dust. . .
Then there are also the cartoons that are weird both
ways. Two people cower fully dressed in waist deep
water behing the shelter of a rock, watching as a man in
belted swim trunks, goggles and wearing a single feather
on his head manipulates an odd instrument before a
wooden block: The caption reads " 'There's only one
way to eat whelks,' hissed Greg."

The book is eccentric, there's no doubt, and it's heav
ily British in its humor. Still, the drawings — wherever
they're from — are wonderful, the captions are very
funny and the whole package is very appealing. How
ever, there is one bad thing about this book: It sells for
$6.95, which is rather a lot for a book of cartoons.
It is a bit of a double standard, actually, to be reluctant
to buy a hardcover cartoon book for that much,and still
feel shortchanged. The artist must have worked a long
time to draw these cartoons and five pages of them
contain more brilliant inspiration than many 200-page
books. Still, that's exchanging one injustice for another.
Crappy novels do not justify costly cartoon books.
There's very high quality in this book, but there should
be more quantity.
If you can afford to, buy it. It's funny, and will be great
to look back upon. If you can't afford it, get together
with six friends, chip in — a buck apiece, and buy it to
share. If you can't afford that, come by and borrow my
copy. We'll beat the system yet.
