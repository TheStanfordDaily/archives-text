# CINEMA SCOPE
## 
### 
Nashville (1975) *
Kresge Auditorium
Set in the country and
western music capital of the
world during the height of the
Bicentennial celebrations, Rob
ert Altman's film is a political
musical comedy, an allegorical
portrait of America, and yet the
characters are not caricatures
or emblems, and it is not easy to
dismiss any of them as mere
targets for the film's satirical
thrusts. It is also a trenchant ex
amination of the connections
between art and popular cul
ture, popular artists and their
audience, popular culture and
the people whose lives it re
flects. Perhaps no movie has
ever been assembled like this
one, with the wholesale col
laboration of the cast, who im
provised scenes and wrote or
co-wrote their own songs.
(Ronee Blakley, in a role mod
eled on Loretta Lynn, also wrote
<he monologue for her break
down scene. It was so stunning
that by the time Sissy Spacek
played the rea' Loretta Lynn in
Coal Miner's Daughter and did
an equivalent of this sequence,
it seemed old hat.) The
screenplay was in the charge of
Joan Tewkesbury. Of the 24
central performers (all of whom
are good), the most ex
traordinary are Blakley, Lily
Tomlin, Henry Gibson, Keith
Carradine, Allen Garfield, Ned
Beatty, Karen Black, Barbara
Harris, Geraldine Chaplin and
Keenan Wynn.
Plays Monday evening.
Montenegro (1981)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Many people have high
praise for this erotic comedy by
Dusan Makavejev, in which a
wife and mother, played by Sus
an Anspach, rebels against her
family and becomes involved
with a crowd of eastern Europe
an immigrants who run a sleazy
club. You're meant to laugh a
great deal more than you feel
like laughing, and you're meant
to sympathize with Susan
Anspach, who gives the kind of
self-conscious performance
that alienates an audience from
the outset. If you don't respond
to Makavejev's bizarre sensi
bility, you're likely to find the
whole experience acutely pain
ful. It isn't enough to be
bizarre; one must have talent,
too.
Plays Tuesday and Wednes
day with I Love You.

Psycho (1960) ★
Kresge Auditorium
Alfred Hitchcock's most
lauded picture. It will scare the
hell out of you if you're seeing it
for the first time; the initiated
return again and again to
marvel at the intricate design of
the suspense sequences, and
the interplay between George
Tomasini's editing and Bernard
Herrmann's jangling, ex
pressive music (scored solely
for strings during the shower
scene). Watching this Grand
Guignol comedy, with its motel
office full of stuffed birds and its
extravagant, aberrant sexual
psychology, is a perverse pleas
ure: no movie until Jaws was so
wittily sadistic in its treatment of
the audience. Anthony Perkins
is marvellous as the creepy
motel owner, Norman Bates;
the supporting cast is headed
by Janet Leigh, Vera Miles,
Martin Balsam, John Gavin,
John Mclntire and Simon Oak
land. Psycho turned out to be
Hitchcock's summit achieve
ment: none of his subsequent
half-dozen movies can even be
discussed in the same breath.
Plays tonight.
Diamonds Are Forever
(1971)
Memorial Auditorium
The seventh James Bond
movie, directed by Guy Hamil
ton, has Charles Gray, Jill St.
John, Bruce Cabot and (in a
Howard Hughes imitation) Jim
my Dean, but there's only one
important ingredient, really:
Sean Connery, returning to
play Bond for one last lark
before Roger Moore took over.
(In the sixth of the thrillers, On
Her Majesty's Secret Service,
the unspeakably wooden
George Lazenby had taken the
role.) Connery's delightful,
though the picture is con
siderably less so.
Plays Sunday evening.

The Maltese Falcon (1941)
New Varsity, Palo Alto ★
Humphrey Bogart at his best
in one of the key roles of his ca
reer: Sam Spade, the hero of
Dashiell Hammett's lean, ex
istential detective thriller, who
is misanthropic and borderline
paranoid and fiercely loyal to a
private code of ethics. Warners
bought the rights to Hammett's
novel in the very early '30s and
certainly got enough mileage
out of it: Ricardo Cortez and
Bebe Daniels starred in the first,

fairly literal version in 1931, and
then it was dressed up for Bette
Davis (with Warren William in
the Spade role) and retitled
Satan Met a Lady in 1936. The
Bogart version is, of course, de
finitive. John Huston wrote the
screenplay and directed it, his
first time out: it was a stunning

(and much talked-about) de
but. With Mary Astor(in her
best performance), Barton
Mac Lane, Lee Patrick, Gladys
George, Ward Bond, Jerome
Cowan, and a trio of homosex
ual villains (and Spade is vir
ulently anti-homosexual): Syd
ney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre
and Elisha Cook, Jr.
Plays tomorrow and Sunday
with The Big Sleep.
Another Thin Man (1939)
Festival, Palo Alto
Frances Goodrich and Albert
Hackett were still writing the
"Thin Man" pictures in 1939,
when this one was made; it was
the third in the series, and still
quite entertaining, with some
witty dialogue. The script sets
up big shouting crisis scenes
and then wryly undercutsthem,
The plot involves C. Aubrey
Smith, the trustee of Nora
Charles' (Myrna Loy's) father's
estate, who is being threatened
by a one-time employee,
played by a very young Sheldon
Leonard. The cast also includes
Otto Kruger as a dumb D.A.,
Nat Pendleton as a dumb cop,
Virginia Grey as Smith's pretty
daughter, Ruth Hussey as a mys
terious governess, Marjorie
Main as a landlady and, in a
cameo, Shep Howard. The
film's highlight is certainly the
scene in which a group of ex
cons with babies sings "Happy
Boit'day to Youse" to William
Powell and Myrna Loy's young
son. W.S. Van Dyke directed.
Plays through Wednesday.

Harold and Maude (1971)
Fox, Redwood City
This was one of Hal Ashby's
early pictures, and though it has
an eccentric appeal, it is
clumsy: sequences are ended
before they have been
punctuated with the laughs
they seem to be heading for,
and all the jokes seem to repeat
themselves. Bud Cort, the wim
py, virginal star of Altman's
Brewster McCloud (he was also
the boy Robert Duvall in
timidated in M*A*S*H, certain
ly hasn't the presence to hold
the focus of a whole movie; the
scenes that require him to take
the camera are dull. But Ruth
Gordon, in one of her rare
good movie performances,
make us understand why her
career has endured so long.
These two have a reverse May-
December affair. Despite the
treacly, pedanticside of the pic
ture (which is all about embrac
ing life and living it to the
fullest), it gets to you — perhaps
because Gordon, strutting like
a grand old vaudevillian, is a liv
ing embodiment of what
Maude believes in.
Plays today and Sunday.

The Spy Who Loved Me
(1977)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
The highlights of the tenth
James Bond movie (one of the
best of the series) are a ski se
quence which is almost as good
as the one in On Her Majesty's
Secret Service and the best vil
lain since Oddjob, the deadly
boomerang thrower in Cold
finder: "jaws" (Richard Kiel), a
giant with a mouth full of lethal
cutlery. Roger Moore and
Barbara Bach star; Lewis Gilbert
directed.
Plays tonight with Moon
raker.
The Year of Living Danger
ously *
Old Mill 6, Mountain View
Set in Indonesia in 1965, in
the last gasps of President
Sukarno's regime, Peter Weir's
film is richly, vividly enjoyable:
it has a sensuousness that was
missing from his last picture,
G allipoli, and Linda Hunt's
amazing portrayal of Billy
Kwan, a Chinese-American
photographer, gives it an emo
tional center. Without her, it
wouldn't have one; Weir has
made a cinematic guess at what
a Conrad novel might be like
without philosophy, without
conviction. It's as if he had as
similated all the old movies
he'd everseen with daringjour
nalist heroes and seething revo
lutions and feverish romances
in unlikely settings and com
pressed them into one super
deluxe entertainment. What he
has added is his own seductive
elusiveness — his suggestion
that there is more inside his
movie than meets the eye,
when in fact there isa great deal
less. It's a hell of a movie,
though. Starring Mel Gibson
and Sigourney Weaver; written
by Weir, David Williamson and
C.J. Koch; shot by that wizard,
Russell Boyd.

The seventh James Bond
movie, directed by Guy Hamil
ton, has Charles Gray, Jill St.
John, Bruce Cabot and (in a
Howard Hughes imitation) Jim
my Dean, but there's only one
important ingredient, really:
Sean Connery, returning to
play Bond for one last lark
before Roger Moore took over.
(In the sixth of the thrillers, On
Her Majesty's Secret Service,
the unspeakably wooden
George Lazenby had taken the
role.) Connery's delightful,
though the picture is con
siderably less so.
Plays Sunday evening.

The Maltese Falcon (1941)
New Varsity, Palo Alto ★
Humphrey Bogart at his best
in one of the key roles of his ca
reer: Sam Spade, the hero of
Dashiell Hammett's lean, ex
istential detective thriller, who
is misanthropic and borderline
paranoid and fiercely loyal to a
private code of ethics. Warners
bought the rights to Hammett's
novel in the very early '30s and
certainly got enough mileage
out of it: Ricardo Cortez and
Bebe Daniels starred in the first,

fairly literal version in 1931, and
then it was dressed up for Bette
Davis (with Warren William in
the Spade role) and retitled
Satan Met a Lady in 1936. The
Bogart version is, of course, de
finitive. John Huston wrote the
screenplay and directed it, his
first time out: it was a stunning

(and much talked-about) de
but. With Mary Astor(in her
best performance), Barton
Mac Lane, Lee Patrick, Gladys
George, Ward Bond, Jerome
Cowan, and a trio of homosex
ual villains (and Spade is vir
ulently anti-homosexual): Syd
ney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre
and Elisha Cook, Jr.
Plays tomorrow and Sunday
with The Big Sleep.
Another Thin Man (1939)
Festival, Palo Alto
Frances Goodrich and Albert
Hackett were still writing the
"Thin Man" pictures in 1939,
when this one was made; it was
the third in the series, and still
quite entertaining, with some
witty dialogue. The script sets
up big shouting crisis scenes
and then wryly undercutsthem,
The plot involves C. Aubrey
Smith, the trustee of Nora
Charles' (Myrna Loy's) father's
estate, who is being threatened
by a one-time employee,
played by a very young Sheldon
Leonard. The cast also includes
Otto Kruger as a dumb D.A.,
Nat Pendleton as a dumb cop,
Virginia Grey as Smith's pretty
daughter, Ruth Hussey as a mys
terious governess, Marjorie
Main as a landlady and, in a
cameo, Shep Howard. The
film's highlight is certainly the
scene in which a group of ex
cons with babies sings "Happy
Boit'day to Youse" to William
Powell and Myrna Loy's young
son. W.S. Van Dyke directed.
Plays through Wednesday.

Harold and Maude (1971)
Fox, Redwood City
This was one of Hal Ashby's
early pictures, and though it has
an eccentric appeal, it is
clumsy: sequences are ended
before they have been
punctuated with the laughs
they seem to be heading for,
and all the jokes seem to repeat
themselves. Bud Cort, the wim
py, virginal star of Altman's
Brewster McCloud (he was also
the boy Robert Duvall in
timidated in M*A*S*H, certain
ly hasn't the presence to hold
the focus of a whole movie; the
scenes that require him to take
the camera are dull. But Ruth
Gordon, in one of her rare
good movie performances,
make us understand why her
career has endured so long.
These two have a reverse May-
December affair. Despite the
treacly, pedanticside of the pic
ture (which is all about embrac
ing life and living it to the
fullest), it gets to you — perhaps
because Gordon, strutting like
a grand old vaudevillian, is a liv
ing embodiment of what
Maude believes in.
Plays today and Sunday.

The Spy Who Loved Me
(1977)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
The highlights of the tenth
James Bond movie (one of the
best of the series) are a ski se
quence which is almost as good
as the one in On Her Majesty's
Secret Service and the best vil
lain since Oddjob, the deadly
boomerang thrower in Cold
finder: "jaws" (Richard Kiel), a
giant with a mouth full of lethal
cutlery. Roger Moore and
Barbara Bach star; Lewis Gilbert
directed.
Plays tonight with Moon
raker.
The Year of Living Danger
ously *
Old Mill 6, Mountain View
Set in Indonesia in 1965, in
the last gasps of President
Sukarno's regime, Peter Weir's
film is richly, vividly enjoyable:
it has a sensuousness that was
missing from his last picture,
G allipoli, and Linda Hunt's
amazing portrayal of Billy
Kwan, a Chinese-American
photographer, gives it an emo
tional center. Without her, it
wouldn't have one; Weir has
made a cinematic guess at what
a Conrad novel might be like
without philosophy, without
conviction. It's as if he had as
similated all the old movies
he'd everseen with daringjour
nalist heroes and seething revo
lutions and feverish romances
in unlikely settings and com
pressed them into one super
deluxe entertainment. What he
has added is his own seductive
elusiveness — his suggestion
that there is more inside his
movie than meets the eye,
when in fact there isa great deal
less. It's a hell of a movie,
though. Starring Mel Gibson
and Sigourney Weaver; written
by Weir, David Williamson and
C.J. Koch; shot by that wizard,
Russell Boyd.


Nashville (1975) *
Kresge Auditorium
Set in the country and
western music capital of the
world during the height of the
Bicentennial celebrations, Rob
ert Altman's film is a political
musical comedy, an allegorical
portrait of America, and yet the
characters are not caricatures
or emblems, and it is not easy to
dismiss any of them as mere
targets for the film's satirical
thrusts. It is also a trenchant ex
amination of the connections
between art and popular cul
ture, popular artists and their
audience, popular culture and
the people whose lives it re
flects. Perhaps no movie has
ever been assembled like this
one, with the wholesale col
laboration of the cast, who im
provised scenes and wrote or
co-wrote their own songs.
(Ronee Blakley, in a role mod
eled on Loretta Lynn, also wrote
<he monologue for her break
down scene. It was so stunning
that by the time Sissy Spacek
played the rea' Loretta Lynn in
Coal Miner's Daughter and did
an equivalent of this sequence,
it seemed old hat.) The
screenplay was in the charge of
Joan Tewkesbury. Of the 24
central performers (all of whom
are good), the most ex
traordinary are Blakley, Lily
Tomlin, Henry Gibson, Keith
Carradine, Allen Garfield, Ned
Beatty, Karen Black, Barbara
Harris, Geraldine Chaplin and
Keenan Wynn.
Plays Monday evening.
Montenegro (1981)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Many people have high
praise for this erotic comedy by
Dusan Makavejev, in which a
wife and mother, played by Sus
an Anspach, rebels against her
family and becomes involved
with a crowd of eastern Europe
an immigrants who run a sleazy
club. You're meant to laugh a
great deal more than you feel
like laughing, and you're meant
to sympathize with Susan
Anspach, who gives the kind of
self-conscious performance
that alienates an audience from
the outset. If you don't respond
to Makavejev's bizarre sensi
bility, you're likely to find the
whole experience acutely pain
ful. It isn't enough to be
bizarre; one must have talent,
too.
Plays Tuesday and Wednes

Psycho (1960) ★
Kresge Auditorium
Alfred Hitchcock's most
lauded picture. It will scare the
hell out of you if you're seeing it
for the first time; the initiated
return again and again to
marvel at the intricate design of
the suspense sequences, and
the interplay between George
Tomasini's editing and Bernard
Herrmann's jangling, ex
pressive music (scored solely
for strings during the shower
scene). Watching this Grand
Guignol comedy, with its motel
office full of stuffed birds and its
extravagant, aberrant sexual
psychology, is a perverse pleas
ure: no movie until Jaws was so
wittily sadistic in its treatment of
the audience. Anthony Perkins
is marvellous as the creepy
motel owner, Norman Bates;
the supporting cast is headed
by Janet Leigh, Vera Miles,
Martin Balsam, John Gavin,
John Mclntire and Simon Oak
land. Psycho turned out to be
Hitchcock's summit achieve
ment: none of his subsequent
half-dozen movies can even be
discussed in the same breath.

ly hasn't the presence to hold
the focus of a whole movie; the
scenes that require him to take
the camera are dull. But Ruth
Gordon, in one of her rare
good movie performances,

career has endured so long.
These two have a reverse May-
December affair. Despite the
treacly, pedanticside of the pic

Plays today and Sunday.

The Spy Who Loved Me
(1977)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
The highlights of the tenth
James Bond movie (one of the
best of the series) are a ski se
quence which is almost as good
as the one in On Her Majesty's
Secret Service and the best vil
lain since Oddjob, the deadly
boomerang thrower in Cold
finder: "jaws" (Richard Kiel), a
giant with a mouth full of lethal
cutlery. Roger Moore and
Barbara Bach star; Lewis Gilbert
directed.
Plays tonight with Moon
raker.
The Year of Living Danger
ously *
Old Mill 6, Mountain View
Set in Indonesia in 1965, in
the last gasps of President
Sukarno's regime, Peter Weir's
film is richly, vividly enjoyable:
it has a sensuousness that was
missing from his last picture,
G allipoli, and Linda Hunt's
amazing portrayal of Billy
Kwan, a Chinese-American
photographer, gives it an emo
tional center. Without her, it
wouldn't have one; Weir has
made a cinematic guess at what
a Conrad novel might be like
without philosophy, without
conviction. It's as if he had as
similated all the old movies
he'd everseen with daringjour
nalist heroes and seething revo
lutions and feverish romances
in unlikely settings and com
pressed them into one super
deluxe entertainment. What he
has added is his own seductive
elusiveness — his suggestion
that there is more inside his
movie than meets the eye,
when in fact there isa great deal
less. It's a hell of a movie,
though. Starring Mel Gibson
and Sigourney Weaver; written
by Weir, David Williamson and
C.J. Koch; shot by that wizard,
Russell Boyd.


Nashville (1975) *
Kresge Auditorium
Set in the country and
western music capital of the
world during the height of the
Bicentennial celebrations, Rob
ert Altman's film is a political
musical comedy, an allegorical
portrait of America, and yet the
characters are not caricatures
or emblems, and it is not easy to
dismiss any of them as mere
targets for the film's satirical
thrusts. It is also a trenchant ex
amination of the connections
between art and popular cul
ture, popular artists and their
audience, popular culture and
the people whose lives it re
flects. Perhaps no movie has
ever been assembled like this
one, with the wholesale col
laboration of the cast, who im
provised scenes and wrote or
co-wrote their own songs.
(Ronee Blakley, in a role mod
eled on Loretta Lynn, also wrote
<he monologue for her break
down scene. It was so stunning
that by the time Sissy Spacek
played the rea' Loretta Lynn in
Coal Miner's Daughter and did
an equivalent of this sequence,
it seemed old hat.) The
screenplay was in the charge of
Joan Tewkesbury. Of the 24
central performers (all of whom
are good), the most ex
traordinary are Blakley, Lily
Tomlin, Henry Gibson, Keith
Carradine, Allen Garfield, Ned
Beatty, Karen Black, Barbara
Harris, Geraldine Chaplin and
Keenan Wynn.
Plays Monday evening.
Montenegro (1981)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Many people have high
praise for this erotic comedy by
Dusan Makavejev, in which a
wife and mother, played by Sus
an Anspach, rebels against her
family and becomes involved
with a crowd of eastern Europe
an immigrants who run a sleazy
club. You're meant to laugh a
great deal more than you feel
like laughing, and you're meant
to sympathize with Susan
Anspach, who gives the kind of
self-conscious performance
that alienates an audience from
the outset. If you don't respond
to Makavejev's bizarre sensi
bility, you're likely to find the
whole experience acutely pain
ful. It isn't enough to be
bizarre; one must have talent,
too.
Plays Tuesday and Wednes
day with I Love You.

Psycho (1960) ★
Kresge Auditorium
Alfred Hitchcock's most
lauded picture. It will scare the
hell out of you if you're seeing it
for the first time; the initiated
return again and again to
marvel at the intricate design of
the suspense sequences, and
the interplay between George
Tomasini's editing and Bernard
Herrmann's jangling, ex
pressive music (scored solely
for strings during the shower
scene). Watching this Grand
Guignol comedy, with its motel
office full of stuffed birds and its
extravagant, aberrant sexual
psychology, is a perverse pleas
ure: no movie until Jaws was so
wittily sadistic in its treatment of
the audience. Anthony Perkins
is marvellous as the creepy
motel owner, Norman Bates;
the supporting cast is headed
by Janet Leigh, Vera Miles,
Martin Balsam, John Gavin,
John Mclntire and Simon Oak
land. Psycho turned out to be
Hitchcock's summit achieve
ment: none of his subsequent
half-dozen movies can even be
discussed in the same breath.
Plays tonight.
Diamonds Are Forever
(1971)
Memorial Auditorium
The seventh James Bond
movie, directed by Guy Hamil
ton, has Charles Gray, Jill St.
John, Bruce Cabot and (in a
Howard Hughes imitation) Jim
my Dean, but there's only one
important ingredient, really:
Sean Connery, returning to
play Bond for one last lark
before Roger Moore took over.
(In the sixth of the thrillers, On
Her Majesty's Secret Service,
the unspeakably wooden
George Lazenby had taken the
role.) Connery's delightful,
though the picture is con
siderably less so.
Plays Sunday evening.

The Maltese Falcon (1941)
New Varsity, Palo Alto ★
Humphrey Bogart at his best
in one of the key roles of his ca
reer: Sam Spade, the hero of
Dashiell Hammett's lean, ex
istential detective thriller, who
is misanthropic and borderline
paranoid and fiercely loyal to a
private code of ethics. Warners
bought the rights to Hammett's
novel in the very early '30s and
certainly got enough mileage
out of it: Ricardo Cortez and
Bebe Daniels starred in the first,

fairly literal version in 1931, and
then it was dressed up for Bette
Davis (with Warren William in
the Spade role) and retitled
Satan Met a Lady in 1936. The
Bogart version is, of course, de
finitive. John Huston wrote the
screenplay and directed it, his
first time out: it was a stunning

(and much talked-about) de
but. With Mary Astor(in her
best performance), Barton
Mac Lane, Lee Patrick, Gladys
George, Ward Bond, Jerome
Cowan, and a trio of homosex
ual villains (and Spade is vir
ulently anti-homosexual): Syd
ney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre
and Elisha Cook, Jr.
Plays tomorrow and Sunday
with The Big Sleep.
Another Thin Man (1939)
Festival, Palo Alto
Frances Goodrich and Albert
Hackett were still writing the
"Thin Man" pictures in 1939,
when this one was made; it was
the third in the series, and still
quite entertaining, with some
witty dialogue. The script sets
up big shouting crisis scenes
and then wryly undercutsthem,
The plot involves C. Aubrey
Smith, the trustee of Nora
Charles' (Myrna Loy's) father's
estate, who is being threatened
by a one-time employee,
played by a very young Sheldon
Leonard. The cast also includes
Otto Kruger as a dumb D.A.,
Nat Pendleton as a dumb cop,
Virginia Grey as Smith's pretty
daughter, Ruth Hussey as a mys
terious governess, Marjorie
Main as a landlady and, in a
cameo, Shep Howard. The
film's highlight is certainly the
scene in which a group of ex
cons with babies sings "Happy
Boit'day to Youse" to William
Powell and Myrna Loy's young
son. W.S. Van Dyke directed.
Plays through Wednesday.

Harold and Maude (1971)
Fox, Redwood City
This was one of Hal Ashby's
early pictures, and though it has
an eccentric appeal, it is
clumsy: sequences are ended
before they have been
punctuated with the laughs
they seem to be heading for,
and all the jokes seem to repeat
themselves. Bud Cort, the wim
py, virginal star of Altman's
Brewster McCloud (he was also
the boy Robert Duvall in
timidated in M*A*S*H, certain
ly hasn't the presence to hold
the focus of a whole movie; the
scenes that require him to take
the camera are dull. But Ruth
Gordon, in one of her rare
good movie performances,
make us understand why her
career has endured so long.
These two have a reverse May-
December affair. Despite the
treacly, pedanticside of the pic
ture (which is all about embrac
ing life and living it to the
fullest), it gets to you — perhaps
because Gordon, strutting like
