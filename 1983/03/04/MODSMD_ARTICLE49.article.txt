# Budget cuts to begin in '83-'84
## 
### DOUGLAS JEHL Senior staff writer 
Details of a slow-growth, belt
tightening University operating
budget for 1983-84 were presented to
the Faculty Senate by Provost Albert
Hastorf yesterday.
The $227 million budget is ex
pected to be approved by the board
of trustees next week.
Although balanced, the budget
calls for more than $2 million in
spending cutbacks, and is only 7.9
percent larger than last year's budget
— a real growth rate of just under 2
percent, substantially iess than in the
past few years.
Administrators say the budget rep
resents the first step in a substantial
three-year budget reduction pro
gram — the first such program in a
decade. Without such reductions,
the University would face a $4 million
deficit in 1984-85.
"The institution is of necessity
tightening its belt some. It's taking a
hard look at its costs. We are trying to
disrupt academic programs as little
as possible," Hastorf told the senate.
The majority of the budget cuts are
slated to come in administrative and
operations costs. These areas, or
cost pools, had previously been
targeted for reductions in an effort to
reduce the overhead recovery rate
the University charges government
sponsors of research.
Hastorf said potential federal deci
sions about this overhead rate make
any long-range forecast highly tenta
tive.
"I really believe that this is a safe
and sane budget,"he said. "But
things can occur, especially in Wash
ington D.C. But have no fear, we'll
put (University President) Donald
(Kennedy) on an airplane and disas
ter will be avoided."
Faculty salaries are slated to rise

only 6.3 percent next year. "They are
not going up the way we would like
to see them go up," Hastorf said.
Earlier in the meeting, Hastorf
stunned some faculty in reporting
that the School of Humanities and
Sciences will change its faculty ap
pointment schedule so that most te
nure decisions will be made in an
assistant professor's seventh year in
stead of the sixth.

At least two senators said they were
"appalled" not to have known earlier
that such a change was permissible.
Many said that while they approved
of the new policy, they had previ
ously thought the sixth-year decision
was a University requirement.
The heated discussion about te
nure policy came after Hastorf, in his
provost's report, announced that he
had sent a memo to deans regarding
terms of faculty appointment. He did

this, he said, in response to a strong
desire on the part of deans that
junior fatuity be given a longer time
to prove themselves as teachers and
scholars.
Although the School of Engineer
ing will continue with its three-plus
three system, the School of
Humanities and Sciences has opted
to go to a three-plus-four system.
This announcement sparked out
cry from professors who had under
stood that the University required
tenure decisions to be made after six
years of teaching. "Are you telling
me that all along it was seven?" asked
History Prof. Carl Degler.
Others said such a change should
have come to the attention of the
senate before it was made. Hastorf
countered that it was a decision to be
made within each individual school.
"We are not changing anything in the
University's tenure policy," he said.
In other action, the senate:
•Voted unanimously to accept a
report recommending continuation
of the quarter system. As in the last
senate meeting, humanities profes
sors argued at length about the
merits of the semester system and
thedangers of quarters. "Only under
systems longer than the quarter is it
possible for students to do responsi
ble writing," said English Prof.
Ronald Rebholz.
•Was told by University President
Donald Kennedy that the naming of a
new vice president for development
is perhaps three weeks away, and a
search for a new director of the Stan
ford University Press is also "down to
the very short strokes."
•Was reminded of the sections of
the honor code regarding faculty
conduct. "I'm asking that we all en
gage in an effort to review and make
prominent these provisions," Ken
nedy said.

was a University requirement.
The heated discussion about te
nure policy came after Hastorf, in his
provost's report, announced that he
had sent a memo to deans regarding
terms of faculty appointment. He did

this, he said, in response to a strong
desire on the part of deans that
junior fatuity be given a longer time
to prove themselves as teachers and
scholars.
Although the School of Engineer
ing will continue with its three-plus
three system, the School of
Humanities and Sciences has opted
to go to a three-plus-four system.
This announcement sparked out
cry from professors who had under
stood that the University required
tenure decisions to be made after six
years of teaching. "Are you telling
me that all along it was seven?" asked
History Prof. Carl Degler.
Others said such a change should
have come to the attention of the
senate before it was made. Hastorf
countered that it was a decision to be
made within each individual school.
"We are not changing anything in the
University's tenure policy," he said.
In other action, the senate:
•Voted unanimously to accept a
report recommending continuation
of the quarter system. As in the last
senate meeting, humanities profes
sors argued at length about the
merits of the semester system and
thedangers of quarters. "Only under
systems longer than the quarter is it
possible for students to do responsi
ble writing," said English Prof.
Ronald Rebholz.
•Was told by University President
Donald Kennedy that the naming of a
new vice president for development
is perhaps three weeks away, and a
search for a new director of the Stan
ford University Press is also "down to
the very short strokes."
•Was reminded of the sections of
the honor code regarding faculty
conduct. "I'm asking that we all en
gage in an effort to review and make
prominent these provisions," Ken
nedy said.
