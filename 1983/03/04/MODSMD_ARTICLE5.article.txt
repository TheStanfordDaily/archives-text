House approves jobs bill
Washington — The House passed 324-95 yesterday
a $4.9 billion package of recession relief designed to
provide temporary employment for nearly one mil
lion people as well as food and shelter for the
neediest.
The plan was attached to $5 billion in funds needed
to assure continued payment of unemployment ben
efits. Together, these provisions constitute the first
major anti-recession initiative of the 98th Congress
that took office two months ago.
Final passage came after the House adopted a last
minute proposal requiring that most of the jobs funds
go to areas with high unemployment. The vote on
that provision was 335-83.

The Senate is expected to approve its own, slightly
less expensive legislation next week. President Rea
gan, after abandoning earlier opposition to such a
jobs bill, has signaled he will probably sign the meas
ure when it reaches his desk.
"I hope that the president will help us do more, by
supporting a second-phase program that restores
confidence to those still facing economic tragedy,"
House Speaker Thomas "Tip" O'Neill, said in a
statement issued after the vote.
