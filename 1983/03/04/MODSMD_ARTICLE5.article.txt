House approves jobs bill
Washington — The House passed 324-95 yesterday
a $4.9 billion package of recession relief designed to
provide temporary employment for nearly one mil
lion people as well as food and shelter for the
neediest.
The plan was attached to $5 billion in funds needed
to assure continued payment of unemployment ben
efits. Together, these provisions constitute the first
major anti-recession initiative of the 98th Congress
that took office two months ago.
Final passage came after the House adopted a last
minute proposal requiring that most of the jobs funds
go to areas with high unemployment. The vote on
that provision was 335-83.

The Senate is expected to approve its own, slightly
less expensive legislation next week. President Rea
gan, after abandoning earlier opposition to such a
jobs bill, has signaled he will probably sign the meas
ure when it reaches his desk.
"I hope that the president will help us do more, by
supporting a second-phase program that restores
confidence to those still facing economic tragedy,"
House Speaker Thomas "Tip" O'Neill, said in a
statement issued after the vote.
Pope may cancel visit
San Jose, Costa Rica — A bitter papal protest against
the executions of six men by the government of
Guatemala yesterday raised the possibility that the
scheduled visit of Pope John Paul II to that country
Sunday night and Monday may be canceled.
Despite a Vatican plea to the Guatemalan govern
ment of born-again Christian Gen. Efrain Rios Montt,
the six men died before a firing squad at dawn yester
day.
In Costa Rica, where the pontiff spent a busy sec
ond day of his current eight-day, eight-country pil
grimage to Central America and the Caribbean, the
Holy See reacted to the executions by issuing a
scorching statement from the papal nuncio to
Guatemala and an expression of profound sadness by
the pope himself.
"The Holy Father, on getting the dramatic, unex
pected and unbelievable news has expressed all of his
most profound sadness, above all because this oc
curred on the eve of his already scheduled visittothat
country," Father Romeo Panciroli, official spokesman
in the papal entourage, said.
Burford pressured to resign
Washington — Environmental Protection Agency
Administrator Anne Burford came under increasing
congressional and Reagan administration pressure
yesterday to resign as White House officials compiled
a list of possible replacements for Burford and her
senior aides.
Burford, described by associates as "under
enormous stress," told reporters that she had no plans
to resign. She spent yesterday defending the EPA's
1984 budget proposal before a House Appropriations
subcommittee.
"The agency is in a very difficult situation," Burford
said. "I hope to provide the leadership (to) the tal
ented staff... to make sure they can go on about the
jobs that we all came to do — which is environmental
protection."
But several administration officials said that senior
White House aides now consider Burford a serious
political liability to President Reagan and are signaling
herto resign, even though Reagan has expressed con
fidence in her publicly.
OPEC talks proceed
London — Eight OPEC oil ministers made progress
yesterday in talks to avert a worldwide price war, but
not enough to call an emergency meeting of the
cartel, they said.
"We hope there will be agreement," Venezuelan
Energy Minister Humberto Calderon Berti said after
the 5-hour meeting. "There is still more work to do,
and we will meet again tomorrow (today)."
Calderon Berti has emerged as a peacemaker in
trying to prevent pricing anarchy among the 13 na
tions in the once-powerful Organization of Petrole
um E<port; r, .g Countries and non-members such as
Britain, Norway and Mexico, fighting for sales in a sag
ging world market.
The Venezuelan said after his arrival in London late

Wednesday: "If we have a consensus, we call the
meeting."
But Saudi Oil Minister Sheik Ahmed Zaki Yamani,
another influential OPEC minister, said there were
few signs they were closer to such a consensus. Asked
about an OPEC summit, he said only: "We shall speak
tomorrow."
Violence mars West Bank
Jerusalem — Armed Israeli settlers invaded an Arab
school and held several students at gunpoint yester
day shortly before other settlers blockaded the main
Bethlehem-Hebron highway as a new wave of vio
lence swept through the occupied West Bank.
Arab protesters threw stones at Israeli vehicles in a
series of incidents stretching from Hebron in the
south to Nablus in the north. The Israeli army im
posed a curfew in the Nablus market area.
Israeli police reportedly were investigating possible
links between anti-Arab vigilante actions and the
murder of a jewish Peace Now activist who was killed
in a hand grenade attack outside Prime Minister Men
achem Begin's office in Jerusalem.
El Salvador may move elections
San Salvador, El Salvador — Salvadoran political
leaders confirmed yesterday that the government is
actively considering advancing the presidential elec
tions by several months.
"We are going to have elections in December/'de
clared Julio Rey Prendes, leader of the 24-member
bloc of Christian Democrats in the Constituent As
sembly.
Previously, government leaders had talked of hold
ing the elections in March 1984.
Officially, the government would not confirm the
reports and other political figures would not go as far
as Rey Prendes in setting a date. It was apparent, how
ever, that the idea of moving upthe balloting has con
siderable support.
