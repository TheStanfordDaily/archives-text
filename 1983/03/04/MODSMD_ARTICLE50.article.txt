A correction in the March 3 Daily in
correctly stated that the Black Student
Union (BSU) has not issued an official
statement outlining its position on the
boycott of the proposed course "Racial
Discrimination and Civil Rights." The
BSU did issue an official statement
which was summarized in the March 2
Daily. An article on the ASSU denial of
approval to the BSU to appear on the
fee assessment ballot also stated incor

rectly that Leslie Talbot attended the
ASSU meeting.
Yesterday's Daily erroneously
stated that KZSU, rather than the
ASSU, is a member of the Concert
Network. The Daily regrets the error.
