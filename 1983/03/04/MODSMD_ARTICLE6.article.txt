# Unequal housing-rates hike due
## 
### DOUGLAS JEHL Senior staff writer 
In the name of equity, University
housing rates are slated to rise un
equally next year, meaning some res
idents will have to bear increases far
steeper than the overall 14.S percent
hike already approved.
Hardest hit will likely be students
living in self-ops and co-ops and in
the suites in Governor's Corner,
Their rates could increase by as mui h
as JO percent over this year's figures.
The unequal increases are recom
mended in a University task group
report that officials say will be ac
cepted in essence if not in detail. The
report, which is currently under re

view, does not recommend specific
figures for increases.
The changes ar*' designed to en
sure that each student is ( harged the
same rate for services he uses. They
are the result of the first re -
evaluation of housing rates here
since 1977.
"It was time to take a look at the
rate structure and see whether
facilities are priced properly," Ed
Scoles, director of housing.ind food
services, said recently.
In view of the steep increases that
some residents face, Scoles
said officials are considering delay
ing the imposition of a purely equit
able system.

A minority report, submitted by
graduate student task group mem
bers, was critical of University
policies relating to housing rates.
(See related story, page 2.)
According to the task group re
port, residents of the suites, with an
annual housing bill of $IS7f), are get
ting the best deal this year. If the rate
structure was made equitable, they
would have paid an increase
of nearly 17 percent. The task group
said self-op and co-op rates, if equit
able, would have been 13 percent
higher this year.
Those recommendations, how
ever, were for this year only. Com
mittee members did not have access
to enough information to recom
mend specific rates for 1983-84.
That information is being evalu
ated now by Linda Mclntyre, finan
cial analyst for housing and food ser
vices. She, Scoles and Norm Robin
son, associate dean of Residential
Education, will set revised rates for
next year in the next few weeks,
show them to the task group for ap
proval, and then submit them to Wil
liam Massy, vice president for busi
ness and finance.
According to Scoles, the relative
ranking of increases necessary may
change because of new factors, in
cluding the $2 million of new debt
service for Governor's Corner that all
residents in the system will have to
bear.
But Scoles said the committee's
recommendation that rates for the
suites and self-ops/co-ops should
rise at the steepest rates will likely

stand. The main reason for these
steep increases are misjudgments in
rate-setting for the suites and
under-charging of kitchen costs for
those residences with their own
kitchens.
"In setting rates for the suites this
year," Scoles said, "it was very much
of a prospective situation."
The differences in rates are meant
only to ensure equity in charging for
services. The University remains
committed to a policy that ignores
amenities such as the age and de
sirability of the building and the size
of the rooms when it sets housing
rates. For this reason, a resident of a
single in 558 Mayfield pays the same
room rate as a resident of a two-room
double in Stern.
When the task group was estab
lished in June, Scoles stated in a
memo to it that existing and con
templated changes in the housing
system, as well as changes in the
levels and costs of services,
suggested the need for a review of
pricing. The objective of the task
force, Scoles wrote in the memo, "is
to provide an equitable rate structure
for on-campus housing for 1983-84."

The task force was asked to rec
ommend rates for each of nine
categories of housing ranging from
standard undergraduate residences
to Escondido Village.
To ensure that residents were
charged equitably for services re
ceived, the task force first identified
services like custodial service and
residential education provided un
equally to different residences, and
established formulas to allocate
those costs fairly.
For the suites, apartments and
other residences with their own
kitchens, the task force allocated
costs in the same manner with what
is essentially rent on kitchen and din
ing space.
This rate is allocated by floor
space, so residents of an apartment
would pay a larger amount than
those living in a self-op.
Students who live in residences
that offer food service pay this
charge in their board rates.
Remaining costs, including con
struction — and thus most of the
debt service for Governor's Corner
— are divided equally among all resi
dents of the housing system.

"In setting rates for the suites this
year," Scoles said, "it was very much
of a prospective situation."
The differences in rates are meant
only to ensure equity in charging for
services. The University remains
committed to a policy that ignores
amenities such as the age and de
sirability of the building and the size
of the rooms when it sets housing
rates. For this reason, a resident of a
single in 558 Mayfield pays the same
room rate as a resident of a two-room
double in Stern.
When the task group was estab
lished in June, Scoles stated in a
memo to it that existing and con
templated changes in the housing
system, as well as changes in the
levels and costs of services,
suggested the need for a review of
pricing. The objective of the task
force, Scoles wrote in the memo, "is
to provide an equitable rate structure
for on-campus housing for 1983-84."

The task force was asked to rec
ommend rates for each of nine
categories of housing ranging from
standard undergraduate residences
to Escondido Village.
To ensure that residents were
charged equitably for services re
ceived, the task force first identified
services like custodial service and
residential education provided un
equally to different residences, and
established formulas to allocate
those costs fairly.
For the suites, apartments and
other residences with their own
kitchens, the task force allocated
costs in the same manner with what
is essentially rent on kitchen and din
ing space.
This rate is allocated by floor
space, so residents of an apartment
would pay a larger amount than
those living in a self-op.
Students who live in residences
that offer food service pay this
charge in their board rates.
Remaining costs, including con
struction — and thus most of the
debt service for Governor's Corner
— are divided equally among all resi
dents of the housing system.
In the name of equity, University
housing rates are slated to rise un
equally next year, meaning some res
idents will have to bear increases far
steeper than the overall 14.S percent
hike already approved.
Hardest hit will likely be students
living in self-ops and co-ops and in
the suites in Governor's Corner,
Their rates could increase by as mui h
as JO percent over this year's figures.
The unequal increases are recom
mended in a University task group
report that officials say will be ac
cepted in essence if not in detail. The
report, which is currently under re

view, does not recommend specific
figures for increases.
The changes ar*' designed to en
sure that each student is ( harged the
same rate for services he uses. They
are the result of the first re -
evaluation of housing rates here
since 1977.
"It was time to take a look at the
rate structure and see whether
facilities are priced properly," Ed
Scoles, director of housing.ind food
services, said recently.
In view of the steep increases that
some residents face, Scoles
said officials are considering delay
ing the imposition of a purely equit
able system.

A minority report, submitted by
graduate student task group mem
bers, was critical of University
policies relating to housing rates.
(See related story, page 2.)
According to the task group re
port, residents of the suites, with an
annual housing bill of $IS7f), are get
ting the best deal this year. If the rate
structure was made equitable, they
would have paid an increase
of nearly 17 percent. The task group
said self-op and co-op rates, if equit
able, would have been 13 percent
higher this year.
Those recommendations, how
ever, were for this year only. Com
mittee members did not have access
to enough information to recom
mend specific rates for 1983-84.
That information is being evalu
ated now by Linda Mclntyre, finan
cial analyst for housing and food ser
vices. She, Scoles and Norm Robin
son, associate dean of Residential
Education, will set revised rates for
next year in the next few weeks,
show them to the task group for ap
proval, and then submit them to Wil
liam Massy, vice president for busi
ness and finance.
According to Scoles, the relative
ranking of increases necessary may
change because of new factors, in
cluding the $2 million of new debt
service for Governor's Corner that all
residents in the system will have to
bear.
But Scoles said the committee's
recommendation that rates for the
suites and self-ops/co-ops should
rise at the steepest rates will likely

stand. The main reason for these
steep increases are misjudgments in
rate-setting for the suites and
under-charging of kitchen costs for
those residences with their own
kitchens.
