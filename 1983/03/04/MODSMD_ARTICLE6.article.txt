# Unequal housing-rates hike due
## 
### DOUGLAS JEHL Senior staff writer 
In the name of equity, University
housing rates are slated to rise un
equally next year, meaning some res
idents will have to bear increases far
steeper than the overall 14.S percent
hike already approved.
Hardest hit will likely be students
living in self-ops and co-ops and in
the suites in Governor's Corner,
Their rates could increase by as mui h
as JO percent over this year's figures.
The unequal increases are recom
mended in a University task group
report that officials say will be ac
cepted in essence if not in detail. The
report, which is currently under re

view, does not recommend specific
figures for increases.
The changes ar*' designed to en
sure that each student is ( harged the
same rate for services he uses. They
are the result of the first re -
evaluation of housing rates here
since 1977.
"It was time to take a look at the
rate structure and see whether
facilities are priced properly," Ed
Scoles, director of housing.ind food
services, said recently.
In view of the steep increases that
some residents face, Scoles
said officials are considering delay
ing the imposition of a purely equit
able system.

A minority report, submitted by
graduate student task group mem
bers, was critical of University
policies relating to housing rates.

According to the task group re
port, residents of the suites, with an
annual housing bill of $IS7f), are get
ting the best deal this year. If the rate
structure was made equitable, they
would have paid an increase
of nearly 17 percent. The task group
said self-op and co-op rates, if equit
able, would have been 13 percent
higher this year.
Those recommendations, how
ever, were for this year only. Com
