## Don't register, students advised 
### BOB COHN Staff writer 
Panel members spoke out against draft registration
and increased military recruitment and expressed regret
about tapering student awareness and involvement in
draft resistance at an informal discussion last night in
Terman Auditorium.
"I feel that there are many ways to resist the draft, and
being a public non-registrant is just one of them," said
panelist David Wayte, who was indicted last July for
refusing to register. "Trying to be a more peaceful and
loving person" is another aspect, he said.
Wayte was joined on the panel by Paul Baer, a public
non-registrant and member of Stanford Against Con
scription (SAC), Helen Michalowski, organizer and
counselor with the War Resisters' League West, and
John Murdock, another public non-registrant and
member of the American Indian Movement.
Wayte's case was dismissed in a Los Angeles court on
grounds of "selective prosecution."
"I decided not to register because I didn't want to be a
part of my country's military build-up," said Wayte. "I
was proud of my decision so I went public." His publicity
brought letters from Washington and ultimately the na
tion's third refusal-to-register indictment.
Wayte was indeed finally prosecuted, but his case was
dismissed when his lawyers argued that he was singled
out only because he "was noisy" about his refusal to
register. Furthermore, the judge ruled that "the draft
registration law was invalid," he said.
Although the U.S. government has appealed the case,
Wayte is excited about the precedent set. "I'm hoping
that we can stop the registration law. If it goes to the
Supreme Court it will stop draft registration throughout
the country.
Michalowski spoke on "the connection between the
draft and military recruitment." She said that the multi
plying sign-up rate is a reflection of hard economic times
and media and government "brainwashing." Baer noted
that 400,000 people annually are joining the military.

"If the unemployment rate went down 1 percent, the
enlistment rate would go down almost 9 percent," said
Michalowski.
She added that "recruiters challenge young men
about their sexuality, calling them sissy and queer if they
aren't dominant, aggressive," and don't have "automa
tic violent responses." Being in the military "does some
thing to your head," she concluded.
Baer recognized that man's desire to avoid warfare
stems from religion. "The reason you don't want to fight
wars is because wars kill people and people are meant to
be loved, not killed." He said that he became a public
non-registrant because "it's a way of expressing my
commitment."
Matt Nicodemus, a founding member of SAC, said,
"The anti-draft movement does not try to tell people
whatto do,"but rather just inform them of theiralterna
tives. "A lot of people don't even know they have the
option not to register," he said.
The draft resistance talk was the climax of Draft
Awareness Week here on campus. The week's pro
grams, which included workshops and panels on the
history of the draft, the link between draft registration
and financial aid, and women and resistance, were
sponsored by SAC and the Stanford Progressive Alliance
(SPA).
SAC member Dana Price said there is "a need to see
the resistance movement as more than just resisting the
draft." She expressed the importance of reducing in
creasing militarism. "We're up against a way of thinking
that is pervasive in our society," she said.
"There have been a lot of problems" with the week,
according to Baer. "One is, our own organization and
publicity have of weak; the other is that
people just don't care too much."
"It is frustrating to see so few people; I think of how
much more effect we could have if we had more people
organizing or writing their congresspeople,"
Nicodemus said.
