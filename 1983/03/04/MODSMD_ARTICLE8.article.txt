# Soviet group urges arms freeze
## 
### GLENN BAKER Staff writer 
On the third stop of their 14-day
goodwill tour of the United States, a
Soviet peace delegation yesterday
called for increased relations be
tween the two superpowers and nu
clear disarmament as the "only sane
alternative" to the burgeoning nu
clear arms race.
janis Brolish, the leader of the de
legation, declared that "a half a year
ago we froze the production of nu
clear weapons. We don't produce
Cruise missiles and have neither land
nor sea bombers, though the U.S.
has already put them on the produc
tion line."
Furthermore, Brolish claimed, "we
don't have missiles like the MX,
which the U.S. insists on produc
ing." He continued in a positive vein,
however, stating that "the Soviet
Union welcomed the recent an
nouncement of the U.S. Senate not
to fund the deployment of the MX
missile."
lohn Mattox, director of the Stan
ford Arms Control and Disarmament
Forum (SACDF) and organizer of the
luncheon, gave a perspective on the
Soviet stance. Though "75 percent of

it was propaganda," he commented,
"we are still hopeful. It is an avenue
we need to pursue, for we cannot
hope to negotiate an arms treaty
without an understanding of their
views."
Mattox added, "(Former Soviet
Secretary-General Leonid) Brezhnev
said he would stop the deployment
of the SS-20. He did not say they
would stop construction."
Perrin French, a member of the
Physicians for Social Responsibility
and a professor at the Stanford Med
ical School, refuted Brolish's claims,
emphasizing "the U.S. and the USSR
each build three more nuclear
weapons each day." Moreover, he
said, "soon, one-half of the scientists
in the world will work directly or in
directly with the military. Our gov
ernment is using the best brains to
build our graves."
Brolish also lamented the fact that
the United States does not seem
amenable tc Soviet proposals: to re
duce strategic weapons by 25 per
cent and nuclear weapons by some
two-thirds by 1990. He described
President Reagan's decision not to
even read the proposal as "an ap
proach suitable for the Stone Age,
and not for the 20th century."

There was also some disagreement
about the effectiveness of the peace
movement in the Soviet Union.
Danelus Mitskyavichus, a secretary
of the board of the Journalistic Union
of Lithunia, declared, "I here are
very many organizations in the USSR
which devote much time and effort
to this objective. We have a Peace
Council, a Peace Fund and many
unions which are very involved in the
peace effort."
Hal Harvey, a member of SACDF
and the International Disarmament
Forum, disagreed, emphasizing that
the U.S. peace movement has "no
similar independent peace move
ment in the USSR." He continued,
"They have not allowed even the
simplest peace ideas to be translated
to the. people without government
interference. Thus, the American
peace movement is seen as unilat
eral."
Mattox agreed with Harvey, point
ing out that "there is some repres
sion of the Soviet peace movement."
Furthermore, he said, "These people
(the members of the delegation) are
carefully screened. They were
picked to make the USSR look good
and for their faithfulness to com
munist ideology."
