# Grads criticize housing rate hikes
## 
### DOUGLAS JEHL Senior staff writer 
In yet another attack on the
University's housing system,
graduate student members of a
committee created to evaluate
housing rates have strongly
criticized a newly clarified policy
that counts housing for grads and
undergrads as part of the same
system.
The policy is unfair to graduate
students, they say, because it
forces them to subsidize housing
occupied only by under
graduates. They charge that it was
adopted out of necessity to
spread among more students the
tremendous burden of debt ser
vice for Governor's Corner, and
question whether the University
will ever build more on-campus
graduate housing.
The criticism, which has
sparked little reaction from ad
ministrators here, came in a de
tailed minority report of the task
group on housing rates. It was
submitted last month by all four of
the graduate students on the
committee.
The report points out that the
last time a housing rate report was
done, in 1977, Escondido Village
and Mirrielees were regarded as
separate and distinct from the rest
of the University housing system.

This has long been the case;
graduate student residents bore
the cost of construction for the
Village without any subsidy from
others in the University.
"We are unpersuaded by the
justice of . . . requiring graduate
students living in graduate hous
ing to pay higher rents in order to
finance expensive new under
graduate housing in which they
are barred from living," the report
said.
In an interview, Ed Scoles, di
rector of housing and food ser
vices, disputed the notion that the
idea of establishing a single hous
ing system was a new one. When
the board of trustees first decided
in 1979 to go ahead with Gover
nor's Corner, he said, it was with
the assumption that the debt
would be spread over a larger
base than just undergraduates.
According to Scoles, rates have
been set since then with this in
mind. This is just the first time it
has been articulated officially.
The graduate students have
raised "interesting arguments,"
Scoles said, "but this isn't a new
issue. We've heard those argu
ments before."
Scoles pointed out that even

though graduate students are
excluded from the 800-person
Governor's Corner complex, they
will have about 335 more on
campus spaces because of its con
struction. About 260 of these
spaces will be in Manzanita Park's
trailers.
He said graduate students seek
ing housing would not have bene
fited at all had the University kept
the two systems separate. "All we
could have done would have been
to build a 400-student complex,
which would have meant that no
grad student would have been al
lowed to move into Manzanita,"
he said.
In addition to criticizing the
"one-system" policy, the minority
report also challenged the long
term policy of ignoring amenities
in setting room rates for under
graduate housing. The authors
suggested that students living in
single rooms be charged more
than those living in doubles or tri
ples, and that those living in de
sirable residences by charged
extra also.
The graduate student authors of
the minority report were Eric
Berg, economics; David Daleke,
chemistry; jim McGrath, com
puter science; and Eric Pearson,
materials science and engineer
ing.
