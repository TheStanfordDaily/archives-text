HOW TO
STOP DRUNK DRIVING.
TOUGH LAWS MAY HELP, BUT WE ALSO NEED TO CHANGE OUR ATTITUDES.
Do you know anyone
who's in favor of drunk
driving? Not likely. And yet
many people have driven when
under the influence of alcohol,
or will do it at least once.
Take a look at some
chilling statistics. One out of
every two of us will be in
volved in an alcohol-related
accident sometime during our
lives. Last year alone, more
than 25,000 people died in
such accidents; an additional
1.5 million were injured. A
disproportionate number of
those killed were under 25
years old.
The cost of drunk-driving
accidents amounts to over $24
billion every year in property
damage, loss of wages, medical
and legal fees. Not to mention
the emotional pain to the vic
tims' families and friends.
What is being done
about it? Over the years,
many different approaches
have been tried: mandatory
jail sentences, stiff fines,
license suspensions, alcohol
rehabilitation programs, and
higher drinking-age laws.
No single countermeas
ure seems to do the job by
itself. Tough laws, unless they
are supported by equally tough
enforcement and the certainty
of punishment, don't seem to
work over the long run. Even
with all three, probably the
most effective single thing we
could do is to examine our
own attitudes about drinking
and driving.
How much do you really
know about the effects of
alcohol? The facts may sur
prise you. For example, a lot
of people believe that beer
and wine are less intoxicat
ing than other drinks. In
fact, a can of beer, a glass
of wine, or a drink
of 86-proof liquor are all
about equally intoxicating.
A lot of factors deter
mine how quickly you'll get
drunk. Your body weight, how
much you've had to eat, and
the number of drinks you have
over a specified time all make
a difference. That's why it's
so hard to know when you've
had too much.
A common legal defini
tion of intoxication is .10 per
cent blood-alcohol level. For
a 160 lb. person, it takes about
four or five drinks in the first
two hours on an empty stom
ach to reach the legal limit,
compared with three or four
drinks in the first two hours
for someone who weighs 120
lbs. Of course, your judgment
and reaction time will be
impaired well before you reach
the legal limit.
At General Motors, we're
very concerned about the
effects of drinking on driv
ing. Over a decade ago, we
developed a device that tests
a driver's reflexes and motor
responses before starting the
car. The Department of Trans
portation is now field-testing
that device.
We also strongly favor
all efforts that focus attention
on the problem such as the
Presidential Commission on
Drunk Driving. Make sure
your friends and family know
the facts about mixing alco
hol and driving. Drunk driv
ing will only stop when we
all decide it isn't socially
acceptable. Be self-confident
enough to admit when you've
had too much to drink to drive
safely.
Meanwhile, seat belts
are still your best protec
tion against drunk drivers.
They can't prevent an acci
dent, but they will help save
your life during a serious
crash— whatever the cause.
