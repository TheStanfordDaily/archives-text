HERPES
How to ovoid that awful question.
■ here's no surer way to destroy
delicate romantic feelings than with
that awful question, You don't have
herpes, do you?"
Dut since it's a subject that,
these days, has to come up, why not
give the answer first —so nobody
has to ask.
The nicest way is with the
attractive "No Herpes "™ lapel pin or
pendant with gold plated chain.
Doth ore heavy gold plated medal
lions with a white professionally enameled "H" and a diagonal red line.
They're terrific values at only $12.95—a small price, indeed, to save
o romance. Get one for yourself or as an amusing gift. Dut just remember: it's
a sin to tell a lie.
