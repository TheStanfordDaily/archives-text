Take Charge At 22.
In most jobs, at 22
you're near the bottom
of the ladder.
In the Navy, at
22 you can be a leader.
After just 16 weeks
of leadership training,
you're an officer. You'll
have the kind of job
your education and training prepared
you for, and the decision-making au
thority you need to make the most of it.
As a college graduate and officer
candidate, your Navy training is geared
to making you a leader. There is no boot
camp. Instead, you receive professional
training to help you build the technical
and management skills you'll need as a
Navy officer.
This training is
designed to instill
confidence by first
hand experience. You
learn by doing. On
your first sea tour,

It's a bigger chal
lenge and a lot more
responsibility than
most corporations give
you at 22. The rewards
are bigger, too. There's
a comprehensive package of benefits,
including special duty pay. The starting
salary is $16,400 —more than most com
panies would pay you right out of college.
After four years, with regular promo
tions and pay increases, your salary will
have increased to as much as $29,800.
As a Navy officer, you grow, through
new challenges, new tests of your skills,
and new opportunities
to advance your edu
cation, including the
possibility of attending
graduate school while
you're in the Navy.
Don't just take a
job. Become a Navy
officer, and take charge.
Even at 22.
