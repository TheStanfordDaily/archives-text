# Faculty clarifies Mosher dismissal
## 
### DOUGLAS JEHL Senior staff writer 
In a statement that seems to dis
credit comments made by Steven
Mosher, Anthropology Department
faculty said Monday that Mosher was
expelled from the University two
weeks ago for "illegal and seriously
unethical conduct" while conduct
ing research in China.
This runs counter to Mosher's
claim that the key reason for his dis
missal was an article about Chinese
birth control he wrote for a popular
Taiwanese magazine after he left
China.
Mosher was dismissed Feb. 24 for
acts that "occurred before (he) re
leased information regarding the
birth control program in China and
were not related in any way to his
publication of that material," the
statement says.
The faculty decided to release the
statement in response to comments
by Mosher and false conclusions
drawn by others, the statement says.
Despite the clarification, the exact
reasons for Mosher's expulsion from
the Ph.D. program in anthropology
remain shrouded in mystery. The
crucial evidence is hidden in a confi
dential report prepared by a faculty

committee investigating his conduct
while doing research in rural
Chinese villages in 1979-80. Only the
faculty and Mosher have been given
copies.
"That report is very clear," An
thropology Prof. Clifford Barnett,
department chairman, said yester
day. "(Nosher) would have no diffi
culty from reading that report (in
finding out) why the faculty took that
action."
Barnett said evidence about the
Chinese article made up only one
small paragraph in the 47-page re
port.
The University has refused to re
lease the report, claiming that
Mosher has agreed "it contains in
formation that may be injurious to
innocent parties." Mosher now de
nies this, but has declined to release
his copy of the report, saying that to
do so would jeopardize a planned
appeal.
Mosher, in New York to consult
with his publisher and to appear on
the Today show, did not return tele
phone calls yesterday.
With the Taiwanese article ruled
out, the central source of informa
tion against him now seems to be a
letter from the Chinese Academy of
Social Sciences written in response
to a request from the Stanford com
mittee.
That letter says Mosher violated
Chinese customs and travel restric
tions, and brought an assistant into
the country without prior permis
sion.
A letter Mosher wrote to the
Chinese government, pointing out
that illegally late-term abortions
were being conducted in the rural
province he was studying, has also
been considered a violation of an

thro p ological ethics. An
thropologists are expected to keep a
low profile while conducting re
search and to keep the identity of
their research subjects secret.
In a news conference after his Feb.
24 dismissal, Mosher said the faculty
"never questioned the truth of (my)
charges" about birth control. "What
they have questioned is my right to
say the truth at a time and place of my
choosing."
Monday's faculty statement rebut
ted that charge. "Although we be
lieve that Mosher was unwise to pub
lish his article in a popular Taiwan
weekly where it would be read as a
political attack on the PRC, we can
not judge this act to be misconduct,
both because we are not convinced

that Mosher fully understood the
implications of his choice of publish
ing medium and because we believe
that Mosher's right to publish what
he chooses is protected by the right
to freedom of speech/' the state
ment said.
Along with the magazine article,
which appeared in the Sunday Times
Chinese Weekly in May 1981, Mosher
blamed his dismissal on "slander
ous" allegations by his former wife,
Maggie So, whom he described as
"the scorned woman."
But, the faculty statement said,
"The innocent persons in question
are not Chinese officials or Mr.
Mosher's former wife."
