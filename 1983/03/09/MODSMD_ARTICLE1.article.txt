# Faculty clarifies Mosher dismissal
## 
### DOUGLAS JEHL Senior staff writer 
In a statement that seems to dis
credit comments made by Steven
Mosher, Anthropology Department
faculty said Monday that Mosher was
expelled from the University two
weeks ago for "illegal and seriously
unethical conduct" while conduct
ing research in China.
This runs counter to Mosher's
claim that the key reason for his dis
missal was an article about Chinese
birth control he wrote for a popular
Taiwanese magazine after he left
China.
Mosher was dismissed Feb. 24 for
acts that "occurred before (he) re
leased information regarding the
birth control program in China and
were not related in any way to his
publication of that material," the
statement says.
The faculty decided to release the
statement in response to comments
by Mosher and false conclusions
drawn by others, the statement says.
Despite the clarification, the exact
reasons for Mosher's expulsion from
the Ph.D. program in anthropology
remain shrouded in mystery. The
crucial evidence is hidden in a confi
dential report prepared by a faculty

committee investigating his conduct
while doing research in rural
Chinese villages in 1979-80. Only the
faculty and Mosher have been given
copies.
"That report is very clear," An
thropology Prof. Clifford Barnett,
department chairman, said yester
day. "(Nosher) would have no diffi
culty from reading that report (in
finding out) why the faculty took that
action."
Barnett said evidence about the
Chinese article made up only one
small paragraph in the 47-page re
port.
The University has refused to re
lease the report, claiming that
Mosher has agreed "it contains in
formation that may be injurious to
innocent parties." Mosher now de
nies this, but has declined to release
his copy of the report, saying that to
do so would jeopardize a planned
appeal.
Mosher, in New York to consult
with his publisher and to appear on
the Today show, did not return tele
phone calls yesterday.
With the Taiwanese article ruled
out, the central source of informa
tion against him now seems to be a
