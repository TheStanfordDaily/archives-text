Compiled from new s reports S. wire servii es
As Pope John Paul II continues his politi
cally sensitive tour of strife-torn Central
America, delicate negotiations are reportedly
nearing completion of here over his contro
versial visit to Poland in lune.
While the pope's second visit here in less
than four years is billed as a religious pilgrim
age, it has powerful political overtones, both
for the pontiff, who strongly c hampioned the
Solidarity independent trade union move
ment, and for the government, which
crushed that movement under martial law.
Nonetheless, both sides see the planned
trip as a chance to ease the enormous ten
sions that exist beneath the police-imposed
order on the surface of Polish life. In the
process, each side hopes to gain greater
legitimacy from the other.
Both sides agree that the visit is bound to
have an enormous psychological and emo
tional impact on the % million Poles, who

view the Polish pontiff as a national hero Ihe
big question is what prac tic al effects it might
produce.
The pope's first visit to (lis homeland, dur
ing the summer of 1979, is widely credited
with inspiring the burst of national pride that
culminated a year later in the birth of Solidar
ity, the Soviet Bloc's first tree trade union.
With strong resentment against the regime
still bubbling just below the surface here, the
government is clearly concerned that a sec
ond papal visit might occasion some new
challenge to its rule.
While the pontiff certainly will not want to
be seen as endorsing the regime that im
posed martial law, it is also true that the posi
tion ot the Roman Catholic leadership in Co
land — and presumably that of the pope as
well — is that the best course is to accept the
current political reality and try to make the
best of it.
