# Invokes domino theory
## Reagan discusses El Salvador 
### DOUGLAS JEHL Senior staff writer 
San Francisco — President Reagan, declaring that the
government of El Salvador stands on "the front-line" of a
battle "aimed at the very heart of the Western Hemis
phere," confirmed Friday that the administration is con
sidering increasing the number of American military ad
visers in El Salvador.
He said the United States may want to go beyond the
present limit of 55 advisers, but emphasized that "in no
sense are we speaking of participation in combat by
American forces."
Reagan assured his Commonwealth Club audience
that El Salvador represents "no parallel whatsoever with
Vietnam."
But he went on to invoke the domino theory in
perhaps his. strongest assertion yet that the region is
endangered by "Iron Curtain" forces.
"If they get a foothold . . . and El Salvador should fall
as a result of this armed violence on the part of the
guerillas, I think Costa Rica, Honduras, Panama — all of
these would fall," he said.
Emphasizing the strategic importance of the Carib
bean nations, Reagan said, "It is vital to us that democ
racy be allowed to succeed in those countries."
The president's statement came as protesters outside
demonstrated against United States involvement in El
Salvador. It was in answer to one of the written ques
tions submitted by the largely supportive audience of
1750 persons.
In other responses, the president said "we're doing
everything we can to speed up" the departure of foreign
troops from Lebanon, and sidestepped a question ask
ing whether he would seek re-election in 1984. He said
he is delaying an announcement because "if you make it
that it's negative, you don't have power anymore in
Washington. If you make it positive, they say everything
you're trying to do is political."
In the prepared address he delivered first, Reagan
decried protectionism, painting a rosy picture of a future

"in which commerce will be king, the eagle will soar and
America will be the mightiest trading nation on earth."
His ardent espousal of free trade reiterated his own
long-held beliefs. But his harsh criticism of those who
seek refuge in the rusty armor of a failed protectionist
past appeared aimed at the Democratic presidential
candidates campaigning on protectionist platforms
supporting higher tariffs and import quotas.
Tf) applause and laughter from the audience, Reagan
said, "We and our other trading partners are in the same
boat. If one partner shoots a hole in the bottom of the
boat, does it make sense for the other partner to shoot
another hole in the boat? There are those who say yes,
and call it getting tough. I call it getting wet — all over."
Proponents of such a "bunker mentality" never point
out that the cost of protectionism for one group of
workers are always passed on to another group down
the line, he said.
Reagan, however, added, "Free trade can only survive
if all parties play by the same rules." The administration
will defend workers and industries from unfair and pre
datory foreign trade policies, he said.
Describing the economy, Reagan said, "Recession is
giving way to a rainbow of recovery-. . . . America is on
the mend." For that reason, he said, the administration
will not turn its back on the principles of its recovery
program.
To the pessimists who would cancel our remaining
tax incentives, I have one thing to say: Don't lay a hand
on the third year of the people's tax cut or indexing
provision."
To further recovery and to increase export volume, he
said, the government must better promote U.S. prod
ucts, support entrepreneurship, increase funding for
basic research and improve the teaching of science and
mathematics in the secondary schools.
'We will also seek to encourage greater and more
creative interaction between university and industry sci
entists and engineers, through programs similar to the
one between Hewlett-Packard and Stanford University,"
he said.
