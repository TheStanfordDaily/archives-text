## The 						Stanford Daily Revive Dead Week 
### 
"Individual circumstances may warrant alter
native in-class examinations either preceding or
following the formally scheduled examination
period. Nonetheless, instructors are strongly
discouraged from making use of the Dead Week
period for final examinations, which not only
reduces the instruction time available for that
particular course but also substantially di
minishes students' opportunities for extensive
review and synthesis of their other courses. 1 '
— from the Dead Week Policy Statement
Despite these admonishing words, abuse of
the current Dead Week policy continues here.
Some professors persist in scheduling finals
during Dead Week, with no alternative exam
scheduled, while others, behind in their course
material, try to squeeze in as much material as
possible in this last week. Still worse, we know
of one class in which a midterm and final are
both offered during Dead Week.
Abuses of this policy concern us because they
suggest that both students and teachers are un
aware of a policy which is designed to benefit
both. Theoretically, Dead Week is a period in
which students consolidate material from the
quarter and prepare for final examinations the
next week. Instead, it has become Deadly
Week. Students are loaded down with new ma
terial at the same time as they face early finals,
late midterms and even later nights.
Part of the problem lies in the manner in
which finals are scheduled. No one enjoys tak
ing exams on the last day of the examination
period. Student vacations are short enough as it
is, so any extra days are welcome indeed. Thus,
it is hard for us to criticize professors who offer
their classes a choice between an early final in
Dead Week or a late final in the examination

period.
Criticize we must, however, because we feel
that Dead Week exists for a reason, and that
reason is not tests. Instead, we prefer to regard
the week before finals as a reading period, like
that of many Ivy League schools. Although there
are differences between these reading periods
and our Dead Week, the philosophy behind
each should be the same: a period to allow
students to catch their breath from the fast pace
of the quarter and think about their classes
rather than just memorize the material.
Because of these problems, we urge the Uni
versity to enforce the policy it authored and to
ensure that Dead Week remains dead, not
deadly.
Such action should include immediate steps
to counter faculty ignorance and deliberate vio
lation of a policy adopted by the Faculty Senate.
This could be done through that body; in
fact concern about the policy was expressed by
some senators at the last Faculty Senate meeting.
Furthermore, the University should ask those
most affected by Dead Week, the students,
what problems they have with the policy. The
Ombudsman's Office is already conducting a
survey of student opinion on the grievance pro
cedure; such a survey should also beconducted
on Dead Week policy.
In the meantime, students are stuck with the
current system. To them we can only suggest
looking at the schedule of finals, or just grinning
and bearing a rough finals week. To professors
we recommend that they read the policy more
closely and avoid any actions on their part that
may conflict with the Dead Week policy. And to
the University, we suggest a re-evaluation of the
Dead Week philosophy.
