# Elections: cut the red tape
## 
### 
For most students here, the annual push to
place groups on the ASSU fee assessment ballot
means nothing more than signing their names
to many petitions. But to groups seeking
assessment funds, the success or failure of the
push en make a difference of $50,000 or more
in anr al budgets.
This year groups receiving ASSU approval
needed 10 percent of the student body to sign
their petition, while groups denied ASSU ap
ptova\ needed 20 petcenl.
Under the old system, a group did not need to
petition if it received ASSU approval. Even then,
signers grumbled about the number of petitions
they had to sign and petitioners grumbled about
the process itself — but the grumbles eventually
died down.
This year, however, the ASSU added several
complicated procedures to the already confus
ing process — and the grumbles did not go
away. Many groups complained of red tape.
Thus when the ASSU Senate initially blocked
passage of the Band's request for approval and
denied approval to the BSU, students — espe
cially members of the Band and the BSU —were
indignant.
As a result, these groups were required to get
20 percent of the student body to sign their
petitions, instead of the 10 percent they would
have needed had they been approved.
The ASSU performs a valuable service in de
termining wnether or not a group stands a
chance of having its fee assessment request ap

proved on the ballot. However, the ASSU's re
sponsibility should stop there. It is for the stu
dents to determine the quality of the proposal
made by these groups requesting a fee assess
ment.
Unfortunately, the ASSU seems to feel that its
mandate is to pass judgment on the merit of fee
assessment requests. Even though the Band's
attempt at ASSU approval nearly met with de
teat, the ease with which Band members ob
tained the signatures ol 20 percent of the stu
dent body leads us to question the reasoning
behind ASSU intervention.
Last Wednesday, the Band received ASSU ap
proval — after Band members had already got
ten 20 percent of the student body to sign their
petitions.
For the BSU, it will be no easy feat to get 20
percent of the student body to sign a petition.
The failure of the senate to approve the BSU's
request was difficult to understand and unfor
tunate, particularly because it has aroused ac
cusations of racism.
We believe the purpose of fee assessment
elections is to allow students to determine
which campus groups they would like to sup
port. The ASSU approval process is perhaps
necessary to eliminate those groups from the
ballot wnich clearly will not be supported.
However, it disturbs us when the senate uses
this process to restructure the budgets of cam
pus organizations or exert its influence in other
ways.
