BSU: did it deserve senate approval?

Yes: the BSU
The Black Student Union (BSU) of
Stanford University wishes to voice
its extreme discontent with the ASSU
Senate's vote of dissapproval of the
BSU's budget for 1983-84. With this
vote, the BSU will be required to ob
tain 20 percent of the student body's
signatures in order to be placed on
the fee assessment ballot in April.
The BSU is the only organization that
came up before the full senate and
did not have its budget approved.
Historically, when organizations
come up before the senate for
budget review, the criteria for ap
proval are demonstrated financial re
sponsibility and a submitted budget
in good order. However, in making
its decision, the senate did not ques
tion the financial responsibility of the
BSU, nor the soundness of its
budget. It should also be noted that
the senate appropriations committee
rigorously reviewed the BSU budget
and, after making minor changes,
the committee unanimously ap
proved the budget and submitted it
to the full senate.
Although the senate as a whole did
not express its reason for disap
proval, Sen. James McGrath, one ot
three senators voting to disapprove
the budget, gave two reasons for his
vote. McGrath contended that, "this
fee request would completely halt
University support of the organiza
tion, forcing the student body to
greatly increase its share of the ex
penses of the BSU."
First of all, the BSU is not guaran
teed funding from University de

partments. In these times when the
University is making drastic cuts in its
budget, all student organizations
have been placed in a rather precari
ous position with respect to Univer
sity funding of programs.
Secondly, reliance upon Univer
sity departments for funding places
the BSU in a position of having to
write and distribute funding propo
sals for events which it wishes to
sponsor. This places an enormous
time burden on the officers of our
organization and unfortunately more
time is spent soliciting funds than in
organizing and publicizing our pro
grams.
McCrath's second reason for dis
approval was that a fee assessment
would subject the BSU to the varying
political and racial climates of the
Stanford community. Although we
appreciate McCrath's concern for
the well-being of our organization,
we believe that we have the ability
and right to decide for ourselves
whether we wish to assume such
risks. We therefore view McCrath's
statement as paternalistic and an
egotistical insult to our intelligence.
McCrath's statements seem to con
tradict Stanford University's com
mitment to promoting "cultural di
versity" within the University com
munity.
Given that McGrath was the only
senator to voice his reasons for op
posing the BSU's request, we can onlv
surmise that the senate was in total
agreement with his sentiments. We
feel that no valid reasons have been
presented by the senate and that the
decision rendered was discriminat
ory in nature and an insult to our

reasoning processes. Students in
supposedly responsible positions
are making decisions, not on the in
formation presented, but unfortu
nately on their own racial biases.
We urge the student body to keep
this action in mind when it selects the
representatives of the 1983-84 sen
ate. An arbitrary decision of this na
ture affects not only the BSU, but the
entire student body.

No: a senator
I have found there to be some mis
understanding over the reasons why
I voted against approving the Black
Student Union (BSU) fee assessment
at last week's ASSU Senate meeting.
Let me try to clarify my rationale so
thattheconfusioncanbecleared up.
There are two reasons why I could
not support having the senate ap
prove the assessment and give the
group the option of collecting signa
tures of 10 percent of the student
body rather than 20 percent.
• I do not believe the senate should
approve the budgets of groups seek
ing their first fee assessment. In my
opinion, these groups will need to
show the interest and possible sup
port of a substantial number of stu
dents. Their placement on the ballot
should reflect the opinions of stu
dents on giving them substantial fi
nancial support. I have been consis

tent with this point of view on other
votes this year, and I have not heard
compelling reasons to change that
view.
• I could not endorse the income
side of the BSU budget. This year the
BSU solicited approximately $6000 of
their $12,000 budget from the Uni
versity (Dean of Student Affairs of
fice, Black Community Services Cen
ter and University departments In
the proposed 1983-84 budget, they
were not planning on soliciting any
money from the University to sup
port their $16,000 budget.
In other words, they wanted to
shift their University funding over to
the students. The onl\ reason I heard
for doing this is that it i;-> hard to get
money from the University, and this
would thus provide easier funding.
Although this may be true, I do not
believe it to be wise to shift respon
sibility away from the University for
supplying funding they have
supplied in the past and to raise the
financial burden on students, simply
because it is easier.
In this way, we would have to be
willing to support all groups simply
because student funding is easier to
get than University funding. I felt that
I could not endorse this shift in pol
icy.
I outlined these reasons at the
meeting after the vote, and I feel that
my actions have been consistent with
them. I encourage people to talk
with me if they have any questions in
the future, so that misunderstand
ings like this can be cleared up be
fore they start.
