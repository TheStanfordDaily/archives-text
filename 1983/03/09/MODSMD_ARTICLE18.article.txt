# In defense of political rights
## 
### 
The particular structure of a gov
ernment doesn't matter too much, as
long as it doesn't persecute its
people, and citizens who want to
participate can do so. But even by
that lax standard, many governments
of the world fall terribly short. From
the comparative safety of our North
American perch, most Americans
feel some responsibility to help
those whose fundamental political
rights are being violated. After all, a
clean conscience does not come
from washing one's hands of a prob
lem.
Groups like Amnesty International
exert public pressure directly by writ
ing letters and trying to publicize the
fate of those who are imprisoned
solely for what they believe. In some
individual cases, this pressure
works. The projects are worthwhile.
But groups like Al cannot write let
ters on behalf of tens of thousands of
people. And if they could, their
pressure would become the norm
and repressive governments would
become inured to'it.
Given the weakness of the
pressure of public opinion, many
people look to bodies like the United
Nations for some leadership on de
fining and protecting political rights.
Without naming names, though,
roughly half the member states of the
U.N. hold political prisoners. If U.N
enforcement is to work, either the
relatively innocent must enforce
rights in the offending countries, or
the offending countries must police
each other. To use a huge under
statement, neither alternative is
likely to be effective or peaceful.
For American citizens, the next
obvious temptation is to rely on the
White House or the Department of
State. The prescription is that the
government should lean on its allies
to allow more political freedom, or
help in the overthrow of those gov
ernments by others who promise to
do better.
While the American government
does support and influence regimes

that nave a bad record on political
rights (South Africa, the Phillipines,
El Salvador, and South Korea come to
mind), it does not attempt to take
over or totally control those govern
ments. If we want to keep those gov
ernments as allies, we cannot lean on
them too hard. The relationship is
not that of, say, the Soviet Union to
Poland or Afghanistan, where the
niceties of intergovernmental
etiquette no longer need to be ob
served. Quiet pressure amo'ng
friends can only produce quiet re
sults.
This limitation seems to have an
obvious answer. If we cannot per
suade our friends to allow more
political rights, we should no longer
have them as friends. Most oppres
sive governments do not have a
Gandhi waiting behind the presiden
tial palace prepared to promote polit
ical freedom and non-violence. Gov
ernment violence gets most of the
publicity, but opposition violence is
just as deadly.
Amnesty International re
ported that after the overthrow of
admittedly repressive dictators like
the Shah of Iran and Somoza of
Nicaragua, the human rights situa
tion deteriorated under the new
leadership. Remember the carnage
of the boat people and the genocide
in Cambodia following the over
throw of the repressive South Viet
namese government. Look now at
the violence in Zimbabwee and An
gola, now that they are free of Euro
pean colonialism.
Changes do not always happen for
the better. And since Edmund Burke
wrote on the French Revolution,
everyone should know enough to
judge political revolutionaries by
their deeds, not their promises.
With peculair farsightedness, the
type that sees the forest but not the
trees, some people advocate revolu
tion as a solution to the lack of politi
cal rights. In some countries that step
may be unavoidable, but it should
not be welcomed because it is inevit-

able. Proposing war to provide polit
ical freedom is a paradoxical choice
that must be made by the people of a
country, not forced upon them by
outside military or economic
pressure. A few years ago the Tanza
nian army deposed Idi Amin of
Uganda in a war to stop genocide.
That campaign was worthwhile. But
for any situation short of genocide,
revolution and civil war is a remedy
worse than the disease.
If you aren't depressed by now,
you should be. And the situation gets
worse. Although each of these types
of pressure may occasionally work,
they may also backfire and cause in
creased repression. Further, perse
cuted refugees may become pawns
in political games, like the lews who
are trying to emigrate from the Soviet
Union today. If political rights are I
important, and they are, then they I
have a tendency to become mixed j
with other issues of power politics. I
Generally, the nations that repress f|
have one more bargaining countar,
one more pawn. And at bargaining
tables pawns are often sacrificed. 4
Like most types of virtue, a respect
for political rights must come from
within a country; it cannot be im-1
posed from outside. Supporters of I
human rights should help all those 1
whose actions support the ideal. I
Governments can offer political I
asylum, if it is wanted. Governments I
must also speak out against all
abuses of political rights, for only if
all cases are critized can the cause
become important in itself, apart
from other political concerns.
To fight for political rights, one
must have the idealism to believe
that Utopia is possible, the realism to
understand that it can only be
reached very slowly, and the prag
matism to avoid the deceitful illu
sions that too often pass foranswers.

Timothy Taylor
The view from normalcy
The particular structure of a gov
ernment doesn't matter too much, as
long as it doesn't persecute its
people, and citizens who want to
participate can do so. But even by
that lax standard, many governments
of the world fall terribly short. From
the comparative safety of our North
American perch, most Americans
feel some responsibility to help
those whose fundamental political
rights are being violated. After all, a
clean conscience does not come
from washing one's hands of a prob
lem.
Groups like Amnesty International
exert public pressure directly by writ
ing letters and trying to publicize the
fate of those who are imprisoned
solely for what they believe. In some
individual cases, this pressure
works. The projects are worthwhile.
But groups like Al cannot write let
ters on behalf of tens of thousands of
people. And if they could, their
pressure would become the norm
and repressive governments would
become inured to'it.
Given the weakness of the
pressure of public opinion, many
people look to bodies like the United
Nations for some leadership on de
fining and protecting political rights.
Without naming names, though,
roughly half the member states of the
U.N. hold political prisoners. If U.N
enforcement is to work, either the
relatively innocent must enforce
rights in the offending countries, or
the offending countries must police
each other. To use a huge under
statement, neither alternative is
likely to be effective or peaceful.
For American citizens, the next
obvious temptation is to rely on the
White House or the Department of
State. The prescription is that the
government should lean on its allies
to allow more political freedom, or
help in the overthrow of those gov
ernments by others who promise to
do better.
While the American government
does support and influence regimes

that nave a bad record on political
rights (South Africa, the Phillipines,
El Salvador, and South Korea come to
mind), it does not attempt to take
over or totally control those govern
ments. If we want to keep those gov
ernments as allies, we cannot lean on
them too hard. The relationship is
not that of, say, the Soviet Union to
Poland or Afghanistan, where the
niceties of intergovernmental
etiquette no longer need to be ob
served. Quiet pressure amo'ng
friends can only produce quiet re
sults.
This limitation seems to have an
obvious answer. If we cannot per
suade our friends to allow more
political rights, we should no longer
have them as friends. Most oppres
sive governments do not have a
Gandhi waiting behind the presiden
tial palace prepared to promote polit
ical freedom and non-violence. Gov
ernment violence gets most of the
publicity, but opposition violence is
just as deadly.
Amnesty International re
ported that after the overthrow of
admittedly repressive dictators like
the Shah of Iran and Somoza of
Nicaragua, the human rights situa
tion deteriorated under the new
leadership. Remember the carnage
of the boat people and the genocide
in Cambodia following the over
throw of the repressive South Viet
namese government. Look now at
the violence in Zimbabwee and An
gola, now that they are free of Euro
pean colonialism.
Changes do not always happen for
the better. And since Edmund Burke
wrote on the French Revolution,
everyone should know enough to
judge political revolutionaries by
their deeds, not their promises.
With peculair farsightedness, the
type that sees the forest but not the
trees, some people advocate revolu
tion as a solution to the lack of politi
cal rights. In some countries that step
may be unavoidable, but it should
not be welcomed because it is inevit-

able. Proposing war to provide polit
ical freedom is a paradoxical choice
that must be made by the people of a
country, not forced upon them by
outside military or economic
pressure. A few years ago the Tanza
nian army deposed Idi Amin of
Uganda in a war to stop genocide.
That campaign was worthwhile. But
for any situation short of genocide,
revolution and civil war is a remedy
worse than the disease.
If you aren't depressed by now,
you should be. And the situation gets
worse. Although each of these types
of pressure may occasionally work,
they may also backfire and cause in
creased repression. Further, perse
cuted refugees may become pawns
in political games, like the lews who
