Mechanical Engineering 112 students presented their final projects at
Lake Terman Tuesday. Students were required to roll their creations
down the ramp to Lake Terman. In order for the student to get an A-plus,
the machine had to stop at the bottom and grab the waiting $50 bill. This
student came up short and went home without the money or the A-plus.
