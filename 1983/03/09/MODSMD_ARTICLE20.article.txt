## Politics decided BSU/BALSA response to civil rights course 
### 
Leave it to the Guest Professorship Bureau
(GPB) to bring us controversy and conflict.
As if the rain, the queen, the drizzles, the
finals, the thundershowers, the job inter
views and non-weather resistant umbrellas
weren't enough to occupy Stanford's cen
terstage, the GPB's done it again. That's right
folks, it's time for the spring mudslingathon.
Competing for the Grand Prize of $9800 and
the opportunity to exchange Harvard slush
for Stanford sunshine are this year's contes
tants: the executive director of the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored
People's legal defense fund, Jack
Greenberg, and the NAACP's president
counsel Julius Chambers.
Like speakers before them, these two
promise to shake the student body's politi
cal consciousness right off its collective
windsurfboard. But first they must weather
the criticism of our own political factions.
Here they have a problem. Their course,
"Racial Discrimination and Civil Rights," has
met opposition from the Black Student

Union (BSU) and the Black American Law
Student Association (BALSA). Pointing to the
"gross lack of minority faculty" at Stanford,
the two organizations have linked opposi
tion to the course to affirmative action. More
specifically, the BALSA statement stressed
the "need for minority input into the deci
sions regarding allocation of the limited re
sources in educational institutions."
But is affirmative action really the issue
here? Granted, the problems that gave rise
to this program are long from reconciled and
have literally been put on hold by the Reagan
administration's "affirmative reaction" de
fense budgets. Vet, is this really the source
of the BSU/BALSA opposition to the course?
An alternative motive is suggested by the
politics of the situation. Failure of the GPB to
consider funding the BSU-proposed course
"Africans in Transition" created an adversa
rial relationship between the two groups: In
this light BSU/BALSA opposition may be
viewed as retaliation; a case of "you frus
trate my goals and I yours." If this is an accu

rate assessment, frustration of the black
community may be the ultimate result.
Caught in the middle of this factional bicker
ing, blacks desiring to take the course will be
forced to choose between an educational
experience and their ethnic solidarity.
Beyond political maneuvering, a more
significant motive lies behind a possible
boycott. According to the BALSA statement,
"It is only proper that we participate in de
termining how (and by whom) we should be
portrayed." Clearly in reference to
Greenberg, this statement exhibits a gross
distortion of the situation.
First, although the course will surely dis
cuss the effects of racism on blacks, it
doesn't promise to be a "portrayal" of black
culture. Second, the implied fear of adverse
subjective interpretation embodied in a
boycott proposal is an unwarranted criticism
of Greenberg's credentials. As a high
ranking member of the organization that
pioneered the field of civil rights legislation,

Greenberg has been an important actor in
the amelioration of American blacks. If any
thing, his subjective biases would be in favor
of the black situation.
One is left to wonder whether
Greenberg's liability is his being white. In
essence, if one can accept his credentials
and reputation, that is all that is left. Perhaps
sensing the futility of recourse to such an
attitude, Greenberg has vowed not to teach
in the case of a boycott. For those interested
and concerned about racial discrimination
this will be an unfortunate occurrence.
Nonetheless, the ball is in the BSU/BALSA
court.
Perhaps in re-examining the fact that there
are two sides to learning about and combat
ting racial discrimination, the BSU and
BALSA will reconsider their opposition to
the course. Racism cannot end through the
efforts of blacks alone. Collective interacial
action is the only avenue to success. This
requires an education of all races. Chambers
and Greenberg's course possesses the sub

stantive content to contribute to this end.
More important, the difference in races of
the instructors is an asset if given a chance.
Neither race is alienated from participating
in the course from the apprehension of
exploring such misunderstood topics in an
exclusive black or white environment. Thus,
the experiences and perspectives of both
races are vividly symbolized.
Priding ourselves on our academic status,
Stanford should be proud to be the forum
for such a progressive educational experi
ence. We have tolerated less justifiable
speakers in the past. This offers the Univer
sity a unique opportunity to show our east
ern rival the extent and value of a Stanford
education.
The rain may stop but there's plenty of
editorial mud still to be slung.
