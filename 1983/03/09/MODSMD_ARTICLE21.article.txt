# Civil disobedience is proper avenue to protest registration
## 
### 
In his letter "To register or not" {Daily, March 4),
which was itself a response to my column ("Reasons
for non-registration," Daily, Feb. 23) Paul Timmins
raised a number of arguments in favor of registering for
the draft. They were thoughtful and intelligent argu
ments, and deserving of response. In contemplating
that response, however, I began to realize that the issue
Timmins was addressing was not merely draft registra
tion, but the larger issue of civil disobedience. I found
myself challenged to make explicit the justifications for
civil disobedience which underlie acts such as non
registration.
Timmins' arguments, as I understand them, are as
follows: (1) if everyone broke laws they found person
ally unacceptable, the result would be chaos; (2) there
are more productive ways of changing the status quo
than by taking what he calls "a position of rejection and
withdrawal"; and (3) there is no meaningful connection
between non-registration as a form of civil disobedience
and the racial and other injustices to which I linked it.
Timmins' first argument, about the disintegrative ef
fects of selective obedience to the law, is perhaps the

most common argument raised against civil disobedi
ence. And, if it could be shown that civil disobedience
does lead to general disregard for the law and to social
chaos, those who commit civil disobedience (c-d-ers)
would certainly have to stop and think very seriously
about whether they were prepared for the conse
quences of their actions. But both intuitively and histori
cally there is little to suggest that there is such an effect.
It seems rather that people not constrained by con
science will break the law anyway, while there would be
much to be gained if people followed their consciences
in more situations.
Timmins' second argument is a complex one. It con
tains both the assumption that c-d-ers are withdrawing
from and rejecting "society" (the most specific word he
uses for what they are supposedly rejecting), and the
assumption that to do so is less effective in bringing
change than some other set of means that is available to
them.
It seems that in beinga student, interacting with peers
and expressing a non-registration stance in speech and
in writing, one can hardly withdraw from and reject
society. I would venture to say the same about those
who engage in blockades of nuclear plants and other
such facilities. Now, I would be the first to admit that I
personally reject a number of the features of this society
— its nuclear-armed military as a primary example — but
I am certainly not withdrawing from it.
The second question, concerning the effectiveness of
non-registration (and implicitly other forms of civil dis
obedience), is of course a critical one. It might be argued

that even if it were not effective, there are compelling
reasons to engage in certain acts of civil disobedience
for moral reasons. But whether or not one believes the
preceding point (which I do), it is still important to look
at the political efficacy of civil disobedience as a tactic.
It is clear that the repeal of draft registration (and other
"desired" outcomes) are likely to be achieved through
acts of government, specifically of Congress (although
acts of the courts and executive can put pressure on the
Congress). I would argue that civil disobedience is an
effective tactic in the effort to affect Congress.
There are two parts to this argument. One is that
public civil disobedience is a powerful consciousness
raising tool. It gives single individuals visibility and cre
dibility that are otherwise unavailable to the average
"person in the street." Certainly I could get other
people to write to their legislators without having to be a
non-registrant, but it is also clear that the commitment
implied by civil disobedience is a powerful stimulus.
The second part is that mass civil disobedience can in
itself affect policy. A bill was recently introduced in
Congress (HR 1050, co-sponsored by Reps. Martin Sabo
(D-Minn.) and Bill Green (R-N.Y.), that would repeal the
funding for the continuation of draft registration in fiscal
year 1983. The justification given is that, because of the
high rates of non-compliance (in the form of both non
registration and refusal to report changes of address),
the current registration system is less effective than
would be a stand-by post-mobilization registration. By
bringing this legislation before Congress, civil disobedi
ence in the form of resistance to draft registration is in

fact having its desired effect.
Timmins' third argument is also a common one — in
its broadest form, it takes the shape that "civil disobedi
ence is not justified when the injustice being protested
is not a result of the law being broken." And I must
concur that racism, sexism, and militarism are not the
result of draft registration, nor of any particular law. But
how then does one protest fundamental injustices, es
pecially when one is not a member of the class that
suffers from them?
Civil disobedience of all forms, as I said before, gives
both visibility and credibility to those whotakethe risks.
The "platform" provided can be used for a broader
criticism than simply protesting one law. A situation
such as draft registration encourages this, because of
the links (even if they are non-causal links) that do exist
between the draft and such issues as social injustices
and nuclear weapons.
It could of course be argued that one need not break
the law to make these broader criticisms either, and I
would have to agree. But it must be remembered that
this is not a society of equals, and that the power to
influence public consciousness is not evenly distri
buted. Power and privilege go together. It seems obvi
ous to me that in the uphill struggle for justice there is a
great need for tools that enhance the communicative
power of the underdogs, and civil disobedience is sue ha
tool.

(D-Minn.) and Bill Green (R-N.Y.), that would repeal the
funding for the continuation of draft registration in fiscal
year 1983. The justification given is that, because of the
high rates of non-compliance (in the form of both non
registration and refusal to report changes of address),
the current registration system is less effective than
would be a stand-by post-mobilization registration. By
bringing this legislation before Congress, civil disobedi
ence in the form of resistance to draft registration is in

fact having its desired effect.
Timmins' third argument is also a common one — in
its broadest form, it takes the shape that "civil disobedi
ence is not justified when the injustice being protested
is not a result of the law being broken." And I must
concur that racism, sexism, and militarism are not the
result of draft registration, nor of any particular law. But
how then does one protest fundamental injustices, es
pecially when one is not a member of the class that
suffers from them?
Civil disobedience of all forms, as I said before, gives
both visibility and credibility to those whotakethe risks.
The "platform" provided can be used for a broader
criticism than simply protesting one law. A situation
such as draft registration encourages this, because of
the links (even if they are non-causal links) that do exist
between the draft and such issues as social injustices
and nuclear weapons.
It could of course be argued that one need not break
the law to make these broader criticisms either, and I
would have to agree. But it must be remembered that
this is not a society of equals, and that the power to
influence public consciousness is not evenly distri
buted. Power and privilege go together. It seems obvi
ous to me that in the uphill struggle for justice there is a
great need for tools that enhance the communicative
power of the underdogs, and civil disobedience is sue ha
tool.

Ik this all there is?
In his letter "To register or not" {Daily, March 4),
which was itself a response to my column ("Reasons
for non-registration," Daily, Feb. 23) Paul Timmins
raised a number of arguments in favor of registering for
the draft. They were thoughtful and intelligent argu
ments, and deserving of response. In contemplating
that response, however, I began to realize that the issue
Timmins was addressing was not merely draft registra
tion, but the larger issue of civil disobedience. I found
myself challenged to make explicit the justifications for
civil disobedience which underlie acts such as non
registration.
Timmins' arguments, as I understand them, are as
follows: (1) if everyone broke laws they found person
ally unacceptable, the result would be chaos; (2) there
are more productive ways of changing the status quo
than by taking what he calls "a position of rejection and
withdrawal"; and (3) there is no meaningful connection
between non-registration as a form of civil disobedience
and the racial and other injustices to which I linked it.
Timmins' first argument, about the disintegrative ef
fects of selective obedience to the law, is perhaps the

most common argument raised against civil disobedi
ence. And, if it could be shown that civil disobedience
does lead to general disregard for the law and to social
chaos, those who commit civil disobedience (c-d-ers)
would certainly have to stop and think very seriously
about whether they were prepared for the conse
quences of their actions. But both intuitively and histori
cally there is little to suggest that there is such an effect.
It seems rather that people not constrained by con
science will break the law anyway, while there would be
much to be gained if people followed their consciences
in more situations.
Timmins' second argument is a complex one. It con
tains both the assumption that c-d-ers are withdrawing
from and rejecting "society" (the most specific word he
uses for what they are supposedly rejecting), and the
assumption that to do so is less effective in bringing
change than some other set of means that is available to
them.
It seems that in beinga student, interacting with peers
and expressing a non-registration stance in speech and
in writing, one can hardly withdraw from and reject
society. I would venture to say the same about those
who engage in blockades of nuclear plants and other
such facilities. Now, I would be the first to admit that I
personally reject a number of the features of this society
— its nuclear-armed military as a primary example — but
I am certainly not withdrawing from it.
The second question, concerning the effectiveness of
non-registration (and implicitly other forms of civil dis
obedience), is of course a critical one. It might be argued

that even if it were not effective, there are compelling
reasons to engage in certain acts of civil disobedience
for moral reasons. But whether or not one believes the
preceding point (which I do), it is still important to look
at the political efficacy of civil disobedience as a tactic.
It is clear that the repeal of draft registration (and other
"desired" outcomes) are likely to be achieved through
acts of government, specifically of Congress (although
acts of the courts and executive can put pressure on the
Congress). I would argue that civil disobedience is an
effective tactic in the effort to affect Congress.
There are two parts to this argument. One is that
public civil disobedience is a powerful consciousness
raising tool. It gives single individuals visibility and cre
dibility that are otherwise unavailable to the average
"person in the street." Certainly I could get other
people to write to their legislators without having to be a
non-registrant, but it is also clear that the commitment
implied by civil disobedience is a powerful stimulus.
The second part is that mass civil disobedience can in
itself affect policy. A bill was recently introduced in
Congress (HR 1050, co-sponsored by Reps. Martin Sabo
(D-Minn.) and Bill Green (R-N.Y.), that would repeal the
funding for the continuation of draft registration in fiscal
