## Some never admit it... 
### BOB DUGONI Staff writer 
The use of alcohol has always been a problem among young
people and has become more common in recent years.
Alcohol use and abuse cannot be limited to one age group or to
one living situation. Stanford and its students are a part of a
society that overdrinks.
Doctor Stephanie Brown, director of the Stanford Alcohol
Clinic, said that the acceptability of alcohol is currently very high
and young pepole are identifying with society in this acceptance.
She said that through happy hours, sherry hours, champagne
brunches and other activities, drinking is becoming expected and
therefore normative. The University is no different.
"Alcohol is considered to be a part of university life," she said.
"It is difficult at any university to figure out what part alcohol will
play, but the university is not different from culture as a whole."
Doctor David Dorosin, the director of counseling and psycho
logical services at Cowell Student Health Center, agreed. He said
that alcohol has become ritualized in social customs.
"Most every society has some intoxicant and we're not immune
to that. I think some people at Stanford would like to change that.
For example, a party is not considered a party unless there is
alcohol.
"We use alcohol a number of different ways and to cope with a
number of different problems. I just don't think it's the young
people, it is all of society."
Dorosin said, however, that society tends to be more tolerant
of the young drinker because it is looked on as a "whimsical"
activity.
"Young people are in a period of life that is one of the most
stressful and I don't think it's any surprise that because they're in
a stressful period society sanctions the use of alcohol."
Evidence also suggests that the use of alcohol among young
people is increasing as the use of other drugs decreases.
Brown attributed this to students turning away from the radical
philosophy of the '60s and instead emmulating society; a society
that consumes a great deal of alcohol.
Brown said it is important to distinguish between two types of
problem drinkers. The first is the person who drinks to follow the
standards of society. The person who hits all the sherry hours,
champagne brunches and parties that promise to provide al
cohol. The problem begins when this person arranges his life
around activities because they have alcohol.
There is also a group of maladapted students who drink from
the beginning, using alcohol as a solution to problems. They
drink alone, to get to sleep or to achieve a state that otherwise
could not have been reached.
"Whenever you take a medicinal drink you set yourself up for
serious problems," she said.
One of the biggest problems with alcohol abusers is getting
them to admit their problem. Dorosin said that this is even more
profound in young people.
"Most people who drink too much will deny it,"he said. "It is
very difficult to get them to seek help. It's not impossible, but
very difficult.
"In young people it is difficult because it is difficult to define
when one has a drinking problem. It is a subjective thing with
young people."
recon\ has been a move \o maVce eas\er (or
a\coho\\cs to admit to a proto\em. W "is now defined as a medVcat
problem and is sometimes covered by insurance. In addition, the
moral stigma that was attached is being removed.

Brown and Dorosin said that some of the possible indicators
that a person is developing a drinking problem are when there is
an overdependence on it, when it becomes the focal part of the
day, when it is used for routine stresses, when there is a loss of
good judgement such as driving while intoxicated, when black
out spells occur, when there is an increase in isolation and when
violence becomes frequent.
Though there are students at Stanford with alcohol problems,
most reported alcohol-related incidents are due to accidents
from acute drinking binges.
A big concern at Cowell is the safety of students who "chug-a
lug" or drink large quantities of alcohol in a short period of time.
Christine Fancher, the supervising nurse at Cowell, said that
because such incidents can be fatal, an intoxicated student
should be brought immediately to the emergency room of Stan
ford Hospital.
Fancher has been at Cowell for 11 years, andsaidthenumberof
alcohol related incidents has been on the increase in recent
years. She also attributed this to the decrease in the use of other
drugs.
"I think as the use of other drugs goes down people go back to
alcohol. A lot of people feel they need things to make them feel
different," she said.
Dorosin agreed, "It is readily available and it is the cheapest
buzz in town," he said.
The number of alcohol related incidents reported to Cowell is
proportional to the amount of student activities on campus,
Fancher said, and there is not one area of the campus that tends
to have more problems than others.
"Drinking alcohol has been a big thing," she said. "It would be
nice to increase other activities so a person can have other
choices. One problem is with people who are not regular drin
kers getting in over their heads and not knowing how to handle
it."
Brown also encouraged individual choice because it is only the
individual that can make the decision to stop drinking. She said it
was important for the campus to move in the direction of realiz
ing that excessive drinking is not condoned, that it is wrong. She
said that this would have to come through education.
"V'm not tor prohibition," she said. "It creates more problems.
There has to be more options for the individual ra"s have to
decide whether or not to buy the alcohol, students have to decide
whether to use their money to buy it.

said that this would have to come through education.
"V'm not tor prohibition," she said. "It creates more problems.

whether to use their money to buy it.

The use of alcohol has always been a problem among young
people and has become more common in recent years.
Alcohol use and abuse cannot be limited to one age group or to
one living situation. Stanford and its students are a part of a
society that overdrinks.
Doctor Stephanie Brown, director of the Stanford Alcohol
Clinic, said that the acceptability of alcohol is currently very high
and young pepole are identifying with society in this acceptance.
She said that through happy hours, sherry hours, champagne
brunches and other activities, drinking is becoming expected and
therefore normative. The University is no different.
"Alcohol is considered to be a part of university life," she said.
"It is difficult at any university to figure out what part alcohol will
play, but the university is not different from culture as a whole."
Doctor David Dorosin, the director of counseling and psycho
logical services at Cowell Student Health Center, agreed. He said
that alcohol has become ritualized in social customs.
"Most every society has some intoxicant and we're not immune
to that. I think some people at Stanford would like to change that.
For example, a party is not considered a party unless there is
alcohol.
"We use alcohol a number of different ways and to cope with a
number of different problems. I just don't think it's the young
people, it is all of society."
Dorosin said, however, that society tends to be more tolerant
of the young drinker because it is looked on as a "whimsical"
activity.
"Young people are in a period of life that is one of the most
stressful and I don't think it's any surprise that because they're in
a stressful period society sanctions the use of alcohol."
Evidence also suggests that the use of alcohol among young
people is increasing as the use of other drugs decreases.
Brown attributed this to students turning away from the radical
philosophy of the '60s and instead emmulating society; a society
that consumes a great deal of alcohol.
Brown said it is important to distinguish between two types of
problem drinkers. The first is the person who drinks to follow the
standards of society. The person who hits all the sherry hours,
champagne brunches and parties that promise to provide al
cohol. The problem begins when this person arranges his life
around activities because they have alcohol.
There is also a group of maladapted students who drink from
the beginning, using alcohol as a solution to problems. They
drink alone, to get to sleep or to achieve a state that otherwise
could not have been reached.
"Whenever you take a medicinal drink you set yourself up for
serious problems," she said.
One of the biggest problems with alcohol abusers is getting
them to admit their problem. Dorosin said that this is even more
profound in young people.
"Most people who drink too much will deny it,"he said. "It is
very difficult to get them to seek help. It's not impossible, but
very difficult.
"In young people it is difficult because it is difficult to define
when one has a drinking problem. It is a subjective thing with
young people."

a\coho\\cs to admit to a proto\em. W "is now defined as a medVcat
problem and is sometimes covered by insurance. In addition, the
moral stigma that was attached is being removed.

Brown and Dorosin said that some of the possible indicators
that a person is developing a drinking problem are when there is
an overdependence on it, when it becomes the focal part of the
day, when it is used for routine stresses, when there is a loss of
good judgement such as driving while intoxicated, when black
out spells occur, when there is an increase in isolation and when
violence becomes frequent.
Though there are students at Stanford with alcohol problems,
most reported alcohol-related incidents are due to accidents
from acute drinking binges.
A big concern at Cowell is the safety of students who "chug-a
lug" or drink large quantities of alcohol in a short period of time.
Christine Fancher, the supervising nurse at Cowell, said that
because such incidents can be fatal, an intoxicated student
should be brought immediately to the emergency room of Stan
ford Hospital.
Fancher has been at Cowell for 11 years, andsaidthenumberof
alcohol related incidents has been on the increase in recent
years. She also attributed this to the decrease in the use of other
drugs.
"I think as the use of other drugs goes down people go back to
alcohol. A lot of people feel they need things to make them feel
different," she said.
Dorosin agreed, "It is readily available and it is the cheapest
buzz in town," he said.
The number of alcohol related incidents reported to Cowell is
proportional to the amount of student activities on campus,
Fancher said, and there is not one area of the campus that tends
to have more problems than others.
"Drinking alcohol has been a big thing," she said. "It would be
nice to increase other activities so a person can have other
choices. One problem is with people who are not regular drin
kers getting in over their heads and not knowing how to handle
it."
Brown also encouraged individual choice because it is only the
individual that can make the decision to stop drinking. She said it
was important for the campus to move in the direction of realiz
ing that excessive drinking is not condoned, that it is wrong. She
said that this would have to come through education.
