# Alcoholism
## ...others never forget it 
### BOB DUGONI Staff writer 
To look at her is to see a
bright, eloquent, pretty young
woman. She is a Stanford
graduate in the midst of
graduate school applications,
and for the last 2'i years in the
midst of a battle against al
coholism and drug abuse.
She speaks openly, eagerly
about her problem, and her
life. She is not ashamed of who
she is or the disease she is battl
ing, but as a member of Al
coholics Anonymous, an or
ganization she credits with sav
ing her life, she cannot use her
name in this article. It is one of
A A' s fundamental policies.
Therefore, she will be referred
to as Karen. This is not her real
name.
Karen graduated from Stan
ford in |une, completing a
psychology degree with hon
ors in four years, and two vol
untary commitments at alcohol
rehabilitation centers.
"I know miracles happen,"
she said frankly, "because it is
a miracle I'm alive today."
When she came to Stanford,
Karen was already using al
cohol daily to cope with the
stresses of life. Here she says
she was introduced to nine
drugs in the first two weeks,
and became addicted to all of
them.
"I wanted to be God," she
said. "I wanted to be in con
trol. I never wanted to feel like
I didn't know something."
At the conclusion of her
freshman year, she went
home, and eventually to her
first rehabilitation clinic. Her
parents discovered her prob
lem through a journal she was
keeping.
"Now I think it's the grace of
God they did," she said. "Be
cause I planned to commit
suicide when I came back here.
I planned to kill myself on Jack
Daniels and valium."
Karen said she was able to go
as long as she did without
being discovered because she
could still function externally.
She could still windsurf, main

tain straight-A grades and hide
behind the title "Stanford Stu
dent."
"How could you call a Stan
ford student with a 3.7 grade
point average a lush?" she
asked. "We've been successful
on the outside terms. We made
it here. How could we have this
alcohol problem, this lack of
will power? Personally, that
was part of my denial."
But Karen could not con
tinue the type of life she was
living. She said that sooner or
later it is no longer possible to
control the things in your life.
"It is a progressive, fatal dis
ease. That means it only gets
worse. You try to control it, but
you don't. Slowly it starts to de
teriorate the person."
The fact that Karen was not
discovered is testimony to her
ability, and that of many al
coholics, to hide their prob
lem. She comes from a family
with a history of both genius
and alcoholism. Her aunt,
uncle and grandfather are all
members of AA.
Karen said Stanford is not an
island, and like many colleges,
it is conducive to drinking. The
atmosphere is stressful and
there is pressure to be the best
to not have problems.
"I think for me, and at Stan
ford, it's bad to have a prob
lem. We don't know how to ask
for help. There is probably
more pressure here not to
admit to a problem, and the
only successful cure for al
coholism is to give up, and that
is foreign at Stanford."
After her first rehabilitation
Karen came back to school in
January of her sophomore
year. Two months latershe was
taking psychedelic speed in
mass quantities along with acid
and cocaine.
She stayed on drugs for the
next nine months, maintained
a 3.5 grade point average and
then changed her life after a

frightening experience on a
plane ride home.
She took a sedative, valium,
for the first time in nearly a
year. Immediately she blacked
out. She already describes high
school and her first two years
in college as living in a fog be
cause she has little recollection
of any of those six years. But
this was different. This was
frightening. She awoke from
that fog and found she had
done things such as eat lunch
without any knowledge of ever
having done so.
"I was terrified and I had one
lucid thought. For a moment, I
realized that I was totally out of
control."
She went back to the re
habilitation clinic, and slowly
began to piece her life back to
gether.
"It's been working for 2Vi
years one day at a time," she
said. "But only one day at a
time."
That was the way I lived my
life until I was 20.1 had to go to
the gutter to have the quality of
my life today. I had to be al
most dying to realize what it
means to be alive today."
1 he road to recovery has not
been an easy one. She must at
tend daily AA meetings and
phone in to sponsors twice a
day. These are individuals who
give her support. Many are also
recovering alcoholics and can
not be conned. Karen said that
if a person begins to change, it
is noticeable.
Looking at Stanford parties
now, she said there is too
much of an emphasis on al
cohol, but a policy on alcohol
is not the solution. An educa
tional institution, she said,
should be the leader in educat
ing on alcohol.
"If you want to get it," she
said, "it is readily available.
When I was 14 I got it. When I
was 12 I got it. The issue is edu
cation."
