# Humanities degrees still marketable
## 
### SHELLY WENTKER 
English, art history, classics, French, history —
in recent years, students have come to question
the marketability of a degree in these areas.
Yet according to Christopher Shinkman, di
rector of the Career Planning and Placement
Center (CPPC), students with degrees in the
humanities are generally successful in locating
jobs, although it may take longer to land that
initial job with a humanities degree than with a
technical degree.
"We've been through these cycles before,
and we'll go through them again," Shinkman
said, adding that he didn't think that those with
humanities degrees should "jump at the tirst
thing that comes along."
In fact, about one-half of all humanities
majors choose not to jump at all, and go on to
graduate school, according to Shinkman.
Campus recruiting is "out of balance'' for
those who are in the job market, Shinkman ad
mitted. Those companies interested in hiring
humanities majors — organizations in the arts,
social service work, associations and founda
tions — do not generallv recruit on campus.
Instead, the campus recruiting service is domi
nated by organizations that are large enough to
be able to project their hiring needs and have
recruiting personnel. These organizations usu
ally want technical majors.
Despite this imbalance, Shinkman estimated
that more than 100 companies recruit on cam
pus for people with humanities backgrounds.
He cites as examples banks, financial institu
tions, food product companies, department
stores and accounting firms.
A more traditional recruiter of humanities
students is the publishing industry.
Cindy McCann, human resources representa
tive for Addison-Wesley Publishing Company,
said that while many of their entry level jobs do
not require college degrees, the company views
humanities majors as valuable because of their
good writing and verbal communication skills.
Those with a bachelor's of arts degree may
begin as a sales representative. For this position,
McCann said neither a specific major nor tech
nical skills are necessary. "We train if you need
computer skills," she added.
Albert Flsen, professor of art history, said that
banks often hire humanities majors. "Some of
our best students have gone into banking," he
said.
According to Chris Vaughn, college relations
representative for Crocker Bank, "Many posi
tions require good communications skills." She
also recommended that humanities majors de
siring to work in banking include courses in
math, computer science, and accounting in
their undergraduate program.
Vaughn cautioned, "Because things are get
ting tight, a person may look more seriously at
bus\ness ma\ors' However , \he bank does \ook
at a humanities degree as a valuable asset, espe
cially when it is supplemented with other
courses.
In addition to academic background, extra
curricular activities enhance the marketability of

a humanities major. Shinkman advised students
to concentrate their efforts in one or two or
ganizations and really make a significant con
tribution to them. He added that it possible, one
should take on a leadership role which will not
only impress an employer but will serveyou well
when you get on the job."
Karen Porter, assistant director of Classes and
Student Services at the Stanford Alumni Associ
ation, graduated in 1 981 with aBA in history. She
said that as a history major she developed the
skills ot researching and writing, both of which
are important for her present job.

At a recent Experience By Degrees program
featuring English Department alumni, graduates
said there is life after Stanford for those with
humanities degrees.
Nancy Palmer Jones, a free-lance editor who is
also pursuing an acting career said, "I bflieve
you can do anything with an English major as
long as you know how to sel 1 it."
Lorna Thompson, another graduate with a BA
in English, echoed the importance of selling
yourself, not just your degree. She added that
while a humanities major from Stanford looks
impressive on a resume, it is only good for "get
ting your foot in the door."
In addition to a degree, Thompson stressed
that one needs contacts in the business world.
Now the assistant vice president of public in
formation for the Federal Home Loan Bank of
San Francisco, Thompson began working for the
bank as a result of a friend's recommendation.
She said that the onlv course she had taken in
college which gave her any business back
ground was Econ 1, which she took pass/fail.
The key to a successful career, no matter what
your major is, Thompson explained, is a willing
ness to work hard and determination to do any
thing, She warned students not to consider
>V*emse\ves prima donnas \ust because they are
from Stanford.
"The competition out there is fierce,"
Thompson continued, "but if you're bright and
willing to work hard, you'll put the competition
to shame."
