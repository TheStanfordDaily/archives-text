# SSRL research could develop laser weapons
## 
### JEFF BIDDULPH Senior staff writer 
A component of a controversial
proposal at the Stanford Synchrotron
Radiation Laboratory (SSRL) would
aid in the development of a new
weapons system which could involve
X-ray laser beams, according to
Philip Coyle, a staff member at the
Lawrence Livermore National Labo
ratories.
Research on the weapons system
would be conducted under the
R-project, a hitherto unidentified
component of the beam line con
struction proposal at SSRL, which has
been opposed officially by 15 faculty
and 280 staff members at the Stan
ford Linear Accelerator Center
(SLAC).
Oakey Noell, a fellow at the Stan
ford Arms Control and Disarmament
Program, said the weapons system,
powered by nuclear explosions,
could generate enough energy to
make it an extremely powerful de
vice of destruction. Noell also said

potential uses for the X-ray laser
weapons include Anti-Ballistic Mis
sile (ABM) and anti-satellite
weaponry.
Noell also pointed out that such
weapons systems, it tested in space,
would violate two existing nuclear
arms treaties between the United
States and the Soviet Union.
Coyle, Lawrence Livermore's as
sociate director for testing, said,
however, that the research involved
in the proposal would aid in many
other areas of science as well, and
that no applied research would take
place at SSRL.
It was the first official confirmation
that the proposal, sponsored by the
Lawrence Livermore, Los Alamos and
Sandia National Laboratories, the
three largest weapons laboratories in
the United States, would involve re
search which would help develop
the controversial weapons.
Arthur Bienenstock, the director
of SSRL, said the fact that the
R-project would aid in research for
such weapons "should not" affect
his decision whether or not to accept
the proposal. Bienenstock is waiting
for a recommendation from SSRL's
proposal review panel and said he
will make the decision soon after re
ceiving the recommendation.
Bienenstock had said in past inter
views that the proposal mentions the
R-project but does not define it. SSRL
is administratively independent from
SLAC, but it depends on SLAC for its
functioning.
An article in the San Francisco
Chronicle reported last September
that sources at Lawrence Livermore
had said the facility was developing
X-ray laser weapons as part of the "R
Program." The article said that Ed
ward Teller, the prime mover behind
the development of the hydrogen
bomb, had urged scientists at Lawr
ence Livermore to speed progress on
the "third generation" of weapons,
which could provide "an effective
nuclear shield for the nation."
Scientists have known for some
time that nuclear blasts yield pulses
of X-rays. Focusing those X-rays into
an intense beam of energy at a single
electromagnetic frequency pro

duces a laser.
The Chronicle article reported that
Teller had urged the development of
X-ray laser weapons because they
would do more for the United States'
defensive posture than merely yield
ing a "bigger bang."
Coyle said, however, that the
majority of the research which would
take place at SSRL would be "funda
mental work."
"We'd be studying the basic prop
erties of materials, which might find
application in any number of areas,"
Coyle said. "We wouldn't be work
ing on X-ray lasers at SSRL."
Bienenstock said that in making a
decision on the proposal he must
consider the fact that nuclear
weapons-related research would
only be a small part of all of the re
search at the facility. He said the re
search would contribute to the over
all understanding of nature in a way
that would help mankind.
It's a question of intellectual
freedom," he said. And tor me intel
lectual freedom is almost like a reli
gion."
Bienenstock also said that he r an
only make a decision based on what
the proposal states, and the proposal
does not mention X-ray laser re
