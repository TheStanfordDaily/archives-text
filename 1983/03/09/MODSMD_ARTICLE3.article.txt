A component of a controversial
proposal at the Stanford Synchrotron
Radiation Laboratory (SSRL) would
aid in the development of a new
weapons system which could involve
X-ray laser beams, according to
Philip Coyle, a staff member at the
Lawrence Livermore National Labo
ratories.
Research on the weapons system
would be conducted under the
R-project, a hitherto unidentified
component of the beam line con
struction proposal at SSRL, which has
been opposed officially by 15 faculty
and 280 staff members at the Stan
ford Linear Accelerator Center
(SLAC).
Oakey Noell, a fellow at the Stan
ford Arms Control and Disarmament
Program, said the weapons system,
powered by nuclear explosions,
could generate enough energy to
make it an extremely powerful de
vice of destruction. Noell also said

potential uses for the X-ray laser
weapons include Anti-Ballistic Mis
sile (ABM) and anti-satellite
weaponry.
Noell also pointed out that such
weapons systems, it tested in space,
would violate two existing nuclear
arms treaties between the United
States and the Soviet Union.
Coyle, Lawrence Livermore's as
sociate director for testing, said,
however, that the research involved
in the proposal would aid in many
other areas of science as well, and
that no applied research would take
place at SSRL.
It was the first official confirmation
that the proposal, sponsored by the
Lawrence Livermore, Los Alamos and
Sandia National Laboratories, the
three largest weapons laboratories in
the United States, would involve re
search which would help develop
the controversial weapons.
Arthur Bienenstock, the director
of SSRL, said the fact that the
