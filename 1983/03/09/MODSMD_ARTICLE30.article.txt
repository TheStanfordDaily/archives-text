Nuclear Reactors at Stanford, Part 11.
If you walk out Stanford Avenue past
Peter Coutts Road, almost to Raimundo
Way, you can't miss the big gray barn.
It's huge, for one thing, very ugly, for
another, and it has a great view of the
foothills. Since 1973, nothing in particu
lar has been done with the building —
it's used for storage, and some mem
bers of the Art Department have private
studios there. The action in the barn
used to be a little hotter, though —
from 1959 to 1973, it was home for a
working nuclear reactor.
The building is still called the Ryan
Lab, a name which goes back to the days
when Prof. Harris Ryan did electrical
engineering research there. Then it was
used for electrical research by a private
company. In 1959 Mechanical Engineer
ing Prof. George Leppert brought the
reactor to campus. At that time the
Atomic Energy Commission ran a fel
lowship program for the training of nu
clear engineers at universities. With fel
lowship money from the AEC for stu
dents, a grant from the National Science
Foundation for construction, and fuel
loaned by the government, the Nuclear
Engineering Division of the M.E. De
partment was in business.
The reactor was an extremely low
power one, and it was started up only
when needed for specific projects.
Compared to a power reactor (one
used for the production of electricity)
which might operate at 1000 megawatts,
Stanford's reactor was a measly 10-kilo
watt job. The reactor was operated by

students, who after a year in the pro
gram could be licensed by the AEC.
It was never used for power
purposes, of course, just teaching and
research. According to Mechanical En
gineering Prof. Rudolph Sher, one of
the directors of the experimental pro
gram at the reactor (and my source for
the above), the doctoral students in the
program went into research or man
agement in the industry or government
labs, while the master's students gener
ally became plant engineers at nuclear
power plants. There are one or two
Stanford grads working now at Diablo
Canyon, he said.
According to Sher, the presence of
the reactor never drew any serious pro
test, not even during the height of anti
war, anti-military activism. He
speculates that the reactor's location, in
an area considered "off-campus" by
students, kept it out of the public mind.
The Stanford Police warned the M.E.
Department at one point that students
were planning a march on the reactor,
but the march never materialized.
Several events came together in 1973
that forced the shutdown of the reac
tor: the AEC terminated the fellowship
program; the University had budget
problems; and the low-power reactor
gradually become uncompetitive in a
research scene which demanded more
and more powerful reactors. The fuel
on hand was shipped to Idaho, and the
console and control rod drives were
shipped to the nuclear museum in Oak

Ridge, Tennessee, where you can see
them today in a working-model reac
tor.
That wasn't the end of the story,
though. For the last 11 years, the Uni
versity has been trying to get the Nucle
ar Regulatory Commission (NRC) to
certify the Ryan Lab for general use, a
process known as "decommission
ing."Still in the building is the shield
that housed the reactor core — a 24-
foot-tall, 8-foot-thick concrete tank —
and at the bottom of the tank, right
below where the reactor core used to
be, the radiation is still above legal
levels.
According to John Holmes, a senior
health physicist in the Office of Risk
Management, an area isn't considered
safe until a person could live there, 24
hours a day, 365 days a year, safely. The
legal limit for general use is 10 millirems
of radiation above background levels;
the current level at the bottom of the
tank (but nowhere else in the building)
is 35 millirems above back
ground.(Background radiation is about
100 millirems.) Holmes said this level
compares to what you would get from
living continuously in front of a color
television set.
Holmes said he feels the decom
missioning is "99 percent" complete,
but he would have said the same three
years ago. In the meantime, the Univer
sity is paying the NRC a $100 "indemnity
fee" every year until the building is
certified.

Nuclear Reactors at Stanford, Part 11.
If you walk out Stanford Avenue past
Peter Coutts Road, almost to Raimundo
Way, you can't miss the big gray barn.
It's huge, for one thing, very ugly, for
another, and it has a great view of the
foothills. Since 1973, nothing in particu
lar has been done with the building —
it's used for storage, and some mem
bers of the Art Department have private
studios there. The action in the barn
used to be a little hotter, though —
from 1959 to 1973, it was home for a
working nuclear reactor.
The building is still called the Ryan
Lab, a name which goes back to the days
when Prof. Harris Ryan did electrical
engineering research there. Then it was
used for electrical research by a private
company. In 1959 Mechanical Engineer
ing Prof. George Leppert brought the
reactor to campus. At that time the
Atomic Energy Commission ran a fel
lowship program for the training of nu
clear engineers at universities. With fel
lowship money from the AEC for stu
dents, a grant from the National Science
Foundation for construction, and fuel
loaned by the government, the Nuclear
Engineering Division of the M.E. De
partment was in business.
The reactor was an extremely low
power one, and it was started up only
when needed for specific projects.
Compared to a power reactor (one
used for the production of electricity)
which might operate at 1000 megawatts,
Stanford's reactor was a measly 10-kilo
watt job. The reactor was operated by

students, who after a year in the pro
gram could be licensed by the AEC.
It was never used for power
purposes, of course, just teaching and
research. According to Mechanical En
gineering Prof. Rudolph Sher, one of
the directors of the experimental pro
gram at the reactor (and my source for
the above), the doctoral students in the
program went into research or man
agement in the industry or government
labs, while the master's students gener
ally became plant engineers at nuclear
power plants. There are one or two
Stanford grads working now at Diablo
Canyon, he said.
According to Sher, the presence of
the reactor never drew any serious pro
test, not even during the height of anti
war, anti-military activism. He
speculates that the reactor's location, in
an area considered "off-campus" by
students, kept it out of the public mind.
The Stanford Police warned the M.E.
Department at one point that students
were planning a march on the reactor,
but the march never materialized.
Several events came together in 1973
that forced the shutdown of the reac
tor: the AEC terminated the fellowship
program; the University had budget
problems; and the low-power reactor
gradually become uncompetitive in a
research scene which demanded more
and more powerful reactors. The fuel
on hand was shipped to Idaho, and the
console and control rod drives were
shipped to the nuclear museum in Oak

Ridge, Tennessee, where you can see
them today in a working-model reac
tor.
That wasn't the end of the story,
though. For the last 11 years, the Uni
versity has been trying to get the Nucle
ar Regulatory Commission (NRC) to
certify the Ryan Lab for general use, a
process known as "decommission
ing."Still in the building is the shield
that housed the reactor core — a 24-
foot-tall, 8-foot-thick concrete tank —
and at the bottom of the tank, right
below where the reactor core used to
be, the radiation is still above legal
levels.
According to John Holmes, a senior
health physicist in the Office of Risk
Management, an area isn't considered
safe until a person could live there, 24
hours a day, 365 days a year, safely. The
legal limit for general use is 10 millirems
of radiation above background levels;
the current level at the bottom of the
tank (but nowhere else in the building)
is 35 millirems above back
ground.(Background radiation is about
100 millirems.) Holmes said this level
compares to what you would get from
living continuously in front of a color
television set.
Holmes said he feels the decom
missioning is "99 percent" complete,
but he would have said the same three
years ago. In the meantime, the Univer
sity is paying the NRC a $100 "indemnity
fee" every year until the building is
certified.
