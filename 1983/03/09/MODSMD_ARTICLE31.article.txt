# Question: when was the last time you took an exam?

### CHIA-LIEN WANG 
Reading comprehension
A No. 2 pencil rests in your
fingers.
Your heart beat quickens as
the clock ticks.
A sheet of paper, perhaps
blank, perhaps filled with
countless numbers of empty
ovals, stares at you.
Your mind is not functioning
clearly (could it have been the
one hour of sleep you had! 1 ).
Question: Where are you?
Answer:
A. In food service filling out
a questionnaire about the
latest dish — chicken fritters.
B. In a classroom and taking
a test.
If you chose B, your answer
is correct.
You have just taken a test
and remembered a situation
that has recurred since you
were a toddler.
The mention of the word
examination , often pro
nounced in bold black letters,
sends at least a little shiver
down one's spine. The act of
taking a test begins from kin
dergarten and continues and
continues and continues. . . .
PSAT/N MSQT's, SAT's,
ACT's, AP's, AchT's — test ac
ronyms abound. The fun does
not stop there, however. After
college some look toward
graduate school, medical
school, law school, business

school. What is one factor in
determining whether or not
one gains admission? The
GRE's, MCAT's, LSAT's, DATs,
G MAT's.
But wait, the tests persist.
After post-graduate education
looms the real world, in addi
tion to more "assessments of
skill and aptitude." Nursing
lie ensure exams, certified pub
lic accountant tests, basic
medical and basic dental sci
ences tests and the NTE (Na
tional Teacher Examination).
The fact is that tests are
everywhere, and the emphasis
on them is growing.
In response to this increas
ing emphasis on tests, Stanley
H. Kaplan Educational Center
and other such test
preparation schools such as
G.A.P.S. (Graduate Admis
sions Preparation Service),
Amity Testing Institute and Na
tional Review Courses.
All claim to help one wade
through reviews for the al
phabet soup of standardized
tests. Kaplan founded his edu
cational center in 1938. Since
then, other centers have fol
lowed Kaplan's lead. A pam
phlet distributed by G.A.P.S.
states, "It is an accepted fact
that actual ability, intelligence
and motivation are secondary
to the quantitative evaluation
of grade point average and the
admissions test score." Stu
dents have responded to this
calling by enrolling in review

courses.
Ken Mertzel, a junior dec id
ing between medical school or
business school, took a Kaplan
review course because both
schools require exams as part
of the admissions process.
"The MCAT is important . . .

that's why I took the course,"
Mertzel said.
His thoughts are echoed by
at least 100,000 others enrolled
in Kaplan's courses. Kaplan
said the approximate enroll
ment per quarter in his courses
is "eettine biaser and better."

After all, ho said, "improved
students get improved
scores."
I he increased number of
test-preparation centers arid
enrollment is not the only re
sponse' to the growing test c ult.
The test industry itself has be

come a multi-million dollar
business.
The Educational Testing Ser
vice is one of several associa
tions that administer stan
dardized tests. The ETS is
based in Princeton, New Jer
sey, and produces the PSAT,

the SAT and other tests. Com
parison figures for tin 1 number
of people taking the SAT alone
are as follows: in 1951-52.
the number was 81,000; by
1970 the figure had climbed to
1.5 million. The ETS take-; in
about $70 million per year.
Amidst all the controversy
about the emphasis on tests
steps are being taken to rub
away the tarnished image ot
the standardized test. Some ot
the more competitive colleges
are stressing the equally im
portant essay questions and
extracurricular activities.
Fred Hargadon, dean of ad
missions here and chairman of
the College Board, was u r
available for comment because
he was reading
However, a guide to the "N >st
Frequently Asked Questions
About Applying for Admission
to Stanford" said admission
officers here "consider each
(score) separately . . . (and) do
not automatically throw out
any application because of a
low (grade point average) or j
low test score."
While some insist that test
are relied upon too heavily
others are realizing the situ.i
tion and attempting to retliiy
if. One could be a philosopher
and say that tests are
everywhere, in s< hool and out
side of school. It is true that in
America the spectre of tests .s
haunting us.
