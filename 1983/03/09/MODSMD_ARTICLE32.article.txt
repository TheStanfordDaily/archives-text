# New life support technology raises medical ethics questions
## 
### DANIEL LABOV 
Does man have a right to die? Can a peace
ful and dignified death be more valuable
than a life devoid any quality? Does man
even have the right to make life and death
decisions in the first plate, or is this playing
Cod?"
These and many other difficult questions
of medical ethics have become increasingly
salient due to the growth of life support
technology. While all the answers are not
easily found, decisions must be reached
concerning today's critically ill patients.
Manv problematic issues are addressed in
this quarter's "Progress in medicine" lecture
series at the University Medical Center. The
series, provocatively entitled "Who Shall
Live?' was put together by Michael Cowlen,
the center's director of Public Events, in con
junction with several doctors and protes
sors.
Dr. James Silverman, who introduced the
series, said it was meant to "enlighten you
(the public) to the problems of medical
ethics and better enable you to deal with
difficult decisions yourself."
A common misconception, according to
Silverman, is that doctors have some mystical
power to bestow life and death as thev
choose, and therefore can plav Cod. "The
truth is physicians really have no such
power. We only try to save those we
can. . he said.
Today's problems in medical ethics do not
center around choosing which individuals to
save, as they may have in the past: the more
important question is, what kind of life is
worth prolonging when the efforts neces
sary are enormous? In Silverman's words,
"When we can't do anymore, and there is no
hope, we want to cease those efforts." Un
fortunately, since tew precedents have re
ally been set, it is unclear exactly when it is
justifiable to cease lite sustaining ettnrts

This new problem is a result of large ad
vances in technology of life support sys
tems, according to Dr. Thomas Ratlin, assis
tant chief of medicine at the Med Center and
assistant professor at Stanlord. Today's in
tensive care units can keep nearly dead
people artificially lunctioning lor months,
even if there is no chance for recovery.
If indeed a patient has almost no chance to
recover, it seems that intensive care support
can do more harm than good. The lite pro
vided for the patient is often one of constant
pain with no relief.
Raffi n estimated the cost of keeping a pa
tient in an intensive care unit at $2000 to
52300 a day. The cost in human terms can be
far greater; it is tremendously difficult for a
family to watch a loved one die slowly.
Realizing that prolonged life at anv cost is
not the only consideration, Ratfin outlined
the three goals of the Intensive Care Unit

(ICU) health care team: to save the salvage
able (restore health), to help the dying
achieve a peaceful and dignified death (re
lieve suffering), and to uphold the principle
' Primum non Nocere" (first do no harm). If
maintaining a patient in an ICU is on net
doing harm, then according to Primum non
Nocere, it should not be done. Raffin
claimed that this principle is too often vio
lated in America.

Following the above goals is still not easily
done. Ratfin said, "Every medical case is
unique and different. One cannot make
across the board generalizations." The facts
of each situation must determine whether
life support should be continued or with
drawn.
It is often helpful, said Raffin, to bring "a
non-medical expert into the decision mak
ing process," such as an ethicist, psycholo
gist or a social worker. One person often
consulted at the Stanford Hospital is the Re

verend Ernie Young, Chaplain and
senior lecturer in medical ethics.
Young pointed to objectivity as the key
tor someone in his role. "While I am very
much aware of the issues involved in making
difficult medical decisions ... I can reflect
on these more objectively in the class
room." Young said he can he called'into a
case either by a patient's family or physicians
who seek "an opinion from a more emo
tionally detached perspective."
Young characterizes his decision-making
process as one combining certain absolute,
timeless principles with an analysis of each
particular situation. He calls this a "mixed
deontological and utilitarian approach." He
claims that the logic of utilitarianism helps
him rank and apply ethical principle to the
case at hand. "Another very important point
is the principle of autonomy. We ... let the
patient decide as much as possible." This, of

course, is only possible "where the patient is
conscious and coherent as well as compe
tent," he said.
Otherwise, Young takes into considera
tion any prior statements a patient may have
made which indicate what he or she would
desire (such as a living will), lhe patient,
physicians, tamily and consultant then try
and come to a unanimous decision. With no
absolute guidelines to follow, consensus is
the main criterion tor determining the ad
visability of intensive care.
There is widespread agreement that
heightened community awareness of these
problems in medical ethics will be benefi
cial. If potential patients discuss their views
more with tamily and physicians, "the bur
den of making difficult decisions can be
lifted from a patient's loved ones," accord
ing to Raffin.
It is quite clear that the medical profession
can only stand to gain from further discus
sion as well. As these problems are relatively
new, many doctors are unfamiliar with
them. Young said, "Important as it is, I don't
think doctor s get enough training in this
area.'' On the other hand, Raffin pointed
out, "Doctors are very familiar with being on
the cutting edge of making difficult and
heartwrenching decisions."
Raffin pointed out another benefit of
more community awareness of the issues,
"Physicians will come to be more comforta
ble in withdrawing life support when ap
propriate, when the patient has no chance to
recover a decent quality of life."
For the interested undergraduate, there
are several courses offered related to medi
cal ethics. These include courses in human
biology (one taught by Raffin called "In
tensive life support systems â€” present prai -
tices and moral issues"), courses in philoso
phy and several undergraduate spec ials and
seminars.
