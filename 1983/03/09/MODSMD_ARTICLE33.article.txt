# Men head to Indy
## 
### MARK ZEIGLER 
When you ask Stanford's
men's swimming coach Skip
Kenney what an NCAA title
would mean to him, he calmly
states, "It would definitely be
the highlight of my career."
Kenney then pulls out a
newsprint magazine and opens
it to a page filled with pictures
of various styles of champion
ships rings. "This is what it's all
about," he says.
But before Kenney can
change the rings from news
print to gold, he and his Cardi
nal swimmers must first con
tend with the likes of defend
ing champs Texas at the
NCAAs, to be held at In
dianapolis, Ind., March 24-26.
Although Kenney and com
pany upset the Long horns
58-55 in their own pool two
months ago, the most recent
national poll has Texas rated
No. 1 and Stanford No. 2. The
rankings, however, were com
piled before the Pacific-10
Conference Championships, a
title Stanford solidly defended
last weekend in Los Angeles.
Nevertheless, Kenney, not
to mention his team, expresses
almost boyish confidence
when it comes to Indianapolis.
"We've got to take advan
tage of Texas' weaknesses,"
the Card coach said. "They
have more events without
quality people (qualified) than
we do.
"You have to take advantage
when the door of opportunity
is open. We have to score
points in the events in which
they have no qualifiers."
Translated into swimming
talk, that means the Cardinal
must score big in the 500 and
1650 freestyles, events in which
senior Bari Weick and junior
Dave Sims will take the blocks
for Stanford against no Texas
opponents.
Kennedy, admittedly not af
raid to "go out on a limb" with
his predicitons, put the most
emphasis on the 500 free, cal
ling it the most important race
for the Card.
i "If we get both guys (Sims
and Weick) in the top six, we
will win the meet," Kenney
said of the 500 free. "If we
don't, we could still win, but it
will be harder."
If the NCAAs come down to
the relays, though, Kenney
gives the nod to the Lon
ghorns, especially in the 400
free relay, the meet's final
event.
Other important events will
be the 100 and 200 backstrokes,
the 200 butterfly and the 200
IM, all races in which both

Stanford and Texas field strong
line-ups. "Our key people
have to beat their key people,"
Kenney explained.
Texas is led by backstroker
Rick Carey, who set two
American records last week at
the Southwest Conference
Championships. Carey broke
his own American mark in the
200 back with a 1:45.35 clock
ing and shattered the standard
in the 10 back with a 48.80.
Stanford sophomore Dave Bot
tom held the old record in the
event at 48.94.
Sims, Bottom and freshman
lohn Moffet have the best
shots at winning individual
events in Indianapolis, accord
ing to Kenney. The Card coach
noted that Jon Denney and
lohn Simons have outside
chances at taking firsts.
Of the Cardinal's relay
teams, the 400 medley squad is
in best shape as far as a first
place finish is concerned. The
team of Bottom, Moffet, Mark
Michaels (pictured above) and
Sam Worden broke the Pac-10
meet record last Thursday with
a 3:16.94 clocking.
Another key to 1983's
NCAAs, according to Kenney,
will be the consolation finals.
In the 1982 NCAAs at Mil
waukee, Wis., Stanford
finished a close third behind
champion Texas and UCLA,
with only 28 points separating
the first three teams.
Bottom finished third in the
100 fly and fourth in each of the
100 and 200 backs. John Engs
took third in the latter race
while Weick was fourth in the
1650 free.

change the rings from news
print to gold, he and his Cardi
nal swimmers must first con
tend with the likes of defend
ing champs Texas at the
NCAAs, to be held at In
dianapolis, Ind., March 24-26.
Although Kenney and com
pany upset the Long horns
58-55 in their own pool two
months ago, the most recent
national poll has Texas rated
No. 1 and Stanford No. 2. The
rankings, however, were com
piled before the Pacific-10
Conference Championships, a
title Stanford solidly defended
last weekend in Los Angeles.
Nevertheless, Kenney, not
to mention his team, expresses
almost boyish confidence
when it comes to Indianapolis.
"We've got to take advan
tage of Texas' weaknesses,"
the Card coach said. "They
have more events without
quality people (qualified) than
we do.
"You have to take advantage
when the door of opportunity
is open. We have to score
points in the events in which
they have no qualifiers."
Translated into swimming
talk, that means the Cardinal
must score big in the 500 and
1650 freestyles, events in which
senior Bari Weick and junior
Dave Sims will take the blocks
for Stanford against no Texas
opponents.
Kennedy, admittedly not af
raid to "go out on a limb" with
his predicitons, put the most
emphasis on the 500 free, cal
ling it the most important race
for the Card.
i "If we get both guys (Sims
and Weick) in the top six, we
will win the meet," Kenney
said of the 500 free. "If we
don't, we could still win, but it
will be harder."
If the NCAAs come down to
the relays, though, Kenney
gives the nod to the Lon
ghorns, especially in the 400
free relay, the meet's final
event.
Other important events will
be the 100 and 200 backstrokes,
the 200 butterfly and the 200
IM, all races in which both

Stanford and Texas field strong
line-ups. "Our key people
have to beat their key people,"
Kenney explained.
Texas is led by backstroker
Rick Carey, who set two
American records last week at
the Southwest Conference
Championships. Carey broke
his own American mark in the
200 back with a 1:45.35 clock
ing and shattered the standard
in the 10 back with a 48.80.
Stanford sophomore Dave Bot
tom held the old record in the
event at 48.94.
Sims, Bottom and freshman
lohn Moffet have the best
shots at winning individual
events in Indianapolis, accord
ing to Kenney. The Card coach
noted that Jon Denney and
lohn Simons have outside
chances at taking firsts.
Of the Cardinal's relay
teams, the 400 medley squad is
in best shape as far as a first
place finish is concerned. The
team of Bottom, Moffet, Mark
Michaels (pictured above) and
Sam Worden broke the Pac-10
meet record last Thursday with
a 3:16.94 clocking.
Another key to 1983's
NCAAs, according to Kenney,
will be the consolation finals.
In the 1982 NCAAs at Mil
waukee, Wis., Stanford
finished a close third behind
champion Texas and UCLA,
with only 28 points separating
the first three teams.
Bottom finished third in the
100 fly and fourth in each of the
100 and 200 backs. John Engs
took third in the latter race
while Weick was fourth in the
1650 free.

travel with the men's team to
Indianapolis for first-hand
coverage of the NCAA
Championships, March 24-26.)
