When Stanford women's
swimming coach George
Haines says "we're a better
team than last year tor sure,"
he doesn't necessarily mean
that the Cardinal will improve
on last year's second place
finish at the NCAA Champion
ships.
In fact, WCAA titlist Stanford
could finish thi rd at next
week's NCA A sin Lincoln,
Neb., and still swim better than
ever before. Ihe NCAA now
includes Texas, last season's
AIAVV champion, to go along
with the Floridas, USCs and
North Carolinas.
Haines sees the 1983 NCAAs
as a three-way battle between
defending champ Florida,
Texas and Stanford, with USC
and North Carolina as dar
khorse contenders. "But
Florida has to be the favorite,"
he said.
"To win," Haines explained,
"everyone that has qualified
has got to be dedicated to the
fact that they have to score. If
we can score everyone that
should score, then we have a
chance to win.
"But we have to be good at
every spot."

Haines and company will
probably field the deepest
team at Lincoln, as the Card has
qualified three or more swim
mers in 12 of the 17 individual
events.
Stanford should rack up the
most points in the freestyle
races, qualifying five swim
mers in the 50 free, seven in the
100, five in the 200, five in the
500 and six in the 1650.
"We're still weak in the (but
ter) fly, but we're hoping that
Texas and Florida split up the
points in the fly," Haines said.
The Card coach indicated
the relays as the key events in
the three-day NCAA meet.
"But when it gets right down to
it, the 1650 (freestyle) on the
last day could be the key
event,"he said. Although a
Stanford swimmer may not win
the 1650, the Card should
come away with a considerable
amount of points in the event.
With the diving qualifying
meet not until this weekend,
Haines hopes to take as many
divers as possible to Lincoln.
One of those should be
sophomore Ail-American lean
Meyer, who finished fourth
last year at the NCAAs.
