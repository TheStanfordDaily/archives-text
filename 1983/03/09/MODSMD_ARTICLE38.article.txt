# Card takes 2 of 3 from 'Cats
## 
### SID SPAETH Senior sports writer 
Tucson, Ariz. — Mark Mar
quess said he felt all along it
would be hard to repeat the
fifth place finish ot his Stanford
haseball team in the College
World Series last year.
But Marquess is grooming a
team this year that is challeng
ing for a top spot in the South
ern Division of the Pacific-10
(6-Pac) — a conference that for
the first time in several years
has some instability at the top.
Stanford sits in second place
in the division behind USC
which pulled off a surprising
sweep of a doubleheader
against top-ranked Arizona
State Sunday.
Stanford's steady progress

was capsulized in their series
against Arizona last weekend.
The Cardinal won two of the
three games to improve their
conference record to 3-1.
Rain and gusty winds
clamped down on Wildcat
Field for the opener Friday, giv
ing the Cardinal a sense of
being at home. Only two brief
rain delays disturbed the game
and "while the conditions
were not ideal, they were
fine,'' Marquess said.
Stanford started the scoring,
but Arizona pushed three runs
across in the bottom of the
seventh inning to garner the
come-from-behind win 4-3.
Ed Vosberg went the dis
tance, upping his record to 5-0

and keeping Stanford away
from a chance at the Wildcat
bullpen, which has been a
tragedy all season, left Ballard
picked up the loss for Stanford,
dropping his record to 3-1.
The Cardinal built a 3-0 lead
on single runs in the first, fourth
and fifth innings, causing many
of the sparse crowd of 400 to
leave.
Pete Stanicek led Stanford to
their lead with a three-for-five
performance from the plate,
two runs and a run batted in.
The Wildcats picked up the
winning runs in the seventh.
After getting |.R. Howell to fly
out to start the inning, John
Radtke gave up singles to |ohn
Beuerlein and Mark Wing.
David Cooper then hit into a
fielder's choice when john
Verducci fielded his ground
ball and forced Beuerlein at
third.
Wayne Bonheim drove in the
second run with a pinch-hit
single to right and Kerry Burns
followed with a pinch-hit dou
ble to deep left-center, driving
in the tying and winning runs.
Stanford stranded runners
on bases in each of the last four
innings and Marquess said that
decided the outcome.
"When we didn't score any
runs in the seventh and eighth
with runners on, I think that
was the difference,'' Marquess
said. "They scored when they
had the chances. I really think
their record is deceiving.
"They're a good team and
any time Vosberg is pitching,
they are going to be tough. Any
time you go into a series in this
conference expecting to win
two-of-three or sweeping,
you're crazy."
The sun started to shine
Saturday, setting the stage for a
heroic grand slam by
Hardgrave and a game winning
homer by Vince Sakowski that
gave Stanford a tense 10-9 win.
Arizona led 5-1 after four in
nings, gi'ing the 1747 fans a
hope of winning two straight,
but Stanford would not quit.
Verducci led off the Cardinal
fifth with a single and Wildcat
starter Joe Magrane loaded the
bases by walking Stanicek and
hitting Mark Davis with a pitch.

Magrane then struck out
Dotterer and built the count to
1-2 on Hardgrave before he
blasted the next pitch more
than 440 feet to centerfield tor
the game-tying grand slam.
"It was a great hit," Mar
quess said. I thought it was
going to be another long dav "
Arizona tied the score in the
seventh. Cregg Lomnicky and
Ballard walked the first three
Wildcat batters to load the
bases. Darrell Higgs drove in
Dave Landrith with a sacrifice
fly to center, Burns drove in
wing with a pinch-hit single to
center, and Ralston drove in
the tying runs — Howell and
Burns — with a double to cen
ter, before kunkel came in to
get the final out.
kunkel scattered two hits the
rest of the way to pick up his
second win of the year and
Sakowski put the game away
with a two-out solo home run
in the eighth to provide the
final 10-9 margin.
"Kunkel did a super job com
ing in and throwing strikes,"
Marquess said. "He hasn't
pitched a lot because we have a
lot of veteran pitchers ahead of
him and we want to bring him
along slowly, but he is going to
be good."
Stanford finally breathed a
little easier Sunday, scoring
nine runs in the fifth inning to
increase their lead to 12-1 be
fore coasting to a 15-6 win.
Lorenzetti hit two home runs
and five RBl's and Sakowski
added a three-run double.
Steve Cottrell, who pitched
three strong innings Friday but
was pulled out of the game be
cause of a bad chest cold,
pitched five innings and picked
up the win, improving his re
cord to 4-1.
Stanford coasted by UC-
Davis yesterday 16-6 in non
league action. The Card
pounded out 17 hits while
Kunkel pitched eight innings of
six-hit baseball to record the
win.
The Cardinal travels to Santa
Clara tomorrow at 2:30 p.m. in
another non-league contest.
Stanford hosts USC and ASU in
two key Pac-10 series over
spring break.
