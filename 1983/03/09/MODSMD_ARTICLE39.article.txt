## 
### LIBBY LEONARD 
Although the men's fenc
ing team was caught off
guard by the Air Force
Academy last weekend, it
still captured second place
in the Western Regional
Championships.
Stanford finished with an
impressive 7-1 overall re
cord and qualified three
men for the NCAA National
Championships. Air Force
was not favored to win but
ran away with the title by
remaining undefeated.
The Cardinal secured
second place honors after
soundly beating San lose
State 16-11 in Sunday's final
round. San lose State (6-2)
took third in the nine-team
competition, followed by
Cal State Northridge (5-3)
and long Beach State (4-4).
Stanford s 11 fencers
competed in all three
events: sabre, foil and
epce. Different weapons,
target areas and scoring tac
tics distinguish the various
categories. All fencing
bouts, or individual con
tests, are limited to four
minutes. The first person to

be hit five times is the loser.
In sabre, Stanford did not
drop a bout, and the team
earned first place.
Stanford finished in a
three-way tie with Air Force
and San lose State in the foil
competition.
According to Hurst, Stan
ford's championship hopes
were spoiled in the epee
competition. The Card's
epee team went 3-3, which
was only good enough for
fourth place. Air Force won
the event with a 6-0 record.
Senior Harvey Cain
finished third, but Stan
ford's other epee contes
tants failed to add the
necessary points to improve
the team's standing.
Howard Cash, Elliott
Cheu and Cain will repre
sent Stanford in the Nation
als, March 24-26 in Kenosha,
Wis.
This ;s only the second
time we have qualified three
men for the NCAA Nation
als," Hurst explained.
"Without a doubt, this is the
strongest team Stanford has
ever sent."
