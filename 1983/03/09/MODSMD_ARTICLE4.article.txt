# Civil rights lawyers decide to withdraw disputed course
## 
### JEFF BIDDULPH Senior staff writer 
Faced with opposition from two black stu
dent groups, lack Greenberg and Julius
Chambers said yesterday that they would
not offer their course "Racial Discrimination
and Civil Rights" here this spring.
After having received a letter from Stan
tord's Black American Law Student Associa
tion (BALSA) saying it "c.\nnot in good eon
science endorse" the course and having
heard of the Black Student Union's (BSU)
opposition to the course, the two civil rights
lawyers decided not to teach the course
here, according to Chambers.
Both refused to give reasons lor their
withdrawal of the course, saying they would
release an official statement next week.

Seth Lintield, the director of the Guest
Professorship Bureau (GPB), who was in
New York negotiating with Cireenberg, said
the course was withdrawn because the
lawyer "doesn't want to be at the center of
controversy again."
The course was boycotted when it was
taught this winter at the Harvard Law School.
Greenberg is the executive director of the
National Association for the Advancement
of Colored People Legal Defense Fund and
Chambers is its president-counsel.
Chambers said the course "was helpful at
Harvard and it would have been helpful
there (at Stanford). I am disappointed not to
be able to teach it."
Rhonda Trotter, co-chairperson of the
BSU, said last night that the organization's

opposition "was not a personal attack on
jack Greenberg or julius Chambers or the
course."
She said the BSU opposed the course for a
number of reasons. She said an endorse
ment would have been a "slap in the face" of
black students at Harvard who boycotted the
course. She also said the three-week course,
which would have cost $9800, is too expen-
A statement issued earlier by the BSU said
the GPB should consult minority com
munities here "when committees of the
ASSU sponsor courses or activities which are
of direct concern to those communities."
BALSA's statement said the group was
prompted to oppose the course because of a
"gross lack of minority law faculty" at the

Law School. The group is, therefore, calling
tor "a recommitment to increasing both the
number of minority faculty and the number
of courses addressing the issues of racism
and racial discrimination." '
BALSA also said that it opposed the course
because the GPB avoided consideration of a
course entitled "Africans In Transition: the
ttfects ot the Invasions." • _ _

traded national attention when jatnes Vor
enberg, dean of the Harvard Law School,
charged that Harvard's Black Law Student
Association was boycotting because
Greenberg is white.
A second statement issued by BALSA de
nied any racial consideration in its opposi
tion.

' Although it is convenient for some, not
ably the opponents of affirmative action, to
characterize the issue simply as one of race,
to do so is neither consistent with the facts at
hand nor with BALSA's intent," the state
ment reads. "The problem is not Jack
Greenberg or Julius Chambers. The prob
lem is the wave of reactionary cutbacks and
affirmative action rollharku (hat are afflictinv,
Vh\rd Worirt Peoplv tn this rime ot economic
crises."
Trotter emphasized that the BSU's opposi
tion was "not a racial issue" as well.
Linfield said the GPB would meet to de
cide where to use the money allocated for
the course.
