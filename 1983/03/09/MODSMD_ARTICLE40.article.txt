# Bruins batter Lady Card
## 
### LIBBY LEONARD 
It has been a rather fruit
less finale tor the women's
basketball team. Stanford
never fully ripened, and
now it's perishing as the
season draws to a close.
UCLA ransacked Stanford
92-69 last Saturday in the
Cardinal's fourth consecu
tive conference loss, drop
ping its VVCAA record to 4-7.
UCLA, ranked in the na
tion's top 20 secured a
NCAA tournament birth as

its record rose to 9-4.
The Card needed more
than a pawnbroker to bail
out ot its 49-29 halftime def
icit. Despite a stronger
second-half performance
(Stanford was only out
scored 43-40), a balanced
scoreboard was out ot the
Card's reach.
A familiar face, senior
Meg Metzger, was missing
from the Card's starting
line-up. The six-foot for
ward, who is the team's cap

tain and top scorer,
watched most of the game
from the bench. Metzger is
averaging 16 points per
game but has not turned in
impressive stats or double
figures in her last five out
ings.
The Cardinal has only two
chances lett to upgrade its
first WCAA season.
Tomorrow the Card will
host 9-2 Long Beach State in
Maples Pavilion at 5:45 p.m.
seems to be quite sure, hut
their youth and multitude ot
close losses this year (eight
by three points or less)
seem to point in that direc
tion.
Oregon is led by its 7-foot
center, Blair Rasmussen,
who has matured enor
mously since the last meet
ing between the two clubs.
Paul Bain and Gary
Gate wood will start at
guards for the Ducks, al
though Haney likes to em
ploy a plethora of people
per position.
The Ducks are solid at
torward, where captain
Dave Brantley and lerry
Adams get the starting
nods.
The other "Twin Tower"
the Ducks publicized in
their preseason season
ticket campaign is junior

Ron Burns, but he has been
ineffective due to a congen
ital back problem. Brian Di-
Biaso, son of former Stan
ford coach Dick Di√üiaso,
made the UO roster as a
walk-on and sees limited ac
tion.
Oregon State, unlike
Stantord or Oregon, will be
playing for more than statis
tics or pride. The Beavers,
winners of 10 of their last 11
games, are 17-9 overall and
11-5 in league play. They
need two wins to try and
clinch a post-season berth,
be it NCAA or NIT.
OSU is literally centered
around post man Charlie
Sitton, who Bill Walton
called the best all-around
player in the country. It's
not hard to figure out why
after watching the 6-8 All-
America play.
Sitton can post up and
maneuver inside, he can go
outside with range up to 21
feet, he fires outlet passes
with quickness and accu

racy, and he is probably the
most aggressive player in
the conference. He has that
rare knack of making
everyone he plays with look
good.
Not to say that Sitton's
supporting cast is not good
in its own right. The Bea
vers' starting backcourt is a
blend of experience and
youth with senior William
Brew and freshman Darryl
Flowers.
The starting corner men
tor OSU are 6-8 sophomore
A. C . Green and Dan n v
Evans.
The bench is where OSU
is weakest, although Steve
Wood si d e and lam ie
Stangel have on occasion
sparked th e Beavers- a
case-in-point being when
they tied for team-high scor
ing honors, each netting 14
points in Oregon State's
62-53 victory over the Car
dinal in Corvallis. After
them OSU gets very thin.
