# Bruins batter Lady Card
## 
### LIBBY LEONARD 
It has been a rather fruit
less finale tor the women's
basketball team. Stanford
never fully ripened, and
now it's perishing as the
season draws to a close.
UCLA ransacked Stanford
92-69 last Saturday in the
Cardinal's fourth consecu
tive conference loss, drop
ping its VVCAA record to 4-7.
UCLA, ranked in the na
tion's top 20 secured a
NCAA tournament birth as

its record rose to 9-4.
The Card needed more
than a pawnbroker to bail
out ot its 49-29 halftime def
icit. Despite a stronger
second-half performance
(Stanford was only out
scored 43-40), a balanced
scoreboard was out ot the
Card's reach.
A familiar face, senior
Meg Metzger, was missing
from the Card's starting
line-up. The six-foot for
ward, who is the team's cap

tain and top scorer,
watched most of the game
from the bench. Metzger is
averaging 16 points per
game but has not turned in
impressive stats or double
figures in her last five out
ings.
The Cardinal has only two
chances lett to upgrade its
first WCAA season.
Tomorrow the Card will
host 9-2 Long Beach State in
Maples Pavilion at 5:45 p.m.
