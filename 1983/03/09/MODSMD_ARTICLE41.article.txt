# Netwomen third indoors
## 
### MARK ZEIGLER 
Although its heralded winning streak was
halted at 29, Stanford's women's tennis team
finished third — a notch higher than its seeding
— at the National Indoor Championships held at
Ann Arbor, Mich., over the weekend.
Top seed USC downed No. 3 Trinity Sunday
5-4 in the competition's finals.
The Cardinal ran its season record to 9-1 by
winning three of its four matches, including a
5-4 decision Sunday over No. 2 seed and
second-ranked UCLA in the tournament that
featured eight of the nation's top 10 collegiate
teams.
But on Saturday, following a pair of 7-2 vic
tories over South Carolina and Miami, No. 1
seed and top-ranked USC dealt defending
NCAA champ Stanford its first loss of the sea
son. The 5-4 setback was also the Card's first
since the second to last match of the 1981 cam
paign.
"There was no way that it (the streak) would
keep going," Stanford coach Frank Brennan
said. "I knew we were going to lose to someone
somewhere along the line."
Saturday's match against the Trojans was not
nearly as close as the 5-4 score indicates. USC
captured five of the singles contests, four of
them in straight sets, while Stanford swept the
doubles against an abridged Trojan line-up.
Stanford rebounded Sunday against UCLA in
the third place match, hanging on to a victory
that nearly slipped out of its hands. The Card
took four of the six singles affairs from the
Bruins and had to claim just one of three dou
bles matches to seal the win.
But, as has been its custom all season, Bren
nan's troops did not take the easy road to vic
tory.
The third doubles team of Alison Hardy and
Jackie Joseph squandered a 4-1 first set lead and
went on to lose, 7-5, 7-5. At No. 2, the senior pair
of Caryn Copeland and Michelle Weiss were
beaten soundly, 6-3, 6-2, tying the match at 4-4
and leaving the contest in the hands of Elise

Burgin/Linda Gates at No. 1.
Burgin/Gates quickly won the first set 6-1 and
jumped to a 2-0 advantage in the second. How
ever, things were too easy tor the Card.
The Bruins' karin Huebnerßarbara Cerkin
charged back, winning six of the next seven
games to record a 6-3 second set decision.
In the third and deciding set, Burgin/Gates
had their backs to the wall serving at 3-5, hut held
in the ninth game and fought off a match point in
the 10th to tie it at five all. The Card's top duo
then took the final two games to prevail in the
thriller, 6-1, 3-6, 7-5.
"I thought we looked good and the other
teams look a little more human than they do on
paper," Brennan said, referring to his team's
chances against the three teams ranked higher
than his at the start of the season — USC, UCLA
and Trinity.
Stanford's No. I netter, junior Burgin, was in
fine form in Ann Arbor, Michigan, winning all
four of her singles affairs and teaming with
Gates for four more victories in doubles.
On Saturday, Burgin's 21st birthday, the Card
star recovered from a shaky start to beat USC's
Beth Herr, the No. 1 ranked women's collegiate
player at the time, 1-6, 6-3, 6-4.
"I think Elise Burgin at this point in the season
has proven herself to be the best (collegiate)
player in the country," Brennan said. "She can
win singles and doubles in every match we
plav."
Brennan said the first five singles spots and all
three doubles teams are solid at this juncture in
the season.
"I guess I'm not pleased with No. 6," he said
"We didn't get a win all week at No. 6.' Hardy
lost Thursday and Saturday at six, while Josepn
was on the short end of scores F riclay and Sun
day at Ann Arbor.
Stanford has two home 'matches, tomorrow at
1:30 p.m. against Cal-State Fullerton and March
22 against San Diego State, before taking to the
road March 23 for a three-day, three-match stint
in Southern California.

them in straight sets, while Stanford swept the
doubles against an abridged Trojan line-up.
Stanford rebounded Sunday against UCLA in
the third place match, hanging on to a victory
that nearly slipped out of its hands. The Card
took four of the six singles affairs from the
Bruins and had to claim just one of three dou
bles matches to seal the win.
But, as has been its custom all season, Bren
nan's troops did not take the easy road to vic
tory.
The third doubles team of Alison Hardy and
Jackie Joseph squandered a 4-1 first set lead and
went on to lose, 7-5, 7-5. At No. 2, the senior pair
of Caryn Copeland and Michelle Weiss were
beaten soundly, 6-3, 6-2, tying the match at 4-4
and leaving the contest in the hands of Elise

Burgin/Linda Gates at No. 1.
Burgin/Gates quickly won the first set 6-1 and
jumped to a 2-0 advantage in the second. How
ever, things were too easy tor the Card.
The Bruins' karin Huebnerßarbara Cerkin
charged back, winning six of the next seven
games to record a 6-3 second set decision.
In the third and deciding set, Burgin/Gates
had their backs to the wall serving at 3-5, hut held
in the ninth game and fought off a match point in
the 10th to tie it at five all. The Card's top duo
then took the final two games to prevail in the
thriller, 6-1, 3-6, 7-5.
"I thought we looked good and the other
teams look a little more human than they do on
paper," Brennan said, referring to his team's
chances against the three teams ranked higher
than his at the start of the season — USC, UCLA
and Trinity.
Stanford's No. I netter, junior Burgin, was in
fine form in Ann Arbor, Michigan, winning all
four of her singles affairs and teaming with
Gates for four more victories in doubles.
On Saturday, Burgin's 21st birthday, the Card
star recovered from a shaky start to beat USC's
Beth Herr, the No. 1 ranked women's collegiate
player at the time, 1-6, 6-3, 6-4.
"I think Elise Burgin at this point in the season
has proven herself to be the best (collegiate)
player in the country," Brennan said. "She can
win singles and doubles in every match we
plav."
Brennan said the first five singles spots and all
three doubles teams are solid at this juncture in
the season.
"I guess I'm not pleased with No. 6," he said
"We didn't get a win all week at No. 6.' Hardy
lost Thursday and Saturday at six, while Josepn
was on the short end of scores F riclay and Sun
day at Ann Arbor.
Stanford has two home 'matches, tomorrow at
1:30 p.m. against Cal-State Fullerton and March
22 against San Diego State, before taking to the
road March 23 for a three-day, three-match stint
in Southern California.
