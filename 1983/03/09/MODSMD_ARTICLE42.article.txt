# Sun Devils slip by Card in OT
## 
### STEVE ODELL Senior sports writer 
Tempo, Ariz. — It was three
battles in one.
It was Tom Davis vs. Bob
Weinhauer in a battle of two
first-year coaches from the
East. It was Keith Jones vs.
Byron Scott in a battle between
the two premiere guards in the
conference. Finally, it was
Stanford vs. Arizona State in a
battle of two Pacific-10 foes.
Davis clearly outcoached
and outclassed Weinhauer de
spite a depleted line-up . Jones,
playing in his hometown, and
Scott, playing in his last home
game, played to what could be
best classified as a stand-off.
But in the all-important third
confrontation, the Sun Devils
prevailed, eking out a 76-72
overtime victory Saturday
night at the ASU Activity Cen
ter.
Scott scored 32 points on
14-of-19 shooting from the
floor, grabbed 12 rebounds
and dished out six assists in
playing all but one minute.
Jones, who played at Phoenix
Union High School, fired in 23
points and passed for six assists
before fouling out with 3:47
left in overtime.
"Keith Jones ranks right up
there with the top players of
this league," Stanford coach

Tom Davis said. "I just don't
know what more we could ask
of Keith Jones. I just can't say
enough about him and how
he's just taken over after (John)
Revelli went out. Yet I need to
stay on him, because he has
the potential to get even bet
ter."
Stanford, after falling behind
by as many as 12 points, battled
back only to squander its lead
once it had worked so hard to
attain it. The Cardinal had
many chances to record its
biggest upset of the season,
but the lack of depth and play
ing on the road took its toll.
Stanford should have won a
game it clearly had no business
winning as ASU found putting
the Cardinal away an elusive
task. The Sun Devils made only
8-of-17 foul shots, including
missing some key attempts
down the stretch.
"I just feel so badly for them
to lose," Davis said of his team.
"After overcoming so many
obstacles, we just didn't play
defense and became tentative
with the ball at the end. That
comes from inexperience and
youth.
"But if we can do those
things and still come as close as
we did, then we know we've
got a good ball club. I just can't
say enough about that effort.
That in-game effort was

second-to-none. I'm really
proud of them and yet I'm not
oblivious to the weaknesses
that were exposed tonight."
The key play of the game
tame with 3:47 left in the over
time. Stanford had been
awarded possession first in the
extra period and was working
time off the clock, looking for
an opening for a good shot
within the framework of its
"Roll" offense.
Jones finally found a crack
and exploded by Chris Beasley
to the hoop, where he collided
with forward |im Deines as he
was converting a lay-up. Ref
eree Bob Garibaldi called the
bucket good, but also called a
charge on Jones, which was his
fifth personal foul.
After Jones left, the Cardinal
lacked the offensive leadership
it needed, and ASU finally
exploited his absence, forcing
four Stanford turnovers in the
final three and one-half min
utes and scoring the final six
points to record the win.
Deines missed his foul shot,
but Arizona State regained
possession when Hans
Wichary lost his dribble to De
ines and fouled him trying to
get the ball back. Deines mis
sed again, but Keith Ramee
drove inside on the Cardinal's
ensuing possession and mis
fired on a crucial lay-up at

tempt.
Then Scott put the finishing
touches onto his already
superb performance, scoring
four foul shots to ice the win in
the Land of the Sun.
The Cardinal, like in its pre
vious game, a 69-68 loss to
Arizona, had a chance to win at
the end of regulation. Stanford
called a time-out with five sec
onds left and the score tied at
70-70.
Earl Koberlein inbounded in
the backcourt to Ramee, who
dribbled upcourt and fired a
pass to Steve Brown, whose
24-foot jump shot from the
right corner at the buzzer rim
med out, sending the game
into the five-minute overtime.
"That was something like we
were looking for," Davis said.
"You can't be too choosy with
five seconds left. We were
looking to inbound to either
Ramee or Jones, and then have
either Brown or Jones get the
final shot. That was a fine shot.
Steve is a good shooter from
that distance."
Stanford got its first lead
since the opening minutes
with just 1:29 left in regulation
after Jones stole a hand-off at
tempt from Walt Stone to
Scott, drove the length of the
floor and laid it in to give the
Cardinal a 67-66 advantage.

Tempo, Ariz. — It was three
battles in one.
It was Tom Davis vs. Bob
Weinhauer in a battle of two
first-year coaches from the
East. It was Keith Jones vs.
Byron Scott in a battle between
the two premiere guards in the
conference. Finally, it was
Stanford vs. Arizona State in a
battle of two Pacific-10 foes.
Davis clearly outcoached
and outclassed Weinhauer de
spite a depleted line-up . Jones,
playing in his hometown, and
Scott, playing in his last home
game, played to what could be
best classified as a stand-off.
But in the all-important third
confrontation, the Sun Devils
prevailed, eking out a 76-72
overtime victory Saturday
night at the ASU Activity Cen
ter.
Scott scored 32 points on
14-of-19 shooting from the
floor, grabbed 12 rebounds
and dished out six assists in
playing all but one minute.
Jones, who played at Phoenix
Union High School, fired in 23
points and passed for six assists
before fouling out with 3:47
left in overtime.
"Keith Jones ranks right up
there with the top players of
this league," Stanford coach

Tom Davis said. "I just don't
know what more we could ask
of Keith Jones. I just can't say
enough about him and how
he's just taken over after (John)
Revelli went out. Yet I need to
stay on him, because he has
the potential to get even bet
ter."
Stanford, after falling behind
by as many as 12 points, battled
back only to squander its lead
once it had worked so hard to
attain it. The Cardinal had
many chances to record its
biggest upset of the season,
but the lack of depth and play
ing on the road took its toll.
Stanford should have won a
game it clearly had no business
winning as ASU found putting
the Cardinal away an elusive
task. The Sun Devils made only
8-of-17 foul shots, including
missing some key attempts
down the stretch.
"I just feel so badly for them
to lose," Davis said of his team.
"After overcoming so many
obstacles, we just didn't play
defense and became tentative
with the ball at the end. That
comes from inexperience and
youth.
"But if we can do those
things and still come as close as
we did, then we know we've
got a good ball club. I just can't
say enough about that effort.
That in-game effort was

second-to-none. I'm really
proud of them and yet I'm not
oblivious to the weaknesses
that were exposed tonight."
The key play of the game
tame with 3:47 left in the over
time. Stanford had been
awarded possession first in the
extra period and was working
time off the clock, looking for
an opening for a good shot
within the framework of its
"Roll" offense.
Jones finally found a crack
and exploded by Chris Beasley
to the hoop, where he collided
with forward |im Deines as he
was converting a lay-up. Ref
eree Bob Garibaldi called the
bucket good, but also called a
charge on Jones, which was his
fifth personal foul.
After Jones left, the Cardinal
lacked the offensive leadership
it needed, and ASU finally
exploited his absence, forcing
four Stanford turnovers in the
final three and one-half min
utes and scoring the final six
points to record the win.
Deines missed his foul shot,
but Arizona State regained
possession when Hans
Wichary lost his dribble to De
ines and fouled him trying to
get the ball back. Deines mis
sed again, but Keith Ramee
drove inside on the Cardinal's
ensuing possession and mis
fired on a crucial lay-up at

tempt.
Then Scott put the finishing
touches onto his already
superb performance, scoring
four foul shots to ice the win in
the Land of the Sun.
The Cardinal, like in its pre
vious game, a 69-68 loss to
Arizona, had a chance to win at
the end of regulation. Stanford
called a time-out with five sec
onds left and the score tied at
70-70.
Earl Koberlein inbounded in
the backcourt to Ramee, who
dribbled upcourt and fired a
pass to Steve Brown, whose
24-foot jump shot from the
right corner at the buzzer rim
med out, sending the game
into the five-minute overtime.
"That was something like we
were looking for," Davis said.
"You can't be too choosy with
five seconds left. We were
looking to inbound to either
Ramee or Jones, and then have
either Brown or Jones get the
final shot. That was a fine shot.
Steve is a good shooter from
that distance."
Stanford got its first lead
since the opening minutes
with just 1:29 left in regulation
after Jones stole a hand-off at
tempt from Walt Stone to
Scott, drove the length of the
floor and laid it in to give the
Cardinal a 67-66 advantage.
