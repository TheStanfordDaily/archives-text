# Card aims for .500 season
## 
### STEVE ODELL Senior sports writer 
Though a play-off posi
tion is out of the question
following losses in six of its
last seven games, there is
still a lot on the line when
Stanford hosts Oregon and
Oregon State in Pacific-10
conference games this
weekend.
Stanford can salvage its
first winning season in 10
years with a sweep of the
Oregon schools, while a
split would enable the Car
dinal to record its first 500
season in that same time

period. And first-year Car
dinal coach Tom Davis has
never had a losing season at
the collegiate level.
Stanford faces the Ducks
tomorrow night and OSU
Saturday night, with both
games starting at 8 p.m. in
Maples Pavilion.
The Bay Area trip repre
sents the last pair of games
for UO coach )im Haney,
who last week announced
his resignation effective at
the end of the season.
Haney had been the Duck
coach the past five seasons,
and has never achieved a

winning record. UO is 8-17
overall and 4-12 in the con
ference.
Haney has weathered
much tribulation while at
the helm, and the Ducks will
be emotionally high to win
one for their outgoing
coach. They are coming off
a last-second 62-60 loss to
Oregon State, a game in
which they clearly played
well enough to win.
The Ducks are seen as a
team a year or two "away."
