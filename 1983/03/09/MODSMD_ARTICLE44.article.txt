## Weinhauer wins and whines 
### 
Tempo, Ariz. — The world
has it in for Boh Weinhauer.
Just ask him.
Weinhauer (or is it
Whinehauer) paced the
sidelines Saturday night as
his Arizona State Sun Devils
squeaked past what was left
of a Stanford basketball
team. And just in case they
didn't win Whinehauer was
going to know why.
There was a rpason for
everything, except why
Stanford is allowed to grace
the same court as
Whinehauer's Sun Devils.
"In all honesty, their
(Stanford's) offense is a
joke," Whinehauer said. "I
don't know what they're
doing with it other than
throwing bounce passes in
the lane, walking and charg
ing."
Presumably, that is how
Stanford competes with
God's gift — they cheat.
''It's a travesty,''
Whinehauer continued.
"They (the referees) let
them do three things all the
time and get away with it.
"They walk (travel), they
charge and they push un
derneath. That's up to the
supervisor of officials to
make sure those things
don't happen."
Arizona State appeared to
have won the game because
Byron Scott scored 32 points
and grabbed 12 rebounds in
probably the best job of of
fensive rebounding the
conference has seen all
year.
But short-handed Stan
ford put on a brave effort —
an effort not acknowledged
by Whinehauer.
"They play end-to-end for
40 minutes every game,"
Whinehauer said. "They
probably got eight to 10
points off their press, but
we probably got 30. Any
time anybody wants to trade
10 for 30, we'll take it."
The rag-tag Stanford
bunch did play end-to-end
— from one end of the
bench to the other and be-

yond.
John ReveHi, David
Nussbaum, Ric ky Lewis and
Roger Lemons are out for
the season with injuries,
Andy Fischer missed the
game because a family
member was ill, and Keith
Jones and Hans Wichary
fouled out in overtime of
the 76-72 loss.

"Our bench is now our
starters and our gray team
(Stanford's sub varsity) is
our bench," Davis said.
"We have three walk-ons in
our top eight guys and we're
playing pretty good calibre
basketball.
"I can't say enough about
their effort. We're stressing
that we have to have that
kind of effort every day. Our
end-game effort is second
to none. I'll put these guys
against anyone at the end of
a game."
The overtime excitement
blurred the drama of Stan
ford's comeback in regula
tion. Stanford trailed by as
many as 12, but fought back
and had a chance to win.
Steve Brown's baseline
jump shot at the buzzer
barely missed.

There was a reason for the
comeback and it had noth
ing to do with Stanford's ef
fort. The world has it in for
Bob Whinehauer. Just ask
him.
"We had complete con
trol of the game and then
made mistakes,''
Whinehauer said. "It's hap
pened too many times."
Arizona State was running
scared, or so it seemed
when they botched a suc
cession of free throws that
would have sent the Cardi
nal back to the foothills
without so much as a
chance.
But Arizona State's rim
was broken. It was bent, just
ask Bob Whinehauer. That's
why they missed 9-of-17 free
throws. His players
wouldn't miss free throws,
it was the rim's fault.
Whinehauer talks like a
man who is scared. But his
insecurity is unexplanable
according to Davis, who had
nothing but kind words for
Whinehauer, the Sun Devils
and the Valley of the Sun.
"I'm disappointed (when
told of Whinehauer's com
ment that 'Stanford's of
fense is a joke'), but I won't
comment further," Davis
said. "I thought he did a fine
coaching job and the pro
gram is doing well. The
people here have been very
hospitable so I wouldn't
want to say anything
further."
Whinehauer is a good
coach and he has instilled a
source of legitimacy to the
Arizona State basketball
program, leading the Sun
Devils to a 11-5 conference
record, a 17-12 overall re
cord and slight chance at a
post-season tournament
berth.
But Whinehauer is run
ning scared. The world has
it in for him. Only if he can
keep from looking over his
shoulder can he see the
team that has the potential
to pull some surprises in
post-season play.

But short-handed Stan
ford put on a brave effort —
an effort not acknowledged
by Whinehauer.
"They play end-to-end for
40 minutes every game,"
Whinehauer said. "They
probably got eight to 10
points off their press, but
we probably got 30. Any
time anybody wants to trade
10 for 30, we'll take it."
The rag-tag Stanford
bunch did play end-to-end
— from one end of the
bench to the other and be-

yond.
John ReveHi, David
Nussbaum, Ric ky Lewis and
Roger Lemons are out for
the season with injuries,
Andy Fischer missed the
game because a family
member was ill, and Keith
Jones and Hans Wichary
fouled out in overtime of
the 76-72 loss.

"Our bench is now our
starters and our gray team
(Stanford's sub varsity) is
our bench," Davis said.
"We have three walk-ons in
our top eight guys and we're
playing pretty good calibre
basketball.
"I can't say enough about
their effort. We're stressing
that we have to have that
kind of effort every day. Our
end-game effort is second
to none. I'll put these guys
against anyone at the end of
a game."
The overtime excitement
blurred the drama of Stan
ford's comeback in regula
tion. Stanford trailed by as
many as 12, but fought back
and had a chance to win.
Steve Brown's baseline
jump shot at the buzzer
barely missed.

There was a reason for the
comeback and it had noth
ing to do with Stanford's ef
fort. The world has it in for
Bob Whinehauer. Just ask
him.
"We had complete con
trol of the game and then
made mistakes,''
Whinehauer said. "It's hap
pened too many times."
Arizona State was running
scared, or so it seemed
when they botched a suc
cession of free throws that
would have sent the Cardi
nal back to the foothills
without so much as a
chance.
But Arizona State's rim
was broken. It was bent, just
ask Bob Whinehauer. That's
why they missed 9-of-17 free
throws. His players
wouldn't miss free throws,
it was the rim's fault.
Whinehauer talks like a
man who is scared. But his
insecurity is unexplanable
according to Davis, who had
nothing but kind words for
Whinehauer, the Sun Devils
and the Valley of the Sun.
"I'm disappointed (when
told of Whinehauer's com
ment that 'Stanford's of
fense is a joke'), but I won't
comment further," Davis
said. "I thought he did a fine
coaching job and the pro
gram is doing well. The
people here have been very
hospitable so I wouldn't
want to say anything
further."
Whinehauer is a good
coach and he has instilled a
source of legitimacy to the
Arizona State basketball
program, leading the Sun
Devils to a 11-5 conference
record, a 17-12 overall re
cord and slight chance at a
post-season tournament
berth.
But Whinehauer is run
ning scared. The world has
it in for him. Only if he can
keep from looking over his
shoulder can he see the
team that has the potential
to pull some surprises in
post-season play.


Bob Weinhauer
Tempo, Ariz. — The world
has it in for Boh Weinhauer.
Just ask him.
Weinhauer (or is it
Whinehauer) paced the
sidelines Saturday night as
his Arizona State Sun Devils
squeaked past what was left
of a Stanford basketball
team. And just in case they
didn't win Whinehauer was
going to know why.
There was a rpason for
everything, except why
Stanford is allowed to grace
the same court as
Whinehauer's Sun Devils.
"In all honesty, their
(Stanford's) offense is a
joke," Whinehauer said. "I
don't know what they're
doing with it other than
throwing bounce passes in
the lane, walking and charg
ing."
Presumably, that is how
Stanford competes with
God's gift — they cheat.
''It's a travesty,''
Whinehauer continued.
"They (the referees) let
them do three things all the
time and get away with it.
"They walk (travel), they
charge and they push un
derneath. That's up to the
supervisor of officials to
make sure those things
don't happen."
Arizona State appeared to
have won the game because
Byron Scott scored 32 points
and grabbed 12 rebounds in
probably the best job of of
fensive rebounding the
conference has seen all
year.
But short-handed Stan
ford put on a brave effort —
an effort not acknowledged
by Whinehauer.
"They play end-to-end for
40 minutes every game,"
Whinehauer said. "They
probably got eight to 10
