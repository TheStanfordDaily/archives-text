Freshman |ohn Levy scored
his life-time best mark in a
five-team gymnastics meet at
Berkeley on Saturday, leading
the Cardinal to a first-place
finish.
Levy defeated the nation's
I2th-ranked gymnast, Billy
Paul, in winning the all-around
competition with an astound
ing 55.65 out of a possible 60
points.
Stanford won the meet with
268.35, barely slipping past
Houston Baptist University's
268.10. Cal was third in the
meet with 264.95, tollowed by
UC-Davis and Athletics in Ac
tion.
For Stanford, beating Hous
ton Baptist was a telling victory.
Houston is ranked eighth in

the nation, yet they come from
a region where the judges
score gymnasts more gener
ously than those in northern
California.
Since the national ranking
are compiled on a basis of scor
ing, the teams from areas with
less rigorous judging have an
advantage in attending the
NCAA championships.
I he meet was extremely
close, with all three teams log
ging a score of 222 after five
events. With one more event
to go, Stanford scored an
amazinu 46.70 on the vault.
With the clutch victory this
weekend, Stanford still has a
chance to attend the NCAA
championships in April.
The Pacific-10 championship
meet will be held here at Stan
ford in two weeks.
