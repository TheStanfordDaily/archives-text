# Ruark Hoff: athlete, student, wife
## 
### LIBBY LEONARD 
Stanford newlywed Joanne Ruark Hoff is
unlike most married women who seek
employment outside the home. Hoff goes
to work on a basketball court.
The 23-year-old senior will end her star
studded collegiate career Saturday in the
Cardinal's final game against USC .
"I consider Jeanne to be one of the cor
nerstones of the Stanford women's bas
ketball program," said Cardinal coach
Dotty McCrea.
Hoff is the first woman in Stanford's his
tory to tally more than 2000 points. The
powerful forward has a devastating
jumpshot from up to 20 feet.
"Shooting definitely is my forte. I'm not
a great defensive player," Hoft said.
1 he hard-working Hoff not only likes to
shoot, she sinks jumpers and free throws
with incredible accuracy. Hoff hit 59 per
cent from the floor this season and her 88
percent clip from the toul line was tops in
the WCAA. Last month, Hoff was named
WCAA Athlete of the Week for her consis
tent play.
When Hoff leaves Stanford, her name
will remain in the record books. She holds
single-game records for most points (42),
most field goals (20), most foul shots (15)
and best free throw percentage (10 of 10).
"Scoring 2000 points is a neat landmark
that will probably stand tor a long time,"
Hoff said. "However, I think a lot of my
other records will be broken in the next
few years."
Following the advice of peers, Hoff de
cided to pick up a basketball in the eighth
grade. "I was tall and people kept telling
me I should be playing the game," she
recalled.
Hoff said her family never pushed her
into the sport, though. "My father played
basketball, but he was in the Air Force so
he wasn't home much to work with me,"
she explained.
Floff first blossomed as a player during
her sophomore year af Jefferson Davis
High School in Montgomery, Ala. She
went on to lead her prep team to a pair of

state titles.
Although several Atlantic Coast s< hools
recruited the All-American, coming to
Stanford was an easy decision. "I was look
ing for a good education," she said. If I
just wanted to play basketball. I would
have stayed in the South."
Hoff has found success in the class
room, as well as on the court. She is a
Human Biology major who plans to pursue
a career in exercise physiology. Graduate
school is on her mind, but "I'm burned out
right now," she admitted. "I need to take a
break from school and work for a year or
so."
Hoff also has aspirations of coaching
basketball at the junior high level. "I really
enjoy working with kids that age. You can
teach them fundamentals and make their
transition into high school easier," she
said.
After Hoff hangs up her hightops, she
will have more time to juggle being a wife
and a student. Basketball has taught Hott
how to manage her time and play two
different roles since her 1980 marriage.
Hoff literally fell for her husband, John
Hoff, during her freshman year. "He or
ganized a skydiving trip with a group from
Soto, and (hat's how we first met," she
explained.
Although married life required certain
compromises, "We both have adjusted to
my schedule," she said. "I'd be a wreck
if I had to clean the apartment, do the
laundry, and all the other household
duties," joked Hoff. Instead, the couple
takes turns doing these tasks. "I do all the
cooking, though, because I enjoy it. Pre
paring a good meal is like a study break for
me."
Basketball has not interfered with her
marriage, claimed Hoff. In fact, she stop
ped out and redshirted the 1890-81 season
to be with her husband who was doing
graduate work in Indiana.
Initially, Hoff intended to stay at Stan
ford and live apart from her husband that
year. But her plans quickly changed. "Af
ter two weeks of living in a single dorm

room, I knew that I wanted and needed to
be with my husband," she said
Hoff worked during her year off and
scrimmaged with men at nearby Purdue.
She also participated on an AAU women's
basketball team to keep in top shape. "I
played a lot of one-on-one with )ohn,"
noted Hott. "Since he's quicker, I was
forced to go up strong and learn to fake
better."
Upon returning to Stanford last year,
Hoff not only had a new surname but also a
new role on the team. "For the first two
seasons, I was the offense (Hoff averaged
over 20 ppg)," she explained. "In my ab
sence, a lot of players developed into of
fensive threats, so I had to find my niche
on the team. ' The Cardinal's scoring load
no longer rests exclusively with Hoff who
is now averaging 13.5 points a contest.

Hoff literally fell for her
husband, John Hoff, during
her freshman year. 'He
organized a skydiving trip
with a group from Soto, and
that's how we first met/ she
explained.

When Hoff isn't shooting baskets,
studying or cooking, she likes to play the
guitar and run long distance. "Someday,
I'd like to run in a marathon," she said.
As Hoff reflected on her athletic career,
she commented on how much women's
basketball has grown and improved.
"Maybe in 10years or so, women will even
draw crowds like men," Hoff noted.
Although Hoff usually plays before small
crowds in Maples Pavilion, she does have
at least one faithtul fan â€” her husband.
")ohn is really supportive. He comes to
all my games, and I never have trouble
spotting him in the stands."
