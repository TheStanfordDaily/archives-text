# Board approves budget guidelines
## 
### HEATHER MILLAR 
The board of trustees yesterday approved budget
guidelines recommending "gap-closing" cuts of 1.9
percent in the proposed base operating budget for
198 J 84. The cuts will mean less-than-antic ipated growth
in University administration and services, while the
academic sector will remain relatively untouched.
T his latest proposal for reduction in growth marks the
second stage of a projected four-year cycle of belt
tightening required because of a decrease in research
volume and indirect cost recovery — federal subsidiza
tion of overhead incurred by government-funded proj
ects. This is the first battery of organized cuts in almost a
decade.
The first stage began with the 1982-83 budget, which
sustained a 1 percent across-the-board c ut, and the next
two stages will implement a decrease ot 5 percent. The
last stage of the cycle has been designated for "clean
up."
If the guideline figures are not changed before the
budget is finalized next October, the 1983-84 operating
budget will actually increase by 7.9 percent. But com
pared with increases of 16.3 percent and 14.5 percent in
the last two years, this figure is down significantly.
"You d like to have your strawberries with whipped
cream, but sometimes you just can't have them,' said
Provost Albert Hastorf. Hastorf added that while the
situation is not ideal, it forces the University to make
priority judgments, which may he 1 beneficial in the
long-run.
"I think the major highlight of this budget is that we've
brought down the rate of real growth, especially in com
parison with last year," said Timothy Warner, associate
provost. "It will probably continue to go down in the
future with regard to inflation and federal cuts."
Trustee reaction to the guideline report was positive
and many labelled the cuts as "fair and conservative,
probably because the budget has already been dis
cussed extensively in trustee committees.
"It's not the first time. We're sort of getting used to it
really," said William kimball, president of the board of

trustees. "As long as it's done fairly. . .
The University had made a conscious decision to
target administrative and maintenance functions in
order to spare the academic sector from the hrunt of the
fiscal strain, according to Provost Albert Hastorf. Of the
100 to 120 "gap-dosing" measures proposed, more than
80 percent were made in these areas.
"No question about it, the cutting is not balanced,"
said Hastorf. "But the business we're in is academic and
that's what we're trying to protect."
The president's and provost's offices will take a 5 per
cent cut and there will be fairly large cuts in University
maintenance operations. Campus mail will be delivered
once rather than twice daily, and litter pickup around
campus will be reduced.
The academic sector — professors and research proj
ects — will remain relatively untouched except for a
freeze on some professorial searches in the School of
Humanities and Sciences (H&S) and reduced real
growth in taculty salaries. Funds for temporarily replac
ing H&S taculty members on sabbatical will be cut back.
The Medical School is also expected to sustain some
hefty cuts, but these are not finalized.
Administrators insist that the resulting reductions in
staff will come about as a result of attrition and retire
ment and say they expect no layoffs. Because it is impos
sible to predict all resignations, the effects of these
freezes will be random, according to Frank Rattjs, di
rector of management and finance planning.
Officials at all levels reiterate that the aid-blind admis
sions policy is not being questioned nor is it being cut.
Largely due to decreases in state and federal aid, the
University is actually increasing its contribution to finan
cial aid by 18.5 percent over last year.
"Fath year that the federal or state government con
tribution to financial aid stays flat or decreases, it puts a
greater strain on Stanford. So that base drawn from
unrestricted tunds will continue to grow," Warner said.
The guideline's long range forecast predicts light at
the end ot this fiscal tunnel. "It we can get through the
next year, then we are bound for an upturn," said
Warner.

hefty cuts, but these are not finalized.
Administrators insist that the resulting reductions in
staff will come about as a result of attrition and retire

Largely due to decreases in state and federal aid, the
University is actually increasing its contribution to finan
cial aid by 18.5 percent over last year.

greater strain on Stanford. So that base drawn from
unrestricted tunds will continue to grow," Warner said.
The guideline's long range forecast predicts light at
