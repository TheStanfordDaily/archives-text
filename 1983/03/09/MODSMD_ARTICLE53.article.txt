## Fallout from the price wars 
### CHRIS BUTCHKO 
There's a new creature stalking the shelves of our
record stores: Some say it's the bastard child of a fleet
ing romance between the twelve-inch single and the EP,
some claim it to be the idiot child of an incestuous
coupling of the LP and the single; whatever its origin, it's
called the "mini-LP," and I hope it isn't here to stay.
What's your preference? Do you like singles because
albums are too costly? Do you like albums because sing
les have too little music? The mini-LP is the perfect com
promise: the worse of both worlds with an added debit.
A mini-LP goes for about $5 and change and those of us
old enough to remember (eleven years and up) can
recall the day when you used to get a whole LP for that
price.
On it you get some five songs, two and-a-half singles
for about the same price. There's something else,
though, and that's the fear that the mini-LP might be
taking the place of a full album — a play-it-safe gambit by
the record companies that'll work wonders toward cut
ting out wasteful diversity on the record market.
To put it baldly, these things cost too much for what
they should be — a sort of Whitman's sampler of music
from a new group or odds and ends from established
bands. It takes quite a bit of rationalization for some
body to buy one of these things, and that's hardly the
way to try to sell records.
Despite however much I may whine about the format,
it is content that matters, so without further ado . . .
La Bomba
Tonio K.
Columbia Records
Nobody ever said you have to be smart to make hit
records (see Strummer, Joe) and there is a certain school
of thought that holds that intelligence is a handicap —
forthwith we turn to Tonio K.
PeteTownshend is rock's resident intellectual, mainly
because he's one of the few to sound self-conscious
about his "place" and his "role." All very well and good
— the germinal awareness he showed on songs like
"The Kids are Alright" is a quantum leap from "Rock
Around the Clock."
Tonio K., on the other hand, has gone so far to the
extreme as to dedicate three songs on one of his albums
to Dadaist artists and such household names as "collage
pioneer" Kurt Schwitters.
Very slick on the surface — name your band by refer
ence to Frank Kafka and drop a lot of obscure names.
With that kind of image, neither "intellectual" or "rock
star" spring out as characterizations, but rather
"poseur." That's wrong — Tonio K. cannot be dismissed
like that, his music is neither so shallow nor so self
indulgent. Sadly, however, those aren't the things one's
first impressions of this mini-LP are going to bring out.
The cover is done in a very cutesy style, and the anti
nuclear theme is both damnably heavy-handed and
hideously trendy. Worse, the title song, "La Bomba," is
little more than a novelty song, a reworking of the old
Spanish-language hit of the same name.
For all intents, then, the album starts on the second
side, with the title song and "Mars Needs Women,"
which are the only songs for which Tonio K. claims sole
writing credit. (How it works out that he gets credit for
both words and music to "La Bomba" is a mystery, but
not a highly interesting one.) It's very professionally
done, as a song: The production is seamless, the playing
tight, but there just doesn't seem to be very much heart
to it. Tonio K. sings expressively, to be sure, but the song
remains a showpiece, to all the world an inanimate ob
ject.
"Mars Needs Women" is little better, another break
up song in his tradition of "Go Away" from the Amerika
album. With a drum pattern "by way of Bo Diddley" and
a few quotes borrowed from Proverbs, this Ray
Bradbury-inspired tune is almost the ultimate amalgam.
Tonio K. drawls the lyrics out nicely and uses sustain on
the notes well, but, again, it just doesn't seem too in
spired.
Pretty grim so far, eh? It's worse in description than in
fact — side two isn't bad, just disappointing. Side one,
however shows atavistic life.
The side starts with "Fools Talk," a nicely misan
thropic song about how there are "opinionated idiots in
charge of everything." Like most of his songs, this one is
hung on a five or six note theme, and the music is largely
there just so the songs won't be a capella. The lyrics —
and the delivery of them — are excellent. Counting off
the distractions, Tonio K. trippingly recites "You got
clanging cymbals, you got noisy gong/ you got primitive
rhythms, you got protest songs." Moving from delivery N
to meaning, we get a nice piece of irony in the following
"I've been quiet — I've been tryin' to listen/ I've been
listening good/ But so what? So what? So what have I
found out?/ How can I say it wordlessly?/ and why am I
asking you?"
"Politician," the next song, is an oldie from '68, largely
interesting as an early example of distrust in our elected
officials. The song is led by the bass with a scratchy guitar
line, and there's not much else to it. Tonio K. does a nice
job posing as a singer walking around the upper limit of
his vocal range, but beyond that it's unexceptional.
The high point of the mini-LP is "The New Dark Ages,"
which starts "Darlin', it's a hard life if you're lucky/ Ah,
but it's a short life if you're not." The song tells of the
gangsters' ruling everyday life, gangsters on TV,
"gangsters on the couch and on the lawn." The music is
again unexceptional; in places it bears an uncomforta
ble resemblance to everything else on the album, and
one gets the feeling these songs were recorded in a very
short space of time. Still, it's on the song that the music
fits best.
Carrying out the message of "Wise up: welcome to
the new Dark Ages" Tonio K. breaks out to give this
uncharacteristic hopeful stanza: "You can face it now or
face it later/ You will have to face it either way ... it isn't
up to me, and it isn't up to you/ False is false and true is
true/ Only one thing we can do/ Shine the light into these
new Dark Ages!" The song is sometimes bombastic and
a little preachy, but it is very powerful and as good as
anything he's done before. (Take my word for it: that's

high praise.)
Therein lies an odd paradox. None of the songs on
side one are his solo work — yet they come closest to
what he has done before. Unless the earlier credits were
totally fraudulent, Tonio K. has changed his entire band
since the last two albums, and where the least link exists
to the past exists the greatest resemblance comes out.
Weird.
This "mini-LP" is very good. It's also a good sign that
Tonio K. has landed with a label like Columbia — al
though if this is an indication of how they plan to market
him, there are some grim times ahead. No more "La
Bombas," more "New Dark Ages" if you please, and on
to the next record.
The Bitterest Pill
The Jam
Polydor Records
If I can believe what I read, Paul Weller is breaking up
the Jam so he can record with a fuller outfit, "possibly
something with strings." That's bad news for fans of
good three-piece bands but — based on what was heard
on their last LP, The Gift, — let's hope it isn't bad news
for fans of the full orchestra.
The Gift, the Jam's last album, showed the tension in
the band. Poorly conceived horn arrangements and
overall bad integration of new instruments meddled the
sound of the album, and it's not hard to see how that
tension would quicken or even bring about the band's
demise.
After that semihysterical attempt to change the sound
of the band, Dig the New Breed, an ironically titled
break-up album, was released as a sort of farewell. To my
ears that poorly recorded and oddly selected
hodgepodge of songs seemed as if it was Paul Weller's
justification for leaving the band. "You didn't like the
instrumentation on The Gift? Well, look, here's how
terrible we sound live! Now you see why I'm getting
out?"
I don't know exactly where "The Bitterest Pill" fits in
chronologically, but for the sake of my thesis I'll take it to
be the Jam's Abbey Road, done after the break-up was
official and given to their fans as a farewell gift. On this
"mini-LP" it seems doubly sad that the Jam broke up,
for, on the title song at least, it sounds like they've
achieved as good a union as possible between a very
talented three piece band and fuller instrumentation.
"The Bitterest Pill" starts off with just the three parts of
guitar, bass, and drums, and then a female singer and a
string section drift in. Jenny McKeown's singing adds a
nice counterpoint to Weller's voice, and the strings fit in
well: they're neither saccharine nor larychmose. (Some
may argue that the strings do not play a prominent role
in the song nor do they merit the term fuller orchestra
tion. This can either be interpreted as a comment on the
delicate balance achieved and the effect given or else a
subtle indication of my views of the relative importance
of full orchestration in rock music. You decide.)
By way of copping out, I should mention that Weller
sings the song very well. So well, in fact, that he delivers
the message of heartbreak so eloquently with his intona
tion that it would be pointless to quote any of the lyrics
to the song, were it even possible to distinguish as many
as five consecutive words in his highly British delivery.
All I can tell you is that some girl gets married and Weller
feels so bad about it that he sometimes goes into
falsetto. I'm sorry I can't tell you more, but at critic
school I majored in Elvis Costello interpretation, and am
at a loss around Weller.
"Pity Poor Alfie/ Fever" is a two part composition, half
' by Weller and half the old hit by Davenport and Cooley.
Here we're given a song with a prominent horn section
but still the song mostly rides on Bruce Foxton's bass. In
the middle there's a break for a solo by what I believe to
be a rather buzzy alto sax, although with today's
technology it could be a snare drum for all I know.
"Alfie" follows a day in the life of another of Weller's
alter egos, and is not a standout song except in that it
reminds me that Weller can sing a snarl better than
anyone in music, up to and including Johnny Lydon.
At the end of "Alfie" the bass and horns go into a two
bar run, and then a crescendo, and then into "Fever."
This is very well done, both the segue and the song
itself: Weller sings soulfully, the band plays crisply, and
the goddamned pseudo-alto sax is back with some nifty
runs. It's a good trick, and a nice reminder that this is the
band that broke unto the scene with a very hot version of
"Heat Wave." Lest we forget . . .
The other side leads off with "the Great Depression,"
a totally execrable song that sounds like it had been left
off of The Gift because of space limitations. If you liked
The Gift, you'll like this song, too. All yours and wel
come to it.
The last word on the mini-LP' and possibly the last
word from the Jam is another cover song, this time the
oldie "War." If it is a farewell, it's as good as any. The
song itself is good, and Weller does an exemplary vocal
job, barking out the familiar "War — huh! What is it
good for?" in a whisper — "absolutely" a shout "NOTH
ING!" As a drill sergeant, Weller adds force to the song,
but in the whispers and asides he makes it almost
meanacing.
In one part in particular, where he sings "War don't
bring life — it can only take it away!" he almost seems
like he's going to burst out of the song in rage, but the
moment slips away and the chorus slips in. Maybe it
would have been nice to go out with some re-write of
"Eton Rifles" or "Little Boy Soldiers" but this is well done
and maybe a good pointer to Weller's influences.
"The Bitterest Pill" mini-LP definitely has its high
points, and for that reason one can't be too happy about
it or get too excited over it. After all, it's a tombstone to
the band's career, and not a milestone in it. The band is
obscure in the United States — just try to find a copy of
All Mod Cons anywhere — but it was very big in England.
To walk away from the popularity they had there must
have been a big rift in the band, and therefore it doesn't
look like there'll be a reunion. What a wonderful year for
music — The Who, Squeeze, and the Jam break up and
Toto wins the Grammys.

Special
Robert Ellis Orrall
RCA Records
RCA, home of some of rock's biggest, or at least one of
rock's longest, names, has come out with a big campaign
to back Robert Ellis Orrall. Gushing press kits claim him
to be the natural heir of every big act and every critic's
darling of the last ten years. With such a high powered
campaign, how can he fail?
Before answering that question, I'd like to say a few
words about the cover of this mini-LP. I hope you all
have had a chance to see it full-size, in color, as it surely
loses something in anything less than its natural state.
When I first saw this album I thought it was some kind of
hoax. Such a sad individual, head bowed, lined in
white and captured in soft focus — how hard his life
must be! And the title! "Special Pain"! Let's hear it,
now: Aawwww! Poor guy!
Come on, RCA! Maybe the last big act you guys had
was Mario Lanza or something, but there is no way this
guy is going to be taken seriously with packaging like
that. "It is to laugh," as Maurice Chevalier might say.
Okay, now let's put the cover aside. This is a new
talent, has probably nothing to say about how the record
looks. Let's see what kind of songs this guy writes, this
individual who the press sheets describe as a brilliant
lyricist, another Elvis Costello (They do! Honest!)
From "Tell Me if it Hurts," the centerpiece of the
album: "When the love's too strong and you think
you're gonna fall/you gotta tell me if it hurts/ Do you feel
afraid?/ Does it worry you at all? Is it that special pain?/
The kind we suffer deep inside. . . . The pain that's
never satisfied. . . ." Okay.
How about the music, though? Can this guy write
music? Well, yes, kinda. "Tell me if it Hurts" is a grabber,
a real catchy pop song. The song is grandiose, in the
successful Phil Collins/Genesis style, and Orrall has a
powerful voice that cuts through the song and carries
well. Still, there's a bit of overproduction, as if they
pulled out all the stops; that is, pushed in all the studio
gimmicks they had at their disposal. Sometimes these
things swamp the song, but by and large if anything has
to be top 40, I'd just as soon have this as anything else
that's likely to get there.
Next up is the aptly titled "Senseless," which is about
urban violence and is one of the most awkwardly
phrased songs I've ever heard. High melodramatic, this
song also has the unfortunate side effect of bringing out
Orrall's unfortunate vocal resemblance to comedian
Robert Klien. I feel kind of sorry for this guy: All sorts of
circumstances seem to be teaming up to make him look
like a goon. Notable line from "Senseless": "You wear
the medals so you must be the hero/ you're like a rose

without petals/ just a prick and a zero."
Last on that side is the most obvious Costello echo,
"(You've Had) Too Much to Think." Beyond that highly
clever title is some mildly clever rhyming wordplay and
the weird "Dr. Luthor's Assistant" slowdown music.
There's a fine line here, between the cleverness that
pleases and that which annoys. Costello got hammered
for facile rhyming and cleverness for its own sake on
Armed Forces; it's that kind of cleverness that makes up
most of this song.
Still, it's a pretty good song, wavering as it does from
Costello to Nylon Curtain Billy Joel. There's an
effective/affective moment when he sings "You say I
don't read you/Spell it Out and I won't need to!" It's the
best song on the disc, but there's still the question of
whether it would be better placed as an A-side or the
capping tune to an album. Based on the last two songs,
the best question now is what to put on the B-side.
"I Couldn't Say No," a duet with Carlene Carter, is
nearly as bad as "Facts and Figures," the following song.
Therefore, it you buy the album under no circumstances
are you to flip it over — repeat — under no circum
stances are you to flip it over! This is not a test!
The first song is hideous, whiny singles-life song. Or
rall begs Carter not to walk out on him into a musically
cued honkey-tonk world. The way they switch parts back
and forth and the sanctimonious cliches they spout is
enough to drive one screaming into the street. She's
going out "where it feels alright" because he won't let
her see "the man behind the mask" — he knows that
she's "not just another girl" although he "thought I'd
walk away from you someday." Boy, does he get his
come-uppance!
To use a popular expression, "gag me with a phillips
head screwdriver."
Even worse is "Facts and Figures," a song about how
mean men are to women. A woman gets raped, and then
in the police station the examining Lieutenant decides
that she's lying and get the urge to put the make on her,
then gets upset because she's not in the mood to put
out. The song is a bit heavy-handed, you might say, and
is sung in such an insinuating slur that it is actually
necessary to take a shower after listening to the song to
shake the feling of being covered in grease.
It's hard to think of Orrall, who asks people to write to
him "and send a picture!" as the champion on anti
sexism — maybe not impossible — but this song is so
repellent on so many levels that it neuters itself.
So much for this debut "mini-LP" — one pretty good
song that has a good sound, and a few scattered mo
ments. On the down side, two absolutely hideous
songs. It'll be interesting if an album comes out. After
listening to "Special Pain" I get the feeling that if he
didn't have so much time to worry his material he might
squeak out some pretty good stuff — and some of it
might sound honest and heartfelt. Here's to optimism!
