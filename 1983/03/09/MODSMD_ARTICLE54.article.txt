# The 						loneliness of the long-distance pianist
## 
### MARK VINCENTI 
A significant part of the impression that
Murray Perahia makes upon his audience, in
a live performance, derives from his physical
behavior rather than from the sounds that
emerge from beneath the piano lid.
Perahia radiates tension at every moment.
During passage of gathering intensity, his
head slowly arcs forward and down, his eyes
close in upon the keys as though he were
fixing a powerful microscope upon them.
When his hands explode in loud chords, his
head bobs madly, seemingly jolted by recoil.
Sometimes his hands leap violently away
from the keys, as though his fingers had
received an electric shock.
His mouth hangs agape; he seems neither
to inhale nor exhale. Lyrical moments in the
music draw his gaze upwards, in a kind of
religious rapture. Having concluded a piece,
he scarcely emerges from his trance-like
state. He walks carefully offstage, appearing
dazed and distant.
Perahia's behavior at the piano may be
perceived as passionate commitment — as
an heroic struggle towards a compelling vis
ion. From an opposite point of view,
Perahia's behavior may be perceived as
overwrought, frenetic — the visible signs of
a driven personality, never at ease with him

self or his audience.
However he is perceived, the crucial ques
tions are these: Do Perahia's physical exer
tions contribute to or detract from the end
result, the musical sound? Is the message
that is seen by the concert-goer the same
message that is heard? Does one message
hinder the other? And what is the effect on
the messages of Messrs. Beethoven,
Schubert and Liszt?
Answers to these questions may be ven
tured, based on Perahia'a recital last Friday
in Memorial Auditorium, before a large and
attentive audience. He played three very di
verse works: Liszt's B-minor Sonata,
Schubert's Four Impromptus, Opus 142, and
Beethoven's Sonata in D-major, Opus 10,
No. 3.
The opening presto of the Beethoven
sonata sounded clear, graceful and smooth.
Perahia played with a remarkably unvarying
tempo, and his scale of loud-to-soft echoed
more of Mozart than of Beethoven. The vari
eties of accent and emphasis (fortissimo,

sforzando, "ffp" were surprisingly mild.
At the many places where Beethoven of
fers opportunity for expressive contrast,
Perahia took little advantage of them. The
fermata markings (indicating a long hold)
were glossed over — the holds not stretched
out. The soft passages that are all in half
notes were played without the slowing
down that they suggest.
Of the slow movement in this sonata,
Beethoven remarked that the pace must be
changed 10 times, "but only so as to be
heard by the most sensitive ear." Perahia
seemed to heed this advice, and played deli
cately and melodiously. The movement is
remarkable, near the end, for a long build
up of sound that, at its climax, breaks off into
halting, soft-spoken phrases. Perahia
brought out the inner struggle that this

movement depicts — a sorrow that runs
deep, but holds hack its tears.
The Menuetto was gentle and pleasing,
but its Trio did not perk up as it should. The
closing Rondo contains as many surprises
and plot-twists as a Feydeau farce, with the
crafty timing of a magician. "Now you see
me, now you don't!" the music seems to
tease. The persistant strictness of Perahia's
tempo, and his lack of that relaxation that
gives birth to playfulness — these militated
against the success of this finale.
Among composers for the piano,
Schubert is (for this reviewer, at least) the
toughest nut to crack, and I had hoped that
Perahia would enlighten me. Alas, though
Perahia looked to be working like the very
devil, the result in sound was unconvincing.
To pierce to the heart of things in Schubert
seems to require great maturity and under
standing. Touch his music carelessly, and
the bloom vanishes. Playing Schubert, you
must make the piano seem to breathe and
sing as though it were human; but at the
next moment you must treat it as an instru
ment for percussion. A strange bitter
sweetness pervades Schubert's music, via
the close interplay of major and minor keys,
major and minor chords.
Often in his pieces Schubert seems to
show us at first the serene, benign surface of
a lake; only later does he point our gaze
downward, revealing troubled, shadowed,
colder depths.
Of the four Impromptus, Opus 142, the
first is the most baffling, particularly in the
extended middle section where the right
hand plays a murmuring accompaniment,
and the left hand crosses back and forth
from treble to bass, uttering fragments of
melody. It sounds like two people, a man
and a woman, trying together to recall an old
song, Whose melody they remember only in
bits and pieces. Here, Perahia's right-hand
accompaniment was too loud, and the
melodic fragments did not cohere.
Sometimes Schubert writes the most
damnably simple tunes, straight-forwardly
harmonized with a chord on each melody
note. The first of these impromptus has such
a tune, in the major key; the second im
promptu begins with such a tune. To make
these tunes shapely and songful is quite a
challenge; Perahia did not succeed.
In the third impromptu, a set of variations,
Perahia gave a buoyant lilt to the theme and
to its second variation, but in the third varia
tion he did not find the passion in Schubert's
details of harmony and melody. The difficult
right-hand runs of variation — five were
crystal clear, but Perahia neglected the
sweetness, gaiety and warmth that they im
ply.
Again, in the fourth impromptu the right
hand runs whisked by with clean precision;
and Perahia laid out the roguish theme with
clarity. But he fell short of capturing the
"scherzando" vigor of the piece. In brisk,
effervescent music like this, the player must
take great pleasure, thereby giving his lis
teners the same pleasure. The terrific inner
tension that possesses Perahia, so apparent

in his outward behavior — this tension
usurps that inner resting-place, that pasture
of the soul where coltish spirits (relaxation,
spontaneity, freedom) should be allowed to
roam, romp and graze at leisure.
However, after intermission, in the Liszt
B-minor Sonata, Perahia's vehemence, his
highly-pressurized intensity — which, be
fore intermission were visibly communi
cated but not contributing, aurally, to
healthy musical results — these qualities in
his personality appropriately lent them
selves to qualities in Liszt's music.
Liszt took the solid ground of traditional
harmony, flooded it with diminished
chords, ambiguous scales, endless
chromaticism and far-fetched key relation
ships, and produced a musical swamp
where the footing is slippery and the terrain
threatening. As in a horror movie, feelings of
fear and panic result, and the heart pounds
violently, yearning for rescue and relief.
Perahia flung himself at a fever pitch, no
holds barred, into this nightmarish swamp
Time and again he stood up from the piano
bench in order to pour down more weight
and passion into the keyboard. Finally, all his
nervous tension could find release. One
climax followed another, though the transi
tions between them did not always make
sense. In the slower, lyrical sections, the
heavenward sighs were achingly extracted
from the keyboard, note by note. In this, the
visual image given by Perahia contributed
heavily to the musical sense.
Liszt's booming theme, marked "Grand
ioso," which employs double-barreled
chords with organ-like sonortiy, was the
touchstone of Perahia's interpretation. At its
final, climactic appearance, Perahia seemed
to be shouting at the very heavens, exalted
in triumph.
Given this interpretation, the last page of
the sonata seemed anti-climactic, and
Perahia played down the lingering doubts
that Liszt expresses. After all, "shouting at
the heavens" is sometimes dangerously
similar to "crying for the moon," and might
be viewed with some skepticism.
Before concluding, I must emphasize that
Perahia's behavior at the piano smacks not
one whit of insincerity, affectation or showi
ness. He is not posing; the agonies that rend
him are not feigned.
I came to this concert with admiration for
Murray Perahia. I had previously heard his
ethereal, graceful recordings of the Mozart
piano concertos, the Schumann piano con
certo — which gives no hint that Perahia is
undergoing terrible exertions to produce
such perfection. At his performance last Fri
day I was dismayed; it left me cold.
Much of the audience, however, stood
and cheered, though their enthusiasm
evoked little response from Perahia, who
seemed so insular and distant. For myself,
seeing Perahia reminded me of the extremes
that one sees in a long-distance runner, who
crosses the finish-line victoriously, but then
collapses in awful pain. Should one feel in
spired, or sad?
