# Small pleasures from Brickman a Pearce
## 
### STEVE VINEBERG 
'Lovesick'
Marshall Brickman's first
movie, Simon, was a satirical
explosion — he aimed at so
many targets (science, several
schools of phychology, televi
sion, Muzak, the space pro
gram, Jewish mothers, etc.)
that fie needed to concoct a
horrendous!*/ complicated plot
to account for all of them, and
the comedy popped off in so
many directions at once that
you couldn't sort it all out in
your head afterwards. (The fact
that the pictured couldn't be
summarized in a review, let
alone a publicity release, prob
ably explains its quick death at
the box office.) Still, a lot of it
was very funny, and you had to
admire a writer-director who
tried to pack a half dozen
movies into his first solo effort.
(Brickman used to collaborate
on Woody Allen's
screenplays.) Besides, Simon
had an unusual comic sensi
bility. The hero, (played by Alan
Arkin) was a scientist trying to
prove his pet theory — that
everyone has the potential for
genius — and the most
memorable sequences were
set among his colleagues in a
government-sponsored think
tank; Brickman found the
humor in this highly spe
cialized kind of high-powered
intellectual domain. The same
sensibility controls his new
Lovesick, in which almost all
the characters are analysts and
"analysands," but this time
he's cleaned up his technique
— trimmed the edges, shar
pened his focus, picked up a
more fluid style. It'sasprightly,
benign comedy.
Dudley Moore plays Saul
Benjamin, a married psychia
trist who falls instantly and
embarrassingly in love with a
young playwright, Chloe Allen
(Elizabeth McGovern, with her
appealing double-take vul
nerability), a patient he has in
herited from a friend and col
league (Wallace Shawn) who
died suddenly. Moore brings
his amazing adeptness at phys
ical comedy to the role, as well

as his celebrated low-key and
pixieish sweetness, but he may
not have been the actor
Brickman had in mind: Saul
Benjamin is a Jewish name, and
the character belongs to a
largely New York Jewish circle.
(Among the analysts who
gather, in one of the funniest
scenes, to pass judgment on
Saul's competence once his in
fatuation with Chloehas begun
to affect his professional be
havior are David King and
Selma Diamond.) There's
something odd about Moore
and McGovern as a couple,
too — you don't really buy this
relationship, and Moore
doesn't have the right equip
ment to pull off Saul's unpro
voked paranoid attack on
Chloe which almost breaks
them up.
Perhaps Brickman shouldn't
have been so anxious to trim
those edges. Pleasant as it is,
Lovesick suffers from a kind of
creeping blandness, despite
the efforts of a phenomenal
supporting cast to keep it at
bay. The photographer, Gerry
Fisher, drowns Saul's fantasies
about Chloe in a white mist,
and the fantasies themselves,
intended take-offs on Death in
Venice and The Lovers and
other impassioned epics, are
rather sterile and cut-rate. Saul
also imagines himself talkingto
Freud (a wry, dry Alec Gui
ness), who is at first intrusive
and hilariously unhelpful but
who turns out to be sane,
knowing guardian angel deliv
ering words of wisdom
Brickman clearly wants us to
take seriously. Saul's "libera
tion" from the mercenary
world of his fellow psychia
trists at the end of the picture
(which Freud endorses) has all
the marks of a Hollywood-style
rebellion, like Jason Robards'
resistance to nine-to-five labor
in A Thousand Clowns, and
since Saul seems to experience
no pressure at all in his marital
life, his stress may strike us as a
little overstated. (The Benja
mins' marriage dissolves in an
affirmation of mutual respect
and affection that defies be
lief.) But how can anyone resist
a movie with John Huston,

Alan King, Wallace Shawn,
Selma Diamond and Richard B.
Shull as shrinks, Gene Saks,
ReneeTaylor, David Straitharn,
Lester Rawlins and Kent
Broadhurst as patients, Anne
DeSalvo as a Social Security
case worker, the painter Larry
Rivers (who looks like a cross
between a rooster and a hawk)
as a painter, and (best of all)
Ron Silver as a temperamental
actor obviously based on Al
Pacino? Lovesick has more in
spired comedians in it that any
film since My Favorite Year.
'Threshold'
The dialogue in the Cana
dian feature Threshold, pen
ned by James Salter, rarely
rises above the banal, and
sometimes it's considerably
worse than that. (Alluding to a
journalist expected for dinner,
the wife of a hero — a cardiac
surgeon played by Donald
Sutherland — explains, "Lie's
the one who did the article on
the Kennedys — you know, the
one that demythified them.")
And the director, Richard
Pearce, tries a loose, semi
improvised stylewith hisactors
that just underlines the de
ficiencies of the script and the
inadequacies of most of the
supporting players. But the
subject matter — heart trans
plants — provides it own sus
pense and its own set of emo
tions, and Pearce has the intel
ligence and tact not to wreck it.
The operating room scenes are
gripping in a simple,
untricked-up way and the

freshness of the material trans
cends Salter's hack efforts at
dramatizing it. When 21-year
old Carol (Mare Winningham)
describes what it feels like to
wear an artificial heart, you
recognize that no character in
any movie has ever spoken like
this before.
The casting of this extraordi
nary young actress, whose face
can communicate pure emo
tion so expressively that she es
tablishes immediate empathy,
helps the movie considerably.
So does Donald Sutherland,
who gives his best perform
ance in ten years (since Don't
look Now) as Dr. Thomas
Vrain, a role strongly sugges
tive of Dr. Denton Cooley.
(Cooley and Robert Jarvick
both served as consultants on
the picture.) Vrain lives in a
state of perpetual anxiety;
when the ground-breaking
operation on Carol is over, he
experiences none of the ela
tion a new discovery usually
brings in movies — just fatigue
and worry and a desperate
need for calm. Sutherland em
ploys his aptitude for delicately
nuanced underacting to great
advantage here; his touch is so
sure that before you realize it
he has drawn the movie tightly
around himself. Pearce might
have worked against him by
using a conventionally showy
actor as Vrain's opposite
number, Aldo Gehring — the
researcher who invents the ar
tificial heart and then, when he
becomes famous, turns out to
have a streak of P.T. Barnum in
him — but instead he gives us


Jeff Goldblum, a weird, unclas-"
sifiable character actor who
has done fine, distinctive,
mostly unnoticed work in
Nashville, Next Stop,
Greenwich Village and Inva
sion of the Body Snatchers.
(He offers rare insight into the
mixture of pride, rage and frus
trated ambition that might be
smoldering in a man who has
been plugging away at a single
idea in a lab for a dozen years.)
And though it carries modesty
to a fault, Threshold — like
another recent Canadian film
on a terrific subject, Ticket to
Heaven — is a small but
pleasurable surprise.
