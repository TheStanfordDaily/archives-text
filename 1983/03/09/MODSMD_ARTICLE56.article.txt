# 'Don Juan': The Great Seducer and bumbling humanity
## 
### DAVID SCHMELZER 
A perennial quesiion about
plays written before you or
anyone you know was born is
their applicability. Why should
you want to see a play like Don
la.>n, written in France more
than a hundred years before

the Revolution? Does
Moliere's argument for repen
tance and against the mockery
of Heaven have any relevance
beyond that of a reaction of his
time, where he may have been
addressing the disarray of the
church after a century of ad

justmenl to the Protestant Re
formation' How c(juld such a
work translate as anymore than
shrill moralizing today?
Well, for one reason,
Moliere was aware of the chal
lenges he faced as a comic
playwright trying to argue
theology. Early on in Don ludn,
the title character says,"l don't
like preachers," and Moliere
took this consideration seri
ously. His is a wonderiul funny
play about pivotal, serious is
sues, ones that, like those in
most serious literature, will
remain just as serious until the
earth runs down.
Also, director Laurence Mas
lon has taken the trapping Don
luan and muddied them a bit,
making the time frame difficult
to place. We see an impressive
crumbling stone archway that
serves as a palace and a tomb,
but also a character wearing a
polyester suit. While this can
be jarring, it adds to the play's
immediacy, as we're able to in
volve ourselves in the action
rather than have period cos
tumes continually remind us
that we're seeing a cultural
document, useful primarily for
that purpose alone. Clearly
that is not the case in this pro
duction, and Maslon has
helped to convey his purpose
by fashioning a tight, well
crafted, well-acted show.
Certainly Fritz Brun, a seem
ing incarnation of the Great
Seducer himself, has the brav
ura role as Don luan, a man
whose only religion is arithme

tic (his professed faith is that
two and two makes four), who
forces a nun to break her vows
and then deserts her and who
later argues for hypocrisy as
"an intelligent mind's" way to
manipulate the world to his
self-interest. But Don Juan is a
charming Ogre, whrh makes
his mounting evil all the more
chilling since we often liked
him in spite of ourselves. Brun,
conveys both the charm and
the horror and heightens both
magnificently. His early de
fense of his lechery, that the
"advantage of being the tirst
one we meet must not rob the
others of the just claims they all
have on our hearts," is impish
and broad, both quickly '-sub
lishing who this character is
and giving him a zest that st '•
the play's often ironic tune
While the nuances of the
character are broadly done
they're usually quite witty a-,
well, such as his inspection of
the peasant girl Charlotte
(Christine Roumi, where he of
fers businesslike approval of
her figure, eyes and teeth.
Martin Robinson is also quite
good as Don luan's weak but
persistent counterpart the
valet Sganarelle. His obsequi
ous mannerisms, center
parted hair and Charlie C hap
11n mustache give him an air of
absurdity that accentuates Don
Juan's imposing, superio*", al
most demonic qual.ty Don
Juan may be too smart to be
lieve, but Sganarelle, with his
lack of schooling, siill stands

up to him and argues that every
instinct of man proclaims the
power of God. Robinson's
humbling humanity reinforres
a major point of Moliere's ar
gument; that the simple man
may be no match for the bril
liant bully, but he sees truth
more clearly than one who
only looks to himself for that
truth.
Perhaps Robinson's major
flaw is that in the midst of his
absurdity, he still can't help but
project intelligence; we see his
mind working forcefully in his
arguments with Don luan and
we may feel his superiority
rather than his muddled think
ing in his opening recital of the
virtues of tobacco. But he has
»ome terrific comic moments,
such as a fruitless attempt to
dine with his master, and he
handles some Chaplinesque
switches to pathos, quietly cry
ing during Flvire's pleadings.
"Ihe supporting players are
just as fine. Scott Leland's Sici
lian Don C arlos is believable in
spite of the stereotype. His
forceful speech and large, sur
prised handshake portray a
touching boy having to "be a
man," and his fight with his
brother Don Alfonse (Michael
l.ardon) is amazing; they fly
across the stage from each
other's blows and give
speeches with their faces
pressed in pain against the
ground.
As Dona Elvire, the former
nun who becomes Don Juan's
latest jilted wife, Nike Doukas

is dignity personified in one of
the play's few entirely serious
roles, a good woman who sees
the extent of her sin. That
Doukas gives Elvire strength
also gives the character her
beauty, and we believe that she
could make Sganarelle cry
Marjorie Eaton as Don
Juan's mother, Christine Roum
and Terra Vandergaw, as rival
victims of Don Juan's sedin tive
powers, and Joe Christiario, as
Roum's fiance, are also im
pressive. Eaton's lengthy
speeches and deliberate < a
dence give her scenes an
added weight and sense of im
port. Roum and Vandergaw are
both beautifully guileless, a
trait which perhaps could have
been useful for Christiano
whose commanding stage pre
sence gives his character an in
solence that makes him less
sympathetic than he could
have been, and thus makes us
slightly less horrified at Don
Juan's outrage toward him.
The relatively simple set (de
signed by Maslon and Richard
Koch) is magnificent, with its
truly marble-like archways and
benches, a cleverly moving
tree, and even a portrait of
Brun as Don Juan.
While the play's fantastic
ending clearly changes the
tone of the play, the tine pro
duction and Moliere's witty,
serious script never fall into
sermonizing, though Don
luan's message is as grave and
important as one which any
preacher would speak.

trait which perhaps could have
been useful for Christiano
whose commanding stage pre
sence gives his character an in
solence that makes him less
sympathetic than he could
have been, and thus makes us
slightly less horrified at Don
Juan's outrage toward him.
The relatively simple set (de
signed by Maslon and Richard
Koch) is magnificent, with its
truly marble-like archways and
benches, a cleverly moving
tree, and even a portrait of
Brun as Don Juan.
While the play's fantastic
ending clearly changes the
tone of the play, the tine pro
duction and Moliere's witty,
serious script never fall into
sermonizing, though Don
luan's message is as grave and
important as one which any
preacher would speak.


Marlin Robinson, Frit/ Brun
and Christine Roum in
Don Juan.
A perennial quesiion about
plays written before you or
anyone you know was born is
their applicability. Why should
you want to see a play like Don
la.>n, written in France more
than a hundred years before

the Revolution? Does
Moliere's argument for repen
tance and against the mockery
of Heaven have any relevance
beyond that of a reaction of his
time, where he may have been
addressing the disarray of the
church after a century of ad

justmenl to the Protestant Re
formation' How c(juld such a
work translate as anymore than
shrill moralizing today?
Well, for one reason,
Moliere was aware of the chal
lenges he faced as a comic
playwright trying to argue
theology. Early on in Don ludn,
the title character says,"l don't
like preachers," and Moliere
took this consideration seri
ously. His is a wonderiul funny
play about pivotal, serious is
sues, ones that, like those in
most serious literature, will
remain just as serious until the
earth runs down.
Also, director Laurence Mas
lon has taken the trapping Don
luan and muddied them a bit,
making the time frame difficult
to place. We see an impressive
crumbling stone archway that
serves as a palace and a tomb,
but also a character wearing a
polyester suit. While this can
be jarring, it adds to the play's
immediacy, as we're able to in
volve ourselves in the action
rather than have period cos
tumes continually remind us
that we're seeing a cultural
document, useful primarily for
that purpose alone. Clearly
that is not the case in this pro
duction, and Maslon has
helped to convey his purpose
by fashioning a tight, well
crafted, well-acted show.
Certainly Fritz Brun, a seem
ing incarnation of the Great
Seducer himself, has the brav
ura role as Don luan, a man
whose only religion is arithme

tic (his professed faith is that
two and two makes four), who
forces a nun to break her vows
and then deserts her and who
later argues for hypocrisy as
"an intelligent mind's" way to
manipulate the world to his
self-interest. But Don Juan is a
charming Ogre, whrh makes
his mounting evil all the more
chilling since we often liked
him in spite of ourselves. Brun,
conveys both the charm and
the horror and heightens both
magnificently. His early de
fense of his lechery, that the
"advantage of being the tirst
one we meet must not rob the
others of the just claims they all
have on our hearts," is impish
and broad, both quickly '-sub
lishing who this character is
and giving him a zest that st '•
the play's often ironic tune
While the nuances of the
character are broadly done
they're usually quite witty a-,
well, such as his inspection of
the peasant girl Charlotte
(Christine Roumi, where he of
fers businesslike approval of
her figure, eyes and teeth.
Martin Robinson is also quite
good as Don luan's weak but
persistent counterpart the
valet Sganarelle. His obsequi
ous mannerisms, center
parted hair and Charlie C hap
11n mustache give him an air of
absurdity that accentuates Don
Juan's imposing, superio*", al
most demonic qual.ty Don
Juan may be too smart to be
lieve, but Sganarelle, with his
lack of schooling, siill stands

up to him and argues that every
instinct of man proclaims the
power of God. Robinson's
humbling humanity reinforres
a major point of Moliere's ar
gument; that the simple man
may be no match for the bril
liant bully, but he sees truth
more clearly than one who
only looks to himself for that
truth.
Perhaps Robinson's major
flaw is that in the midst of his
absurdity, he still can't help but
project intelligence; we see his
mind working forcefully in his
arguments with Don luan and
we may feel his superiority
rather than his muddled think
ing in his opening recital of the
virtues of tobacco. But he has
»ome terrific comic moments,
such as a fruitless attempt to
dine with his master, and he
handles some Chaplinesque
switches to pathos, quietly cry
ing during Flvire's pleadings.
"Ihe supporting players are
just as fine. Scott Leland's Sici
lian Don C arlos is believable in
spite of the stereotype. His
forceful speech and large, sur
prised handshake portray a
touching boy having to "be a
man," and his fight with his
brother Don Alfonse (Michael
l.ardon) is amazing; they fly
across the stage from each
other's blows and give
speeches with their faces
pressed in pain against the
ground.
As Dona Elvire, the former
nun who becomes Don Juan's
latest jilted wife, Nike Doukas

is dignity personified in one of
the play's few entirely serious
roles, a good woman who sees
the extent of her sin. That
Doukas gives Elvire strength
also gives the character her
beauty, and we believe that she
could make Sganarelle cry
Marjorie Eaton as Don
Juan's mother, Christine Roum
and Terra Vandergaw, as rival
victims of Don Juan's sedin tive
powers, and Joe Christiario, as
Roum's fiance, are also im
pressive. Eaton's lengthy
speeches and deliberate < a
dence give her scenes an
added weight and sense of im
port. Roum and Vandergaw are
both beautifully guileless, a
trait which perhaps could have
been useful for Christiano
whose commanding stage pre
