It you're looking tor a quiet evening for
two, the Cap Band is highly unrecom
mended.
The soul/funk group came, saw and con
quered the capacity Circle Star Theater
crowd Saturday night not unlike Caesar ram
paging through Caul however many cen
turies ago.
Sure, they played slow songs that included
Ivrics about romance and love, but the set
ting and style in which they played them was
hardly the equivalent of a candlelight dinner
for two at a secluded seaside restaurant. The
music was loud and the sound system mal
functioned several times, resulting in a pierc
ing crackling noise. And for a soul group, the
Cap Band played an almost unprecedented
small number of slow songs, opting to "funk
it up" for the better part of their 90 minute
show.
In sheer numbers, the Cap Band more than
resembled Caesar's Roman army. Fifteen
band members crowded the Circle Star's
already-crowded-with-instru ments stage.
Thev walked in legions down the concert
hall's aisles to the stage. First the percussion
section, then the keyboard players, followed
by the guitarists and the horn section. Bring
ing up the rear were the scantily clad back-up
singers.
And the Cap Band, like Caesar's army,
wore uniforms of sorts. The 10 members of
the back-up group donned all white, silk out
fits. The two female back-up singers wore
silver, sequined bathing suits, while the
three lead members of the group came out in
white silk, but wore cowboy hats and rows of
trills on their pants and shirts.
When the group returned for its encore
presentation oi Vou Dropped a Bomb on
Me," the band's triumvirate (one just sings,
another plays bass, while the third plays
horns and keyboards) exited the back stage
area wearing khaki commando-style clothes.
The Gap Band also has a following. People
came from all over to see and hear them play,
and dressed appropriately for the occasion. If
you weren't in a suit or a dress, you were flat
out undepressed. In tact, one showy soul
wore an all white tux. White pants. White
shirt. White vest. White coat. White top hat
and cane. The works. The only other color in
his outfit was the red â€” in the form of a sash
around his waist, matching red shoes and
bowtie. Oh yea, he had a bright, though
small, red tpather in his top hat.

But if talented musicians are what you're
looking for, the Cap Band is certainly not the
place to find them. Not one of the 15 on stage
could "hang ' with even average jazz, rock or
soul players; then again, they didn't need to.
With so manv in the band, each member can
play a simple part that adds up in the end to
something sounding infinitely more compli
cated And by using so many players, the Cap
Band achieves a much fuller sound.
Opening tor the Cap Band was Yarborough
and Peoples, in what seemed like a poor im
itation of things to come. The group, also
with everyone and his brother on stage, fea
tured a female and male lead singer, the latter
whose voice made him sound like his first
cousin was a crocodile. They played their two
hits, "Don t Stop" and "Heartbeat," neither
of which inspired the crowd enough to ask
them back for an encore. Y and P, to under
state the issue, exited quickly from the Circle
Star's rotating stage
But it was not the Gap Band as a whole that
stole the show. Instead, it was a "kid," not
more than 17 years old, whose face was so
brimming with confidence that it resembled
that of Magic lohnson. Why so much confi
dence in himself' The bov could dance. And
he knew it.
Not playing much more than the synthe
sized clap machine that was used on virtually
every song, the youth kept a low profile for
the first two-thirds of the concert. But then
he took center stage and started to dance to
one of the Gap Band's funkier tunes. The
crowd almost instantly tell in love with the
youth, appropriately called "Baby Gap" by
his fellow band members, to the extent that
the final halt hour of the show was literally a
dance clinic. "Baby Gap" wasn't the only one
dancing, however. The entire audience got
into the act as well.
Making the already excellent audience/
performer contact even stronger, the trium
virate leading the Gap Band almost con
stantly relied upon wholehearted audience
participation. First, the "ladies" would sing a
few lines of a particular song, then the men,
excuse me, the "fellas" would |oin in.
But underlying the entire concert was a
feeling that all present were going to have a
good time, like it or not, drunk or sobei.
Translated into Gap Band terms, as the
group's lead singer said at various intervals in
the concert, "We're goin' to turn this mother
out!"
