# 'Nuts' puts society on trial
## 
### TOM GARRETT 
Nuts, like the cra/y whore
around whom the play re
volves, is both different and
refreshing.
It is different because au
thor Tom Topor rejects the
power plays of those
dramatists who would jerk
the sympathies of the audi
ence around like a dog on a
leash in order to go in the
"right" direction. His play is
genuine. The audience is not
presented with good people
and bad people but with real
people.
Like the judge, the audi
ence must decide whether the
whore, Claudia Faith Draper,
is incapable of standing trial
for the manslaughter of one
of her customers. We too
must examine not only the
supposedly insane woman
hut the accepted norms of our
society. Heartless lawyers,
molesting parents, the al
mighty law, and know-it-all
psychiatrists can indeed be as
nuts as the angry woman
whom they mean to judge.
The acting, with the nota
ble exception of the judge
(played by a retired Deputy
Fire Chief from Berkeley) is
consistently excellent. Melli
cent Wauters' portrayal of
Claudia Drayer, the paranoid
lady of the night, shows a
masterful quality rarely seen
in any production. When
badgered and attacked by the
people's attorney about her
past Draper responds with a
list pf her so seamv
and vile (". . . enemas arc 4 $50
extra, no golden showers, no
brown showers, no whips, no
spiles . . .") that the lawyer is
sorry he asked. And yet we
realize that although she en
gages in foul and base acts,
she is selling because our so
ciety is buying.
Gerald Ambinder (as Ar
thur Kirk, Claudia Draper's
step father) artd Michael
C r o d en c hi k (as Aaron
Levinsky, Draper's lawyer)
also turn in remarkable per
formances. "Daddy" is a bel
licose soul who believes that

life is one big business deal
and everything c an be bought
with money. But he is forced
on the witness stand to admit
he tried to buy his stepdaugh
ter for $ 100 and the pain of
that admission to him, in pub
lic, and in front of his wife is
felt throughout the theater.
Aaron Levinsky is a ,
different type entirely. Never
caught without a trick up his
sleeve he seems to be some
white knight eternally looking
for underdogs to champion.
And yet when he tells his
client that he will make her
bleed on the stand like all the
rest she asks him, "Don't you
love all your (lients?"

"Did you?" is his only re
sponse. He is just out to do his
ugly jol) like everyone else.
The affect of this superb
acting is dulled a bit by the
extremely uncomfortable
seats and the theater itself
which resembles a lunior
High School Auditorium with
a Baroque ceiling. But in all
Nuts is a bold and exciting
production, rife with sur
prises, and filled with excel
lent actors.
