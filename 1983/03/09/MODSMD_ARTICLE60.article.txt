Benton wrote and directed this
comedy-thriller with a melan
choly tone and an eccentric,
unpredictable manner: you're
continually sideswiped by
bizarre characters, distinctive,
surprising details and wonder
fully unfamiliar twists in the
lines. The biggest, and best, sur
prise is in the teamwork of Art
Carney and Lily Tomlin. He
plays Ira Wells, an aging detec

wounds, and she is Margo, a

Timothy Bottoms struggles
through his first year of Harvard
Law School, falling in love with
Lindsay Wagner, whose uncle,
John Houseman, is the most
brilliant professor in the institu

actor, but the character's cons

seems to be an overblown reac

away unopened (a variation on
the passage in This Side of Para

Kresge Auditorium
This buoyant, affectionate
comedy about high school sen

George Lucas, famous. When it
came out, some people gave it
credit for a high seriousness it
probably never intended, be
cause the post-dramatic in
formation we're given about
the characters adds a somber
(and inappropriate) note to the
proceedings. Some of the ac
tors do give the funny Willard
Huyck-Gloria Katz screenplay
some supplementary depth:
Cindy Williams, Paul Le Mat,
Mackenzie Phillips and a
young, touching Richard
Dreyfuss (looking a little like a

The camera is always in the
wrong place, the sound rec
ording is occasionally opaque,
the editing is haphazard, and
the lighting is so poor that in
some shots sunlight streaming
through a window whites out
the actors. Is it a virtue to make
a movie this badly on less than
$20,000? Wayne Wang's thriller
is a lot like the puzzle pictures
Antonioni and others released
in the '60s, but it's played in an
improvised style that fails mi
serably because the actors
aren't good enough (except for
Marc Hayashi) and Wang
doesn't know how to keep their
energy going.
Plays Tuesday and Wednes

story; Edward Linden, Verne

Walker and J.D. Taylor all
worked on the cinemato
graphy. (The self-parodying,
comic-strip remake, written by
Lorenzo Semple, Jr. and
directed by John Guillermin, is
different but in its way just as
good: it has an extended pop
romantic luminosity that this
version just hints at.)
Plays through Wednesday
with The Invisible Man.
Wuthering Heights (1933)
New Varsity, Palo Alto ★
"Why is there no smell of
heather in your hair? Why are
your eyes so empty?" the
young, tormented Heathcliff
(Laurence Olivier) asks his
wretched wife Isabella
(Geraldine Fitzgerald), compar
ing her to beautiful, fragile
Cathy (Merle Oberon). This
line may be an invention of the
screenwriters, Ben Hecht and
Charles Mac Arthur, and indeed
William Wyler's film omits the
second (inferior) half of the
novel altogether, but it's super
bly made and terribly moving
— you don't even notice Merle
Oberon's semi-competent act
ing (most of the time). She and
Olivier make a smashing ro
mantic couple, and he gives the
first of his legendary screen per
formances. He had done a
number of British films prior to
Wuthering Heights, but none
of them began to suggest the
power he would bring to
Heathcliff; when he swears a
vendetta against the Lintons. he
provokes terror without raising
his voice much above a
murmur. With David Niven,
Flora Robson, Donald Crisp,
Leo G. Carroll, Hugh Williams,
Cecil Kellaway and Miles
Mander; photographed by the
great Gregg Toland.
Plays next Thursday (March
17) with Pride and Prejudice.
The Postman Always Rings
Twice (1946)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
James M. Cain's tight,
purplish erotic thriller — a
swift, satisfying read — has
been filmed twice in this coun
try and once in Italy (as Os
sessione, Luchino Visconti's
first picture). This version,
adapted by Harry Ruskin and

Niven Busrh, directed by Tay
Carnett and photographed by
Sidney Wagner, is both sleek
and (enjoyab'y) sleazy and it
stars tans Turner in hpr most
characteristic performance, as a
bored, horny, murderous
femme (atale (the Cain special
ty) Playing opposite her — as
the sucker enamored of her —
is one of the most vivid actors of
the period, John Garfield. With
Cecil KHlawav, Hume < ronyn,
Leon Ames, Audrey Totter and
Alan Reed.
Plays tomorrow with Mildred
Pierce.
American Graffiti (1973) *
Kresge Auditorium
This buoyant, affectionate
comedy about high school sen
iors at the very end of the pre-
Beatle era made its director,
George Lucas, famous. When it
came out, some people gave it
credit for a high seriousness it
probably never intended, be
cause the post-dramatic in
formation we're given about
the characters adds a somber
(and inappropriate) note to the
proceedings. Some of the ac
tors do give the funny Willard
Huyck-Gloria Katz screenplay
some supplementary depth:
Cindy Williams, Paul Le Mat,
Mackenzie Phillips and a
young, touching Richard
Dreyfuss (looking a little like a
juvenile version of George C.
Scott) as the amorous dreamer
Curt. Less successful are the
episodes between Charlie
Martin Smith as the hopeless
nerd, Terry the Toad, and Can
dy Clark as Debbie, who tries to
emulate Sandra Dee and Con
nie Stevens.
Plays Saturday evening.
Chan Is Missing
New Varsity, Palo Alto
The camera is always in the
wrong place, the sound rec
ording is occasionally opaque,
the editing is haphazard, and
the lighting is so poor that in
some shots sunlight streaming
through a window whites out
the actors. Is it a virtue to make
a movie this badly on less than
$20,000? Wayne Wang's thriller
is a lot like the puzzle pictures
Antonioni and others released
in the '60s, but it's played in an
improvised style that fails mi
serably because the actors
aren't good enough (except for
Marc Hayashi) and Wang
doesn't know how to keep their
energy going.
Plays Tuesday and Wednes
day (March 16) with The Late
Show.
