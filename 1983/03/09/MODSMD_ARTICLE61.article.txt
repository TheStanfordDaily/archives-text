And then came dessert. It was, in a word or
three, terrific, marvelous, delicious. It was
Greens.
The busiest establishment in San Francis
co's Fort Mason Center, Greens restaurant
offers a haven for the quiet diner. Not brash
and overpriced like some more well-known
tourist attractions, nor trendy and overpriced
like other fashionably chic places to be seen,
Greens coolly does what it does: serve very
good vegetarian food.
Operated by a Zen Buddhist sect, Greens is
something of a novelty. All the waiters are
members of the sect, and the profits from the
restaurant and the adjoining Tassajara Bread
Bakery are funelled into the sect. In this re
spect, it is rather curious, and explains,
perhaps, why the waiters do not appear to
enjoy their work particularly, at times appear
ing even morose in performing their duties.
The dining hall is situated on one of the
Fort Mason piers, with huge windows all
along the west wall looking out over the
Marina, Pacific Heights and the Golden Gate.
The designers made full use of this natural
liuhting. and plaved down the artificial lights

on the 25-foot ceiling.
The tables are rather close together, a fat t
which only became apparent as the dining
room began to fill. As we discussed the wea
ther in different parts of the country, the
couple at the next table leaned over to us to
share their views on the virtues of Troy, New
York, and the efficiencies of its mass trans
portation. An intelligent interjection
perhaps, but really!
The menu contains pasta, salad, cheese
and tofu dishes for the main part, all priced
between $4 and $8, all accompanied by a bas
ket of various breads from the Tassajara bak
ery, hot, made the same day.
We ordered the soup of the day, which was
a spicy cream of mushroom, dark and mar
velously thick with large mushroom pieces. It
complemented the bread well and made me
glad that I had ordered a salad.
We ordered three very different entrees.
The first was a Romaine and Avocado salad
with oil and lemon dressing. At $5.50 it was a
bit overpriced but delicious. The lettuce, av
ocados and black beans were very fresh and
cold and the salad was large.
The second was a broiled tofu sandwich.
The tofu was marinated in a soy and spice
sauce until the center was slightly darkened,
then erillod. Served on wheat bread with

horseradish and red cabbage cole slaw on the
side, it was extremely flavorful. The marinade
and grilling had almost completely overcome
the beany taste and texture of the tofu. It gave
the impression of an exotic turkey sandwich.
At $4, it was very reasonable.
The last of our main dishes was a tofu salad
($4.50). For this, the tofu had been mixed
with garlic, mustard, onion and other herbs
to give it a wonderful flavor. It was served
with Romaine lettuce, cucumbers, ripe
olives, carrots and zucchini, and was like a
very delicate chicken salad.
And then, of course, there was dessert.
The waiter brought a plate with the six de
ssert selections, all of which looked marvel
ous. We finally settled on a pecan torte that
would make your grandma from Georgia
jealous. It was like pecan pie without the
goopy middle, just the crust and crisp pecan
topping. Also, a chocolate roulade, choco
late cake rolled around a cream, sugar and
butter filling that put the It's It to shame. The
last was a poppy seed cake for which the
restaurant is noted. It was a rich yellow cake
with a butter/cream cheese frosting that
tasted like Land O'Lakes could stay in busi
ness just with Greens. Marvelous!
The wine list was small but selected to
complement the food. Mostly white wines

are served, at a fairly reasonable price.
I suggest that you make reservations, and it
you don't like to wait, make them for before
noon or after 1:45 p.m. for lunch. When we
arrived at 11:45 a.m., there were ample tables
available, but as we left at 1:30 p.m., there
were at least 40 people waiting to be seated.
Further, plan on reaching Fort Mason
about 10 minutes early: the parking is terri
ble In the end, I was forced to park on the
opposite side of the harbor and walk back. I
could see my car from where we sat, but only
just. The restaurant is open for lunch all days
but Sunday and Monday, and serves dinner
only on Friday and Saturday. It is a wonderful
place for lunch, especially on clear days The
smoking section is small, so it's best to abs
tain.
They serve no meat at ail, so if you always
eat cow, and never eat quiche, you may be
disappointed, but try a tofu dish they do a
terrific job of disguising it.
The service? Courteous it somewhat re
served and inexperienced. They may drop
your tea pot, but ihey will do it quietly, with
no fuss, little mess, and probably without
breaking it.
A word? It's delovely!

liuhting. and plaved down the artificial lights

on the 25-foot ceiling.
The tables are rather close together, a fat t
which only became apparent as the dining
room began to fill. As we discussed the wea
ther in different parts of the country, the
couple at the next table leaned over to us to
share their views on the virtues of Troy, New
York, and the efficiencies of its mass trans
portation. An intelligent interjection
perhaps, but really!
The menu contains pasta, salad, cheese
and tofu dishes for the main part, all priced
between $4 and $8, all accompanied by a bas
ket of various breads from the Tassajara bak
ery, hot, made the same day.
We ordered the soup of the day, which was
a spicy cream of mushroom, dark and mar
velously thick with large mushroom pieces. It
complemented the bread well and made me
glad that I had ordered a salad.
We ordered three very different entrees.
The first was a Romaine and Avocado salad
with oil and lemon dressing. At $5.50 it was a
bit overpriced but delicious. The lettuce, av
ocados and black beans were very fresh and
cold and the salad was large.
The second was a broiled tofu sandwich.
The tofu was marinated in a soy and spice
sauce until the center was slightly darkened,
then erillod. Served on wheat bread with

horseradish and red cabbage cole slaw on the
side, it was extremely flavorful. The marinade
and grilling had almost completely overcome
the beany taste and texture of the tofu. It gave
the impression of an exotic turkey sandwich.
At $4, it was very reasonable.
The last of our main dishes was a tofu salad
($4.50). For this, the tofu had been mixed
with garlic, mustard, onion and other herbs
to give it a wonderful flavor. It was served
with Romaine lettuce, cucumbers, ripe
olives, carrots and zucchini, and was like a
very delicate chicken salad.
And then, of course, there was dessert.
The waiter brought a plate with the six de
ssert selections, all of which looked marvel
ous. We finally settled on a pecan torte that
would make your grandma from Georgia
jealous. It was like pecan pie without the
goopy middle, just the crust and crisp pecan
topping. Also, a chocolate roulade, choco
late cake rolled around a cream, sugar and
butter filling that put the It's It to shame. The
last was a poppy seed cake for which the
restaurant is noted. It was a rich yellow cake
with a butter/cream cheese frosting that
tasted like Land O'Lakes could stay in busi
ness just with Greens. Marvelous!
The wine list was small but selected to
complement the food. Mostly white wines

are served, at a fairly reasonable price.
I suggest that you make reservations, and it
you don't like to wait, make them for before
noon or after 1:45 p.m. for lunch. When we
arrived at 11:45 a.m., there were ample tables
available, but as we left at 1:30 p.m., there
were at least 40 people waiting to be seated.
Further, plan on reaching Fort Mason
about 10 minutes early: the parking is terri
ble In the end, I was forced to park on the
opposite side of the harbor and walk back. I
could see my car from where we sat, but only
just. The restaurant is open for lunch all days
but Sunday and Monday, and serves dinner
only on Friday and Saturday. It is a wonderful
place for lunch, especially on clear days The
smoking section is small, so it's best to abs
tain.
They serve no meat at ail, so if you always
eat cow, and never eat quiche, you may be
disappointed, but try a tofu dish they do a
terrific job of disguising it.
The service? Courteous it somewhat re
served and inexperienced. They may drop
your tea pot, but ihey will do it quietly, with
no fuss, little mess, and probably without
breaking it.
A word? It's delovely!

GREENS AT EORT MASON
Fort Mason
San Francisco
771-6222
And then came dessert. It was, in a word or
three, terrific, marvelous, delicious. It was
Greens.
The busiest establishment in San Francis
co's Fort Mason Center, Greens restaurant
offers a haven for the quiet diner. Not brash
and overpriced like some more well-known
tourist attractions, nor trendy and overpriced
like other fashionably chic places to be seen,
Greens coolly does what it does: serve very
good vegetarian food.
Operated by a Zen Buddhist sect, Greens is
something of a novelty. All the waiters are
members of the sect, and the profits from the
restaurant and the adjoining Tassajara Bread
Bakery are funelled into the sect. In this re
spect, it is rather curious, and explains,
perhaps, why the waiters do not appear to
enjoy their work particularly, at times appear
ing even morose in performing their duties.
The dining hall is situated on one of the
Fort Mason piers, with huge windows all
along the west wall looking out over the
Marina, Pacific Heights and the Golden Gate.
