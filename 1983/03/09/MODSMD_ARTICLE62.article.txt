FARMER'S MARKFT RESTAURANT

Fresh. Everything about Sunday brunch at the Farm
er's Market Restaurant was fresh.
Tucked away under an awning on California Avenue,
the Farmer's market is a classic California family-owned
restaurant. Owner Diana Holloway and two of her chil
dren opened shop tive years ago, and happily, they have
stayed in business.
The restaurant has a cheery, country atmosphere.
Large windows provide plenty of light; each table is
covered by a red gingham cloth and topped by fresh
flowers; small prints decorate the walls. One side is

lined by wood shelves filled with wine, the other by a
wooden bench which is more comfortable than it looks.
The servers — all female — do not wear matching
outfits as you find at most restaurants, but they all take
care to wear country-style clothes to complement the
decor.
The service was friendly and attentive. Delicious cof
fee was offered as soon as we sat down and we were
given re-fills periodically.
Sunday brunch atthe Farmer's Market i556.95. At first,
that may seem expensive — the family atmosphere
makes you think you might be getting your meal for free.
But when you see the size of the portions and quality of
the cooking, and compare the price with other Sunday
brunches, you realize it is almost a bargain.
Along with an entree, brunch includes a fresh fuit
salad cup, a choice of champagne, fresh squeezed
orange or grapefruit juice, or a Mimosa (half orange
juice, half champagne).
Since studying was planned for the afternoon, my
companion and I opted for the juices. They were sweet
and cool, as were the strawberries and chunks of
pineapple and melon in the fruit salad.
Another decision concerning liquids has to be made at
the Farmer's market. Customers may choose coffee, tea
or milk to accompany the meal.
That decision was easier than the one about entrees.
Of the 11 entrees, 10 are egg dishes and six of those are
omelets. The non-egg dish is a unique sounding French

toast, perfect for those who like rich food. It is described
as three slices of apple raisin bread, dipped in a whipped
cream batter and topped with banana slices.
I couldn't decide between the California omelet —
filled with a whole sliced avocado, jack and cream
cheese — and a speciality of the house, Steve's eggs.
Our waitress helped me make the decision; she said
Steve's eggs are more unique.
The mixture of ground sirloin, onions, fresh, leafy
spinach and scrambled eggs was superb. Though it may
not sound very thrilling, an unidentifiable assortment of
spices did the trick.
My brunching-partner had the eggs benedict, which
owner Holloway told us she thinks is the best in the area.
Though my companion said he could not back up that
statement because he has not tesled all the eggs benedict
in Palo Alto he did say they were delicious. He was
pleased by the freshness of the English muffin and
Canadian bacon, and the softness of the poached eggs.
His only complaint was that the Hollandaise sauce was
"a tad lemony.''
The egg dishes come with a hearty pile of thick slices
of home-fried potatoes, with the skin still on them. You
also get a choice of ten-grain toast, apple raisin toast or
Margan's morning muffin.
The muffin is whole wheat, made from buttermilk
batter with bananas, raisins and walnuts. I thought it was
delicious, and I don't even like raisins.
Along with the six omelets and a vegetarian version of

Steve's eggs, the Farmer's Market offers art entree c ailed
two eggs, for the conventional breakfast eater It in
cludes two eggs (obviously), prepared as you request,
and your choice of smoked ham or Canadian bacon.
For the small eater, a continental breaktast of a Mar
gan's morning muffin, orange or grapefruit juice and
coffee or tea is offered for $3. The young eater — under
12 — can opt for the $4.95 children's plate consisting of a
fruit cup, two slices of trench toast, home fried potatoes,
milk or juice.
If you already have a favorite spot for Sunday morn
ings or are not a brunch eater, then you should try the
Farmer's Market for breakfast or lunch Monday through
Saturday.
The breakfast menu features all of the entrees offered
for brunch, along with several less tilling alternatives
and another house speciality, whole wheat apple pan
cakes.
Several good-sounding hot and cold sandwiches and
salads comprise the lunch menu, along with homemade
soups and chili con carne. I plan to go on a Friday for the
Friday special: a grilled clam sandwich served with clam
chowder, New England or Manhatten style.
The service for breakfast and lunch at the Farmer's
Market is less formal — orders are placed and picked up
at the counter.
