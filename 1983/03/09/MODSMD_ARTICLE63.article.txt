GEORGE'S SPECIALTIES
3420 Balboa
San Francisco
752-4009
The Russian Revolution is considered to
be one of the most critical events of this
century. However, something else hap
pened in 1917 which is far more important
— this was the year that Angelina
Semenoff left Russia and began a pilgr i m
age which ended 32 years later with her
arrival in the United States.
For those of you who do not know
Semenoff, she is the Tsarina of the Kitchen
at George's Specialties in San Francisco. If
Semenoff had not decided to come to the
United States, then the citizens of the Bay
Area would have been deprived of the
finest Russian cuisine between here and
Leningrad.
Angelina Semenoff and her husband
George run their restaurant with a flair of
excitement that is rarely duplicated. The
result of their hard work is an exquisite
array of Russian delicacies which are sim
ply unparalleled. One word of caution,
however. The food at George's is very ad
dictive — I suffered from such intense
withdrawal symptoms that I was forced to
return the following night for another
meal:
George's Specialties does not exactly
reside in the hub of the city — it is
sandwiched in a residential section of
town on Balboa Avenue. As I walked
through the door and passed by the red-
curtains, I felt as though I was en
tering a private and secluded dining room.
The room is very small, only 11 tables, but
it is quaint and relaxing. The tables are
neatly arranged so that diners do not feel
crowded, and the candles on each
table add to the serenity of the surround
ings. The intimate atmosphere, coupled
with the classical music and the sound of
Russian voices coming from the kitchen,
transported me into the heart of Old
Mother Russia. My mind drifted out to
wards the Volga River and the Russian
countryside as the aroma of my blini
wafted into the dining room. You simply
have not experienced life until you've
tried a blini at George s Specialties. Unfor
tunately, things are complicated by the
fact that there are two blinis to choose
from — Makaroff's or Russian, I would
suggest ordering them both so that you
don't have to fret about making a decision.
The Russian Blini ($10) consists of two
light buckwheat pancakes covered with a
mound of sour cream, a large portion of
salmon and garnished with red salmon

caviar and green onions. The blini was so
beautifully prepared that I was hesitant to
take the first bite. However, the outstand
ing combination of the salmon and the
pancake eliminated my concern for artistic
presentation, and I promptly devoured
the entire blini without taking time to
breathe.
The Makaroff Blini ($8) is similar except
that it is served with pickled herring rather
than salmon. At this point, my stomach
was already purring with satisfaction, yet
this was only the beginning of my Russian
culinary odyssey.
Following the blini, we enjoyed a mar
velous bowl of Russian borsch. I often find
that borsch becomes uninteresting and
montonous after a few spoonfuls. The
wonderful blend of countless vegetables
along with the usual cabbage and beets
had me scraping the bottom of the bowl in
order to enjoy every drop.

The pilaf at George's is not
the common serving of limp
brown rice. Rather, it is an
exquisite mixture of rice,
oats, dried apricots, currants
and almonds, topping off
with some tasty seasonings -
guaranteed to please!

Our palates were then cleared by a
magnificent salad which was served in a
chilled bowl filled with fresh and crisp
leaves of lettuce, slices of cucumbers, and
wedges of tomatoes and beets. But the
salad is unique because of the dressing,
a fantastic, home-made Russian recipe
which defies description. I wish that I
could tell you more about it, but the recipe
is a secret which Semenoff will not di
vulge. She said the dressing is so outstand
ing that the fanciest restaurant in the area,
Chez Panisse of Berkeley, sends over their
finest chefs in order to decipher the key
ingredients. But, I don't think that they will
ever be able to recreate it, because they
will always lack the most important ingre
dient — Semenoff herself!
The entrees at George's Specialties are
just that — special. The Semenoffs are de
dicated to serving the very best — "Our
dinners are not pre-cooked. Your food is
freshly prepared when ordered. We be
lieve that true 'Russian style' home cook
ing is what our customers deserve." The

Beet Stroganoff ($l4 — includes bread,
soup, salad and dessert) was by tar the best
that I have ever tasted. It consisted of a
generous portion of succulent strips of
beet enveloped in a tasty cream sauce ahd
served with white rice and peas. The
Gruzinsky Shashlyk, "from the high
mountains of the Caucusus," offers an
ample number of lamb cubes marinated in
a wide variety of herbs and then grilled
with tomatoes, green peppers and onions.
The Shashlyk is accompanied by a side
order of pilaf which constitutes a meal in
itself. The pilaf at George's is not the
common serving of limp brown rice.
Rather, it is an exquisite mixture of rice,
oats, dried apricots, currants and al
monds, topped off with some tasty season
ings — guaranteed to please!
Chicken Kiev ($l6) and Chicken
Shashlyk ($l4) are also available. In addi
tion to fine regular entrees, George's of
fers eight special dinners which must be
ordered at least 24 hours in advance.
On the second night that I ate there, I
was treated to a serving of quail. What a
delight. For those of you who have never
tasted quail, this is the place to try them.
The quail was juicy and flavorful and
cooked with just the right amount of sea
soning so as not to overpower the delicate
flavor of the meat. I have been told that
Semenoff also makes excellent Kulibiaka
and she has promised me that I can try her
Pioroshki some time soon (more details
later.) For dessert, we were served some
thing which I have never had before; it is
called Cream. It is very difficult to de
scribe; it tastes a lot like whipped cream
except that it is a little sweeter and some
what heavier. The cream is served with a
topping which varies each night. I enjoyed
both the raspberry and the cranberry
sauces. I would recommend that you
finish off your meal with a demi-tasse of
Turkish coffee.
George's Specialties is a true dining de
light. Both Semenoffs take special care in
everything that they create. They are very
proud of their restaurant, as they should
be, for they produce superior quality
food; as Angelina says, "We serve no
junky stuff here." In addition, Angelina,
herself, is a real treasure. She reminds me
of my grandmother — jovial and fun
loving. She always comes out of the
kitchen to talk to the customers, and I
strongly urge you to make a point of talk
ing to this fascinating lady.

wedges of tomatoes and beets. But the
salad is unique because of the dressing,
a fantastic, home-made Russian recipe
which defies description. I wish that I
could tell you more about it, but the recipe
is a secret which Semenoff will not di
vulge. She said the dressing is so outstand
ing that the fanciest restaurant in the area,
Chez Panisse of Berkeley, sends over their
finest chefs in order to decipher the key
ingredients. But, I don't think that they will
ever be able to recreate it, because they
will always lack the most important ingre
dient — Semenoff herself!
The entrees at George's Specialties are
just that — special. The Semenoffs are de
dicated to serving the very best — "Our
dinners are not pre-cooked. Your food is
freshly prepared when ordered. We be
lieve that true 'Russian style' home cook
ing is what our customers deserve." The

Beet Stroganoff ($l4 — includes bread,
soup, salad and dessert) was by tar the best
that I have ever tasted. It consisted of a
generous portion of succulent strips of
beet enveloped in a tasty cream sauce ahd
served with white rice and peas. The
Gruzinsky Shashlyk, "from the high
mountains of the Caucusus," offers an
ample number of lamb cubes marinated in
a wide variety of herbs and then grilled
with tomatoes, green peppers and onions.
The Shashlyk is accompanied by a side
order of pilaf which constitutes a meal in
itself. The pilaf at George's is not the
common serving of limp brown rice.
Rather, it is an exquisite mixture of rice,
oats, dried apricots, currants and al
monds, topped off with some tasty season
ings — guaranteed to please!
Chicken Kiev ($l6) and Chicken
Shashlyk ($l4) are also available. In addi
tion to fine regular entrees, George's of
fers eight special dinners which must be
ordered at least 24 hours in advance.
On the second night that I ate there, I
was treated to a serving of quail. What a
delight. For those of you who have never
tasted quail, this is the place to try them.
The quail was juicy and flavorful and
cooked with just the right amount of sea
soning so as not to overpower the delicate
flavor of the meat. I have been told that
Semenoff also makes excellent Kulibiaka
and she has promised me that I can try her
Pioroshki some time soon (more details
later.) For dessert, we were served some
thing which I have never had before; it is
called Cream. It is very difficult to de
scribe; it tastes a lot like whipped cream
except that it is a little sweeter and some
what heavier. The cream is served with a
topping which varies each night. I enjoyed
both the raspberry and the cranberry
sauces. I would recommend that you
finish off your meal with a demi-tasse of
Turkish coffee.
George's Specialties is a true dining de
light. Both Semenoffs take special care in
everything that they create. They are very
proud of their restaurant, as they should
be, for they produce superior quality
food; as Angelina says, "We serve no
junky stuff here." In addition, Angelina,
herself, is a real treasure. She reminds me
of my grandmother — jovial and fun
loving. She always comes out of the
kitchen to talk to the customers, and I
strongly urge you to make a point of talk
ing to this fascinating lady.

GEORGE'S SPECIALTIES
3420 Balboa
San Francisco
752-4009
The Russian Revolution is considered to
be one of the most critical events of this
century. However, something else hap
pened in 1917 which is far more important
— this was the year that Angelina
Semenoff left Russia and began a pilgr i m
age which ended 32 years later with her
arrival in the United States.
For those of you who do not know
Semenoff, she is the Tsarina of the Kitchen
at George's Specialties in San Francisco. If
Semenoff had not decided to come to the
United States, then the citizens of the Bay
Area would have been deprived of the
finest Russian cuisine between here and
Leningrad.
Angelina Semenoff and her husband
George run their restaurant with a flair of
excitement that is rarely duplicated. The
result of their hard work is an exquisite
array of Russian delicacies which are sim
ply unparalleled. One word of caution,
however. The food at George's is very ad
dictive — I suffered from such intense
withdrawal symptoms that I was forced to
return the following night for another
meal:
George's Specialties does not exactly
reside in the hub of the city — it is
sandwiched in a residential section of
town on Balboa Avenue. As I walked
through the door and passed by the red-
curtains, I felt as though I was en
tering a private and secluded dining room.
The room is very small, only 11 tables, but
it is quaint and relaxing. The tables are
neatly arranged so that diners do not feel
crowded, and the candles on each
table add to the serenity of the surround
ings. The intimate atmosphere, coupled
with the classical music and the sound of
Russian voices coming from the kitchen,
transported me into the heart of Old
Mother Russia. My mind drifted out to
wards the Volga River and the Russian
countryside as the aroma of my blini
wafted into the dining room. You simply
have not experienced life until you've
tried a blini at George s Specialties. Unfor
tunately, things are complicated by the
fact that there are two blinis to choose
from — Makaroff's or Russian, I would
suggest ordering them both so that you
don't have to fret about making a decision.
The Russian Blini ($10) consists of two
light buckwheat pancakes covered with a
mound of sour cream, a large portion of
salmon and garnished with red salmon

caviar and green onions. The blini was so
beautifully prepared that I was hesitant to
take the first bite. However, the outstand
ing combination of the salmon and the
pancake eliminated my concern for artistic
presentation, and I promptly devoured
the entire blini without taking time to
breathe.
The Makaroff Blini ($8) is similar except
that it is served with pickled herring rather
than salmon. At this point, my stomach
was already purring with satisfaction, yet
this was only the beginning of my Russian
culinary odyssey.
Following the blini, we enjoyed a mar
velous bowl of Russian borsch. I often find
that borsch becomes uninteresting and
montonous after a few spoonfuls. The
wonderful blend of countless vegetables
along with the usual cabbage and beets
had me scraping the bottom of the bowl in
order to enjoy every drop.

The pilaf at George's is not
the common serving of limp
brown rice. Rather, it is an
exquisite mixture of rice,
oats, dried apricots, currants
and almonds, topping off
with some tasty seasonings -
guaranteed to please!

Our palates were then cleared by a
magnificent salad which was served in a
chilled bowl filled with fresh and crisp
leaves of lettuce, slices of cucumbers, and
wedges of tomatoes and beets. But the
