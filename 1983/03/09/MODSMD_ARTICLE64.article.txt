# Top-notch food at moderate prices

Few things in life are worth negotiating
one's car, in the midst of a torrential
downpour, over the hills of San Franciso and
around hundreds upon hundreds of dripping
wet parade-goers. However, if 12 months
from now, I eat out on the eve of Chinese
New Years, I would gladly come back to Li
ly's. A combination of unique atmosphere
and fabulous fare all at moderate prices make
this a dining experience not to be missed.
Either due to a mastertul design or some
sort of dimensional limitation, the dining
room at Lily's is extraordinary in itself. Essen
tially one long hall, it angles its way around
the perimeter of the building leaving a sepa
rate dining area each time the wall changes
direction.
Since you're never further than 10 feet
from a window, every seat commands a
panoramic view — ours included the Vai!lan
court fountain and the 480 freeway. (Scenes
vary.) One small disadvantage: although the
waitresses are very attractive to watch, cir
cumstances dictate they and the entire staff
traipse past one's table with regularity. In all
frankness, however, once the food arrived,
we were seldom distracted.
For appetizers, we debated over a list rang
ing from the extravagant: oysters on the half
shell to the more plebeian nachos, before
finally settling on french onion soup gratine
and the prawn and avocado cocktail. The
cocktail was pleasant enough but insubstan
tial, though not unexpectedly so. The soup
came covered with a toasted crouton and
melted cheese, and for more than aesthetic
reasons was just fabulous, highlighted by a
piquant broth with a lingering and exotic
flavor.
The menu features an equally wide spec
trum of entrees, including various seafoods,
red meat, poultry and pasta. In an attempt at
variety, our selections were the prawns a la
griglia (12.95) and chicken william (9.95). The
latter, a boneless breast sauteed with lemon,
marsala wine and mushrooms and topped
with mozzarella cheese was impeccable —
the sauce in particular was quite provocative.
When complimented with rice and a delight

lul array of sauteed vegetables, it was al! I
could do to keep my appetite in low gear.
rhe prawns a la girglia, though much ap
preciated across the table, were to me inher
ently disappointing, if only because I found
its appearance so decidedly unattractive.
Consisting of prawns broiled with butter, gar
lic and shallots, then tossed with spinach lin
guine and parmesan cheese, it's location
under the pasta" category was a clue
(though we failed to realize it at the time) to
the relative proportions of the two main in
gredients. The prawns were wonderful, but
when my friend had rather hastily devoured
them, she remarked that her plate now com
prised a meal somewhat akin to "raisin bran
without th«» raisins." In short, I would only
recommend this dish to big fans of spinach
linguine.
It seems that many restaurants include on
their dessert menu at least one option for
people with no respect for calories. Lily's
contribution is chocolate decadence ($3.25), a
sinful collaboration of fudge cake topped
with treshly whipped cream, flaked choco
late and a raspberry sauce. The description
suffices. The cheesecake ($2.95) was certainly
one of the richest we had ever tasted and
altogether heavenly.
Eating at Lily's is a dining experience as it
should be. Manager Rick Norman mentioned
that his restaurant strives to be at once "com
fortable yet elegant," which is as apt a de
scription as I can provide. The all-gray decor
strikingly modern, but not so much as to put
one on edge. The service was friendly,
prompt and attentive. In short, I shall soon
make the trip again. If you feel tempted, Lily's
is open every day but Sunday, and reserva
tions are certainly recommended.
One last note: The Lmbarcadero lends it
self ideally to various post-meal diversions —
Lily's itself incorporates a cafe and bar adja
cent to the dining room, suitable for an
after-dinner drink, or for those with strong
digestion, rock-and-roll dancing on Friday
evenings. A laudable alternative is only a
short walk away in the Hyatt Regency, where,
seven nights a week, you can sip $4 beers and
listen to Danny Yale (complete with toupee
and sparkling tuxedo) belt out your favorite
oldies on his violin, accompanied by the in
imitable Hyatt Regency Strings.

Few things in life are worth negotiating
one's car, in the midst of a torrential
downpour, over the hills of San Franciso and
around hundreds upon hundreds of dripping
wet parade-goers. However, if 12 months
from now, I eat out on the eve of Chinese
New Years, I would gladly come back to Li
ly's. A combination of unique atmosphere
and fabulous fare all at moderate prices make
this a dining experience not to be missed.
Either due to a mastertul design or some
sort of dimensional limitation, the dining
room at Lily's is extraordinary in itself. Essen
tially one long hall, it angles its way around
the perimeter of the building leaving a sepa
rate dining area each time the wall changes
direction.
Since you're never further than 10 feet
from a window, every seat commands a
panoramic view — ours included the Vai!lan
court fountain and the 480 freeway. (Scenes
vary.) One small disadvantage: although the
waitresses are very attractive to watch, cir
cumstances dictate they and the entire staff
traipse past one's table with regularity. In all
frankness, however, once the food arrived,
we were seldom distracted.
For appetizers, we debated over a list rang
ing from the extravagant: oysters on the half
shell to the more plebeian nachos, before
finally settling on french onion soup gratine
and the prawn and avocado cocktail. The
cocktail was pleasant enough but insubstan
tial, though not unexpectedly so. The soup
came covered with a toasted crouton and
melted cheese, and for more than aesthetic
reasons was just fabulous, highlighted by a
piquant broth with a lingering and exotic
flavor.
The menu features an equally wide spec
trum of entrees, including various seafoods,
red meat, poultry and pasta. In an attempt at
variety, our selections were the prawns a la
griglia (12.95) and chicken william (9.95). The
latter, a boneless breast sauteed with lemon,
marsala wine and mushrooms and topped
with mozzarella cheese was impeccable —
the sauce in particular was quite provocative.
When complimented with rice and a delight

lul array of sauteed vegetables, it was al! I
could do to keep my appetite in low gear.
rhe prawns a la girglia, though much ap
preciated across the table, were to me inher
ently disappointing, if only because I found
its appearance so decidedly unattractive.
Consisting of prawns broiled with butter, gar
lic and shallots, then tossed with spinach lin
guine and parmesan cheese, it's location
under the pasta" category was a clue
(though we failed to realize it at the time) to
the relative proportions of the two main in
gredients. The prawns were wonderful, but
when my friend had rather hastily devoured
them, she remarked that her plate now com
prised a meal somewhat akin to "raisin bran
without th«» raisins." In short, I would only
recommend this dish to big fans of spinach
linguine.
It seems that many restaurants include on
their dessert menu at least one option for
people with no respect for calories. Lily's
contribution is chocolate decadence ($3.25), a
sinful collaboration of fudge cake topped
with treshly whipped cream, flaked choco
late and a raspberry sauce. The description
suffices. The cheesecake ($2.95) was certainly
one of the richest we had ever tasted and
altogether heavenly.
Eating at Lily's is a dining experience as it
should be. Manager Rick Norman mentioned
that his restaurant strives to be at once "com
fortable yet elegant," which is as apt a de
scription as I can provide. The all-gray decor
strikingly modern, but not so much as to put
one on edge. The service was friendly,
prompt and attentive. In short, I shall soon
make the trip again. If you feel tempted, Lily's
is open every day but Sunday, and reserva
tions are certainly recommended.
One last note: The Lmbarcadero lends it
self ideally to various post-meal diversions —
Lily's itself incorporates a cafe and bar adja
cent to the dining room, suitable for an
after-dinner drink, or for those with strong
digestion, rock-and-roll dancing on Friday
evenings. A laudable alternative is only a
short walk away in the Hyatt Regency, where,
seven nights a week, you can sip $4 beers and
listen to Danny Yale (complete with toupee
and sparkling tuxedo) belt out your favorite
oldies on his violin, accompanied by the in
imitable Hyatt Regency Strings.
