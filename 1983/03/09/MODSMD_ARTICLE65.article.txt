## pollution control research strong, future funding uncertain 
### TO BENOIT 
H| Professors and students in the Civil and
Mechanical Engineering Departments here
arti actively pursuing a program of pollution
Control research. Under the chairmanship of
Prof. Perry McCarty, the Civil Engineering
is examining the basic biologi
cal and chemical processes in water, as well
as the physical properties of the water itself
in .relation to the behavior of pollutants. A
group of graduate students and researchers
hefaded by Mechanical Engineering Prof.
' Robert Eustis are working at the High Tem-
Hefrature Gas Dynamics Lab on engineering
problems related to air pollution.
The impact of a pollutant on a body of
water depends on the nature of the pollutant
and also on how it is distributed in the water
on-removed by slids or gases in contact with
thjp water. These factors determine whether
' aq'd how a substance is eventually rendered
harmless.
The Civil Engineering Department is work
ing on both heavy metal and organic conta
minants. Professors lames Leckie, Paul
Roberts and others are studying how these
contaminants are transferred to the non-
components of the environment.
ll'Leckie has been working with funding
Jrpm the Electric Power Research Institute
(EJ'RI) on the design of a pilot plant that will
remove heavy metals from wastewater by
adsorbing them onto ferrous oxide parti
cles. Such a system would be useful for elec
tric power and other industries. Leckie is
ajso at work on the development of mathe
matical models for the spread of heavy met
als in a body of water.
â€¢ Roberts is developing a system of "air
stripping" whereby organic contaminants
ajfe transferred to the air where they are rela
tively quickly broken down by sunlight.
: Another way in which organic contamin
ants are removed from the environment is

by biodegredation by microorganisms.
McCarty has been concerned with this
phenomenon for several years. He reports
that several contaminants previously
thought to be non-biodegradable may be
broken down if oxygen is excluded from the
bacterial environment. Some organic wastes
can be fermented to methane, an energy
source similar to natural gas and McCarly
and others are working with the Solar Energy
Research Institute on a plan to convert ag
ricultural wastes and forest residues into the
fuel.
While pollution in rivers and other surface
water has long been a concern, groundwater
pollution has been getting more attention
recently. Stanford researchers are especially
active in this area, working in cooperation
with the Environmental Protection Agency.
The environmental water research group
has been examining the dispersal of hazard
ous waste in groundwater.
Recent evidence indicates that many pes
ticides and industrial solvents are not trap
ped by the soil and hence may pass into
underground water supplies. In 1976 the re
search group began a project in conjunction
with the Santa Clara Valley Water District in
which treated wastewater from Palo Alto was
reinjected into the ground. The project ini
tiated an evaluation of both the effective
ness of wastewater treatment processes and
the feasibility of using reclaimed water as a
barrier against the intrusion of salt into
groundwater supply from the San Francisco
Bay.
In the field of air pollution control, re
searchers are seeking ways to reduce the
cost of removing fly-ash from the exhaust
gas of coal fired power plants. The ash, a
glass-like residue of the mineral matter that
makes up approximately 10 percent of the
composition of coal, is currently removed by
devices called electrostatic precipitators. In

these, a power plant's exhaust gas is passed
over a series of electrically charged plates.
Wires suspended between the plates have
the opposite charge and ionize the particles
in the gas stream which are then attracted to
the plates where they are held until shaken
down into hoppers by a mechanism that hits

the plates with a hammer. Although these
devices have been in use for around 80
years, the basic physical principles which
govern their action has only recently come
under study.
Mechanical Engineering Profs. Sydney
Self and Morton Mitchener and their co

workers are looking at the fluid dynamics of
the exhaust gases to discover the effects of
turbulence on the efficiency of a pre
cipitator. According to Self, the industry re
sponse to recent regulations increasing the
proportion of ash required to be removed
from power plant emissions from 95 percent
to 99.8 percent has been simply to increase
the sizeof the precipitators. At present these
devices are enormous and make up 10 per
cent of the cost of a coal-fired plant. Designs
which aim to reduce the effects of turbu
lence and increase the advantage to be
gained from other factors such as the shape
of the discharge wires could reduce the size
and hence the cost of the dust scrubbing
units by a factor of two or three.
In addition, increased efficiency could
promote the burning of low-sulfur coal
which had traditionally been difficult to
de-ash due to the high electrical resistance
of the low-sulfur smoke. The electrostatic
precipitators are used by processes besides
electrical generation. Eustis worked on a
similar device for a forest products company
and caused a visible decrease in emissions
from the plant.
Funding from the EPA and the National
Science Foundation, two major sources of
research funds for pollution control work
here have held fairly constant up to the pre
sent. Both agencies are suffering from
budget cutbacks however, and will probably
be forced to reduce funding in the near fu
ture. The 1984 federal budget may cut drasti
cally into environmental research, accord
ing to Leckie. The EPA's Office of Water Re
search and Technology has been eliminated
while the Office of Environmental Research
barely survives. The latter organization
funds nearly half of all environmental re
search.
Industrial sources of funding such as EPRI
often want to support only short term evalu

ation of engineering techniques, according
to Self. Leckie stated that industry is hesitant
to fund environmental research because the
findings sometimes result in stronger regu
lations being applied to industry. Other re
searchers warned that lack of long-term
funding could reduce the University's ability
to make committments to the Ph.D. stu
dents who will make up the next generation
of pollution control engineers.
The professors generally agree that pollu
tion is not out of control, but that it is an
ongoing problem which will become more
costly if it is ignored. Roberts asserted that
the cost of cleaning up groundwater pollu
tion is prohibitive. Thus it is essential that
the processes leading to contamination be
prevented. While the attitude toward un
derground pollution has long been "out of
sight, out of mind," people are beginning to
see below the tip of the iceberg.
According to Roberts, the incidents of
groundwater pollution in Santa Clara
County are probably not widespread and the
major problems have been located and con
tained. State and nationwide, the trend away
from tracking down isolated instances and
toward formulating a general survey of the
problem is encouraging even though be
tween one and 10 percent of groundwater
sources may already be contaminated, said
Roberts.
Leckie points out that the pollution prob
lem is in fact several problems. Each facet
must be handled in its own way. In some
areas, such as air pollution and surface was
ter pollution, the problem is well defined.
What remains is development of control
technology and an implementation policy.
McCarty notes that while there will probably
always be some waste to be discarded, we
are well on the way toward controlling the
worst problems, those that threaten human
life or the ecosystems as a whole.
