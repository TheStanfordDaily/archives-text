J The Mid-Peninsula Regional
(}pen Space District (MROSD)
ijj a relatively unknown public
agency yet it provides resi
dents with one of today's most
important and increasingly
scarce resources: room to
Hreathe.
|A public tax supported
agency, the District is charged
\Fith acquiring and preserving
nayland and foothill areas in an
dffort to protect the peninsu
la's natural environment, giv
ing residents some open space
in 1 which to escape the bustle of
ujban life.
*The District was established
i#1972 wtie'n Santa Clara
Cfcunty voters approved Prop
osition R-for Room to Breathe by
a?two to one margin. The refer
etid um was the culmination of
two years of organization and
grass roots politicking from a
cpre of conservationists from
civic groups such as the Com
mittee for Green Foothills and
the Palo Alto Civic League who
feared the "Los Angelization"
of the Mid-Peninsula. San
mateo county joined the Dis
trict in 1976.
2 The agency began its land
purchase program in 1974 with
tfie acquisition of the 393

Perham Ranch (today part of
the Rancho San Antonio Pre
serve) and currently owns and
manages 19 open space pre
serves totalling 13,000 acres,
the boundaries of the District
reach from San Carlos to Los
Gatos, and from Skyline
Boulevard to the San Francisco
Bay.
The ultimate goal of the
MROSD is to preserve a
greenbelt of open space land
stretching from one end of the
District to the other. They have
already aquired about half of
the areas deemed most critical
to the greenbelt.
The District receives a share
of the total property tax col
lected within the Santa Clara
and San Mateo counties in
order to finance its land acquis
itions and supports its 23-
member staff. In the fiscal year
1982-83, this will amount to a
total of $3.8 million, or the
equivalent of $10 a year to the
average homeowner. Accord
ing to the District, 80 percent of
the total will be spent on future
land acquisition. The MROSD
receives federal and state
grants and monies, and works
closely with the counties and
other gorups to acquire land.
"We've got to work coopera

tively," said Charlotte
McDonald, MROSD public
communication coordinator.
"If the greenbelt is going to be
preserved, it's going to be a
multi-agency project."
The District is governed by a
board of directors elected by
voters in each of seven geog
raphic wards within the Dis
trict. Each director is elected
for four years and represents
about 70,000 residents.
MROSD defines open space
as "land or water area that
either remains in its natural
state or is used for agriculture
or is otherwise undeveloped."
The District cites the mainte
nance of public safety through
the minimization of flood ero
sion, earthquakes and land
slides as an important service
of open space. In addition,
open space is used as a means
of shaping urban growth in
order to provide amore livable
environment for the public.
The District also attempts to
keep the natural and cultural
history of the land intact by
continuing original uses of the
land, such as grazing and crop
cultivation, and by the preser
vation of landmarks, geologic
features and historic buildings.
Visitors will not find

ballfields or barbeque pits
even at the most developed' of
the preserves. "There are a
couple of toilets but that's as
developed as we get," said
McDonald. "They're wilder
ness parks really."
McDonald added that al
though the agency is fre
quently asked to upgrade park
ing facilities (some of the areas
have little or no parking space,
and access to the preserves
may require a permit or special
directions), "We don't get a lot
of pressure to put in conven
tional county park facilities.
We live in such a busy,
crowded urban area that
people just want to get away.
They want to get back to na
ture."
The public is invited to use
the parks everyday, from dawn
to dusk for jogging, hiking,
birdwatching, picnicking or
horseback riding.
Nanette Flanko MROSD di
rector for the Palo Alto/East
Palo Alto area, said "People
don't find urban parks chal
lenging or quiet enough for
them. They don't want to be
troubled by sounds and smells
of urban development."
Hanko added that while not
everyone has time to use the

parks, "People like to know
they're there."
Many of the preserves have
well marked trails with guide
maps, and thereare 10 MROSD
rangers who patrol the pre
serves to assist and educate vis
itors. In addition the volunteer
docent program provides
guided hikes, tours and nature
study programs in some of the
preserves. One of the most
popular guided walks is the six
mile "Earthquake Walk" along
the San Andreas Fault Trail at
the Los Trancos Open Space
Preserve (Page Mill Road, five
miles south of Highway 280). A
guided tour leaves the parking
lot every Sunday at 2 p.m.
Monte Belle Preserve is the
largest of the preserves, en
compassing over 2600 acres. It
includes 12 miles of well
developed trails ranging from
gentle creekside pathways to
more strenuous hill climbing.
Detailed brochures guide vis
itors from "station to station"
describing vegetation pat
terns, geological features and
plant and animal life.
The most popular and most
"developed" of the District's
preserves is Rancho San An
tonio, located off Foothill Blvd.
in Los Altos.

Correction: The energy conservation article printed on the last
environment page incorrectly stated that the Energy Program
Office is saving about $850,000 on campus-wide lighting and that
engineering modifications have been completed in 17 academic
buildings. The EPO is spending about $850,000, and saving an
estimated $230,000 per year on lighting, and the 17 buildings
have only been selected for possible modifications.

J The Mid-Peninsula Regional
(}pen Space District (MROSD)
ijj a relatively unknown public
agency yet it provides resi
dents with one of today's most
important and increasingly
scarce resources: room to
Hreathe.
|A public tax supported
agency, the District is charged
\Fith acquiring and preserving
nayland and foothill areas in an
dffort to protect the peninsu
la's natural environment, giv
ing residents some open space
in 1 which to escape the bustle of
ujban life.
*The District was established
i#1972 wtie'n Santa Clara
Cfcunty voters approved Prop
osition R-for Room to Breathe by
a?two to one margin. The refer
etid um was the culmination of
two years of organization and
grass roots politicking from a
cpre of conservationists from
civic groups such as the Com
mittee for Green Foothills and
the Palo Alto Civic League who
feared the "Los Angelization"
of the Mid-Peninsula. San
mateo county joined the Dis
trict in 1976.
2 The agency began its land
purchase program in 1974 with
tfie acquisition of the 393

Perham Ranch (today part of
the Rancho San Antonio Pre
serve) and currently owns and
manages 19 open space pre
serves totalling 13,000 acres,
the boundaries of the District
reach from San Carlos to Los
Gatos, and from Skyline
Boulevard to the San Francisco
Bay.
The ultimate goal of the
MROSD is to preserve a
greenbelt of open space land
stretching from one end of the
District to the other. They have
already aquired about half of
the areas deemed most critical
to the greenbelt.
The District receives a share
of the total property tax col
lected within the Santa Clara
and San Mateo counties in
order to finance its land acquis
itions and supports its 23-
member staff. In the fiscal year
1982-83, this will amount to a
total of $3.8 million, or the
equivalent of $10 a year to the
average homeowner. Accord
ing to the District, 80 percent of
the total will be spent on future
land acquisition. The MROSD
receives federal and state
grants and monies, and works
closely with the counties and
other gorups to acquire land.
"We've got to work coopera

tively," said Charlotte
McDonald, MROSD public
communication coordinator.
"If the greenbelt is going to be
preserved, it's going to be a
multi-agency project."
The District is governed by a
board of directors elected by
voters in each of seven geog
raphic wards within the Dis
trict. Each director is elected
for four years and represents
about 70,000 residents.
MROSD defines open space
as "land or water area that
either remains in its natural
state or is used for agriculture
or is otherwise undeveloped."
The District cites the mainte
nance of public safety through
the minimization of flood ero
sion, earthquakes and land
slides as an important service
of open space. In addition,
open space is used as a means
of shaping urban growth in
order to provide amore livable
environment for the public.
The District also attempts to
keep the natural and cultural
history of the land intact by
continuing original uses of the
land, such as grazing and crop
cultivation, and by the preser
vation of landmarks, geologic
features and historic buildings.
Visitors will not find

ballfields or barbeque pits
even at the most developed' of
the preserves. "There are a
couple of toilets but that's as
developed as we get," said
McDonald. "They're wilder
ness parks really."
McDonald added that al
though the agency is fre
quently asked to upgrade park
ing facilities (some of the areas
have little or no parking space,
and access to the preserves
may require a permit or special
directions), "We don't get a lot
of pressure to put in conven
tional county park facilities.
We live in such a busy,
crowded urban area that
people just want to get away.
They want to get back to na
ture."
The public is invited to use
the parks everyday, from dawn
to dusk for jogging, hiking,
birdwatching, picnicking or
horseback riding.
Nanette Flanko MROSD di
rector for the Palo Alto/East
Palo Alto area, said "People
don't find urban parks chal
lenging or quiet enough for
them. They don't want to be
troubled by sounds and smells
of urban development."
Hanko added that while not
everyone has time to use the

parks, "People like to know
they're there."
Many of the preserves have
well marked trails with guide
maps, and thereare 10 MROSD
rangers who patrol the pre
serves to assist and educate vis
itors. In addition the volunteer
docent program provides
guided hikes, tours and nature
study programs in some of the
preserves. One of the most
popular guided walks is the six
mile "Earthquake Walk" along
the San Andreas Fault Trail at
the Los Trancos Open Space
Preserve (Page Mill Road, five
miles south of Highway 280). A
guided tour leaves the parking
lot every Sunday at 2 p.m.
Monte Belle Preserve is the
largest of the preserves, en
compassing over 2600 acres. It
includes 12 miles of well
developed trails ranging from
gentle creekside pathways to
more strenuous hill climbing.
Detailed brochures guide vis
itors from "station to station"
describing vegetation pat
terns, geological features and
plant and animal life.
The most popular and most
"developed" of the District's
preserves is Rancho San An
tonio, located off Foothill Blvd.
in Los Altos.

environment page incorrectly stated that the Energy Program
Office is saving about $850,000 on campus-wide lighting and that
