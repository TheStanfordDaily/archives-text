# Clean water act reauthorization causes controversy
## 
### VICKI MOORE 
Claiming that federal water pollu
tion control laws will place unneces
sary costs on industry, the Environ
mental Protection Agency (EPA), the
Chemical Manufacturers Association
(CMA) and others are proposing
changes to the federal Clean Water
Act. Two major points of contention
between environmental groups and
industry concern the current Best
Available Technology (BAT) and
waste pretreatment provisions. In
addition, EPA proposed changes to
allow less strict state water quality
standards is strongly opposed by en
vironmentalists.
Background
The Federal Water Pollution Con
trol Act (known as the Clean Water
Act) was passed in 1972, "to restore
and maintain the chemical, physical
and biological integrity of the na
tion's waters." It required
technology-based effluent limita
tions for various tvpes of discharges.
By 1977, all discharges were to
achieve the Best Practicable
Technology (BPT), defined as the av
erage of the best existing perform
ance by well-operated plants within
each industrial category. And by
1983, BAT, the best control and
treatment measures that have been
or are capable of being achieved,
would be required for all dischar
gers. The Act also provided that the
discharge of any pollutants is unlaw
ful unless permitted under the Na
tional Pollution Discharge Elimina
tion System permit program.
The Clean Water Act, which is
reauthorized every five years, was
modified in 1977 to require BAT only
for toxic substances and for indus
tries which discharge directly into
rivers, lakes and streams by mid
-1984. The toxic substances list in
cludes 129 specific materials referred
to as "priority pollutants," which are

presumed to cause serious health
dangers.
Also under the Clean Water Act,
states classify streams and lakes for
given uses â€” propagation of fish and
wildlife, swimming, industrial sup
ply, etc., and establish water quality
by criteria which define chemical and
physical parameters that will provide
the designated uses.
Controversies
In keeping with the national goals
of the Clean Water Act, most states
have designated virtually all their
streams and lakes for fishing and
swimming, even though many
bodies of water do not currently
meet water quality criteria for these
uses. Currently, the EPA is encourag
ing states to downgrade current
steam designations to less desirable
uses, relying on cost-benefit
analyses to justify relaxing state stan
dards, according to the Natural Re
sources Defense Council (NRDC).
The preamble to the EPA proposed
regulations states, "Water quality
standards (have been) set to provide
for (fishable, swimmable waters),
often without adequate analysis as to
whether the uses were attainable.
Agricultural or industrial uses which
may have been more appropriate as
the principle use, were usually re
jected as not meeting the require
ments of the Act. As a result, some
standards reflecting unreasonable
uses were adopted, which . . .
forced overly stringent and costly
treatment."
The NRDC states that these pro
posed changes are unnecessary, and
that states are allowed to make ex
ceptions to their waterway designa
tions in those cases where the at
tainment of the water quality goal
would cause substantial economic
hardship.
Industry spokesmen emphasize
the progress that has been made in

the reduction of water pollutants by
industry and state that unnecessary
requirements should be replaced
with regulations tailored to solve re
maining pollution problems in a
more cost-effective manner.
Jack Erickson, manager of the
editorial services for the CMA, said
that the Clean Water Act is directed
only at industry and municipalities,
while not controlling major sources
of pollution such as non-point runoff
from mining, forestry, pesticides and
urban development. "Only 6 to 8
percent of most sources of water pol
lutants are put in by industry," said
Erickson. According to a CMA re
port, "until these primarily non
industrial challenges are resolved,
more stringent controls on industry
will not result in appreciable gains in
water quality."
While NRDC Attorney, Alan Miller
agreed that non-point pollution was
a serious problem which must be
dealt with, "that doesn't get away
from the fact that toxic waste is highly
associated with industry, and causes
the biggest health problem."
Erickson pointed to a 1980 House
Public Works and Transportation
Subcommittee report which stated
that "The 129 priority pollutants . . .
are less evident in amount and con
centration than previously be
lieved," and the luly 1982 Business
Roundtable report stating that in
most cases, BPT accomplishes 60
percent to 95 percent removal of
priority pollutants, and reduces or
elimintes the presence of aquatic to
xicity in industrial discharges. "In
dustry has spent over $5 billion in the
last 10 years," said Erickson. "Mem
bers of the CMA were in 98 percent
compliance with the BPT standards
by 1978, and those standards have
worked very well, so why do we need
a whole new round of BAT?" he con
tinued.

Erickson suggested a modified BAT
system for toxics that would be
applied on a case by case basis. BAT
versus costs is not the issue. (The
CMA) doesn't think that best avail
able technology should be required
at a plant if it imposes substantial
new costs and is not going to im
prove water quality," he said.
Miller, however, said that a spe
cific agreement between the LPA and
the NRDC in l, and amended in
1979, states that when the EPA can
show that BAT technology will not
achieve further reductions and that
BPT is adequately controlling
effluents in specific cases, the BAT
standards will not be required. He
acknowledged that industry has
made much progress in decreasing
its pollutant discharge, but added
that much remains to be done. To
xics are still being dumped into the
nation's waters at a rate of 100 million
pounds per year, according to the
NRDC.
The CMA also states that the list of
toxic pollutants should be reviewed
and that each pollutant left off the list
should be "supported by a finding of
significant and unreasonable risk."
Erickson said that the EPA did not
consult scientific data when it listed
the toxic pollutants, but rather than
the list was a result of a "legal and
political agreement" between the
EPA and the NRDC who filed a law
suit in 1976. The CMA also states that
the "adequate margin of safety" re
quirement for determining toxic pol
lutant standards should be deleted
from the Act. Instead, the EPA should
be allowed to base effluent standards
on risk assessments.
Miller said that the priority pollut
ant list was drawn up with the best
evidence at the time and that the
CMA's denouncement of a margin of
safety was "an excuse for industry to
replace economic concerns with the

protection of public health."
Another point of contention con
cerns the pretreatment provisions of
the Clean Water Act. In urban areas,
industrial facilities frequently dis
charge into publicly owned treat
ment works (POTVVs), which have
permits under the NPEDS program.
The POTVVs treat industrial and
domestic wastes. Under the Act, dis
charges into POTWs from some in
dustries must meet national
technology -based pretreatment
standards. This is intended to pre
vent interference with the opera
tions of POTWs to guard against
passthrough of wastes that POTWs
are not able to treat and to prevent
sludge contamination.
The Chemical Manufacturer's As
sociation claims that the EPA, in de
veloping standards for the pretreat
ment program, neglected to con
sider how effectively publicly owned
treatment works can remove pollut
ants themselves.
"The waste mix discharge to
POTWs varies so widely that the
problems of interference and
passthrough are better addressed at
the state and local level, not feder
ally. Only in specific situations may
pretreatment be necessary to
achieve desired wafer quality,"
stated a CMA report.
The EPA also is aiming to change
the pretreatment program. The EPA
bill presented to Congress would
eliminate the EPA's obligation to es
tablish national categorical for the 30
major industrial categories that do
not yet have standards. Instead, the
EPA would be free to decide which, if
any, of these industries should be
subject to uniform national stan
dards. It also would eliminate the
EPA's obligation to enforce the four
existing categorical pretreatment
standards and eliminate all deadlines

for fcPA decision-making on tht:
categorical standards.
The most troubling EPA proposed
change to environmental groups is
one which they claim would allow
the EPA to grant both industries and
municipalities broad exemptions
from the pretreatment provisions.
In her testimony before the House
Subcommittee on Water Resources
in July, 1982, NRDC lawyer Frances
Dubrowski stated that community
plants are designed to treat conven
tional pollutants, not toxics. "Toxics
often pass through the plant, causing
the same health and environmental
damage as if they were dumped di
rectly into a waterway," she said. To
xics also can impair a plants treat
ment of industrial wastes as well as.
the much greater volume of commu
nity wastewaters, according to Dub
rowski. In addition, "POTWs experfc
ence a very high level of upsets antl
bypasses," she said. "When this oc
curs, raw toxic industrial wastes ar?
discharged to receiving streams, a
fact that argues for caution in relegat
ing treatment responsibility for toxic
pollutants to the POTW instead of
the industrial source."
The NRDC stated that the pre
treatment program is already quite
flexible. Of the 15,250 publicly
owned treatment plants nationwide,
only 2000 need to develop a pre
treatment program under current
federal regulations. These 2000
POTWs, however, handle approxi
mately 91 percent of the nation's in
dustrial flow to sewers, according to
Dubrowski. In addition, industry can
obtain relaxations of the standards
("removal credits") to the extent
they can demonstrate that the POTW
actually achieves incidental removal
of toxic pollutants, she said, thus av
oiding treatment for treatment's
sake.
