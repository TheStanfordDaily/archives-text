# Local recycling saves energy, landfill space

The University has one of the
most successful recycling pro
grams among college cam
puses, said Fred Beddall, ASSU
Recycling coordinator. Next
door, the municipal recycling
program in Palo Alto "is one of
the most comprehensive in
California," according to a re
port by the California Waste
Management Board.
Curbside programs, which
first began in Palo Alto, are
now operating in Marin
County, El Cerrito, Menlo
Park, Los Altos, Sunnyvale, Los
Altos Hills and Mountain View.
These programs have been
successful in these areas, ac
cording to Tim Flanagan, ad
ministrative coordinator of
Palo Alto recycling, because
"we are fortunate to have re
sponsible and concerned citi
zens and administration, and
private companies that are very
cooperative."
In the 1970s wake of Earth
Day and growing public en
vironmental concern, the city
of Palo Alto saw great potential
for recycling and tried several
pilot programs for drop-off and
curbside pick-up of recyclable
materials, according to Flana
gan. Funding from the Recy
cling Act of 1977 enabled Palo
Alto to set up the recycling cen

ter. and continued city support
keeps the program for
curbside pickup fully opera
tional. The service operates on
a weekly basis and accounts for
about 50 percent of the materi
als that are recycled at the cen
ter located on Embarcadero
Road.

The other half of the 5400
tons recycled yearly still arrive
by drop-off, according to
Flanagan. "This translates into
energy savings (for the 1980-81
curbside program only) of
15,429 million BTUss" â€” or
enough energy needed to heat

about 200 average size homes
in Palo Alto for a year. Mone
tary savings have been esti
mated at $6.14 per household
for 15,000 homes in a 1981 in
dependent report by the Re
sources Management Associa
tion.
Recycling saves between 20
percent of the energy needed
to make new glass to 95 per
cent of energy needed to make
aluminum products from raw
materials, according to Bed
dall.
The groundwork for the
University campus recycling
center was laid by a SWOPSI
class on solid waste recycling
in January 1978. Initi'al funding
came from four student fee as
sessments which allowed stu
dents to set up the center on
Pampas Lane, complete with a
truck, shed and hydraulic
bailer, according to Beddall.
The University donated the
site, paved and fenced it.
Since its recent beginnings,
the program has expanded
from student dorm pickups of
aluminum, glass and newspa
per, to office pickup of com
puter paper, white and colored
ledger paper and photo lab
pick-up of silver. Waste oil re
cycling is done on a drop-off
basis.
ASSU Recycling recycled 830

tons of materials last year, and
projects a 15 percent to 20 per
cent increase this year, accord
ing to Beddall. Paid student
employees pick up 500 barrels
from over 150 buildings on
campus every week. The mate
rials are brought to the recy
cling center where they are
hand sorted and packaged for
transport to various com
panies. Sales of these materials
grossed $35,000 last year, ac
cording to Beddall. The $35,000
is about 70 percent of the
$50,000 in costs the ASSU pro
gram incurs. This leaves a
$15,000 per year deficit. Bed
dall points out, however, that
recycling materials saves $6000
per year which would have
been paid to Palo Alto to use
the dump and contract costs to
private companies for garbage
pickup.
In light of these avoided
costs, the University has ver
bally agreed to support the re
cycling effort by providing
about one-third of the fixed
costs of garbage pickups, or
about $12,000 per year, accord
ing to Beddall.
All in all, recycling means
savings in raw materials, en
ergy, pickup and dumping
costs and landfill space. Palo
Alto and Stanford recycling
programs reduce the load of

garbage in landfills by 250 to
300 tons per month, according
to Russ Reiserer, supervisor of
the Palo Alto Refuse Disposal
Area. Palo Alto dumped 79,832
cubic yards into the fill last
year, while Stanford contrib
uted 7822, according to Rei
serer. Although the Palo Alto
dump will probably remain

open for another 19 years, sev
eral other area dumps will be
closing soon, including Marsh
Road in 1984, Sunnyvale in 1987
and Burlingame in 1985. Land
fill space in the Peninsula is be
coming more and more scarce
as suitable open land disap
pears.
When landfill dumps are

closed, they are covered with a
layer of soil, trees are planted
and the area becomes a public
park. The Palo Alto dump is al
ready planning for this conver
sion, and Reiserer said that a
new program in conjunction
with Palo Alto Recycling has
been initiated to do curbside
pickup of garden debris.
