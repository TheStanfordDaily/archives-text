## Stanford's mathletes make computer know-how into profit 
### CRAIG LaGROW 
Computers and business are
two subjects that go well to
gether for some ambitious stu
dent entrepreneurs here at
Stanford. By converting their
dormitory rooms into small
computer companies, these
students are making big money
selling their software to Silicon
Valley firms.
Perhaps most symbolic of
this new generation of student
entrepreneurs is Mike Boone,
21, a senior majoring in petro
leum engineering.
His company, The Boone
Corporation, went into busi
ness last |une with the initial
investment of $75,000 by an
"anonymous wealthy indi

vidual" who Boone knew be
fore he came to Stanford. Since
that time, his company has
grown to over $1 million in
gross revenues. And Boone
now employs 26 fellow Stan
ford students.
"My philosophy is that if you
hire talented people who want
to work hard and enjoy what
they're doing, and if you treat
them like independent con
tractors, your company can't
possibly fail," said Boone.
Working in his dorm room
office headquarters, Boone
meets informally with his stu
dent programmers, some of
whom are Ph. D.sand graduate
students who, according to
Boone, "gave up some pretty

attractive career options to
have the freedom to work in a
small company like mine."
The Boone Corporation
made its first financial success
with the development of a
three-dimensional video game
program that recreates the ex
perience of playing golf at the
Pehble Beach Country Club.
Every sand dune, tairway and
lake is depicted on the video
screen in the exact location as
in the original golf course.
With the previous success of
the video golf game behind
him, Boone now has plans to
sell eight other computer pro
grams which range from busi
ness to medical software.
"All you have to do to sell

software is find a small vertical
market and monopolize it with
a software program that suits
its needs," he said. "That's
how the golf game worked;
you wouldn't believe how
many country clubs across the
country are going wild over it."
When asked to describe
what it's like to start his own
company, Boone replied, "I'm
an extremely hyperactive high
achiever who loves to sell
things; I could sell an Eskimo a
refrigerator, easy."
"I think I've gone through
about four weird phases to get
to the point where I am now.
After the initial 'idea phase,'
there came a phase where I had
to develop the stamina and
courage to do all the grunt
work needed. Then came the
'super-hard work phase,' fol
lowed by the 'maturity phase,'
which I've only recently en
tered."
Another student entrepre
neur, whose success story is no
less impressive than Boone's,
is ]ohn Halamka, age 20, who
recently founded Colossus
Computers, a computer hard
ware and software company
that grossed $100,000 last year.
He works out of a basement,
in the home of the late Freder
ick Terman, a man famed as the
father of Silicon Valley. Ac
cording to Halamka, "running
a computer company is a lot
more fun that classes, not to
mention more profitable."
Named after D.F. Jones's
novel on the first computer to
run the Earth, his computer
systems greet users with an
audible "This is the voice of
Colossus."
A senior majoring in political
science, public policy and
medical microbiology,

Malamka has done computer
programming for economists
Arthur Laffer and Milton
Friedman, and physicist Ed
ward Teller. One of his latest
clients is McGraw-Hill, Inc.
Former staff editor of the
Chaparral, Halamka now has 20
computer customers and car
ries a full academic course
load.
Terman's descendants have
also asked Halamka to write a
biography of Terman's life.
Halamka is just one of the
many Stanford students who
are now finding that, with
enough energy and insight,
they can become their own
bosses.
This is certainly the case with

Gary Retelny, a second year
Stanford MBA student who re
cently started a software com
pany called Exemplary
Software, Inc.
Retelny is selling a computer
program called Rank Master,
which makes investment deci
sions for businesses and indi
viduals based on the financial
data that can be input into
home or business computers.
So far, Retelny's company
has sold 25 separate software
programs (priced at $200 each).
"We sold that many without
even trying that hard," he
said .
Retelny believes that devel
oping a good marketing strat
egy is essential to selling com

puter software. "Ideas are a
dime a dozen. It's the effort
behind the idea that really
counts," he said.
Retelny sees his company's
main competition coming from
what he calls the "four major
software houses in the United
States (VisiCorp, Microsoft,
Digital Research and Micro -
robe)."
"These software giants are
gobbling up little independent
companies like ours and pay
ing only a reasonable fee for
the original ideas we develop,"
he said. Retelny is hoping,
however, that his Rank Master
software program will sell well
enough that his company will
not have to "sell out.
