Military aid for El Salvador may double
Washington — President Reagan told congressional lead
ersyesterdaythattheadministration mayseek Si 10million in
additional military aid for El Salvador, rather than the $60 mil
lion it had discussed earlier.
Most of the extra $50 million apparently would be
earmarked for greatly expanded training of Salvadoran
forces at Fort Bragg, N.C., in order to ease public and con
gressional concern that Reagan might send large numbers of
new American military advisers to El Salvador. However, ac
cording to U.S. officials, bringing the Salvadorans to this
country could cost as much as 10 times more than training
them there.
The new aid approach was disclosed as leaders told Rea
gan that Congress probably will accede reluctantly to his re
quest for more funds, but only if he agrees to conditions.

These include ensuring that no U.S. military personnel are
sent into combat situations and making a greater effort to
work out a political and diplomatic solution to the
Salvadoran conflict rather than seeking only a military vic
tory.
"We will not Americanize this conflict," Reagan was
quoted as saying aboard Air Force One as he flew to Orlan
do, Fla., Tuesday, in an effort at reassurance. In an apparent
bow to the congressional concerns, he and other U.S. of
ficials also took what sounded like a more flexible approach
toward negotiations between the Salvadoran government
and its rebel opponents.
However, despite Reagan's stress on seeking a "common
course" with Congress toward Central America, leaders of
both parties who attended a White House meeting with the
president and his top advisers earlier yesterday were put on

notice that the price tag for consensus might be almost
double what the administration originally asked for.
House committee approves freeze
Washington — The House Foreign Affairs Committee yes
terday brushed off last-minute appeals from President Rea
gan's arms controllers and approved 27 to 9 a non-binding
resolution calling on the United States and Soviet Union to
negotiate an "immediate, veiifiable and mutual freeze" on
nuclear weapons.
The freeze proposition, which Reagan has said would lock
the United States into an inferior military position and un
dercut U.S. negotiators at the arms talks in Geneva, is ex
pected to go to the House floor next week, and is thought
likely to pass there.
It then will go to the Republican-controlled
Senate, where it is thought likely to die.
But even approval in the House — where the
freeze last year failed 204 to 202, but where
Democrats since have gained 26 seats — would
be a blow to the president and would hearten
members seeking to cut the defense budget. "A
repudiation of Reagatomics," pro-freeze Rep.
Edward Markey (D-Mass.) called it Tuesday.
The administration's continued opposition to
the freeze was reflected in telegrams from Rea
gan's negotiators at Geneva, Gen. Edward
Rowny and Paul Nitze. They were read at the
start of the bill's discussion. The freeze resolu
tion "would seriously undermine our ability to
negotiate an equitable agreement with the So
viets," Nitze said.
But pro-freeze committee Chairman Cle
ment Zablocki (D-Wis.) said the resolution was
not "boat rocking," calling it a legitimate effort
to influence administration policy on arms con
trol.
Reagan says U.S. to triumph
Orlando — President Reagan sharply stepped
up his campaigns for increased defense spend
ing and against a nuclear freeze yesterday, tell
ing a group of evangelical ministers that
"simple-minded appeasement or wishful think
ing about our adversaries is folly,"
In a speech to the National Association of
Evangelicals, in which he also reaffirmed his
positions on abortion, prayer in schools and
birth control for teen-age girls, Reagan urged
the ministers "to speak out against those who
would place the United States in a position of
military and moral inferiority."
The president plainly was moving in his
speech to re-energize the conservative base of
support that helped elect him. He said proudly
that his administration's "respect for the rule of
law under God" leaves it"in opposition to, or at
least out of step with, a prevailing attitude of
many who have turned to a modern day secular
ism, discarding the tried and time-tested values
upon which our very civilization is based."
One example, he said, was the so-called
"squeal rule," under which the administration
has moved to require that parents be notified
when girls under 18 receive prescription birth
control devices from federally funded clinics.
' I've watched TV panel shows discuss rhis is
sue," the president sa:d "have read columnists
pontificating cn our error, but no one seems to
mention morality as playing a part in the subject
of sex. is ali of Judeo-Christian tradition
wrong?"
He said, "The fight against parental notifica
tion is really only one example of many at
tempts to water down traditional values and
even abrogate the original terms of American
democracy."
The president then went on to note his sup
port for prayer in schools and his. opposition to
abortion. He spoke out as well against racism
and anUsem\\\sm in his list of essentially moral
issues, then shifted to foreign policy and his
view of the Soviet Union as an "evil empire."
"I believe we can rise to the challenge" of the
Soviet threat, the president said. "I believe that
communism is another sad, bizarre chapter in
human history whose last pages even now are
being written. I believe this because the source
of our strength in the quest for human freedom
is not material but spiritual. And because it
knows no limitation, it must terrify and ul
timately triumph over those who would enslave
their fellow man."
Occidental to run huge mine
Peking — In a deal expected to yield at least
$600 million in annual revenue, Occidental Pe

troleum Corp. signed an agreement with China
yesterday to develop and jointly operate what
could become the world's largest open-pit coal
mine.
In agreeing to share the costs and profits of
the vast mine in central China — its proven re
serves are said to reach 1.4 billion tons of coal —
Peking has undertaken its most ambitious joint
venture since foreign investment again became
a possibility here in 1979.
Western diplomats said the deal is a harb
inger of possibly extensive American private in
vestment in China's energy sector as this coun
try moves to exploit its rich oil and hydroelec
tric resources.
Occidental Chairman Armand Hammer, who
pioneered American business dealings in the
Soviet Union decades ago, signed the coal
agreement in Peking,about 300 mileseastof the
Shanxi Province site where the mine is located.
In announcing the agreement, the state-run
New China News Agency said the project will
produce 15 million tons of coal yearly.
Hammer, whose firm performed a feasibility
study on the mine last year, has predicted that
output eventually will reach 45 million tons a
year.
(A Commerce Department specialist in Wash
ington said such an output unquestionably
would be the world's largest. He put the biggest
U.S. mine at about 16 million tons and the larg
est in West Germany at about 30 million. Both
offer a lower grade of coal than the bituminous
at the Chinese site, the official said, adding that
the limiting factor on Chinese production re
mains transportation of the coal.
Plans call for mine construction to begin im
mediately, with production starting in 1985.
Most of the coal is to be exported to japan, with
the rest being used by China in its domestic in
dustries, according to officials.
Shamir calls for compromise
Jerusalem — Foreign Minister Yitzhak
Shamir, who is to travel to Washington on Fri
day for possibly critical meetings on the troop
withdrawal negotiations with Lebanon, re
portedly said yesterday that Israel must com
promise in the talks if it is to have any hope of
winning a Syrian troop withdrawal.
Israeli radio reported last night that Shamir
told a closed session of the Knesset (parliament)
foreign affairs and defense committee that Is
raeli and Lebanese negotiators are exploring
•he possibility of Israel' Lebanese and U.S.
troops patrolling a "security zone in southern
Lebanon after a troop withdrawal.
Shamir's remarks were the most concrete in
dication yet that Israel is looking for a way to
drop its demand that tive israeii-manned ob
servation posts" be established in the security
zone as part of a troop-withdrawal accord. It
was also a suggestion that American troops,
now confined to the Beirut area as part of the
multinational force, couid become involved in
patrolling the Israeli-Lebanese border.
Shamir's reference to Syria was also an ac
knowledgment of the difficulty of Israel's nego
tiating position until now in demanding the
right to maintain a residual military force in
southern Lebanon while expecting Lebanon to
gain agreement for a complete withdrawal of
Syrian and Palestinian troops from other parts
of the country. „
Burford makes job pitch
Washington — Environmental Protection
Agency Administrator Anne Burford made an
emotional appeal to a group of conservative
Republican activists 10 days ago to urge Presi
dent Reagan to keep her on the job, GOP
sources said yesterday.
Burford made the appeal to the Western
States Political Caucus, a group of party officials

and organizers from Western states who
worked for Reagan's election in 1980. One
source who attended the Feb. 26 closed-door
meeting in Denver said Burford was visibly
shaken as she sought support.
It could not be learned whether her appeal
had any direct result. But a week later Reagan
told aides that he was unwilling to fire Burford
and said she can keep her job as long as she
wants to. Senior Reagan aides have been seek
ing Burford's removal because they say they be
lieve she has become a serious political liability.
Burford received public support this week
from Interior Secretary James Watt, who said in
a speech in San Antonio that she is "taking
abuse that no public servant should have to en
dure." But Sen. Alfonse D'Amato (R-N.Y.) yes
terday joined other congressional Republicans
calling for Burford's resignation.
Meanwhile, congressional Democrats in
vestigating the EPA have been told that some
documents they are seeking may have been de
stroyed or removed from agency files, and that
a senior EPA official may have ordered erasures
of items on his appointment calendars after
they were requested.
Oil tax rise proposed
Washington — Federal Reserve Chairman
Paul Volcker proposed yesterday that Congress
raise energy taxes if oil prices plunge below $25
a barrel, absorbing some of the savings for con
sumers to reduce federal budget deficits
projected at $200 billion or more in 1984 and
beyond.
Volcker made the suggestion in con
gressional testimony as both the House and
Senate Budget committees intensified their
search for revenue-raising measures before
they draw up their alternatives to President
Reagan's spending plan for the 1984 fiscal year.
"The case is quite compelling" for a tem
porary new tax on oil of up to $5 a barrel if world
petroleum prices continue to fall sharply,
Volcker told the House panel.
Imposing a $5 levy on a barrel of oil would in
crease gasoline taxes by about 12 cents a gallon,
industry officials have estimated. Although
Volcker frequently has exhorted Congress to
reduce spending in order to bring down record
deficits, he rarely makes an explicit suggestion
for budget cuts or revenue-raising measures.
"A deep decline in oil prices would suggest
early re-xamination of the case for energy tax
es." Volcker said in his testimony. "One possi
bility would be to oring forward the kind of oil
tax proposed by tne aministration on a standby
basis in fiscal (year) 1986."
Reagan proposed a standby tax increase, in
cluding a IS a-barrel increase in oil taxes, but
recommended that it rake effect in October
1985 — when the 1986 fiscal year begins — only
if deficits remained above the $100 billion level
and the economy was expanding.

Shamir calls for compromise
Jerusalem — Foreign Minister Yitzhak

Israeli radio reported last night that Shamir
told a closed session of the Knesset (parliament)
foreign affairs and defense committee that Is

zone as part of a troop-withdrawal accord. It
was also a suggestion that American troops,
now confined to the Beirut area as part of the

patrolling the Israeli-Lebanese border.
Shamir's reference to Syria was also an ac

Burford makes job pitch
Washington — Environmental Protection
Agency Administrator Anne Burford made an
emotional appeal to a group of conservative
Republican activists 10 days ago to urge Presi
dent Reagan to keep her on the job, GOP
sources said yesterday.
Burford made the appeal to the Western
States Political Caucus, a group of party officials

and organizers from Western states who
worked for Reagan's election in 1980. One
source who attended the Feb. 26 closed-door
meeting in Denver said Burford was visibly
shaken as she sought support.
It could not be learned whether her appeal
had any direct result. But a week later Reagan
told aides that he was unwilling to fire Burford
and said she can keep her job as long as she
wants to. Senior Reagan aides have been seek
ing Burford's removal because they say they be
lieve she has become a serious political liability.
Burford received public support this week
from Interior Secretary James Watt, who said in
a speech in San Antonio that she is "taking
abuse that no public servant should have to en
dure." But Sen. Alfonse D'Amato (R-N.Y.) yes
terday joined other congressional Republicans
calling for Burford's resignation.
Meanwhile, congressional Democrats in

documents they are seeking may have been de
stroyed or removed from agency files, and that
a senior EPA official may have ordered erasures
of items on his appointment calendars after
they were requested.
Oil tax rise proposed
Washington — Federal Reserve Chairman
Paul Volcker proposed yesterday that Congress
raise energy taxes if oil prices plunge below $25
a barrel, absorbing some of the savings for con
sumers to reduce federal budget deficits
projected at $200 billion or more in 1984 and
beyond.
Volcker made the suggestion in con
gressional testimony as both the House and
Senate Budget committees intensified their
search for revenue-raising measures before
they draw up their alternatives to President
Reagan's spending plan for the 1984 fiscal year.
"The case is quite compelling" for a tem
porary new tax on oil of up to $5 a barrel if world
petroleum prices continue to fall sharply,
Volcker told the House panel.
Imposing a $5 levy on a barrel of oil would in
crease gasoline taxes by about 12 cents a gallon,
industry officials have estimated. Although
Volcker frequently has exhorted Congress to
reduce spending in order to bring down record
deficits, he rarely makes an explicit suggestion
for budget cuts or revenue-raising measures.
"A deep decline in oil prices would suggest
early re-xamination of the case for energy tax
es." Volcker said in his testimony. "One possi
bility would be to oring forward the kind of oil
tax proposed by tne aministration on a standby
basis in fiscal (year) 1986."
Reagan proposed a standby tax increase, in
cluding a IS a-barrel increase in oil taxes, but
recommended that it rake effect in October
1985 — when the 1986 fiscal year begins — only
if deficits remained above the $100 billion level
and the economy was expanding.

Military aid for El Salvador may double
Washington — President Reagan told congressional lead
ersyesterdaythattheadministration mayseek Si 10million in
additional military aid for El Salvador, rather than the $60 mil
lion it had discussed earlier.
Most of the extra $50 million apparently would be
earmarked for greatly expanded training of Salvadoran
forces at Fort Bragg, N.C., in order to ease public and con
gressional concern that Reagan might send large numbers of
new American military advisers to El Salvador. However, ac
cording to U.S. officials, bringing the Salvadorans to this
country could cost as much as 10 times more than training
them there.
The new aid approach was disclosed as leaders told Rea
gan that Congress probably will accede reluctantly to his re
quest for more funds, but only if he agrees to conditions.

These include ensuring that no U.S. military personnel are
sent into combat situations and making a greater effort to
work out a political and diplomatic solution to the
Salvadoran conflict rather than seeking only a military vic
tory.
"We will not Americanize this conflict," Reagan was
quoted as saying aboard Air Force One as he flew to Orlan
do, Fla., Tuesday, in an effort at reassurance. In an apparent
bow to the congressional concerns, he and other U.S. of
ficials also took what sounded like a more flexible approach
toward negotiations between the Salvadoran government
and its rebel opponents.
However, despite Reagan's stress on seeking a "common
course" with Congress toward Central America, leaders of
both parties who attended a White House meeting with the
president and his top advisers earlier yesterday were put on

notice that the price tag for consensus might be almost
double what the administration originally asked for.
House committee approves freeze
Washington — The House Foreign Affairs Committee yes
terday brushed off last-minute appeals from President Rea
gan's arms controllers and approved 27 to 9 a non-binding
resolution calling on the United States and Soviet Union to
negotiate an "immediate, veiifiable and mutual freeze" on
nuclear weapons.
The freeze proposition, which Reagan has said would lock
the United States into an inferior military position and un
dercut U.S. negotiators at the arms talks in Geneva, is ex
pected to go to the House floor next week, and is thought
likely to pass there.
It then will go to the Republican-controlled
Senate, where it is thought likely to die.
But even approval in the House — where the
freeze last year failed 204 to 202, but where
Democrats since have gained 26 seats — would
be a blow to the president and would hearten
members seeking to cut the defense budget. "A
repudiation of Reagatomics," pro-freeze Rep.
Edward Markey (D-Mass.) called it Tuesday.
The administration's continued opposition to
the freeze was reflected in telegrams from Rea
gan's negotiators at Geneva, Gen. Edward
Rowny and Paul Nitze. They were read at the
start of the bill's discussion. The freeze resolu
tion "would seriously undermine our ability to
negotiate an equitable agreement with the So
viets," Nitze said.
But pro-freeze committee Chairman Cle
ment Zablocki (D-Wis.) said the resolution was
not "boat rocking," calling it a legitimate effort
to influence administration policy on arms con
trol.
Reagan says U.S. to triumph
Orlando — President Reagan sharply stepped
up his campaigns for increased defense spend
ing and against a nuclear freeze yesterday, tell
ing a group of evangelical ministers that
"simple-minded appeasement or wishful think
ing about our adversaries is folly,"
In a speech to the National Association of
Evangelicals, in which he also reaffirmed his
positions on abortion, prayer in schools and
birth control for teen-age girls, Reagan urged
the ministers "to speak out against those who
would place the United States in a position of
military and moral inferiority."
The president plainly was moving in his
speech to re-energize the conservative base of
support that helped elect him. He said proudly
that his administration's "respect for the rule of
law under God" leaves it"in opposition to, or at
least out of step with, a prevailing attitude of
many who have turned to a modern day secular
ism, discarding the tried and time-tested values
upon which our very civilization is based."
One example, he said, was the so-called
"squeal rule," under which the administration
has moved to require that parents be notified
when girls under 18 receive prescription birth
control devices from federally funded clinics.
' I've watched TV panel shows discuss rhis is
sue," the president sa:d "have read columnists
pontificating cn our error, but no one seems to
mention morality as playing a part in the subject
of sex. is ali of Judeo-Christian tradition
wrong?"
He said, "The fight against parental notifica
tion is really only one example of many at
tempts to water down traditional values and
even abrogate the original terms of American
democracy."
The president then went on to note his sup
port for prayer in schools and his. opposition to
abortion. He spoke out as well against racism
and anUsem\\\sm in his list of essentially moral
issues, then shifted to foreign policy and his
view of the Soviet Union as an "evil empire."
"I believe we can rise to the challenge" of the
Soviet threat, the president said. "I believe that
communism is another sad, bizarre chapter in
human history whose last pages even now are
being written. I believe this because the source
of our strength in the quest for human freedom
is not material but spiritual. And because it
knows no limitation, it must terrify and ul
timately triumph over those who would enslave
their fellow man."
Occidental to run huge mine
Peking — In a deal expected to yield at least
$600 million in annual revenue, Occidental Pe

troleum Corp. signed an agreement with China
yesterday to develop and jointly operate what
could become the world's largest open-pit coal
mine.
In agreeing to share the costs and profits of
the vast mine in central China — its proven re
serves are said to reach 1.4 billion tons of coal —
Peking has undertaken its most ambitious joint
venture since foreign investment again became
a possibility here in 1979.
Western diplomats said the deal is a harb
inger of possibly extensive American private in
vestment in China's energy sector as this coun
try moves to exploit its rich oil and hydroelec
tric resources.
Occidental Chairman Armand Hammer, who
pioneered American business dealings in the
Soviet Union decades ago, signed the coal
agreement in Peking,about 300 mileseastof the
Shanxi Province site where the mine is located.

additional military aid for El Salvador, rather than the $60 mil
lion it had discussed earlier.
Most of the extra $50 million apparently would be
earmarked for greatly expanded training of Salvadoran
forces at Fort Bragg, N.C., in order to ease public and con
gressional concern that Reagan might send large numbers of
new American military advisers to El Salvador. However, ac
cording to U.S. officials, bringing the Salvadorans to this
country could cost as much as 10 times more than training
them there.
The new aid approach was disclosed as leaders told Rea
gan that Congress probably will accede reluctantly to his re
quest for more funds, but only if he agrees to conditions.

These include ensuring that no U.S. military personnel are
sent into combat situations and making a greater effort to
work out a political and diplomatic solution to the
Salvadoran conflict rather than seeking only a military vic
tory.
"We will not Americanize this conflict," Reagan was
quoted as saying aboard Air Force One as he flew to Orlan
do, Fla., Tuesday, in an effort at reassurance. In an apparent
bow to the congressional concerns, he and other U.S. of
ficials also took what sounded like a more flexible approach
toward negotiations between the Salvadoran government
and its rebel opponents.
However, despite Reagan's stress on seeking a "common
course" with Congress toward Central America, leaders of
both parties who attended a White House meeting with the
president and his top advisers earlier yesterday were put on

notice that the price tag for consensus might be almost
double what the administration originally asked for.
House committee approves freeze
Washington — The House Foreign Affairs Committee yes
terday brushed off last-minute appeals from President Rea
gan's arms controllers and approved 27 to 9 a non-binding
resolution calling on the United States and Soviet Union to
negotiate an "immediate, veiifiable and mutual freeze" on
nuclear weapons.
The freeze proposition, which Reagan has said would lock
the United States into an inferior military position and un
dercut U.S. negotiators at the arms talks in Geneva, is ex
pected to go to the House floor next week, and is thought
likely to pass there.
It then will go to the Republican-controlled
Senate, where it is thought likely to die.
But even approval in the House — where the
freeze last year failed 204 to 202, but where
Democrats since have gained 26 seats — would
be a blow to the president and would hearten
members seeking to cut the defense budget. "A
repudiation of Reagatomics," pro-freeze Rep.
Edward Markey (D-Mass.) called it Tuesday.
The administration's continued opposition to
the freeze was reflected in telegrams from Rea
gan's negotiators at Geneva, Gen. Edward
Rowny and Paul Nitze. They were read at the
start of the bill's discussion. The freeze resolu
tion "would seriously undermine our ability to
negotiate an equitable agreement with the So
viets," Nitze said.
But pro-freeze committee Chairman Cle
ment Zablocki (D-Wis.) said the resolution was
not "boat rocking," calling it a legitimate effort
to influence administration policy on arms con
trol.
Reagan says U.S. to triumph
Orlando — President Reagan sharply stepped
up his campaigns for increased defense spend
ing and against a nuclear freeze yesterday, tell
ing a group of evangelical ministers that
"simple-minded appeasement or wishful think
ing about our adversaries is folly,"
In a speech to the National Association of
Evangelicals, in which he also reaffirmed his
positions on abortion, prayer in schools and
birth control for teen-age girls, Reagan urged
the ministers "to speak out against those who
would place the United States in a position of
military and moral inferiority."
The president plainly was moving in his
speech to re-energize the conservative base of
support that helped elect him. He said proudly
that his administration's "respect for the rule of
law under God" leaves it"in opposition to, or at
least out of step with, a prevailing attitude of
many who have turned to a modern day secular
ism, discarding the tried and time-tested values
upon which our very civilization is based."
One example, he said, was the so-called
"squeal rule," under which the administration
has moved to require that parents be notified
when girls under 18 receive prescription birth
control devices from federally funded clinics.
' I've watched TV panel shows discuss rhis is
sue," the president sa:d "have read columnists
pontificating cn our error, but no one seems to
mention morality as playing a part in the subject
of sex. is ali of Judeo-Christian tradition
wrong?"
He said, "The fight against parental notifica
tion is really only one example of many at
tempts to water down traditional values and
even abrogate the original terms of American
democracy."
The president then went on to note his sup
port for prayer in schools and his. opposition to
abortion. He spoke out as well against racism
and anUsem\\\sm in his list of essentially moral
issues, then shifted to foreign policy and his
view of the Soviet Union as an "evil empire."
"I believe we can rise to the challenge" of the
Soviet threat, the president said. "I believe that
communism is another sad, bizarre chapter in
human history whose last pages even now are
being written. I believe this because the source
of our strength in the quest for human freedom
is not material but spiritual. And because it
knows no limitation, it must terrify and ul
timately triumph over those who would enslave
their fellow man."
Occidental to run huge mine
Peking — In a deal expected to yield at least
$600 million in annual revenue, Occidental Pe

troleum Corp. signed an agreement with China
yesterday to develop and jointly operate what
could become the world's largest open-pit coal
mine.
In agreeing to share the costs and profits of
the vast mine in central China — its proven re
serves are said to reach 1.4 billion tons of coal —
Peking has undertaken its most ambitious joint
venture since foreign investment again became
a possibility here in 1979.
Western diplomats said the deal is a harb
inger of possibly extensive American private in
vestment in China's energy sector as this coun
try moves to exploit its rich oil and hydroelec
tric resources.
Occidental Chairman Armand Hammer, who
pioneered American business dealings in the
Soviet Union decades ago, signed the coal
agreement in Peking,about 300 mileseastof the
Shanxi Province site where the mine is located.
In announcing the agreement, the state-run
New China News Agency said the project will
produce 15 million tons of coal yearly.
Hammer, whose firm performed a feasibility
study on the mine last year, has predicted that
output eventually will reach 45 million tons a
year.
(A Commerce Department specialist in Wash
ington said such an output unquestionably
would be the world's largest. He put the biggest
U.S. mine at about 16 million tons and the larg
est in West Germany at about 30 million. Both
offer a lower grade of coal than the bituminous
at the Chinese site, the official said, adding that
the limiting factor on Chinese production re
mains transportation of the coal.
Plans call for mine construction to begin im
mediately, with production starting in 1985.
Most of the coal is to be exported to japan, with
the rest being used by China in its domestic in
dustries, according to officials.
Shamir calls for compromise
Jerusalem — Foreign Minister Yitzhak
Shamir, who is to travel to Washington on Fri
day for possibly critical meetings on the troop
withdrawal negotiations with Lebanon, re
portedly said yesterday that Israel must com
promise in the talks if it is to have any hope of
winning a Syrian troop withdrawal.
Israeli radio reported last night that Shamir
told a closed session of the Knesset (parliament)
foreign affairs and defense committee that Is
raeli and Lebanese negotiators are exploring
•he possibility of Israel' Lebanese and U.S.
troops patrolling a "security zone in southern
Lebanon after a troop withdrawal.
Shamir's remarks were the most concrete in
dication yet that Israel is looking for a way to
drop its demand that tive israeii-manned ob
servation posts" be established in the security
zone as part of a troop-withdrawal accord. It
was also a suggestion that American troops,
now confined to the Beirut area as part of the
multinational force, couid become involved in
patrolling the Israeli-Lebanese border.
Shamir's reference to Syria was also an ac
knowledgment of the difficulty of Israel's nego
tiating position until now in demanding the
right to maintain a residual military force in
southern Lebanon while expecting Lebanon to
gain agreement for a complete withdrawal of
Syrian and Palestinian troops from other parts
of the country. „
Burford makes job pitch
Washington — Environmental Protection
Agency Administrator Anne Burford made an
emotional appeal to a group of conservative
Republican activists 10 days ago to urge Presi
dent Reagan to keep her on the job, GOP
sources said yesterday.
Burford made the appeal to the Western
States Political Caucus, a group of party officials

and organizers from Western states who
worked for Reagan's election in 1980. One
source who attended the Feb. 26 closed-door
meeting in Denver said Burford was visibly
shaken as she sought support.
It could not be learned whether her appeal
had any direct result. But a week later Reagan
told aides that he was unwilling to fire Burford
and said she can keep her job as long as she
wants to. Senior Reagan aides have been seek
ing Burford's removal because they say they be
lieve she has become a serious political liability.
Burford received public support this week
from Interior Secretary James Watt, who said in
a speech in San Antonio that she is "taking
abuse that no public servant should have to en
dure." But Sen. Alfonse D'Amato (R-N.Y.) yes
terday joined other congressional Republicans
calling for Burford's resignation.
Meanwhile, congressional Democrats in
vestigating the EPA have been told that some
documents they are seeking may have been de
stroyed or removed from agency files, and that
a senior EPA official may have ordered erasures
of items on his appointment calendars after
they were requested.
Oil tax rise proposed
Washington — Federal Reserve Chairman
Paul Volcker proposed yesterday that Congress
raise energy taxes if oil prices plunge below $25
a barrel, absorbing some of the savings for con
sumers to reduce federal budget deficits
projected at $200 billion or more in 1984 and
beyond.
Volcker made the suggestion in con
gressional testimony as both the House and
Senate Budget committees intensified their
search for revenue-raising measures before
they draw up their alternatives to President
Reagan's spending plan for the 1984 fiscal year.
"The case is quite compelling" for a tem
porary new tax on oil of up to $5 a barrel if world
petroleum prices continue to fall sharply,
Volcker told the House panel.
Imposing a $5 levy on a barrel of oil would in
crease gasoline taxes by about 12 cents a gallon,
industry officials have estimated. Although
Volcker frequently has exhorted Congress to
reduce spending in order to bring down record
deficits, he rarely makes an explicit suggestion
for budget cuts or revenue-raising measures.
"A deep decline in oil prices would suggest
early re-xamination of the case for energy tax
es." Volcker said in his testimony. "One possi
bility would be to oring forward the kind of oil
tax proposed by tne aministration on a standby
basis in fiscal (year) 1986."
Reagan proposed a standby tax increase, in
cluding a IS a-barrel increase in oil taxes, but
recommended that it rake effect in October
1985 — when the 1986 fiscal year begins — only
if deficits remained above the $100 billion level
and the economy was expanding.

Hammer, whose firm performed a feasibility
study on the mine last year, has predicted that
output eventually will reach 45 million tons a
year.
(A Commerce Department specialist in Wash
ington said such an output unquestionably
would be the world's largest. He put the biggest
U.S. mine at about 16 million tons and the larg
est in West Germany at about 30 million. Both
offer a lower grade of coal than the bituminous
at the Chinese site, the official said, adding that
the limiting factor on Chinese production re
mains transportation of the coal.
Plans call for mine construction to begin im
mediately, with production starting in 1985.
Most of the coal is to be exported to japan, with
the rest being used by China in its domestic in
dustries, according to officials.
Shamir calls for compromise
Jerusalem — Foreign Minister Yitzhak
Shamir, who is to travel to Washington on Fri
day for possibly critical meetings on the troop
withdrawal negotiations with Lebanon, re
portedly said yesterday that Israel must com
promise in the talks if it is to have any hope of
winning a Syrian troop withdrawal.
Israeli radio reported last night that Shamir
told a closed session of the Knesset (parliament)
foreign affairs and defense committee that Is
raeli and Lebanese negotiators are exploring
•he possibility of Israel' Lebanese and U.S.
troops patrolling a "security zone in southern
Lebanon after a troop withdrawal.
Shamir's remarks were the most concrete in
dication yet that Israel is looking for a way to
drop its demand that tive israeii-manned ob
servation posts" be established in the security
zone as part of a troop-withdrawal accord. It
was also a suggestion that American troops,
now confined to the Beirut area as part of the
multinational force, couid become involved in
patrolling the Israeli-Lebanese border.
Shamir's reference to Syria was also an ac
knowledgment of the difficulty of Israel's nego
tiating position until now in demanding the
right to maintain a residual military force in
southern Lebanon while expecting Lebanon to
gain agreement for a complete withdrawal of
Syrian and Palestinian troops from other parts
of the country. „
Burford makes job pitch
Washington — Environmental Protection
Agency Administrator Anne Burford made an
emotional appeal to a group of conservative
Republican activists 10 days ago to urge Presi
dent Reagan to keep her on the job, GOP
sources said yesterday.
Burford made the appeal to the Western
States Political Caucus, a group of party officials

and organizers from Western states who
worked for Reagan's election in 1980. One
source who attended the Feb. 26 closed-door
meeting in Denver said Burford was visibly
shaken as she sought support.
It could not be learned whether her appeal
had any direct result. But a week later Reagan
told aides that he was unwilling to fire Burford
and said she can keep her job as long as she
wants to. Senior Reagan aides have been seek
ing Burford's removal because they say they be
lieve she has become a serious political liability.
Burford received public support this week
from Interior Secretary James Watt, who said in
a speech in San Antonio that she is "taking
abuse that no public servant should have to en
dure." But Sen. Alfonse D'Amato (R-N.Y.) yes
terday joined other congressional Republicans
calling for Burford's resignation.
Meanwhile, congressional Democrats in
vestigating the EPA have been told that some
documents they are seeking may have been de
stroyed or removed from agency files, and that
a senior EPA official may have ordered erasures
of items on his appointment calendars after
they were requested.
Oil tax rise proposed
Washington — Federal Reserve Chairman
Paul Volcker proposed yesterday that Congress
raise energy taxes if oil prices plunge below $25
a barrel, absorbing some of the savings for con
sumers to reduce federal budget deficits
projected at $200 billion or more in 1984 and
beyond.
Volcker made the suggestion in con
gressional testimony as both the House and
Senate Budget committees intensified their
search for revenue-raising measures before
they draw up their alternatives to President
Reagan's spending plan for the 1984 fiscal year.
"The case is quite compelling" for a tem
porary new tax on oil of up to $5 a barrel if world
petroleum prices continue to fall sharply,
Volcker told the House panel.
Imposing a $5 levy on a barrel of oil would in
crease gasoline taxes by about 12 cents a gallon,
industry officials have estimated. Although
Volcker frequently has exhorted Congress to
reduce spending in order to bring down record
deficits, he rarely makes an explicit suggestion
for budget cuts or revenue-raising measures.
"A deep decline in oil prices would suggest
early re-xamination of the case for energy tax
es." Volcker said in his testimony. "One possi
bility would be to oring forward the kind of oil
tax proposed by tne aministration on a standby
basis in fiscal (year) 1986."
Reagan proposed a standby tax increase, in
cluding a IS a-barrel increase in oil taxes, but
recommended that it rake effect in October
1985 — when the 1986 fiscal year begins — only
if deficits remained above the $100 billion level
and the economy was expanding.
