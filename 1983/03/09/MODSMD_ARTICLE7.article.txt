Military aid for El Salvador may double
Washington — President Reagan told congressional lead
ersyesterdaythattheadministration mayseek Si 10million in
additional military aid for El Salvador, rather than the $60 mil
lion it had discussed earlier.
Most of the extra $50 million apparently would be

resolution calling on the United States and Soviet Union to
negotiate an "immediate, veiifiable and mutual freeze" on
