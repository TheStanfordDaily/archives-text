# Supercomputers: the next step?

### BILL BEYDA Science writer 
The electronic technology revolution
that has swept the country in the last
decade has been attributed primarily to
advances in the use of semiconductors,
impure crystalline materials which
conduct electricity by a change in tem
perature. Stanford is in the heart of Sili
con Valley, the home of pioneering re
search in semiconductors, and appro
priately named for the most widely
used semiconductor available, silicon.
Silicon, however, is not the only
semiconductor with practical applica
tions: many researchers are now direct
ing their attention to gallium arsenide,
because faster devices can be built
from it.
"You can turn a gallium arsenide
transistor on and off faster than you can
a silicon one," said Dr. Nick Moll, re
searcher at the Hewlett Packard facility
in Palo Alto. "If you're making comput
ers, it's advantageous to make them run
as fast as you can, and gallium arsenide
devices are faster than silicon ones."
A major application for gallium arse
nide is in "supercomputers." These are
extremely high-speed computers
mostly used for complex scientific and
engineering calculations that would
take days or even months to perform on
a standard computer.
"Those of us working with the mate

rial expect that in the next 10 years its
use will increase dramatically," Moll
said.
"However, I don't think it will ever
replace silicon â€” it will complement it.
They're things you can do with it that
you can't do with silicon. But in applica
tions where cost is more important than
speed, silicon will still dominate."
This is because gallium arsenide is
much more expensive than silicon to
process. "There is not as long a history
of research on gallium arsenide as there
is on silicon, nor is there anywhere near
the effort being put into current re
search," Moll said.
"For example, I don't think you'll see
gallium arsenide in an Apple (com
puter)," Moll said. "Eventually, it will
have a really important place in large
computers, doing high speed numeri
cal calculations." But the price one
must pay for supercomputers today is
often in the multimillion dollar range.
A leader in the supercomputer field,
Cray Inc., will be coming out with
a computer with many gallium arsenide
components by mid-1985, according to
Dr. James Gibbons, Chairman of the
Executive Committee of the Center for
Integrated Systems and professor of
electrical engineering at Stanford. "It
will probably be the fastest computer in
the world," Gibbons said.
"Cray has used an approach to de

signing computers that is based on
many fast components wired together
very carefully, rather than trying to jam
a lot of devices in a small space," ex
plained Gibbons. "But these fast de
vices use a lot of power and dissipate a
lot of heat, so Cray takes the entire
computer and immerses it in a liquid
coolant that is also an electrical in
sulator."
"Using standard computer architec
ture tec hniques we were fast reaching
our limit in terms of machine speed,"
Gibbons said. "You can only take it so
far. But gallium arsenide will increase
the speed even more."
Gibbons agrees with Moll that gal
lium arsenide will not replace silicon.
"Consumer products have to cost pen
nies," Gibbons said. "Anything you
and I are going to see won't have gal
lium arsenide in it."
Stanford's Center for Integrated Sys
tems, currently under construction,
has 19 corporate sponsors, according
to Gibbons, "that understand the need
for basic research in semiconductors,
and the need to educate people in this
new technology."
The Center will include researchers
from many departments, including
electrical engineering, computer sci
ence, and materials science, all concen
trating on improving the current
technology.
