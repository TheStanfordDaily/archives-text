# Fiberoptic glass to transmit tomorrow's communications

### HARA LEVY 
Fiber-optics is a wonder drug for the ills of
modern communications Fiberoptir cables
carrv information through hair-thin fib
ers ot ultratransparent glasj. 01 acrylic instead of
through the metal fibers now used. Fiber-optic
cables transmit data by light impulses, carrying
more information much faster, more efficiently,
and with less energy loss than electrical im
pulses carried the data in metal cables.
George Hara of Gekee Fiber-Optics Inc. in
Palo Alto described the two types of fiber-optic
cables: those made with glass, and with acrylic.
"Both fibers," said Hara, "have a hundred times
larger capacity than presently-used cables, mak
ing fiber-optic cables 10,000 percent more effi
cient." Glass fibers are used strictly for long
distance communications, according to Hara,
while acrylic cables are used for display optics.
Gekee is currently working with acrylic fibers,
which are much more flexible than glass fibers.
While glass fibers are much better for transmit
ting information longdistance, they are disad
vantageous in that they are breakable. Acrylic
fibers, though their transmission distance is lim
ited, are more flexible and are unbreakable.
Acrylic fibers can therefore be used for short
distance transmissions, involving moving ob
jects (ships, cars and airplanes), which need a
flexible transmission cable. An acrylic fiber optic
bundle can also carry an entire image from one
place to another with very little energy loss, so,

according to Gekee employee John Mintz, the
fibers are used mainly for image technology:
signs, computer screens, special effects and
fireworks simulations.
Hara said most small fiber-optic companies
are working with acrylic fibers because the large
telecommunications companies have
monopolized the glass fiber technology. In
deed, American Telephone and Telegraph Co.
(AT&T) is starting to use fiber-optics to carry
light impulses through glass fibers, in place of
the electric-impulse wires now used: The Feb
ruary edition of Science News reports that on
February 10, AT&T linked up fiberoptic tele
phone service between New York and Washing
ton, D.C., the first such link between major met
ropolitan centers and the largest one ever, in
terms of information transmission capacity.
Within a year a system linking the major cities
of California from Sacramento to San Diego is
expected to go into service. The fiberoptic tele
phone cable will have a greater capacity and
should go faster with much lower error rates
than at present.
In addition, stray light cannot enter an optical
fiber cable in the way that electrical interference
can enter an electrical cable. Because fiber
optics have this exceptional resistance to elec
trical interference, they may be strung through
"explosive" (lightning-prone) areas making
communications networks available in areas
otherwise isolated.
