# No change in resident priority

### KATHY BODOVITZ 
Myths, not rules, are all that need changing in the University housing
returning resident priority system, according to a report prepared re
cently by the Committee on Student Services-Residences (CoSS-R).
The committee concluded that the returning resident system is worth
while and much less unfair than many students believe. Rodger Whitney,
assistant dean of student affairs, said that in the past three draws an
overall average of only 30 percent of the spaces in residences were filled
by returning residents. This left 70 percent of the spaces still available for
non-returning students.
A table indicating the "percentages of each house available after return
ing residents have been assigned" in the 1982 draw shows Alpha Sigma
with 69 percent, American Studies with 59 percent, La Casa Italia with 85
percent, Lambda Nu with 54 percent, Roble with 67 percent and Twain
with 59 percent.
Manzanita had fewer new residents than any of the above with only 53
percent, but the average percentage over the last three years there was 74
percent. The low percentage this year was apparently due in part to the
temporary housing of suites residents there during fall quarter.
The complete table will be published in this year's draw book.
Whitney said, "The feeling out there is if you draw poorly your sopho
more year you re doomed." He also noted the concern among students
that "there are too many people getting back into the same residences
year after year and that there is not enough turnover in the good resi
dences."
The committee's study of returning resident priority began three years
ago with an examination of the philosophy behind the system, Whitney
said.
According to a statement by the committee, ". . . Returning resident
priority supports two philosophical principles important to the goals of
residential education at Stanford: One, each residence should have a
minimum number of students who have been residents before and can
help carry on traditions and provide program support. And two, students
who feel comfortable and like a particular residence for whatever reason,
should have the knowledge that they can live in the same place for more
than one year and feel at home there."
The committee's research consisted of inquiries among resident fel
lows and resident assistants. "We talked to RFs and RAs and got fairly
strong responses that returning resident priority was very important for
continuity," Whitney said.
The next question was the number of returning residents believed to be
essential. "Between 25 and 40 percent were the numbers given," he said.
"Some (RFs and RAs) felt we should leave it to the luck of the draw and
that there woud naturally be a number of returnees. But most RFs and RAs
felt that was too much leaving it to chance," he said.
Another option explored was permitting returning resident priority
only to current residents for the immediately succeeding year. However,
Whitney said, "The feeling was that if you could only come back im
mediately it would effect decisions to go overseas."
The one change the committee recommended applies only to those
students who choose to be unguaranteed their sophomore year but end
up the living on campus. The restriction allows students to claim returning
resident priority only once. Unguaranteed sophomores can therefore
claim priority for either their junior or senior year, but not for both.
Returning resident priority is not given during an unguaranteed year.
Whitney said the committee decided not to recommend any major
changes this year because it wants to see the impact of the new residences
and to consider the recommendations of the Subcommittee of the Com
mittee on Residential Education and Advising to be made this spring.
