# Profs say oil price drop will help U.S.
## 
### RANDY BROBERG 
Economists and energy experts
here generally agree that the recent
drops in the world price of oil will
benefit the United States, but differ
in their opinions on how far the
prices will or should drop.
After the failure of OPEC ministers
to set pricing and production quotas
in Vienna and Geneva, there have
been major upheavals in the world
oil market in recent weeks.
Late last month, Britain and Nor
way, both non-OPEC oil exporting
nations, reduced their price $3 to
$30.50 per barrel. Nigeria followed
suit by cutting its own price $5.50 to
$30.50 per barrel. Other OPEC mem
bers, led bv Saudi Arabia, have been
holding frantic meetings in order to
prevent an all out price-cutting war.
lust how far the price will drop de
pends to a large degree on political,
not economic, considerations. OPEC
nations are attempting to hold the
price at $30 per barrel, but Ezra Sol
omon, professor of finance at the
Graduate School of Business and a
former member of then-President
Nixon's Council of Economic Ad
visors, expects the price to drop to
the $27 to $28 range.

Thomas Moore, senior fellow at
the Hoover Institution and director
of the Institution's Domestic Studies
Program, said he believes the price
will "surely go down to $25, probably
below $25, and conceivably as low as
$10."
Some energy experts disagree,
however. Prof. A.J. Horn of the Pe
troleum Engineering Department of
the School of Earth Sciences, said
predictions of a price drop to less
than $20 represent "wishful thinking
and selfishness." He said that a price

in the $15 to $20 range would cause
relative chaos in the United States."
Many Stanford economists agree
that the net impact of an oil price
drop would be beneficial for the U.S.
economy.
"1 he bulk of us will benefit, just as
the bulk of us were hurt when prices
went up," Solomon said. He listed oil
producing nations, oil exploration
and oil service companies and banks
which have loaned too large a por
tion of their portfolio to oil produc
ers as the sectors which will be most
hurt by the oil price drop.
Moore listed Texas, Oklahoma,
Louisiana and Alaska as states that
will be hurt by recent developments,
but said that California and other
states that consume more energy
than they produce will become net
beneficiaries.
James Sweeney, professor of
engineering-economic systems, said
the price reductions are "good for
our economy."
"Most of the arguments that they
are not good are either fallacious or
supporting of special interests."
There seemed to be a consensus
among economists interviewed that
the price decline will lower inflation,
stimulate the economy, quicken the
recovery, increase the GNP, and de
crease unemployment.
Preliminary figures of a study by
the Energy Modeling Forum, which
Sweeney directs, predict that a $7
drop in oil prices would cause the
fiscal 1984 GNP to increase 1 percent
to 1.5 percent, price levels to decrease
.5 percent to 1.5 percent, the unem
ployment rate to go down .5 percent
to 1 percent, and the deficit for that
year to be reduced by $10 to $20 bil

lion.
Solomon, Moore, and Sweeney all
agree that the loss ot revenues from
the windfall profits tax will not be
sufficient to prevent a net gain in
federal revenues because of the
overall boost to the economy.
For the consumer, the oil price
drops could cause a 10 cent gallon
drop in prices at the pump. Gasoline
prices have already been decreasing
in response to the world oil glut. A
recent American Automobile Associ
ation study said the average price of
gasoline in the Bay Area has dropped
5.5 tents since early February.
According to Sweeney, the pro
jeted strains on the world financial
system in response to the troubles of
poor oil producing nations such as
mexico, Venezuala, and Nigeria are
"greatly overplayed." He said that oil
price increases put great strains o the
world financial system because of
the great needs of poor, non-oil pro
ducing, less developed countries.
"Mexico is made worse off, but
Brazil will be made much better off,"
Sweeney said.
There will not be an immediate ef
fect on domestic oil production, ac
cording to Horn. "Nobody in his
right mind is going to shut down a
producing oil field," he said.
However, Horn added that there
will probably be a reduction in oil
exploration and drilling, just as there

already has been, leading to a dip in
production by the latter part of the
decade.
The price drops will almost cer
tainly severely hamper efforts to

produce alternative fuels, especially
synthetic tuels which are econom
ically marginal even at current prices.
Because of the delay in the develop
ment of these fuels and the lessening
of incentives to find domestic oil
Horn believes a decrease in the price
of oil "will be a detriment to the
U.S."

As for what policy steps should be
implemented in response to the low
ering of oil prices there was wide dis
agreement among professors here.
Moore opposes tariffs or quotas
on imported oil since they would "be
to protect our producers from low
cost competition." He said, "It won't
hurt to use imported oil for now.
Mexico is a reasonably secure source
of oil, and we should not worry about
security of supply; we could use the
opportunity to stockpile."
Horn also opposes tariffs, because
he thinks they would be ineffective.
He said now is the time for the fed
eral government to increase invest
ment in alternative fuels.
Sweeney said tariffs could be used
at this time to stimulate conservation
and collect revenue for the govern
ment.
Regardless of what should or
should not be done, lohn Chubb,
professor of political science and au
thor of Interest Croups and the Bu
reaucracy: the Politics of Energy, said
the only advocates of higher prices
are oil companies and some banks.
"This is not a winning coalition. I
would be shocked if politicans make
any positive steps toward conserva
tion now," he said.
