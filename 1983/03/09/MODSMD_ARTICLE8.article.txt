# Kennedy to warn Congress
## 
### ALAN TRIPP Senior staff writer 
University President Donald Ken
nedy's testimony today before the
U.S. Senate Subcommittee on Sci
ence, Technology and Space will
warn of the possible effects of cut
ting basic scientific research fund
ing.
In a written statement released in
advance, Kennedy claimed that
newly developed ties between uni
versities and industry, though "excit
ing and full of promise," could not
replace the federal government as
the "dominant source of funding for
fundamental science."
Despite current technological suc
cesses, Kennedy said, "many
thoughtful observers of our national
science policy are worried." He said
the future "depends on investments
we are making now, and . . . there
are reasons to be concerned about
the quality of these present invest
ments."
According to Kennedy, "About 70
percent of all the basic research done
in the United States is performed in
universities. . . . Industry, on the
other hand, is responsible for over
two-thirds of the total research ex
penditures in this country."
He stressed the importance of the
federal funding component of basic
research relative to funding from in
dustry. "If federally funded research
at Stanford were to be reduced by 1
percent, a 25 percent incTease in in
dustry funding would be required to
make up for the loss.
"Federal funds for non-defense
research were reduced by about 41.7
percent in real dollar value sine e 1%7
(this calculation assumes the presi
dent's FYB4 budget is adopted as pre
sented), and a significant decline has
taken place in the first two years of
the 1980s.
"Although we find much to
applaud in the president s budget, it
is hard to avoid noting that certain
areas — particularly the biomedical
and social sciences — have not fared
so well. The success of American sci
encecan best be assured bv vigoious
support and adequate funding of the
basic research programs of the NSF
(National Science Foundation) and
other agencies. . .
Though Kennedy warned that
over-dependence on industry would
be unwise, he advocated the move
ment toward greater industry finan
cial support for university research:
"What we must try to do is involve
industry more productively and crea
tively with university research in a
way that leaves the latter intact, in
stead of risking fractionation of the
training and research components
and the division of faculty time be
tween on- and off-campus ventures.

"For their part, universities have
no objection if their research be
nefits business. Indeed, they rather
like the Idea, but they are zealous
about ensuring that the conditions
essential to frot? inquiry for tuarhing
and research are not compromised."
As an example of university
industry cooperation, Kennedy re
ferred to an ongoing Stanford proj
ect which was made possible by
funding from 1H different electronics
firms.
