## Irritates Sandinistas in Nicaragua Pope visits Central America 
### 
Compiled from new s reports and wire
services
Pope John Paul II began his
Central American tour Thurs
day in Costa Rica where he
prayed for peace before one
million people, told nuns to
stay out of politics and called
on young people to torge an
end to the region's bloody
political warfare.
He also visited a hospital for
retarded and seriously injured
children and gave a boost to
the I nternation.il Court of
Human Rights.
"I know the climate of work
and peace which distinguishes
you, beloved c hildren of Costa
Rica," the pope said in Spanish
as he celebrated Mass in La
S a b a n a Park for a million
people, many of whom spent
the night there waiting tor him.
"You must have absolute re
spect tor lite from conception
and reject abortion as a crime "
he declared.
Later that afternoon, lohn
Paul held a meeting with the
country's 1200 priests and nuns
in the 155-year-old Metropoli
tan Cathedral. Directing his
speech to the nuns, he told
them they are gaining impor
tance "at a moment in history
in which women are acquiring
positions of dignifying im
provement."
But he warned them, in line
with the Vatican's opposition
to direct political action by the

clergy, "Do not let yourselves
be fooled by p a r t is a n
ideologies. Do not succumb to
the temptation of options
which one day will ask you to
pay the price of your own free
dom."
Nicaragua
On Friday, Pope John Paul II
visited the only Marxist-ruled
c ountry in Central America and
warned the overwhelmingly
Roman Catholic population
against "unacceptable ideolog
ical commitments."
He also rejected the homage
of the Sandinista revolutionary
government's c ulture minister,
a priest who is defying his ban
on such political activity, and
told him to "straighten out
this) position with the church."
Welcoming the pontiff was
the head of Nicaragua's
three-man ruling junta. Daniel
Ortega, who criticized United
States policy towards his na
tion. Ortega, who was clad in a
military uniform, said, "Holy
Father our blessed country,
now tree ot its chains, has suf
fered from North American ag
gression. And U.S. policv does
not permit our people to heal
their wounds."
Later in the dav in a Managua
plaza, lohn-Paul warned that
church unity is threatened "by
unacceptable ideological
commitments and temporal
options, including the concep
tion of a church which replaces

the true one."
He was referring to the so
called "popular churches"
sprouting up in Nicaragua in
defiance of the recognized
hierarchy. Nicaragua is more
than 90 percent Catholic, but
the church hierarchy has been
at odds with members of the
Sandinista government, some
of whom say Marxist dialectic is
not contradictory with Chris
tian beliefs.
Delicate negotiations were
required to determine the
pope's program in Nicaragua,
or even if he would visit at all.
The government controlled
public access to papal events,
and |ohn Paul, obviously un
happy about this, included in
his airport speech greetings to
the thousands and thousands
of Nicaraguans who have not
found it possible to go to meet
ing places, as they might have
wanted."
El Salvador
War-weary Salvadorans are
praying the papal visit will
bring nothing less than a mira
cle — peace to a nation in
which an estimated 42,000
people have perished in 40
months of civil war.
President Alvaro Magana, in
his airport welcome to Pope
lohn Paul 11, promised there
will be elections in "1983 — the
year of peace."
For a day at least, the pope
and peace were synonymous
in Central America's smallest
country, where the civil war
has claimed almost as many
lives as the United States — 50
times as populous — lost in
Vietnam.
Over one million faithful
went with their children and
their elderly in hand to meet
the pope in an almost carnival
air, in contrast to the re
gimented ranks of Nicaraguans
who had debarked from
government-sponsored cara
vans waving the banners
handed to them and shouting
slogans at the cue of a cheer
leader.
One souvenir dealer was
cautiously peddling a poster
showing slain Archbishop
Oscar Arnul fo Romero shaking
hands with the pope, but he
concealed it whenever any of
natiuna\ went \~>y .

The let t has been carrying on
a vigorous campaign to make a
political martyr out of the
archbishop, gunned down by
presumed rightist assassins
while celebrating Mass three
years ago.
Guatemala
On Monday, Pope John Paul
II made an impassioned appeal
to Guatemala's military presi
dent to protect human lite and
due process of law despite his
right-wing regime s war against
leftist guerrillas.
The pontiff also gave the
Roman Catholic Church's em
phatic support to the country's
large numbers of Maya
descended Indians who often
are discriminated against and
abused,
The pope met privately with
President Efrain Rios Montt, a
general and a born-again
Christian who last week ig
nored a papal plea to call off
the execution of six convicted
leftist terrorists.
Montt, installed by the mili
tary as president last year after
a coup, greeted the pope as a
messenger of peace." But
John Paul remained upset over
the executions last Thursday
after he arrived in Central
America.
The Vatican said there would
be "serious repercussions"
but did not elaborate. In the
past the Holy See has cut off or
downgraded diplomatic rela
tions with countries that
strongly displeased the pope.
Rios Montt last week de
fended his refusal to heed the
papal plea for clemency, saying
he had an obligation "to carry
out the law." But he claims he
has curbed human rights
abuses including those by
right-wing death squads.
Four major leftist groups
have been fighting a guerrilla
war for more than five years,
and an estimated bOOO people
have been killed, including In
dian peasants caught in the
crossfire or accused of taking
sides. The government has
executed 10 people as leftist
subversives since last Septem
ber, when it instituted secret
tribunals and the death pen-
