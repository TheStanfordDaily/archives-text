waterfalls, you can fulfill requirements,
accelerate your degree program, or
simply take the courses that you've
always put off. Ithaca, a small
cosmopolitan city, is located in a
magnificent, varied countryside that
offers you water sports and ball games,
climbing and camping, theater and
outdoor concerts, soaring and biking,
birding and hiking... Call or write to see
