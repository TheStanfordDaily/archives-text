## Hospital enacts new detailed community access procedure 
### KRISTEN CHRISTOPHER 
In a move directed toward resolving the more than
decade-long conflict between community physicians
and the Stanford University Hospital, the board of hospi
tal directors earlier this month approved an extended
policy concerning access to hospital facilities.
The new policy, announced earlier this month, estab
lishes the first detailed procedure by which community
physicians can gain access to hospital-based specialty
services and laboratories. A committee of faculty, com
munity physicians and members formed specifically to
address past disputes about access recommended the
policy to the board of directors after 15 months of dis
cussion.
"It makes it a clear, objective, visible process," Dean
Morton, chairman of the access committee, said. "I ex
pect that it will lead to some additional access physi
'cians,"
Although there has been tension between the Hospi
tal and community physicians since 1967 when the Uni
versity bought out-Palo Alto's half of the Hospital, it was
aggravated in 1978 when the board of directors adopted
a closed staff policy for hospital-based services and
laboratories. Some of those are anesthesia service, CAT
scanning laboratories, hemodialysis center and the
radiology service.
The 1978 position was modified by an agreement three
years later; community specialists could then gain ac
cess if a doctor already able to use the facilities resigned
or retired.
However, the procedure for gaining access outlined
in the 1981 agreement was considered unsatisfactory by
many community physicians because it was not specific
enough and did not force the decisions to be made
promptly. Also, access to future technologies was not
addressed.
The new policy includes a more detailed procedure
for obtaining access to present and future hospital
based specialty laboratories and a mechanism by which
decisions may be appealed.
Wilbur Mattison, a doctor at the Menlo Medical Clinic
and member of the access committee, said the new

agreement involves compromises by both sides. There
are still some points of disagreement about procedure,
he said, but the situation for community physicians
looks better than it has in the past.
"We weren't so concerned with establishing policy,
so we don't have a winner or loser," Mattison said.
"What we were doing was establishing procedure."
Hewlett Lee, executive director of the Palo Alto Medi
cal Foundation and a member of the access committee,
said, "I think the compromise was on both sides —
moving to central position from both sides."
Asked if community physicians are happy with the
new policy, Lee said, "I think reasonably so. . . . There
are always some way out on the edges, just as there are
some way out on the edges of the faculty."
In reference to community physicians, Morton said,
"The response I've gotten quite honestly has been very
pleasing to me . . . they're hopeful and supportive."
The new policy will be reviewed periodically in re
sponse to feedback and may be changed if serious prob
lems are apparent. "We'll just have to monitor it," Mor
ton said.
He said he hopes the access committee will not have
to "re-cook the document," butadded that hethinks the
access committee has "gotten the proper perspective."
The committee will meet several times each year, ac
cording to Morton. "We're there to be the eyes and ears
of the board on this matter," he said.
The new policy also calls for the access committee to
be permanent and for the access committees at the
departmental levels to have representatives from both
the community and faculty.
The response of the Palo Alto City Council to the
policy was positive. Last summer, the council endorsed
the Hospital Modernization Project, but said it would
withdraw its endorsement if community physicians were
not relatively satisfied by an agreement.
"In lightof theagreement between the varying groups
. . . we reaffirmed our endorsement," city councilman
Larry Klein said. The council made that decision a week
ago today.
