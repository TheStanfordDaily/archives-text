## Marketing a golf computer game Student corporation exhibits rapid growth 
### KRISTEN BROWN 
It is 9 p.m. on a Friday. You
had planned to meet some
friends at the Dutch Goose,
but your car won't start. What
do you do?
If you have an IBM computer
and a Boone "Artificial Intelli
gence Program" (which trains
the computer to take on its
own personality), things are
still in control. Without even
taking a step outside yourfront
door, you can still go to a bar,
meet people and hold conver
sations.
This is just one of the com
puter games developed by the
Boone Corp. — a computer
software company whose as
sessment value has skyroc
keted since senior Michael
Boone founded it five months
ago.
The Boone Corp. markets
the small discs which are to a
computerwhat records are to a
record player.
Boone, a Lagunita Court res
ident, did extensive research in
both the ice cream and com
puter software fields, and when
he called on a prospective ven
ture capitalist, a Stanford un
dergraduate, it was to get capi
tal for an ice cream business.
Had it not been for the inves
tor's insistence upon going
into software, Boone might be
churning cream.
Instead, Boone and four col
leagues — three Stanford un
dergraduates and a computer
whiz from Newport Beach —
incorporated in October.
With the rapid growth the
Boone Corp. has experienced
the last five months, it is un
derstandable that those in
volved have confidence the
company will make it big. In
October, the company had five
employees now it has 25, 11 of

whom start working full-time
in three weeks.
The company's recent as
sessment value was $1 million.
"That's pretty incredible con
sidering we have no sales!"
Boone said. Four software
products will go on the market
in June.
Bozell and Jacobs, a major
advertising firm that rarely
takes accounts of less than
$100,000, agreed to take the
Boone account, which totals
only $30,000.
Boone's enterprise seems
contagious. Larry Burke,

executive vice president, said,
"It's incredible how we've de
veloped. Everything explodes
at almost an exponential rate. I
think one thing that stimulates
this is Mike himself. Reckless
enthusiasm emanates from
him."
Burke said businessmen are
amazed when they first meet
with Boone and him. "We go
into their offices — you know
how businessmen are —
they're unemotional, like
stone walls. At first they listen
casually, and then, they get in
tensely interested," Burke

said.
Many people want to get in
volved after they see what
Boone calls "the phenomen
ally precise and utterly com
plex" business prospectus,
which Burke compiled. But
when the corporation was
about to present itself to 10 pri
vate venture capitalists, the
Stanford staff member who
had been consulting for the
corporation's board since De
cember wanted all of the avail
able stock.
Another Stanford professor,
a science fiction buff, took an

interest in computer adventure
games when he bought his
new IBM computer. He and a
top programmer from a major
technical company are cur
rently creating a science fiction
adventure that Boone Corp.
plans to publish.
Of all the products the
Boone Corp. is marketing,
Executive Golf is given top bil
ling.
When it comes out in April, it
will prove the most technolog
ically advanced computer
game on the market, according
to Boone.

The computer screen will
simulate trees, hill slopes,
lakes and sand traps to pro
duce an exact sketch of the
Pebble Beach golf course, with
which the Boone Corp. is cur
rently negotiating.
To match the Pebble Beach
hill curvatures and pond,
sand-trap and tree locations,
Boone had extensive topog
raphical maps and aerial
photos made. "We even have a
tree editor," Boone said. "Ev
ery tree is in exact location as it
is at the golf course — to scale.
It is even the same tree. A Cyp
rus looks like a Cyprus, and an
oak like an oak. . .
The computer golfer is no
stick figure either. To accu
rately reproduce the golfer's
motion, Davis studied the
anatomy and swing of golfer
Ben Hogan.
Davis hand-drew 60 frames
of the computer golfer, each of
which is compiled onto the
computer one at a time. "This
ultimately enables you to get a
smooth, accurate swing from
your golfer," Boone said.
He even hired an aeronauti
cal engineer to write a code on
how the ball will fly according
to wind drag, lift and golf-ball
dimples.
"We don't spare any effort to
make the game as good as pos
sible."
Boone said Executive Golf is
still not ready for market be
cause the programmers are
working at such an elevated
level that if they come to a
problem, "There is no one to
ask how to get around it."
"Imagine yourself as a CS
(computer science) 106 stu
dent working on a difficult
program and not having the
option of askinga professorfor
help or looking up the answer

in a book. It's terribly time
consuming. You simply have to
invent the solution yourself."
Software is not the only field
Boone Corp. deals in. "The
Perfect Planner" calendar falls
under the company's "Organi
zational Products Division." As
part of a project, Stanford in
dustrial engineering students
will test market The Perfect
Planner in the Stanford
Bookstore, and other univer
sity bookstores, next quarter.
Boone originally made a Per
fect Planner for himself when
he became fed up with regular
daily date books. He said the
Planner, an 18 x 24-inch board
with a dry erase pen, is de
signed specifically for the col
lege student. Where the aver
age "little black book" ends at
5 p.m., The Perfect Planner
schedules space from 8 a.m. to
midnight.
"How many Stanford stu
dents' days end at 5 p.m.?"
asked Boone.
When asked about other
software competition, Boone
said, "At this point, companies
are competing for unique pro
gramming and marketing
ideas."
Boone has confidence that
when his products hit the mar
ket (four games, including
Executive Golf will be out in
June; half a dozen others and
two business packages are ex
pected by October), they will
prove more diverse and of bet
ter quality than competing
software products.
Said Boone of his first five
months as an executive, "It's a
big game to me. It's fun to
compete and create — and to
be responsible. The world is a
giant playground and I am on
the software merry-go-round."
