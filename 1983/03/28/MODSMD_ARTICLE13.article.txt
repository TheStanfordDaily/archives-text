## The 						Stanford Daily Editorial policy explained 
### 
Before yet another quarter gets underway, we
thought it would be a good idea to expand
somewhat on the explanation of editorial policy
found every day in the bottom right corner of
this page. Because opinion articles and edito
rials are often controversial and because Spring
quarter ASSU election endorsements are always
controversial, we feel it is necessary for us to
give our readers a chance to gain a better under
standing of exactly how editorial positions are
taken.
First things first. If reading the fine print isn't
your thing, you may not even be familiar with
the simple statement referred to above. It reads
as follows:
Nothing on the opinions page necessarily rep
resents a position of the entire Daily staff, or the
Leland Stanford junior University. Editorials rep
resent the opinion of a majority of editorial
hoard members voting on each topic. The edito
rial board consists of the editor, managing
editor, two news editors, two opinion editors
and three at-large members selected by the
Daily staff.
A lot of important information is wrapped up
in these - few words, and it is sometimes distres
sing to find that so few people who have com
ments or complaints about something they have
seen on this page have not read them.
Our opinions editors' is to present
a diverse and well-written collection of opinion
articles each day. No opinion articles are written
by members of the Daily staff and no authors of
opinion articles are paid if their submissions are
published in the Daily. Because published opin
ion articles merely reflect the range of opinion
which the opinions editors find in their mailbox
each morning, accusations that the Daily opin
ions page is "obviously" liberal, conservative,
anti-Arab, anti-Semitic, etc. —and we have
heard them all—are unfounded. Quite simply,

the opinions page is a reflection of the diverse
views held by members of the Stanford com
munity.
Clearly, editorials are more closely a repre
sentation of the Daily staff. We hasten to em
phasize, however, that in the strictest sense,
editorials represent only the views of "a major
ity of editorial board members voting on each
topic."
The editorial board meets at least once a
week. Six members make a quorum and no spe
cial voting or agenda-setting rights are dele
gated to any one member, including the editor.
Traditionally, the board is not chaired by the
editor but by another board member.
Four of the board's members are chosen di
rectly by the entire Daily staff each volume—the
three at-large members as well as the editor,
while the remaining five members are chosen
by the editor immediately following her/his
election.
At-large members are often not associated
with the Daily prior to their election to the
board. Currently, two of the three at-large
members had no previous experience working
as Daily staff members. Elections are open to
both undergraduate and graduate students.
Last volume, a doctoral candidate in political
science served on the board.
One final note on the nature of Daily edito
rials. Because the board changes every
volume—twice a year—editorial positions are
not always consistent over time. This problem
plagues nearly every college newspaper. Be
cause there is no one publisher or owner to set
editorial policy and because the staff is relatively
transient, there is not really any good way
around this. We can only hope that you will find
our editorials substantive as well as thoughtful
and if you find yourself disagreeing with us this
year, just wait until next year—things may
change.
