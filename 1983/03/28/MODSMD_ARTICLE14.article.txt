## BSU vote rational, not racist 
### 
There have been some misun
derstandings and misinformation
concerning the ASSU Senate's action
at its March 2 meeting on the Black
Students Union's (BSU's) fee as
sessment request, and specifically
my role in that action. This spring a
student organization can request a
fee assessment by either securing a 20
percent petition of the student body
or a 10 percent petition and approval
of 11 senators (3/5 of the current
membership). At its March 2 meeting
the senate voted 10-3 to ap
prove the BSU request, one yes vote
short of the required 11, and thus the
BSU had to secure a 20 percent peti
tion. I was one of the three who
voted no.
Senators have reasons for their
votes; the senate, as a body, does
not have any "reason" for its deci
sions. Assigning to a group of people
a set of "reasons" for their collective
decision is usually misleading, un
fair and displays a total lack of com
prehension of reality. The BSU's as
sertion (Daily, March 9) that senators
acted on "their own racial biases" in
failing to approve the BSU request is
false on its face if you include in that
ret koning the 10 senators who voted
in favor of the BSU request, let alone
those who were absent. Thus con
demning all senators, or the senate
as an institution, strikes me as a sim
ple exercise in meaningless rhetoric.
Senator Roc Blumenthal has stated
his reasons for voting against the BSU
request (Daily, March 9). The principle
reason why I also voted no was the lack
of perceived support for this request
among those students whom I repre
sentâ€” graduates in the Humanities and
Sciences. The single most frequent
complaint I have received from
graduate students this year is the large
amount of ASSU fees. I could not justify
to myself voting yes for any student or
ganization which did not significantly
benefit this half of the student body.
Indeed, of the 14 fee requests consi
dered by the senate, I voted yes for only
three (Legal Counseling, the Speaker's
Bureau and the Graduate Student As

sociation). My perceptions of support
were mainly shaped by information
provided by the concerned student or
ganization and by input from graduate
students I have talked to this year.
My position on this issue was
hardly secret, and my previous vot
ing record demonstrated that I
would abide by it. I explicitly stated
this reason at the BSU meeting on
March 6. In light of this I can only
interpret the BSU statement of
March 9, which totally ignored this
reason while ascribing to me and my
colleagues other reasons (such as
"racial bias"), as an attempt at "mis
information."
Although I had decided weeks ago
not to vote in favor of the BSU re
quest (always barring last minute in
formation), it was still possible that I
would have abstained on this issue
rather than vote no. This distinction
would not have any effect upon the
outcome of the vote, but it would be
taken as a personal statement of the
validity of the request. I finally de
cided to vote no for three reasons.
First, ultimate approval of this fee
request would result in a significant
shifting of the funding burden for
student activities from the University
directly onto the shoulders of the
student body. I have always op
posed, and will continue to oppose,
any attempts by the University to in
crease a student's financial burden
without strong justification. Al
though I recognize the time burden
University fund raising places upon
the officers of the BSU, and have
continuously worked to reduce all
unnecessary burdens in the ASSU's
own funding process, the basic re
quirement that student organiza
tions justify their request for funds is
certainly a reasonable one.
Second, the BSU provides many
support services for other student
organizations. This makes com
pliance with the provisions of the
new fee assessment system quite dif
ficult. It also means that the most

central black student organization
would be funded by the least stable
source of funding.
In 1980 the BSU considered seek
ing a fee assessment, but decided
that the risks of losing both student.
and University funding was too
great. My experience reinforces this
conclusion. Since then theclimateof
University funding has become, if
anything, less stable. The BSU rever
sal on this issue is puzzling on its
face. No attempt was made by the
officers of the BSU to explain this
turnabout, even after the point was
raised by a number of senators.
Finally, the treasurer of the BSU
assured me that, if the BSU failed in
getting a fee assessment, it would
apply for University funding. This
leads me to conclude that the BSU's
fee request is not even necessary, let
alone justifiable or wise.
In sum, the BSU did little to justify
its fee request, relying upon charges
of "racism" to blackmail individuals
to support their request without re
gard to its merits.
I have always encouraged people
to get involved in the ASSU, to lobby
for their ideas, and to provide me
with information I need to make
sometimes difficult decisions with a
greater degree of confidence. I en
couraged and supported the efforts
of the Band to get a fair rehearing
before the senate when they pre
sented new information about their
fee request. The opponents of the
McCloskey Guest Professorship did
a very good lobbying job, and I en
couraged and appreciated their ef
forts. In both cases I thought the
process was an informative one car
ried out in good faith by all parties. I
only wish I could say the same with
respect to the BSU fee request.
I strongly encourage people to talk
to me on this or any other issue if
they have questions or wish to pro
vide input into any decision of the
senate.
