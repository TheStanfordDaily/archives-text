# Golubs!?! Give us semesters!
## 
### 
I'm spending a lot of time asking
myself why. Why? Why? This ques
tion is not simply a manifestation of
despairing existentialism. I save that
emotional paralysis for the middle of
long essays on final exams, for wea
ther predictions involving precipita
tion and for the fifth consecutive day
of eating hamburger. No, right now I
am asking myself, why the quarter
system?
This year is my first experience
with the quarter system, after four
years of semesters. Frankly, I remain
unimpressed. Two weeks of Christ
mas vacation? That's tough on those
of us who live outside the Bay Area.
Who can possibly support three fi
nals periods each year if we could
have fewer? Who wants to attend
school in June? I don't really care
when school starts (how much vaca
tion can a guy fa/ce?), but I would like
it to end as early as possible.
Apparently, though, Stanford in
tends to keep (and even to admire)
its quarter system. Earlier this year,
the Faculty Senate decided to stay
with the system over other proposed
alternatives. An informal poll by the
Daily ("Quarter system favored,"
Jan. 21) revealed that students prefer
the quarter system for three main
reasons: greater variety in course of
ferings, less time for procrastination
and a more rapid escape from boring
classes. I imagine that similar reasons
would emerge from a poll of the fac
ulty, although those results would be
more verbose and harder to sum
marize.
I suppose the reasons are reason
able enough, but I don't much ap
prove of them, for they seem to
imply a distaste for what is precious
in the experience of a university edu
cation. Why do people want greater
variety in courses? Clearly, because
they don't much like the classes they
are in now, and they want to try some
new ones. Why are people worried
about procrastinating? Well, be
cause they don't much like their clas
ses, and unless they have the whip of
finals nearby, they simply won't do
any work. The last reason is clear
enough. Classes are boring, and un
less people change frequently they
will simply be so BORED that they
will be incapable of having a good
time at parties.

Given this (boring) logical and
metaphysical underpinning, the
ideal system of higher education,
with maximum flexibility and a
minimum of that distasteful persis
tence and responsibility, would in
volve classes that met only twice, to
tal, perhaps a week apart. Lots of
variety, no time to procrastinate, and
an exciting new class every week.
Educational Utopia.
This criticism may strike you as
overdone, harsh, shortsighted and
generally foolish. And of course, in
large part it is all of those things. Few
of us would work as hard without
deadlines and other academic whips.
Some subjects, such as introductory
languages, require lots of time spent
in class, lots of drills and lots of
checkups. At the university level,
however, those classes should not
be the main focus.
A university education is special
because it is the time that you are
beginning to take over the responsi
bility of educating yourself. Every
reading and exercise is no longer
explicitly assigned. You begin to
seek out professors, pursue some of
your own interests, and do some in
dependent research. The process in
volves some pain, a lot of effort, and
some boredom, but the rewards of
education don't come from just
doing the assignments and getting
by. Real education happens when
you are self-motivated enough to
seek out and absorb new ideas.
What other academic schedules
have been proposed? One idea is to
split the year into six five-week
Golubs, so named for their
' originator. This system would allow
i quarter classes to be given for two
Golubs, and semester classes to last
for three Golubs. Faculty and stu
-1 dents could plan the schedule that
' suited their tastes and philosophies.
The greatest part of this idea is that
I we could all tell our non-university
- friends that our year was "well into
■ the second Golub, but the third
112 Golub looks like it will be a lot

worse." Don't you just love the
name? It's like going to school in
Lord of the Rings or Wind in the Wil
lows. Otherwise, though, chaos sur
rounds the idea. Six registration
periods each year? Six exam periods?
Regular class meetings overlapping
final exams? Sheer chaos. There
must be easier ways of promising
everyone everything they want, but
there can't be many that would
create more confusion. You would
need an advanced degree just to fig
ure out your transcript.
Since I'm generally reactionary
and I lived with semesters as an un
dergraduate, I favor that system. If
you need flexibility, you can still
offer classes for half credit, or for half
a semester. A normal classload might
be four classes a semester, meeting
for a total of 12 hours each week.
That schedule implies fewer classes
in a year (eight, not nine) and less
time spent in class per class each
week (three hours, not four). Stu
dents would have more time for con
sideration, reading and research
outside of class, and a heavier con
centration of attention on each class.
I fear that balance is necessary in
most things, academic scheduling
decisions not excepted. (Here comes
a concession to the forces of mod
eration.) While a crusade for semes
ters might be less boring, I don't ex
pect that the choice between quar
ters, Golubsand semesters will make
or break the future of California edu
cation. But if a choice is to be made,
Stanford should choose semesters,
because the chance to really get in
side of subjects and explore them in
' your own way is what higher educa
i tion is all about. Semesters provide a
t little less pressure from exams and
deadlines, and a little more time to
t digest and reflect; in the end, that's
where education happens.

years of semesters. Frankly, I remain
unimpressed. Two weeks of Christ
mas vacation? That's tough on those
of us who live outside the Bay Area.
Who can possibly support three fi
nals periods each year if we could
have fewer? Who wants to attend
school in June? I don't really care
when school starts (how much vaca
tion can a guy fa/ce?), but I would like
it to end as early as possible.
Apparently, though, Stanford in
tends to keep (and even to admire)
its quarter system. Earlier this year,
the Faculty Senate decided to stay
with the system over other proposed
alternatives. An informal poll by the
Daily ("Quarter system favored,"
Jan. 21) revealed that students prefer
the quarter system for three main
reasons: greater variety in course of
ferings, less time for procrastination
and a more rapid escape from boring
classes. I imagine that similar reasons
would emerge from a poll of the fac
ulty, although those results would be
more verbose and harder to sum
marize.
I suppose the reasons are reason
able enough, but I don't much ap
prove of them, for they seem to
imply a distaste for what is precious
in the experience of a university edu
cation. Why do people want greater
variety in courses? Clearly, because
they don't much like the classes they
are in now, and they want to try some
new ones. Why are people worried
about procrastinating? Well, be
cause they don't much like their clas
ses, and unless they have the whip of
finals nearby, they simply won't do
any work. The last reason is clear
enough. Classes are boring, and un
less people change frequently they
will simply be so BORED that they
will be incapable of having a good
time at parties.

Given this (boring) logical and
metaphysical underpinning, the
ideal system of higher education,
with maximum flexibility and a
minimum of that distasteful persis
tence and responsibility, would in
volve classes that met only twice, to
tal, perhaps a week apart. Lots of
variety, no time to procrastinate, and
an exciting new class every week.
Educational Utopia.
This criticism may strike you as
overdone, harsh, shortsighted and
generally foolish. And of course, in
large part it is all of those things. Few
of us would work as hard without
deadlines and other academic whips.
Some subjects, such as introductory
languages, require lots of time spent
in class, lots of drills and lots of
checkups. At the university level,
however, those classes should not
be the main focus.
A university education is special
because it is the time that you are
beginning to take over the responsi
bility of educating yourself. Every
reading and exercise is no longer
explicitly assigned. You begin to
seek out professors, pursue some of
your own interests, and do some in
dependent research. The process in
volves some pain, a lot of effort, and
some boredom, but the rewards of
education don't come from just
doing the assignments and getting
by. Real education happens when
you are self-motivated enough to
seek out and absorb new ideas.
What other academic schedules
have been proposed? One idea is to
split the year into six five-week
Golubs, so named for their
' originator. This system would allow
i quarter classes to be given for two
Golubs, and semester classes to last
for three Golubs. Faculty and stu
-1 dents could plan the schedule that
' suited their tastes and philosophies.
The greatest part of this idea is that
I we could all tell our non-university
- friends that our year was "well into
■ the second Golub, but the third
112 Golub looks like it will be a lot

worse." Don't you just love the
name? It's like going to school in
Lord of the Rings or Wind in the Wil
lows. Otherwise, though, chaos sur
rounds the idea. Six registration
periods each year? Six exam periods?
Regular class meetings overlapping
final exams? Sheer chaos. There
must be easier ways of promising
everyone everything they want, but
there can't be many that would
create more confusion. You would
need an advanced degree just to fig
ure out your transcript.
Since I'm generally reactionary
and I lived with semesters as an un
dergraduate, I favor that system. If
you need flexibility, you can still
offer classes for half credit, or for half
a semester. A normal classload might
be four classes a semester, meeting
for a total of 12 hours each week.
That schedule implies fewer classes
in a year (eight, not nine) and less
time spent in class per class each
week (three hours, not four). Stu
dents would have more time for con
sideration, reading and research
outside of class, and a heavier con
centration of attention on each class.
I fear that balance is necessary in
most things, academic scheduling
decisions not excepted. (Here comes
a concession to the forces of mod
eration.) While a crusade for semes
ters might be less boring, I don't ex
pect that the choice between quar
ters, Golubsand semesters will make
or break the future of California edu
cation. But if a choice is to be made,
Stanford should choose semesters,
because the chance to really get in
side of subjects and explore them in
' your own way is what higher educa
i tion is all about. Semesters provide a
t little less pressure from exams and
deadlines, and a little more time to
t digest and reflect; in the end, that's
where education happens.

The view from normalcy

I'm spending a lot of time asking
myself why. Why? Why? This ques
tion is not simply a manifestation of
despairing existentialism. I save that
emotional paralysis for the middle of
long essays on final exams, for wea
ther predictions involving precipita
tion and for the fifth consecutive day
of eating hamburger. No, right now I
am asking myself, why the quarter
system?
This year is my first experience
with the quarter system, after four
years of semesters. Frankly, I remain

mas vacation? That's tough on those
