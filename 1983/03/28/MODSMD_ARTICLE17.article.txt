## Priority system 
### 
The Committee on Student
Services-Residences has decided to
keep the present Returning-
Resident-Priority System. I support
this decision. Continuity is abso
lutely essential, especially in a house
like Haus Mitt, where we do a lot of
programming.
There isonechange that should be
made in the Draw System. At present
Guaranteed/Unguaranteed status is
ignored once a person is placed in
the "Assignable Pool." I believe that
a person in a Guaranteed year should
(priorities being equal) receive prior
ity over someone in an unguaranteed
year. Example: Sue is guaranteed
and draws 3000, Sally is unguaran
teed and draws 1000, and so is placed
in the Assignable Pool. Presently
Sally would be placed before Sue (if
they both had S-2 priority for Lambda
Nu, for example, Sally would have a
good chance to get in but Sue would
have virtually none).
This change would be easy to im
plement. Reprogramming the com
puter would be as simple as adding
5000 to the draw number of anyone
in an unguaranteed year, thus
guaranteeing that guaranteed
people would have first priority.
