# A 						broad spectrum of student travel options open
## 
### BEVERLY BERMUDEZ 
Though Stanford has an excellent
Overseas Studies program, many
other options are available for stu
dent travel abroad.
The Bechtel International Center is
designed to bring foreign and U.S.
students together. A few activities
include Sunday suppers featuring
different international meals each
week and luncheon groups at which
guests listen to guest speakers ad
dress international topics or discuss
world issues.
Catherine Gamon, assistant direc
tor of the Overseas Resource Center
at the International Center, said the
center provides information on the
variety of opportunities available to
students interested in study, work or
travel abroad. In addition, the center
gives information about Fullbright
grants, Marshall and Rhodes scholar
ships and other scholarships for
study and research abroad.
In addition to providing advisory
services, the Resource Center has a
library of catalogs, pamphlets, list
ings and books about the educa
tional opportunities, employment
possibilities and travel guidelines
overseas. These resources are open
to all students here.
This information is usually
supplementary to that provided by
the Stanford Overseas Program. But
students going overseas through the
University do use the Overseas Re
source Center to obtain their inter
national student I.D. card and gen
eral travel information.
According to Cynthia Lazaroff, an
advisor at the Overseas Resource
Center, students can choose from
programs, enrollment in a foreign
university or participation in an
American university program.
Some host countries sponsor lan
guage programs. The student ar
ranges his own housing and paper
work (visa, resident permit, etc.) and
goes to school with a mixed interna
tional student body. The level of in

volvement in university and com
munity life is up to the individual.
The academic programs usually
stress language and culture and cre-

dit transfer varies from program to
program.
A second pathway to studying
overseas is enrolling directly in a
foreign university. The student must
be fluent in the native language, be
cause such an option demands social
and academic immersion in univer
sity life, Lazaroff added.
Laurie Kagan, an international rela
tions student here, independently
enrolled at England's University at
Warwick. Her objective was to ob
serve British students' perspectives
on issues, she said. She added that
living in the dorms with the British
students would most benefit her un
derstanding of their ideals and cus
toms. Kagan also viewed going ab

road alone as being "more challeng
ing" and confidence-building than
going with a group.
The third alternative is participa
tion in any American university
sponsored program. Many schools
have varied programs in different
countries.
Seniorßick Rickertson, an industrial
engineering major, took advantage
of Semester at Sea, a program spon
sored by the University of Pittsburgh.
Approximately 500 students and 150
staff, faculty and crew sail "around
the world" on a 16,000-ton ocean
liner. The ship sails 50 percent of the
semester and stays at port the other
half of the semester. Students spend
about five days in each of several

countries: Japan, Taiwan, Hong
Kong (including mainland China), Is
rael, Turkey, Greece and Spain. Ric
kertson stressed the friendships built
between faculty and students due to
the similar shared experiences. Be
fore each port of call, an expert on
each country would orient the stu
dents.
They would then travel in groups
of two or three. Rickertson said the
small-sized travel groups allowed for
extensive contact with the locals in
each country. Locals are more willing
to approach a smaller group and in
vite them for supper than a larger
group, he said.

and he "would give anything to go

Of course, studying is not the only
thing to do overseas. The Overseas
Resources Center has information
concerning work opportunities ab
road. Its library has general and
specific information organized by
country. It also includes long-term
job information about international
corporations and organizations.
Lazaroff said the council on Inter
national Educational Exchange, de

signed for students who want to
spend a working vacation in Britain,
Ireland, France and New Zealand. It
is one of several work programs av
ailable that provides students v.ith
working papers and a list of pos .ibh
employers. The working papers are
usually good for six months, and the
jobs available range from pub worker
in Dublin to ski instructor «n New
Zealand.
Another organization, Cros
sroads Africa, is a "short-term com
munity development summer work
program in Africa," Lazaroff said.
With this program, graduate
Meredith Wadman traveled to the
Ivory Coast and, with 20 Ivorian* and
nine other foreign students, helped
to build two houses as part of a rural
development in the jungle.
Senior, Naomi Hirahara, an inter
national relations major, worked in <1
clinic for the mentally retarded in
Accra, the capital of Ghana, West Af
rica. The program, sponsored by the
VMCA International and Voluntary
Workcamps of Ghana, lasted four
weeks. She worked with 20 people,
including Ghanaian, British, Dutch
and Japanese students. Her jobs in
cluded planning crafts, athletics and
otheractivities forthechildren, help
ing to build a septic tank and garden
ing at the clinic. Naomi also traveled
to northern Ghana to see rural vil
lages. She cautioned those in
terested to become familiar with the
culture and diseases of the unde
veloped countries.
Some organizations combine
many experiences into one program.
Graduate Julia Hilgard went to Nepal
in 1981 to study, do research arid
travel under the auspices of Experi
ment in International Living. She
lived with a Nepali family and studied
the role of Sherpa women in
Khumba. She said she views being in
the midst of a Nepali household as a
highlight of her stay abroad.
According to Lazaroff, an advisor
at the Overseas Resource Center, the
program is set up to "encourage stu

the midst of a Nepali household as a

According to Lazaroff, an advisor
at the Overseas Resource Center, the
program is set up to "encourage stu
dents to get involved in choosing the
program that's best for them.

Though Stanford has an excellent
Overseas Studies program, many
other options are available for stu
dent travel abroad.
The Bechtel International Center is
designed to bring foreign and U.S.
students together. A few activities
include Sunday suppers featuring
different international meals each
week and luncheon groups at which
guests listen to guest speakers ad
dress international topics or discuss
world issues.
Catherine Gamon, assistant direc
tor of the Overseas Resource Center
at the International Center, said the
center provides information on the
variety of opportunities available to
students interested in study, work or
travel abroad. In addition, the center
gives information about Fullbright
grants, Marshall and Rhodes scholar
ships and other scholarships for
study and research abroad.
In addition to providing advisory
services, the Resource Center has a
library of catalogs, pamphlets, list
ings and books about the educa
tional opportunities, employment
possibilities and travel guidelines
overseas. These resources are open
to all students here.
This information is usually
supplementary to that provided by
the Stanford Overseas Program. But
students going overseas through the
University do use the Overseas Re
source Center to obtain their inter
national student I.D. card and gen
eral travel information.
According to Cynthia Lazaroff, an
advisor at the Overseas Resource
Center, students can choose from
programs, enrollment in a foreign
university or participation in an
American university program.
Some host countries sponsor lan
guage programs. The student ar
ranges his own housing and paper
work (visa, resident permit, etc.) and
goes to school with a mixed interna
tional student body. The level of in

volvement in university and com
munity life is up to the individual.
The academic programs usually
stress language and culture and cre-

dit transfer varies from program to
program.
A second pathway to studying
overseas is enrolling directly in a
foreign university. The student must
be fluent in the native language, be
cause such an option demands social
and academic immersion in univer
sity life, Lazaroff added.
Laurie Kagan, an international rela
tions student here, independently
enrolled at England's University at
Warwick. Her objective was to ob
serve British students' perspectives
on issues, she said. She added that
living in the dorms with the British
students would most benefit her un
derstanding of their ideals and cus
toms. Kagan also viewed going ab

road alone as being "more challeng
ing" and confidence-building than
going with a group.
The third alternative is participa
tion in any American university
sponsored program. Many schools
have varied programs in different
countries.
Seniorßick Rickertson, an industrial
engineering major, took advantage
of Semester at Sea, a program spon
sored by the University of Pittsburgh.
Approximately 500 students and 150
staff, faculty and crew sail "around
the world" on a 16,000-ton ocean
liner. The ship sails 50 percent of the
semester and stays at port the other
half of the semester. Students spend
about five days in each of several

countries: Japan, Taiwan, Hong
Kong (including mainland China), Is
rael, Turkey, Greece and Spain. Ric
kertson stressed the friendships built
between faculty and students due to
the similar shared experiences. Be
fore each port of call, an expert on
each country would orient the stu
dents.
They would then travel in groups
of two or three. Rickertson said the
small-sized travel groups allowed for
extensive contact with the locals in
each country. Locals are more willing
to approach a smaller group and in
vite them for supper than a larger
group, he said.

and he "would give anything to go

Of course, studying is not the only
thing to do overseas. The Overseas
Resources Center has information
concerning work opportunities ab
road. Its library has general and
specific information organized by
country. It also includes long-term
job information about international
corporations and organizations.
Lazaroff said the council on Inter
national Educational Exchange, de

signed for students who want to
spend a working vacation in Britain,
Ireland, France and New Zealand. It
is one of several work programs av
ailable that provides students v.ith
working papers and a list of pos .ibh
employers. The working papers are
usually good for six months, and the
jobs available range from pub worker
in Dublin to ski instructor «n New
Zealand.
Another organization, Cros
sroads Africa, is a "short-term com
munity development summer work
program in Africa," Lazaroff said.
With this program, graduate
Meredith Wadman traveled to the
Ivory Coast and, with 20 Ivorian* and
nine other foreign students, helped
to build two houses as part of a rural
development in the jungle.
Senior, Naomi Hirahara, an inter
national relations major, worked in <1
clinic for the mentally retarded in
Accra, the capital of Ghana, West Af
rica. The program, sponsored by the
VMCA International and Voluntary
Workcamps of Ghana, lasted four
weeks. She worked with 20 people,
including Ghanaian, British, Dutch
and Japanese students. Her jobs in
cluded planning crafts, athletics and
otheractivities forthechildren, help
ing to build a septic tank and garden
ing at the clinic. Naomi also traveled
to northern Ghana to see rural vil
lages. She cautioned those in
terested to become familiar with the
culture and diseases of the unde
veloped countries.
Some organizations combine
many experiences into one program.
Graduate Julia Hilgard went to Nepal
in 1981 to study, do research arid
