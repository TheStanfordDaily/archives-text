# Amos convicted in Arvidson slaying
## 
### GLEN ALLERHAND Staff writer 
San lose deliveryman Donald
Amos was convicted Friday of
second-degree murder for the brutal
stabbing death of Stanford honors
student Angela Arvidson last Oc
tober.
Amos was also convicted of pos
session of stolen property and pos
session of a concealable weapon by
an ex-felon.
He faces 16 years to life in prison
for the murder, and a total maximum
of three years, eight months on the
other charges. Sentencing is
scheduled for April 22.
After John Kennedy, Santa Clara
County superior court judge, read
the verdict, Amos, who appeared
stunned, looked down and wiped his
eyes.
He was shackled in a waist chain
with attached handcuffs and led from
court by a sheriff's deputy. Accom
panying Amos was his attorney, de
puty public defender Randall
Schneider, who consulted with the
defendant for about a half-hour.
Schneider said later he spent some
of the time "trying to quiet" the tear
ful Amos, who sat impassively during
the trial.
The defender, who said he would
file a notice of appeal, added that he

had "good feelings and bad feelings"
about the verdict, which concluded
the seven-day non-jury trial.
"lam delighted that the conviction
was no more than second degree,"
Schneider said. During the trial, the
judge had ruled that there was no
evidence of premeditation or delib
eration, which is required for a first
degree murder conviction.
But Schneider noted that Ms de
fense — that Amos had been suffer
ing from an alcohol-indiced blackout
at the time of the killing — was ham
pered by the judge's restrictions on
introducing evidence.
Deputy district attorney George
Kennedy said, "The verdict is what it
should have been. There's nothing
else he (the judge) could've done."
During his closing argument Friday
morning, the prosecutor had re
jected Amos' defense of uncon
sciousness as the "most inherently
unbelievable story." In announcing
the verdict, the judge agreed.
Outside the San lose courtroom
after the trial, Arvidson's mother and
stepfather, Marlene and Michael
Torrey, expressed their appreciation
to county sheriffs for "being able to
keep this person off the streets." The
Torreys, residents of Portland, Ore
gon, sat in the courtroom through

out the proceedings.
Arvidson, 20, was killed Oct. 22 at
the home of Medical School Prof.
Laurence Kedes, where she cleaned
house part-time to pay for college
expenses. She died of stab wounds
to the throat, chest and abdomen.
Kedes' 16-year-old son Todd, disco
vered Arvidson's body upon return
ing from school that afternoon.

During the trial, the prosecution
argued that Amos had killed Arvid
son while delivering trash can liners
to the Kedes house at 856 Allardice
Way. The prosecutor said that the
"most reasonable view" is that Amos
murdered Arvidson during an at
tempted rape, but he acknowledged
that the evidence was inconclusive.

CONVICTED: Donald lames Amos was convicted of second-degree
murder Friday for the stabbing of Stanford student Angela Arvidson.
The autopsy report showed no signs
of sexual assault.
Amos testified that at first he had
no recollection of going to the
Kedes' house. He said he had gone to
the Stanford Shopping Center to
have lunch and make a delivery to a
bakery. After the delivery, he bought
two large-sized cans of Foster's Lager
beer and drank one while sitting in
his car. He also smoked some
marijuana. Schneider argued that the
alcohol stimulated "psychomotor
epilepsy" (a seizure) in Amos.
Amos said the last thing he re
membered was driving out the El
Camino exit of the shopping center
about 2:35 p.m. The next thing he
remembered was driving on high
way 101 around 4:00 p.m. At that
point, he noticed his shirt was torn
and became "very concerned."
Amos, 30, said his memory was jar
red only after he was in custody and
his wife told him she wanted a di
vorce. He said he began to recall the
October afternoon in "fragments."
The defendent said that when he
arrived at the house, the door was
ajar. He knocked and asked if anyone
was home. Receiving no answer,
Amos said, he pushed open the door
to find Arvidson's bloody body lying
in the voyer.
"I recall seeing a body lying

there," Amos told Schneider, who in
a dramatic gesture placed glossy
color photographs of the murder
scene in front of his client as he tes
tified.
Amos said he picked up Arvidson's
body and placed it on the couch to
"make her comfortable." Then he
"panicked and left," his shirt tearing
as it got caught in the front door.
After the killing, Amos fled from
the area, eluding a manhunt for three
weeks before surrendering to
sheriffs in San lose Nov. 14. At one
point, he stayed in Utah with a friend
from his army days.
Amos was linked to the stabbing by
what the prosecutor called an "ines
capable web of circumstantial evi
dence." On the day of the killing,
Todd Kedes found in his driveway a
delivery invoice containing Amos'
fingerprints.
Searching Amos' San lose apart
ment the day after the murder,
sheriffs found the torn shirt and a
bloody pair of jeans. Criminologist
James Norris testified that the blood
type matched that of the victim.
Norris also testified that purple
cotton fibers found on Amos' clo
thing matched fibers from Arvidson's
blouse.
Furthermore, the prosecution ar
gued, the fact that Amos left San lose
was a clear indication he recognized
his culpability. But the murder
weapon was never found.
The p r osecutor reacted with in

credulity to Amos' contention that he
was unconscious. "People cannot
kill someone, leave the house, drive
away, and go home if they're uncon
scious," Kennedy said in his closing
argument.
"He himself did the murder, he's
the one that did the killing, and he's
convicted himself by this absolutely
ridiculous lie."
Although Kennedy constructed a
convincing circumstantial "web," he
suffered a major setback during the
trial when the judge excluded from
evidence a taped interview between
Amos and sheriff's deputies follow
ing the Nov. 14 surrender. The judge
said Amos did not explicitly waive his
constitutional right to remain silent.
The judge also forbade Schneider
from calling a psychiatrist to testify
about Amos' mental condition. But
the defender told the court that
Amos had been born with brain
damage, which accounted for his
supposed alcohol-caused blackout.
To support his argument, Schneider
recounted a 1976 incident in which
Amos struck a female hitchhiker with
a tire iron. After the incident,
Schneider said, Amos apologized for
his action. He was later acquitted on
assault charges, claiming
"psychomotor epilepsy" as his de
fense.
Amos' criminal record includes
three prior felonv convictions, in
cluding assault, grand thett and sale
of LSD.
