## 
### GLEN ALLERHAND Staff writer 
San lose deliveryman Donald
Amos was convicted Friday of
second-degree murder for the brutal
stabbing death of Stanford honors
student Angela Arvidson last Oc
tober.
Amos was also convicted of pos
session of stolen property and pos
session of a concealable weapon by
an ex-felon.
He faces 16 years to life in prison
for the murder, and a total maximum
of three years, eight months on the
other charges. Sentencing is
scheduled for April 22.
After John Kennedy, Santa Clara
County superior court judge, read
the verdict, Amos, who appeared
stunned, looked down and wiped his
eyes.
He was shackled in a waist chain
with attached handcuffs and led from
court by a sheriff's deputy. Accom
panying Amos was his attorney, de
puty public defender Randall
Schneider, who consulted with the
defendant for about a half-hour.
Schneider said later he spent some
of the time "trying to quiet" the tear
ful Amos, who sat impassively during
the trial.
The defender, who said he would
file a notice of appeal, added that he

had "good feelings and bad feelings"
about the verdict, which concluded
the seven-day non-jury trial.
"lam delighted that the conviction
was no more than second degree,"
Schneider said. During the trial, the
judge had ruled that there was no
evidence of premeditation or delib
eration, which is required for a first
degree murder conviction.
But Schneider noted that Ms de
fense — that Amos had been suffer
ing from an alcohol-indiced blackout
at the time of the killing — was ham
pered by the judge's restrictions on
introducing evidence.
Deputy district attorney George
Kennedy said, "The verdict is what it
should have been. There's nothing
else he (the judge) could've done."
During his closing argument Friday
morning, the prosecutor had re
jected Amos' defense of uncon
sciousness as the "most inherently
unbelievable story." In announcing
the verdict, the judge agreed.
Outside the San lose courtroom
after the trial, Arvidson's mother and
stepfather, Marlene and Michael
Torrey, expressed their appreciation
to county sheriffs for "being able to
keep this person off the streets." The
Torreys, residents of Portland, Ore
gon, sat in the courtroom through

out the proceedings.
Arvidson, 20, was killed Oct. 22 at
the home of Medical School Prof.
Laurence Kedes, where she cleaned
house part-time to pay for college
expenses. She died of stab wounds
to the throat, chest and abdomen.
Kedes' 16-year-old son Todd, disco
vered Arvidson's body upon return
ing from school that afternoon.

During the trial, the prosecution
argued that Amos had killed Arvid
son while delivering trash can liners
to the Kedes house at 856 Allardice
Way. The prosecutor said that the
"most reasonable view" is that Amos
murdered Arvidson during an at
tempted rape, but he acknowledged
that the evidence was inconclusive.
