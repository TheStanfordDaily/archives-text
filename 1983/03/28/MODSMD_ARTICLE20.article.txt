## Petroleum engineering prof. against nuclear option 
### KAREN SPRINGEN 
Alvah "A.J." Horn, 65, is not
what you would expect a re
tired oil company executive to
be. Horn could retire to his
Atherton home and play golf
twice a week, but the wealthy
former Standard Oil Company
executive would rather con
tinue to teach and consult.
Horn owns a 105-mpg
moped, not a Cadillac, and he
rides it into class on the last day
of the quarter to impress con
servation on his students.
When he's not riding his
moped, he drives a '68 Mus
tang which he bought from his
daughter.
Also in the name of conser
vation, he built a solar-heater
in his home and says he shuns
air-conditioners.
Conservation aside, Horn is
best known for the colorful
style of teaching he uses in Pet
roleum Engineering 103, which
dovetails reams of statistics
with anecdotes and phrases
such as "all hell's fire." But he
hesitates to evaluate his teach
ing ability. "A student has to be
the one who's the ultimate
judge," he said.
Trimble, one of Horn's TAs
said, "He's quite the storytel
ler. . . . There's a whole lot of
showman in the guy."
Horn's introductory course,
"Survey of the Energy Indus
try," covers energy alterna
tives. Horn's primary emphasis
in teaching and consulting is
on the operations and
economic evaluation of oil
wells. "I'm glad they (students)
take it. . . he said. "When
the year 2000 comes they won't
be too surprised."
In his course, which some
label a mick, Horn covers
energy alternatives. But he
shies awav from nuclear

energy alternatives for three
reasons. First, he said, the sub
ject matter would "stir up a
whole rage in the community."
Second, it would be extremely
difficult to teach. And third,
the use of nuclear power raises
moral problems. "I don't un
derstand how they can safely
get rid of radioactive waste,"
Horn said. "We have other
readily available alternatives."
Because of what he sees as
potentially harmful effects on
energy conservation, Horn
said he "hates to see the price
of oil come down." He added,
"It's a very sad event."
Three harmful effects of the
oil price drop include the loss
of incentive to conserve, the
false impression that plenty of
oil exists and the discourage
ment of development of alter
native sources until it's too
late. (It takes five to 10 years to
build a single oil shale plant.)
Those who want gas back to
30 cents per gallon are "self
ish," he said, and "have a
short-range viewpoint."
The United States is using oil
and gas at a "horrible" rate.
"We have to buy oil from over
seas," he said.
Horn pointed to astronomi
cal oil usage on the part of the
United States, which is using 15
million barrels of oil per day yet
producing only BVi million bar
rels per day. The United States
uses BVz million barrels for
transportation alone. Despite
these figures, consumption is
increasing, he said,and added
that Americans must recognize
the fundamental truth that oil
and gas supplies are finite.
"Once you use it, it's gone."
On the subject of oil and gas
use, Horn strongly defends the
55 mph speed limit. "The faster
you go, the more power you

need. The more power you
need, the more gasoline you
use."
He also blasted the recent
U.S. embargo of the Soviet
pipeline, calling it "stupid." He
explained, "It would be like
Russia telling Canada 'don't
you dare sell any gas to the Un
ited States' . . . there wouldn't
be any heat in this building."
The United States has only 4
percent of the world's re
serves, while Mexico, "a pro
lific producer," has 10 percent
and Saudi Arabia has 25 per
cent. The Saudis could flood
the market if they so desired,
Horn said.
The Soviet Union, the largest
producer of oil, produces
more than 12 million barrels a
day. By contrast, the United
States produces only 8 million.
Horn can energetically spew
statistics, but it's the way he de
livers them that makes him un
ique to students.
Horn, Class of '39, is the
father of two and grandfather
of seven. He has occupied al
most every rung of the corpo
rate ladder in the oil business,
but now teaching takes prece
dence over all. "Teaching's
number one to me," he said.
But he said he Remains a con
sulting professor — a post
which does not limit his con
sultation time with industry —
in order to afford to teach.
Although he declined to re
veal his earnings, he estimated
that consulting provides 30
percent of his annual income.
Teaching, for which he is paid
by the unit, "comes first at the
lower rate," he said.
Horn also serves on the
board of directors for three
companies. He is an indepen
dent petroleum consultant, an
oil, gas and water well drilling

of conservation.
contractor, oil and gas adviser
to the Stanford Board of Trus
tees and a partner in Layne Oil
Company in Half Moon Bay —
to name a few of his outside
commitments. Most of his
consulting is on the economic
evaluation of wells.
Despite his hard-working
track record, Horn is certainly
not guilty of all work and no
play. Senior Rodger Trimble,
Horn's head teaching assistant
this quarter, said, "The main
thing he's been concerned
about for the past weeks is that
the Stanford Golf Course is
closed because of the rain."

Horn had apparently been
exercising to prepare for the
upcoming season.
He sacrificed precious golf
ing time to be a professor. Be
fore he began to teach, Horn
played golf twice a week. Now
he is lucky if he plays once a
month, he said. His handicap,
which was 10 when he arrived
at Stanford, is now a 15.
When Horn first began to
teach here in 1975, only 23 stu
dents were enrolled in the pet
roleum engineering program.
Currently, there are about 120,
slightly more than half of
whom are graduate students.

He attributed the increase in
interest and enrollment to the
OPEC crisis and the Iranian re
volution.
Horn sees a difference in
student attitudes and aware
ness since the early '70s.
"When I got here most of the
students had been through the
embargo period of '73 and
'74." Then the next "genera
tion" of students saw the price
hike caused by the Iranian re
volution. "Now I'm beginning
to see not a lack of interest but
a lack of living through that
period," he said.
Horn, who obviously has his
finger in a number of different
pies, is far from sedentary. TAs
and students frequently pop in
and out of his tiny office in the
Salvatiori building. The build
ing, Horn proudly points out,
is heated through steam in the
floor.
He relishes interaction with
students and tries to make his
class enjoyable. "Going to
school out to be fun," he said.
"But it isn't just a country
club."
The hard work involved in
majoring in petroleum en
gineering pays off, according

to Horn. Petroleum engineers
are the highest paid of all en
gineers. "Some people like
money," said Horn. "They
learn to like the job."
Both his introductory and
drilling courses concentrate on
the operational rather than
theoretical aspects of pet
roleum engineering.
The department itself re
quires all undergraduates to
have at least one slimmer
working in the industry. Bet
ween sophomore and junior
years, petroleum engineering
students generally work on the
wells as ditch-diggers or pum
pers. The following year most
work in an oil company office.
"Every professor here has
worked for industry," claimed
Horn, who has worked in the
industry for 43 years.
But what do the next few
years have in store for this
professor-consul tan t-di rector
conservationist? Horn admits
three priorities. "I hope to be
able to teach as long as I'm
competent to teach . . .as long
as I feel intellectually compe
tent. My second dream is to
work for world peace. My third
is to play more golf. To hell
with making money."
