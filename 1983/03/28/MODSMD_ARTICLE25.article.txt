# Katsufrakis prepares scholars here for life 'on the ice'
## 
### CHRISTINE RIORDAN 
To the few thousand who have been
on "the ice," the Antarctic is a world
unto itself. Buried in bOOO feet of ice and
surrounded by a savage sea, the white
continent is an intense study in human
isolation and natural phenomena.
Antarctica is a continent literally fro
zen in time. As the world's highest,
driest, coldest, windiest and most re
mote continent, it is nature s last retreat
— indeed a final frontier in terms of
earthly exploration.
"Everything meets there," said )ohn
Katsufrakis, an adjunct professor of
electrical engineering who has been to
the Antarctic. "When you're waiting in
McMurdo (a station) for instance, to go
to Siple (another station) or somewhere
else, the biologist is there, the marine
biologist, the oceanograpner, the
geologist. It is an unbelievable educa
tion."

Siple station is the base of Stanford
research in the Antarctic. It was estab
lished in the mid-'6os by the National
Science Foundation (NSF) to accom
modate the University's proposed ex
perimentation on "the ice." The re
search involves investigating into the
relationship between the Earth'
magnetic field and the atmospnere
Using a 42.2 kilometer antenna, sci
entists simulate the phenomenon of
lightening interaction with particles
and electrons. The particles involved in
this interaction mirror about the
magnetic field. When they meet with a
wave, the particles' angle relative to the
field is altered, so they precipitate out
into the atmosphere.
The station is located at 76 degrees
south and 84 degrees west. The place
ment ot the antenna demands a flat ter
rain; thus, the selected area is one of
the starkest regions in the Antarctic in
terior.
"There's no life whatsoever," Katsuf
rakis explained. "Once you leave the
coast you're isolated. There are no na
tive inhabitants to the region, no ani
mals, no birds. There's nothing there."
Except Siple.
The annual selection of the eight per
sonnel who will "winter-over" on the
continent is a careful and crucial pro
cess, due to the physical and
psychological pressures of isolation in
the extreme.
"An individual and his reasons for
wanting to go to the Antarctic have to
be balanced," said Katsufrakis, who has
been head of the selection of field per
sonnel since the project opened. "It
has to be the primary thing he wants in
that stage of his life.
"He must be able to entertain him
self, handle a heavy workload, and live
with a few others in isolation. The worst

thing in the Antarctic is for the clock not
to move."
Katsufrakis is conscious of the per
sonnel he sends each year to Antarctica
for 9'/i months. They are as important to
him as the research they conduct. He
says the research is rewarding in and of
itself, but it is the people who make it all
worthwhile.
"These young men and women are
so bright. Vou select someone to winter
over, and then you see them now as
deans and top people in different
laboratories. They are all successful.
"It is very, very satisfying," Katsuf
rakis said.
However, Katsufrakis admitted there
have been some "tough situations."
"If you don't keep busy there are
problems," he explained. "The first
thing you start to do is sleep a lot. But
then you feel bad, so you want to be
social."

For some people, Katsufrakis said,
social translates into alcohol.
"Some kids start hitting the liquor so
heavy, they become alcoholics. Of
course, then they come out of the ex
perience and realize what happened,
it's so important to keep busy."
Personal relationships are another
concern of Katsufrakis in terms ot who
he sends to winter in the Antartic. "I've
seen marriages break up, so I always try
not to send a chap who's married or
closely involved. Why should I put both
individuals into a tough situation? It
puts unreal pressure on the relation
ship."
Katsufrakis cited this as the reason he
himself has never "wintered-over" at
Siple.
The attention the professor gives to
the people involved in the Antarctic
project has earned him respect on both
continents.
"You go down to Antarctica and
everybody knows who John Katsufrakis
is," said Curt Carlson, a Ph.D. student
in electrical engineering. Carlson has
spent the summer months at the sta
tion. "He gets a lot of respect here and
in Antarctica. The group would have a
hard time functioning without him."
Robert Helliwell, professor of elec
trical engineering and head of the Stan
ford operation at Siple station, ex
pounded on John Katsufrakis' abilities as
field director. "One of the great suc
cesses of our program is the recruit
ment of high quality, well-trained per
sonnel. )ohn has been responsible for
that aspect of the program from the be
ginning. It's been an outstanding fea
ture of the program since 1973."
In all, there are eight individuals at
Siple during a period of almost 40
weeks. No planes come in, no mail. The
only communication is by means of
radio. Together, from about February

to mid-November, the eight-person
team works to maintain Stanford's op
eration on "the ice."
The average elevation of 7500 feet
and the thick ice layer make the Antarc
tic continent especially conducive to
Stanford's research into the electro
dynamic system (of which the wave
injection/particle interaction process
described previously is a part).
The significance of the research var
ies.
One obvious implication of the pro
cess is in the area of communication,
according to Helliwell. Our research
tells us how waves are amplified in
natural plasmas. Vou can use this pro
cess to amplify a signal for communica
tion purposes.
"Another related communication as
pect is that the precipitated particles in
the atmosphere, ionize the ionosphere
and alter the signals. We have to under
stand that so that we can make better
use of the ionosphere for communica
tion purposes."
A remote, yet viable, implication of
the process is in the realm of "science
fiction," Helliwell said.
"If we send coherent radio waves
from Siple station, they knock particles
into the ionosphere. What that does is
modify the ionosphere, which changes
our atmosphere. This may have some
interesting implications for atmos
pheric control, which ultimately will be
derived from these kind of experi
ments," he explained.
Katsufrakis sees the future of ex
perimentation, such as that conducted
at Siple station, Antarctica, in space.
"What's coming up in 1987 is the
>pace shuttle," Katsufrakis said, "which
is essentially a small-scale version of
Siple."
For the time being, Katsufrakis envi
sions improvements at Siple in terms of
internationalizing the station. "One
thing I would like to see accomplished
at the facility at Siple is something of the
nature of an international facility. The
Germans would pa r ticipate, the
French, the Japanese and the Russians.
It would spread the costs a little," he
said.
Katsufrakis described a "good rap
port" between Russian and American
scientists in the Antarctic ("the political
nonsense is back home"), and he said it
seems the feelings are reciprocated.
The Soviets honored Kutsufrakis some
years ago for his work in the Antarctic.
More recently, Katsufrakis received
the NSF's Distinguished Service
Award in 1982.
Though Katsufrakis said he hopes to
retire in about the next five years, his
activity in the research conducted at
Siple is at much the same level it has
always been. He also provides exper
tise for new stations and assists in the
selection of personnel for other sta
tions.
"The way things are going," Katsuf
rakis explained, "I'll probably just
finish what I'm doing. I won't go into
any other work."
But to his colleagues and the person
nel involved in Stanford at Antarctica,
the work he has put into the project at
Siple station is invaluable.
Not only has his knowledge on a sci
entific level kept the Stanford program
on "the ice," but so to has his know
ledge of the individual. Although An
tarctica sustains no life in its stark in
terior, Katsufrakis does.

ies.
One obvious implication of the pro
cess is in the area of communication,
according to Helliwell. Our research
tells us how waves are amplified in
natural plasmas. Vou can use this pro
cess to amplify a signal for communica
tion purposes.
"Another related communication as
pect is that the precipitated particles in
the atmosphere, ionize the ionosphere
and alter the signals. We have to under
stand that so that we can make better
use of the ionosphere for communica
tion purposes."
A remote, yet viable, implication of
the process is in the realm of "science
fiction," Helliwell said.
"If we send coherent radio waves
from Siple station, they knock particles
into the ionosphere. What that does is
modify the ionosphere, which changes
our atmosphere. This may have some
interesting implications for atmos
pheric control, which ultimately will be
derived from these kind of experi
ments," he explained.
Katsufrakis sees the future of ex
perimentation, such as that conducted
at Siple station, Antarctica, in space.
"What's coming up in 1987 is the
>pace shuttle," Katsufrakis said, "which
is essentially a small-scale version of
Siple."
For the time being, Katsufrakis envi
sions improvements at Siple in terms of
internationalizing the station. "One
thing I would like to see accomplished
at the facility at Siple is something of the
nature of an international facility. The
Germans would pa r ticipate, the
French, the Japanese and the Russians.
It would spread the costs a little," he
said.
Katsufrakis described a "good rap
port" between Russian and American
scientists in the Antarctic ("the political
nonsense is back home"), and he said it
seems the feelings are reciprocated.
The Soviets honored Kutsufrakis some
years ago for his work in the Antarctic.
More recently, Katsufrakis received
the NSF's Distinguished Service
Award in 1982.
Though Katsufrakis said he hopes to
retire in about the next five years, his
activity in the research conducted at
Siple is at much the same level it has
always been. He also provides exper
tise for new stations and assists in the
selection of personnel for other sta
tions.
"The way things are going," Katsuf
rakis explained, "I'll probably just
finish what I'm doing. I won't go into
any other work."
But to his colleagues and the person
nel involved in Stanford at Antarctica,
the work he has put into the project at
Siple station is invaluable.
Not only has his knowledge on a sci
entific level kept the Stanford program
on "the ice," but so to has his know

John Katsufrakis


ON THE ICE: The above South Pole station is maintained by
the U.S. Government but is similar to Siple Station, the

University base of operations in Antarctica. John Kutsuf
rakis has been to Antarctica more than 10 times.
To the few thousand who have been
on "the ice," the Antarctic is a world
unto itself. Buried in bOOO feet of ice and
surrounded by a savage sea, the white
continent is an intense study in human
isolation and natural phenomena.
Antarctica is a continent literally fro
zen in time. As the world's highest,
driest, coldest, windiest and most re
mote continent, it is nature s last retreat
— indeed a final frontier in terms of
earthly exploration.
"Everything meets there," said )ohn
Katsufrakis, an adjunct professor of
electrical engineering who has been to
the Antarctic. "When you're waiting in
McMurdo (a station) for instance, to go
to Siple (another station) or somewhere
else, the biologist is there, the marine
biologist, the oceanograpner, the
geologist. It is an unbelievable educa
tion."

Siple station is the base of Stanford
research in the Antarctic. It was estab
lished in the mid-'6os by the National
Science Foundation (NSF) to accom
modate the University's proposed ex
perimentation on "the ice." The re
search involves investigating into the
relationship between the Earth'
magnetic field and the atmospnere
Using a 42.2 kilometer antenna, sci
entists simulate the phenomenon of
lightening interaction with particles
and electrons. The particles involved in
this interaction mirror about the
magnetic field. When they meet with a
wave, the particles' angle relative to the
field is altered, so they precipitate out
into the atmosphere.
The station is located at 76 degrees
south and 84 degrees west. The place
ment ot the antenna demands a flat ter
rain; thus, the selected area is one of
the starkest regions in the Antarctic in
terior.
"There's no life whatsoever," Katsuf
rakis explained. "Once you leave the
coast you're isolated. There are no na
tive inhabitants to the region, no ani
mals, no birds. There's nothing there."
Except Siple.
The annual selection of the eight per
sonnel who will "winter-over" on the
continent is a careful and crucial pro
cess, due to the physical and
psychological pressures of isolation in
the extreme.
"An individual and his reasons for
wanting to go to the Antarctic have to
be balanced," said Katsufrakis, who has
been head of the selection of field per
sonnel since the project opened. "It
has to be the primary thing he wants in
that stage of his life.
"He must be able to entertain him
self, handle a heavy workload, and live
with a few others in isolation. The worst

thing in the Antarctic is for the clock not
to move."
Katsufrakis is conscious of the per
sonnel he sends each year to Antarctica
for 9'/i months. They are as important to
him as the research they conduct. He
says the research is rewarding in and of
itself, but it is the people who make it all
worthwhile.
"These young men and women are
so bright. Vou select someone to winter
over, and then you see them now as
deans and top people in different
laboratories. They are all successful.
"It is very, very satisfying," Katsuf
rakis said.
However, Katsufrakis admitted there
have been some "tough situations."
"If you don't keep busy there are
problems," he explained. "The first
thing you start to do is sleep a lot. But
then you feel bad, so you want to be
social."

For some people, Katsufrakis said,
social translates into alcohol.
"Some kids start hitting the liquor so
heavy, they become alcoholics. Of
course, then they come out of the ex
perience and realize what happened,
it's so important to keep busy."
Personal relationships are another
concern of Katsufrakis in terms ot who
he sends to winter in the Antartic. "I've
seen marriages break up, so I always try
not to send a chap who's married or
closely involved. Why should I put both
individuals into a tough situation? It
puts unreal pressure on the relation
ship."
Katsufrakis cited this as the reason he
himself has never "wintered-over" at
Siple.
The attention the professor gives to
the people involved in the Antarctic
project has earned him respect on both
continents.
"You go down to Antarctica and
everybody knows who John Katsufrakis
is," said Curt Carlson, a Ph.D. student
in electrical engineering. Carlson has
spent the summer months at the sta
tion. "He gets a lot of respect here and
in Antarctica. The group would have a
hard time functioning without him."
Robert Helliwell, professor of elec
trical engineering and head of the Stan
ford operation at Siple station, ex
pounded on John Katsufrakis' abilities as
field director. "One of the great suc
cesses of our program is the recruit
ment of high quality, well-trained per
sonnel. )ohn has been responsible for
that aspect of the program from the be
ginning. It's been an outstanding fea
ture of the program since 1973."
In all, there are eight individuals at
Siple during a period of almost 40
weeks. No planes come in, no mail. The
only communication is by means of
radio. Together, from about February

to mid-November, the eight-person
team works to maintain Stanford's op
eration on "the ice."
The average elevation of 7500 feet
and the thick ice layer make the Antarc
tic continent especially conducive to
Stanford's research into the electro
dynamic system (of which the wave
injection/particle interaction process
described previously is a part).

to move."
Katsufrakis is conscious of the per
sonnel he sends each year to Antarctica
for 9'/i months. They are as important to
him as the research they conduct. He
says the research is rewarding in and of
itself, but it is the people who make it all
worthwhile.
"These young men and women are
so bright. Vou select someone to winter
over, and then you see them now as
deans and top people in different
laboratories. They are all successful.
"It is very, very satisfying," Katsuf
rakis said.
However, Katsufrakis admitted there
have been some "tough situations."
"If you don't keep busy there are
problems," he explained. "The first
thing you start to do is sleep a lot. But
then you feel bad, so you want to be
social."

For some people, Katsufrakis said,
social translates into alcohol.
"Some kids start hitting the liquor so
heavy, they become alcoholics. Of
course, then they come out of the ex
perience and realize what happened,
it's so important to keep busy."
Personal relationships are another
concern of Katsufrakis in terms ot who
he sends to winter in the Antartic. "I've
seen marriages break up, so I always try
not to send a chap who's married or
closely involved. Why should I put both
individuals into a tough situation? It
puts unreal pressure on the relation
ship."
Katsufrakis cited this as the reason he
himself has never "wintered-over" at
Siple.
The attention the professor gives to
the people involved in the Antarctic
project has earned him respect on both
continents.
"You go down to Antarctica and
everybody knows who John Katsufrakis
is," said Curt Carlson, a Ph.D. student
in electrical engineering. Carlson has
spent the summer months at the sta
tion. "He gets a lot of respect here and
in Antarctica. The group would have a
hard time functioning without him."
Robert Helliwell, professor of elec
trical engineering and head of the Stan
ford operation at Siple station, ex
pounded on John Katsufrakis' abilities as
field director. "One of the great suc
cesses of our program is the recruit
ment of high quality, well-trained per
sonnel. )ohn has been responsible for
that aspect of the program from the be
ginning. It's been an outstanding fea
ture of the program since 1973."
In all, there are eight individuals at
Siple during a period of almost 40
weeks. No planes come in, no mail. The
only communication is by means of
radio. Together, from about February

to mid-November, the eight-person
team works to maintain Stanford's op
eration on "the ice."
The average elevation of 7500 feet
and the thick ice layer make the Antarc
tic continent especially conducive to
Stanford's research into the electro
dynamic system (of which the wave
injection/particle interaction process
described previously is a part).
The significance of the research var
ies.
One obvious implication of the pro
cess is in the area of communication,
according to Helliwell. Our research
tells us how waves are amplified in
natural plasmas. Vou can use this pro
cess to amplify a signal for communica
tion purposes.
"Another related communication as
pect is that the precipitated particles in
the atmosphere, ionize the ionosphere
and alter the signals. We have to under
stand that so that we can make better
use of the ionosphere for communica
tion purposes."
A remote, yet viable, implication of
the process is in the realm of "science
fiction," Helliwell said.
"If we send coherent radio waves
from Siple station, they knock particles
into the ionosphere. What that does is
modify the ionosphere, which changes
our atmosphere. This may have some
interesting implications for atmos
pheric control, which ultimately will be
derived from these kind of experi
ments," he explained.
Katsufrakis sees the future of ex
perimentation, such as that conducted
at Siple station, Antarctica, in space.
"What's coming up in 1987 is the
>pace shuttle," Katsufrakis said, "which
is essentially a small-scale version of
Siple."
For the time being, Katsufrakis envi
sions improvements at Siple in terms of
internationalizing the station. "One
thing I would like to see accomplished
at the facility at Siple is something of the
nature of an international facility. The
Germans would pa r ticipate, the
French, the Japanese and the Russians.
It would spread the costs a little," he
said.
Katsufrakis described a "good rap
port" between Russian and American
scientists in the Antarctic ("the political
nonsense is back home"), and he said it
seems the feelings are reciprocated.
The Soviets honored Kutsufrakis some
years ago for his work in the Antarctic.
More recently, Katsufrakis received
the NSF's Distinguished Service
Award in 1982.
Though Katsufrakis said he hopes to
retire in about the next five years, his
activity in the research conducted at
Siple is at much the same level it has
always been. He also provides exper
tise for new stations and assists in the
selection of personnel for other sta
tions.
"The way things are going," Katsuf
rakis explained, "I'll probably just
finish what I'm doing. I won't go into
any other work."
But to his colleagues and the person
nel involved in Stanford at Antarctica,
the work he has put into the project at
Siple station is invaluable.
Not only has his knowledge on a sci
entific level kept the Stanford program
on "the ice," but so to has his know
ledge of the individual. Although An
tarctica sustains no life in its stark in
terior, Katsufrakis does.

ON THE ICE: The above South Pole station is maintained by
the U.S. Government but is similar to Siple Station, the

University base of operations in Antarctica. John Kutsuf
rakis has been to Antarctica more than 10 times.
