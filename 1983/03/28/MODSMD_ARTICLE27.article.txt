### FAY DUTTNER 
Will the recent drop in oil prices mean a re
turn to bigger cars? What role will nuclear power
play in the next 20 years? Can 40 percent of our
future energy needs be met by renewable
sources?
More specifically, will we take the "soft path"
(renewable energies from wind, hydro, solar
and biomass sources) or the "hard path" (ener
gies from oil, coal, natural gas and nuclear
sources)? This choice will be addressed this
spring in a course/open public forum, "The En
ergy Controversy: Soft Paths Under Fire."
The course shows that students can plan and
institute new curriculum here.
A combination of lectures, authors and pro
fessors will teach the course on Tuesday and
Thursday evenings from 7:30 p.m. to 9 p.m. The
featured speakers will be Amory and Hunter
Lovins, co-authors of the controversial thesis of
the "soft path" and the book Brittle Power. Argu
ing that an energy policy based on conservation
and renewable energy resources would be
more inexpensive, efficient, safe and democra
tic, the Lovins' will deliver many of the lectures.
Bertram Wolfe, director of the San lose Gen
eral Electric Nuclear Division, Barbara Bar
kovith, commissioner of the California Public
Utilities Commission, and Rene Males of the
Electric Power Research Institute will present
arguments in favor of the opposing, or "hard
path," viewpoint.
Speakers will present their views, and stu
dents will have the opportunity to debate the
issues presented after the presentation and in
sections, according to Moose Shuman, course
organizer. He said the symposium should pro
vide students with a basis for knowledgeable
decision-making by exposing them to the spec
trum of future energy alternatives and their
economic, political and environmental implica
tions.
The course, emphasizing policy and technol
ogy, can be taken both undergraduate and
graduate. It will satisfy the Values, Technology
and Society Area 9 requirement for engineering

majors.
The course was the brainchild of several stu
dents of engineering, law and public policy. The
organizers have been working since early au
tumn, with the help of several faculty and com
munity advisors.
According to an organizing committee
member, senior Mark Hydeman, the specific
speakers were selected and invited because
they were "experts" who held firmly to a spe
cific viewpoint. The group decided that a bal
anced presentation of guest speakers would
best convey an up-to-date picture on the field
and present both theoretical and practical per
spectives.
The course syllabus was arranged around the
proposed speakers. The committee then pre
pared a presentation of the entire course propo
sal, which it submitted for approval to the En
gineering Department and Undergraduate Spe
cials so students could gain credit for the
course.
Difficulties in coordinating the busy
schedules of guests with University time
schedules forced the committee to make many
changes in its original proposal, according to
graduate student Jon Raab of the student or
ganizing committee. The group decided that an
evening course would best accommodate all in
terested parties.
Funding came from several campus and
community sources. According to senior Seth
Zuckerman, a student organizer, the Speakers
Bureau, Stanford for Environmental Education,
the Energy Modeling Forum, the Stanford En
gineering Association, and the Stanford Arms
Control and Disarmament Forum have prom
ised monetary support. Funding is pending ap
proval from the Guest Professorship Board and
the Public Policy Symposia Committee.
Upon approval of the course, just before
spring break, the student committee made .1
champagne toast to the successful presentation
of "The Energy Controversy: Soft Paths Under
Fire."
