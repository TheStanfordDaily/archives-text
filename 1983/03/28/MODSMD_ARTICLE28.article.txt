## Women splash to NCAA crown at Lincoln 
### MARK ZEIGLER 
Stanford's women's swim
ming and diving team turned
the tables on the Florida Gators
in Lincoln, Neb., March 18-20
to win the NCAA crown.
Last year, the Gators won the
first-ever NCAA women's
championships while swim
ming in their home pool. But at
a neutral site a year later, Stan
ford was able to outscore Flori
da 418.5 to 389.5 and bring
home the title.
Since the NCAA Women's
Swimming and Diving Cham
pionships were started last
year, the 1983 title marks Stan
ford's first NCAA title. How
ever, the Card women won the
former AIAW championship in
1980.
Unlike a Florida team that
features Olympian Tracy
Caulkins, Stanford relied on a
strong team effort, receiving
scoring from 15 women to hold
off a Florida comeback on the
third and final day.*
The Cardinal, which led all
the way, got off to a fast start,
scoring 172.5 on the first day to
Florida's 150.5 and Texas' 110.
After day two, Stanford had
widened its lead to 66 points
over the Gators and 110.5 over
the Longhorns.
Florida charged back on the
final day of events to make it
close, but Stanford's 800-free
style relay placed first to push
coach George Haines and his
Cardinal squad over the 400
point mark.
Sophomore Marybeth
Linzmeier paced the Cardinal
with firsts in the 500 and 1650
freestyles, breaking collegiate
records in both races with
times of 4:39.95 and 16:03.76,
respectively.
Linzmeier, who won the 200,
500 and 1650 frees at last year's
NCAA meet, also anchored the
Card's victorious 800 free relay
team.
Stanford picked up the bulk
of its points in the relays, which
count double in a cham
pionship style meet. Of the five
relays, Stanford won three
(200-free, 800-free and 200-
medley) and was second in the
other two (400 free and

medley).
But it was the consistent, non
first-place scoring by the rest of
Stanford's team that made the
difference.
On the first day, junior Sherri
Hanna placed fourth in the 500
free with a 4:48.09 while Patty
Gavin, Libby Kinkead and Kim
Carlisle went 3-4-6 in the 200
back with times of 2:01.29,
2:01.56 and 2:02.74, respective
ly-
In the 50 free, four Stanford
swimmers finished in the top
12. Senior Barb Major was fifth
at 23.53, Kelly Asplund eighth
at 23.51, Krissie Bush ninth at
23.65 and Diane Zock 15th at
23.81.
Gavin came back later in the
first day to place second in the
the 200 individual medley,
clocking a 2:02.00 in a race won
by Florida's Caulkins in a col
legiate record time of 2:00.34.
Stanford junior Anne Tweedy
was ninth with a 2:05.10.
The 200-free relay team of
Bush, Zock, Asplund and Ma
jor got the Cardinal off to a fast
start in the team scoring com
petition by clocking a 1:36.66,
good for first place.
Placing in the top three on
Friday was Carlisle in the 100
back (third with a 56.50) and
Linzmeier in the 200-free (sec
ond with a 1:46.64).
All told, 15 Stanford swim
mers achieved Ail-American
status in one or more events:
seniors Asplund, Major,
Carlisle and Patty Spees; jun
iors Hanna, Tweedy and Bush;
sophomores Jean Meyer and
Isabel Ruess; and freshmen
Gavin, Kinkead, Zock, Kathy
Smith and Lisa Hazen.
And 11 of the 15 scorers re
turn next year, which should
enhance Haines' repeat
chances.
With the Cardinal's first
place finish in 1983, Stanford
reasserted itself as probably the
nation's No. 1 women's swim
ming school. In the last four
years, Stanford has finished no
lower than second place in the
national championship meet
and no lower than third since
1976.
