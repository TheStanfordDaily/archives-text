# Men have trouble scoring, finish fourth
## 
### MARK ZEIGLER 
Indianapolis — "What hap
pened?" is a question Stanford
men's swimming coach Skip
Kenney is going to get sick of
hearing quickly.
But it is the first question that
comes to mind concerning
Stanford's poor showing at the
NCAA championships Thurs
day, Friday and Saturday at In
dianapolis' Natatorium.
Stanford was ranked second
heading into the champion
ships and finished fourth, a
considerable distance behind
the trio of Florida, Southern
Methodist and Texas. Some
thing went wrong.
Junior freestyle swimmer
Ricky Bodor described the
Cardinal's shortcomings best:

"Things just weren't clicking
for us."
The meet was every bit as ex
citing and fast (six new U.S.
Open records were set) as
everyone expected. With one
event left — the 400-yard frees
tyle relay — just five points
separated the top three teams,
making the relay a winner
take-all situation.
But Stanford was not one of
those three teams, and instead
sat on the pool deck during the
relay and watched Florida,
SMU and Texas battle it out tor
the top spot. Florida won the
relay and the bonus that went
along with it — the NCAA title.
SMU was second, followed
closely by Texas.
The Gators finished with 238

points, SMU with 227 and
Texas with 225. Stanford, with
170, headed a group bunched
around 150 points that in
cluded Alabama, UCLA and
Arizona State. UC-Berkeley
placed eighth at 105.5.
"I thought we could win with
depth, but you can't," Kenney
said. "You've got to have the
front-runners " Stanford did
not win any events, although
Card swimmers picked up
three seconds, a third and
three fourths it individual
events.
"We've got a lot of depth,"
he continued, "but it didn't
score."
To score in the NCAA
championship meet, swim

mers and divers must finish in
the top 12 places. Of Stanford's
36 total entries in individual
events, only 14 finished in the
top 12. And all the Cardinal
scoring in individual events
was made by nine members of
the 13-man team, with only
four swimmers breaking the
top six barrier.
I teally think the key word is
expectation. I think you have
to expect to score, expect to
win," Kenney explained. "You
can't go hoping to score, hop
ing to win."
While Texas, SMU and
Florida played hot-potato with
the lead, the Cardinal was
struggling to finish where it
eventually did, in fourth.

After the first day of the
competition, Stanford was in
sixth with a meager 37 points.
After day two the Cardinal had
moved up one notch lo fifth,
but was 50-plus points behind
leader SMU, and hopes of win
ning its first NCAA men's
swimming title since 1967 were
all but ended.

yielded by the speedy
Natatorium competition pool.
Sophomore Dave Bottom
led Cardinal scorers and was
fifth overall with 35 points. Bot
tom took second in the 200-
yard backstroke (1:46.77) and
fourth in both the 100-butterfly
(47.82) and backstroke (49.51).
He also swam the first legs of
Stanford's 400-medley and
freestyle relay teams.
Bottom's real achievements,
however, are not reflected in
the final results. "Dave Bottom
is absolutely a stud," Kenney
said. "I don't know what else
you could call him."
The sophomore star set
American records in the 100-
back twice in six hours,
finished in the top six in races
held less than 10 minutes apart
and in general guided Stanford
to a fourth place finish that eas
ily could have been as low as
eighth.
Bottom broke the national
standard in the 100-back in the
morning time trials of the
400-medley relay with a 48.38
split, more than four-tenths of a
second lower than the previous
mark. In the evening finals, he
broke it again, this time with a
48.30 clocking.
Texas' Rick Carey, however,
lowered the mark even further
the next day in the 100-

backstroke event, swimming a
48.25.
On the second night of
competition, Bottom took
fourth in the 100-fly and then,
with less than 10 minutes rest,
finished fourth in the 100-back,
a double that gained him the
status of a crowd favorite.
But an exhausted, almost de
jected Bottom was as humble as
ever in discussing his double.
"Sure I was tired. But that's no
excuse. Fourth place is fourth
place."
Freshman John Moffet, after
a shaky performance in his
early races, regained his confi
dence and placed second in
both the 100 and 20 0
breaststrokes with times of
54.09and 1:58.56, respectively.
In the distance freestyle
events, junior Dave Sims
finished a disappointing sixth
(4:25.49) in the 500 yard event
despite being seeded first. In
the 1650-free, Sims took third
with a 15:03.19 time. Senior
Bari Weick, the only team
member Stanford will lose next
year, was 11th in the 500-free.
Stanford's only other top six
finisher was John Simons, who
took fourth in the 400-
individual medley with a
3:54.94 clocking. Sophomore
Carter Cast was 11th at 3:56.94,
while Mike Reynolds, )im An
derson, |on Denney and Todd

Lincoln failed to make the top
12 cut.
The Cardinal's relay teams all
swam better than expected,
especially in the freestyle de
partment. The third seeded
400-medley relay team of Bot
tom, Moffet, Mark Michael and
Sam Worden finished second
to SMU with a 3:13.70.
The 800-free relay chopped
nearly four seconds off its sea
son best by clocking a 3:30.68,
good for 11th place. The 400-
free relay team got a little Big
Game revenge by out-touching
Cal's squad at the wall in the
consolation final. Stanford's
2:56.57 time in the race was .16
faster than the Bears'.
Neither of Stanford's divers
that qualified for the NCAAs,
freshmen Thor Johnson and
Tom Rothenbucher, broke into
the top 12 in the one or three
meter events. Johnson was
22nd and Rotherbucher 32nd
in the one-meter, while
Johnson was 32nd in the
three-meter.
The Cardinal's deepest event
was the backstroke. Three
swimmers finished in the top
12 in the 200-back — Bottom in
second, John Engs in ninth and
Mike Conaton in 12th. In the
100-back, Bottom was fourth,
Engs tied for ninth and Con
aton lost a swim-off for the 12th
spot and had to settle to 13th.
