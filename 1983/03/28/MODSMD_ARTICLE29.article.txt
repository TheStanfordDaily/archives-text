# Men have trouble scoring, finish fourth

Indianapolis — "What hap
pened?" is a question Stanford
men's swimming coach Skip
Kenney is going to get sick of
hearing quickly.
But it is the first question that
comes to mind concerning
Stanford's poor showing at the
NCAA championships Thurs
day, Friday and Saturday at In
dianapolis' Natatorium.
Stanford was ranked second
heading into the champion
ships and finished fourth, a
considerable distance behind
the trio of Florida, Southern
Methodist and Texas. Some
thing went wrong.
Junior freestyle swimmer
Ricky Bodor described the
Cardinal's shortcomings best:

"Things just weren't clicking
for us."
The meet was every bit as ex
citing and fast (six new U.S.
Open records were set) as
everyone expected. With one
event left — the 400-yard frees
tyle relay — just five points
separated the top three teams,
making the relay a winner
take-all situation.
But Stanford was not one of
those three teams, and instead
sat on the pool deck during the
relay and watched Florida,
SMU and Texas battle it out tor
the top spot. Florida won the
relay and the bonus that went
along with it — the NCAA title.
SMU was second, followed
closely by Texas.
The Gators finished with 238

points, SMU with 227 and
Texas with 225. Stanford, with
170, headed a group bunched
around 150 points that in
cluded Alabama, UCLA and
Arizona State. UC-Berkeley
placed eighth at 105.5.
"I thought we could win with
depth, but you can't," Kenney
said. "You've got to have the
front-runners " Stanford did
not win any events, although
Card swimmers picked up
three seconds, a third and
three fourths it individual
events.
"We've got a lot of depth,"
he continued, "but it didn't
score."
To score in the NCAA
championship meet, swim

mers and divers must finish in
the top 12 places. Of Stanford's
36 total entries in individual
events, only 14 finished in the
top 12. And all the Cardinal
scoring in individual events
was made by nine members of
the 13-man team, with only
four swimmers breaking the
top six barrier.
I teally think the key word is
expectation. I think you have
to expect to score, expect to
win," Kenney explained. "You
can't go hoping to score, hop
ing to win."
While Texas, SMU and
Florida played hot-potato with
the lead, the Cardinal was
struggling to finish where it
eventually did, in fourth.

After the first day of the
competition, Stanford was in
sixth with a meager 37 points.
After day two the Cardinal had
moved up one notch lo fifth,
but was 50-plus points behind
leader SMU, and hopes of win
ning its first NCAA men's
swimming title since 1967 were
all but ended.
