## 
### GLEN ALLERHAND Staff writer 
Angela Arvidson's mother, Mar
lene Torrey, said she wants her
daughter to be remembered as an
"alive, intelligent, caring per
son."
"Vibrant," added Michael Tor
rey, Angela's stepfather.
The Torreys traveled from their
home in Portland, Ore., to at
tend the trial of Donald Amos,
who was convicted Friday of mur
dering Arvidson, a Stanford

junior, last October.
Sitting through the trial was not
pleasant, the Torreys said in an
interview, but they felt it was im
portant to represent Angela.
"It would've been tragic if
members of Angela's family
hadn't been there," Michael Tor
rey said.
The Torreys said that besides
representing Angela, they were
seeking answers to "millions of
questions" they had about the
murder. Michael Torrey said the
main question is "Why Angela?"
He said he now knows that she
was "in the wrong place at the
wrong time."
Torrey, an industrial relations
manager, said he had been pre
pared to "go through the ordeal"
because of his constant contact
with prosecutor George Kennedy
and Santa Clara County sheriff's
deputies.
"They have patiently answered
our questions," Marlene Torrey,
an elementary school teacher,
added.
She said she maintained her
composure during the trial by
doodling. By the end, she had fil
led at least two pages of stationery
with intricate webs of black ink.
Her husband, during the many

trial recesses, endured the wait
ing by smoking and c hatting with
observers.
During the interview, Marlene
Torrey recalled how her daughter
spent her junior year of high
school studying in France, earn
ing straight As even though all her
courses were taught in French.
She also said that Angela was
such a talented music student at
the Conservatory of Paris that she
was invited to stay.
But, she said, because she still
worried about her teenage daugh
ter then, she asked her to come
home.
By the time Angela had re
turned to Stanford last fall, Mar
lene Torrey said, she had stopped
worrying about her daughter.
"Everything was just great," she
said.
But after Angela's death, she
said, life had become a "24-
hour-a-day hell."

"" he Torreys said they have been
comforted somewhat by the flood
of mail they have received from all
over the world. They also said
they have been helped by a Port
land organization called Parents
of Murdered Children.
Marlene Torrey said the group
had helped them understand the
frustrations which such parents
encounter. "Some of them kne.»-
who did it, but couldn't convict,"
she said. The couple said they
have also learned to be patient
with the criminal justice system.
Vet, the comfort and support
have their limits, the Torreys
commented. Angela's "birthdays
will still come up and Oct. 22 (the
date of Arvidson's death) will
come up," Michael Torrey said.
Angela's mother said the trial is
"just another thing we've gone
through. I still have to live with the
fact that I'll never see Angela
again."
